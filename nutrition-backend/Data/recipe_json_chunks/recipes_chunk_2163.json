      "If you are making dessert crepes, add the sugar to the batter with the flour and stir in the cognac or vanilla when the batter is mixed.",

      "Uncover the batter and beat with the whisk, as the flour will have settled.",

      "You can run the spatula around the edges of the crepe to loosen it, then slide the spatula underneath, and with a quick movement flip it over, using your hand if needed.",
      "Or, if you are a hardy soul, you can tip and shake the pan until the crepe hangs over the front edge a bit, then pick it up with your fingers and turn it over (if you do this quickly, you wont burn your fingers) or use a spatula and one hand.",
      "Or, if you can flip a pancake, shake the pan once or twice to loosen the crepe and then give the pan a quick jerk so the crepe flips over of its own accord.",
      "If the crepe does not lie completely flat in the pan, pat it down with your fingers.",
      "I find the flipping or hand-turning methods are safer and more professional.",
      "With a spatula there is always the chance that you will break or cut the crepe.",
      "Return the pan to the heat bake the second side, which will take only about half a minute, then turn the crepe out by quickly inverting the pan over the plate.",
      "The second side will be less brown than the first side but that doesnt matter.",
      "This is the side on which you put the filling.",
      "Continue to heat the pan, brush it with butter, and make crepes until all the batter is gone.",
      "If you are using the crepes right away, simply stack them on the plate.",
      "Should you wish to make them ahead of time, put waxed paper between the crepes as you stack them and, when they are cool, cover the stack and the plate with plastic wrap and leave at room temperature or in the refrigerator until you are ready to use them.",
