      "To put them back together, you temper it.",
      "There are a variety of ways to do it.",
      "One of the easiest ways is to place it in the microwave for 30 seconds at a time on high power until the chocolate is melted.",
      "Be very careful not to overheat it.",
      "The chocolate will not look as if it has melted because it retains its shape.",
      "It should be only slightly warmer than your bottom lip.",
      "You may still see lumps in it, but don't worry; the residual heat of the chocolate will melt them.",
      "You can also use an immersion blender to break up the lumps and start the recrystallization process.",
      "Usually, the chocolate begins to set (recrystallize) along the side of the bowl.",
      "As it begins to crystallize, mix those crystals into the melted chocolate and they will begin the recrystallization process.",
      "I like to use a glass bowl because it retains the heat and keeps the chocolate tempered for a long time.",
      "Another way to temper chocolate is called seeding.",
      "In this method, tempering is achieved by adding small pieces of unmelted chocolate to melted chocolate.",
      "The amount of unmelted chocolate to be added depends on the temperature of the melted chocolate but is usually one fourth of the total amount.",
      "I usually use an immersion blender to mix the two together.",
      "The classic way to temper chocolate is called tabliering.",
      "Chocolate is melted over a hot water bath to a temperature between 88F and 90F (31C and 32C).",
      "(White and milk chocolate are melted to a temperature approximately 2F less, depending on the amount of milk fat they contain.)",
      "Two thirds of the melted chocolate is poured on a cold table or marble surface.",
      "The chocolate is spread out and worked with a spatula until the temperature of the chocolate is approximately 81F (27C).",
      "At this stage, it is thick and begins to set.",
      "This tempered chocolate is then added to the remaining one third of nontempered chocolate and mixed thoroughly until the mass in the bowl has a completely uniform temperature.",
      "If the temperature is still too high, part of the chocolate is further worked on the cold table until the correct temperature is reached.",
      "This is a lot of work, requires a lot of room, and makes a big mess.",
      "A simple method to check tempering is to apply a small quantity of chocolate to a piece of paper or to the point of a knife.",
      "If the chocolate has been tempered correctly, it will harden evenly and show a good gloss within 5 minutes."
