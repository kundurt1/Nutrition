When dough gets too stiff to mix, knead by hand on clean, lightly floured work surface until smooth. Place in lightly greased bowl and cover with dish towel. Set in a warm place. Let rise until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour. Press the air out again and form into small fist sized rolls. Place on a greased baking sheet. While rising a second time, preheat oven to 350\u00b0. After doubled in size, roll dough into small balls and place in groups of 3 into well buttered muffin pan. Bake for 12 minutes until golden brown. Makes 24."
