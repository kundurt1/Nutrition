Thin the glaze to a spreadable consistency with hot water, a few drops at a time until completely smooth. Set the glaze in a large bowl half full of hot tap water to help keep glaze warm while you work. Reheat it to warm in a saucepan or in a microwave over if it cools completely) If the glaze thickens upon standing, stir in a few more drops of hot water until thoroughly blended; be sure to blend in thoroughly, so the glaze maintains its luster. Using a table knife, spreader or small palette knife, cover the top of each cookie witha smaooth even layer of glaze. Let the cookies stand on wire racks until the glaze completely sets, at least 1 1/2 hours and preferably several hours. Store in a single layer or layered with wax paper in an airtight container.",

      "NOTE # 1: I always end up using more of the 1st 3 ingredients to press onto pan because it never seems to be enough. I've also found through trial and error that the chocolate wafer mixture adheres to pan better if you butter your pan first.",
      "NOTE # 2: When melting chocolate over a double boiler be careful not to let the boiling water heavily touch the pan that the chocolate is inches This will cause the chocolate to seize (harden in lumps), and will not soften to a smooth texture. Too high a temperature will also cause the same effect. This is especially true for white chocolate which is more sensitive to seizing, be sure to melt gently.",
      "NOTE # 3: Depending on your oven, it may not be easy to leave your door partially open which means, more or less 2-4 inches open. Therefore, place a kitchen towel on the corner of your oven door and snug the door against it. This will keep your oven door partially open."

      "Let cool for 5 minutes in the form, then take the cake out of the form, dust with caster sugar.",
      "Serve it warm or completely cooled.",
      "NOTE on Baking Form: I use a pound cake form (3.5 x 9.5 inches). The amount of ingredients is based on this size. You can use any other square baking form. A round baking form would also work. The dough should only cover the bottom of the baking form. It will rise during baking, but should not reach more than half of the height of the apples. If you use another sized baking form adapt the amounts of ingredients and apples to your needs. If you use a pound cake form, it is a bit tricky to get the cake out of the form. Stuff some paper towels loosely around the apples, then turn the form carefully. The paper towels will prevent that the cake will brake apart.",
      "Note on Rum: when baking for kids you can sub the rum by water and other flavourings like vanilla or cinnamon."

Dust the tops of the dough with flour and cover the loaf pans loosely with plastic wrap. Let the dough proof for 8-24 hours in the refrigerator.",
      "When dough has done proofing, preheat the oven to 375\u00b0F Lightly flour the top of each loaf. With a razor blade or very sharp knife, score the top of each loaf diagonally 3 times. Place the sheet pan in the center of the preheated oven and bake for 50 minutes."

      "When preparing a picanha for the skewer cut against the grain. The picanha is a big piece of meat and should be cut again at home before it is grilled. If you'd like to serve it on a big skewer like they do in churrascaria restaurants, cut the picanha in 3 pieces on a angle perpendicular to the fibers running diagonally through the picanha. Then bend these pieces into semicircles, fat-side out, and place them on one large oiled skewer. This allows you to slice off delicatley tender pieces wothout having to remove the picanha from the skewer. You can then rub the exposed surface with more rock salt and grill it some more. Every slice will have that outer, salty, crusty grilled deliciousness of the first slice. This is how they do it in churrascaria restaurants.",
      "OR When preparing a picanha in steaks cut with the grain. If you don't have the large skewer, you need not fret. You can grill a picanha home-style in thick steaks. This way is not as flashy, but I think the results are superior. When dividing the whole picanha into steaks, cut the meat in the same directions as the fibers. When you slice the grilled steaks to serve you will be slicing across the fibers creating deliciously juicy morsels each with their own little fatty edge.I have on more than one occasion cut the picanha the wrong way and it was still delicious. Like I said, picanhas are really hard to mess up.",

      "Grill the steaks fat-side up for a few minutes until a little juice leaks out of the top of the steaks. If you are grilling on the big skewer, both sides are the same, there is no fat-side. Turn the steaks onto their sides to grill for a few more minutes. Finally grill fat-side down moving the steaks away from the hottest part of the fire to avoid over-cooking and to reduce the chance of the fire flaring up from the dripping fat. Grill to your desired doneness. I use the finger poke to know if the meat is done. Try not to puncture the meat when grilling.",

Add the chopped onion and minced garlic to the pan and fry very gently for another 10 minutes or so. Add the pumpkin pieces, turn well in the oniony oil and then add the vermouth (or wine), the water and chopped tomatoes. Roast in a pre-heated oven for 30 to 45 minutes, stirring occasionally. Taste for seasoning - I tend to add quite a bit of salt here - and leave to cool.",

ALWAYS came home infested. After much research, I discovered Tea Tree Oil. That was 6 years ago. . . . but she also is always immune to any outbreaks at school as well. The tea tree oil (TTO) kills the Louse Central Nervous System (CNS) so they cannot move around and reproduce. Of course, they also die because they cannot feed. Tea tree oil also acts as a repellent because Lice cannot stand it. Therefore, if your child has lice: Apply freely to the scalp and around ears and neck, wherever lice are prominant. Soak the hair in TTO and cover with a cap and sleep on it. Put a towel down on the pillowcase or around their area bcz the oil will stain. As a preventative, we add just a few drops to her shampoo to repel and discourage those nasty little blood suckers. I swear by this and I feel the need to share anytime I can. I struggled SO much, was overcome with frustration and at my wits and when I discovered this. TTO can be found in WALMART vitamin/mineral aisle or at any health food store. Please pass this on as I'm sure you know someone who could use this info. Kate."
