Sometimes I have to add more milk if it's a bit thick, especially if I added berries. My yield is usually about 1 3/4 of a cup but it's not exact. When I have them, I love adding frozen berries for a frosty treat and the added nutrients; I especially love blueberries. The brands I usually use are Silk Pure Almond original flavor almond milk (but I like coconut almond too), Spectrum Decadent Blend Chia & Flax Seed with coconut & cocoa (when I don't have that I will usually still add about 1 tsp chia seeds and a bit of coconut if I have any) and Garden of Life Alkalizer & Detoxifier RAW Organic Green Super Food grass powder."

      "2. When cycle finishes, turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Divide dough in half. Roll each half into a 12 inch circle, spread 1/4 cup softened butter over entire round. Cut each circle into 8 wedges. Roll wedges starting at wide end; roll gently but tightly. Place point side down on ungreased cookie sheet. Cover with clean kitchen towel and put in a warm place, let rise 1 hour. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 400*F.",
      "My Note: I'm always asked to bring the rolls to get-togethers. I've used it for cinnamon rolls, monkey bread -- almost everything. I do cheat, however; normally I cut the dough into 36 pieces and place 3 into each cup of a muffin tin. It makes big, light clover leaf rolls that everyone raves over. don't have a breadmaker, so I made these the traditional way (dissolve yeast and 1 tbsp sugar in warm water, let sit for about 10 minute Meanwhile, warm milk in saucepan until it just bubbles. Remove from heat, stir in sugar and butter until melted and cool to lukewarm. In a large bowl combine yeast mixture, milk mixture and egg. Stir in flour a little at a time and knead on lightly floured surface about 8 min.) Cover and let rise about 1 hr -- punch down and then roll out. I baked at 375 for 12 min, but could have used a tad longer. Still very good. he dough was too sticky in the machine, so I sprinkled flour into it until it was smooth. I was concerned about not using bread machine flour or bread machine yeast. I used the all purpose flour as it called for, but I used the bread machine yeast -- it was all I had. I used 2 1/2 tsp of bread machine yeast. They rose just fine and taste great. I will use this recipe to replace my old bread machine roll recipe. As did another reviewer, I cut my dough into 36 pieces and placed three balls of dough into each muffin cup. They turned into beautiful clover rolls. Nice touch. Also, I use a pizza cutter to cut my dough."

      "\"Preheat the oven to 375\u00b0F.",
      "Cut each baby eggplant in half, keeping the stem end intact and going straight to the tail tip. Use one tablespoon of oil to brush liberally over the eggplants, both front and back, before laying them cut side up on a baking sheet. Tuck the oiled eggplant halves in the oven for approximately 20 minutes, or until the flesh is soft and easily pierced with a fork but the bodies have not collapsed.",
      "While the eggplant are baking up, it's a perfect time to toast the pine nuts. Spread the nuts out on an ungreased baking sheet in a single layer. Tuck them in the oven for 3-5 minutes, shaking the pan halfway through. When the pine nuts are mostly golden brown (some may be darker and that is absolutely okay) they are toasted and ready. Shake the nuts off the pan and into a bowl so that they do not continue cooking with the ambient heat.",
      "Cooking the bulghar is as easy as can be. Put it into a heatproof container and pour the boiling water over top. Sprinkle liberally with salt (about 1/2 tsp) and let it stand for 15 minutes. The grain will start to soak up that hot, salty water and rehydrate, becoming tender and fluffy. You could let the bulghar soak for as long as 30 minutes, but I like to drain it after 15 so that it is still a touch al dente. After all, when the bulgar is added to the tomato mixture and baked it will continue to soak up moisture so it shouldn't be mushy soft.",
      "The nuts are toasted, the eggplant is baking, and the bulghar is soaking. Life is pretty good.",
      "Chop the onions into a small, thin mince and finely mince the garlic. Put the aromatics in a large saucepan, along with the remaining two tablespoons of oil, and set it over medium heat. Starting the onions and garlic off in a cold pan will encourage them to deepen and sweeten without as much risk of burning.",
      "After 5-7 minutes when the onions are a pale gold color add the diced tomatoes, honey and dried spices. Okay, so I totally didn't use diced tomatoes here. I used whole canned tomatoes, because I love to squish them into a pulp in my hands before adding them to the pan. We all have our quirky little habits, and that just happens to be one of mine. Give this a stir and turn the heat down slightly to medium low. You will need to cook the tomato mixture for at least 7-10 minutes, stirring fairly regularly, or until the liquid has reduced significantly in the pan.",
      "Are the eggplants soft? As soon as they are cool enough to handle, use a small paring knife to score all around the edges of the eggplant, leaving a skin which is about 1/4\" thick. Carefully scoop out the flesh (I like to use a melon-baller to do this) which needs to be given a good chop.",
      "When the tomato mixture has thickened enough that you can run a spoon through it and still see the bottom of the pan 5 seconds later, add the chopped eggplant flesh and stir it through. Let this cook for a minute or two so that the flavors can combine.",
      "Finely chop the mint and parsley leaves. There should be slightly more mint than parsley, but be generous with both. Reserve one tablespoon of the chopped herbs to use as garnish.",
      "Take the pan off the heat before adding the bulgar (which has been drained and squeezed dry) to the tomatoes, along with the pine nuts, mint and parsley. Stir everything together, squeeze in the juice of 1/2 lemon, and season quite generously with salt and pepper. You can't afford to be shy with the seasoning in a bulgar dish.",
      "Spoon the stuffing into your gutted eggplant halves, pressing it together and really mounding it inches Your cupped palm is the best tool that you could have to keep the mixture in a pseudo-dome shape as you press it into the shells.",
      "Bake the eggplant for 15-20 minutes, or until they are warmed through and the tops are just starting to brown. Sprinkle the eggplant with your reserved chopped parsley and mint, and serve with a bowl of black olives and some fresh pita bread on the side.",
      "The sultry cinnamon and allspice, combined with smoky nutmeg and just a mere whiff of heat from the chili are enough to elevate a simple bulgar and tomato stuffing into the realm of the exotic in a non-intimidating way.",
      "Light, clean, healthy and vegetarian dinners are always easier than I expect. In fact, I'm rather looking forward to putting the chicken breasts aside again a few days from now.\"."

If it is falling apart you need to let it dry some more or add some extra flour to the outside of the pasta. Depending on the size of your noodle it may be done in as little as one to two minutes. Remove a test noodle and let it cool for a few seconds and taste (don't be afraid to have made some herbed butter or have your favorite sauce ready to test the flavor combinations.) If all is right you can crank out as much pasta as you want to and get cooking.",

You can also make thicker style pasta (rustic if you want to give it a cool name) by keeping the pasta sheets thicker and tearing or pinching off portions of the pasta. Toss these bigger chunks in seasoned flour and cook em up. I once did this and fried em on my side burner of my grill to go with the steaks I was grilling. Needless to say that was a great night."
