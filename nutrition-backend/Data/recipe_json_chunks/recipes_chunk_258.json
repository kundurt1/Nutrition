Try to keep temperature so that the cabbage will brown, but the moisture will cook off and not make the cabbage soggy. Add sliced kielbasa, Worcestershire sauce, salt and pepper. Cook, uncovered until kielbasa is thoroughly heated. While cabbage is cooking add the bouillon cubes to boiling water and cook egg noodles as directed on package. Drain the noodles and toss with remaining butter. Place the noodles on a serving plate and \"nest\" the cabbage in the center. Great served with hot French bread."
