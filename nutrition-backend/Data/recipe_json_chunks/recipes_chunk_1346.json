Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil and 1 tablespoon butter in a saute pan and saute the garlic, shallot, and chopped onion for about 7-8 minutes, until softened. Add a splash of white wine to the pan and cook until absorbed. 6. Take off the heat and add the herbes de Provence, bread crumbs, Parmesan, and thyme. Add salt and pepper to taste. Mix well. 7. Fill the onions with the stuffing. Press lightly to fit the stuffing tightly in the onion cavity and then mound it up a bit on top. Dot with butter. 8. Pour white wine into the baking dish to a depth of just 1/4 inch. Cover loosely with foil and bake for another 30 minutes, or until the onion is completely tender. The exact time is going to depend on the size and shape of your onions. Check with a small sharp knife, it should slide in without resistance."

      "The following day, simmer the pork skin in water to cover until it is supple, 10 to 20 minutes. Drain, roll up the strip, and tie it with string.",
      "Dry the cubes of pork shoulder with paper towels. In an 8- or 9-quart flameproof casserole, heat the duck fat over moderately high heat. Add the pork shoulder and lightly brown on all sides. Add the onions and carrots and saute, stirring, until the onions are soft and golden, about 5 minutes. Add the ham hock or pig's knuckles and the whole piece of ventreche or pancetta. Allow these meats to brown a little around the edges, turning the pieces occasionally. Add the whole head of garlic, and the tomato or tomato paste; cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Add the stock, bundle of pork skin, and herb bouquet. Bring to a boil; cover, reduce the heat to low, and simmer the ragout for 1 1/2 hours.",
      "When the ragout has cooked for l hour, drain the beans and put them into a large saucepan, cover with fresh water, and slowly bring to a boil. Skim, and simmer for a few minutes, then drain and immediately add the beans to the simmering ragout. Continue simmering for up to 2 hours, or until the beans are tender. (You can tell when the beans are done by removing one or two beans with a spoon and blowing on them-the skins will burst.) Let cool, then skim off all the fat that has risen to the top; reserve 2 tablespoons of this fat for finishing the cassoulet. Cover the pork ragout and beans and refrigerate overnight to develop the flavors.",
      "The next day, steam the duck confit for 10 minutes to soften. As soon as the meat is cool enough to handle, pull it off the bones in large chunks.",
      "Remove the ragout and beans from the refrigerator and bring to room temperature. Pick out the ham hock or pig's knuckles, pancetta, garlic head, and herb bouquet. Cut the meat from the ham hock or pig's knuckles into bite-size pieces, discarding bones and fatty parts. Cut the pancetta into 1-inch pieces, discarding the extraneous fat. Set all the meats aside. Press on the garlic to extract the pulp and set aside. Discard the garlic skins and herb bouquet.",
      "In a food processor or electric blender, puree the pork fat or salt pork with the cooked and raw garlic and 1 cup water. Add this garlic puree to the ragout and beans and simmer for 30 minutes. Remove from the heat. Fold reserved meats into the ragout and beans.",
      "Preheat the oven to 325\u00b0F. To assemble the cassoulet, remove the roll of pork skin from the ragout. Untie, cut the skin into 2-inch pieces, and use to line a 5 1/2- or 6-quart ovenproof casserole, preferably earthenware, and fat side down-the skin side sticks (see Note below). Using a large slotted spoon or skimmer, add one half of the beans and pork shoulder. Scatter the duck confit on top of the pork and beans. Cover with the remaining beans and pork ragout. Taste the ragout cooking liquid and adjust the seasoning; there will probably be no need for salt. Pour just enough of the ragout liquid over the beans to cover them. Be sure there is at least 1 inch of \"growing space\" between the beans and the rim of the dish. Drizzle with the 2 tablespoons fat reserved in Step 4. Place the casserole in the oven and let cook for 1 1/2 hours.",

      "Reduce the oven heat to 275\u00b0F. Gently stir up the skin that has formed on the beans. Place the sausages on top of the beans. Dust the bread crumbs on top of the beans and sausage. Bake the cassoulet for 1 more hour. The top crust should become a beautiful golden brown; if it isn't, turn on the broiler and carefully \"toast\" the top layer of beans, about 2 minutes. Transfer the cassoulet from the oven to a cloth-lined surface and let it rest 20 minutes. Drizzle with the walnut oil just before serving."

      "You'll want to mop it once an hr. Next is the bbq sauce. You can always use your favorite bbq sauce, But its better to make your own. I got a recipe from a book called BBQ USA. Its called Apple Barbeque sauce. It has ketchup, applesauce (I made my own), cider vinegar, worcestershire sauce, soy sauce, liquid smoke, brown sugar, garlic powder, white pepper, ginger, apple (pealed, cored, and finely grated), onion (finely grated), jalapeno (minced). Simmer for around an hour. About an hour before the meat is done, stop the mop sauce and put a coat of the bbq sauce on. When its done take it inside and let it rest for around two hours. While its resting you can bake your own buns, and make some cole slaw. I just found an easy recipe on line for some buns. They turned out kinda small but they were tasty. I also found a southern style creamy cole slaw. It has mayo, sour cream, sugar, cidar vinegar, lemon juice, dry mustard, celery, seeds pepper, salt, and hot sauce. Mix that together then add cabbage. After the meat has rested, start to pull. Grab two large forkes and pull the meat in opposite directions until it is all shreaded. Take out the bone and any fat, though there shouldn't be much. I put the bone in a plastic bag and put it in the freezer for a pot of beans later. To build the sandwich cut the bun, put a heeping pile of meat on the bottom, then a bit of the bbq sauce, then a nice pile of the slaw, and the top of the bun. See if you can get your mouth around it. I don't mean to toot my own horn but it was the best sandwich I have ever eaten. I ate three in about four hours. Some buddies came over and they didn't understand the slaw on the sandwich, as I would think a lot of people in this area would. They tried it without first, then with, and they all agree the slaw is as much a part of it as the meat. Hope you try it. HAPPY BARBEQUEING!!!!"

Flip the patties and grill another 2 minutes. Turn the heat to medium-low, cover the pan and cook until the patties are cooked through, about 3-5 minutes, depending on how thick your patties are, what protein you use and how done you like your burgers. I suggest cooking pork, turkey and chicken all the way through.",

While you do not have to use pure 90% poor folk, as anywhere from 70% will do, a 90% poor folk blend is recommended for the most radical of dishes. After pouring, let it coagulate slightly before cooling.",
      "After the poor folk are stationary and cannot escape their situation, pour a tiny amount of 10% rich folk on top of your poor. The percentage rich folk blend you use should increase or decrease as your poor folk blend does the opposite, if you are not using a 90% poor folk blend. The pressure of this rich folk mixture should press down on the poor, making it impossible for them to escape until the end dish. Let this coagulate as well, as you did the last step.",
      "Cut a hole through the now solidified rich folk and into the poor blend. This hole will be where you will be working for the majority of the rest of the dish. Now, take your 1/4 teaspoon of low wages and pour it into the poor folk layer. You do not want this to get near the rich folk layer, so it is advisable to be careful, as giving the rich low wages will make the two layers more equal, which is not wanted for a good revolution. This low wage blend should make your poor folk complain slightly. Put your ear close to the poor layer after letting the low wages soak and listen for people getting sick or yelling at the rich layer. If you hear this, you should be ready to move on.",
      "After the low wages have soaked in, the poor blend should be a little more sick, dying and dead, meaning it should be easier to cut a few more chunks out. Remember to not touch the rich folk, but carve out a few tunnels barely big enough for one spider and begin to insert the unsafe working and living conditions. You should make about 4-5 holes and divide your cup of unsafe condition as such, to make sure every part of the poor layer feels the effects of this new concoction you'll be inserting. If this is done correctly, the sounds of the poor will get louder and much of the layer will catch on fire and burn, though this will be contained to them only. Remember, the rich layer should not be touched at this point. Along with the burning, you should hear the sound of children getting their arms cut off in a grinder or dying of chimney smoke if you listen closely. This means you're on the right track.",
      "Up next, take your 50g of high taxes and roll it out with a roller. Then roll it up into a fine ball with your hands (wash after using this, high taxes stick with you if you don't get rid of them quick) and place it over the hole you've cut to get to the poor layer. If you need more high taxes to cover up this hole, you are free to place more on top of the poor layer. After placing the high taxes on top of the poor hole, making it virtually impossible for them to escape from their current situation and causing the death and sickness rates to be so high you can hear the screams and coughs throughout the kitchen, it's time to move on.",
      "On a paper towel separate from your bowl, place your leader. If you're making a Central or Latin American dish, instead use your mestizo leaders for this part. Take your enlightenment ideas and cover your leader figure in them. A knife is recommended, though any method of spreading works. Make sure to fully cover them in enlightenment ideas to make sure they will work as a leader for the upcoming steps.",
      "First, use a roller or any cylindrical object and press a hole through the high taxes. Make sure to reach the poor layer of your dish. Then, once you have a secure passage, insert your leader into the poor layer. The enlightenment ideas should allow them to pass straight into the poor layer, which will initiate the final steps of the process. If you are making any dish not American or French, take your Napoleonic War extract and spread it over the dish. This should distract the high class and allow a much easier and faster evolution phase.",
      "If you are making a Central or Latin American Dish, take out your mestizo leader and crush them using some excess high class, then repeat steps 6 and 7 using the creole leader you haven't used yet.",
      "Assuming all the steps have been done correctly, the poor layer should start to overtake the rich layer, pulling it down to below the poor layer. If you're making a French dish, before this happens, make sure to use your guillotine to cut off some of the rich layer, for a little je ne sais quoi (this means \"I don't know what,\" mainly because the guillotine serves no practical purpose other than to make the revolution dish more popular). If a French dish is not being made, however, it is best to simply let the poor layer overtake the rich layer and high taxes.",
      "After all is said and done, the leader you placed in the poor layer in step 7 should now be an emperor on top of the once poor layer. If this happens, the revolution creation has been a success! However, as there is now another ruler, the revolution has become moot. While it is possible to eat this revolution dish you have just created, the effects of the revolution will linger for a very long time (forever) and the poor decisions made when making a new ruler will stay with you for the rest of your days.",
      "Enjoy the effects of your revolution, as it will only be a few hundred years before the world is destroyed by either wars or global warming! While enjoying your revolution, be sure to take in any economic unrest and horrific political situations you may have created in the process, especially if you've made a Central/Latin American dish or a French dish. Until then, however, have a blast enjoying your revolution that will be undone in only a couple decades!"

Limp bacon is a saboteur of this dish, you won't get the depth of flavor or the texture if you barely cook the bacon. Remove bacon when crisp, leave most of the fat in the bottom of the pot. Chop onion and celery into smallish pieces and add to pot. Stir onion and celery until onion gets a nice light brown color, carmelizing it. Chop medium potatoes into small bite sized pieces. Chop the small potato into very very small chunks, or slice it very thin, the small potato will provide some thickening to the soup. Add all of the potato to the pot and stir. Add corn, coconut milk, water, boullion cubes, chopped green chilies, reserved cooked chopped bacon, cilantro or coriander, and cumin to the pot. Put pot on medium high heat, and bring to a simmer. Reduce heat to medium and cook until potatoes are soft. Salt and pepper to taste. Serve. And yes, for you people out there who do not have a milk allergy, cheddar cheese will taste absolutely delicious on top. If you have a milk allergy, like I do, it's quite delicious as is."
