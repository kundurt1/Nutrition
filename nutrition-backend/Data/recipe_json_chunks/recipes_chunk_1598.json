Place the beaters into the bowl and turn to speed 2 until roughly incorporated, then increase to speed 6 and mix until light and fluffy, about 4-5 minutes. Halfway through mixing, stop the mixer to scrape the bowl and beaters with a spatula. Chef's Notes: To scrape a vanilla bean, put the bean on a cutting surface. Using the tip of the paring knife, cut the bean lengthwise. Then, using the point, or edge of the knife, scrape the seeds loose from the pod and add to your recipe.",

Rotate the pan halfway through baking. Cool the pan on a wire baking rack for 3 minutes, then remove the cupcakes from the pan, place back on the rack, and cool to room temperature before frosting. Chef's Notes: To achieve a light and moist cupcake, it's important that you not over-bake the cupcakes. The cupcake should still be very light in color, have risen just slightly, with a slight browning along the edges. Additionally, only let the cupcakes sit in the baking pan for 3-5 minutes before taking them out of the pan (the heat from the pan can cause the cupcakes to overcook).",

Once creamy, turn to speed 6 and whip until the buttercream is light, airy, and soft, another 3-4 minutes. Halfway through the mixing process, scrape down the bowl using a spatula. Chef's Notes: To achieve a light texture for the buttercream, the butter and mascarpone cheese must be whipped to a light and fluffy consistency. It seems like a lot of mixing time, but the result yields a better product. If improperly mixed, the buttercream will be heavy and taste like butter.",

      "For a lesser known, but equally delicious option, give German Buttercream a try - butter is whipped with pastry cream. The result is a buttercream that tastes like whipped vanilla pudding. - Pastry Cream for German Buttercream - 1 cup whole milk, 1/2 vanilla bean (halved lengthwise), 1/2 cup granulated sugar (divided), 2 large egg yolks, 1 large egg, 2 1/2 tsp cornstarch, 1/8 tsp fine sea salt, 1/2 tsp pure vanilla extract; DIRECTIONS: In a medium saucepan add the whole milk, vanilla pod and seeds, and 1/4 cup of the sugar. Set aside. In a medium mixing bowl add the remaining 1/4 cup sugar, egg yolks, whole egg, cornstarch, and salt. Whisk until thoroughly combined. Set aside. Place the saucepan over a stove set to medium heat. Whisk frequently until the sugar dissolves and the mixture comes to a simmer, 2-3 minutes. Remove from the heat and discard the vanilla pod. Pour 1/2 of the hot milk mixture into the egg mixture, whisking the egg mixture as you stream in the milk (this will keep the eggs from scrambling). Whisk until smooth and pour through a fine mesh strainer back into the remaining hot milk in the saucepan. Whisk until smooth. Place the saucepan back onto the stove and turn to medium heat. Cook, whisking constantly, until the custard turns thick and is a bit lumpy, 1.5-2 minutes. As soon as the custard begins to bubble, continue to cook for 1 more minute to cook off the starch. Note: cooked pastry cream should read 200\u00b0F/93\u00b0C on a thermometer. Remove the pot from the heat and whisk in the vanilla extract. Pour the pastry cream into a medium, shallow container (to help speed the cooling process) and place a piece of plastic wrap on top of the pastry cream to prevent it from forming a skin. Place in the fridge until the pastry cream has thickened and cooled to room temperature, about 1 hour. Once the pastry cream has cooled, remove from the fridge and set aside. In a medium mixing bowl, add the butter (omit the mascarpone cheese for this recipe). Fit the hand mixer with the turbo beater attachments. Place the beaters in the butter and turn to speed 5. Beat until the butter is light and fluffy, 3-4 minutes. Then, while mixing, add the pastry cream a Tablespoon at a time until the mixture is smooth and creamy. Stop the mixer to scrape the bowl and beaters as needed during mixing. Once creamy, stop the mixer and remove the beaters. Fit the mixer with the whisk attachment and place back into the bowl. Turn to speed 6 and whip until the buttercream is light, airy, and soft, another 3-4 minutes."

      "First parboil your chicken wings in a pot with a bit of water inside. Add the chicken seasoning into the boiling water and wings. And let it boil under a lid for about 15 minutes. This helps you to ensure your wings will be cooked well to the bone but also prevents them to getting too dry in the oven. Pre-heat your oven for 215 C.",
      "Whisk together your sauce (all other ingredients) and make sure all ingredients combines well. Mix it together with the leftover chicken stock left from the chicken wings you now boiled. The heat of the water will also help all the ingredients combine much better.",
      "Place now your wings in the oven upside down. You will be turning them later.",
      "After about 10-15 minutes turn them to their correct position and continue to bake for additional 10-15 minutes or until you have achieved your desired colouring of your chicken. \nYou can put them in foil so they do not loose the good sticky sauce and also it will be much easier to store in the fridge.",
      "Serve as you fancy I went for sticky wings with wild rice sprinkled with spring onions and sesame seed "

Lightly brush on a little vegetable oil on the stuffer, then place one end of the casing onto the Sausage Stuffer Kit, and gather it at the base of the attachment. Tie a knot or use string to secure the end of the casing. Stuff the casing with the sausage mixture, by guiding it through the attachment, making sure the chicken mixture is packed consistently into the casing, but not over stuffed. Knot the other end and use a toothpick or needle to release any air bubbles in the casing. Create links by gathering about 6 inches of the sausage and twisting at least three times. You can also use string and tie the links if it is easier. Allow to dry on a rack for about 30 minutes in a cool environment or in the refrigerator, or until casings are dry to the touch. Refrigerate or freeze until ready to use.",
      "Grill or pan fry the sausages for about 15-20 minutes or until browned on all sides and cooked thoroughly. Enjoy!"

I first use the paddle attachment, then finish off with the dough hook. The dough should come together nicely, but remains very moist and sticky.",
      "In a separate cup or small bowl, add one and a half packets or roughly 1 1/2 tablespoons of dry active yeast to a 1/4 cup warm water. Let it stand for 5 to 10 minutes.",
      "Once the yeast mixture is ready, add it to the frittelle batter, along with a teaspoon of salt. Drain the raisins from their soaking liquid and add them to the batter as well. Stir the mixture until it becomes homogeneous. Now the batter is just about ready. Cover the mixing bowl with a cloth, and let it rise for a couple of hours at room temperature.",
      "After the dough has rested enough time, heat the oil for frying in a pan or a deep fryer, the oil should be about 375 degrees. Add the dough to the oil in heaping spoonfulls, they should be somewhat of a sphere shape. Frittelle need about 2 minutes to cook, with a turning over midway through. They should take on a nice light brown color. When they appear done, remove the frittelle from the fryer, and immediately roll them in the final 1/4 of sugar, so that they get a nice coating. If you have vanilla sugar, that is a nice touch, but normal white sugar works just fine. Serve frittelle immediately. They are best when warm, but can be eaten room temperature as well. ENJOY!"

Form into a ball and let it rest, covered with a floured towel for about 15 minutes. Keep the dough you are not working on covered with the towel while you cut the ball in half, then quarters and eighths. You will have 8 equal triangular bits of dough. Keep them covered while you take out one at a time and shape it into a ball. Put that one back under the towel and do the next one. After all the balls are shaped let them rest while you prepare the pan or pans they will rise in.",

You can do this by rolling them out into ropes about 10 or 11 inches long, without tapering the ends, then overlapping and pinching the ends and rolling against the kneading surface with your hand in the hole until it is well sealed and uniformly thick. I find this tedious and prefer to poke a hole in the center of the ball and stretch it into shape. This makes less perfect looking bagels, but once they are covered with a topping, no one is the wiser. If I were baking them plain, I would use the rope method.",
      "Place each in the pan(s), leaving plenty of space between them. You don't ever want them to touch as they rise because it will be difficult to cut them apart without deflating and mishaping them. Cover the pan tightly with plastic wrap so it will never touch the bagels. Refrigerate for 12-15 hours. They will not appear to have risen much at all.",
      "Remove pans from fridge and leave them, covered, in cool place for another couple hours, until they are puffy. To test for readiness, drop one in a bowl of cool water. It should float. If not, wait longer and test again.",
      "Meanwhile, prepare your boiling water; preheat your oven, with tiles or stone, to 450 degrees; and prepare your toppings. You will need at least three inches of rapidly boiling water in a large pot and a skimmer or flat strainer, also cake racks and a peel.",
      "Put your toppings in soup bowls. I like to use sesame seeds with a pinch of kosher salt. A mixture of sesame, a pinch of kosher salt, a little poppy and some sunflower seeds is good.",
      "You can also add caraway, fennel, cumin, whatever; or start with one and add others after dipping some bagels so you end up with a variety. The seeds will stick easily to the freshly boiled bagels. Onion and/or garlic topping needs to be handled differently, more about that later.",
      "I boil one at a time; any more creates the danger of over boiling. Drop one bagel into the boiling water and press it under the water with the skimmer. Boil for 20 or 30 seconds, just until the dough becomes a little puffy. Remove with the skimmer and flip it into the bowl of seeds top side down. I use a chopstick in the hole to remove the bagel otherwise I end up with burnt and sticky fingers. Place the bagel on the cake rack. When all are boiled, wait a minute or two for the last ones to dry a little. Steam the oven while you're waiting.",
      "Then transfer them all to a semolina dusted peel for deposit onto the tiles or stone. Bake for about 15 minutes. Remove with peel and cool on racks.",
      "For onion topping: Thinly slice an onion or two and cut into little pieces, not too long, but not chopped or square either. Saute in a little olive oil until soft but not brown. Mix with as much poppy seed as you want. Just before topping the bagels, add a little kosher salt. I make this topping right after I put the dough into the refrigerator and let it sit out to dry a little during the 12 hours the bagels are in the fridge. Because of the oil, the onions won't stick like seeds do; so pat the onion"

As soon as the water begins to steam let it cook for 3 to 4 minutes then take it off the heat and let it sit for about 10 minutes.

      "Prep the Collard Leaves. 4 Bunches large collard leaves - the larger the better. This is approximate. You need enough leaves to wrap 20 sausages. If a leaf is really large, it can wrap two sausages. If the leaf is smaller, it will only wrap one sausage. Wash the leaves in cold water. Using a small paring knife, trim the large center vein from each leaf, effectively cutting it in half length-wise. Heat the stock to a low simmer (not a boil) in a large heavy pot. If your stock is completely de-fatted, add a little bacon fat, butter or oil to the stock. This adds a nice sheen to the leaves and keeps them from sticking together after they're cooked.",
      "Working in batches, submerge the leaves completely in the hot stock for 1 1/2 minutes per batch. The stock should be very hot, but not boiling. Remove to a wire rack and immediately shock in cold water to arrest the cooking. (I just rinsed them with my sink sprayer.)",

      "Lay a single large (or two small) leaves on your cutting board. If using 2 leaves, make sure the veins are parallel. Place a sausage in the lower third of the leaf, parallel to the veining. (You'll figure out why this is important the first time you try it the wrong way.) Make sure there's enough leaf on each side of the sausage to \"tuck in.\" Using your fingers, pack enough stuffing mixture to completely coat the top and sides of the sausage. Your stuffing should be moist enough to hold together. Start rolling the leaf from the bottom, tucking in the sides so the sausage and stuffing are completely encased.",
      "As you work, place the rolls in a large baking dish or roasting pan. When they're all assembled, pour in at least one inch of stock. Cover the pan tightly with aluminum foil. Bake 45 minutes to 1 hour, until most of the liquid has evaporated and the collards have lost some of their color. Check the pan periodically and add more liquid if needed. Don't let the pan dry out or the rolls will burn.",

    "title": "crispy frizzled artichokes",
    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "Prepare artichokes: Snap back toughest and unevenly sized outer leaves, peeling and plucking until you get to the paler yellowish leaves that are all the full length of the artichoke. Be careful of thorns; almost every leaf ends in one. If they're particularly bothersome, you can lop off the bottom third of the artichoke at this point. (We will otherwise do it next.) For baby artichokes, cut off bottom 1/3 of leaves. For full-sized artichokes, cut off bottom 2/3 of leaves (more than you see in my photos), leaving only the top parts attached to the stem and heart. Rub all cut sides with lemon.\n\nUse a knife to pare down rough spots where leaves met the heart. Use a vegetable peeler to remove the outermost layer of the stem and \"neck\" of the artichoke. With tiny artichokes, the stems are sometimes too small or in bad shape to be used, in which case, feel free to trim them off. Rub exposed sides with lemon.\n\nHalve baby artichokes lengthwise through the stem; for full-sized artichokes, quarter them through the stem. Rub cut sides with lemon.\n\nIf you're using baby artichokes, you're done with prep. If you're using full-sized artichokes, you'll need to take the additional step of cutting out and discarding the fibrous fuzzy (and unpleasant to eat) choke and the wiry (often purple) inner leaves. [See photos above for a visual aid.]",
      "Heat oven or grill: Heat oven to 400 degrees, a gas grill to its highest setting or a charcoal grill to a very high temperature.\n\nPar-boil artichokes: Bring a pot of salted water to a boil. Add trimmed artichokes and the halved lemon you've been using to prevent browning. Boil them for 5 minutes (for baby artichokes) or 10 to 15 minutes (for full-sized artichokes), until a knife point inserted into the neck of the artichoke pierces easily to the center. Drain artichokes well; discard lemon half.\n\nIf roasting artichokes: Drizzle roasting pan with olive oil, spread drained artichokes in a single layer, drizzle with a little additional olive oil and shower with coarse salt. Roast baby artichokes for 15 minutes, then flip, and roast for another 10 to 15 minutes, until crisp and browned. Roast full-sized artichokes for 20 to 25 minutes, then flip, and roast for another 15 to 20, also until crisp and browned.\n\nIf grilling artichokes: In a large bowl, toss drained artichokes with a glug or so of olive oil, enough that they all glisten. Season with salt. If the grill grates are close enough together, I use tongs to arrange the artichokes in one layer. If not, you might need to use a vegetable tray to keep the artichokes from falling through. Grill until artichokes are crisp and brown.\n\nTo serve: Shower with additional lemon juice (from second half of lemon), any extra salt (if needed) and parsley. Eat soon, or someone else will."

Mix on medium-low speed until smooth, about 1 minute. Open the ingredient valve, and sift in the powdered sugar. Increase the mixer to medium, and beat until smooth, stopping the mixer once to scrape down the sides of the bowl. Use a rubber spatula to incorporate any remaining bits of confectioners' sugar.",
      "To finish the cake, run a table knife around the inside edge of the pan to loosen the cake. Invert the cake onto a wire rack, peel off the parchment paper, and then turn the cake right side up. Place the cake on a wire rack with a baking sheet underneath to catch any drips. Pour the glaze over the cake, and use a small offset spatula to gently push the glaze evenly to the edges so it drips down the sides of the cake. Allow the glaze to set before transferring the cake to a cake plate. Cut into wedges when ready to serve. The cake can be made up to 2 days in advance. Store the cake for up to one week in a covered cake box at room temperature."

Very finely chop flesh and transfer to a large bowl.",

      "Preheat the oven to 350F.",
      "For the chocolate cake, mix all of the dry ingredients together so they are evenly distributed. Add the wet ingredients one at a time as listed, until full incorporated. This ensures the batter comes out nice and smooth. Take a springfoam pan like the one pictured below or a standard 9-inch round pan and line the bottom with parchment paper. Pour the batter about 3/4 of the way, leaving room for the cake to rise when baking. Place in the oven for 35 minutes, you can check the doneness by inserting a toothpick in the middle, if it comes out clean it is ready. Allow to cool and place in the freezer. (This makes the cake easier to cut)",
      "For the chocolate mousse, place the chocolate chips and butter in a double boiler as pictured below. Simply heat water in a large pot at medium heat and place a mixing bowl over it. This helps you melt the chocolate and butter without burning it. Be cautious of letting the water boil, it could potentially get inside the bowl with the chocolate and butter and that is a BIG no-no. Once melted and mixed thoroughly, set aside and cool to room temperature.",
      "Meanwhile, whip the egg whites until they are firm and hold peaks and add the sugar. Be careful not to over whip the egg whites, they should be shiny and smooth, not chunky. Also make sure the bowl you are whipping your egg whites in is dry and contains no water or any liquid - this ensures that your whites will form peaks or else you'll be whipping until your arm falls off with no results.",
      "Mix the melted chocolate with your egg whites in a folding motion - you do not want to over mix or you will flatten your egg whites and that will make your mousse \"goopy\". Whip the cream and when partially stiff add the vanilla. Once it is thick fold it into chocolate egg white mixture. Set aside.",
      "For the Chocolate Ganace, heat the cream and butter in medium sauce pan at medium heat. Add the brandy once the cream begins to bubble and pour over chocolate chips. Mix until all ingredients are incorporated.",
      "Take the cake out from the freezer. If you are using a spring foam pan fill it with the chocolate mousse to the top and place it back into the freezer.",
      "If you are using the standard 9 inch pan flip it upside down onto a flat surface with parchment paper. If you have a torch, torch the sides and bottom of the pan, this will release the cake from the pan. If you do not own a torch, take a paring knife along the edges of the pan and firmly tap the pan upside down, the cake should pop out. Then cut the cake in half horizontally - the easiest way to do this is to trace where you want to cut first around the edges of the cake and then cut into it the rest of the way. I use to just cut it without tracing and ended up with uneven, unhappy cake pieces.",
      "Another reason why you place the cakes in the freezer is so that the ganache frosting comes out nice and shiny. If the cake is warm, the icing comes out dull. Place one of the cake halves onto a wire rack and spread the top with chocolate mousse and place the other half on top. It is important that the cake is on a wire rack so the ganache can drip through. Carefully pour the ganache ontop of the cake, starting from the center and allowing it to drip down the sides."
