      "Finish with a larger drop of white chocolate directly on top of the other two to create the white of the eye.",

      "Affix the eyes by \"gluing\" them with a little dark chocolate.",
      "To make the butterflies: It is easy to reproduce any line drawing in chocolate.",
      "Place the drawing under a sheet of acetate.",

      "Use the dark chocolate to trace the outline of the drawing onto the acetate.",
      "Use both white and dark chocolate to shade the drawing as appropriate.",
      "Be sure to completely fill the inside of the drawing so you end up with a solid re-creation of the drawing.",
      "It will also be easier to unmold and handle if there are no gaps in the drawing.",
      "Place the acetate in the refrigerator to help the drawing to set.",
      "To unmold, simply peel the acetate from the front of the chocolate drawing.",
