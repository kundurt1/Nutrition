      "Sterilizing jars is the first step of preserving foods.",
      "Tips:",
      "Jars should be made from glass and free of any chips or cracks.",
      "Preserving or canning jars are topped with a glass, plastic, or metal lid, which has a rubber seal.",
      "Two piece lids are best for canning, as they vacuum seal when processed.",
      "To sterilize jars, before filling with jams, pickles, or preserves, wash jars and lids with hot, soapy water.",
      "Rinse well and arrange jars and lids open sides up, without touching, on a tray.",
      "Boil the jars and lids in a large saucepan, covered with water, for 15 minutes.",
      "Use tongs when handling the hot sterilized jars, to move them from boiling water.",
      "Be sure the tongs are sterilized too, by dipping the ends in boiling water for a few minutes.",
      "As a rule, hot preserves go into hot jars and cold preserves go into cold jars.",
      "All items used in the process of making jams, jellies, and preserves must be clean.",
      "This includes any towels used, and especially your hands.",
      "After the jars are sterilized, you can preserve the food.",
      "It is important to follow any canning and processing instructions included in the recipe and refer to USDA guidelines about the sterilization of canned products.",
      "A viewer, who may not be a professional cook, provided this recipe.",
      "The Food Network Kitchens chefs have not tested this recipe and therefore, we cannot make representation as to the results."
