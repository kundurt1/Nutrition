But if you bought the fresh ones, you need to sprinkle them with 1 cup of cane sugar, let stand for 1 hour and drain the juice. Probably you would also like to make a berry compote in advance. In a small sauce pan mix all the ingredients and bring to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring often until the sugar dissolves. Let berries boil 1-2 minutes and remove from the heat. Set aside to cool. Then you'll need to make a dough. Lightly beat the eggs with a salt and milk. In a large bowl mix flour, egg mixture and water, add more water if needed. Stir with a wooden spoon (you can make the dough in a stand mixer, or with your hands). When it becomes hard to stir, pour sticky dough on a flour surface and continue to knead until it becomes smooth and elastic. Divide the dough into 3-4 parts. Roll each part 1/4 inch thin. Using a 2.5 inch diameter glass cut as much rounds as you can. Fill each round with 3-4 cherries, pull the sides together and seal them with your fingers to form a semicircle. You can decorate your vareniki (dumplings), just press the fork's tines on the edges of vareniki. Place them on a lightly floured board and cover with a kitchen towel. You can also freeze remaining dumplings and store in freezer in ziploc bag for later use. In a large pan bring the water to a boil, add pinch of salt. Add vareniki (not all at one time) and stir with a wooden or plastic spoon to prevent from sticking to the bottom of the pan. Cook over the medium heat until they come to the surface, cook for extra 2-3 minutes and take out into a medium bowl. Add 1 tbsp of butter (left the rest butter for another portion of dumplings) and gently mix. Serve immediately with a berry compote or sour cream. Don't forget to sprinkle with a confectioners sugar!"

      "To make the cake: Adjust rack in lower third of oven; preheat oven to 350 degrees. Sift flour, 3/4 cup sugar and the salt onto a sheet of wax paper; set aside. Using an electric mixer, beat egg yolks with 1/4 cup sugar until thick and pale yellow. Add 1/4 cup water and beat until thickened, about 4 minutes. Set aside. In a clean bowl, using cleaned beaters or the whip attachment, whisk egg whites using a heavy-duty mixer just until frothy. Add cream of tartar; whisk until soft peaks form. Add remaining 1/2 cup sugar in a steady stream, whisking until thicker, stiffer, glossy peaks form - about 2 to 3 minutes. Whisk in vanilla, lemon juice and lemon zest. Pour yolk mixture over whites. Fold together with a rubber spatula. Using a metal spatula, scoop up a third of the flour mixture and sprinkle over mixture; fold in with a rubber spatula. Repeat two more times just until ingredients are incorporated. Gently pour batter into an ungreased 10-inch round tube pan with removable bottom (such as an angel food pan). Level top with a rubber spatula. Bake for 50 to 55 minutes, or until top springs back slightly when lightly touched. Invert pan over a long-necked bottle to cool for about 45 minutes. To remove cake from pan, slip a flexible metal spatula down one side of pan; slowly trace perimeter to release the cake. When sides are free, push up on bottom to release cake. Tilt cake, with removable bottom still attached, and gently tap bottom against counter to loosen cake. Rotate cake, tapping a few more times, until it appears free. Cover cake with a rack, and invert; remove bottom of pan.",
      "To make the coffee crunch: Generously oil a large baking sheet; sift baking soda onto a sheet of wax paper; set nearby. Combine coffee, sugar and corn syrup in a heavy, 4-quart saucepan. Place over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until sugar dissolves. When mixture is clear and begins to boil, increase heat to medium-high; cook until mixture reaches 290 degrees on a candy thermometer. Toward the end of cooking ( 270 to 280 degrees), stir occasionally to prevent mixture from scorching and becoming too foamy). Remove from heat and stir in baking soda (mixture will foam up fiercely). While still foaming, pour out onto oiled baking sheet. Do not spread; let cool undisturbed for at least 1 hour. Crush into very small pieces. (Place between 2 sheets of wax paper and tap or roll with rolling pin.) Store in an airtight container.",
      "To make the frosting: Combine cream, sugar and vanilla in a heavy-duty mixer; beat on high speed until cream holds soft peaks.",

(Alternatively, you can use a food processor.) The butter chunks should vary from pea-size to quarter-size. Drizzle in 5 tablespoons ice water and stir with the spatula. Add another tablespoon or so of ice water if the mixture seems too dry. The dough should not be coming together too much at this point. Next, dump the mixture onto a clean work surface, and using the floured heel of your hand, smear the dough to incorporate. Gather up the dough and do this once or twice more, just until it comes together and you can see streaks of butter throughout. Divide the dough in half and form into 2 loose balls. Wrap them in plastic wrap and press down to flatten the dough into two 1/2-inch thick disks. Refrigerate for a couple of hours or overnight, until well chilled.",

Gradually add egg mixture to remaining sauce. Stir in Sherry and Worcestershire. In a medium bowl, mix together crab, shrimp, sauteed mushrooms and 3/4 cup sauce. Stuff jumbo shells with the seafood mixture. Pour remaining sauce in an 11\" x 7\" baking dish. Arrange filled shells on sauce. Spoon a little of the sauce over each shell. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese. Place in a cold oven. Set temperature control to 350 degrees. Bake 20 minutes. Serve right away."

Heat up the wok, add 1 tablespoon of oil, add in the garlic and then chicken fillet, fry for about 3-4 minutes or until the chicken is cook and put it aside. 3. Wash the wok and heat up the wok again. This time add in about 2 tablespoon and add the chopped onions, stir fry for 1-2 minutes and pour in the eggs in circle , if your wok/frying pan is too small then split egg into 2 parts and cook separately, add in the chicken, mushroom, on the eggs. Be careful not to break or it wont turn out that nice, the secret is the you need more oil so that the eggs wont stick on the wok. 4. Once the egg turn slightly brown, then its cooked. Variation: for seafood foo yung, add in any favourite seafood eg prawns, scallops, fish bites. other type of foo yung is with char siew, mince pork. Basically foo yung if very simple and u can add in any of your favourite food into it but in the restaurant, its pretty standard with either meat, seafood or vegies.

Make a well in the center and pour in the yeast mixture. Stir with a fork or the dough hook to make a shaggy dough. If making the dough by hand, stir vigorously with a wooden spoon to work the gluten for about 5 minutes until the dough is smooth. Then turn onto a lightly floured countertop and knead until the dough is smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes, adding small sprinkles of flour as needed to just keep it from sticking. If you're using a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook, beat on high speed until the dough comes together and slaps the side of the bowl, about 5 minutes, adding up to 1/4 cup/30 grams more flour as needed to create a cohesive ball.",
      "Divide the dough half {for large pizzas} or quarters {for small pizzas} and form into balls. Place each ball of dough in a lightly oiled plastic bag, seal, and refrigerate overnight {it gets more supple as it sits overnight} or up to 3 days {or freeze for up to 1 week}.",
      "Remove the dough from the fridge 2 hours before you plan to cook. Oil two or four bowls {depending on whether you are making two large or four individual pizzas}. Turn each dough ball in the bowl to coat in oil; cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap/cling film. Draw a circle around the top to mark where the dough is now, so you can watch it expand. Set aside in a warm place until doubled, about 2 hours.",
      "Position a pizza stone on the bottom rack of your oven. Preheat the oven to 475\u00b0F/240\u00b0C/gas 9 at least 45 minutes before you plan to bake the pizzas.",
      "Lightly dust a clean countertop and the dough with flour. Press and pat each ball of dough into a rectangle or round. Once you have the basic shape you want, stretch the dough by draping it over the back of your hands and wrists, letting it hang down so gravity does the work. For larger pizzas, aim for a 7-by-12-inch/17-by 30.5-cm rectangle or a 12-inch/30.5-cm round; for individual pizzas, aim for a 6-to-9-inch/15-to-23-cm round or rectangle for smaller pizzas and flatbreads, depending on how thick you like your dough. {Don't worry if it's misshapen.} Cover the dough with a towel until baking.",
      "Generously dust a pizza peel or baking sheet/tray with cornmeal and lay on the dough, shaking the peel or sheet/tray back and forth a little to make sure the dough slides easily.",
      "Chop or slice all the vegetables into small pieces that will cook quickly in the hot oven. Top the pizzas with any topping that needs to be cooked or melted, like cheese, sliced garlic, mushrooms, and small pieces of vegetables that need cooked through{the key is to use a light hand here, since overtopped pizzas tend to turn soggy}, dividing the toppings between all the dough.",
      "Slide the pizza onto the stone {or cook directly on the baking sheet} and bake larger pizzas one at a time, smaller ones two at a time, until puffed, crisp and evenly baked through, about 8 to 10 minutes.",
      "Remove and top with fresh and raw ingredients like shaved corn, sliced tomatoes, fresh basil, arugula/rocket, or sorrel. Shave or grate fresh Parmigiano-Reggiano over the top, drizzle with your best olive oil, and season with salt and black pepper."

      "When the squash is cool enough to handle, use a large spoon to scrape out the pulp. Pulse in a food processor until smooth, or rub through a double-mesh sieve. Measure out 14 ounces (1 3/4 cups) squash puree. Use warm, or refrigerate in an airtight container for up to 1 week.",

Pour into the baked crust, place on an aluminum baking sheet, and bake until the custard has puffed into a gentle dome, about 25 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 350\u00b0F and continue baking until the custard is firm around the edges but still wobbly in the very center, about 25 minutes more (200\u00b0F; 210\u00b0F if the probe touches the crust). Let cool at room temperature until the custard is set, about 2 hours.",

      "From the No-Stress All-Butter Pastry Crust, which can be rolled, shaped, and frozen months in advance, to the Quick Condensed Milk and squash puree, every element of this recipe can be made well ahead, so don't feel as if you need to tackle it all at once.",

I boil it for about 45 minutes, turning it over once somewhere in the middle. When it's done, remove the chicken and put it on a cutting board and start cutting and cleaning the chicken. I usually remove all skin and bones while the chicken is still hot, it's a lot easier. Cut it into small or medium pieces and set aside in a plate.",

It doesn't have to be cold, just not really hot. Using a ladle, remove soup from the big pot and add it slowly to the egg-lemon mixture, beating it with the fork constantly. Repeat this 4-5 times so the mixture starts having the color you've seen. At that point, the mixture should be safe and the egg won't curdle any more. You can then take the whole mixture and add it back into the big soup pot, mixing it with the ladle while you reheat the soup a little. Try to stop short of boiling it again, cause it will start to curdle the egg. It just needs a little heat, 3 or 4 minutes or so. At this stage, you can add some of the chicken pieces back in, or just save them to add whenever you reheat some soup. You can also add some more lemon juice and salt and pepper."

Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer, covered, stirring occasionally, until the apples are tender, about 20 minutes. Drain the apples and reserve 1/4 cup of the liquid. Set aside.",
      "Position the racks in the upper-middle and lower-middle of the oven and preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F. Coat two baking sheets with cooking spray.",
      "In a medium bowl, whisk the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together. In a large liquid measuring cup, whisk together the buttermilk and vanilla.",
      "In large bowl, with an electric mixer at medium-high speed, beat the butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Reduce the speed to medium-low and add the molasses, beating until incorporated. Add the eggs one at a time and mix until incorporated. Gradually add the buttermilk (the mixture will look curdled); add the flour mixture and mix until a soft dough forms-it should look like cookie dough. Remove the dough from the bowl, pat into a round, cover in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for 20 minutes.",
      "Divide the dough into 6 equal portions, about 8 1/2 ounces each. On parchment paper, roll portions of dough into circles about 1/4 inch thick. Use an 8-inch cake pan as a guide to trim into uniform 8-inch circles. Bake one circle on each prepared sheet until golden brown, 10 to 12 minutes, rotating and switching the baking sheets halfway through baking. Transfer the circles to cooling racks and let cool completely. The cakes will harden and set as they cool. Repeat with remaining dough. Reroll scraps to form a seventh layer.",
      "Place the first layer on a serving plate and spread with 1/4 cup of the apple butter. Arrange one-sixth of the cooled cooked apples on top of apple butter and top with another layer of cake. Repeat with the remaining filling and cake layers, ending with a cake layer on top. Wrap the cake tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate until the layers soften, at least 12 hours and up to 2 days.",
      "In a small saucepan, combine the brown sugar, reserved apple cider mixture, and the molasses. Bring to a low boil over medium-high heat and cook until the sugar is dissolved, about 2 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the butter until smooth. Let cool for 5 minutes, then pour the glaze over the top of the cake. Slice and serve, or store the cake, covered, at room temperature for up to 3 days."

Place each onion in a packet of foil made from 2 layers of regular or one layer of extra thick foil. Slice in the center about halfway down the length of the onion and fill the \"valley\" you've created with a generous pat of (good.. if you can) butter. Feel free to let the butter and spices seep outside the boundary of the \"valley\" and pile a little on top of the onion. Salt and pepper the onion to taste and if you have a complementary herb such as rosemary or sage, add that. If you want to go fancy, use cippolini onions. They are small Italian onions and they caramelize well with this treatment. They're a little more time consuming to peel because they are so small and they're harder to find and more expensive. But they're worth it if you want a really impressive side dish. Or if you're just craving them which you will.",

Gently stir about 1/3 of the egg whites into the chocolate mixture to combine and lighten the batter. Fold the remaining whites into the batter.",
