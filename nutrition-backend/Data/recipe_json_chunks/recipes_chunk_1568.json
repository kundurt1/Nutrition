      "Preheat oven to 325 degrees F.",
      "This recipe makes a large cheesecake. Generously butter either a 10\" spring-form pan or a 3\"x10\" cake pan. Line the bottom with parchment, then butter the parchment. This will make it easier to remove after it is cooked. If using a spring-form pan, completely wrap the bottom and up to 1 1/2 \" of the outside of the pan with foil. Set pan inside a larger pan or pot with at least 1\" of clearance.",
      "Blend the cream cheese and sour cream in a mixer. Add the sugar, lemon juice, vanilla, salt, and cornstarch. Mix well on medium speed. Add the melted butter and blend. Add the eggs one at a time, on medium speed, scraping down the sides of the bowl about half-way through. Pour the mixture into the buttered pan. Carefully add 1\" of boiling water into the outside pan (i.e. the pan that your springform is sitting in - to form a water bath).",
      "Bake at 325 degrees F for about 1 hour or just until set. Check after the first 30 minutes. If it is getting too brown, spray a piece of foil with spray oil and tent it over the top of the cake and continue baking. At the one hour point, turn off the oven, remove foil tent, open the oven door slightly, and let cheesecake set for 30 minutes. Then remove it from the oven and refrigerate for several hours (or overnight is even better) before removing cake from pan.",
      "To easily remove cheesecake from the pan, warm the bottom of the pan just slightly by either dipping it into warm water for a few seconds or, if you have an electric stove, put it on the coil on low for about 5-10 seconds. Cover the top of the cake with plastic wrap, (unclamp and remove the sides if using a spring-form pan) and flip it upside down onto a plate. Then place a 9\" cardboard cake round on the bottom and flip it right-side up. Slice and serve plain and naked, or with your favorite fresh fruit, lemon curd, chocolate sauce or a sauce made from warmed preserves.",
      "My trick for cutting a cheesecake: Trim a wooden 3/4\" dowel to about 3 inches long. Drill a hole through the middle with the smallest drill bit you can find or hammer a nail through it and remove the nail. String about 2 feet of lightweight (30-pound test) fishing line through the middle and around the dowel and tie a knot. Place the cheesecake on a smaller pan so that it is elevated. Take the dowel in one hand, and wrap the excess line in the other hand. Position the fishing line over the center of the cheesecake and bring it straight down through the cheesecake. Then, pulling from the dowel side, draw the fishing line through and out. It should make a nice, sharp cut. Rotate the cheesecake 90 degrees, and make another cut perpendicular to your first cut. Cut each of the quarters into either thirds or quarters (depending on big you want your slices). I find twelfths are a good serving size. I find this method much easier than using a knife."

Put the lemon peels in the glass jar and add the Everclear. (You could substitute the Everclear for cheap 80 proof vodka, but the Everclear is best because it has no sugar in it.) Make sure that there is at least a two-inch space below the top rim of the jar. Seal tightly.",
      "Note: you are just using the lemon peels for this recipe. Make lemonade or something else with all of those remaining lemons!",
      "Leave the lemon peels to steep in the jar in a cool, dark place until the peels lose their color, about 2-3 months. This will make the lemoncello extra yummy. Every few weeks you can swirl the liquid in the jar but it isn't necessary.",
      "After the 2-3 months have passed, make a simple syrup. Put the water and the sugar in a saucepan. A 1:1 ratio of sugar to water makes a classic simple syrup, but use more sugar if you want a thicker or sweeter liqueur. Stir the sugar and slowly heat until the water turns clear and all the sugar has dissolved completely. Let the syrup cool and place the cooled syrup in the jar with the Everclear and lemon peels. Depending on the size of your jar, you may have to divide the batch into two jars at this point. Put the jars back in a cool dark place for about a month.",
      "After a month, strain out the lemon peels through a coffee filter or cheesecloth and pour the lemoncello into another container. Press down to remove all the liqueur and oils from the peels before tossing them in the trash. Stir the liquid with a clean plastic or wooden spoon. Put the liqueur in clean bottles, seal tightly and leave the finished bottles for at least a week before using.",
      "Store in the freezer."

Put a thin slice of lemon on the edge of the glass for garnish. In a cocktail shaker or a quart jar with a lid, add one cup of crushed ice and enough drink mixture to fill the shaker to 2/3 full. Seal the shaker and shake vigorously for 2-3 minutes, or until freezing cold. Pour into shot glasses, straining out the ice and being careful not to ruin your sugar rims. They're best cold, so \"bottoms up!\"",
      "This recipe makes approximately one quart of lemon drop mix, or enough for 12 shot glasses. Leftover mix can be stored in the freezer in a sealed container or kept in the fridge until you're ready for another round. You can also mix up your lemon drops in advance and store them in the freezer. Before you are ready to serve, just allow the mix to thaw until it's no longer slushy but still very cold.

Dredge lightly in sugar and let dry on a wire rack for at least a couple of hours, but best results are after 24 hours. When working with the gumdrop, use a dampened paper towel to moisten your fingers, this will help prevent the candy from sticking to your fingers. You can combine different colors of gumdrops, to make new colors; like red and white for pink petals. Another technique is to press a small amount of one color, to the side of a larger ball of a different color. This creates the look of a petal with different color strokes."

      "The nice thing about this recipe is that it can be as simple or as complex as you want. The number of layers, types of filling and the amount of filling can all be customized. Want to add a layer of jam, fruit, or chocolate with the cream? What about a yummy layer of bananas next to the cream? Want to just use sweetened whipped cream as the filling, or just pudding? It is totally up to you! However they are made, they are sure to be both delicious and impressive!",

      "Directions For Pastry:",
      "1. Defrost puff pastry according to package directions and pre-heat oven to 400F.",
      "2. Cut each strip of puff pastry into 3 pieces, and pierce with a fork.",
      "3. Place pieces of pastry on parchment lined cookie sheet, place another sheet of parchment on top, and top with second cookie sheet. Make sure your top cookie sheet can nest inside the bottom cookie sheet, the point is to keep the puff pastry flat. Bake for 15-20 minutes on center rack. Watch bottoms so they don't over-brown.",
      "4. Cool pastry pieces on wire rack until completely cool. Then place in groups of 3, and split each piece in half. You'll make 2 napoleons from the resulting 6 halves. Repeat for all pieces.",
      "5. For all designated top pieces, combine confectioner's sugar and water, and brush or pipe the glaze onto the tops.",
      "6. Stripe melted chocolate across the tops and make a pattern on tops with a toothpick dragged perpendicularly across the chocolate lines in alternating directions. Let tops dry.",
      "Directions For Filling and Assembly:",
      "1. Beat softened cream cheese and condensed milk together until fluffy and well combined. Fold in Cool Whip. Set aside.",
      "2. In separate (large) bowl, whip the pudding mix, heavy cream and milk until stiff peaks form.",
      "3. Fold cream cheese mixture into pudding mixture and fold until well combined.",
      "4. Starting from the bottom pastry, pipe filling into Napoleon, press middle pastry gently into the bottom layer of cream, and repeat for the top layer.",
      "5. If desired, wrap wax paper around the outside of the Napoleon for storage",
      "6. Store in the fridge.",
      "HINTS AND TIPS:",
      "What makes this post a particularly easy one is that the most labor intensive part, the puff pastry, is already done. Pepperidge Farm sells a wonderful frozen puff pastry that is relatively easy to work with, all you have to do is let it defrost at room temperature for about forty minutes. Then, you can gently unfold the pastry. When you do so, you will have 3 long strips of dough that are mostly separated. For the Napoleons, I generally cut each of these strips into 3 smaller pieces, yielding 9 pieces per package, and 18 per box since there are two packs of dough per box. I made 2 boxes worth of puff pastry since I was bringing this into an office party, but you can always halve the recipe and make only one box, depending on what you want them for. You can also cut each strip into only 2 pieces, which I have done in the past...but then the Napoleons will be HUGE. I've learned from experience that no one will take them when they are that huge, everyone tries to cut them in half and makes a general mess of things. So, my advice is to go ahead and use 3rds, because it will save a lot of grief in the long run.",
      "After you have cooked them and once the pastries are completely cooled, I always match and stack them. Choose 3 pieces of roughly equal size, and stack them together, and repeat until all of the pieces are grouped by 3's. If you split the pieces as per the directions below, each stack of 3 pieces will represent 2 napoleons by the time you are done, and will ensure that the layers are all roughly the same size.",
      "Now that you have your stacks ready to go, you can start splitting each piece in half to get 2 thinner layers. Each stack will yield 6 halves (3 bottoms, 3 tops), which you can group into 2 3-layer Napoleons. Repeat this for all the pieces, and have the Napoleon groups ready to go. Occasionally, the centers will have softer flakes that stick to the knife, like the innards of pate a choux if anyone has made cream puffs before. You can tear out that soft stuff if you want, instead of leaving it dangling in an unsightly way. Remember, the splitting step itself is fungible, and you can adjust it according to your needs. If you want to use thicker pastry, don't split your pieces, and have each stack of 3 become 1 Napoleon (I'd still use a bottom as a top layer to frost, however).",
      "At the bare minimum, each Napoleon will have a top and bottom layer of pastry. To frost the tops, you make a quick confectioner's sugar glaze, and pipe or brush it onto the tops. Before it hardens, stripe melted chocolate in thin lines across the top, and drag a toothpick perpendicularly across the lines in alternating directions to create the distinctive pattern found on the tops of napoleons. You can make your own disposable piping bag for the chocolate (or the glaze for that matter) with a Ziplock bag. If you are doing this for the chocolate, snip off a teeny tiny part of the corner (I mean miniscule!) and you can squeeze out the chocolate in stripes from this, and then just throw the bag away when you are done. These tops can harden while you make your filling.",
      "Now, not gonna lie, this recipe is not difficult at all, but it can take a few hours depending on how many Napoleons you are making. So, if you want, you can stop after the puff pastry is baked and the tops are frosted and store all the pieces (once the tops are dry) covered at room temperature until the next day. If you have a carry along case meant for a rectangular cake, that is ideal since you can leave the pastry stacked into layers.",
      "When I make these, I make the full recipe for the filling, but even if you were short on time and just made the pudding part to fill them, they will still be delicious. I promise. The filling has two parts. The first consists of beating cream cheese and condensed milk until well combined, and then folding in either freshly whipped cream or Cool Whip. Do yourself a favor and have a little taste of the cream cheese/condensed milk mixture before you add whipped cream. Isn't that tasty? It would make a great base for a fruit tart. Just sayin'. The second part is making 2 boxes of French Vanilla pudding with cream and milk, and whipping until stiff. Make the pudding in the biggest bowl you have, because then you fold the cream cheese mixture into the pudding mixture. I was burned once, and I couldn't fit all of my cream cheese mixture in the bowl with the pudding. It wasn't a tragedy, they still tasted great. But forewarned is forearmed, so if you have a big bowl, now's the time to bust it out.",
      "Once everything is combined to your satisfaction, you can fill and layer. I generally do this on a piece of wax paper on the table, since it is easier to slide the Napoleons off the table than trying to pick them up from the sides. I like piping the filling because I have more control, and you can do the same, with or without a tip. I used my 1M tip because I wanted the filling to look semi-fancy, but that isn't necessary. You can also just use a Ziplock bag with maybe a half-inch wide snip off the corner. You start building the Napoleons bottom-up, pressing each pastry layer gently down into the cream as you go. Once you have one assembled, I usually take a strip of wax paper, and wrap it around the outside. Wax paper has a natural curvature because it was stored as a roll, and it is much easier to bend the paper in the direction of this roll as opposed to against it. The wax paper should adhere to the filling as you wrap it around, and then you can slide the Napoleon off the table and gently put it into whatever container you are storing them in. The wax paper also really allows you to pack them into the container, because you don't have to worry about keeping them separated. Store them in the fridge and enjoy at your leisure."

And I realized when I originally posted this recipe I had halved the amounts needed for 12 mason jar cheesecakes so I have updated them to the correct proportions. Oops!",
      "1. In a medium bowl, beat the cream cheese with an electric mixer until it's light and fluffy. Add the egg and mix it in thoroughly. Add the brown sugar, peanut butter and cream. Once those are all combined, stir in the vanilla by hand. Place the cream cheese mixture in the fridge while assembling the rest of the recipe.",
      "2. Preheat the oven as the brownie box suggests (most likely 350\u00b0F) put together the brownie mix according to the box instructions. Fill 10-12 (4 ounce) mason jars about 1/3 full of brownie mix (and put the rest of the batter into greased muffin tins if you wish). Place the mason jars on a cookie sheet and bake them for about 20-25 minutes until there is a crust on top of them but a tooth pick comes out still a little sticky. You don't want them totally cooked through because they will continue to cook with the cheesecake layer. You may want to leave the ones that you have in the muffin tins in the oven for a bit longer, until totally done (according to the timing on the brownie package), because those won't cook any more.",
      "3. Remove the pans from the oven and reduce the oven heat to 275\u00b0F.",
      "4. Because the brownie mix rises, it had a rounded top, so I used a spoon to lightly press it down into a smooth top surface. Spoon about a tablespoon of caramel sauce on top of the brownies in the mason jars.",
      "5. Spoon the cooled cream cheese mixture into a piping bag, or a sandwich bag and cut off the tip. Pipe it on top of the caramel layer until it's slightly lower than the rim of the jar and use a spoon to smooth the top.",
      "6. Place the mason jars in a deep cake pan and fill the pan with water until it reaches about 3/4 of the way up the sides of the mason jars. Carefully put the pan in the oven and bake for an hour and a half. Remove the jars from the water bath and allow to cool.",
      "7. After the jars have cooled, melt some white and dark chocolate discs in individual bowls according to package instructions. Then drizzle the melted chocolates over the top of the cheese cake (or put them in sandwich bags and cut the tip, for a more uniform drizzle). Also drizzle with the remaining caramel.

      "1. In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, add your spooned and leveled flour, salt and sugar.",
      "2. With your mixer on medium to medium-low, add your cold cubed butter, one square at a time. When all the butter has been added you'll want to see a sand-like texture with a few lumps of butter the size of peas.",
      "3. Turn your mixer down to low and slowly add your ice water (omitting ice!) little by little until the dough just comes together and starts to pull away from the bowl (DO NOT OVERMIX). Depending on where you live and the weather the day you do this, your water amount could possibly change. You may need a little more, maybe a tiny less. Just add a little at a time until you achieve desired look. As soon as it does this, STOP mixing! You can easily over mix, which will result in a less flaky crust.",
      "4. Pull dough out of bowl onto a floured surface and gently pat together into a ball. Wrap with plastic wrap and chill in your refrigerator for 15-20 minutes.",
      "5. When the dough has chilled, pull out of fridge and roll out on a floured surface until you have a circle about 1/8\"-1/4\" thick. Using a 2.5\" circle cutter, cut out 24 circles. Take your (24-count) mini muffin or cupcake pan and push circles of dough down into tins using end of dowel (or your fingers). Do not line the pan with liners. You do not need to grease pan either. I added little mini liners after the pies had baked and cooled for a fancy effect. If you're nervous, you can very lightly grease the pan but make sure it's light. Make sure to really press dough down into the bottom of tins! This will make a flat bottom and allow the pies to sit on a counter or platter by themselves.",
      "6. Once all the circles of dough are in the tins, set the pan in the fridge to chill while you prepare the filling.",
      "To make pie filling:",
      "1. Preheat oven to 350 F.",
      "2. In a bowl mix together tiny squares of apples, vanilla sugar, brandy, vanilla extract, lemon zest, cinnamon, allspice, cloves, nutmeg and salt.",
      "3. Spoon about 2 teaspoons of filling into the dough cups (or until filling reaches top of dough) and top with tiny dollop of unsalted butter.",
      "* Optional: Left over dough? Make little lattices! These are totally yummy with no crust on the top, as well! Or you could even make some crumb topping and top with that instead!",

      "1) Chicken: (I made this as part of the recipe and it accounts for the longer cooking time, which otherwise would be about 10-15 minutes if you already have some precooked chicken or a can of it). Simmer 1/2 of a chicken breast in chicken stock (I used stock cubes) for 30 minutes. Take out and shred with two forks. (This method resulted in dry chicken for me, I'd prefer to use leftovers but I didn't have any.)",
      "2) Spray a saucepan with cooking spray/olive oil. Saute onion briefly on medium heat until lightly browned. Remove most of the onion leaving a tablespoon or so in the saucepan.",
      "3) Add pearl cous cous to saucepan and turn heat up to medium-high and saute for a few minutes until there are a few brown spots on the cous cous.",
      "4) Add cup of boiling water to the saucepan along with a small amount of chicken stock (I used a couple spoons out of the chicken cooking water) and cover. Turn down the heat until it's just simmering. Stir every couple minutes and make sure to check it often! Pearl cous cous can absorb the liquid very quickly and it starts to stick as soon as there is no excess water in the saucepan. It should take about 5 minutes and will be nicely chewy/al dente when done.",
      "5) When cous cous is almost done (nearly all water absorbed) add butter and oil to a frying pan on medium-low to medium heat. Saute onions and broccoli for 2-3 minutes until broccoli is bright green and just cooked.",
      "6) Mix sauce ingredients (except honey), dissolving corn flour. (I used double of both the sugar and the honey, but others may prefer less sweet than me.) Pour into frying pan with onion and broccoli. Stir for 1-2 minutes until thickened. Then add honey and stir.",
      "7) Add cous cous and shredded chicken to frying pan and stir until evenly coated with sauce.",
      "8 ) Dig in! Sauce will taste more like honey initially, but will thicken further and taste more lemony after serving."

      "I used the maple syrup because I prefer using natural sweeteners versus refined ones, and up North here it's super easy to come by. However, the maple flavor is not at the forefront here. With tapioca, you want good vanilla to be the dominant flavor.",
      "When I made this, I added the maple syrup to my beaten egg whites (thus the pretty caramel hue). As I note in the recipe, I would probably switch this around the next time and add the maple syrup to the egg yolks and the sugar to the whites. But that's just me bein' picky...",
      "I love to eat this warm, with fruit. But if you want more of a pudding dessert, you can certainly chill it for a while and it becomes nice and chiffon-like. If you want to serve this as a simple dessert, you must top it with softly whipped cream!"

When the liquid boils, add the pasta and reduce the heat to medium-high. Keep at a low boil (higher than a simmer) for about 12 minutes, uncovered, until the pasta is cooked (this cooking time should also finish softening the carrots).",

For chickpeas: heat olive oil in a small to medium skillet over high heat (the amount of oil depends on how many peas you're frying-definitely cover the surface of the pan, with a little tiny bit extra). Roll the reserved chickpeas between layers of paper towel to absorb all their surface moisture. Add them to the pan, stirring to coat with oil, then let them sit undisturbed for several minutes to crisp up and turn brown. Roll them around in the pan every few minutes.

When done, remove them with a slotted spoon to a paper towel-lined plate, and sprinkle with salt and pepper while still warm.",

If the bread is still soft and fresh, dry the cubes out on a sheet pan in a 275F oven for a bit before you fry them. Reheat the oil that is left in the pan from the chickpeas until very hot.

If you fry the bread in batches, add more oil as necessary.",

      "At this time heat 2 - 4 cups of water in your microwave until almost boiling (1.5 to 2 minutes). Also, go ahead and turn on your crock pot (I used my 6 quart oval) to high. This is going to preheat it while you're making the filling.",
      "In a large bowl add the 16 ounces of cream cheese and using mixer, mix until fluffy. Slowly add in the can of sweetened condensed milk. Once that's incorporated add one egg at a time. Once the eggs are mixed in thoroughly add the vanilla extract and lemon zest. Mix until well incorporated.",
      "This is a VERY important step in the process. Fill the jars with EQUAL amounts of cheesecake filling. This is so important because you want all the cheesecakes to cook evenly. If you fill one a little more than the others, use a teaspoon to dip out of one jar and add to another until they are filled as equally as possible.",
      "Carefully pour the hot water into the preheated crock pot. Place the jars in the crock pot making sure that none are touching the edges of the crockery or each other. You're looking for the water to come up 1/2 - 3/4 of the way up on the jars.",
      "Cover crock pot with lid and cook on high for 1 - 2 hours. Mine were done at exactly 1 hour and 10 minutes. You're gong to look for the filling to firm up and not be jiggly in the center. These cooked so quickly because they were cooking in individual, smaller containers.",
      "At this point take the crock pot lid off (pick it straight up, don't tilt it sideways... you don't want any condensation from lid dropping onto the top of the cheesecakes) and turn the crock pot off. You don't want to try to remove the jars until they cool down some. (No one wants to get burned and blistered.... not even for cheesecake!).",
      "Once the jars have cooled enough to remove them from the crock pot, place them on a dish towel to continue cooling. As they cool you will see the filling pull away from the sides of the jars. When they completely cool down (and ONLY when completely cooled) place the lid and rims on the jars and place in the fridge for at least 4 hours. This step gives the flavors a chance to come through.... don't skip it, trust me! Oh yeah, if you happen to have any leftover, make sure you keep those refrigerated until you're ready to eat them.",

      "Squish the crust into the pie plate as if it were a tart pan (this is easier, admittedly, if it's not chilled). OR - my preferred plan - roll the dough out onto a Sil-Pat OR a piece of parchment OR a piece of aluminum foil and then flip that onto the pie plate. You can do this either by placing the pie plate upside down on top of the rolled out dough then flipping the whole thing over or by flipping the parchment or Sil-Pat or foil over onto the pie plate and then peeling it carefully off. Then you can coax the crust into the pie plate and trim as usual. Same goes for the top crust.",
      "8. Then, you just fill the bottom crust with the berry filling, throw the top crust on and decorate as you like. I like to use a little egg wash or brush the top with some preserves to encourage it to brown, and then either top with shapes cut out of the extra dough (as pictured) or sprinkle some sanding sugar.",
      "9. Also, be sure to vent your crust if it's a solid one. Also, put your pie on a sheet pan before putting it in the oven - you may overflow! Bake for 45ish minutes at 400F. Keep an eye on it - you can always kick it up to 425F if your crust is slow to brown.",
      "10. **Note: My pie was very runny, which is just how I like it. It had solidified a bit by the next day (the slice pictured), but if you want it to be sturdier, use more tapioca. It won't change the flavor."

Dice two sticks of very cold butter and spread it over the flour mixture. Mix the butter into the flour using a pastry cutter, or pulsing the mix in a food processor. Stop when the butter is the size of small peas - this is what makes your crust flaky and delicious! Then drizzle water - about 1/2 cup to start, into the mix, and gather the dough together. You will probably need more ice water to get the dough to form a ball, but add small amounts at a time! When the mixture can be formed into a ball, make two balls of dough and cover with plastic wrap. Chill in the fridge for at least 1 hour.",

      "Begin by heating a large, non-stick skillet on medium heat. Add the oil, and toss in the garlic, cooking and stirring until fragrant. Next, add in the celery and carrots. Give a good stir, and cook for a few minutes. You want them to soften slightly but want some of the crunch. Add in the uncooked chorizo, and begin breaking it up, cooking along the way. The chorizo will begin releasing its fat as it cooks, and this is perfect as we will use this to assist us in cooking and crisping up that rice. The chorizo should take about 5 minutes or so to cook. Continue breaking up any pieces of chorizo.",
      "Add in the butter, and let that begin to melt. This will not only add great flavor to the rice, and I think is a secret weapon when it comes to making fried rice, but it also crisps up the rice. Add in the eggs, and let them cook, breaking it up as it cooks. As the butter melts and the egg cooks, add in the rice, breaking it up with your wooden spoon. Flip, toss, stir. Do you kitchen magic. Impress those around you with those flips of the wrists. Mix everything, that is your goal. As you incorporate all of the veggies, chorizo and butter into the rice, it will begin to crisp up and make an amazing rice. Add salt and pepper to taste. You are ready to serve.",
      "Feel free to plate in a large serving bowl for the table, or individual bowls. My son loved it, and loved it so much he requested another large bowl of it. I can't blame the kid for loving this fried rice. It's got everything you would love with a fried rice. It replaces the standard soy sauce with the chili and paprika notes from the Mexican chorizo. If you are looking for something to use in your fried rice recipe, give this one a shot."
