Place the butter sheet on one half and cover and press the edges with the other side of the dough. Make sure the butter is soft enough for you to fold, but not so warm is tries to escape. Fold one end 1/4 the length towards the center and do the same on the opposite side, followed by folding that in half one more time to create a book like shape (See image for visual guide). Once done, wrap tightly in plastic wrap and place in the fridge overnight.",
      "In the morning carefully roll out the dough book into an 8-inch-by-14-inch shape and repeat the folding process (refrigerating one hour between each fold). Do this at least 3-4 times. The more you do this the flakier and more layered your croissant will be.",

Squeeze lemon halves all over turkey, top and bottom, as well as in the cavity. Add apple, onion, lemon halves, and herbs to the cavity. Gently loosen skin from breast and rub breast generously with butter, as well as outside of turkey. Season with salt and pepper, then truss turkey, pinning back wings.",

Set aside for 15 minutes, allowing the garlic oil to drip through the holes you've made in the cheese. (You can marinate it in the refrigerator for longer, even overnight. If doing so, cover with plastic wrap before refrigerating).",

Once BBQ is heated, place the cheese-pan on the grill, being sure that it is over indirect heat (i.e., that the heat is not directly below the pan). Put the cover of the BBQ down. If using oven: Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F Once oven is preheated put in the pan of cheese.",

      "It's nearly impossible to move the brie onto a serving plate once it's soft and gooey, therefore I used a 6\" cast iron skillet and served directly from it. Place the pan of cheese on top of a heat-proof pot holder or trivet. Warn Guests: Pan is HOT. Serve with slices of French bread and/or water crackers. Red grapes would be a nice addition, too."

      "Fold the cheese as it progressively melts so that the cubes on top can contact the heated bottom.",
      "Once the cheese has fully melted, assess the consistency to determine whether to raise the heat. If the cheese has fully melted, but is VERY thick and hard to stir, turn up the heat a bit (constantly stirring and folding) to melt it further. It should be creamy but not stiff.",

Use a large serving spoon to break up the cream cheese into smaller bits as it gets softer. When your stick of butter is about half melted, turn the pan off! The residual heat from the pan will keep melting your butter and cream cheese while your noodles boil. It is important to shut the pan off because the cream cheese can burn quite easily.",

It wont melt down entirely, so don't try to cook it too long! The cream cheese and butter won't mix together very well, but this is normal. Now, grab your half and half and add 1/4 to a 1/2 cup in the pan and stir well. Add your parmesan cheese (you can always add more or less to your taste) and stir that in really well until melted. By this time, your sauce will have thickened up quite a bit. Add more half and half little by little until you get the consistency you desire. Dump in your noodles, mix well. You may have to add a bit more half and half at this point to keep it from getting too thick. Last but not least, add your choice of meat into the pan, stir well and turn the temperature to low. Cover, and simmer for 3 to 5 minutes, stirring occasionally to keep the cream cheese and butter mixed together as much as it can.",

      "1. Position rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F Grease and flour with millet flour a 9-inch springform pan.",
      "2. In a medium bowl, whisk together the millet flour, almond flour, baking powder and salt until thoroughly combined and set aside.",
      "3. In large mixing bowl, whisk the eggs lightly to break up the yolks.",
      "4. Add the sugar to the bowl and whisk thoroughly in both directions for about 30 seconds.",
      "5. Add the olive oil and whisk until the mixture is a bit lighter in color and has thickened slightly, about 45 seconds.",
      "6. Whisk in the extracts and zest, followed by the orange juice.",
      "7. Add the dry ingredients to the bowl and whisk until thoroughly combined. Continue whisking until you have a smooth, emulsified batter, about 30 more seconds.",
      "8. Pour the batter into the springform pan and bang down the pan a few times to level the batter.",
      "9. Place the pan on the center rack and bake for 30-45 minutes or until the cake has come away from the sides or the pan. If you press the cake lightly with your finger, it should spring back.",
      "10. Remove the pan from the oven and place it on a cooling rack. Cool the cake in the pan for 10 minutes before running a butter knife all around the cake and removing the outer ring.",
      "For the glaze:",
      "1. In a small, heavy saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. When the bubbles subside (5 to 10 mins.), lower the heat and watch the butter carefully, swirling it in the pan occasionally to distribute the heat. When the butter begins to turn a light tan color and smells slightly nutty, immediately remove it from heat and let the butter sit. It will continue to darken as it sits. Put it aside to cool.",
      "2. In a medium bowl, sift the confectioner's sugar. Whisk in the milk until completely smooth.",
      "3. Whisk in the butter until thoroughly combined.",
      "4. Add a few drops of lemon juice to balance the sweetness. Your taste and strength of the lemon will determine how much you add but it is about 2 or 3 drops.",
      "To assemble:",
      "1. Spread the glaze onto the top and sides of the cake.",
      "2. Sprinkle the almonds generously on the top of the cake.",
      "3. Let the cake sit until set and dry and serve."
