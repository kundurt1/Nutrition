      "The thick, inedible skin on the top and bottom of the wing is removed to expose a wide, thin slab of sectioned flesh.",
      "Actually, there are two layers of flesh, with a middle layer of thin cartilage that extends out to the edge of the wing.",
      "What you are most likely to find in the supermarket are pieces of skate filletwing meat already sliced from the cartilage.",
      "You can see the narrow ridges and grooves where the branches of cartilage were attached.",
      "When they are fresh, skate fillets are fine for this recipe.",
      "But if you have a fish market where they get the whole wings, I recommend that you have the fishmonger remove only the skin and leave the skate still on the cartilage.",
      "There are several advantages: skate pieces with cartilage taste better than fillets, just like meat cooked on the bone; the pieces are sturdier and can cook longer with other seasonings in the pan, the cartilage lending flavor and body to your brodetto.",
      "Finally, if you are an omnivore, as I am, you will find that most of the wing cartilage (except for one tough edge) is a delicious treat to chew on.",
      "And its good for you, too!",
      "Freshness is more critical with skate than with other fish, because the flesh begins to deteriorate and gives off an ammonia smell within a day or two after the wing has been skinned, faster when it has been filleted.",
      "This is another reason its best to find a market where they get the whole wing and you can see it with the skin on, before you buy it.",
      "Fresh skate will smell like the clean sea.",

      "Note: I prefer the old-fashioned fingertip option, but take care not to overhandle the dough, because it will become difficult to work withwhen dough is overhandled, the Crisco becomes too incorporated.",
      "In the perfect pie, the Crisco will have a marbleized look, and you will actually be able to see Crisco swirls within the uncooked dough.",
      "Add the ice-cold water, 1 tablespoon at a time, delicately incorporating each tablespoon into the flour mixture before you add the next.",
      "You may have to use 1 more or 1 less tablespoon of water than the amount recommended, depending upon the humidity in your kitchen at the time of baking.",
      "You will know you have added just the right amount of water when the dough forms a ball that easily holds together.",
      "Wrap the ball of dough with plastic and place it in the refrigerator to chill for at least 30 minutes.",
      "Once the dough has chilled, divide the ball in half.",
      "You now have enough dough for either one 9- or 10-inch double crust (1 pie shell and 1 top crust) or two 9- or 10-inch single crusts (pie shell only).",
      "If you are making a single-crust pie, you will use only one half of the dough per pie.",
      "Wrap the remaining half in plastic and reserve it in the refrigerator for future use; the dough can be reserved in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.",
      "Alternatively, you can make a second single-crust pie, wrap it tightly in plastic wrap, and freeze it for future use; it will keep for up to 1 month.",
      "A number of recipes in this book call for prebaked or partially baked pie shells for the single crust pies.",
      "Follow these directions before adding desired filling.",
      "Preheat the oven to 425F.",
      "To prepare the pie shell, divide the ball of dough in half, setting one half to the side.",
      "On a clean, lightly floured work surface, roll out the dough with a rolling pin until it forms a 10-inch circle.",
      "Fold the circle in half, place it in the pie plate so the edges of the circle drop over the rim, and unfold the dough to completely cover the pie plate.",
      "Crimp the edges of the pie shell by using the index finger of one hand to push the inner edge of the crust out, while using the thumb and index finger of your other hand to push the outer edge in.",
      "Brush heavy cream over the crimped edges to create a perfect, golden brown finish.",
      "Line the bottom of the crust with parchment paper and place pie weights (see page xvii) on top to ensure the edges do not fall into the shell while the crust is baking.",
      "For prebaked pie shells, bake the crust at 425F on the middle rack of the oven (see page 24) for 15 to 20 minutes, or until a golden brown color is achieved.",
      "Before removing the shell from the oven, make sure that the crust under the parchment paper has turned a golden brown.",
      "For partially baked pie shells, follow the instructions as outlined above, but bake the pie shell for only 10 minutes so the crust only just begins to bake.",
      "(Note: Partially baked pie shells will be used for pies that have quick-bake fillings, such as Key Lime Pie, page 120.)",
      "When making crusts and toppings, its important that the Crisco, butter, and water are cold at the time of preparation.",
      "A flaky crust texture is created when shortening and butter remain cool enough that they dont melt into the other ingredients throughout the preparation process.",
      "Put ice cubes in the water to ensure that its as cold as possible; Crisco and butter should be refrigerated prior to use.",
      "When using pie weights, cut a piece of parchment paper into a square shape and place it on top of the pie shell.",
      "Next, place the pie weights (see page xvii)distributing them evenlyon top of the parchment paper."
