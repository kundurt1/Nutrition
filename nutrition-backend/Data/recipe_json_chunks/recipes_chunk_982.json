    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "COMMANDMENT #1: Only Select Great Chocolate. Only use chocolate you like the taste of (which allows you plenty of latitude!). Good chocolate will appeal to all of your senses, and if the brand you are eating and cooking doesn't excite your taste, smell, touch, sight and hearing, switch brands. When deciding on what chocolate to choose, taste and smell are important. The chocolate should feel firm and supple, look glossy and smooth, and break with a pleasing \"snap.\".",
      "COMMANDMENT #2: Never Neglect Ganache. Ganache is the magical amalgamation of chocolate and cream. It is both the chocolatier's workhorse and fairy godmother. When heated, it's a sauce or a glaze; when cooled it's a truffle or a frosting.",
      "COMMANDMENT #3: Always Reinvent Your Cookies. Change up chocolate chip cookies with white or milk chocolate chunks or chips. Oh, and most cookies are better if you drizzle them with melted chocolate.",
      "COMMANDMENT #4: Don't Turn Your Nose Up at the Microwave. I almost always melt chocolate in the microwave these days. It's ready when the liquid pool appears soft and shiny.",
      "COMMANDMENT #5: Store Your Chocolate Wisely. Store chocolate in a cool, dark place. Make sure it's well wrapped. The refrigerator is not the best place to store chocolate because of the humidity.",
      "COMMANDMENT #6: More is Best. Never hesitate to cut brownies into larger squares than the recipe indicates.",
      "COMMANDMENT #7: Stay Away From Hot Cococa Mix. When a recipe calls for cocoa powder, remember it means unsweetened cocoa powder (not hot cocoa mix!).",
      "COMMANDMENT #8: When You Make Truffles-Wear Latex Gloves. They'll keep the ganache from sticking to your warm palms.",
      "COMMANDMENT #9: Adhere to the Golden Rules of Ganache. Rule #1: When you make ganache, always pour the hot cream over chopped chocolate. Never melt the chocolate first. Rule #2: Don't refrigerate hot or even warm ganache or the fat will separate. Let it cool to room temperature first.",
      "COMMANDMENT #10: Don't Substitute Milk Chocolate for Dark Chocolate. The milk solids in milk chocolate are heat sensitive, which is why you can't substitute milk chocolate for dark chocolate in baking recipes.",

      "(If you are making Belgian fries with this http://www.recipezaar.com/288751 do everything including the first cooking of them before you start . it's all in the recipe above).",
      "The first part is to fry up the mushrooms for later , we need em fried to add to the sauce , finely slice the mushrooms , the finer you slice em the more taste they give and the better your dish looks , i would suggest 8 slices per inch . Add about 2 teaspoons worth of butter in a hot pan , let your butter bubble out , when it's all quiet in the pan add the mushrooms and a small pich of salt. Your mushrooms will loose their moisture very quickly , so keep stirring them with a wooden spoon . when they are brown, reduced in size , and the moisture is gone , slide em in a bowl for later use.",
      "Preheat your oven at the lowest setting 120-140\u00b0F (and put your plates in there).",
      "Cooking the steaks . First of all , make sure there is fat on your meat . you don't necessarily have to eat it later , it is necessary for the cooking process . Frying a steak is done in a heavy cast iron frying pan , so if you have one , now is a good time to bring it out. Start by sprinkling some salt and pepper on both sides of the steak . Put 2 teaspoons of butter in your hot (quite high temp , max if cooker is electric) pan , let it quiet down , add in the steak ( it should chirp while putting it in there if it makes no sound your pan isn't hot enough ) well done = 3 minutes per side , 2 for saignant , 1 for bleux . while cooking move the meat around a bit , the fat on the meat should melt and make sure your meat doesn't burn. Put your steaks on a plate in the preheated oven so they can settle (your oven temperature should be low enough so they don't cook any more).",
      "(now is the time to throw in the first batch of fries for the second cooking).",
      "The sauce : Don't clean your pan after cooking ! you need the juices and the gristle in there for your flavor . Add the creme fraiche to your pan , put in the mushrooms you cooked earlier , add a pinch of salt and pepper and _keep stirring_ the sauce (on a high flame) until it is thick and creamy (take your time). Now add the teaspoon of port ( this is essential for the taste , as always when using alcohol in cooking , there is no actual alcohol in your dish , since it will have evaporated by the time you eat) .-your fries should be ready, take the basket out and shake em- Take the steaks out of the oven , put them on individual plates . If there is some juice on the plate you used in the oven , add that to the sauce , stir it in , divide the sauce on top of both steaks. Divide the garden cress onto the 2 plates(if you can't find garden cress , use finely sliced radish). Add Fries to the rest of the plate.",
      "Have a nice meal !",

      "Alternatively, for those who cannot get the quick-cooking version of the rice, I have put the broth on to boil and cooked the 25-minute version of long grain and wild rice blend according to the directions, while sauteeing the veggies in the butter. I tend to cook the veggies longer this way, and I like them quite soft. I then follow the rest of the directions above, adding the rice/broth to the cream mixture. I've also used fat-free half and half with no appreciable difference in flavor. Enjoy!"

      "Saute the onions and butter (and a pinch of salt and pepper) over medium heat, stirring occasionally, for 1-1 1/2 hours, or until onions are soft and caramelized and pretty much all of the liquid has evaporated. It is best to stir the onions only occasionally to encourage proper caramelization and browning.",

      "Ladle soup into serving bowls and top with a slice of toasted french bread and some of the cheese. We really like a blend of Provolone and Gruyere. Swiss would also work here. Place the bowls of soup on a baking sheet and heat until the cheese bubbles and begins to brown in your broiler. Depending on the bowls you choose, you can get about 4 first course or 6 smaller appetizer portions out of one pot. This soup is even better the next day, if you can wait, since the flavors will have more time to meld."
