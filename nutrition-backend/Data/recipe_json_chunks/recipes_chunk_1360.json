      "Now make your black olive sauce by mixing all the ingredients except the vinegar together. You want the sauce to have the consistency of a coarse salsa. Then carefully balance the flavours with the vinegar to taste.",
      "",
      "If you're roasting your monkfish, preheat your oven to 220\u00b0C/425\u00b0F/gas 7 just before the fish comes out of the fridge. Pat the fish dry with some kitchen paper and then pat it with a little olive oil.",
      "",
      "Peel and halve your potatoes. Put them into a pot of salted, boiling water and cook until tender. Then drain and mash up with 6 tablespoons of olive oil and a good swig of milk. Season to taste with salt, pepper and lemon juice. If you want to get your mash really smooth and creamy you can use a spatula to push the potato through a sieve once or twice. It doesn't make it taste any better but it will make it silky smooth, shiny and lovely. Just depends if you can be bothered, really. If it needs thinning with a little extra milk, feel free.",
      "",
      "To roast the monkfish, heat a large ovenproof frying pan, add a splash of olive oil and fry the fillets in the pan for 2 minutes. Then turn them over and put the pan in your preheated oven for 6 to 8 minutes, depending on the thickness of the fillets.",
      "",
      "To grill, place the the butterflied fillets on a hot griddle pan and cook for about 3 minutes on each side, depending on the thickness. Whichever way you cook it serve the fish and the juices with a good dollop of the mashed potato, the black olive sauce and a little rocket dressed with the extra virgin olive oil, lemon juice and salt and pepper. Really, really good."

Add one third of milk-cornstarch mixture to sugar-rum mixture, whisking constantly; pour into same saucepan; cook over medium-high heat, whisking constantly, until pastry cream thickens, about 2 minutes. Pour cream into a shallow dish; set plastic wrap on surface of cream and let cool completely. Tear cake into chunks. In each of four 7-ounce serving glasses, divide and layer half of cake chunks, half of cooled rum cream, and half of dried fruit and nuts; repeat layers.

Add the warm tea and mix in until smooth. Batter is complete when it's thin and very smooth. This is why this cake is so moist! Using a large soup ladle, ladle 3 big spoons of batter into each of your greased pans. Layer in the sliced apples, single or double layer is up to you. I like granny smith because I enjoy the tartness in the sweet cake, but any apple will work. Carefully ladle the remaining batter on top of the apples, be sure that all the apples are covered. Sprinkle generously with sliced or slivered almonds. Bake for 45 minutes - check with a toothpick that it's cooked through- may need more time)."

      "Crush pretzels into small bits. (I tried this first by bashing the pretzels in a baggie. Then I tried chopping them in a food processor. The results were mostly the same, though I felt I had more control with the baggie method.) In a small bowl, combine peanut butter, butter, brown sugar and salt. Stir until all ingredients are completely blended and smooth. Add pretzel bits to peanut butter mixture and mix thoroughly. Add powdered sugar and, again, mix thoroughly. Prepare a chilling tray--a dinner plate covered with waxed paper works well. Take about a teaspoon of the peanut butter pretzel mixture into your fingers and gently pat it into a ball with your fingertips. If the peanut butter starts sticking to your fingers, your fingers are too warm. Run your fingers under cold water for a minute to chill them, and begin rolling again. Place the peanut butter balls onto the plate. When you have rolled all the balls, place the entire plate into the refrigerator to chill for at least 30 minutes. After the peanut butter balls have chilled, prepare your chocolate. Pour the chocolate chips into a small microwaveable bowl. Microwave for 30 seconds and stir. If needed, microwave for another 10 seconds and stir again. Continue until the chips are completely melted, which means they stir easily into smooth, fluid chocolate with no lumps. Place one peanut butter ball into the melted chocolate and gently roll it around with a fork until completely coated. Remove from the bowl with the fork and place back on the waxed paper plate. Repeat for all other balls. Once all the peanut butter balls are coated in chocolate, return the plate to the refrigerator and chill another 30 minutes."

      "*COOKING CHICKEN BREASTS: Pour 6 cups chicken stock, 6 cups lightly salted water, or four 14-oz. cans reduced-sodium chicken broth into a large saucepan with a tight-fitting lid. Bring to a boil and remove from heat. Immediately add the 2 whole chicken breasts, taking care that they are fully submerged, then cover tightly with the lid and let stand off heat for 20 minutes. Check the chicken breasts to be sure they are cooked through by cutting into the thickest part of the breast with a sharp knife (or check for an internal temperature of 170\u00b0 with an instant-read thermometer). If the cut part is pink, cover pan and cook chicken over very low heat for 5 to 10 minutes. Remove cooked chicken from the pan and allow to cool. Save and refrigerate the stock for another use, such as soup.",

    "title": "black forest cake",
    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0. Place the rack in the center of the oven. Butter and flour a 10-inch cake pan that is 3 inches deep such as a springform mold.",
      "Sift the 1/2 cup flour, the cocoa, and the salt together onto a sheet of parchment paper and set aside. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, beat the eggs, sugar, and vanilla at high speed until the mixture has tripled in volume and is very thick, about 8 minutes. When the whisk is lifted, the batter will form a thick ribbon as it falls back into the bowl.",
      "Lower the speed to stir and carefully tap the dry ingredients into the egg mixture. As soon as all the flour has been added to the eggs, stop the machine. Pour in the melted butter, making sure to leave the white, milky solids behind. With a large rubber spatula, using as few strokes as possible, finish folding the flour mixture and butter into the batter until evenly mixed.",
      "Immediately scrape the batter into the prepared pan, place the pan on a baking sheet, and bake until the cake feels just firm to the touch, about 40 minutes. Transfer the cake to a rack and let it cool for about 5 minutes. Then turn the cake upside down onto a rack to cool. This will flatten the slightly domed top.",
      "Place the sugar and 1/2 cup water in a small saucepan over medium-high heat. Bring the mixture to a boil while stirring to dissolve the sugar. Add the kirsch and remove from the heat. Pour the syrup into a small cup or bowl and set it aside.",
      "In a large bowl, whip the cream with the sugar and vanilla on medium-high speed until it holds firm peaks. Do not overbeat; the whipped cream should be smooth and firm. Divide the cream into 4 equal portions and set them aside. (This helps prevent getting to the last bit of decorating and discovering you have run out of cream.) Drain the cherries and divide them into 2 equal piles. Reserve 8 to 12 cherries to garnish the top of the cake if you do not have fresh cherries.",
      "Place the cake on a work surface with its original top up. Trim off any hard crusts. With a long serrated knife, cut the cake horizontally into 3 even layers. Transfer the top layer to a serving plate, arranging it top side down. Brush it liberally with the syrup. With an offset spatula or rubber spatula, smooth on a 1/2-inch layer of whipped cream. Push the cream a little beyond the edge of the cake. (This prevents gaps when you settle the next layer on top.) Nestle half of the cherries into the whipped cream, scattering them evenly over the top.",
      "Place the middle cake layer on top of the cherries, pressing it lightly into the whipped-cream layer. Brush with syrup, spread with whipped cream, and scatter the remaining half of the cherries over the cream.",
      "Finally, add the last cake layer, cut side up, on top of the cherries, again settling it into the whipped-cream layer. Brush with syrup. With an icing spatula or a large rubber spatula, spread a thin layer of whipped cream over the top of the cake. Spread a thicker layer onto the sides.",
      "Pastry shops add a decorative scalloped edge of ground dark chocolate around the base of the cake. Fill your cupped palm with some of the ground chocolate and lift and tilt it onto the base of the cake all around the bottom edge. Rotate the cake between handfulls. It's the heel of your hand that forms the scalloped edge.",
      "Rotate the edge of a sharp knife against the block of chocolate to make curls or cut shavings with a vegetable peeler. Pile them on top of the cake.",
      "Scoop the remaining whipped cream into a pastry bag fitted with a medium star tip. Pipe fat rosettes all around the top edge of the cake. Press a fresh or spirited cherry into the center of each rosette. Refrigerate the cake for at least 4 hours to let the flavors meld. Just before serving, dust the top with powdered sugar.",
      "Use about 24 ounces of preserved sour cherries in syrup. Drain the cherries, reserving the syrup and cherries separately. In a small saucepan, bring to a boil 1/3 cup espresso or strong coffee, the reserved syrup, and 3/4 cup sugar (or to taste), stirring until the sugar dissolves. Remove from the heat and reserve until needed.",
      "For our Christmas menu in 2010, we used Black Forest flavors for our buche de Noel. We baked the genoise as a sheet cake, soaked it with the kirsch syrup, spread it thickly with the whipped cream, and then scattered the cherries over the cream before rolling up the cake. We iced it with the traditional chocolate buttercream. This makes a lighter-than-usual buche, and our guests cleaned their plates."
