      "Most \"raw\" peanuts sold in stores are already rather old, while green peanuts are pulled from the ground within a week. If your koba falls apart or the peanuts remain tough, they were probably on the old side. The addition of peanut oil to the batter is not traditional but helps compensate for old peanuts.",
      "Banana leaves are preferable because they allow steam to pass into the koba, which helps keep it properly moist, creating a dense, smooth, pate-like texture. Tin foil blocks this moisture but requires less practice to wrap tightly.",

Add enough water to just cover the meat (it's ok if it's not completely covered). Bring it to a simmer and let it simmer uncovered for 2 hours. I know you'll be tempted but DO NOT stir or touch the meat during these 2 hours. You should have enough water/juice in the pot that by the end of the 2 hours you will be down to about an inch or less of liquid. When you get to this point turn the heat up to medium high and chop and stir it around until the liquid evaporates and your pork is a mixture of something between chunks and shredded. I like to let it brown up a bit even. That's it, you're done! The best pork ever and the flavor is simple enough that you can do pretty much anything with the meat."

      "Step 2 - Add COLD water to the pot. Hot sink water will contain more impurities than cold sink water. Use a big enough pot that will hold the water and pasta. Make sure it has a large base so that the water will boil faster. This is a pretty easy step.",
      "Step 3 - Bring the water to a fast, raging boil. Also, add a little bit of salt to the water (about 1-2 tablespoons) but don't add any olive oil! This will season the pasta as well as quicken the time for the water to boil.",

So keep testing your pasta every minute from here on out. The entire time to cook should probably it between 8 to 12 minutes.",
      "Step 7 - Once the pasta is \"al dente,\" remove it from the heat and drain it immediately into a colander to stop the cooking process. If you wait too long, your pasta will over cook and become too mushy. If for some strange, unforeseen reason, you can't immediately do this, add about 1/2 to 1 cup of cold water to the pot. This will lower the temperature enough to stop the cooking.",
      "Step 8 - Don't over drain the pasta, it should still remain moist. Also, NEVER RINSE OFF THE PASTA! Unless the recipe calls for it. After you have drained the pasta, return it to the pot or a pan and add whatever sauce you made to it. This will keep the pasta from sticking together.",

Check after about 30 minutes; chicken should be cooked through but not falling off the bone. * For short-grain rice in the IP, for every cup of rice, use 1 1/2 cups liquid. * You could also cook the rice in a rice cooker; follow rice cooker instructions for proportions of rice and liquid for type of rice. * To substitute for the shaoxing wine, you could use pale dry sherry. For a nonalcoholic alternative, try apple juice or white grape juice; add it before the sugar, then add sugar to taste, so the sauce doesn't become too sweet."

      "Take an small pot such as an small washed empty yogurt pot or egg cup and put in about a medium teaspoon of chunky orange marmalade. Add a bit of boiling or hot water and stir to make a medium thick paste.",

      "Measure the porridge oats - I suggest 57g as a good sized portion into a saucepan. I tested this to work out to be pretty much exactly 4 Tablespoons extremely well heaped (- or about 1/4 cup apparently). I'm on a calorie-controlled diet and this is just enough for me to enjoy without feeling either underfed or too heavy - but you may prefer more or less and adjust the other ingredients accordingly.",
      "Add 345ml water (about 1 1/2 cups)- or enough to be absorbed to your satisfaction. Water weighs 1g per ml so you can weigh in 345g if you have electronic scales.",
      "Add just a couple of small drops vanilla flavouring - I prefer the articifial one as it's got a much stronger flavour - if you use real vanilla essence you may need about 1/3 Teaspoon because it's so much weaker. (Note: calorie wise, artificial vanilla has 50 Kcal/100ml versus 600 Kcal/100ml for real vanilla essence!).",
      "Add about 1/3 teaspoon of Ground Ginger (to taste) - quite a lot is really good! - but breakfast time cravings vary about as much as personal tastes :).",
      "Add about 1/3 teaspoon caraway seeds (to taste - or leave them out if you don't really like caraway seeds).",
      "Place on stove and boil and simmer until just the consistency you like.",
      "When just about thick enough, add 2 medium teaspoons of Splenda(R), or granulated sweetener or sugar (or as much/little as suits your taste) and stir it in well.",

      "Add the prepared, diluted marmalade over the yogurt.",

      "NOTES:",
      "Don't go too mad with the yogurt or cream! it actually tastes better if you don't drown it in yogurt or cream - probably because the porridge itself tastes so wonderful.",
      "SUGGESTIONS FOR ALTERNATIVE TOPPINGS:",
      "As an alternative to orange marmalade you might try a couple of teaspoons of orange or lemon juice, or crushed hazelnuts, or ginger jam/conserve, or pieces of crystallized ginger or slices of ginger preserved in sugar syrup, or maybe just honey. You might like to sometimes put a teaspoon of raisins in with the topping (or in with the porridge :) for a special treat. Incidentally I'm currently using 'Streamline' 'Zest' Reduced Sugar, High-Fruit (55% fruit) Orange & Grapefruit marmalade which is to die for if you can get it!",
      "SWEETENERS:",
      "If using a different granulated sweetener it's worth knowing that aspartame becomes unstable and loses its sweetness above 85 degrees centigrade hence the suggestion to use Splenda(R) which is fine above 100 centigrade and can be boiled no problem. Some granulated sweeteners contain acesulphame-K in addition to aspartame. Acesulphame-K stays sweet above 100 centigrade but some people think it doesn't taste so nice :) If in doubt, maybe spoil yourself and use sugar!",
      "CALORIC VALUES:",
      "I calculate calories per serving using sweetener and low-fat yoghurt to max out at around 265 calories depending on make and types of ingredients used. If you use sugar you can add another 70 calories for the suggested quantity here. For Cream add another 30 or more calories. Mine usually works out about 245 calories maximum but I use low sugar marmalade, fat-free yogurt etc."
