      "While the potatoes are cooling, make the samosa dough. Combine all-purpose flour, 1 tsp salt, crushed cumin seeds, 1/4 cup canola oil, 1 - 1 1/4 cup water. Knead the dough and let. rest for 10 - 15 minutes.",
      "While the dough is resting, make the spice mixture for the samosas. Heat up 1 tsp of canola oil in a frying pan over medium/high heat. In the pan, toast the fennel seeds for 30 seconds, or until aromatic. Add the slightly crushed coriander seeds and mix for 10 seconds. Add the crushed red pepper and diced onion. Saute for 1 minute, or until the onions are soft. Turn off the stove. Stir in 2 tsp of salt, mango powder, and finely diced green chilies.",
      "Next, peel and half the potatoes. Roughly mash the potatoes with a fork or with your hands until chunky smooth. Transfer the spice mixture to the potatoes and mix well. Stir in the cilantro and mint. The samosa filling is now ready. (Taste and adjust spice to desired level. Keep in mind that the filling spice will be less apparent in the samosas because the dough is not spiced.)",
      "To prepare the samosas, first divide the dough into 15-16 equal sized balls. Roll out each ball into a thin oblong circle. Apply all purpose flour generously on both sides of the dough and the countertop to facilitate the rolling. This dough is very stretchy, so it requires time between rolls for relaxation and plenty of flour to prevent recoil. The desired thickness of the dough is about 1-2 mm. The dough should be thin enough that the cumin starts to poke through and roughen the surface. When the dough is rolled out, cut each circle in half. Each semicircle will make one samosa.",
      "In a small bowl, combine 1 tsp of flour with enough water to form a thin gluey paste This paste is the sealant for the samosas. Now onto filling and shaping each samosa. Try to follow along:\na) On the straight edge of the semicircle, apply a coating of the paste. \nb) Fold the straight ends down and towards the center and seal the straight edges together. Pinch and twist the tip to ensure it is also sealed (Make sure to press down when sealing otherwise your samosa may fall apart while frying!) The dough should look like an ice cream cone right now. \nc) Next, hold the cone like you would an ice cream cone and fill with 2-3 Tbs of the potato filling. Press the filling down with your fingers.\nd) Apply a coat of the paste to the inner edge surface of your cone.\ne) Fold the longer rounded edge over and seal the samosa. Do not be afraid to stretch and bend the dough here. You should end up with a pyramid shaped samosa. \nf) Sit the pyramid down and use your thumbs seal the bottom part of the dough, pushing the filling in and up the samosa pyramid. The samosa should look like a pyramid on an overhanging platform.\n\nThere are several methods for folding this samosa pyramids. Since we are using a thick dough, you cannot use the methods applied to thin and flakey pastry sheets. But, here are a few instructional tools for those more visually inclined: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DloX2LDN4QA or http://farm5.staticflickr.com/4020/4663080707_c8b77ec848_z.jpg",
      "Once you have made all your samosas. Heat up enough canola oil for frying on medium high. Fry your samosas in batches for 9-10 minutes. During the first 4 minutes of frying, let the samosas sit in the oil and harden. Then flip them; (be careful not to bend their shape) cook for another 2 minutes. Accordingly flip the samosas for the last 3-4 minutes to ensure all the sides are equally golden. Strain out of the oil and onto a paper towel that can absorb extra surface oil. Let the samosas cool. Serve warm with tamarind chutney."

      "For the Dough: Sift flour into a medium mixing bowl, slowly pour boiling water in flour while stirring with a wooden spoon. (Note: do not let the water cool before adding it to flour; it must be very hot in order to cook the starches.) Continue stirring until dough forms a ball. Remove dough onto a lightly floured work surface. While the dough is still quite warm, knead it until smooth. Roll it into a 1-inch wide cylinder and portion into 16 equal pieces. Roll pieces into balls; cover with a damp paper towel until ready to fill.",
      "For the Filling: In a medium bowl, combine mushrooms, cabbage, ground meat, Chinese sausage, ginger, cilantro, chicken stock, oyster-flavored sauce, sesame oil, cornstarch and white pepper. Mix well.",
      "For the Dipping Sauce: In a small bowl, combine soy sauce, chili garlic sauce, black vinegar, sesame oil and sugar. Stir until sugar dissolves. Set aside.",
      "For the Dumpling",
      "Preparation: On a lightly-floured work surface, flatten a ball of dough with the palm of your hand. Using a rolling pin, roll it into a thin disk. Place a heaping tablespoon filling into the center of the disk, bring the sides together and seal only the top, leaving opposite sides open and filling exposed. Place dumpling, seam-side up, on a plate, pressing down lightly to give it a flat base. Cover with a damp paper towel while filling the remaining dumplings.",
      "Place a 10-inch non-stick frying pan over medium heat until hot. Add 1 1/2 tablespoons of the oil, swirling to coat the sides. Place half of the potstickers, seam-side up, into pan. Cook until bottoms are golden brown, about 1 1/2 to 2 minutes. Add 1 cup water; reduce heat to low and cook, covered, until all liquid is absorbed, about 5 to 6 minutes. Repeat with remaining potstickers, oil and water.",

Mix all the dry ingredients together. Now add it to the above mixture. Beat on medium speed until mixed. Spoon half the mixture into the one side of the prepared baking tin. Add a few drops of the food color to the remaining batter, stir until the color is thoroughly distributed, add more color if needed.",

      "Once completely cool, trim the edges of the cake with a long serrated knife. Cut each colored sponge in half length ways so that you are left with four long strips of sponge. Neaten the strips and trim as necessary so that your checkered pattern is as neat and even as possible. Gently heat the apricot jam and pass through a small sieve. Brush warmed jam onto the strips of cake to stick the cake together in a checkered pattern (one yellow next to one pink. On top of that, one pink next to one yellow). Dust a large flat surface with icing sugar then roll the marzipan in an oblong shape that is wide enough to cover the length of the cake and long enough to completely wrap the cake. Brush the top of the cake with apricot jam. Place the cake on the marzipan, jam side down"

Put half a cup of lemon juice and half a cup of orange juice in the bag with the chicken. Chop the two lemons and the three oranges in half. Squeeze two lemons halves and three orange halves into the bag and drop the left over rinds in the bag as well. Next, chop up the veggies into bite size pieces. Put the veggies in the bag and repeat the same process as with the first bag. Add a pinch of sea salt in both bags. But both full Ziplocs in the fridge for at least 2-3 hours.",

      "Meanwhile, start grilling your veggies and chicken on a grill. You can skewer them and make kebobs, or simply grill them in separate pieces. If it's chilly out, and you have no grill, just use a skillet. Cook the chicken first, and then do the veggies.",
      "I like to serve the veggies and sauce over a bed of lemon rice. To make lemon rice, simply make a pot of rice then stir fry the rice in butter, lemon juice (lots of lemon juice!!) and a bit of oregano.",
      "Note: This dish is very flexible. Add different veggies or meat. Add more lemon juice, less, different citrus fruits (like lime) the choice is yours!"
