And you may be waiting for your ice cream maker to chill in the freezer, anyway.",

If you have a sweet tooth, consider a drizzle of grade A maple syrup. Alternative finishes include toasted pine nuts, hot dark chocolate sauce or chips, or hot expresso. Just plain it is deeply creamy with just that subtle underling of wonderful ricotta grittiness. This is best eaten soon after processing. But if you do refreeze, take out your ice cream to let it soften at room temperature for 5-10 minutes. Avoid microwaving!"

      "If you use a dough recipe (see note below) that calls for refrigeration, remove your dough ball from the refrigerator about 60 to 90 minutes before baking pizza. Put your pizza steel or stone (or, if you don't have either, an upside-down rimmed baking sheet) on an upper rack in your oven no more than 8 inches below the broiler. Preheat the oven to 550\u00b0F (290\u00b0C) for 45 minutes.",
      "While the oven is heating, prep and roast the pineapple and onion. Peel the pineapple with a sharp knife, then cut the fruit away from its core. Cut the fruit into 1/2-inch squares. Slice the onion vertically into 1/2-inch-wide wedges, then cut into 1/2-inch lengths. In a large, heavy cast-iron pan, toss the pineapple (note: don't crowd the pan with pineapple or you won't get much browning-we wouldn't use more than about 4 cups in a 12-inch skillet) and onion in the olive oil with a sprinkling of fine sea salt and chile flakes to taste. Roast at 550\u00b0F (290\u00b0C) until tender and nicely caramelized, about 10 minutes, depending on the size of your pineapple and pan. Reserve 3 1/2 ounces (100g) of the roasted pineapple and onion mixture for topping the pizza. Snack on the rest or save for future pizzas.",
      "Set up your pizza assembly station. Give yourself about 2 feet of width on the countertop. Moderately flour the work surface. Position your wooden peel (or, if you don't have one, another upside-down rimmed baking sheet) next to the floured area and lightly dust it with flour. Have the bacon fat, tomato sauce, pecorino, ham, roasted pineapple and onion, and mozzarella at hand, and a ladle or spoon for the sauce. Switch the oven to broil 10 minutes before loading the pizza.",
      "To shape the pizza, put the dough ball on the floured work surface and flip to coat both sides moderately with flour. For Neapolitan style (puffier crust), shape the dough with your hands and leave a puffy edge, as shown in the video above; for New York style (thin crust), roll out with a rolling pin. Transfer the disk of pizza dough to the peel. Run your hands around the perimeter to relax it and work out the kinks.",
      "Dab bacon fat evenly around the dough, then spread the dough with the tomato sauce, smoothed with the back of the ladle or spoon. Add the toppings in this order: pecorino, ham, roasted pineapple and onion, and mozzarella.",
      "Turn off the broiler, then gently slide the pizza onto the pizza stone. Close the oven door and change the oven setting to bake at 550\u00b0F (290\u00b0C). Bake for 5 minutes, then take a quick look at the pizza to judge its progress. Turn on the broiler again, and finish the pizza until the cheese is completely melted and the crust is golden with spots of brown and a few small spots of char, about 2 minutes. Use tongs or a fork to slide the pizza from the pizza stone onto a large plate. Serve.",
      "Note: Use your favorite pizza dough recipe here-we love Jim Lahey's No-Knead recipe on Food52, or Ken Forkish has 13 different dough recipes in his cookbook The Elements of Pizza (linked in the headnote), including the same-day Saturday Pizza Dough, which we used in the photos and video: https://recipes.oregonlive.com/recipes/saturday-pizza-dough"

Add the shrimp in a shallow baking dish (I used a small pie dish), place it inside the steamer and put the lid on it.

If you do, add 1 1/2 tablespoon of mustard powder in the recipe so that you are not missing out on the sharp mustard flavor. \r\n\r\nb) ALWAYS, always heat mustard oil to a smoking point before you cook with it. This is an unbelievably pungent oil, it WILL make your eyes water and clear your sinuses if you try to have it without heating it properly. (Trust me - been there, done that). Don't burn the oil, though, as soon as you see the first wisp of smoke, take it off the heat."

    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "(Note: this recipe makes two doughs. That means you can either make something else, or you can half the recipe). As Stella Parks suggests, your first step is to get everything together. Get your butter cubed, stick it in the fridge. Get your water measured, stick it in the fridge. Get your flour measured, add the salt, stick it in the fridge (yes, even the flour). Get your mixing bowl out. Get your whisk. Get your tart pan (I used a 9\" pie pan, because of #tinykitchen). Your spatula (I used a fork), your rolling pin, your bench scraper, your new Rebecca Black CD, and clear the decks.",
      "Whisk the flour to incorporate your added salt well. Add the butter to the flour mixture. Working with little precision, squeeze the cubes, but only slightly. Aim for the thickness of a pea, about a quarter inch or so. The butter will crumble if it's good and cold, and that's great. But just work from one side of the bowl to the other squeezing each cube of butter. Give it a good toss and inspection. I also like to take a few handfuls of this mixture and just squeeze that too. Experienced shortcrust makers will feel this is wrong. It's pie crust, you're supposed to feel like you're doing something wrong.",
      "Smell the almond extract; remind yourself how powerful the odor is. Now, carefully measure and add the almond extract.",
      "Add about half of the water. Stir that in loosely, aiming for homogeneity. Note dry areas and either mix them into the wetter areas or add more water. I err on the side of caution with this step; if you over-hydrate the dough, you'll have a harder time later. Stop mixing well before it incorporates.",
      "Dump the unincorporated mixture on to your counter. Grab a handful of the dough and drag it on your counter, smearing it away from you. Scrap that off, set it aside. Do that to the entire dough. If you need a demonstration, you can youtube it: it's apparently called \"frisage,\" which is great for incorporating the dough, without overworking it.",
      "Roll out the entire crust (even if you didn't half the recipe). Now we're going to fake laminate it. Cut your dough into squares, about the size of your palm. Now stack the squares. You'll have a pie crust in a cube (3.14^3). If you didn't half the recipe, cut this into two pieces. Wrap one up for safekeeping. Generously dust your work surface with flour and roll out your dough to the appropriate size, accounting for the sides of your dish. While rolling, I like to rotate the dough frequently, this will allow you to check for sticking, and to form a more even geometry. Now transfer to your dish (Either by folding it up and transferring, wrapping it around your rolling pin and unrolling, picking it up).\r\nI tried this recipe with and without a blind bake. I found that it was unnecessary.",
      "Using the same floured work surface, roll out the almond paste into a ring about the size of your tart (pie pan). Place it on top of the crust.",
      "Stick your pie dish in the freezer or fridge. Where ever you can find the room, really.",
      "Drain the canned peaches very well. I used a strainer and added more flour and corn starch to manage the liquid, it wasn't enough. The canned peaches, while, after 40 minutes of baking, the difference in flavor wasn't too upsetting, the biggest issue was the moisture. Be sure to do what you can to remove that moisture.",
      "Add the flour and corn starch directly to the peaches. Mix that well.",
      "In a separate bowl. Add the remaining flour, sugar, almond extract (thinking of how strong it is) and the butter. Once again, pinch the butter. Form a sort of pebbly topping.",
      "Now we can assemble. Add the peaches to the pie pan. You're more than welcome to make them all facing the same direction, or to just make it \"rustic\" by dumping them in there.",
      "Top with the sugar mixture.",
      "Put the pie back into the fridge/freezer. Now you can preheat your oven to 425F (218C). Once that's ready, bake for 40 minutes. But check it after 20, because your crust can easily burn, so you'll want to wrap the edges with foil to keep that from happening.\r\n\r\nIf that happens, take a sheet of foil and wrap the entire pie with foil. Cut an X in the foil, and peel back the center. The edges of the pie should be covered, with the center exposed.",

Taste and adjust seasoning, adding salt and pepper as needed. (You may need more oil and vinegar; we like our salad lightly dressed.)"

The cool water temperature should be between 70\u00b0 and 75\u00b0F.",
      "Mix: Add the yeast mixture to the flour, stir 3 or 4 turns, then, little by little, add the cool water. Mix with your hands for 2 to 3 minutes, until all of the ingredients are incorporated, the grit of the salt is dissolved, and the dough forms a rough and shaggy mass, and then stop.",
      "Let the dough rest: Cover the bowl with a kitchen towel or plastic wrap and let the dough stand still for about 30 minutes.",

Tap your hands in a little flour, then gently flatten the dough into a rectangle, with the short side facing you.\r\n\r\nUse your fingers or the plastic scraper to flip the top edge of the dough down to just below the center, then flip the bottom edge up to just above the center. Repeat this process for the right and left sides, then turn the dough over and dust off the flour. This wet dough will benefit from a second fold; let the dough relax for 1 to 2 minutes after the first fold, then sprinkle a little more flour on your work surface and fold a second time.",

Mark the time with a felt-tipped pen on the plastic wrap and allow the dough to rest and rise in a moderately cool place until the dough has doubled in volume, 1 to 2 hours, depending on the heat of your environment. \r\n\r\nAfter the first 30 minutes of fermentation, turn the dough out of the bowl onto your work surface, and fold again as described above. Return the dough to the bowl, cover, and complete the fermentation. NOTE: The dough is folded again to build strength, which is necessary because this is a highly hydrated dough.",
      "Cut and shape: Once the dough has doubled in volume, sprinkle a lot of flour onto your work surface, and prepare a proofing place for the ciabatta by sprinkling the same amount of flour onto the back of an inverted baking sheet.\r\n\r\nUse the plastic scraper to scrape the dough out onto the work surface, letting it assume its natural shape. Tap your hands in flour, and gently flatten the dough into a large, even rectangle measuring approximately 12 by 8 inches and 1 inch thick.\r\n\r\nUse a metal bench scraper or knife to cut the dough into 4 equal pieces, approximately 4 by 6 inches. Gently place them on the floured back of the baking sheet.",

Have ready a spritzer filled with water near the oven and approximately 8 ounces of hot water to pour into the empty pan. \r\n\r\nOnce the dough has approximately doubled in volume, sprinkle more flour on the work surface. Take 1 dough piece at a time and stretch it very gently to lengthen it by 2 to 3 inches, then place it on the floured area of your counter. Dust off your baking sheet, turn it right side up and oil it, and place each piece upside down on the baking sheet.",

After 1 minute, open the oven door and spritz around the dough with water, then close the door again. The ciabatta should bake to a very dark brown in 45 to 55 minutes.",
      "Cool: Let the ciabatta cool completely on a wire rack. After the bread has cooled, use a serrated knife to cut it horizontally through the center, and take a look at the interior. \r\n\r\nIdeally you will have baked the ciabatta to a very dark brown so that the caramelization of the crust permeates the entire flavor of the bread, and the crust is eggshell thin, perfect for a sandwich. The holes in the crumb will be large, embedded in the cobweb strands of glistening dough; notice how much lighter the ciabatta is than the focaccia, and how much larger the holes of the crumb are."

      "Line a baking sheet with parchment or wax paper. Have a towel nearby for wiping fingers. Pour sugar into a shallow plate. Stir the egg white briskly in a small bowl with a fork just to break up clumps without making foam.",
      "Use your thumb and forefinger to swish and coat a petal in egg white. Remove the petal and slide it between your thumb and forefinger to be sure that it is coated on all sides. Once coated, squeegee off as much excess egg white as possible by continuing to stroke the petal, squeezing gently, with your thumb and forefinger, and wiping the excess from your fingers against the edge of the bowl and/or with a paper towel. Don't skimp on the squeegee-ing! You want just a very thin, sticky coating of egg white to adhere the sugar: Excess egg white will make the sugar coating thick and clumpy or even liquefy it-in both cases the drying time will be longer and the results less gorgeous. (When you advance to coating more complex flowers, use your fingers to coat and then squeegee accessible petals and the stem, and a tiny brush to coat and remove excess egg white from deep, intricate, or inaccessible areas.)",
      "Lay the coated petal in the bed of sugar and spoon sugar over it. Use the spoon to flip and sugar the other side. Flip and sugar a couple more times until the petal looks evenly frosted. Slide a fork under the petal and transfer it to the parchment. To coat thin leaves that go limp from the weight of the egg white (such as mint leaves) or awkward or tricky whole flowers, hold them by the stem over the plate of sugar and use the spoon to sprinkle all sides (and interior areas) with sugar; shake off excess sugar as necessary. Use the method or combination of methods that works best for the item that you are sugaring-you'll learn as you work.",
      "After depositing the sugared pieces on the parchment, inspect and sprinkle a little extra sugar over any bare or moist spots.",
      "Let flowers dry uncovered in a cool place until the coating is crisp. Most petals and small flowers will be still fragile, but dry enough to use for decoration after about 4 hours: I like to wait at least 24 hours (or even longer) depending on the item.",
      "With some exceptions, crystallized flowers and herbs are best used within a few days. Flower petals last much longer because they tend to become completely dry and crisp, but their color may become less pretty. Herb leaves don't dry out completely from the sugaring, so their flavor gets slightly funky after a few days, though they look fine for much longer."

      "Attach the dough hook to the mixer, then add the flour and salt to the bowl and pulse the mixer a few times in order to make the flour damp. Then mix at medium-low speed (scrape down the bowl as needed) until you have a shaggy mass, 2 to 3 minutes.",
      "Scrape down the sides of the bowl and decrease the speed to low. Pour in the beaten eggs in 3 additions, making sure that each is incorporated before you add the next part. Then, beat in the rest of the sugar and increase the speed to medium. Beat for about 3 minutes, until the dough starts to come together.",
      "Return the mixer to low speed and add the 12 tablespoons of butter that you've cut into small chunks. Wait until each is incorporated before adding the next one. There is a lot of butter in this recipe, which means this part is going to take some time and you might get antsy. Be patient. (I found that scraping down the sides of the bowl and aiming the butter cubes into different areas of the bowl helped ease my mind.) When all of the butter is incorporated, your dough will be very soft and silky.",
      "Increase the speed to medium-high and beat until the dough pulls away from the sides and begins winding its way up the dough hook, about 10 minutes. It's important to let the mixer do its thing at this stage-I set a timer and stepped away so that I wouldn't be tempted to stop the process prematurely.",
      "Lightly butter a large bowl and scrape the dough into it. Cover it with plastic film and let it rise at room temperature until nearly doubled in size, an hour or so. (In the winter, I recommend using the aid of a space heater.)",
      "Deflate the dough by lifting it up on the sides and letting it plop down into the bowl. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate. Deflate the dough every thirty minutes or so until it stops rising, about 2 hours (so you'll slap down your dough about 4 times). Then press plastic wrap around the surface of the dough and leave it in the refrigerator overnight.",
      "When you're finally ready to bake the dough, butter two 8- or 9-inch cake pans. Remove the dough from the refrigerator and divide it in half. Shape each half into a bowl, cupping it and pushing out the air. Place the balls seam side-down, one in each cake pan, and cover with parchment paper. Let them rise in a warm place for 60 to 90 minutes, until the dough balls are nearly doubled.",
      "Center a rack in the oven and preheat it to 400\u00b0 F. Bake for 25 to 35 minutes, or until the tops are golden and you can feel that there is dry air inside of the dough balls when you tap them.",
      "As soon as your dough is close to being finished, melt the remaining 4 tablespoons of butter in a small saucepan and ready a bowl with sugar. Take the cakes out of the oven when they're finished and, while they're still hot, douse them with the melted butter. You should hear the butter sizzle a bit as it hits the hot pan -- that's what you're looking for. Use a spoon to generously sprinkle the sugar over the cakes. It should adhere to the melted butter.",
      "While the cakes cool, make the raspberry whipped cream. Chill the mixing bowl and beater for at least 15 minutes (I do this in the freezer to expedite the process). Beat the cream in the bowl until you have soft peaks (you'll be able to see beater marks in the cream, but it will still be light and cloud-like). Add the preserves and beat until they're incorporated and the peaks are a bit stiffer.",
      "Let your cakes cool completely before carefully slicing them through their bellies, like hamburgers. Use a spatula to apply a generous amount of jammy whipped cream to the bottom halves of the cakes, then sandwich it with the cake tops.",

      "Preheat oven to 335F degrees. \r\nSpray an 8 inch metal square pan. Please use exactly what it says and preferably a light color pan. If you don't have one, invest in one. You will not regret it.\r\n\r\nSeparate egg whites from yolk. Beat egg whites until soft peaks and gradually add the 1/4 cup (50 grams) sugar and beat until stiff. Set aside and transfer to another bowl if you need the same bowl to cream the butter.\r\n\r\nCream butter and the 3/4 cup (150 grams) sugar until and fluffy. Be patient. It may take 5-10 minutes. Add the vanilla and zest if using. You can even add some cardamom or nutmeg if you so desire. Then add eggs yolks gradually beating for a few seconds after each addition. Put half the flour (which you mixed with the baking powder, and stirred with a fork for about 1 minute to aerate it) and mix on low speed. Do not overmix. \r\nAdd 1/2 the milk, mix for a few seconds, then the other half, mix for a few seconds, then the remaining flour. \r\n\r\nPut half the egg white and mix on low speed, then fold the rest into the cake batter using a spatula. Be patient. It may take you quite a few turns of the bowl to fold egg whites into flour so don't be discouraged. I've been there so I know. My trick is to turn the bowl as I fold. What I do is to do a \"quarter turn\" of the bowl (as if I am turning bowl from a zero minute position to a 15 minute position) and fold; then turn bowl to a 30 minute position and fold; turn bowl to a 45 minute position and fold; turn bowl to a zero minute position and fold. Repeat the turning of the bowl and folding until all egg white is well incorporated into bowl. Google the art of folding if needed. \r\n\r\nPour batter into pan and level it with spatula. \r\n\r\nBake for 45 minutes at 335F degrees and then 9 minutes at 300F degrees. Please do this exactly. A skewer inserted into middle of cake will/should come out clean. You will see that the cake has risen to the very top of the pan but the surface remains flat (don't worry if you see a few bubbles). \r\n\r\nLet cool on rack for 15-30 minutes then invert on a plate and turn it again onto rack or serving plate. I like to wait till the day after to eat it but you don't have to. But let it cool for a couple of hours before serving.\r\nYou will find that the cake is so light that it almost melts in your mouth. Sprinkle top with some powdered sugar if you want, and serve with coffee/tea, as snack or dessert.",
      "NOTE: When using measuring cups for flour and sugar, please do not dip the cup directly into the flour or sugar sack or container. Instead, spoon it into the measuring cup and then scrape off excess with a straight edge. Also, please note that my cup measurements are rounded but you should still have the same outcome than if you weigh the ingredients."

      "Trim off any excess fat from your chicken. Use your index finger to create a cavity between the breast and the skin on each side, being careful not to tear the skin. Push some of your compound butter into each side, covering as much of the breast as you can. You can also work from the cavity to separate the skin from the thighs and stuff with butter mix. Rub any remaining compound butter over the outside of the chicken. Salt and pepper the cavity, then stuff with the sage and reserved carrot greens. Sprinkle the chicken lightly all over with salt and pepper. Set on rack breast side up and place in the oven with the cavity facing the back wall.",
      "Roast for 1 hour or more, until thermometer inserted into thigh meat reads 165. Move chicken on rack to a plate, and let rest 10 minutes or more. Transfer roasted vegetables to a bowl, taste and season as needed, and add a splash of apple cider vinegar to brighten. Cover.",
      "While your chicken cools, pour off all but a tablespoon of fat from the pan (keep all the good brown bits in there). Warm over medium high heat, then add vermouth and cider. Cook, scraping as you go, until the liquid is very reduced but not totally evaporated, about 5 minutes. Add in stock, cook until reduced by about half, another 5 minutes or so. Reduce heat to medium-low and add in the butter. Cook, stirring, until the butter is melted and the sauce is satiny.",
      "Carve bird and serve with pan sauce, carrots and sprouts.",
      "NOTES: \r\n\r\n1. Keep chicken carcass in freezer, along with your vegetable trimmings, and add to this whenever you can. When you have 1 to 2 cups of vegetable trimmings, place those and the frozen chicken carcass in a slow cooker, add some smashed peppercorns and a bay leaf, and any sadder looking vegetables from your fridge and cover it all with water. Add in a splash of vinegar (I've read this helps break down the bones, and if it doesn't it tastes good anyway) and set to cook on low for 10 hours. Allow to cool a little, strain, and then refrigerate or freeze.\r\n\r\n2. If you don't have a roasting pan don't fret; I use an oven-safe skillet and put the rack from my toaster oven over top, it works just fine. And if you don't have anything that would serve as a rack, you can sit the bird right on top of the veggies; the bottom of the chicken and the covered vegetables won't get browned but it will still be tasty."

      "Add the yeast and all of the remaining flour, a half cup at a time, stirring well after each addition.",
      "When it become too difficult to stir, turn the contents out onto a floured work surface and knead. Once the dough comes together, let it rest for about 5 - 10 minutes. Wash and dry well your mixing bowl. (The dough is full of fat so you really don't need to grease it.)",
      "Continue kneading for a total of 10 to 12 minutes, until it is smooth and resilient. Add more flour only if necessary to keep the dough from sticking hard to your hand. You shouldn't need more than a few teaspoons.",
      "Put the dough in the bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Or, leave it on the counter and cover it with the bowl, provided that the bowl is large enough to allow the dough to double in size when it rises.",
      "Allow the dough to rise for about 2 hours, or longer if necessary, until doubled in size.",
      "Using the palms of your hands and flattened fingers, firmly press out the CO2 gasses and form the dough into a disk that's about 8 inches in diameter. Allow the dough to rest for at least ten minutes.",
      "Cut the dough into 16 pieces. (I use my bench scraper to do this, cutting it first into quarters, then each quarter into four pieces.)",
      "Shape into balls by using your thumbs to pull the dough from the top to the underside, stretching it, turning a quarter turn and doing it again, and repeating that motion until the ball is round. Then pinch the dough on the bottom to seal. Roll each ball around on the work surface with the palm of your hand 6 or 8 times, bearing down just a bit as you do so, to tighten up the ball.",
      "Butter generously the bottom and sides of a spring form pan. (I also use a large heavy Dutch oven when I have room in the oven for it, increasing the temperature to 425. I'll post photos of the long-rise bread cooked in a Dutch oven for your information. See my note below for more details on the baking procedure I use.)",
      "Arrange the balls of dough so the smallest are in the center. (Some will be smaller, unless you use a scale to measure each one, which I don't do, because I actually like having some smaller than the others. The inside rolls cook better if they're smaller.)",
      "Allow to rise, loosely covered, for about an hour and 15 minutes.",
      "Preheat the oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit",
      "Beat an egg with about 1/2 cup of water. Brush some lightly on the rolls.",
      "Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, tenting with foil if necessary to prevent excessive browning.",
      "Enjoy!!",
      "NB: If using a commercial instant mashed potatoes product (as opposed to buying potato flakes in bulk), use only if the potatoes are separated from seasoning and other ingredients that may be included. In other words, use only pure flakes of potatoes when making these rolls.",
      "FOR A LONGER RISE: For an overnight rise, decrease the yeast to 1 teaspoon. Knead only until the dough comes together, is very smooth, and starts to feel stretchy. Refrigerate in a tightly lidded, well-buttered storage box that's large enough for some expansion. The dough should rise some, but mine at least usually doesn't increase more than about 1/3 in volume when refrigerated overnight.",
      "Check it about ten hours later. If the dough hasn't risen much, take it out and put it in a fairly cool place. Continue to check it throughout the day and move it to a warmer spot if it's still not rising much. My house and the weather here are generally rather cool, and my refrigerator tends to be very cold, so this dough usually spends the better part of the day after the overnight rise on my counter. Interestingly, the second rise doesn't take as long as you might expect.",
      "If you want to cook the rolls in a heavy Dutch oven, heat your oven to 425 (or 400 if it's a convection oven). Don't brush the egg wash before putting the rolls in the oven. Bake the rolls with the lid on for about 18 minutes. Then remove the lid, quickly and very gently brush with the egg wash, and return the pot to the oven, uncovered. Bake for another 8 to 10 minutes. Allow to rest for about ten minutes, then remove the rolls to cool on a wire rack. If possible, don't eat them for at least 2 hours after removing from the oven."

      "Once the chickpea burger mixture is ready, give it another good stir - you should notice that the bulgur wheat has absorbed some of the moisture, though the mixture should still appear fairly wet. You want a good amount of moisture remaining so the burger doesn't dry out while cooking. If you feel that the burgers are too wet and won't hold a form, you can add a little more bulgur wheat, but do so very slowly as it takes time for it to soak up moisture. Conversely, you can add a little water if you feel the mixture is too dry.",

Add the patties to the skillet (careful not to crowd the pan), cover, and cook for 6-7 minutes, or until golden brown. Flip the patties, cover, and cook the 2nd side for another 6-7 minutes. Remove from the skillet and allow to cool on a wire rack or paper towel. Continue to cook the remaining patties in the same fashion, adding more olive oil as needed.",
      "After you have cooked all of the patties, add the sliced hamburger buns to the skillet to lightly toast the inside, approximately 1 minute. This will add a nice crisp without drying out the rest of the bun.",

Put them on the hot baking sheet -- without using parchment, for best results -- and sprinkle on a pinch of salt. Roast for 20 minutes, turning the cubes over and stirring briefly after the first 10 minutes.",

      "N.B. You can roast the potatoes and squash up to two days in advance. Cool thoroughly before storing in a tightly lidded container in the refrigerator. The Brusslies do much better and retain their beautiful color when they are cooked within a few hours, at most, of eating. You can trim and halve them, though, up to two days in advance, provided that you store them in cold salted water in the refrigerator. Drain them well, tossing a few times in the colander to get as much moisture off as possible, before roasting. They can be slid in the oven on a rack directly below another one. Feel free to make up the entire dish, except the Brusslies, three or four hours before the meal, and then toss the Brusslies in at the end. This dish is best served warm, but it doesn't need to be too hot. It's also tasty at room temperature, if that works out best for you. ;o)"

      "Make the dough for the crust. Measure all the dry ingredients into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook. Swish a measuring spoon through them to disperse the yeast before adding the liquids. Add the water, olive oil, and honey. Mix on low speed until the dough comes together and leaves the sides of the bowl. Add a tablespoon or so of flour if need be. Stop the mixer when the dough has come together. You don't want to give this dough much at all in the way of kneading, otherwise it will tend to be more bread-like, and that just isn't what you want at all. Stop the mixer, remove the hook, cover the bowl with a piece of plastic (NOT a towel!) and let proof at room temperature until it has doubled in size. A NOTE HERE: sdebrango has a wonderful method for proofing pizza dough day-long in the fridge, which I think is brilliant. So make your dough in the morning before leaving for work. Set in in the mixer bowl covered with plastic into the fridge. Go to work . Think about pizza. Come home, take it out. Let it come to room temp while you build/light your fire and make your topping.",
      "While the dough is proofing, start your fire. I use charcoal grills, so if you do too, build a good honking big fire. Be sure the bottom draft is open. Once it has burned down to coals, scatter them over the bottom of the grill, set the grate in place, and set a pizza stone on it. I have a stone that I've designated as grill only. Close the top. Set the bottom and top drafts to half open. If you use a gas grill, heat it to high, set your stone in, and reduce heat to medium-high.",
      "While the grill is heating and the dough proofing, start your topping. Slice the tiny tomatoes in half lengthwise. Smash, peel, and mince a couple of cloves of garlic. Heat a skillet over medium-high heat. Add a generous amount of olive oil. When it's hot (it will shimmer, or ribbon), add the tomatoes and a pinch of sea or kosher salt. When the tomatoes are very tender, and if they spatter too much, turn the heat down some, add the garlic. Stir it all together and reduce the heat to low. Cover the skillet and let everything get nice and soft and concentrated.",
      "Chiffonade your basil. Chiffonade is French for ribbon. You're going to cut the leaves in the direction of their cells' growth so as not to encourage browning. Pull of some lovely, large leaves, probably 3 or 4 per pizza. Lay them one atop the other, stems and tips matching. Roll them from stem to tip like a cigar. Set the roll on your board and slice them as thin as possible. Into ribbons.",
      "When the dough is ready, turn it out onto a gently floured board. Divide it in half. Tenderly round up each half. Work with one at a time. Pat it out, working from the center outwards, When it is about 10 inches in diameter and no more than 1/4' thick, stop. Dust a wooden peel or the back of a baking sheet with cornmeal, polenta, or semolina. Lift the pizza dough onto the peel. Spoon some of the luscious, concentrated sauce (not too much) onto it and use the back of the spoon to spread the sauce around the surface of the dough. Proceed directly to the grill. Slide the pizza (the cornmeal-polenta-semolina will act line tiny ball bearings) onto the screamingly hot stone. Close the lid. If using a gas grill, turn off the heat. Charcoal/wood, damp down the top and bottom vents. Your heavenly creation should be blistered, browned, and ready to eat within no more than 5 minutes.",
      "Open the grill. Scatter the basil chiffonade over the pizza and grate some Parmesan cheese over it. Close the top for a couple of minutes, then open it, lift the pizza out with the peel. Cut it, serve it, and eat it immediately. Imagine that you are in a country where a musical language is spoken and the light has a golden-sepia hue. Raise a glass of wine and announce, salute!"

      "If you can find storebought vanilla cookie crumbs, all the power to you. If not, you can grind up roughly 20 cookies to get 1 cup. I like using arrowroot, but if youre not a fan, feel free to use your favourite non-creme vanilla cookie. Place the cookies in a food processor and process until they are fine crumbs. Place crumbs in bowl or measuring cup.",
      "In a small pot, melt the butter over medium heat. Once melted, stir in finely chopped mint. Continue to cook for about 1 minute and then remove from heat. Pour butter mixture into the crumbs and mix until thoroughly combined. Put the crumb mixture into an 8 inch springform pan lined with parchment paper and press down firmly until you have a nice firm crust. Put in the freezer until needed.",
      "Rinse the cookie crumbs out of the food processor and use it to puree your watermelon. Line a strainer with cheesecloth and place over a medium pot. Pour the watermelon puree into the the strainer. Force the juice through the cheesecloth using a spoon. Continue until all juice has gone through and only pulp remains. Discard the pulp. Add 1/2 cup milk and 1/4 cup sugar to the watermelon juice. Heat the watermelon juice mix over medium high heat and bring to a boil. While the watermelon juice is heating, create a cornstarch slurry. In a small bowl mix the 1/2 cup cornstarch with the 6 tbsp water, mixing thoroughly until its a smooth liquid. Once liquid is boiling and sugar is dissolved, slowly pour the slurry into the pot, while whisking quickly. Continue to whisk until the filling has thickened and all the slurry has been incorporated. Remove the crust from the freezer. Pour filling over crust. Put into fridge to set at least 5 hours, but preferably overnight.",
      "To make the lime syrup, zest the lime and then cut the remaining lime into quarter wedges. Squeeze juice into small pot. Add the zest, 1/2 cup sugar and 1/4 cup water into the pot and stir to combine. Over medium heat, bring to a boil stirring constantly, ensuring that all sugar is dissolved. Once it starts to boil, continue to stir and cook for 1 minute. Literally 1 minute. Use a timer or your watch because if you cook to long it will be too thick, and not long enough it will just be sugar water. Remove from heat after 1 minute and transfer to glass storage container.",
      "Pour lime syrup over each individual piece when serving, it truly brings all the flavours together. Enjoy!"

      "In a container with a spout (like a 2 cup liquid measuring cup), whisk the eggs, milk, and vanilla to combine. Add this mixture to the mixer and mix on low speed for 3 minutes, or until the dough comes together. (It will be relatively sticky.)",
      "Raise the speed to medium and mix for 5 minutes more. During this time, gradually add the butter (about 1 tablespoon at a time, though no need to be precise-I just grab soft butter with my hands and throw it in willy-nilly).",
      "Once the butter is fully incorporated, transfer the dough to a large greased bowl. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and let rise at room temperature for 1 hour. Refrigerate the dough for 10-12 hours (overnight).",
      "The next day, roll the dough out on a lightly floured surface to about 1/2-inch of thickness. Cut rounds from the dough using a 3-inch round cookie cutter (or the rim of a large glass). You can re-roll the dough a couple times-just remember it will get tougher the more you work it.",
      "Transfer the rounds to parchment lined baking sheets, leaving about 1 inch between each piece. Cover the dough circles with greased plastic wrap and let rise for 45 minutes to an hour.",
      "While the dough rises, prepare the topping. Cut the apples into quarters, then cut away the core at an angle, leaving a flat surface on the base of the apple quarter. Thinly slice each piece of apple, but not fully, like for hasselback potatoes. Cut the apple 3/4 way through, allowing the pieces to separate at the top but stay together at the base.",
      "Just before the brioche pieces are done rising, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Egg wash the surface of each brioche evenly. Sprinkle granulated sugar evenly over the surface of each piece of dough.",
      "Place a prepared sliced apple quarter in the center of each brioche. Sprinkle dark brown sugar evenly over the surface of each apple.",
      "Place a small pat of butter (about 1/2 teaspoon) on top of each apple. Transfer the brioche to the oven and bake until the apples are tender and the brioche is golden, 17-22 minutes.",
      "Cool at least 10 minutes before serving. They are absolutely the best served warm."

Warm the jam in a small saucepan on low heat and add it to all the other ingredients you're using for the filling with, except for the crushed biscuits.

    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "Choosing, Browning & Braising the Meat\r\n\r\nThe type of meat cut is important for this stew focused dish. Because the posole is a stew meant to cook at a low heat for a long period of time, we recommend using a piece of meat with collagen. If you're using lamb, there is collagen in the shanks and they will cook down to a delectable meat. Same goes for pork shoulder and beef chuck. And if you're going the chicken route, make sure to use a whole or quartered chicken, bone-in and skin on. For vegetarians & vegans, you can skip this altogether.\r\n\r\nThe most important step to browning your meat is to get rid of surface moisture. We like to use a paper towel to thoroughly blot the meat as dry as possible. A dry surface on your meat means that you'll get a nice, flavorful crust once it hits your hot pan, thanks to the Maillard reaction.\r\n\r\nCut meat into 1 pound chunks (we bought 2 pounds and cut it in half) and season heavily with salt and pepper. Next, add your vegetable oil to your Dutch oven and turn up to medium high until the oil is lightly smoking. Add your meat and let it sit there until just the bottom side is deeply seared, about 5 minutes on each side. The key trick here is not to move the meat around and don't worry about searing every edge- just focus on the top and bottom.\r\n\r\nBraising the meat will take about 2 hours if braised whole. The braising process entails turning tough connective tissue (primarily the collagen) into gelatin- a process that relies both on time and temperature. We cook our meat in a Dutch oven on an oven setting of 250 degrees Fahrenheit for about 2 hours.",
      "Brown the meat:\r\n\r\n1. Bring meat to room temperature. Pat meat dry to remove all excess liquid, generously salt.\r\n2. Heat vegetable oil in a Dutch oven or pot over medium high heat, until the oil is near smoking. Add and sear the meat, until well browned on each side. Try not to move the meat while it's searing. Remove meat from pot and set aside.\r\n\r\nLayer the aromatics:\r\n\r\n1. Add 1 tablespoon vegetable oil to dutch oven over medium heat.\r\n2. Add chopped onions, scraping up the brown bits into the mix. Allow onions to begin to brown, about 10 minutes.\r\n3. Add minced garlic and cook until fragrant, about 3 minutes. Add RawspiceBar's Ground Chiles and Posole Spices in thirds until fragrant, about 5 minutes.\r\n4. Increase heat to medium. Add chopped tomatoes (juice removed) and let brown, about 5 minutes. Add vegetable oil as needed to keep contents moist.\r\n5. Add reserved tomato juice and sugar (or honey) & combine. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer.\r\n\r\nBraise & simmer:\r\n\r\n1. Add seared meat back to pot. Cover and put in conventional oven at 275 degrees Fahrenheit. Allow to braise for 2 hours until meat is fork tender.\r\n2. When tender, remove posole from Dutch oven and temporarily remove meat. Chop meat into bite size pieces, about 1 inch each, set aside.\r\n3. Puree pot contents into a sauce with an immersion blender (or leave chunky, if preferred).\r\n4. Add chicken stock and bring to a simmer. Add canned hominy (or garbanzo beans) and chopped meat back to the pot and allow to cook for another 40-50 minutes on stovetop over medium-low heat until hominy is softened (if using dried hominy or garbanzo beans, soak over night first)."

Check the lentils after they have cooked for 45 minutes (30 if you are using brown; they could get mushy). If the stock has been absorbed and the lentils are tender remove from the oven. Otherwise, continue to cook another 10-15 minutes or so, adding more broth if necessary to prevent the lentils from burning.",
      "Meanwhile, make Simple Mustard Vinaigrette: In a jar, combine 8 tablespoons olive oil, 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard, 3 tablespoons red wine vinegar, 1/2 teaspoon salt, freshly ground black pepper. Screw lid on jar and shake vigorously until emulsified (the dressing, not yourself).",
      "Once cooked, allow beets and lentils to cool, uncovered. Drain any excess broth from lentils if necessary. Remove beets from pan, reserving remaining delicious beet juice/onion/basil mixture. Peel beets and cut into 1-inch chunks. Gently combine lentils, juice/onion/basil mixture, and beets in a large bowl. Toss with about half the jar of Simple Mustard Vinaigrette; more to taste. Adjust salt and pepper. Serve at room temperature."

The final texture is really up to you. I generally enjoy my veggies more al dente than the next guy. Once finished, drain the cauliflower through a colander set atop or inside a large heatproof bowl. You'll want to reserve all of your boiling liquid. Set cauliflower florets aside and return liquid to the sauce pan or larger pan to boil your pasta. Add extra water if needed. Return liquid to a boil and cook your pasta shells as directed on the box. Remember, al dente is always best!",

Take care not to burn the red pepper or garlic, and stir everything occasionally until the garlic becomes slightly golden. Next, add the anchovies. Allow them to melt into the oil. This should take 3 to 4 minutes. Feel free to stir a bit to help them along. Once the anchovies have dissolved, add the drained cauliflower florets into the skillet. Toss everything to combine. Lower the flame to the lowest possible setting while your pasta finishes cooking.",

Turn off the flame. Season carefully with salt (remember that anchovies are salty already) and liberally with black pepper. Drizzle with good quality olive oil.

Once the oil is warm, add sage leaves and cook until they are starting to brown lightly (1-2 minutes). Remove from oil with slotted spoon and drain on a paper towel. Sprinkle with sea salt and let cool.",

Push some flour from sides of well into the center as the mixture begins to thicken. Continue whisking until mixture becomes very stiff.\r\nStart to knead dough by hand and gradually work in additional flour along with 4 to 6 tablespoons of water (1 tablespoon at a time). Continue kneading and dusting with flour until dough is no longer sticky and springs back when pressed in the center. Cover ball of dough with plastic wrap and allow to rest for 1 hour.

Cover over with the other half of dough that has been slightly moistened with water. Press top firmly using first the palm of your hand and then passing over with a rolling pin. Place a cutting board on top of mold and turn over to release raviolis. Use a pastry wheel to cut and form individual raviolis. If necessary, lightly dust with flour and refrigerate.

Cook until ingredients come together and butter has browned a bit. Set aside.\r\nSalt the boiling water and gently cook the raviolis just until done.

They're probably not going to be perfect, ideal slices because they'll be all mushy and gross, but it doesn't really matter since they'll be bread dough in about five minutes. Also, pour some sauce on those bananas while they're cooking. Let them bathe in the goodness.",

      "To make the herb-oil mixture, put a fourth of the parsley and mint in a strong blender or food processor, and blend it on low speed. Use a blender stick to help crush the herbs while the blade is spinning (or stop the machine from time to time to push the herbs back down toward the blade). Slowly increase the speed to medium (or a steady puree, in a food processor) and continue adding the rest of the herbs until you have added all of them.",
      "In a steady stream, add half of the olive oil. Mix on medium-low speed (or pulsing, if using a food processor) until all is combined. Add the remaining olive oil and blend for no longer than 10 seconds. The mixture will look loose and stringy. Scrape out the blender to get all of the parsley mixture, transfer it to a bowl, and refrigerate until ready to use.",
      "In a bowl, combine the flour, cornstarch, salt, and baking powder and set aside.",
      "In a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, whip the eggs for about 30 seconds. Add the sugar and mix on high speed until the mixture is very thick and turns a pale yellow color, about 3 minutes. Turn the mixer speed down to low and add the herb-oil mixture.",
      "With the machine still running, add the flour mixture and mix until just combined. Do not over mix. Pour the batter into a container and refrigerate it for at least 6 and up to 24 hours (the cake will turn out much greener than it would if you baked it right away).",
      "When you're ready to bake, preheat the oven to 340\u00b0F and lightly oil a sheet pan -- ideally a 13- x 18-inch for a thin cake but 11 3/4- x 16 1/2-inch will work with a slightly longer baking time (at Food52, we used a 10- x 15-inch jelly roll pan). Line the bottom of the pan with parchment paper and lightly oil the paper. Pour the batter into the sheet pan and smooth out the top with a spatula.",
      "Bake for 12 to 18 minutes, rotating the cake halfway through. If the top begins to brown before the inside of the cake is done, turn the heat down to 330\u00b0 and let it cook a couple of minutes longer. When a cake tester inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean, it's done. Let it cool in the pan.",
      "To serve, tear serving-size squares of cake into a few larger pieces and divide them among individual plates. If desired, serve with vanilla ice cream and lemon zest. Alternately, eat warm with butter for breakfast."

      "Dissolve the yeast and the sugar in the luke warm water and let it stand for 5 min so the yeast can become active. You will see it's active if there is foam forming on the water that crawls up slowly.",
      "Put half of the flour with the salt and oil in a large bowl, add the yeast mixture and mix it with a wooden spoon until it is a porridge like substance. Cover with a wet towel and put away on a warm spot until doubled in size, between 45 min/ an hour.",
      "Preheat the oven on 200C./392F. \r\nIn the meantime we will start with the Shakshuka. It's time to cut! For people who want to make a fast version, they can put the ingredients that have to be finely cut into the kitchen machine but I like a bit of cutting work to wake up. If you are afraid of your fingers when you have to make this after a heavy night out, you can also make the sauce the day before and store it in the fridge. Warm it before putting it in the oven dish. This makes the entire process much faster. Same for the bread, if you make it the night before, you can let it rise slowly in the fridge, take it out an hour before you use it so it can get to room temperature.",
      "Coarsely chop a 1/4 onion, 1 clove of garlic, the tomatoes and the spinach. Finely chop the basil, parsley, spring onion, 1/4 onion, 1 clove of garlic.",
      "Take a large heavy based pan. On a medium fire warm two tablespoons of olive oil and bake the coarsely chopped onions until soft, add the coarsely chopped garlic and bake for another minute. Add the tomatoes and let it simmer until the tomatoes are soft and formed a little sauce. \r\nThe trick is to add these remaining ingredients at the last moment before you put the entire sauce in the oven dish, this way these ingredients stay a bit raw which gives the sauce a fresh taste. If your tomatoes do not provide enough sauce, just add some tomato sauce yourself.",
      "When the bread is risen, add the ketchup, 1/2 tablespoon balsamic vinegar, 5 drops of Tabasco (or more if you like it hot) and the finely chopped ingredients to the sauce and warm it shortly, add pepper and salt to taste.",
      "Lay a little lake of sauce on the bottom of a medium sized oven dish. Lay the spinach on top and put the rest of the sauce on top of the spinach. Make three shallow holes in the sauce and break the eggs in the holes. Make sure the egg yellow doesn't break. To make sure of this, you can break the eggs in a little bowl and slide from the bowl in the sauce one by one.",
      "Back to the bread\t\r\nDough can be quiet stubborn and not listen to the quantities we have written down for it on paper, so you might not need the entire quantity of flour, or maybe you need a little more, try to feel the structure, it needs to be flexible, as warm as your hands but not sticking to your hands too much. That's why we incorporate the second batch of flour hand by hand, so we can feel when the dough has enough flour. Another reason is that when you make this pre mixture with half of the flour, your bread will be softer and more flexible. \r\n8. Use the wooden spoon to beat down the risen bread, it will be quite sticky and full of air. Add the remaining of the flour hand by hand an incorporate it in the dough with the spoon. When the work gets too heavy with the spoon, switch to use your hands. Knead flour in the dough until only slightly sticky.",
      "If you make the dough the night before, place it now in a plastic container and store it in the fridge, don't forget to take it out an hour before you use it so it can get to room temperature again.\r\nIn this stage you can kneed in the sesame and/ or poppy seeds shortly through the dough.",
      "Flour your worktop, put the dough on top, put flour on top of the dough and work it with your rolling pin until 1/2 a centimeter thick.",
      "Now wet the upper edge of the baking dish a bit and cover the bowl with the bread. Make sure it seals the dish. The dough is supposed to cover the sides of your oven bowl as well. If you still have access dough, you can trim it, form it into a disc and bake it next to the Shakshuka on a piece of aluminum foil.",
      "Now place the Shakshuka covered with the pita in the oven and bake for 10/15 minutes or until golden brown on top.\r\nIt requires some work but you will certainly steal the show when you present this hidden Shakshuka under a blanket of bread on the brunch table. It is also a hearty meal but I am sure people will be cleaning the dish with the remaining bread and even with their fingers when the bread is over, at least that's what happened at my brunch table. Eet smakelijk! Enjoy your meal! B'teavon!"

Transfer to a baking sheet and keep in a cool place (like the refrigerator) until ready to use.",
      "Peel the potatoes (try to get them into a roughly round shape) and slice very thinly with a mandoline. Use one of the smallest settings - you want the potato slices to be paper thin and translucent. Place the slices in a large bowl of cold water so that they lose some of their starch and do not turn brown. (Note: It is not possible to cut the potatoes thinly enough with a knife. If you do not have a mandoline, cut the potatoes in half and use a vegetable peeler to shave slices.)",
      "Mince the garlic and place it in a heavy-bottomed pan with the olive oil. Over low heat, gently warm the olive oil until the garlic begins to sizzle. Turn the heat off and let the garlic sit for at least five minutes. While the garlic is resting, drain the potato slices and pat dry with paper towels.",
      "Assemble the tart. Spread the creme fraiche onto the puff pastry, avoiding the border (an offset spatula is helpful here, but not necessary). Spread the mustard on top of the creme fraiche, and evenly distribute the garlic on top of the mustard. Starting with one side, arrange a row of potato slices so that they overlap slightly and form a scalloped edge. Arrange another row of potato slices overlapping the first row by 60-70%. Repeat until you have covered the entire tart (you may have extra potato slices). If potato slices curl, lay them concave side down. With a pastry brush, generously brush the top of the potatoes with heavy cream (you can also drizzle it very carefully with a small spoon, just try not to let it run off the side). Sprinkle the top of the tart with a few pinches of salt, keeping in mind that this is your only chance to season the potatoes. Sprinkle the Parmesan cheese sparingly over the top.",
      "Bake until the pastry is golden and puffed and the potatoes show at least a faint hint of color here and there around the edges, usually about 30-35 minutes in all. Halfway through baking, take the tart out and brush or drizzle with heavy cream a second time (this moisturizes the potatoes and helps them cook). When the tart looks done, take it out, grind a bit of pepper over it, and artfully scatter some watercress leaves across the top. Return the tart to the oven for another two minutes, until the watercress is lightly wilted but still bright green. Serve warm."

Using a hand mixer or whisk, whisk until the mixture thickens and triples in volumes. It will have the consistency of a very thick custard and will be a lovely golden color, You may see some small bubbles frothing on the surface, but do not boil. Otherwise you will have scrambled eggs! Take zabaglione off heat and add to marscapone cheese mixture. Whisk until smooth, then add 1/4 amount of whipped cream to bowl with a rubber spatula. Fold to incorporate. Fold in remaining whipped cream to marscapone cheese, then fold in final tablespoon brandy.",
      "Putting it all together: Dip each cookie in simple syrup mixture, coating for about 4 seconds on each side. Line cookies on bottom of serving dish (a glass or decorative dish looks stunning) with sides at least 2 inches high. Spread half of the cranberries over cookies, covering them completely. Add half of zabaglione mixture on top of cranberries, speading to edges of pan. Top with half of the chopped hazelnuts. Make another layer of dipped cookies, cranberries, ending with zabaglione layer and hazelnuts. (Depending on the size of your pan, you may be able to make more layers of cookies, cranberries, and zabaglione.) Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 6 hours or overnight. Remove tiramisu 30 minutes before serving. Serve with hot espresso or a snifter of brandy."

    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "Preheat oven to 250\u00b0F. In a bowl, toss the tomatoes with 2 tsp olive oil and a generous sprinkling of salt. They will be slippery, but halve the tomatoes with a serrated knife (I like a bread knife for this). Place on 2 parchment-lined baking sheets, with some space between each tomato half. Drizzle with a little more olive oil and sprinkle lightly with more salt.",
      "Roast for 2-3 hours, or until tomatoes are collapsed and slightly browned. Let cool for 15 minutes before using. Can be made and stored in the refrigerator up to 3 days ahead.",
      "Next, make the cornmeal pastry dough (below). While the pastry chills, cook the leeks. In a skillet oven medium-low heat, heat the butter and olive oil and add the leeks through chile peppers. Season with salt and cook until softened and leeks have taken on a little color. Turn heat down to low, cover and cook for 10-15 minutes more. Add salt and pepper until well-seasoned. Remove from heat and cool slightly.",
      "To make the pastry, combine all dry ingredients through salt in a mixing bowl. Stir to combine well. Add the butter, cutting in with a pastry cutter or quickly using your fingers, until the mixture is coarse with pea-sized chunks of butter. Sprinkle in the buttermilk and stir with a wooden spoon until it just comes together. There will probably be loose flour and cornmeal, but don't worry. Line a soup bowl with a large sheet of plastic wrap and fill it with the dough. Twist the package closed and gently knead the loose flour mixture into the dough. Shape into a disk and chill for 1 hour.",
      "Preheat oven to 375\u00b0F and place a rack in the bottom 1/3 of oven. Remove pastry dough about 20 minutes before you plan to roll it out (reserve the plastic it was wrapped in). Place dough on a 15-inch square of parchment and place the reserved plastic over it. Roll the dough out to a circle about 15 inch in diameter. Leaving a 2-inch border, fill half of leek mixture onto dough, followed \r\nby about half of roasted tomatoes, then rest of leeks. Top the filling off with the rest of the tomatoes. (You may find that not all the tomatoes will fit, and will have some leftover. Throw into a salad, sandwich, or just pop them in your mouth.) Sprinkle with a little salt.",
      "Brush the 2-inch border with egg wash and then fold edges of dough toward center, pressing gently to seal. Don't fret if the pastry rips a little as you do so. Brush the folded crust with egg wash and slide the crostata on parchment onto a baking sheet. Bake for 40-45 min. For the last 10 minutes, remove from the oven. Remove the rack, and return to bake directly on the oven floor (this should help the bottom crust bake properly) until the top crust is a golden brown. Don't be afraid of color!\r\nServe warm or at room temperature."

Cover and turn up the heat; when you hear the water boiling, give the apples a stir, cover again then turn the heat down to low and simmer for 10 minutes. Uncover the pot (you'll find the apples quite watery now) and continue letting it simmer and evaporate for a further 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. At the end you should have a fairly \"dry\" pot with barely any free-flowing liquid. Puree the apples with a stick blender then set aside (to be extra safe from hot splattering, let the apples cool to room temperature before pureeing).",

Crack 4 eggs directly into the pan. Salt and pepper the tops. Spoon hot oil over the top of the eggs around the yolk to cook the egg white. When your egg white is no longer runny, sprinkle cheddar cheese on top and turn the heat down to low. You can take your eggs out whenever you like, depending on how you like the yolk to be cooked.",

Don't overcrowd the baking sheet. Use multiple baking sheets if you need to. The sliced baguette should be arranged in a single even layer. Drizzle olive oil over the sliced baguette. Bake for 3-5 minutes, until the edges of the baguette begin to look toasty and brown. You don't want your crostini to get too brown, because they will go back into the oven again later. When the crostini are lightly toasted, remove them from the oven and set them aside.",
      "Set a large skillet over high heat, and add enough grapeseed oil to barely coat the bottom of the skillet. When the skillet is very hot and faint wisps of smoke are just beginning to appear, add the sugar snap peas. Don't overcrowd the skillet (cook the sugar snaps in batches if you need to). Let the sugar snaps cook undisturbed for about 30 seconds. Then, stir the sugar snaps so that they become seared on all sides. Do not overcook the sugar snaps. They should taste \"al dente\" and not overcooked. After about two minutes in the skillet, the sugar snaps should be seared and nicely cooked. Remove them to a rimmed baking sheet to cool, and season them with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Using a fine microplane, add the zest of half of the lemon and toss to coat. Add a squeeze of lemon juice as well. Taste one of the sugar snaps and adjust the seasoning as necessary with more salt, pepper, and/or lemon. When you are happy with the taste of the sugar snaps, slice each sugar snap on the bias into thirds and set them aside.",
      "To make the goat cheese \"fonduta,\" set a medium pot over low heat and add the butter. When the butter has melted, add the flour and adjust the heat to medium. Stir the flour and butter to form a paste. Cook for 2-3 minutes, stirring regularly. Add the milk in a slow, thin stream while whisking continuously. By adding the milk slowly and whisking continuously, your sauce will hopefully be smooth instead of lumpy. Increase the heat slightly; you want to bring the milk to a simmer but you do not want a rapid boil. Stir regularly. The sauce should simmer for 2 minutes and become velvety and creamy. If the sauce looks too thick, you can always add a few tablespoons of water until you have a velvety consistency.",
      "When you are happy with the consistency of your sauce, reduce the heat to low and add the chevre and the goat gouda. Stir to incorporate. You should now have a beautiful looking cheese sauce. Season with a pinch of salt and a few cracks of pepper. Taste the sauce and adjust with more salt or pepper as necessary.",
      "Turn on your broiler. Coat each crostini in a layer of cheese sauce. Make sure to fully coat the top of each crostini (this will prevent the edges of the bread from burning). Broil the crostini until the cheese sauce is bubbling and beginning to caramelize. Top each crostini with a few of the sliced sugar snaps. Serve immediately. Enjoy."

      "Whether you're using a grill or the oven, preheat it to hot (about 450\u00b0 ambient temp in the grill; 495\u00b0 for convection oven*). If you're using a pizza stone, remember to put it on or in at this time (NOT when the grill/oven is already hot).\r\nRoll out your crust on a piece of parchment. Drizzle your half with the olive oil, and then use your fingers to rub it in evenly. Sprinkle with the red pepper flakes and garlic slivers.",
      "In a skillet, cook your bacon until about halfway or 3/4 of the way done. You don't want it to burn later. Remove and drain on paper towels. Pour out most of the bacon drippings, leaving just enough in the skillet to coat the bottom. Return the pan to medium-high heat, and add the chopped collards. Stir to coat with drippings and cook for 3-4 minutes. In the meantime, chop the bacon (I remove any egregiously sized fat chunks). When the greens have started to soften and wilt, throw the bacon crumbles back in, toss, and remove the skillet from heat. Don't overcook them.",
      "Head back to your prepared pizza crust and atop the pepper flakes and garlic slivers, place the tomato and mozzarella slices. Then spoon your greens and bacon mixture evenly over all that.",

      "*When we use our convection oven without the stone, we prebake our crust for 7-8 minutes on parchment. Then we remove the crust from the parchment, dress it with our toppings and return to the oven to cook for another 11 or so minutes.\r\nWhen using our oven and the stone, we don't prebake.\r\nSorry if this is confusing...many iterations over here. :)"

      "FOR THE BUTTERNUT SQUASH: Pierce a medium butternut squash all over with a fork or tip of a knife. Place on microwave-safe dish and cook on high for about 1/2 hour, turning every ten minutes or so, until soft and mushy. Cut squash down the middle. If it's still hard in the middle, nuke it a little more. Scoop out seeds and pulp. Scoop out the soft squash, mash it a bit, and place in a mesh strainer over a bowl. Let drain for a couple hours, or overnight. Depending on the size of your butternut, you'll probably have extra squash, as this recipe only uses 1/2 cup. Make soup with the rest. Or double the scone recipe. And make a little less soup.",
      "FOR THE CINNAMON DRIZZLE: mix 1 cup confectioner's sugar with 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon. Add 2 tablespoons warm water. Stir until smooth. I always do this by sight, so if too loose, add more sugar. If too thick, add more water. If not cinnamon-y enough, add more cinnamon. It should be thick like corn syrup. Set aside.",
      "In the bowl of a food processor fitted with the chopping blade, place the dry ingredients and the chopped sage, and pulse to combine.",
      "Add the butter, and pulse about 10 or so times. You want to retain some small pieces of butter. Don't blitz the heck out of it. Transfer the flour mixture to a large mixing bowl. If you've got some really large butter lumps, just squish them with the back of a fork.",
      "In a large measuring cup, place the squash, egg and heavy cream. Mix well. Pour into flour mixture. With a dinner fork, fold the wet into the dry as you gradually turn the bowl. It's a folding motion you're shooting for, not a stirring motion. When dough begins to gather, use a plastic bowl scraper to gently knead the dough into a ball shape.",
      "Transfer the dough ball to a floured board. Gently pat into a 6\" circle. With a pastry scraper or large chef's knife, cut into 8 triangles. I use a pie marker to score the top of the dough circle and use the lines as a guide.",
      "OPTIONAL BUT RECOMMENDED: Place the scones on a wax paper-lined sheet pan and freeze until solid. Once they are frozen, you can store them in a plastic freezer bag for several weeks.",
      "Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Place frozen scones on a parchment-lined sheet pan, about 1 inch apart. Brush with cream. Take the whole sage leaves, brush front and back with cream and place on tops of scones. Sprinkle tops of scones with sugar.",
      "Bake for about 20 - 25 minutes, turning pan halfway through. They are done when a wooden skewer comes out clean. When cool, drizzle with cinnamon glaze.",
      "Slather with clotted cream and fig jam, if you feel like gilding the lily. But if not, these are pretty darn good with just plain ol' butter, too. These are great the next day, warmed in the microwave for 15 - 20 seconds. They freeze really well, too, and can be reheated in a 350 degree F oven until warm. Enjoy!",
      "BAKING TIPS: Last but not least, I highly recommend you get an oven thermometer, if you don't have one already. The success of quick breads like this depend upon a really cranking hot oven, and if your oven fluctuates, like mine does, then you can adjust your oven temp accordingly. Mine always runs cooler, so I crank it up until the thermometer reads the temp I want. Also, if you are baking less than a full batch, double up on your baking sheets, which helps prevent scorched bottoms."

Take the roughly chopped Seitan and toss on flour and seasoning then place in the casserole dish and stir once the pieces start to brown. Once all Seitan has been browned on both sides add back in the onion, garlic and carrots. Pour in the can of Guinness which will help to remove any flour that has stuck to the bottom of the pan. Increase the heat then once boiling add in the red wine or port, dark soy sauce, marmite, bay leaves and stock. Allow to cook for 15-20 minutes on a medium heat then have a taste and adjust seasoning if necessary. For more salt add in extra dark soy sauce and for more heat add in extra white pepper and freshly ground black pepper. Next add in the fresh rosemary and oregano followed by the pearl barley, stirring every few minutes so it doesn't stick to the bottom of your pan. Keep an eye on liquid too as your may need to add another half a pint of vegetable stock or red wine depending on how rich you like your stew to be. Allow to cook for a further 10-15 minutes or until the barley is soft when eaten.",
      "For the dumplings simply rub the butter into the flour using your fingertips until you have a fine crumble like texture. Add in the cheese, herbs, horseradish and seasoning then combine well before finally adding in a splash of water. Add in another if you need to, enough to bring the mixture together like a dough. Next roll into rough balls the size of a cherry tomato or a little larger and place on top of the stew. Cover with a lid and cook over a medium heat for 12-15 minutes. Note - Ensure you have enough stock/gravy in your stew so that the barley doesn't stick while you cook your dumplings.",

Mix all together until the onions and garlic have turned orange from the juice of the chorizo, and cook over a low heat to soften the onion.",

Add a ladle of the stock and stir this in until it has evaporated, and keep doing so until the rice has reached an al dente texture. This should take 17-20 minutes.",

Cover and leave to stand off the heat for 3 minutes. When serving, add the remaining rosemary on top as you wish.

      "Cooking the Zucchinis: I grilled about half the amount of zucchini ribbons to get those nice lines on the vegetable (this is optional). It adds a smokey flavor to the dish and also makes it look nicer! After they're cooked, set them aside. While doing that, I caramelised the diced shallots and onions in another pan and added a bit of brown sugar along with the chilli-infused oil. Add the uncooked zucchini along with the herbs and spices, using tongs to carefully stir without breaking the ribbons.",
      "Topping it off: Finally, garnish the dish with sun-dried tomatoes and crumbled goat cheese."

(At least, none that you can think of. What would you know? You're just an immigrant.) Do not reflect upon the fact that your many years of high-priced education and awe-inspiring professional experience will prove completely useless to the task you are about to undertake.",
      "Preheat the French-made oven to 7, without knowing precisely what temperature that is. It's a nice number.",
      "While the oven is heating, remove from the icebox the rolled-up piecrust dough that you bought at the supermarket, standing for hours while waiting at the check-out. Do not think about the fact that rolled-up piecrust dough like this is impossible to find in the United States. Let the dough come to room temperature.",
      "Go to the cupboard and fetch one or two jars of the fruit preserves you spent hours making, over a hot stove at the height of August. Do not reflect upon the additional hours you spent hunched over the garden, collecting the ripe fruit that fell like rain; or the hours that you spent sorting the good from the rotten, until the smell of ripe fruit nauseated you, and for weeks you couldn't get the stick and the smell off of your fingers, and then you couldn't get the juice stains out of your shirt. (We prefer mirabelle plum preserves.)",
      "When the oven has reached the correct temperature, whatever that is, unroll the piecrust dough and place it in the pie pan. Remember that, after all these years, you still don't have a pie pan that is the right size; roll up the edges of the dough so that it will fit in the pan. This makes it look more homemade. Try not to think about the fact that you have never had a kitchen with sufficient counter space to make your own piecrusts.",

Do not leave the piecrust too long in the oven, or it will burn to a disgusting, leathery shell, the way it did that time you were cooking dinner for your in-laws. Under no circumstances recall the expression on your mother-in-law's face when she saw that you couldn't even cook a prepared piecrust properly.",

      "Sprinkle the contents of about one-third to one-half the bag into the piecrust. Spread it evenly with a fork. Or a spoon. Definitely not your fingers. Try not to think about the fact that a bag of powdered almonds costs more than you earned last week. Everything costs more than you earned last week: that's what it means to be unemployed, and that's why you need comfort food. (Like fruit tarts.) Place the remainder of the bag of powdered almonds in the refrigerator. You will find it next winter, whereupon you will need to buy another new bag.",
      "Check the icebox to make sure you haven't forgotten a jar of fruit preserves already opened and half-eaten. Just because we call it \"preserves\" doesn't mean it lasts forever.

Wonder whether the stove is supposed to affect the thermostat this way, so that the furnace turns off. Maybe if the stove weren't so close to the furnace - but there's nothing you can do about that now.",

Put a teaspoon of the goat cheese mixture in the indentation and spread it out a little, but not all the way to the edges. (Don't use up all of the goat cheese mixture. ) Make four more thin patties, using up the remaining lamb, to top each bottom patty. Press the layers firmly to seal the edges against goat cheese leaking on the grill. Mix one to two teaspoons of the green chili-honey-lemon mixture into the remaining goat cheese, which will become the final topping.",
      "Grill for about 2 minutes until bottom sides are nicely browned. Flip and spoon some of the honey-lemon-chili glaze on top of each burger. Remove finished burgers and top with a dollop of the goat cheese-glaze mixture. Serve in a warm pita pocket."

There is no recovery from burned flour.",

      "Slowly add half the stock, stirring as you pour, and continue cooking over medium heat. It does not matter if the liquid is hot or cold when you add it. The gravy may look lumpy or curdled at first, but as it cooks, it will smooth out. When the gravy comes to a slow boil, it will thicken considerably. Add the remaining stock, continuing to stir at a simmer, until the gravy has the thickness you prefer. You may need a little more or less than 4 cups of liquid.",
      "If the gravy thickens too much, it can be thinned with additional stock or water.",
      "Once the gravy has the consistency you prefer, add salt and pepper to taste. It is very important to add salt gradually, 1/2 teaspoon to begin, and then by 1/4 teaspoons, tasting after each addition has been stirred in, but being sure to add enough salt. Gravy needs salt.",
      "Variations: Pinches of herbs such as thyme and sage may be added if you like. A few tablespoons of white wine may be substituted for part of the liquid.",
      "Gravy can be kept warm for an hour or so, but it will form a skin which should be skimmed before serving. It may also continue to thicken as it sits, so it may be necessary to whisk in a little hot water or stock to thin it just before serving.",
      "Variation: to make \"cream\" gravy for biscuits, substitute sausage drippings for the fat and use milk (or cream thinned with water) as the liquid. A dash of hot sauce or pinch of red pepper flakes may be added to the salt and pepper as seasoning, and cooked, finely chopped sausage can be mixed in."
