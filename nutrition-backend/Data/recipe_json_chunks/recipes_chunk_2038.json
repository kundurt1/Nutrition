      "For zucchini imam bayildi, hollow 2 pounds zucchini by scooping out their centers from the stem end, using an apple corer (see page 315), taking care not to pierce them right through.",
      "Stuff with the above filling and set the zucchini in layers, side by side, on a bed of tomato slices in a large pan.",
      "Pour over them about 1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil mixed with a teaspoon of sugar and a little salt.",
      "Cover the vegetables with water and simmer, covered, over low heat, for 1/2 hour, or until soft.",
      "Small eggplants (3 1/24 1/2 inches long) are usually stuffed whole, although medium-sized ones can also be used.",
      "The usual way to stuff them whole is to cut a slice off the stem end just below the hull and reserve it to use as a cork and to scoop out some of the pulp with a small knife or a pointed spoon.",

      "Zucchini and small bell peppers, stuffed with the same filling, are sometimes cooked together in the same pot with the eggplants.",
      "A Turkish way is to leave about 1/2 inch of the stalks on, remove the hulls, and peel off 1/2-inch-wide strips lengthwise, leaving alternating strips of bare flesh and shiny peel.",
      "This ensures that the eggplants keep their shape, while the peeled strips allow the bitter juices to escape after sprinkling with salt.",
      "A deep slash is made along the center, right through the eggplant, to within 1/2 inch of each end, and the filling is pressed into this slash.",
      "A third way, used when the eggplants are baked, is to cut the eggplants in half lengthwise.",
      "In this case the eggplants can be a little larger.",
      "They are peeled or not, and a bit of the pulp is scooped out to hold the filling."
