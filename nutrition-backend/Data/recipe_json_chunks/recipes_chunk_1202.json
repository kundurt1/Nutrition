    "title": "herbed crepes with ricotta, green peppers and tomato sauce",
    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "Making the Crepe Filling: Add the oil to a pan, over a medium heat, and when it is hot, reduce the heat to medium-low and cook the bell pepper, stirring, until it is softened, add the garlic, and cook the mixture, stirring, for 1 minute. In a bowl stir together the bell pepper mixture, the ricotta, and 1/3 cup of the Parmesan with salt and pepper to taste and let the filling cool.",
      "Making the Crepe Batter: In a blender or food processor, blend the flour, the broth, the eggs, the butter, and the salt for 5 seconds. Turn off the motor, with a rubber spatula scrape down the sides of the container, and blend the batter for 20 seconds more. Transfer the batter to a bowl, stir in the herbs, and let the batter stand, covered, for 1 hour. The batter may be made 1 day in advance and kept covered and chilled. This makes enough batter for about 12 crepes.",
      "Making the Herbed Crepes: Heat a crepe pan or non-stick skillet measuring 6\" to 7\" across the bottom over moderate heat until it is hot. Brush the pan lightly with the butter, heat it until it is hot but not smoking, and remove it from the heat. Stir the batter, half fill a 1/4-cup measure with it, and pour the batter into the pan. Tilt and rotate the pan quickly to cover the bottom with a layer of batter and return any excess batter to the bowl. Return the pan to the heat, loosen the edge of the crepe with a spatula, and cook the crepe for 1 minute, or until the top appears almost dry. Turn the crepe, cook the other side lightly, and transfer the crepe to a plate. Make the rest of the crepes with the remaining batter in the same manner, brushing the pan lightly with butter as necessary. The crepes may be made 3 days in advance, kept stacked with a sheet of greaseproof paper between each crepe, wrapped in plastic wrap, and chilled.",
      "Assembling the Crepes: Spread about 2 tablespoons of the filling on each crepe and roll up jelly-roll fashion. Arrange the crepes, seam sides down, in a buttered shallow baking dish just large enough to hold them in one layer, brush them lightly with the butter, and sprinkle them with the remaining Parmesan. Bake the crepes in the middle of a preheated 400\u00b0F oven for 20 minutes and serve them with the sauce.",
      "Making the Tomato Sauce: Roughly chop the canned tomatoes in the can with the edge of a spoon, then add them with the juice to a pan, stir in the salt, the sugar, the tomato paste, the basil, and the cayenne, bring the mixture to a boil, and simmer it, stirring, for 20 minutes. Add the fresh tomatoes and cook the mixture for 5 minutes. Serve the sauce warm. Makes about 1 1/4 cups.",
      "Notes: If you want this to be a vegetarian dish, use vegetable broth. For variation, or if you prefer, use spinach in place of the green pepper. If you like your food spicy, add half a fresh jalapeno pepper to the tomato sauce."

      "A rich dish deserves a nice fresh crisp salad to go along the side. My secret salad. You know that jar of marinated vegetables next to the pickles and olives in the condiments aisle. Add a jar of that to some fresh romaine, add some fresh grape tomatoes and you have a great quick salad. You can even add some extra black or kalamata olive if you want. The vinegar and oil in the jar makes a great quick 2 minute salad. I usually add all the vegetables and about 1/2 of the liquid - Nothing else. Just toss and enjoy."

      "NOTES:",
      "~My local Whole Foods sells this with berries mixed in the dish. I suggest putting a few in the bottom of the dish, pouring the mixture over it and letting it set in the fridge for almost an hour and a half. Then put a few more berries on top to \"rest\" into the panna cotta as opposed to simply on top.",
      "~A few reviews from the allrecipes site mentioned the gelatin mix separating during cooling in the fridge. The best way that I have found to avoid this is after you have stirred in the extracts and before pouring into the dishes, pour the mixture into a glass Pyrex bowl or a heat safe jug. Gently move the dish in a water bath while stirring the mixture with a spoon to cool it completely before pouring into the serving dishes. By cooling the mixture quicker, I believe it gives it less time to separate.",
      "~Experiment with the flavors! Try adding some expresso to the mix and sprinkling it with cinnamon, or adding in some orange/lemon zest to the dish. Enjoy!"

    "title": "bacon explosion!",
    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "To kick off the construction of this pork medley you'll need to create a 5x5 bacon weave. If the strips you're using aren't wide enough to span 5x5 inches, then you may need to use a few extra slices to fill out the pattern. Just make sure your weave is tight and that you end up with a nice square shape to work with.",
      "The next step is to add some barbecue seasoning on top of your bacon weave. (BBQ Addict recommends Bad Byron's Butt Rub, Rendezvous Famous Seasoning, or Steven Raichlen's All-Purpose Rub).",
      "Now that your pork is well seasoned, it's time to add more pork. Take two pounds of Italian sausage and layer it directly on top of your bacon weave. Be sure to press the sausage to the outer edges of the bacon creating a patty that is the same thickness all the way across. Most grocery stores carry loose sausage, so just pick out one you like.",
      "Next up is bacon layer number two. Take the remaining bacon slices and fry them up the same way you would for breakfast. If you like soft bacon, make it soft. If you like crunchy bacon, make it crunchy.",
      "Since this is a barbecue recipe, we need to add another layer of barbecue flavor. Take your favorite sauce and drizzle it all over the top of the bacon pieces. (BBQ Addict recommends Burnt Finger BBQ's homemade competition sauce). Once you've sauced the bacon, sprinkle on some more of the barbecue seasoning you used on the bacon weave.",
      "Very carefully separate the front edge of the sausage layer from the bacon weave and begin rolling backwards. You want to include all layers EXCEPT the bacon weave in your roll. Try and keep the sausage as tight as possible and be sure to release any air pockets that may have formed. Once the sausage is fully rolled up, pinch together the seams and ends to seal all of the bacon goodness inside.",
      "At this point we can start to see the final shape of our Bacon Explosion, but we're missing one key item. To complete the construction process, roll the sausage forward completely wrapping it in the bacon weave. Make sure it sits with the seam facing downward to help keep it all sealed up.",
      "Sprinkle some barbecue seasoning on the outside of the bacon weave, and now it is ready for the smoker. Cook your Bacon Explosion at 225\u00b0F in a constant cloud of hickory smoke until your meat thermometer gives an internal temperature reading of 165\u00b0F Normally this will take about 1 hour for each inch of thickness, but that could vary depending on how well you maintain your fire and also how many times you open the smoker to take a peek. BBQ Addict recommends 2.5 hours, for a roll 2.5 inches in diameter.",
      "Now that the Bacon Explosion is fully cooked, you need to add some finishing flavors. Remember that barbecue sauce you used for inner flavor? You'll be using that same sauce to glaze the cooked bacon weave. Using a basting brush, coat the entire surface with a thin layer of sauce. Sweet sauces are loaded with sugars, so they'll give your fatty a nice glossy finish. Spicy and vinegar based sauces don't contain as much, so they won't set up as well. If you're dead set on using those sauces, just cut them with a bit of honey and you'll get the same effect.",
      "Slice the Bacon Explosion into quarter to half inch rounds to serve. If your roll was good and tight, you should now see a nice bacon pinwheel pattern throughout the sausage.",
      "Obviously pork is best served by itself, but if you feel the need to make this meat monster into a sandwich, BBQ Addict recommends placing a couple Bacon Explosion slices on a warm Pillsbury's Grands Biscuit."

When finished, you should have a single layer of larger nuggets, smaller nuggets, and loose pieces of oatmeal. Don't move the granola once it is in the sheet pan or the nuggets will fall apart. Some people do not like larger nuggets of granola. If you prefer granola with loose pieces of oats, just dump the granola directly onto a sheet pan after you have mixed everything together. Just give the sheet pan a quick shake to evenly spread everything out.",
      "Bake the granola for 20 minutes. Take the sheet pan out of the oven and very, very gently stir the granola. You, after all, do not want to break apart the nuggets you made earlier. Put the sheet pan back in the oven for another 8 minutes or so for a lightly toasted granola. If you like your granola really toasted, you can leave it in for several more minutes. Remove it from the oven and leave it in the sheet pan until it has cooled completely. The granola will get crispier as it cools. Toss with your desired mixed dried fruits, nuts, and seeds. Store in a sealed container.",
      "After you make this the first time, make a note to yourself and decide if you would prefer the next batch to be sweeter or less sweet. I actually prefer my granola less sweet so I often add less Splenda than this recipe calls for. Others have preferred more sugar in theirs. You decide!"

      "To make tortelloni, preheat oven to 375\u00b0F On a foil-lined baking sheet, toss together the butternut squash, 2 Tbsp olive oil, herbes de Provence, salt, and pepper. Bake until soft and golden, about 25 minutes. Meanwhile, heat the remaining 2 Tbsp olive oil in a small saute pan over medium heat. Cook the shallots and garlic until lightly golden, about 3 minutes.",
      "In a food processor, combine the roasted squash, shallot mixture, and the ricotta cheese and pulse a few times to blend. Add the crushed amaretti cookies and the nutmeg, and sprinkle with salt and freshly ground pepper. Pulse until smooth. The tortelloni filling can be made one day ahead.",
      "To make the tortelloni, lay out six wonton squares, keeping the remaining squares inside the package or under a very lightly dampened paper towel to prevent them from drying out. Place 1 Tbsp of squash mixture in the middle of the square. Using a small pastry brush, wet the edges of the square. Gently fold the square wrapper into a triangle, making sure the edges are securely closed and there are no air pockets inside. Dampen the corners of the longest side of the triangle and gently bring them together, pressing lightly to secure. Place the formed tortelloni on a baking sheet and cover with plastic wrap. Be careful to dry work surface before laying out another 6 wonton squares; this will help keep the tortelloni from sticking to the baking sheet. Continue until all the squash mixture is used. There should be approximately 36 tortelloni. The tortelloni can be frozen on the baking sheet, transferred to a tightly sealed plastic bag or container, and stored for up to one month.",
      "Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. As it heats, make the sauce: Melt the butter in a large, heavy skillet over medium heat. Add the sage and cook until the butter starts to brown, about 3 minutes. Turn off heat and add cranberries, walnuts, salt and pepper, and stir to combine. Place the tortelloni in the boiling water and gently stir. When they begin to float, they are done, about 3 minutes for fresh, and 5 minutes if they've been frozen. Using a slotted spoon, carefully transfer the tortelloni to a serving platter. Top with the cranberry walnut sauce, sprinkle with Parmesan cheese, and serve."
