Remove from heat, and let stand 5 minutes. Pour hot syrup over peanut butter mixture in bowl. (Do not scrape sides of pan.) Beat with a wooden spoon until smooth. Quickly pour into prepared pieplate. Cool completely. Cut candy into pieces.",
      "Tips: Grandma probably used the stage method to determine her candy's readiness, but a thermometer will give you more consistent results. Be sure to check that your thermometer works accurately and adjust accordingly if it doesn't. For example: if water boils at 212\u00b0 on your thermometer, your thermometer works accurately. If it boils at 210\u00b0, cook this recipe to 233\u00b0; if the boiling point on your thermometer is 214\u00b0, cook this recipe to 237\u00b0. Be sure that the bulb of the candy thermometer is fully submerged in syrup but does not touch bottom of saucepan. Don't beat candy too long; it hardens quickly as it cools. Beating candy in a separate bowl helps prevent the grainy texture that results from accidentally scraping any crystals off sides of pan."

      "In a stand mixer with the paddle attachment (or a handheld mixer with an egg-beater attachment; a whisk attachment won't mix the batter properly), beat butter on medium speed until pale and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Scrape sides and bottom of bowl halfway through.",
      "To butter, add sugar and beat on high speed until pale and fluffy. \"Every time the paddle turns, sugar crystals cut through the butter, creating little pockets of air for a fluffy cake.\" Scrape sides and bottom of bowl. On low speed, mix in egg whites and vanilla, then beat on high until thick and smooth; scrape bowl again. \"Scraping down the bowl is huge. If you see butter at the bottom when you pour the batter into the pans, that's a rookie mistake.\"",
      "Onto a large piece of parchment paper, sift flour and baking powder. Add salt.",
      "Turn mixer to low. Pick up parchment from opposite corners and tip about one-third of flour mixture into bowl; mix just until combined. Scrape bowl, then drizzle in half of buttermilk and mix just until combined. \"Otherwise you may develop the gluten in the flour, and your cakes will be tougher, denser, and sometimes gummy.\" Repeat, then mix in remaining one-third of flour mixture the same way. Scrape once more, \"then give it a final spinaroo.\"",
      "Pour batter evenly into prepared pans, smoothing tops flat with a rubber spatula. Give the pans a couple of taps on the counter to deflate any overly large air pockets. Bake on center rack, rotating 180\u00b0 halfway through, until top is pale golden, sides are deeper brown and pulling slightly away from sides, and top springs back lightly when pressed, 30 to 50 minutes. \"Don't overbake it or it will be dry.\"",
      "Remove cakes from oven and let cool 10 minutes in pans. Invert cakes onto a cooling rack \"so their tops flatten out,\" and let cool completely.",
      "Split cakes: Cover a rotating cake stand with a sheet of plastic wrap and set one of the cakes on top. With a large serrated knife, gently cut the cake horizontally and evenly in half, rotating the stand to move the knife deeper into the cake. Holding sides of plastic wrap, lift layers off stand and repeat with a second cake to make 4 layers total. Set aside 1 bottom layer to form top of cake later (it'll be more even).",
      "Layer the cake with frosting: Set a cake board on the stand and dollop on a tablespoon or so of raspberry frosting--\"that's your glue.\" Choose your most even-looking layer and center it on top. Using an offset spatula, smooth on a generous 1/2 cup raspberry frosting. Add 1 cup raspberries, spaced evenly apart, squishing each flat with your fingers before you add it. Set second layer on top and push down gently to eliminate air pockets. Make 2 more layers with raspberry frosting, raspberries, and cakes (use the reserved layer, cut side down, for the top of the cake).",
      "Crumb coat: With the back of an offset spatula, smooth a thin layer of pistachio frosting across top and down sides of cake, using a back-and-forth motion to massage frosting into gaps and crevices. Chill at least 15 minutes to harden the frosting. \"This step locks down all the crumbs,\" says Daykin, so they don't migrate through your final top coat of frosting and make it look messy.",
      "Top coat: Dollop frosting on top, then smooth it across and down sides. Smooth more frosting up sides of cake to give it a castlelike rim. Holding a bench scraper, wrap your arm as far around the cake as it will go, then rotate stand toward you, pressing scraper against frosting to smooth it and reinforce the rim. To finish frosting, draw long edge of spatula across the cake's top, keeping as much of rim as possible so cake looks tall and straight rather than slump-shouldered.",
      "Encrust cake: Put pistachios in a large bowl. Slide offset spatula underneath cake board to loosen board from stand and scoot it, with cake, onto your hand. Hold cake over the bowl and lightly press a handful of nuts, shavings, or sprinkles up side of cake, moving from bottom to top; they will instantly stick to frosting. Rotate the cake to finish encrusting.",
      "Make ahead: Up to 1 day at room temperature and up to 1 month frozen. Bake cakes and cool, then slice each into 2 layers. Stack layers between pieces of parchment paper, wrap in plastic wrap, and leave on counter overnight (or freeze in a resealable freezer bag). On the day you plan to serve, make buttercream and assemble cake (you can frost the cake frozen, but let it come to room temperature before serving).",

      "A roux is nothing more than flour and fat. The more delicious the fat, the better the roux. For example, duck fat or lard will impart more flavor than vegetable oil (but will be less healthy).",
      "A heavy pot or cast-iron skillet is best for making a beautiful roux. Heat the oil and stir in enough flour to make the consistency of wet sand. For best results, a roux is cooked over low heat and stirred every 15 minutes until it's the desired color (like a copper penny).",
      "You can cook a roux at a higher temperature, but watch carefully--it burns easily. Once it turns a dark golden color, you've got seconds to get it just a wee bit darker; there's a fine line between ready and burned.",
      "For a lower-fat gumbo, you can use a \"dry\" roux, which is nothing more than flour that's been toasted in an oven until it's reached the desired color (a golden brown). The dry roux is then whisked into a liquid slurry, and the lumps are smoothed out before it's added to the broth.",
      "From the base of either a \"wet\" or \"dry\" roux, you can create hundreds of versions by adding fresh herbs and vegetables (corn, potatoes, beans, eggplant, cabbage, squash...). Most seafood can be used (but add delicate oysters and crabmeat at the end, so they won't toughen and/or disintegrate), as well as most kinds of beef."
