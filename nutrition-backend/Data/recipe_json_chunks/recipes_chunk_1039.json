Another time I tried a drizzle of light, 50 percent less calories maple syrup (table blend) on top of the hamburger which I thought the kids would love. It's a good way to get them to eat meat and it tastes really good. Not too much maple syrup as that is all you will taste. Makes 1 large hamburger.",

I then strained (one time) the juice and waahlaah. Nectar. I'm assuming. It's worth the trouble. Make extra because the drink tastes better with it instead of just juice when whipping up this drink."

The easiest way to do this is to cut the onion in half from root to tip, peel it and slice each half into thick matchsticks lengthways, not quite cutting all the way to the root end so they are still held together. Slice across the matchsticks into neat dice. Cut 1 red pepper in half lengthways, remove stalk and wash the seeds away, then chop. Peel and finely chop 2 garlic cloves.",
      "Start cooking. Put your pan on the hob over a medium heat. Add the oil and leave it for 1-2 minutes until hot (a little longer for an electric hob). Add the onions and cook, stirring fairly frequently, for about 5 minutes, or until the onions are soft, squidgy and slightly translucent. Tip in the garlic, red pepper, 1 heaped tsp hot chilli powder or 1 level tbsp mild chilli powder, 1 tsp paprika and 1 tsp ground cumin. Give it a good stir, then leave it to cook for another 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.",
      "Brown the 500g lean minced beef. Turn the heat up a bit, add the meat to the pan and break it up with your spoon or spatula. The mix should sizzle a bit when you add the mince. Keep stirring and prodding for at least 5 minutes, until all the mince is in uniform, mince-sized lumps and there are no more pink bits. Make sure you keep the heat hot enough for the meat to fry and become brown, rather than just stew.",
      "Making the sauce. Crumble 1 beef stock cube into 300ml hot water. Pour this into the pan with the mince mixture. Open 1 can of chopped tomatoes (400g can) and add these as well. Tip in 1/2 tsp dried marjoram and 1 tsp sugar, if using (see tip at the bottom), and add a good shake of salt and pepper. Squirt in about 2 tbsp tomato puree and stir the sauce well.",
      "Simmer it gently. Bring the whole thing to the boil, give it a good stir and put a lid on the pan. Turn down the heat until it is gently bubbling and leave it for 20 minutes. You should check on the pan occasionally to stir it and make sure the sauce doesn't catch on the bottom of the pan or isn't drying out. If it is, add a couple of tablespoons of water and make sure that the heat really is low enough. After simmering gently, the saucy mince mixture should look thick, moist and juicy.",
      "Bring on the beans. Drain and rinse 1 can of red kidney beans (410g can) in a sieve and stir them into the chilli pot. Bring to the boil again, and gently bubble without the lid for another 10 minutes, adding a little more water if it looks too dry. Taste a bit of the chilli and season. It will probably take a lot more seasoning than you think. Now replace the lid, turn off the heat and leave your chilli to stand for 10 minutes before serving, and relax. Leaving your chilli to stand is really important as it allows the flavors to mingle and the meat.",

Then, pour the batter into a large bowl and place in the refrigerator to let it rest for 1 hour. This allows the bubbles to subside so the crepes will be less likely to tear during cooking.",
      "Heat a 10-inch crepe pan, or a non-stick pan on medium low heat. Add butter to coat and wipe off excess with paper towel. Pour 1/4 cup of batter into the center of the pan. Lift the pan and swirl to spread batter evenly. Or, use a crepe spreader, I personally love this tool. Cook for 2 minutes and flip the crepe once. Cook the other side for another 1 minute. Remove from heat to a serving plate to cool. Cook the remaining batter until all done, about 24 crepes.",
      "To Prepare the Vanilla Mascarpone Cream Fillings:",

      "To Assemble the Cake:",

Continue to build the crepe cake until you use up all the crepes. There should be 1/2 cup of vanilla cream filling left. Transfer to a pastry bag fitted with a closed star tip. Gently and loosely wrap the cake with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours before serving.",
      "To Prepare the Raspberry Sauce:",

      "mix together all of the ingredients in a bowl, adding the seltzer last and more lightly with your hands until uniform. don't worry that it looks to too runny because it will firm up in the fridge. Cover and refrigerate while you make the soup.",

      "skim the top of the stock with a wire mesh spoon. add the onion, garlic and big vegetable pieces along with 1 tbsp salt. cover and simmer for an hour.",
      "bring a pot of water and a little salt to a boil then reduce to a simmer. fill a shallow bowl with cold water. take the out the matzo meal and form into balls with a tablespoon and your hands. make sure to dip your hands and the spoon in the water between every ball. drop each of the balls into the water then cover and let simmer for about 20 minutes. the matzo balls should expand about to 1 1/2 their original side; i made six from the mixture.",
      "remove the chicken from the pot and strain the soup, discarding the vegetables. return the broth to the pot and add the remaining carrots and celery. Bring to a boil then simmer for 10 minutes or until the vegetables are almost tender.",
      "meanwhile remove the skin from the chicken and tear the meat into shreds. add the chicken shreds back into the soup and simmer for another 5 minutes. remove from heat and taste. Add the pepper and more salt if necessary.",
      "test the matzo balls with a fork. you should be able to insert it without feeling any change in pressure within. transfer the balls to the soup pot with either a slotted spoon or tongs. cover and let sit for 15 minutes so that they can absorb the flavor. reheat if necessary and serve."

      "Making Almond Powder: Combine the almonds, the 2-1/2 tablespoons confectioner's sugar and the 1/4 cup cocoa in a food processor fitted with the steel blade. Process until the almonds are a fine powder.",
      "Blending the Batter: Butter the bottom and sides of an 8-inch springform pan with the 1 tablespoon of butter. Cut a circle of parchment paper to cover the bottom of the pan. Butter the paper with 1/2 tablespoon butter and line the pan with it, butter side up. Use the 3 to 4 tablespoons flour to coat the entire interior of the springform, shaking out any excess. Preheat the oven to 375 F, and set a rack in the center of the oven. Using an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment or a hand-held electric mixer, beat the butter and sugar at medium speed 8 to 10 minutes, or until almost white and very fluffy. Scrape down the sides of the bowl several times during beating. Beating the butter and sugar to absolute airiness ensures the torta's fine grain and melting lightness. Still at medium speed, beat in the peanut butter. Then beat in the egg yolks, two at a time, until smooth. Reduce the speed to medium-low, and beat in the melted chocolates, the dissolved coffee, and the rum and vanilla. Then use a big spatula to fold in the almond powder by hand, keeping the batter light.",
      "Whip the egg white to stiff peaks. Lighten the chocolate batter by folding a quarter of the whites into it. Then fold in the rest, keeping the mixture light but without leaving any streaks of white.",
      "Baking: Turn the batter into the baking pan, gently smoothing the top. Bake 15 minutes. Then reduce the oven heat to 325 F and bake another 15 to 20 minutes, or until a tester inserted in the center of the cake comes out with a few streaks of thick batter. The cake will have puffed about two thirds of the way up the sides of the pan. Cool the cake 10 minutes in the pan set on a rack. The cake will settle slightly but will remain level. Spread a kitchen towel on a large plate, and turn the cake out onto it. Peel off the parchment paper and cool the cake completely. Then place a round cake plate on top of the cake and hold the two plates together as you flip them over so the torta is right side up on the cake plate.",
      "Serving: Torta Barozzi is moist and fudgy. Just before serving, sift the tablespoon of cocoa over the cake. Then top it with a sifting of the confectioner's sugar. (Or for a whimsical decoration, cut a large stencil of the letter \"B\" out of stiff paper or cardboard. Set it in the center of the cake before dusting the entire top with the confectioner's sugar. Carefully lift off the stencil once the sugar has settled.) Serve the Barozzi at room temperature, slicing it in small wedges.",
      "Wine Suggestion: In Vignola, homemade walnut liqueur (Nocino) is sipped with the Barozzi. Here, the black muscat-based Elysium dessert wine from California does well with the cake's intense chocolate."

      "For this recipe, you are essentially just creating the different elements for the lasagna and then layering them. There is a tomato sauce layer, a pasta layer, a bechamel sauce layer, and a cheese layer.",
      "Saute the garlic and onion in a large, wide bottomed saucepan.",
      "Meanwhile chop up your zucchini, mushrooms, and tofu, if using. Size is what you prefer. You can put them through a food processor if you are running short on time or better yet, pass this job to your lowly sous-chef.",
      "When the onions are nearly softened, add the chopped veggies (and tofu) to the saucepan.",
      "Once the vegetables are somewhat softened, add the tomato puree, bay leaf, oregano, dried basil, chili powder, salt and pepper. Taste as you go for your preference in saltiness and spiciness. Remember, ambitious guests can always add more spice at the table.",
      "Bring the tomato sauce to a simmer and then keep it aside on a very low heat.",
      "Now create the bechamel sauce. Melt the butter into a saucepan and then slowly add the flour, stirring constantly as you go.",
      "Once the butter and flour are blended, slowly add the milk, again stirring as you do.",
      "Now add the softened goat cheese to the mixture and stir until blended. Spice the sauce with salt, pepper, and nutmeg to taste. Lastly, let simmer until thickened. Add milk if it thickens too quickly (you want a gravy consistency).",
      "Now you are ready for assembly. Pour a spoonful of sauce onto the bottom of a large (9x13 inch) baking dish (glass or aluminum) to just cover the surface. Then add a layer of lasagna noodles, a layer of sauce, a layer of mozzarella, and then another layer of lasagna. For the next layer, add a thick layer of the goat cheese bechemal sauce. Continue layering, adding in fresh basil leaves as you like in the middle layers. Finish off with a layer of lasagna topped with mozzarella.",
      "Bake about 25 minutes in ? degree oven and serve to great delight.",
      "NOTE: For a more robust tomato sauce, you can use Alan Leonetti's marinara sauce recipe (Recipe #84217), especially if you've made it in advance and frozen it.",
      "NOTE: Variation With Ground Beef: To make a more traditional meat lasagna I follow the same recipe as above but I omit the tofu (of course!) and the goat cheese. I still use the mushroom and courgette/zucchini but I cut back on the amount. I brown the beef in a separate pan and then combine it in the layer of tomato and vegetable sauce. The addition of the courgette/zucchini and mushroom in with the meat it usually a welcome twist!"

      "In a medium bowl, mix butter, brown sugar and cinnamon. Scoop the filling into a small zip baggie and set aside.",
      "In a medium, microwave-safe bowl- heat butter and cream cheese until melted. Whisk together until smooth; whisk in powdered sugar and vanilla extract.",
      "Heat large skillet over medium-low heat. Spray with nonstick spray. Scoop about 3/4 cup batter onto the skillet. Snip the corner of your baggie of filling and squeeze a spiral of the filling onto the top of the pancake. When bubbles begin to appear on the surface, flip carefully with a thin spatula, and cook until browned on the underside, 1 to 2 minutes more. Transfer to a baking sheet or platter and keep in a warm oven until ready to serve.",
      "When ready to serve, spoon warmed glaze onto the top of each pancake.",
      "A few helpful tips: *Keep the heat low or your pancakes might cook up too quickly. Don't flip them until you see those bubbles starting to pop on top. Flip them with a wide spatula so you can grasp the whole thing without batter and filling dripping all over the place!",
      "*If your baggie of filling begins to get too thick, just pop it in the microwave for a few seconds to soften it up again. Same with your glaze."
