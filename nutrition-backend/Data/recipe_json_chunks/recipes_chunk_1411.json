      "Split the dough into two even pieces and form them into disks. Wrap tightly in plastic wrap and place in the fridge for use later. You will only need one half of this recipe for the quiche. The other half can be used at a later date (it stays good in the refrigerator for about 3 days and in the freezer for 6 months).",
      "Next, wash the mushrooms and chop into bite sized slices. I'd suggest slicing in half lengthwise and then slicing.",
      "Heat a small saute pan with the olive oil and add the mushrooms and shallots to it. Saute until the mushrooms are golden brown and the shallots are translucent and shiny.",
      "Add the spinach to the pan and cook until it is just wilted. You can cover the pan to steam it a bit if necessary, then remove from the heat.",
      "Crack the eggs into a large bowl and whisk until scrambled. Add the cream, milk, salt and pepper and whisk until incorporated.",
      "Remove the pie crust from the refrigerator and roll out to 1/4 inch thick.",
      "Place the crust into a pie dish and gently press it into the bottom. Trim the top edge with a sharp knife and pinch up the edges to form a nice crust around the top.",
      "Add the cooled mushrooms, shallots, and spinach to the egg and dairy mixture and mix gently. Then add the shredded Jarlsberg and to the same.",
      "Pour the mixture into the prepared shell. You may have a little extra (you can cook this in the saute pan for a little snack if you wish).",
      "Place the quiche in the oven for 50-60 minutes at 350 degrees, checking on it every so often so the crust doesn't burn.",
      "When done, the center of the quiche should be set and the crust golden brown."

      "Place the flours and eggs in a blender and mix until smooth. All the flour should be incorporated into the eggs. With the blender running, slowly add in this order, the milk, then the water, butter, and salt. Stir in the chives and move the blender container to the refrigerator for at least 1 hour or up to 2 days. I let mine sit in the frig for 3 hours. The theory here is that this allows the flour to completely absorb the liquids; the batter thickens up a bit; and all this helps the batter to hold together better and not tear so easily when making the crepes. The consistency you're ideally looking for is just a little thinner than the consistency of whipping cream.",
      "Lightly butter a hot non-stick pan with a basting brush. I used a 10' skillet, but I've also used a more traditional 6\" skillet. Two important things here: it should be non-stick; and the sides of the pan should slope to make it easy to flip the crepe.",

      "The batter should make 10 crepes in a 10\" pan and can all be made ahead. I interleaf them with wax paper, slip into a zip lok, folding them in half if neccessary and throw (gently) into the refrigerator. Then I just nuke them for about 7 seconds to warm them back up before I fill them. They also freeze great too!",

    "title": "huevos rancheros (country-style eggs topped with pork and green chile)",
    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "First, roast the chiles. If you have a gas stove, roast each pepper over an open flame, right on the stove grill until nicely charred on all sides. I use the broiler since my stove is electric. Cover a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Place peppers on baking sheet. Broil peppers about six inches from heat element, turning as needed, until peppers are blackened on all sides. Remove baking sheet from oven and put peppers in a large bowl. Cover with a kitchen towel and let sit for twenty minutes, letting peppers continue to steam. Take 2/3 of the peppers out of the bowl, and carefully remove stem and skin from each pepper. Make a cut about 1/3 of the way down each pepper and remove as many seeds as possible. A spoon or a paper towel is a good tool for this. If a few seeds are left, that's okay. Chop peppers into very small dice and set aside.",
      "Now cook the ribs. Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Put a wire rack over foil-covered baking sheet that you used to roast peppers. If ribs have not been sectioned yet, slice them carefully between the bones. Put ribs on wire rack and roast in oven until browned and nicely caramelized (about 20-25 minutes). Because you are roasting the ribs on a rack, you shouldn't need to turn them. However, feel free to turn them if they look like they are getting too browned on one side. Remove from oven.",
      "Next step is to saute your aromatics. Add butter to a large dutch oven. Turn heat on stove to medium low. Once butter has melted, add onions to pan and saute until golden and nicely caramelized. Add garlic to pan and stir. Once you can really smell the garlic aroma (after about a minute), take off heat. Remove garlic and onion mixture from pan and put in medium size bowl. Set aside.",
      "Now on to browning the rest of the pork. Put flour into a flat dish (a pie pan is perfect). Add pork stew meat to flour and stir with a spoon or your hands until evenly coated. Add two teaspoons oil to dutch oven and warm oil over medium heat. Working in batches, add flour-coated pork to pan, being careful not to crowd the pan. You want the pork to fit in a single layer. After one side has nicely browned and caramelized, carefully turn pork. Once the second side is looking golden and has a nice crust, remove pork from pan and let drain on paper towel or a wire rack. Continue sauteing pork, adding two teaspoons oil to each batch if needed, until all pork has been cooked. When pork has cooled, dice into 1/2 inch pieces.",
      "Time to cook the chile: Put pork stew meat, pork ribs, onion and garlic mixture, two thirds of the diced chiles, oregano and tomatoes into the dutch oven. Add half of the broth and half of the water. Turn heat on burner to medium and let mixture come to a boil. Then turn heat down to medium low and let chile cook at a medium simmer. It should start to thicken, resembling a thick soup or stew, after about 15-20 minutes. Once it has thickened, gradually add remaining water and broth. If chile still looks too thick, add extra water if needed. If chile looks too thin (it should not look watery), remove about 1/2 cup chile broth from dutch oven and place in small bowl. Add one tablespoon cornstarch to bowl and whisk until cornstarch has dissolved. Slowly add cornstarch-chile mixture to dutch oven, stirring periodically until chile has thickened.",
      "Fine-tuning the chile: After about a half an hour of cooking, add salt. Then taste the chile. Add more salt if needed. If the chile is not spicy enough to your liking, add reserved diced peppers a spoonful at a time. Peppers can be unpredictable as far as heat goes, so it is impossible to give exact amounts here. Also everyone's chile pepper tolerance is different. I always try to be conservative. You can make a chile hotter, but you can't remove heat if it is too hot in spice! Continue to let chile simmer for another fifteen minutes, then taste again if you added additional peppers. If it still doesn't seem spicy enough and you want to up the heat another notch, then peel, seed and chop remaining peppers in bowl, and add them to the chile. Continue to cook chile. Total cooking time for the chile should be 45 minutes to 1 hour.",
      "If you are planning not to serve the chile right away, put in container and refrigerate, preferably overnight. The next day remove thin layer of fat on surface of chile. Put chile back in Dutch Oven to warm while you prepare the eggs. If you want to serve chile immediately, spoon any noticeable fat off surface of chile. Keep heat on low and let chile continue to simmer while you get the eggs ready.",
      "First, poach the eggs: Preheat oven to 300 degrees. Bring a pan of water to a simmer over medium low heat. I find that a pan with shallow sides works best for poached eggs; however make sure that the sides of the pan are deep enough so that the poaching water will completely cover the eggs. When water is gentlu simmering, add vinegar. If water starts to get hotter than a gentle simmer, lower heat, if needed.",
      "Crack eggs one at a time in small shallow dish, being careful not to break the yolks. Gently slide each egg into simmering water. I usually use a spoon and gently spoon egg white over each yolk, so that the yolks don't cook too quickly. I poach eggs using the Julia Child method. Usually four minutes of poaching yields a perfect egg -- firm white and cooked, but runny yolk. Start testing each egg at about 3 1/2 minutes. Gently lift egg with slotted spoon and slightly jiggle. If egg white seems firm and yolk doesn't look quivery, egg is done. Remove from water with slotted spoon, and using paper towel or kitchen tiowel, gently dry egg. Repeat this process with other eggs.",
      "Get tortillas ready: While eggs are cooking, heat tortillas. Lay tortillas flat, one at a time, directly on oven rack. Remove tortillas after about three miinutes. You want them to be just beginning to puff slightly, but the tortillas should still be soft, not crisp.",
      "Now at last you are ready to plate! Get four plates ready. For each diner, fold one tortilla over and place on plate. Put one or two poached eggs in the middle of the tortilla. Spoon warm chile all around the egg(s), covering most of the tortilla. Top chile with cheese. Sprinkle cilantro on egg(s). If your guests don't mind bones, put one rib on the plate -- otherwise save ribs for a cook's treat. Don't forget to dollop a small spoonful of chile sauce onto the rib. Continue to plate the other huevos rancheros. Call your guests immediately to the table, and pass around a bowl of extra chile and additional warm tortillas.",

    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "Choose your pan and how many chicken thighs you will be making. The quantities of the ingredients in this recipe heavily depend on the size pan you have available. Something wide with straight shallow sides like you would make paella in is best after that any heavy skillet or cast iron pans you own will work, the pan I use fits 6 chicken thighs from the Butcher shop (they are a little smaller than the ones in the grocery store). The thighs will shrink as they cook so it is okay if some skin is overlapping to start, but don't pack them in so much that the meat/bones are touching.",
      "Thoroughly dry the chicken, especially the skin side. Separate the skin from the meat a little at the thickest part, but do not detach the skin.",
      "Season the skin side of the chicken. A hearty pinch of salt for each thigh, if you would like to add other seasonings add a few dashes now. Two optional seasonings I use often are hot paprika with mustard powder OR a dusting of poultry stuffing seasoning.",
      "Place chicken skin side down in your pan and place on a burner over low to medium low heat. Render the fat in the skin as slowly as possible for the crispiest result. A slow render will also allow the skin to release from the pan better as well. Season the meat side of your chicken now with a little bit more salt, ground black pepper, and more optional seasoning if using.",
      "Once you start to hear some sputtering and see the skin moving as it renders, approximately 5 minutes, turn on the oven to 350degrees F. Since starting in a cold dry pan is the most important step to a crisp render (just like the best bacon) turning the oven on before this step could result in a lesser end product.",
      "Flip the chicken thighs. I usually start trying after 15-20 minutes. Once the skin has rendered most of it's fat it will release itself from the pan. So if you are getting any resistance try to pull the skin up it is not quite done, this requires patience.",
      "Once you have all of your pieces flipped over so that they are now skin side up in the pan turn off the burner and place your pan in the oven. (The oven is not strictly necessary, you could finish cooking the chicken on the other side over the burner and in fact it is faster that way. But personally, I hate cleaning up schmaltz splatter and it really gets everywhere when I'm cooking enough for the whole family. So I finish in the oven to get a more even result among the individual thighs and make clean-up easier.)",
      "Your chicken will be done after about 30 minutes in the oven. Pierce with a knife and see if the juices run clear or if you are a stickler for health and safety reccomendations checck with a thermometer at the thickest point to see if it is at 165degrees F. If you are unsure if it is fully cooked leave it in 10 minutes longer, since it is cooking slowly in it's own fat it is unlikely to get dry or rubbery in that amount of time.",
      "Serve with a salad and crusty bread in the summer or risotto and roasted vegetables in the winter, or, you know, whatever pleases you.",
      "Variation: A couple of times I have stuffed mashed potatoes between the skin and meat before seasoning and cooking. I got the idea from Edward Lee in his book Smoke & Pickles (he uses mashed potatoes to insulate the breast meat in a whole roast chicken). I put about 1/4 of potatoes in each and just cook as usual. It is a little harder to judge doneness, but has that extra little \"wow factor\" if you're looking for a home-style dinner party entree."

I like to roll the dough with my very lightly oiled hands on my marble pastry board that I've swiped with a lightly oiled paper towel, so the dough has a little tackiness and resistance to roll smooth, but doesn't stick like crazy. Now, don't squish the balls. Form your hand over it like a cage and start rolling in a circle and roll into a smooth, firm ball.",

      "Just before placing the sheet pan in the oven, very carefully, and using oven mitts, pour 1/2 cup very hot tap water into the cast iron pan that you already set on the bottom rack. Keep your face averted, as the hot steam will billow up, and I do not want you to burn yourself. Immediately place the sheet pan on the baking stone and quickly close oven. After 10 minutes, open the oven door to let the steam out. Total bake time is around 25 - 30 minutes, until tops are a deep golden brown. The bottoms will sound hollow when tapped. Slide rolls, parchment and all, onto a cooling rack. Serve warm.",
      "When completely cool, store leftovers in a freezer zip top bag for up to one day. Freeze for longer keeping. These rolls reheat and crisp up very nicely in a 350 degree F oven.",

Transfer them to a plastic or glass container, cover them, and refrigerate for at least a day. They'll last up to 2 months.",

Pour in the lemon juice and wine (if using) and stir until completely absorbed. Begin adding the warm chicken stock, starting with 2 healthy ladles, stirring frequently until its mostly absorbed. I begin adding more stock when I can draw my spoon through the rice and it holds a line for a few seconds. Add the stock, a couple ladles at a time (I equate it to 3/4 c. or so), stirring slowly, looking for a soft simmer. If you cook the risotto to quickly, it will cook unevenly, if you cook it too slowly, you'll end up with mush...an hour later. The entire process should take only 25 - 30 minutes.",
      "Begin tasting the rice after 5 or so cups of the stock have been absorbed. It should be creamy with only a tiny amount of \"bite\". If you've used up all 8 cups of stock, and the rice is still not done, simply add water to finish the process. After the rice is completely cooked remove it from the heat, add the remaining butter, 1 T. lemon zest and cheese and \"mantecatura\". This is the process of stirring vigorously to quickly emulsify the dairy into the rice. It is an essential step in authentic risotto and is responsible for its ultra-silken texture. Check the risotto for seasoning and consistency. It should slowly spread on a plate when served, not stand in a mound. If its too stiff, add a bit more warm liquid.",
      "Serve the risotto IMMEDIATELY with more chile flake and cheese and savor its ultimate powers of comfort.",
      "Tip: Contrary to popular belief, risotto can indeed be cooked ahead of time....sort of. Cook the risotto until its approximately 3/4 of the way done. That means it should be soft on the outside with just a tiny firm core. Spread it out onto a greased sheet pan and cool it down in the refrigerator to stop the cooking. After cooling, store the par-cooked risotto in an airtight container for up to 2 days. Right before service, simply pick up the process where you left off, allowing the rice and stock to warm before proceeding."

    "directions": [
      "In a wide bowl, dissolve the yeast in the water and set aside 10 minutes. Add 50 grams of the flour and combine to create a smooth paste. This is the yeast starter or sponge. Cover with a tea towel and let rest 15 to 20 minutes in a warm spot where it should create plenty of bubbles.",
      "Place the remaining 150 grams of flour into a large, wide bowl. Make a well in the center of the flour and pour in the yeast starter, egg, butter, sugar, and pinch of salt. Combine the ingredients by whisking with a fork from the center outwards, incorporating the flour bit by bit. You want a manageable but soft dough that's not too sticky or too dry (I read many accounts that said they needed to add more water to Ada Boni's recipe; I needed to add more flour). Turn onto a well-floured surface and knead until you have a very smooth, soft elastic ball of dough, about 8 minutes. You can also use a mixer for this procedure.",
      "Place the ball in an oiled bowl and cover with a tea towel. Let rise/rest in a warm place for about 1 hour or until doubled in size.",
      "Carefully turn the ball onto a floured surface, flatten the ball into a rectangle and add the raisins, candied peel, pine nuts, and lemon and orange zests. Roll the dough from the short end. Flatten again and roll from another side. The raisins should be somewhat evenly distributed.",
      "Now divide the dough into 8 even balls (weigh them if you want to be precise and have them come out all the exact same size, roughly 2.5 to 2.8 ounces or 75 to 80 grams each). Rolling them into small oval shapes, place them one by one onto a baking sheet layered with baking paper, leaving plenty of room between each bun. Let them rise for 30 minutes in a warm spot away from drafts, covered with a tea towel.",
      "When ready to bake, preheat the oven to 350\u00b0 F (180\u00b0 C) and cook for 10 to 15 minutes or until puffed and just golden on top and bottom. They should remain soft and fluffy inside.",
      "While they are baking, you can make a quick syrup by boiling 2 tablespoons of sugar in 2 tablespoons of water just until dissolved. Brush this syrup onto the hot buns and let the syrup dry and the buns cool completely before splitting open and filling with freshly whipped cream."

      "Prep for the chillies, peppers and tomatillos:\r\nTo roast. Simply, place the veggies on an aluminium lined cookie sheet. Place under the broiler for five or so minutes. Watch carefully because this process is quick. When the skins on top, crackle and turn brown and almost black, turn the veggies green side up and repeat. Continue until your veggies are broiled on all sides. Remove from oven and immediately place into a large glass bowl and quickly cover with a layer of aluminium foil or plastic wrap. The steam from the hot veggies will help the skins separate. Let cool, approximately 15 minutes. Under cool, running water, pull the stems from the tops of the chillies and peppers and peel the skin away. Make sure to wash away all of the seeds, as they will give a bitter flavour to your chili; rinse well. For the tomatillos, cut an X shape on the bottom and peel skin away, do not do anything else, all the goodies inside the tomatillo are what you need for your chili.",
      "Salt and pepper the pork roast. Heat the oil in a hot pan or pot, large enough to hold your entire batch of chili. Add the roast and brown on all sides and set aside.",
      "Reduce pan heat to medium-low. Add more oil to the pan if depleted. Add chopped onions and garlic cloves and a dash of salt and saute until soft.",
      "Add water, return the roast back to pan and add bay and oregano. Add all chillies and tomatillos. Place on medium-low heat for one hour.",
      "Remove roast from pan. Let cool slightly, then cube roast into 1/2 inch pieces, regardless of done-ness. The pork will later shred on its own. The idea of cubing them into 1/2 inch pieces is to get the pork just the right size for your spoon.",
      "Remove the bay leaves from the pan. Then, puree the liquid with a stick blender or upright blender. If you want a \"finer\" sauce, sieve the puree and then return the sauce to the pan. (this will remove any stray seeds or skins) Add back the roast. And place on medium-low heat.",
      "If desired or needed, add a bit more water. Add in the picadillo seasoning and cumin. Simmer for one hour.",
      "Finally, add the white beans and keep the pan on low heat to incorporate the flavours. At this point, you can leave the chili on the stove for 20 minutes or two or more hours. The more time you give it, the more the pork will fall apart and the flavours will incorporate.",
      "While everything is on the stove, chop cilantro and place in a small dish; the cilantro, avocado and creme fraiche are for garnish and to taste. With the avocado, cube and squeeze a bit of lime juice over the top with a dash of salt. I like to place the creme fraiche in a squeeze bottle but spooning it is just as effective. The Queso Fresco can be served with a spoon. These items are to personalise the chili to each individuals tastes. Put some hot sauce on the table if someone in your house likes really spicy chili!",
      "Just before serving the chili, taste it! Add more cumin, picadillo seasoning, oregano or salt to your taste. Mix in the lime zest just before plating the chili.",
      "Serve while hot! Let everyone personalise with toppings and enjoy! I like mine with a bit of corn bread on the side and served with a beer!",
      "TIP: This is even better the next day! If you want to make this the day before, just put it in the fridge and take it out and heat it for dinner the next night! The FLAVOUR gets even better!"

By removing the fat you prevent flare-ups from the grill plus the mustard and black pepper rub is applied directly onto the meat. After removing the fat take a very sharp, thin bladed knife and make a slice between each of the chops on the underside. Marinate the ribs in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour but preferably several hours before cooking. Baste several times during the marinating process, making sure you get the marinade on both sides and in between each chop. Remove the meat from the marinade and apply the honey mustard and black pepper rub all over it. Throw the used marinade away. Let the rack stand for 30 minutes before cooking while it warms to room temperature. Cover the end of the ribs with aluminum foil so they won't char and spray the cooking rack with oil so the lamb doesn't stick. Heat the grill to 350*F (medium) and place the lamb on the grill, bone side down. Cook for about 10 minutes then flip it over and cook for about 5-7 minutes more or until it is slightly charred. Flip it over again and cook until cooking time reaches 20 minutes or an internal temperature of 140*F for medium rare, 150*F for medium well or 160*F for well done.",

      "To prepare the artichokes, you will need a medium bowl of cool water with half of the lemon juice squeezed in it. Peel away the tough outer leaves of the artichoke one by one until you reach very pale-coloured, tender leaves. Cut the stalk to about 1 inch long and then trim the bottom and stalk. Cut the top pointed half of the artichoke off completely then place the artichokes in the lemon water until you have trimmed all the artichokes this way. One by one, slice the artichoke in half vertically. If there is a fluffy/thistle-like choke, remove it with a teaspoon (or a grapefruit spoon). Slice each artichoke half into quarters and immediately place the artichoke slices in the lemon water. Continue with the rest of the artichokes. Just before using, drain the artichoke slices well (pat dry with kitchen paper if necessary).",

Add the rice and the drained artichokes and toss to coat well in the oil. Let toast in the pan about 2 minutes then pour over the white wine and bring heat up to medium.",

Continue this way, pouring over the stock a little at a time, allowing the rice to slowly absorb, for about 15 minutes or until the rice still has a bit of bite to it.",
      "Add the shrimp to the pan, along with the lemon zest and the rest of the lemon juice, and continue with another ladle of stock and a good stir to release the starch in the rice. Allow some of the liquid to be absorbed for a couple of minutes, but not too much -- as soon as you remove the risotto from the heat, it will absorb even more liquid. And the shrimp, even large ones, only need about 3 minutes.",
      "In total the rice should be cooked after about 17 minutes and there should be a creamy liquid surrounding the rice. Remove from the heat (add a bit more stock or water just before if necessary) and add the knob of butter and toss or stir the butter vigorously to \"mantecare\" the rice -- it creates the creaminess you need to finish off the risotto. Transfer to plates immediately. Serve with some fresh herbs over the top, and if desired, some freshly ground pepper."

Leave in a bowl, covered in cling wrap and in a warm place, for about 30 minutes or until doubled in size. Note: I find active-dry yeast most reliable for this recipe. You could use fresh yeast in the appropriate conversion but try not to use instant yeast here as the proving stage is important. Also, use strong flour (bread flour), rather than soft flours (all purpose or cake flour), as it contains more gluten, making a very elastic dough that will rise well in the oven to create that perfect baba shape.",
      "Place the rest of the flour in a mixer with the ball of dough, then, with the mixer running, add the sugar and the beaten eggs. Keep the mixer on, working the dough for roughly 15-20 minutes or until the dough begins pulling away from the sides of the bowl and is very elastic.",
      "At this point, add the salt and then the butter, chopped into small cubes, one piece at a time, combining well after each addition, which should take another 15 minutes. The dough should become softer and paler. Remove from the mixer, cover the bowl with cling wrap and let the dough rise for three hours in a warm place.",
      "In the meantime, prepare the syrup by placing the citrus rinds in a saucepan with the water and sugar. Bring the boil and when the sugar has dissolved, take the pan off the heat. At this point or when cooler, you can add the rum (don't cook the rum as the alcohol will evaporate - unless you don't want this to be an adult's only dessert!). Set aside, covered, and allow the mixture to infuse until needed.",
      "Prepare the molds by buttering and flouring them well - for traditional baba use individual molds just over 2 inches in height and 2 inches in diameter on top, slightly tapered towards the bottom - a popover pan of similar dimensions works just as well. When the dough has risen, take apricot-sized balls (about 2-2 1/2 ounces each; you can weigh the first one to get an idea) with your hands and place them in the molds (they should fill the moulds by about a third). Leave to rest in a warm place, away from drafts, until the dough forms a dome and rises to the top of the molds.",
      "Bake at 350\u00b0F for about 30 minutes or until the baba has developed a deep golden-brown colour, on the darker rather than the blonder side. Let cool. At this point, you can store the baba in an air tight container for later (in the fridge they keep for a week; they also freeze well for 2 months), or you can proceed with the soaking.",
      "Heat the rum syrup until it is warm, then, off the heat, emerge the baba in the syrup, turning delicately until soaked through. Pull them out with tongs and squeeze the excess syrup out gently then place on a rack over a baking tray to catch any drips. Try to keep the baba vertical, or if on their sides, rotate them regularly so that the syrup soaks through evenly. Brush them with some strained apricot jam (if needed, heat or dilute with a bit of syrup) to give them a bit of shine. The rum syrup itself will keep in the fridge for up to a month.",
      "Just before serving, sprinkle some more of the rum syrup over the top of them and don't be shy about it. If not eating the soaked baba straight away, store them in the fridge in an air tight container for up to 5 days. Bring to room temperature before serving as they are or, if you're feeling indulgent, cut them in half but not all the way to the bottom, pipe pastry cream through the middle and arrange some strawberry slices on top."

Trim the cookies with a knife to smooth the edges. \r\n\r\nPlace the slices 1 inch apart on parchment lined half sheet pans, 12 to a pan. Bake until the edges are firm (the cookies should not brown), 10 to 12 minutes. Cool on the pan 15 minutes to firm up and then transfer the cookies to wire racks to cool completely before storage."

Cook for about three minutes. (the collard will turn a dark shade of green and get a bit softer, but don't cook so long that it gets thin and wilty. You still want a strong, but pliable, sushi wrap) Remove leaf to a bowl of ice water and dip it in to stop the leaf from cooking. When rice is done cooking, remove from heat and fluff with a fork and drizzle a sprinkling of mirin rice seasoning and a dash of brown rice vinegar and add salt to taste (this is an optional step). Keep stirring and allowing steam to release. Adjust seasoning to taste.",

Transfer to a bowl, cover, and set aside for later use. Can be stored in refrigerator if making in advance.",

      "Assembling: Cut the collard green into two equal parts. Lay out flat on a cutting board and pat it dry with a paper towel. Spread a very thin layer of the curried chickpea spread from one end to about three quarters of the way across the leaf. Take a healthy tablespoon or two of the rice and spread it over the layer of chickpea spread creating the base for your sushi roll. Layer the veggies in any way you want about 2 inches from the end of the collard green that has the rice mixture on it. Make them a tidy little pile of veggies, but let a few hang off the sides. I started with 2 slices of the red pepper, then one slice of the sweet potato, then a teaspoon of the beet mixture, topped with carrots, scallions and a small piece of the roasted kale leaf. Sprinkle with a bit of kosher salt and pepper. \r\nWith two hands, fold the end of the leaf over the little pile of veggies, hugging it tightly to the veggie pile. Continue on until you roll right to the end that is just green. Cut into two or three pieces and serve with Indian Spice Dipping sauce. Happy Eating!"

You can make it in any shape you like, just make sure it's not too high, say about two centimeters. Brush a baking tray with oil and put the bread on it. Cover it with the damp cloth and let it rise again until doubled in size. In this second rise you can go back to it twice to push the dough down a bit with the tips of your fingers. This will give it the holes which also add to the focaccia look. This rise is very important; the air that forms in this rise will stay in the bread and make the bread soft.",
      "Preheat the oven to 220C. Drizzle some olive oil on the bread; it will find its way into the holes. Now put the bread in the oven, be very gentle, and don't slam the oven door on it. After 5 minutes turn the heat to 190C and bake until golden brown, for about 15 minutes. When you take it out of the oven, wait a little until you take it from the tray, it can stick, but will be easily removed when cooled down a bit. Let it cool down further on a rack."

      "Warm the milk and oil in a pot over low heat until lukewarm but not hot. It should feel comfortable to the touch. Remove from heat and pour into a bowl. Sprinkle the yeast over top the liquid and let sit for 8-10 minutes.",
      "Sift together flour, salt, and sugar. Trickle the yeast liquid slowly into the flour, mixing with a spatula or chopsticks as you go. (You can also just alternate between pouring and stirring.) Once all the liquid has been poured in, knead for 10-15 seconds until dough comes together.",
      "Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead again until smooth, at least 4-5 minutes. Place the dough in a large, greased bowl, cover, and let sit for 1-2 hours, or until doubled in size. I prefer a slower, cooler rise, but you can do whatever you're used to.",
      "While it's rising, decide whether you'd like to make plain mantou or stuffed baozi. If you're going the filling route, this is the time to mix together your filling of choice (red bean paste, yellow egg custard, pork and vegetable, char siu, etc.). Either way, once the dough has doubled in size, punch down the risen dough. Turn onto a floured surface again and knead for just a few strokes. If the dough is too sticky, add more flour.",
      "If making plain mantou with no filling",
      ": Divide the dough into two or three pieces and roll into long logs about an inch in diameter. Cut the dough into inch-wide pieces. At this point, you can let the dough proof again if you like, but it's not really necessary. Skip to Step 7.",
      "If making baozi",
      ": Pinch or cut off a ping-pong ball size piece of dough and roll into a flat circle of dough about 3 inches in diameter. Place about a tablespoon of the filling of your choice into the circle and fold the dough up around the filling, pinching and pleating in a concentric circle until the top is sealed. It doesn't have to be perfect -- you can always place it seam-side down for a smooth and uniform top. In my experience, a thinner dough is easier to pleat -- but, of course, will result in a thinner bun. Place the finished buns on a baking sheet and cover with a damp towel to avoid drying out as you fold the others. You can let the buns proof again at this point if you like, but I find that the second rise is somewhat built into the process -- since pleating the buns takes some time, the buns I prepare first have usually had time to rise again by the time I've finished pleating the last ones. On top of that, you'll likely have to steam these in several batches, so that the buns you prepare last will have proofed by the time the first ones have steamed.",
      "When you're ready to steam the buns, line your basket or steaming tray with a circle of parchment paper. Place the folded buns at least two to three inches apart inside the tray. They will expand significantly, so give them room. I only steamed about three or four per tray.",
      "Fill a wok (or pot, or rice cooker, depending on what you're using) with about an inch or two of water and bring the water to a simmer over medium heat.",
      "After",
      "the water has begun to simmer, set the basket over the water, covered, and steam for about 15 minutes, or until buns are resilient when touched and filling inside is cooked. Make sure to refill the water between batches, as it will likely boil dry. You may also need to adjust the heat to low as the water boils -- a low simmer is all you need."

Continue to mix for another 20 seconds, or until the dough comes together. It will still be slightly crumbly. Push the dough into a ball, wrap it in wax paper, and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, and up to 3 days. The dough can be wrapped and frozen at this point.",

Cut the dough in half, and lay one half between two sheets of wax or parchment paper dusted with rye flour. Roll the dough as thin as you can get it, ideally 1/8 inch. It will still be slightly crumbly, but just press it back together and keep rolling. Use a pizza wheel, jagger, or knife to cut 2x3-inch rectangles. Use a spatula to separate the rectangles from the wax paper and set them on a lightly greased baking sheet. The crackers won't spread, so they can be quite close. Re-roll any scraps and repeat-then repeat again with the second half of the dough.",

Bake for 15 to 20 minutes, or until just starting to brown at the edges. Cool on a wire rack. The crackers are great out of the oven, but their flavor and texture improves the next day."

      "If you are total cro-magnon you can make this with mortar and pestle. If not, a good blender, something on the order of KitchenAid, makes a fine aioli. Chop the garlic and place it in your blender with the egg and kosher salt. Depending on your blender speed, hit \"mix\" first. Stop, and then with speed set at \"stir\" gradually drizzle the olive oil in through the cap at the top of your blender. This will take a minute or so before it becomes mayonnaise.",
      "Spoon the aioli into a bowl. Using a fork beat in the pimenton and pinch of saffron threads. Set aside at room temperature until ready to use.",
      "Using the \"crinkle\" edge of the mandolin blade, slice the sweet potato, as many slices as you desire.",
      "Heat the oil to about 370?, checking temperature with a candy thermometer.",
      "Work in batches. Place the waffle sliced sweets in the web of a spider (hah!) and deposit into the hot oil which will bubble up immediately. The slices will float to the top. Watch them to make sure that they don't burn. Scoop them out in a single batch with the spider and lay the spider and its contents on a rack to rest for two to three minutes. Promptly return them to oil to finish, about 1 minute more. Watch like a hawk.",
      "Scoop out the slices again, and depending on how you are presenting, place them on a plate, in a bowl or whatever lined with paper, parchment or naked. Season with fleur de sel and parsely if using.",
      "Repeat with remaining slices, first rechecking the temperature of the oil.",
      "Serve with your preferred condiment.",
      "Note to cook: I prefer to use leaf lard, which I render in a cast iron skillet. The skin makes nice cracklings and leftover lard can be refrigerated indefinitely and used for pastry. Manteca is an acceptable but not necessarily desirable alternative. It has a pretty strong aroma along the lines of tortilla chips."

Take a medium bowl an add oat flour, white spelt flour, coconut sugar, baking powder & few punches of sea salt in it. Mix well with a spoon. Now, pour your liquid coconut oil in it & mix well with a spoon. Take a medium-sized oven baking dish & smear it in with vegan butter. Line it with baking paper, on all side.

When it is a bit cooled down, place it, on the wire rack, into the fridge to cool down completely! When the cookie base is completely cool, make your topping. Take a medium bowl & add vanilla seeds. Pour coconut milk on it & mix with a smaller whisk. Whisk it all together. Now, add maple syrup & mix well again. Take a bowl for au-bain-marie & place coconut oil & cacao butter in it. Put the heat on low & let your coconut oil & cacao butter melt gently, until completely liquid. Stir often with a spoon or whisk.",

Then, test with your fingers & touch the topping. It must be firm. See that under the topping is not liquid anymore! Maybe, you can speed up the process by putting them in a freezer safe bowl into the freezer! I think that that may work! Now, take it out of the fridge & remove it all from the oven dish & carefully out of the baking paper. Place the thing on a large chopping board & cut with a sharp knife into bars or into whatever shape you want, it is up to you! :) I had 11 good -sized bars! Enjoy after being in the fridge, after 5 to 10 minutes just like that or with a good vegan cafe latte or with some coconut tea! ;) MMM! :) Store them in a cookie box into the cold fridge!!!"

      "Add the milk, beaten eggs, oatmeal, salt and honey to the bowl with the potato flour and water. Mix well. It will look like a bit like a cake batter with flecks of oatmeal.",

      "Using the back of your spoon, make a hole in the middle of the dough and drizzle in most of the melted butter. Then drizzle the rest of the butter over the rest of the dough. Using your spoon, work the butter into the dough. It shouldn't take long, or be difficult. You just want to incorporate it. The dough will be kind of slick.",
      "Oil or butter the bowl or box in which you plan to refrigerate the dough. Put the dough in it, turn it over to coat all of it, then cover. I use a large plastic storage box, but you can a large piece of \"press and seal\" wrap over a bowl that's about twice the size of the dough. Put in the refrigerator immediately and keep it there at least overnight.",
      "BAKING: Remove from the refrigerator as much dough as you plan to use, at least two hours before you plan to begin baking it. This dough will hold for about a week.",
      "Mrs. Rombauer says that no kneading is required, at all, for this bread. I enjoy kneading, so once I'm ready to shape the rolls, I give the dough a few good turns on the counter and then let it sit for about 5 minutes to relax the gluten before dividing it up into rolls. The dough tends to be very sticky, so I flour my hands generously, and sprinkle more on the counter, both before I give it that quick knead, and while I'm shaping the rolls.",
      "Decide how many rolls you want to make, and then divide it evenly into the desired number of pieces. I usually shape the dough into a ball and then divide into wedges using my sharpest bench scraper. Roll the small pieces into balls, pulling the dough gently around the sides and down into the bottom, giving it a little pinch to hold the ball together.",
      "Place the balls of dough in a buttered baking pan. For large rolls, I like to use a springform pan, but you can also use one rectangular or two square baking dishes or 9 inch cake pans. We like medium sized rolls, so I usually divide the dough between two Pyrex 8 inch square pans, with nine rolls each.",
      "Cover with a floured tea towel and let the rolls rise for 20 - 30 minutes (less if your kitchen is warm, as they'll rise more quickly). Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.",
      "Brush with butter or olive oil; bake for 20 to 25 minutes, depending on how large the rolls are, how efficient your oven is, etc. They should be nice and golden brown on top. Remove gently from the pan immediately to let the rolls cool on a rack. Try to let them cool for at least 30 minutes. A couple of hours will make them taste even better.",

      "When the dough has doubled in volume, turn it out onto a floured work surface to deflate, then divide it into two equal-sized pieces. Shape the fan-tans as follows: Roll one piece of dough to an approximately 9- by-13-inch rectangle. If the dough seems springy, let it rest a while before continuing. Spread on a thin layer of the garlic-herb butter, then scatter a handful of cheese over the dough. Cut the dough into 6 strips crosswise and stack the strips. Trim the ends of the stack, if necessary. Cut the strip into 12 even pieces and place each piece, cut side showing, in a well-greased, light-colored muffin tin (to avoid over-browning on the bottoms). Cover with plastic wrap and let rise again for 20 to 30 minutes. While the dough rises, heat the oven to 375\u00b0 F. Before placing in the oven, brush the tops of the rolls with a little more softened butter. Bake for 15 to 18 minutes, or until handsomely golden brown.",
      "If you prefer, shape the dough into crescents: Roll out one piece of dough to an approximately 12-inch circle. Spread with a thin layer of garlic-herb butter. Cut the dough into 16 wedges and roll each, from the wide end into a crescent shape. Place on a parchment-lined baking sheet, with the point of each roll tucked securely underneath. Sprinkle some shredded cheese over top of each roll, cover loosely with plastic, and let rise for about 20 minutes. When puffy and light, place in the preheated oven and bake until golden brown, about 15 minutes.",
      "If you have any garlic-herb butter leftover, spread it on the warm rolls when you serve them. To freeze the rolls, let them cool completely and place in freezer bags. Warm the frozen rolls in a 325\u00b0 F oven to heat and refresh them."

      "Cool the nuts to touch and break any large pieces up as necessary. Store in an airtight container for up to a week.",
      "Prepare the quince by washing well, halving from top to bottom, and scooping the seeds/core out with a melon-baler. Slice once more to quarter each quince then place in a bowl of water with a the lemon juice (to prevent discoloration) until all the fruit is prepared.",
      "Bring the 1.75 cups of water, sugar, lemon peel and any spices you are using to a boil in a medium, heavy saucepan over a medium high flame.",
      "Add the prepared quince quarters and let the mixture come back to a gentle boil.",
      "Reduce the heat to low. Cover the pot and barely simmer the quince until it's tender, about 1.5 hours. When it's done a knife should pierce without any resistance and the liquid should be a lovely pinkish-red color. The lower heat and longer cooking time helps bring out the color of the fruit, so be patient.",
      "At this point you can continue making the sundaes or save the syrup and fruit for later use (see step 12). For immediate consumption, first turn off the heat for a few minutes, cooling the fruit slightly, and transfer the fruit, spices and about 1 cup of liquid to a covered container. Return the remaining liquid (about 3/4 cup) to the stove and boil gently over medium high heat for 3-4 minutes, until the syrup is reduced by slightly less than half. When thick looking and bubbily, turn off the heat and remove from the stove, and get ready to serve. If you allow the reduced syrup to cool completely, it will turn into quince jelly, which is lovely, but not what we're aiming for.",
      "Assemble the sundaes by topping a scoop of good quality vanilla ice cream with some cinnamon-spiced nuts (chopped or crumbled if you like). Finish with a few tablespoons of hot quince syrup and a quince quarter. Serve immediately.",
      "To prepare quince syrup for later use, turn the heat off and allow the fruit and syrup to cool completely. Place the quince and syrup in a clean, clear container and refrigerate, covered, for up to 2 weeks. When you are ready to make the sundaes, either use the cold, thinner quince syrup that the fruit and resting in, or heat and reduce some syrup as described in step 10. Proceed with your sundae-making!"

When the cream is steaming, remove from the heat and very slowly pour it, a tiny bit at a time, into the egg mixture, whisking constantly. I usually put a dishtowel underneath the bowl so that it doesn't move all over the place while I'm whisking with one hand and pouring with the other. The trick in this step is not to cook the eggs- you don't want pieces of cooked egg yolk or white in the custard. If you whisk constantly and pour slowly, you will have no problem with this.",
      "Put 4-6 ramekins or small oven-proof bowls in a deep roasting pan. Divide the egg-cream mixture among them. Pour the boiling water into the pan so that it reaches 1/2-3/4 way up the ramekins.

Cook the custards for about 20-30 minutes (my convection oven usually does it on the faster side), until just set, but still wobbly in the middle. Remove from the oven and use tongs to take the ramekins out of the pan and sprinkle the top of each one with cinnamon and nutmeg. You can eat them as soon as they're cool enough, or cool them completely and keep them in the refrigerator for a day or two. Enjoy! \r\n\r\nP.S. Try topping with raspberries or a drizzle of chocolate, or both! Mark Bittman also recommends adding some crystallized ginger to the mix before baking."

The butter will foam intensely until all of the water evaporates out of the fat. When this happens the temperature will rise, and the milk solids in the butter will caramelize quickly. When the butter reaches a warm chestnut brown, immediately remove from the heat and dump the butter into the bowl. Stir it slowly with a heatproof spatula for a minute or so, to release some of the intense heat. Set aside to cool slightly, while you prepare the other ingredients.",

With the paddle attachment in place, mix on the lowest speed for 1 minute, adding the shortening midway. Stop to add water. Restart on the lowest speed and continue mixing for about 1 minute to form a shaggy ball. Let sit for 5 minutes, uncovered, to hydrate. Lightly oil a bowl for rising the dough. Set aside.",
      "Pull the dough off the paddle, attach the dough hook, and mix on medium-low (speed 2 on a KitchenAid) for 2 minutes, until smooth and medium-firm. The dough should wrap around the hook in the last 30 seconds. If the dough is soft and wraps around the hook early on, add 1 to 2 teaspoons of VWG to stiffen and build structure.",
      "Transfer the dough to an unfloured work surface and briefly knead it into a ball. If the dough feels soft and moist (think perspiration on a humid day), lightly dust the work surface with flour and knead it in. Press the barely tacky, finished dough and it should immediately bounce back yet a shallow indentation should remain. Put it into the oiled bowl, turn to coat, then tightly cover with plastic wrap. Set it in a warm spot to rise for 45 minutes, or until doubled.",
      "CUT, ROUND, AND SHAPE: Uncover the bowl and set the plastic wrap aside to reuse later. Invert the dough onto your work surface. Cut the dough in half. Form each half into a brick shape, then cut crosswise into 3 pieces to yield 6 pieces total.",
      "To round each dough piece, use both hands to cup it, then pull, tuck, and gather the edges toward the center to form a small mound. Aim to create a taut outer surface. Put the mound, seam side down, on your work surface, then loosely cover with the saved plastic. Let the dough mounds rest and rise for 10 minutes. Line a heavy-duty rimmed baking sheet (I use a half sheet pan) with parchment paper. Set aside.",

      "PROOF AND BAKE: Smear a little oil or use nonstick spray on 2 pieces of plastic wrap (use the saved one plus a new piece), then use them to loosely cover the rolls. Let rise until more than doubled, close to a full rise, which will take about 1 hour at moderate room temperature. If it's a hot day, preheat the oven after shaping the rolls.",
      "Monitor the rolls via these benchmarks: \r\n\r\nAfter 20 minutes of rising, or when most rolls are 2-inches wide, set up the oven for baking. Place a broiler pan or heavy-duty rimmed baking sheet on the oven floor, its rim positioned near the oven edge (you'll be pouring hot water into this pan). Put a rack in one of the lower positions, about 5 inches from the water pan, leaving space to later safely pour water into the pan. Place a baking stone (or inverted heavy-duty rimmed baking sheet) on the rack. Preheat to 475\u00b0 F. \r\n\r\nAt 45 minutes, or when the rolls have nearly doubled, remove the plastic wrap. Let the rolls dry and finish rising for 10 to 15 minutes. Meanwhile, bring some water (about 1 cup) to a boil, then lower the heat to keep hot. Find a 1-quart measuring cup or similar vessel to later pour hot water into the pan in the oven. Partially fill a spray bottle with water. Set aside. \r\n\t\r\nAround the 1 hour mark, or when the rolls are porpoise-like and 2 1/2 to 2 3/4 inches at the middle, it's time to bake. Pour a good 1/2 cup of hot water into the pouring vessel. Set near the stove.",
      "To slash each roll, hold a sharp knife nearly horizontal to the roll surface and make one angled cut on the midline. Mist the rolls 5 or 6 times with the spray bottle. Slide the baking sheet onto the stone, carefully pour water into the pan on the oven floor, then close the door. Lower the heat to 425\u00b0 F and bake for 22 to 24 minutes, or until golden brown and hollow sounding when thumped on the bottom crust.",
      "When the rolls are light golden, usually after baking for 15 minutes, rotate the pan and/or shift the rolls to expose them equally to the oven temperature variation. (If the rolls achieve that color after baking for only 10 minutes, lower the temperature to 400\u00b0 F.)",
      "When done, turn the oven off. Let the rolls further crisp and brown in the oven for 8 to 10 minutes. Cool on a rack for about 45 minutes before eating. The sides will slightly soften. If the rolls are a little flat, don't fret because you'll be filling them to a beautiful plumpness. Use the rolls as is or reheat to a shattering crispness, per the master banh mi recipe."

    "title": "wow!  who made the gravy?",
    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "Making a stock is the most important part of making a gravy. Yes, you can buy prepared or canned stock. Don't! Pick a Saturday afternoon when you will be home catching up on cleaning, or replacing the back patio decking, and make your own. It's easy. It just takes time.",
      "Place the cleaned chicken carcasses, onions, and carrots in a roasting pan. For genuine \"Thanksgiving Turkey Gravy\" stock, add the two turkey wings. Place in a 375 degree oven for about an hour. Your nose will tell you when its done. The carcass bones should be caramel brown.",
      "Place the roasted carcasses, onions and carrots with the celery and thyme in a large stock pot and cover the contents with water. After the water simmers, add a tablespoon of salt, and the bay leaves and peppercorns. (Salting before the water boils can pit your pots). Simmer uncovered all day long (at least four hours), until the volume is reduced by about half.",
      "Remove from stove, remove the chicken carcasses. When you can handle the pot, strain the stock by pouring through a colander draped with cheese cloth, or a chinois if you have one. (If you have a chinois you already know how to do this.)",
      "Cool the stock. If the temperature allows (below 40), I place my strained stock, in the stock pot, out on the back porch. Make sure that the bears have denned up for the winter or you may have company. (In Brooklyn this is not a problem) Refrigerators work well for this part of the process too.",
      "A layer of fat will form on the top of the stock when it cools. Remove it with a slotted spoon. Place the stock in leftover containers and freeze for future use.",
      "Warm two quarts of stock on the stove and reserve for use.",
      "In a sauce pan over medium heat, melt the butter and stir in the flour with a wooden spoon. Cook the roux for a few minutes until it begins to turn brown. Roux means reddish brown in French. Make it so. Raw flour, either from an undercooked roux, or added directly to gravy, tastes like raw flour, and is probably the reason that you are looking for a new gravy recipe.",
      "When the roux is properly browned, ladle a cup of warmed stock into your sauce pan. The resulting contents will literally burst into a thick bubbly gravy, which at this point is too thick to use. Continue ladling stock to the gravy until it is a little too thin for your liking. (P.S. I gave up long ago on trying to add turkey \"drippings\" or \"browned bits\" from the roasting pan. Typically the drippings are rendered fat and the bits are sitting in fat. With a proper stock as a base, you will have plenty of flavor.)",
      "Simmer for ten minutes until it reduces slightly in volume. Salt and pepper to taste. Add some sliced sauteed mushrooms for a nice finish. (Optional) Serve with your grandmother's stuffing recipe and try to look humble."

These days recipe drafters skip the scalding step; they'll tell you that it's not necessary, because all milk is safe now without scalding. What they don't realize is that there are compounds in milk that cause yeast not to function at its best; scalding the milk neutralizes their effect, thus producing a better loaf.",
      "A Note about Potato Flakes: It's no secret that potato gives bread a lovely texture. The beauty of the flakes is that, unlike with leftover mashed potatoes, you (a) don't have to wait until you have leftover mashed potatoes, or otherwise cook some up, to make a loaf of potato bread; and (ii) you don't have to worry about getting the salt right, or whether you've estimated the liquids correctly. (Potatoes and the liquids used in mashing them vary considerably from batch to batch, depending on the moisture of the potatoes themselves, how much cooking water has been poured off, etc.) That never stops me from using leftover mashed potatoes if I have them, because I have enough experience to correct any mistakes by adding more liquid or flour as necessary during the kneading process, and to avoid over salting. That said, I love the convenience of potato flakes, and potato flour, which is now available in bulk in many stores that sell wheat and other flours in bulk.",

Move the pan back into the freezer to harden, at least 8 hours to overnight.",

Stand the ear up on a flat side (cut it flat if need be) and hold the top of the ear with your hand while sawing downwards to cut off the corn. This will give you about a half cup of corn kernels. Place it aside until ready for use.",
      "INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\nPre-heat your oven to 180 degrees Celsius (350 Fahrenheit).\r\n\r\nPlace the pattypan in the oven and let it cook for 35-40 minutes.\r\n\r\nI place my mushrooms in the oven at the same time. It cooks more or less about the same time.\r\n\r\nRoast the pattypan and mushrooms in the oven while starting the risotto (cook time is about 30 min).\r\n\r\nIn a large pan, heat up some olive oil over medium heat and then add the onions. Cook them for about 10 minutes. Do not brown them!\r\n\r\nAdd the risotto rice and stir with a wooden spoon. Move it around until the rice turns translucent.\r\n\r\nAdd the white wine. It will sizzle and it should start to evaporate. Continuously stir the rice (patience is the key to making risotto). Apparently, stirring releases its starch which gives it the creamy factor.\r\n\r\nAs the rice starts to dry up, add a ladleful of simmering stock and continue to stir. When it starts to thicken up and get starchy, add another ladleful of stock and stir slowly.\r\n\r\nKeep repeating this process until the rice is cooked. Most or all of the stock will have been used.\r\n\r\nWhen it is cooked, add some lemon zest, stir in the butter and then the Parmesan cheese.\r\n\r\nTake the roasted mushrooms and combine it with the risotto. Add the corn kernels and stir.\r\n\r\nPlace the cooked pattypan on a serving dish or individual plate.\r\n\r\nTake a spoon and scoop the flesh around in the pattypan.\r\n\r\nFill the patty pan with the risotto while mixing in the flesh inside the patty pan.\r\n\r\nAdjust with black pepper.\r\n\r\nGarnish with a little sprig of parsley and serve."

Pulse a few times to blend.\r\n\r\n Add the butter pieces and pulse just until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. \r\n\r\nAdd the egg yolks, vanilla and zest and pulse a few times to blend.\r\n\r\nAdd the milk and pulse until a soft dough forms but still has coarse crumbs; pinch to see if the dough holds together. Add more milk if too dry.\r\n\r\n Turn the dough out on a lightly floured surface. Push into a ball and knead a few times. Form into a flat disk, wrap in plastic and refrigerator for 1 hour or overnight. Makes one 14\" galette or one 12\" tart pastry.",
      "MAKE THE APPLE FILLING: To a large mixing bowl, add the lemon juice. Peel, core and cut each apple into 8 slices; toss in the lemon juice. Repeat with the remaining apples. Toss in the brown sugar, cinnamon, allspice, nutmeg, cornstarch, vanilla and salt. Drain excess juices before adding to the pastry",
      "PUT IT ALL TOGETHER: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Line a 1/2 sheet pan with parchment paper. On a lightly floured surface, roll out the chilled dough to a 14\" circle. Put the scraps aside for cutouts to decorate the top. Transfer the pastry to the parchment lined sheet pan (it will hang over temporarily). I use a 16\" pizza pan with parchment paper cut to fit. \r\n\r\nMound the apples in the middle of the dough leaving about a 3\" border. You can also arrange them, domino effect, in a circle. Fold the dough over the apples leaving a circle of apples exposed in the middle. Pinch the dough in pleats to flatten. It does not have to be perfect, the pastry cutouts will cover. Reroll the scraps and cut out into seasonal shapes. Stars are great for Holiday season, leaves for Fall. Press on top of the apples and on the dough. \r\n\r\n Finish by sprinkling the top with coarse sugar, cinnamon sugar or vanilla sugar. Bake about 45 minutes or until the apples are bubbling and the pastry is golden brown. Serve warm with vanilla ice cream or freshly whipped cream."

Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until mixture comes just to a boil and slightly thickens. Remove from heat and add vanilla, lime zest & rum. Refrigerate for 2 hours or until well-chilled.",

      "In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, slowly whisk whites and salt until slightly foamy. Add cream of tartar, and gradually increase the speed to high. Add sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time, until meringue is stiff; lower speed and add vanilla, whisking until combined.",

Transfer to a wire rack, and cool completely; meringue will deflate as it cools. Invert into a shallow serving bowl, and chill until ready to serve.",
      "FOR THE CARAMEL SYRUP:\r\nIn a small stainless steel saucepan, with tall sides, mix sugar and the 6 tbsp water until mixture feels like wet sand. Brush down any stray sugar crystals with wet pastry brush. Turn on heat to medium high flame and cook until dark amber, swirling the pan every now and then. Cook until you achieve the color you want like dark amber. When color is achieved, I like to lower heat; and then I put on top of the saucepan a big piece of aluminum foil with a small cut in the middle into which you will carefully pour in 3/4 cup of water. Whisk over medium heat for exactly 3 minutes. You may think the syrup is still too liquidy but don't worry; it will become thicker as it cools. However, it will always remains pourable. No need to ever warm it up to thin out the caramel. Will make about 1 cup + 2 tbsp caramel syrup. I like to store it in the fridge and remove from fridge 30 minutes or 1 hour before using.",
      "To Serve:\r\nPour enough Creme Anglaise over and around the meringue so that the meringue looks like it is floating. Drizzle some of the caramel syrup over the meringue. Keep leftover Creme Anglaise and caramel syrup for those that want more."

      "Add the vanilla, egg, ginger, yogurt, salt, and sugar to the yeast. Stir that up a bit, then add a cup of the flour and stir some more. Add a second cup, and keep stirring with your trusty wooden spoon (or other mixing implement of choice). When that's all well-combined, add most of the last half cup of flour, reserving about two tablespoons.",
      "Cut the butter into a few pieces, and add it to your dough. You can mix it in partway with a spoon and some elbow grease, but to truly homogenize the stuff you'll need to get your hands in there and knead it, greasy fingers and all. When the butter's incorporated into the dough (it doesn't take too long, really), form it into a rough ball, put the last two tablespoons of flour in the bowl, and roll the dough around to coat it. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and set it someplace where the dough won't catch a chill. Let it rise until it about doubles in size, 1 1/2 to 2 hours.",
      "When the yeast has almost finished working on that first rise, you can prepare your filling. Put the chopped ginger in a bowl with the sugar, and then chop up your pluots or plums and throw them in. Mix it all together, and let it sit, so the flavors can get acquainted.",
      "Now is also a good time to get your baking sheet ready. Cover a large baking sheet with parchment. That's it. Easy, no? (You really do need parchment here to keep burnt sugar off the tray-don't skip it for greasing and flouring unless you don't mind fighting to get the cake off once it's baked).",
      "Has your dough risen enough? Well, then, it's time to make the roll! Flour your countertop (or table, or cutting board) and drop that dough on top. Pat it out into a rectangle, approximately 10\"x14\". Distribute the pluot/plum pieces and ginger bits over the top, leaving the sugar-and-fruit-juice liquid in the bowl (it's pretty tasty stuff, I must say-try it in a glass of seltzer, maybe?). Dot the fruit with the two tablespoons of butter and then carefully, carefully, roll up the dough with everything inside (direction-wise: you want to end up with a 14\"-long roll of dough).",
      "Use both hands and a great deal of caution to gently shift the roll onto the baking sheet, with the seam side down. Breath a sigh of relief that it didn't all fall apart. Then, arrange the roll in a shallow semicircle. With a clean pair of scissors, slice into the dough at 2\" intervals, leaving about 3/4\" attached towards the inside edge of the curve. Curl the dough a bit more so that the sections separate a bit and the whole thing forms a ring (the ends don't need to meet, though, if they don't want to). Cover the ring gently with a tea towel and leave it for half an hour.",
      "When the half hour is almost up, preheat your oven to 375F. Bake for 30-35 minutes, or until the top is brown and lovely. Let it cool on the tray for at least 15 minutes so the insides get a chance to settle; then, eat!"

Fold this tip far from you. Fold the side tips to the center. Carefully, roll the roll thing far from you, rolling in the farther tip. If the wrapper is opening, use a mixture of 1 tablespoon of flour and 1 tablespoon of water as glue (use very little). Repeat the procedure with the other rolls.",
      "Now it's time to choose your cooking method. You can deep fry them, stir fry or bake. I decided to use the frying pan, which makes the rolls lighter than deep frying and is quicker than baking. Put a drizzle of oil on the frying pan and position the rolls on top. Turn when golden, letting all sides go brown. That's it! Serve them warm, with soy sauce or oyster sauce (mushroom sauce, in my case!)."

Once all the butter is incorporated, add the vanilla and almond extracts and mix to combine. Remove the bowl from the mixer and mix briefly by hand to make sure there are no clumps of butter. If the frosting is a bit soupy (because it was too warm when the butter was added) stick it in the refrigerator for 10-15 minutes, beat it again with the stand mixer. It should come together.",

      "In a mixing bowl combine the Mousa blend and salt. Rub the turkey with the vegetable oil, then rub with the spice-salt mix, making sure to season the interior of the bird. Place the turkey in a large roasting pan, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate overnight.\r\n\r\nThe next day, remove the turkey from the refrigerator and bring it to room temperature, about 1 hour.",
      "Preheat the oven to 325 \u00b0 F, and place the rack in the center of the oven.\r\n\r\nPlace the turkey in the center of a large roasting pan. Scatter the carrots, onions, garlic, rosemary and thyme, then dot the turkey with the butter. Place the turkey in the center of the oven and bake for about 2 1/2 to 3 hours, while basting the bird with the cooking juices in the pan every half hour. After 2 1/2 hours, check the temperature using a meat thermometer. The turkey is done when the internal temperature taken in the thickest part of the breast is 165 \u00b0 F. (If your turkey has a \"built in\" pop-up thermometer, you may choose to trust it. Though a meat thermometer will ensure greater accuracy.)\r\n\r\nRemove the pan from the oven, and allow the turkey to rest 20 to 30 minutes before carving.",
      "Tips and ideas:\r\n\tStrain the cooking juices from the pan and use to make great gravy.\r\n\tSave the leftover meat for making cold turkey sandwiches.\r\n\tMake a spread for sandwiches or to use as a salad dressing, by mixing 1 tablespoon Mousa blend with 1 cup mayonnaise."

      "First and foremost, its very important that we make a \"Flying ferment\" for our focaccia dough, which basically means that we are activating the yeast so that it can help ferment our dough better. \r\nFor this, take the yeast, water part 1 + Sugar part 1 and mix it well. Keep aside for 5 mins. ( Yeast feeds on sugar which helps it to get activated )",
      "Now, sieve the flour on a clean table top and make a well. Sprinkle the salt and sugar part 2 all around the well. Once this is done, add in the flying ferment and start mixing it. Roughly mix it in and break the forming dough in little shards.",
      "Once you have reached this stage, add the water part 2 and start working on the dough. Start to knead the dough, it may seem a bit sticky, but keep working on it until you feel that the dough is soft enough and looks like a homogenous mass with minimum signs of cracking.",
      "Now add the olive oil in the dough and start to knead again, until the olive oil is well mixed in the dough and there are no signs of olive oil marbling the dough ( Which happens when the olive oil is not mixed well & hence starts to give shades of white and yellow ).",
      "Once this is done, form the dough into a round shape & cover it with a damp cloth to start the first fermentation, which would take 45-50 mins. ( As it would ferment, you would observe the dough increasing in size )",
      "After the time is up, carefully remove the cloth as it may stick to the skin of the dough. Start to flatten the dough with the hands, and line it in a baking tray. You can add the garnishes at this stage with some rosemary and pink salt. Now, keep this flattened dough to ferment again, for about 35-40 mins.",
      "As your dough would be in its final fermenting stage, preheat the oven at 180 Degrees and bake the bread for 20-25 mins ( Or until you observe a golden crust forming on the surface of the dough)",
      "Finish this humble bread with loads of olive oil and fresh herbs & enjoy it hot and fresh."

      "Preserved Lemon Recipe: You will need organic lemons, coarse sea salt, paprika and extra-virgin olive oil. Wash and slice the lemons. Put the slices in a colander set over a bowl and sprinkle generously with salt. Leave overnight to drain off the moisture. Layer the lemon slices in a Mason jar and sprinkle each layer with paprika. Fill the jar to almost full, cover with extra-virgin olive oil and place in the refrigerator for about three weeks. They are worth the wait."

      "Rinse under cold water, pat dry, place in a colander and season with the salt. Toss and let stand for 10 minutes. Drain off any water the potatoes have released, transfer them to a tea towel, wrap and gently squeeze to dry off the potatoes again.",
      "Heat the one teaspoon of grapeseed oil in an 8- or 9-inch skillet over high heat until it begins to smoke. Reduce the heat to low, pour out the oil, and wipe out the pan with a paper towel. This process of seasoning the pan will help prevent sticking.",
      "Return the pan to medium heat, and add 1/4 cup of the oil. When the oil is hot and begins to shimmer, pull the pan off the heat and carefully add the potatoes. Return the heat to medium. As soon as you hear the oil and potatoes begin to sizzle, turn the heat down to medium-low. Let cook for a minute or two, pressing the pancake down with a spatula and loosening any potatoes sticking to the edges. If you are only using 2 potatoes, pour 2 tablespoons of oil around the sides of the potatoes. If you are using 3 potatoes, pour 1/4 cup of oil around the sides of the potatoes. Season the potatoes with a pinch more salt. Cook for 10 to 15 minutes (check around 8 or 9 minutes if using only 2 potatoes) at this medium-low heat. Every so often, starting after 6 or 7 minutes, slide a spatula under the pancake and try to loosen it from the bottom and edges and rotate it slightly.",
      "Here's the tricky part: flipping. Once again, slide a spatula around the edges and underneath the pancake to loosen it. Find a plate that fits over the potatoes, ideally one that fits snugly inside the pan. To protect your hand, wrap it in a tea towel or slide on a long rubber glove -- I didn't do either, but oil could drip out and burn you depending on the size plate you are using. With your protected hand, secure the plate into the potatoes, and with the other hand, flip the pan so that the potatoes turn out onto the plate. Slide pancake back into pan. Cook for another 10 to 15 minutes or less if using only 2 potatoes.",

Bring the pot to a boil over high heat and then lower the heat to low, cover, and simmer until the beans are done, 1-2 hours. Test your beans at the one hour mark by eating a few- they should be soft and creamy. When the beans are done, transfer two big ladles of beans and an extra ladle of broth to a blender and blend until smooth. Drain the rest of the liquid off the beans that are still in the pot, and then stir in the blended beans. This will make a creamy sauce for your beans."

Remove the ground salmon to a large bowl, and stir in the capers, bread crumbs, lemon juice, pepper, salt and egg until the mixture is uniform and fully combined. Divide the mixture into 6 oval loaves.",
      "Vegetables:\r\n\r\nWarm the olive oil in a large saute pan or skillet set over medium-low heat. When it is hot add the vegetables and chopped thyme, season with salt and pepper. Cook the mixture, covered, until the vegetables are tender; about 12-15 minutes. Adjust seasoning. This is your last opportunity to do so with these vegetables.",
      "Croute:\r\n\r\nCut six pieces of parchment, slightly larger than your pastry rectangles and lay one out in front of you. Center one rectangle of pastry onto the parchment. Scoop about 1 1/2 tablespoons of the vegetables onto the center of the pastry. Don't use too much because if it gets onto the pastry in areas outside the parameter of the salmon loaf the pastry will be difficult to seal. Lay a salmon loaf on top of the vegetables, again I stress, keep the veggies completely underneath the salmon loaf. Lay another sheet of pastry on top of the salmon loaf. Letting the weight of the pastry be your guide, let the top piece drape over the fish and vegetables, allowing it to meet the bottom piece of pastry with out too much stretching.",
      "Using your fingers gently press the top of the packet until flat and smooth. Then press the dough up against the sides of the loaf sealing it in all around the bottom, right up against the loaf all the way to the edge of the pastry. Use the side of a knife to assure a good tight seal.",
      "Next you have 2 options. You could trim each packet with a 1/2\" lip all the way around making a nice neat oval. Or you could be fanciful and shape each packet into an interesting shaped fish! Use the trimmings to form fins, gills, mouth and eyes. Be as creative as you like. You can even use various tools to form impression into the dough mimicking scales, be careful not to cut all the way through the pastry. Once you are finished shaping and decorating use your fingers to double check the seal all around the edges of the packet.",
      "Brush the surface of the dough with the egg wash, being careful not to let it drip onto the parchment as this would make it difficult to remove after baking. Carefully lift your finished product using the parchment paper to move it to a baking sheet. Place the finished product, baking sheet and all, into the refrigerator while you repeat the process five more times. They may be made ahead to this point up to one day in advance if well covered and refrigerated, though in that case I would reapply an egg wash just before cooking.",
      "To Cook:\r\n\r\nPreheat the oven to 450 degrees F., and bake the fish for 5 minutes. Then lower the heat to 375 degrees F and bake 15 minutes more, or until the pastry is beautifully puffed and richly colored. Make the sauce while the fish cooks.",
      "Sauce:\r\n\r\nWarm the canola oil in a small saucepan set over medium-high heat. Add the shallot, cooking and stirring until the shallot gets soft but does not yet color; about 5 minutes. Pour in the cream and bring to a low boil, then lower the heat to a simmer. Let the mixture cook until it is reduced some and thickened; about 15 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the tomato and chives. Taste for seasoning.",
