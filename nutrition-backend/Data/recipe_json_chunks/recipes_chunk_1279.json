    "directions": [
      "1. PREPARE THE PIZZA DOUGH: In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, salt and yeast. Add the warm water and olive oil and stir with a wooden spoon until the dough begins to come together. It will seem shaggy and dry but that's normal! 2. Transfer the dough to a floured surface and knead for 2-3 minutes. The dough should quickly start to come together and start to get sticky - dust with flour as needed. The dough will be slightly tacky but not sticking to your hands or the surface. 3. Transfer the dough ball to a large bowl coated in a drizzle of olive oil and cover with a kitchen towel or plastic wrap. Allow the dough to rise for 1 hour in a warm, dry area of your kitchen for 2 hours or until the dough has doubled in size. 4. MAKE THE GARLIC-INFUSED OLIVE OIL: Smash two whole garlic cloves to release the garlic flavor and add to the extra virgin olive oil in a medium skillet. Heat the extra virgin olive oil over medium-low heat and cook the oil with the garlic cloves, stirring every couple of minutes. If your garlic starts to brown, turn the heat to low. After 10 minutes, turn off the heat and remove the garlic cloves. Pour the oil in a bowl and set aside. 5. PREPARE THE PIZZA: Place a pizza stone in your oven and preheat the oven to 550 degrees F, or as high as your oven can go. If you don't have a pizza stone, you can stick a large sheet pan in the oven as it is pre-heating. The idea is to have the surface of whatever you are cooking your pizza on to be piping hot! 6. Either cut the pizza dough in half {the recipe makes two 10-12 inch pizzas} or make one large pie {I just made one large pizza in this case}. 7. Stretch out the dough by hand or roll out on a floured surface. If you are baking one large pie, you want the stretched out dough to be 20 inches in diameter. Regarding thickness, the crust can be a bit thicker, but you want the middle of the pie to be as thin as possible. 8. Drizzle the dough with the garlic-infused olive oil. 9. Arrange the potato coins in a single layer on top of the pizza. Sprinkle with the rosemary, red pepper flakes and salt. 10. Break out the breakfast sausage into small pieces and dot the top of the pizza with the breakfast sausage and mozzarella pieces. 11. Place the pizza on the pizza stone and cook for 10-12 minutes or until the dough is cooked through and the toppings begin to get bubbly. 12. Remove the pizza from the oven and crack the egg in the center of it. 13. Put the pizza back in the oven and cook for another 3-5 minutes or until the egg white has just set but the yolk is still runny. 14. Slice and serve immediately."

Turn it over and do the same thing on the other side with the last of the spice mix (you may have leftovers). 4. Using tongs, set pork chops on preheated grill for 3 1/2 minutes, then turn 180\u00b0 to the left or right (this will make sure you get those awesome grill marks) and cook another 3 1/2 minutes. 5. Flip the pork chops over and repeat on the other side. Pork chops in my house are rarely cooked above medium. If you prefer overdone, continue to cook for a few more minutes depending on the thickness of your chops. Juices running clear is NOT a good indication of doneness, but more accurately an indication of OVERdone-ness. Use your fingers and press on the meat, if it is squishy it is still rare to medium rare, slightly springy and it's perfect. No return from the protein? It's well done. 6.

The mixture may appear broken at first but should come together by the final addition of cream to be smooth and glossy. Let cool slightly.

Top with a third layer and repeat the process, alternating with one more layer of ganache and one more layer of marmalade filling, soaking each cake layer well with syrup. Top with the final cake layer, soak with the remaining syrup, and refrigerate until the cake is firm, 1 to 2 hours, then dust with cocoa powder.",

    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "1. Position an oven rack in the lower third of the oven and heat to 325 degrees F (163 C). Line the bottom and sides of an 8-inch (20cm) square baking pan with parchment paper or aluminum foil, leaving an overhang on two opposite sides. (This helps when removing the baked brownies from the pan, once cooled).",
      "2. Add enough water to a medium saucepan so that it is 1 to 2 inches deep. Heat water until barely simmering. Combine butter, sugar, cocoa powder and the salt in a medium heat-safe bowl. Rest bowl over simmering water (if the bottom of the bowl touches the water, remove a little water).",
      "3. Stir mixture occasionally until the butter has melted and mixture is quite warm. Don't worry if it looks gritty, it will become smooth once you add the eggs and flour.",
      "4. Remove the bowl from heat and set aside for 3 to 5 minutes until it is only warm, not hot.",
      "5. Stir in vanilla with a wooden spoon or spatula. Then, add eggs, one at a time, stirring vigorously after each one.",
      "6. When the batter looks thick, shiny and well blended, add the flour and stir until fully incorporated, then beat with the wooden spoon or spatula for 40 to 50 strokes. (The batter will be quite thick). Stir in nuts, if using. Spread evenly in lined pan.",
      "7. 7. Bake 20 to 25 minutes or until a toothpick can be inserted into the center and come out almost clean (you want it to be a little moist with batter). Note: Some have found they need to bake an extra 10 minutes, so keep an eye on the doneness of the brownies and use the toothpick test as your guide.",
      "8. Cool completely then remove from pan. For the cleanest lines when cutting, place into freezer for 20 to 30 minutes to firm up. Cut into 16 squares."
