When it starts to evaporate, you know it's time to add more. And keep stirring! It may seem like forever, but risotto only takes 12 to 15 minutes to cook once you've added the rice to the pan. Toward the end of cooking, make sure to keep tasting it. You want to pull it off the heat while it's still a bit al dente."
