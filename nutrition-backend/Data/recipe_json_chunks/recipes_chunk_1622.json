      "Remember when I said this was by far one of the easiest recipes? Well this is why... all you have to do, is process the whole ingredients in a food processor in batches. While you're pureeing, toast your allspice, cinnamon and nutmeg in a pan. Combine the puree with the remaining ingredients in a bowl, and marinate your chicken. Seriously...it's that simple.",

      "After the chicken has marinated, preheat your grill to about medium low heat. Spray the grill well with nonstick spray. Even though my grill is seasoned very well, I still spray everything just for security. Depending on the thickness of your chicken, it should take between 7 and 10 minutes per side. flipping twice to keep the juices evenly distributed. Make sure the chicken reads 165 F for 15 seconds before you pull it...never skip this step and always play it safe.",
      "Once it's close to temp, take your BBQ sauce and brush it on liberally. Turn the temp down to low and close the lid of your grill. Just let it glaze for about 3-5 minutes. If you're keeping your sauce warm while doing this, it'll be even better.",

    "title": "the great pumpkin pie recipe",
    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "If decorating your pie with sugared cranberries, start them the night before. You'll also begin the pie crust the night before as well (the dough needs at least 2 hours to chill; overnight is best). The filling can be made the night before as well. In fact, I prefer it that way. It gives the spices, pumpkin, and brown sugar flavors a chance to infuse and blend. It's awesome. Cover and refrigerate overnight.",
      "For the cranberries: Place cranberries in a large bowl; set aside. In a medium saucepan, bring 1 cup of sugar and the water to a boil and whisk until the sugar is dissolved. Remove pan from the heat and allow to cool for 5 minutes. Pour sugar syrup over the cranberries and stir. Let the cranberries sit at room temperature or in the refrigerator for 6 hours or overnight (ideal). You'll notice the sugar syrup is quite thick after this amount of time. Drain the cranberries from the syrup and pour 1 cup of sugar on top. Toss the cranberries, coating them all the way around. Pour the sugared cranberries on a parchment paper or silicone baking mat-lined baking sheet and let them dry for at least 2 hours.",
      "Make the pie crust through step 5 according to my directions and visuals.",
      "For the FILLING: Whisk the pumpkin, 3 eggs, and brown sugar together until combined. Add the cornstarch, salt, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, cloves, pepper, cream, and milk. Vigorously whisk until everything is combined. Filling will be a little thick.",
      "Preheat oven to 350F (180C) degrees.",
      "Make the pie crust leaves: On a floured work surface, roll out one of the balls of chilled dough (keep the other one in the refrigerator). Roll out into any shape you really want (doesn't matter) and 1/8 inch thickness. Using leaf cookie cutters, cut into shapes. Brush each lightly with the beaten egg + milk mixture. Cut leaf veins into leaves using a sharp knife, if desired. Place onto a parchment paper or silicone baking mat-lined baking sheet and bake for 10 minutes or until lightly browned. Remove and set aside to cool.",
      "Turn oven up to 375F degrees. The pie will bake at 375F.",
      "Roll out the chilled pie crust: Remove second pie dough from the refrigerator. On the same floured work surface, turn the dough about a quarter turn after every few rolls until you have a circle 12 inches in diameter. Carefully place the dough into a 9-inch deep dish pie (one that is 1.5 - 2 inches deep). Tuck it in with your fingers, making sure it is smooth. With a small and sharp knife, trim the extra overhang of crust and discard. Crimp the edges with your fingers, if desired. Brush edges lightly with beaten egg/milk mixture. Using pie weights, pre-bake the crust for 10 minutes.",
      "Pour pumpkin pie filling into the warm pre-baked crust. If you did not use a deep dish pie pan, you will have too much filling. Only fill the crust about 3/4 of the way up. Use extra to make mini pies with leftover pie dough scraps if you'd like. Bake the pie until the center is almost set, about 55-60 minutes give or take. A small part of the center will be wobbly - that's ok. After 25 minutes of baking, be sure to cover the edges of the crust with aluminum foil or use a piecrust shield to prevent the edges from getting too brown. Check for doneness at minute 50, and then 55, and then 60, etc.",
      "Once done, transfer the pie to a wire rack and allow to cool completely for at least 3 hours. Decorate with sugared cranberries and pie crust leaves. You'll definitely have leftover cranberries - they're tasty for snacking. Serve pie with whipped cream if desired. Cover leftovers tightly and store in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.",
      "Make ahead tip: Pumpkin pie freezes well, up to 3 months. Thaw overnight in the refrigerator. As mentioned in step 1, the filling can be made the night before. Pie crust dough freezes well for up to 3 months. Thaw overnight in the refrigerator before using.",
      "*3/4 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice can be used instead of these spices.",
      "**Fresh cranberries, not frozen. The sugar syrup doesn't coat evenly on the frozen berries, leaving you with rather ugly and some very plain shriveled cranberries."

Check the tomatoes every half hour, stirring the paste and switching the position of the baking sheets so that they reduce evenly. Over time, the paste will start to reduce to the point where it doesn't fill the baking sheet any more. At this point, combine the contents of the two pans into and continue to bake.",
      "The paste is done when shiny and brick-colored, and it has reduced by more than half (3 to 4 hours). There shouldn't be any remaining water or moisture separating from the paste at this point. This will take 3 to 4 hours, though exact baking times will depend on the juiciness of your tomatoes.",

Top each jar with a layer of olive oil and place in either the refrigerator or the freezer. As long as you keep it well-covered with olive oil and ensure that you only use a very clean spoon to remove it from the jar, it will keep in the fridge for 3 to 4 weeks. Frozen, it will keep for up to nine months."

Cook the tenderloins until browned on the bottom, 3 to 5 minutes.

      "When ready to serve, Add enough oil to a large saute pan to cover the bottom of the pan and set it over high heat. Just before the oil starts to smoke, add the speck-wrapped tenderloins to the pan, and reduce the heat to medium. Cook the tenderloins until browned on the bottom, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the butter and thyme and baste the meat for 1 minute. Flip the tenderloins over and baste for 1 minute more. Transfer to a plate and let sit for 5 minutes. (If you cooked the tenderloin in the oven, return the meat to the stovetop, and over medium-high heat, add the butter and thyme and baste for 1 to 2 minutes. Let the meat rest 5 minutes before slicing.)",
      "Make the Black Garlic Jus:",
      "Fill a small bowl with hot water and soak the black garlic for about 10 minutes. Peel the garlic (the skins should pop right off) and set aside. In a large saucepot, combine the clams, stock, wine, bacon, thyme, and bay leaf and cook over medium heat. As soon as the clams begin to open, remove the pot from the heat. Strain the jus through a fine-mesh strainer into a bowl and discard the bacon and herbs. Add the black garlic to the jus, and using an immersion blender or a stand blender, puree the liquid until smooth. Keep both the clams and the jus warm. Right before serving, reheat the jus until almost simmering and transfer to a gravy boat."

      "1. Poblano crepes: For roasting poblano, place a poblano over stove top at high flame. Let it sit for like 30 seconds and keep flipping using tongs until it gets charred on all sides. Once charred, place it in a bowl and cover tightly so it steams up inside. Uncover after few mins and peel off the skin using hands. Cut in big pieces and throw in the blender. Blend until a smooth paste forms. in a big bowl, whisk together the flour and eggs. Gradually add milk and water and stir to combine. Add salt and olive oil and stir until smooth. Fold in the poblano puree. Warm a flat skillet and spray with little oil. Once hot, add 1/4 cup of batter and swirl the pan around or using a flat spatula so it gets thin and in kind of a circular shape. Let it cook for few mins. Flip and cook on the other side. Repeat and stack them on an aluminum foil.",
      "2. Filling: Add oil in a deep skillet. Once hot, add the veggies along with seasoning. Stir to mix it all together and cook on med-high flame for good 15-20 mins until it starts to smell wonderful and veggies get softened up. Keep aside.",
      "3. \"No-cheese\" cashew-poblano sauce: Roast and peel the poblano the same way as mentioned above in poblano crepe recipe. In a blender, add all the ingredients and blend until smooth. Taste and adjust seasoning.",
      "4. Assembling: In a baking dish, add some sauce at the bottom to evenly coat. Take one poblano crepe and add filling good 1-2 Tbsp or more in the centre lengthways. Roll it tightly and place seam side down on the baking dish. Repeat with the rest. Add more sauce on top. Add fresh red onions, green and red bell peppers and green onions on top.At this top, you can refrigerate it covered for later use.

      "Position an oven rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 325\u00b0F/160\u00b0C/gas 3. Melt the butter. Using 1 tablespoon of the melted butter, generously butter a 9-in/23-cm by 13-in/33-cm baking dish. Set aside.",
      "To make the streusel topping, combine the remaining melted butter and vanilla in a small bowl. Set aside. Place the oats and brown sugar in the bowl of your KitchenAid(R) Stand Mixer fitted with the flat beater. Attach the KitchenAid(R) Sifter + Scale Attachment to your mixer. Close the ingredient valve. Weigh the flour, spices, and salt in the ingredient hopper, taring the scale between ingredients. Turn the mixer to medium-low speed, open the ingredient valve, and sift the flour mixture into the mixing bowl. While mixing, pour the butter mixture down the side of the bowl and mix just until incorporated, about 1 minute. (Don't overmix or the streusel topping will turn into one big clump rather than a crumbly mixture.) Turn the mixer off, transfer the streusel topping to a bowl, and set aside. Wipe out the mixing bowl and paddle attachment.",
      "To make the fruit filling, in a medium bowl, gently stir together the blackberries, sugar, and salt. Set aside.",
      "To make the coffeecake, spread the nuts in a single layer on a small rimmed baking sheet, and bake until fragrant and starting to color, 5 to 8 minutes. Set aside to cool.",
      "Put the butter in the mixing bowl. Close the ingredient valve. Weigh the sugar in the ingredient hopper. With the mixer on medium-low speed, open the ingredient valve, and sift in the sugar. Cream the butter and sugar on a high speed until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Beat in the canola oil, one tablespoon at a time until incorporated. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Turn off the mixer. Add the sour cream and beat until incorporated, 30 seconds longer. Turn the mixer off and scrape down the sides of the bowl.",
      "Close the ingredient valve. Weigh the flour, salt, baking powder, baking soda, and spices in the ingredient hopper. With the mixer on medium-low speed, open the ingredient valve, and sift in the flour mixture. At the same time pour the buttermilk and vanilla down the side of the mixing bowl. Mix just until incorporated, 30 seconds to 1 minute longer.",
      "Turn the mixer off, remove the bowl from the mixer, and, using a rubber spatula, scrape down the sides of the bowl. Fold in the toasted pecans.",
      "Pour half of the batter into the prepared pan and spread evenly with a small offset spatula. Distribute the fruit over top, spreading it evenly over the batter. Leave a 1/4-inch border so the fruit doesn't burn on the sides of the pan. Top with the remaining batter, spreading it evenly. Crumble the streusel topping and sprinkle it evenly over the top of the batter.",
      "Bake the coffeecake until the streusel is deeply golden brown, and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 50 to 55 minutes. For even baking, at the midpoint, rotate the pan from front to back. Let the coffeecake cool in the pan on a wire rack for 20 minutes before cutting into squares and serving. The coffeecake can be made 1 day in advance and kept covered at room temperature. (The coffeecake freezes well. Cover tightly and freeze for up 30 days. Thaw at room temperature, cut into squares, and rewarm before serving.)"
