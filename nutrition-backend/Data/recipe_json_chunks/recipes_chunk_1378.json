      "Bake the shell in a removable-rim tart pan in a preheated 375\u00b0 F oven until the shell golden brown all over, 20 to 30 minutes. It should be fully baked because the pastry will not bake much more once it is filled. (Note: I haven't seen this happen, but per David Lebovitz, if the sides collapse in the oven, you can take it out midway during baking, and push the half-baked dough back up the sides.) Mix cream, sugar, and flavorings in a large saucepan (it should have enough room for the mixture to triple in volume, just in case it bubbles up quickly), stirring well. Heat until it comes to a rolling boil, stirring occasionally. Remove from the heat, mix in the almonds, and let the mixture stand about 15 minutes.",
      "Meanwhile, patch the dough if necessary. Smooth a small piece of very soft dough gently over any crack that looks like it goes all the way through the shell. (Note: If you forgot to save some dough, David Lebovitz recommends mixing a thick slurry of flour and water and smoothing that in, instead. It works!) Be careful not to break through the crisp top of the baked crust if you can avoid it. Fill the shell with the still warm filling, which will be quite liquid. Make sure the almonds float evenly in the filling. If they are gathered on the top of the liquid mixture, the finished tart will have a cornflake-like texture instead of the glossy surface you want.",
      "Set the tart into a preheated 400\u00b0 F oven, the bottom of which has been lined with aluminum foil, dull side up-the tart may bubble over. Bake 30 to 35 minutes, or until the top is a nice shade of creamy-and-russet caramel; remember that it will continue to brown a little more when you take it out of the oven. Cool the tart on a rack, loosening the sides of the pan slightly every minute or two for 5 to 10 minutes or until set. Then remove the tart from the ring and return it to the rack to cool. If you remove the ring of the pan too soon the sides will fall off the tart.",
      "While the tart is still warm (15 to 20 minutes after it comes out of the oven), remove the tart from the bottom of its pan: Carefully slide a thin knife between pastry and pan, then lift the tart off the bottom of the pan with a wide spatula and return it to the rack to finish cooling. (If you don't do this while the tart is still warm, it may stick stubbornly to the pan.)",
      "This tart is best eaten with the fingers; it is too hard to cut easily with a fork. It is good accompanied by a glass of Sauternes (but not too sweet, or too rare!) or Champagne-or a glass of milk, or coffee. Is is a good picnic dessert because it is virtually indestructible.",
      "This recipe was adapted from Mapie's La Cuisine de France, and modified for a different texture. It immediately became identified, for better or worse, as the house specialty of Chez Panisse.",
      "Mix the flour, sugar, and salt. If you use salted butter, omit the salt. Cut the butter into 1/2-inch slices and work it into the flour mixture with your hands or a pastry blender until the butter is in cornmeal sized pieces and the mixture is beginning to hold together-the softer your butter is, the faster this will happen.",
      "Combine the water, vanilla, and almond extract and work it into the flour-butter mixture just until the pastry is blended and will hold together if you press it. Gather it into a ball and wrap it in plastic. Let it rest for 30 minutes so the flour will absorb the moisture more completely. At this point you can wrap the pastry in foil and freeze for up to a month.",
      "Press the pastry into a 9-inch tart pan with a removable rim, making sure that you have a layer of even thickness over the bottom and the sides. Do not use a black tart pan; the shell may burn if you do. (Or if that's all you have, just watch it closely in the oven.) If at any point it gets too sticky and unmanageable, stick it in the refrigerator for a few minutes to until it's firm enough to press without sticking to your fingers. Before baking, set the shell in the freezer for 30 minutes or overnight, wrapped in foil. You don't need to fill the shell with beans before baking: this pastry doesn't shrink much.",
      "Note: About an ounce of this pastry is needed for each inch of pan size, so if you have an 11-inch tart pan you would need to make about two ounces more of pastry-or about a fourth again as much of this recipe. In another version of this dough, Shere adds 1/4 teaspoon grated lemon peel with the dry ingredients and omits the almond extract, which is a nice variation."

Place parchment in bottom of pan, then whisk together 1 tablespoon of the sugar, the oil and the liqueur in a bowl. Spread it evenly onto the parchment.",

Place the nut-stuffed pears sliced-side-down into the pan, narrow ends toward the center. (Depending on the size of the pears, it's possible that not all halves will fit into pan; feel free to trim them to fit, or simply do not use all halves.) Leave the oven on at 350 F.",
      "Once the remaining walnuts are completely cool, rub them between your hands with a clean dishcloth to loosen and remove most of the peels. (This can make a mess; I like to do it outside or over the sink.) Discard the loosened peels; many will stay stuck to walnuts' crevices, which is fine. Transfer nuts to the bowl of a food processor and pulse a few times, just until a fine to medium even meal is formed, being careful not to blend it too long or create nut butter. Measure out 1.5 cups walnut meal, firmly packed, and whisk the flour into it in a separate bowl. (Use the remaining nut meal as you wish. It's great on yogurt or salad.)",
      "In a large bowl, beat the egg yolks well with 1/3 cup of the sugar, mixing until pale and smooth, then add both vanillas and blend. Fold in the nut/flour mixture and the orange zest. Sift the salt and baking powder over the bowl and mix by hand. Mixture will be very thick.",
      "In a separate bowl (preferably the bowl of a standing mixer), beat the egg whites on high until they begin to become white and opaque. Keep mixer going and slowly add the remaining 1/3 cup sugar. Stop mixing only when the whites are thick, shiny and almost stiff to the touch. Scoop out little less than a cup of the egg whites, and gently mix it into the nut batter to loosen and moisten its texture. Then very gently fold in the remaining egg whites, slowly folding until the last traces of white are barely visible. Gently spread batter evenly over the pears in the pan.",
      "(Tip: If there's a chance your springform pan might leak like mine does, place a layer of tin foil on the oven rack before baking.) Place pan in oven and bake for 35-45 minutes, until top of torte is dry and firm, and a wooden toothpick inserted in its center comes out clean and not sticky. Let torte cool completely before unlocking sides of pan, inverting it onto a plate, and removing parchment. Eat within 24 hours, storing in fridge if not serving within a few hours."

Turn it over once before you've made it as large as the pan so both sides are coated in oil.

Sprinkle with a generous pinch of sea salt and give a good once over with a black pepper grinder.",

Add 1 teaspoon of sugar and 1 teaspoon salt, and mix with a fork or pastry blender. If the ingredients are very warm, they can now be placed in the refrigerator for 15 to 30 minutes. Now is a good time to prepare two plastic sandwich bags or two sheets of plastic wrap before getting your hands full of dough. Add the cubed butter to the flour mixture and immediately begin pressing the flour and butter with your fingers or cutting them together using a pastry cutter, a fork, or two knives. Working quickly, continue this process until the lumps of butter are about the size of peas. If the kitchen and/or your hands are very warm, you may need to stop and put the bowl with the ingredients into the refrigerator for 10 to 15 minutes to recool. Then continue until the butter is adequately cut in and the mixture looks like very rough cornmeal. When done, add the ice-cold liquid to the flour and mix together using a pastry cutter or fork. When most of the flour and butter mixture is wet, you can begin pressing the dough together with your hands. Do not knead or work unnecessarily.

      "Place the thin wedges of fruit on the filling, alternating apple and plum.",
      "Continue making your pattern of alternating wedges of apple and plum around the periphery of the pie.",

      "Before baking, return the pie to the work surface. Using the small paintbrush, carefully apply the egg wash to the leaves. Place the pie in the oven and bake.",
      "Set the pie on the bottom rack in the preheated oven and set your timer for 20 minutes. It's important to keep an eye on the pie in the oven for those first 15 to 20 minutes to make sure the decorations remain in place and the pie is baking evenly. After 20 minutes, turn the oven temperature down to 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C) and set a timer for another 45 minutes. After about 30 minutes, it's a good idea to check the browning of the top crust. If the decorations begin to brown excessively, loosely cover the pie with a sheet of aluminum foil or a pie shield. After the pie is done, remove from the oven and let cool on a cooling rack."

Add the salt and stir to blend, then, using an offset spatula or a table knife, spread the chocolate in the pie pan, making a layer that's 1/8 inch thick (shape doesn't matter).

Still stirring, let it burble for a minute or two more, then scrape it into a \r\nheatproof container.Use now or cover and refrigerate until needed.

    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "MAKE SALAD DRESSING: Add lemon juice, rice wine vinegar, capers, anchovy, mustard, and Worcestershire sauce to bowl of blender and whir until thoroughly mixed and smooth. (If you'd rather not deal with the hassle getting your blender out, you can make this dressing with a hand blender.) With motor of blender or hand blender running, add olive oil in a thin stream until thoroughly emulsified. Taste -- the dressing should taste vibrant and lemony. Add a pinch or two of salt, a grind of pepper, and more lemon if needed. Put dressing aside until needed. (Note: Dressing can be made a few days ahead. Keep in a glass jar in the refrigerator and let sit out for about 15 minutes before dressing the salad.)",
      "ROAST ONIONS: Heat oven to 350\u00b0 F. Cut onions in half, then slice in half moons about 1/4-inch thick. Place onions, thyme, and rosemary on rimmed baking sheet. Drizzle with 2 tablespoons olive oil and mix with your hands until herbs and onion slices are coated. Add 1/4 teaspoon salt and a grind or two of black pepper. Mix with your hands again. Place pan in oven and roast for about 40 to 50 minutes or until onion slices have turned golden and soft and are caramelized. Start checking after about 30 minutes and remove onions before they begin to char. Burnt onions are not delicious!",
      "MAKE CROUTONS: Cut bread into large bite-sized cubes. Keep crusts on for more rustic croutons. Heat 1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil in large heavy pan. (I use a cast iron pan.) Add bread cubes and cook over low heat, turning occasionally, until all surfaces of bread cubes are toasted and golden. Remove and set on a paper towel-lined plate. Sprinkle with salt while still warm and set aside. (Croutons can be made a few days ahead. Store in airtight container at room temperature.)",
      "PREPARE KALE: Wash kale in cold water. Several rinses may be needed to remove dirt and grit. Dry kale with a few layers of kitchen towels. Working carefully, remove thick stems from kale and roll kale leaves into long cigarette-style rolls. Cut kale into very thin strips. Add kale to salad bowl or serving plate. Pour 3/4 of the salad dressing over kale and toss with tongs or your hands until all leaves are coated.",
      "COOK BACON: When onions are just starting to turn golden at the tips, slice bacon lengthwise and then cut into 1-inch pieces. Saute bacon in small skillet over medium low heat until cooked and crunchy. Pour bacon onto kale. If there is any rendered bacon fat in the skillet, add a spoonful of this to the kale, if you like. Remove onions from the oven and add half of them and any juices to kale. (Save rest of onions for another use -- as a salad ingredient, sandwich topping, or to fill omelets or burritos.) Mix thoroughly with your hands or tongs -- the hot onions and bacon will slightly wilt the kale.",
      "FINISHING THE SALAD: Add croutons and ricotta salata to salad. Pour in reserved salad dressing if salad looks a little dry. Toss again. Taste and adjust seasonings if needed, adding a pinch or two of salt, a grind of pepper, or additional lemon. We enjoy this salad for dinner with a hearty vegetarian soup or fresh fish, simply prepared. Enjoy!"

When it's almost browned add the garlic, red pepper flakes and fennel seeds. When your water comes to a boil add the flower sprouts and cook for five minutes. Remove the sprouts from the water with a strainer (but keep your water) and add the pasta now - cook to package instructions. Add the flower sprouts to the sausage meat and allow the flavors to mingle. When the pasta's almost ready remove a cup of the cooking liquid and set it aside. Drain the pasta and add it to the sausage and sprouts. Add the pasta water as needed to bind it all together and give it the consistency you want. Top it all with some grated parmesan."

Because this happens quickly, make sure your flame is no higher than medium, you don't want to burn your paste.",

If the pan looks dry, add a little more of the reserved pasta water by the tablespoon until you get the consistency right. When you get it to where you want it to be, good and saucy, serve (yourself!)."

That's because the figs and port are both very sweet, on their own. The contrast with just a touch of bitterness in the chocolate tastes perfect to me. If you like your chocolate sweeter, start with a more mellow chocolate and add more sugar, if necessary. Keep in mind though that the port syrup in the figs should find its way onto the spoon with the custard when you eat it. Let your own preferences, however, be your guide. ;o)"

Take one dough piece and flatten it with your hands until it is an oval that is about 1/2-inch thick. Stretch the dough until it is about 1/4-inch thick. (I generally use a combination of holding the dough with one hand and stretching an edge with the other, and allowing half of the dough to dangle off the edge of the counter to stretch it.) The dough will likely need to relax before you will be able to stretch it to the desired thinness. Flatten and stretch each dough piece once, then go back and stretch each piece a second time. Don't forget to cover your dough when it is not being worked!",

If you have a larger grill you may be able to do 4 at once.) Wipe the baking sheet or peel with paper towels to remove residual flour. Pierce air bubbles that form on surface of dough with a fork. Grill dough until dark grill marks form, which will only take a minute or two. Brush tops of dough with EVOO, then using tongs flip over (grilled side will be up) onto the baking sheet or peel. Reduce grill heat to medium.",

Slide dough pieces back onto the grill, shut the lid and grill until the dough bottoms have nice grill marks and the cheese has melted (about 2 to 4 minutes.) Use tongs to remove to sheet pan, sprinkle with aleppo pepper if desired, and serve immediately."

(To stop the batter mixture from sticking to your spoon, dip the spoon into the oil first-but make sure the spoon is dry when you do this.) Be careful when dropping the fritters into the oil, as they may splash a little. Fry the fritters for 5 to 6 minutes, or until golden brown, and use a slotted spoon to turn them halfway through the cooking time. Remove with a slotted spoon and transfer to some folded paper towels to drain off some of the oil. Give them a pinch of salt, keep warm, and then do the next batch in the same way.",
      "Once all the fritters are done, drop the curry leaves into the oil; again, be careful as they will crackle and spit as they cook. Fry for 1 minute, remove, and drain on paper towels.",

You will know it's done when all the fat has cooked out of the meat and floats lazily on top of the sauce, colored orange from the tomato. At this point, the ragu can be eaten immediately or refrigerated for 3 to 4 days or frozen for 3 to 4 months."

While the mixer is running, add the water and 2 tablespoons of the oil and beat until the dough forms into a ball. If the dough is sticky, add additional flour, 1 tablespoon at a time, until the dough comes together in a solid ball. If the dough is too dry, add additional water, 1 tablespoon at a time. Scrape the dough onto a lightly floured surface and gently knead into a smooth, firm ball.",

Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and divide it into 2 equal pieces. Cover each with a clean kitchen towel or plastic wrap and let them rest for 24 hours. This allows the yeast to rise fully.",
      "Caramelized Onions\r\nOn stove top in medium sized pan over medium heat, add a little olive oil and warm. Add onions and saute. Add a little more olive oil as they cook and turn heat down a little bit to slow cooking. When starting to brown, add about 1/4 cup marsala wine and a little salt. Let onion cook way down til golden brown.",

      "To Make Pesto:\r\nIn a food processor, add basil and garlic. Pulse until well blended and finally chopped. Add 1/2 pine nuts and 1/4 cup olive oil and run until well blended. Add a little salt and pepper and pulse. Check consistency and flavor. Add oil and seasoning if necessary. Don't want pesto \"runny\" but spreadable.",
      "To assemble pizza:\r\nPreheat oven to 500. If you have a pizza stone, preheat in oven for 15-20 minutes but if using a baking sheet then don't preheat. Roll out 1 of the pizza balls in desired shape, rectangle or round, to desired thickness, I like really thin crust. Prick dough with fork as to not form bubbles.",

Repeat with other pizza ball.",

Shape about 3 tablespoons of the latke mixture into a round shape (I like to pack a 1/4 cup measure mostly full), and place in the oil. Flatten slightly to form a small pancake. Repeat as many times as your pan space allows. Cook the latkes until well-browned, 5 to 7 minutes, then flip and brown the other side. These latkes are more delicate than standard potato pancakes (especially when warm), so be delicate. When the second side has cooked, place on a plate lined with brown paper, stacking as needed. If you want to be extra-good, now and then strain out any rogue bits that have floated into the oil before they burn (or leave them in, for a taste closer to what grandma would have made). Serve. Or...",

Place the latkes on a cookie sheet (you can place them on a rack on top of a cookie sheet for a crisper result, but usually the sheet is fine for me), and cook until they have colored a bit more and are heated through and sizzling (10 to 15 minutes)."

      "Poaching the Apples \r\nPoaching is basically just gentle, stove top cooking. It's a straightforward, fairly hands off cooking technique, and a perfect way to make use of and give flavor to winter fruit like apples and pears. Choosing firm apples that will hold their form while poaching is important- we particularly love using Fuji & Braeburn apples. Making these ahead of time is never a bad idea- the longer the apples sit in the flavorful syrup after poaching, the better they'll taste. You can also customize these poached apples to taste. Swap in sweeteners like honey or agave if you'd prefer to cut out sugar. Make sure the apples are fully immersed in liquid while poaching, to ensure they are evenly and thoroughly cooked.",

Combine wine, sugar,lemon juice, RawSpiceBar's juniper berries and spices pouch, and 2 cups water in a large heavy saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, stirring until sugar is dissolved. 3. Add apples; reduce heat to low and simmer, occasionally rotating apples, until tender when pierced with a sharp knife, 25-30 minutes. 4. Remove apples from pot, transfer to a plate and set aside.",
      "Reduce to a glaze: \r\n1. Strain out the spices from the poaching liquid and discard.\r\n2. Add the liquid back to the pot and bring to a slow simmer over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until poaching liquid reduces by roughly 3/4, about 15-25 minutes minutes (syrup will also thicken as it cools)."

Try to remove just the kernel layer (almost like a corn kernel rug). You don't want to cut out tough chunks of the cob, so make sure the knife moves straight down without digging too deep. Rotate the ear and cut down again. Keep rotating and cutting off the kernels until the cob is bare.

Sprinkle the peanuts over the glaze and chill it for an hour before cutting.",

The top should be lightly browned but the batter should still jiggle in the center only. If you cook it on the shorter end, the custardly bottom will be more liquid-like. If you cook it longer, you will have more cake. I like mine more custardy so I begin checking even at 35 minutes. Very carefully remove from water-filled pan and let cool completely.",

Reduce heat to medium and cook until cranberries have turned quite mushy and the sauce has thickened slightly. Add some water if you need to. Strain through a fine mesh strainer and push through the cranberry mush as best you can. Scrape the bottom outside of the strainer occasionally to get some of the thick gel to thicken the syrup."

      "Lightly salt both sides of each pork chop. Set them aside for a moment. In a large bowl, mix together the lime juice, garlic, dark brown sugar, smoked paprika, cumin, chili powder, and olive oil. Gently toss the pork chops in the marinade, coating both sides of each pork chop. Let the pork chops marinate in the refrigerator for 1 hour.",
      "Unless you have a large skillet that can fit all five pork chops in a single even layer, you'll likely need to cook the pork chops in two batches. If you're working in batches, add 1 tablespoon of butter to a medium sized skillet. Set the skillet over medium heat. When the butter begins to sizzle and bubble, add 2 or 3 pork chops to the skillet. Let them cook, undisturbed, for about 2 minutes. If the heat is too low, the pork chops will not caramelize. But, if the heat is too hot, the marinade on the outside of the pork chops will burn. Use tongs to peek at the underside of the pork chops as they cook, and adjust the heat as necessary so that the pork chops caramelize without burning. After about 2 minutes, flip the pork chops. Try to get a little caramelization on both sides. They should be fully cooked after about 4-5 minutes of cooking. You'll know the pork chops are fully cooked when you touch the meat and it feels firm rather than soft.",
      "If you're cooking the pork chops in batches, wipe your skillet clean before cooking your second batch. Any leftover marinade from the first batch will likely burn as you cook the second batch. For the second batch, add the remaining 1 tablespoon of butter to a clean skillet and cook the remaining pork chops just like you cooked the previous batch. If you burned the previous batch, cook this second batch better than the first batch.",
      "When all of your pork chops are fully cooked, serve them immediately. If you want, garnish with a handful of roughly chopped cilantro."

      "Key Point: This technique will not work with raw or semirefined cane sugar, as its natural molasses content will begin to melt at much lower temperatures, causing the sugar to clump.",
      "Preheat the oven to 325\u00b0 F. Put the sugar in a 9-by-13-inch glass or ceramic baking dish and roast, stirring well once every 30 minutes, until it darkens to a sandy tan, with a coarse texture like turbinado, about 2 hours. The color change can be strangely difficult to judge in the dim glow of an oven, so scoop out a spoonful to examine in better light.",
      "Let the roasted sugar cool away from any sources of moisture or steam until no trace of warmth remains, about 1 hour. If you notice molten caramel around the edges, pour the hot sugar into a heat-resistant container, leaving the melty bits behind; once cool, the baking dish can be soaked clean. Despite its innocuous appearance, roasted sugar can be dangerously hot, so take care not to touch it.",
      "Store for up to a year in an airtight container at room temperature.",
      "Troubleshooting:",
      "- Metal baking pans conduct heat more rapidly, and their corners may harbor traces of grease or moisture, factors that make the sugar more likely to liquefy around the edges.",
      "- Given the importance of maintaining a low temperature, use an oven thermometer to verify that yours runs true to dial. Otherwise, the sugar will caramelize too quickly and begin to liquefy."

Add the last of the watermelon cubes and pulse until the soup has reached your desired consistency (I like a few lingering, smaller chunks in mine, for texture). Taste for seasoning and add more salt and/or pepper if needed. If the watermelon wasn't chilled before making the soup, put the gazpacho in the refrigerator until chilled, about 30 to 60 minutes.",

The thinner cuts allow the broth to soften up the tougher greens. \r\n\r\nFried scallions can usually be found jarred in your local asian market. Fried onions in a can make a good sub. If you are inclined to fry your own shallots or onions go for it. You could also sub in something else crunchy, like shredded raw carrot, chopped peanuts or toasted sesame seeds. Or omit it, it'll be good without too. \r\n\r\nIn lieu of mayo and red pepper at the end, you could instead add small drizzles of hot sauce and sesame oil. Or garlic chili paste and a little coconut milk. Any small addition of fat and spice could be nice here."

Place 250 mls fish stock and 250 mls white wine in a saucepan and bring to a boil. Cook for 15 minutes until reduced by half to 250 mls. \r\nFollow the rest of the recipe adding the bought crab in place of the picked crab and the reduced fish stock with wine for the crab cooking liquid. \r\nAdd another 45 mls (3 tablespoons) of olive oil in step 15 as store bought crab is often drier.\r\nIf you don't have fish stock, you can reduce 500 mls (2 cups) of white wine with 45 mls (3 tablespoons) of fish sauce."

The longer you wait to stir the chorizo, the more color and flavor will develop. When the chorizo is nicely browned on one side, use a wooden spoon to stir the chorizo, breaking it into small pieces. When the chorizo is fully cooked through and broken into small pieces, add the leeks. Season with a pinch of salt and reduce the heat to low. Stir every few minutes until the leeks have softened significantly.",
      "When the leeks appear soft, use a colander to strain the beans. Add the beans to the pot on the stove, and add enough fresh water to cover the beans by approximately 1 inch. Bring the liquid in the pot to a boil, then reduce the heat so that the beans are just barely simmering. Cook, uncovered, for 1 hour. After one hour, stir the beans and season with a few pinches of salt. Continue cooking for approximately 1 additional hour. When the beans are very tender, remove them from the heat. If the beans are not tender but the liquid is nearly evaporated from the pot, add more water as necessary. When the beans are finished, there should be a little liquid left in the pot, reminiscent of a stew. Add the juice of one lemon. Taste the beans and adjust with more salt and/or more lemon juice as necessary.",
      "While the beans are cooking, prepare the confit rock shrimp. Add the shrimp to a medium-sized pot and season them with salt and freshly ground pepper. Add the lemon zest, garlic, dried chili flakes, fresh thyme, and bay leaf. Add enough olive oil so that the rock shrimp are just barely submerged. Set the pot over the lowest heat possible. You want to cook the shrimp slowly. The slower you cook the shrimp, the more tender they will become. Stir the shrimp every few minutes, and start checking for doneness after about 20 minutes. When the shrimp are fully cooked through, remove them from the heat. If you choose to make the confit rock shrimp ahead of time and store it in your refrigerator, remember to reheat the shrimp slowly and gently.",
      "To serve, ladle some of the beans into a bowl. Garnish with a few spoonfuls of rock shrimp confit and a sprinkle of chives. Add an extra drizzle of the oil used to cook the rock shrimp. Enjoy."

      "Simmer the stock for 6 to 8 hours. \tFinally, line a chinois with cheesecloth and strain. Discard the bones and bouquet and stuff. If you are obsessive like me, take another piece of cheesecloth and strain a second time. If you are obsessive like Keller, strain twenty more times.",
      "Refrigerate overnight. In the morning skim the fat cap off of what should be a nice looking gelatin.",

      "Brown the veal ribs on all sides. Add the anchovies and give a quick stir. Off heat add the marinade and beef stock, the bay leaf, the olives, orange peel and herbs. Season with salt and pepper. Cover and bring to a simmer. A simmer is not a slow boil; it's really just some bubbles that find their way to the surface. With the cover slightly ajar cook in this way for about two or three hours or until the meat is meltingly tender.",
      "Remove the bay leaf and plate it up. I've served it with white beans but it's very good with flat noodles or other pasta.",
      "Notes: For the stew herbs you are really using herbes de Provence. You can substitute the jarred kind. But how often do you really use that? If you have fresh herbs around you can combine your own."

Adjust seasoning as needed and cook a few more minutes, uncovered. Mixture should be very moist but without any pools of liquid. Let cool completely. Stir in 3 cups grated cheese.The filling can be made a week in advance.",
      "Notes: This recipe makes alot of lentils, but it is just as much trouble to cook less, so I make the whole amount and , depending upon my energy level, I may freeze some of it (it has a long freezer life) to use for a future entree over rice, or for filling future turnovers .\r\n(If frozen for future hand pies, the lentil filling should be reheated/brought to a boil after defrosting, and then left to cool to room temp before filling the pastry. This is not for health reasons but for getting the lentil mixture to be smooth again.)",

If dough is sticky, knead in a little more flour til it is not sticky. Transfer dough to a piece of saran and flatten to a 1/2\" thick disc. Support with a cake board or sheet pan and refrigerate at least an hour.",

Cut off an approximately 12 ounce piece. On a floured surface, roll out an 1/8 \" thick piece that is large enough to cut out 3 6\" rounds, using a pot lid or other cutter. ( Keep lifting your dough after a bit of rolling, to sprinkle a little bit of flour on your surface, to keep the dough from sticking.. And also dust some flour on top of the dough surface if it gets sticky there.) If the round is sticky, dust with a tiny bit of flour to keep it from sticking. Stack rounds in a plastic bag or keep covered with a towel. Keeping your rolled- out scraps on the side,continue to roll out the dough as before. It's fine to stick together two or more chunks of dough to get the 12 ounces. Overlap rolled out scraps, pressing to adhere, and cut out more rounds until you use up your dough. Keep most of your stacked rounds in a plastic bag and on a flat surface, in the frig til ready to fill (It is so much easier to work with cold dough.) Cover the rest of the stacked rounds with a damp towel. (If dough ever becomes too soft, refrigerate to firm up.)",
      "Place sheets of wax paper on a sheet pan, cake board or other thin rigid flat surface that will hold the turnovers as they freeze. Make room in your freezer to accomodate these. They should be baked off from their frozen state. DO NOT thaw them. Follow baking directions below, estimating 20 minutes or more for baking time.\r\nPlace several pastry rounds on your counter. Lightly brush with egg wash only the bottom half of the circle . Fill a 1/3 cup measure with lentil filling, tamping down with your fingers. Rap the side of the measuring cup on the counter so the filling will release cleanly in your palm. Place filling in middle of the bottom half of each circle, pressing down to fill the crescent to 1/2\" from the edge. Spread 1-2 tablespoons of cheese on top of the filling . Fold the top half of each circle over the bottom half, pushing down to adhere the edges with 2 or 3 fingertips, pressing to seal. (If you have brushed on your egg wash too heavily, the edges will be too gooey to adhere. Then use a fork if necessary.) When the hand pies are finished, transfer to the wax paper, fitting close together but not touching.",
      "When the sheet is filled, brush each turnover with egg wash, covering the crescent. With a skewer or chopstick, poke a hole into the top of each hand pie, rotating the skewer to make a 1/4 \" hole. Freeze the sheet flat and transfer frozen turnovers to ziploc freezer bags. Continue til all are finished.\r\nI often make a few different fillings as a part of the project and i I.D. them by the number of steam holes i poke in the top!",

      "This mousse is a quite sweet if you eat it on its own but when paired with the dutch pancake and fruit salad it replaces syrup on the pancake and provides the much needed sweetness to go with the grape fruit. A mousse is a dessert that is made fluffy with the addition of whipped cream, egg whites or both. Simply make a creme patisserie which is stirred custard, start by boiling your milk, sugar, and vanilla bean pods and the scraped out innards in a sauce pan. Mix together the cornstarch and eggs until the mixture is free of lumps, temper the egg mixture into the hot milk and return to medium heat cook stirring continuously until the mixture thickens, remove from heat immediately add the butter and place in a shallow container in the refrigerator with plastic wrap on the surface of the pastry cream . For the meringue portion of the mousse separate your eggs and warm the egg whites in a hot water bath once the egg whites are warm add a little lemon juice which breaks down the protein in the egg whites there by making your job easier. Whip the egg whites until they form a soft peak then gradually add the sugar to the meringue being sure to continually whisk. Continue to whip until stiff peaks are formed set this aside and then whip the cream to soft peak. Fold your meringue into the cooled pastry cream and then do the same with the whipped cream and your mousse is now complete.",
      "For those of you who have not had a Dutch pancake before it is a simple physically leavened pancake that is baked. Pre heat your oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit and beat your eggs over a hot water bath until frothy, you want the water to be hot but not boiling or you will cook your eggs. Fold in the rest of your ingredients and deposit the batter into a lightly oiled 6\" cast iron skillet. Cut the honey dew into quarters and remove the rind and seeds, slice one of the quarters into thin slices and arrange into a spiral on the pancake.

Make sure that you have properly segmented the grape fruit and that there is no skin left, this is easy to do with grape fruits because the wedges are so big. Use a sharp knife and cut the peel off of the grapefruit and cut along the membrane, separating the flesh from the membrane, continue doing this until you have segmented the whole grapefruit.",
      "To assemble this dessert I like to serve the fruit salad and mousse in a glass with a spoon for aesthetic reasons. I either dip my pancake in the mousse or spoon some of the mousse onto the pancake but if you prefer you can serve everything directly on top of the pancake."

Process for about 45 seconds, until cheese is fully incorporated and the dough has formed a smooth paste.",

Use a wooden spoon to hold oven door open a crack. Wait 20 to 25 minutes to allow puffs to dry a bit, then serve warm preferably with a glass of prosecco or a nice cocktail."

(If your dough drops and breaks apart on the transfer, don't worry, just divvy the dough between the bowls and it will come back together as it rises.) Do not cover the bowls.

You may need to do this in two batches. Remove them to a plate and set them aside. I had about 25 meatballs.",
      "Put a bit more olive oil into your soup pot. Heat to medium and sweat the onions, then add the celery and carrot. Season with a pinch of salt. Add the broth and marinara, then the peppers and zucchini and bring to a simmer. Add the meatballs and stir gently - continue to simmer. After say, 15 minutes or so, add the greens and cover (you will probably have to push down on the greens) and let that simmer until they wilt and behave themselves.",
      "Now it's just a manner of simmering until the veggies are tender and the flavors are melded, just make sure you stir gently so you don't bash up the meatballs. I also just realized I never added any garlic. Feel free to do so although it's quite good without.",

Lop the tops off the onions and just shave the root ends to leave them intact, peel off the papery skin, and halve them crosswise, along their equators. (To facilitate clean-up, you may line the pan with a single layer of foil.) Lay the onions face-down in the hot, dry pan and cook, over a controlled high heat, until their rings turn frankly black and the tops remain uncooked, about 15 minutes. Remove and reserve. Halve the roma tomatoes and roast them in the same face-down fashion in the pan, until blackened on the edges. Reserve.",
      "Slice the chuck roast into 3-inch-thick slabs, and layer in a heavy braising covered braising pot, such as a Le Creuset braiser. Mix together the onion soup mix, thyme, salt, and pepper, and sprinkle evenly over the meat. Add the soy sauce and Worcestershire, and mix with your hands to coat. Tuck in the bruleed onions and tomatoes, garlic, and bay leaves, add the beef stock and then enough water to reach 1/2 inch below the surface of the meat. (You want the beef to iceberg above the braising liquid.)",
      "Cover the pot with a heavy lid, and bake at 325\u00b0 F. for one hour, then turn the oven down to 300\u00b0 F. and cook another two hours, until the meat is tender-ish. The liquid should be bubbling gently. Set the lid offset, turn the oven down to 250\u00b0 F. and bake for another two hours, or until the meat is fully tender but still moist. (At this point you may cool the braised beef to room temperature, cover, and refrigerate for serving the following day.)",
      "Pull out the onions, tomatoes and bay leaves, and then using a small ladle, skim off the excess fat pooling on the surface. (Discard, or save the vegetables and excess fat to enrich a pan of cooked beans.) With tongs, pull and twist the meat until gently shredded. Serve the warm meat on sliced crusty buns, with plenty of juice, topped with an optional bread-and-butter or pepperoncini."

      "For each cup of gravy desired, add one tablespoon of fat and one tablespoon of flour to the drippings in the pan. Whisk or stir together until the fat has absorbed all the flour. Set the pan over medium-low heat and let cook a full minute, stirring or whisking constantly.",
      "Add your choice of liquid, turn the heat to medium-high and stir briskly for two to three minutes, until the flour loses its raw taste. Depending on the meat and how it was seasoned, salt and/or pepper might not be necessary. Taste and adjust seasoning as desired."

(For more on mixing pie dough, check out my article here: https://food52.com/blog/10753-everything-you-need-to-know-about-pie-crust).",
      "Add the water and mix to combine. Add more water as needed to get the dough to come together. It should not be wet or sticky. Divide the dough-you'll need 2/3 of the dough for the bottom crust and 1/3 for the top crust. Wrap each piece of dough and chill for at least 30 minutes in the refrigerator.",
      "On a lightly floured surface, roll out the larger quantity of dough to 1/3-inch thick. Transfer it to the springform and trim the edge so there is 1/2-inch overhang all around. Chill the dough inside pan for at least 30 minutes in the refrigerator.",
      "Dock the chilled dough with a fork on the base and sides. Line the crust with parchment paper and pie weights, and bake until the crust is beginning to brown at the edges, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove the parchment and pie weights. If the base looks visibly wet or under-baked, return the crust to the oven without the pie weights for another 5 minutes. Cool to room temperature.",
      "While the pie is cooling. In a large bowl, combine the cherries, lemon zest and juice, and vanilla. In small bowl, mix the sugar and cornstarch to combine, then add to the cherry mixture. Mix until the cherries are evenly coated.",
      "Mound the filling into the cooled crust, pressing firmly to ensure minimal air pockets. Make a nice, rounded mound at the top.",
      "On a lightly floured surface, roll out the smaller amount of dough to 1/3-inch thick. Use a rolling pin to transfer the dough to the top of the pie.",
      "Trim away any excess dough, leaving 3/4 inch all the way around the edge. Nudge the edge down into the side of the springform pan so that it meets the top edge of the bottom crust. Push the crust down a bit so the excess puckers outward and creates a little lip, just like the edge of a typical pie. Press that outer lip together to seal the edges a bit, then crimp with a fork to seal.",
      "Egg wash the top crust evenly and sprinkle with turbinado sugar all over. Cut vents in the top of the pie.",
      "Transfer the pie to the prepared baking sheet and bake until the crust is very golden and the filling is bubbling through the vents, 45 to 50 minutes. If the pie is browning too much or too quickly, reduce the oven temperature to 375 and/or tent the top of the pie with foil.",
      "Cool the pie completely-seriously!-before slicing and serving. Unmold the outer edge of the springform pan. Slide an offset spatula around the edge of the base of the pan; if the pie is really cool and it feels solid in the middle, you'll likely be able to pick up the pie with your hands (or a large spatula) and transfer to a platter or stand. If it feels soft in the middle, you may rather keep it on the springform base for slicing. If you're feeling naughty, serve it with a drizzle of cold heavy cream."

      "Start off, by taking your 1-2 Lbs. of ground beef (unthawed), break it up and place it into a large bowl for mixing. Take your 2 cups black refried beans, 1-2 tablespoons of Cumin, 1-2 teaspoons of pepper/season salt mix, 1 handful of diced red or white onions, and lastly 1-2 eggs, (Depending on how many burgers you make, DO NOT EXCEED 4 EGGS per 2 LBS.!!).",
      "Now that you have all the ingredients that you need for the moment in the large bowl with the ground beef, mix thoroughly. (I found using my hands works best, but that's just me). After you are through with mixing the ground beef, you are ready to make burger patties.",
      "On my own knowledge it seems to me that everyone likes thick burgers, so do I! When making each burger, I make two thin patties and place them together with a piece of American cheese in between making a thick burger with cheese inside. (Much like a pizza burger). I don't own a barbecue grill, so I use my George Foreman grill. (If using an outdoor grill; Charcoal or gas, wrap each burger individually in tin foil).",
      "(Not only can these burgers be cooked on a George Foreman grills, and outside grills; They can be cooked on flattop griddles). NOW WE ARE READY TO GRILL! On the George Foreman, you will need to cook each side through with a total cook time of 3.5 mins. Temperature of George Foreman grill is a constant temp. (Easiest and quickest way). When cooking on Charcoal or gas grills, as I said before, wrap each burger individually in tin foil. (Keeps the cheese in the burger, and not in your grill!). Cook each side for about 5-6 mins or until desired. (For all who love a little pink in their burgers). Some gas grills have temperature settings, but not all of them. If there is a temperature setting, set to either 350-375 degrees. (In case of time constraints, and have to make a quick meal in an hour or so). Follow grill instructions by wrapping each burger in tin foil. While cooking at 350-375 make sure you cook eachside through for about 4-8 mins. Longer than 4-8 mins if desired for the \"WELL DONE\" burger.",
      "While the burgers are cooking take some time to butter your hamburger buns, and place them on the grill for about a minute. (A little extra flavor never hurts, but you don't have to toast the buns). After the burgers are done cooking and if you toasted your buns, unwrap all your burgers and place them on a plate. Here comes the magic final touch to this flavorful burger!",
      "With the burgers laid out, you will see that the American Cheese should be oozing out the sides of the burger. Take another tablespoon to black refried beans and try to smear it like a spread on the burger. WE'RE ALMOST DONE!! All that is left to do now is pour a layer of unheated, but not chilled Mild/Med/Hot Nacho cheese whichever spicy level you choose. Finally, add 1-2 tablespoons of Pase Picante sauce, place the top portion of the bun on, and it's ready to eat!",
      "THIS IS BY NO MEANS MEGA HEALTHY!!! It is definitely worth the taste! You can take this recipe, and add your own variations on it. Works with veggie burgers, and turkey burgers for an even healthier approach! ENJOY!!"

      "TO MAKE THE DOUGH: Mix all-purpose flour, bread flour, sugar, and salt together in the bowl of a stand mixer. Bring a small pot of water to 150\u00b0 F (it should be almost too hot to touch but NOT close to a simmer), then with the machine running on low, add 1/2 cup of the hot water into the flour mixture. Mix for 1 minute or so. The mixture will still look like loose flours with large lumps. Then add 1/4 cup of cold water and mix for 1 minute, and then add 1/4 cup of vegetable oil. Turn the machine to medium-high speed and knead the dough for 5 minutes until shiny and elastic. The dough will be very wet and sticking to the side of the bowl in the beginning (if it seems tacky already, add 1 teaspoon of water), but it should slowly pull away cleanly at the end of kneading. When you lift the dough hook, the wet dough should droop down from the hook slowly.",
      "If you must knead with your hands, you can. But keep in mind that this is quite a wet dough and it will stick to your hands while kneading. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let the dough rest for at least 1 hour.",
      "TO MAKE THE SCALLION OIL AND FILLING: Add 1 cup of diced scallions, vegetable oil, salt, 1/2 teaspoon of ground white pepper and 1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper in a blender and blend until smooth. Transfer into a bowl. Take 3 tablespoons of the mixture out into another bowl and add 1/8 teaspoon of baking soda, mix until combined and keep both in the fridge. Mix the rest of the 1 cup of diced scallion with 1/2 tsp of ground white pepper, set aside.",
      "TO MAKE THE FLATBREADS: Divide the dough into 4 portions and set on a well-floured surface. Take 1 portion, dust with more flour, and roll it into about a 1/8-inch sheet. Apply a generous layer of scallion oil (mixed with baking soda) and sprinkle 2 tablespoons of diced scallions over the sheet, then fold it in the same direction 3 times (like folding a letter) into a log, then fold the log lengthwise 2 times into a round shape (try to eliminate as much air as possible while you fold). Set aside (to let it rest) and repeat the same process with the other 3 portions.",
      "Now go back to the first dough you worked on (which has had a few minutes to rest) and press it down gently into a thick, flat disk. There will be air pockets in between the layers which will make it hard to roll out, so pierce the dough a few times with a fork and dust with only enough flour to prevent sticking, then roll into a large circle slightly thicker than 1/16 inch. (Be careful not to over-roll it because you'll risk flattening all the layers.) If the dough springs back stubbornly, rest it for another 2 min. If you want to keep the flatbreads in the freezer, laminate the rolled-out doughs in between two sheets of parchment paper and tuck inside a zip-lock bag. Keep frozen until needed.",
      "Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large, nonstick skillet over medium heat. Carefully lift the dough up and transfer to the skillet. Cook over medium-low heat, add more oil if needed, and cook until golden brown on both sides (it's important to add enough oil). The baking soda will create bubbles in between layers during cookings. Right off the skillet while it's still hot, brush the top with more scallion oil (without baking soda). Serve immediately."

This is your tester fritter. From this one you should be able to judge if the oil is too hot, cold, or just right. If it's too cold the batter will sink to the bottom and will take upwards of 10-15 seconds to float to the surface. Cook for a minute or two, then use a spider or slotted spoon to flip the marinade and brown on the other side. Cook for another minute or two until golden brown on the outside, but completely cooked inside. That's why this is a tester - so you can judge your oil and timing -- it can be different depending on the equipment you're using.",

      "Thinly slice the red onions into small discs. Place them in a thick-bottomed pot, and saute over medium heat with the butter until they're soft and caramelized. Add the rice to the pot and stir so that all of the grains are coated in butter. Add 1 cup of stock and cook until the rice has absorbed all of the liquid, stirring constantly. Once the rice starts to look dry, add more stock and continue stirring. Repeat the process until the rice has reached a creamy consistency; the rice should be tender and firm, but not crunchy. If you run out of stock before the rice is fully cooked, continue the process using water.",
      "Slice the asparagus into small pieces and add to a pan with a drizzle of oil. Saute until the asparagus is bright green in color, and then remove from the heat and set aside.",
      "Cut the chard into thin strips and repeat the process above. Set aside.",
      "Blanch the peas: Boil water in a small pot, add the peas and let them cook for 3 minutes. Strain, and rinse in ice water. Set aside. Note: if you're using frozen peas, they're likely already cooked, so you can skip this step!",
      "Add 1 cup peas and all of the asparagus to the rice and mix together.",
      "Prepare the pesto: add scapes, olive oil, peas and pine nuts to a food processor and blend until you've reached a smooth, spreadable consistency. Add more oil as you see fit.",
      "To serve, place a generous serving on risotto on a plate and top with a pile of chard. Drizzle the pesto on top."
