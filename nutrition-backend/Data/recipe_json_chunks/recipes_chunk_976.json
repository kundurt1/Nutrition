      "To make bath bombs successfully, have ingredients ready to mix. Choose your moulds carefully and have, at least, 2 molds ready for filling. Read the instructions first so you know what you are doing. Carefully measure out the wet ingredients (if you have too much, you will end up with \"slop\", and, if that is the case, just dry the product out and leave it loose (it will still work!).",
      "To Start: Combine the baking soda, citric acid, cornstarch, and borax.",
      "Melt the cocoa buter in a microwave safe measuring cup or over low heat in a small pot. Add to the baking soda mixture. Combine the mixture and add the essential oils. Mix well. Mixture should hold together when you make a ball.",
      "Working quickly, press the mixture FIRMLY into your mold, making sure the edges are clean. Leave the mixture in to the mold for a couple of minutes, then pop out. While one tray is drying, work on the other (I put a small cutting board over top of the mold, flip over, then lift the mold off). Let bombs dry overnight undisturbed. Once dried, place them in a decorative bag and tie with ribbon.",
      "To use: Drop 1 bomb into your tub and relax.",
      "~Or~ leave the mixture in the mixing bowl for 24 hours, periodically mixing the ingredients, breaking up the clumps. Once the product has dried out, place in a nice decorative bag with a colourful ribbon. Makes nice gifts.",
      "Helpful Hints: Your favorite perfume could be used in the bomb. Realize that while it is messy, wasteful, and considering how expensive perfumes are -- but it can be done. Remove the sprayer nozzle and spray into a measuring cup the desired amount Because perfume is so concentrated, use 3/4 - 1 tsp, or until you are satisfied with the smell.",
      "I have used large ice cube trays that I use just for bath bombs. When picking a mould you want something that is not too big (you end up wasting product) and soft edges (the bombs end up too fragile with sharp angles). When the bombs are in the molds, and I have pressed firmly down, I will run a sharp knife along the bottom of the mold to get a clean, flat edge. You can put lavender flowers, rose petals, etc in your mixture, but sometimes it ends up clogging your drains, so think carefully about what you are putting in the bombs -- if you put too much dried fowers in the bomb may not come together.",
      "Commercial bombs have lots of hidden ingredients it them that are not necessarly good for the skin, like Sodium Laurel Sulphite -- which gives you the \"bubbling action\" You get nice bubbles, but this product (in its raw state) will actually burn the skin."

      "To make the crust, combine the flour, sugar, salt, and butter in food processor, electric mixer, or large mixing bowl. Using the blade attachment of the food processor, the paddle attachment of the electric mixer, or a pastry cutter, cut the cold butter into the flour until the mixture resembles a coarse meal. If you are using a processor, transfer the mixture to a bowl. Sprinkle the 2 tablespoons water and the vanilla over the mixture and mix with a fork until the dough clumps together. Gather the dough into a ball, wrap it in plastic wrap, and flatten into a 1-inch-thick disk. Refrigerate the dough for 30 minutes, until it is firm enough to roll out.",
      "Have ready an 11-inch fluted tart pan with a removable bottom (or a 9-inch deep-dish pie pan). On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough into a 13-inch circle. Set the rolling pin on top of the dough on the diagonal, and flip the dough edge (about one-third of the dough width) over the rolling pin. Holding the dough against the pin gently with one hand, pick up the pin and set the dough in the tart pan, centering it as well as you can. Trim the dough to leave about a 1/2-inch overhang all the way around, saving the trimmings at room temperature for later crust repair work. Gently push the dough into the pan so that it fits snugly against the sides, then fold the overhang toward the inside, pressing the folded dough against the sides. With thumb and forefinger, gently pinch the dough so that the sides of the tart extend about 1/4 inch above the edge of the pan, with an even thickness all the way up and around. Freeze the crust for 30 to 40 minutes, until it is hard. While the crust is chilling, preheat the oven to 350 degrees.",
      "When the crust is hard, line it with a piece of aluminum foil large enough to cover it, and fill with beans, rice, or pie weights. (Do not prick the crust!) Bake the crust for 35 minutes, then remove the weights and foil and bake for another 15 minutes, until the crust is golden brown and feels dry. If holes developed anywhere in the crust, they can easily be patched now by gently spackling with the leftover dough, but be careful not to break the tart sides while making repairs. Whisk the egg with 1 teaspoon of water to make an egg wash and brush all over the bottom and sides of the crust. Return the crust to the oven and bake for 5 minutes more, until the egg is set and dry. Set the crust aside on a rack to cool.",
      "About 15 minutes before the crust will finish baking, make the filling: Whisk the eggs and granulated sugar together in a bowl until smooth. Whisk in the lime juice and lemon juice, until smooth. Whisk in the cream, then strain the filling through a fine-mesh sieve into a large measuring cup and stir in the lemon zest. The filling will be quite liquid at this point.",
      "Without removing the crust from the oven, pour the filling into the crust (it's easier to do it this way than to juggle the full pie shell from counter to oven). Reduce the oven heat to 325 degrees and bake the pie for 35 to 40 minutes, until the center is just set. Cool the pie on a rack, then refrigerate until cold.",
      "To prepare the meringue, place the egg whites and cream of tartar in an electric mixer fitted with the whip attachment. Place the brown sugar in a small, heavy saucepan, add water to cover, attach a candy thermometer to the pan, and turn the heat on high. When the sugar is at about 240 degrees, start whipping the whites on high speed (they should be foamy and starting to thicken before you add the sugar). When the sugar is at the high soft-ball stage (245 degrees), remove the thermometer from the sugar and, with the mixer still running, carefully avoiding the whip, pour the sugar into the egg whites in a thin stream. When steam starts to come off the whites, add the sugar more quickly. When all sugar has been added, continue whipping until firm but soft peaks form. The meringue should still be quite warm. Quickly spread the meringue on top of the pie, shaping it with a rubber spatula to form a high, smooth dome. With the back of a soup spoon, make decorative waves, working quickly because as the meringue cools it will become stiff and difficult to shape. Preheat the broiler and place the pie on a lower oven rack to brown, turning every few seconds to brown evenly. Store the finished pie in the refrigerator, but plan on serving it within 3 to 5 hours, as the meringue may start to weep."

Set the pan over medium heat until the water begins to steam, then reduce the heat and stir and fold leaves until just wilted, 3 to 4 minutes.

Assemble the panade in layers, starting with a generous smear of onions, followed by a loose mosaic of bread cubes, a second layer of onions, a wrinkled blanket of chard, and a handful of the cheese. Repeat, starting with bread, the onions and so on, until the dish is brimming. Aim for 2 to 3 layers of each component, then make sure the top layer displays a little of everything. Irregularity in the layers makes the final product more interesting and lovely. Drizzle with any remaining olive oil.",
      "Bring the remaining 3 3/4 cups stock to a simmer and taste for salt. Add stock slowly, in doses, around the edge of the dish. For a very juicy, soft panade, best served on its own, like a soup or risotto, add stock nearly to the rim; for a firm but succulent panade, nice as a side dish, fill to about 1 inch below the rim. Wait a minute for stock to be absorbed, then add more to return to the desired depth. The panade may rise a little as the bread swells.",

      "Bake until the panade is piping hot and bubbly. It will rise a little, lifting the foil with it. The top should be pale golden in the center and slightly darker on the edges. This usually takes about 1 1/2 hours, but varies according to shape and material of baking dish and oven.",
      "Browning and serving: Uncover panade, raise temperature to 375\u00b0F, and leave until golden brown on top, 10 to 20 minutes. Slide a knife down the side of the dish and check the consistency of the panade. Beneath the crust, it should be very satiny and it should ooze liquid as you press against it with the blade of the knife. If it seems dry, add a few tablespoons simmering stock and bake for 10 more minutes."

      "FUN TIP:",
      "Before adding the nuts and chocolate to your dough, divide the dough into 2 bowls. Since you have measured out the nuts and chocolate (or variety of baking pieces)into separate bowls, you can now create a variety of cookie dough flavors. Add whatever combination you would like so long as you add approximately equal amounts to each bowl.",
      "FOR EXAMPLE: Divide cookie dough into 2 bowls. To first bowl add 1 pound chopped pecans, 1 pound chocolate chunks, and 1/2 pound butterscotch chips. To second bowl add 1 pound chopped walnuts, 1 pound caramel/chocolate swirled chips, and 1/2 pound vanilla baking chips. The possibilities are endless. Have fun with this!",
      "When I freeze the dough, I do use my food saver machine. I fill the food saver bag with desired amount of dough and flatten out slightly before vacuum sealing. This way the dough lays flat in the freezer to save space, and thaws more quickly. I take the dough out of the freezer and put in the fridge the day before I plan on baking."
