      "Remove the zest of two or more of the lemons, using a fine grater, to get 2 tablespoons of zest. Squeeze out and strain the juice of these and the other lemons to get 3/4 cup of fresh lemon juice.",
      "To make the base for the tiramisu, heat the water in the double boiler to a steady simmer. Off the heat, beat the egg yolks with 1/4 cup of the sugar and 1/2 cup of the limoncello until well blended. Set the bowl over the simmering water, and whisk constantly, frequently scraping the whisk around the sides and bottom of the bowl, as the egg mixture expands and heats into a frothy sponge, 5 minutes or longer. When the sponge has thickened enough to form a ribbon when it drops on the surface, take the bowl off the double-boiler pan and let it cool.",
      "Meanwhile, pour the remaining cup of limoncello, all of the lemon juice, 1 cup water, and 1/2 cup of the sugar in a saucepan. Bring to a boil, stirring to dissolve the sugar, and cook for 5 minutes, evaporating the alcohol. Let the syrup cool completely.",
      "In another large bowl, stir the mascarpone with a wooden spoon to soften it, then drop in the grated lemon zest and beat until light and creamy. Whip the egg whites with the remaining 1/4 cup sugar, by hand or by machine, until it holds moderately firm peaks.",
      "When the cooked limoncello sponge (or zabaglione) is cooled, scrape about a third of it over the mascarpone, and fold it in with a large rubber spatula. Fold in the rest of the zabaglione in two or three additions. Now fold in the whipped egg whites in several additions, until the limoncello-mascarpone cream is light and evenly blended.",
      "Pour some of the cooled syrup, no deeper than 1/4 inch, into the shallow-rimmed pan to moisten the ladyfingers (savoiardi). One at a time, roll a ladyfinger in the syrup and place it in the casserole or baking dish. Wet each cookie briefly-if it soaks up too much syrup, it will fall apart. Arrange the moistened ladyfingers in neat, tight rows, filling the bottom of the pan completely. You should be able to fit about twenty ladyfingers in a single layer.",
      "Scoop half of the limoncello-mascarpone cream onto the ladyfingers, and smooth it to fill the pan and cover them. Dip and arrange a second layer of ladyfingers in the pan, and cover it completely with the remainder of the cream.",
      "Smooth the cream with the spatula, and seal the tiramisu airtight in plastic wrap. Before serving, refrigerate for 6 hours (or up to 2 days), or put it in the freezer for 2 hours. To serve, cut portions of tiramisu in any size you like, and life each out of the pan and onto dessert plates."

      "Clean olives thoroughly by rinsing under water (work in batches).",
      "Use a paring knife to score/cut an \"X\" in each olive. This allows the brine to more easily leach the bitterness out of the olive.",
      "Once a whole color-batch is scored, place in a one-gallon pickle jar with a brine of 8oz sea salt to water. Swish the brine throughly so that all the salt gets dissolved instead of settling to the bottom. Fill with water to almost the top. Use a ziploc baggie with some water in it to weight the olives. It is very important to keep all olives submerged to avoid mold problems. Leave the lid loose and put in a cool, dark place.",
      "After one week, switch to a stronger brine of 1lb salt/gallon. I like to rinse the olives and sterilize the jars at this point. The smell and sensation of the clean, rinsed olives may blow your mind. I also use a new batch of clean ziplocs at this point to weight the olives. Keep those babies submerged!",
      "After 2 weeks, replace brine again as above. Close lids firmly.",
      "Replace brine as many times as necessary to achieve a taste you like (realizing they will be REALLY salty just out of the brine, even rinsed). I usually switch the brine 3 -4 times, 1 -2 weeks apart. Greener olives will take longer than purple olives.",
      "When they've been brined to your satisfaction, the fun begins! Rinse throughly. Pack in sterilized jars to 2/3 full.",
      "Add organic lemon slices (3-4 per jar), a whole or minced clove of garlic, and a teaspoon or so or dried oregano. Fill with vinegar (I like white vinegar for green olives and red wine for purples) and one teaspoon of salt to one inch below top of jar.",
      "Add 1/2 inch of olive oil.",
      "Seal firmly and agitate the mixture, then store in a cool, dark, place.",
      "Once opened, these must be refrigerated. Bring them back to room temperature before serving to avoid a weird lumpy oil crud covering your beloved olives. Refrigerate any leftovers.",
      "Play with the marinades - I like to do the green ones with hot peppers and carrots. Try different vinegars and herbs. A couple of years ago, I did a Thai theme, with ginger, lemon grass, hot peppers, and white vinegar. Delish!",
      "I have found when I give these as gifts, people do not always use them, and that is a big bummer considering all the work that goes into them and how incredibly delicious they are. Better to bring them to a party to show them off, then tell people about the process. (Plus, you get to enjoy them, too)."

Add asparagus and stir fry until tender but still crisp, about 3 minutes. With a slotted spoon, remove to a plate. Return wok to high heat until smoking. Add ginger, scallions, and black bean mixture. Stir fry until aromatic, about 30 seconds. Add beef and cook until browned around the edges but still pink inside, 2-3 minutes. Add stock, oyster sauce, sugar, and asparagus. Stir fry over high heat until sauce is hot and blended, about 1 minute. Remove from heat. Sprinkle with sesame oil and serve."

Avoid using flour, because that's usually what causes lumps. Instead, puree the vegetables you roast along with your turkey; they become your thickening agent.

The vegan bouillon cubes I used were Not Chick'n by Edward & Sons. They were purchased at Sprouts for relatively cheap, under $3, but there is also a brand called Imagine that makes a vegetarian No Chicken Broth in liquid form which I'm sure would work just fine. You would use 2 cups of that broth rather than dissolving the cubes into 2 cups of water."

There's no need to find a warm place either; just anywhere out of your way. It'll take longer to rise, but the flavour will be better. The dough is ready when doubled in size. Knocking it back when it has risen will improve the flavour. Shape the loaf rather than knead it (although I knead it lightly for 1-2 minutes Chef UK) - add olives or chopped nuts at this stage too."

      "4) Check on the eggs every 30-minutes to check on the coloring of the egg whites. Rotate the eggs that are sticking out a bit if you want even coloring.",
      "5) Take the eggs out of the soy sauce mixture once they reach the coloring you want. In my experience, the darker the egg white, the more the soy sauce mixture has penetrated the egg. You do not want it to penetrate too much in order to maintain the integrity of your medium boil. Some recipes for soy sauce eggs will tell you do let them sit overnight, but you would need to use a very very VERY light soy sauce.",
      "6) When the eggs are to your satisfaction - I like to leave mine in for two hours, rotating my eggs at the top every 30 minutes - take out the egg and serve! These are good in the fridge for up to 5 days. You can reuse the soy sauce mixture a few times as long as there are not any egg bits in it. If you need a snack or an appetizer, serve the eggs cut in half with a sprinkle of Vietnamese fried onions or the fried shallots you can get at Trader Joe's (kind of like French's Fried Onions but thinner) and some chopped scallions."

      "Before you begin, you will also need: 14 white sporks, 42 strands of pink and blue pull n' peel licorice, 14 medium eye sprinkles, 14 mini eye sprinkles, pink food marker, black decorating icing, 7 milano cookies, number 2 small round piping tip, and 12 ounces bright white candy melts or white chocolate for Forky inspired decorations.",
      "Let's start with the marshmallow fondant! The homemade kind is so easy to make, and tastes way better than anything you can buy in a store. Place the marshmallows and water in a microwave safe bowl (with plenty of room for the marshmallows to expand), and heat for 30 seconds. Stir, and microwave again for 30 seconds more. Stir until the marshmallows are smooth and completely melted.",
      "Add in half of the powdered sugar and stir to combine, then add the rest and the vanilla extract, and continue to mix until you cannot mix anymore. Coat a work surface and your hands with the vegetable shortening (to prevent sticking), and begin to knead the fondant on your surface until it comes together and is no longer sticky (add shortening as needed). Coat the fondant with a little more shortening and wrap it in plastic wrap before transferring to the refrigerator to chill overnight.",
      "To make the cheesecake pops place your Oreo cookies in the bowl of a food processor, and process until finely ground. Add the salt and process just until combined. Transfer to a medium bowl and add the cream cheese in small pieces. Mix to combine with your hands.",
      "Scoop out a heaping 1/2 a tablespoon, and roll between your palms to form balls. Place the cheesecake balls on a parchment lined tray, and transfer to the refrigerator to chill for at least 45 minutes. While they are setting you can begin to work on the decorations.",
      "The licorice should be pre cut to the right length for the arms. You will just want to gently separate 4 strands per cake pop (with the eyebrow and arms being the same color). On top of a piece of wax paper cut a 1 inch section for the eyebrow and form it into an arch. Then cut a 1 inch section of the mouth color and press the 2 cut ends together to join them. You can make this one smiling or any expression you would like. Press it into your wax paper to hold the shape. To create the arms, make 3 folds on the end of the strand of licorice and separate slightly for fingers, repeat with the other strand, and then twist the 2 arm strands together in the middle. I found it best to shape the licorice the night before decorating, and let it set on the wax paper so it's not as sticky and holds the designs better.",
      "Once the cake pops are fully chilled it's time to dip them! Place the candy melts or white chocolate in a heat safe bowl, and microwave at 50% power for 1 minute, stir and repeat (in 30 second intervals), until the melts are smooth and completely melted. If you need to thin them out a bit you can add paramount crystals 1 teaspoon at a time, stirring until combined. Use a toothpick to add a little of the candy melts to the spoon part of each spork and place a cheesecake ball on top gently molding to the shape of the spork. Allow the chocolate to set.",
      "Dip the front of each spork into the candy melts, completely covering the cheesecake ball, and gently tap the bottom of the spork against the side of the bowl to pop any air bubbles and smooth the candy. Allow to set. You can dip them all once more for an extra smooth finish. (A toothpick is a great tool if you need to remove any excess candy melts from the fork tings). Once all the pops are dipped you can transfer them back to the refrigerator while completing the decorations (the cheesecake pops can also be refrigerated overnight).",
      "To prepare the cookie sticks for each pop, carefully cut each milano cookie in half with a sharp kitchen knife. Then cut the halves in half once more so that you have 4 pieces (2 per pop). If you would like, you can use the knife to very carefully round out the ends of each cookie. Set aside.",
      "Once the fondant has chilled you can separate and roll it into 1 inch balls. Form each ball into a triangle between your fingers (and flatten the top of the triangle). Set aside.",
      "When you are ready to put the cake pops together re melt your candy melts to use as the \"glue\". Place your cheesecake pops on a piece of wax paper, and use a toothpick dipped in the candy melts to attach the eyebrow, mouth, and sprinkle eyes. Tear a tiny piece of paper towel and color it with the food marker. Dab onto either side of the mouth for cheeks.",
      "Attach the piping tip to your decorating icing, and pipe large pupils into the center of each sprinkle eye. Glue the arms onto the spork handle with more candy melts.",
      "Add the fondant triangle to the bottom of your spork handle, and use melts to attach 1 piece of the cookie to either side of the bottom (like skis). Take a million pictures of your adorable new creation, and enjoy!",

    "ingredients": [],

      "First of all remove the meat or poultry from the roasting tin and have a bowl ready, then tilt the tin and you will see quite clearly the fat separating from the darker juices. So now you need to spoon off the fat into the bowl using a tablespoon, but remember, you need to leave 1-11/2 tablespoons of fat in the tin. Then, using a wooden spoon, scrape the sides and base of the tin to release any crusty bits, which are very important for flavour. Next, place the tin over direct heat turned fairly low and, when the fat and juices begin to sizzle, add the flour, then quickly dive in with the wooden spoon using brisk circular movements. Speed is of the essence - gentle, faint-hearted stirring is not what's needed here: you should be mixing in the manner of a speeded-up film!",
      "Soon you will have a smooth paste, so now begin to add the hot stock, a little at a time, whisking briskly and blending after each addition. Now turn the heat up to medium and you will find that, as the stock is added and it reaches simmering point, the gravy will have thickened.",
      "Now your own preference comes into play. If the gravy is too thin, let it bubble and reduce a little; if it's too thick, add a little more liquid. Finally, taste and season with salt and freshly milled black pepper, then pour the gravy into a warmed jug ready for the table.",
      "For pork, which has pale juices, add onion to the roasting tin. This will caramelise during cooking and give colour to the juices. The onion may also be used with other joints and poultry to give colour.",
      "For lamb, add a teaspoon of mustard powder with the flour, a tablespoon of redcurrant jelly to melt into the gravy, and some red wine to add body.",
      "For duck, add the grated zest and juice of a small orange, along with a glass of port.",
