      "Brush this syrup on all the cut surfaces of the layers, including the base, to moisten the cake.",
      "To fill the layers, put 1 cup of thick apricot preserves in a bowl, and stir just to loosen.",

      "Now place the center layer of the cake (the layer with two cut surfaces) on top of the base, and spread the remaining apricot filling over the top.",
      "Finally, place the bottom layer of cake over the filling, upside down, so the flat, smooth surface that was originally the very bottom of the cake is now the top.",
      "Center the three layers so the sides of the torta are straight, and scrape off any drippings of apricot that oozed out.",
