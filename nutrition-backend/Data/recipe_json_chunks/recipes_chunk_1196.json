Add the ground beef, 1 1/4 teaspoons of kosher salt, and 1/2 teaspoon of pepper. Cook until brown then drain. To the browned meat, add the chili seasoning, garlic, and tomato paste and cook for 2 minutes. Add the V8 Juice, chili beans, can of tomatoes, crushed Doritos, and any of the optional ingredients listed above. Do NOT add the cheeses yet. Stir, cover, and bring to a simmer. Reduce the heat to maintain a very gentle simmer (around medium-low). Simmer for 30 to 45 minutes. Turn off the heat and add the cheeses and stir to combine. Allow the cheese to melt for about a minute then stir again. Taste for seasoning and adjust salt and pepper as needed. It is highly likely you will need more salt. I add anywhere from 1/2 to 1 teaspoon of additional kosher salt (half that amount for table salt) but I'll let you decide how much to add. The chili should be rich and thick and the ground beef should be very tender. If it is too thick add a little water or V8 Juice.",

Use chili powder instead.",
      "** Why V8 Juice? V8 juice is made up of several pureed veggies including tomatoes, carrots, celery, and more. Plain tomato juice or canned tomato sauce does not have the same depth of flavor.",
      "*** To make 1/3 cup of finely crushed Doritos, measure out 1 cup of Doritos - breaking each Dorito into a few pieces so they lay properly in the cup. If you have some Doritos left in the bottom of the bag that are already in small pieces, this is a great use for them. Dump the cup of Doritos into a resealable bag and use a rolling pin to finely crush the chips. After they are finely crushed, you'll have about 1/3 cup.",
      "**** You really need to use freshly grated cheese in this instead of the stuff that comes pre-shredded. Pre-shredded cheeses contains stabilizers that can sometimes impede melting. For this reason, I highly recommend that you use freshly grated in this recipe."

Add the spice packet that may have come with the brisket and also - beef broth, bay leaves, peppercorns, coriander seeds, whole allspice, dill seeds, mustard seeds, malt vinegar, whole cloves, packed brown sugar, apple juice, Guinness beer, sea salt & coarsely chopped garlic cloves. Now pour over just enough water to barely cover the brisket. Bring pot to a boil, cover and turn down temperature to simmer on medium for 2 hours. Meanwhile (you have 2 hours, take your time) wash/rinse and remove eyes from potatoes, quarter them, rinse again and set aside in bath of cool water. Also chop the sweet onion into large wedges too and set aside.",

Add more water if needed to cover everything; this may not be needed. Bring pot back to a boil, cover and turn down to simmer for another 30 minutes. Meanwhile, take the cabbage and peel off the outer leaves, rinse the heads and slice into large quarters. * Cut cabbage down the spine so the wedges stay together. Now add the cleaned cabbage, the remaining onion and the remaining 10 baby carrots to the pot. Cover and simmer again for another 30 minutes at least, stir once or twice. It is really hard to overcook cabbage so rather, just do not undercook it. After 30 minutes check to see if the cabbage is tender, if its not simmer for another 5-10 minutes. If cabbage is tender turn off the burner and let the pot cool a moment on the stove.",

Chop the parsley from its stems and add to the bowl with the butter.

You can toss out the broth or retain the last 1/4 (with the spices) for an au jus sauce.",

      "My Note: I was curious about a couple of things about this recipe. First, why did I end up with 24, not 12, of these mini muffins as the recipe indicates? Could it be that I misprint? Mine is a standard, mini-muffin tin. Second, I really don't like nutmeg much. So WHY do I LOVE these muffins?! And why can't I stop popping them in my mouth? Don't kid yourself by thinking that because they're small you won't eat as much. You'll just eat more of them. And making them in the mini muffin tins was GENIUS, Dianne! That way you get more of that buttery, cinnamony sweetness in every bite! I did make a couple of modifications, but nothing that would significantly alter the recipe. I used butter instead of margarine and, because I have an entire quart of buttermilk to use, I subbed buttermilk for the milk. This worked beautifully, but please note that if you do that you MUST add 1/2 teaspoons baking soda and eliminate the baking powder to adjust the acidity and make them rise properly! Plus they're so darned pretty I could just eat them up! (And I already did, with five of them) Your recipe is a beauty, Dianne! ~A hopefully helpful update: because of my curiosity I did some shopping around to learn that the sizes of mini-muffin tins varies, sometimes significantly! This explains the variance in yield with this recipe, to anywhere from 12 to 24 of these little muffins. This recipe makes 24 mini muffins. You fill the muffins cups 1/2 full with batter, and they should rise to just above top of the muffin tin. You can certainly also make 12 larger mini muffins if you wish, but \"officially\" this recipe makes 24. I think 12 has worked for me because my muffin tin is on the bigger side. Sorry about the confusion!",
      "I dare you to eat just one -- With that in mind the only thing I would do differently next time is to double or triple the recipe because these don't last long. I sprayed a little Pam for baking in the bottom of my mini-muffin cups so they'd pop right out. I can't wait to make these with my niece as this is definitely a kid friendly recipe.",
      "I put in a little less than 1/2 tsp of nutmeg. I also coated mine in powdered sugar, vanilla glaze and a chocolate glaze. We all like the vanilla glaze best! Here is the recipe I used for my vanilla glaze 2 cups confectioners' sugar 1 tsp vanilla extract 1 TBS milk 1 TBS butter, softened Put that into a bowl and mix together. I added more milk, but I didn't measure. I just got it to the consistancy I liked. Once I mixed it, I poured have of the glaze into another bowl and added 1 TBS cocoa powder and mixed. Then I dipped the muffins in the glazes and let dry. I double dipped them. Then on the vanilla glaze ones, I dipped some of the tops in the chocolate glaze. Also, glaze them once they have cooled. If you don't wait, they will fall apart."

Garnish with the remaining herb and skim excess fat from the pan juices if necessary; serve, with some of the juices spooned over it.",
      "ROAST CHICKEN PARTS WITH BLACK BEANS VARIATION: First, soak 2 tablespoons fermented black beans in water, sherry, or wine to cover. In place of the butter or olive oil, use peanut oil or a neutral oil, like grapeseed or corn. Mix together 1 tablespoon minced garlic, 2 minced scallions, 1 teaspoon minced fresh ginger, 2 tablespoons soy sauce, and 1 teaspoon sugar or honey. Drain the black beans and add them to this mixture; thin it to a paste, if necessary, with a little more soy sauce. In Step 1, spread a little of this mixture all over the raw chicken and put the chicken in the roasting pan; return the pan to the oven. Proceed with Steps 2 and 3, using the soy-based mixture for basting in place of the herb mixture.",
      "MORE VARIATIONS: You can combine these ideas at will; it's hard to go wrong here. Add with the chicken at the beginning of cooking unless otherwise specified. (1) Add a few sprigs of a stronger herb like thyme, sage, oregano, or rosemary. (2) Add several (or many!) cloves of garlic. (3) Add a cup or so of chopped onion, shallot, or leek. (4) Add a cup or so of sliced fresh mushrooms, after the first 15 minutes of roasting. (5) Add a lot of hot dried chiles, a couple of roasted, soaked, and chopped milder chiles, or both. (6) Add 2 or 3 lemons (oranges and limes are good too), cut in half; when the chicken is done, squeeze the hot lemon juice over it. (7) Use peanut oil instead of olive oil and add several slices of ginger and garlic after turning the chicken skin side up again. When chicken is done, drizzle with soy sauce and dark sesame oil, then garnish with scallions and/or cilantro. (8) Use Compound Butter, Flavored Oil, or Vinaigrette from the beginning of the cooking or as a basting sauce during cooking. (9) Rub the chicken with 1/2 cup or so of Pesto or any other herb paste from the beginning of the cooking. (10) Stir in a dollop of grainy French-style mustard when the chicken is done. (11) Add a couple handfuls of cherry tomatoes and some black olives after turning the chicken skin side up again. (12) Stir in a cup of any salsa in the last 10 minutes of cooking or spoon on top of the cooked chicken before serving. (13) Stir a couple tablespoons of any curry powder into a cup of yogurt or coconut milk and spoon or brush it on as a basting sauce during cooking."

      "NOTE: I have found that people tend to fight over the browned top crust of bread pudding so I solved that problem by baking mine in a 10\" round x 4\" deep Pyrex casserole, ensuring everyone of receiving a large portion of browned pudding with enough soft pudding underneath. This meant that I had to use a 17\" x 13\" x 2\" deep broiler pan for the Bain Marie or water bath. If you choose to use a different size baking dish, results may vary, such as a longer baking time. My bread pudding ended up being 2.5\" deep.",
      "Directions for bread pudding:.",
      "Preheat oven to 335 degrees. Fill tea kettle with enough water to fill a 13\" x 17\" pan, half way up with boiling water. Bring water to boil, then turn down heat to a simmer, for later use. Butter the casserole dish; set aside.",
      "Place the 2 cups of milk in a large saucepan, uncovered, over medium heat. Let the milk heat in the pan, without stirring, until a skin forms on top and it is scalded. Or, if this makes you uneasy, stir the milk and continue heating until small bubbles form along the edges of the pan. Remove from heat.",
      "Meanwhile, place the eggs and yolks in a large mixing container with a pouring spout. Beat or whisk briefly, only to mix, not until they are foamy or light. (This beats too much air into the custard)",
      "Gradually add the sugar, vanilla and almond extracts, ground cinnamon, ground ginger and salt, beating only until well mixed.",
      "Using a 1/4 cup measuring cup, slowly add 1/4 cup amounts of the hot milk to the egg mixture, stirring gently. When 1 cup of warm milk has been added into the egg mixture, add the remaining milk and stir gently. This process is called \"tempering\", making sure that your eggs don't \"scramble\" in the pan from the heat of the milk! Set aside custard mixture.",
      "In a large bowl, tear the Hawaiian rolls apart into large chunks, totaling 6 cups. Using a large mesh strainer, pour your custard mixture slowly over the bread roll cubes. (Straining the custard catches any lumpy egg whites.) Stir very gently, making sure that the bread rolls are all thoroughly coated. Allow to rest in the bowl for 10 minutes. Stir twice.",
      "While the bread is soaking up the custard, measure out your frozen berries. I'm lucky enough to have a deep freezer so I have individual bags of the berries, but a quality brand of mixed berries with blueberries, strawberries, raspberries and black raspberries can be used. They should NOT be mashed!",
      "Gently fold the 2 cups of mixed frozen berries into the custard/bread mixture. Pour this into the prepared casserole dish, using a spoon to make sure that the berries are well distributed and that the raspberries are pushed down into the custard, to fill their little centers.",
      "Place the casserole dish into the broiler pan and place this into the oven, leaving the oven door open. Carefully pour the hot, boiling water into the pan, going up to 1/2 the height of the casserole. NOTE: PLEASE BE CAREFUL! I have a long-necked tea kettle so there is no risk of burning myself. However, if you feel more comfortable filling the broiler pan with the hot water prior to placing it into the oven, do what makes sense for YOU!",
      "Bake for 50 to 60 minutes until a sharp knife inserted 1 inch into the middle of the custard comes out clean. Carefully remove the broiler pan and place on a heat-proof surface. Lift the casserole out of the water, place it on a wire rack and cool for 1 hour or until a comfortable eating temperature. Allow water in broiler pan to cool, dump out when safe to the touch.",
      "Serve warm, cool, cold. Plain or with topping of choice. Just enjoy it, however you please!",
      "Directions for Orange Whipped Cream:.",
      "Have ALL of your ingredients and equipment ice cold! I store the beaters in the bowl in my frig and have a small dish of the sifted powdered sugar in there, too. (Sifting the powdered sugar after you've measured it eliminates nasty sugar lumps!)",
      "Remove bowl, beaters, whipping cream and powdered sugar from the refrigerator. Insert beaters into machine, shake whipping cream multiple times to integrate the butter fat; pour into the bowl.",
      "Starting out at the lowest speed, beat whipping cream until it slightly thickens. Starting out at a lower speed prevents splashing all over.",
      "Once cream begins to thicken, increase speed to medium high and whip until soft peaks begin to form. Increase speed to high and slowly add the powdered sugar to the whipped cream, being sure to reach all corners of the bowl if doing this with a hand mixer.",
      "When firm peaks have formed, add vanilla extract and 2-3 drops of orange oil (or orange zest) and blend only until combined, about 10 seconds.",
      "Serve a dollop of this on top of the still warm Very Berry Bread Pudding. The whipped cream is also good in your coffee, with a dash of cinnamon!"

      "1. Preheat oven to 425*F.",
      "2. In a large bowl, combine peaches, 1/4 cup white sugar, 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon, nutmeg, lemon juice, and cornstarch. Toss to coat evenly, and pour into a 2 quart baking dish. Bake in preheated oven for 10 minutes.",
      "3. Meanwhile, in a large bowl, combine flour, 1/4 cup white sugar, 1/4 cup brown sugar, baking powder, and salt. Blend in butter with your fingertips, or a pastry blender, until mixture resembles coarse meal. Stir in water until just combined.",
      "4. Remove peaches from oven, and drop spoonfuls of topping over them. Sprinkle entire cobbler with the sugar and cinnamon mixture. Bake until topping is golden, about 30 minutes.",
      "My Note: You should note however the amount of baking powder - this is a very \"cake-like\" cobbler. Also, the amount of cinammon-sugar on the top makes it very hard to tell when it is \"golden brown\". \"very thin\" slices of peach also lead to a less chunky peachy cobbler than I really like, so you may want to make your slices reasonably substantial if you want good sized chunks of peach.",
      "I would include details on peeling the peaches for newbies. Place the peaches in boiling water for about 60 seconds, remove and plunge into cold water. The skins should slip right off. if you use salted butter cut back on the amount of salt that the recipe calls for by half otherwise the recipe will be really salty. Second, instead of baking it for thirty minutes cut that time in half otherwise it will be over done. Third, instead of 6 tablespoons of butter add 8 tablespoons.",
      "A suggestions to improve it though. First, I used fresh peaches from my son's Georgia peach tree - some of them were quite under-ripe - and the recipe still came out very sweet. I will definitely make this again, but I will use a bit less sugar in the fruit and in the topping. Second, while the topping is super tasty (if a bit sweet), there's not enough of it! It doesn't need to be doubled but maybe 50% more topping would be great.",
      "I tried boiling the peaches to peel them, as suggested, but that didn't quite work out. Instead, I just peeled them with a knife, which worked out just fine and wasn't a hassle at all. When choosing peaches, be sure that they do not have any green on the skin -- this means the fruit hadn't developed before being picked, and it won't get any sweeter afterwards. The crust is unbelievable. When you pour in the boiling hot water, it immediately puffs up into a thick dough. This bakes into a thick, crumb-cake-like topping. The sugar amounts can be adjusted as desired. I found it to be just right. It is incredible with a scoop of vanilla or butter pecan ice cream (or both). My \"southern\" gentleman companion, who has had his share of peach cobblers, really enjoyed it!"
