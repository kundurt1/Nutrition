      "Line two baking sheets with parchment paper and keep them close at hand. Divide the pastry in half and work with one half at a time; keep the other half in the refrigerator.",
      "Working on a floured surface, roll one piece of the puff pastry into a circle that is about 1/8-inch thick. Using a pan lid or the bottom of a tart pan, cut a circle that is about 9 inches in diameter. Transfer the circle to a lined baking sheet, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate. Roll the second piece of pastry out in the same manner, but this time cut out a circle that is about 9 1/2 inches in diameter. Place this circle on the other baking sheet, cover and refrigerate as well.",
      "Whisk the almond cream, pastry cream, and rum together in a bowl, stirring just to blend the two creams, not to whip air into them. In a small bowl, beat the egg just to break it up.",
      "Remove the smaller circle of pastry from the refrigerator and paint the outer 1 inch border with a light coating of beaten egg. Spoon the almond-pastry cream mixture onto the pastry and spread it smooth across the circle, stopping when you reach the egg-painted border. Put the trinket anywhere on top of the cream and press it gently into the cream. Cover the cream-coated circle with the top (larger) round of puff pastry, pressing it firmly around the border to glue the two pieces together. You have some choices here, you can press the edges together with the tines of a fork to both decorate and seal them, or you can use a small sharp paring knife to create a scallop pattern all around the border. Whatever you do, the important thing is to make certain that the edges are sealed.",
      "Brush the entire top of the galette with the beaten egg, then, using the tip of a paring knife, decorate the top by drawing curved lines from the center of the galette to the edges. The lines will resemble backward C's or quotation marks. Don't worry about the design-even if you make straight lines radiating from the center out, your galette will be attractive. The only important thing here is not to pierce the dough. Cut a small circle of dough, a steam vent, out of the center of the galette, slide the galette into the refrigerator, and chill it for at least 30 minutes while you preheat the oven. (",
      ")",
      "Center a rack in the oven and preheat the oven to 475\u00b0F. (If you are using storebought puff pastry, follow the temperature instructions on the package.)",
      "Slip the galette into the oven and immediately lower the temperature to 400\u00b0F. Bake the galette for 40 minutes, until it is beautifully puffed and deeply golden brown. If, after 20 minutes, the galette is browning too quickly, cover it loosely with a foil tent. Remove the galette from the oven, place the baking sheet on a cooling rack, and allow the galette to cool for 10 minutes before serving. Many consider the galette at its best when it is served hot or warm, but it is still delicious at room temperature.",
      "Although the constructed galette can be chilled for a day or frozen for up to a month, once it is baked it should be served that day.",
      "Working in a food processor, put the butter and confectioners' sugar in the workbowl. Process until the mixture is smooth and satiny. Add the ground almonds and continue to process until well blended. Add the flour and cornstarch, process, then add the egg. Process for about 15 seconds more, or until the almond cream is homogeneous. Scrape the almond cream into a container and either use immediately or refrigerate until firm. (Keeping: The almond cream can be packed airtight and kept in the refrigerator for up to 4 days or frozen for up to 1 month. Defrost, still wrapped, overnight in the refrigerator, then beat it with a spatula or spoon to bring back its original consistency.)",
      "Bring the milk and vanilla bean (pulp and pod) to a boil in a small saucepan over medium heat. Cover the pan, turn off the heat, and allow the milk to infuse for at least 10 minutes or for up to 1 hour.",
      "If the milk has cooled, it will need to be reheated now.",
      "Whisk the yolks, sugar, and cornstarch together in a heavy-bottomed medium saucepan. Whisking constantly, drizzle one-quarter of the hot milk over the yolks. When the yolks are warm, whisk the remainder of the milk into the yolks in a steadier stream; remove and discard the pod (or save it to make vanilla sugar).",
      "Put the pan over medium heat and, whisking vigorously, bring the mixture to the boil. Keep at the boil-still whisking energetically-for 1 to 2 minutes before pulling the pan from the heat and pressing the cream through a sieve into the small bowl. Let the cream sit for 5 minutes, then whisk in the butter. Cover the cream with a piece of plastic wrap-press the wrap against the cream-and refrigerate until thoroughly chilled. You can speed up the chill by putting the bowl in a larger bowl filled with ice cubes and cold water. (Keeping: Covered tightly with plastic wrap, pastry cream can be refrigerated for 2 days. To smooth the chilled cream, whisk it for a few seconds.)"

      "Place a small plate in the freezer to use later for testing the doneness of your marmalade. Wash your jam jars thoroughly and let them dry completely.",
      "Wash and dry the citrus well. Trim away the ends of the fruit, then slice each into quarters. Remove the seeds from the lemon. Using a sharp knife, slice away the citrus flesh from the peels (some tangerines peel quite easily-lemons are a bit more challenging). Slice the lemon and tangerine peels into thin strips, about 1/8 inch wide (or 1/16 inch wide if you like a more delicate marmalade).",
      "Fill a pot with water and bring to a boil over high heat. Add the peels only (not the flesh) and let them simmer for just 2 minutes (to help diminish any bitter flavor from the pith). Remove from the heat, drain, and set aside.",
      "In a large heavy-bottomed pot over high heat, bring the citrus flesh and peels and the water to a boil. Decrease the heat to medium-low and simmer until the citrus peels are tender, 20 to 25 minutes.",
      "Add the sugar and honey and stir well until both dissolve into the mixture. Increase the heat to medium and return to a boil. If there are big segments of citrus that haven't yet cooked down, use a wooden spoon to mash them slightly, creating a more even texture. Cook until the marmalade is reduced by half, begins to thicken, and turns an amber color, 35 to 40 minutes (see note, following, on how to gauge doneness). Stir occasionally to ensure it isn't sticking to the pan. Remove from the heat and pour into the prepared glass jars or heatproof airtight containers. Let the marmalade cool completely, uncovered. Cover and store in the refrigerator for up to 3 weeks or in the freezer for up to 6 months.",
      "To test the marmalade for doneness, place a small dab on a plate that's been chilled in the freezer and freeze for 2 minutes. It is done if a thin film develops on the surface and the marmalade stiffens to appear more jammy than liquid-y. If it simply spreads out and thins, it's not done and needs further cooking."

      "Rinse your chicken and dry it very well. Wearing latex gloves, spatchcock the chicken, which involves cutting out the backbone (not the breastbone) with a sharp knife or heavy kitchen scissors. Once the backbone is removed, turn the chicken over and press down on the breastbone gently until the chicken flattens out (you might hear some cracking). Alternatively, your butcher would be happy to do this for you.",
      "Salt the chicken liberally and press the herbs onto its skin, and perhaps some lemon zest if you feel fancy. Heat an oven-safe heavy skillet (it must be a heavy skillet-cast iron is perfect, nonstick won't work) over medium-high heat with a decent coating of oil. When the oil is almost smoking, carefully lay the chicken into the skillet so that it fits snugly. Tuck the legs in if possible. Weight it using either bricks wrapped in tin foil, or a second skillet filled with cans. The second skillet must have a large bottom so that all of the chicken skin is pressed against the hot surface; otherwise, you'll have super-crispy skin only in the center.",
      "Turn the heat to medium-low (there should be an insistent popping noise throughout) and cook for about 20 minutes. In the meantime, preheat the oven to 375\u00b0F. After 20 minutes, check on the chicken skin: it should be bronze and golden. Be careful that it doesn't all stick to the pan when you do: a wooden spoon scraping can help you lift it from the pan still attached to the chicken. If not crispy, increase the heat and cook another 5-10 minutes until it is.",
      "Flip the chicken over so that it's skin-side up and cook in the oven an additional 10-15 minutes, or until the juices run clear or the thigh meat is a safe temperature. I like to make a quick sauce in the skillet after removing the chicken to rest with the juice of one lemon."

      "To prepare your chicken: Take your chicken out of the refrigerator 30 minutes before it goes into the oven. Preheat your oven to 475\u00b0F. There's no need to peel the vegetables-just give them a wash and roughly chop them. Break the garlic bulb into cloves, leaving them unpeeled. Pile all the vegetables and garlic into the middle of a large roasting pan and drizzle with olive oil. Drizzle the chicken with olive oil and season well with salt and pepper, rubbing it all over the bird. Carefully prick the lemon all over, using the tip of a sharp knife (if you have a microwave, you could pop the lemon in there for 40 seconds at this point as this will really bring out the flavor. Put the lemon inside the chicken's cavity, with the bunch of herbs.",
      "Place the chicken on top of the vegetables in the roasting pan and put it into the preheated oven. Turn the heat down immediately to 400\u00b0F and cook the chicken for 1 hour and 20 minutes. Baste the chicken halfway through cooking and if the vegetables look dry, add a splash of water to the pan to stop them burning. When cooked, take the pan out of the oven and transfer the chicken to a board to rest for 15 minutes or so.",
      "Remove any string from the chicken and take off the wings. Carefully cut down between the leg and the breast. Cut through the joint and pull the leg off. Repeat on the other side, then cut each leg between the thigh and drumstick you so end up with four portions of dark meat. Place these on a serving platter. You should now have a clear space to carve the rest of your chicken. Angle the knife along the breastbone and carve one side off, then the other. When you get down to the fussy bits, use your fingers to pull the meat off, then turn the chicken over to get all the tasty, juicy bits from underneath. You should be left with a stripped carcass, and a platter full of lovely meat that you can serve with piping hot gravy, and roasted vegetables."

I didn't believe all the potato would fit in there, but it would have.) When hot, spread the potatoes in the pan and sprinkle on the nutmeg, salt and pepper. Immediately begin turning the potato pieces with a wooden spoon to thoroughly mix in the fat and seasonings.",
      "Flatten the potatoes to a smooth, solid layer, filling the entire pan; then reduce heat to medium-low and cook for 5 to 8 minutes. Near the end of the cooking time, shake and rotate the pan quickly in a clockwise motion-turning it by the handle-to loosen the potato cake from the sides and bottom of the pan. (Ha! It will be a long time before I pull off this kind of maneuver. But it's fun to try.) You should be able to see that the sides of the layer are browning nicely.",
      "Put the skillet in the hot oven and bake for 15 minutes or so, until the top is crusty and lightly colored. Remove the hot pan carefully from the oven and let it sit 30 seconds or so, then immediately cover it with the serving platter and invert to un-mold.",
      "Variation:",
      "(which I recommend). When the potatoes are done-after unmolding if possible, but while they are still in the skillet, if unmolding is not going to happen for you-turn on the broiler. Spread the top of the potatoes with the creme fraiche or sour cream and sprinkle evenly with the grated cheese. Broil 4 or 5 inches from the heat for 3 to 5 minutes, until the top is golden and bubbling."

Save the other crust for a future use. Spoon the apples into the crust. Pour the buttermilk custard over top, ensuring that it thoroughly covers the apples. Bake for 50 to 50 minutes, or until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean.",
      "With a pastry cutter or a fork, cut the shortening and salt into the flour until the mix is pebbly. Add the water and stir with a fork until the dough becomes somewhat sticky. Form dough into a ball, and then cut the ball in half, handling the dough as little as possible. Wrap in plastic and refrigerate, preferably for at least an hour.",
      "In a liquid measuring cup, stir egg yolk with cider vinegar and enough warm water to reach the 1/2 cup mark. Set aside. Put flour, lard, and salt into a mixing bowl. Combine. Add egg mixture, stir, and form two balls. Place one between two sheets of plastic wrap and with a rolling pin press into a disk large enough to overlap the edges of your pie plate. Repeat with second dough ball. Refrigerate doughs for at least an hour.",
      "Pulse flour, salt, and sugar in a food processor until blended. Add butter and shortening and pulse 12 to 14 times or until the mixture looks like clumpy sand. Transfer mixture to a large bowl and gradually spray in enough cold water to form a cohesive and evenly moistened dough that is still not sticky. Work quickly, tossing and stirring with a fork until dough begins to come together. Divide dough in two. Shape each half into a flattened round. Wrap in plastic and chill in the refrigerator for several hours or overnight. To prepare dough for the pie plate, lay down a sheet of wax paper. With a rolling pin, bang out the rounds into crusts, making initial impact at the centermost point before stroking quickly outward. Lift the pin each time before whacking it again. Ten or twelve spankings should do it. This crust recipe works well with just about any filling."

Pry the fish open and scrape and rinse out its innards. Next, lay the fish, flesh side down, on a work surface. Grasping the tail and working from tail to head, drag the blunt edge of the knife the length of the fish to remove the scales. Rinse the fish well, pat dry, and repeat with the remaining fish, then clean your work surface before proceeding.",

Starting at the head end, pull the backbone towards the tail in a single motion. (Part of the tail may come off with the backbone.) Rinse the sardine under cold running water, checking for any loose bones, and then pat dry. Repeat with the remaining sardines.",

Stop and scrape down the sides of the bowl as needed. Once the eggs are all added, raise the speed to high speed and beat for 1 minute to add a little extra air to build structure.",
      "Transfer some of the dough to the pastry bag. Carefully pipe tall strips of dough to fit the templates. The strips should be about 3/4 inch tall so that they rise sufficiently. When they are all piped, brush each eclair with egg wash using a pastry brush. Gently brush the back of a fork along each eclair to make grooves down the length of them. This helps them bake evenly. You can scrape up and re-pipe any mistakes, but they will not rise quite as well.",

Immediately pierce each end of the eclairs with the large end of a chopstick to release the steam. Transfer the eclairs to wire racks and let cool completely.",

Carefully fill the eclairs with pastry cream, piping it into the hole on the end without letting it seep out, but making sure there is pastry cream throughout the whole eclair.",

Dip the top of each filled eclair in the warm ganache, letting the excess drip off. Set the finished eclairs on wire racks to dry. Once the ganache is dry, serve the eclairs immediately or refrigerate for up to 3 hours.",

Pour the hot ganache through a fine-mesh sieve into a clean heatproof bowl.",

      "In the jar, combine the lemon juice and salt. Cover with the lid and shake to dissolve the salt. Add the cream, chives, and lemon zest. Shake to blend. Taste for seasoning. The dressing can be used immediately. (Store the dressing in the refrigerator for up to 1 week. Shake to blend again before using.) But will it curdle? Given the right circumstances, such as the addition of acids or heat, any milk or cream product will curdle (meaning the curd protein coagulates and forms clumps). The greater the fat content of the milk or cream, the more it will resist curdling. I use a light cream with a 12% fat content, much like what is also called half-and-half, and have never had a problem with curdling when adding lemon juice to the cream.",

Plunge the asparagus into a bowl of ice water so they cool down as quickly as possible and retain their crispness and bright green color. (The asparagus will cool in 1 to 2 minutes.

      "First, prepare the orange segments. Slice a thin layer off the top and bottom of the orange, then place the orange right side up on the cutting board and simply slice the peel downward, using a chef's knife and following the natural curve of the orange. A little of the white part (called the pith) is okay; just try to get as much orange as you can. Then slice the orange widthwise and cut each piece into q-inch segments. Then toast the sesame seeds. Preheat a small, heavy-bottomed pan over medium-low heat. Place the sesame seeds in the pan and stir often for about 2 minutes. They should be toasting by then (if not, then raise the heat). Use a spatula to toss continuously for another minute or so, until they are varying shades of toasty brown. Remove from the pan ASAP to prevent burning. Pour the dressing into a large mixing bowl. Add the wild rice, currants, and lettuce. Using tongs, toss to coat. Add the orange segments and sesame seeds, and toss again. Last, fold in the beets. Serve.",
      "Unwrapping a tinfoil beet is a lot like unwrapping a present. Well, maybe not really, because you know exactly what's going to be in there, but it's still somehow such an exciting surprise. roasting brings out the beet's sweet flavor, so they're like precious rubies in a candy box when ready to eat. I usually do two pounds at a time on a weeknight or Sunday afternoon, and use some of them that evening as a side dish with whatever I'm eating. Then I refrigerate the rest and use them in salads or just for a quick snack throughout the week. The cooking method and time really varies depending on the size of the beets you're using. If using small beets, say golf ball size, and they are very fresh, then don't bother to peel them first. Just slice in half, wrap in foil, and roast. And remember to save the beet greens to saute with some olive oil and garlic. But if using those big honkers of a beet that you're more likely to find come January and February, then it's a little different. Peel them and then slice top down into segments (like orange slices) that are about P inch thick at their widest. If a beet is especially big-say, softball size-then I sometimes will slice widthwise, too. Then, keeping all the slices together in a neat package, place on tinfoil and wrap so that you can easily unfold it from the top. roasting times will vary, but I do at least an hour at 425\u00b0F. They're ready when pierced easily with a fork. Be careful when handling, because there will be a lot of red beet juice justdying to drizzle out and stain your countertops. Although maybe that could look cool.",
      "Vigorously mix together all the ingredients. Just mix them right into a measuring cup so as not to use too many dishes. If you're using the dressing for a grain salad, you can also mix it directly into the large mixing bowl that you will use to prepare your salad. Keep refrigerated in a tightly sealed container until ready to use."

Add the remaining flour mixture to the large bowl and stir until it is incorporated and a soft, ragged dough forms.",

Knead the dough about 10 strokes: push down and away with the heel of your hand against the surface, then fold the dough in half toward you, and rotate it a quarter turn, flouring the surface as necessary to prevent sticking. The dough is ready when it looks fairly smooth, feels very soft, and there is no loose flour. Pat the dough into a rectangle about 12 by 7 in by and 3/8 in thick.",

If any dough sticks to the surface, use the spatula to spread the dough back onto the dough cylinder. Pinch the ends to seal. The roll will be about 11 in long. Using a sharp knife, cut the cylinder crosswise into 9 rolls each about 11/4 in thick.

Liberally flour the top of the dough (it will be sticky, don't be afraid to use flour) and press it flat. Then, use a rolling pin to make the dough an even 1/2 inch thick.

The goal is to get the oil to reach 375\u00b0F and it is important to watch the pot at all times to maintain that temperature (and for safety). Set up a cooling rack covered with paper towels next to the stove and get tongs, spiders, chopsticks, or strainers ready (whatever you prefer to turn the doughnuts and remove them from the hot oil). On another burner, warm the milk in a small saucepan set over low heat until the milk begins to steam.

Pour the glaze into a bowl and set the bowl over a small saucepan of water and set aside.",

Cake doughnuts will sink to the bottom of the oil, then cook for a bit before rising up. Once the doughnut bobs to the surface, fry it for approximately 2 minutes more before turning it and fry for an additional 2 minutes on the other side. Place the doughnuts on the prepared cooling rack. Break one open to ensure that it is cooked, and if additional time is needed, add the doughnuts back to the oil to finish and add a bit more cooking time for the rest. Fry the rest in similar fashion, and allow all of the doughnuts to cool.",
      "Place the pot of water with the bowl of glaze set over it over low heat and stir to bring it back to a gooey liquid. Remove from heat and use your fingers to carefully submerge each of the doughnuts in the glaze. Place the glazed doughnuts on a clean cooling rack to dry. The glaze will become more translucent as it dries. For best flavor, serve immediately."

After the final rise, make 3 or 4 long, diagonal cuts in the top of each loaf with a razor. Bake.",

After the final rise but without slashing the top of the loaf, use sharp scissors to make diagonal cuts 3 inches long into each side of the baguette. You want about 4 cuts per side, and the cuts on each side should be parallel to each other, creating a series of points. Pull the points out from the baguette so that they resemble leaves or an ear of wheat. Spray with water and bake immediately, without leaving the bread to rise again."

Saute until the onion is soft and beginning to brown, about 10 minutes. Add the garlic and saute for 2 minutes. Stir in the greens and stock and bring to a simmer. Decrease the heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the greens are tender, about 45 minutes. Stir in the bell pepper and jalapeno. Increase the heat to medium-high, cover, and simmer for 2 minutes. Taste and season with more salt if desired.",

Add the remaining 1 cup stock and simmer for 10 minutes, whisking occasionally, until most of the liquid has been absorbed. Stir in the cashew cream, cover, and simmer, whisking frequently, until the grits are soft and fluffy, about 30 minutes.",

Add a splash of liqueur, if you'd like, and stir in the black pepper, basil, mint or zest, if you feel like it. (Use a light touch with the extras - the berries are the main event and anything else should be there only to enhance their flavor.)",
      "Spoon the berries and any juices that have accumulated over the slices of crust. Don't try to be neat - the berries should tumble over the sides of the crust.",
      "Top with the cream or serve it alongside.",
      "While you can bake the crust early in the day (or, in a pinch, the day before) and keep it at room temperature, and you can also cut and sugar the berries about an hour in advance, the tart should be assembled just before serving.",
      "Put the flour, sugar and salt in the bowl of a food processor and pulse a few times to combine. Scatter the pieces of butter over the dry ingredients and pulse until the butter is coarsely cut inyou should have pieces the size of oatmeal flakes and some the size of peas. Stir the yolk, just to break it up, and add it a little at a time, pulsing after each addition. When the egg is in, process in long pulsesabout 10 seconds eachuntil the dough, which will look granular soon after the egg is added, forms clumps and curds. Just before you reach this stage, the sound of the machine working the dough will changeheads up. Turn the dough out onto a work surface and, very lightly and sparingly, knead the dough just to incorporate any dry ingredients that might have escaped mixing.",
      "To roll or press the dough into the pan: Butter a 9-inch fluted tart pan with a removable bottom.",
      "If you want to roll the dough, chill it for about 2 hours before rolling (unless you've used frozen butter and the dough comes out of the processor firm and cold, in which case you can roll it immediately). I find it easiest to roll this dough out between two sheets of plastic film - make sure to peel away the film frequently, so it doesn't get rolled into the dough. If you want to use the press-in method, you can work with the dough as soon as it's processed. Just press the dough evenly over the bottom and up the sides of the pan. Don't be too heavy-handed - press the crust in so that the edges of the pieces cling to one another, but don't press so hard that the crust loses its crumbly texture.",
      "Freeze the crust for at least 30 minutes, preferably longer, before baking.",
      "To fully bake the crust: Center a rack in the oven and preheat the oven to 375\u00b0F.",
      "Butter the shiny side of a piece of aluminum foil (or use nonstick foil) and fit the foil, buttered side down, tightly against the crust. (Since you froze the crust, you can bake it without weights.) Put the tart pan on a baking sheet and bake the crust for 25 minutes. Carefully remove the foil. If the crust has puffed, press it down gently with the back of a spoon (or prick it with the tip of a small knife). Bake the crust for another 8 minutes or so, or until it is firm and golden brown, brown being the important word: a pale crust doesn't have a lot of flavor. Transfer the pan to a rack and cool the crust to room temperature.",
      "The dough can be wrapped and kept in the refrigerator for up to 5 days or frozen for up to 2 months. While the fully baked crust can be packed airtight and frozen for up to 2 months, I prefer to freeze the unbaked crust in the pan and bake it directly from the freezer - it has a fresher flavor. Just add about 5 minutes to the baking time."

Affix the bowl to the mixer and fit with the paddle. Mix on low speed just until the dough is cohesive, adding more flour as needed. The dough should be soft and tacky to the touch, so do not add too much flour. Also, the dough will be worked during the rolling and folding process, so it is not necessary to knead it at this point.",
      "Gather up the dough and turn out onto a lightly floured work surface. Pat and shape into a 1 in/2.5 cm-thick rectangle. Wrap the dough tightly in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for at least 2 and up to 4 hours. The dough will not rise much.",

      "Using your fingertips, starting at the left side of the dough, smear the processed butter over two thirds of the dough, leaving the right third unbuttered. Fold the dough into thirds like a business letter: Fold the unbuttered section over the middle section, and then fold the buttered section over the unbuttered third. This is called a turn. Rotate the dough so the long open seam faces you. Roll out the dough again into an 18-by-10-inch rectange. If at any time some of the butter oozes through the dough (it shouldn't), sprinkle some flour over the area to seal it. Repeat the folding into thirds for a second turn, brushing excess flour off the dough as needed. Place on a small baking sheet, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for 20 to 30 minutes. This brief resting period will relax the gluten and lightly chill the butter, making the dough easier to roll and keeping the butter layers from softening.",

      "If you'd like to offer a full five-of-hearts waffle, just put one on a large plate, dust with confectioner's sugar, then scoop some whipped cream or ice cream (or both?) onto the center. Hot fudge sauce is both luscious and luxurious over these. Alternatively, separate the hearts and serve with all the toppings on the side or turn these into crisp cookies (see Playing Around)."

You want to cook the cream until it reaches 180\u00b0F. As you whisk the cream over heat-and you must whisk constantly to keep the eggs from scrambling-you'll see that the cream will start out light and foamy, then the bubbles will get bigger, and then, as the cream is getting closer to 180\u00b0F, it will start to thicken and the whisk will leave tracks. Heads up at this point-the tracks mean the cream is almost ready. Don't stop whisking and don't stop checking the temperature. And have patience-depending on how much heat you're giving the cream, getting to temp can take as long as 10 minutes.",
      "As soon as you reach 180\u00b0F, pull the cream from the heat and strain it into the container of a blender (or food processor); discard the zest. Let the cream rest at room temperature, stirring occasionally, until it cools to 140\u00b0F, about 10 minutes.",
      "Turn the blender to high and, with the machine going, add about 5 pieces of butter at a time. Scrape down the sides of the container as needed while you're incorporating the butter. Once the butter is in, keep the machine going-to get the perfect light, airy texture of lemon-cream dreams, you must continue to beat the cream for another 3 minutes. If your machine protests and gets a bit too hot, work in 1-minute intervals, giving the machine a little rest between beats.",
      "Pour the cream into a container, press a piece of plastic wrap against the surface to create an airtight seal and chill the cream for at least 4 hours or overnight. When you are ready to construct the tart, just whisk the cream to loosen it and spoon it into the tart shell.",
      "The tart should be served cold, because it is a particular pleasure to have the cold cream melt in your mouth.",

If you like, chop the gizzard, heart, and liver to add to the sauce.",
      "3. Rub the inside of the turkey with the lemon, and dry with paper towels. Fill the body cavity and neck cavity with stuffing, but not too tightly - the crumbs should remain somewhat loose. Truss the turkey with a trussing needle, by hand-tying the piece of neck to the back of the turkey, or by sewing with a needle and twine. Close the vent of the bird, and either secure with skewers and twine or sew it up. Tie the legs together firmly, and then tie them to the tail of the bird. Massage the turkey well with softened butter, then salt and pepper it. Line a rack with strips of fresh or salt pork or with the rind of bacon, which you can sometimes buy from your butcher when he cuts down a whole slab. Set the rack in a fairly shallow roasting pan, and place the turkey breast side down on the rack. Roast 1 hour at 350 degrees. Remove the pan from the oven, turn the turkey on one side, and rub with softened butter. Return the turkey to the oven and roast another hour. Remove the pan, turn the turkey on its other side, and rub with butter. Roast for another hour, turn the turkey on its back, and rub the breast with butter. Return to the oven and continue roasting till the turkey tests done. Remove from the oven and place on a hot platter. Allow it to rest 15 minutes if being served hot. If being served tepid, let it cool gently at room temperature. Remove all twine and skewers.",

If there are any juices, add those (skimmed of fat) as well. Gradually stir in 2 cups or more of the turkey broth and cook, stirring constantly, till the mixture thickens. Correct the seasonings. Add the chopped giblets, if you like, and Cognac or Madeira, and simmer about 4 to 5 minutes. Serve with the turkey and stuffing."

    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "Arrange a rack low in the oven, making sure that the fully prepared turkey will fit in easily and roast well below the oven ceiling. Remember that the foil tent will be an inch or 2 higher than the turkey itself. Preheat the oven to 375\u00b0F.",
      "Take out the giblets and neck from the turkey and save. Remove and discard any lumps of fat from the cavities. Rinse the bird inside and out, in cool running water, clearing the cavity of any residue. Rinse the giblets too. Pat everything dry with paper towels.",
      "Set the wire roasting rack in the pan and the turkey on the rack with the neck and giblets in the pan bottom. Sprinkle 2 teaspoons of the kosher salt inside the main turkey cavity and the rest of the salt (1-1/2 tablespoons in all) over the outside of the bird. Pour the olive oil on the turkey, a bit at a time, and spread it with your hands to coat the entire skin, including the back. Twist the tip joint of each wing down and forcefully fold it so it stays in place under the neck (think of placing both your hands behind your neck). Rest the oiled turkey on the rack, flat on its back, wings folded and breast up.",
      "Put a handful or 2 of mixed vegetables(and one of the rosemary branches) loosely into the cavity of the turkey. Spread all the rest in one layer in the pan bottom, all around the turkey. Push the vegetables pieces under the rack, if your pan is small, so they will cook in the stock.",
      "Tear two long sheets of aluminum foil. Cover one side of the pan with the first sheet, arching it well above the turkey. Crimp the foil against the rim of the pan so it stays in place without touching the bird. Cover the rest of the pan and turkey with the second sheet of foil (or more if needed), overlapping the sheets several inches. Press the bottom of the foil tightly against the sides of the pan, all around, sealing the tent completely.",
      "Carefully place the covered pan on the oven rack--it will be heavy so you may need some help. Push it well to the back of the oven for the maximum heat and let the turkey roast undisturbed for 2 hours. Open the oven, pull the roasting pan to the front, and lift off the foil sheets. The pan juices should be bubbling away and the steaming turkey will be mostly pale.) With a ladle or bulb baster, baste the turkey all over with the pan juices and return it to the oven. Save the foil.",
      "Roast the turkey uncovered for 30 minutes to an hour, to brown the skin and cook the meat to a safe internal temperature. (Because every oven thermostat is different and turkeys will vary in size, cooking times will vary.) After 30 minutes, baste again and check the internal temperature of the turkey, then continue roasting, if necessary until the meat is reaches the right temperature. If the breast is getting too dark, cover it loosely with a sheet of foil.",
      "You should have 1 to 2 quarts of pan juices (depending on how much stock you started with and the roasting time). Set the saucepan over high heat, bring the juices to a boil and let them reduce, uncovered.",
      "Make a glaze for turkey by mixing 1/4 cup of balsamic vinegar reduction and 2 tablespoons of the pan sauce, mixing well until it is spreadable: heat and thin it as needed. Put the turkey, still on the rack, back in the empty roasting pan. Brush the glaze all over the bird in a smooth even coat. Return the turkey to the oven for 10 to 15 minutes, or until the glazed skin is crisp, shiny and deeply colored. Let it rest in a warm place. tented with foil, if you wish.",
      "To finish the sauce: pour into the boiling sauce any turkey juices that accumulated in the baking sheet. When the sauce has reduced almost by half, taste it for salt and add a bit more if you like. Remove the turkey neck and giblets and bring back to a simmer.",
      "To serve: for formal occasions, you can present the whole turkey and carve it at the table. For most family dinners, I cut the bird up in the kitchen as follows: cut the wings off, slice the breast meat, then remove the legs at the joint and slice the leg and thigh meat from the bones for dark meat lovers; arrange all the pieces on a serving platter. Pour any juices left in the pan or on the cutting board over the meat, then nap all the pieces with a cup or more of the finished sauce. Bring the platter to the table and let people serve themselves. Put the rest of the sauce in a bowl and pass it."

      "Put the flour, eggs, and egg yolks in the bowl of a standing mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and mix on low speed until the dough comes together. Turn off the mixer, remove the paddle attachment, and replace it with the dough hook. Scrape down the sides of the bowl and beat the dough with the dough hook on medium speed until it forms a ball, about 5 minutes. Dust a flat work surface with flour. Turn the dough out onto the dusted surface and gently knead it for 20 to 25 minutes, until the ball begins to feel elastic and the surface of the dough feels smooth and silky. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate to rest for at least 45 minutes and up to overnight before sheeting it (any longer and the dough will discolor).",
      "Combine the ricotta and Parmigiano-Reggiano in a medium bowl, and sprinkle with the salt, sugar, and nutmeg. Stir to combine the seasonings with the cheese. Stir in the cream, adding more if necessary to obtain the consistency of soft- serve ice cream. (You can make the filling up to two days in advance. Transfer it to an airtight container and refrigerate until you are ready to assemble the ravioli.) Scoop up 1/3 cup of the ricotta filling and form it into a disk about 1/2 inch high and 2 1/4 inches in diameter. Set the disk on a plate and repeat, forming the remaining ricotta into a total of 8 disks. Set them aside while you prepare the dough for the ravioli.",
      "To make the ravioli, cut eight 4-inch square pieces of parchment and dust two baking sheets with semolina. Roll the dough out to the third thinnest setting on a pasta sheeter (number 6 using a KitchenAid attachment), stacking the sheets of dough on one of the parchment-lined baking sheets. When you have rolled out all of the dough, dust a flat work surface with flour and lay one sheet of the dough on the floured surface. Place three or four ricotta disks on the dough, leaving 4 inches between each disk and 1 1/2 to 2 inches of dough on all the sides of the outer disks. Use the back of a spoon or your fingers to make a crater deep enough to hold an egg yolk in the center of each disk. Separate one egg, reserving the white and carefully sliding the yolk into one crater. Repeat, filling the remaining 2 or 3 disks in the same way (you don't need to reserve any more whites).",
      "Lay a second sheet of dough directly behind the first and use a rolling pastry cutter, starting at the edge of the dough nearest your body and moving in a straight line directly away from you, making one long cut through both sheets of dough between two disks of ricotta. Continue making cuts down the sheet of dough between the disks. Using a pastry brush, brush egg white around each cheese disk. Lift one segment of dough from the back sheet and lay it on top of the corresponding front segment of dough. Without lifting the raviolo, cup both hands around the cheese so that the edges of your pinky fingers press down around the cheese, sealing the raviolo closed. Repeat, covering and sealing the remaining ravioli. Use a 3 x 3 inch fluted cookie cutter or fluted pastry wheel to cut each raviolo, discarding the scraps of dough around it. Place the ravioli on the prepared baking sheet and repeat, assembling the remaining ravioli in the same way. Cover the baking sheet with plastic wrap and refrigerate until you are ready to boil them, or for up to 8 hours.",
      "Fill two wide pots with 6 quarts of water each. Add 6 tablespoons of salt to each pot and bring to a boil over high heat. Have a slotted spatula or slotted spoon and a clean dishtowel handy for lifting the ravioli out of the water.",
      "While the water is coming to a boil, make the brown butter sauce. Place the butter and sage leaves in a medium saucepan and cook over medium-high heat for 3 to 5 minutes without stirring, swirling the pan occasionally to brown the butter evenly and prevent it from burning, until the bubbles subside and the butter is dark brown with a nutty, toasty smell. Reduce the heat to low to keep the butter warm while you cook the pasta.",
      "Remove the ravioli from the refrigerator and, one at a time, lift the parchment holding each raviolo off the baking sheet and gently drop the raviolo with the paper into the water, adding 4 ravioli to each pot. (The parchment will quickly separate and will be easy to remove from the water.) When you have dropped all the ravioli, remove and discard the parchment paper, partially cover the pots to return the water to a boil quickly, and keep it boiling. Cook the ravioli for 4 minutes. With a clean dishtowel in one hand and a slotted spoon or spatula in the other, lift one raviolo out of the water and onto the dishtowel to blot it dry, and then carefully place it in the center of a dinner plate.",
      "Repeat with the remaining ravioli. Pour the brown butter over the ravioli, dividing it evenly. Place one of the sage leaves on top of each raviolo, discarding the remaining leaves. Use a microplane or another fine grater to grate a light dusting of Parmigiano-Reggiano over each raviolo, and serve."

While you're mixing, periodically stop the mixer and scrape down the bottom and sides of the bowl. The mixture will progress from a thin, watery liquid to a glaze-like texture to an extremely thick dough.",
      "Once all of the sugar is incorporated, dust a work surface (I used a silicone mat) with some of your confectioners' sugar and scrape the candy out onto the work surface. The candy will be very sticky and stiff. Generously dust the top of the ball of candy with confectioners' sugar, and begin to knead the candy like bread dough, folding the ball of dough over onto itself, then use the heel of your hand to push it down. Give the candy a quarter-turn, and repeat the process, dusting it with more confectioners' sugar as often as necessary to prevent it from sticking to the board or your hands. Knead until the candy is no longer sticky, but smooth. The original recipe called the target texture \"satiny\", but I found it kind of like the texture of a pliable clay.",
      "Decide how many colors and flavors of conversation hearts you want to make, and divide the candy dough into that many portions. To flavor and color the candy, take one of the balls and flatten it into a palm-sized disc. Add a few drops of food coloring and a small dot of flavoring extract to the center of the disc, and fold it over on itself. (",
      "It is a good idea to wear disposable plastic gloves during this step, or you will end up with hands that look like they've been tie-dyed). Knead the dough ball, just as you did before, until the color is evenly dispersed throughout the candy, and all streaks have disappeared. Repeat this process with remaining balls of candy dough until all of the bits are colored and flavored.",
      "The mixing of the color and flavor into the dough does take some time. As I finished coloring each ball of dough, I wrapped each securely in plastic wrap so that they wouldn't dry out while I finished the rest.",
      "Dust your work surface and a rolling pin with confectioners' sugar, and roll out one of the candy balls to your desired thickness. I rolled mine to about 1/3 inch thick for fairly fat little candies, but really, you can roll it to any thickness you like. Be aware that the thinner you roll it, the more fragile the candy will be.",
      "Use heart-shaped cutters to cut hearts out of the rolled candy, and transfer the hearts to a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. As the original recipe aptly notes, smaller hearts are more realistic, but larger hearts are easier for writing messages. Once you have cut out your hearts, you can re-roll the scraps to get more shapes out of the candy. Repeat with remaining candy balls.",
      "Allow your hearts to air-dry for at least 24 hours before writing on them. This step is VERY important, because the extra moisture in the hearts will cause the ink to run if you do not let them dry properly.",
      "I tried writing on some hearts at 24 hours and some at 48 hours--while the ones that dried for only 24 hours were fine to write on, the ones that had dried for 48 hours were an even better writing surface.",

    "title": "scooped: smoked chocolate and tequila ice cream recipe",
    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "In a large, heavy bottomed pot heat the half-and-half over a low/medium flame with the spices (cinnamon, black cardamom, star anise and coffee) until infused with flavor, about 30 to 40 minutes.",
      "In another pot, mix the turbinado sugar, 2 tablespoons of tequila and a little water (about 1/4 cup) and cook over medium heat to caramelize the sugar, about 7 to 8 minutes.",
      "While the caramel sauce is still warm, pour it (carefully) into the pot with the half-and-half and spices. It may bubble and foam, so pour slowly and steadily, and stir as you pour.",
      "Pour the honey into the same pot you used to caramelize the sugar, and cook over a low flame until that begins to caramelize as well, about 5 minutes. Mix it into the pot with the half-and-half.",
      "In a mixing bowl, whisk the egg yolks until the color lightens, about 4 to 5 minutes of continuous whisking.",
      "Temper the eggs into the pot.",
      "This process is actually fairly easy, it just takes a little patience. To temper eggs, you need to warm them up before pouring them into the hot half-and-half; if you pour the cold yolks directly into the pot, they'll curdle and you'll wind up with scrambled eggs floating in your ice cream base. Start by scooping a few ladlefuls of hot half-and-half into your eggs, and mix well to incorporate. When the outside of the mixing bowl is warm to the touch, you'll know the eggs are ready. Pour them slowly and carefully back into the pot, using a rubber spatula to scrape out the bowl. Mix to make sure all the yolks are dissolved into the half-and-half.",
      "Continue to cook the ice cream base over low/medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the mixture thickens and coats the back of a spoon, about 8 to 10 minutes. If you have a thermometer handy, the mixture should heat up to 160\u00b0F to ensure that the eggs have been cooked thoroughly.",
      "Put the chocolate in a mixing bowl, and pour the hot ice cream base through a mesh strainer into the bowl and over the chocolate. The heat from the liquid will melt the chocolate, so stir it around to make sure it gets mixed and melted evenly. If you have an immersion blender, use it. If not, simple mixing with a wooden spoon or spatula will do the trick.",
      "Once the chocolate has been fully melted, pour about 6 tablespoons of tequila into the bowl. This is pushing the upper limit of the amount of alcohol an ice cream can contain and still be able to freeze-if you're not into the taste of tequila, only use 3 tablespoon or choose another alcohol that you like better. If you want an ice cream that's really boozy, put 8 (or more) but remember that your final product will melt faster with more alcohol.",
      "Chill the base in the fridge overnight. Letting the ice cream base age overnight allows the fats to crystallize and proteins to hydrate-in English, it makes the texture incomparably smooth when you spin it in your machine the next morning. If you can't wait overnight, leave the base in the fridge until cool, about 4 hours.",
      "Spin the base in your ice cream machine, then store in the freezer for another hour or two-or just eat it right away! Garnish with a little sea salt, or smoked salt if you want to be really classy, for an incredible sweet-savory combination."

    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "Make the strudel dough. Combine the flour, oil and salt in the work bowl of a food processor. With the motor running, add 1/2 cup of the water and process until the mixture forms a smooth, silky dough. If the mixture is too dry, add more water, one tablespoon at a time, stopping the motor after each, until the dough is the proper consistency. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead, adding flour as necessary to prevent the dough from sticking to your hands and the work surface, until the dough is very smooth and elastic, about 3 minutes. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and let it rest at room temperature 2 to 3 hours or in the refrigerator for up to 2 days. (Remove refrigerated dough to room temperature at least 1 hour before rolling the dough.)",
      "To make the dough by hand: Pile the flour in a mound in a medium-size mixing bowl. Make a deep well in the mound and add 1/2 cup water, the oil and salt. Beat the wet ingredients with a fork while gradually incorporating the flour from the sides of the well. When the dough is too stiff to mix with the fork begin kneading in the flour with your hands. If the mixture is too dry, add more water, one tablespoon at a time, mixing well after each, until the dough is the proper consistency. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead as above.",
      "In a small bowl toss the raisins with the rum. Let them stand, tossing occasionally, while preparing the strudel.",
      "With a fine grater, remove the zest--bright yellow part of the skin without the underlying white pith--from the lemon. Squeeze the juice from the lemon, strain it if necessary and combine the juice and zest in a medium-size mixing bowl.",
      "In a medium-size skillet, melt 4 tablespoons of the butter over medium heat. Add the bread crumbs and toast, stirring constantly, until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Remove the skillet from the heat and stir in 1/2 cup of the sugar and the cinnamon.",
      "Add the remaining 1 cup sugar and the rum and raisins to the bowl with the lemon juice and zest.",
      "With a paring knife, peel the apples and cut them into quarters. Cut away the seeds and cores and cut the apple quarters into 1/2-inch-thick wedges. Add the apple wedges to the bowl containing the lemon-sugar mixture as you work to prevent them from darkening. Let the apples stand, toss them occasionally, until the sugar begins to dissolve and the apples are coated with the syrup.",
      "If necessary, remove the strudel dough from the refrigerator. Preheat the oven to 450\u00b0F and brush a large (about 18- x 12-inch) baking pan with olive oil.",
      "Lightly flour a large, smooth wooden or marble surface. With a rolling pin--preferably a long, dowel-shaped rolling pin--roll out the dough from the center to the edges into a very thin rectangle that measures about 36 x 24 inches. The dough will give you a little fight at first, but will relax more the more you roll it. As it gets thinner, you should be able to pull and stretch it gently with your hands to coax it into the shape you want. Don't worry if the dough tears a little in spots--you can patch it later--or if it doesn't form a perfect rectangle. Flour the rolling surface and pin lightly as you work to prevent the dough from sticking.",
      "Arrange the dough with one of the longer sides facing you. Arrange a kitchen towel or length of double-thick cheesecloth so it underlaps the entire far side of the dough rectangle by about 4 inches. (This will help you move the strudel to the baking sheet once it is formed.) Spread the bread crumb mixture evenly over the dough leaving a clean 1 1/2-inch-wide border on all sides of the rectangle. Dot the breadcrumbs with small pieces of the remaining 4 tablespoons butter. Arrange the apple mixture in a long mound along the side closest to you. The mound of apples should measure about 4 inches wide and as long as the bread crumb mixture, leaving the 1 1/2-inch-wide border clean.",
      "Fold the clean border closest to you over the apples. Begin rolling the strudel into a fairly tight roll, starting at one end of the apple mound, giving it a half-roll and gradually working your way down the roll. Repeat as necessary, working your way down gradually down the roll each time. Don't worry if the roll is uneven or tears in places. You should end up with a fairly even, lumpy looking roll that is centered, seam side down, on the kitchen towel. Use the towel to transfer the strudel to the prepared baking sheet, bending the strudel into crescent shape if necessary to fit it on the pan.",
      "Seal the ends of the strudel by folding the ends of the roll underneath and pressing them firmly with your fingers. Cut off excess dough. Brush the strudel lightly with olive oil and place in preheated oven. Immediately reduce the oven temperature to 375\u00b0F. Bake 30 minutes. Check the strudel: the top should be a light golden brown. If deeper in color than that, reduce the temperature to 350\u00b0F. Rotate the baking pan in the oven so the strudel cooks evenly. Continue baking until the strudel is deep golden brown and the crust is firm, about 30 minutes. Remove the strudel from the oven and cool 30 minutes. With two metal spatulas, carefully lift the strudel to a wire cooling rack and let stand until completely cooled.",
      "To serve, cut the strudel into 1-inch-thick slices and sprinkle them with powdered sugar."

    "title": "butter and sage gnudi from 'jamie oliver's comfort food'",
    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "Put the ricotta into a bowl with a pinch of sea salt and black pepper, then finely grate in the Parmesan and a few scrapings of nutmeg. Beat it together, then have a taste to check that the balance of seasoning is right-you want the nutmeg to be very subtle. Generously cover a large tray with semolina, then roll the ricotta mixture into 1-inch balls, rolling them in the tray of semolina as you go until very well coated. You should get around 40 gnudi from this amount of mixture. Shake and cover very well with the semolina and leave for 8 hours, or preferably overnight, in the fridge (don't cover the tray)-the semolina will dehydrate the ricotta, giving the gnudi a lovely fine coating.",
      "The gnudi will only take 3 minutes to cook, and I like to cook them in two-portion batches to take care of them. So, shake the excess semolina off two portions' worth of gnudi and cook them in boiling salted water while you melt a large pat of butter in a frying pan on a medium heat and pick in about 20 sage leaves to crisp up. Remove the crispy leaves to a plate and scoop the gnudi directly from the water into the frying pan, adding a spoonful of the cooking water. When the butter and water have emulsified, take off the heat and grate over a layer of Parmesan, add just a few drops of lemon juice, then toss together. Serve in warm bowls straightaway, with an extra grating of nutmeg and Parmesan and the crispy sage leaves, while you get on with the next batch, wiping the frying pan clean between batches. Welcome to the naked club.",
      "Gnudi can be easily transformed with the addition of one seasonal ingredient. Asparagus tips, podded peas, wild mushrooms, or a few fresh tomatoes-any of these with that sage butter will rock the party. In summer, some smashed fresh basil leaves in the ricotta mixture are lovely; or in winter, a splash of quality red wine used to deglaze the frying pan adds much deliciousness."
