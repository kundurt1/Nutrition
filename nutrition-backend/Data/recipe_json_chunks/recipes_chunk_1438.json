      "Divide butter between 2 nonstick frying pans, 12 to 14 inches wide; melt over medium-high heat. Stir 1/4 cup sugar into each. Lay apples equally in pans. Cook until wedges are browned and soft but still hold their shape, 15 to 20 minutes; turn as needed.",
      "Set a slice of toast on each dinner plate; arrange apples equally beside toast and place in a 150\u00b0 oven.",
      "Quickly rinse and dry frying pans; place over high heat. When hot, fill with a single layer of foie gras; pieces can touch but shouldn't be crowded. Brown on 1 side, about 30 seconds; turn and brown other side, about 30 seconds more. As slices are browned, quickly put on toast and keep warm. To reduce spattering, pour fat from pan as it accumulates; reserve for other uses.",
      "Pour all but 3 tablespoons drippings from 1 pan. Add broth and vinegar to pan and bring to a boil over high heat. Pour hot dressing over greens, mix, and mound beside apples and toast. Serve at once, adding salt to taste.",
      "Handling and cooking foie gras: Keep foie gras chilled until you use it - up to a week sealed in its wrapper. (Foie gras gets soft and difficult to handle when warm.) To saute foie gras, you need a hot pan and good ventilation, because the rendered fat spatters and smokes. Pour off the fat as it accumulates and use oven mitts to protect your hands.",
      "Nutrition information is not available, but foie gras is very high in fat."

Add 1 tablespoon of the tomato paste and cook, stirring, until glossy, about 2 minutes. Slowly pour in the stock, stirring with a wooden spoon to release any browned bits on the bottom of the pot. Add the bay leaves and bring to a boil. Skim the surface of the stock, reduce the heat to low and simmer for 1 1/2 hours, skimming occasionally.",

Skim the fat from the surface of the stock and reserve the stock.",

Add the garlic, scallion whites, celery, onions, green peppers and finely chopped andouille sausage. Cook over low heat, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables soften, about 15 minutes. Add the thyme, cayenne, 1 teaspoon of salt and 1/4 teaspoon of pepper and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon of tomato paste and cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Gradually whisk in the reserved stock. Simmer over low heat for 1 hour, skimming occasionally.",

Add the shrimp and simmer for 1 minute. Turn off the heat and let the gumbo stand for a few minutes. Stir in the file powder and scallion greens and serve hot.",
      "Make Ahead: The recipe can be prepared through Step 3 up to 3 days ahead and refrigerated. Reheat gently and proceed.",

      "Notes: File powder is made from ground, dried sassafras leaves. It acts as a thickener for stews and should be added at the very end to avoid over-thickening. It's available in the spice section of most supermarkets."

      "Wine note: This squash soup has a unique spicy-sweet flavor, thanks to the garam masala and maple syrup. It pairs exceptionally well with an aromatic white wine like viognier. Yalumba's Eden Valley Viognier 2007 (Eden Valley, Australia) is fantastic, with lively lime and ginger aromas and a clean, pure flavor, all for about $ -Karen MacNeil"
