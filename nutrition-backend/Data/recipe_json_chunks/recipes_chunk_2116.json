      "Mix the water and oil, then add the dough and boil it.",
      "The dough will float to the surface; the boiling time depends on the thickness and size of the dough sheets...",

      "If it's 1 mm thick, cook for about 4 minutes, and it's 2 mm thick or so, cook for 5 to 6 minutes.",
      "Ideally, for the most authentic results, the dough should fit the baking dish exactly!",
      "But that's a bit hard to achieve, so you can cut it in half to fit.",
      "Boil the cut off end pieces of the noodles, too.",
      "These will be used like puzzle pieces in the lasagna.",
      "The boiling times for the noodles are for reference only.",

      "Start with a layer of bechamel sauce, followed by a layer of meat sauce.",

      "If you are using a dish of about the size specified here, you should be able to make about 4 layers total.",
      "It might be best to divide the sauce into 4 portions beforehand.",
      "Add a layer of noodles after the meat sauce layer!",
      "Repeat the layers.",
      "Even if the lasagna noodles are in pieces, you can fit them together like a puzzle without any gaps as shown.",
      "Since the lasagna noodles become thicker when they're cooked; if you roll them out 1 mm thick as a base, even if the sheets are not perfectly rectangular they can still be used.",
      "Since this is an easy casual lasagna, don't worry about making it perfectly.",
      "Keep layering in the ingredients, from the bechamel sauce to the meat sauce.",
      "Top with the pizza cheese.",
      "Melting-type sliced cheese may also work.",
      "Add as much cheese as you like.",
      "When I added the last layer of meat sauce, my casserole was filled to the brim!",
      "If you add a bit less, leaving space at the top of your casserole dish, the cheese won't bubble over when it's baked.",
      "Bake in an oven preheated to 250 C for around 15 minutes, keeping an eye on it until the surface is crispy and browned.",
      "When it has browned evenly on the surface, it's done.",
      "Sprinkle with dried parsley to taste.",
      "Here is a view from the side...",
      "The cut side is also well defined.",
      "If you want to make more dough, use 1 egg per 100 g of flour, 1/4 teaspoon of salt and 1 teaspoon of oil.",
      "The first time you make this, you might get slightly confused about some of the steps...so try it out when you have some time to spare.",
      "It's surprisingly easy to make.",
      "If your noodle sheets do not have an even thickness and the thicker parts float up to the surface as you're cooking them, open a few holes in the dough with chopsticks, and it will cook faster.",
      "The dough is so firm and chewy that you shouldn't need any flour for dusting, but if it looks like it will stick as you work it, use a little flour."
