Beat the butter and sugar in a large bowl with a mixer on medium-high speed until smooth, about 3 minutes. Beat in the eggs, one at a time, then beat in the vanilla and orange zest until light and fluffy, about 2 more minutes. Reduce the speed to low and gradually beat in the flour mixture, alternating with the sour cream, until a sticky dough forms, about 2 minutes. Cover the dough with plastic wrap; refrigerate at least 3 hours or overnight.",
      "Coat a baking sheet with cooking spray. Heat 2 inches of vegetable oil in a large pot over medium-high heat until a deep-fry thermometer registers 340 degrees F. Meanwhile, roll out the dough until 1/2 inch thick on a floured surface. (The dough will be sticky.) Cut out rounds using a 1-inch-round cookie cutter, dipping the cutter in flour each time. Place the rounds on the prepared baking sheet.",
      "Set a rack on another baking sheet. Working in batches, carefully fry the doughnut holes until puffed and browned, 30 seconds per side. Transfer to the rack using a slotted spoon or wire strainer.",
      "Make the glaze: Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Put the chocolate in a small heatproof bowl. Bring the heavy cream to a boil in a small saucepan and immediately pour over the chocolate; cover and let stand 5 minutes. Whisk until the chocolate is melted and smooth, then whisk in the corn syrup and vanilla. Set aside until cooled and thickened, about 5 minutes. Dip the doughnut holes in the glaze, transfer to the prepared baking sheet and sprinkle with nonpareils. Let sit at least 1 hour before serving."

      "Start with peeling your potatoes and cutting them into similar size parts and wash them from exes starch. In a large pot filled up with cold water add some butter, salt, white pepper and put on high heat. Boil for about 25 minutes until the potatoes are soft all the way to the centre.",
      "Cut your carrots and onion into small pieces and in a large pan brown them on medium heat with a bit of oil (season with little salt and dried herbs - thyme, marjoram). After about 3-4 minutes you can add your leftover Bolognese and stir all well together. If it needs some extra taste you can add some Worcester sauce and your peas. Be gentle not to mash them up. Add some water for extra sauce. \nPut your Bolognese base in a baking dish and fill it up 1/2 - 2/3 up.",
      "When your masked potatoes are ready drain them from the water and add warm milk and extra butter and grated nutmeg (if you like the taste) and mash the potatoes with you potato masher. Taste and add to seasoning for your perfect taste. I like them with quite a bit of salt, white pepper and milk. \nOptional: You can add some cheese into your mashed potatoes if you feel like. \n-\tI do not tend to do that. Since I put it mostly only on the top so a nice crust creates. \n\nSet your oven for 190 Celsius.",
      "Now add your potato mash on top of your Bolognese base and create a nice thick topping (I like it to be about 1/2 and 1/2 with meat base and potatoes). When you are done sprinkle with your favourite cheese. In my case that is almost always grated parmesan cheese. Now with a fork or a knife you can create some cuts and lined on the top of your mash.",
      "Put your pie in the oven in the lower half so the top does not burn and leave it in for about 40 minutes turning it around if you have an un-even oven as me so the \nBrowning is evenly spread. \n\nNow your cottage's pie is ready to eat. Serve with some salad (for adults) or ketchup (for children). \n\nEnjoy"

      "\tTo begin making the Jalebi Recipe, we will first begin the preparation by mixing the Maida, corn flour, baking soda, ghee and turmeric powder in a medium bowl. Combine all the dry ingredients well, until well combined.",
      "\tAdd yogurt to the dry ingredients and blend them all together to make a thick batter by adding very little water. The consistency of the batter should be thick and not watery, similar to the butter cream batter. You should be able to make a shape when piped in a piping bag.",
      "\tWhen done, cover the Jalebi batter and place it in a warm place for 24 hours or overnight, till it is fermented (the batter will rise on fermentation). Once the batter is fermented stir the batter in a cut and fold motion to combine it once again.",
      "\tDon't over stir you want the air pockets in the batter to remain. This will help in the Jalebi being crisp and also in turn help it absorb the sugar syrup.",
      "\tTo make the sugar syrup, boil the sugar with water and saffron powder in a small bowl on medium heat until the sugar dissolves. When the sugar becomes thick and stringy of one string consistency. Turn off the heat and keep aside.",
      "\tNow to make the Jalebi's, preheat the oil for deep frying. Once the oil is hot enough, you will know this, when you add a drop of batter in, and it will come rising to the top almost immediately.",
      "\tOnce you have filled the piping bag, pipe spirals of the batter onto the medium hot oil, until you get at least 3 concentric circles. Fry the Jalebi on medium heat until golden brown in colour and crisp. Once the Jalebi is crisp and browned, drain the excess oil out, and immediately dip the Jalebi's into the hot sugar syrup.",
      "\tPiping the Jalebi's into the medium hot oil takes a little experience, the more you pipe the more practice you will get and the better you get at it.",
      "\tThe Jalebi's should rest in the sugar syrup for at least a minute, after which they can be drained out of the excess syrup and then served.",
      "\tEnjoy these crisp, sweet Homemade Jalebi !!!!!",
      "Note:\n\tEnsure the batter is thick and firm, or else they won't retain the shape of the Jalebi's. The oil for frying should be medium hot. If it is too hot, the Jalebi's will end up burnt.\n\tAlso make sure you keep the heat on low when you pipe the Jalebi's into the oil, this will ensure you can see the circles you are piping and also the Jalebi's will rise up slowly."
