Roll out the bottom crust into a 12\" circle between sheets of plastic wrap or on a lightly floured surface. Fit it into a 9\" pie pan. Mound filling into crust. (If you have too much filling, save the extra to serve over toast.) Roll the top crust into a 10\" circle. Fit over the filling; bring edges of bottom crust up and over the edges of the top crust. Crimp together, then trim the edges flush with the pie pan. Use a pastry brush to brush top of crust with egg wash or cream. Slash the top crust to let steam escape.",

      "Next, toss the meat in the olive oil with the spices and herbs. Set everything into a roasting tray in a single-layer. And add the chicken stock until it is about half-way up the side of the pork.",
      "Cook the pork for 30minutes at 500degrees, then reduce the temperature to 275degrees for the final 2 hours to 2 hours and 15 minutes. It is ready when the pork pulls apart easily. Remove from oven.",
      "Allow the pork to cool in the cooking liquid until it isn't too hot to be shredded easily by hand. Strain the liquid from the pork and reserve the liquid--add a splash of cider vinegar to taste, which will help to cut through the richness and bolster the southern take on rillette.",
      "Pick out the peppercorns, bay leaves and garlic cloves. You can mash one of the garlic cloves into the pork if you want a nice garlic undertone.",
      "Shred the pork a moderate amount, so that you have a nice blend of hunks and strings. Here is where you can decide if you want to keep any of the ham hock. The meat will boost the meaty flavor, but it is not to everyone's taste.",
      "Next choose your preferred style. You can either set the rillette in a ball jar and pour enough of the reserved juice to cover and preserve the rillette, which will grow in flavor as it ages. Or you can roll the rillette in plastic wrap for a \"head cheese\" approach and a more pleasant presentation. If rolling into a log, drizzle enough of the reserved jus and rendered pork fat over the meat to moisten and bind.",
      "Place in fridge and allow to set for at least 4-hours, but preferably at least 3-days. It gives time for the jus to infuse. The jar method with a fat cap will keep nicely for up to 3-months, and the log should be used within a week or two.",
      "As for accompaniments, I like to go with traditional charcuterie accompaniments--a nice mustard, a few seasonings, a roasted garlic clove and some pickles. Serve with crusty bread and indulge. Dusting the rillette with smoked paprika or regular sweet- or hot- paprika is a nice accompaniment as well."

I know you want to stir it, but don't. Trust me. Keep an eye on it though and when it starts to turn golden around the edges you are allowed to stir (see photo for when you can start stirring). Turn the heat down and stir until you get a nice golden color-stop just short of how you want it as it will darken a bit more in the pan. Pour it into the loaf pan and sprinkle it with 1/4 teaspoon each of cinnamon, nutmeg, and allspice. Let it set up - it doesn't need to be hard but it needs to stiffen up some.",

Now, this is the extra special secret trick that's going to take this crust from \"good\" to \"I have to change my pants now, excuse me.\" Let the butter melt, and then keep cooking it until it starts to turn brown. If it smells kind of nutty, it's ready, and it'll make your crust taste nutty and awesome too.",
      "Crumble the gingersnap cookies into a food processor, which is WAY more painful than it sounds. Seriously, it's like grinding tiny bits of kitchen tile into your hands. Once they're all in there, pulse them in the processor a few times until they're nice and broken up, add the butter, and then pulse a few more times until it's all combined.",
      "Next, press it into a 9-inch pie pan using something flat and make sure it goes up the sides. You're gonna have some spill-over; that's okay. This is basically the crumbliest thing of all time. It's a good thing.",
      "Throw the crust in your refrigerator for 20 minutes, and preheat your oven to 325\u00b0 F. Once the crust is done chilling, bake it for 15 minutes, then set it on a cooling rack. Turn your oven up to 350 after you're done with the crust.",
      "Now for the actual pie part, which you can do while the crust is chilling/baking. If you read ahead, congratulations! You can now use this tip. If you didn't, you just spent a bunch of time staring at crust. How's that feel?",
      "The pie part's simple: Dump everything that isn't pumpkin or cream (that's brown sugar, eggs, salt, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, and cloves) into a bowl. Whisk it. Then add the pumpkin and the cream. Whisk it. You now have pumpkin pie filling.",
      "Combine the brown sugar, salt, and cinnamon for the topping in another small bowl.",
      "Then pour the filling into the crust, cover the crust with tin foil, and pop it in the oven for 30 minutes.",
      "After half an hour, take the pie out (it will still be quite liquid-y), cover it with your topping ingredients, and bake it for another 25 minutes at 325\u00b0 F.",
      "While that's going on, make your whipped cream. This one's easy too: put all the whipped cream ingredients in a stand mixer, whisk at medium high until peaks form.",
      "Take your pie out, put it on a cooling rack until it's at room temperature, and stick it in the refrigerator overnight. Then put it on a plate with some whipped cream and shove it in your face."

You can tell if it is completely dissolved by dipping a thumb and forefinger into the tea and rubbing them together; if you can't feel any \"sandiness,\" all is well. Pour a half ounce (which amounted to about 1/3\" in the bottom of my glasses) into the bottom of each of 4 glasses. Refrigerate the glasses. Set aside the remainder of the gelee at room temperature while you prepare the panna cotta.",

Remove from heat and allow the zests to steep for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, bloom the packet of gelatine in one ounce of cold water. Use tongs to lift the zests from the cream and discard them. Add the gelatine and stir until it has melted. Set the pan in a bowl of cold water (NOT ice water), and stir the panna cotta continuously with a rubber spatula for about 15-20 minutes. It should reach about body temperature and feel neutral - neither cold nor warm - when tested with a finger. Check to see that the gelee has set. Divide the panna cotta equally among the glasses, wiping away any drips on the inside or outside of the glasses. Return them to the refrigerator.",

Transfer to a pie plate, crimp the edges as you'd like, then freeze for an additional 30 minutes, until firm and cold to the touch.

Remove the parchment paper holding the pie weights, and continue to bake until the crust is evenly browned and looks crisp (above, right), about 5 to 10 minutes. If your pie is browning too quickly, you can reduce the heat to 375\u00b0 and tent the pie with foil. Let cool completely before filling with the custard."

Lower the oven temperature to 300\u00b0F. Let the cakes sit until cool enough to handle, and then remove each from its pan.

Carefully separate the cut pieces and transfer them to two large parchment-lined baking sheets, cut side down, so the pieces lie flat on the baking sheets. Place the baking sheets in the oven and bake for another 30 to 35 minutes, until each piece is firm to the touch. Remove and transfer to cooling racks.",

In the microwave or on the stove, heat the heavy whipping cream and coffee liqueur together until very warm, then remove from the heat. Add the bittersweet chocolate, and let sit for a minute to melt. Whisk the chocolate into the cream mixture until mixture is silky and smooth. Transfer the chocolate mixture to a wide-bottomed shallow bowl. When the bizcocho has sat long enough, dip each piece, on one side only, into the chocolate mixture to coat, covering with enough melted chocolate so the top is smooth, then place back on the cooling rack. Once you've finished, sprinkle the chocolate topping on each piece with a large pinch of the smoked sea salt. Let set until the chocolate cools and hardens slightly. Serve or store as desired."

Add the melted butter and stir just until combined. Gently pat out your mixture evenly into the bottom of the pan. Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes.",
      "To prepare the cheesecake, begin boiling some water in a kettle or saucepan for your water bath. Beat cream cheese in the bowl of a stand mixer at medium speed (I use 4 on my Kitchen Aid Mixer) for 2 minutes to remove all clumps. Do not overbeat, but scrape the sides of the bowl as needed. If many clumps remain, ensure that your cream cheese has softened to room temp. Add the sugar and beat on medium for an additional 1 minute. Add eggs, one at a time, and beat to combine an additional 1 minute. Scrape the sides of the bowl and then add the heavy cream, and vanilla. Beat to combine. Strain the cheesecake batter through a mesh strainer (if desired) into a reserved bowl. Pour the batter on top of the crust. Gently rap the pan on the counter to help any air bubbles escape. Place your springform pan into a slightly larger baking dish/pan and fill the larger pan with the boiling water you prepared for the water bath until the water reaches about halfway up the sides of the springform pan. Carefully place both pans in the preheated oven and bake for 1 hour. After an hour of baking, the edges and top of the cheesecake should be set but still slightly jiggle in the center. Turn the oven off and allow the cheesecake to bake for an additional 30 minutes in the oven. Prop the door of the oven open slightly with a wooden spoon and continue to cool the cheesecake for another 30 minutes in the cooling oven. Discard the water bath, remove the foil and then place the cheesecake in the fridge to chill for several hours or overnight. The cheesecake can be stored in the fridge for several days. Serve with butterscotch sauce or homemade caramel."

      "Find a container with a lid that can hold hot liquid and will fit both the tea and the rice. A pint-size ball jar works well. Put your tea bags, or loose tea in a tea strainer, in the container and add the boiling water. Steep the tea for a few minutes to make a nice, strong brew. I used Tea Forte's loose Bombay Chai, a heaping tablespoon, and let it steep for at least 10 minutes. It's alright if the water cools down.",
      "Take out the tea and add the rice. Close the container and leave it on the counter for at least a few hours, or overnight. For brown rice, I left it for about 9 hours and it worked; I left the long-grain white rice for about 5 1/2 hours and that was enough, although longer would have been fine as well.",
      "Pour the rice and tea into a blender jar and blend until the rice is finely ground (I used an immersion blender). Strain the mixture: I poured it all into a dampened bandana, twisted up the corners, and slowly squeezed it to get out as much liquid as possible. A fine mesh sieve might do if you don't mind some graininess. Otherwise, a few layers of cheesecloth should do the trick. Add the cold water (or milk for a bit more creaminess, although I like it with the water) and molasses and stir. Serve over ice, or chill in the fridge and serve cold if you'd rather not dilute it further. It will separate a bit as the rice/starch settles, but a quick stir will remix it nicely.",

And another tablespoon of olive oil to the pan, and simmer the garlic; this should only take 45 seconds-1 minute. Wait until the garlic is fragrant, but not browned. Remove the garlic to the same bowl as the onions. Finally, add the remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil to the pan, along with 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes, and a splash of water. Cook the broccolini until it is tender, but still bright, about 3-5 minutes. Remove the broccolini to a separate bowl.",

De-vein the shrimp, and then rinse under cold water and pat them dry. Rinse the monkfish gently under cold water, and pat dry. Season the monkfish all over with salt and pepper, and then slice into roughly 1-inch pieces. (You want the shrimp and monkfish to cook at the same rate.)",

Put the lid on, and allow the fish to cook for 12-14 minutes, or until the shrimp and fish are just cooked through. (Keep in mind that the fish and shrimp will continue cooking, even after you turn off the heat.) Stir the broccolini into the pot. Adjust the salt, to taste. Serve the stew in warm bowls, topped with the chopped parsley, and alongside a good crusty baguette for sopping up all the tomato sauce."

Add the cup of cream and simmer until cream has bubbled up and started to thicken, about 5 minutes. Add lemon juice, salt and pepper to taste and set aside.",

Heat 4 tablespoons of butter in a large saute pan. When the butter starts to sizzle, add half the mushrooms, sprinkle with salt, and cook over medium heat for about 5 minutes, until the mushrooms are tender and they release some of their juices. If they become too dry, add a little more butter. Toss occasionally to make sure the mushrooms cook evenly. Repeat with the remaining mushrooms and set all the mushrooms aside.

Gradually whisk in the light cream; cook, stirring constantly, until smooth and thickened. Stir in the Parmesan cheese and season with the nutmeg, salt and pepper. In a small bowl, gradually stir 1/2 cup of the sauce into the beaten eggs so as to warm the eggs slowly and prevent them from scrambling, then stir the egg mixture into the remaining sauce.

If you are concerned about leaving the bowl out of the fridge overnight, either put it in the fridge or leave it out of the fridge and, before proceeding, place contents in a heavy-bottomed pan, bring to brief boil, let simmer 5 minutes at lower temp, and let cool.

      "To make the cake: Put the yeast in a small bowl and pour over the warm milk. Allow the yeast to stand for a couple of minutes, until it's fully dissolved; it might or might not bubble.",
      "Put the flour and sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Mix at low speed to blend the dry ingredients, then scrape in the yeast mixture and beat just to distribute it; you'll have a shaggy mix. Keep the mixer spinning on low and add the eggs in a slow stream, then beat in the salt, rum or kirsch, if you're using it, and vanilla. Increase the mixer speed to medium and beat, scraping down the bowl occasionally, for 5 to 8 minutes. The dough will start off rough and pockmarked, then it will pull into strands as the mixer spins and, finally, it will be smooth and form a ball.",
      "Check the butter-you want it to be soft but not oily. If it's not soft, smear it across a work surface with the heel of your hand. Up the mixer speed to medium-high and toss in the pieces of butter a couple at a time. Keep mixing after the last bit of butter goes in until you've got a dough that forms a ball around the paddle, another 8 to 10 minutes.",
      "Turn the dough out into a large bowl, then cup your fingers under the dough, lifting it and letting it slap down into the bowl again as you work your way around the bowl; when you've come full circle, you should have a nice, smooth, somewhat flattened ball of dough. Cover the bowl tightly with plastic film and put it in a warm place (70\u00b0 to 75\u00b0 F) until it rises to approximately double its original volume, 2 to 3 hours.",
      "When the dough has risen, deflate it, using that same lift-and-drop method, cover the bowl tightly again and put it in the freezer for 30 minutes to arrest the dough's development. Then transfer it to the refrigerator and chill for another 2 hours. (The dough can be refrigerated for up to 2 days.)",
      "About an hour before you're ready to bake, line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat. Remove the bowl from the refrigerator and turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface. Gently pat the dough down, lightly flour the top and roll it into a 10-inch circle. Don't worry about it being exactly 10 inches; concentrate on getting it round and almost that diameter, or smaller. Slide the dough onto the baking sheet, cover with a piece of plastic film -- don't press down on it -- and let the dough rest in a warm place for 1 hour.",
      "Meanwhile, make the filling: Bring the milk to a boil in a medium saucepan.",
      "Whisk the yolks, sugar, cornstarch and salt together in a medium bowl. Whisking constantly, drizzle in one quarter of the hot milk. When the yolks are warm, add the rest of the milk in a steadier stream. Pour the mixture into the pan, return the pan to medium heat and, whisking vigorously, bring back to a boil. Keep at a boil, still whisking, for 1 to 2 minutes, making sure to get your whisk into the corners of the pan. Scrape the pastry cream into a bowl, add the vanilla and allow it to sit for 10 minutes at room temperature.",
      "Add the bits of butter to the pastry cream a couple pieces at a time, whisking to incorporate. Press a piece of plastic film against the surface of the cream and chill for at least 2 hours, or, to speed up the chilling, put the bowl in a larger bowl filled with ice cubes and cold water and whisk until cold, then refrigerate until ready to fill the cake. (You can make the pastry cream up to 3 days ahead and keep it well covered in the refrigerator.)",
      "To bake the cake: About 20 minutes before you're ready to bake, center a rack in the oven and preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Lightly beat the egg and add a splash of cold water to it. Brush the top of the dough with the egg wash and sprinkle over the pearl or crushed sugar, patting it down lightly so that it sticks. Be generous with the sugar -- you want to pretty much cover the top.",
      "Slide the baking sheet into the oven and immediately turn the oven temperature down to 350\u00b0 F. Bake the cake for 20 to 25 minutes, rotating the sheet after 10 minutes, or until it is golden brown on both the top and bottom. Transfer the cake to a cooling rack and let it come to room temperature.",
      "When you're ready to fill the cake, whip the heavy cream until it holds firm peaks.",
      "Remove the pastry cream from the refrigerator and whisk to loosen it. Stir a little of the whipped cream into the pastry cream, then fold in the rest of the whipped cream with a flexible spatula.",
      "To finish the cake: Using a long serrated knife and a very gentle sawing motion, cut the cake horizontally in half(ish) -- it's good to have the bottom layer a little thicker than the top. Put the bottom layer on a cake plate. Spread the filling over it, leaving a slim border bare, and replace the top of the cake, jiggling it slightly to settle it into the cream. Chill the cake for at least 1 hour, or for up to 8 hours. The filling needs to set in the refrigerator and the cake should be served cold.",
      "Serving: In Saint-Tropez, the cake is sometimes a dessert, sometimes a pick-me-up and, if it's bought as a miniature from a patisserie in town, sometimes a snack. Since it comes from a town once known for its wild and crazy ways, it's not surprising that there are no real rules.",
      "Storing: You can make the pastry cream up to 3 days ahead and refrigerate it, and you can keep the brioche dough in the refrigerator for 1 day before you bake it. Once cut and filled, the cake can be kept in the refrigerator, away from foods with strong odors, for about 8 hours, or you can wrap it airtight and freeze it for up to 2 months. Defrost, still wrapped, in the refrigerator overnight."

Roast until the carrots and chickpeas are golden and the carrots are fork-tender, stirring 4 to 5 times to ensure even roasting and to avoid the vinaigrette burning in open areas of the pan (but don't be too concerned--it's why you're using parchment!).

If the carrots are browning too quickly but aren't tender, lower the oven to 375 degrees F and continue roasting until tender.",

      "For the dressing: Combine the creme fraiche, brine, and Dijon in a small bowl. Whisk to combine. Add the olive oil and a good pinch of sea salt to the bowl and whisk well. Taste and add more salt if needed. It will taste quite bright but will be toned down once it is mixed with the chicken.",

(I prefer about 1 part sweetened brine to 4 parts water but it's quite puckering.) The brine, spiced with fennel, cinnamon, and cardamom, makes for a refreshing and very nutritious drink that's far less expensive than the bottled varieties."

      "* I buy IQF (individually quick-frozen chicken tenderloins and stash them in my freezer. Because they are IQF, I can pull out as many or as few as I choose.\r\n\r\n** Lemongrass paste may be one of the great inventions of the 21st century for those of us who live in lemongrass-challenged portions of the U.S., or of the world for that matter. Look for it in the produce section of your grocery store.",
      "If, like mine, your tenders are frozen, take out 2 per person and seal them in a ziplock bag. The safest, and interestingly also the quickest, way to thaw them is in cold water. Cold water behaves with frozen foods exactly the way it does toward the human body in cold water. It conducts both heat and cold extremely well, so it wicks cold away from frozen foods allowing them to thaw faster than they would at room temperature alone. So set your zip lock bag in a large bowl of cold water. Turn them over every 10 minutes or so. Within about 30 minutes, they'll be thawed and ready for their quick marinade. First, though, lay a couple of thicknesses of paper towel on a plate. Spread the tenders out on it, and press a couple of paper towels down on top of them as well. Just before they are IQFd, they are sprayed with a thin sheen of water which freezes almost instantly and helps maintain a barrier between all the tenders once bagged. That is the water you are blotting away.",
      "Preheat your oven to 250 degrees.",
      "Light a medium-sized charcoal fire or a propane grill. Pour the corn oil onto the same plate on which you dried the tenders and turn them over in it, coating both sides. Salt and pepper them, then squeeze the lime juice over them. Allow to sit at room temperature while the fire burns down/heats up. If you're smart, you'll pull more than two or four tenders from the freezer because, while you'll only use two or so per sandwich, deeply flavored chicken is such a treasure to have in the freezer,. So as long as you're building a fire, you may as well make good use of it. Besides, I would hardly expect you to build a fire just to grill one or two pieces of chicken.",
      "Whisk together all the dressing ingredients and set it aside so they can blend. Before mixing with the cabbage, taste it and adjust any seasonings as necessary.",
      "Thinly shred the cabbage - this is an excellent job for a mandoline. Slice the\r\nscallion greens 1/4? thick, and chop a generous handful of cilantro. Toss them all together in a mixing bowl.",
      "When the fire is ready, spread the coals out into a single layer. Lay the chicken tenders on the grill. If you try to cook the chicken all the way through on the grill, you run the risk that it will be dry and tough. So basically get some good grill-marks and smoky flavor to both sides, about 4 to 5 minutes per side with the lid open, then remove them to a clean plate and set them in the oven to finish cooking gently. Mine were at 145 degrees when they went into the oven; within 10 minutes (I set a timer to check them at 5-minute intervals), they read 165 degrees at the center. Remove them from the oven and let sit at room temperature to cool and rest for about 5 minutes. Turn off the oven.",
      "Set the tortilla shell in the oven so that the residual heat can firm it up a bit. If you try to make this or any wrap sandwich with a cold tortilla, chances are very good that it will tear. Let it warm while you prepare the filling.",
      "Thinly slice two or three of the chicken tenders and add them to the bowl containing the cabbage mixture. Add 4 ounces of the dressing, and use tongs to toss all the ingredients together. Thinly slice 1/4 of an avocado, as well as some curls of red onion, as many as you wish, and set them both aside.",
      "Remove the tortilla from the oven. Distribute about a scant cup of the filling along its center. Don't be greedy; resist the urge to over-fill. Remember, you can always make another. The juice of a blushing, perfect peach may be exquisite as it runs down your chin and arms, but a sandwich doesn't carry quite the same charm. Place the avocado and onion slice along the length of the filling.",
      "To roll it up, first fold in the ends. Next, fold the near edge away from you over the filling, and gently pressing in on the ends with the heels of your hands and gripping the middle of the tortilla and filling, roll it all to the opposite side. Press gently to set the filling within the tortilla, and let it sit for a couple of minutes to settle itself.",
      "Then slice it in half on the diagonal across the middle. Transfer to a plate."

If you are using fresh mandarin oranges you will have to peel and segment them, (this means to remove the thin membrane around the oranges). Put the compote into a container in the freezer to cool, once it has reached room temperature mix in the mandarin oranges. \r\nFinally whip the cream to a soft peak, I use liquid honey to sweeten the cream to provide structure and stop it from collapsing.\r\n\r\nNow to bring the dessert together place a line of the compote across the plate and place the pie across\r\nit diagonally, top the pie with the spiced whip cream, cranberry mandarin compote, and dried ginger."

Within 10-15 seconds, it should go from brittle to pliable - like a strong, wet paper towel. Make sure the edges are softened, so that your filled roll will stick to itself rather than pull apart. Lay the softened paper on your lined baking pan. Spread 1 1/2 Tablespoons of your filling about one inch in from the side facing you (see photo). Top filling with a mint leaf and then carefully fold up edge over filling. Fold each side over towards the center and confidently but delicately, tightly roll the rest of the roll until you reach the end. Place roll seam side down on parchment. Repeat with the remaining rice paper pieces and filling, changing water (rice papers are easier to soften in warmer water) at least once, until finished. Make sure rolls are not touching, so they don't stick together. Cover rolls with a damp paper towel. *NOTE: If your rice paper has a hole or rip in it, make sure you orient your square so the hole is covered by a layer of the rice paper.

Add up to three rolls, one at a time, with long chopsticks (or other suitable utensil) and fry until firm and golden, about two minutes, flipping halfway through. As you remove each spring roll, tap on the edge of pan to remove excess oil. Drain on paper towels on the baking sheet. Repeat until done.",

      "First make the Tzatziki by combining the yougart, cucumber, dill, lemon juice, and salt & pepper in a bowl and mixing. Once mixed, cover and put in fridge until needed. This makes a thick tzatziki where you really see the ingredients. Just the way I like it.",
      "Take the ground lamb (I buy leg of lab and cube it then run it through the food processor quickly so that it still has some chunks to it) and combine in a bowl with the oregano, thyme, salt and pepper. Make four equal-sized patties. Cut these patties into two and put a mound of feta cheese on the bottom patty and place the top patty over and reconnect by pinching around the edges. This will seal in the cheese which will cook into the patty.",
      "Cook the patties and the sliced onions on the grill (or a grill pan for those stuck inside). Cook onions until they have great grill marks and begin to soften. Cook lamb patties to desired doneness but I would recommend not going past medium or you'll lose some of the lamb flavor. As patties finish remove to a cooler part of the grill and add the kefalotiri cheese to melt. Once melted let the lamb patties rest for a few minutes.",
      "Quickly add the buns to the grill to toast up a bit. Just a few seconds is all thats needed on a hot grill.",
      "Once the lamb has rested compose the burgers by adding the lamb to the bun and topping with the grilled onions, fresh greens, tomato and a dollop of the tzatziki.\r\nI like a cold beer if I'm having with fries or a cold moscolfiliero if I'm eating with salad."

Remove and discard any outer layers of the fennel that are bruised or feel too rubbery. Cut the fennel bulb in half, through the core of the fennel, cutting parallel to the bulb's wider dimension. Cut each half into thirds, making sure that each piece includes some of the fennel's core (the core will hold the layers of the fennel together). Place the cut fennel on a rimmed baking sheet, and drizzle with enough olive oil to just coat the outsides. Season lightly with salt and bake for 45 minutes. Every fifteen minutes or so, flip and rotate the fennel pieces on the baking sheet.",
      "When the fennel has been cooking for 45 minutes, it's time to start cooking the pork chops. Leave the fennel in the oven cooking while you begin working on the pork chops. Season the pork chops with salt on both sides. Set a large skillet over high heat, and add just enough canola oil to cover the surface of the skillet. When the oil in the skillet just begins to smoke, add the pork chops. Let them cook, undisturbed, until the underside of each chop is nicely caramelized. You're aiming for a golden brown color.",

Next, use tongs to hold the chops on their side for a moment to try to brown any fat on the exterior of the chops. Remove the skillet from the heat and transfer the pork chops to the rimmed baking sheet in the oven with the fennel. Don't clean the skillet, you're about to use it to make garlic-lemon butter. Season the pork chops and the fennel with the ground fennel seeds and Espelette pepper. Remember to season both sides of the pork chops and fennel. You should season the pork more aggressively than you season the fennel. Cook the pork chops in the oven until the internal temperature of the pork chops is 145\u00b0. Start checking the temperature of the pork chops after about 5 minutes in the oven. Keep checking every 5 minutes until they are fully cooked.",
      "While the pork chops cook, remove any excess oil from the skillet. Add the butter and garlic to the skillet. Set the skillet over medium heat. Cook the garlic gently; you don't want it to burn. When the garlic just begins to start to brown, remove the skillet from the heat and add the lemon juice along with a pinch of salt. Use a wooden spoon to scrape up any caramelized bits from the bottom of the skillet. These caramelized bits will meld into the sauce and add flavor. Set the sauce aside.",
      "When the pork chops are fully cooked, let them rest for 3 minutes before serving. While the pork is resting, retrieve the fennel fronds that you reserved earlier, and pick a handful of the most tender fronds. Serve each pork chop along with some pieces of fennel, and spoon some sauce over the top of the pork and the fennel. Garnish with the fennel fronds. Enjoy."

      "I also coated my meatballs in cornstarch and fried them (3-5 minutes in a half inch of oil and then rolled them over for another 3 to 5 minutes) and then kept them overnight to use in my sauce the next day. This made about 110 meatballs, you totally could halve this recipe, this many meatballs was 12-14 servings.",
      "In a big (preferably cast iron) pot heat two tablespoons of olive oil and toss in the onion followed by the garlic cloves to release their aromatics, put everything else in the pot, bring it to a boil, reduce to a simmer, cook for two hours stirring occasionally. You will probably need to add more salt.",
      "If you want a heartier chunkier sauce you can really just use a wooden spoon to break up the tomatoes and the garlic, if you choose this method I would use cracked pepper instead of whole peppercorns, for a smooth sauce throw the whole cooked down mixture in the blender, make sure you dig out the bay leaves. I added the chopped herbs after pureeing to give my sauce some more color. If you're serving this with your meatballs add them in to heat the meatballs up again, serve with fettuccini or a big rigatoni and parmesan."

When cool, squeeze roasted garlic out of papery skin into a small bowl. Set aside (Can do a day in advance; cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate until ready to use).",

Flip with a spatula and cook for two minutes more, pressing down on mushroom slightly. Transfer to a small bowl to cool. Remove pan from heat.",
      "While mushrooms are cooking, stack radish rounds and evenly chop into small pieces. Repeat until you have 2/3 cups of chopped radish. Eat any remaining radish.",
      "Replace pan on hot burner, add radish pieces and quickly cook in remaining oil from mushrooms. Drizzle with 1/4 t sesame oil, and stir for 15 seconds. Transfer to a medium sized bowl to cool. Remove pan from heat and briefly turn off stove.",
      "Once mushrooms are cool, finely chop by thinly slicing each cap lengthwise and then crosswise.",
      "Add mushrooms to cooled radishes, followed by chives, roasted garlic, raw minced garlic, and lemon zest. Stir well to combine. Mixture should be slightly sticky from the roasted garlic.",
      "Fill gyoza wrappers by placing a little less than a Tablespoon of filling towards the bottom half of each circle. Moisten the edge of the circle by outlining with a pastry brush dipped in water (your finger works equally well). Fold down the top of the wrapper, covering the filling, and seal edge by making six pleats in the top half, gently pinching as you go. Repeat until you have used all the filling. I was able to make 14.",

Push them over so pleated top is facing up and cook until brown. Repeat with pleated side. Add 1/4 cup water to pan, cover, and turn down heat. Cook until water has evaporated and gyoza are ready, about three minutes. Transfer to a serving platter and tent with foil to keep warm. Repeat with remaining oil and gyoza. Drizzle finished gyoza with chili oil and just a little tamari (it is very rich and salty and too much will overpower all the other flavors). Sprinkle with black sesame if desired. Serve immediately and enjoy while hot.",
      "To make your own chili oil (adapted from description on Penzey's website): Heat 2 T canola oil in a small skillet until shimmering. Add 10 dried chiles, with stems removed (I used Chili de Arbol chiles). Cook, stirring until chilies are dark but not burned, 3-4 minutes. Remove pan from heat. Add 1/4 cup canola oil, plus a teaspoon or two of sesame oil. Allow oil to cool completely. Strain solids and seeds out of oil. Transfer to a clean glass jar, store in refrigerator. Chili oil will keep for about a month."

Cookies will keep for 2 days in an airtight container at room temperature, for a week in the refrigerator or up to a month in the freezer (be sure to defrost them in the container or wrapping to prevent condensation from forming on the cookies as they thaw)."

      "I will start out with a few tips that I know from my grandmother that are good to know when doing this. First, it is best to color the eggs while they are still warm. The water in which the egg is dipped to be colored should also be quite warm and a tablespoon of vinegar is added to each container holding a color. Both of these help to achieve brighter and more saturated colors ( but needless to say the quality of the food coloring is important). When doing this, it usually requires that you boil between 15-20 eggs. That is to ensure that there is an egg for everyone who stops by as well as to compensate for some that might crack while boiling. Follow the usual procedure for boilng them ( bring them to room temperature, cover with cold water, put on the stove...), but my grandmother also puts a kitchen towel on the bottom of the pot and folds it in between the eggs in the water. When you go to remove the eggs from the water, do so one by one in between the folds.",
      "You will also need to hunt down a lady's stocking or a pantyhose for this, the thinner the better. Cut a straight tube from it between 5-7 inches, depending on how stretchy it is, and tie a knot on one end. Prepare a few more like this and set them aside.",
      "Assuming your eggs are boiled at this point, dissolve the colors in very warm water to be ready for dipping. I used several sour cream containers. Add the vinegar to the water along with the colors. Holding an egg in a dish towel, draw whatever design you like on it with a thin pencil. Redraw over the pencil line with the crayon. It is good if the crayon melts some while doing this. That will ensure it will fill the egg pores and won't allow the coloring to work there. If too much seems to remain on the egg surface, you can carefully scrape it off with the blade of a small knife. I prefer a neutral crayon, but you can use a color one if you like.",
      "Place the egg in the prepared tied stocking, and tie a knot at the other end. Make the egg as tight inside as you can without breaking it, to ensure that it won't move around. This is easier to do if someone holds the knot at the bottom for you.",
      "The next important thing is to think about the order in which you choose what colors to dip in. The variation is achieved by the overlapping of several colors. I first dipped the egg in the yellow about 3/4 of the way and let it sit for about 5 min. Then took it out and placed it in a slot in the empty egg carton to sit for another 5 min. Then carefully untied the top knot ( or just cut it off ), and take the egg out and let the yellow dry out. Place the dried egg in a clean sock and tie again as above. Dip the egg about 1/2 of the way into the blue color, but with the other side of the egg going in first. Hold it in another 5 min, let sit outside another 5 min, take it out of the sock and leave it in a clean slot on the carton to dry. For the last color (red) I just held the egg in the liquid with my hand as it only needed to be dipped abou 1/3 of the way.Then let it dry in the egg carton, placing it with the wet part downward, or your color will run down the side. At the top where the yellow didn't go, the egg was a turquoise blue. Below it where the blue and the yellow overlapped, it turned light green. Below it a band of yellow remained. And at the bottow the red and yellow combined to make an orange circle. This particular egg happened to have a sort of a defect on its shell ( calcium concentration I think) and I used it as a center to my flower design. After it was all done and dried, we found some children's stickers and I used the outside of a butterfly sticker and placed it there. I used a brown egg for this. If you have white ones, I assume there will be even more contrast between the colors."

I used my food processor, but I didn't always have one and have had great results making this crust by hand. Add in the chopped pieces of cold butter and cold shortening . Blend together with your hands or pulse with your processor until you have coarse crumbs (it doesn't have to be perfect). You can use a pastry cutter, too, but I find that a clean pair of hands work best.",
      "Mix together the water and vinegar in a small bowl. When ready, slowly drizzle it over the dough, a tablespoon or so at a time, gently stirring the mixture with a fork or pulsing with your processor, until fully incorporated (you may not use all of the water). It might seem a bit too wet at this point, but it will dry up while it sits in the fridge. Form the dough gently into 2 loose balls, wrap tightly in plastic wrap, and chill in the fridge for a minimum of 3 hours or as long as overnight (as always, overnight is best). Make your filling when you are almost ready to use your dough.",
      "When you're ready to bake, liberally butter your muffin tins. This recipe makes about 30-36 tarts, so plan accordingly. Preheat your oven to 400 degrees F. Lightly flour a work surface, and take one of your balls of dough and roll it out to about 1/4-inch thick. Cut out circles that are a bit larger than the circumference of your tins, so that there is enough crust to hold in the filling, and gently place each circle in the tins, re-rolling your dough as you go. Drop 3-4 raisins in the bottom of each tart before adding in the filling.",
      "Whisk together your dark brown sugar, corn syrup, melted butter, and vanilla. Drop 2-3 teaspoons of filling (it will bubble, so don't overfill or you will have a hell of a time getting the tarts out of the pan) in each tart, then sprinkle with a touch of sea salt. Bake for 12-15 minutes, until lightly golden and mostly set. Allow to cool completely before removing the tarts from the pan. I like to use a dull paring knife to cut around any hardened caramel and then popping each tart out. These will keep well at room temperature for up to 3 days, or frozen for up to 3 months."

Alternatively, the peels and cooking water can be transferred to a blender instead. This potato peel water mixture needs to be in the 95\u00b0 to 115\u00b0 F range for happy yeast, so I blend when the mixture is still warm, then add cold water, check the temperature, and if it's still too warm, wait for it too cool off. If you don't have a thermometer, fear not, just check the temperature by putting a few drops on the inside of your wrist, it should feel warm, but not hot.",

Pour 2 tablespoons of the olive oil in the bottom of a large container with a lid (or use the same bowl that you used to mix!), transfer the dough to the container, turn to coat in oil, then cover and refrigerate for 24 hours. (Okay, or 18 hours if that works better for your schedule. Okay, okay, *at least* 12 hours, but that's the minimum, and really, 24 hours is best. Patience is a virtue and all that.)",
      "Grease two 8- or 9-inch pie plates (or something similar) with 1 teaspoon butter each, then pour a tablespoon of oil into the center of each pan. Deflate the dough and separate it into two equal pieces (Alexandra Stafford does this with two forks and it works really well). Place one piece into each of the prepared pans. Roll the dough balls in the oil to coat them all over, and let the dough balls rest for 2 to 4 hours (depending on the temperature of your kitchen), until they have poofed up and filled the pans.",
      "Once the dough balls look like they've had enough rise time (or close to it), heat your oven to 425\u00b0 F. Once your oven is at temp, drizzle the remaining olive oil on them (1 tablespoon on each), stipple the dough with your fingertips to create deep dimples, sprinkle with flaky salt, and then put them directly into the oven. Bake for 25 minutes, or until golden brown all over.",

Roast the potatoes in the oven for about 12 minutes, or until they begin to soften. In the meantime, toss the broccoli florets with another glug of olive oil. When the sweet potatoes are softened, stir them around a bit to make sure they cook evenly, and then add the broccoli to the baking sheet. Roast the broccoli and potatoes together for another 10-15 minutes, until the potatoes have begun to brown a bit. While that's happening, massage your chopped kale by squeezing it in your hands until its voluminousness is under control. When the broccoli and potatoes are ready, pile the kale on top. It'll be a thick layer of greens, and it may seem ridiculous, but so long as you're careful in sliding the pan in and out of the oven it'll be fine. If you're afraid to put all the kale on at once, put as much as you can, and save the rest for a second round.",
      "Let the kale roast along with the broccoli and potatoes (buried beneath the greenery) for about 4 minutes. It should have shrunk down significantly by this time, although it'll still be a lot of biomass. Stir it around as best you can, paying special attention to rotating stuff from the middle to the edges (the edges dry out more, while the middle, if left to its own devices, can be a bit soggy). If you didn't add all the kale at the beginning, throw the rest on now. Let it all cook for another 5 or 6 minutes, then take the tray out of the oven. Sprinkle the lemon juice over the whole thing, and add salt and pepper to taste. Toss it all to make sure the seasoning gets everywhere-in particular, you'll want to make sure that the broccoli and potatoes come up from the bottom and get their fair share of the lemon and salt. Serve warm right off the tray, or let it cool for at least 10 minutes on the the tray before packing it up for leftovers."

Toss with tongs or with your hands so that everything carries a coat of syrup. Arrange everything on a baking sheet lined with parchment.

Remove from oven and allow to cool slightly (stick the baking sheet in the fridge for a couple of minutes if you need to). Reduce oven heat to 350 degrees.",

      "Make the pasta: \r\nMeasure flour into a medium-sized bowl. Make a well in the middle and crack the eggs into it. Using a fork, stir the egg and flour mixture together until if forms a loose, shaggy mixture. Turn the contents of the bowl onto a clean countertop and begin kneading the dough. Continue to knead the dough - feel free to use a little force and be aggressive here! It's a great opportunity to relieve a little stress. Knead the dough until it is a smooth, elastic mass, about 8 minutes. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and allow to rest at room temperature for at least 20 minutes. Don't be tempted to skip this step - it makes all the difference for a soft, tender noodle.",
      "Heat oven to 400\u00b0F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Combine the ground beef, egg, oatmeal and all of the spices in a medium bowl. Using clean hands, mix all of the ingredients together so they are well combined. Measure out teaspoon-sized quantities of the meatball mixture onto a parchment covered baking sheet and bake for 10 minutes or until meatballs are browned through. Remove from oven and allow meatballs to cool completely.",
      "Meatball Ravioli Assembly: \r\nBeat 1 egg in a small bowl. \r\n\r\nRoll the dough out with a pasta machine or a rolling pin as thinly as you can into 3\" strips. Brush the dough with the egg mixture. Place the meatballs on one half of the pasta strip, 1\" apart. Fold the other half of the noodle over the top of the meatballs, and press with your fingers between each meatball to push the air out. Press around each meatball to seal the pasta edges together. Cut to shape with a pastry cutter. Flour each piece lightly to preventing them sticking to each other. \r\n\r\nAlternatively - if you don't have the time or desire to make ravioli, you could, at this point, cut the pasta into noodles and proceed with the recipe.",
      "Just before serving the soup, bring the soup to a boil and add the meatball ravioli. Boil for 5 minutes (8 -10 if frozen). Remove from heat. Serve immediately in deep bowls with shredded parmesan cheese and diced scallions/green onions for garnish."

My preferred brand is San Marcos in red, white and blue can.\r\n------------------------------------------------\r\n**Working with avocadoes can be very messy, but my technique is very easy and neat. Halve an avocado lengthwise and remove the pit. Hold one avocado half in the palm of your hand and with a paring knife, slice parallel lines lengthwise, about 1/2 inch apart, cutting down through the flesh just until you touch the avocado skin. Now cut crosswise lines the same way. With a soup spoon placed right under the skin, scoop out the flesh (already in cubes!). Repeat with second half. This can be done an hour or so before use, without the avocado turning dark."

Sprinkle a mixture of cinnamon and brown sugar over the dough, then raisins and nuts if you wish. Roll dough up jelly-roll style and slice into 1 1/2-inch slices. Place side-by-side in a 9-inch square pan with the cut sides up. Sprinkle more cinnamon and sugar on top if you want to end up with sticky buns. These may take a little longer to bake"

I just chuck them into the pot with the 8 cups of water at the appropriate time. Perhaps you will make your own vegetable stock or herb stock (should fresh vegetables and herbs not be outrageously priced where you live). If you cannot find herb bouillon cubes, add 1 tsp dried herbs (e.g., 1/4 tsp dried parsley, 1/4 tsp dried dill, 1/4 tsp dried thyme, 1/4 tsp dried rosemary) to the water in lieu of the bouillon cube. Adjust salt to taste.",

      "Remove the lid, raise the heat to medium high, and stir in the honey. Cook uncovered for another 4-5 minutes until the wine is reduced to a thin glaze (if you're using a large Dutch oven, this happens fast so keep an eye). Taste for salt and pepper - I'd recommend not adding any until you've checked, as a very flavorful chorizo or other cured sausage often has just the seasoning you need (this is probably the only dish I make that I do not salt and pepper). Enjoy!"

Add the chicken to the bowl. Cover with very cold water and add a tray of ice cubes. Swish around with your hand to disperse them. Chill in the refrigerator until dinner time.",
      "Preheat your oven to 400\u00b0F (200\u00b0C). Remove the chicken from the fridge and pat dry completely with paper towels. Put the butter in a roasting pan large enough to fit the chicken in one layer (But remember, Judy says, \"You don't want to crowd it or then it'll stew, like mushrooms\"). Place the pan in the oven. In a 1-gallon freezer bag, pour in the flour, remaining 1 tablespoon salt and the pepper. Give it a good shake. Add the chicken pieces two at a time and shake them until thoroughly coated. As you lift them out of the bag, shake them off vigorously. This is vital. You do not want a gummy coating. Line them up on a plate, and repeat with the rest.",
      "Lay the chicken pieces in the roasting pan, skin side down, and oven-fry until a chestnut brown and crisp on the bottom, about 40 minutes (sometimes it takes as long as an hour). Don't flip them until this happens. Use a thin spatula to scrape them up off the pan and turn them; cook the other side until the bottom is browned, which will take less time, around 20 minutes. Remove the pieces from the oven as they finish cooking, and place on a plate lined with paper towels. Just before serving, grind fresh pepper over top and sprinkle lightly with sea salt."

      "Make ladyfingers: Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F. Line three baking sheets with parchment or silicone baking pads. Place coconut sugar in blender jar; process on highest setting until very finely ground. Remove about 2 tablespoons of ground coconut sugar; set aside in a small bowl. Add egg yolks to blender with remaining sugar; process over high speed until very pale and fluffy, about 2 minutes.",
      "In a separate bowl, beat egg whites until stiff peaks form. Add a scoopful of egg whites to blender; blend to combine and loosen egg yolks. Working gently, scrape contents of blender into remaining egg whites; fold until halfway combine. Sift dry mixture over egg white mixture in about three additions, alternately folding ingredients together, until fully combined. Spoon batter into a large piping bag fitted with a 1-inch round tip; pipe approximate 4-inch lines about 1/2-inch apart. (You should have about 48 piped cookies.) Transfer reserved ground coconut sugar into a small sieve and lightly dust piped cookies with sugar. (The sugar can be on the surface of the baking tray between the cookies.) Bake ladyfingers until they are puffed, golden, and the cookies spring back when pressed gently, 15 minutes. Transfer cookies to a wire rack to cool completely.",
      "Make cream: In the bowl of an electric mixer, combine egg yolks and agave. Using a whisk attachment, beat until egg yolks are very pale and fluffy, about 4 minutes. Beat in mascarpone in spoonful increments with mixer running. In a separate large bowl, whip heavy cream until stiff peaks form. Stir in one spoonful of whipped cream to egg mixture to lighten; scrape egg mixture into whipped cream and fold to fully combine.",
      "Assemble tiramisu: Cut a 3- to 4-inch strip of wax paper into an approximate 28-inch length. Lightly brush interior of ring of a 9-inch springform pan with oil or softened butter; press the strip along the interior of the ring to line it with the paper.",
      "In a shallow bowl or pie plate, combine coffee, vanilla and alcohol, if using. Place cocoa in a small sifter (on a piece of paper towel or plate to avoid mess on your counter!). Lightly dust bottom of prepared cake pan with cocoa. Working one at a time, quickly dip ladyfingers in coffee mixture (it shouldn't fully saturate the cookie, otherwise it will fall apart) and arrange along the outer edge, standing up with flat side facing the interior of the pan, in prepared cake pan until the rim is fully lined with dipped cookies. Continue to dip ladyfingers and arrange them along the bottom of the pan, breaking ladyfingers if needed to create an even layer. Top with a layer of cream (using about half of what you have), spread to the edges of the pan; dip and arrange another layer of ladyfingers on top of cream. Repeat with dipped ladyfingers and another layer of cream, then dust with remaining cocoa. (So, in the end, you have: a layer of ladyfingers, a layer of cream, a layer of ladyfingers, a layer of cream, dusting with cocoa.)",
      "Transfer tiramisu to the refrigerator to chill at least 4 hours to marry flavors and set, or up to overnight. See headnote for freezing instructions."

      "Combine the ricotta with 1/4 cup (35 grams) of confectioners' sugar and whisk until smooth. Add the chopped chocolate and candied fruit. Cover and let rest in the fridge for about 1 hour.",
      "Prepare the pastry dough by combining the flour and sugar. Add the butter and process in a food processor or rub together with fingers until the mixture is crumbly and the butter is distributed evenly through the mixture. Add the egg and yolk (saving the white for the glaze) and continue mixing until you have a smooth, solid and not sticky or crumbly dough. Let rest for 30 minutes in the fridge.",
      "Preheat the oven to 375\u00b0 F (180\u00b0 C) . Roll out the dough on a well-floured surface until thin (about 1/10 inch or 2 to 3 millimeters at most). Fill a 6 half-sphere Silicone mold tray with a piece of pastry and trim evenly so it fills the sphere perfectly. Fill with the ricotta mixture right to the top, smooth over, then cover with a circle-cut out of pastry. Push down along the edges to seal the pastry (if you want to, you can brush some of the spare egg white or even a bit of water around the bottom of the circle of pastry before pressing down to help seal). Continue with the rest of the mixture and dough.",
      "Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until the pastry is cooked evenly and is golden.",
      "Let the pastries cool in their mold. When cool enough to handle, carefully remove them from the mold and place on a cake rack to let them finish cooling. In the meantime, whip the leftover egg white to fluffy, soft peaks. When the pastries are completely cool, make the glaze by combining the rest of the confectioners' sugar with the lemon juice and enough of the egg white (about 2 tablespoons-but do it bit by bit) to create a very smooth, opaque icing that runs off the spoon like pancake batter.",
      "Place the pastries on a cake rack set over a tray or a chopping board. Ice the pastries by pouring a spoonful of icing at a time over the top (let it run down on its own; if some areas aren't covered, help it along by spooning another bit of icing from the top). Allow the icing to set, then top with a candied cherry."
