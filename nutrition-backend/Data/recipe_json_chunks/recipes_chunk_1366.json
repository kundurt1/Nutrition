      "Soak the red beans in plenty of water for at least 2 to 3 hours and ideally overnight, making sure beans are submerged fully by at least 1 to 2 inches of water. Rinse and drain.",
      "Next, combine the beans with 3 more cups of water in a pot and bring it to a boil over high heat. Once the water begins to boil, reduce the heat to low and let the beans simmer for about 1 1/2 to 2 hours. As the water boils down, you will need to add just enough water to keep the beans submerged. (For me, I added 1/2 cup after about 30 minutes of boiling, then another 1/2 cup every 15 to 20 minutes until the beans were done.) There is no need to stir the beans -- just keep them submerged in water. (Note: If you're concerned about any dirt or imperfections on the beans, blanch them before this step by bringing the water and beans to a boil, immediately draining and rinsing the beans, then proceeding with Step 2.)",
      "After an hour, test a bean by mashing it with a spoon or your fingers. If it splits as two halves, keep cooking. If it smushes easily, it's done simmering.",
      "Drain the beans, then add them to a food processor along with the sugar, and process on high until smooth. (If you don't have a food processor or blender, just drain the water, add the sugar directly to the pot, and keep cooking over low heat, mashing as you would mashed potatoes. It should be just fine that way, too.)",
      "Pour the paste into the pan and add the fat of your choice. If using the paste for steamed buns or mochi, opt for 1 to 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil. For mooncakes, use a solid fat: I used coconut oil, but many traditional mooncake fillings use lard. Stir until the fat is incorporated, then cook over medium heat for 3 to 5 minutes, stirring consistently, until the paste becomes glossy and forms a soft dough that sticks to the spoon in one mass.",
      "Remove from heat and chill until ready to use."

Using a filet knife cut into the meat perpendicular to the bone until the tip of the knife strikes it. Now run the knife down the length of the bone. Gently pry the meat apart and as you do so run the knife along the bone, essentially cutting around it. Always have the tip of the knife on the bone and hold the meat back and away from the knife with your other hand. You only want to cut the meat right at the bone. Once you have made it around the bone you will be able to lay the meat out flat. Place the lamb onto a large sheet of plastic wrap then place another large piece on top. Pound the meat with a mallet, the flat side of a cleaver or a heavy saute pan until it is flattened out and even. This will help you to roll it.",

Bring the liquid to a boil then reduce the heat to a simmer. Let the sauce simmer till it has reduced to about 1 1/2 cups of liquid. Strain the sauce (this is your au jus), taste, and adjust the seasoning. Keep it warm.",
      "Lay the leg of lamb out on a cutting board. Season it lightly with salt and pepper. Squeeze the roasted garlic cloves from the head of garlic into a small bowl and smash them. Combine the mustard with this and mix. Smear the mixture onto the lamb. Sprinkle on the parsley.",
      "Starting at the narrow end roll the leg of lamb tightly. Tie it tightly with kitchen twine. Season the exterior with salt and pepper. If you are cooking it right away, great, but if you did this in advance and you have the lamb in the fridge remove it and let it sit at room temperature for at least an hour before you start cooking it.",
      "Preheat the oven to 325? F. Place a cast iron or oven proof pan over high heat. Add a thin layer of oil to the pan then add the lamb. Sear it on all sides until it is nicely caramelized. Place it into the oven.",

You should check the internal temperature of the roast with an instant read thermometer at about the 1 hour and 10 minute mark.

Bring to a boil, reduce heat and cover. Maintain an active simmer for 1/2 hour. Stir occasionally and add more of the tomato liquid as needed. Check the seasoning. Let it rest for at least 15 minutes to give the flavors time to mellow. Serve in wide bowls.",

      "*About the tomatoes -- I tend to use what ever I have in the pantry, but my first choice would be either diced in puree or whole -- which would need to be hand chopped. There are excellent choices available. Just hold back some of the liquid to account for that variable -- if the liquid seems too thin, reduce it separately before adding it to the pot. You can always put a little water in if it is too thick."

Perhaps a food processor would work, if you're making a larger quantity. Scrape the sweet potato from its skins into a bowl, and mash to a smooth consistency. Add the seeds, egg, chilli and spices and mix until well-combined.",

Pat down to burger-thickness, and allow the base to crisp and get some stability. After 2-3 minutes, carefully turn over with a spatula. Do this slowly, as the soft mixture has a tendency to split. Fry on the other side for a further 2-3 minutes until crisp and brown. Drain any excess oil on a piece of kitchen paper.",

Chipotle past mixed with creme fraiche is another idea, and if you're not vegetarian, bacon tastes great here, like it does on anything! Add the patty to the artful composition, and enjoy.\r\n\r\nP.S. Things could get messy- falling toppings ahoy!"

Then combine the graham cracker crumbs, butter, sugar, rum and cinnamon together in a bowl and stir them together really well to resemble wet sand. Press the mixture into the pie pan firmly to form a solid, even crust. Bake it for 15-20 minutes to let it completely bake through and set. It will become gorgeously golden. While it bakes, spread the coconut out onto a lined sheet tray and toast it in the oven with the crust on another shelf. It should take 5-7 minutes for it to toast perfectly. Let the crust and coconut cool completely once they are done.",
      "While they cool, make the coconut cream. Combine the half and half, eggs, sugar, flour, coconut extract and salt together in a medium sauce pan. Whisk it all together thoroughly, then heat it on the stove over low heat. Stir it constantly while it warms up, then slowly increase the heat to medium low after 3-4 minutes. Number 4 on my gas stove was the magic number. Once it starts to bubble and thicken, keep stirring it constantly to let it cook for a couple of minutes. Then take it off of the heat and stir in 3/4 cup of the toasted coconut. Reserve the rest of the coconut to top the pie.",
      "Spread the coconut cream evenly in the cooled graham cracker crust and chill the pie for at least 4 hours. Then top it with a generous layer of whipped cream and sprinkle the remaining toasted coconut on the very top. Serve and enjoy!"

You want small pieces of greens here. Place the greens in the bowl with the farro, add 1/4 cup olive oil, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and fresh-cracked pepper to taste. Squeeze half of the lemon into the bowl catching the seeds with your hand. Toss, taste, and adjust with more salt or pepper to taste-I usually add another quarter teaspoon of salt and sometimes more. The farro and greens should taste slightly lemony and nicely seasoned, but nothing spectacular-remember that the magic happens when the grains and greens meet the tahini sauce. At this point, you can chill the farro and greens until you are ready to serve.",

Once the mixture has turned a golden caramel color, transfer it to a 2-cup glass measure. Set it aside to cool. It can be covered and stored in the refrigerator for up to one month.

If the cones won't be served within a few hours, wrap them in parchment or waxed paper, and store them in freezer bags.",

It's so worth it. Don't be afraid to make this your own and add spices or change proportions.",
      "The Curry\r\nFinely chop carlic, ginger, onion and if you'd like, a chili and sautee with cooking oil and a few healping tablespoons of your masala mix until evenly covered and transluscent. Make sure to add salt to taste. Then add the washed and de-stemmed curly dock and \"wilt\" and coat it with the spice and aromatics mixture. You will notice the bright green change to a khaki color.\r\n \r\nI then added about a cup about 2 cups of coconut milk to the curly dock and spices and let this simmer for 20-25 minutes. After it cooled slightly, I blended until smooth and silky. Then add your steamed or boiled yams chunks for pops of chunky sweetness. Use the idli to sop it up! I garnished with watercress, cilantro and...the wild chutney!",
      "I used my food processor again here (my bestie). So vibrant and green and POW! ZING! BAM! Your tongue doesn't know what to do - the wasabi punch from out of no where, then the peppery rush of the watercress and the green sweetness from the chickweed. Wow. Just wow. All together, this vibrant chutney, with the silky curly dock curry with coconut milk and the puffy, fermented pillows of idli. It was another excellent weekend and wild food adventure. I soooo heart food."

      "In a food processor, pulse the flour with the sugar, baking powder, and salt. Add the 2 sticks butter and pulse until it forms pea-sized crumbs. Pour in the egg and pulse until the dough just comes together and forms large clumps.",
      "Put a large piece of plastic wrap on your work surface. Remove about 1/3 of the dough from the food processor, place it on the plastic wrap, and use the wrap to flatten it into a disk. Flatten the remaining dough into a disk on another piece of plastic wrap. Wrap each piece well and refrigerator for at least 1 hour.",
      "Now start on the squash. Preheat the oven to 425\u00b0 F and line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. In a large bowl, toss the squash with 1 tablespoon brown sugar and all of the ingredients except the hazelnuts. Make sure it is well coated in the oil, spices, and sweeteners. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, stirring once or twice, until the squash is tender but not falling apart (it should be cooked to the point right before you'd want to eat it). Remove the squash from the oven and allow to cool.",
      "Turn the oven temperature down to 350\u00b0 F. Grease a 9-inch pie dish (a slightly deeper dish than usual is better, and I used a glass pie dish so that I could monitor the browning). On a lightly floured work surface, use a rolling pin to roll the larger disk until it's 1/4- to 1/8-inch thick. Now is time to transfer it to the pie plate. You won't be able to transfer the dough in one go (as it crumbles apart), so just remove thin pieces and press them into the pie plate until you've got the whole thing over. You'll want to use the pads of your fingers to make sure the dough is uniformly thick around the bottom and edges of the pan. Reserve any scraps.",
      "Mix the hazelnuts into the cooled squash, then dump it into the prepared pie dish. Sprinkle the remaining 1 tablespoon of brown sugar evenly over the squash.",
      "Roll out the other piece of dough (it can be slightly thicker than the first piece-I rolled to about 1/2-inch thickness). Pinch off small pieces of the this disk and scatter, along with the scraps from the bottom dough, all over the squash, creating shingle-like pieces. (You might have some extra dough-I shaped mine into cookies and baked them for about 15 minutes!)",
      "Bake the cake until golden brown and bubbling in the center, about 1 hour 15 minutes. Transfer the cake to a rack and let cool completely before serving."

Fold in the egg whites, one third at a time, until almost fully incorporated (just a few small streaks remain). Then sift in the two flours and 1/2 teaspoon salt, then fold until fully incorporated.",
      "Pour the batter into the greased pan, smoothing the top with a knife or spatula. Bake for 7-8 minutes, or until it bounces back when touched or a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Do not overbake.",
      "Immediately out of the oven, sift cocoa powder on the top of the cake just until covered, then invert onto a towel laid on the counter. Press down on the cake with the pan to flatten the original top, then remove the parchment paper and sift with cocoa powder. Starting with one of the shorter sides, roll the cake gently, along with the towel. Leave on a wire rack, seam side down, to cool completely.",
      "To make the ganache, place a glass bowl over a pot of simmering water over medium heat. Make sure the bowl does not touch the water. Add to the bowl 1/2 teaspoon salt, the cream, and the egg yolks. Whisk to smooth, then cook, stirring constantly, until thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat and add the chocolate, stirring until fully melted. If the filling is not sweet enough for you, add sugar to taste and stir to dissolve. If the sugar does not dissolve, place back on the pot of water until smooth. Let cool until it thickens into a more viscous consistency.",
      "To make the marshmallow frosting, combine the egg whites, cream of tartar, salt, 1 1/2 cups sugar, and vanilla in the bowl of a stand mixer set atop a pot of simmering water on medium heat. Whisk until the sugar is fully dissolved. If whipping by hand, whip until soft peaks form, then remove from heat and whip until stiff peaks form. Alternatively, to whip with a stand mixer, keep whisking the egg whites after the sugar has dissolved until they are very liquidy and starting to foam. Attach bowl to stand mixer and whip to just below stiff peaks.",
      "To make the candy flames, preheat the oven to 375F. Line a baking sheet with ungreased parchment paper. Divide the remaining 1/2 cup of sugar into three portions. Add the red and yellow food colorings to create a red, an orange, and a yellow sugar mixture. It's okay if the sugar is a bit lumpy. Arrange the sugar on the parchment paper, starting with a blob of yellow, then crowned with orange and finally topped red to look like a flat flame. Leave about an inch of space between the candy flames, and make as many as the amount of sugar allows or as many as you can fit. Melt the sugar in the oven--be careful, this can happen very quickly, and you don't want the sugar to burn. You may have to take some of the flames out before the others due to variations in size and oven temperature. When the flames are ready, the sugar will have melted and will turn into a glossy, glass-like sheet. This may take anywhere from 30 seconds to 3 minutes, depending on your oven and the thickness of the sugar coats. Let cool on the parchment, then carefully peel off. Set aside to cool completely.",
      "To assemble the cake, unroll the cooled cake. Spread the filling all over, leaving about one inch uncovered at the end. Reroll the cake, this time without the towel, and transfer to a plate. Cut the cake from one end on a shallow diagonal, then cut again from the new end to make a straight cut once again. Using some of the frosting as \"glue,\" attach one piece to the top and the other to the side, with their diagonal cuts on the cake. Make sure the two pieces \"point\" in the same direction. Use the remaining frosting to cover all of the cake except for the cut ends. Texture the cake with swooshes to achieve a more woody appearance. Using a blowtorch on the lowest setting, torch the frosting until most of it is toasted and the peaks are a deep brown. Attach the candy flames all along the log."

      "This recipe is for 5 different containers of 1/2 cup of salt each. Bear in mind these are flavoured salts which will have a strong flavour and are meant to be used sparingly as flavouring not as the only salt seasoning. Some of the spices have to be lightly toasted in a frying pan to bring out their fragrance. Other ingredients have to be crushed in a mortar so as to reduce the size but don't powder them completely.",
      "FIRST IMPORTANT STEP - Label bowls and containers otherwise you will loose track of which is which. Divide the salt in 5 bowls.",
      "Italian salt: Chop very finely the dry tomato and cut the rosemary needles in smaller pieces. Add to the salt with the dry oregano leaves, dried sage, fennel seeds and dried Marjoram. Marjoram is from the basil family but basil doesn't dry well and it ends up with a very weird taste so it's best to use marjoram. Mix all the ingredients very well with a fork and fill the container.",
      "French salt: Zest the lemon and dry in an 200\u00b0F oven for 1 hour until completely dry. Cut the dry bay leaf in very small pieces. Add the bay leaf, the lemon zest, the thyme, the dry pasrley and the tarragon to the salt. Mix all the ingredients very well with a fork and fill the container.",
      "Indian Salt: Crush the cardamom pod, cloves and the coriander seeds in a mortar. In a frying pan over moderate heat, lightly toast the crushed cardamom, crushed coriander, cloves, cumin seeds, mustard seeds and shredded coconut. They should barely toast, just enough for the heat to make bring out their frangrance. Remove from the heat and allow to cool completely. Add them to the salt. Add the turmeric powder, ginger powder, curry powder, cinnamon powder, garam masala and the freshly grated nutmeg. Mix all the ingredients very well with a fork and fill the container.",
      "Moroccan Salt: In a mortar crush the black peppercorns, white peppercorns, coriander seeds and the cloves. In a frying pan over moderate heat, lightly toast the crushed spices just enough for the heat to make bring out their frangrance. Allow to cool completely. Add them to the salt, add the cumin seeds, powdered ginger, turmeric, cinnamon, cayenne pepper, the freshly grated nutmeg and the allspice. Mix all the ingredients very well with a fork and fill the container.",
      "Mexican Salt: Add the chilli flakes, chilli powder, dried cilantro, dried Mexican Oregano, cumin seeds and the dried Epazote to the salt. Mix all the ingredients very well with a fork and fill the container. The cilantro, Epazote and Mexican Oregano can be purchased in a Mexican food speciality shop.",
      "Note 1: This is the proportion I use to have a strong flavour for each salt. As I make about 18 gifts, I multiply this recipe by 18, so it's easy for me to keep track of the same flavour every time I remake the gifts but feel free to add other ingredients you like.",
      "Note 2: I make the salts at least 1 month ahead so the flavour diffuses itself by Christmas.",
      "Drying fresh herbs: If you have fresh herbs and want to dry them yourself, pick them in the morning, clean with a cloth to remove any earth or dust (don't wash them ever) and hang them upside down in a dark, cool and ventilated room. They will remain green and tasty. If you leave them in the kitchen to dry they turn grey and loose a lot of taste."

Set the salad and vinaigrette aside until needed. (If you're going to chill the chicken breasts, cover and refrigerate the salad.)",
      "TO MAKE THE CHICKEN: Center a rack in the oven and preheat it to 300\u00b0F, to keep the first batch of cutlets warm while you cook the rest. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a double layer of paper towels. Have another baking sheet lined with parchment or a rack to hold the breaded cutlets.",
      "Sandwich the cutlets between sheets of parchment or wax paper and pound them with the bottom of a skillet or the at side of a meat tenderizer.",
      "Set out three shallow bowls (I use soup plates). Put about 1/2 cup of bread crumbs in each of two bowls and crack the eggs into the third bowl; put the egg bowl between the other two. Season the crumbs and eggs with salt and pepper and lightly beat the eggs to break them up.",
      "One by one, dredge the cutlets in the first bowl of crumbs, run them through the eggs and then coat them in the second bowl of crumbs, placing the breaded cutlets on the lined baking sheet or the rack. Replenish the bread crumbs as you go, if needed. If you have time, chill the cutlets, uncovered. (The breaded cutlets can be refrigerated for up to 8 hours.)",
      "Set a large skillet-nonstick is great here-over medium heat. Add 1 tablespoon of the butter and 2 tablespoons of the oil, and when the butter is melted and the bubbling has subsided, slip in 2 cutlets, or as many as fit comfortably in the pan. Cook until the breading is golden on the underside-adjust the heat and tilt the pan as needed so that the chicken, not the butter, browns-then carefully turn the cutlets over to cook and brown the other side. You'll need about 3 minutes on each side, but this will vary according to thickness-it's best to cut into the center of a cutlet to test. When the cutlets are golden and cooked through, transfer them to the second lined baking sheet and pop them into the oven to keep warm.",
      "WORKING AHEAD: If you can bread the cutlets and give them a few hours in the fridge before sauteing them, do it. A chill gives the coating time to firm and dry a bit, so you get a crisper cutlet."

      "Peel the potatoes, slice as thinly as possible and halve or quarter the slices (depending on the size of the potato). Do the same with your onion. I find it easiest to halve the root, then slice thinly, then halve the resulting slices.",
      "Heat the oil in a 10-12 inch heavy skillet (I prefer cast iron). Drop a slice of potato into the oil. When bubbles form at the edges, the oil is ready. Add the potatoes and onions all at once, and cook over low heat, stirring frequently. You are poaching the potatoes in the oil rather than frying them, which is why you want to cook over a low, gentle heat. This also minimizes sticking, (though I admit I always have some potatoes that cling to the pan).",
      "Stir frequently to bring the cooked potatoes up from the bottom and turn the uncooked potatoes into the oil, ensuring that everything cooks evenly. The potatoes will go from opaque to hinting at a shimmering translucence.",
      "When the potatoes are cooked, drain them over a deep plate-you'll be reserving the oil.",
      "As they cool, crack your eggs into a large bowl and beat them lightly.",
      "Pour a few tablespoons of the reserved oil back into the pan and heat. When the oil is hot, dump the potatoes into the eggs, turn them to coat, and pour into the pan. Pat the mixture out evenly over the surface of the skillet.",
      "Place a rack at the top level of your oven and heat the broiler.",
      "Cook gently until the tortilla firms up around the edges, then slide under the broiler. Depending on how long your broiler has been preheating, this could take just two minutes or up to 5 minutes. Check after two minutes and every minute thereafter.",
      "Remove, allow to cool to room temperature in the skillet, slice and serve.",
      "Note you can reserve the extra oil in the refrigerator for other uses, though I admit I'm not very good about re-using it, despite best intentions. The prolific use of olive oil makes this dish a bit of a luxury, but I still find it worth it."

Reduce the heat and simmer for 45 minutes to 1 hour or until tender. Stir occasionally to promote even cooking. Drain the chickpeas, set aside the garlic cloves, and reserve the cooking water. Set aside 1/4 cup of chickpeas for garnish.",

Drizzle the hummus with fruity olive oil and garnish with a sprinkle of paprika, chopped parsley, and the toasted chickpeas. Serve with warm and fluffy flatbread pita, cucumber and red onion salad*, and cornichons. Encourage everyone to tear off bits of pita, swirl it in the hummus, and top with the harif and salad.",

    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "NOTE: The pre-battered nuggets keep perfectly in the freezer for whenever hunger strikes, and the batter whips up in no time. Could be, or not be... a good thing.\r\n\r\nThe freezing before processing the chicken is super important. The nuggets is extra juicy and flavourful because of the minced skin, but the skin will never be \"minced\" properly in the food-processor without proper freezing. By proper freezing, I mean borderline frozen, not rock-hard frozen. If you are flash-freezing the chicken right before the processing, cut them into chunks (so they freeze faster) and flash-freeze for 2 hours until the skins are hard. If you are using already frozen chicken (which is rock-hard), leave them at room-temperature for 1:30 ~ 2 hrs to thaw. You should be able to, with much applied force, cut through them with a knife. It's always better to over-freeze than under-freeze.",
      "NOTE 2: If you don't mind a few minutes of extra work, double/re-frying the nuggets at high-heat for about 30 seconds does make a difference (why do you think McD does it?). Yeah, just like French fries. It draws even more moistures away from the batter, making them crispier, and stay crispier for longer. Just for the record, I'm perfectly happy with the fried-once-only nuggets that are already golden browned and crispy. But if you need these nuggets to stay alive for hours, re-frying is a good option.\r\n\r\nDo not keep the nuggets in the oven to stay warm. It will kill them sogging-ly. Ain't nothing wrong with cold but crispy nuggets.",
      "**TO MAKE THE NUGGETS: (See notes above about freezing the chicken) Spread the skin-on chicken thighs and chicken breast on a sheet in one single layer, and flash-freeze for 2 hours until the skins have completely harden. In a food-processor, add the chicken, cornstarch, salt and ground black pepper. Pulse until all the chickens are evenly cut into finely minced pieces (think beef tartar), but not fully \"ground\" into a paste. This is quite important as it retains the texture of the chicken, otherwise the nuggets will resemble meatballs or sausages. The skins should be evenly cut into the meat if they were properly frozen.",
      "Evenly whisk together all-purpose flour, 1/2 tsp of salt and 1/2 tsp of freshly ground black pepper in a shallow bowl. Prepare a couple of baking-sheets that are lightly dusted with flour.\r\n\r\nTake about 1 tbsp of the chicken-mixture, form it into a firm/tightly packed ball (if it's sticking too much on your hands, wet your hands with a little water), then roll it in the flour then gently press it down (keeping it inside the bowl of flour) into a chubby disk (well, like a nugget). It helps to maintain a \"wet hand (chicken hand)\" and \"dry hand (flour hand)\" system. The nugget should be thinly and evenly coated with the flour-mixture on all sides. Place it on the baking-sheets and repeat until you're done with all the chickens. You should have about 60 nuggets depending on size. Flash-freeze the nuggets on the baking-sheets for 2 hours until completely hardened. Then transfer to an air-tight bag/container, and keep frozen until needed.",
      "**TO FRY/FINISH THE NUGGETS: Take however many nuggets you're frying out of the freezer, set aside (doesn't really need to thaw). Whisk together all-purpose flour, tapioca starch, black pepper, salt and baking soda in a bowl. Add the egg yolk into another large measuring-cup, then add enough iced water until it reaches 1 cup in total. Whisk until even, then pour it over the flour-mixture while gently mixing in with chopsticks or a fork. Do not over-mix the batter. It's perfectly fine if there are small lumps of flour here and there. Add a few pieces of frozen nuggets in the batter to keep it cold (careful not to let them stick together).",
      "Add enough vegetable oil in a frying-pot until it reaches about 2? deep (I'm using a small, narrow pot so I didn't need that much). Heat the oil over medium-high heat until when a wooden chopstick is inserted in the middle, small bubbles form immediately around the chopstick. Drop however many battered nuggets (let extra batter drain off for a few seconds before frying) into the oil without crowding the pot (the batter may break off into tiny pieces once it hits the oil. it's ok. it should). Lower the heat down to medium and fry until golden on all sides and increase to high heat for the last 20 seconds (you have to control the heat so that the batter isn't over-browned while the chicken is still raw). Drain the nuggets over a cooling-rack (see notes above about double/re-frying). Remove small pieces of batter from the oil with a slotted spoon in between each batch.\r\n\r\nToss the nuggets with minced garlic, ground black pepper and ground white pepper. Serve with some sprinkled chili flakes, and... the sauce:",
      "**TO MAKE THE HOT, SWEET AND SOUR SAUCE: Combine pineapple juice, apple juice, lemon juice, tabasco sauce, granulated sugar, dark brown sugar and salt in a sauce pot. Bring to a simmer over medium heat and reduce the mixture down by 2/3. Take about 4 tbsp of the mixture out of the sauce pot and let it cool slightly, then whisk in the cornstarch until completely smooth and lump-free. Add it back into the sauce pot and cook over medium heat, until the mixture has fully thickened and goes from opaque to completely translucent (meaning the cornstarch is thoroughly cooked).

Set the bowl in a wide skillet filled with enough hot tap water to reach above the depth of the egg mixture. Set the skillet over medium heat. Using a heatproof Silicone spatula, stir the egg mixture, sweeping the sides and bottom of the bowl constantly to prevent the egg whites from scrambling. Adjust the burner so the water remains below a simmer, and continue to stir until the mixture registers between 160\u00b0 and 165\u00b0 F on the instant-read thermometer. Swish the thermometer stem in the hot skillet water to rinse off the raw egg after each temperature reading.",
      "Remove the bowl from the skillet and scrape the mixture into the strainer. Rap the strainer to coax the mixture through it, but do not press on any bits that may be left in the strainer. Turn the strainer and scrape the mixture clinging to the underside into the bowl. Beat at high speed for 3 to 4 minutes, or until the mixture is cool and resembles stiff fluffy meringue (which is exactly what it will be).",
      "Cut the butter into several chunks and beat it into the meringue chunk by chunk, until it is smooth and creamy. The meringue will deflate when you add the butter. If the butter is too cold, the mixture will curdle or separate at first, but it will most likely smooth out as you continue to beat. If it remains curdled, set the bowl in a pan of warm water for a few seconds and then continue to beat. If the meringue or the butter are too warm when you combine them, the buttercream will seem soupy instead of creamy. If it doesn't thicken up with more beating, set the bowl in a bowl of ice and water or in the refrigerator for 5 to 10 minutes, then resume beating until the mixture is creamy and smooth. Flavor as desired, with 1/2 teaspoon or more vanilla extract or vanilla bean paste, 3 to 4 teaspoons instant espresso powder dissolved in less than a teaspoon of water, grated citrus zest, etc. Avoid any flavoring that involves adding more than 2 or 3 teaspoons of liquid.",
      "Refrigerate or freeze buttercream to store. To soften, break chilled or frozen buttercream into chunks with a fork. Microwave on low, for several seconds, then stir smooth with a rubber spatula. Or, set the bowl in hot water until some buttercream melts around the sides of the bowl. Stir, replace the bowl in the hot water, then stir again. Repeat until the buttercream is smooth and spreadable.",
      "Note: This French-style buttercream is very different from American \"buttercream\" frosting made with confectioners' sugar and butter. If it is too thick or too soft, always adjust it by vigorous stirring and either gentle warming or chilling as necessary: Never adjust by adding more butter, sugar, or liquid."

The turkey is done when the internal temperature reaches 155 degrees. Remove from the oven and allow to rest for 30 minutes before slicing. the internal temperature will rise to 160 to 165 degrees while the turkey rests.

      "SOAKING THE BEANS: If you have time, soak the beans overnight. Put the beans in a large bowl. Add about three inches cold water to cover and leave the beans for at least eight hours. Alternatively, you can do a quick soak method. Put beans in a large saucepan add three inches water to cover and bring to a rolling boil. Let boil for two minutes, then remove from heat and let sit one hour.",
      "SLOW COOKER METHOD: Drain the beans from the soaking water and discard. Put beans into the slow cooker insert. Add chopped yellow onion, rosemary, thyme, 1 tablespoon lard or olive oil and about 2 inches water to cover. Put lid on and turn slow cooker on to high heat. Once the mixture starts to simmer (after about 1 1/2 to 2 hours), reduce heat to low. Stir every couple of hours. After about four hours of total cooking time, add salt. I suggest adding about 3/4 teaspoon. You can add more later, if needed. Total cooking time will be about six hours. You'll know the beans are done when they are gloriously tender but not falling apart. Try a couple to see if they are completely cooked. Now is the time to add more salt, if needed. Beans should not have a salty taste, but they shouldn't taste flat either. If making ahead of time, store beans in their liquid in the refrigerator for up to four days.",
      "STOVETOP METHOD: Drain the beans from the soaking water. Add beans to a large Dutch oven or saucepan. Add yellow onion, rosemary, thyme, lard or olive oil and about 6 cups water. Bring beans to a simmer and cook for about 1 hour, stirring occasionally. Season to taste with salt (see above) and taste a few beans to ensure that they are evenly cooked. Remove from heat. If making ahead of time, store beans in their liquid in the refrigerator for up to four days.",
      "MAKING THE GRITS: About half an hour before you are ready to dine, prepare the grits. In a medium saucepan, bring 4 cups water to a boil. Add 3/4 teaspoon salt. Turn heat to medium low and slowly add grits in a thin stream to the water, stirring well with a wooden spoon so that grits dissolve and no lumps form. Keep stirring for a minute or two and turn heat down, so that grits cook at a gentle simmer. If grits start to stick to saucepan, add small amounts of additional water (about 1/8 cup at a time) and turn heat down further. Cook grits for about 25-30 minutes, stirring occasionally, until grits are creamy. Taste a spoonful. When they no longer have a sandy texture, they are done. If they need more salt, now is the time to add another pinch or two. Remove from heat. Add butter to grits and stir until melted. Keep grits covered until you are ready to plate. If grits appear to thicken before you are ready to serve, just thin with a tablespoon or two of hot water.",
      "WARMING THE BEANS: While the grits are cooking, remove about half of the beans and a few ladlefuls of liquid to a small Dutch oven or medium saucepan. Warm the beans over very low heat until they just start to bubble.",
      "PREPARING THE TOMATO GARNISH: Set your oven to its broil setting. Place cherry tomatoes in a small rimmed baking sheet or pie pan. Add 1 tablespoon olive oil and a pinch of salt. With your hands or a big spoon, thoroughly coat tomatoes. Place in oven and broil for about 4-5 minutes or until tomatoes begin to blister and develop a few charred spots. Keep a careful eye on them, so that they don't burn. Remove from oven and with a fork gently press down on tomatoes until a little juice dribbles out. Put back in oven for 1 minute. Remove from heat.",
      "MAKING THE AGRODOLCE SAUCE: In a small skillet, heat 1/2 tablespoon olive oil. Add shallot or sweet onion and saute until golden. Remove pan from heat. Add honey. Put pan back on burner and adjust heat to medium low. Stir honey and shallot mixture until honey begins to caramelize and mixture begins to form large bubbles. Continue cooking for one minute, then slowly add vinegar to pan and bring back to a boil, stirring occasionally. The mixture will smell very vinegary. Let simmer until vinegar has reduced, sauce has thickened slightly and has a syrupy consistency. Add a pinch of salt to taste and remove from heat. Add any accumulated juices from the broiled tomatoes to the sauce.",
      "COOKING THE GREENS: Add greens to beans in the pot and stir gently for about a minute or until wilted. Remove from heat and drizzle on your best quality extra virgin olive oil.",
      "PLATING THE DISH: Put a heaping spoonful or two of grits on each plate, spreading the grits on the plate to form a thin layer. Add a ladleful of beans and greens over the top of the grits, making sure to include some of the bean liquid. Garnish with several tomatoes. Finally, drizzle the agrodolce sauce on top of all, passing more around at the table. Serve with some nice crusty Ciabatta bread and a glass of your favorite wine. Enjoy!"

      "What pasta\r\nWhite pasta is delicious. But whole grain pasta is also so good!\r\nSpelt pasta is a good healthy option; I don't like kamut pasta, but I love rice and buckwheat noodles, but... only for Asian style dishes (yummy wok!).\r\nThere are an infinite number of pasta sizes and formats: each region has one or more typical formats, result of years of culinary traditions and foodies looking for the perfect shape for their local ingredients and seasonings.\r\nI can tell you this: rough and striped pasta hold back the seasoning much better. But they also kind of absorb it, so if you have a dense condiment and you match it with rough pasta you might get a dry, heavy result.\r\nRegarding long or short pasta.... mmmhhh... this is difficult...\r\nWe usually refer to traditions: what our ancestors decided was the best for each of their wonderful local recipes we take for granted.\r\nAlthough, there is a great margin for personal taste: truth is, at the end, Italians choose the pasta according to tradition, to personal tastes and... to whatever they have in the pantry!\r\nHowever, I found a basic rule for you:\r\n buttery and/or meat condiments give their best with short pasta\r\n oily and/or fish or veggie condiments are great with long pasta.",
      "How to prep\r\nYou need a lot of water: 1 liter for each 100 gr of pasta.\r\nAnd salt: please salt the water! There is no way you can eat unsalted pasta: 10 gr of coarse salt for every liter of water. But remember: if you are going to season your pasta with a very salty condiment, reduce salt to 5-7 grams!\r\nRemember: 1 10 100.\r\nUsually Italians put salt in the water only when it is boiling, to avoid it from delaying boil. As I found out there is no scientific evidence of this, I put salt immediately to not forget it!\r\n\"Al dente\" pasta is the best:\r\n good to taste\r\n better to digest\r\nTo get \"al dente\" pasta, I usually cook it 1 minute less than the time indicated on the packaging.\r\nAlways take a bite and look at the center: too white? Still needs cooking.",
      "In the pan:\r\nI love this easy, one pot, fast way of cooking pasta.\r\nThe only difficult part is the quantity of water: I usually start with two times the weight in water and then progressively add more; to be sure I don't overcook it.\r\nThe good thing is the creamy result: starches released stay there, they don't flow away with drained water, so even a simple tomato pasta tastes like butter or cream was added to it.",
      "About serving sizes:\r\nOn a diet you should eat 60-70 grams of pasta.\r\nOn a normal balance diet 80-100 grams... but ask any Italian and he/she will probably answer you that 120 grams is what they usually end up eating. It obviously depend on condiments: the heavier the seasoning the less pasta you'll be willing/able to eat!",
      "Ok, now you are ready to face a serious pasta cooking session.\r\nEnjoyyyy!"

      "Egg: Heat 3-4 inches of water in a small pan. When the water boils, add the vinegar and salt and turn heat down to low, so that the water is just barely simmering. Crack an egg in small bowl and gently slide the egg into the water. (With a long spoon, gently coax the egg white towards the egg.) Do the same with the other egg. Set a timer for 3 minutes. The egg is perfectly cooked when the white sets and the yolk is still slightly runny; cook longer for a harder yolk, or shorter if you like it mad runny. When done, remove from water with slotted spoon or spider, and drain on a clean kitchen towel.",
      "Serve: Layer polenta at the bottom of a shallow bowl, then add about 1/2 cup of the zucchini saute, then top with egg. Season with salt and pepper."

Add 1 to 2 more tablespoons water if necessary, but stop before the dough gets too wet; it should just hold together when you squeeze it in your hand.

Using a paring knife, cut 4 small slits in the pastry. Bake until the top is golden brown and the caramel is bubbling, 24 to 28 minutes. Let cool on a rack for 5 minutes.

    "title": "lowfat pressure cooker cr\u00e8me caramel",
    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "Find a baking dish that fits inside your pressure cooker. You will need to be able to lower the filled dish into the cooker, cover it with a lid or a plate, and close the pressure cooker lid. You will also need enough water in the cooker to reach about halfway up the sides of the dish: all of these logistics are best sorted out before the dish is full of hot liquid custard! Figure out the capacity of the dish and multiply the ingredients accordingly, then butter the dish. (The doubled recipe---6 cups milk, 9 eggs---*just* fits into my 2.5-quart round Corningware dish, which in turn *just* fits into my pressure cooker.)",
      "Set the milk to scald, in a pan that can hold the same volume as your chosen baking dish. Keep an eye on it as you're prepping the caramel. Once scalded, stir in the salt and custard sugar and leave it to cool.",
      "While the milk is a-scalding, melt the caramel sugar: put the sugar into a skillet over high heat. Once it starts to melt, keep the sugar moving by swirling and shaking the pan (there's a balance between letting it get hot enough to melt and keeping it moving so it'll caramelize evenly---you'll get the hang of it very quickly). Keep doing this until the sugar is an even amber color. If you like a strong caramel taste, keep going until it's a dark amber. I like mine almost molasses-colored.",
      "Moving quickly, turn off the heat and pour the caramelized sugar into the bottom of your baking dish. Ideally, you want an even layer at the bottom, but it'll all melt into the custard anyway. I like to tip the dish and pour into the higher side, but BEWARE: the sugar is very hot; don't touch the bottom of the dish! (A friend of mine once cracked a pyrex dish with melted sugar.) Set aside to cool.",
      "Beat the eggs thoroughly in a vessel of your choice. (A large bowl if you don't want to use the scalding pan to mix the custard, the measuring cup you used for the milk if you don't want to dirty more dishes, etc.)",
      "Once the milk is scalded and slightly cooled AND the caramel has had 5-10 minutes to cool, combine the sugared & salted milk with the beaten eggs and the vanilla, pour into the caramel-bottomed dish.",
      "Add some water to your pressure cooker if you skipped that part of step 1. Lower the filled baking dish into your pressure cooker. (If space is tight and you're just holding on with your fingertips, moving your wrists in towards each other will help you get a better grip). Cover the baking dish with a lid or a plate, and seal up the pressure cooker.",
      "Cook for the right amount of time, which will vary depending on your pressure cooker. Aim for 15-20 minutes at medium-high pressure. I put mine on medium-high heat, wait until the valve starts to release some puffs of steam, and then set the timer. If you don't have a steamer insert you may hear some clanking of the dish against the bottom of the pot. In my experience this doesn't harm the quality of the custard.",
      "Turn off the heat, release the pressure, remove the pressure cooker lid, and let the whole thing cool enough for you to remove the baking dish. N.B.: the custard will NOT look cooked---it will be jigglier than you're used to. Unless something went very wrong with your pressure, it should be cooked. Just let it cool.",
      "Gluttons like myself spoon the custard out while still warm. Others may wish to wait until it's fully cooled (give it at least a couple of hours, so the caramel at the bottom has a chance to dissolve completely into yummy sauce), run a knife around the edge, invert a serving dish over the baking dish, hold the dishes together tightly and flip them over so the custard falls into the serving dish, presenting its beautiful brown top to your guests.",
      "FOR CHOCOLATE CUSTARD: dispense with caramel steps and instead stir 2 oz. melted bitter chocolate into the custard mixture. (Mystery Chef says to pour caramelized sugar into the scalded milk, stirring until it's all dissolved, and then add chocolate as well, but that sounds like a little much to me.)"

Move the walnuts to a parchment paper-lined baking sheet; when the oven is hot, toast the walnuts for 8 to 10 minutes, or until they smell divine. Remove the walnuts from the oven, and allow them to cool. (When cool, roughly chop the nuts, reserving a couple of whole ones, to garnish the cake with, if you like.)",

Peel the ginger (use a spoon-it's easier than a vegetable peeler), and then grate the ginger using a microplane, or the smallest holes of a box grater. In a small bowl, stir the ginger into the carrots. Set the bowl aside.",
      "In a large bowl, beat together the eggs and the sugar for 1 to 2 minutes using an electric mixer on medium speed. Add the vanilla. In a separate medium bowl, whisk together the flour, the baking soda, the baking powder, the kosher salt, the cinnamon, and the nutmeg. Fold the dry ingredients into the wet, alternatively adding the melted coconut oil and the yogurt as you go. Zest both the lemon and the orange directly into the mixing bowl. Add the chopped walnuts, the raisins, and the carrots/ginger; fold to incorporate.",
      "Divide the batter between the two pans. Bake for 35-40 minutes, or until a knife comes out clean. Remove the cakes from the oven, and allow them to cool completely. When the cake has cooled, you may slice each round crosswise into two halves, forming four thin cake layers. Or, keep them as they are, for a two layer cake. Frost however you like-the recipe below yields enough frosting to cover four layers, as well as the outside of the cake.",
      "Bring a pot of water to a simmer over medium heat. Meanwhile, add the egg whites, the sugar, and the salt to a metal (read: heatproof) bowl and set it over the warm water-you are creating a water bath, or bain-marie. Whisk the egg whites together with the sugar for 2 to 3 minutes without pause, until the whites heat up and look silky smooth. Rub a bit between two fingers to check that it is no longer grainy-you want the sugar to have dissolved completely into the whites. Carefully take the bowl off the heat.",
      "Using the whisk attachment of an electric mixer on high speed, continue beating the whites until they form firm and lacquered peaks. The whole shebang takes about 10 minutes. Use this time to sing loudly to a couple of your favorite songs. Cut the butter into pieces, and then add it bit by small bit to the whites, continuing to beat on medium speed as you go. Incorporate each piece of butter before you add some more. Remember: just keep beating, just keep beating. Even if it seems like the butter is separating and that all is wrong with the world, I promise that if you keep at it, the frosting will come together. Like the previous step, the butter incorporation takes time to accomplish, so I advise you to continue singing loudly and joyously.",
      "When all the butter has been worked into the whites, add the vanilla and the lemon juice and mix. Add the cream cheese little by little, just like the butter, and then repeat this process with the mascarpone. Again, don't be deterred if the whole thing starts to separate on you. You are strong. You will get through this. (But things will get easier once you add the cream cheese.) Mix until you have a cohesive, light and fluffy frosting, about 10 minutes.",
      "If the cakes are cooled by now, you are ready to start frosting. Feel free to get fancy with a piping bag. If you find the frosting too soft, firm it in the refrigerator for about 20 minutes. This frosting can be made up to 3 days in advance; remove it 20 to 30 minutes before use, to allow it to soften."

Pick up the dough, holding it by one of the tapered ends, lift it high above the counter, and slap it down hard again several times, stretching it out in a lengthwise direction.

    "directions": [
      "MEASURING: Scale all of the ingredients. Place the flour in a large bowl and add the salt and yeast, making sure they do not touch each other. If they do, it will cause a reaction that decreases the yeast's ability to develop. Take the temperature of the water -- it should be 65\u00b0 F to 70\u00b0 F.",
      "MIXING AND KNEADING: Pour half of the water into the bowl of the mixer; then, add the dry ingredients. Attach the bowl and dough hook to the mixer and begin mixing on low speed (\"1\" on most mixers). Quickly add enough of the remaining water in a slow, steady stream to make a soft, moist dough that slightly sticks to the sides of the bowl. Take care to add the remaining water immediately; if the water is added too late in the mixing process, the dough will become too firm to mix easily. Stop the mixer often and use a rubber spatula to scrape down the hook and sides of the bowl to ensure that all of the ingredients have been well incorporated.",
      "When all of the water has been added, set a timer and mix for 5 minutes. Your dough should be soft and pliable. Increase the speed to medium-low (setting \"2\") and mix for 4 minutes, gradually adding 1 tablespoon olive oil. Continue to mix until the oil is thoroughly incorporated, about 1 more minute. The dough should be soft and smooth, with a moist, tacky surface.",
      "FIRST FERMENTATION: Using an instant-read thermometer, take the temperature of the dough. It should be between 72\u00b0 F and 80\u00b0 F. This dough will be in first fermentation for 3 hours, with a fold after each hour.",
      "Using your fingertips, coat the inside of a large bowl with the remaining\r\n2 tablespoons olive oil. Using a bench scraper, scrape the dough into the oil-coated bowl. Using your hands, pull one edge of the dough and fold it into the center and press down slightly. Give the bowl a quarter turn and continue to fold the dough\r\nin and press for 4 additional turns. The dough should begin to form a ball.\r\nRoll the ball around in the bowl to coat all sides with olive oil, turning it so\r\nthat the smooth side is up. The dough does not need to be covered, as the\r\noil prevents dryness. Place the dough in a warm (75\u00b0 F to 80\u00b0 F), draft-free place for 3 hours, folding as above after the first and second hour.",
      "DIVIDING AND SHAPING: Generously coat a clean work surface with flour. Flour the top of the dough and, using a bowl scraper, scrape the dough onto the floured work surface. Lightly dust the exterior of the dough with flour and allow the dough to rest for 30 seconds. If the dough is very sticky, lightly flour your hands and add more flour to the work surface. If the dough sticks to the table, use your bench scraper to lift it up; do not pull or stretch the dough.",
      "If you are making two small loaves, lightly press down on the dough with a flat hand, forming the dough into a square. Using a bench scraper, cut the dough in half to form two rectangles. For one large loaf, lightly press down on the dough with a flat hand, forming the dough into a large rectangle. This is a rather free-form bread, so the shape does not have to be perfect. Place the dough in a lightly floured couche (or a strong linen towel). It does not matter whether you have the smooth side up or down for the final proofing as long as you bake it smooth side up. (If making 2 loaves, make a second ridge in the couche to separate them.) Fold the remaining couche over the top.",
      "SECOND FERMENTATION: Place the couche in a warm (75\u00b0 F to 80\u00b0 F), draft-free place. It should take from 45 minutes to 1 hour for the final proofing; however, you should keep a close eye on the dough, because if it is overproofed it will be unusable. To determine whether the dough is ready to be baked, uncover it and gently make a small indentation in the center of the dough with your fingertip. If the indentation slowly and evenly disappears, the bread is ready to bake.",
      "About 30 minutes before you are ready to bake, move one oven rack\r\nto the lowest rung and remove the other. Place a large baking stone on the\r\nrack and preheat the oven to 450\u00b0 F.",
      "BAKING: Cover a bread peel with a sheet of parchment paper. Using your hands, gently remove the loaf from the couche and transfer it to the peel, top side up.\r\nCarefully slide the loaf on the parchment paper onto the center of the stone, taking care not to touch the hot surface. If you are baking two loaves together, take care that they don't \"kiss\" (touch and get stuck together while baking).",
      "Quickly cover the loaf with a large stainless-steel mixing bowl and immediately close the oven door (if you are making two loaves, and both won't fit under the bowl, cover one with plastic wrap and place in the refrigerator, then bake after the first loaf comes out of the oven). Bake for 10 minutes; then, lift the edge of the bowl with the tip of a small knife and use oven mitts to carefully remove the hot bowl.",
      "Continue to bake until the bread is a pale golden brown with a lightly floured crust, about 15 minutes more. If you are concerned about the bread's doneness, insert an instant-read thermometer from the bottom of the bread into the center. If it reads 185 \u00b0F to 210 \u00b0F the bread is fully baked. Transfer the loaf to a cooling rack and let it cool for at least 1 hour before cutting with a serrated knife or wrapping for storage."

Bake for 35-40 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center is clean or even with a bit of moist crumb. Place on a wire rack and cool for about 5 minutes.",
      "While cake is in oven, stir cream and sugar in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil , add butter and let simmer for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add rum and vanilla off heat. Using a long skewer, poke holes all over the warm cake. Slowly and gradually pour 1 and 1/2 cup of sauce over the cake. I like to do that while cake is in springform pan. Let sauce get absorbed in cake for about 1 hour or so. Before you remove sides of pan, place it on a plate in case some sauce drips. Use a cake spatula (or whatever the name is used for sliding cakes out of a plate) and place on serving platter. Try to pour on cake any sauce that may have dripped or is still in pan. Best served warm but it is good room temperature too. Allow guests to pour more sauce on their individual servings. You can also choose to re-warm the extra sauce when serving leftover cake. Additionally, if you want to add more of a British touch, pour a bit of Devonshire cream on your serving.",
      "Note: if some sauce falls on the plate from the sides of the cake and you want like me to have clean sides, you can use a knife and push the drippings up the sides of the cake and spread it all around so as to prevent sauce from dripping again."
