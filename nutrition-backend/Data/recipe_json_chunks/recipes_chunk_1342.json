Place dough on a floured surface then knead with the lift-fold-turn rhythm. Continue adding flour and kneading until dough is no longer tacky. Place dough into an oiled bowl and cover it with plastic wrap. Place in a spot that is a constant 70 degrees and let rise for 2-3 hours.",

      "Prepare the oven by placing a pan in the bottom shelf of the oven with water in it. This will steam the oven and help give the bread its distinctively chewy crust. Also have a spray bottle filled with water on hand.",
      "With a sharp knife slash the top of the loaf diagonally or in a tic-tac-toe design. Place loaves in the oven and spritz them and the sides of the oven with water. At 3 minute intervals for the first 15 minutes spray the loaves and oven. Don't pull the loaves out to do this or you will lose the moist air in the oven. After about 18 minutes remove the pan from the bottom of the oven and close the door. Cook for another 12 minutes more and then remove. Test for doneness by color and by holding it in one hand and thumping the bottom. It should sound slightly hollow. Place the loaves on a cooling rack for 30+ minutes."

Pour the 3 cups (710 ml) of water into the pot to cover the lentils. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, skim any scum that rises to the surface, then lower the heat to maintain a simmer. Add the turmeric and cook until the dal is quite creamy, 45 to 60 minutes. Stir the dal regularly as it simmers or it can catch at the bottom of the pan and burn. If the dal starts to look dry before the lentils are cooked, add hot water (from the tap is fine). Season well with salt.",
      "About 20 minutes before the dal is done, make the tarka. Melt the ghee over low heat. Fry the cumin seeds for maybe 1 minute, until sizzling and fragrant. Add the onion and chile and cook, stirring, until the onion is very soft and translucent, 15 minutes. When the dal is ready, tip the tarka over the dal, stir to partially combine, then sprinkle the cilantro on top. Serve right away with lime wedges and naan or over rice.",
      "Melt 3 tablespoons ghee over low heat, then add 1/2 teaspoon cumin seeds and 1/2 teaspoon fennel seeds. Fry for 1 minute. Add 1 minced onion and 3 minced garlic cloves and cook for 10 minutes, stirring often. Scrape in 1 teaspoon grated ginger and cook to take away some of its rawness, about 1 minute. Stir in 2 small tomatoes that have been diced, 1 or 2 green chiles split lengthwise, and 2 curry leaves (optional). Fry until the tomato starts to break up, 5 to 7 minutes more. Stir most of the mixture into the cooked dal and let simmer for 5 minutes. Check for seasoning, then tip the remaining tarka over the dal. Garnish with chopped cilantro."

Now, add basil and oregano into the chicken stock base lower the flame a little and let it simmer for 5 minutes. It's all about stages and letting the flavors blend. As this is simmering, place the can of crushed plum tomatoes in a blender with one can of cannellini beans and blend to a nice smooth paste. After the 5 minutes is up, pour this paste into the pot and stir. Let this simmer on a low flame for 20 minutes. While this is simmering, open the other 3 cans of beans. 1 can should be left as is with the juice left in the can.

      "1. The tart can be made in a tarte Tatin pan (available in specialty shops), or a 9- to 10-inch (24- to 26-cm) cast-iron skillet (a great pan for this tart), or other heavy, ovenproof skillet. (This is not a recipe that demands extraordinary precision.)",
      "If you've got a pan that is slightly larger or slightly smaller, you can adjust the number of apples by eye as you go along.) Working on a well-floured counter, roll out the puff pastry until it is 1/8 inch (3 mm) thick, then cut out a round that is about 1 inch (2.5 cm) larger in diameter than the pan you'll be using.",
      "Slide the rolled-out dough onto a parchment-lined baking sheet, prick it all over with the tines of a fork or the tip of a paring knife, cover with plastic wrap, and chill until needed. (The dough can remain in the refrigerator for 1 day.)",
      "2. Line a sieve with a single layer of moistened cheesecloth and set the sieve over a bowl. Melt the butter in a small saucepan, then pull the pan from the heat and stir in the tea and vanilla extract. Allow the tea to infuse for 1 minute, then strain the flavored butter into the bowl; discard the tea leaves.",
      "3. Center a rack in the oven and preheat the oven to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and set it aside.",
      "4. Use a pastry brush to cover the sides of the tart pan with some of the vanilla butter, then coat the sides with some of the sugar. Pour the remaining butter into the pan and sprinkle the remaining sugar over the butter. Arrange a single layer of apples, rounded (peeled) side down, in closely packed concentric circles.",
      "The apples will shrink as they cook, so make sure to get as snug a fit as you can. It might be necessary to custom-cut a few of the apple quarters to fill odd spaces. If you want a second layer of apples (a second layer will give you a higher tart), cut the remaining apple quarters lengthwise in half (or peel and core as many additional apples as you need and cut the apples into eighths) and build another layer with them. Don't worry about arranging them neatly-this layer will never be seen.",
      "5. Set the pan over medium heat and cook until the sugar caramelizes to a deep golden brown color, about 20 minutes. (Don't go too far from the stove-you may have to adjust the heat to keep the sugar from burning.) Pull the pan from the heat and place it on the parchment-lined baking sheet.",
      "6. Using a wooden spoon, press down gently on the apples and, if necessary,nudge them a bit to fill any gaps you see. Put the puff pastry circle over the apples, tucking the edges in very loosely.When you tuck, you may have to double the pastry over on itself, and that's OK. It's also OK if some of the pastry overlaps the rim of the pan; it will shrink to the right size as it bakes. Slide the baking sheet into the oven and bake the tart for 30 to 40 minutes, or until the pastry is puffed and, most important, golden.",
      "7. Moving with speed and conviction-this isn't an operation for a timid slowpoke-cover the pan with a large serving plate and invert the tart onto the plate; remove the pan. If any of the apples have stuck to the pan (as some usually will), gently loosen them from the pan with a small metal spatula and reunite them with their companions. Allow the tart to cool for 10 minutes or so before serving, or wait until it is only just warm."

Scrape this rough dough out onto a work surface that has been sprinkled lightly with flour. Knead the dough until it becomes smooth and pulls back when you stretch it, about 5 minutes. If necessary, add just enough flour as you knead to keep the dough from sticking to your hands and the work surface.

Lightly flour the work surface and roll one ball of the dough out with a rolling pin until it will not stretch any further. Drape the circle of dough over both of your fists so the edges of the dough barely overhand your knuckles and gently pull the edges outward while rotating the crust. Keep stretching and rotating the dough gently until the dough is about 9 inches in diameter. Don't worry about a few small tears, they can be repaired once the dough is on the peel.

One at a time, slide the pizzas back onto the pizza stone. Bake until the cheese is golden brown and bubbling and the crust is brown and crispy, 3 to 4 minutes. If your pizza stone is large enough, you may be able to bake the topped pizzas two at a time.",

      "2. Place the ribs in a large nonreactive roasting pan. Pour the cider over the ribs. Squeeze the juice from the lemons over the ribs, catching the seeds with your fingers. Turn the ribs a couple of time to coat all over with marinade. If desired, let the ribs marinate in the refrigerator, covered, for 4 to 6 hours, turning several times.",
      "3. Drain the ribs and blot dry with paper towels. Sprinkle 1/2 cup of the rub on both sides of the ribs, patting it onto the meat with your fingers. Let the ribs stand in the refrigerator, covered, for 1 to 2 hours.",
      "4. Set up the grill for indirect grilling and preheat to medium. If using a charcoal grill, place a large drip pan in the center. If using a gas grill, place all the wood chips in the smoker box or in a smoker pouch and preheat to high until you see smoke, then reduce the heat to medium.",
      "5. When ready to cook, if using charcoal, toss 1 cup of wood chips on the coals. Place the ribs in the center of the hot grate, away from the heat. Cover the grill and cook the ribs for 2 to 3 hours. After 30 minutes, spray the ribs with apple cider and continue to spray every half hour until ready to brush with the sauce. If using a charcoal grill, you'll need to add 12 fresh coals and 1/2 cup wood chips per side after each hour.",
      "6. Lightly brush the ribs with 1 cup of the sauce 20 minutes before the ribs are done. When the ribs are fully cooked, the meat will have shrunk back from the bones about 1/4 inch, and the meat will be tender enough to tear apart with your fingers. But don't overcook; the ribs should have some chew to them. If the ribs start to dry out, wrap them in aluminum foil for the last hour of cooking.",
      "7. Transfer the ribs to plates or a platter. Sprinkle the ribs with the remaining rub and lightly brush again with barbecue sauce. Let the ribs rest for a few minutes, then serve with the remaining barbecue sauce on the side.",
      "You can also cook the ribs in a smoker. Smoke them for 4 to 5 hours at 225\u00b0F",
      "This is a wonderful way to prepare baby back ribs. In this case, you'll need to allow 1 to 1 1/2 hours for indirect grilling or 2 to 3 hours for cooking in a smoker."

You will cover each slice with salt (approx 1/4 tsp on each slice) and let sit for 30 min this will sweat the excess liquid out of the eggplant. Rinse off eggplant and pat dry with towel, beat the two eggs and run eggplant through and then into the crumbs (season as you like if you want to add stuff to it). Fry in oil (I use tongs for flipping) before a flip I use tongs to splash the tops with oil so that the breading does not fall off. After I splash it I let sit like 2 min then flip. Fry both sides and lay out on cookie sheet layered with newspaper and paper towels (removes excess grease this way). Take a rectangle casserole dish lightly cover bottom with sauce, just enough to keep food from sticking. Now layer your casserole as follows: eggplant, sauce, cheese. Keep going in this order until you are done or run out of room. I tend to use a lot of cheese; I cover so I can barely see the sauce. Bake at 350\u00b0 until cheese is melted and starting to brown, of course if you do not like it brown then take out when it's melted the way you like it."

      "Warm the milk in a small saucepan over low heat until it reaches between 100 and 115\u00b0F/38 and 45\u00b0C. Immediately pour the warm milk into the bowl of a stand mixer or a large bowl and sprinkle in the yeast. Add 1 tbsp of the honey, stirring until it is dissolved. Allow the yeast to bloom until it is foamy, 5 to 7 minutes. Add the remaining 2 tbsp of honey, the all-purpose flour, whole-wheat flour, butter, and fine sea salt to the yeast mixture and stir to form a shaggy mass. Attach the bowl and the dough hook to the stand mixer and begin kneading on medium-low speed. After about 1 minute the dough will form a smooth ball. The dough should be quite firm and may be slightly tacky, but not sticky. (If it is sticky, add a little more flour, about 1 tbsp at a time, and knead it in until the dough is smooth. If the dough is too dry to come together, add more water, 1 tsp at a time.) Continue kneading the dough on medium speed until it is elastic, 5 to 7 minutes. Alternatively, turn the shaggy dough out onto an unfloured work surface and knead it by hand.",
      "Choose a bowl that will be large enough to contain the dough after it has doubled in size, and lightly grease it with butter. Transfer the dough to the greased bowl and cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap. Set the dough aside at room temperature (in a warm spot) to rise until it has doubled in size, 1 1/2 to 2 hours.",
      "Line two 12-by-17-in/30.5-by-43-cm rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper; set aside.",
      "Turn the dough out onto an unfloured work surface and press it down to deflate. Cut it into four equal portions, and divide each portion into five small chunks of dough. Work with one piece of dough at a time and keep the rest covered with a damp, clean kitchen towel. Pat a piece of dough down with your fingertips and then roll it up tightly, beginning with a long side, into a cylinder. Shape the dough into a rope 20 in/50 cm long by rolling it against the work surface with your palms, working from the center of the dough to the ends and applying light, even pressure to avoid tapering them. If you need more friction, spray the counter with a little water from a squirt bottle or drizzle a few drops of water and spread it with your hand. It is important that the dough be rolled out to the correct length or it will be too thick to harden while baking. Roll another piece of dough into a rope in this same manner. Twist the two dough ropes together sixteen times, spacing the twists out evenly. Place the twisted dough rope on one of the prepared baking sheets and cover it with a damp towel. Repeat this process with the remaining dough, spacing out the ropes on the baking sheets at least 1 in/2.5 cm apart and covering them with a damp towel.",
      "When the first baking sheet is filled with five twisted ropes, transfer the tray to the refrigerator while you shape the rest of the pretzels to prevent the first batch from overproofing. When all the pretzels are shaped, you will have ten twisted ropes. Place both trays out, covered, at warm room temperature to rise until they have doubled in size, 30 to 40 minutes. (The pretzels can be refrigerated at this point, covered tightly with plastic wrap, for up to 8 hours before dipping and baking them.)",
      "At least 20 minutes before baking, do two things: First, position one rack in the upper third and another rack in the lower third of the oven and preheat it to 325\u00b0F/165\u00b0C/gas 3; second, prepare the boiling water for dipping.",
      "Bring the water to a gentle simmer in a large pot. Just before dipping the pretzels, use a pizza wheel or sharp knife to cut each dough rope into four segments about 5 in/12 cm long. Working in four batches, use a large skimmer to drop the pretzels gently into the water. Leave them in the water for about 20 seconds, carefully turning them once after 10 seconds. Remove the pretzels from the water, drain, and return them to the baking sheets, spacing them out at least 1/2 in/12 mm apart. If the twists unwind, simply retwist them. Repeat with the remaining pretzels. Brush the tops of the pretzels with a light coating of the egg wash and sprinkle them with coarse salt.",
      "Bake the pretzels for 20 minutes, and then rotate the pans from front to back and top to bottom. Continue baking until the pretzels are deeply browned, about 17 to 25 minutes more. Remove the baking sheets from the oven and allow the pretzels to cool to room temperature. Once cooled, test a pretzel for doneness by breaking it in half. If the center is still a little chewy, reduce the oven temperature to 300\u00b0F/150\u00b0C/gas 2 and return the pretzels to the oven to finish hardening to a crisp. This could take anywhere from 10 to 20 minutes more. (Note that if you have some thicker pretzels and some thinner, the thinner ones may be done, while the thicker ones need a little more baking.) Test a pretzel after about 10 minutes, and in 5-minute increments after that. When they are hard, transfer the pretzels to a cooling rack. Once they are completely cooled, store them in an airtight container for up to 2 weeks."

    "ingredients": [],

      "1. An easy way to approach these dishes is to realize that they are all assembled essentially the same way: the onion (salted) is cooked in hot oil until translucent, the wet flavorings are added and cooked for another 2 minutes, the dry spices are added and cooked for 1 minute, and then the wet ingredients and main ingredient are added. The pot is brought to a simmer and cooked until done. Additional seasoning is added at the end, to your liking. 2. That being said, if you are making more than one of the dishes, start by mincing all the onions, grating all the ginger, chopping all the garlic cloves/peppers, and measuring all the spices first. That way, the dishes come together quite quickly, each in its own pot. 3. For example, for the split peas or the red lentils, start by heating the olive oil in a large pot. Add the onion and season with salt, cooking for about 5-6 minutes. Add the garlic and ginger, and cook for another 2 minutes. Introduce the dry spices, and stir for 1 minute. Add the stock/water and either the split peas or lentils, bring to a simmer, and allow to cook for about 40 minutes (or until thick and soft). You may notice that as these dishes cook, too much liquid has evaporated but the peas/lentils are still too firm. If that's the case, just keep adding a bit of additional water until the peas/lentils have softened, and then you can continue to cook off extra liquid to achieve the consistency you like. Each dish will need additional salt when done, and you can add additional ginger/cardamom to the peas or additional berbere to the lentils. 4. For the collard greens, start the same way: cook the salted onions in oil, add the ginger/garlic/pepper, then stock and collard greens (no spices in this one). Cook covered until greens are dark and soft. Uncover and continue cooking to reduce the liquid. 5. Lastly, make the injera. In a large bowl blend the flours and baking soda. Add the club soda and vinegar and whisk into a thin batter (should be much thinner than pancake batter). Heat a large non-stick pan on medium-high heat and spray/coat well with oil. Ladle about 3/4 cup of batter into the pan and quickly shake it around to coat the bottom. Cover and allow to cook through for 2 minutes. Uncover and cook until you can see tiny air bubbles coming through. It should slide right off the pan onto a plate, where you can brush it with a bit of lemon juice. 6. To serve, lay a piece of injera on each plate. Place a serving of each dish on top, and serve with additional pieces of rolled injera on the side."
