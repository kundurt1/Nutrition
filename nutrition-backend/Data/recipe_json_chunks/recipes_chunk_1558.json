Adding the sugar draws out the fruit juices via osmosis. Traditionally, the mixture would be left to ferment into alcohol, then vinegar. Adding vinegar to the fruit syrup is a much quicker and easier way to produce the same thing. Store the shrub in the fridge indefinitely. After a few weeks, you'll find that the flavour of the shrub changes, as the remaining sugar ferments with natural yeasts and turns into alcohol, which in turn ferments into vinegar. Since the advent of refrigeration, shrubs have all but disappeared."

    "title": "homemade peach ice cream",
    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "1. Slice the peaches into eights and place in a blender with the lemon juice and salt. Blend until the mixture is pureed and pour into a medium size saucepan.",
      "2. Bring the mixture to a boil over medium heat and cook for 15 minutes, stirring frequently, to concentrate the flavors. Remove from heat, pour into a bowl and set aside.",
      "3. In a medium mixing bowl, beat the stevia, honey and the egg yolks until they are thickened and pale yellow. Beat in the flour and set aside.",
      "4. In a medium size saucepan, bring the milk to a simmer. Slowly beat the hot milk into the eggs and sugar, pouring it in a thin stream with the mixer running.",
      "5. Pour the entire mixture back into the saucepan and cook over low heat, stirring constantly with a spatula or wooden spoon, until the custard thickens slightly. Do not let the mixture come to a boil.",
      "6. Remove from the heat and pour into a large bowl. Stir in the peach puree, cream, vanilla and lemon extracts.",
      "7. Cover and refrigerate until cold.",
      "8. Freeze the custard in 2 or 3 batches in your ice cream machine, depending on it's capacity, according to the manufacturer's instructions.",
      "Notes: This recipe yields 4 quarts which is too much for the standard 2 quart ice cream maker to handle all at once. You could run it in two successive batches, or (my preference), make one batch and serve it fresh, saving the remaining custard in the refrigerator for the next day. That way you have two days of homemade ice cream! This recipe can also easily be halved.",
      "When I was little, my Uncle told me that ice cream helped you sleep better. Which, of course, is true. I swear. I can't remember a trip to my grandparent's house when they didn't take me out for an ice cream cone or dish up a big bowl of it as a before-bedtime treat. Naturally.",
      "I grew up thinking that ice cream was one of the main food groups. It was a necessity. And homemade ice cream...well, that was one of the very best possible things you could ever make. My grandparents and my parents had the old-fashioned homemade ice cream makers that took bags of salt and ice and was so noisy you could hardly hear yourself think. They would pull it out for special occasions, because what was a birthday without homemade ice cream for heaven's sake?",
      "So, I come by my love of ice cream honestly. And peach ice cream is one of my absolute favorite flavors. Especially when it's homemade with late summer Colorado peaches.",
      "My husband doesn't do well with dairy products and I try to limit the amount of sugar available to all of us without limiting the amount of delicious sweet treats available to all of us. So, this recipe uses almond milk and stevia. Feel free to use regular milk and sugar if you like, but you really can't tell the difference between regular milk and sugar and almond milk and stevia. And it does make this ice cream much better for you. That way you can eat more."

The steam from the water will keep the tops of the cheesecakes from cracking. Then put the pan of cheesecakes into the oven to bake on the top rack for 20 minutes.",

The mixture will be past the transparent clod stage and will be a solid white, but still a little runny.",
      "Once the mix has reached the correct temperature, take off the heat and change to a whisk attachment. Add the cream of tartar. Whisk until the bowl is cool to the touch, 15-20 minutes. You want stiff peaks (when you remove the whisk the peak will be upright and won't droop over).",

    "title": "french toast with brie, strawberries and caramel sauce",
    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "1. Preheat a non-stick skillet over medium heat for about 5 minutes.",
      "2. Meanwhile, using a shallow pan or pie plate, beat egg. Next add melted butter, followed by milk and vanilla. Then add the sugar, flour, spices and salt and whisk until smooth.",
      "3. Soak each slice of bread in the egg mixture for 20-30 seconds, taking care not to over-soak or over saturate bread.",
      "4. Remove bread from bowl, allowing excess egg mixture to drip off and repeat with the remaining slices",
      "5. Add 1 tablespoon of butter to the preheated skillet, and swirl to coat. Add the prepared bread slices in a single layer and allow them to cook. Cook for about 1 minutes and 45 seconds on the first side and about a minute on the second. Remove cooked toast to a plate. Add additional butter to the skillet with each new batch.",
      "6. Plate and serve the toast right away. Serve topped with a few strawberries, and 1-3 thick slabs of slightly melted Brie. Finish by drizzling caramel sauce over the top and sprinkling with powdered sugar.",
      "For the caramel sauce:",
      "1. Place water in a 12\" non-stick skillet or small pot (make sure to use one with a lid), and pour sugar in the center. This is to keep the sugar from crystallizing and burning on the side of the pan. This can't be corrected if it happens, and it negatively impacts the flavor.",
      "2. Put the lid on the pot-this will allow the water that is being evaporated from the boiling process to run back down the side of the pan, helping to ensure no sugar burns on the sides. Turn heat to medium-high and bring to a boil.",
      "3. In a separate pan, heat the cream and salt over low heat. The salt will help to accentuate the caramel flavor. The goal here is not to change the cream in any way (i.e. reduce it, etc.), but rather, just to warm it up so that it can be added to caramel.",
      "4. Once sugar and water mixture begins to boil, remove lid and watch carefully. When the sugar starts turning a golden-brown, turn the heat down to medium, and stir occasionally. Once the sugar begins to turn, it will do so pretty fast, so it's imperative not to walk away from it at this point. The caramel will register 350 F on a candy thermometer when it is done.",
      "5. Remove from heat and add the warm cream to the caramel, a little at a time, whisking as you do. When you add the cream there will be a bubbling reaction that can be quite violent if you add too much cream at once. Never fear though, just whisk it a little and the reaction will subside pretty quickly.",

You want to combine the yolks and sugar, creaming them both together.

If you're adding extract, hold off until the end. Keep stirring over medium heat.",

This is the fun part: begin to check the consistency of your sauce by turning a wooden spoon into it, then lifting the spoon to see if the sauce coats the back of the spoon. This is called \"nappe.\" When you can run a finger through the nappe and it doesn't rush to fill the gap like frantic consumers at a pre-Christmas sale, you're golden.",

      "Begin by soaking the sweet rice in 1 cup of water for about an hour. After the hour is up, don't drain the rice, and add another 3/4 cup of water, plus 1/4 of the can of coconut milk, the salt, and the coconut extract, and 1 tablespoon brown sugar. Bring this to a very gentle boil in the pot, stirring to make sure no rice sticks to the botton. You'll want to start steaming the rice, so partially cover the pot and turn down the heat to a medium-low. Simmer the rice for 20 minutes, until the majority of the water has been absorbed. Be sure to stir to ensure there is no burnt rice on the bottom. After the liquid has been absorbed, remove the rice from the heat and place it to the side, in the pot, with the lid on tight. This will finish steaming the rice, so you'll want to keep it there for about 5-7 minutes.",
      "While the rice is steaming, put the rest of the coconut milk and the remaining 1/4 cup of brown sugar into a pot on the stove. Warm it, adding a pinch of salt, and the vanilla. As it's warming, dissolve the cornstarch in a little water, and add it to the sauce, stirring it until it thickens. You can adjust the sweetness and coconut flavor by adding more sugar or extract if you need. Be sure not to boil the sauce!",
      "To serve, combine the sauce and rice, letting it cool slightly to finish thickening up. Portion onto a plate or into a bowl, then top with freshly sliced mango and some toasted sesame seeds."

Once you have reached the caramel (golden) color, add to the pie pan and swirl until the bottom is covered. The heat from the cake pan will allow you to evenly coat the bottom of your pie pan just before the caramel hardens.",

It will be a little more difficult to tell when the chocolate pastry is fully cooked as you will not be able to see any \"browning\", but 40 minutes for larger or thicker galettes and 30 - 35 minutes for smaller is a good target. When done, remove the pan from the oven..",
      "Once the galettes are removed from the oven, brush the pastry with any remaining melted butter. Let them cool slightly and serve warm with chocolate ice cream, or at room temperature.",

Roll the egg roll and seal the last corner. Lay the flap-side down until ready to cook. (The rolling instructions are usually included on the insert in the package of egg roll wrappers.)",
      "Deep fry at 350 degrees in an electric skillet or deep-fryer, a few at a time, turning occasionally, until golden. Drain standing up on one end, on paper towels, in a baking pan. (This is so that the oil does not pool in the egg rolls.) Serve.",

I always just use whatever I have on hand. If you want to, you can chop the cabbage instead of buying the prepackaged coleslaw mix. I buy the coleslaw mix, because it saves me time. I also usually make 3 or 4 packages of the egg rolls at one time. 1 package contains around 20 egg roll wrappers. (I have NEVER had any leftover egg rolls! These get gobbled up as soon as my family and friends find out that I have them.)"

In a bowl or food processor, pour butter on top of the crushed cookies and add the espresso powder (optional), and mix or pulse well. Place the Oreo mixture at the bottom of a springform pan. Smooth out the mixture with the bottom of a measuring cup or glass. Wrap the bottom of the pan in a double layer of aluminum foil. Place the crust in the freezer while you make the cheesecake.",
      "CHEESECAKE LAYER:",
      "Put a kettle or pot of water on to boil. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees Fahrenheit.",
      "Working in a stand mixer (or large bowl with a hand mixer) preferably fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the cream cheese at medium speed until it is soft for about 4 minutes. With the mixer running, add the sugar and salt, and continue to beat for another 4 minutes or so, until the cream cheese is light. Beat in the vanilla extract. Add the eggs one by one, beating for a full minute after each addition to yield a well-aerated batter. Reduce the mixer speed to low, and stir in the heavy cream or sour cream.",
      "Put the foil-wrapped springform pan in the roaster pan, and pour in a few cups of the hot water in the pan around the springform pan (I do half before putting the cheesecake mixture, to reduce my chances of getting water in the cheesecake and to get everything ready.)",
      "Give the batter a few stirs with a rubber spatula, just to make sure that nothing has been left unmixed at the bottom of the bowl, and scrape the batter into the springform pan. The batter should fill only half of the pan. Put the roasting pan in the oven and pour the rest of the boiling water into the roaster to come halfway up the sides of the springform pan.",
      "Bake the cheesecake for 1 hour and 15-30 minutes, at which point the top will be browned (and perhaps cracked) and may have risen just a little above the rim of the pan. Turn off the oven's heat, and prop the oven door open with a wooden spoon. Allow the cheesecake to luxuriate in its water bath for another hour.",
      "After 1 hour, carefully pull the setup out of the oven, lift the springform pan out of the roaster-be careful, there may be some hot water in the aluminum foil-and remove the foil. Let the cheesecake come to room temperature on a cooling rack.",
      "When the cake is cool, cover the top lightly and chill the cake for at least 4 hours or overnight. Make the mousse once the cheesecake has cooled.",
      "MOUSSE AU CHOCOLAT LAYER:",
      "Place the chocolate and butter in a heatproof bowl, and place over a saucepan containing barely simmering water (or use a double boiler). Melt the chocolate and butter together and stir with a whisk until smooth. Add in the espresso powder. Remove from heat and cool slightly. Add the egg yolks to the chocolate, one at a time, beating with a whisk until incorporated. Set aside.",
      "In another bowl, beat the egg whites until foamy. Add the cream of tartar, and continue to beat. Gradually whisk in 1/4 cup sugar, and continue beating until stiff peaks form.",
      "Beat the heavy cream in a chilled bowl with chilled beaters until it begins to foam and thicken up. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons sugar and vanilla. Continue to whip the cream until it holds soft peaks.",
      "Gradually and gently fold the egg whites into the chocolate mixture to lighten it. Then, delicately fold in the whipped cream. Take care not overwork the mousse but make sure you blend in the cream well. Place the mousse on top of the cooled cheesecake while still in the springform pan. Cover the cheesecake with foil, being careful to not let the foil touch the mousse. If your springform is too small for this, just use less mousse in the cheesecake and instead eat them in ramekins while you prepare the ganache!",
      "GANACHE LAYER:",
      "Heat the cream in a small sauce pan over medium heat. Heat it up just BEFORE it boils. Place the chocolate in the cream, and remove from heat. Stir the mixture until smooth. Stir in the espresso powder and rum or vanilla extract. Allow the ganache to cool for about 15 minutes before pouring the mixture on top of the mousse cheesecake.",
      "Release the springform pan. With an offset spatula, smooth the ganache while starting at the center of the cake and working outward. (I did a \"crumb\" crust by placing a thin layer of the warm ganache on top, allowed it to cool in the freezer for 30 minutes, then I poured more on the cheesecake after releasing the springfrom pan so that it could pour down the cake.) Don't do exactly what I did, though. Just pour ganache on top once it has cooled. Keep in mind that the cold temperature of the cake will cause the ganache to firm up quickly, and you may have to pour more on top.",
      "Save the rest of the ganache for decorations (if you whip the ganache when it's cold, you can pipe a beautiful decoration) or save it for something else.",

Grate in the frozen butter (or cut it in with a pastry cutter until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. I find grating faster and easier). Mix it together gently. Pour in the buttermilk and stir until the dough starts to come together. It will be very shaggy with lots of loose bits and flour, that's okay.",

With lightly floured hands, shape the dough into a rough rectangle, about one inch thick. Lift one end up and fold it in half. It will fall apart, but just pick up all the bits and pieces and put them on top. Turn the dough a quarter turn and press it out into a one inch thick rectangle again. Repeat this folding and turning process 5-6 times, at which point your dough will be more cohesive, and not crumbling all over the place anymore. Add a bit more flour underneath and on your hands if it gets too sticky.",

I usually cut them into squares as it's faster and there are no scraps to reshape then, but if you prefer circles go for it!",

I almost always sub whole wheat flour for half of the all-purpose flour, although when I want a real treat I stick with all all-purpose, they are a bit lighter that way. Also, frozen butter IS better as they get flakier when the butter is frozen, but I generally do not plan far enough ahead to stick the butter in the freezer so then I make them with butter that is cold from the fridge. I grate it in quickly and they are still amazing that way so don't decide not to make them because the butter isn't frozen! I've also made them many times with DIY buttermilk (1 cup of milk mixed with 1 tablespoon vinegar) and that works fine too, although I do use real buttermilk when I have it!"

With a short side facing you, place the butter/flour mixture on the lower half, leaving a 1/2-inch border on all sides. Fold over the upper half to cover the butter and press the edges together to seal. Then, with a folded side to your left, roll out the dough into a 10-by-24-inch rectangle. With a short side facing you, fold the bottom third up, then fold the top third down, as if folding a letter. This completes the first turn. Return dough to the pan, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for 45 minutes.",

      "When you make your gumbo you need to know what differences there are in roux. There are three classic kinds of roux, named for their color: white, blond and brown.",
      "White roux is cooked for just a few minutes, long enough to get rid of the floury taste. It's used for cream soups and bechamel sauces (cream sauces).",
      "For blond roux, cook the white roux a little longer, and it takes on a straw color. This blond roux has a hint of flavor and adds a warm color to veloute sauces (sauces made with chicken, fish or veal stock).",
      "A brown roux has a nutty aroma and a rich, chocolate color that works well in dark soups and demi-glace (brown) sauces.",
      "Dark brown roux is a deeper mahogany, almost black, color roux that is used more for its nutty flavor than its thickening capabilities. White and blond roux use butter as fat. Use olive oil in the darker roux because it produces a better color.",
      "Now that we've got that out of the way, let's start. In this case I want a dark roux for a gumbo without fish. Note that the amounts listed above for the roux will yield more than what you will need for this recipe. You can store the extra roux (see below).",
      "I make the roux ahead of time. Roux can be made up to two weeks in advance and stored in the refrigerator. Making a bigger batch of roux helps control the quality with less chance of burning.",
      "The trick to making a dark roux is to brown it without burning it. That means you've got to keep stirring.",
      "To make the dark brown roux, turn the stove on medium high heat. Add to your cast iron skillet the oil, then add the flour. Keep stirring till it reaches the desired color, in this case I want it to be dark brown. This will take about 20 minutes. You can, and I suggest you do, make the roux ahead of time so it won't take you that long to make the Gumbo.",
      "Put the stove on medium high and add the following to the pot: 1/2 cup dark brown roux, the minced onion, diced green pepper, and diced celery. Cook for 5 minutes, then add the diced Roma tomatoes and chicken broth (you can use the kind out of the box if you like). Add the sliced okra and the black and white pepper. Simmer for 20 minutes; the vegetables should be done.",
      "In the meantime saute the sliced Polish sausage in the oil (the original gumbo is made with Andouille sausage but I prefer the Polish sausage), and shredded cooked chicken. Brown the meat on medium high for 5 minutes. Add this all to the pot with the roux and bring to a boil. Simmer for 5 minutes. Remove from heat and serve in a bowl with rice and a dash of the file powder."

      "To get the broth going, parboil the bones. (Parboiling the bones is optional. I like to, because it rids the bones/marrow of impurities. You can, of course, skim the scum off the top of the water as it boils, but I like to be thorough.) Toss the beef bones into a large pot. Cover the bones with cold water, then place the pot onto high heat, bringing the water to a boil. Boil for 3 to 5 minutes. During this time, impurities and foam will be released and rise to the top.",
      "Drain the bones, discarding the water. Rinse the bones with warm water and scrub the stockpot to remove any residue that has stuck to the sides. Put the bones back into the stockpot, and cover with 6 quarts of cold water. Bring the water to a rolling boil, and then bring it down to a gentle simmer.",
      "Place an oven rack to a high position, then turn the broiler to high. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and place the quartered onions and halved ginger onto the baking sheet. Broil for 10 to 15 minutes, turning onions and ginger occasionally so that they become charred or browned on all sides. Keep an eye on them.",
      "In the meantime, toast the spices. Add the cinnamon sticks, coriander seeds, fennel seeds, star anise, cloves and the black cardamom pod (if you've got it) to a dry frying pan on low heat. Cook, stirring occasionally until fragrant, approximately 5 minutes.",
      "Place the toasted spices into a cotton muslin bag/herb sachet or cheesecloth, and then tie with butchers twine to seal. If you don't have any of the aforementioned, you can empty out a regular tea bag by cutting a small hole into it, and placing the spices inside. Then, just gently tuck the tea bag where you made the incision. Sure, some spices may escape, but it's better than having to fish for all of them in the end.",
      "Add the charred onion, ginger, and the bag or sachet of toasted spices to the stockpot. Then add sea salt, fish sauce (see note below), and the rock sugar, if you have it. Allow your broth to simmer for 3 hours. If at any time foam or scum rises to the surface, use a spoon to remove it.",
      "After 3 hours have passed, use tongs or a wide mesh spoon to remove the bones, onion and ginger from the broth. Strain the broth through a fine mesh strainer, then add the sliced scallions to the broth. This is optional, but man do I love me some scallions.",
      "The broth will have a layer of fat at the the top. There are two ways to remove this. First, if you plan to enjoy the broth now, skim the fat from the top of the broth using a spoon. If you do not mind waiting, you can also pour broth into containers and refrigerate overnight. As the broth cools, the fat will solidify, making it very easy to remove.",
      "To assemble the bowls, heat the broth to a gentle simmer over medium heat (if re-heating). Prepare the noodles according to the instructions on the package. Most Pho recipes I've encountered have instructed people to put slices of raw beef into their soup. I didn't have access to that quality of beef, so I cooked mine to a nice medium rare.",
      "Garnish with sliced scallions, chilis, Thai basil, lime, bean sprouts, and well, cilantro if you're into that. Add a dash of fish sauce and serve with hoisin sauce on the side.",
      "Note: I've read that the best fish sauce to use is one that comes in a glass bottle and can be purchased for around $4-$6. Quality is key.",

      "In a large bowl, stir together the all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, yeast and salt. Add the water (make sure it's very warm, but not hot to the touch). I generally don't check the temperature, as long as you can stick your finger in comfortably it will be fine, but you can check the temperature if you're nervous about killing the yeast!",
      "Stir everything together with a wooden spoon or dough whisk until all of the flour is hydrated. There should not be any dry pieces left at all. This will take a couple of minutes of stirring. Once all the flour is mixed in, you will have a rather shaggy mass of dough in the bowl. Cover this tightly with plastic wrap and let it rise for 2 hours, or until the dough has doubled in size.",
      "Prepare a 9x13 inch pan by brushing 1 tablespoon of olive oil over the bottom and sides. In a small bowl, stir together the remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil with the room temp water and kosher salt.",
      "Once the dough has doubled in size, sprinkle a bit of flour over the dough, just so it isn't as sticky and you can handle it a bit. Turn it over a couple times in the bowl with floured hands so that you have a lightly floured ball of dough, but without kneading it and removing all the air bubbles. You want to handle this dough gently and just use enough flour so you can move the dough around without having it stuck all over your hands.",
      "Move the dough to the prepared baking pan and press it out with your hands to fill the pan. It may not quite reach the edges everywhere or be a perfect rectangle. That's okay. Brush the olive oil and salt mixture over the top of the bread, making sure to use all of it, and then sprinkle the top with rosemary. Cover the pan with plastic wrap or a clean towel and let it rest for 45 minutes.",
      "Preheat the oven to 450 F. When the dough has rested, uncover it, place the pan into the hot oven, and bake for 25-27 minutes until it is golden brown. Remove pan from oven. Let bread cool in the pan for couple of minutes and then lift it out to cool on a wire rack. Serve warm with olive oil and balsamic vinegar, or just plain if you prefer!",
      "Note: This bread is great right out of the oven with olive oil and balsamic vinegar, or even plain. The salty olive oil brushed crust is delicious without anything else added to it. Leftovers are great for sandwiches or panini's if you have any left! Also, this recipe can be easily halved to fit in a 9x9 inch pan, or doubled to do two pans of bread. Or, you can double it, use 1/4 to 1/2 of the dough to bake immediately, and store the remainder in the fridge for up to a week. When you're ready to bake it simply take it out and allow it to come to room temperature (about 2-3 hours) and then continue with the shaping and baking instructions.",

      "7. Place pan into oven, on the center rack, and bake for about 25-27 minutes, turning pan around halfway through baking to ensure even browning. Bars are done when the center has puffed and the entire surface is a nice light amber brown color. Remove dish from oven.",
      "8. Let bars completely cool in the pan before trying to remove them. Once cool, simply use the little overhang of parchment to pull the entire thing out of pan. You can also chill the entire pan in the fridge, once cool to the touch, until totally cold for super easy cutting and slicing.",
      "9. Once you're ready to slice, peel back parchment paper and with a large, sharp knife cut bars into as many or few servings as you'd like! I got 18 bars (6 across, 3 down) with one pan. Can easily be cut smaller if need be.",
      "Serve bars room temperature for best flavor! You can also make dough ahead of time, press into pan and wrap in plastic wrap to freeze for a later date.

Allow the bars to come to room temperature before serving.",

Heat the ingredients until butter is just melted and the mixture is uniform with no oily parts of unincorporated melted butter. Try not to let it bubble as this will contribute to the topping hardening later. Pour the mixture into a 9\" x 12\" cake pan or two 9-inch round cake pans. Set the pan or pans aside.",

Pour in the melted butter and mix vigorously until you get a thick sticky dough. Slowly add more flour and stir with the wooden spoon. When it becomes very difficult to use the spoon, start using your hands to mix the flour in while the dough is still in the bowl. When it becomes less sticky, turn the dough out onto a well floured surfaced and knead the remaining flour into the dough as directed in the main instructions."

      "Important! Ensure all ingredients are ready to go in the pot before starting. Sugar cooks very quickly and burnt sugar tastes horrible (it smells even worse).",
      "1) Heat sugar on high heat in a heavy-bottomed 3-quart saucepan (adding butter and cream causes sugar to bubble up pretty high, so you need high sides for making caramel).",
      "2) Stir constantly with a whisk until all the crystals have melted and the liquid is a nice amber color. Immediately add in the butter. Whisk vigorously until the butter is melted.",
      "3) When the butter is melted, remove the pan from the heat and add cream (it will foam up quite a bit; don't worry this is supposed to happen).",
      "4) Whisk until caramel is smooth. Let cool 2-3 minutes in pan and pour into a glass container to store. Make sure caramel sauce comes to room temperature before storing in fridge. Stores in the fridge for up to 2 weeks.",
      "Cream Filling:",
      "Make sure you have a rimmed baking sheet set aside to cool your filling.",

      "3) In a saucepan over medium-high heat, combine the milk and remaining sugar. Heat and stir until the milk begins to steam.",
      "4) Pour half of the hot milk into a measuring cup. While whisking the egg mixture, slowly pour the hot milk (from the measuring cup) into the egg mixture and whisk till smooth.",
      "5) Pour the combined mixture back into the saucepan with the remaining hot milk (this is to prevent the egg from cooking) and bring to a boil, still whisking to prevent scorching; you will have some great wrists and forearms after all this!",
      "6) Remove from heat. Stir in butter and extracts.",
      "7) Transfer the pastry cream to the baking sheet and spread in a thin layer. Cover the entire surface with plastic wrap, pressing the wrap into the surface of the cream (smooth out as many air bubbles as you can). Then put into refrigerator and chill for about 15 minutes. Use immediately or store in airtight container up to 3 days.",
      "Eclair Pastry (the end is near I promise):",
      "Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper.",
      "1) Heat the water, salt, sugar, and butter until the butter melts. Bring to a boil and remove from heat.",
      "2) Immediately add the flour and stir quickly with a wooden spoon, until smooth.",
      "3) Set the mixture over low heat and stir constantly for 4 minutes. Remove and allow to cool for 3-4 minutes.",
      "4) Add 1 egg and beat it thoroughly into the mixture. Add 3 more eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition.",
      "5) Beat the 5th egg in a small bowl. Add this egg little by little, beating in between, until the dough becomes shiny and forms a string (by touching the batter with a finger and lifting away; a string should form). If it does not form a string when all of the egg has been added, add water 1 teaspoon at a time until it tests with a string.",
      "6) Fit a pastry bag with 1/2 inch tip, fill with dough and pipe thick fingers of dough about 3 inches long. Dip a fork in water and lightly make crisscrosses on each finger.",
      "7) Bake about 10 minutes at 425 and then reduce to 350 degrees F. Bake for 25-30 minutes. Turn off oven and prop door open slightly. Allow the eclairs to stay in oven for 15 minutes. Transfer to wire rack.",
      "If serving immediately, fill while warm. If you are waiting to serve them, use a skewer or chopstick (that's what I have) and poke a hole in one end. Wiggle little to allow room to fill with pastry cream. And then don't fill it until you are ready to serve it.",
      "Putting it together:",
      "1) Remove pastry cream from refrigerator and stir to soften.",
      "2) Fit a pastry bag with a tip small enough to fit in the hole you made in the pastry. Fill bag with cream filling. Fill each pastry finger with cream.",
      "3) Remove caramel sauce from fridge and warm to allow for easy dipping.",
      "4) Dip the tops of each finger into the caramel sauce. Let excess drip off before turning over and dipping the next one.",
      "Once all the fingers are dipped, sit back, take a deep breath, admire the beauty of all your hard work...then ENJOY!"

Cover the pan with plastic wrap and place in the freezer for 15 minutes.",

Mix on low to break down the cream cheese for 30 seconds, and increase to medium speed for another 1 minute. Scrape the sides of the bowl and add sour cream, whipping cream, Greek yogurt and vanilla extract. Mix on medium for 30 seconds, scrape the sides, and then up the speed to medium-high for 2 minutes, until smooth and fluffy.",

You can tear out the sides of the aluminum foil or carefully slide it side to side to unstick it from the crust, and remove. To smooth the sides of the cake, slide the smooth edge of a table knife around it to create a smooth even surface. Pour your topping/s of choice before serving.

Knox is the only gelatin my family has used for cheesecakes since I was a child because it just works beautifully with this recipe. I've always stood by Fage brand Greek Yogurt as a cooking/baking yogurt, and so far I have not found a better substitute for it. (We are not affiliated with either brand.)",
      "This cheesecake will be nice and sturdy and will hold its shape for travel the next day (in case you are bringing it to a party). However, if you want the cheesecake sturdy fast (in 2 hours or less, by putting it in the freezer for 30 minutes or by putting it in the fridge for an hour), decrease the sour cream and yogurt by 1/4 cup each. Please remember that if you make the cheesecake this way, you need to consume it the same day or it will look and feel almost rubbery the next day. This is just the quick method in case you are in a hurry. The long method is ideal in texture and taste.",

      "5. Whisk all dry ingredients together well (cake flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt) and set aside.",
      "6. Add in softened butter and coconut oil. Mix with electric mixer until combined. Do not overbeat.",
      "7. Whisk together eggs, egg yolks, buttermilk, and extracts. Add in three parts to the flour mixture and beat on medium for approximately 2 minutes.",
      "8. Whip heavy cream to soft peaks. Gently fold into cake batter.",
      "9. Pour batter evenly into prepared pans, about 1 1/3 cups in each pan. Smooth with a spatula and lightly tap on the counter to release any air bubbles.",
      "10. Bake for 10-15 minutes (do not overcook). Set on a wire rack to cool for 10 minutes before turning out and returning to the wire rack.",

      "13. Whip the topping ingredients until the cream reaches stiff peaks. Spread evenly across the top layer and garnish with fresh raspberries.",
      "Notes:",
      "1. I only used the icing between the layers. If you want it to spread on the sides and top as well, you will need to double the icing ingredients.",
      "2. This cake only improves with age. I prefer to make it ahead, leaving off the whipped topping. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate until about 1 hour before serving. Top with whipped cream and garnish with raspberries and flaked coconut before serving.",
      "3. Obviously, these are large pieces of cake! They will need to be sliced large enough so that the layers remain together but not so thick as you might normally serve.",

      "1. A double boiler or a homemade bain-marie made with a bowl that fits inside the rim of a pot partially filled with water.",
      "2. A mixer, standing or hand.",
      "3. Eight 1/2-cup size ramekins.",

      "5. Kitchen string.",

      "2. In a large bowl beat the eggs and sugar together until they form a thick, pale lemon-ey yellow mixture.",
      "3. Mix in the powdered almonds, then the flour, salt, and finally, the melted chocolate and butter and the vanilla. (The batter may be made up to this point in the morning, covered and set aside at a cool room temperature or in the refrigerator, to be baked in the evening. Bring it to room temperature before baking if it is refrigerated.",
      "For assembling and baking the 'beggar's purses':",
      "The dessert bakes for exactly 12 minutes and rests for 5 minutes. It can't be made in advance, but guests generally like a break before dessert-nor will they mind waiting a little for this one. If you are using the optional dark chocolate sauce, you need to make it in advance and reheat it a little before decorating the desserts and putting the (optional) ice cream with it. The instructions for the chocolate sauce are at the end of this recipe. So if you want to make it, then skip to the bottom and prepare it before baking the cakes. Now back to the cakes ...",
      "1. Preheat the oven to 425 F. Butter the ramekins and line the bottom of each one with a round of parchment paper.",
      "2. For each ramekin: Center a crepe over the ramekin and press it down into it. Using crepes with an 8-9 inch diameter, there will be a broad circular band of overhang. (See the photos on the related link.)",
      "3. Divide the cake batter among the crepe-lined ramekins.",
      "4. Gather up the overhanging border of each crepe, bunch it together in overlapping folds, and tie the folds together with a piece of kitchen string, as though the string were the drawstring of an alms purse. (Looking at the photo illustration on the related link might be helpful for visualizing this step.)",
      "5. Bake the ramekins for exactly 12 minutes. (During this time, gently reheat the chocolate sauce if you're using it.)",
      "6. Remove the ramekins from the oven and let the 'purses' sit (still in the ramekins) for 5 minutes. Remove the strings.",
      "7. Swirl some chocolate sauce onto each dessert plate, if you like. Then, gently tip each ramekin sidewise and slip the beggar's purses onto the chocolate-decorated plates.",
      "8. Optional suggestions: Place a small scoop of vanilla ice cream next to each purse, drizzle some more chocolate sauce on the ice cream, sift some cocoa powder over each plate and, decorate the desserts with berries.",
      "For the optional dark chocolate sauce:",
      "1. Place the chocolate, milk and cream in the top of a double boiler or a homemade bain-marie (with water in the bottom pot) and melt the chocolate slowly over low heat, stirring.",
      "2. Add the frozen butter, a few pieces at a time and stir until melted.",
      "3. Add the vanilla and set the sauce aside off of the heat until you unmold the baked desserts and put them on plates. Reheat the sauce briefly before using it. Any leftover sauce keeps well, refrigerated, for many weeks.",
      "An Acknowledgement: The recipe for Dark Chocolate Sauce is adapted from one in 'The Dione Lucas Book of French Cooking (1973). The diplomatickitchen came across this recipe for Moelleux au chocolat en aumonieres on a blog which has since vanished without a trace."

      "1. To make the pastry cream, combine pudding mix, heavy cream, and 1/2 cup milk in a bowl. Place in the fridge to set.",
      "2. Preheat oven to 425 F. Line 2 baking sheets with silicone mats or parchment paper.",
      "3. Bring the remaining 1/4 cup milk, water, 4 tablespoons butter, sugar, and salt to a rapid boil in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Once it boils, add all the flour at once, lower the heat to medium-low, and immediately start stirring with a heavy wooden spoon. The dough will come together, and a light crust will form on the bottom of the saucepan. Continue stirring for another minute or two to dry the dough. The dough should be very smooth. Remove from heat.",
      "4. Turn the dough into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment (a hand-mixer can also be used). Let the dough sit for a minute to cool down, then add the eggs one by one, beating thoroughly after each addition. (Tip: if you forgot to bring your eggs to room temperature before beginning the recipe, warm up some water in a Tupperware container (or bowl) for 60 seconds or until very warm. Add eggs. and they should be room temperature within 15 minutes.) Also, don't worry if the dough falls apart at first; keep beating, and it will all come together.",
      "5. Using about 1 tablespoon of dough for each puff, drop the dough from a spoon onto the lined baking sheet, leaving about 2 inches between the mounds of dough.",
      "6. Slide the baking sheets into the oven and immediately turn down the oven to 375 F. Bake for 12 minutes, then rotate the pan around and bake for another 12-15 minutes, or until the puffs are golden and firm. Take them out of the oven and allow to cool on a baking sheet.",
      "7. To assemble: Take the chilled pastry cream out of the refrigerator and place into a pastry bag or a large Ziploc bag. If using a Ziploc bag, simply cut off the tip of the edge of the bag. To fill the puffs; using a serrated knife and a gentle sawing motion, cut off the top quarter or third of the puff, fill the puffs with the cream, and top them with the little caps.",
      "8. To make the chocolate glaze: Melt the chocolate and remaining 1 tablespoon of butter in a medium saucepan over low heat. Stir in powdered sugar and vanilla. Stir in hot water, a little at a time, and whisk until it gets to the correct drizzling consistency. Remove from heat, cool slightly, and drizzle onto each puff. Cool in fridge until pastries are cold and glaze has set. Enjoy!",

To easily get that donut batter into your donut pans you can either fit a piping bag with a large circular piping tip (I used a Magic Tip 9pt sized tip) or use a gallon-sized Ziplock bag with one of the corners snipped off. Either way, fill that bag and pipe batter into your pans so that they are 3/4 of the way full.",
      "5. Put pan in the center rack of your oven and bake for about 9 minutes (no longer), turning pan around halfway through baking to ensure even cooking and browning. Donuts are done when they have puffed, the tops spring back slightly when touched and are golden brown around edges and bottom. Please note: the tops (which will be the bottoms) will not turn golden brown. If they do, you risk over baking your donuts. Remove pan from oven.",
      "6. Let donuts cool in pan for 5 minutes before removing and allowing them to cool completely on a wire rack. Donuts need to be completely cooled before they can be dipped and glazed.",
      "For the glaze:",
      "1. While the donuts are cooling, add your jam and milk into a small (preferably non-stick) saucepan. Heat over a low flame, stirring occasionally, until the mixture has melted completely. Do not boil. Remove from heat and allow to cool slightly.",
      "2. In a medium sized bowl, add your sifted powdered sugar. Pour your cooled milk and jam mixture into the bowl and whisk until combined very well. There should be no lumps.",
      "3. Once donuts are cool, flip them over so you are dipping the browned side into the glaze. Dip top half only, one at a time into the glaze, twisting so the glaze really sticks to each. Carefully lift it up and place it back on the rack (with glaze side up) to allow the glaze to set up. Glaze should be thin enough to coat entire top of donut but thick enough to not slide down sides. If need be, dip again once glaze sets up. Depending on the brand of the jam you used, you may need to thin out the glaze with more milk or thicken it up with more powdered sugar. You want the glaze to be a like a slightly thin pancake batter. Let glaze set up 5 minutes before eating or re-dipping.",

Place the skewers on the grill, turning them by a quarter once every 5 minutes. Use the remaining dressing to baste during the grilling time, as needed. Remove skewers from the grill, and serve immediately!",

I keep a lot of these ingredients in the freezer (limes leaves, galangal, lemon grass, even ginger). When I make this, I always double the recipe, therefore adding a full can of coconut milk.

Place the mixture into a greased bowl, cover with a damp towel. Let rise for about an hour. Since the dough is very tacky, I actually place it in the refrigerator for an hour so that it will be easier to roll.",
      "Generously flour a flat surface, knead the dough, and roll the dough into a rectangle about 12x18. Spread the filling over the dough and roll the dough like a jelly roll. Pinch the seams. Place into a greased tube pan. Let it rest for about an hour and half, covered so that it may rise. Bake in a preheated 350 degrees oven for 35-40 minutes until browned. Remove from the oven and sprinkle with powdered sugar."
