Cut the leeks and garlic in half lengthwise, then chop crosswise into 1/4- to 1/2-inch (6- to 12-mm) pieces. You should have about 2 cups (180 g). If using large leeks and mature garlic, cut the white part of each leek into the same-size pieces and mince the garlic.",
      "In a 12-inch (30.5-cm) skillet, heat 1 tablespoon each of the butter and olive oil over medium heat. Add the leeks and garlic, season with salt and pepper, and reduce the heat to medium-low. Cook uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the colors brighten, about 3 minutes. Cover and continue to cook, stirring occasionally and reducing the heat as needed to prevent browning, until very tender, 7 to 8 minutes. Transfer the mixture to a bowl and set aside. Reserve the skillet.",
      "Break the matzo sheets into small pieces into a medium bowl and pour in water to cover. In another medium bowl, whisk together the eggs, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and a few grinds of pepper until the eggs are well blended. Drain the matzos (don't be too fussy; just tilt the bowl to pour off the excess water, using your hand to prevent them from tumbling out). Stir the egg and leek mixtures into the matzos.",
      "Reheat the skillet with the remaining 1 tablespoon each butter and oil over medium heat. The pan is hot enough when a bit of matzo mixture dropped into it sizzles on contact. Pour in the matzo brei batter and smooth the top and edges. Cook, reducing the heat to medium-low as needed to prevent scorching, until the underside is set and golden, about 5 minutes.",
      "Use the edge of a pancake turner or spatula to cut the matzo brei into 6 wedges. Flip each wedge, rotating the pan as you go so that the pieces fit back into the pan nicely. Continue to cook until the matzo brei is cooked through but not dry, about 3 minutes more. (If you must add more fat to the pan during cooking, tilt the pan, add the fat to the side of the pan still resting on the burner, and hold the pan at this angle for a moment to heat the fat. Then, use your spatula to lift the edge of the matzo brei and tilt the pan in the opposite direction to let the warmed fat run under the matzo brei before you set the pan back squarely on the burner to finish cooking.)",
      "Place a wedge of matzo brei on each plate. Drape each wedge with salmon, top with a spoonful or two of horseradish cream, and shower with dill. Use a five-hole zester to zest long strands of lemon peel over each serving and add a squeeze of lemon."

Walk away and do something else, let everything get nice and seared before stirring. When everything starts to soften and brown, add the tomato paste and season with sugar, cumin, tumeric, paprika, salt, and curry powder. Let simmer on medium heat about 15 minutes, covered. The longer it simmers the better. Finally, throw everything in the blender, in batches if neccessary, and set aside. Add the vinegar and strain until desired consistency is reached."

      "Saute and season mushrooms with little oil and finely chop and slightly wilt the greens of your choosing via steaming, microwave, etc. Chop garlic and shallots fine and mix with horseradish, adding to the ground meat with the binding and wine and/or worcestershire sauce. Season and partition into 4 patties, 2 of which slightly broader than the other 2. Top the smaller patties with a sensible amount of wilted greens and cheese. move the stuffing mixture onto the broader patties and top with the smaller ones, folding the brims of the broader patty upward to seal in the stuffing - make sure the seal is good, but take care not to overwork the patties. Slightly oil and season again. Grill or pan sear to desired doneness, making sure to start with high heat the first 30 seconds to char a seal in the meat, to lock in moisture and the stuffing. Top with sauteed mushrooms and whatever else you take on your burger. Enjoy!"

Pulse about seven times, or until the mixture looks like sand. You can also do this by hand in a large bowl with two knives or a pastry cutter. Add 1 egg yolk, the vanilla, orange blossom water, if using, and the tablespoon of cold water. Process or mix just until the dough comes together.",

Using the tines of a fork, make one set of lines straight across the top of the cookie. Make another set about 2 inches below the first. Repeat until you have four to five sets of lines. Now slide the parchment a quarter turn to the right and make four to five additional sets of lines, each about 2 inches apart. The new set of lines should cross the first set of lines on an angle, creating a diamond-shaped grid.",

Remove from the oven and immediately cut the cookie into 8 or 12 large wedges or about eighteen 1 x 3-inch bars, if you like. If you wait until the cookie cools to cut it, you will not get nice clean edges."

When the liquid starts to boil, bring the temperature down so that the soup barely simmers. During the simmering, remove the foam as it collects. When the foam stops collecting, cover the pot(leave only a small opening) and simmer the soup for about 90 to 120 minutes. Slice the onion in half and broil it in dry pan(no oil!) for 30 seconds or so to get some color and then stick it with the cloves and bay leaf. Add all the ingredients into the pot except the small bunch of parsley greens and salt. Simmer half covered for another 60 to 90 minutes. Add salt to your taste 10 minutes before the end of cooking. Leave the soup standing for 10 minutes so it calms down and clears up. Use fine mesh colander to strain the soup. If too much fat accumulates on the top, remove some. Chop the small bunch of parsley greens. Serve with noodles - the smaller the better and chopped parsley greens on top. You can also chop some chives. If you wish, during simmering, add a few small pieces of orange peel. It'll give the soup even better taste. Just before the end of cooking, you can also add one or two tablespoons of brandy. The coocked vegetables can be cut and added to the soup. meat also. Improvise and enjoy."

When melted, add onions, thyme and 3/4 teaspoon salt. Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, about 25 minutes in all. At first the onions will be very moist, but after 10 minutes their water will have cooked off and they'll begin to color. They needn't be caramelized, but just take on a faint golden hue. When done, let them cool slightly. Taste for salt - they'll be very sweet so you might want to add more - and season well with pepper.",

Add 6 tablespoons butter and turn mixer to low speed until butter has broken into small, pebble-size pieces. Drizzle in ice water until dough looks clumpy and damp. (You'll use about 3 tablespoons or less if the butter was soft.) Form dough into a disk or a rectangle to correspond to the shape pan you're using. You have a few choices: a 9-inch tart pan, a square tart pan, or a rectangular one (11 x 8 1/2 inches), all with removable bottoms. Wrap dough in plastic and refrigerate.",

    "directions": [
      "Shortbread Tarts: Lightly butter, or spray with a nonstick vegetable spray, 36 miniature muffin tins (approximately 2 inch (5 cm) in diameter). Set aside. Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (170 degrees C) and place rack in the center of the oven. In the bowl of your electric mixer, or with a hand mixer, cream the butter and sugar together (approximately two minutes). Beat in the vanilla extract . Add the flour, cornstarch and salt and mix just until incorporated. Divide the dough into 36 even pieces and place one ball of dough in the center of each muffin tin. With your fingertips, press the dough up the sides of the individual muffin tin so there is an indentation in the center. Once filled, place the tart pan, with the unbaked shells, in the freezer for about 10 minutes so the shortbread can become firm. (This will help to prevent the shortbread from puffing up during baking.) Bake for approximately 18 - 20 minutes or until lightly browned. About halfway through the baking time, lightly prick the bottom of each shortbread, with the tines of a fork, if they have puffed up. Check again after another five minutes and prick again if needed. Once they are fully baked, remove from oven and place on a wire rack to cool. When completely cooled, remove the tarts from the pan. (These may be made in large quantities and frozen.)",
      "CREAM CHEESE FILLING: In your food processor or electric mixer, beat the cream cheese until fluffy. Add the condensed milk, lemon juice, zest, and vanilla and process until smooth. Transfer the filling to a bowl, cover, and refrigerate until serving time. It is best to make the filling at least a day in advance to give it time to become firm and for all the flavors to mingle."
