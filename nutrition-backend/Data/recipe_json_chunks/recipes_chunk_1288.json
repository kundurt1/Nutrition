You can cover with plastic wrap and put in the refrigerator for up to 2 days at this stage. When you are ready to stuff the turkey breast, take the bowl of sausage meat out of the refrigerator.",

Spread the stuffing out first in the slight cavity in the center of the butterfly and then outward onto the wings though not going right up to the edge (or it will squidge out when cooking) but as evenly as possible over the whole joint.",
      "Carefully, in one swift but steady movement, fold one \"wing\" over the other to close the joint, and then sit the turkey in a large roasting pan, breast bone (or where the breast bone would be) on top as it would look were it the whole bird, with the pointier bit farthest away from you. Thread 2 skewers through the base-i.e., the widest part that is nearer you-to keep it closed, and smear it all over with the duck or goose fat.",
      "Roast the turkey breast for 2-2 1/2 hours, then check it is cooked with a turkey or meat thermometer. When cooked, it should read 165\u00b0F in the center. (If you're leaving it to rest, as you should, or to cool, you could take it out at 160\u00b0F-it will retain heat and continue to cook for a short while once out of the oven.)",
      "Flex your muscles, then lift out onto a cutting board, and leave to rest for at least 20 minutes. Or leave to get cold if you are eating it as part of a cook-ahead buffet.",
      "Cut through the whole joint in wide slices right across; they will need to be quite thick, at least 1/2 inch, maybe 1 inch, to keep the stuffing intact within the slice.",
      "As you place it on table or sideboard, dot around it the condiments of your choice: I revert to Christmas in Italy here by putting a lusciously extravagant pot or two of Italian mostarda di Cremona on the table alongside: this is a hot and sweet preserve of mustardy candied fruits that gleam beautifully and taste both festive and fabulous."

Peel and slice off stem, and set aside. Place artichoke on top of piece of heavy duty foil, large enough to hold 2 artichokes along with their stems sealed tightly as a packet. Pull open each artichoke and insert 1/2 tablespoon of butter and sprinkle with 1/2 the minced garlic, salt, and pepper. Then, drizzle with lemon, olive oil. Tightly enclose 2 artichokes to each foil packets, so that there are three packets all together. Double wrap them so that there is no leakage in the oven. Put each packet on the top oven self and allow it to roast for 30 minutes. Toss the fennel in a bowl with salt and pepper. Lay them onto a rimmed sheet pan and roast on the middle shelf for 20 minutes. Do the same with the cherry tomatoes and place in a pie dish on the middle shelf next to the fennel for 20 minutes. Bring a pot of salted pasta water to a boil. When the artichokes come out of the oven, open the packets allowing them to cool faster. When cool enough to handle, remove the leaves and stems and set them aside for another use. Cut up the hearts into 1 inch pieces and place them inside any remaining juice from the foil packets. Bring a 12\" saute pan to medium heat and add 2-3 tablespoons of the oil. Add the minced garlic and when it begins to color, add the wine. Allow the wine to reduce slightly before adding the stock. Add the stock, both tomatoes, olives, fennel, and artichokes with any remaining juice. Adjust for salt and pepper. Squeeze in any remaining lemon juice. Allow the sauce to simmer on medium low for 15 minutes. 10 minutes before serving, add the pasta to the water and cook until al dente. Save about a 1/2 cup of pasta water just in case. Drain the pasta and toss with the sauce. Add parsley. Add some of the pasta water if needed. Serve it with freshly grated cheese."

You want to make sure that the liquid is at least half way up the steak or more. Add water to do this. Typically cook for 2 hours or a bit more. If you cook it less the steak will be very tough so take your time. Remove from pot and let stand for 5 min and cut the short way in 1\" wide rolls.

At 10 hours, and every hour thereafter, check the beef with a skewer. The brisket is done as soon as the skewer goes in and out easily and when you get a jiggle that's borderline erotic upon poking the brisket with a finger. Or, fine, when it's around 150\u00b0F in the lean, flat part of the brisket. This is not your Jewish grandma's brisket, so don't expect it to fall apart.",

    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "Cut the parsnip in a 1/4\" dice. This is time consuming and a bit of pain. Chop the onion. Pour the beef or chicken stock into a small sauce pan and heat until boiling. Keep the stock at a low boil until you will begin adding it to the risotto. Add the olive oil to a large pan and heat until shimmering. Add the onion and cook over medium heat until starting to brown and carmelize. Add the diced parsnip and cook for several minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the white wine and cook for another minute. The wine should begin to boil off and absorb into the parsnips. Add the boiling stock 1 ladle at a time. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the stock is absorbed, then add another ladle and repeat until the stock is gone. Cook until the stock is absorbed and the parsnips are al dente. Parsnips are not as absorbent as arborio rice, so the stock will not completely disappear. while the parsnips are cooking, toast the pine nuts. Either spread them out on a pan in a toaster oven, or fry them in a pan with a little olive oil. I prefer frying them in a pan. Toasted pine nuts with a little olive oil and salt are excruciatingly yummy. Be careful. It only takes a few minutes and the difference between toasted and burnt is only a few seconds. I have burnt as many pine nuts as I have toasted. When the parsnips are fully cooked, add the the tablespoon of butter and stir until melted. Remove from the heat and stir in the pine nuts. Allow to cool a bit, then stir in the parmesan cheese and the parsley. If you put the parmesan cheese in while it is too hot it will melt, then clot as it cools. Add salt and pepper to taste. The stock adds a lot of salt, so you probably won't need to add any unless you are a real salt lover. You can add other things (sundried tomatoes, prociutto, etc.) either at this point or earlier in the last few minutes of cooking the parsnips."

Add the flour mix and with a dough hook, set the mixer on med. low. Mix until dough is no longer shaggy but smooth, approx. 10 mins. Transfer dough to a bowl sprayed with cooking spray and cover with sprayed plastic wrap. Let rise for 35 mins. Empty bowl of dough onto a floured mat or counter top and using a pizza cutter, cut it into 8 equal pieces. A food scale can help ensure that each ball is the same size for uniform cooking. Shape each piece into a ball by pulling down on the sides and pushing up into the center, then pinch closed. Place the balls on a tray sprayed with cooking spray, covered with sprayed plastic wrap. Let rise another 30 mins. Meanwhile, combine 12 c water with the baking soda and bring to a boil. Boil 4 rolls at a time for 30 seconds, turning over and boiling them on the other side for another 30 seconds. Place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Brush them evenly with the egg white mixture and sprinkle with kosher salt. Using a serrated knife, cut two parallel gashes in the roll's top, about 1/4\" deep. Bake in the oven for 15 minutes or until deep golden brown and about 180 degrees, using a meat thermometer. Turn the tray halfway through to ensure even browning."

    "ingredients": [],

      "Heat the oven to 225\u00b0F. Peel the potatoes, cut them in half lengthwise, and cut each half in 3. Boil the potatoes in well-salted water until they're completely tender but not falling apart, about 20 minutes. To check doneness, take a piece out of the pot and cut it at the thickest part. It should sort of break apart and look dry inside. Taste it to be sure, then drain the potatoes well, spread them on a baking sheet, and put them in the oven for 15 minutes to dry completely.",
      "Pass them through a sieve or food mill into a medium bowl and set them aside. If you'll be cooking the puffs as soon as the dough is ready, leave the oven on so that you can keep batches warm as you fry.",
      "Meanwhile, make the pate a choux: In a medium saucepan, bring 1/2 cup water to a boil with the butter and 1/4 teaspoon salt. Add the flour all at once, turn off the heat, and stir with a wooden spoon until completely incorporated. Return the pan to very low heat and stir for a few minutes until the dough forms a ball and a cooked film begins to develop in the saucepan. Let the dough cool for a couple of minutes, and stir in one of the eggs. The dough will fly apart into seemingly irreconcilable blobs, but do not lose heart; keep stirring, and it will become one again, I promise.",
      "Beat the other egg in a small bowl and begin to stir it in-you may not want to add all of it in the interest of dryness. Stop adding egg when the dough becomes elastic, smooth, and shiny, and then stir in the potato and garlic paste and mix thoroughly. The dough will be very sticky.",
      "In a heavy saucepan or skillet, heat 2 to 3 inches of frying oil to 325\u00b0F, or until it is shimmery, not smoking, and a tiny dollop of the dough dropped in sizzles energetically, but does not scare you out of the kitchen. Carefully drop a walnut-size piece of dough into the oil to fry for a taster. Taste and adjust for salt and . . . more garlic? . . . cooked longer? There are two ways to proceed with frying: (1) load the dough into a pastry bag, squeeze out short lengths, and cut them off and into the oil with a knife or scissors, or (2) use two spoons to form and scrape dollops into the oil. Fry the puffs until they're golden brown, prodding them with a spider to roll them over and fry the other side as needed.",
      "Dip them out to drain on a rack or crumpled paper and keep them warm in the oven (without the paper, if that's what you're using) as you fry the rest.",
      "Instead of serving the potato puffs alongside fish, meat, chicken, or beans, make them for a pre-dinner aperitivo that you stand around eating in the kitchen while you fry the next batch.",
      "In spring, if green garlic stalks are available, thinly slice, rinse, and cook one in butter and a very little bit of salted water. When it's tender, drain and add it to the mix in place of the pounded garlic.",
      "Add chopped chives, parsley, or thyme, or Parmesan or other gratable aged cheese to the dough.",

Cut the cheese slices into 4 parts and place 2 small pieces on each sandwich. Put the dinner roll tops on. In a sauce pan, mix butter, Worcestershire sauce, onion powder, garlic powder and poppy seeds. Wait until all butter is melted and then brush the melted mixture over the ham sandwiches. Cover with foil and let sit in fridge for 1 hour or over night. (If you want to bake them right away, you can also.) Preheat oven to 375 and bake for 15 minutes or until cheese is melted. Serve. They are great hot and even at room temperature Enjoy! PLEASE Remove the FOIL for Baking ~ it makes them toasty and warm",

      "Rinse the potatoes, peel them, rinse again, and cut lengthwise into 3/8-inch (10 mm) fries. (Precision is not essential here: I love the tiny, crunchy, almost-burned bits that emerge from the fryer.)",
      "Soak the potatoes in a bowl of cold water for about 5 minutes, changing the water when it becomes cloudy (at least twice), until the water remains clear. (Soaking releases the starch in potatoes, making them less rigid and less likely to stick together while cooking.)",
      "Drain the potatoes and wrap them in the kitchen towels to dry. (Removing the excess liquid will speed up the cooking time and reduce the likelihood of the potatoes splattering once the oil is hot.)",
      "Transfer the potatoes to the saucepan and set it over the stove. Pour the oil over the potatoes. Do not cover the pot. Set the heat to high, stirring the potatoes gently with a metal spoon to distribute and prevent sticking. (A metal spoon lets you feel if any potato bits are stuck to the bottom of the pan and scrape them up.)",
      "The oil should move from a peppy simmer to a boil in about 9 minutes. When the oil starts to boil, set a timer for 17 minutes. Stir the potatoes very gently every 3 to 4 minutes to prevent sticking and ensure even cooking. Don't worry about overboiling-the oil should boil rapidly and evenly with no need to adjust the heat throughout the entire process.",
      "When the timer rings, the potatoes should have begun to take on color, turning from white to slightly golden, but will still have about 4 minutes remaining until they are fully cooked. For these last few minutes, watch them closely, stirring gently. When the fries are a deep golden brown, taste one to make sure they are truly crisp and firm on the outside with a creamy interior. They should not be the least bit soggy, so resist the urge to remove them from the oil too soon. When you are happy with the consistency, carefully transfer the rest of the fries with the wire skimmer or slotted spoon to the paper-towel-lined trays to drain. Season with salt and serve immediately on the warmed platter.",
      "Use firm, fresh potatoes. Rinse and soak them well to rid them of starch. The less starch in the potatoes, the crispier the fries will be.",
      "To keep the oil well contained in the pot, make sure there is at least 2 inches (5 cm) of room from the top of the oil to the rim of the pot.",
      "We have made these fries in varied quantities with proportionate quantities of oil and pot size:",
      "Do not use an aluminum pot; it will not hold the heat in the same manner as a heavy cast-iron or stainless steel pot, and the results may not be satisfactory.",
      "After frying, let the oil cool and strain it through cheesecloth into the original containers. Store in the refrigerator and reuse up to five times. Mark the bottles as to number of uses and sniff the oil before reusing; if there is any scent of rancidity, toss. Each time the oil is reused, add about 1 cup (250 ml) fresh, new oil to the mix."
