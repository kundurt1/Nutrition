      "Chop enough of the red onions and jalapeno peppers to accommodate the number of jars you will be canning. I used 'pre-chopped garlic in a jar' for the home canned version.",
      "Drained the water from the soaking beans and add to each jar the amounts from the recipe above, assembly line style. Remember that the store bought canned beans are being replaced with the freshly soaked beans.

If you cannot keep your finger in that long then your water is too hot and let it cool but it should still feel hot to the touch. Now you are ready to add the yeast. Dissolve the yeast well in the water and stir. Now add the sugar. After a couple of minutes the yeast and water should start bubbling up and that tells you that it is working. If it doesn't bubble up you must throw out the yeast and start over.",
      "Sift your flour into an extra large bowl. You don't have to sift the flour but your results will not be as wonderful.",
      "In a separate bowl combine remaining ingredients except for the salt and mix well. Now add egg mixture to the flour mixture. Add yeast mixture and begin combining. Add salt before dough is fully combined. Now you can start mixing with your hands. Turn dough over and over and punch down again and again until the dough feels smooth and pops back up when you push it down. If it feels too sticky add a couple of tablespoons of flour at a time until you have reached the right consistency (the dough should not stick to your hands). You are now ready to let the dough rise. Spray the large bowl with oil spray as well as the top of the dough. Cover with a towel that is wet with warm water (but not dripping). Keep in mind that the dough will expand to about two to three times it's original size so your bowl needs to accomodate that. After your dough has reached a good size you can form you challah into desired shapes which is typically braided. Place in baking pan with room left to expand. Cover once again and allow to rise to double it's size. Now you can glaze the challah with a thin layer of egg white and sprinkle on desired topping. Place in a heated 350 oven for approximately 40 minutes. You know it is ready when the tops are nicely browned and when you turn over your challah and tap the bottoms you'll hear a hollow thumping sound. Enjoy!"

After the great famine of 1845 and the emigration of a portion of the population, the dish evolved and includes ingredients easier to find in their new land, such as beef. Finally, we replaced the water with Guinness, the flagship beer of the Irish culture. For this recipe, you can substitute it with the beer of your choice."

You can then pour some out to drink, or you can bottle some of it and flavor it to second ferment. You can flavor it with just about any fruit or veggie etc. Put a bit of the fruit or pureed fruit (about 1/4 C) in a soda bottle and add kombucha. Do not fill to the top or it may fizz out of the bottle. Cap and let sit on counter for another day or so, burping as necessary to avoid explosions. Place in fridge after the 2nd ferment. It will continue to ferment in the fridge, but much more slowly.",

      "Notes: If you see some dark strings in the tea, that is the yeast. It is perfectly fine. For lots of help and questions, Facebook has several groups dedicated to fermenting and also to kombucha. Most of the groups are very helpful and friendly. You may also contact me and I will try to help, if I can. Each time the scoby is moved, jostled, etc, it will grow a 'baby'. You may leave it attached to the 'mother' or eventually pull them apart if the tea gets too vinegary too quickly. Save the baby (or mother) in a separate glass jar with kombucha tea to cover. It doesn't matter if your scoby is small for your jar. The baby scoby will grow to fit the container."
