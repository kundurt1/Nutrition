As a result, their flavor becomes concentrated, and their natural sweetness comes out. Simply coat the vegetables with cooking spray or toss with oil or melted butter, and then toss with seasonings. Spread the vegetables in an even layer on a jelly-roll pan, baking pan, or roasting pan so they'll cook evenly. If the vegetables are not in a single layer, the ones on the bottom might steam rather than roast. Stir the vegetables occasionally as they roast.",

With a wooden spoon or stand mixer fitted with a dough hook, stir 3 cups all-purpose flour and all the whole-wheat flour into the yeast mixture; beat until dough is stretchy. Stir in another 1 cup all-purpose flour to form a stiff dough.",
      "Beat on medium speed until dough pulls cleanly from side of bowl and is no longer sticky (or knead until no longer sticky). If it's still sticky, add more all-purpose flour, 1 tbsp. at a time, and beat or knead until dough is smooth. Put hand-mixed dough in an oiled bowl and turn over to coat top.",
      "Cover dough with plastic wrap and let stand in a warm (about 80\u00b0) place until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour. Punch down dough. If you're not ready to cut and fry dough, cover again and chill up to 1 day.",
      "Knead dough on a lightly floured work surface to expel air. Cut into 4 equal portions. Working with 1 portion at a time, roll into a circle about 1/8 in. thick; with a floured knife, cut into 6 equal wedges and lay in a single layer on a floured rimmed baking sheet.

Heat over medium-high heat until a deep-fry or candy thermometer registers 350\u00b0, then adjust heat to maintain temperature. Drop one or two pieces of dough into oil. With a slotted spoon, push them down into oil until they begin to puff. Fry until pale gold on both sides, turning over as needed to brown evenly, 2 to 3 minutes total. Drain in paper towel-lined pans. Fry remaining sopaipillas the same way.",

      "Quick Tip: For a shortcut, replace the homemade dough with two 1-lb. loaves of thawed frozen white or wheat dough; then, in step 4, cut each loaf in half and roll out thinly. The sopaipillas are quite large, so feel free to halve the recipe.",
      "Make Ahead: Through step 3, up to 1 day, chilled; cut and fry dough the next day. Fried sopaipillas, up to 1 day, stored at room temperature; up to 2 months, frozen in resealable plastic freezer bags. To reheat fried sopaipillas, thaw (if frozen) and bake, uncovered, in a single layer on baking sheets in a 300\u00b0 oven, turning once, just until warm, 5 to 8 minutes. Do not overheat or they'll harden.",

And these salsa-laced patties mark the perfect occasion to enjoy a refreshing Caribbean beer like Red Stripe Lager ($50/six-pack) from Jamaica. Beers that are developed alongside spicy cuisine tend to be light-bodied, balanced, neutral, and incredibly quaffable, making this beer a good choice with the patties' serrano peppers and cumin. --Jeffery Lindenmuth"

      "Cut lemons into 1/8-inch-thick slices; discard seeds. Stir together water and sugar in a large, heavy saucepan. Bring to a light boil, stirring just until sugar dissolves. Add lemons; reduce heat to medium-low. Gently simmer 45 minutes or until rinds are very soft and lemons are translucent, turning lemons every 15 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon, and place in a single layer on a wire rack. Cool completely."

      "Melt butter in a large heavy saucepan over medium heat. Add leeks, parsnips, 1/2 tsp. salt and 1/4 tsp. pepper. Cook, stirring often, until softened but not browned, about 10 minutes. Pour in 4 cups broth, increase heat to high and bring to a full boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook, partially covered, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are very soft, about 30 minutes.",
      "Let cool slightly. Working in batches, puree soup in a blender. Return soup to saucepan and stir in cream. Warm over low heat and season well with salt and pepper. Thin with remaining broth if soup is too thick. Ladle into warmed soup bowls, garnish with a pinch of chives, and serve."
