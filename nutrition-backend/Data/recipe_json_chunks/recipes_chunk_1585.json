      "Preheat oven to 350 F. Prep your cupcake tins (two 12-count tins) by lining with cupcake liners and spraying the liners with cooking spray. Either baking spray or regular will work. Prep your 8\" cake pan by spraying with cooking spray, lining the bottom with a circle of parchment paper, and then spraying again. Set pans aside.",
      "1. For the cake: Into a medium sized bowl sift together the flour, salt, baking powder, baking soda, cocoa, and sugar. Set aside. In the large bowl of a stand mixer, combine oil, coffee, and milk. Then slowly mix in the dry ingredients until fully combined. Then add eggs and vanilla and beat on medium speed for 3-5 minutes.",
      "2. Fill cupcake liners 2/3 of the way full. Then put the remaining batter into the cake pan. The batter will be very thin. Bake at 350 F for 15-20 minutes for the cupcakes, or until a toothpick comes out clean. The cake will require an additional 5 minutes or so. Remove from oven and let them cool for 5 minutes in the pans. Then remove cupcakes from the cupcake tins and let them cool completely. Remove the cake from the pan as well by inverting onto a wire cooling rack.",
      "3. Make the filling while your cakes cool by creaming the butter in a medium side bowl then adding 1/2 cup of the powdered sugar. Add vanilla and 1 tablespoon of cream. Beat until well combined, scraping down the sides as necessary. Add the last 1/2 cup of powdered sugar and remaining 2 tablespoons of heavy cream alternating between the two and mixing well between each. Beat in the marshmallow cream last.",
      "4. Place the filling in a piping bag with a filling tip, and poke the tip into the center of the completely cooled cupcakes, moving up and down as you gently squeeze approximately 1/2 - 1 tablespoon of filling into each cupcake. If you are making a cake as well, put it onto your platter. Then cut the cake in half horizontally and pipe remaining filling onto the middle of the bottom half of the cake. Then add the top half of the cake on top of the filling.",
      "5. To make the ganache, put the chocolate chips into a heat-proof bowl and set aside. In a saucepan over medium heat, heat your 1/2 cup of heavy cream and 1 tablespoon of butter until almost boiling. Pour over chocolate chips and stir well until the chocolate is completely melted. Add the 2 teaspoons of vanilla and stir to combine.",
      "6. Dip the top of the filled cupcakes into the ganache to coat. Then set the cupcakes on a tray. Pour the remaining ganache over the top of the cake and spread evenly, letting a little bit spill down the sides. Place the cupcakes/cake in the refrigerator until the ganache is set, about 30 minutes.",
      "7. To make the icing, beat the 1 stick of softened butter, 2 tablespoons milk, 2 cups powdered sugar, and 1/4 teaspoon vanilla until smooth and fully combined. Place into a piping bag (or a baggie with a corner cut off) with a small tip attached, and pipe loops onto the top of each cupcake after the ganache is fully set."

Shred all of your meat while allowing the sauce to continue to cook until it is thick. Once the sauce is thickened, throw the meat back in and stir it back up. Let it soak up all of that extra moist, juicy flavor.",

You can toss the meat into a bowl, or even a taco shell shaped bowl to make it JUST like eating at your Mexican restaurant. You can eat it in a wrap, or even a crunchy taco shell. Put as much in as you desire, and then top with lettuce, cheese, any other toppings you crave, salsa... And ta da!",

      "A serving note: The recipe makes 14-16 dumplings.",
      "A timing note: The dumplings may be prepared several hours in advance through step 8, then refrigerated and fried later in the day.",
      "You will also need:",
      "1. A grater with large holes.",
      "2. A mixing bowl.",
      "3. A pastry board and rolling pin.",
      "4. A 2-inch (5 cm) biscuit cutter or a small glass with a 2-inch (5 cm) mouth.",
      "5. A spatula with a flat blade.",
      "6. A baking sheet lined with parchment or waxed paper.",
      "7. A pot for deep frying.",
      "8. A slotted spoon.",
      "9. A deep-fry thermometer is useful for maintaining the oil at the best frying temperature.",
      "For the dumplings:",
      "1. Preheat the oven to 450 F (230 C). Prick holes in the unpeeled potatoes and bake them until they are tender. This will take roughly an hour or a little less. Then remove them from the oven and set aside to cool them.",
      "2. While the potatoes cool, make the stuffing. In a skillet melt the fat or butter over low heat and add the prosciutto or other ham. Cook it, stirring, for a couple of minutes, until the ham begins to turn golden around the edges. Add the onions and continue cooking, stirring the mixture about, until both prosciutto and onion are golden. Transfer them to a bowl to cool. Stir in the ground cloves if including them.",
      "3. Grate the potatoes over the large-sized holes of a grater. There's no need to peel them. The peel will fold back as the potato runs through the holes of the grater.",
      "4. Place the grated potato in a mixing bowl. Add the beaten egg, flour, salt and pepper and mix everything together with one hand, squeezing and kneading the mixture into a cohesive dough. The dough will be damp but not sticky.",
      "5. Turn the dough out on a lightly floured pastry board and roll it out to a thickness of about 1/4-inch (about 1/2 cm). Cut rounds with the biscuit cutter or glass. Use the flat blade of the spatula to slide under any rounds that stick to the pastry board. In this way, they will come away from the board without losing their shape.",
      "6. Place about 1 teaspoon of stuffing in the center of half of the rounds.",
      "7. Top the rounds containing stuffing with the remaining rounds.",
      "8. Press the edges of each pair of rounds together and roll them into balls. (Photographs of shaping the dumplings are on the related link.) The dumplings may be prepared up to this point several hours in advance. Store covered and refrigerated until you are ready to fry them.",
      "9. To fry the dumplings, pour oil into a deep pot. There should be enough oil to allow the dumplings to float freely without touching the bottom of the pot as they fry.",
      "10. Heat the oil to 360 F (about 185 C) and place a few of the dumplings at a time in the hot oil to fry until they are golden. Stir the dumplings about gently with a slotted spoon to prevent them from sticking to the bottom of the pot. They will fry in about 3 minutes. Drain them on a paper towel lined plate and fry the rest in the same way.",
      "11. Before serving, sprinkle them with salt and a little chopped parsley, or garnish with a branch of parsley.",

I like to do about 5 or so at a time (as many as the work surface permits) because too few and you will be there forever, but the kataifi will dry out if it sits out for long so you want to keep it in the bag until the last second. Take a spoon and scoop about a small grape-sized amount of filling on the end of one section, then roll it up! There is no special technique about this part except that you want the filling covered. Dab the completed roll with butter and place in the pan. Keep going until you're done, then put 'em in the oven.",

You want this bread to get really nice and dark, for the flavors to develop...so bake them until the top crust is dark like molasses and bottom crust is also dark...don't worry, the interior is still really nice and moist! If you want to use an instant read thermometer, the bread should register about 200 degrees when it is sufficiently baked through.",

      "A few notes, from the baker:",
      "I baked this dough in two 9x5 pans. It rose admirably, but if you want a bit more of a \"mushroom shaped\" taller loaf, go for two 8 1/2 by 4 1/2 inch pans instead.",
      "Mixing all the ingredients (excepting the salt) together, and then letting them rest before kneading and continuing with the recipe, is a step that bread bakers term \"autolyse\". Which simply means \"to rest\". It allows the flour and water time to absorb, results in a moister dough, since you don't have to use as much extra flour, and is especially useful when working with a high percentage of whole grains.",
      "And the coolest part? This is a super easy bread! No \"sponges\", pre-ferments, or special steps involved! Just throw your stuff in the mixer and you're well on your way to toast heaven!"

      "For the cream puff shells?",
      "Preheat oven to 400 F. Set aside a large (12 or more) muffin tin but leave it un-greased.",
      "Bring water and butter to a rolling boil in a heavy saucepan. Then stir in flour over low heat, stirring until mixture forms a ball. Remove from heat. Stir in eggs, one at a time, beating until dough is a smooth ball.",
      "Using a tablespoon, drop dough into the muffin tins. This doesn't have to be an exact measurement, but depending on how big you want your shells to be, we use generous tablespoons.",
      "Bake shells in the 400 F oven for 25 to 35 minutes or until puffed, golden brown and dry. It's important that the puffs are dry or they may collapse. Remove from oven and cool completely. The shells can be prepared the day before. Just cover with foil when completely cooled.",
      "Cook's note: You can just bake the shells on a baking sheet about three inches apart, but my smart aunt decided the muffin tins make a nice shape to hold the cream. Either method works, but the baking sheet method will produce a little flatter shaped shell.",
      "For the custard cream filling:",
      "Beat the eggs in a medium sized heat safe bowl. Set aside.",
      "Mix sugar, flour and salt in a saucepan. Stir in milk. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly. Bring to a boil and boil for one minute only. Remove pan from heat. Stir about half of the mixture into the beaten egg yolks. Then blend the egg mixture back into the remaining hot mixture in the saucepan. Bring just to a boil. Add vanilla and stir until combined. Remove from heat. Set aside.",
      "For the whipped cream:",
      "Whip your cream using electric beaters and add a dash or two of sugar and vanilla to your liking.",
      "For the assembly:",
      "Cut off the shell tops and fill puffs 2/3 full with the custard filling. Top generously with sweetened whipped cream. Replace top of puff and cover with sifted confectioners' sugar.",
      "Delicious!",
      "This recipe is adapted from a recipe in a local newspaper from the 1960's called Ingrid's Austrian Cream Puffs."

      "*Tip: It is best if you mise en place (measure out) everything before you begin. Since this recipe needs to be done pretty exactly as stated, it will help your baking go a lot more smoothly.",
      "1. Preheat oven to 325 F. Line two 12 cup cupcake tins with liners and set aside.",
      "2. Next, let's brown the butter:",
      "-In a small saucepan, add your 1/2 cup of butter. Over medium heat, melt the butter.",

      "3. In a small sauce pot, add your milk and vanilla extract. Gently warm over medium low heat until just warmed. You want the temperature to be a little warmer than your body temperature. So dip that finger in. If it's slightly warm to the touch, you're perfect! Turn off the heat and set aside.",
      "4. In a bowl whisk together your flour, cocoa powder and salt until totally combined. Set aside.",

      "6. In a clean and dry stand or hand held mixer bowl, beat your egg whites. You will want to make sure you have stiff peaks. Set aside.",
      "7. In another clean bowl, beat your eggs yolks and powdered sugar on low speed. Once mixed in, scrape down bowl, turn up speed and beat until light and fluffy. Add your cooled, browned butter. Mix again thoroughly.",
      "8. Mix together your milk/vanilla mixture with your coffee. With mixer on low, alternate adding your flour/cocoa mix and milk/coffee mix into your yolks, 1/2 at a time. Stop and scrape bowl between add ins. Yes, your mixture should be VERY liquidy. Like hot chocolate consistency. You're OK. Keep going.",
      "9. Next, add your egg whites into your batter. Gently fold/whip/cut your whites into the batter until it is almost completely mixed in. Little egg white clumps are OK but just make sure to break up any large chunks.",
      "10. Carefully pour your batter into your cupcake liners. You can go ahead and fill almost all the way up. I did 3/4 of the way. These cakes will rise only slightly. My batter yielded 23 cupcakes, but if I had poured a tiny less in I would have gotten 24.",
      "11. Bake for 15-20 minutes turning the pans half way through your timing. You are wanting your cakes to be puffed and cracked slightly, and still barely jiggling in the very center. Remove from oven, set pans on racks and let them cool completely!",

      "10. A plate lined with a paper towel.",
      "A timing note: The sugar snap pea garnish and soup may be made several hours in advance and reheated. The bread souffle batter may be made in advance, too, and quickly fried just before serving the soup.",
      "Preparing the sugar snap pea garnish:",
      "1. Remove 16 sugar snap pea pods from the total amount. Place the small bowl of ice water nearby. Bring the small pot of salted water to a boil. Add the baking soda and the 16 pea pods. Blanch for 30 seconds. Drain the water off of the peas and put them in the ice water. As soon as the peas are cool, remove them from the water and set them aside, wrapped up in a dish towel.",
      "Making the soup:",
      "1. Melt the butter in the pot over medium heat. Add the onion, celery, potatoes, bay leaf and thyme. Cover the vegetables with the waxed paper round, place the lid on the pot and cook the vegetables over medium low heat for about 15 minutes, or until the vegetables have begun to soften and are just beginning to turn golden around the edges.",
      "2. Remove the round of waxed paper. Add the chicken broth and bring the mixture to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer the soup for about 15 minutes more, or until the vegetables are completely tender.",
      "3. Add the remaining pound of sugar snap peas (not the blanched ones) and simmer for 3 minutes longer.",
      "4. Remove the bay leaf and puree the soup in batches (using a regular blender, or if you have one you can use a stick blender), transferring each pureed amount to the large bowl.",
      "5. Wash out the pot and strain the puree back into it, pressing down hard on the solids as the soup goes through the sieve.",
      "6. Taste and season the soup with salt and pepper. Keep warm if you are going to serve it immediately.",
      "Making the little bread souffles:",
      "1. In a blender or food processor, blend together the bread crumbs, thyme and garlic.",
      "2. Transfer the mixture to the small bowl and stir in the eggs. Set the mixture aside, covered until you are ready to fry it into souffles, right before serving the soup.",
      "3. Heat the fat or oil in the pan over moderate heat until it is hot but not smoking.",
      "4. Drop the batter by teaspoons into the fat and fry them for about 1 minute total, turning them when the first side is golden and briefly cooking them on the second side. They will rapidly puff and brown. Remove them from the pan with a spatula or slotted spoon. Drain them briefly on a paper towel.",
      "Serving the soup:",
      "1. Reheat the soup and divide it among bowls.",
      "2. Float a few little souffles in each bowl and garnish every bowl with a couple of the reserved, blanched sugar snap peas."

      "Note: All recipes, method, and assembly adapted from The Daring Baker's October 2012 Challenge page.",
      "For the puff pastry:",
      "Cut 14 tablespoons (or 1 3/4 stick) butter into cubes and set aside to come to room temperature.",
      "Put 1 3/4 cup flour into a bowl with the salt and the remaining 2 tablespoons (1/2 stick) cold, cubed butter. Lightly rub the butter and flour between your fingertips until it forms a mealy breadcrumb texture.",
      "Add the cold water and bring together with a fork or spoon until the mixture starts to cohere and come away from the sides of the bowl. As the dough begins to come together, you can use your hands to start kneading and incorporating all the remaining loose bits. If the dough's a little dry, you can add a bit more water. Knead for 3 minutes on a floured surface until the dough is smooth. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.",
      "While the dough is chilling, take the reserved room temperature butter and mix with the remaining 3 1/2 tablespoons plain flour until it forms a paste (called a beurrage). Place the butter paste between 2 sheets of clingfilm, and either with a rolling pin or your hands, shape it into a 4 1/2\" square. You can use a ruler, pastry cutter or your fingers to neaten the edges. Refrigerate for about 10-15 minutes so the butter firms up slightly. You want it to be solid but still malleable.",
      "Roll the dough out on a floured surface into a 6\" square. Place the square of butter in the center, with each corner touching the centre of the square's sides ( imagine a big butter diamond in the middle of a dough square). Fold each corner of dough over the butter so they meet the centre (you might have to stretch them a little) and it resembles an envelope, and seal up the edges with your fingers. You'll be left with a little square parcel.",
      "Turn the dough parcel over and tap the length of it with your rolling pan to flatten it slightly.",
      "Keeping the work surface well floured, roll the dough carefully into a rectangle 1/4\" thickness. With the longest side facing you, fold 1/3 (on the right) inwards, so it's covering the middle section, and ensure that it is lined up. Then, fold the remaining flap of dough (on the left) inwards, so you're left with a narrow three-layered strip.",
      "Repeat the procedure above. Wrap up in cling wrap and chill for at least 30 minutes.",
      "Repeat the procedure again, twice through, turning over and folding 2 times as mentioned. Wrap again in cling wrap and chill again for at least 30 minutes.",
      "Repeat the procedure 2 final times (for a total of 6 times). Wrap up in clingfilm and refrigerate until needed. The dough keeps a couple of days in the fridge.",
      "To bake the the puff pastry:",
      "Preheat oven to moderately hot 200\u00b0C (400\u00b0F). Lightly dust your work space with flour and remove your dough from the fridge.",
      "Roll into a large rectangle, the thickness of cardboard (about 12\"x 18\"). Roll on the work surface, and finish it off on a large piece of parchment paper. That way it's easier to move the sheets of pastry around.",
      "Cut into 3 equal pieces and place on a baking tray. If you don't have space for all three, you can bake them separately. Prick the pastry sheets all over with a fork. Place another sheet of parchment paper over the top and then top that with a heavy baking tray to prevent the layers from puffing up too much.",
      "Bake sheets for about 25 minutes in a moderately hot oven 200\u00b0C (400\u00b0F), removing the top layer of greaseproof paper/tray 10 minutes before the end for the tops to brown. Keep an eye on them and lower the temperature if you think they're browning too much. Remove the baked sheets from the oven and leave on a wire rack to cool completely.",
      "(The puff pastry dough, alone, will keep in the fridge for up to 2 days. Any leftovers can be well wrapped up and frozen for a year. Thaw for 30 minutes on the counter or overnight in the fridge.)",
      "For the pastry cream or creme patisserie:",
      "Mix the cornflour/cornstarch with 1/2 cup of milk and stir until dissolved.",
      "Heat the remaining milk in a saucepan with the sugar, dissolving the sugar and bringing the milk to the boil. Remove from heat.",
      "Beat the whole eggs into the cornflour/milk mixture. Then beat in the egg yolks. Pour in 1/3 of the hot milk, stirring constantly to prevent the eggs from cooking.",
      "Bring the remaining milk back to the boil and add the egg mixture, whisking as your pour. Keep whisking (don't stop or it'll solidify) on medium heat until the mixture starts to thicken.",
      "Remove the saucepan from the heat and thoroughly whisk the pastry cream free of lumps. Beat in the butter and vanilla until fully incorporated.",
      "Pour the pastry cream into a stainless steel or ceramic bowl, and then place clingfilm over the surface to stop a skin forming.Refrigerate overnight to give the pastry cream time to further thicken.",
      "Note: If you're worried about the pastry cream continuing to cook off the heat, you can transfer it to a stainless steel/ceramic bowl.",
      "For the icing:",
      "Whisk egg whites with lemon juice until lightly frothy. Whisk in confectioners sugar on a low setting until smooth and combined. The mixture should be thick enough to leave trails on the surface and hold its shape briefly when poured back into the bowl. If it's too thin, add in a more sugar, bit by bit until thick enough.",
      "For the final assembly:",
      "Once the pastry has cooled, you're ready to assemble your mille-feuille. Get ready a sturdy surface, clean chopping board, your pastry and the chilled creme patissiere from the fridge.",
      "Lay one pastry sheet on the board and spread half the creme patisserie evenly over the top. Take the second sheet and place it on top, pressing down lightly with your hands to ensure that it sticks to the filling. Spread the remaining cream and place the last sheet of pastry on top, pressing down again. Oozing around the sides is normal and can be neatened up after assembly. Pop in the fridge while you prepare the icing.",
      "For the icing:",
      "Melt the chocolate in a double boiler, stirring periodically. Once melted, transfer to a piping bag (or plastic bag with end snipped), resting nozzle side down in a glass or other tall container.",
      "Immediately pour the icing over the top of the top layer of pastry and spread evenly to the edges. Still working quickly, pipe or draw a row of thin perpendicular chocolate lines, cross-wise along the top of the icing.",
      "Again swiftly, take a sharp knife to make perpendicular cuts through chocolate lines down (from top to bottom) through the rows of chocolate. Draw the knife across the surface top in one direction, then make the next cut across the pastry in the opposite direction. Continue in this manner, moving along the rows of chocolate until the top is covered in a pretty swirly pattern.",
      "Once you've decorated your mille feuille with a clean knife, mark out where you're going to cut your slices, depending on how big you want them to be and leaving space to trim the edges. I got 10 out of mine, or 2 rows of 5.",
      "Chill for a couple of hours to give the icing time to set. With a sharp knife, trim the edges and cut your slices."

Turn it up to medium until you get that nice spreading consistency.",

Once the liquid is homogenous, add it into a small saucepan. Have the beaten egg yolk handy, by your saucepan. Turn the heat to medium and cook the pudding mixture while stirring continuously. In about 5-6 minutes, the pudding will begin to thicken and bubble around the edges. Turn off the heat. Pour a small amount of this mixture into the egg yolk and whisk vigorously. Add a little more and continue to whisk. You are tempering your egg yolk. Now, pour the egg yolk mixture into the saucepan and turn the heat back to medium. Bring the mixture to a boil while continuously whisking. It should take 2-4 minutes. Once the mixture has boiled, turn off the heat and add the butter and vanilla. Stir to dissolve, then pour pudding into a glass bowl, press plastic wrap directly on the surface, and chill in the refrigerator for about an hour.",

Cover this mixture with plastic wrap and let it chill for at least 4 hours before serving. Before serving, garnish with whipped cream and leftover wafers. Smile and serve."

      "Just shortly before the shortbread is ready (about 5-7 minutes before), prepare the glaze. Melt the butter in a small saucepan with the Golden Syrup. When it is melted and bubbling, quickly whisk in the powdered sugar and ginger, stirring until smooth. Pour the glaze over the shortbread as soon as it comes out of the oven, spreading it to cover the shortbread entirely. Immediately sprinkle the top of the glaze with fine sea salt and crystallized ginger. Allow the glaze to set for about 20 minutes. Remove the shortbread from the pan while still warm and gently slice into bars.",

Add the heavy whipping cream and stir just until mixture starts to clump into a large ball. It's important not to over mix here.

Pour the remaining crumbs onto the top and using your fingers, gently press it all together.",

Remove the pan from the oven and quickly sprinkle generously with the remaining sugar. Put them back in the oven and bake for 10 more minutes, or until scones are lightly browned around the edges.

Cut the halved watermelon into medium sized chunks while removing the rind and place chunks into a food processor or blender. Process the watermelon thoroughly or until it looks like a watermelon slushy. Strain the watermelon mixture through a fine kitchen strainer or sieve into a bowl. If you don't have a strainer you can use cheese cloth or a paper towel, this will reduce your yield slightly due to the cloth absorbing some of the juice, but works well. One half of a 5-6\" diameter seedless watermelon yielded 16 ounces of juice.",

      "You can use a knife or a fry cutter. Peel, then slice them one at a time. This stage takes the longest, about a half hour. As long as you really do cut them one at a time you'll be golden. Plunge them immediately into a salt water bath once sliced to prevent browning. I don't know why this works, but it does. If you skip the step you'll have brown potatoes, and they won't be as wonderful.",

You can do it all at once or toss in oil first then add the spices; whatever works best for you. Just make sure they are covered, but not drenched. The easiest way to get it right is to split it into smaller groups. If you do half, or even a third of the potatoes at a time you can see what you're doing more clearly and get everything coated properly without overdoing it.",
      "Cooking them on a foil lined cookie sheet makes clean up easy. I'm all about easy. Lay the sliced potatoes out on the cookie sheet. Make sure they aren't overlapping at all.

      "1. Brown the butter. In order to brown the butter, you'll want to cut the butter into small pieces and place in a small non-reactive pan. Put on medium high heat and loosely cover (only one of the five times I cooked it did it splatter, but better to cover it and be safe). Stir every couple minutes or so. The butter will melt, then foam - when it foams you can remove the foam, or if you are lazy like me, just let it be. Once it starts to brown, watch carefully! It can go from brown to black quickly. Once it has the smell and had darkened in color, remove from heat, being careful to not let the brown butter solids turn black. Let cool to room temperature (sticking it in the fridge helps speed the process).",
      "2. Combine room temperature browned butter with sugar (cane + brown). Beat for five minutes until sugar has started to dissolve.",
      "3. Add one large egg and the teaspoon of vanilla and mix to incorporate.",
      "4. Sift together flour, soda, and salt.",
      "5. Add 1/4 a cup of flour mixture at a time to the batter. Scrape down with a spatula as needed.",
      "6. Add coffee granuals and flaxseed, mixing until just combined.",
      "7. Place in the refrigerator for 10-15 minutes, until slightly chilled. (This is so the chocolate doesn't melt into the batter)",
      "8. While batter is cooling, chop chocolate bars finely. (bars work better than chips - you want a variety of sizes of chocolate pieces).",
      "9. Remove batter from fridge and add chocolate. Mix by hand.",
      "10. Shape cookies (as directed in blog link)",
      "11. Place shaped cookies back in the fridge for 24 to 36 hours. (Both steps 10 and 11 are extremely important - please don't skip!)",

      "To preserve the citrus, choose organic, unwaxed varieties of lemons that are ripe, firm and unblemished. Mix the spices into the salt. I chose coarse salt - used for pickling and canning - because it's additive free. Cut a cross into the fruit about 3/4 of the way to the base - but not all the way through - the quarters should stay together.",
      "Push the seasoned salt into the quarters and pack the fruit as tightly as possible into an airtight jar. Use as much salt as you need to fill in the gaps, but go easy on the spices. A little goes a long way. I put one juniper berry inside each lemon, and then threw a couple of extra into the jar. That will be PLENTY.",
      "Store in your fridge for 6 weeks, gently turning and flipping the jar 3 times per week to evenly distribute the salt and juices. Once preserved, the jars can be kept in a cool, dark place (cupboard). Preserved lemons will keep at least 1 year."

Also reserve the middle slices of the strawberry to line the outside of the trifle. Middle slices should all be about the same size. This is not necessary but it makes the trifle more visually appealing.",

      " In a large bowl, beat the yogurt, cream cheese, sour cream and vanilla until smooth. Fold in pudding mixture.",
      " Place a third of the cake cubes in a 4-quart trifle bowl. Top with a third of the pudding mixture, push pudding mixture down so it seeps into the cake. Line the outer edge of the dish with the reserved middle strawberry slices placing them vertically side by side against the glass (see photo) Add a third of the strawberries and blueberries mixture in one layer across the pudding. Then add half of the whipped topping and slather it across the berries till it reaches the edge of the dish. Make sure you push layers down every time you add pudding and whipped topping. Repeat layers once. Top with remaining cake, the final pudding layer. Decorate top of pudding with outer edge slices of strawberries and a handful of blueberries. Serve immediately or refrigerate. This is best served when trifle has been in fridge for about 4-8 hours. When serving, make sure you make a big enough scoop to reach the fruit layer."

      "3. In a medium thick-bottomed saucepan on medium heat, melt the butter. Cook it, stirring constantly, until it just begins to brown. Add the brown sugar and salt. Stir until the sugar completely melts.",
      "4. Slowly add the milk and half-and-half, stirring to incorporate. It will foam up initially, so make sure you are using a pan with high enough sides. Heat until all of the sugar is completely dissolved. (I don't think my sugar completely melted so it got hard once I poured in the half-and-half and milk. If this happens to you, just be patient and the sugar will automatically release from the bottom and dissolve into the liquid.) Do not let it boil or the mixture may curdle. (Mine ended up curdling but I continued with the recipe.)",

Stir the mixture constantly over medium heat with a wooden or heatproof rubber spatula, scraping the bottom as you stir, until the mixture thickens and coats the spatula, about 5-7 minutes (my entire liquid ended up curdling and almost ended up looking like scrambled eggs and never thickened but I continued onward).",
      "7. Pour the custard through the sieve and stir it into the cream. (Since my liquid curdled I pushed most of the liquid through the sieve and left a lot of the curdled bits in the sieve and threw it away. The cream/custard mixture was very liquidy before I put it into the machine but once it churned, it was fine.) Add vanilla and stir until cool over the ice bath. Chill mixture thoroughly in the refrigerator.",

Lay out the almonds on a roasting pan in a single layer coat with some melted butter or butter PAM spray and sprinkle with fleur de sel. Bake for 6-8 minutes, until lightly toasted and fragrant. Let cool. Once cool, roughly chop the almonds and set aside.",
      "9. Pour chilled cream mixture into an ice cream maker and churn for 25 minutes or to desired consistency. Add chopped almonds and churn for another 5 minutes. Eat right away or put into airtight container with plastic wrap touching the ice cream so crystals do not form on it."

If pie crust is browning faster than the pie filling is cooking, simply remove pie from oven and gently cover edges with tin foil. Even better, use a pie crust shield! I love mine! Works like a dang charm.",

Pour hot cream directly over your chocolate chips and allow to sit 1-2 minutes before whisking together. Then whisk until smooth and sauce-like. Set aside.",
      "To assemble the tiramisu:",
      "Dip 30 Oreos (or Joe Joes) into your vanilla and milk mixture, one by one, and lay them flat in one layer on the bottom of your 9x13\" pan. Make sure to flip the cookies over again and again in the milk mixture until they are thoroughly soaked, but not falling apart. They'll soften once they sit in the pan a few seconds.",
