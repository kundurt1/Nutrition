      "Knead (or mix) for about 10 minutes, adding flour as needed, until the dough is tacky, but not sticky, and supple.",

      "You can also use nondiastatic barley malt syrup, which will contribute flavor more than color, or make this bread without any malt, since there is some malt already added to most brands of bread flour (the pre-ferment will contribute some enzymes of its own).",
      "Both powder and syrup can be purchased through King Arthur Flour (see Resources, page 287).",
      "Breadsticks never go out of favor and may be peaking at an all-time popularity.",

      "Grissini, originating in Turin and the Piedmont region of Italy, have become synonymous with crisp, thin Italian breadsticks, much as ciabatta has become generic for rustic bread (there is also a thicker, softer type of breadstick called francesina.)",
      "But breadsticks are international in scope and, frankly, can be made from pretty much any bread dough.",
      "The question is, do you want them soft or crisp, long or short?",
      "For soft breadsticks, you can use any of the white bread formulas (pages 265269), the kaiser formula (opposite), or English muffin dough (page 157).",
      "Also, French (page 168), Vienna (page 261), or Italian (page 172) bread, baked hot and fast, makes fine breadsticks.",
      "For crisp sticks, use bagel dough (page 115), lavash dough (page 178), or Italian bread dough.",
      "To drive off the moisture for crisp breadsticks, bake them for a long time at low temperatures, 325 to 350F, until dry and crisp.",
      "For soft breadsticks, bake hotter, at 400 to 425F, until the sticks turn golden brown, then immediately remove them from the oven.",
      "They soften as they cool.",
      "There are two ways to shape breadsticks.",
      "One is to roll out each individual stick, rolling them like strands to the desired length, laying them out on a pan, proofing, and then baking.",
      "This is great when you want each stick to be unique and distinctive, but it is time-consuming to make a lot of them.",
      "When making a large quantity of bread sticks, Ive had great success with the following method.",

      "Total: 332.7%",
      "Roll out the dough to the desired thickness, and then cut off individual sticks with a pizza cutter (rolling blade).",
      "To seed the breadsticks, you can either roll each unbaked breadstick on a wet towel and then in a bed of seeds, which is great for total seed immersion, or, you can brush or mist the pan of breadsticks with water and then sprinkle the seeds over the top just before baking them.",
      "Sesame or poppy seeds are the most commonly used, but I like a blend of those with a sprinkling of sea salt, paprika, and granulated garlic (or garlic salt), with a touch of coarsely ground black pepper.",
      "You can also add fennel, caraway, cumin, or aniseeds, but they are intense and a few seeds go a long way.",
      "These everything toppings are becoming more and more popular on bagels, cracker breads, and now on those ubiquitous, addictive breadsticks turning up in bread baskets all over the world.",
      "You can then either lay the sticks out on a baking parchmentlined sheet pan or individually stretch them further before laying them out, rolling them into swizzle twists, ovals, or curling them into distinctive shapes."

      "TEMPERING CHOCOLATE: Tempering is important because it determines the final gloss, hardness, and contraction of the chocolate.",

      "Chocolate is purchased in its tempered form.",
      "It snaps when you break it, usually has a nice shine to it and it is hard.",
      "In order to use it, you need to melt it.",
      "When you melt chocolate, the molecules of fat separate and you lose the temper (crystallization).",
      "If you want to use the chocolate for molding or coating, it needs to be tempered.",
      "Tempering chocolate means putting the molecules of fat back together.",
      "There are a variety of ways to do it.",
      "One of the easiest ways to temper it is to place the chocolate in a glass bowl and put it in the microwave for 30 seconds at a time on high power until the chocolate is melted.",
      "Be very careful not to overheat it.",
      "Keep an eye on it; the chocolate will not look like it has melted because it retains its shape.",
      "The chocolate should be only slightly warmer than your bottom lip.",
      "You may still see lumps in it but, don't worry; the residual heat of the chocolate will melt them.",
      "You can also use an immersion blender to break up the lumps and start the recrystallization process.",
      "Usually, the chocolate begins to set (recrystallize) along the side of the bowl.",
      "As it begins to crystallize, mix those crystals into the melted chocolate and they will begin the recrystallization process.",
      "I like to use a glass bowl because it retains the heat and keeps the chocolate tempered a long time.",
      "Here is another easy way to temper chocolate.",
      "In this method, tempering is achieved by adding small pieces of unmelted chocolate to melted chocolate.",
      "The amount of unmelted chocolate to be added depends on the temperature of the melted chocolate but is usually one fourth of the total amount.",
      "I use an immersion blender to mix the 2 together.",
      "The classic way to temper chocolate is call tabliering.",
      "Chocolate is melted over a hot water bath to a temperature between 88 and 90 F (31 to 34 C).",
      "White and milk chocolate are melted to a temperature approximately 2 F less, depending on the amount of milk fat they contain.",
      "2/3 of the melted chocolate is poured on a cold table or marble surface.",
      "The chocolate is spread out and worked with a spatula until the temperature of the chocolate is approximately 81 F (27 C).",
      "At this stage, it is thick and begins to set.",
      "This tempered chocolate is then added to the remaining one third of non-tempered chocolate and mixed thoroughly until the mass in the bowl has a completely uniform temperature.",
      "If the temperature is still too high, part of the chocolate is further worked on the cold table until the correct temperature is reached.",
      "This is a lot of work, requires a lot of room and makes a big mess.",
      "Here is a tip: Temper more chocolate than you need.",
      "A larger quantity will hold its temper longer than a smaller quantity (just like a large cup of coffee will stay hot longer than a small cup of espresso).",
      "You can always reuse the extra chocolate.",
      "Most people have trouble tempering because they use too small of an amount.",
      "Don't forget to use a glass bowl.",
      "A simple method of checking tempering is by applying a small quantity of chocolate to a piece of paper or to the point of a knife.",
      "If the chocolate has been correctly tempered it will harden evenly and show a good gloss within 5 minutes.",
      "Remember, just like everything else in life, practice makes perfect.",
      "If your chocolate does not temper the first time, you can still eat it!",
      "Now that is an incentive!"
