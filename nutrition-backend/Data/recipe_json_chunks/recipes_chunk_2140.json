      "You can help this along and crush the tomatoes with the back of your spoon or leave it chunky up to you.",
      "When you get a consistency that you like (a nice thickness) remove the pan from the heat and set it to the side.",

      "Give it about 8-10 inches of space, at least.",
      "On the other side of the egg mixture, leave a pan or a plate of plain flour for dredging your stuffed chiles (this step is optional, but I think it helps keep the egg on the chile).",

      "Flip them over gently and fry the other side for the same amount of time.",
      "The egg batter will expand slightly during frying so its best to fry only two or three at a time, depending on how big your pan is, to avoid them expanding into each other, thus causing a flipping nightmare that could potentially lead to the destruction of a few chiles.",
