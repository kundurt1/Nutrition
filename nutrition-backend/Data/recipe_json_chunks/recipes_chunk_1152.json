Brush layer with the with syrup. Remove ring from springform pan and coat sides and top with room temperature ganache.

Add the shortening and butter and mix quickly with your fingers until each piece is coated with flour. Pulse 10 times, or until the fat is the size of peas. With the motor running, add the ice water; process only enough to moisten the dough and have it just come together. Dump the dough out onto a floured board and knead quickly into a ball. Wrap the dough in plastic and allow it to rest in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.",

Brush the outside edges of each bowl with the egg wash, then place the dough on top. Trim the circle to 1/2-inch larger than the top of the bowl. Crimp the dough to fold over the side, pressing it to make it stick. Brush the dough with egg wash and make 3 slits in the top. Sprinkle with sea salt and cracked pepper. Place on a baking sheet and bake for 1 hour, or until the top is golden brown and the filling is bubbling hot."

Look for it near tofu at well-stocked supermarkets.",

      "On a baking board, mix the flour, cacao and baking powder. Make an indent in the middle and add the sucanat, vanilla extract, egg and water. Mix until a crumbly dough is formed. Place the cold butter pieces on top and work everything quickly into a smooth dough. If the dough remains a little sticky, place it covered into the refrigerator for about 20-30 minutes.",
      "Grease the spring form pan with a little butter and line it with parchment paper, covering only the bottom not the sides (trace the outline of the Springform on the parchment paper and cut out -- you want to cut out two pieces, as you will need the second one for the sponge cake). Grease the parchment paper just slightly as well. Roll out the dough (sprinkle a little extra rice flour on your board beforehand) and place it in the prepared Spring form, carefully cutting the dough, so only the bottom of the pan is covered (you can use up any extra dough by cutting it our with your favorite cookie cutter, for an extra treat).",
      "Bake for about 30 minutes, remove from oven, release the Spring form pan, invert onto a cooling rack and peel off the parchment paper. Let cool completely.",
      "Grease the bottom of the Spring form only (!) and line with the extra parchment paper you cut out during the first step of this recipe. Again slightly grease the parchment paper as well, but be very careful that no grease gets on the outer Spring form ring, because it will prevent the Sponge cake from rising properly.",
      "Sponge cake (Biskuitboden): Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F/180\u00b0C.",
      "For this next step, you will need two bowls, a smaller one for whipping the egg whites, and a larger one for the preparation of the batter.",
      "Separate the 4 eggs (yolks into the larger bowl, egg whites in the other). With a hand mixer, whip the egg whites until they form glossy and shiny peaks. Set aside.",
      "In the other bowl, combine the egg yolks with water and blend well, using the hand mixer. Little by little, add the sucanat and vanilla extract. Continue to mix until the batter becomes smooth and creamy.",
      "Place the whipped egg whites on top of the yolk batter, and set aside for a moment.",
      "Place the flour blend, guar gum, cacao and baking powder into a sifter (you can also use a fine sieve) and gently sift the ingredients on top of the egg whites.",
      "Now, carefully fold the flour and egg white into the batter. You want to take your time with this step. You are not looking to stir, or mix, but truly just slowly fold the ingredients together. This is best done with a rubber spatula, or a large spoon.",
      "When the flour has been fully incorporated into the batter, it should still retain its light and airy texture. Pour this batter into the prepared Spring form and smooth and level out the top, using a spatula.",
      "Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes (The baking duration depends on many factors: your own location, elevation, temperature, etc. and will play a role in how long this will take -- usually anywhere from 20-30 minutes).",
      "Remove the cake from the oven, release it from the Spring form, turn out onto a wire rack to cool and peel off the parchment paper.",
      "Once completely cooled, slice the sponge cake horizontally into 3 thin layers. Place each layer on a separate plate.",
      "If fresh cherries are available, wash them and remove the stones. Mix the cherries with a little sucanat. Set this aside for at least 20 minutes to draw out the juice. Then cook them briefly in their own juice. Remove and drain the juice into a separate bowl, preserving the juice. If you are using canned, drain the juice into a separate container. Set aside about 12 cherries for decorating the top of the cake. You will need 1/4 L (1 cup) of the cherry juice (top off with enough water, if there is not enough juice). Remove 4 tablespoons of this juice and place in a separate bowl, mixing it with the arrowroot flour. In a saucepan, heat the cherry juice, bring it to a boil, remove and add the blended arrowroot/cherry juice liquid. Mix one packet of the gelatin with 3 tablespoons of water, making sure it is completely dissolved, and add this to the boiled cherry juice. Bring everything back to a brief boil and then remove from heat, adding the cherries, remaining sucanat and Kirschwasser. Set aside and let cool.",
      "Prepare the second gelatin packet by mixing it with 3 tablespoons of water, allowing it to dissolve completely. Set aside. Add the whipping cream to a larger mixing bowl, and with a hand mixer, whip until firm, then add the sifted powdered sugar and the prepared gelatin. Continue to whip until nice and firm.",
      "Assembly of Cake: Select a cake plate of your choice and place the first baked bottom layer on it. Add half the amount of the cherry blend to this layer, topping that with a thin layer of whipped cream.",
      "Then add the first sponge cake layer on top of this.",
      "Top this layer with the remaining cherry filling and a thin layer of whipped cream. Spread out evenly and top with the second sponge cake layer.",
      "Add another thin layer of whipped cream to this and place the final Sponge cake layer on top.",
      "Spread just a smooth layer of whipped cream on the final layer, setting some whipped cream aside for the final steps. Now for this next step, you need to cut out large enough strips of parchment paper to drape around the outside of the cake, which helps to retain the filling. If you have one available, use just the outer rim of another, slightly larger, Spring form pan and place it on the outside of the draped parchment paper, and close the spring. This ensures the even setting of the filling. Place the cake in the refrigerator for a couple of hours to set the filling.",
      "Meanwhile, grate the chocolate and set aside.",
      "Remove the cake from the refrigerator and take off the Spring form ring, and carefully peel off the parchment paper. Remove any excess filling that was not contained by the paper, or outer ring, and then spread some additional whipped cream on the outer rim of the cake. Sprinkle the top with the grated chocolate. Place the remaining whipped cream in a pastry bag, fitted with a small rosette tip, and place 12 rosettes evenly spaced on top of the cake. Place one cherry (which you reserved earlier) on top of each rosette, and, if desired, a small piece of chocolate next to each rosette.",

      "My Note: Sometime I do not use lettuce (as it tends to wilt as it sits out) and I don't use a lot of green pepper. Even though I love green pepper, I don't feel it belongs in this recipe (just my opinion). I make homemade guacamole and put that layer on top of the sour cream/cream cheese layer. I found a good guac recipe on this site (Simple Guacamole) that I use. They always \"lick the platter clean\" every single time. I've NEVER had leftovers. I serve with Tostitos Scoops as they grab the dip more! Oh and this doesnt' totally spread to fit in a 13x9 pan (mostly the beans don't) so I bought a clear pyrex dish a slightly smaller size. This dish has pretty much become my 7-layer dip dish because it's requested so much at every party! This is an awesome crowd pleaser.",
      "This recipe is very good as is, but is also easy to alter to personal taste. I have took suggestions of others and added 1 lb. of hamburger to the taco seasoning and guacamole instead of lettuce, both very good. I however like this recipe best with medium taco seasoning and salsa and also adding a can of Rotel instead of the tomato, green pepper, onions. Very easy and adds a bit of a kick to it. The 13X9in. dish works the best."

      "Now its time to prepare your smoker. If you do not have a smoker, you can do this with a regular grill to get the same smoke flavor. If you do not have a smoker, just go to the end of the directions for smoking and you will see how to do it with a grill.",
      "I have an upright, cylinder shaped, 2 tier smoker made by Brinkman. I buy hickory wood chunks from Home Depot or Walmart. I will put 4 or 5 in a pan of water to soak for about an hour. I light my coals and let them burn until the coals turn ashy of the sides. I add my soaked wood and water pan/drip pan ontop of that. I close the lid so it can get up to temperature.",
      "After about half an hour, I place the ribs in the smoker (bone side down)and leave them alone for atleast 2 hours. You want to maintain a constant temperature in the smoker of about 200 to 220 degrees. The secret to fall-off-the-bone ribs is cooking them low and slow. Do not even take the top off for 2 hours. After 2 hours, take them off and wrap in aluminum foil. Add more wet or dry wood chunks to the bottom bowl. Close the lid and let them cook another hour and a half. If you choose to add sauce, this is the time to do it. Open the aluminum foil and pour my sauce over them. After about 30 more minutes, you have the finest ribs that you have ever had!",
      "Now, if you do not have a smoker I recommend you get one. It's only $39 at Home Depot. Prepare your grill with coals and place wet hickory wood chunks all around ontop of the coals. Place ribs on the grill (bone side down) and let them cook about 30 minutes, turning them over after 15 minutes. Afterwards, wrap in aluminum foil and place back onto grill. Let them cook an additional 30 minutes. Pour my sticky sauce over them in the foil and let cook additional 15 minutes. Remove and enjoy!"

      "Carefully, while stirring, pour the lye into the water. I like to do this underneath the stove's vent, so the fumes go outside. Stir until all crystals are dissolved. It will get very, very hot, so don't touch the glass container. Leave under the hood, with the fan on, for about 5 to 10 minutes to cool down.",
      "Again while stirring, and pouring carefully (impossible to do while photographing), add the lye/water solution to the oils in the crockpot. Use a soapy/vinegar/water mixture in the sink to rinse the containers and utensils that touched lye to neutralize this caustic.",

Blend for 15-30 seconds at a time, then give it a short rest. It will go from clear to opaque, and resembles vanilla pudding when done. The mixture, when dripped off the stick blender, will stay in visible ridges, rather than the mixture collapsing back into a smooth top. With this soap, it takes about 2 to 3 minutes. With pure olive oil soap, it can take 5 minutes or more to achieve trace.",
      "Cover and let \"cook\" for about an hour. During the cooking time, the mixture will change back to translucent. It will raise up at the sides, like waves. By the end of the cooking, the whole mixture will be translucent and the center of the mixture will be collapsed with the \"waves\" rolled into the center.",

      "Turn off the crockpot. During the cooking time, prepare your molds. I use two plastic drawer trays lined with freezer paper. Usually, I use freezer paper (shiny side up). During this soap making, I was out of that, so I used parchment paper that I greased with coconut oil; worked fine.",
      "Fill the mold(s) with the hot soap mixture. Tap up and down on the counter or a floor to evenly distribute the mixture. You can use your hands, but be careful and touch lightly as the mixture is very hot! (And you need it to be hot to fill the mold properly.).",
      "Now the soap in the mold(s) needs to cool/harden, at least overnight. The crock can be scraped clean for instant delight - soap that's ready to use! When hardened and cooled, lift the paper to pull the soap out of the mold(s). Peel the paper off the soap block. Put the block on a cutting board and use a big knife to cut into bars.",
      "The bars still need to harden significantly and will do this over time. Keep them in a cool location with good airflow. I keep a tray of upright bars in my bathroom. We use one, the rest age, we use another, the rest keep aging... If upright, more air can flow and they'll harden more evenly and faster. Rotate them infrequently if you'd like."

After a few minutes, as the juice starts to run and the mixture begins foaming a little around the edges, gradually raise heat to high, stirring often.",
      "Boil hard for approximately 20-30 minutes, gently scraping the bottom every few minutes with a heatproof rubber spatula to be sure mixture is not sticking. If it begins to stick, reduce heat slightly, making sure it continues at a rapid boil. Continue to cook, scraping bottom frequently, until foam subsides; the mixture acquires a darker, shinier look; and the berries appear softened and saturated with liquid, approximately 25 minutes total.",
      "Turn off heat. Do not stir. Let mixture sit a moment, then use a metal soup spoon to carefully scrape all the white foram off the top of the mixture. When you have removed every last bit of white, stir in the Marsala, little by little, tasting as you go. The flavor should be present, but not overpowering. Return to medium heat and cook, stirring frequently. If necessary, gradually lower the heat to prevent scorching.",

To test for doneness, remove the jam from heat and take a small representative half-spoonful (one containing both the liquid and the more solid portions of the mixture) and carefully transfer it onto one of your frozen spoons. Replace the cold spoon in the freezer for 1 to 2 minutes.",
      "Remove from freezer and nudge it gently with your finger. It should by this time be neither warm nor cold; if still warm, put it back in the freezer for a moment. Tilt the spoon vertically to see how quickly your jam runs; if it runs slowly, and if it has thickened to a gloppy consistency, it is done. If it runs very quickly, or appears watery, cook for another minute or two, stirring, and test again, repeating more times if necessary. This jam, while spreadable, has a relatively loose texture.",
      "Turn off heat but do not stir. Skim all remaining foam from the surface of your jam, then stir well to be sure berries and liquid are evenly distributed.

If desired, for a very light cream cheese flavor add 1/2 block (4 oz). cream cheese, leaving the other ingredients (as listed above) the same. For a more traditional cream cheese flavor, reduce the butter to 1/2 cup, and add 1 block (8 oz.) of cream cheese. If using a full block of cream cheese, you can reduce the cream or milk to 1 tablespoon total.",

Orange and/or lemon zest, citrus extracts, mint extract, coconut extract or the seeds of a vanilla bean are all wonderful options. In most cases I'll still add 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla, then 1/2 teaspoon of the other flavoring. For zest, add about 1 teaspoon fresh zest.
