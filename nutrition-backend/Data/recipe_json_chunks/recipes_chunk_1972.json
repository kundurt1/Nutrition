      "Do not over coat either the pan or the foil, it is not necessary.",
      "To make the candy, begin by combining the butter and sugar in large heavy bottomed saucepan.",

      "It takes about 25-30 minutes for the caramelizing process to occur and achieve the right consistency.",
      "Cook to 310 degrees (150 C.) on a candy thermometer, or until the mixture reaches the brittle stage in iced water.",
      "Note, that while cooking, the colors of the mixture will change from a very pale yellow to a deepening dark caramel color.",
      "Remove from the heat and add the vanilla and stir for about 30 seconds to blend the vanilla, (it is at this point you'd add the optional chopped or whole almonds, see note below).",
      "Then, carefully pour the candy mixture into the prepared pan, it will be very hot and it is recommended that you not make this candy with distractions or children around you.",
      "Then, as it has filled the pan, gently place the chocolate chips as evenly as you can, all over the top of the toffee.",
      "After about 1 to 2 minutes, you will find that although the cocolate chips remain in their distinct shape, the heat from the toffee has melted them, and they will easily spread over the toffee.",
      "Carefully, but quickly, spread the cocolate chips out to frost the entire top of the toffee.",
      "Then, sprinkle the chocolate with the nuts as evenly as possible.",
      "Let the toffee set-out until it completely cools and hardens, about 4-6 hours.",
      "Then, break into smaller pieces, (this can be done merely by lifting the toffee out of the pan with the foil and sharply dropping it onto a hard surface, or leaving it in the pan and twisting the pan).",
      "The foil will easily peel from the back of the toffee.",
      "It will stay fresh wrapped in wax paper and then plastic wrap, in a tightly sealed container for about 2-3 weeks at room temperature, or almost indefinitely in a refrigerator.",
      "(You may not find out how long, as it disappears so quickly)!",
      "Note: To have almonds in your toffee, as well as on top of it, either chopped or whole, add 2 cups (475 ml) of chopped or whole almonds at the same time you add the vanilla, stir for about 30 seconds and quickly finish the process of getting it to the pan and frosting it and putting the nut crusted topping on the toffee.",
      "Again.. be cautious about distractions or children around when you make this candy.",
