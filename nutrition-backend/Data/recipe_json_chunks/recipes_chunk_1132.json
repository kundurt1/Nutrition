Dump the dough onto the counter and shape it into a loose ball, place it in a lightly oiled bowl, and turn the dough in the bowl to coat with oil. Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and let the dough rise in a warm dark place for 1 hour then transfer the bowl to the refrigerator for 8 hours (up to 24 hrs) to let it relax, develop flavor, and become more manageable.",

Fold the top third down and the bottom third up as if you were folding a business letter. Seal the seam with the heel of your palm, then repeat with the letter fold.

Bake for about 25 minutes or until the loaves sound slightly hollow when tapped on the bottom and the crust is a medium to dark brown.

And, while both are made from fermented soy beans, tamari is a more-balanced, rich and delicate ingredient. Look for organic and non-GMO. Then, get right at it with a homemade batch of Tamari almonds. On a sheet pan, simply oven-roast the almonds for 20 minutes at 300\u00b0F. Remove and toss with a few spoonfuls of tamari. Then, return to the oven for 5 minutes more. We love these added to salads or dragon bowls."

      "TIP: To get the segments from the orange, with a sharp paring knife, cut off the top and bottom of the orange so it will sit evenly on the cutting surface. Using the paring knife, cut down along the peel, following the shape of the fruit, removing any peel and white rind. Hold the fruit in your hand and carefully cut along both sides of each segment, going towards the center to free each segment. If you do this over a plate, you get all the beautiful juices from the fruit to add to the vinaigrette."

Everything should look really dry, but knead all the lumps out until it becomes smooth. Roll out the dough and, using your dog's favorite cookie cutter (in our case, a bone shaped design we found at Joann Fabrics), cut the shapes until there is no more dough left. Place each shape onto a greased cookie sheet. If you want, you can make additional designs on them with a fork. Place them in your oven: preheated to 350\u00b0F After 20 minutes, take them out to flip them over, then place them back in for another 20 minutes, or until they are a nice shade of golden brown."

You will want to reduce the cooking time for chicken tenders since they are a thinner piece of meat and will cook much quicker then a chicken breast.____I listed cayenne pepper as an optional ingredient in this recipe. I like a spicy kick to fried chicken. I probably wouldn't add the cayenne pepper if I was serving it to children._____For the buttermilk: I've used both regular and the low-fat versions. Both work well in this recipe._____For night before prepping: Mix seasoning and flour and put in plastic bag. Put chicken to marinate in buttermilk. Measure out butter and vegetable oil--combine in small covered bowl."

      "Chef's Notes: It is important to add the warm milk to the yoghurt very slowly. If the milk is too hot or is added too quickly, the yoghurt will start to curdle. Although I have said it is okay to use low-fat milk, unless you've found a low-fat or reduced-fat cheese which actually has some flavour, I don't recommend using either of these. The ones I have tried have always been horribly bland, virtually tasteless in fact. I haven't tried this option in this particular recipe, but sometimes 50% of a low-fat cheese and 50% parmesan can be a good compromise (in this recipe, 50g of each instead of the 100g Cheddar). In view of the fat content in this dish, personally I'd prefer to simply opt for making it occasionally and enjoying it - without low-fat compromises!"

      "My slowcooker holds about 12 cups, so adjust the recipe as necessary for the size of your slowcooker. First, rinse the peas. My grocery store sells the peas in 16 oz bags, so I use about half a bag and a little. I simply rinse them by pouring them into a strainer and running them under cold water for a few seconds while I shake. Place the rinsed peas on the bottom layer of the slow cooker. Then dice the ham, and place on the peas. Same with the onion, and add the bay leaf. Here's the secret. Shred the celery and carrot. This will result in a smooth and delicious soup. Once shredded, add to the slowcooker. Chop the garlic, add and then add the salt and pepper (as the soup cooks you can always add more to taste. Finally, add the chicken stock, and then fill the rest of the slowcooker with water until you are about 1/2 inch from the top.",
      "My slow cooker has 3 setting, high, low and auto. I cook this soup on high for 3 hours, then switch to low for another 5. Frankly I don't trust my slow cookers auto setting. I mean, really? How does it know how I want my soup cooked? This recipe will make a very thick soup, which is how I like it. If you like a thinner soup, then add less peas. What I do is make the thick soup, and when I reheat it I add water to thin it out."
