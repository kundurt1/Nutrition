      "I have normally made these in a heavy-duty mixer (Bosch), and when I had to make them by hand, it was much more challenging to avoid over-mixing while getting enough liquid incorporated. The finished texture was quite different. I had to bake them longer because they were doughy in the middle, and then they got too brown. So perhaps if you don't have a mixer, you should pat them thinner (maybe 3/4 inch) and add a little more baking powder to help the rise."

Stir every couple of minutes until most of the broth has absorbed into the rice, about 7-10 minutes. You don't need to stand there and stir it the whole time. Just stir it every minute or two while you clean up or troll the internet. Add another 2 cups of warm broth at this point, and do that whole stir and simmer thing again for another 7 minutes or until the rice tastes slightly undercooked and there's still broth in the pot. Now dump in the asparagus and cook until it's tender and the rice looks like its sitting in a creamy gravy, about 5 more minutes. If it starts looking a little dry before everything is tender, just add some more of the broth a tablespoon at a time.",
      "When the rice and asparagus taste on point, turn off the heat; add the lemon zest, remaining oil, half the chives, and a little pepper. Taste and add more salt, pepper, or whatever you want. Serve right away and top with the remaining chives.",
      "* This kind of rice is starchy, so it will make your risotto extra creamy and delicious. If you can't find it don't worry about it, just grab a short grain rice."

It is important to let them sit undisturbed for 12 hours because the sealing compound on the lids is still cooling and hardening, completing the seal. While the jars cool, you will hear a \"plink\" type sound from each jar - this is the jars completing the vacuum seal as the final air escapes the jar. After 12 hours have passed, remove the bands and check the lids - press down in the center of the lid. If you cannot push the lid down any further, the jar is sealed. If the lid \"gives\" a bit, and you can push it down, the jar did not seal. You can either put the band back on the jar, and reprocess it for another 5 minutes, or you can just put it in the fridge and use it within 3 months."

      "Heat sugar, syrup, & salt to boil in a VERY large stew pot (non-stick pot with no flaking is best). Please note that if you plan on doubling this recipe, you need to use a commercial size stew pot because the ingredients double in size as the temperature rises. Add cream VERY slowly. Cook stirring almost constantly to 239\u00b0F (or until you get just to the point where a little drizzle of cooled caramel gently rubbed between 2 fingers forms into a ball). This takes approximately 3-5 hours. Let cool a few minutes to help prevent sticking to the cookie sheets. Add nuts now if desired. Pour onto 3-4 buttered cookie sheets (cookie sheets should be buttered lightly so as not to end up with greasy caramels). Once cooled completely, flip cookie sheets over to release sheets of caramel (you may have to use a metal spatula to pull the sheet of caramel out of the cookie sheet). Use pizza cutter (if you have cooked them perfectly) or scissors (if you have slightly overcooked them to a stick-to-your-teeth texture) to cut into bite-size pieces. Each piece can now be dipped in chocolate or wrapped \"as is\" in small squares of wax paper (or candy wrappers).",
      "Note: This recipe also works great for caramel sauce -- just don't quite heat it to 239\u00b0F Hard toffee candies can be made if you heat it above 239\u00b0F Therefore, even if you mess up on your attempts to make SOFT caramels, you have SOMETHING left over for your efforts."

      "Add coconut milk, coconut essence (optional), desiccated coconut and icing sugar.",
      "Stir until well mixed.",
      "Recipe says chill so you can roll it into balls, freeze etc, but personally I spooned my mixture into two small plastic bags so that it formed slabs about 2cm thick, then threw it into the freezer for at least 2 hours.",
      "Remove slabs from freezer, peel away plastic bags and\"dice\" your mixture so that you have a plate full of little cubes.",
      "Microwave your dark or milk chocolate mixture until half of it is melted, stir until all is smooth (doing it like this meant that the mixture started to set quickly and evenly around the cubes and didn't just make puddles at their bases).",

      "Place coated cubes onto a tray lined with foil.",
      "Leave at room temperature to set, and store in a cool place (not the fridge).",
      "Edited to add: making the filling into round balls does look more professional and less \"home made\" -- mind you, once your family and friends have tasted these they honestly won't care how they look, they'll be too busy diving back in for another one :).",
      "I loved the suggestion about the other flavours and played around with it -- some of my guests preferred 2T Tia Maria etc for a softer more mellow taste, other preferred theirs with 3T for a stronger taste.",
      "The mixtures with the Baileys/Tia Maria were softer and a little more sticky than the original, so *slightly* more messy rolling them, but your guests will love you for the 10 minutes extra work."
