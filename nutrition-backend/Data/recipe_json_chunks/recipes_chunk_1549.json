A Vitamix works really well for this, and you can let it go for about 5 minutes to get a creamy texture. However, you can use other blenders, and even a baby food blender with cashews soaked overnight with success-you may need to use extra almond milk. This recipe produces way more of the drizzle than you will need, but it is hard to get it to blend with much less than this.",

Reduce the heat to 375\u00b0F and let them bake another 20 minutes.",

Pipe a generous amount onto the bottom of each puff, then close each of them with the tops. Dust the cream puffs with powdered sugar and they are good to go! Enjoy!

Alternatively, you could just take the pieces of dough from in between the cut-out biscuits, place them on a pan and cook them up. Or pat the extra dough into rounded shapes- like a drop biscuit. They may not look as pretty as the first biscuits, but these \"nubbins\" can be just as tasty. I hate to waste dough, especially when it is this good."

    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "Note: Did you know that carrot greens or carrot tops are edible? Yuppers, they are! The other day I picked up a bunch of fresh organic carrots that were on sale with the greens still on them and I got curious: are they edible? I quickly found out that they are and in fact are quite nutritious, rich in vitamins, minerals and proteins. The carrot tops can be used raw or cooked, tossed in salads, used in soups and many other creative ways. I found this great site full of info all about carrot greens and even some recipes; it's called Carrot Museum. On this site they also wrote the following:\"The leaves do contain furocoumarins that may cause allergic contact dermatitis from the leaves, especially when wet. Later exposure to the sun may cause mild photodermatitis. (This is NOT the same as 'poisonous' and it will only affect susceptible people with allergies to the plant. Some people have the same reaction to yarrow, ragwort, chamomile etc.)\" I handled and cooked the greens, we both ate them and we are both still alive, so no allergies for either of us. The taste is quite strong so I would suggest that you use them sparingly at first or taste to see if it's something you like the taste of. The taste was a little bit bitter and very leafy tasting. I wouldn't say I loved the taste but I also didn't hate it. Anyways, I did really like the warm shredded carrot salad that I added the greens to. It was a little sweet and a little garlicky. This is a fast and easy recipe for a great side dish or you could also eat this as a main meal. It is also vegan, healthy and low in calories without skimping on great taste. I served the salad along with steamed white rice and some sauted eggplant for a small vegan meal.",
      "Heat the oil in a large pan then add the finely chopped red onion and saute until soft. Add the garlic, ginger and saute for 3 minutes. Next add the shredded cabbage stir to combine with the pan ingredients, cover and allow the cabbage to soften completely. Once the cabbage is soft, add the carrot and carrot leaves, stirring to combine all of the ingredients well. Lastly, sprinkle in the spices and stir the vegetables well. Continue to cook until the carrots have softened, about another 5 minutes. Serve as a side dish or as a main meal with some steamed white rice. It's delicious as a vegan meal or snack."

      "Cake must be stored in the refrigerator. May be frozen.",
      "Notes:",
      " Since this cake is stored in the fridge and served cold, it is a perfect choice for a make-ahead dessert. This could also be made as 12 cupcakes for individual serving. I would recommend silicone or parchment cupcake cups for easiest removal. Cake is best served at room temperature, so pull out of the refrigerator and plate about 20 minutes before serving, or put a slice in the microwave for about 10 seconds to take the chill off.",

You don't want to cook the dough yet, just warm it enough for it to rise. Let the dough rise for 1 hour or until it has doubled in size.",
      "Transfer the dough to a well floured surface and roll the dough to 1/2\" thickness. Use a donut cutter to cut the donuts and donut holes. If you don't have a donut cutter, you can use 2 different sizes of circle shapes like a drinking glass and bottle top to make your donuts and holes. You will have 20-24 doughnuts and doughnut holes.",
      "Transfer donuts and donut holes to a parchment-lined cookie sheet, cover with a towel, and place back in the oven to rise for an additional 30 minutes.",
      "Pour oil into a medium-sized, high sided pot. For safety's sake, you do not want your oil to be more than 2\" deep, and definitely not more than halfway up the side of the pot. Heat oil to 375\u00b0F. A candy thermometer comes in handy here, but if you don't have one, heat the oil on medium-high heat for about 5-7 minutes. Test your oil temperature with one of the doughnut holes. If it browns too quickly, turn the heat down to medium and wait a minute or two to start frying.",
      "Carefully remove the doughnuts from the cookie sheet and drop one or two at a time into the hot oil. Cook for 45 seconds to 1 minute, or until browned, and carefully turn over using a slotted spoon, tongs, or two chopsticks also works very well. Cook on the other side for 45 seconds to 1 minute. Remove from the oil and place the doughnuts on a paper towel-lined baking sheet to drain.",
      "Let the doughnuts cool slightly before coating with cinnamon sugar mixture or glaze. Once coated with sugar or glaze, let the doughnuts sit on a wire cooling rack over parchment paper or a baking sheet, to catch the dripping glaze, until they are dry.",

You can hollow out fresh bread boules the day before serving and wrap them tightly to keep them soft. When ready to eat, reheat the chili in the microwave for a few minutes, stirring periodically. Scramble your eggs, assemble the dish, broil the cheese on top, and serve.",
      "Other notes: Make sure to wear gloves when working with chiles and avoid touching your eyeballs (or other people's eyeballs. But why would you be doing that? Weirdo.) You can substitute 1/4 cup chili powder and 1/8 to 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper if you don't want to use the dried chiles, but I highly, highly recommend you give it a try. It's so easy, and very gratifying. I was able to find the chiles at my local grocery store. Regarding the beer, if you don't drink alcohol (I don't, either), you should know that only about 5-10% of alcohol will remain in the entire dish by the time you're done. The beer is very important to the flavor and I don't recommend skipping it.",
      "Soak the beans for the chili: In a large stock pot or Dutch oven, bring 8 cups of water, beans, and 1 1/2 teaspoons salt to a boil over high heat. Once boiling, remove the pot from the heat and cover it. Let it stand for 1 hour before draining and rinsing the beans and rinsing out the pot.",

      "Toast ancho chiles in a skillet over medium-high heat, stirring frequently, until they're fragrant (4 to 6 minutes). Reduce the heat if they start to smoke. Place the chiles into the bowl of a food processor and let them cool. Leave the skillet unwashed for future use.",
      "Add the arbol chiles, cornmeal, oregano, cumin, cocoa, and 1/4 teaspoon salt to the food processor with the ancho chiles and pulverize for about 2 minutes, or until finely ground. Then, with the food processor still running, slowly add 1/4 cup of chicken broth until a smooth paste forms (about 45 seconds). Use a spatula to scrape the sides of the bowl as needed. Transfer the paste to a bowl and set aside.",
      "Make the chili:",
      "Put the onions in the food processor and pulse them until they're chopped (about 4 pulses). Add the jalapenos and pulse until the mixture reaches the consistency of a chunky salsa, about 4 more pulses, scraping the bowl if needed.",
      "In your stock pot or Dutch oven, heat 1 1/2 teaspoons of vegetable oil over medium-high heat. Add the onion mixture and cook, stirring occasionally, until the veggies are softened and the moisture has cooked off, about 7 to 9 minutes. Then add the garlic and saute until it's fragrant, just about 1 minute. Add the chili paste, tomatoes, and molasses and stir to combine thoroughly. Add the remaining 1 cup of chicken broth and the drained beans and bring the whole mixture to a boil before reducing the heat to simmer.",
      "Meanwhile, cook the bacon over medium-high heat in your skillet (the one that you used for the ancho chiles) to your desired crispiness. Remove it to drain on a paper towel lined plate.",
      "In the same skillet, cook the chorizo until browned through (add 1 1/2 teaspoons of vegetable oil if needed to supplement the bacon grease). Use a slotted spoon to transfer the cooked chorizo to the Dutch oven. Discard any liquid in the skillet (but don't rub off the stuck-on bits!) and return the skillet to the heat. Add 1/2 of the bottle of lager to the skillet, scraping the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon to loosen any browned bits, and bring it to a simmer. Pour the lager into the Dutch oven. Stir to combine and return the mixture to a simmer.",
      "Cover the Dutch oven and transfer it to the oven. Cook until the meat and beans are fully tender, 11/2 to 2 hours (I kept test-tasting the beans, since they took the longest - mine actually took longer than 2 hours).",
      "While the chili cooks, hollow out 4 sourdough bread boules for serving. If you're not serving the chili today, wrap these tightly to preserve their freshness for the next day. Otherwise, set them aside.",
      "When the chili is finished, let it stand, uncovered, for about 10 minutes. Stir the chili well and season to taste with salt. (Afterwards, you can store it in a Tupperware container in the refrigerator if you're not eating it right away.)",
      "Assemble the dish:",
      "When you're ready to serve your chili, heat 1 tablespoon butter in a skillet over medium heat. Scramble 4 eggs in the butter until the eggs reach your desired doneness and then distribute them evenly between the bread boules. Ladle chili over the eggs in each boule. Top with shredded cheddar and place on a baking sheet that has been covered in foil. Broil on high for a couple of minutes, watching closely, until cheese is melted and bubbly. Serve immediately with cilantro, avocado, chopped onions, and sour cream.",

Wild violet is most often found in shaded, fertile sites and prefers moist soils. Flowers occur in mid-May; usually violet colored, but can vary from deep-blue-violet to completely white. Be sure to pick your flowers from a pesticide free area or purchase them at a specialty market.",

The 1/4-cup measure scoop seems to make a smaller, more manageable pie. Also, try wrapping individual pies in plastic wrap and popping them in the fridge. These taste pretty good cold!",
      "One last tip: try making the cakes with a chocolate boxed cake mix (like Devil's Food) if you don't have time to make it from scratch. Just mix an 18 ounce box of boxed cake mix with ingredients required on back of box. Mix thoroughly and dollop a heaping tablespoonful onto parchment-lined baking sheet about 2 inches apart. Bake for about 12-15 minutes until cakes are firm and spring back to the touch. Continue with above recipe for the filling. You can even change up the cake mix you use, red velvet is wonderful with this filling!",

      "2. Dice up the cucumber (with skin) and slice the radishes. Small dice for these, too.",
      "3. The sausage needs to be of the processed kind for this to work - homemade or deli-made sausage will crumble if you try to dice it. I use polish sausage. It has the perfect smoky/sweet taste. In any case, dice it up.",
      "4. Combine all the diced up ingredients in a big pan.",
      "5. In a separate pan (flat bottom), pour about a half a bottle of Calistoga. Add the tub of sour cream. It will bubble! Slowly dissolve the sour cream in the water - a potato masher works really well (that's why you need a pan with a flat bottom). Combine until you see no lumps at all. Add the other half bottle of water, gently stir. You don't want the water to release all of its carbonation, so be gentle.",
      "6. Pour the water/sour cream mixture over the diced up stuff and gently stir and combine. Add enough mineral water to cover the diced up stuff, and more if you like brothy soup.",
      "7. Small dice the fresh dill into tiny pieces so it releases as much juice as it can. Throw it in to the pan. Add the juice of about half a lemon and some salt.",
      "8. Taste and adjust the salt/lemon combo until you like it. Chill for about an hour and serve with toasted bread. You can garnish it with smoked fish or sprats if you feel like it, but do not put fish in the main pan. It messes with the flavor if it sits in the soup.",
      "The broth for the soup is the contentious part. A lot of people make it on kvas - a fermented drink made from bread and sugar. Others make it with buttermilk instead of sour cream. And there are even those that use chicken broth. I've tried them all and I like this version the most."

It wasn't incredibly sweet, but you could taste a bit of sugar and I prefer a blander bread. Next time I make this, as I loved the texture and the other flavours, I would probably halve the brown sugar amount."

      "In the bowl of a stand mixer, or a large bowl, combine the yeast, warm water, salt, all-purpose flour, and listed amount of the whole wheat flour. With the dough hook attachment, mix to combine all the ingredients. The dough should come together and start to clear the sides of the bowl quite quickly. If it remains really sticky after about a minute of mixing, add more flour, a couple tablespoons at a time until it clears the sides of the bowl.",
      "Knead the dough for 4-5 minutes with a machine, or 8-10 minutes by hand, until it is smooth and elastic, and just tacky to the touch, but not overly sticky. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured counter top and divide it into six equal pieces. Roll each piece into a ball and cover the dough pieces with a clean towel and allow to rest for 10-15 minutes.",
      "On a lightly floured surface, roll each piece of dough into a round disc, about 1/4 inch thick, keeping it as even as possible. If you end up with really thin sections they probably won't puff as well in the oven. Leave the discs on the counter, covered with a clean towel, to rest and rise slightly, for 30-45 minutes.",
      "Preheat the oven to 425 F. If you have a baking stone, place it in the oven to heat up at the same time. If not, line a baking sheet with parchment paper. When you're ready to bake, carefully pick up one pita at a time and flip it onto the hot stone, turning it so the drier side (the one that was facing up) is now on the stone (or lined baking sheet). The side that was on the counter will be more moist and the pita will puff better if this side is facing up. If it's really dry too you can spray them lightly with some water but I didn't find this was necessary.",
      "Bake the pitas (I baked 3 at a time, the others are fine resting on the counter a little longer) for 8-10 minutes until they are lightly browned and puffed up. Sometimes a pita doesn't puff up, but it is still ready so don't leave it in longer. It can still be used as flatbread!",
      "Let the pitas cool completely on a wire rack. Repeat baking the rest. They keep well at room temperature for a couple of days, or can be frozen once they've cooled.",

Or if you aren't using a stand mixer, knead dough by hand on a lightly floured surface until a smooth, elastic and only slightly sticky dough forms, about 10 minutes.

      "Take peanut butter balls out and set up your dipping station: toothpick in ball, ball dipped in melted bowl of chocolate until just before you cover the top, ball placed back on wax sheet, then pull out toothpick and pinch whole closed. Repeat until finished, and then place back in fridge for a few minutes to ensure everything is cold. Enjoy!"

      "Make sure you pre-heat your oven 45 minutes into the final rise to 375 degrees F so that the oven is ready when your loaf is ready to bake. Once the hour of rising is complete, reapply the egg wash to the loaf and then bake it at 375F for 40 minutes. Keep an eye on your loaf because it may brown too quickly. If it does start to brown to quickly, cover it with aluminum foil until the baking time is complete.",
      "Make sure to let your loaf cool for 10-15 minutes after baking or it will be extremely hot and may fall apart a little. This bread is absolutely divine with a little butter and a sprinkle of cinnamon. The apples and the honey are the perfect amount of sweetness to make this bread slightly sweet which also make this a moist and velvety bread...you have to try this one!"

Punch it down on the counter and divide into 10 evenly-sized sections. I weigh the whole ball of dough on a kitchen scale and then divide by ten, weighing each piece to ensure the muffins are the same size. Roll each piece into a ball and then flatten between your palms, forming a disc about three inches across. Place each disc on the cookie sheet at least an inch apart. You should just barely have room for all ten muffins. Cover lightly with plastic wrap and let it rise in a warm place for about 2 hours.",
      "Heat a large frying pan or cast iron skillet over medium heat. When hot, scoop about a tablespoon of shortening into the pan and tilt it so it melts evenly over the pan. Carefully slide a spatula under the muffins on the pan and place them cornmeal-side down in the pan. Don't crowd the pan-you'll probably need to do this in batches. Turn the heat down to medium low and cook for about 8 minutes. Check the underside of the muffins every few minutes to ensure they are not burning. After 8 minutes flip the muffins over and press down on them gently with the back of the spatula. Cook for another 8 minutes. Once the first batch is done, remove them from the pan to a plate. Add a bit more shortening into the pan and continue with remaining muffins (I could only fit four muffins in my pan at a time).",
      "Muffins can be served immediately, and they are truly delicious when fresh! However they also store well. To store, cool completely and store in a zippered bag with the air squeezed out. Store on the counter for 4-5 days or in the freezer for up to a month.",

      "Preheat oven to 350\u00b0 F.",
      "1. In a heavy skillet, heat about 1/4 cup of olive oil. Brown sliced potatoes until golden on both sides. Set aside onto a paper towel lined plate.",
      "2. After potatoes have all been sauteed, add thinly sliced onion to the pan, adding more olive oil if needed. Saute onions until just browned and caramelized. Drain on a paper-towel lined plate.",
      "3. In a generously sized glass pie plate (depth is important here - go for the deep dish model!) layer potatoes and onions.",
      "4. In a separate bowl, using a wire whisk or hand mixer with whisk attachment, mix eggs, whipping cream, and kosher salt together, making sure to mix ingredients completely.",
      "5. Pour egg mixture slowly into the pie plate - you can use a large spoon to divert the flow so as not to disturb your layering.",
      "6. Place the pie plate on a cookie sheet in the oven.",
      "Here's the tricky part - it will take about 30 minutes to cook. Check for doneness by shaking the pie plate slightly to see if egg has set completely. If it's not set - give it another 5 minutes.",
      "A sharp knife will come out of the center of the tortilla clean if it's set completely.",
      "7. Allow to cool on a wire rack for about 5 minutes before serving.",
      "Notes:",
      "When I have this is Spain, my favorite places to order it serve with thinly sliced wedges of cheese - Manchego, Mahon, or my very favorite - Trouchou. And of course, pretty much every Spanish meal comes with a lovely little crusty roll and olive oil to dip your bread in. I, of course, ask for the fabulous local butter!",
      "It is traditional to find Tortilla de Patata listed on menus in the region of Spain that I travel to most often - either with or without onions. If you prefer no onions - just skip that part!"

Once it all comes away from the pan, flip it and place it back on the heat. Place your fillings down the center of the crepe and allow it to sit on the heat for about 30 more seconds. Fold the sides of the crepe over your fillings, gently put the assembled crepe on a plate, and garnish it however you'd like.",

I know it might sound like a lot but it's so worth it. Try not to cheat on the kneading because that's what makes your bread puffier and fluffier. As time passes, you'll feel the dough's texture changing a bit and by the last 2 minutes, it will be a lot easier to knead because of all the air pockets you added by working the dough.",

      "5. When the dough has doubled in size, punch it to remove the excess air and form another ball with it. Once the ball is formed, split it in half then split each ball in 3. In the end, you should have in front of you 6 mini balls of dough. Take each ball and roll them into 6 ropes approximately 12 inches in length. Take the ropes and pinch the ends to merge them together before braiding them. Tuck each end under the bread and transfer it to a baking sheet covered in semolina flour. Cover again with a warm and damp rag and let rise again for 1 hour.",

Add flour - my personal favourite combination for this recipe is 1 cup stone ground whole wheat, 1/2 cup stone ground spelt, 1/4 cup kamut and 1/4 cup quinoa. However, using all whole wheat works just as well. Mix until flour is just combined. Stir in chocolate chips or nuts, or a mixture of the two. Obviously the addition of chocolate chips makes this recipe no longer completely sugar free, but I usually figure I'm doing so well with the whole grain and no sugar that I can afford a little chocolate to balance it out!",

After cooling break the eggshell off the chocolate very carefully or tap the mold on the counter to release the shells.",

To make it easier, you can put the mulling spices in a tea strainer before putting it into the cider. Otherwise, just add them in and turn the heat to medium high heat. Let the cider gently boil with the spices until it reduces by half to one cup. Take it off the heat and let it cool with the spices still steeping in it. While the cider reduces and cools, get the rest of the batter going. Whisk the flour, brown sugar, baking powder, cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves together in a large mixing bowl. Combine the milk, almond extract and egg yolks in another bowl. The egg whites should be separated in another bowl. Use a hand mixer to whip them up completely until they are fluffy and stiff.",

If you just put the spices right in, strain the cider through a fine mesh strainer right into the bowl of milk, egg yolks and almond extract. Whisk those wet ingredients together thoroughly, then whisk them into the dry ingredients until you have a smooth batter. Switch to a spatula to fold in the egg whites without deflating them. Set the batter aside. It's time to make the easy apple syrup. Simply combine the diced apples, water, brown sugar and cinnamon in the same saucepan you made the apple cider in. Bring it to a low boil and let it thicken and become syrupy for about 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. While it cooks, start cooking off the pancakes. Get out an electric griddle and turn it to 350\u00b0F, or heat up a griddle pan over medium high heat.",
      "Grease the griddle with a pat of butter and then scoop the desired amount of batter on to make the size pancakes you want. On my griddle I easily fit 6 decent sized pancakes at a time. Cook them for about 3-4 minutes on each side, until fluffy and golden. Plate them as you cook them in batches and then add a generous amount of the apple syrup on top. Serve immediately and enjoy!"
