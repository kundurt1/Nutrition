Whisk together sugar and cornstarch, and gradually add to egg white mixture, beating at low speed until well blended. Increase speed to high, and beat until stiff peaks form. Fold in vinegar and vanilla. If desired, add a few drops of food coloring, and gently fold it into egg white mixture until well blended.
