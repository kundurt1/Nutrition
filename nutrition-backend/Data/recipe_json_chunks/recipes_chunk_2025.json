      "In a mixing bowl, whisk the flour, salt, and sugar together (if using honey or agave nectar, dissolve it in the lukewarm water instead).",
      "In a separate bowl, whisk the egg and oil together.",
      "Separately, combine the water and milk, then whisk in the yeast until dissolved.",
      "Add the egg mixture and the water mixture to the dry ingredients.",
      "If using a mixer, use the paddle attachment and mix on the lowest speed for 1 minute.",
      "If mixing by hand, use a large spoon and stir for 1 about minute.",
      "The dough should be wet and coarse.",
      "Let the dough rest for 5 minutes to fully hydrate the flour.",
      "Switch to the dough hook and mix on medium-low speed, or continue mixing by hand, for 2 minutes.",
      "The dough will firm up slightly and become smoother.",
      "If its still very wet, add more flour; if its very stiff, add a little more water, 1 tablespoon at a time.",
      "The dough should be very supple and slightly sticky.",
      "Continue to mix with the dough hook on medium-low speed, or mix by hand for 4 minutes more, increasing the speed to medium-high or stirring more vigorously for the final 20 seconds to develop and organize the gluten.",
      "The dough will still be slightly sticky but will also feel stronger and more elastic.",
      "Transfer the dough to a lightly floured work surface with a wet bowl scraper and knead by hand for a final few seconds, working in more flour or water as needed so that the dough is very supple and pliable and slightly sticky; then form the dough into a ball.",
      "Do a stretch and fold, either on the work surface or in the bowl, reaching under the front end of the dough, stretching it out, then folding it back onto the top of the dough.",
      "Do this from the back end and then from each side, then flip the dough over and tuck it into a ball.",
      "Cover the dough and let it rest for 10 minutes.",
      "Repeat this entire process two more times, completing all repetitions within 30 minutes.",
      "Place the dough in a clean, lightly oiled bowl large enough to hold the dough when it doubles in size.",
      "Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap, then immediately refrigerate overnight or for up to 4 days.",
      "(If you plan to bake the dough in batches over different days, you can portion the dough and place it into two or more oiled bowls at this stage.)",
      "Remove the dough from the refrigerator about 3 hours before you plan to bake.",
      "Transfer the dough to a lightly floured work surface and divide it into two equal pieces for loaves or small pieces for rolls, about 2 ounces each.",
      "Shape the dough into sandwich loaves (see page 23), freestanding loaves (see page 20), or rolls (see page 25).",
      "For sandwich loaves, place the dough in greased 4 1/2 by 8 1/2-inch loaf pans.",
      "For freestanding loaves or rolls, line a sheet pan with parchment paper or a silicone mat and proof the dough on the pan.",
      "Mist the dough with spray oil and cover loosely with plastic wrap, then let the dough rise at room temperature for 2 to 3 hours, until increased to about 1 1/2 times its original size.",
      "In loaf pans, the dough should dome about 1 inch above the rim.",
      "About 15 minutes before baking, preheat the oven to 350F (177C).",
      "If making rolls, brush the dough with egg wash (see page 135) prior to baking.",
      "(This isnt necessary for loaves.)",
      "Bake loaves for 20 minutes, then rotate; rotate rolls after 10 minutes.",
      "The total baking time is 40 to 55 minutes for loaves, and only about 20 minutes for rolls.",
      "The bread is done when the top and sides are a deep, rich brown; the loaf sounds hollow when thumped on the bottom; and the internal temperature is above 185F (85C) in the center.",
      "Remove from the pans and cool for at least 20 minutes for rolls and at least 1 hour for loaves before slicing or serving.",
      "For a stronger, more elastic dough, add 2 tablespoons (0.5 oz / 14 g) of vital wheat gluten (sometimes called pure wheat gluten).",
      "This will create a lighter loaf with larger air pockets.",
      "Increase the water by 1/4 cup (2 oz / 56.5 g).",
      "You can also omit the milk and replace it with more water, but milk makes the bread a little more tender and golden.",
      "Another option is to substitute soy milk or rice milk.",
      "You can easily make a multigrain version of this bread.",
      "As long as you use whole wheat flour for at least 80 percent of the total flour, there will be enough gluten to support the loaf.",
      "This means you can replace up to 20 percent of the whole wheat flour with an equal amount of other grains (by weight), in a variety of forms, including rye flour, multigrain cereal blends, cornmeal, and flaked or rolled grains like oats or triticale flakes.",
      "(If using flakes, you can use them in flaked form or grind them into flour in a seed grinder or blender.)",
      "You can also use small-seeded grains like amaranth, chia seeds, millet, and quinoa.",
      "Amaranth and chia are about the only grains that can go into a loaf whole, without being rolled or ground into flakes, meal, or flour.",
      "Slightly larger grains, like millet, quinoa, and corn grits, can also be left whole if you like the crunch they provide.",
      "If you want to use larger grains like rice, rye, barley, or wheat in their whole form, thoroughly cook them first, as they wont hydrate in the dough and could crack a tooth.",
      "To win someone over from white bread to 100 percent whole grain bread, it may help to have a transitional version that bridges the gap.",
      "You can replace some of the whole wheat flour in this recipe with an equal amount of unbleached bread flour (by weight) to make a lighter loaf.",
      "Reduce the amount of water by about 1/2 tablespoon (0.25 oz or 6 g) for every 1 ounce (28.5 g) of bread flour you use.",

      "Once the truffle mixture seems ready, leave it in the fridge while you melt the dipping chocolate.",
      "I prefer to do this in a double boiler to lessen the chance of burning, but you can do this in the microwave if you prefer, using the previously mentioned method (it will take longer than the chips because it's more chocolate).",
      "While your dipping chocolate is melting, you can start rolling your truffles.",
      "Remove the bowl from the fridge and scoop your truffles using a regular teaspoon, or a #60 cookie scoop.",

      "Allow the excess coating to drip off over the pan, then carefully place the truffle back on the wax paper without rolling it over (you'll have naked spots if you allow them to roll while the coating is wet, and will need to re-dip them).",
      "These will harden up pretty quickly, so it's best to add your decorations (sugar crystals, little sugar-mold decorations, sprinkles) while your coating is still pretty wet.",
      "Don't worry if your coating hardens up too quickly for you, though, because you can always add a dab of wet coating, or redip your hardened truffles (this will just give you a thicker coating, no big deal).",
      "Once fully hardened, you can place these in little confection cups for presentation.",
      "Store truffles in the fridge, but allow them to warm up a bit prior to serving."
