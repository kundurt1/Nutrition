Repeat for the rest of the eggs. Cook the eggs for about maximum 1 1/2 to 2 minutes each if you like your yolk runny and about 2 1/2 to 3 minutes if you like your yolk fully cooked. Test out the first egg and gauge from the time it took for that one and how cooked it is. Every stovetop is different.",

      "Now add your wet ingredients: egg, vanilla, and 1/2 cup of liquid.",
      "You can use anything you want for the liquid! Orange juice makes a very bright pancake, milk makes a richer pancake. A mix of 1/4 cup water and 1/4 cup buttermilk makes the fluffiest pancake you can imagine, and plain old water works wonderfully as well. I use just water most of the time. Experiment with other liquids! Try apple cider or coffee or even chocolate milk! (Then let me know how they turn out, because I haven't tried them myself. They're probably great, though!)",

That's why you have your oven warm! However, if you have a large enough skillet there's no reason not to do them all at once. I could make 2 at once if I was better at pouring them without having them run into each other, but I'm not, so I make one at a time.",
      "Here's a tip: run the edge of the turner you will be using along a stick of butter. This will allow it to slide more easily under the pancake. I like to do this for each pancake flip.",
      "When you see bubbles make it to the surface of your pancake, and the edges look firm instead of wet, flip it over, and finish cooking it. You'll see it rise a little, and then watch the edges to see when they look fully cooked. The pancake is done about 30 seconds after the edges look fully cooked.",

Start the mixer and add the flour one cup at a time until the dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl. Up to 6 cups of flour may be needed. Dough should be slightly sticky but workable.

While the oil is heating, roll the dough out onto the counter, without flour, into a large rectangle about 1/2 inch thick. You can butter the counter lightly. Using a pizza cutter or knife, cut into squares or triangles. Makes approximately 24 scones.",

      "Pierce the cooled cake all over the top with the tines of a fork or a thin wooden skewer. We are talking all over! The more pokes, the more the syrup will soak into the cake. Using a large spoon or ladle, spoon some of the milk syrup over the cake. Let the syrup soak into the cake, then continue spooning the syrup on top until all of it has been used up. When you have finished, not all of the syrup will be completely absorbed and might be pooling on the top but that's ok because it will absorb as it refrigerates. Cover the cake loosely with plastic wrap and refrigerate until all of the syrup is absorbed, 2 hours.",
      "Cut the bananas, if using, crosswise into 1/4-inch slices. Slice the cake and serve it with sliced bananas, sweetened cream and toasted coconut, if desired."

If the sauce is too thick, you can gradually add more beer as you whisk until you reach a desired consistency.",

      "1. Once the pretzels have cooled, you may freeze them in a resealable freezer bag. To thaw, leave at room temperature or microwave each pretzel until heated through (times vary depending on microwave).",
      "2. If you have leftover cheese sauce, it will keep in the refrigerator for up to a week. To reheat, simply transfer to a saucepan and heat on medium-low heat. Add a few splashes of milk to get a creamy consistency going again, and once you have a creamy consistency, remove from heat and serve."

If using a stand mixer, alternate between adding the dates and oil. If you're using a food processor, before you add any dates, rub oil on the blade and inside of the bowl. Once processed, oil your hands and knead the cake spice mix into the dates.",

      "4. Combine the oil and clarified butter in a separate small saucepan and cook over medium heat until the butter is just melted, about 2 minutes; cool slightly.",

Knead the dough until it comes together nicely into a shaggy dough, adding up to 4 tablespoons more flour as needed (when done, the dough will be soft and should look smooth, shiny, and slightly oily). Cover the dough, put it in the freezer to stiffen slightly, about 5 to 10 minutes, and then knead it again for a couple minutes.",

To shape the cookies with a ma'amoul mold (see note below), measure 1 slightly scant tablespoon of dough and roll it into a ball; slightly flatten it with your hands, then press it into the bottom and up the sides of the mold. Measure 1 teaspoon of the date mixture and roll it into a ball; slightly flatten it and gently press it into the dough in the mold. Measure 1 slightly scant teaspoon of dough, roll it into a ball, slightly flatten it, then put it on top of the date mixture in the mold; use your fingers to press the dough on the top into the dough on the sides. To remove the cookie from the mold, hold the mold by the handle and tap the flat rim on a secure surface; the cookie will drop right out.",
      "8. Arrange the cookies on the baking sheets about 1/2 to 1 inch (1 1/4 to 2 1/2 cm) apart (if you use 2 half-sheet pans, the cookies should all fit on 2 pans; if you use smaller pans you will need to cook them in 2 batches). Bake until light golden brown on the bottom, about 20 to 25 minutes, rotating the trays once.",

      "Ma'amoul mold: In this recipe I give directions for how to shape these cookies with a ma'amoul mold, which can be purchased at Middle Eastern grocery stores or online. However, these cookies can also be shaped by hand. To do so, measure 1 slightly scant tablespoon of dough and roll it into a ball; slightly flatten it with your hands, then hold it in the palm of 1 hand. Measure 1 teaspoon of the date mixture and roll it into a ball; slightly flatten it and gently press it into the dough in your hand. Measure 1 slightly scant teaspoon of dough, roll it into a ball, slightly flatten it, then put it on top of the date mixture; use your fingers to press the dough on the top into the dough on the sides. Use your hands to gently shape it into a circle, and then use a fork to make a decorative cross-hatch pattern on the top.",
      "Mahlab: This spice is the seed kernel that comes from the center of St. Lucie Cherry pits; it has a lovely aroma and tastes like a cross between almonds and cherries. You can usually find mahlab at specialty spice stores or Middle Eastern grocery stores. If you can't find it, although the flavor won't be quite the same, for a similar flavor you could add a couple drops of pure almond extract.",
      "Extra date filling: If you have extra date filling, wrap it well and freeze for up to 6 months. When you're ready to use it, let it thaw in the fridge overnight, then knead a little bit of canola oil into it until smooth.",
      "Clarified butter (ghee): I don't recommend replacing the ghee in this recipe with regular butter because of the different water content. Clarified butter can commonly be found at regular grocery stores or easily made at home.",

Pour wet ingredients into dry ingredients and stir until it starts to form a dough. With clean hands, bring it all together into a firm ball. Put it between two large sheets of parchment paper and flatten it into a disc. Roll it out to be a 10-inch or so circle so that it easily fits the pie dish. To easily get it into the dish, remove the top sheet of parchment, then flip the bottom one right into the pie dish and peel it away. Press the dough firmly into the dish and trim away any excess. Use a fork to make a nice finish around the edge and use the excess to make any pretty decorations you wish. Chill the crust and any decorations for 30 minutes.",
      "While it chills, make the easy filling. Preheat the oven to 450\u00b0F first. I find the quickest way to cook the sweet potatoes are to microwave them for 10 minutes. Be sure to prick them all over with a fork first so they don't burst. Let them cool enough to handle, then cut them in half and scoop the flesh right out of the skin into the measuring cup to measure it and mash it in a big mixing bowl. Then add all of the remaining filling ingredients in and whisk it all together thoroughly until smooth. Pour it into the chilled crust and bake it for 10 minutes at 450\u00b0F, then reduce the heat to 350\u00b0F and bake it for another 45 minutes. Let it cool completely and chill for a few hours or overnight. Serve and enjoy!!"

      "First, make the dough. Get out a stand mixer and fit it with the dough hook attachment. Combine the flour, brown sugar, pumpkin pie spice, yeast, and salt in its bowl. Then take the butter and melt it in a microwave safe bowl or glass measuring cup in the microwave. Then stir in the buttermilk and pumpkin puree and microwave it for another 45 seconds. This will bring it to the right temperature for the yeast. Pour the liquid mixture into the stand mixer bowl with everything else and turn the hook onto low speed. As it starts to come together, add in the egg and let the whole thing knead together on the dough hook for 8-10 minutes. It should start to pull away completely from the bowl and be fairly easy to work with. Lift the dough out of the bowl momentarily and spray the bowl with a little cooking spray. Put the dough back in, cover it with plastic wrap and set it in a warm, dry place to rise until it doubles in size. It should take about an hour.",
      "When the hour is about up, make sure you have the filling ingredients ready to go. At this point you should also make sure your cream cheese is out softening. The melted butter should be in one bowl, and then whisk the brown sugar, cinnamon and pumpkin pie spice together in another bowl. Also get out a 9 x 13-inch baking pan, line it with foil and spray the foil with more cooking spray. Then take the dough and turn it out onto a clean, well floured surface. Roll it out into a 26 x 13 inch rectangle, using the baking pan as a reference so you don't have to find a ruler. Brush the rectangle with the butter so that it has a thick layer of melted butter as a base, leaving a small border around the edges. Then sprinkle the brown sugar mixture in an even layer on the butter, lightly pressing it into the butter so that it sticks. Take the long side and roll it up really tightly around the filling to get a nice swirl. Take a sharp knife and make little knife marks about an inch and half apart to mark where you want to cut the rolls before you actually do the cutting. It is important the knife is nice and sharp so that it doesn't squish the rolls when you do cut it. With the 26 inch length, you should get about 12 rolls total when you cut them. Place them lined up with some space between them in the prepared pan. I did 4 rows of 3. Set them aside to rise for another hour.",
      "When the hour is almost up, preheat oven to 375\u00b0F. Bake the rolls for about 15-17 minutes, until golden and baked through. While they bake, make the icing. Combine the cream cheese, powdered sugar and creamer in a bowl and use a hand mixer to whip it all together until it is a thick but still pourable icing. When the rolls are done, pour the glaze on them and spread it out evenly with a spatula while they are still hot. Serve immediately and enjoy! They also keep well in the refrigerator for up to 4 days, just reheat in the microwave for about 20-30 seconds."

      "Then as butter begins to get cut into the flour, increase mixer speed to medium and add vanilla. Continue mixing dough until it just comes together. Now roll dough out on a floured silicone baking mat or use a lightly floured piece of parchment paper. Roll dough to 1/4-inch thickness and cut into 3-inch heart shapes.",
      "Place cookies on baking pans lined with parchment paper. These cookies are flaky and slightly delicate so the parchment paper makes them easy to handle. Bake cookies for 8 to 10 minutes until edges begin to turn golden.",

      "Remove frosting from heat. Add food coloring. It's easier to control the color if you take a few tablespoons of the white icing out and place in a small bowl. Then add a drop or two of desired food coloring. Once you get this concentrated color, add a little of that concentrated icing back to the main mixture until you get the exact shade you want. Once you get the icing mixed, it's time to frost the cookies.",
      "Take a cookie and hold it over the pan and spoon a little icing on top. Then tilt cookie slightly to allow the icing to evenly cover the top. Once it is covered well, take the edge of a rubber spatula or table knife and push any drips or excess icing off the edges of the cookie for a smooth finish. Immediately add sprinkles or sanding sugar on top. If you wait, then the icing will set and the sprinkles won't stick. So frost and sprinkle one cookie at a time. Stir icing from time to time and if it starts to cool in the pan, you can heat it slightly on low. The icing will cool and set on your cookies in about 20 to 30 minutes.",
      "Once icing is set, you can stack cookies. They keep well at room temperature, which makes them great for sharing."

Cover it and store it in the refrigerator until you are ready to fill the cannolis. Then, start on the shells. Set up a food processor and combine the flour, pumpkin spice and salt in its bowl. Pulse it a few times to aerate the dry ingredients. Add the butter and egg yolk and pulse it more to make the mixture pebbly. Finally, with the processor running slowly pour in the coffee creamer and cold water until it comes together into a soft dough.",
      "Bring the dough together into a ball and turn it out onto a clean surface, preferably parchment paper. Knead it for a couple of turns to bring it together. Then cut it in half and roll the first half out thin enough to go through a pasta roller. Put the first half through the pasta roller twice on the widest setting, then twice more on the third widest setting. It will be very long, so cut it in half to make it more manageable. Repeat the process with the other half of the dough.",
      "Use a 3 1/2 inch square cutter to cut out perfect squares from the dough. You should be able to get 6 from each sheet for 24 shells total. Then fill a large stainless steel skillet with deep sides with about 3 inches of the vegetable oil. Heat it up over medium high heat and use a deep fry thermometer to make sure the temperature gets to and stays around 350. Use cannoli molds to form the shells by wrapping the squares tightly around them with two of the corners overlapping in the middle. It's like closing a diamond. Press the overlapping corners together firmly and seal the two corners together by brushing them with the egg white.",
      "Fry the cannoli shells in batches of 4-6 for about 3 minutes, until the shells get crispy and golden. Remove them to a plate lined with paper towel to let them drain and cool. Then gently slide the shells off of the molds and form the next batch. Be sure to keep monitoring the oil heat. Once the shells are all fried and completely cooled, transfer the filling to a large pastry bag. Fill all of the shells generously, then sprinkle the cannolis with powdered sugar on top using a sifter. Serve immediately for an amazing dessert! The two components can also be made ahead. Just fill and dust the cannolis before serving so that the shells don't get soggy."

Let it bubble and cook just until it starts to get brown and nutty smelling. Take it off of the heat immediately to set it aside and let it cool. Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F and line a 12-well cupcake pan with paper liners.",
      "Whisk the flour, baking powder, baking soda, pumpkin pie spice and salt together in a bowl to aerate the dry ingredients and set the bowl aside. Combine the brown sugar and cooled brown butter in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Cream them together until smooth. Add the eggs one at a time followed by the vanilla extract. Once they are mixed in, turn the speed to low and slowly add 1/3 of the dry ingredients followed by 1/2 of the pumpkin puree. Then add the next 1/3 of the dry ingredients followed by the last of the pumpkin puree. Finish with the last of the dry ingredients until it is a smooth batter.",
      "Use a 1/3 cup measure to scoop even amounts of the batter into each lined cupcake well. Bake the cupcakes for about 15-20 minutes, until puffed up and completely baked through. Insert a toothpick in the center of a few of them to see if they are done. It should come out clean. Let the cupcakes cool for 10 minutes or so in the pan, then remove them to a rack to finish cooling completely.",
      "While the cupcakes bake and cool, prepare the luscious salted caramel buttercream. You will need to wash out the stand mixer bowl and paddle attachment. Add the softened butter to the bowl and beat it until fluffy and smooth. Add in the salted caramel sauce, pumpkin pie spice and salt and let it all get well combined. Turn the speed to low and slowly add in the powdered sugar until it becomes a fluffy, smooth frosting. Cover the stand mixer bowl and let the frosting firm up and set a bit in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.",
      "The cupcakes should be completely cool about the same time as the frosting is set. Frost each cupcake using either an offset spatula or a pastry bag. Drizzle a little additional salted caramel on top of the cupcakes and serve immediately! These"

With your fingers, gently grab the edges of the circle and pinch them together on top of the Nutella, in the center to once again create a ball shape. Very gently roll it around between your palms to smooth out the ball. Repeat with the rest of the dough. This will make approximately 15-18 churro bites depending on how big or small you make the balls.",

Remove from heat and stir in dissolved baking soda. Be cautious as baking soda causes the mixture to rise and bubble. When bubbles subside, return to heat.",
      "Simmer mixture over medium-low to medium heat, stirring at least every 10-15 minutes to ensure caramel does not burn. You don't want the mixture to be boiling; however, it should be at a rapid simmer (otherwise this process may take seemingly forever). Continue to cook for about 1 to 1 1/2 hours or until mixture takes on a deep caramel color and is a syrupy consistency. After about 45 minutes, I tasted the sauce and removed the cinnamon stick as it was cinnamon-flavored enough for me at this point. Stir in the bourbon during the last few minutes of cooking. Before serving, also discard the vanilla bean pods. If using vanilla extract, stir in with the bourbon.",
      "For the waffles:",
      "While cajeta sauce cooks, prepare waffle batter. Combine flour, sugar, baking powder and spices in a large bowl. Combine pumpkin, milk, egg, and vanilla in another bowl. Add wet ingredients to dry ingredients, stirring just to combine. Stir in melted butter. Do not over-mix. Allow batter to rest for 15 minutes or up to an hour at room temperature.",
      "Meanwhile, heat waffle iron. Grease iron, ladle in batter and cook according to manufacturer's directions. For my iron, I scoop about 1/2 cup of batter per waffle. Repeat process with remaining batter. Reheat cajeta sauce for several seconds in the microwave if prepared ahead of time. Serve waffles with cajeta sauce, pepitas and whipped cream. Enjoy.",
      "Note: After some experimentation, I learned my waffle iron produces the most perfectly cooked-through, crispy waffles at the medium heat setting for 2 1/2 to 3 minutes. The indicator light that shows your waffles are ready is not always the most accurate measure of doneness. The ideal temperature and cook time will vary largely depending on the thickness and composition of your batter."

    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "First, prepare the pretzel crust. Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F and liberally grease the bottom of an 8 x 8 baking dish with softened butter or shortening. Put the pretzels in the bowl of a food processor and run it until they become a fine crumb. Combine the pretzel crumbs with the butter, dark brown sugar and pumpkin pie spice in a bowl. Stir them together thoroughly until it resembles wet sand. Pour the mixture into the prepared baking dish and press it down firmly into an even bottom crust. Bake it for 15 minutes to set, then take it out and let it cool.",
      "While the crust bakes and cools, prepare the brownie batter first. Whisk the flour, baking powder, salt and cinnamon together in a bowl to aerate them. Set it aside. Get a small pot filled halfway with water on the stove and heat it to a gentle boil. Set a heat proof bowl over the pot and combine the butter and chocolate in it to melt them. Stir them together with a heat proof rubber spatula until it is a smooth and shiny ganache. Remove the bowl from the heat and whisk the sugar in to dissolve it. Then whisk in the vanilla and eggs. Lastly, fold in the dry ingredients just until they disappear. Set the brownie batter aside.",
      "Next, prepare the pumpkin cheesecake batter. Combine the cream cheese and pumpkin puree a bowl and beat them together with a hand mixer until smooth. Add the brown sugar and pumpkin pie spice next and let them get mixed in. Then add the bourbon, vanilla, and each egg one at a time. Once they are thoroughly mixed in, add the flour last just until it disappears. Set the cheesecake batter aside.",
      "Take the baking dish with the cooled crust and liberally grease the sides. Spread the brownie batter on top of the crust, leaving about 3 tablespoons behind for swirling on top. Smooth it out with an offset spatula. Pour the cheesecake batter over the brownie batter and make sure it is even. Spoon the remaining brownie batter in with the cheesecake batter and use a butter knife to gently swirl it together.",
      "Bake the cheesecake brownies for 40-45 minutes, until set and completely baked through. The cheesecake should be fairly brown around the edges. Let it cool, then cover it and let it chill in the refrigerator for at least 3 hours. Then cut the brownies into 16 equal squares by quartering the pan, then cutting each quarter into quarters. Serve immediately and enjoy!"

      "Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F.",
      "In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg and allspice. Set aside.",
      "In another bowl, whisk together the pumpkin, buttermilk, coconut oil (or butter), brown sugar and egg until combined. Pour the dry ingredients into the center of the wet mixture and toss the blueberries right on top of the flour mixture.",
      "Using a rubber spatula or wooden spoon, fold the ingredients together gently but quickly until just combined (over mixing might cause the muffins to be dense instead of light and fluffy). It's ok if the batter is slightly lumpy; it will be thick.",
      "Lightly grease a 12-cup muffin tin or line with paper liners (lightly grease the paper liners, if using). Fill the muffin cups 3/4 full and bake for 20-25 minutes until the tops spring back lightly and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Remove the muffins from the tin and let cool completely on a cooling rack.",
      "Recipe slightly adapted from a recipe sent to me by a longtime reader, Lindsey R (thanks, Lindsey!). I added nutmeg, cut down on the sugar and oil a bit.",
      "Notes:",
      "1. My preference when using whole wheat flour in baking recipes is to use the hard white wheat variety. Any whole wheat flour can be used but red wheat will make the muffins slightly more dense and hearty. All-purpose flour could be subbed for the whole wheat, if needed.",
      "2. You could try using yogurt or sour cream in place of the buttermilk but I haven't tried it so I'm not sure how it would work. Making your own buttermilk is really easy if you don't keep it on hand. If you buy/make milk kefir, I've made these muffins using that instead of buttermilk, also, and it works great.",
      "3. These were deliciously and lightly sweet with the 3/4 cup brown sugar. You could certainly try cutting back the sugar even more or substituting honey or another type of sweetener. Have fun experimenting!"
