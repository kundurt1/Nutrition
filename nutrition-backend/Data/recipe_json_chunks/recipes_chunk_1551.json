Tip: Putting your mixing bowl and beaters in the fridge or freezer ahead if time will speed up this process. Add 2/3 of chilled strawberry puree to the cream mixture and mix well.

      "Now, bake the crust at 350\u00b0F for 7-8 minutes, until edges are lightly golden brown. Your crust will probably rise in a few areas. Once it's out of the oven, use a small spoon to quickly press it all back down, making sure to not leave any cracks in the crust.",
      "As soon as the crust comes out of the often, sprinkle the chopped nuts on top, and lightly press them into the crust. Then sprinkle on the chocolate chips evenly, followed by the coconut flakes.",
      "Pour the coconut milk mixture evenly over the top of the surface. Gently shake the pan around until the coconut milk mixture begins to sink between the layers. Drizzle with 1 tablespoon of the melted almond butter.",
      "Place into the oven and bake until the sides are lightly golden brown, about 27-28 minutes. Remove from the oven and cool to room temperature. Drizzle with remaining almond butter, cover and refrigerate overnight.",

      "Notes:",
      "1. The coconut flour I usually use needed 3/4 cup, but I also tried it with a different brand and 66g was only 1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon. So please weigh your flour first before trying to make the crust.",
      "2. It's very important to have the final amount of coconut milk mixture be 1 cup. So I recommend checking it around 16 minutes. If you have more than that, pour it back into the pan and simmer a few minutes longer.",
      "3. You absolutely need to let these sit overnight to make sure the coconut milk really has a chance to chill and thicken."

It should still be somewhat pliable but not really jiggly. Hardening it in the freezer also helps with cutting so that it's cleaner.",

Combine the sugar and egg in a bowl and whip them together for 3-4 minutes, until the mixture is really pale and airy. It should expand too. Then switch to a spatula and gently fold in the flour just until it disappears. Scoop a tablespoon of the dough into the wells of the tin, there will be enough for 10. Make sure they are even, then bake the cakes for 8-9 minutes. Let them cool for a couple of minutes in the tin, they should pull away from the sides. Then put them on a rack to finish cooling completely.",
      "Now it's time for assembly. Take the hardened jello and use a 2-inch round cutter to cut 10 discs out of it. Place one on top of each little cake. Then put the chocolate in a microwave safe bowl and microwave it for a minute. Stir it, then microwave it for another 30 seconds so that it is completely melted. Spoon the chocolate over each cake, trying to be as neat as you can. Let the chocolate completely harden, then serve the cakes with a yummy hot beverage! Enjoy!"

Allow the cookie pops at least 1 hour for the frosting to set before picking them up. Tie a fall-colored bow to each lollipop stick if you wish. Store in a resealable bag for up to a week."

Punch it down one more time, cover it again and let it sit in the refrigerator overnight.",

Take out the dough and pat it out into a square that is about two inches thick on the plastic wrap that you covered it with. Cut it into thirds, then cut each third into thirds. Round each piece into a ball and put three balls of dough into each loaf pan. Let them sit in the loaf pans to rise one more time for an hour.",

They should be completely golden brown on top and baked through. Immediately brush them with the melted butter. Let them cool for 10 minutes or so, then turn them out onto racks to finish cooling.

      "2. Filling: First of all, please please please do not use light or fat free cream cheese or Cool Whip. You need the full fat versions of both of these or else your cream filling won't set up correctly. I'm not pretending this is a diet pie, so just go with the full fat stuff.",

      "4. Final Assembly: Allow the curd to cool for 10-20 minutes on the counter before moving to the refrigerator. Once it is completely chilled, spread the curd over the cream layer.",
      "Refrigerate the entire pie for at least 15 minutes (longer is better if you can stand to wait) before serving. I also like to add a ring of whipped cream rosettes around the outside of the pie. It dresses up the edge and creates a nice finished look.",
      "Warning: Remember when I told you that you absolutely must use full fat cream cheese and Cool Whip? Well here is why: Without enough fat in the cream layer, the filling won't set up correctly. As soon as you take out a slice, the curd will slide down due to not enough support from the cream layer and your whole pie will be a smush.",
      "It tastes just fine, but it's not pretty. If you're going to try for a low-fat version, you might as well just toss some vanilla ice cream in a bowl and top it with the lemon curd because that's exactly what your pie will look like.",

Wrap the dough in Saran wrap and place in the freezer for 30 minutes or in the refrigerator for 2 hours.",

      "2. Stir in thyme, rosemary, and garlic. Then add the flour to evenly coat the veggies. One cup at a time, pour in the broth and stir.

Allow the stew to simmer on medium heat while stirring.",

When time is up, turn the dough out onto a well floured, clean surface and roll it out into a large, really thin disc. Get out an 8 inch springform pan and spray it really well with cooking spray. Press the disc into the pan. Don't worry if it falls apart, just patch it up. Let the dough chill again for another 30 minutes in the pan.",
      "Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F. Take out the crust and line it with aluminum foil. Fill the foil with either dry beans or pie weights to keep the crust from puffing while blind baking it. Bake it for 15 minutes. Then take it out and remove the foil and beans. Bake it for another 5 minutes to cook the bottom. Take it out again and brush it all over with the beaten egg. Bake it for 5 more minutes until it is golden. Take it out and let it cool completely. At this point, trim the top to take care of any scraggly edges and cracks on top. Reduce the oven heat to 285\u00b0F and start on the filling.",
      "For the filling, combine the eggs, egg yolks, sugar, and the lime and lemon zest and juice. Use an electric hand mixer to blend them all together well. Then add the heavy cream and green food coloring if desired. Keep mixing it for another minute or so to make sure it is completely smooth and well blended. Then pour the mixture into a sauce pan and gently heat it up over medium low heat on the stove. It was about 4 on my gas stove. Stir it continuously for about 10-15 minutes until it becomes thick and the texture of pudding. Keep an eye on the temperature, do not let it boil or else the eggs will scramble.",
      "Pour the mixture into the cooled crust and bake the pie for about 10 minutes. It should be set but wobble just slightly. Set it aside to cool while you make the meringue topping. Put a small pot filled halfway with water on the stove and bring it to a gentle simmer. Combine the egg whites, sugar and coconut extract in a heat proof bowl and set it over the simmering water. Whisk it together while it gently heats up to dissolve the sugar and cook the eggs. The eggs will almost be opaque when they are perfect. Then take the bowl off of the heat and use a hand mixer to whip it up into a stiff, shiny meringue.",
      "Spread the meringue in a thick layer on top of the custard filling, making little swirls in it. Bring the oven heat back up to 350\u00b0F and put the pie in to crisp up the meringue for 10-15 minutes. It should start to brown. Take it out and sprinkle lots of shredded coconut on top, then put it back in for about 5-10 more minutes to toast the coconut and brown the meringue more. Let the pie cool when it is done for 15 minutes, then release it from the pan. Chill it for at least 3 hours, then serve!"

Cool to room temperature, then refrigerate until fully chilled, about 1 hour (up to 3 days is fine).",

Add water 1 tablespoon at a time, working the dough together with your fingertips just until it comes together, and only adding enough water so the dough comes together when you squeeze it. Gather the dough together into a ball and then flatten it into a disk. Wrap it in plastic wrap and refrigerate until chilled, about 30 minutes.",

Lay a piece of parchment paper out on your work surface, place the dough on the prepared parchment paper, and top with another piece of parchment (or if you have it, freezer paper works even better because it's thicker). Done this way, there is no need for flour to roll the dough out. Working from the center out, roll the dough out to a circle about 12 inches in diameter. Use a 4-inch cookie cutter (or a glass with that diameter) to stamp out circles in the dough.",

Use a thin metal spatula to lift up one circle of dough, then fold the dough over onto itself to form a half-moon, pressing the pastry closed along the outside. Set the pastry down on a flat surface and crimp the edges with a fork. Repeat with the rest of the dough circles. Then gather the scraps of dough, re-roll them, and repeat until the dough and filling are gone (you should get about 8 to 10 pastries). You can chill the dough scraps at any point if it becomes too difficult to re-roll them.",

Combine the egg and water in a small bowl. Brush the top of each pastry with the egg wash (you will have extra egg wash, don't try to use it all) and sprinkle the 1 1/2 teaspoons of sugar on top (this amount is enough for all the pastries; you just need a little bit on each).",

      "For the CAKE:",
      "Preheat your oven to 350 degrees.",
      "Cream the butter and sugar until the mixture with a mixer until it turns a light shade of yellow. Next add the condensed milk and beat well.",
      "Add the flour, baking soda, and salt in 5 parts and blend well. Add the eggs one at a time and blend. Add vanilla and blend.",
      "Grease and flour two 8\" round pans and pour the batter evenly amongst the two. The batter should be kind of thick, so you might have to use a spatula to smooth it out and make it even.",
      "Put it in the oven and bake for 45-55 minutes. Poke the center of the cake with a toothpick, and if it comes out clean, then it's done. Transfer the cake to a cooling rack and allow to sit until cool.",
      "While the cake is baking, make your simple RUM SYRUP:",
      "In a sauce pan, bring the water and rum to a boil. Add the sugar and vanilla and allow it to reduce until it resembles the consistency of corn syrup - just not quite as thick. Allow it to cool.",
      "Once the cake is done, cut each layer in half so you'll have a 4-layer cake. If you have a cake leveler this would be a good time to whip it out.",
      "Slice the cake loaves in half horizontally. Once you have the four pieces, take a pastry brush (I use silicone so the bristles won't stick to the cake, but any will work) and begin brushing the simple syrup over the layers. Allow it to soak through and repeat until the cake looks moist. Set aside.",
      "Now for the FROSTING:",
      "Beat the butter and shortening until smooth. Next begin to add the sugar one cup at a time. Beat well. Add the vanilla rum, vanilla extract and salt and continue to beat until smooth. Voila, your frosting is done.",
      "Place the bottom layer on your cake plate and spread frosting evenly on the top of the layer. Add a layer of cake, then frosting until you get to the top of the cake. Pile a generous amount on the top and begin to smooth over the edges and sides.",
      "Do a crumb coating and place in the fridge for about 15 minutes to allow it to set. Do the final coat and decorate as you wish. I am really an amateur, but you can smooth the sides with your cake spatula and add some kind of decorative border if you like."

      "Note: The sweet dough must be allowed to rise, and then chill overnight in the refrigerator; therefore dough should be made a day in advance of the cinnamon rolls.",
      "For the dough:",
      "1. Before applying heat-pour the milk, half-and-half, canola oil, and sugar into a Dutch oven, whisking to combine.",
      "2. Slice a vanilla bean open lengthwise. Scrape the interior \"caviar\" from the vanilla bean and place it in an airtight container for later use in the icing. Take the now empty vanilla bean hull and float it in the milk mixture.",
      "3. Heat the milk mixture over medium heat until it begins to simmer and bubble around the edges, whisking occasionally. (Do not allow the mixture to come to a rapid boil.)",
      "4. Turn off the heat, remove the vanilla bean hull, and allow to cool to lukewarm (warm, but not hot to the touch).",
      "5. Once mixture has cooled to lukewarm, sift the flour, salt, baking powder, and baking soda over top. Sprinkle the yeast over everything and stir with a wooden spoon until blended. Dough will be very sticky.",
      "6. Cover the Dutch oven with a clean towel and allow mixture to rise until it doubles in bulk, about 2 hours. After the initial rise, place a lid on the pot, and refrigerate overnight. The dough is quite sticky, and will be easier to work with after being refrigerated. Refrigeration also slows the yeast, still allowing the dough to rise. At this point, I usually take the butter for the filling, and the cream cheese for the icing out of the 'fridge and set it on the counter so that it is ready to use in the morning. (You do what makes you comfortable.)",
      "7. The next morning, take the dough out of the refrigerator, and allow it to stand at room temperature while you prepare the filling and icing.",
      "For the filling:",
      "8. In a small bowl, combine the softened butter, ground cinnamon, packed brown sugar, and salt with an electric mixer until thoroughly blended; set aside.",
      "For the Icing:",
      "9. In a medium bowl, combine the powdered sugar, softened cream cheese, half-and-half, melted butter, and brewed coffee until combined. Add the reserved caviar from the vanilla bean, and continue mixing until the bean flecks are distributed throughout. At this point, the icing is soft, gooey, and pourable-perfect!",
      "10. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and set it aside.",
      "To assemble the cinnamon rolls:",
      "11. Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F.",
      "12. Generously grease four 9-inch (glass or aluminum) pie plates with butter; set aside. (I normally use about a tablespoon of cold butter to grease all of the pie plates. I, however, do not recommend using dark and/or nonstick pans as they cook the outside of the rolls too quickly, darkening/crisping the outsides before the centers are done.)",
      "13. Turn the dough out onto a clean, well floured work surface. Have a bench scraper handy.",
      "14. Lightly flour the top of the dough, and roll it evenly into a 24\" x 8\" rectangle. Dough will be about 1/4 inch thick. If at any time the dough sticks to the rolling pin, sprinkle the dough with a little more flour.",
      "15. Use an offset spatula to spread the filling over the dough to within 1/2 inch of the edges.",
      "16. Beginning with the long side farthest from you, tightly roll the dough over the filling towards yourself. Take your time to roll it tight-we don't want any loosey-goosey cinnamon rolls! If at any point the dough is sticking to the work surface, gently run a thin bench scraper under it to loosen without tearing the dough.",
      "17. Once the dough has been rolled, pinch the edges and seams together to seal the buttery goodness of the filling inside.",
      "18. Use a sharp knife to cut the roll into 1-inch pieces. Place the pieces (cut side up) into the prepared pie plates, about an inch or so apart. I usually place 6 rolls in each pie plate-1 in the middle, and 5 around the perimeter.",
      "19. Once all the rolls are cut and nestled in their pie plates, allow them to rest for about 10 minutes. Now is an excellent time to preheat the oven, if you haven't already.",
      "20. Bake the cinnamon rolls for 16-18 minutes, or until they are lightly golden brown around the edges, and the centers are set, but not browned.",
      "21. Remove cinnamon rolls from the oven to cool on a wire rack for 10 minutes.",
      "22. After 10 minutes, pour the icing over the cinnamon rolls-you will have more than enough icing to cover 24 rolls. Pouring the icing while the rolls are still warm will allow it to seep into the creases of the rolls. This is a very good thing. Use an offset spatula to ensure that the icing is covering every exposed inch of the cinnamon rolls.",
      "23. Allow rolls to cool for another 10 minutes, if you desire to serve them warm; or, you can allow rolls to cool completely before eating, depending on your preference.",
      "24.\tStore leftover cinnamon rolls tightly wrapped at room temperature for up to 2 days.",
      "Also worth noting: Once baked, iced, and cooled, these cinnamon rolls freeze beautifully! Just tightly double-wrap the pie plates with plastic wrap, and then wrap them again with aluminum foil. Freeze for up to 2 months. To serve, allow rolls to thaw on the counter overnight, remove the plastic wrap from the pie plate, replace the foil, and reheat at 325\u00b0F for about 10 minutes to warm."

Use a hand mixer to beat it all together thoroughly. If it is too thick and stiff, loosen it just a bit with a little hot water and mix it a little more. Liberally grease a bundt pan with oil or cooking spray and spread the batter evenly in it. Bake the cake for 30-35 minutes, until it starts to become golden and pull away from the sides of the pan.",
      "While the cake bakes, make the syrup. Combine the lemon juice and sugar in a medium sauce pan and heat it up over medium high heat. Let it come to a gentle boil while you stir it occasionally until it is has thickened and become like a syrup. Set it aside to let it stop boiling, then put the lemon slices in it. Put it back on the heat to cook the lemon slices just until they soften for a minute or two. Get out a sheet tray lined with a silicone mat and use tongs to remove the lemon slices to the tray. Reserve the syrup and set it aside.",
      "When the cake is done, let it cool for 5-10 minutes. In the meantime, reduce oven heat to 200\u00b0F. Take the lemon slices and make a cut in each of them from the center to the outside. Twist the cut ends to make them all look like little bows. Sprinkle them all with a little sugar, then put them into the oven to dry out completely for an hour. They'll become chewy and candied.",
      "While the cake is still in the pan, poke lots of little holes in the bottom with a tooth pick. Brush about a third of the syrup onto it and let it seep right into the cake. Turn it out onto a wire rack to finish cooling and repeat the same process on the top with the remaining syrup. Let the cake cool completely, then make the icing. Just combine the lemon juice and powdered sugar in a bowl and stir it together well until you have a thick, white icing. Set it aside.",
      "Now it's time to assemble the cake! When the lemons are done drying out, take them out and set them aside. Transfer the cake to a cake plate and spoon the icing all over it, letting it drizzle down the sides. Sprinkle the toasted almonds and a generous dusting of poppy seeds on top of the icing. Then place the pretty bows on the very top. Serve the cake immediately and enjoy!"

      "In a medium to large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Add the buttermilk, shortening, and vanilla. Beat with an electric mixer on low speed for 30 seconds. Then turn mixer up to medium-high speed and beat for 2 minutes longer, scraping bowl occasionally. Add egg whites and beat for 2 more minutes, scraping bowl occasionally. Pour into cupcake liners and bake for about 22 minutes, or until toothpick comes out clean. These cupcakes should be very moist; if they aren't, try baking them for less minutes the next time. Let cupcakes rest in pan for 5 minutes before removing them to a cooling rack to cool completely.",
      "For the lemon curd:",
      "In a medium stainless steel bowl placed over a saucepan of simmering water (do not allow bowl to touch the water), whisk together the eggs, sugar, and lemon juice until blended. Cook, stirring constantly, to prevent it from curdling. When the mixture becomes thickened (like sour cream), or reaches 165\u00b0F, remove it from the heat. This should take about 10 minutes. Cut the butter into small pieces and whisk into the mixture until the butter has melted. Add the lemon zest and let cool. The lemon curd will continue to thicken as it cools. Cover immediately, so a skin doesn't form, and refrigerate for up to 1 week. (Be sure to reserve 3/4 cup of the lemon curd for the buttercream!)",
      "For the lemon Swiss meringue buttercream:",
      "In the heatproof bowl of a stand mixer set over a pan of simmering water (do not allow bowl to touch water), combine the egg whites and sugar, whisking constantly until the mixture is warm to the touch (about 130\u00b0F).",
      "Place the bowl on the stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. Beat the egg white mixture on high speed until stiff peaks form. Continue beating until mixture is fluffy and glossy and completely cool, about 6 minutes.",
      "Switch to the paddle attachment. With the mixture on medium-low speed, add the butter, a few tablespoons at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat on lowest speed to eliminate any air bubbles, about 2 minutes. Gently fold in lemon curd with a rubber spatula.",
      "To assemble the cupcakes:",
      "With a paring knife, cut a small cone shape of cake out of the middle of each cupcake. Be careful to not cut to the bottom of the cupcake. Fill each cupcake with lemon curd, level with the top of the cupcakes. Then prepare a pastry bag with a plain round tip, filling it with the buttercream. Starting at the outer edge of a cupcake top, swirl the buttercream around the cupcake, up to the center.",
      "Source: Cupcakes recipe comes from my sister's recipe box, originally from a friend of hers. I just barely adapted it. The lemon curd recipe is the one my mom has been using for years, originally from Joy of Baking.com. I doubled the lemon zest of the original recipe. The lemon Swiss meringue buttercream is slightly adapted from Martha Stewart's Baking Handbook."

Once the cakes have cooled down enough, remove them from the pans, place them on a wire rack, and place them in the refrigerator for about an hour. This will allow frosting the cake much easier.",

Now, add the milk, food coloring, and vanilla extract. The frosting should become creamy. If it is still a little thick add a teaspoon of milk at a time. A little milk goes a long way so don't \"eye-ball\" it and just pour the milk in. It is important to measure the milk. When the frosting is to the consistency of your liking, you are ready to ice the cake.",
      "2. Remove the cakes from the refrigerator. With a bread knife make the cakes as even as possible by slicing off the rounded top of the cakes so that they are even. Set one cake on a serving platter. Begin to frost the bottom part of the cake with about a 3rd of the icing. Place the other cake on the top with the flat bottom facing up. This will give the top of the cake a smooth look and will eliminate it from looking crumbly while you ice the cake. Use about a 3rd of the frosting to frost the other part of the cake. Use the rest of the frosting to complete the sides and more at the top. Use all of the icing so none of the cake will show. Sprinkle the top with the sprinkles if you would like."

Sift the flour/sugar mixture over the egg whites in 6-8 additions (depending on your proficiency with folding flour into egg whites) and gently fold it in after each addition. It is better to take your time and do it gently than to rush and deflate the egg whites. Spoon batter into two 8 inch round cake pans with parchment paper on the bottoms (or a 9 inch bundt pan if you choose to do this not as a cake). Smooth the top with a spatula and tap the pan on the counter once or twice to ensure that there are no large bubbles lurking beneath the surface.",

(If your tube pan has a hole in the tube, seal it with plastic wrap for this step, and then remove the plastic wrap after pouring.)",

      "Before serving, use a long, thin, sharp knife to work the edges of the pan, both on the sides and around the tube. Carefully keep to the edge of the pan. The custard is very soft and will be easy to cut into, which may make it break when flipping.",

      "2. Assembled cake can be refrigerated for up to 1 day. Bring to room temperature before serving.",
      "3. The frosting might seem a little loose at first. I put the frosted cake in the fridge to firm up before serving and it was perfect. Just make sure you don't have a lot of juice left in the berries. If it's very loose just add more powdered sugar, a little at a time, until you get the consistency you like."

Turn the heat back on to medium-low and cook while stirring constantly until the mixture starts to bubble. Turn off the heat, stir in the toasted coconut (reserve a few pinches for garnish, if desired), almond extract and the remaining tablespoon of butter. Stir until combined. Pour the coconut pudding into a bowl, cover with plastic wrap and chill at least 2 hours.",
      "5. When ready to serve, spoon the coconut pudding into the 4 pie crusts. Beat the remaining 6 tablespoons of heavy cream until soft peaks form. Add the powdered sugar and beat until slightly firmer peaks form. Dollop each pie with the whipped cream and serve chilled.",
