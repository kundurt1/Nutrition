Before unmolding the cake from the springform pan, run a knife around the edge of the cheesecake.",
      "It works best to pop the cheesecake into the freezer for 30 minutes before slicing. Then dip your knife blade into a tall glass of very hot water before cutting each slice. Serve with a dollop of freshly whipped cream and a sprinkling of additional toffee bits, if desired.",
      "Source: Inspired by a great piece of cheesecake called \"Chips & Chunks\" that I shared with my husband at Cafe Latte in St. Paul, MN. I incorporated the chocolate polka dots after running across an irresistibly cute cheesecake at The Baker's Daughter."

      "6. Turn the dough out onto a large sheet of waxed paper. Roll the dough into a large log, about 4-5 inches in diameter, and about 10 inches long.",
      "7. Divide the log in half widthwise. Roll each half into a 10-inch log, and flatten to 1 inch thickness. You will have a 10-inch x 3-inch x 1-inch oblong of dough. Repeat with the other half of the dough, and wrap each individually in waxed paper. Chill the wrapped dough in the refrigerator for 1 hour.",
      "To assemble the pies:",
      "8. Preheat the oven to 350 F. Line two half-sheet pans with parchment paper; set aside.",
      "9. Whip one egg white with the water until frothy. (This will be the glue to hold the pastry together.) Set aside.",
      "10. After the dough has chilled, unwrap one oblong and place it on a clean, floured surface. (I like a pastry mat for this application.)",
      "11. Roll the oblong into roughly a 12-inch by 16-inch rectangle. If the dough frequently cracks, allow it to rest at room temperature for 15 minutes and try again. Small cracks can be pinched back together without issue.",
      "12. Cut the dough in half lengthwise, and then cut each in fourths widthwise so that you have eight 6\"x4\" rectangles. I use a ruler to guide a pizza cutter when cutting the dough. Each pie will need two rectangles: one for the bottom and one for the top. In a perfect kitchen, the rectangles would all be exactly the same size. My kitchen is far from perfect, so I match the rectangles in the best pairs possible.",
      "13. Use a thin spatula to transfer 4 of the rectangles to one of the prepared baking sheets, placing them 2 inches apart.",
      "14. Thinly spread 1 tablespoon of the jam on each of the four rectangles, leaving a 1/4-inch clean margin around the edges.",
      "15. Brush the egg wash around the margins of the dough, and place another rectangle of dough on top, pressing the edges together to seal. Crimp around the edges of the dough with a fork to ensure the seal.",
      "16. Gently \"dock\" the top of the pastry with a fork so that steam can escape while the pie is baking. (Poke a fork several times through only the first layer of dough for each of the complete pies.)",
      "17. Brush the tops of the pies with milk.",
      "18. Repeat the entire process with the remaining half of dough.",
      "19. Bake pies at 350 F for about 25 minutes, or until the edges are just beginning to brown.",

      "22. Stir together sifted powdered sugar, milk and vanilla extract with a fork until smooth.",
      "23. If desired, stir in a drop or two of liquid food coloring to tint the icing.",

      "25. Immediately shake a few colored sprinkles over the icing, and gently press with your fingers to \"set\" them in the icing (if desired.) Allow icing to dry.",
      "26. Enjoy the iced pies at room temperature, or re-warm for a minute or two in the toaster.",
      "27. Leftover toaster pies can be stored in a zippered bag on the counter for 2 to 3 days.",
      "NOTES: Pies can be made smaller by cutting the rectangles in half, which would yield 16 smaller pies. Pies can also be frozen for a month or so if individually wrapped in waxed paper, and then placed in a zippered freezer bag."

      "Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F. Begin by caramelizing the apples: melt 1 tablespoon butter in a small saute pan over medium heat. Add chopped apples, and cook over medium heat until they start to caramelize and become tender, 2-3 minutes (you can cover the saute pan with a lid with 60 seconds to trap in the steam to tenderize the apples more quickly).",
      "Mix in 1 tablespoon of brown sugar, 1 tablespoon water, and 1/8 teaspoon of ground cinnamon. Cook apples until brown sugar melts, about 60 seconds. Take apples off the heat and let cool for at least 10 minutes before mixing into the cake batter.",
      "To make the cake batter, in a large bowl, mix together 4 tablespoons of butter and 3/4 cup brown sugar until well-combined and no streaks of butter remain. Add egg and whisk until light and creamy, about 45 seconds. Add vanilla extract and mix.",
      "In another bowl, whisk together 1 cup flour, 3/4 teaspoon cinnamon, baking soda, and salt. Add to the wet ingredients in 3 batches, alternating with the sour cream. Fold in the caramelized apples. Pour batter into a 9-inch cake pan greased with cooking spray, oil, or butter.",
      "To make the crumble, place remaining 1/4 cup flour, 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon, and 2 tablespoons unsalted butter into a small bowl. Mix everything together thoroughly until crumble looks like wet sand.",
      "Sprinkle the crumble evenly over the top. Bake the coffee cake until golden brown and set, 35-40 minutes. Let cool before topping with powdered sugar glaze.",
      "To make the glaze, whisk together powdered sugar and heavy cream until a thick glossy glaze forms. Add more heavy cream or more powdered sugar depending on how you like the consistency.",
      "Drizzle the glaze over the cooled cake. Let the cake sit overnight if you want the glaze to harden, or serve immediately.",
      "Enjoy! See the related blog post for a link to the step-by-step video."

You will need to repeat this 10-15 times (or more, depending on your arm strength and the beginning texture of your batter) until the batter slowly and continuously drips back into the bowl when you scoop it up with the spatula. Think of the consistency of molten lava.

Be sure not to over-mix as you may split the mascarpone. Add the liqueur(s) and mix until just combined. (You may adjust the quantity of liqueur according to personal taste.) Set this aside and make the Italian meringue.",
      "For the Italian Meringue:",
      "3. Add the water to a clean, grease-free saucepan, then slowly add the sugar, making sure that all the grains get wet. Place over a medium heat and bring to soft ball stage. This is about 112 to 114 C. You can use a candy thermometer for this. But the best way I've found to test this is drop a bit of the sugar syrup into cold water. If it's ready it will form a soft, flexible ball. If it's not hot enough, it will form a thread, too far and the ball won't flatten when you squeeze it. Be sure to swirl the pan (not stir with spoon) to avoid crystallising the sugar.",
      "4. Making sure that your mixing bowl is completely grease-free, add in your egg whites and whisk on high speed until white and fluffy. As your egg whites reach medium peak, start to slowly add your hot sugar syrup in a slow and steady stream. Make sure to mix constantly. Once all the sugar has been added, continue to whisk until the Italian meringue has completely cooled.",
      "5. Take your cooled Italian meringue, and carefully fold it into the mascarpone mix. Taste and adjust the amount of liqueur if necessary.",
      "6. Take your sponge finger biscuits, and soak them in the coffee, a couple at a time. Give the biscuits a light squeeze to remove any excess coffee. Try not to soak your biscuits all the way through. There should still be a little portion in the middle that has not been soaked in the coffee.",
      "7. Line your tin/bowl with the biscuits. Once the bowl has been completely covered with the biscuits, sprinkle with a some cocoa powder to lightly coat.",
      "8. Add a little of the mascarpone mix, to cover the biscuit and form a layer above the biscuits. Cover with more coffee-soaked sponge finger biscuits, and sprinkle again with the cocoa. Place some more of the mascarpone mix on top of the sponge finger biscuit, coming up about another one-third of the way up the bowl. Repeat this process once more, levelling out the mix with the top edge of the bowl.",
      "9. Place in the fridge, and allow the tiramisu to become firm enough to cut, minimum 2 hours.",

      "3. In a bowl, mix the yolks with the sugar, whipping until it's very creamy.",
      "4. Add the mascarpone. Mix.",
      "5. Whip the whites with a pinch of salt until they're firm.",
      "6. Add the whites to the yolk mixture and gently fold in order to keep the whites airy and fluffy. Cream done!",
      "7. Put some of the cooled coffee in a dish, grab the Savoiardi biscuits, and roll them in it.",
      "Note: this is a crucial step because the biscuit has to be wet in the right measure. They shouldn't be too wet that they break easily, or else the tiramisu will become a mushy thing. But they shouldn't be too dry either. So, I usually roll them in the coffee until the outer part is soft and the core is still heavy.",
      "8. Roll the biscuits one at a time in the coffee, putting them in a serving dish in a single layer. (I usually use a glass one that's made for the oven, about 33x18 cm and 5 or 6 cm deep. It's perfect for a 2-layered tiramisu with these quantities.) When the plate is covered with a layer of wet Savoiardi, smear half the cream on it. You can use less, depending on the size of the plate and the number of layers you want.",
      "9. Sprinkle the cocoa on the cream, covering everything and forming a solid layer. There shouldn't be any white spots anywhere!",
      "10. Continue rolling the remaining Savioardi in coffee, making another layer.",
      "11. Smear the rest of the cream, filling in all the spaces and levelling the top.",
      "12. Sprinkle again a generous amount of cocoa powder. Again, make sure you cover everything and there are no visible white areas.",
      "13. Done! Now put it in the fridge and consume the delight after a few hours, or even better, the day after. I know it's hard, but it's worth the wait!"

(I rolled out my dough directly on parchment paper to make transferring it to the baking sheet easier. You can anchor it with a can if it begins to slide around while you roll.) Place a piece of plastic wrap or parchment paper over the dough and roll out, working from the center, until it's about 1/4-1/8 inch thickness and a 9-inch diameter. If the dough feels crumbly, let it warm up slightly, then continue working. Repeat with the second ball.",
      "Divide the berries between the galettes, leaving a 1 to 2 inch lip on the sides. Carefully fold the flaps of dough onto itself in large creases. If it breaks, don't stress: you can patch it up, or use your hands to gently press the outside back together. I found it helpful to use my knife to loosen the dough flaps and help me fold.",
      "Transfer the gluten-free berry galettes to a baking sheet (lined with parchment, if not already using some). Brush the sides of the crust with the egg wash and sprinkle with additional sugar. Bake in the oven for 35-40 minutes, until the filling bubbles and the crust is golden brown.",
      "Allow the galette to cool slightly on the pan (don't worry if the juices leak). Then cut into slices or serve on a platter with scoops of vanilla ice cream (red, white and blue baby!)."

With a spoon, create a gentle whirlpool in the water. This will help the egg white wrap around the yolk. Slowly tip the egg into the whirlpool, white first. Let to cook for 3 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon, cutting off any wispy edges using the edge of the spoon. Set the egg onto a paper towel and gently pat dry. Transfer to your dish."

      "7. Once the muslin bag is cool enough to handle, bring the marmalade mixture back to a low simmer, then pour in the sugar, stirring until completely dissolved. Squeeze the muslin bag over the pot, as hard as you can. Lots of gloopy juice should come out. This contains the pectin, which helps set the marmalade, so squeeze as much from the muslin as you can. Stir this in, then increase the heat to high and put a few plates in the freezer. You might want to preheat your oven to 150\u00b0 C at this point too.",
      "8. Bring the marmalade to a rolling boil and. After five minutes, start testing whether the marmalade has reached its setting point, which is about 105\u00b0 C. A sugar thermometer is a big help here. To check whether the marmalade has set, place a scant teaspoon onto a cold plate, and then return to the fridge to cool for a few minutes. If the skin of marmalade becomes crinkly when you push it with your finger, it is set. If not, continue cooking your marmalade, checking every five minutes or so until it does set. It took my marmalade about 25 minutes to set, although it can happen much quicker than this.",
      "9. Remove the marmalade from the heat, and allow it to settle for 15 minutes or so.",
      "10. While the marmalade is settling, you can sterilize your jars: Wash the jars in warm soapy water, then dry with a towel and place in the oven to finish drying completely. To sterilize the lids, place them in boiling water for a few minutes, then allow to dry completely.",
      "11. Remove any scum from the top of the marmalade with a spoon, then pour the marmalade into the jars and seal them while the jars are still hot.",
      "12. Label the jars and then store them in a dry, dark and cool place."

In 1912, absinthe was banned, so Peychaud substituted his special bitters in its place. In 1893 the Grunewald Hotel was built in the city, and at this time the hotel earned the rights to Ramos Gin Fizz and the Sazerac.",

      "First, make the cake layers. Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F and line two 9-inch round cake pans with parchment paper. Then spray the pans well with cooking spray.",
      "Combine flour, baking powder and salt in a bowl and whisk them together to aerate them. Combine the milk, eggs, egg yolk, lemon zest, coconut extract and distilled white vinegar in another bowl and whisk that all together until smooth.",
      "Set up a stand mixer and combine the sugar and butter in its bowl. Beat thoroughly until smooth and fluffy. Slowly add in 1/3 of the dry ingredients, followed by half of the wet ingredients. Let each of them get fully incorporated before adding the next 1/3 of the dry ingredients and remaining wet ingredients. Finish with the dry ingredients just until a lovely cake batter forms.",
      "Divide the batter evenly among the two prepared cake pans and bake the cake layers for about 30 minutes. The cakes will be slightly sticky when they come out but a toothpick should come out pretty cleanly when inserted in the center. Let the cakes cool for 30 minutes before turning them out onto large plates to finish cooling completely.",
      "While the cake layers bake and cool, make the Swiss meringue buttercream. You will need to wash out the stand mixer bowl and paddle attachment first. Then it's meringue time! Set a small pot filled halfway with water on the stove and bring it to a gentle simmer. Combine the egg whites, sugar and salt in a heat proof bowl and set the bowl over the simmering water. Whisk the mixture until the egg whites warm up and the sugar dissolves. It will be pale white, thick and smooth and should take just a minute or two. Transfer the mixture to the stand mixer bowl and use the whisk attachment to beat the egg whites until they are stiff and fluffy. Switch to the paddle attachment and beat in the softened butter 1/2 a stick at a time. It will become a luscious, thick buttercream. Finally, beat in the rum thoroughly. Set the frosting aside until you are ready to assemble the cake.",
      "When the cake layers are completely cool, assemble the cake. Place the first layer on a pretty cake plate with the flat side down, then spread the lemon curd in a thick layer on it. Place the second layer on top with the flat side up. Frost the cake on top and all around the sides with an offset spatula and smooth it out as best you can. There is plenty of buttercream to work with in case of any needed patch jobs. Sprinkle the shredded coconut, chopped hazelnuts and lemon zest on top to decorate it. Then set it in the refrigerator until you are ready to serve it! Enjoy!"

      "While there are a lot of steps to this tart, the results are certainly worth it. You probably could make this without a food processor, but I wouldn't want to try it! I used an 11 inch tart pan with a removable bottom, but you can also use a springform pan.",
      "MAKE CRUST:",
      "1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.",
      "2. Spread almonds and hazelnuts on a cookie sheet and toast in oven. It should take 6 to 8 minutes, and they should be lightly browned and fragrant.",
      "3. Cool the nuts to room temperature.",
      "4. In a food processor, pulse the nuts, sugar and salt until they are very finely ground and mixed.",
      "5. Add the lemon zest and pulse to combine.",
      "6. Add flour, cinnamon and allspice; pulse to combine.",
      "7. Scatter 12 tablespoons of butter over the dry ingredients in the food processor. Pulse to combine, stopping when the mixture looks like a coarse meal.",
      "8. Whisk together egg and vanilla extract.",
      "9. Turn food processor to \"on\" and slowly pour the egg mixture into the feeding tube. Let the machine run until a dough ball forms from all the ingredients.",
      "FORM THE CRUST:",
      "1. Take dough out of the food processor and pat until it's all cohesive. I usually have to dig little bits from the corners of the food processor and push them into the main ball.",
      "2. Divide dough into 2 pieces, one slightly larger than the other. (For those with a kitchen scale, 15 oz. and 13 oz.)",
      "3. Flatten each piece into a disk shape.",
      "(At this point, you can double wrap the disks in plastic wrap and refrigerate for about 2 days. If you do, let it warm up before you finally use it.)",
      "4. Cut a parchment round to fit the bottom of the tart pan. Spray the bottom and sides of your pan with cooking spray.",
      "5. Take the bottom out of pan and place parchment round on it. Spray parchment with cooking spray.",
      "6. Place smaller dough disk on the center of the parchment-lined tart pan bottom.",
      "7. Use an intermediary (parchment paper, plastic wrap) on top of dough and roll out until it is almost to the edges of the bottom of the pan.",
      "8. Drop the bottom into the fluted ring and remove the intermediary.",
      "9. Using your fingers, press the dough edges flush with the fluted ring.",
      "10. Poke holes in dough and place tart pan on a cookie sheet.",
      "11. Bake bottom crust for 15 minutes, or until edges just begin to brown.",
      "12. Let cool to room temperature again.",
      "13. While tart bottom is cooling, pinch off a golf-ball-sized piece of dough from the larger circle.",
      "14. Carefully roll this into a rope. It will probably not want to stick together as the dough is fragile. Do the best you can.",
      "15. When tart bottom is cool, place rope inside tart pan against the fluted sides. Repeat as necessary until the dough comes almost to the top of the tart pan. We are going to put a lattice crust on top, however, so eyeball it as best you can.",
      "16. Using your fingers (or a measuring cup), gently press the rope(s) together and up the sides.",
      "17. Put tart pan aside on its cookie sheet again.",
      "18. Roll out the remaining dough into a 12-inch circle (or however large you need). Use an intermediary (I use parchment paper) and you'll definitely need a \"bottom\" piece under the dough.",
      "19. Using a knife or pizza cuter, trim outside edges so that the circle is neat on the outside.",
      "20. Cut strips that are a half to three quarters of an inch. You'll need ten, but this dough is fragile so having more is helpful.",
      "21. Take bottom parchment paper and place on another cookie sheet. Put cookie sheet in the freezer for 15 to 20 minutes. We want the strips \"firm\" but not frozen.",
      "FOR FILLING:",
      "You can either make your own raspberry preserves or use a jarred version. I prefer to make my own from frozen raspberries. If you use a jarred version, use 1 1/4 cups of high quality raspberry preserves.",
      "1. Take 8 ounces (2 cups) of frozen raspberries and place in a pot on stove top.",
      "2. Pour in 1/4 cup of sugar.",
      "3. Sprinkle a few drops of lemon juice.",
      "4. Let the whole thing come to a boil, stirring occasionally. You want a fair amount of liquid to boil off, but you don't want anything to burn. It should take about 15 minutes.",
      "5. Let raspberries cool to room temperature.",
      "ASSEMBLING TART:",
      "1. Pour raspberry filling into prepared tart pan.",
      "2. Filling should be even, but not overflow the edges of the crust.",
      "3. Take hardened strips of dough from freezer and assemble in a lattice crust. If dough warms too much, put it back in the freezer to firm up again. The dough has a tendency to break on me, and I usually just work through it. Please note that you will find it hard to move strips after you've laid them down. The raspberry preserves are quite sticky.",
      "4. Brush lattice strips with cream. (You can skip this step. I often do.)",
      "Put cookie sheet with tart on it in the oven and bake until golden brown and filling is bubbly, about 50 minutes.",
      "Let cool to room temperature to serve (usually 2 hours). Good eaten alone, or with whipped cream."

      "A note about timing: Calas are made with cooked rice that is mixed with yeast and water to make a sponge which sits overnight either in the refrigerator or at room temperature. Leaving the sponge at room temperature will give the Calas a slightly fermented taste, something like sourdough.",
      "A note about Calas batter: As you make Calas, the batter will thin. Occasionally add a little more rice flour to keep the batter cohesive and at the consistency described in the recipe below.",
      "You will also need:",
      "1. A small bowl in which to make the sponge and a large bowl to mix the batter.",
      "2. A heavy pot that holds heat well to deep-fry the Calas.",
      "3. A deep-fry or candy thermometer is useful for judging the oil's temperature.",
      "4. A small ladle, one used for serving sauces or gravy is a good size; or use a a soup spoon.",
      "5. Two forks for turning the frying fritters.",
      "6. A cooling rack placed over a rimmed baking sheet.",
      "7. A strainer to sprinkle the powdered sugar over the hot Calas before serving.",
      "For the sponge:",
      "1. Place the yeast and 1/8 teaspoon of sugar in a small bowl, add the warm water and stir to dissolve the yeast and proof it (i.e. make sure that the yeast becomes active. Tiny bubbles will begin to rise to the surface, indicating that the yeast isn't dead.)",
      "2. Add the rice and mix it well with the yeast and water. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and put it in the refrigerator overnight. Or you can leave it at room temperature to give the batter a slightly sourish, fermented taste.",
      "For the Calas:",
      "1. The next day, pour the sponge into a larger bowl. Add 2 tablespoons of sugar, the beaten eggs, 1 cup of rice flour, and the salt.",
      "2. Check the consistency of the batter. A good batter will jiggle in the bowl, and, at the same time, hold together. A ladle full of it also will hold together and will continue to hold its shape as it pours from the ladle. In other words, the batter releases in a single round-ish form from the ladle. (Photos illustrating this are on the related link.)",
      "3. Add oil to a depth of at least 2-inches into the pot used for deep-frying the Calas. Heat the oil over medium heat until it reaches a temperature of about 350 F.",
      "4. Before beginning to fry the Calas, test the consistency of the batter again by pouring a small spoonful into the hot oil. If the batter is too thin, it will scatter into small bits as it falls into the oil. (See the related link for a photo illustration.) Thicken a thin batter by adding a little more rice flour.",
      "5. Spoon a rounded mound of batter into the ladle and, with one finger, quickly push it out of the ladle and into the hot oil. Make a small number of Calas at one time (3 or 4, depending on the size of the pot). The temperature of the oil is difficult to maintain at around 350 F if too many fritters are made at once.",
      "6. Fry on one side until you begin to see a golden color rising up the edges of the fritter. This occurs in about 2 minutes.",
      "7. Turn the fritter with two forks. Continue frying until the second side turns a light shade of gold, in about another 2 minutes.",
      "8. As you continue to make fritters, the batter will thin. Occasionally add a little more rice flour to keep the remaining batter cohesive and 'jiggly-in-the-bowl'. Try to keep the oil hovering at a temperature of around 350 F.",
      "9. Transfer the Calas as they are done to a cooling rack placed over a rimmed baking sheet.",
      "10. When all the batter is used up and all the fritters made, sift powdered sugar over the rack of Calas and serve them hot.",
      "An acknowledgement: This version of Calas is based on one in Miss Celestine Eustis's cookbook \"Cooking In Old Creole Days\" (1911). The full text of Miss Eustis's fine cookbook is available free online as part of \"Feeding America: The Historic American Cookbook Project\"."

I will usually tie all the knots and put them onto the pan and give them a little more time to rise while I melt the butter. Brush them with butter. Next, put the first cookie sheet in the oven with the second one following a few minutes later.",

      "- For individual pizza rolls, I take a larger ball of dough and roll it out into a square with a rolling pin. Along one edge, sprinkle grated pizza cheese or tasty cheese and sliced pepperoni, sprinkle with Italian seasoning, then roll up the square and seal the edges of the dough so the insides don't leak out. Brush with butter, bake, then serve with ranch dressing and pizza sauce for dipping.",
      "-For cinnamon rolls, roll out all the dough into a large square, brush with melted butter, then thoroughly sprinkle on a mixture of cinnamon and sugar. Roll up into a roll and cut the roll into slices that are about 3/4 to one inch thick. Place the rolls on a pizza pan or cookie sheet, just 1/2 an inch apart. Let rise then bake.",
      "- For monkey bread or cinnamon pull-apart bread, butter or spray a bundt pan then pinch off small balls of dough the size of a large marble or ping pong ball, roll them in melted butter then a cinnamon sugar mixture and place in the Bundt pan. Cook for 20 minutes, then check for doneness. If it is cooked, let it cool for a few minutes then turn it out on a plate. I once made this in a heat proof bowl for Halloween and it looked like a brain, I won the prize for most creative dessert!",
      "-For chicken and mushroom pockets, take cooked chicken cut into small chunks and mix with some sauteed mushrooms and 1/2 a block of cream cheese. Take a larger ball of dough and roll it out into a square with a rolling pin. Place a dollop of the mixture on one half of the square and fold dough over and seal edges. Brush with butter (and roll in seasoned bread crumbs if desired) and cook for about 20 minutes. Serve with cream of mushroom soup as a sauce and with long grain wild rice and a vegetable on the side."

While the yeast foams up, set up a stand mixer and combine the soft butter and cup of sugar in its bowl. Beat them together thoroughly until fluffy and smooth. Add the cinnamon and salt next, followed by each egg one at a time. Push down the sides to make sure it is all combined. Then pour in the yeast mixture and the extra cup of warm water. Turn the speed to low and gradually add in the flour until it is just mixed into a soft dough. Bring the dough together with your clean hands in the bowl and give it 2-3 turns of kneading to just make sure it is uniform. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and set it sit in a warm, dry area to rise for 2 1/2 to 3 hours.",
      "While the dough rises, prepare the glaze. Stir the butter, brown sugar, honey, corn syrup, water and lavender together in a bowl. The butter will separate and that is ok. It will bake to perfection. Grease 2 deep 9 1/2 inch pie pans with soft butter or shortening, then evenly distribute the glaze in the bottoms of both pans. Sprinkle 1/2 a cup of the chopped pistachios in an even layer on top of the glaze in each pan. Set the pans aside. Stir the cinnamon, sugar and ground lavender together in another bowl for the filling and set that aside too.",
      "When the dough is done rising, lightly punch it down and turn it out onto a well floured and clean surface. Cut it in half. Take the first half and roll it into a rectangle that is about 10 inches long. Brush it with half of the melted butter and spread 1/2 of the cinnamon, sugar and lavender filling evenly all over it. Roll the long side up tightly to have a long log. Cut the log into 12 equal pieces. Place the 12 pieces into one of the prepared pie dishes and lightly press them into the glaze. Repeat the process with the other half of dough to fill the other pan. Set the pans aside to rise again for an hour.",
      "When the hour is almost up, preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F. Bake the rolls for 30-35 minutes, until they are puffy and golden. Let them cool for about 10 minutes. Then invert a flat, large platter on each pan and turn them both out to have them ready to serve immediately! They can be pulled apart almost like monkey bread to enjoy warm and fresh. Any leftovers can be kept for a day in a sealed container!"

      "Add flour, baking powder, baking soda, and kosher salt. Gently fold with spatula or large spoon until combined; be careful not to over-mix.",

Bake for about 50-60 minutes (I baked mine for 47 minutes, to be exact) or until top is golden and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean (or with a few moist crumbs). Baking times will differ based on the moisture content of the fruit, humidity in kitchen, and the oven.",
      "Let the bread cool in the pan for about 15 minutes before turning it out onto a wire rack to cool completely. Once the bread has cooled completely, drizzle with your preferred amount of glaze and slice.",

      "2. The bread batter should be thick. If you find it to be on the runny side, add up to 1/4 cup of additional flour. Please note that fruits vary in their moisture content, and as a result, the consistency of batters will vary. Strawberries release water into the batter during the baking process, so it's better to have a thicker batter going into the oven. Use your best judgement.",
      "3. Within the last 10 minutes of baking, loosely drape a piece of tin foil over the loaf to prevent the top and sides from becoming overly browned."

      "For the crepes:",
      "In a large blender, blend all ingredients for the crepes until smooth and well combined. Place in the refrigerator for 30 minutes, to let the coconut flour begin absorbing some of the liquid.",
      "Preheat a very nonstick (see note) 10 1/4 inch pan on medium-low heat. A light rub of coconut oil is a good idea if your worried about the non-stickiness of your pan.",
      "Pour a scant 1/4 cup (just under 1/4 cup, or 3 1/2 tablespoons) batter into the preheated pan and swirl around until pan is evenly coated. Cook until outsides of the crepe darken and the inside feels just set, about 4-6 minutes depending on your pan. Mine were perfect about 4 1/2 minutes.",
      "Very gently pick up the crepe and gently flip over. Cook until the other side is just set, only another 20-40 seconds; you don't want to dry them out! Repeat until all the batter is used, storing the crepes in the fridge on a plate as you cook them. You want them nice and cold when you put the cream on! You should end up with 17 crepes.",
      "For the cream:",
      "Place coconut cream, honey, lemon zest, lemon juice and vanilla extract into a large bowl. Using an electric hand mixer, beat until smooth and well combined, scraping the sides down as necessary. Set aside 1/4 cup of the cream for later use.",
      "To assemble:",
      "Place one cool crepe down on a plate, or cake stand, and top with 1 heaping tablespoon coconut cream. Using an offset spatula (this will make your life so much easier!) spread it thinly over the entire surface of the crepe. It won't totally cover the crepe, and it does not need to look pretty! You won't see the layers.",
      "Lay 2 tablespoons thinly sliced strawberries flat on top of the crepe, spreading them out evenly. Repeat the same process until all the crepes are used.",
      "On the last layer, you should have some strawberries left over, as well as the reserved 1/4 cup of coconut cream. Carefully spread the remaining cream evenly over the center of the top crepe, spreading almost to the edges. Assemble all the remaining strawberries in a pile in the center of the cake.",
      "Refrigerate for at least 1 hour to set the coconut cream. Slice and devour!",
      "Notes:",
      "1. I use the Thai Kitchen pre-canned coconut cream. Each can has about 1 cup of coconut cream in it,after draining the liquid out, so you'll need two cans, and use the remaining on something delicious! You can also buy two cans of full fat coconut milk and leave them in the refrigerator overnight. The next morning, flip them upside down, open them and drain out the liquid. You'll be left with coconut cream!",
      "2. They should actually be called \"large lemons.\" Don't try the buy the normal-sized lemons that just look the largest, or your cake won't have a nice lemon flavor!",
      "3. These crepes can be sticky, so make sure you use a really good quality nonstick pan. I originally made this recipe with a really old pan that has all its nonstick goodness scraped off, and it did not work. I used it an excuse to get new pans and, voila! Perfect crepes!",
      "4. It really helps to preheat your pan for a good 5 minutes before starting to make the crepes, since the temperature is so low."

Serve about 5 oz. of mix with 1.5 oz. of vodka in a glass over ice. Garnish with cucumber and celery. Or however you like."

      "4. Shape the dough and let it rise: Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface, and roll it around a little to lightly flour all surfaces of the dough. Roll the dough between your hands and the counter into an 18\" long rope, dusting with flour as necessary. Shape the rope into a ring, overlapping the ends by 2\" and pinching the seams together. Transfer the ring to a baking sheet that you've lined with parchment paper. The ring should be about 7\" in diameter. Oil a piece of plastic wrap and cover the dough with it, oiled side touching the dough. Let rise at room temperature for an hour, until doubled in bulk (the ring will be about 9\" in diameter).",
      "5. Once the loaf is shaped, set a rack in the lowest position in the oven and place a baking stone on it. Set a baking sheet on the floor of the oven under the stone. I use an old broiler pan for this-it's to hold the ice cubes. Turn the oven to 450 F and let it preheat for about an hour.",
      "6. When the loaf is doubled in size, brush it with half the melted butter and slide it, parchment paper included, onto the hot baking stone. Toss the ice cubes in the baking sheet and immediately close the door (this produces steam and a great crust). Bake for 20 minutes. Turn the oven down to 400 F, slide the bread from the parchment directly onto the stone, rotating it a little as you do so. Continue baking for another 10 to 15 minutes, until the bread is deep golden brown (an instant-read thermometer inserted into the bread should read about 211 F). When it's done, turn off the oven, open the oven door slightly, and leave the bread in the oven for 5 minutes.",
      "7. Remove the bread and transfer it to a wire rack. Glaze with the remaining melted butter and cool completely.",
      "Based on \"Prosciutto Ring\" in The Bread Bible by Rose Levy Beranbaum. As Rose instructs, you should tear this bread rather than cut it. The texture is eternally satisfying."

      "8. Whenever you are ready to make the frosting (and your custard is definitely not warm anymore - you can use it room temperature or cold for the frosting recipe), use your handy-dandy stand mixer with the paddle attachment and cream your butter with the powdered sugar. (You really want a stand mixer...there is going to be a lot of beating to come). The amount of sugar is really to taste, and don't worry, you can add more later if you want. I usually start with 1/3 cup at this stage.",
      "9. Once the butter is creamed and light and fluffy, add in the magic ingredient...3/4 cup of the custard.",
      "10. Then, once the custard is fully incorporated, add in the Starbucks Via instant coffee (I use the medium roast). I really think these work the best, but I suppose any instant coffee would work. I usually put in nearly 2 packets of the coffee.",
      "11. Continue to beat on medium until all the granules of instant coffee are gone (usually takes several minutes, but I have never had this frosting \"separate\" on me, so I walk away and come back to check).",
      "12. Stick your finger (or be clean and use a spoon) in and taste. Mmmmmm....tweak the flavors as needed. More coffee? More sugar? You can add more of either, but you can't take away, so start where you feel safe and then tweak at this stage as needed.",
      "This frosting holds its shape beautifully, and it actually tastes delicious cold, too. It's firm cold, but the flavor seems more like the ice cream. I use it on chocolate cupcakes, and it is literally a taste of delicious heaven. Remember, flavors will be stronger and more sweet the warmer the frosting is. You can taste the smoothness that the custard adds. It's worth the hassle of all this custard making... MAKE THIS FROSTING!!!",
      "*** About the \"servings\" listed above... I once made this frosting stretch to cover over 36 cupcakes, but that was giving just enough of a swirl of frosting to barely cover the tops of the cupcakes. So, depending on how thick you lay it on (and how much you eat before), it will cover between 24-36 cupcakes, I'd say."

      "1. To start, mix together the peanut butter and powdered sugar till it forms into little balls. (You can add more powdered sugar if needed.) Set aside. Now I just use a frozen store bought pie crust because I've actually never made a pie crust from scratch yet. (It's on my to-do list.) So you can just take a fork and poke holes on the bottom and sides of the crust before it bakes so it bakes evenly. Bake the defrosted crust at 400\u00b0F for 10-12 minutes. Let crust completely cool then sprinkle 1/3 of the peanut butter goodness on the bottom of the crust.",
      "2. Now take all the ingredients for the pudding (except for the butter and vanilla) and bring to a boil over medium heat. Boil for 2 minutes, stirring constantly. When done boiling, remove from heat and stir in the butter and vanilla. Pour into the pie crust about 3/4 of the way to the top. (You may have some pudding left over.) Now sprinkle another 1/3 of the peanut butter mixture on top of the pudding.",
      "3. For the meringue, in a chilled bowl, beat egg whites till fluffy. Mix in the cream of tartar and sugar and beat till stiff peaks form (about 5-7 minutes). Place meringue on top of the pudding and then sprinkle the remaining peanut butter mixture on top. Bake at 375\u00b0F till browned on top (about 8-10 minutes, watching closely).",
      "4. Let pie chill in the refrigerator for 3-4 hours.",
      "Enjoy!"

      "If your turkey is frozen, take it out of the freezer on the Monday of Thanksgiving week. It will need 3 days to defrost. The safest way to defrost a turkey is to put it in a large roasting pan and put it in the refrigerator.",
      "On Tuesday, make the brine. Combine all of the brine ingredients in a large stock pot and bring it to a low boil over medium high heat. Let it gently boil for 5 minutes, then take it off of the heat and let it cool to room temperature. Once it cools, store it in a sealed container in the refrigerator overnight.",
      "On Wednesday night, wash out your biggest cooler. Put the mostly thawed (unwrapped, with giblets removed) turkey into the cooler, then pour the brine all over it. Add a cup of water and about 4-5 cups of ice, then shut the cooler and store it overnight in a cool location like a basement or garage.",
      "On the morning of Thanksgiving, preheat the oven to 500 F. Remove the turkey from the brine and discard the brine. Thoroughly rinse the turkey with cold water inside and out, then pat it dry with a paper towel. Get the turkey onto a roasting pan fitted with a rack.",
      "Stuff the cavity of the turkey with the celery, onion, roasted garlic cloves, thyme, rosemary and sage. In a small bowl, mix together the Greek yogurt, herbs de provence, turmeric and coriander. Brush that mixture all over the turkey to coat it. Put the turkey into the oven for 30 minutes at the high temperature to really sear the skin.",
      "Once 30 minutes are up, turn down the oven heat to 350 F. Insert a meat thermometer into the thickest part of the turkey breast. Let the turkey continue to roast until the internal temperature reaches 161 F, which takes about 3 to 3 1/2 hours total (including the first 30 minutes on high) for a 16 pound bird. This time will vary if your bird is larger or smaller.",
      "Take the turkey out of the oven and let it rest for 15 to 20 minutes with a tent of foil over it, then carefully transfer it to a carving board. Remove the rack from the roasting pan but leave the roasting pan with all of the glorious drippings to make an incredible gravy.",
      "Carve the gorgeous Thanksgiving turkey to the delight of your guests and enjoy a wonderful Holiday meal!",
      "Note: To roast garlic, preheat the oven to 400 F. Remove the outer paper layers from a head of garlic and cut the top tip off to reveal the tops of the cloves inside. Drizzle the top with a little olive oil, then wrap it in foil and roast it in the oven for an hour. Perfection! Roasted garlic has so many uses! It can be stored in the refrigerator for weeks, so you can make a head of roasted garlic well in advance of Turkey day. I use it in every dish!"

Add another layer of brownie clods, more walnuts, and then another layer of mousse. Add a final layer of brownie clods and lightly pack but do not add additional mousse or walnuts. Snip off the straw about 1/4\" above the brownies. At this point, you may enclose the entire pot in plastic wrap (including the bottom) and refrigerate until needed (maybe up to a day).",

Let the chili simmer, stirring occasionally, till it is nearly the consistency you want. Add another tablespoon of chili powder and 1/2 tablespoon cumin. Stir the spices in and taste. Depending on your preferences, the spices you use and the salt content of your canned goods, you may need to add salt or pepper or increase the amount of chili powder or cumin. Given a choice, I will use almost all the bean and tomato liquid and simmer my chili for a few hours (till it's nearly the consistency of canned chili). If I don't have much time, I'll use less liquid and simmer for less time, but it won't taste as good. The longer this cooks, the better it tastes.",
      "This chili tolerates variations well. I have used (and did for the chili in the photo) black beans (rinse them very well-trust me, use none of the liquid from the can), pinto beans, and a mix of just whatever we had in the pantry at the time. I've used Italian tomatoes with basil, tomatoes with green chilies, and all crushed tomatoes at different times. I've (again, at different times) added unsweetened cocoa powder, star anise (remove before serving), cayenne, ground chipotles, beer, and red wine. I usually don't add any kind of hot peppers unless I'm going to be the only one eating it. I'd rather make my chili well-seasoned but mild, and let folks add Tabasco, salsa, or sliced jalapenos at the table.",
      "Most of the time I used ground beef, but lately we have had a freezer full of ground venison (thanks to my hunter brother-in-law), so that has been my meat of choice for the past few batches. I've used ground turkey, diced chicken, and cheap steak that I cut up pretty small.",
      "For a vegetarian version, I'll cut three or four carrots into about a half-inch dice and brown them with the onions and garlic. The carrots do make for a sweeter chili, but give the mouth feel of meat.",
      "I buy all my spices at \"Your DeKalb Farmer's Market\" in Decatur, GA. They are always fresher than what I find at the grocery store and cost a whole lot less, too. At the in-laws, I have made this with grocery store spices, and I had to use more chili powder and cumin than usual. If you have a good source for high quality spices, pay a little extra if you must; they're worth it. If you live in the metro-Atlanta area, go to YDFM."
