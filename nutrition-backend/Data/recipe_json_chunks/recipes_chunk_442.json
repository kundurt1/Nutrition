Add to the dry ingredients, cutting the ingredients in with a fork or pastry blender, as you would a pastry dough. Mixture will be crumbly. Turn mixture out onto a lightly floured surface and knead gently to blend the ingredients so that they hold together. Divide dough into 2 equal portions and roll into two 15-inch long cylinders. Place each cylinder several inches apart on a cookie sheet lightly coated with vegetable cooking spray. Gently flatten dough to a thickness of 1-inch and bake for 25 minutes or until lightly golden. Remove dough from the oven and allow to cool (on the cookie sheet) on a wire rack for 10 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 325\u00b0. Slide each roll of dough off the cookie sheet onto a cutting board and cut each one into 12 diagonal slices. Return the slices to the cookie sheet about 1/2-inch apart (so that their cut sides can crisp up). Return to the oven to bake an additional 7 to 10 minutes. Remove from the baking sheet and allow to cool completely on a wire rack. Makes 2 dozen cookies."
