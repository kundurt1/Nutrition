Now gently stretch the dough by moving your fists away from each other (see Video). Each time you do this stretch, rotate the dough. Continue stretching and rotating until the dough is thin, about 1/4 inch, and measures about 9 inches across. Unless your dough is still cold from the freezer, it will be so soft that its own weight will stretch it out. Alternatively, use a rolling pin to roll out the dough thinly on a floured board. If you like a very thin pizza, roll the dough out to a 10-inch round. Be careful not to make it too thin, and remember that the thinner the pizza, the less topping it can handle.",

Drizzle with extra-virgin olive oil.",
      "To make a simple flatbread -- Scatter sliced garlic (3 to 4 cloves), minced fresh rosemary (from 1 small sprig), and coarse salt over the dough. Make several 1/2-inch slashes to keep the dough from puffing up. Drizzle with lots of extra-virgin olive oil before baking, and garnish with Parmesan. Serve this delicious \"Pizza Aglio e Olio\" with a salad or cheese.",

      "Cut all chicken pieces in half. This exposes the crucial bone marrow. The more marrow you expose, the better the sauce. I chop the wings into 4 or five pieces. Do not add giblets and neck.",
      "In large pot, combine chicken, salt, Paprika, chicken base, and enough water to just cover the chicken pieces.",
      "Cook, partially covered, at such temperature that a simmer to very gentle boil is achieved. You want just a bit of bubbling.",
      "Do so until the chicken is thoroughly cooked and easily removed from the bone--About 1.5 hrs. (I cook the chicken until it is on the verge of falling off the bone. This extracts maximum flavor from the chicken.)",
      "Strain mixture to separate liquid and chicken. Place chicken into a warm serving dish.",
      "Return liquid to pot, and vigorously mix in sour cream and milk. I use a whisk for this. Carefully bring the sauce to a boil and remove immediately from heat. Failure to remove promptly will result in very messy boiling over!",
      "Set burner to it's lowest setting and return pot to the burner to keep sauce hot. The sauce is basically finished at this point. You may wish to fine tune by adding more salt, sour cream, Paprika, and/or chicken base. I sometimes add a 1/2 cup or so of heavy cream for added richness. You may also want to skim most of the liquid fat from the sauce surface.",
      "Noodles procedure: Combine flour, salt, and eggs in a hemispherical bowl large enough to accommodate mixing.",
      "Add about 1/2 cup water and proceed to blend ingredients with a fork until well blended. The consistency your striving for is such that the dough is clearly wet, adheres to the bowl, and is loose enough to slowly spread out when a dollop is applied to the cutting board. Add enough water to achieve this. I've never measured how much water I use, but think it's about 1/2 cup plus some. Actually, the consistency is not critical. I'm guessing you've made noodles (or dumplings) like this, and that additional, excruciating explanation is not necessary.",
      "Set a Dutch oven (good size pot) 2/3 full of water to boil. At this point, obviously the dough goes into the water. I place a good size dollop on a small cutting board and use a gently curved, sharp knife to cut perhaps 1/2\" size blobs which are then vigorously swept off the board into the boiling water.",
      "They are done when they float to the surface. A perforated spoon is used to remove the noodles from the water which are placed in a warm serving bowl.",
      "I cut perhaps 3-4 dozen noodles, let them cook (very quick), remove, and proceed to add the next 3-4 dozen until all of the dough is consumed. If it looks like boiling over is about to occur, add some cold water.",
      "Finally: At this point you should have a pot of wonderful sauce, a bowl full of chicken pieces, and a bowl of noodles. For serving, place a good serving of noodles and half (maybe less) as much chicken into a flat bowl. Apply enough sauce to almost cover noodles and chicken.",
      "You may want to salt to taste. My wife likes pepper on it. I do not. In any case, Viola! That's it. I really want you to try this, as everyone on both sides of our family loves it. My instructions are laborious because attention paid to various details will produce a superb dish, while an average effort with average ingredients produce a result that is only very good."

      "Place covered into the fridge overnight to get cold. This is done so that when the mixture hits your ice cream maker bowl, a warm mixture will not liquidize the cold gel, and helps with the freezing process.",
      "Pour the measured amount of dry cake mix into a small bowl, and whisk out or sieve out any lumps. The amount here in this recipe is 2/3 of a cup dry mix. Some people like a little less some like more, this is the amount our family enjoys.",
      "Pour the cold custard into the already running ice cream maker.",
      "Sprinkle on the dry cake mix a few spoons at a time through the feed tube. Continue until dry mix is incorporated in custard. This gives you smooth texture. Let your maker continue as manufacturers directions, takes usually 20 minutes or more. If you like some cake batter lumps in the ice cream then put in as unwhisked dry mix later half way or ten minutes before the freezing is complete.",
      "Also at the very end of the freezing when you are ready to remove, and before pouring into your freezer storage container you may add -- another 2 tablespoons dry mix and swirl through with a spatula, if you like lumps of dry mix -- also fold in quartered strawberries and fold through -- or even swirl in your favourite fudge sauce.",
      "Pour into a covered storage container and place in your upright home freezer to freeze solid.",
      "A tip that I do is to taste mixture half way through to see if I have enough flavour, if you like more then you can add another tablespoon or two dry mix. Also for every quart of ice cream you should have 1/2 cup dry mix for flavour incorporated.",
      "When I make this with Lemon Supreme Cake Mix I always fold in the Strawberries, and some toasted coconut at the very end. Makes a nice Lemon Strawberry almost cheesecaky ice cream."

(If using a conventional oven, heat to 425\u00b0F for the first part of the cooking, then reduce the heat to 350\u00b0F for the second part.) Test the meat with a skewer: the juices should run out clear.",
