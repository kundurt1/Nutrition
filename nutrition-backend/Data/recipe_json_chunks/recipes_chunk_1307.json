Take temperature of stuffing in neck cavity and if less than 165\u00b0F, add it to the baking dish. Bake (covered for a moist stuffing or uncovered for a crisp top) until it reaches a minimum of 165\u00b0F.

Cut off and discard the stem end of the squash, then cut off the neck. Use a paring knife or sharp vegetable peeler to slice away the peel deep enough to reach the bright orange flesh of the squash. Trim the neck to straighten the sides, then cut it lengthwise into 1/2-inch-thick slices. Cut the slices into 1/2-inch dice. (You need about 3 cups diced squash.) If you have less than 3 cups, peel the bulb of the squash, cut it in half, and scrape out the seeds. Trim and cut as much of the bulb as you need into 1/2-inch dice. Reserve the remaining squash for another use.",

Cook, stirring the pieces to brown them on all sides, for 4 to 6 minutes, or until tender throughout. Reduce the heat as necessary to cook the squash and brown it lightly, without burning; the best way to see if the squash is fully cooked is to eat a piece. Drain the squash on one end of the paper towel-lined baking sheet and set aside the sage leaves for the garnish. Wipe out the skillet with a paper towel and set aside.",

The mushrooms will absorb the oil and should not weep any liquid. Add the butter, shallots, thyme, and pepper, then toss and saute until the mushrooms are thoroughly cooked, 3 to 4 minutes total. Drain the mushrooms on the paper towel-lined baking sheet. The gnocchi should be cooked in two skillets: Wipe out the mushroom skillet with paper towels and add a light coating of olive oil to it and to a second large skillet.",
      "Heat the oil over medium-high heat until hot. Add 1 tablespoon of the butter to each skillet. When the butter has browned, divide the gnocchi between the two skillets and season to taste with salt and pepper.

Add the remaining 2 tablespoons butter and cook until it is a rich brown, then quickly add the parsley to crackle for a few seconds. Standing back-the butter will spatter-add a squeeze of lemon half.

      "If the temperature climbs above 73\u00b0F in your kitchen, be aware that everything from your countertop to your rolling pin and the flour itself will act as a heat source to the butter.

Prepare the dough as directed, using a generous amount of cornstarch for dusting. The dough will crack along the creases as it's folded, but that's all right. After portioning the dough, roll to just 12 inches. Cut into quarters and transfer to the pie plate one at a time, pressing the pieces together and then sculpting the border like clay.

      "First, rehydrate any dried chilis you are using in the beef stock just heat it slightly so its warm. While that is happening chop your onions and garlic. Put your fat/oil into a large pot and put it over medium heat. Add the onions to brown and salt them liberally to sweat them. Start cutting and seeding your fresh peppers, no need to finely chop them if you have a food processor, if not you will be doing a LOT of chopping so start early. Give the onions a five minute head start then add the garlic to the pot, let them brown for about 5 minutes then add your beef in stages, enough at a time to brown evenly, then your lamb, then your sausage. tomatoes next, then cumin, I use a lot, at least a TBSP, sometimes more, I cook less with exact recipes and more by taste. Oregono, again a lot, about twice as much oregono as you used cumin. Cayenne pepper, about a TBSP, more if you like, if you can't take the heat maybe you should find a different recipe. Take your chiles both fresh and rehydrated and process them in your food processor until you have almost a paste. This is the chile mass. Add the chile mass to the pot, then add one beer, and use as much beef stock as is necessary to volumize your pot to where you need it, just remember it will reduce while it simmers so start with a bit more than you think you need. Then bring it up to heat and simmer, for at least 3 hours, the longer it simmers the better the flavor will be. If you are going to use beans prepare them seperately and add them about 1 hour before serving. Taste often during the cooking process and adjust seasoning as necessary. One thing to note during the tasting, this chili is HOT, the first taste you'll probably choke a bit, if you can take the heat the flavor should be nice and smoky."

If you are using charcoal, preheat a split bed of charcoal to a medium thick ash. Place a drip pan between the mounds of charcoal. Rub the chicken inside and out with 2 tablespoons chili powder, and salt and pepper, and rub the outside of the chicken with 2 teaspoons oil. Remove the label from the unopened can; wash the can. Open the can of beans. Stir the remaining 1 teaspoon chili powder into the beans. Coat the outside of the can with oil. Put the can on a plate or sturdy sheet pan. Lower the chicken onto the can, inserting the can into the internal cavity of the bird. Position the chicken so that the front legs and the can form a tripod holding the chicken upright. Put the chicken and can on the grill away from the heat, cover the grill (without touching the chicken to the grill top) and cook until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of a thigh registers about 170\u00b0F, about 1 1/2 hours. If your grill has an external temperature gauge, it should stay around 350\u00b0F. If you are using charcoal, you will probably have to replenish the coals after the first hour.",

      "Tortellini Blitz consists of a beautiful 5 cheese tortellini (any tortellini would do if you dont have that) in a roasted garlic, pink basil cream sauce with sausage. We bring tortellini to our tail gate already boiled tortellini (for 7 minutes) and put in a cooler. To start, take the sausage and put it on the grill along with the garlic wrapped seperately in tin foil that is sealed so it can roast. leave garlic on the grill for 25 minutes. In a pot (put it on a turkey burner for optimum high heat) sautee 3/8 cup of olive oil, chopped shallots and mushrooms for 5 minutes on medium heat. At this point put in the crushed tomatoes and raise heat to medium/high putting seasoning in with salt and pepper to taste. When the sausage is done, chop into smaller pieces and after the sauce is cooking for 20-25 minutes put the sausage and roated garlic in the sauce. Now dump the torleiini in for 5 minutes. Put the cream, basil and grated cheese at this point and cook for another 2 minutes. Be sure to stir when the tortellini is put in to avoid sticking to the bottom. Shut off flame and serve. Here comes the blitz, crushed pepper(for those who say no...\"if u can't party with the big boyz! Don't show up!!!) This sure is a helluva lot different than hot dogs, hamburgers and suasage that you would get at typical tailgates, which is easy to do and accept the oohs and ahhhs!"

      "I use a plastic container that is microwaveable that the local Chinese carry-out provides (and I wash before re-using). It's round, roughly three inches deep, and about seven inches in diameter. I mash the banana in the plastic, microwaveable container, then I break the hamburger buns (or bread) up, dropping the pieces into the container, then add everything else and stir it well. It should be kind of soupy, about the consistency of a regular cake batter. Stick it in the microwave for around eight minutes on high. Look to see if it's kind of raw in the middle on the top. If so, try another thirty seconds each time you check it until it no longer appears to be raw in the middle. Eight minutes should be approximately correct in an 1100 W microwave on high.",
      "",
      "Make the sauce described in a saucepan, and make sure all the granules of sugar dissolve over the heat into the evaporated milk. Be sure to add the tsp. of rum flavoring to the sauce. The sauce should look kind of white and have the consistency of a sauce that is a little thicker than milk, like melted sugar (which it is).",
      "",
      "When the bread pudding comes out of the microwave, pour the hot sauce over the top of the pudding in the microwaveable container and spread with a rubber spatula. Add an airtight lid, then let it set and absorb the sauce for a while. This stuff I made was even good hours later out of the refrigerator. I think the mashed banana must add moisture. The unusual amount of nutmeg (for me) made it more flavorful than my biscuit pudding recipe, which may need a revamp."

Add the flour and stir with a wooden spoon until the flour is completely incorporated. Continue to cook and stir for 3 to 4 minutes to steam away as much water as possible. The more moisture you can remove, the more eggs you can add later and the lighter your pastry will be. The mixture is ready when a thin film coats the bottom of the pan.",
      "2. Move the mixture to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Although you can mix the pate a choux by hand, this can be rather arduous, so use a mixer if you have one. Stir the mixture for about 1 minute to allow it to cool. Then mix on medium speed and add the first egg. Let it mix in completely and then scrape down the sides of the bowl. Add the remaining eggs, one at a time, and mix in completely. Add the egg whites, a little at a time, until the paste becomes smooth and glossy and will hold a slight peak when pinched with your fingers. Be careful not to add too much egg white or your crullers will become heavy. Transfer the batter to a pastry bag fitted with a 1/2-inch star piping tip.",
      "3. To fry the crullers, heat at least 2 inches of oil in a heavy-bottomed pot until a deep-fat thermometer registers 370\u00b0F. While the oil is heating, cut out twelve 3-by-3-inch squares of parchment paper and lightly grease them. Pipe a ring onto each square. When the oil is hot, place one cruller at a time in the oil, paper side up. Remove the paper with tongs. Fry on each side until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on a paper towel for at least 1 minute. Once cool to the touch, the crullers can be glazed.",
      "Crullers also bake very well, although they will have slightly firmer crusts than the fried versions. Preheat the oven to 450\u00b0F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and pipe the crullers onto it, at least 2 inches apart. Bake for 5 minutes, then reduce heat to 350\u00b0F and bake for another 15 minutes. Turn off the heat, open the oven door slightly and let the crullers sit in the cooling oven for 5 to 10 minutes. Remove, dip in glaze, and cool on a rack until the glaze has set.",
      "Beignets, the classic New Orleans fried dough treats, use this same batter and are even easier to prepare. Simply drop rounded teaspoonfuls of the batter into the oil. As the dough puffs, the beignets will turn themselves over-but keep an eye on them and flip any that need a little help."

Secure the small paddle in the Aeroccino cup. Pour 1 full cup of cold milk into it. Add 1 heaping tablespoon of cocoa power (I've tried Hershey's, Nestle's and Ghiradelli's). Add 1 heaping tablespoon of powdered sugar. Press the button and wait for it to finish. Two minutes later you will have a perfect, unrivalled, sublime cup of hot cocoa. Pour into a drinking mug. Add a dash of vanilla, a sprinkle of cinnamon, a dollop of whipped cream or all three.
