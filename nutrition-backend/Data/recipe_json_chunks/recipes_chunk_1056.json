Stuff the turkey with the onion, orange, celery, carrot, bay leaves, and thyme. Loosely tie the drumsticks together with kitchen string.",
      "For the turkey broth: Heat the oil in a large heavy saucepan over medium high heat. Add the turkey neck, heart, and gizzard to the pan and saute until just beginning to brown, about 1 minute. Add the chopped vegetables and bay leaf to the pan and saute until soft, about 2 minutes. Pour the stock and 3 cups of water into the pan and bring to a boil. Lower the heat to medium-low and simmer until the stock is reduced to 4 cups, about 1 hour, adding the chopped liver to the pan during the last 15 minutes of cooking.",

Continue roasting with the breast side up until an instant-read meat thermometer registers 165 degrees F when inserted into the largest section of thigh (avoiding the bone), about 2 3/4 to 3 hours total cooking time.

Add the remaining 3 cup of broth and bring to a simmer, then transfer to a measuring cup.",
      "In a large heavy saucepan, melt the butter over medium high heat. Stir in the flour and cook, stirring constantly, to make a light roux. Add the hot stock, whisking constantly, then simmer until thickened, about 10 minutes. Add the reserved neck meat and giblets to the pan and adjust seasoning, to taste, with salt and black pepper.

Most of the suet sold in supermarkets these days is suspect, of indeterminate quality and age, and quite likely intended for bird feeders. A butcher would be a more reliable source for suet. If you can't bear the thought of using suet, you can certainly substitute solid vegetable shortening - which also has a relatively high melting point - for suet in most recipes and few people will notice."

Empty the contents of your two cans of Italian style stewed tomatoes in a deep dish pan, add to it everything you just sauteed and don't skimp on the basil or additional garlic.

Then, with a fork, begin to scrape out the contents into the pan with your sauce.

Leave a little squash in each half and use them as the bowls for serving.",

If the fork twists real easy, and the meat pulls apart, it's done. You should also notice that the meat has shrunk form the bone.",
      "Let the meat rest, covered, for at least 15 minutes before you start to \"pull\" it. The traditional method of \"pulling\" pork is to use 2 forks, I like to use tongs and a fork. After it's pulled I sprinkle another tablespoon of Butt Kickin' Blacken on and stir it in, for a little extra flavor. It should be real moist, because of the beer you had in the pan during cooking, but if do you notice that it's a little dry, you can add a little more beer or BBQ sauce at this time.",

If you like a dressing on your salad, Donna Hay combines 2 tablespoons of white wine vinegar with 1 tablespoon of olive oil and tosses the smoked salmon slices and baby spinach leaves in the dressing to combine, and serves it with lemon wedges.",
      "NOTES: Suggested quantities - in the original recipe - for the side salad: 7 ounces (200g) smoked salmon slices, 21/2 (70g) ounces baby spinach leaves. On Donna Hay's website - http://www.donnahay.com.au/ - is a conversion table and a list of commonly used ingredients - and what they are generally called in Australia and America. In many cases, I think we actually use what she has said is the American name and in some cases, the recipes on Zaar use what she has said is the Australian name! Curious! But some of these \"translations\" of terms and names could well be useful!"

Add butter and pulse until mixture resembles coarse sand, about ten 1-second pulses. Add eggs, vanilla, and almond extract (if using) and process until smooth, about 5 seconds, scraping bowl once if needed (batter will be very thick and heavy).",

Cut into wedges and serve.",
      "Note:This recipe works best with Italian plums, which are also called prune plums. If substituting regular red or black plums, use an equal weight of plums, cut them into eighths, and stir them a few times while cooking. Arrange slices, slightly overlapped, in two rings over surface of cake. Do not use canned Italian plums. Blanched whole almonds can be used but must be processed 30 seconds longer until finely ground. The brandy can be omitted, but then you will need to melt the jam with 1 tablespoon water before adding the plums. Don't add the leftover plum cooking liquid to the cake before baking; reserve it and serve with the finished cake or over ice cream. The cake can be served with lightly sweetened whipped cream."

Dry ingredients are better and light flavours don't overpower the asparagus. Add a grind or two of black pepper and a good pinch of salt. Make sure all the chicken is coated with some seasoning.",
      "Drain the asparagus well. Tinned/canned asparagus works really well in this recipe.",
      "The pastry should be defrosted enough to be able to cut the sheets in half. Cut each sheet in half to give you 10 strips.",
      "Put asparagus spears down the middle of each strip. Then lay a strip of chicken beside the asparagus.",
      "Beat an egg lightly and then brush some eggwash along the cut in the middle of the sheet of pastry.",
      "With a sheet in front of you with the cut going left to right (not up and down), take the edge near you and fold it over the chicken and asparagus. Use the folded edge to shove the filling nearer to you until it is tucked around the filling quite tightly.",
      "Now roll up the pastry to the eggwash and make sure the cut edge stays on the bottom of the roll.",
      "Brush the top with egg and sprinkle plenty of sesame seeds on top.",
      "Cut into 6 pieces.",
      "Repeat for the other 9 strips to give you 60 little bites.",
      "Place on a lightly greased baking sheet and bake in the oven for 20 minutes or until the top is golden brown and the pastry is cooked through. The chicken will cook in this time and will still be moist and tasty.",
      "Take the rolls off the baking tray and cool slightly on a wire rack. Then serve warm or leave on the rack and serve cold. They are equally good warm or cold. They can be reheated but, like all pastry dishes, are better freshly baked.",
      "The rolls in the photograph I have posted were made with a low-fat puff pastry. As expected, they haven't puffed up as much as usual pastry but still tasted good. Let's face it, pastry is never going to be a low-fat food so you may as well enjoy it but just not eat it all the time. I'll be going back to the usual next time. 14/12/07 - Edited to add an updated photo of rolls made with regular puff pastry. Also, I increased the amount of chicken.",
      "Note: put the sesame seeds in a dish and discard any that you don't use. They could be contaminated by the chicken so you don't want to put them back in the bag."

Let it rest for one hour or more, while you mix the stuffing.",

If the stuffing is too wet, it will open up the turnovers.",
