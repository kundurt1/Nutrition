Heat skillet over medium high heat till liquid is simmering. In a small bowl, combine the flour with a few spoonfulls of the heated drippings, whisking to remove any lumps. The mixture should resemble runny paste. Once mixture is lump-free, whisk into the rest of the drippings and cook at a simmer, stirring constantly, for 4-5 minutes, till thickened. Add wine (water works, too) to achieve the desired consistency (I add about 1/4 cup, but the amount will vary depending on how much drippings your roast gave you). You will want to taste-test to make sure the gravy doesn't taste \"floury\" (if it does, cook it a bit longer).",

Be careful, the bread sticks are crispy and will break if you are not gentle. Lay wrapped bread stick so it is perpendicular on the rack (if you place it parallel, it will fall through when cooking). Continue until you have filled the rack, leaving about 1/4 inch gap between each bread stick. Sprinkle each bread stick generously with Cheese mixture. Bake at 375 for 20-30 minutes or until bacon is cooked. When bacon is done, remove from oven and sprinkle with additional cheese mixture. Let stand 5 minutes to cool and let the cheese set. Using tongs, transfer to serving platter. When completely cooled, cover with aluminum foil. (If you cover when warm, steam will build up and make them mushy.).",

I love the Garlic Flavored ones, but this is also great with the Rosemary Flavored, Sesame Seed and Plain ones.",

It shrinks when baked and splits and makes a big messy looking thing. If you want to use prosciutto, I'd suggest dipping the bread sticks in an egg wash before wrapping. Also, prosciutto is much more expensive than bacon."

    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "To make the dough we're going to add our flour to a bowl and sprinkle the salt. This is optional, in case you know you don't use salt that's fine too.",
      "Incorporate the salt well, and then we'll pour oil inside it.",
      "Now you want to mix the flour again to make sure all the oil gets incorporated in to the flour and you don't want lumps of oil in there. just for a few seconds.",
      "When the oil and salt are nicely incorporated, add water slowly. This water has been warmed in the microwave for about 30 seconds, pour little at a time and just mix.",
      "We have used whole wheat flour from the Indian store as its a little different from the whole wheat flour that you find in the grocery stores.",
      "The one in the American grocery stores is usually a lot darker in color, so chapattis turn a little browner than you probably like them, this one is available in any Indian store its called chapatti atta and is readily available.",
      "Just mix all that dough in and form a nice ball.",
      "It doesn't take a lot of time at all, but people are scared to do this, because you're using your hands and that freaks people out, but it really is not that bad. It literally takes under a minute to make this dough.",
      "When the dough is in a nice ball, we're going to take just a couple of drops of oil, just to lightly coat it and in that way it doesn't form a dry skin on top of the dough. Then keep it covered for about 15 to 20 minutes.",
      "So if you are not comfortable using your hands while making the dough, here's another alternative way of doing it. Here's the whole wheat flour, I'm going to use the food processor, and if you notice I'm using a chopping blade instead of a dough blade, because it just mixes better and it gets all the edges and there's nothing left at the sides.",
      "I'm going to mix in the salt at this point and I'm going to give it a mix.",
      "Then I'm going to add in the oil.",
      "I've also heated up the water for 30 seconds and am going to pour it in very slowly once i have the food processor on. This is just as easy.",
      "It's best just to give it one knead by hand just to incorporate everything and make sure there's no air bubbles and all in it.",
      "This food processor option is really good if you're making dough in bulk because i understand that dough freezes really well",
      "Then put a couple of drops of oil and just smother a little bit, rub it a little bit so that it doesn't dry out and cover it up. Then set it aside for 15 minutes as before.",
      "After it has been resting for about 15 to 20 minutes we're going to knead the dough one more time quickly.",
      "This is 1 and 1/2 cups of dry flour, so it makes approximately 9 chapattis. But there's no signs involved, so if you like really big chapattis it can be less and if you want small ones you know it'll make more.",
      "But something that fits in to your palm or close fist, a kind of a golf size ball is perfect.So just divide it out.",
      "Before we start rolling out our chapattis we'll go ahead and turn on our stove and get our pan heated.",
      "The pan we are using is called a tawa. You can also use a non stick frying pan.",
      "Put the stove on medium heat, or a little bit higher than medium. And you want to make sure your pan is really hot before you put your first chapatti on.",
      "So while our pan is heating, we're going to take our dough and form a nice round ball. If you start off with a round ball, the shape changes, but your final chapatti will probably be round also.",
      "We're then going to dip it in some dry flour, shake off the excess and role it out.",
      "Now this rolling pin is my favorite. It's a thinner version, but a lot of people are used to the thicker version of the rolling pins. Whatever you have is absolutely fine and if you notice that your chapatti is sticking to the ground or to whatever surface you are rolling out on, take it and dip it again in the dry flour.",
      "This is a trick that my mom taught me when i was learning how to do this when i was little, you rub your hand across it, and instantly you'll feel where its thicker and where it's thinner and then you can just roll the parts that are thicker, that way you don't have a chapatti that is really thin on one side and really thick on the other side that also helps in blowing up when you're cooking it.",
      "The tawa looks hot so we're going to put our rolled chapatti in and move it around to make sure it doesn't stick.",
      "Then we leave it alone until we start seeing bubbles appearing, and then we're going to flip it around, and let go for a few seconds.",
      "Now we're going to take some oil and you can just dip your spoon in to your oil and then whatever is left, the remainder few drops, just put it on and smear it on like that and flip it around and press. You want to press where it bubbles to force the air to the other side which is not risen yet. Smear the oil again and press.",
      "You want to cook the chapatti until you see that all the doughiness is gone and it looks fully cooked. It's ok to have little brown spots on it.",
      "It looks delicious and there's nothing like home made chapattis. You can buy these from the store but when you taste these like fresh off the stove it's awesome.",
      "And one of the other reasons why it doesn't taste as nice sometimes is a lot of people don't use oil in their chapattis, but I put oil inside the dough and what happens with that is that when you eat the chapatti a little bit later on, it still tastes nice and soft, as supposed to the dough which has been prepared without oil, which tends to turn a little bit chewier.",
      "Once the chapatti is cooked I like to keep it in a nice insulated cannister like this. It helps it to stay nice and warm. So you can finish all your chapattis and sit with you family and enjoy your dinner and they'll still be piping hot.",
      "note: if u dont wish to use oil on ur chapatis just use a clean cloth to press the chapatis after u have flipped them the second time n press lightly to ensure the air is distributed evenly and the chapatis wud puff up.enjoy !"

At no point does it claim to be authentic. \" -- pasta e ceci does not use spaghetti! you use mixed broken pasta. It doesn't ever have tomatoes in it or wine, stock or thyme! This is a traditional southern Italian dish & for us this is quite offensive! You need to use a bunch of parsley you make the sauce using tap water making it very soupy then you add the raw pasta & cook it in the sauce adding more water if needed. This will give you the starch you need to thicken the sauce & make the pasta taste of the sauce. to make it in the manner described in the recipe is like putting jam on a hotdog!\" In any case, I hope folks will try the recipe and decide for themselves whether or not they like it. :)."

This will pretty much take all the heat out though so if you want a punch, leave the membranes. We taste tested several cream cheese flavors. We picked 3 fav's, they were the cream cheese mixed with a powdered ranch mix, or mixed with a chipotle seasoning, or mixed with worstershire and garlic powder. (we tried 12 different flavors to get this perfect) Also, I found that 1/2 a strip of bacon was not enough - used the whole thing! And finally after you put the pepper together with cheese and bacon and toothpick - freeze it for 15 minute Then 10 minutes on the grill is perfect.",
      "After making these many times, I can tell you that you really need to make them ahead of time and put them in the refrigerator for a couple of hours or the freezer for about 15 minutes. This will allow the cheese to firm up a bit and it won't all leak out of your peppers. I also have found that if you want them hot, leave all of the membrane inside and some seeds. If you want them barely warm(like me), get almost all of the membrane out from inside the pepper and leave no seeds. I cook them in the oven on 350 for about 45 minutes. ***A low calorie version is use fat free cream cheese and wrap each 1/2 pepper with only 1/2 slice of bacon. They are just as good and only about 60 calories each!"

      "Have the fill prepared beforehand. For the fill - If you want to make it as the original and I suggest you do because it does make a difference - skrlupec (baked cream) and fresh cheese (ricotta) is made as following: Take 5 liter fresh milk (NOT reduced fat!) refrigerated for at least 12 hours in a pot. Slowly warm it up on a stove to a temperature just under boiling and keep it there for a while until a thick layer of cream with a skin forms on the top. Heat the oven to 200\u00b0C and put the milk off the stove to cool down a little. When the oven is at 200\u00b0C put the milk pot into the oven for 10-15 minutes so the cream that formed on the milk gets a thin unevenly brownish crust. Then collect the baked cream from the milk with a spatula or a big spoon and put it in a bowl--this is \"skrlupec\" or baked fresh cream. For fresh cheese (ricotta) put the remaining milk back on the stove and warm it to a simmer slowly. Put a teaspoon (or tablespoon if using less acid vinegar) of apple cider vinegar and salt into the milk and turn off the stove. Milk starts turning into cheese. Leave it to cool down to room temperature (round 1 and 1/2h or more) so you can collect the fresh cheese (ricotta) from the cheese water with a clean cloth. Press the cheese in the cloth to drain it and make it firmer. The cheese has to be white, not green or grey.",
      "Alternatively if you don't want to bother with the extra work or don't have time you can use a ricotta from the store (500 g package) to which you add a mixture of 0.2 l sour cream, 0.1 l milk and 200 grams butter.",

      "Spread the fill evenly on the 4 stretched dough rectangles.",
      "Roll the dough into rolls, close both ends by stuffing the outer ends into the roll - towards the center. Fit the four rolls into a baking pan. If the rolls are too big, fit two and two together.",
