      "Preheat the oven to 425 F. Arrange the sweet potato cubes in a single layer on a baking tray and spray with cooking spray. Sprinkle with salt and nutmeg to taste and shake to coat. Roast the sweet potatoes for 25-35 minutes until cooked through and brown at the edges. How long this takes depends on how large your potato cubes are.",
      "Cook the couscous in a large pot according to package instructions. When done set the pot aside.",
      "While the sweet potatoes are roasting, fry the sage and brown the butter: Heat a skillet to medium heat and add half the butter and the sage leaves to the cold pan, allowing the ingredients to warm slowly together. Swirl the pan to coat the sage in butter and allow them to fry for 5-7 minutes until the sage is dark green. Remove the leaves to a paper towel to drain. They'll continue to crisp as they cool.",
      "Once the sage is cooked and removed from the pan, add the remaining butter to the pan with the remaining sage butter. Swirl to combine it with the sage butter until foamy, for about 2 minutes. When the butter is completely melted and brown bits form on the bottom of the pan, turn the heat off and set the brown butter aside.",
      "To assemble, toss the cooked couscous, sweet potato cubes, scallion, arugula, blue cheese crumbles, and most of the sage leaves in the couscous pot. Taste, and add salt to your preference.",
      "Serve in bowls topped with extra sage leaves and drizzled with the reserved brown butter.",
      "A note on time: I find that to complete this recipe quickly, it's best to start the sweet potatoes, then cook the couscous, fry the sage, and prep the rest of the ingredients while the potatoes are roasting. Everything will be done and ready to mix all about the same time, and you won't be waiting forever for various ingredients to get done!"

      "The first six ingredients are meant for those of you who want to make the tart shell from scratch (those who don't, they are readily available at the grocery store!).",
      "Below are instructions for the tart shell:",
      "Combine the flour, sugar, and salt in a large mixing bowl. Add the butter and mix with a pastry blender or hands until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs (you want your dough to be a little lumpy - pea size is perfect!). Make a well in the middle of the pastry. Combine the egg yolk (reserve the white for later) with the ice water in a small bowl, whisking to blend; pour it into the well and work it in to bind the dough until it holds together without being too wet or sticky. Squeeze a small amount together, if it is crumbly, add more ice water, 1 tablespoon at a time. Form the dough into a disk and wrap in plastic; refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.",
      "Roll out the pastry on a lightly floured surface into a 12-inch circle, about 1/4-inch thick. Carefully roll the dough up onto the pin (this may take a little practice) and lay it inside a 9-inch tart pan with a removable bottom. Press the dough into the pan so it fits tightly; press the edges into the sides of the pan. It is important to press the dough evenly into every nook and corner of the ring, especially the scalloped edges. Shave off the excess hanging dough with a knife. Put the tart shell in the refrigerator for 15 minutes to relax.",
      "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.",
      "Place the tart pan on a sturdy cookie sheet so it will be easy to move in and out of the oven. Line the tart shell with aluminum foil and add pie weights or dried beans to keep the sides of the tart from buckling. Bake for 30 minutes, then remove the foil and weights. Using a pastry brush, lightly coat the crust with the reserved beaten egg white. Return to the oven and continue to bake for another 8 minutes until the tart shell is golden in color, but not brown. Remember the tart will be cooked again with the filling. It should be cooked but light in color so that it will not burn on the second bake. Set aside to cool and lower the oven temperature to 325 degrees F.",
      "For the heavenly filling: Heat the heavy cream and milk in a pot over medium-low flame, until it simmers slightly around the edges. Remove from the heat; add the chopped chocolate and stir until melted and smoothed out. Add the sugar and salt and whisk until well incorporated. Beat the eggs in a small bowl until blended and add them to the chocolate mixture, stir until completely blended. Pour the filling into the cooled tart shell and bake at 325 degrees F for 15 to 20 minutes until the filling is set and the surface is glossy. If you see any bubbles or cracks forming on the surface, take the tart out right away - that means it is beginning to become over baked. Cool before cutting and enjoy!"

Add the applesauce, brown sugar and spices and continue to cook, stirring often, until the apple mixture is bubbling and the sugar begins to caramelize, roughly another 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and allow to cool to room temperature.",

On a generously floured work surface, roll half of the pie dough into a rectangle. Size depends on your baking sheet, but it should make a rectangle that's roughly 9\" x 12\". Place the dough rectangle onto a non-stick baking sheet or a sheet lined with parchment or a silicone baking mat.",

If you like, place the entire rectangle over the apple mixture, lining up both crusts. Using a sharp paring knife, cut a dozen or so 1/2\" slits into the top crust to allow the steam to vent while baking.",

Using a fork or your fingers, again crimp the edges all the way around to seal the deal. Hint: you may want to keep extra flour nearby to keep your fork or fingers from sticking while you crimp.",

Press batter down lightly with the back of a spoon to flatten. Fry, adjusting burner as necessary to maintain oil temperature, keeping it between 325 and 350 F. Fry them until they are deep golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer fritters to a wire rack set inside of a rimmed baking sheet. Bring oil back to 350 F and repeat with remaining batter. Let fritters cool 5 minutes.",

      "You will also need:",
      "1. A coffee grinder for coarsely cracking the coffee beans or a plastic bag with a mallet or hammer.",
      "2. A medium-sized, heavy-bottomed saucepan.",
      "3. A strainer lined with 1 or 2 thicknesses of cheesecloth.",
      "4. A large bowl",
      "5. An ice cream maker.",
      "6. A small, heavy-bottomed saucepan.",
      "For the ice cream:",
      "1. Coarsely crack the coffee beans by placing them in a coffee grinder and quickly turning the machine on and off several times. Alternately, the beans may be placed in a plastic bag and crushed with a mallet or hammer.",
      "2. Put the milk, the sugar and the cracked coffee beans in the medium-sized saucepan and heat them together over medium heat, stirring, until the sugar is dissolved. Remove the pot from the burner and let the coffee beans steep in the sweet milk for 1 hour.",
      "3. Place the strainer lined with cheesecloth over the bowl and pour the coffee-flavored milk through the strainer to remove the coffee beans. Bring up the edges of the cheesecloth and squeeze as much of the remaining liquid out of the beans into the bowl as possible Discard the beans and cheesecloth.",
      "4. Into the bowl of coffee milk, add the heavy cream, the vanilla extract, 1/2 teaspoon of finely ground coffee and a dash of salt. Cover the bowl and chill the mixture in the refrigerator until it is cold. Then make the ice cream in an ice cream maker, according to the directions for your machine.",
      "5. A suggestion for storing: Homemade ice cream stores well in a glass container, with a sheet of plastic wrap or parchment paper pressed close to its surface to help prevent the formation of ice crystals.",
      "For the dark chocolate sauce:",
      "Note: This is the dark chocolate sauce used in another diplomatickitchen recipe here on TastyKitchen: Soft Chocolate Cake in a Beggar's Purse. It is repeated here for convenient reference.",
      "1. Add the chopped chocolate, milk and cream into the small saucepan and melt the chocolate over low heat, stirring often.",
      "2. Once the chocolate is melted add the frozen butter, a few pieces at a time.",
      "3. Add the vanilla, remove the pan from the heat and set the sauce aside until you are ready to put the desserts together. Reheat the sauce briefly before using it and thin it with a little more milk if you prefer a slightly thinner sauce with ice cream. Any leftover sauce keeps well refrigerated for many weeks.",
      "Serving suggestion:",
      "1. For 8 desserts, place 16 scoops of ice cream on a baking pan lined with parchment and set the pan in the freezer. By forming the ice cream into balls several hours in advance, putting the desserts together is quicker and the ice cream is not liable to melt before it is served.",
      "2. In tall-sided clear glasses, place a spoonful of chocolate sauce, then a scoop of ice cream, another spoonful of sauce, a second scoop of ice cream, and finally, more chocolate sauce. A small branch of fresh mint is a pretty decoration.",
      "An acknowledgement: The dark chocolate sauce recipe is adapted from one in \"The Dione Lucas Book of French Cooking \" (1973)."

Using all of the milk will make it more of a glaze than a frosting, so use the amount of milk that's needed to reach your desired consistency. Set aside.",

      "3. Dock the puff pastry with a fork a bunch of times, leaving about a 1 inch border around the perimeter of the pastry. Put it into the refrigerator while you prepare the rest of the ingredients. Remove the pastry from the refrigerator only when all the ingredients are ready to be assembled. Proceed to the frangipani recipe below and prepare that while the pastry chills.",
      "4. Preheat oven to 350 F. Spread the frangipani evenly over the bottom of the tart; leave that same 1 inch border.",
      "5. Distribute the figs evenly across the pastry placing them cut side up over the frangipani.",
      "6. Sprinkle the raspberries evenly over the tart, in between the figs. The fruit appears to sit on the tart but the frangipani and the pastry will puff up in the baking process, and the fruit will be nestled into the filling.",
      "7. Place into a 350 F oven and bake for 30 to 40 minutes; turn the pan halfway through the cooking.",
      "8. Then remove the pan from the oven and allow the tart to cool.",
      "9. Put the jam/jelly into a small heatproof bowl. Heat it either in the microwave for 10 seconds, or set the bowl of jam into a larger bowl of hot water and stir until it melts.",

      "For the frangipani:",
      "1. In a food processor (mini food processor can be used) pulse the almonds and half of the sugar, until it resembles sand.",
      "2. Add the flour to the food processor and pulse to mix.",
      "3. In a medium bowl whisk together the softened butter and the other half of the sugar, until it is light and fluffy.",
      "4. Whisk in the whole egg and the egg yolk.",
      "5. Stir in the almond extract and the vanilla extract.",
      "6. Mix in the ground almond mixture.",

Pour the pureed pineapple into the cheesecloth and put it into the refrigerator overnight (or at least several hours but given the next step, overnight usually works best).",
      "2. Also on the day before, for the filling, put the cashews in a bowl and cover them with water. Soak these overnight.",
      "3. The next day ... To make the crust, line the bottom of a small springform pan or bundt pan with removable centre with parchment paper.",
      "4. Using a food processor, pulse the almonds, coconut, cinnamon and salt until you have a finely chopped, crumbly mixture. Add the remaining ingredients for the crust and then pulse to combine. Empty the mixture into the pan you will bake it in, and press the mixture firmly into the bottom.",
      "5. For the filling, using the food processor again, add the drained cashews and almond milk. Puree this mixture until completely smooth. Then add the 1 1/2 cups of fresh pineapple that was diced and reserved earlier. Also add the salt, lemon juice and agave nectar and again puree until smooth. Depending on the quality of your food processor, at this point you can either transfer the mixture to a blender and continue pureeing until extremely smooth or attempt to achieve this creamy consistency with the food processor. In either case, while the processor or blender is running, drizzle in the melted coconut oil. Once completely blended and smooth, pour this mixture over the crust and use a spatula to smooth the top. Place the cake in the freezer for at least two hours or until solid.",
      "6. Once firm, remove the cake from the freezer and spoon the pineapple puree from the sieve over the top. Smooth it out, refrigerate for another 1/2 hour and enjoy.",

If you have some other meats or veggies lying around that you'd prefer, go for it. Or mix up the bread (sometimes I like to put mine on a blueberry bagel). And, since it's so big, you could even share it."

Once all of the templates are cut out of waxed paper lay the shapes over the second cake and trim the cake with a sharp knife.",

      "1. A pot that's big enough to boil the potatoes.",
      "2. A dishtowel.",
      "3. A paring knife",
      "4. A food mill fitted with the large-holed plate...if your mill comes with several plates with different sized holes.",

      "9. A deep fry or candy thermometer.",
      "10. A slotted spoon.",
      "11. A baking sheet lined with brown paper bags or paper towels.",
      "Making the croquettes:",
      "1. Fill a pot with salted water. Add the whole, unpeeled potatoes and bring them to a boil over medium heat. Cook them until they are tender. For large potatoes this will take 35-40 minutes but you can check them with a fork to make sure. When they are fork tender drain them and peel them while they are still hot. (Cradling a hot potato in a dishtowel in one hand as you peel it with the other will get the job done without burning your hands.)",
      "2. Run the potatoes through the food mill into a large bowl. Set them aside to cool to room temperature...for, perhaps 30 minutes.",
      "3. Separate the egg, placing the white in a small bowl and adding the yolk into the cooled potatoes. Mix the yolk into the potatoes, along with the butter, flour, salt and nutmeg.",
      "4. Beat or whisk the egg white until it is frothy. Spread out dried bread crumbs on a plate. Place the bowl of egg white and the plate of crumbs out on your work area.",
      "5. Knead the potato mixture briefly with your hands. Form the mixture into 14 golf ball sized balls and shape the balls into cylinders. There are photos of the shaped croquettes on the related link.",
      "6. Bread the croquettes: Dip each in the egg white and then roll it in the bread crumbs. Place them as they are breaded on a plate or baking sheet.",
      "7. Pour enough vegetable oil into a deep pot so that the croquettes will float freely as they fry. Heat the oil to 350 F, monitoring the temperature with the candy thermometer. When the oil is at 350 F carefully lower 4 croquettes one at a time into the oil with a slotted spoon, and fry them, turning them occasionally with the spoon, until they are golden brown. This will take only a few minutes.",
      "8. With the slotted spoon, remove the croquettes to the brown paper or paper towel-lined baking sheet to drain.",
      "9. Bring the oil back to 350 F before adding the next 4 croquettes for frying. Continue frying the rest of the croquettes in the same manner and serve them hot.",
      "This recipe makes 14 croquettes.",
      "A note and an acknowledgement: The croquettes in the photo are served with Orange Remoulade Sauce, the recipe for which is also on the related link. The croquettes recipe is adapted from one on the bavariankitchen.com website, a source for many good Bavarian and other traditional German dishes."

Essentially, you plop some cold mashed potatoes on a little pie dough and bring up the sides, leaving the potatoes exposed at the top. You bake them a little while, top them with some cheese and bacon, and then bake them a little longer. That's it!",
      "To make the mashed potatoes (the day before serving):",
      "You, of course, do not need to make my version of these mashed potatoes. Feel free to substitute your own favorite mashed potato recipe. Plain, 'ol mashed potatoes work great. If you want to try a new mashed potato recipe, I think you will like this one.",
      "In a large pot, add the peeled and cut potatoes. Cover with cold water by 1\". Bring to a boil and add about a tablespoon of kosher salt or 1/2 tablespoon of table salt. Cover and reduce the heat and simmer the potatoes until fork tender, about 12 to 14 minutes. Turn off the heat and drain the potatoes. Immediately return the hot potatoes to the hot pan and allow the excess water to evaporate.",
      "While the potatoes are simmering, heat a small skillet over medium heat with 2 tablespoons of butter. Add the scallions and cook for about 3 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for another minute or two. Set aside until needed.",
      "Add the cream cheese to a mixing bowl and beat for a few seconds.",
      "Use a ricer or potato masher to mash the potatoes. Transfer the potatoes to the mixing bowl with the cream cheese. Add the scallion/garlic mixture as well as the remaining butter. Beat the potatoes until everything is incorporated, scraping the bowl as needed. Add the milk (or half-and-half or cream), sour cream, and some salt. Beat until incorporated. If desired, add additional milk, but don't get the potatoes too thin. Add pepper if desired. Taste for salt and adjust as needed. Place the potatoes in a bowl, cover, and refrigerate overnight.",
      "To assemble the boats:",
      "Unwrap one sheet of the dough and unroll it. Use a rolling pin to smooth out the dough and roll it out just a tad thinner. Cut three 5-inch circles out of the dough (I use the lid of a 42-oz. oatmeal container as a guide). You may re-roll the scraps and make additional circles.",
      "Add 1/3 cup of the cold mashed potatoes to each of the centers of the dough. Lightly brush some water (not too much!) around the outer edge of the dough. Slide your index finger and thumb about 3/4\" under the dough on the right side of the circle. Lift up slightly and allow a little of the dough to drop between your index finger and thumb. Squeeze together to form the bow of the boat. Repeat using your left hand on the left side of the circle to form the stern of the boat.",
      "Decoratively pleat the sides of the boat. When finished, the boat should be an oval shape. If desired, you may add some additional mashed potatoes to the top. Note: the more potatoes you add, the more likely the boats will spread out (or the pleats will open) during baking. When using extra potatoes, take extra time to make sure your pleats are well sealed. The recipe for my mashed potatoes makes more than you will need for the boats, so you should have plenty of extra mashed potatoes left to mound more on the top, if desired.",
      "Repeat this process for the other boats. You may also roll out the second sheet of dough and cut out more boats, making a total of six. After all of the boats have been made, you may place them in a deep dish, cover with plastic wrap, and keep refrigerated until ready to bake. I often do this a couple of hours before my guests arrive for dinner. This way, I only need to throw the boats in the oven when everybody shows up for dinner. This is why this recipe is perfect for small dinner parties.",
      "To bake the boats, preheat the oven to 350F. When the oven is hot, place the boats on a sheet pan (uncovered) and bake for 20 minutes. Remove the boats from the oven and top with a small mound of sharp cheddar cheese. Return the sheet pan to the oven and bake for 4 minutes longer. Remove the sheet pan one additional time and add some bacon bits to the top. Return to the oven and bake for about 3 minutes longer.",
      "When fully cooked, add a small dollop of sour cream or ranch dip on top (if desired) and sprinkle with some chopped scallions. Chris-cross a couple of chives on top (to look like oars for the boat). Feel free to warm up any extra mashed potatoes in case people want a second helping of the potatoes."

When chocolate is set, wrap each sandwich individually in waxed paper, then store in a ziploc freezer bag. These will keep several days in the freezer.",

If the verrines aren't made very far in advance, allow at least 30 minutes for the vegetables to marinate in the refrigerator before making the verrines. Assemble the verrines right before serving.",
      "Making the eggplant layer:",
      "1. Preheat the oven to 375 F. Cut the eggplants in half lengthwise, rub a little olive oil over their cut surfaces, place them cut side down on the baking sheet and roast them until they are tender, for perhaps 30-40 minutes. When done, remove them from the oven and allow them to cool slightly.",
      "2. When the eggplants are cool enough to handle, scrape out their roasted flesh with a spoon into a bowl. Discard the empty shells.",
      "3. Heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil in the frying pan, add the eggplant flesh and cook it over medium heat for a minute, stirring it about with a wooden spoon or spatula. Add the thyme and a few grinds of pepper and salt and cook a few minutes more to combine the flavours. Then, remove it from the heat and set the eggplant aside to cool a few minutes.",
      "4. When the eggplant has cooled a bit, place it in the food processor with 1 tablespoon of the lemon juice and the 2 teaspoons of Dijon mustard. Process until the mixture is smooth. Transfer it to a bowl and add 1/3 of the green onions. Cover the eggplant mixture and refrigerate it.",
      "Making the zucchini layer:",
      "1. Toast the coriander seeds in a dry pan over medium heat for a minute or two until they pop and become fragrant. Then remove them from the heat and crush them coarsely with a mortar and pestle or on the side of a broad knife blade. Coarsely crush the pink peppercorns in the same way.",
      "2. Cut the zucchini in small cubes and place them in a bowl. Mix the little cubes with 1 tablespoon of the lemon juice, 1 tablespoon of olive oil, the toasted, crushed coriander seeds and crushed pink peppercorns.",
      "3. Stir in 1/3 of the green onions. Cover the bowl and refrigerate the marinated zucchini.",
      "Making the tomato layer:",
      "1. Cut the tomatoes in small pieces. Place them in the third bowl and mix them with 2 tablespoons of olive oil, the chopped fresh cilantro (coriander), the last 1/3 of the green onions, and several grinds of black pepper and salt. Cover and refrigerate the tomato mixture.",
      "Assembling the verrines:",
      "1. Spoon into each glass: first, a layer of eggplant; second, a layer of zucchini; and last (on top), a layer of marinated tomato.",
      "2. Place two rounds of bread at the side of each verrine. A twig of dried thyme looks pretty arranged on top.",

Once they are all chopped up (it is okay if some are a little smashed) slice your stick of butter (you can use two if you have been especially good) over the top of the potatoes.

Knead the dough within the confines of the bowl for a few minutes, just until it is smooth. Let the dough rise, covered with a kitchen towel or plastic wrap, for 2 hours.",
      "After the dough has risen, place the dough in the refrigerator for 2 hours or even as long as overnight. Overnight is preferred. The stint in the refrigerator is called retarding the dough, as it stops the rising of the dough for the time being. It helps to build the flavor of the dough.",
      "Once the dough has retarded, roll the dough out into a large rectangle. The size doesn't really matter, but 9 inches by 18 inches is a good size. Cream the butter in a stand mixer. Spread the butter over the right 2/3 of the dough. I've found this is most easily done with your hands. Fold the dough into thirds like a letter. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 hour. If ever the butter squeaks out while handling the dough just cover the opening with flour. Always flour the dough and the work surface throughly when working with it.",

      "Roll out the dough into a large rectangle about 1/4 inch thick and 10 inches in width. The length will probably be about 18 inches, but the important thing is that you can, with a bench cutter, cut fifteen 3 1/2 inch rectangles. I got 12 out of a perfect rectangle I made with my bench scraper, and 3 with the scraps I cut off to make the rectangle.",
      "Take a square of dough and, using a rolling pin, roll the dough up and down a few times to make a rectangle with the short side towards you. Place a square of chocolate (Ghirardelli bars have 8 squares per bar, so one is leftover) in the center of the dough with one edge of the chocolate square up against the top edge of the rectangle, furthest way from you. Roll the dough around the square (it should cover the square once with a little bit to spare) and seal the edge around the chocolate. I do this by pressing the wrapped chocolate towards the counter when I get a centimeter of dough to spare and rotating the top of the square of chocolate around towards me as if rolling it again, while pressing the bottom down and away from me. This sounds really complicated, but it's not. It just smears the dough onto itself. Place the chocolate-filled square of dough on one of 2 baking sheets covered with parchment paper. Repeat with the remaining squares of dough.",
      "Let the croissants rise, covered with kitchen towels, plastic wrap, or paper towels, for about 1 hour, or until they are puffy.",
      "Preheat the oven to 400\u00b0F. Just before the oven is hot enough, combine the egg and milk in a small bowl and brush the egg wash to cover the top of each croissant completely. Place the pans in the oven on two different racks and bake for 7 minutes. After 7 minutes switch the position of the pans (the top one goes to the bottom and vice versa) and bake for another 7 minutes, or until the croissants have browned. They can be eaten hot or cooled.

    "title": "moroccan flatbread (r\u2019ghayef) ~  pain marocain",
    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "A note about flour and water for this bread:",
      "Flour varies from place to place. The Diplomatickitchen version of this flatbread consistently uses 7 tablespoons of water. The signs that the dough is done are the same no matter what flour is used and are described in the instructions below.",
      "A question of timing:",
      "The dough for Moroccan Flatbread may be made and used after a 30 minute rest. Another method is to mix the dough the night before using it, cover it with plastic wrap and leave it at room temperature until the next day. Either timing makes a good flatbread. There are small differences in the results. The overnight version is slightly more pliable and tears less easily than the quicker one which is somewhat less elastic and resembles tortilla dough in its texture. Also, the overnight timing makes a slightly puffier flatbread. The question is rather which bread you prefer and which timing, than which is better. (Both types are pictured in the related link.)",
      "You will also need:",
      "1. Two small bowls, a large mixing bowl and, for the overnight method, a medium-sized bowl for resting the dough.",
      "2. A sifter.",
      "3. A standing mixer, preferably one with a paddle attachment, is optional and convenient for mixing the dough. But it may be done by hand instead.",
      "4. A pastry board and rolling pin.",
      "5. Two sheets of parchment paper, each about 24-inches long.",
      "6. A stove-top griddle or grill with a flat side or a wide, heavy-bottomed pan.",
      "For the dough:",
      "1. In a small bowl, mix the yeast with 6 tablespoons of warm water and set it aside until it is creamy and smooth.",
      "2. Sift the flour and salt into the bowl of the mixer (or any mixing bowl if mixing by hand). Using the paddle attachment, turn on the mixer and pour in the yeast and water.",
      "3. After a few minutes of mixing, if there remain scraps and flakes of dryish dough at the bottom of the bowl that will not combine easily with the dough ball, add the reserved 1 tablespoon of water. Continue mixing. If you have added an additional tablespoon of water, the dough will now appear sticky and leave a liquid-ey flour paste on the sides of the bowl. But further mixing (not more flour) will change the dough's texture. It is ready when the sides of the bowl are clean and the dough forms a compact, not very sticky ball. Leave it to rest, covered, for 30 minutes or place it in a dry bowl, cover it with plastic wrap and leave it at room temperature overnight.",
      "Making the filling:",
      "1. Finely chop the parsley and onion and combine them in a bowl.",
      "2. Stir the softened butter, paprika and cumin together in a larger bowl.",
      "3. Then mix in the chopped parsley and onion and the salt and set the bowl of filling aside.",
      "Rolling out the dough:",
      "1. Divide the dough into 4 pieces and roll them into balls. Place them on a small plate next to the pastry board.",
      "2. Spread out the two sheets of parchment paper next to the board. (The flattened circles of dough are placed on the paper.)",
      "3. Pour a teaspoon of oil on the pastry board and spread it all over the board with your hands.",
      "4. Place a ball of dough on the board and roll it out into a circle of about 10-inches (26cm) in diameter. Flip the circle once, as you roll it out, so that both sides of it are pressed against the oiled surface. The circle won't be regular.",
      "5. Transfer the circles, as you make them, to the sheets of parchment paper (2 circles per sheet).",
      "Spreading on the filling:",
      "When all 4 dough balls are flattened into thin circles, divide the filling among them and spread it out over their surfaces with your fingers. (Forming these flatbreads may lead you on the backroads of your memories to preschool days of fingerpainting and modeling clay.)",
      "Forming the flatbreads:",
      "1. The final step is to fold the dough circles several times so that the baked bread is multi-layered. Each circle will be folded into thirds. Imagine the circle divided horizontally into three parts. Pick up the third nearest you and fold it up over the second third.",
      "2. Then, pick up these two-thirds together and fold them over the last third. The circles have now been transformed into long strips.",
      "3. Turn the strips of dough so that a short end is nearest you. Again, imagine the strips divided horizontally into thirds. Flip the third nearest you up over the middle third.",
      "4. Then flip the last third (the one furthest away from you)under the first two thirds that are folded one on top of the other. You'll now have a square of folded dough. See the related blog link if you need a better visual.",
      "5. On the top of each square, there will be a V-shaped space, revealing a bit of the filling. Pull the top fold of dough across to cover the filling.",
      "6. The squares should be between 2 and 3-inches in size. Make them larger (to a size of between 3 and 4-inches) by placing each one in the palm of one hand and pressing and pushing out on it gently with the rounded part of the palm of your other hand. Ideally you do this without making any tears in the pastry. But ... sometimes tears happen. Small ones may be pressed back together. If a little filling presses through the cracks, the finished bread will be colored by the paprika and more buttery on the surface than ones without tears. Either way, the bread will be good. (And if there are air bubbles beneath the surface, just leave them there. They are all to the good and help form the layers inside the bread.)",
      "Griddle-baking or skillet-baking the bread:",
      "1. Preheat the griddle or stove top grill (flat side up) or the skillet over medium heat. Brush it very lightly with oil.",
      "2. Place a couple of flatbreads on the griddle (or in the skillet). Cook them for 2 minutes or until they are golden on one side.",
      "3. Flip them and cook them 2 minutes more or until they are golden on the second side. Transfer them to a cutting board.",
      "4. Cook the remaining flatbreads in the same way.",
      "5. Cut each flatbread into 4 triangles and serve them hot.",
      "A suggestion: R'ghayef is a nice bread to accompany soup. The small triangles are good, as well, placed around a Greek salad. The bread is equally fine all on its own, served as an hors d'oeuvre or snack. And, the bread also travels well for taking on picnics.",

      "Note: The terms \"fruits de bois\" (fruits of the forest) and \"fruits rouges\" (red fruits) are interchangeable. You may find either label on a package of these mixed fruits. Many different varieties are included in the list of berries classified as \"fruits de bois\": blackberries, blueberries, raspberries, red and black currants, to name a few. The pictured drink is made from a mixture of frozen red and blackcurrants, strawberries, raspberries, and blueberries. Any combination which includes currants will make a similar, good drink. Using only a couple of different berries from packs of single frozen fruits would also work well, for example, mixing frozen redcurrants and frozen blackberries.",
      "You will also need:",
      "1. A blender or a food processor, large pitcher and whisk. (While a processor purees the berries for the first step of the recipe very well, it may not process the quantity of liquid required for mixing this cocktail without leaking.)",
      "2. A large bowl.",
      "3. A large strainer.",
      "4. A wooden spoon, or any large spoon or stiff spatula.",
      "For the cocktail:",
      "1. Place the strainer over a large bowl and fill the strainer with the frozen fruit. Thaw the fruit, collecting the juices that drip from them in the bowl.",
      "2. Place the fruit and juices in a blender or processor. Set the bowl and strainer aside to use again momentarily, and puree the berries. If you are using a blender, after transferring the fruit puree back to the strainer, rinse the container and set it aside to mix the cocktail in later.",
      "3. Pour the berry puree back into the large strainer and strain the puree into the bowl below it by stirring it through the holes of the strainer with a spoon or spatula.",
      "4. Put the strained puree back in the blender. Add the white wine, Champagne or sparkling wine, and liqueur and blend everything together. Alternatively, whisk together in a pitcher or a bowl.",
      "5. Pour the cocktail into glasses, decorate with sprigs of mint if you like, and serve.",
      "Adapted from a recipe for a fresh redcurrant cocktail, Cassiskaland, in the Hungarian cooking journal Konyha Magazin (July-August 2001)."

    "directions": [
      "Preheat oven to 400\u00b0F and grease a large baking sheet. Zest and juice the limes, set the zest and juice aside in separate dishes. Coarsely chop the cranberries and place in a small bowl with 3 tablespoons sugar.",
      "In a large bowl combine the flour, remaining 1/2 cup sugar, baking powder and salt. Cut in the butter with a fork or pastry cutter until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Stir in the lime zest. Stir the cranberries into the flour mixture. Whisk together the egg, egg yolk and cream, then add to the flour mixture. Stir together just until combined.",
      "On a well-floured surface with floured hands, gently pat dough into a 1-inch-thick round (about 8 inches in diameter). With a sharp knife, cut the round into thirds one way, then make perpendicular slices the other direction to make diamond-shaped scones. Depending on how you slice them, you should get about 10 to 11 scones.",
      "Use your hands to gently shape any leftover scraps into scones. Do NOT roll the dough out - just use your hands. Place scones onto a greased baking sheet. Bake for 15-20 minutes or until lightly golden. Remove from the oven and let cool on a wire rack.",
      "For the lime glaze:",
      "In a small bowl combine the juice from the zested limes and enough powdered sugar to reach your desired consistency. You may use more powdered sugar if you want a thicker glaze, and you can add additional lime zest to the glaze for extra flavor. Drizzle glaze over warm scones and allow to cool",
      "Tips: When making scones, it is best to handle the dough as little as possible. Stir just until the wet ingredients are incorporated into the dry. Use your hands to pat the dough into a circle, don't roll the dough out."

You can find these noodles in Asian markets, and they are now beginning to show up in local grocery stores in the ethnic aisle. Vermicelli is another nice option.",

Add the boiling water, and with some tongs, stir around, cooking the noodles. These will only take a few minutes to cook (you can follow package instructions for the timing), so keep an eye on them. They will get mushy - so make sure to remove them from the water as soon as they are done.",
