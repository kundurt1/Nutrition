Mix the 1 cup of sifted flour with the fancy diced mixed fruit and nuts and add to the batter. Line 2 greased 3 1/2 x 7 1/2-inch loaf pans with waxed paper, allowing 1/2-inch to extend above all sides of pan. Pour batter into pans. Do not flatten. Bake in preheated 275\u00b0 oven for 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Place pan containing 2 cups water on bottom shelf while baking. Cakes baked with water in oven have greater volume, moist texture and a smooth, shiny glaze. If decoration of nuts and cherries are used, place on cake at end of 2 hours. Store in a covered container in a cool place. This recipe makes about 4 1/2 pounds."
