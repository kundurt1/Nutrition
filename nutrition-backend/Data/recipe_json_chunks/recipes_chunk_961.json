      "Pierce sweet potato skin with a fork in several places. Wet a paper towel, and place on a glass pie plate. Put sweet potato on the towel, then fold wet paper towel over top of it loosely. Place in microwave, and cook on high for 3 minutes. Turn potato over, cover again with the towel, and cook an additional 3 minutes. Test for tenderness. When potato can be easily pierced through with a fork, it is done. Cool slightly. Cut potato in half and cool a little more. Scoop out flesh into a measuring cup. Line a cookie sheet with waxed paper and sprinkle lightly with flour. Use about the same measurement of flour, starting with a little less. Work into a dough that is slightly sticky. Roll portions of the dough into about a 1\"-round snake. Chop into about 1\" chunks. Using well-floured fingers and board, roll each chunk into a little shell. (lots of youtube videos that show this technique). Place on cookie sheet in single layer to dry, until ready to cook. When ready to cook, boil a large pot of well-salted water. Drop gnocchi in, about a dozen at a time. When they rise to the top, cook for about 1 minute, then remove with a spider to the sauce. Keep warm.",
      "Sauce: Heat oil in large frying pan. Saute onions until soft. Add mushrooms and cook for a few minutes. Add garlic - cook about 30 seconds. Splash in a little wine or water, and continue cooking on low. Add the tomatoes now, if using. Add salt, pepper and seasonings to your liking.",
      "When gnocchi are ready, have pan on medium low heat. Add gnocchi to mushroom-onion mixture as they are done. Keep warm. Serve with grated Parmesan."

Line 13 by 9-inch baking dish with two 24-inch-long sheets of 18-inch-wide heavy-duty foil, positioning sheets perpendicular to each other and allowing excess foil to extend beyond edges of pan. Pat brisket dry with paper towels. Place brisket fat side up on cutting board; using dinner fork, poke holes in meat through fat layer about 1 inch apart. Season both sides of brisket liberally with salt and pepper.",
      "Heat 1 teaspoon oil in 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat until oil just begins to smoke. Place brisket fat side up in skillet (brisket may climb up sides of skillet); weight brisket with heavy Dutch oven or cast-iron skillet and cook until well browned, about 7 minutes. Remove Dutch oven; using tongs, flip brisket and cook on second side without weight until well browned, about 7 minutes longer. Transfer brisket to platter.",
      "Pour off all but 1 tablespoon fat from pan (or, if brisket was lean, add enough oil to fat in skillet to equal 1 tablespoon); stir in onions, sugar, and 1/4 teaspoon salt and cook over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until onions are softened and golden, 10 to 12 minutes. Add garlic and cook, stirring frequently, until fragrant, about 1 minute; add tomato paste and cook, stirring to combine, until paste darkens, about 2 minutes. Add paprika and cayenne and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Sprinkle flour over onions and cook, stirring constantly, until well combined, about 2 minutes. Add broth, wine, bay, and thyme, stirring to scrape up browned bits from pan; bring to simmer and simmer about 5 minutes to fully thicken.",
      "Pour sauce and onions into foil-lined baking dish. Nestle brisket, fat side up, in sauce and onions. Fold foil extensions over and seal (do not tightly crimp foil because foil must later be opened to test for doneness) Place in oven and cook until fork can be inserted into and removed from center of brisket with no resistance, 3 1/2 to 4 hours (when testing for doneness, open foil with caution as contents will be steaming). Carefully open foil and let brisket cool at room temperature for 20 to 30 minutes.",
      "Transfer brisket to large bowl; set mesh strainer over bowl and strain sauce over brisket. Discard bay and thyme from onions and transfer onions to small bowl. Cover both bowls with plastic wrap, cut vents in plastic with paring knife, and refrigerate overnight.",
      "About 45 minutes before serving, adjust oven rack to lower-middle position; heat oven to 350 degrees. While oven heats, transfer cold brisket to cutting board. Scrape off and discard any congealed fat from sauce, then transfer sauce to medium saucepan and heat over medium heat until warm, skimming any fat on surface with wide shallow spoon (you should have about 2 cups sauce without onions; if necessary, simmer sauce over medium-high heat until reduced to 2 cups). While sauce heats, use chef's or carving knife to slice brisket against grain into 1/4-inch-thick slices, trimming and discarding any excess fat, if desired; place slices in 13 by 9-inch baking dish. Stir reserved onions and vinegar into warmed sauce and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper. Pour sauce over brisket slices, cover baking dish with foil, and bake until heated through, 25 to 30 minutes. Serve immediately.",
      "To Make and Serve the Brisket on the Same Day: If you would like to make and serve the brisket on the same day, after removing the brisket from the oven in step 4, reseal the foil and let the brisket stand at room temperature for an hour. Then transfer the brisket to a cutting board and continue with the recipe to strain, defat, and reheat the sauce and slice the meat; because the brisket will still be hot, there will be no need to put it back into the oven once the reheated sauce is poured over it."

Stir all ingredients together using a baker's bread whisk or heavy spoon. Add 1 cup of flour and mix inches Add the second cup of flour and mix. The flour should now be added in 1/4 cup increments until the dough pulls together as a ball. Flour a work surface and remove the dough ball from the bowl.",

Combine the rest of the ingredients in a small bowl and cover the bottom of the prepared pan and spread out across a bit up the sides.",

Spread the praline filling evenly across the dough. Roll up jellyroll style so that you end with a 12-inch roll. Slice the roll into 12 even pieces. (The easiest way is to cut the dough in half, and those in half again - and then in thirds.) Place the cut rolls into the prepared pan, so that the swirl of filling is visible on top. (They can also be refrigerated at this point until ready to bake.) Allow the rolls to rise and become \"puffy\" before baking. This step is important to achieve a light texture on the finished rolls.",

Remove from oven, allow to cool for 2 minutes, cover with a large platter, and flip pan over so the sticky buns are now sticky side-up. Enjoy! Chef's Note: Use caution when flipping the cooked sticky buns over because the filling and syrup are extremely hot. If the buns don't come out of the pan easily simply place in a warm oven to remelt the glaze and the buns should fall right out."

Then add tomatoes and onions around the top but not over the sour cream. Sour cream can be bought in some grocery chains in squeezable bottles. If you don't have them in your area, and want to try squeezing it out verses dolloping it, either use a pastry bag with a fine tip or take a quart size baggie and add sour cream. Cut a small hole on the bottom edge to create a tip and squeeze out the sour cream. It can make great thin lines all over the entree for presentation and adds good flavor. Enjoy!"

Wrap the dough in plastic and chill in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. To make the filling: Mix the apple slices with the lemon juice, and set aside. Mix the remaining 1/4 cup flour with the sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl. Add half of the flour-sugar mixture to the apples, and stir gently to combine ingredients. Roll the dough out into a large 1/4-inch-thick round. Sprinkle the remaining half of the flour-sugar mixture over all except the outside 2 inches of the dough. Place the apple slices over the flour-sugar mixture in concentric circles, overlapping the slices and leaving about 2 inches of empty crust around the edge of the apples. Using your hands, fold the edge of the crust over the apples, overlapping the folds slightly and pressing the crust together with your hands where the crust overlaps. Place the remaining tablespoon of butter cubes over the top of the uncovered apples.

      "Spread beef strips out on heavy brown paper and sprinkle evenly with salt and pepper. Toss to mix, spread out again, top with onion slices, and let stand 2 hours at room temperature. Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a large, heavy skillet over moderately low heat and blend in flour. Mix in stock and heat, stirring, 3-5 minutes until thickened. Blend in mustard and remove sauce from heat. In a second large skillet, melt remaining butter over moderately high heat, add beef and onions, and brown quickly--this will take about 10 minutes. Add browned beef but not the onion to the sauce, set over moderate heat, cover, and simmer, stirring once or twice, 15 minutes (onion can be saved for hamburgers or stew). Remove from heat, stir in sour cream, and serve. Serve with warm egg noodles. Serves 4.",

If you don't have a large enough pan a large soup pot will work, but the water level fills the pan over three-fourths full, and you will have lots of splatters on your stovetop (to alleviate this problem, cover your entire stovetop, except for the heating element you have your pan sitting on, with aluminum foil). It's imperative that you always keep the water level at least 2 inches above the roast. If you use a soup pot, add more water about every 30 minutes! When I cook the roast I USE A LID to partially cover the pot.",
      "Bring the water to a boil, and cook for about 3 hours until the meat is tender. (I keep the heat a little lower than medium-high, which is a fairly strong boil. Recently I cooked a chuck roast weighing 4.16 pounds and it took 3 hour and 15 minutes, I'm sure the cooking time will vary according to the weight of the meat and how hard the meat boils).",
      "Meanwhile, make the barbecue sauce. BARBECUE SAUCE INSTRUCTIONS: Into a LARGE saucepan thoroughly combine the ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, pepper, chili powder, vinegar, sugar, and onion. Cover and refrigerate for later use. Don't use a medium saucepan because the sauce gets so hot that it can pop out of the pan and can burn your hand.",

I then, place all the little bags within a large freezer bag and place them in the freezer. One 4.16 pound beef chuck roast will give you approximately 15 servings (1/2 cup each)."
