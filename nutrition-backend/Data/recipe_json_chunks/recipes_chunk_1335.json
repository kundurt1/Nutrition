In the last step add your pesto to make the herb sauce. Now clean your fish and pat dry, then toss with oil, salt, pepper, and dry parsley. Now that you have a seasoned fish, heat your saute pan and add some oil, then add your fish. Cook until golden brown and internal temp of 145. if your fish is brown but not done you can finish in the oven. Once the fish is cooked you can plate and top with herb sauce.

      "Wash the rice. This is one of the most crucial steps in creating a delicate pulao, where each grain of rice is separate from the other. Pour the rice into a large bowl and fill with fresh water. Gently wash the rice, running your hand through the rice without breaking the grains. The water will go smoky. Pour off the water and fill the bowl again. Wash, drain, and repeat 3 or 4 times until the water runs clear. By washing the rice in this way, you've just removed the excess starch from the rice so the grains won't stick together.",

As the butter cooks, it will start to foam and rise. Continue stirring, otherwise the butter foam could overflow (about 5 minutes) and catch fire. Once the butter stops foaming and rising, cook until amber in color (about 1 to 2 minutes). It will have a pleasant caramel aroma. Turn off the heat and remove pan from burner. Let the sediment settle to the bottom of the pan for a few minutes. Pour the brown butter through a strainer into a small bowl. . Do not disturb the residue at the bottom of the pan.",

Beat the egg mixture with a fork while slowly incorporating the flour from the sides of the crater into the egg mixture. The more flour you incorporate, the thicker the egg mixture and the wider the well will become. Continue beating until the dough becomes too stiff to mix with a fork.

Alternate between kneading and 'knuckling' the dough until it is smooth, silky and elastic-it pulls back into shape when you stretch it. The process will take 5 to 10 minutes of constant kneading, slightly longer if you prepared the dough by hand. (Mixing the dough in a food processor gives the kneading process a little head start.) Flour the work surface and your hands lightly any time the dough begins to stick while you're kneading.",

Crush the garlic with the side of your chopping knife and add to heated oil (do not mince or dice the garlic; leave as larger pieces). Make sure you avoid browning the garlic by stirring constantly.

Saute until onions are softened and glistening. Add the rice and chicken broth. Stir well and turn heat to simmer. Rice is done when water is absorbed, usually 25 minutes.",

Reserve some sauce for the top layer. And now the crowning ingredient: our shredded mozzarella cheese! Stir in 3 cups of the shredded mozzarella cheese until evenly distributed. Flatten the mixture to a smooth top. Sprinkle the remaining 1 cup of shredded mozzarella cheese as a top layer. Ladle tomato sauce sparingly as your last layer. Bake in oven for 40 minutes.

Crank the pasta through on \"1\", then rotate the thickness dial to \"2\" and repeat until the desired thickness, flouring in between the adjustments to thickness if the dough seems at all sticky. We sometimes go all the way to the \"5\" setting for a delicate pasta (we never go as far as \"6\" the dough gets too thin to cut well), but if you have a hearty sauce, I suggest you stop at 4 to create a thicker pasta. Be sure to keep the dough dry, dusting it with flour between flattening settings. If it isn't pretty dry, it will be more difficult to cut (next step).",

The time required for the pasta to cook will depend upon the thickness of the noodles, but it will be relatively short in comparison to store bought, dried pasta. In my experience, the cooking takes 5-10 minutes but grabbing a noodle from the boiling pot and tasting it is the best way to judge.",

      "5. Butter a shallow 2 1/2- to 3-quart (2.5 to 3l) baking dish. (A wide dish is preferable to a deep one for browning the cheese topping.) Sprinkle half of the Parmesan over the bottom and sides. Spread 1 cup (250ml) of the mornay sauce over the bottom of the baking dish.",
      "6. Line a large dinner plate with a few layers of paper towels. Bring a pot of salted water to a low boil. Either using two soupspoons-one to scoop up some of the dough and the other to scrape it into the boiling water-or a spring-loaded ice cream scoop filled partially full, scoop a round of the dough-about 1 generous tablespoon each-and drop it into the water. (The ice cream scoop was a little newfangled for Paule, although she did agree-reluctantly-that it was more expedient and made nicer gnocchi.) Working in batches, poach 8 to 10 gnocchi at a time. Let them poach for 2 minutes, then retrieve them from the water and drain them on the paper towels. (They won't be fully cooked inside.) Repeat, poaching the rest of the gnocchi the same way.",
      "7. Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F (180\u00b0C) with the oven rack in the top third of the oven.",
      "8. Once the gnocchi are parcooked, place them in a single layer on top of the mornay in the baking dish, and then spoon the rest of the mornay over the gnocchi in a fairly even layer. Sprinkle the remaining 1 1/4 cups (100g) of Swiss-style cheese over the top, along with the remaining Parmesan. Put the baking dish on a foil-covered baking sheet and bake for 15 minutes. Increase the oven temperature to 400\u00b0F (200\u00b0C) and bake for another 15 to 20 minutes, until the cheese on top is well browned. Let cool a few minutes, and then serve in the baking dish, family style."

At this point, the meat should simply flake away with the slightest touch. Remove the roast from the crock pot, and let rest for 45 to 60 minutes. This will allow the meat to cool slightly, which will in turn make it easier to shred. Pull the meat apart using two forks, discarding extra fat and other less-than-palatable bites. Serve hot."

      "Preheat oven to 350F. In a bowl, combine all ingredients except the bacon and course ground pepper. Stir well to incorporate or until sugars are dissolved. Line baking tray with parchment paper enough to overlap edges of baking tray by 1 inch. The extra inch of paper will create an upward lip to contain the liquid within the baking tray. In the area of where the bacon will be laying, brush the paper heavly with half of the syrup mixture. Lay each slice of bacon ontop of the brushed syrup mixture in a single layer barely touching each other. In a thin steady stream, pour the rest of the syrup ontop of the bacon slices and distribute evenly(No need to brush the tops to spread the syrup evenly, it will melt down and coat naturally). Shape edges of paper to create an upward lip to contain liquid from boiling over baking tray. Place tray in oven and cook for 8-10 mins(Cooking times are for regular sliced bacon, times will be shorter for thin-sliced bacon and longer for thick-sliced bacon, so keep an eye on it). Then, flip the bacon slices, baste with syrup liquid quickly and return to oven(the syrup should be bubbling all across the surface of the bacon and baking tray, this is why I consider this recipe a braise). Continue to cook for another 15-20 minutes. Remove from oven and baste one more time with liquid to coat with syrup. Sparsly sprinkle course ground pepper on top side of bacon slices. Transfer to cooling rack, laying bacon slices straight, not touching each other. After 3-4 minutes remove bacon slices, before they fuse to the cooling rack, and transfer to new parchment paper to complete the cooling process. After 15 minutes of cooling(5 mins. if you can't wait!) the syrup glaze will solidify and the slices will be ready to eat. Remove paper from tray carefuly and discard. To store, place individual bacon slices in parchment paper, accordion-style, to avoid them sticking to themselves, wrap in plastic wrap and store in fridge for up to 30 days."
