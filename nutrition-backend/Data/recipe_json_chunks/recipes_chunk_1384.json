      "First, prepare the lemongrass flank steak. While the meat is cooling, prepare the rice powder and the dressing.",
      "In a dry medium sized skillet, add the sticky rice. Over medium-low flame, stir the rice constantly until it is evenly golden brown, about 25-30 minutes. Transfer to a plate and let the rice cool slightly. Then, in a spice grinder, grind until the rice forms a powder that resembles coarse sand. Use immediately or store in an airtight container in a cool dry place for several months.",
      "In a small saucepan, combine the lime juice, fish sauce, sugar, and lemongrass. Over medium heat, stir the dressing until the sugar is dissolved, 15 to 30 seconds. Turn off the heat and stir in the chili peppers. Use immediately or store in an airtight container in the refrigerator until ready to use.",
      "In a large bowl, add the steak slices along with the shallots, rice powder, and about half of the mint and cilantro. Toss to evenly combine and transfer to a plate. To serve, sprinkle with a pinch or two of rice powder and the remaining herbs.",
      "With a mortar and pestle, pound lemongrass, peppercorns, and garlic into a coarse paste. Scrape it into a zip-lock bag with the steak, add the soy sauce and oil, and then massage the marinade into the steak until it's well coated. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes or up to 1 hour.",
      "While the steak is marinating, prepare a charcoal grill. Grill the steak, flipping once, until medium doneness and lightly charred, about 4 minutes per side. Transfer the steak to a cutting board, let it rest for about 10 minutes. Slice against the grain into 1/4 inch thick slices."

      "In a large bowl, combine the flour, salt, sugar, and sage and mix until well-combined. Using a box grater, grate the frozen butter into the flour, then mix gently with your fingers to incorporate it into the flour, just until the butter forms pea-sized clumps. Add the ice-cold water and creme fraiche, then stir with a wooden spoon until the mixture comes together into a dough. Pat into a disk, wrap in plastic wrap, and place in the refrigerator to chill for at least 1 hour.",
      "Preheat oven to 425\u00b0 F. In a medium bowl, whisk together the brown sugar, cinnamon, salt, nutmeg, ginger, and cloves. In a small saucepan, melt the butter until it crackles, turns a deep brown, and smells nutty and fragrant. Set aside.",
      "Using a sturdy, sharp knife, carefully slice the acorn squash in half. Scoop out the insides of the acorn squash and slice into thin, 1/4 to 1/8 inch slices. (I found that a mandoline slicer was very useful for this, though I would use it very carefully.) Toss the slices in the spice mixture, then add the brown butter and toss again until well-coated.",
      "Lay the squash slices in a single layer on a parchment-lined baking sheet and roast in the oven for about 30 minutes, or until squash is tender and caramelized.",
      "While the squash is roasting, make the hazelnut frangipane. Combine the hazelnut meal and the flour in a small bowl, and whisk until well-combined. In a medium bowl, beat the sugar and butter with an electric mixer on medium-high until pale and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Add the egg and beat again. Finally, add the extracts and the hazelnut and flour mixture, then beat on low speed until just combined.",
      "Once the pie dough has had enough time to chill, remove it and separate it into four balls. One ball at a time (keeping the other three chilled), roll the dough out to about a 6-inch circle. I find that rolling the dough is easiest between two lightly-floured pieces of parchment paper, but do whatever you are used to.",
      "In the center of each dough circle, spread 1/4 of the frangipane into about a 5-inch circle. Arrange the roasted and cooled squash slices in an overlapping single layer (or however you like, really) over the frangipane. Fold in the outer edges of the dough over the filling, forming a 1-inch crust all the way around. Return the assembled galettes to the fridge while you work with the remaining ones.",
      "When all four have been assembled, beat an egg with a splash of milk, then brush the crust with the egg wash, sprinkle it with sugar, and bake for 30 to 40 minutes, or until crust is a deep, golden brown.",
      "When ready to serve, use an electric mixer and beat about 1/2 cup creme fraiche on low speed, just until it forms soft peaks (a few minutes was all it took for me). You can add about 1/4 teaspoon of vanilla and 1 to 2 teaspoons powdered sugar just before beating, if you like. Let galettes cool briefly, then serve with whipped creme fraiche on the side."

Or, if you like a bit more caramelization, put them under the broiler, but please don't take your eyes off of them during broiling. The high sugar content of the sauce could leave you with lumps of chicken-charcoal."

      "You will need to continue pushing the outer well wall of flour up against the center to keep it contained, this can get a bit messy but soon the dough will come together.",
      "When about half the flour is mixed in, start kneading the dough with the palms of your hands and continue to incorporate the remaining flour. Once the dough is together and holding its shape, set aside and scrape up the bits of dough and extra flour off your board.",
      "Knead the dough for 8-10 minutes until elastic and a bit sticky. Form into a ball and place in a bowl and cover with plastic; allow to rest for 30 minutes (at room temperature.)",
      "Slice a small section of dough, flatten with your hands a bit and set your machine to the first level of medium thickness and roll dough evenly into a sheet. Set your machine to the next level to create a thinner sheet, be careful to feed the sheet slowly so it rolls cleanly at this thinner stage (check your machine settings to see how the levels work before you begin, mine has numbered levels on a round dial).",
      "Lay the rolled sheets of dough on a clean covered table and allow to dry for a minute or two before rolling into the fettuccine shape. Dust them lightly with flour so they do not stick together.",
      "When all the sheets are rolled and have dried a bit, stack two to four of the long rolled out noodles together and using a very sharp knife cut the pasta into approx. 3/4 inch wide strips. This hand cut style or \"maltagliati pasta\" cut is supposed to be irregular and uneven so do not try to be perfect here! \r\n\r\nNote: Watch this Italian chef's video on hot to make this hand cut pasta: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2mYG-sI-pg",
      "For the roasted salmon and pasta sauce:\r\n\r\nIn a medium stock pot, add the vegetable stock, a few garlic slices and a good pinch of saffron threads and bring to slow boil. for about 15 minutes or so. Taste and adjust seasonings (add a bit of sea salt and pepper), remove from heat and set aside.",
      "Take a large baking sheet place your salmon fillet, skin side down and add some of the sliced leeks, shallots and slices of garlic on top. Season with sea salt and pepper and garnish with 2 to 3 fresh lemon slices. Drizzle lightly with olive oil and place in a preheated 400 degree oven.",
      "Roast for about 12-14 minutes depending on the thickness of your fillet (I check the doneness at the 10 to 12 minute mark; remove or put back into the oven if needed for a few more minutes.)",
      "Remove from oven and let rest, loosely covered in foil to keep warm (Note: you can quickly rewarm the salmon before serving if needed; be careful not to overcook at this point.)",
      "Clean and trim the heads of fennel, remove the stalks and fronds from them and set aside for garnishing. Split one fennel in half and thinly slice about 1/2 to 3/4 of the fennel and place in a large bowl.",
      "In a large skillet, drizzle some olive oil and add a small pat of unsalted butter, allow to melt and add in chopped leeks, shallots and remaining sliced garlic and allow to saute until fragrant.",
      "Once the leeks and garlic have softened a bit, add in the fennel slices from one fennel (reserve the remaining fennel slices for topping the dish) and saute a bit, season with some sea salt and pepper. Once this is softening add in the glass and wine and allow this to deglaze and cook down until most of the liquid has evaporated. Remove from heat and taste for seasonings; set aside.",
      "Place a large deep stock pot to boil and add sea salt to the water. Once the water comes to a boil, add the fresh pasta noodles from earlier and cook quickly until tender and done (this takes just a few moments as fresh pasta cooks very fast.) Reserve some of the pasta cooking water in a bowl and once the pasta is cooked remove from heat and drain well.",
      "Toss the cooked pasta into the skillet with the cooked leeks, shallots and fennel. Place on medium low heat and stir gently. Ladle in some of the seasoned vegetable stock until the pasta is lightly coated (you can also add some of the reserved cooking water to thicken the sauce a bit.)",
      "Saute this gently until most of the stock is absorbed and remove from heat. At this point add in a large spoonful of the plain greek yogurt and mix gently into the cooked pasta (I kept mine pretty light, but you can add more yogurt (by the spoonful) here if you wish.)",
      "Place some of the finished pasta in each plate; using a fork, flake off individual servings of the roasted salmon and place on top of the cooked pasta. Add some of the fresh sliced fennel to the side of the pasta and top with a healthy dollop of greek yogurt and a generous sprinkle of fennel fronds to taste.",
      "Season with more sea salt and pepper if desired and serve immediately.\r\n\r\nNote: I added more of the seasoned stock to my plate as I love a somewhat soupy feel at the bottom of the bowl, so I suggest placing the vegetable stock on the table along with the greek yogurt for you and your guests to customize your own plates before eating."

Let them change their colour to light brown. Now add the meat (marinated with 1/2 tsp turmeric, 1 tsp salt and 1/2 tsp chilli powder for 20 min) and the coriander and cumin powders and saute on a medium flame for 5 min. Add the garam masala powder and saute for 10 more min. Switch off the gas and add the lime juice and mix well. This forms the meat stuffing.",

Now flip the paratha after 1 min, lower the flame and add 3 tbsp of the cooked minced meat stuffing. Spread a little, but don't spread till the circumference. Add two eggs (whisked with 1/4 tsp salt) on this meat and spread till the circumference. Add half each of the marinated onions and chillies and spread over again. Importantly, the ingredients of the stuffing should be quickly added to the paratha one after the other, otherwise the paratha base will become crisp, making it hard for you to give a triangular (or square) shape afterwards.",
      "After 1 min, fold the circular paratha from three directions in order to get a triangular shape (four directions for a square), pressing each fold for 5 sec, so that the fold gets sealed with the (still raw) egg underneath. Increase the flame at this stage to medium for 2 min and then revert back to a low flame. Low flame is important, so that the egg gets cooked to perfection and the paratha is super-crisp! After 7 min, flip the whole paratha very carefully using two spoons, one placed above and the other below. Continue cooking at low flame for 5 min. Now increase the flame to medium for 2 min, pressing the paratha softly from the top. Reduce the flame again and continue to cook for 5 more min, pressing the paratha down with the kitchen spoon. This is can be served with chutney, pickle, yogurt or simple tomato-chilli sauce!"

Cook until the crepe has browned on the bottom (about 1 minute), then flip with a spatula and finish cooking on the other side for about 30 seconds.

Remove from heat and pour over chopped chocolate, whisking until chocolate is completely melted and smooth. Add Kahlua and stir. Let ganache cool completely (you can transfer it to the fridge after it's cooled down some).",

Spoon a heaping tablespoon of ganache into the center and spread with a spoon or spatula, stopping about 1/2 an inch from the edges. Top with 1-2 tablespoons of cream filling and spread the same way. Top the filling with the next crepe, and repeat until you run out of one of the three components (the crepes will likely go first). Top your last crepe with a thick layer of ganache.\r\n2. Place crepe cake in refrigerator until it is firm, then top with a sprinkling of powdered sugar before serving."

Or in some Asian markets you may find matchstick-cut goboh which is all ready to cook (it will be in a transparent sack with liquid in it).",
      "Note BURDOCK 2* I always used to peel the gobo but my chef friend showed me it wasn't necessary. If you are new to goboh or squirmish about the peeling, you can use a potato peeler, If you want really white goboh, trim the peeling down to the inner black circle (like a tree-ring). Also change the water once it turns dark, don't forget more vinegar.",
      "Note 3* MAYONNAISE--If making your favorite recipe, make it a little thinner than usual. If using a bottled mayonnaise, I like to add lemon juice or water to thin. American-style mayonnaise is very thick. Japanese Kewpie Mayonnaise (no thinning necessary) comes in different proportions of oil in the mayonnaise--50 is 50% oil is cut; 75% is cut even more. It is very delicious, try it and you may not go back...Great on BLT and Koreans like to eat on French fries!"

      "To Make the Crust: In a large bowl, combine flour, sugar, and salt. Add butter. Using your fingers or a pastry blender, combine until mixture resembles coarse pea-sized crumbles. Add water, a little at a time, and incorporate into dough just until it holds together. Alternatively, you can do this all in a food processor or stand mixer. The dough should hold together but still be a little flaky.\r\n2. Divide dough into two even sections. Wrap each in plastic and shape into a disc. Refrigerate for at least an hour.",
      "To Make the Filling: \r\n1. Combine rhubarb with 3/4 cup sugar. Let sit while you make the custard.\r\n2. Using a stand mixer, beat together eggs, 1/2 cup sugar, salt, and flour until mixture is creamy and coats the back of a wooden spoon. Pour custard onto rhubarb and mix well.",
      "To Assemble the Pie: \r\n1. Preheat oven to 400F\r\n2. On a lightly floured surface, roll out one of the discs of dough to fit the bottom of a 9 inch pie pan, allowing about 1/2 an inch of dough to hang over the edges. Roll out the second disc to similar size.\r\n3. Insert the bottom crust into the pie pan. Pour in rhubarb custard and spread evenly. Add the top crust, trimming and then pinching around the edges. Cut several slits into the top crust to let steam escape while baking.\r\n4. Bake for 50 minutes, until crust is golden brown. Remove from oven and let cool completely before serving."

      "To make the dough: In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, salt, and instant yeast. Add the water. Using a rubber spatula, mix until the water is absorbed and the ingredients form a sticky dough ball. (If you need to use active dry yeast instead, proof it in the lukewarm water with a pinch of sugar first for about 10 minutes, until foamy, before adding to the other ingredients.)",
      "Cover the bowl with a damp tea towel or plastic wrap and set aside in a warm spot to rise for 1 to 1 1/2 hours, until the dough has doubled in bulk. Note: Here's a trick for making the perfect warm spot for the dough to rise. Set the oven to 400\u00b0 F and let it preheat for 1 minute, then shut it off. The temperature will be between 80\u00b0 F and 100\u00b0 F. you should be able to place your hands (carefully) on the oven grates without burning them.",
      "Set a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat it to 550\u00b0 F. Cover a work surface or cutting board liberally with flour - use at least 1/4 cup and more as needed. The dough is very wet, so don't hesitate to use flour as needed. Using two forks, deflate the dough by releasing it from the sides of the bowl and pulling it toward the center. Rotate the bowl quarter turns as you deflate, turning the mass into a rough ball. Turn the dough out onto your floured surface and use a bench scraper to divide the dough into 6 equal portions. With floured hands, roll each portion into a ball, using the pinkie-edges of your hands to pinch the dough underneath each ball. Let the balls sit on their tucked-in edges for at least 20 minutes without touching.",
      "Pour 1/2 teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil into one or two 8- to 10-inch oven-safe skillet. (If you have two skillets, prepare two-I don't bake more than two pizzas at a time, but if you have two ovens or if your oven is large enough to fit three skillets on one rack, you can prepare three skillets at this step.) Transfer one ball of dough to each prepared skillet, and roll in the oil to coat.",
      "With oiled hands and working from the center out, gently stretch the dough to fit the skillet or into an 8- to 9-inch round. As soon as the dough begins resisting or tearing, stop, let it rest for 5 minutes, then stretch again-small tears are fine and can easily be pinched back together.",
      "Spoon sauce over the dough leaving a 1/2-inch border or so. Top with mozzarella to taste (see photos above for guidance). Sprinkle lightly with sea salt, if using. Place the skillets in the oven, one or two at a time, and bake for 8 to 10 minutes, until the edges are golden. Check the underside with a metal spatula; it should be crisp and golden brown. If the underside of the crust is still pale, continue baking for 3 to 5 minutes (checking often), or place the pan over a burner on medium-high heat for about a minute, keeping an eye on it the entire time and continuing to peek at the underside."

      "Peel the potatoes, cut them into even chunks, and boil them in a large pot of water, until just tender when poked with a fork. You don't want them to be mushy. Drain the potatoes well. Next, make them into mashed potatoes: My favorite way to do so is to press them through a ricer into a large bowl and then fold in the butter, heavy cream, salt, sugar, and baking powder, making sure you get rid of any lumps. If you don't have a ricer, you can also combine the potatoes, butter, cream, salt, sugar, and baking powder in a bowl and use a handheld mixer to whip them up until they're smooth -- but make sure to stop as soon as they are smooth. If you whip them too long, they get gummy.",
      "Place a cloth over the mashed potatoes and refrigerate them at least 7 hours, or overnight.",
      "When ready to cook the lefse, heat a dry, cast iron skillet (at least 8 inches) over medium-high heat. Using your hands, mix the 3/4 cup flour into the cold potatoes, until you have a uniform shaggy dough. Roll the dough into balls about the size of a ping pong ball. On a floured surface, one ball at a time, roll the lefse into rounds that are about 1/8-inch thick or a little thicker. Leave the unrolled lefse in the fridge while you're working so it stays chilled. Griddle the lefse one at a time in the skillet. Cook on the first side until it develops splotches that range from light brown to deep brown (around a minute), then flip and cook the second side until splotchy (about another 30 seconds). Then, transfer the cooked lefse to a cooling rack. Continue in the same way with the remaining lefse balls.",
      "Serve the lefse with scrambled eggs and smoked fish, or cheese and jam, or gjetost, or butter and cinnamon-sugar, or hot dogs, or really any topping that appeals to you. Lefse can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for a few days. Rewarm before serving, or you can seal it tightly in a freezer bag and freeze for up to 1 month."

      "First, prepare the dough for the kouign amann. Set up a stand mixer with a dough hook. Combine the flour, active dry yeast, salt, and warm water in a bowl. Take 1 ounce of the butter and melt it in the microwave, then pour it in the bowl with the rest of the ingredients. Turn the mixer on low speed and let it run for 2 minutes. Then turn the speed to medium and let it run for another 4 minutes until it becomes a gorgeous, uniform dough. Bring it together into a ball and drizzle a little bit of the canola oil into the bowl with it. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and set it aside to rise for an hour.",
      "While the dough rises, make the block of butter. Take the remaining 9 ounces of butter and place it between two sheets of parchment paper. Beat it down into a thinner, single block with a rolling pin, then roll it into a 5 inch square. Put it back into the fridge to stay chilled until the dough is ready. When the dough is done rising, turn it out onto a well floured surface and roll it out into an 8 inch square.",
      "Take the block of butter and put it diagonally onto the middle of the square of dough so that a side of the butter faces a corner of the dough. Bring the corners of dough over the butter to completely envelope it. Roll it out into a 16 x 8 rectangle. Fold it into thirds by bringing one short side up to the middle of the rectangle, then bringing the other short side into the middle over that. That makes one turn. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and chill it for 30 minutes. Repeat this process 2 more times to do 3 turns total. This is what creates all of the flaky layers",
      "After the third turn is done chilling, roll it out into a 16 x 8 rectangle again. Sprinkle the rectangle generously with granulated sugar and fold it into thirds just like before. Roll it out again into a 16 x 12 square and cut that into 12 equal squares by cutting 4 equal cuts along the long side and 3 equal cuts along the short side. Take a 12 well muffin tin and brush each well really generously with more canola oil. Put a square of dough into each well. Bring the corners of the square into the center so that each of the kouign amann look like little four leaf clovers. Sprinkle the tops generously with more granulated sugar.",
      "Put the tin aside to rise for another 30 minutes. When they are done rising, pre-heat the oven to 350. Bake the kouign amann for 35-40 minutes, until they are completely flaky and golden. Let them cool for a couple of minutes in the tin, then remove them to a wire rack to finish cooling. Serve them immediately with great coffee or tea! They also keep well for a day and leftovers can be toasted."

(Fold gently, don't whip the dough or over-stir.) Add more of the buttermilk mixture as needed, in small amounts, to create a dough that is neither too wet or too dry. You may need more or less than the 1-1/2 cups buttermilk called for. If you need more liquid, plain buttermilk is fine. The dough should look lumpy and be more wet than dry.",

Cut dough in half and form nice balls and wrap in plastic and put in refrigerator for at least an hour to rest dough and become very firm",
      "Heat oven to 425 and put a pizza stone in oven to thoroughly heat. I am not using a stainless steal plate instead of stone. \r\nAfter dough has rested for at least an hour roll it out in a large oval onto a piece of parchment paper and place back in fridge while you prepare the tomatoes - 10-15 minutes. Just keep dough as cold as possible and don't leave sitting on the counter too long or it won't be manageable for you. With 1 tablespoon of the xvoo smear it over the rolled out dough. Sprinkle about 1/3 of the cheese over the oil then arrange the tomato decoratively in a circle fashion leaving about 2-3 inches for the edges. Sprinkle the remaining cheese, little more salt and the ground pepper, sprinkle the fresh herbs and finish with last tablespoon of oil.\r\nPull up the sides of the dough to create a nice rolled edge so that while cooking tomato juices wont' flow out. Add a little water to an egg yolk and brush the edge of the pie then sprinkle with a little more sea salt. Cook pie on the parchment for 20 minutes or so until crust is nicely brown and tomatoes have a nice cheesy crust."

Quarter the tomatoes, remove their seeds, then dice the rest of the flesh and set aside.",

In a deep skillet (non-stick or enamel work well here) large enough to hold all the vegetables, heat some olive oil over low-medium heat in a deep skillet and begin cooking the diced potatoes. Cover and cook for about 5 to 7 minutes, stirring occasionally and checking to make sure they are not browning or getting stuck-they should remain relatively pale.",
      "Add the onion along with a good pinch of salt, stir, and then let cook, covered, a minute or two more before adding the eggplant. Stir, and cover again, cooking an additional 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Then add the peppers and the zucchini, cover and let cook 5 more minutes, stirring occasionally.",

If you need to at any point (if you notice the vegetables sticking, for example), you can add a splash of water, but in general you should not need to do this. Before serving, add torn basil and season with salt and pepper."

Think of the can lid as a clock face; you want to open from about 7 o'clock to about 5 o'clock cutting in a clockwise direction. Use a pliers to bend the lid open. Empty and rinse the can. Use a keyhole opener to open a hole in the lid at the 6 o'clock position.",
      "Fill the can about a quarter to a third full with your wood chips/pellets. \r\nWiggle the tip of the soldering iron through the keyhole, as far in as you can get it.\r\nPut the can on the grate of your grill on it's side with the keyhole toward the bottom; again like the 6 o'clock position of an ordinary wall clock. Make sure the tip of the soldering iron is well-covered by the chips.\r\nYou are now ready for cold smoking!!",
      "Cut each of the ribs in half lengthwise. This exposes more of the meat and fat to the smoke to help develop a well-balanced smoky flavor. Rest the pork on a grate in your grill, making sure it doesn't touch the smoker apparatus. I use the warming rack provided inside my grill, but you can use what ever will work for your particular grill.",
      "Plug the soldering iron in. It will take a bit to warm up, but you should start to see smoke in 5 to 10 minutes. If not, wiggle the soldering iron around a bit; it may not be in good contact with the chips.",
      "Once you start to see smoke, put the lid down on your grill and set your timer for 30 minutes. Try not to open the lid during this time - you should see and smell smoke coming from the grill. After 30 minutes your meat should have developed a good amount of smoke aroma. Remove the meat from the grill. Unplug your soldering iron, but wait until the chips burn out and the can cools down before handling it.",
      "Cut the pork into 3/4- to 1-inch cubes. Massage the garlic, 1 teaspoon kosher salt, 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg, and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper into the meat. Allow the meat to rest at room temperature for 45 to 60 minutes or refrigerate overnight.",
      "Combine the lard and 1 cup of water in a 2 to 3 quart saucepan. Melt the lard over medium-low heat. Once it has mostly melted add the pork, bay leaf, and 1 tablespoon whiskey. If needed add more water so pork is just covered. Bring to a simmer over medium heat, then reduce heat to maintain a gentle simmer.",
      "Continue to simmer, skimming off foam and stirring occasionally, for 2 hours adding more water if needed. The water should not boil off before the meat is tender and the fat has rendered. After 2 hours check to see how tender the pork is. If it is easily shredded add the shallots, if not check again in 15 minutes.",
      "The rillettes are done when the pork is easily shredded and the fat has become \"clear and beautiful.\" This will take about 2 1/2 to 3 hours. Once the water has cooked off, continue to cook the meat in the fat for 5 to 10 minutes, stirring frequently. The meat should not become crispy.",
      "Strain the meat in a fine mesh strainer, collecting the fat in a bowl or large glass measure. Allow the meat to rest in the strainer for 5 to 10 minutes, then transfer to a medium sized bowl. Use 2 forks to shred the pork.",
      "Add the remaining whiskey, kosher salt, 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg, and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper. Add 1/4 cup of the reserved fat back into the meat. Mix vigorously to thoroughly combine and further break down the meat.",
      "Stir in additional fat 1 tablespoon at a time until your mixture is like stiff cookie dough in texture. Taste and add more nutmeg or black pepper if desired. In my experience the rillettes will taste saltier now than they will taste after a night in the fridge.",
      "Pack the rillettes into jars or ramekins. Seal the top with 1/4-inch layer of the reserved fat - this will help to preserve the rillettes, so they will keep for several weeks in the refrigerator. Refrigerate the rillettes overnight or longer. Allow to come to room temperature before serving. Enjoy!",
      "Now, go smoke some cheese!!",
      "5-spice variation: Add several broken up star anise pods to the chips when smoking. Eliminate the bay leaf. Use chinese 5-spice in place of the nutmeg and black pepper. Use kirsch or brandy in place of the whiskey."

Peel the eggs and store them in the refrigerator.",

Season with salt and black pepper. Taste the sauce, and adjust the flavor as necessary (it should taste sweet and savory from the caramelized onions, and slightly acidic from the lemon zest). Set the sauce aside. Both the eggs and the onion sauce can be made a day or so ahead of time (the eggs, a few days ahead) and stored in the refrigerator until you are ready to make the crostini.",

Add enough olive oil to barely cover the surface of the skillet. When the oil is hot, add the Swiss chard. Cook, stirring regularly, until the chard is soft and wilted. Remove from the heat and season with salt, pepper, and the lemon juice. Set the chard aside. Drizzle the bread with olive oil, set the slices on a baking sheet, and cook them in the oven for approximately 4 minutes, until they are beginning to look brown and toasted.",
      "Set the oven to broil. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil, and place the slices of bread on the baking sheet. Assemble the crostini by adding a layer of Swiss chard to each piece of bread. Slice the eggs (from top to bottom, so every piece has a bit of white and yolk), and place the egg slices on top of the Swiss chard in a single layer. Drizzle 1 1/2 tablespoons of the caramelized onion sauce over the top of each crostini (you will have extra sauce left over-store it in your refrigerator and use it with pasta for a nice snack on another day). Top each piece of bread with a handful of grated Gruyere. Broil the crostini until the cheese begins to bubble and turn brown. Keep a close eye on the crostini, as they will cook quickly. When they look beautiful, remove them from the oven, serve, and enjoy."

      "The next day: pull your batter out of the fridge and make sure it's the desired consistency. It likely will have thickened a bit during fermentation; simply add a tablespoon of water at a time and whisk or blend until it's easily pourable. I ended up adding 5 tablespoons. Allow the batter to rest as you work on the compote.",

      "Heat a non-stick skillet over medium-low heat and melt a dab of butter. Once hot, pour in batter about 1/3 cup at a time, and swirl the pan around to get a thinner coating of batter; these are crepes, not pancakes! You want a very pale bottom and a just-cooked, sponge-y top. Once the surface is dry, transfer to a plate and cook off the rest.",
      "Spread a layer of yogurt on top of the crepe and spoon compote on top. Drizzle with honey or add crushed walnuts if you desire, and serve."

      "For the filling: If using pre-cooked and peeled chestnuts, skip to next step. If using fresh chestnuts in their shells, you need to first rinse and boil them. Cut a slash across the shells on one side (if you happen to cook chestnuts often, there is also a tool that you can buy to help you do this! See headnote). Then place in a pot full of cold water to cover by a couple of inches. Bring to boil and cook about 30 minutes or until tender: Try opening one and inserting a knife into it, it should give way like a cooked potato. Drain and let cool a little before peeling.",
      "Mash or crush the cooked chestnuts. Combine in a bowl with the ricotta, Parmesan, egg, nutmeg, 1/2 teaspoon of fennel seeds, and a pinch of salt.",
      "To make the pasta dough: Put the flour on a clean flat surface (or in a bowl) and make a well in the center. Crack the egg in the well, add the yolks. With a fork, begin to whisk the eggs, incorporating the flour little by little until you can no longer whisk with the fork. Use floured hands to combine the rest of the flour. Knead for a few minutes or until smooth. Wrap in plastic and let it rest at least 30 minutes at room temperature.",
      "To make the pasta, cut the dough into 4 even pieces. Take one piece of dough (keep the rest of the dough covered with a tea towel or plastic wrap so it doesn't dry out) and roll it out using a pasta machine, working down to the most narrow setting. The dough should be thin enough so that you can begin to see your hand through it, but not too thin that it can't support the ricotta filling.",
      "Working on a lightly-floured surface with strips of pasta about 4 inches (10 centimeters) wide and as long as you like, place the filling (use 1 level teaspoon) onto the pasta sheet slightly off centre and no more than 1 inch (2 1/2 centimeters) apart. Beat the reserved egg white and brush it around the filling. Fold the pasta in half widthwise (making it skinnier) to meet the edge of the pasta sheet, and press down gently around each spoonful of filling, working from one side to the other, pushing the air out as you work your way around the filling. Be careful not to trap too much air, as the ravioli can burst when cooking.",
      "With a fluted pastry wheel cutter or a sharp knife, trim the length of the whole sheet of pasta on the open side (not the folded side), then separate each ravioli by trimming evenly so that you have about a 1/3-inch border around the filling. (You can save the trimmed pieces, knead them together, and continue using them; cover when not in use to avoid drying.) Continue until you finish the pasta and filling-or whichever comes first.",
      "Place the finished ravioli on a baking sheet or flat surface lined with parchment paper, and keep them covered with a tea towel while make the others. They will dry out somewhat the longer you leave them, and this is perfectly fine, but if you are leaving them for a significant amount of time, keep them in the fridge. Once you've made all the ravioli, cook in a saucepan of salted, boiling water over a medium heat until al dente, about 5 minutes.",
      "Meanwhile, prepare a sauce by toasting the remaining 1 teaspoon fennel seeds in a wide skillet for 1 minute. Then add the butter and allow it to melt entirely, infusing with the fennel seeds. Add about 1/4 cup of the pasta cooking water and swirl the pan or whisk the liquid until the sauce becomes well-combined, essentially emulsified, and thick.",
      "When the ravioli are ready, drain (reserving some water if needed) and add to the sauce. If too dry, you can add a little more of the pasta cooking water. Toss gently to coat and then serve immediately with grated Parmesan cheese."

      "The following morning (or 8 to 10 hours later), remove the bowl from the fridge. Line a rimmed sheet pan with parchment paper or coat with nonstick cooking spray. Pour 3 tablespoons oil on the sheet pan. Using two forks, deflate the dough by releasing it from the sides of the bowl and pulling it toward the center. Rotate the bowl in quarter turns as you deflate, turning the mass into a rough ball. Use the forks to lift the dough onto the prepared sheet pan. Roll the dough ball in the oil to coat it all over. Let it rest without touching it for 1 hour.",
      "Set a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat it to 425\u00b0F. With lightly greased hands, press down on the dough, using all 10 fingers to dimple and stretch the dough outward. Pull gently on the ends and stretch them toward the corners of the sheet pan. When the dough begins to resist being stretched, let it rest for 5 minutes, then stretch it again, continuing until it fits most of the sheet pan.",

Let stand another 20 minutes, then transfer the sheet pan to the oven and bake for 20 to 25 minutes, until the underside is golden and crisp. Remove the pan from the oven, and transfer the focaccia to a cooling rack. Let it cool for at least an hour before cutting.",
      "To cut the focaccia for the slab sandwich, trim off the very outer edges-this exposes the crumb, which makes it easier to halve. I like to start the halving process by cutting through each corner, then running the serrated knife through the short end until I get to the midway point, then starting from the other short end until I get to the midway point. A sharp, serrated knife is helpful. Try to keep your knife as parallel to the bread as possible, and I find if I hug the top layer as opposed to aiming for the center, I get a more even cut.",
      "Preheat the oven to 425\u00b0F. Lay the bacon on a sheet pan. If you are using 1.5 pounds bacon, you will have to overlap pieces and lay pieces on top of one another to start, but don't worry, they will shrink. Cook 10 minutes, remove pan from oven, and, using forks, spread out/separate the slices of bacon. (This is unnecessary if you are using 1 pound of bacon only.) Return pan to the oven, cook for 10 more minutes, remove pan from the oven, and separate the slices again if necessary. Return pan to the oven and cook for 5 more minutes or until the slices are looking crispy. Remove pan from the oven and transfer crisp slices to a paper-towel lined plate. If necessary, drain off some of the fat, and return the pan to the oven one last time to crisp up the remaining pieces. Transfer bacon to plate.",
      "Turn oven off to let it cool down faster. You can leave the door open, too, to expedite the cooling. You need it to be at 300\u00b0F. Grease a half sheet pan (I use a cheap, nonstick Baker's Secret sheet pan purchased from a grocery store-it measures 11x16.5 inches) very well with butter. Crack all 12 eggs in a big bowl, add salt and pepper and the splash of cream, then whisk until well combined. Add the chives, and gently fold until mixed. Pour the mixture into the prepared pan. Sprinkle with cheese evenly. Bake until the eggs are just set, about 15 minutes.",
      "Transfer the bottom half of the focaccia slab onto a cutting board. When the eggs have cooked, use an offset spatula to loosen them from the pan, then transfer to the bread. Trim off any excess, overhanging eggs (and save! see notes above). Lay the bacon on top. Scatter the lettuce on top. Top with the top half of bread. Cut the sandwich into 12 pieces (2 cuts through the short end; 3 cuts through the long end). Serve with hot sauce, mayonnaise and any other condiments you like."

      "For the meatballs:\r\nIn a large bowl, combine the ground meat, the eggs, the bread, the grated cheese, the parsley and the garlic. Gently mix (do not overwork) until all ingredients are thoroughly incorporated into the meat. Season with salt and black pepper. Because there is raw egg, you may not want to do as my grandma did and taste the raw mixture for seasonings (eww, Grandma!). So you can take a pinch of the mix, flatten into a small patty, and sautee in some olive oil in a fry pan. Taste and adjust as necessary. \r\nWhen you are happy with the seasoning mixture, gently roll into balls (should be bigger than a golf ball, but smaller than a tennis ball). You can either fry them in about 1/8 inch of light olive oil in a large fry pan, turning until browned on all sides (authentic but messy and difficult), or you can put them into a roasting pan in a single layer and bake at 425 F until brown (30-45 minutes). The oven method is a lot easier and less messy, but you can't put them into the sauce too early or you risk overcooking them. Your choice.",
      "For the gravy:\r\nIn a large, heavy-bottomed pot, heat the light olive oil over medium high until shimmering (do not use extra virgin for this, as it is too delicate). Brown the neck bones in the oil until brown and crispy on all sides, then remove and set aside. Do not clean out the pot! Reduce the heat to medium and add the garlic and crushed red pepper flakes, stirring constantly to avoid burning. Cook for 30 seconds to a minute, until golden and fragrant. Be careful not to burn the garlic. Add the tomato paste and cook, continuing to stir constantly, for another minute or so, until the paste darkens and becomes fragrant. Add the cans of tomatoes and sauce, crushing the tomatoes with your hands as you add them to the pot. Take one of the empty 28-oz tomato cans and fill 3/4 of the way with water. Swish it around to get some of the sauce off the sides of the can and add it to the pot. Give everything a good stir, and then bring it to a boil. Reduce the heat to low, and simmer uncovered for about an hour. Season with salt and pepper, and perhaps a scant teaspoon of sugar if you detect any bitterness from the tomatoes. At this point, add the browned meatballs and neck bones back in along with the basil leaves, stir, and simmer for another hour.",
      "While the gravy is simmering for the last 20 minutes or so, set a large pot of water on high heat to boil. Once boiling, add a large pinch of salt, then add the macaroni. Give them a stir to avoid sticking, and cook 8-12 minutes or until desired doneness. Save a ladle or two of the pasta water in a bowl and set aside, then drain the macaroni and return to the pot. Drizzle with olive oil and stir. Add 2-3 ladles of tomato gravy to the macaroni, stir, and add a little pasta water to thin the gravy to the desired consistency.",
      "When the gravy is done, get a pie plate or casserole dish and remove the neck bones and meatballs. Add a ladle of gravy to the dish. Serve the macaroni in a big bowl with the dish of meat on the side for everyone to grab. Have extra grated cheese and gravy boats filled with extra tomato gravy on hand at the table, too. Best served with a nice bottle of wine. Mangia!"

Set the sections on a dish or tray and refrigerate them for at least 45 minutes-or until needed. If the fruit was refrigerated to begin with, just put the tray of segments back in the fridge (to keep them cold) for the short time it takes to melt the chocolate.",

Set the bowl directly in (not over) a wide skillet of barely simmering water. Stir with a dry spatula from time to time until the chocolate is melted and smooth quite warm to the touch but not hot- about 120F is good. Remove the chocolate from the water bath and- if the chocolate is warmer than 120-let it cool a bit)",
      "While the chocolate is melting, line a tray with parchment and find room for it in the fridge.",

Slip the fork under the segment (without stabbing, piercing, or impaling it) and lift it out of the chocolate. (You may find it helpful to tilt the bowl of chocolate to help you get the fork under the segments.) Tap the fork on the rim of the bowl several times letting excess chocolate flow back into the bowl, and then wipe the bottom of the fork against the rim to remove more excess chocolate, all of which will otherwise puddle under the segment (puddles are tasty but not particularly pretty!)",
      "Set the end of the fork on the parchment-lined tray and use the tip of your index finger to push the segment from the fork onto the parchment. Continue to dip and deposit segments onto the tray, working quickly.",
      "You can decorate each segment immediately by touching the bottom of the fork tines to the surface of the chocolate coating. Or, dip several segments first and then drizzle fine strings of chocolate filigree over them as follows: hold the bowl of chocolate over the dipped segments, dip the fork deep into the chocolate and let chocolate drip off of the tines over the segments.",
      "Stir the chocolate from time to time as you work. Dipped segments look best if the chocolate is somewhere between 105 and 120F. Since cold fruit cools the chocolate, you may want to reheat it by setting the bowl back into the hot water bath for a few seconds. Stir well after reheating. Leftover chocolate can be used again. Scrape it onto a piece of parchment or foil and let it cool. Wrap it for use another time.",
      "Refrigerate the dipped segments as soon as possible. Store in the fridge. Serve right from the fridge or take them out about 10 minutes early so that the chocolate coating will still be crispy but not quite so cold. These are best on the day you dip them but still good for 2 or 3 more days."

Be sure to shake off excess flour before adding them to the oil and don't overcrowd the pan. The squid will cook very quickly: 2 minutes or so. When it is golden, use a spider to scoop out the squid, shake off excess oil, and put it in the oven on the rack to stay warm (using the rack helps ensure the squid won't get soggy). Repeat until everything is fried. Serve immediately with the garlic lemon yogurt sauce (or sauce of your choice... or no sauce) and lemon wedges."

Sprinkle the black pepper over it, add the Parmesan and parsley, and stir everything together until a dough comes together.",

If the dough is too sticky, add a bit more flour, but try to add as little as possible. The dough should be slightly sticky, which helps make the gnocchi extra fluffy.\r\n\r\nPlace the ball of dough into a bowl (you can use the same one you mixed it in) and let it sit in the fridge for at least 45 minutes to an hour. Note: Dough can be made the day before and allowed to sit in fridge overnight.",

On a lightly floured cuttable surface, roll each portion into a long \"rope\". I usually cut the rope in half and continue to roll each half further until about 1/2 an inch thick. So 4 portions, should render 8 equal length and width ropes. Use a cutter or pastry scraper to cut each rope (just line them up and cut together) into about 1 inch long pieces. Move the gnocchi to the prepared tray and place in fridge while you make the sauce.",
      "Set a large pot of salted water on high heat and bring to a boil, and remove the filets so they can come to room temperature. Preheat oven to 350\u00b0 F.\r\nPlace a small saucepan over medium heat and add the butter. Cook the butter until it turns a golden brown and oozes a nutty aroma. It will bubble vigorously at first and then settle and become one of the greatest things on earth: brown butter! While it cooks, use a spoon to skim white foam off the top and edges. You don't have to get all of it, but as much as you can. Once the butter is slightly brown (about 4 minutes after it melts) add the sage leaves and cook another 2 minutes. Lower heat if necessary to not burn the butter. Remove from heat and set aside.",

In a large skillet, heat the olive oil on medium heat with the crushed garlic cloves. Remove garlic when after it turns golden and discard. Add the mushrooms and cook on medium-high heat to crisp slightly, stirring often. Lower heat after 3 minutes to low.",
      "Meanwhile, add the gnocchi to the boiling water in 2 batches, so as not to overcrowd. Cook a few minutes, until all the gnocchi have floated up to the surface.",
      "Add the brown butter and sage to the mushrooms and stir to combine. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the cooked gnocchi directly to the sauce. Stir gnocchi with the butter and mushrooms very gently until coated with sauce. Taste and season with salt (Maldon or another flakey sea salt if possible) and freshly ground black pepper to taste.",
      "Heat another skillet (preferably cast iron) over medium-high heat with 2 tablespoons of oil and two crushed garlic cloves. Remove and discard garlic once golden. Sprinkle the filets generously with kosher salt (1 to 2 teaspoons per steak) and coarsely ground black pepper. The pepper should cover the steaks completely, sides as well. Sear the steaks about 2 minutes per side, until a golden crust forms. The steaks should sizzle! Finish the filets in the oven until desired doneness. Personally, I like medium-rare, so I cook them until the center registers 140\u00b0 F. Let them sit for 5 minutes before serving.\r\nPlace each steak on a plate, spoon on the gnocchi, and sprinkle with some freshly grated Parmesan cheese."

(Alternatively, you can allow your biga to ferment at room temperature for up to 24 hours.) Reserve 1 1/2 cups biga for the following bread recipe. The remaining biga can be stored in your fridge, covered. You can keep it alive by discarding some of the biga every 2-3 days, and feeding the remaining portion with a little water and bread flour (about equal amounts) and giving it a vigorous stir.",
      "In a large mixing bowl, mix together the biga and the pumpkin on low speed. In a small bowl, whisk together the warm water and the yeast. Add the yeast mixture to the pumpkin mixture, and then the sorghum molasses. Mix until thoroughly combined. The consistency will be quite runny.",
      "In a large bowl, combine the 00 flour and the bread flour. Add about 3 1/2 cups of flour, to the bowl, continuing to mix with the dough hook on medium-low speed. Slowly, add the remaining flour bit by bit, until the dough comes off the sides and bottom of the mixing bowl, and climbs up the hook. (You might not need all this flour-just continue to add until the dough is no longer sticky to the touch, and comes completely clean from the sides and bottom of the bowl.) This process will take about five minutes. Stop the mixer and scrape down the dough from the hook periodically.",
      "The dough at this point should be quite stiff. Continue letting it knead for another three minutes, stopping the mixer and scraping the dough off the hook periodically.",
      "With the mixer still kneading, add the salt and the chopped rosemary. When the salt and rosemary look evenly incorporated, scrape the dough off the hook one last time, and allow the dough to rest in the bowl for 20 minutes. Meanwhile, pour 2 tbsp of olive oil into a large bowl. When the dough has rested for 20 minutes, turn the dough out into the bowl, and flip the dough over so it is well-oiled on all surfaces. Cover the bowl with a towel and allow the dough to rest for an hour.",
      "After 1 hour, cut the dough in half. (You should be able to see tiny bubbles just starting to form.) Working with half the dough, stretch it lightly with your fingers-you can hold it up on one side in the air and just let gravity stretch the dough for you. Fold the dough in half. Flatten and shape the dough into a rough rectangular shape, then roll it up like a cinnamon roll. Tuck the ends of the dough neatly underneath and use your fingers to pinch the seam close. Your dough should now resemble a fat baguette.",
      "Generously flour a baking sheet with 1/3 cup of flour. Transfer the log of dough on top of the flour, then sprinkle some of the flour over the entire surface of the dough. (Repeat the stretch, fold, and roll with the 2nd half of the dough, and transfer it to the baking sheet. Sprinkle with flour on all sides.)",
      "Space the loaves so they have room to rise. Cover with a towel, and allow the dough to rise for 2-3 hours. At this point, the dough should be nicely puffed but not quite doubled in size. Spritz the tops lightly with water.",

(If using baking stone, let it warm up in the oven.)\r\n\r\nBake the bread directly on the baking sheet for about 50 minutes, (Or if using, transfer the dough to a baking stone.) After 50 minutes, the crust should be browned and crisp. When you pick up the loaf, give it a light thump on the bottom. It should should hollow.",

      "Toss butternut squash with 2 tablespoons olive oil and spread on a baking sheet. Roast for about 20 minutes, stirring once about halfway through. It should be soft when pierced with a fork when it is done.",
      "While squash is cooking, heat remaining one tablespoon of oil in a medium saucepan over medium high heat. Saute the shallot and garlic for about 1 minute. Add rice and saute for about a minute, until the grains start to turn translucent. Reduce heat to low.",
      "Add stock (which is preferably being kept warm in another pan on the stove), a half cup at a time. Stir until the stock is absorbed and then add another half cup until all the stock has been used and the risotto is soft and creamy. This should take about 20 minutes.",
      "When the squash is done, add it to the saucepan and stir until the squash has mostly broken down and is well-incorporated into the risotto. You may need to add a bit more stock to make this happen. Add salt and pepper.",
      "Note: I don't mind seeing some orange chunks in my arancini, but if you prefer a smoother consistency, you may want to mash the squash with a potato masher before adding it to the risotto.",
      "Remove the risotto from the heat once the mixture has become quite stiff. Refrigerate the risotto for at least an hour or until it's cool enough to handle. You could also prepare up to this point a day before completing the recipe.",
      "While the risotto is cooling, Heat the honey very slowly in a small saucepan. Once it's warm and liquid (about 100 degrees or so) remove it from the heat and add the sage leaves. You might want to muddle the leaves a little to help with the flavor extraction, but you'll be fishing these sage leaves out later so don't mash them up too much. Set the honey mixture aside.",
      "When you're ready to make your arancini get everything set up first. Have a bowl for each: crumbled goat cheese, flour, 2 eggs beaten, panko.",
      "Mix 1 lightly beaten egg into the risotto. Use a tablespoon and get a big scoop of risotto. Nestle about a teaspoon of goat cheese in the middle. Then roll the ball in flour, then dip in egg and finally roll in panko. Set aside on a tray. Repeat for the rest of the risotto.",
      "On the stove in a deep sided skillet, heat 1-inch of canola oil on medium low to about 350 degrees. Once the oil is hot enough, work in batches, dropping the risotto balls one by one into the oil, turning about every minute or so for even browning. They should be completely done in about 3-4 minutes. Remove and drain on a paper towels. Repeat for all the remaining arancini.",
      "When they're all done, remove the sage leaves from the honey and whisk in the lemon juice (you may need to re-heat your honey at this point to make it more liquid).",
      "Arrange your arancini on a plate and drizzle the honey over them. If you prefer, you can serve the honey as a dipping sauce on the side. Serve immediately."

      "The evening before, heat a skillet over medium heat. Toast the barley in the dry skillet, stirring, for a few minutes until it starts to give off a toasted fragrance. Transfer to a bowl and add cold water to cover and let the barley soak. The next day, remove any loose hulls that have floated to the top and drain of the water. Add 2 cups fresh water and a generous pinch of salt, bring the barley to a simmer, and cook, covered, for about 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. Check the barley for doneness. It will probably still need another 5 to 10 minutes to cook, but if it is still quite watery, you can remove the lid at this point and finish cooking while letting more of the liquid evaporate. When the barley is tender but still has a firm bite, turn it off. You will have more that you need for the recipe, so save some for salads or as a side dish or freeze for another batch of salmon cakes. Measure out one cup of cooked barley for this recipe and transfer to a large bowl and allow it to cool.",

      "Clean and slice the mushrooms. In the same pan that you cooked the shallots, melt another Tbsp of butter and now saute the mushrooms over medium heat, with a pinch of salt and plenty of freshly ground black pepper. Let the mushrooms release their own juices and keep cooking them until the liquid cooks down. Now add the white vermouth and cook the mushrooms until this has cooked down. Turn off the mushrooms and let them cool. When the mushrooms have cooled, put them in a food processor with the creme fraiche and pulse a few times to create a textured paste. Reserve the mushroom cream for serving.",
      "Now your barley should be cooled down enough to mix in an egg. Then mix in the grated gruyere cheese, oregano leaves, salt and freshly ground pepper. Break the salmon into flakes with a fork and gently mix this into the batter, along with the juices. Now use your hands to gently mix in about 1/2 cup panko, or more if the batter feels to moist. Form the batter into 12 two patties, about two inches wide. Roll these in more panko and place them on a parchment paper or silpat covered cookie sheet and chill them in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes.",
      "Heat a skillet over medium high heat. Add about 4 Tbsp of olive oil to generously cover the bottom of the pan. When the oil is shimmering, place half of the cakes into the pan. Now leave them along for a good 5-8 minutes until they are nicely browned (don't be tempted to flip them too soon). Flip and cook until the second side is nicely browned as well.",
      "While the salmon bakes are cooking, toss the salad greens with lemon juice and a small pinch of salt, and arrange on plates. When the salmon cakes are done cooking, place on the bed of greens and top each cake with a large dollop of the mushroom cream. Enjoy."

This can be done with your hands or, alternatively, if you have a small circle cookie cutter or the sort used for fondant roses, you can use that.

      "Repeat this process with the other larger circles, overlapping each over the prior petal, and letting the edges flare out progressively more and more.",

Come back to it when the chocolate is cool again and you're re-energized.",

    "title": "crunchy spring rolls (zha chun juan)",
    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "Start this the day before you wrap the spring rolls by first placing the dried mushrooms in a work bowl and covering them with cool water. Allow them to plump up overnight in the refrigerator, which will give them the best texture. The next day, drain and reserve the soaking liquid for something else (I like to add them to the accompanying recipe for Roast Duck Soup with Radishes), cut off and discard the stems, and then slice the caps into thin shreds. Prepare the meat at the same time you soak the mushrooms by cutting it against the grain into thin slices, and then crosswise into a fine julienne. Transfer the meat to a plastic container and toss it with the ginger, 1 tablespoon oyster sauce, toasted sesame oil, rice wine, 1 teaspoon cornstarch, and as much ground black pepper as you like. Cover the container and refrigerate for at least a couple of hours and preferably overnight so that the meat can become thoroughly marinated.",
      "To make the filling, set a wok over high heat, and when the iron is hot, swirl in about 1/4 cup of oil. Sprinkle the marinated meat and marinade into the wok, breaking it up so that you don't have large clumps. Allow the meat to sear on one side before shaking the wok and tossing the meat around. When the meat no longer shows any pink, transfer it to a medium heatproof work bowl. Drain all of the oil from the meat back into the wok and return it to the stove over high heat.",
      "When the wok is hot once again, sprinkle in the julienned mushroom caps and carrot. Toss them quickly until the carrots have lost a bit of their rawness but are still crisp, and then add them to the meat in the work bowl. Wipe out the wok with a paper towel and return it to the high heat. When it is very hot, add the bean sprouts to the dry wok and quickly toss them until they are crisp but no longer raw-frying them this way without any oil will give them a fresher taste. Add them to the work bowl along with the remaining 3 tablespoons oyster sauce and the almonds, toss these around lightly to mix, and then taste and adjust the seasoning as needed. Let the filling cool down to room temperature. (If you want to prepare this a day or two ahead of time, stir-fry the bean sprouts just before you wrap the spring rolls.)",
      "An hour or so before serving, make a dip by mixing the Worcestershire sauce and the balsamic with the garlic, as this will give the flavors a chance to mellow out a bit. Taste and adjust the seasoning as desired. Before you wrap the spring rolls, mix the 1 teaspoon cornstarch with just a bit of water to form a creamy paste.",
      "Before you open up the bag of spring roll wrappers, let it sit on the counter for about 20 minutes to defrost slightly. Remove 12 wrappers, freeze the rest, and immediately cover these 12 sheets with either a sheet of plastic or a damp tea towel to prevent the exquisitely thin wrappers from drying out and cracking. Divide the filling into 12 equal portions (about 5 to 6 tablespoons each). Have a baking sheet lined with plastic wrap ready, as well as an extra sheet of plastic to cover the filled spring rolls.",
      "Working on one spring roll at a time, set one wrapper in front of you on a clean work surface so that one of the corners is pointing at you. Arrange a portion of the filling (about 5 to 6 tablespoons) in a 4-inch long cigar shape close to the corner nearest you. Fold that corner over the filling. Then, bend both the left and right corners over the filling to form a package about 4 inches wide before rolling it up toward the top corner. You should end up with a tight cylinder. Dab a bit of the cornstarch paste on the top corner and use this to seal the spring roll. Set the filled spring roll on the lined baking sheet with the seal on the bottom and cover it with the extra sheet of plastic. Repeat this step with the rest of the wrappers and filling until you have 12 spring rolls. These may be frozen at this point and stored in a freezer bag.",
      "Set a paper towel-covered plate covered next to the stove. Pour the remaining oil in a clean wok and set it over high heat. When the surface starts to shimmer, test the heat by inserting a wooden chopstick in the center: It should immediately be covered with bubbles, but not so hot that the oil is smoking, about 325 to 350\u00b0 F (165 to 175\u00b0 C). Carefully slide 4 or more of the spring into the hot oil, but don't crowd the pan. Quickly fry the spring rolls and turn them over until they are golden brown, and then let them drain off any excess oil onto the paper towels. Repeat with the rest of the spring rolls until all are fried. These can be cut in half with kitchen shears on an angle, if you wish, or served whole. Serve piping hot and offer the dip on the side."

If it is tougher and stringier, you may want to blanch the stalks (but only for a minute).",

      "Using water will give you a looser crumb, whereas milk will give you a tighter one and a bit richer flavor. Milk will raise the calorie count, where water will lower it. Use whichever you prefer. Pour your liquid of choice into the bowl of a mixer. Add the honey, olive oil, lemon zest and thyme leaves.",
      "Add the bread flour, instant yeast, and salt. Using the dough hook, mix on low speed until dough comes together and leaves the sides and bottom of the bowl. Have a little flour and water to hand in case you need to adjust the balance. Once the dough comes together, turn off mixer and cover the top of the bowl with a piece of plastic (which you will reuse). Let the dough rest for 15 minutes. This is called an autolyse. It allows the gluten to continue to absorb water and gliadin to continue to form without the stress and heat generated by kneading.",
      "While the dough is resting, saute the scallions in a bit of olive oil and some salt. When tender, spread out on a plate and refrigerate to cool.",
      "When the rest period is over, remove plastic and turn mixer on to low speed. It should stand right up and come to attention. Allow to knead for a couple of minutes, then stop the mixer and pull off a walnut-sized piece of dough. Round it up between your palms, then gently begin teasing it down over your fingertips. You are testing the dough for a windowpane. You want to see how thin you can get the dough without it tearing. The strength of the windowpane tells you how well you have developed the gluten, which is what will give your bread is structure. If you don't get a strong windowpane, continue kneading on low speed for another couple of minutes, then test again.",
      "Stop the mixer and add the cooled rice and scallions. Add 1/4 cup flour, then begin mixing on low speed again. You may need a bit more flour if the ingredients seem reluctant to be incorporated. When they are fully incorporated (yes, it's ok if the dough is sticky at this point), stop the mixer.",
      "Oil or pan spray a bowl large enough to contain the dough when doubled. Turn the dough into it and turn it over once. Cover with your piece of plastic and allow to rise at room temperature until nicely doubled. This is a heavy dough, so this may take over an hour.",
      "When finished rising, turn dough out onto a floured work surface. Divide it in half. Shape each into a round or oval and set on a baking sheet lined with parchment. Sprinkle the tops of the loaves with flour and drape the piece of plastic over them. Allow to rise again at room temperature until you can gently poke them, and the dough retains the indentation of your finger.",
      "Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Just before placing loaves in oven, use a serrated knife to carve some decorative slashes in them. Place in oven and bake for 35-40 minutes, rotating the baking sheet halfway through. Bread is done when it reads 165 degrees on an instant-read thermometer.",

      "Bring half a stock pot of water or stock to a boil. (Eyeball the amount of water compared to the amount of vegetables you will be using, you want a couple of inches of water over the top of the honored ingredient.) Wash, roughly slice vegetables to a uniform size, and add them to the water. Leave to boil for at least thirty minutes, depending on the done-ness of the vegetables. You may have to skim some scum off the top of the soup if you are using parsnips.",
      "When the vegetables are in the interval between thoroughly cooked and boiled to hell, salt the soup, and puree in a blender or with an immersion blender. I prefer to puree at a high speed for the maximum emulsion, which gives the creamiest mouthfeel. If you are making this soup in steps, it's important to heat the soup before it is blended. (Unless you are a lucky SOB with a Vitamix. Then many rules don't apply to you.) The only tricky thing to making this soup is getting the water levels right. Since some of the vitamins will leech from the veggies, you don't want to discard the water or stock post-boiling and lose those nutrients. At this step, if you wish, add a pat of butter. My guess is you'll be surprised you don't need it, because this velvety puree will hit all the right notes. Grind some fresh pepper over the top and serve plain or with a dollop of creme fraiche, yogurt, or croutons. Some like shredded cheese as well."

      "Chill at least overnight, or longer. The gluten needs time to work its magic on the dough.",
      "When you're ready to start baking, preheat the oven to 375 degrees Farenheit (or 350 if you have a convection oven).",
      "Roll the cold dough into balls using a bit less than a tablespoon per cookie. Roll them in the reserved raw cane sugar. (It's easiest to put the sugar in a shallow bowl and do five or six at a time.)",
      "Place on parchment lined cookie sheets, with no less than 2 inches between each cookie. Do not flatten them, except as necessary to prevent them from rolling off the cookie sheet. They should look like balls sitting on the pan when they go into the oven. The heat will flatten them out.",
      "Bake in the middle of the oven for ten minutes, then remove from the oven. They should be a very pale brown, just around the edges. If they look just a bit underdone, remove them from the oven anyway. They'll cook a bit more on the baking sheet once they are out of the oven.",
      "Let them sit on the cookie sheet for a few minutes, then transfer gently to a cooling rack.",
      "When cool, put the cookies right away into an airtight container with a slice of fine-crumbed sandwich bread.",
      "For subsequent batches, rinse the cookie sheet under very cold water to cool it off before covering with parchment and placing the cookie dough on it. This dough will keep for about a week in the refrigerator, with the cookies getting chewier and chewier, the longer you keep the dough, thanks to the gluten.",
      "Enjoy!!",
      "Note: To get the most flavor, use a traditional zester and not a microplane grater. With the microplane, you leave too much of the flavor-rich oil on the grater. Also, you can recover the liquid otherwise lost in the chopping process by zesting the lemon over a cutting board on which you've put about a tablespoon of sugar (in this case, raw cane turbinado sugar). Let the zest drop onto the sugar, and chop it with the sugar. (This also keeps the zest from all sticking to the blade.) After you've chopped the zest about half way, sprinkle another tablespoon of sugar over the zest, then continue with your chopping. The sugar will soak up the oils and other liquids from the zest. And do this with a knife on a cutting board, not in a chopper or blender, because just as you leave too much of the juice and oils from the zest on the microplane grater, you leave too much of that great flavor behind in the bowl of the chopper or blender. If you do this a few hours before you use it, you will be amazed at how wet with the juice and oils from the peels the sugar becomes. Raw cane sugar works well for this."

The exact time needed will depend on the quantity of beans and the make of your pressure cooker. Basically, cook it till everything is properly combined. Another trick to amalgamate the mixture is to take out a few spoonfuls of boiled rajma, mash them and then add back to the cooker before cooking them for the second time.",

    "title": "maple and mustard glazed turkey with killer gravy",
    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "With an electric mixer, or with a wooden spoon and a bowl, mix the softened butter with the maple syrup, mustard, and poultry seasoning. Divide the flavored butter into two equal-sized portions and put one into a small covered container to keep at room temperature until roasting the turkey. Place the other half onto a square of plastic food wrap or wax paper and shape into a 3-inch log with a spatula or spoon.",
      "Wrap the butter and tidy up the shape, flattening the ends. Place it on a flat surface in the freezer, to freeze until solid.",
      "Several hours before roasting, take the turkey out of the refrigerator to bring to room temperature. Remove the neck and any giblets (often packed in a paper packet) from the cavity of the bird and reserve. Rinse the turkey and pat it dry with paper towels. Preheat the oven to 325\u00b0F.",
      "Remove the log of basting butter from the freezer and slice it into thin slices. Slide your fingers underneath the skin on the turkey breast and gently work your fingers back and forth to separate the skin from the meat. Then place the butter slices, one at a time, under the skin, spacing them out over the turkey breast. It will look lumpy, but when the butter melts and bastes the turkey meat, the skin will smooth right out again.",
      "Peel and chop the carrots, onions and celery into large dices. Place two of the bay leaves into the cavity of the turkey, then add the diced vegetables. Truss the turkey by tying the legs with kitchen twine, or by tucking the ends of the legs under the flap of skin at the tail end, if it has one. Tuck the wing tips under the back. If the legs come out from the flap during roasting, tie them together with kitchen twine. Place the turkey, breast side up, on a roasting rack inside a large roasting pan. Using your fingers, rub a thin layer (about a tablespoon) of the reserved soft glazing butter all over the turkey. Pour 2 cups of the water into the roasting pan around the turkey. If the roaster has a lid, put it on. Otherwise, cover the turkey with heavy duty foil, wrapping it firmly around the lip of the roasting pan to make a good tent for the turkey to steam in.",
      "Once the turkey is roasting, put the reserved neck and giblets into a saucepan. Cover with the remaining 4 cups of water, and add the bay leaf, star anise pod and peppercorns. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low. Cover the saucepan and leave it to simmer slowly the whole time the turkey is roasting. This will be the base for your gravy. The heart and gizzard add good flavor, but if your giblet packet contains the liver I would advise removing it as soon as it has come to a boil, and using it for another purpose (my cats love it), or leaving it out altogether. Leaving the liver in the broth to simmer for a long time will add a bitter taste to your gravy.",
      "Allow the turkey to roast for about 15 minutes per pound, or a little less, using the times for 'unstuffed' turkeys (the cut-up vegetables are much less dense than bread stuffing and still allow warm air to circulate inside the turkey). During the last hour of baking, periodically baste the bird with the remainder of the soft maple-mustard butter by brushing it all over the skin using a pastry brush. Insert a meat thermometer into the turkey breast, not touching the bone, and start checking the temperature after 3 hours. I find that by cooking the turkey this way, in a covered roaster with water in the bottom, it usually cooks faster than the recommended time because of the moist heat. It browns nicely if the roaster is large enough and has a lid, but if you find the turkey isn't browning enough, remove the lid (or the foil) during the last hour to half hour of the roasting time.",
      "While the turkey is resting, make the gravy:\r\n\r\nPour the juices from the roasting pan through a strainer into a large saucepan. Also strain in the liquid from the simmering neck and giblets. With a large spoon, remove as much fat as you easily can from the top of the broth, leaving a few tablespoons in to add flavor to the gravy. (Reserve this combination of melted basting butter and turkey fat to use some of it instead of butter in the mashed potatoes, then refrigerate the rest to use for frying.) Add the reserved diced vegetables from the turkey to the broth. Bring to a boil, and allow to boil for 5 minutes (to get any extra flavor from the vegetables). Using a slotted spoon, remove the vegetables to a small serving bowl and keep warm. (Toss with a bit of butter and salt and pepper and serve alongside the turkey.)",
      "Add the salt to the broth. In a small jar with a lid, make a slurry of the 1/4 cup sweet rice flour by mixing it with about 1/2 cup water and shaking vigorously until there are no lumps.",
      "Bring the broth back to a boil, and pour the flour slurry in a slow stream while constantly whisking with your other hand. If it is not as thick as you like, make up some more flour and water slurry, and whisk in small amounts at a time until the gravy is thickened to your liking. Taste and season with pepper, plus more salt if needed. It may need up to a teaspoon more salt. (A gravy should be well salted, as its saltiness is diminished when combined with the mashed potatoes.) That is one killer gravy. Makes about 5 cups.",
      "Keep the gravy warm and return your attention to carving the turkey (or pass the job on to a willing volunteer, that is -- delegate someone).",
      "Kitchen Frau Tip: An easy way to carve the breast is to remove each breast-half in one piece, gently prying it loose from the breastbone with your fingers, then cut crosswise into slices.",
      "*Kitchen Frau Note: I find that sweet rice flour makes a foolproof and beautiful silky gravy. Any lumps easily whisk out of it and the texture never gets gummy. You can find sweet rice flour (different than regular rice flour) at health food stores, Asian import stores and sometimes in the gluten-free section of supermarkets. It is often labelled 'mochiko' sweet rice flour or glutinous rice flour in Asian markets. Even though it is ground from glutinous, or sticky, rice, it has no gluten in it and is not sweet -- it just binds gravy much better than regular rice flour and is lighter than wheat flour."

      "After washing, gently shake excess water from mushrooms and pat dry with a paper towel. Bisect the morels lengthwise to produce 8 mushroom halves.",
      "To prepare the crabs, cut each crab in half. Remove the carapace (carefully) and cut into two pieces (4 per crab, total) In the photo I uploaded, the crab has been cut in half. The far left shows the crab with carapace removed, and the carapace (now cut into quarters) is on the far right. You will want to have 8 pieces of crab carapace like the ones on the far right. These will be the topping for the dish.",
      "The meat will come from the body, under the carapace where the legs attach. In the photo above, it is the white meat on the piece of crab on the far left. Cut away the legs (and saute them up in butter as a snack...don't let them go to waste!) and cut the meaty part of the body into two pieces. Again, you will have 8 pieces of crab meat. Don't worry about cleaning it...everything there is edible. You want 8 bite-sized nuggets.",
      "Using the outer layer of a scallion, cut 8 thin, 3-inch long matchsticks of scallion. Set aside.",
      "Heat the butter in a skillet until just bubbling. Add the morels, honeycomb side down. Add the 8 lumps of crab meat and the carapace pieces. If your pan isn't big enough to cook everything at once, you may want to put the carapace pieces into a separate pan with butter.",
      "Cook the mushrooms and crab for 2-3 minutes. It won't take long. Remove the mushrooms to plates, and lay one slice of scallion on each mushroom. Place one lump of crab meat on each mushroom. The carapaces should be getting crispy by this point, and turning red.",
      "Finish the dish by placing the crispy carapace on top of the lump of crab, and drizzling some of the (now) browned butter on the plate."

    "title": "recipe for peace of mind thanksgiving week",
    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "The basic idea is to plan your menus in late October or very early in November for the upcoming weeks, and to make double batches of meals, freezing half to serve during the 7 - 10 days before Thanksgiving. It's fall, so soups and stews are perfect for this.",
      "Do you have a written inventory of what's already in your freezer? This is a great time to do it! You'll want to use as much as you can of what's already in there, not just to save time, but also because you'll need room for items you'll be making ahead for Thanksgiving Day, as well as the meals for the week right before it.",
      "Not everything needs to come directly from the freezer. You can also combine holiday prep with week-before dinner prep, e.g., if you are making pie crusts (and freezing them now), make an extra to use in a quiche for dinner one evening when you'll have the oven on for pre-Thanksgiving prep.",
      "To find the article, just type into the search box \"Thanksgiving Hike\" and it should be the first search result. I cannot link within this recipe, but if you copy and paste https://tinyurl.com/OctNov2017Flightplan you can see what I've planned for October and November. Within that document you can link to my \"flightplan\" for the wonderful voyage that begins on the Saturday morning before Thanksgiving and ends when dinner is served on Thursday. It shows the tasks to do each day, including many that can be done in just a few minutes, as well as my grocery lists (with dates assigned) and links to the recipes I'll be using. In early November, I'll pull from my notebooks the recipes I've already printed, and will print and drop into sleeves the new ones.",
      "About those supplies in the \"ingredient\" list above: I use a 1\" 3-ring binder with built-in front and back pockets. In it, I put pocket dividers - one for menus, calendars, shopping and to-do lists, etc., and one for recipes. I print out just about all of the recipes on the holiday menu, even for dishes I've made frequently, just so I'm sure I won't overlook something. I keep a supply of plastic sheet covers for recipes I'm using on a particular day. Like I say in the article, I tend to put my lists initially on large sticky notes; I dictate those into a master shopping \"Note\" on my iPhone. While standing in line, I update it, and then print out the updated Note from my computer, if necessary, and pop that back into the book. (I typically start my December holiday baking plans before Thanksgiving, so notes for that go into another pocket divider. I usually get my baking ingredients during one of my grocery store visits during the week before Thanksgiving. And yes, I go through the same planning process for December, usually over the Thanksgiving weekend.)",
      "Okay, you're right. This is not a recipe. I hope however that you find it helpful and that you enjoy the peace of mind throughout this lovely month that I will certainly be enjoying.",
      "The backstory, and a few additional words about my approach: A few years ago, I wrote an article for Food52 on how I plan ahead so that I can take a long, demanding hike on Thanksgiving Day, and then come home (usually, exhausted) to put our celebration meal on the table within a few hours. There's a good idea in that piece that's worth expanding, especially given the recent interest in planning meals ahead, and also, on preparing and freezing side dishes, rolls, desserts, etc. to serve on Thanksgiving Day. My idea - my practice for many years -- is to plan the dinner menu for the week before Thanksgiving now, in late October, so that meals to be served during the 7 days before Thanksgiving will come mostly from the freezer. There are so many Thanksgiving tasks that can only be handled during that final week. Freezing the primary components of one's dinners for that week will free up valuable time for final advance prep when one would otherwise be cooking the evening meal. If one plans those meals now, and works the preparation of key components into one's cooking schedule over the next few weeks, the result will be the most wonderful peace of mind. With much love and wishing you all good things, AntoniaJames"

Set the vegetables aside to cool.",
      "Meanwhile, in a large saute pan over medium-high heat, warm the remaining 2 tablespoons oil. Once the oil begins to shimmer, add the cumin seeds and cook until they turn a medium shade of brown, about 1 minute max. Reduce the heat to medium and swirl in the turmeric. Add the onion and saute, stirring, for 4 to 6 minutes, until the onion becomes translucent. Add the asafetida (if using), red chile powder, and ginger and cook for another minute.",
      "Stir in the roasted potatoes and cauliflower, including any charred bits from the foil, and gently mix everything together (don't overmix, or the cauliflower will fall apart). Add the salt and cook for 5 to 6 minutes more, until the potatoes and cauliflower are tender (but not soggy!). Remove from the heat and add the lime juice. Taste and adjust the lime juice and salt, if needed. Garnish with the cilantro before serving.",
      "Tip: The easiest way to julienne ginger is to cut the piece of ginger in half lengthwise, cut it into slices, also lengthwise, then cut each slice into thin strips. Cut with, not against, the grain (you know you're going against the grain if you see tiny threads coming out of the ginger as you cut it)."

It should quickly fry but not so hot it burns (just like when making falafels). The secret is getting the oil to the correct frying temperature so as to flash cook the potatoes to crispy perfection on the outside but remain soft yet cooked on the inside. When forming the patties they should be about 3 inches wide and 1/2 inch thick. Once you've cooked the potato pancakes serve hot immediately along with the cold sour cream & chive mixture. Of course if you prefer you can go with the sour cream and applesauce omiting the chives, but I always prefer savory vs. sweet.
