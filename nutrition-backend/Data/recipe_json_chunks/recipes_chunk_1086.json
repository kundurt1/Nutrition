      "Once the dough is mixed, place it in a large greased bowl, turning once to coat both sides, and cover with plastic wrap. Refrigerate overnight or for up to three days.",
      "On the day that you would like to bake your bread, remove the dough from the refrigerator and let it warm to room temperature--about three hours. The dough should rise to nearly double in size.",
      "Once the dough has risen, form the loaves. Coat your hands with flour and gently form a loaf by pulling the dough around itself to create a slightly stretched skin. You may need to coat your hands several times if the dough is sticky. If necessary, pinch the seams together on the bottom of the loaf. Lay the loaf gently in a well-greased loaf pan (5x9-inch) and cover with plastic wrap. Repeat with the second loaf. Let double again in size, about 1 1/2 hours.",
      "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Once the dough has doubled (the loaf should be very puffy), place the two loaves on a shelf in the top half of the oven, well-spaced so that air can circulate between the loaves. Bake for thirty minutes or until done. The interior of the loaves should register at least 185 degrees F when an insta-read thermometer is inserted through the bottom crust. Remove the bread from the pans and cool on wire racks. Let it cool completely before cutting."

(I use the whisk for the first three cups and then switch to a wooden spoon or silicone spatula for the last three cups. For the very last cup, I don't even stir.).",
      "(Take any rings off between Steps 2 and 3. I learned this the hard way. Keep them on the counter that is farthest away from the garbage disposal. I also learned this the hard way.).",
      "3. Add a little extra flour to your hands and knead the dough, about 5 minutes. (Maybe this will get me in trouble with the baking police, but I knead the dough right in the large mixing bowl. It keeps my counter cleaner.) Place kneaded dough in a large, greased bowl and cover with towel.",
      "4. After an hour, your dough should have risen significantly. (Here comes the best part!) Punch the dough (Don't hold back! Get out all your frustration!) and then knead again for a couple of minutes. Divide into two lightly-greased loaf pans and cover with your towel once more.",
      "5. After allowing the dough to rise for 30 minutes in the loaf pans, bake in a preheated oven at 325 for 30-35 minutes. (For my oven, it's about 33 minutes. A lot of bread recipes use an oven at 350. I find 325 works better for honey.)."

I've been making my own candy glass for years, and while I'm glad I have that experience under my belt, isomalt is worlds easier to work with and nowhere near as finicky! It's available to order online or pick up at your local cake supply store. If you're on a budget or don't have time to pick up isomalt, please see my candy glass recipe (in the ingredient section under Hocus Pocus Cottage Cake) for a homemade substitute!",
      "I will say the same danger applies here as candy glass and you should use extreme caution when working with either. This liquid is EXTREMELY hot! I made the mistake of working in bare feet, and a single drop caused a really unpleasant burn! So long sleeves, thick pants, eye protection, shoes, and gloves are what I recommend! You may look like a lunatic, but who cares!?.",
      "Instructions:",
      "Break toothpicks in half and using your hot glue gun adhere to the backs of your jewels to use as a handle when pressing the shapes into your mold.",
      "Follow molding putty directions by mixing equal parts of the two putty's and rolling out with a rolling pin. Press jewels into the putty and remove immediately to create molds. Allow to set (About 30 minutes or so).",
      "Put 2 cups isomalt crystals into a pot and melt at medium heat, stirring occasionally until all crystals are dissolved, and the mixture is bubbling. Remove from heat and add coloring. Wait till the mixture is clear before using.",
      "Once ready, using a small metal spoon or measure, pour tiny amounts into your jewel molds one at a time. Use a toothpick or needle to sharpen or perfect edges.",
      "Allow to cool. Remove from molds and apply directly to your cookie! I adhered mine by resting the jewels in the places I wanted and piped royal icing as brackets to fasten. Once the royal icing had dried completely, I used gold luster dust to paint the brackets gold giving them a fairly realistic jewel look."

While the milk mixture heats to scalding, whisk together the egg yolks with the brown sugar and cornstarch in a medium bowl until they're light in color and slightly fluffy. Gently stream about one-third of the hot milk mixture into the eggs while whisking continuously. This is called tempering. It's important to whisk while streaming the hot milk. If you just pour in the hot milk and then whisk, you may get scrambled eggs.",

      "Strain, cover, and chill the custard for at least 8 hours. Strain the custard through a fine-mesh strainer into a heatproof container. Cover with plastic wrap so that it's directly touching the entire surface of the custard and none of it is exposed to air. This prevents a skin from developing. Transfer the container to an ice bath and let it cool for about 30 minutes to stop the cooking process. Transfer the container to the refrigerator. Chill until the custard is completely cold, at least 8 hours.",
      "Once the custard is completely cold....Dissolve the gelatin in the cold water. Pour the water into a small. saucepan or microwave-safe container and evenly sprinkle the gelatin on top. Allow to sit until the gelatin appears to have absorbed as much water as it can, about 2 minutes. This is called blooming. Gently warm over low heat and stir until the gelatin is completely dissolved into the liquid, about 3 minutes. If using a microwave, heat on medium power and check every 30 seconds until the gelatin is completely dissolved. The total time will depend on the microwave's voltage.",

Stream the alcohol and gelatin mixture through a fine-mesh strainer into the custard and whisk until thoroughly blended.",

Repeat the layers twice more with the remaining ice cream and pecans, then gently fold it all together. Be sure to work quickly-if the ice cream melts too much, it will just get icy once it's in the freezer."

The bacon and brown sugar doesn't stay as crispy that way, but since most parties will have a varying number of attendees we find it's easier to make large batches during the holidays. Before reheating, you can sprinkle a bit more brown sugar over them to make up for any that fell off. ;).",

Starting at the long edge, roll the dough up, jellyroll style. Seal the edges. Cut the roll into 3/4- to 1-inch slices and arrange them in the prepared pan. Cover the pans and let the dough rise for about 1 hour.",
      "Heat oven to 400 degrees F.",
      "Bake the rolls for 15 minutes, then turn the heat down to 350 degrees F and continue baking for about another 20 minutes. Rotate the pan halfway through baking to insure even browning. Remove the buns from the oven, place a serving plate over each pan and invert the buns onto the plate. Leave the pan in place until the buns are securely on the plate, topping and all. Serve warm if possible."

      "The night before you want to eat this, grease a baking dish. I use a 9x9 glass baking pan (2 qt) so that the resulting product will be coffee cake height. If you use a 9x13 pan, you won't need to bake it on a cookie sheet to catch drippings (or clean the oven afterwards), but will have a flatter casserole. Cube the bread and spread it evenly in the pan. In a medium bowl, whisk together the custard (eggs, milk, half-and-half and vanilla). Pour over the bread cubes, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight/8 hours.",
      "The next morning, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a small bowl (I use the pyrex 4-cup measuring cup I used to melt the butter in the microwave), combine the topping ingredients (melted butter, brown sugar, syrup and pecans). Spoon topping over bread and custard mixture. In the 9x9 pan, it will cover the custard completely.",
      "Bake in preheated oven until golden, about 40 minutes. Bake it on top of a cookie sheet if you are using a 9x9 pan or you will have melted butter spattered all over the bottom of your oven afterwards.",
      "When you take it out of the oven, the butter will still be bubbling. Let it rest at least 5 minutes, and it will be reabsorbed into the casserole, and you will have a nice crunchy topped casserole that holds together when cut into."
