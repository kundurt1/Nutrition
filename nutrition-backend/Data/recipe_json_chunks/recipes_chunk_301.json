When milk bubbles, remove stick, then slowly add milk mixture to egg mixture, stirring constantly. Stir in vanilla. Place all combined ingredients into the oval baking dish. Place in a larger baking dish and add water to 1-inch height in the outer pan. Bake in a preheated 325\u00b0 oven, uncovered, about 90 minutes. Because of all the fat-free ingredients, it takes longer to set up. Cool on wire rack and refrigerate up to 6 hours before unmolding. Loosen edges of flan with a spatula and invert.
