Pull the skin and meat around the stuffing, to join at the original backbone cut, completely enclosing the stuffing and recreating the shape of the turkey. Sew or lace the back of the turkey up with kitchen twine and a large needle or skewers. Rub the entire outside of the stuffed turkey with olive oil. Tie the drumstick ends together with kitchen twine. Place the roast in a roasting pan.",

Remove the turkey from the oven, cover with a doubled sheet of aluminum foil, and allow to rest in a warm area about 10 to 15 minutes before slicing."
