The mixture will get quite lumpy and sticky. Reduce heat to low and stir for one minute. Do not skip this step. This allows the flour to absorb absolutely every drop of water possible and the rest to evaporate. Remove from heat and transfer to a mixing bowl. Let cool approximately 5 minutes or until you can touch the dough without letting out a holler! Add one egg at a time and stir until dough absorbs it completely. Do not add them all at once. When you are through, your dough should be smooth and will form a \"V\" shape as the excess drops away when you pull the spoon up out of it.",

Either way, use a greased sheet pan or use a silpat and keep them at least 2 inches apart. They will get much larger and they need space!

While you're working with it, you will probably have to put it in the freezer for a couple of minutes every once in a while. If this butter gets too warm, it will come through the mesh and not be separated.

      "In a small bowl, mix up the ricotta, spinach, parmesan, egg, flour, salt and pepper. Dust your hands with flour and roll the ricotta mix into dumplings. I make them about 1/2 the size of a golf ball or small walnut sized. Place on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and put in the freezer. Just about 20-30 minutes as you start the soup. This will help the dumplings to firm up and steam well in the soup.",
      "Egg Mixture -- In a small sauce pan, bring 1 cup of the broth to a simmer on medium heat. In a small bowl or measuring cup, mix the lemon juice, flour and eggs and mix well. Once the broth warms up, slowly drizzle 1/2 of the broth, a little at a time into the egg mixture. This will temper the eggs, which means the eggs will warm up to the temperature of the broth and they won't scramble when added into the warm broth. Now, slowly add all the egg mixture back into the rest of the broth in the pot. Then cook the egg and broth mixture on medium heat until slightly thickened. Don't let it boil. Once it thickens, just turn off the heat, this will be added later.",
      "Soup Base -- In a large soup pot, add the olive oil and bring to medium-medium high heat. Add in the onion, garlic, celery mushrooms and pinch of salt, and saute for 3-4 minutes until tender. Add the broth and bring to a light boil boil for about 5 minutes.",
      "Dumplings -- Now, depending on the size of your pot you may be able to cook the dumplings all at once, but I don't like to crowd them. I add in 1/2 the dumplings and a time, you don't want to over crowd them and cook 4-5 minutes until done. They will start to float. Remove to a bowl and add the remaining dumplings, cook another 4-5 minutes.",
      "Finish Soup -- Reduce the temperature of the soup to medium low, and then slowly add the egg mixture to the soup, along with the chicken, cooked orzo, dill and check for seasoning. Add in the dumplings and just heat and serve.",

Press the dough evenly over the bottom of the pan, Bake for 25- 30 minutes, or until the crust is well browned at the edges and lightly browned in the center.",

Once the milk and eggs are well mixed, add a litte more hot milk and mix again. This step tempers the eggs so that you don't end up with scrambled eggs. Then pour the yolk/milk mixture into the milk in the pan and start stiring gently, but constantly. Allow the mixture to heat back up to steaming, making sure that the mixture doesn't boil. The mixture should thicken up to about the consistency of heavy cream. Remove from heat and stir vigoursly for about 3 minutes to cool slightly and then pour into the blender with the marshmallows.",
      "Cover the blender and run it for about a minute to mix well and then allow the mixture to sit for a couple of minutes (this helps the remaining marshmallow chunks to start breaking down). Run the blender again for about a minute and then add the vanilla and the cold cream and run the blender for about 30 seconds more. Pour the mixture into a bowl, cover then refrigerate for at least 8 hours. Right before churning in your favorite ice cream maker, whisk the ice cream mixture to throughly blend everything together.

Here are simple tips to help you freeze your eggs properly. In the case of Whole Eggs, beat lightly before freezing. To freeze yolks, beat in either 1/8 teaspoons salt or 1 1/2 tsp . sugar or corn syrup per 1/4 cup egg yolks (about 4 yolks). For egg whites, you can freeze them as they are. For faster thawing and easier measuring, you can freeze eggs (after having followed the proper tips listed above) in an ice cube tray and then transfer them to a freezer container. It is important to note that although eggs can be frozen, they should not be frozen in their shell."

Fold in any section of leaf that are sticking out as you roll. The amount of rice each leaf can hold depends on how large the leaf is. In the jars I buy, the size of leaves can vary wildly. The small leaves may take only a 1/2 tablespoon and the large leaves may take up to 2 tablespoons. When in doubt, use less so you don't tear the leaves or have stuffed leaves unrolling on you.",
      "Tear off a sheet of tin-foil about an inch wider than your steamer basket. Use a sharp knife to slash a few holes across the middle. The holes should be thin, fairly short, and number no more than 6 or 7. Place the stuffed leaves in single row in the middle of the foil lined up along the long sides. Picture a layer in a box of matches, except with stuffed grape leaves. Leave about 2 inches clear on each side of the row. Fold the sides of the foil over the stuffed leaves on either side. Fold the bottom up over the leaves. Now fold the top over as well. If there is still excess foil, carefully fold it over again. The goal is to a have a pouch that's almost fully sealed except for the holes you cut. Place the pouch in your steamer basket and repeat with more foil and the remaining grape leaves until you've got them all wrapped up. It's okay if the foil pouches rest on top of each other in the basket so long as steam can get through the holes in the bottom of each.",

      "Melt the butter in a small sauce pan over medium-low heat. Add 1/2 cup white wine and heavy cream and mix well. Bring to a low simmer and cook for about 5 minutes, stirring often. Do not let the mixture boil! Add cheese and stir until melted and mixed throughly. Add 2 tablespoons white wine, salt, and pepper. Remove from heat and stir in olive oil. Set aside.",
      "When stuffed leaves are done, remove carefully from foil pouches and divide evenly among 4 wide, shallow bowls. Reheat dressing if it cooled too much for your liking and drizzle over leaves. Serve immediately."
