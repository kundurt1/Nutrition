Turn the inside of each lid over so that the metal part inside of the rim is facing up (instead of the side with the rubber seal on it). This way, the pie dough will come in contact with the metal side of the lid rather than the side with the rubber on it. Set the lids aside.",

The dough for the crust (top and bottom) needs to be cut 1-inch larger in diameter than the size of the Mason jar lid. If using 3-inch diameter Mason jar lids, the small dough rounds (pie crusts) need to be 4 inches in diameter. To cut the pie crusts, use a glass (with thin edges) that is 4 inches in diameter or use a Mason jar lid as a guide and cut the round 1-inch larger in diameter with a knife. Each large round of dough should yield 8 pie crusts (small rounds); 2 of the small rounds will need to be made from the scraps after cutting 6 small rounds.",
      "Lay a small round of dough in a Mason jar lid. With your fingers, gently push the dough evenly inside of the lid. Spoon the berry mixture (not the juice) in the pie shell with a slotted spoon-if using a regular spoon, drain the juice back into the bowl (when the berries are in the spoon, lean the spoon on the inside of the bowl to drain the juice). Top the berries with lemon curd. Be careful not to fill the pie shell too full. Leave enough room for the top crust to cover the berries and overlap the bottom crust.",
      "Dip your finger in water and run it around the inside edge of the bottom pie crust. Top the pie with a small round of dough and pinch the edges of the top and bottom crusts together so that they are tightly sealed. Roll the edges of the pie and tuck them into the top of the lid. Repeat the process with the remaining pies.",

Bake in a preheated oven until the pie crusts turn a golden brown, about 35-40 minutes. Juice from the pies may bubble outside of the pies on to the parchment paper. Let the pies cool until the lids are cool enough to handle.",
      "Carefully push the bottoms of the lids up and out of the rim section. Then carefully remove the bottom parts of the lids from the pies. Serve as soon as the pies are removed from the lids so they're still warm."

Stir in the water and the vinegar, then return to the stove and bring to a boil, stirring constantly. (Otherwise it will lump up and stick to the bottom.) Boil and stir for about one minute. I always taste it at this point; if it is not sweet enough, I add more sugar, and if it is not zippy enough, I add more vinegar. Once I get the taste right, I carefully and gently add the crumbled up bacon and the potato slices to the mixture, stirring gently until the mixture is spread all over the potato slices.",

      "2. Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the vanilla and almond extracts.",
      "3. Pour the rice into a bowl, cover with plastic wrap and cool completely in the refrigerator. It doesn't have to be super cold but cool enough to handle.",
      "4. Once the rice is cooled, form the rice into a golf ball-sized ball. I used a slightly heaped 1 1/2 ounce scoop (keep a bowl of water nearby and wet your hands to keep the rice from sticking to them). Flatten the ball out in the palm of your hand to make a disk, now cup your hand so that the rice makes a cup, put a teaspoon of cherry preserves in the center and close the rice around the preserves. Roll the rice in your palms to make a perfect ball. Place on a sheet pan and repeat to make 15 or 16 rice balls. Cover pan with plastic wrap and refrigerate the rice balls for at least an hour. There may be a little weeping from the preserves, just dry the bottoms of the rice balls with a clean paper towel before coating them.",
      "For the arancine:",
      "1. In a food processor pulse the almonds until they're the consistency of breadcrumbs.",
      "2. In a shallow dish combine the processed almonds, breadcrumbs and sugar.",
      "3. In another shallow dish whisk together the eggs and water.",
      "4. In yet another shallow dish combine the flour and salt.",
      "5. The frying oil will need to be a depth of 2 inches, so choose a pan/pot where the oil will come less than half way up the sides. I like a Dutch oven. Clip a candy/frying thermometer onto the side of the pan so that it dips into the oil. Heat the oil over heat between medium and medium high.",
      "6. While the oil is heating coat the rice balls. Start by coating a ball of rice with flour, being sure to shake off the excess, then coat in the egg wash, and finally in the breadcrumbs. Place the coated balls on a clean sheet pan or platter. Repeat until all they're all coated. Now you have arancine.",
      "7. I like to heat the oil to between 365 and 370 F because I don't want the oil temperature to drop below 350 F. Add a few of the arancine into the hot oil (a kitchen spider works well for this) being sure not to over crowd the pan. Cook for about 1 1/2 minutes, turning over the arancine a couple of times to achieve even cooking. When the arancine are a deep golden brown on all sides use the kitchen spider and remove them from the oil to a dish that has a layer of paper towel. Repeat the process and finish frying all of the arancine.",

      "2. Meanwhile, break the chocolate into small pieces into a heat proof, medium bowl, and add the corn syrup as well.",
      "3. When the cream is hot, add it into the bowl with the chocolate and whisk until smooth.",
      "Serve as a dipping sauce or over ice cream. Leftovers can be refrigerated, but will need to be reheated. A touch of cream may be needed to thin it out."

      "Get out two sheet trays and line them with either silicone mats that have macaron templates on them, or parchment paper. If using parchment paper, draw 30 equal circles on each piece to make yourself a template and turn them over to have the ink face down. Take the almond flour and powdered sugar and press them through a fine mesh strainer into a large mixing bowl. This will take a little time and elbow grease but it is completely necessary for the texture of the cookies. Cut open the two tea bags and pour the leaves in. Whisk them together in the bowl to blend them. Then pour in half of the egg white liquid and the vanilla. Use a spatula to fold and mash the mixture together into a uniform paste. Set the paste aside.",
      "Combine the sugar and water in a small saucepan and heat it up over medium high heat. Use a candy thermometer to make sure it reaches 243\u00b0F. While it heats up, set up a stand mixer with a whisk attachment and pour the remaining egg whites into it. Whip up the egg whites on high speed until they hold stiff peaks. Turn the speed to low and keep whipping the egg whites while the sugar comes to temperature on the stove. When the sugar reaches temperature, slowly and carefully pour it into the stand mixer with the egg whites and let it get mixed in. Turn the speed to high and let the meringue whisk together thoroughly until it becomes white, shiny and comes down to room temperature for about 10 minutes.",
      "Take the meringue and fold it in thoroughly with the paste in the mixing bowl. You will need to mash it together a little too to break up the paste into the meringue. It should become a smooth, shiny and pretty mixture with the flecks of tea leaves. Scoop half of it into a pastry bag with a 1/2 inch opening. Hold the opening over the center of the first circle on your sheet tray template and gently squeeze until it is filled. If there is a little point on top don't worry, it will dissolve. Fill the first sheet this way, then repeat with the second half of meringue on the other sheet tray.",
      "Now this is the heart stopping but necessary part. Lift each filled sheet tray about 8 inches above the counter and let it drop onto the counter. This will get out all of the air bubbles to make a really smooth, shiny top. Let the trays sit out for 30 minutes to dry out and firm up a little. When the 30 minutes are almost up, fit a rack in the center of the oven and preheat it to 350\u00b0F. Bake the first tray for 6 minutes, then rotate the tray to ensure even baking and let them bake for another 6-7 minutes. Take that tray out and let the cookies cool completely and bake the second tray in the same way. Let that tray cool completely too.",
      "While the cookies bake and cool, make the buttercream. Wash out the stand mixer bowl and get it set back up with the paddle attachment. Beat the butter in it until it is fluffy, then cut the tea bag open and dump in the leaves. Also add in the vanilla. Finally, slowly pour in the powdered sugar until you have a luscious frosting. Transfer the frosting to a piping bag and pipe a thick, single layer on the flat side of half of the macarons. Then place the flat side of another cookie on top and gently twist a little to make sure it all sticks together and the buttercream goes out to the edge. Once they are all assembled, enjoy immediately, and store any leftovers sealed up in the refrigerator!"

      "Preheat to oven to 350\u00b0F. Prepare a 9x13 cake pan by lining it in parchment paper and greasing and flouring the sides.",
      "In a heavy saucepan, combine butter, water and canola oil and set over medium heat until butter is just melted. Meanwhile, in the large bowl of your mixer, add sugar, cocoa and flour. Pour in the butter mixture and beat until smooth. Mix in eggs one at a time, followed by the buttermilk. Finally, add baking soda, salt and vanilla all at once and mix one final time.",
      "Pour cake batter into prepared pan and bake for approximately 30 to 35 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool.",
      "Once cake has cooled, remove from the pan and place on a flat smooth surface. I cut my individual cakes using a wide-mouthed glass. My glass had a 3 1/2 inch diameter, but you could use a jar, glass or cookie cutter of roughly a similar size. I found it helped to lightly spray the inside of the glass and edges with butter-flavored cooking spray. Once I pressed the glass down to cut out the cake, I lifted the glass up and put my hand underneath it to catch the cake as it slid slowly out of the glass. I used the same technique to cut out all of the small round cakes.",
      "In a small sauce pan over medium low heat, heat chopped semi sweet chocolate and butter. Cutting the chocolate into smaller chunks helps it melt evenly. Meanwhile, heat cream in the microwave until it is warm (I microwaved mine for 40 seconds). Keep an eye on your chocolate. Give it an occasional stir as it melts, and as soon as it does, pull pan off heat and slowly pour in warm cream while stirring the chocolate mixture. Stir until chocolate and cream come together and you get a glossy-looking mixture.",
      "While the ganache is still warm, spoon a small amount on each cake and spread evenly using an offset spatula or butter knife. While your chocolate ganache is still warm, heat white chocolate in a microwavable bowl-I heated mine for 30 seconds and then stirred it and then heated it for another 20 seconds. You want the chocolate to melt but you want to make sure it does not burn.",
      "Take a plastic pastry bag (they are easy to find at any craft store) and fill it with the melted white chocolate. The trick I use is to put my pastry bag inside a tall narrow glass and then fold the plastic edges of the pastry bag down. The glass will hold the pastry bag and make it easy for you to pour in your white chocolate.",
      "Cut a small hole at the very tip of the bag and you are ready to pipe the spider webs. To make the web, pipe a white chocolate spiral on each cake. While it is still warm, take a toothpick and lightly drag it from the center out to form a web. I had a paper towel nearby and cleaned the toothpick end after each time.",
      "Next comes the fun part for my girls, because making things out of fondant is like playing with play-dough. Roll 6 little balls of black fondant, which you can buy pre-colored and ready to go from your local craft store. Then roll out some long thin snake-like pieces. To make spider legs, cut 4 even pieces of rolled snakes using scissors or a knife. Then make a bow-tie-like middle by pinching the legs together so you have 8 legs with four on each side. Put the little balls on top on each set of spider legs. I had some colored sprinkles we used to make stripes on our spiders and I used some white dragees to make eyes. If you are running short on time, just get some small plastic spiders. Place a spider on each cake.",

      "3. Your crumb coat layer of frosting will turn a mottled brown from the cake. This is normal! The cake does also get mottled brown/white finish after it's all decorated if you let it sit. So, if you want a pure white cake, frost it and serve immediately. However, both Mr. FFF and I thought it looked really pretty when it got mottled colors!"

Get out a skillet and heat the olive oil in it over medium high heat. Add the mushrooms and tomatoes and let them cook until tender for about 6-7 minutes. Then add in the spinach and let it just wilt in, followed by the seasoning of salt, pepper and garlic powder. Finally, add the cheese to melt in. Stir it all together well and set it aside.",
      "Make the easy dressing next. Whisk the lemon zest, lemon juice and Dijon together in a bowl thoroughly. Then slowly pour in the olive oil while you keep whisking until you have a gorgeous, pale yellow dressing. Take the quinoa and the dressing and stir them both into the skillet of vegetables. Then you have three options. You can serve it warm immediately, leave it out and serve it at room temperature, or chill it in a sealed container for up to a day ahead of time! It's so versatile."

Use a rubber spatula to stir all of the ingredients together then mix at low speed until a soft dough forms. Increase speed to medium-high and beat 3 minutes more. You may have to stop occasionally if you see dry bits settling in the bottom of the mixer. Bring everything together with your hands and then continue kneading with the dough hook until a uniform ball is made.",

      "I prefer bread flour in cookies (and lots of recipes) versus all-purpose. The extra protein in bread flour helps to bind to all of the butter in these cookies. All-purpose flour can be subbed for the bread flour, just add 3-4 more tablespoons of all purpose flour.",
      "Most grocery stores have Heath Bar Toffee Bits for sale in the baking aisle. If you can't find them, use any toffee bar, or buy a Heath candy bar and chop it up into bits for this recipe.",
      "And make sure to use actual fresh ground coffee beans in this recipe, not instant coffee or instant espresso. Both will just dissolve in the recipe and you won't get the rich coffee flavor that I loved most about these cookies. I am a coffee lover so I probably could have added another teaspoon and been OK. But if you aren't as much of a fan, feel free to reduce the amount of coffee you add."

Cover the jar loosely with a glass or plastic lid, or a clean napkin secured with a rubber band.",

      "Subsequent feedings:",
      "Feed exactly the same way as the second feeding.",
      "Continue feeding your starter every 12-24 hours until it doubles in volume every 8-12 hours, has a pleasant, yeasty smell, and passes the float test (see note). Once it passes the float test, your starter is ready to be baked with!",
      "The whole process of getting your starter established can take anywhere from 5-10 days. Be patient and use your eyes, nose, and the float test to determine if it's ready.",
      "You can switch to feeding the starter organic unbleached all-purpose flour if you like. Continue feeding your starter once a day for a total of 2 weeks.",
      "Keeping your starter in the refrigerator:",
      "At this point you can start storing your starter in the refrigerator: Feed your starter one last time, let it sit at room temperature for about half an hour, then place it in the refrigerator.",
      "Feed your starter at least once a week: Take it out of the refrigerator and let it sit at room temperature for about an hour. Discard all but 50 grams of the starter, and feed with 50 grams each of flour and water (or however much you need for your recipe).",
      "You can either let the starter sit until it doubles and passes the float test (to use in a recipe), or just let it sit for half an hour and stick it back in the fridge.",
      "Keeping your starter at room temperature:",
      "You can store your starter at room temperature indefinitely if you make sure to feed it almost every day. A missed day here and there won't hurt an established starter, but if you starve it too long, it will die.",
      "Note: For the float test, drop a small amount of starter into a glass of room-temperature water. If it floats, the starter passed the test! If it sinks, you either need to let the starter sit longer to develop more bubbles, or feed it again and let it sit until it passes the float test (usually 6-12 hours)."

    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "First, the dough part needs at least 8 hours or up to overnight to rise and ferment properly. Heat the milk in a microwave safe bowl for about 90 seconds to get it to the perfect temperature for the yeast. Crumble the fresh yeast into it and let it bloom in the milk for 5 minutes. While the yeast works, measure out with a kitchen scale and whisk together the two flours, sugar and salt in a large mixing bowl. Then whisk the yeast into the milk to make sure it is dissolved. Pour the yeasty milk into the dry ingredients and stir it all together thoroughly with a big, sturdy spoon until it comes together into a gorgeous ball of dough. Cover it with plastic wrap and set it in the refrigerator to ferment and rise for at least 8 hours. I find it's best to make it the night before.",
      "Once you make the dough, you can also form the butter slab. Lay out a big piece of plastic wrap and lightly flour it. Lay out the butter on one half of it and flour the top of the butter as well. Bring the other half of plastic over the top and lightly press the butter out with your hands into a thin rectangle in between the plastic. Put it in the refrigerator to become solid again and it will be ready when the dough is! When the dough is ready it is time for the elbow grease. Punch it down and turn it out onto a well floured, clean surface. Roll it out into a big rectangle at least double the size of your butter slab. Place the butter slab in the middle of it on an angle and then fold the sides of the dough over the butter so that the slab is completely enveloped in the dough.",
      "Roll the dough out a little thinner to work the butter into the dough, then fold it into thirds like a letter. Flatten it out and roll it out again into a large rectangle, then fold it into thirds again. Flatten it out again and wrap the dough in plastic. Let it rest in the refrigerator for 2 hours. This counts as two turns, which is the most important part of laminating the dough into those flaky layers. When the 2 hours is up, repeat the process again of doing two turns with rolling out the dough, folding it, rolling it out again and folding it again. Refrigerate it and let it rest again for 2 hours. This will start to take some real elbow grease and lots of bench flour since you are starting to form some serious layers.",
      "When that final 2 hours is up, punch down the dough and cut it in half. Set one half back in the refrigerator while you work with the first half and get out two sheet trays. Line the sheet trays with silicone mats or parchment. Take that first half and roll it out into a rectangle that measures about 10 x 18 inches. Cut that rectangle into 6 big triangles by making diagonal cuts along the length of the rectangle to form the triangles. Place a tablespoon of almond paste at the wide base of each triangle. Then roll each one up tightly from the base to the pointy end, pulling gently on it as you roll it so that it is tightly rolled. Place them staggered on one of the baking sheets. Repeat this whole process with the other half of dough and fill the other baking sheet. Let them sit and rise at room temperature for an hour.",
      "When the hour is up, preheat oven to 350\u00b0F. Whisk the egg, almond extract and water together in a bowl and brush it really generously on each formed croissant. Sprinkle each croissant with lots of sliced almonds and lightly press them in so that they stick to the egg wash. Bake the croissants for 30-40 minutes, until they are completely golden and crisp. Let them cool a bit and then sprinkle each of them with powdered sugar. Serve warm with great coffee and enjoy!"

If you don't have a thermometer, you'll know it's ready when you sprinkle some flour in the pot and it sizzles. If it gets hotter than 350 F or starts smoking, remove the pot from burner immediately and let it cool down to the correct temperature.",

Use the slotted spoon to flip them over every 30 seconds. Fry for 2-3 minutes or until golden brown on both sides. If they are taking longer than 3 minutes to brown you need to turn your burner up and make sure your oil is at the correct temperature. Remove with slotted spoon and place on paper towels to drain.

      "2. The meat filling for the omeletten may be made a day ahead of time, refrigerated, and reheated briefly. The omeletten are made right before serving.",
      "You will also need:",
      "1. A Dutch oven or heavy-bottomed casserole with a lid.",
      "2. A spatula or wooden spoon.",
      "3. An electric mixer, standing or hand.",
      "4. A crepe pan or any flat-bottomed pan with sloping sides. The photographed omeletten were made in a 9-inch crepe pan.",
      "5. A 1/3-cup size measuring cup is useful for measuring out the amount of batter as you make the omeletten.",
      "6. A small saucer of vegetable oil and a paper towel for wiping over the pan as you make the omeletten.",
      "7. A plate on which to stack the omeletten as they are made and a cotton kitchen towel to cover and keep them warm.",
      "8. A second plate on which to roll the meat filling in the omeletten before serving.",
      "For the meat filling:",
      "1. Melt the butter in the pot over medium heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring, until it softens and a few bits begin to color.",
      "2. Add the ground beef and cook, breaking it apart with a spatula or spoon, until no trace of pink in the meat remains, all liquid has evaporated, and it is an even, crumbly consistency, without chunks, completely combined with the onion.",
      "3. Add the tomato paste, stirring to combine it with the ground meat mixture. Cook the mixture for several minutes, continuing to stir, until it clumps together into a ball and comes away from the sides of the pot. The bottom of the pot will show traces of fat from the butter and meat and the filling will slide over the pot's surface freely. Add the water to moisten the filling, salt, and cook a few minutes more, stirring again. The cooked filling is a cohesive blend of meat, onion and paste, not a meat mixture in sauce.",
      "4. Remove the filling from the heat. Taste it and adjust the seasoning if necessary. Cover the filling to keep it warm and make the omeletten.",
      "For the omeletten and assembly:",
      "1. Beat the eggs.",
      "2. Mix the flour and salt together and mix half of it into the eggs. Mixing continuously, add half the milk, then the rest of the flour and salt, and finally, the rest of the milk. Continue mixing a little longer to form a smooth batter.",
      "3. Place the saucer of oil and paper towel near the burner on which you will make the omeletten. Place one of the plates and the towel nearby as well.",
      "4. Bunch up the paper towel and dip it in the saucer of vegetable oil. Lightly run the oiled piece of towel over the bottom of the crepe pan. Heat the pan over medium heat until it feels very hot when you place your hand above it but the oil is not smoking.",
      "5. Hold the pan by the handle with one hand and pour a scant 1/3 cup of egg batter into it, tilting the pan back and forth at the same time so that the batter quickly spreads out and forms a circle over the bottom. (The technique is the same one used for making crepes.)",
      "6. Cook the omelette on one side for about 1 minute. When the edges of the omelette show a trace of gold around the rim, slide a spatula carefully around the edges and under the bottom to loosen the cooked side from the pan, then slide the spatula around and under the omelette and flip it over. The cooked side will be a light golden yellow with darker spotting. Cook on the second side for only about 30 seconds. The omelette will puff a little as it cooks on the second side. (The second side may be golden-spotted a little here and there, but it is not essential for it to colour-only to cook.)",
      "7. Transfer the omelette to the plate and cover it with the towel.",
      "8. Wipe the pan with the oiled paper towel and continue making omeletten in the same manner until all the batter is used. (Wipe a little oil over the pan's surface each time before adding batter.)",
      "9. When all the omeletten have been made, place one of them on the second plate. The second, less-coloured side of the omelette should face up.",
      "10. Spoon a scant half-cup of meat filling in a line, a little off-center to your left, down the omelette from top to bottom. (There are photos of the assembly steps on the related link.)",
      "11. Bring the left side of the omelette over the filling to cover it.",
      "12. Roll the omelette to your right to completely enclose the filling.",
      "13. Transfer the fleischomelette to a dinner plate. Roll one for each person and serve them. Reserve the rest of the filling and the second half of the omeletten to roll a second round for everyone after the first has disappeared-which it very likely will."

Start at the top and following the curve of the fruit, run the knife down the length of the fruit to cut the peel off. Repeat until all the peel is removed. Cut closely enough so that you take off all the pith (the white part) but not too deeply so that you waste the fruit. To remove the segments, hold the grapefruit over a bowl and carefully slice inward along the membrane on both sides of a fruit segment, then remove the fruit segment; repeat this for all fruit segments. Once you're done, squeeze the membrane to get all the juice out. For this dish, we need all the grapefruit segments, but only 1 teaspoon of the grapefruit juice.

Finally, pour the strained custard into your ceramic or paper ramekins (which are in your baking dish) and carefully pour HOT water into your roasting pan until it reaches half way up the sides of your ramekins. Bake at 325 F until starting to set. When done it will jiggle a tiny bit in the center. This should take about 30 minutes, but check it towards the end of baking because your oven variations may change baking time.",
      "10. Remove from oven and remove ramekins from the water bath. Allow the pot de creme to cool. It will continue to finish firming up in the center while it cools (and continues to cook). Doing it this way will prevent your custard from over baking!",

I tried on some of them but didn't want to squish the kisses and get caramel everywhere. And, speaking of caramel, try to have most of your Hershey kisses closer to the top than the bottom because they will ooze on your baking sheet and become crunchy. If you don't mind the crunch then this is no big deal. I, however, despise the crunch. So do what your little heart desires!"

Stir vigorously until smooth. You want the glaze to be somewhat thick, but easily pourable. If it seems too thick, add the remaining tablespoon of half-and-half. Pour the glaze over the cake while both the glaze and cake are still warm. The glaze cools quickly, so don't delay!",
      "Let the glaze set. Then slice and enjoy!",

      "Start by bringing a small pot of water to boil. Add in the pearl onions, whole and skin on, and cook for about 3 minutes. After they have cooked, remove them with a slotted spoon and place them in a bowl of ice water to cool. They can sit there until the water has cooled. This process will allow you to easily remove the skin and pop them right out of their housing.",
      "Mix the seasonings in a small bowl.",
      "Dump the seasoning into the bowl of onions, drizzle with a bit of olive oil and give a good stir. Let them sit and marinate until you are ready to use them.",
      "Place the onions on a skewer. Place these on your preheated grill over medium heat and cook for about 8-12 minutes, until they have a nice color and continue to soften.",
      "When you are ready to serve, place them on a serving plate, and drizzle a bit more olive oil over them. Serve these as a side to most any main dish. For me, I simple ate them right off the skewer, and used them the following morning in an omelet. In a nutshell, these pearl onions will not only catch attention, but they are super easy and delicious. Hope you enjoy."

      "For the cupcakes:",
      "1. Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F. Set rack in the middle of the oven.",
      "2. Set out ingredients and equipment. Sift flour. Measure cocoa powder, baking powder, and salt into separate mixing bowl. Add flour and whisk together. Measure half-and-half and vanilla extract into a separate bowl and set aside. Place butter and sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer. Crack eggs into a separate bowl and set aside.",
      "3. With the standing mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream together the butter and sugar on the lowest speed for 3-5 minutes. (This will feel odd, but keep it on low.)",
      "4. With the mixer still on the lowest speed, add the eggs one at a time, fully incorporating after each addition. Stop the mixer and scrape down the sides of the bowl.",
      "5. Add the dry ingredient mixture alternately with the liquid mixture in 3 to 5 additions each, beginning and ending with the dry mixture. Move swiftly through this step to avoid overworking the batter. Don't wait for the dry or liquid mixtures to be fully incorporated before adding the next. This should take a total of about 60 seconds.",
      "6. Stop the mixer and scrape the sides of the bowl all the way down. Don't miss the clumps of ingredients hiding on the bottom. Mix on medium speed for 15 to 20 seconds to develop the batter's structure.",
      "7. Line a cupcake pan with paper liners. Fill cupcake liners with batter using a 2-ounce trigger release ice-cream scoop.",
      "9. Bake for 22 minutes. When the skewer shows a touch of crumbs or comes out clean, the cupcakes is done.",
      "10. Cool cupcakes for 5 minutes before removing from the pan. Allow to cool completely before assembling.",
      "For the ganache:",
      "1. While cupcakes cool, prepare ganche.",
      "2. In a 2-quart, heavy-bottomed saucepan, bring the cream to a light simmer over medium heat.",
      "3. Meanwhile, measure the chocolate and place it in a heat resistant bowl.",
      "4. Once the cream reaches a light simmer, pour it over the chocolate. Wait about 10 seconds for the cream to work its way into all of the crevices of chocolate, then whisk to combine.",
      "5. Let the ganche cool for at least 20 minutes before using. It will begin to thicken.",
      "For the buttercream:",
      "1. While ganache is cooling, make buttercream.",
      "2. Set out ingredients and equipment. Separate the egg whites into the bowl of a standing mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. Measure 1 cup sugar and the water into a 1-quart, heavy-bottomed saucepan. Gently stir to combine. Measure the remaining 1/4 cup of sugar into a separate bowl. Cut the butter into tablespoon sized pieces and set aside.",
      "3. To make the sugar syrup, place the candy thermometer in the sauce pan and heat the mixture over medium-high heat. Partially cover with a lid to capture the evaporating water-this helps to moisten the sides of the saucepan to prevent sugar crystals from forming.",
      "4. With the mixer on high speed, begin whipping the egg whites to stiff peaks. When the peaks are stiff, you have a meringue.",
      "5. Keep the mixture running and pour the 1/4 cup of sugar into the meringue.",
      "6. Raise the heat under the sugar syrup to bring the syrup to 245\u00b0F if it's not there already. When it has reached 245\u00b0F, remove the thermometer and slowly pour the syrup into the meringue, with the mixer running. (It helps to hold the pan just above the height of the mixer. Pour confidently, trying to hit the meringue and not the side of the bowl.)",
      "7. After 1 to 2 minutes, reduce the speed of the mixture to medium for 3-4 minutes or until meringue is cooled. Add the butter 1 tablespoon at a time. Increase the mixer speed to high for 1 to 2 minutes or until the butter is fully incorporated.",
      "To assemble:",
      "1. Cut a cone out of each cupcake as you would cut the stem out of a strawberry. Reserve the cake.",
      "2. Fill cupcakes with about 1 tablespoon of ganache. Place in the freezer for 5 minutes to allow ganache to harden a bit.",
      "3. Place the leftover cake back in each cupcake.",
      "4. Use a 2-ounce trigger release ice-cream scoop to ice each cupcake. Fill the scoop completely and release.",
      "5. To garnish, sprinkle with shaved dark chocolate.",
      "6. Refrigerate cupcakes. Serve at room temperature. Eat and be merry!"
