      "Plain Truffles:",
      "For these, you simply sift 1 level dessertspoon of cocoa powder on to a flat plate, then take heaped half teaspoons of the first batch of truffle mixture and either dust each one straight away all over, which gives the truffle a rough, rock-like appearance, or dust your hands in cocoa and roll each piece into a ball and then roll it in the cocoa powder if you like a smoother look.

      "Spread some silicone paper on a flat surface and, dusting your hands with cocoa, roll each truffle into a little ball.",

I like a couple of drops of the red Tabasco, and a bit heavier on the green for more herbal notes. Also, for a more European flavour, a generous sprinkling of grated parmesan cheese at the table is divine."

      "Add the 5 cups flour, and mix until the dough is too stiff to mix by hand. Transfer to a lightly floured work surface (if using electric mixer, attach dough hook), and knead to form a soft, supple dough. Add a bit more flour as needed to prevent dough from getting too sticky.",
      "When the dough is smooth and elastic, place it in a lightly oiled bowl, and cover with a sheet of plastic wrap or with a plastic bag. If not using the dough immediately, refrigerate it after it has been kneaded. Bagel making can be resumed up to a day later. Allow the dough to return to room temperature, and continue with step 4.",
      "Let the dough rest about 20 minutes. Punch it down, and divide into 18 equal portions. Pour the water into a Dutch oven, along with the remaining 1/3 cup honey or malt syrup, and heat to boiling. Cover, reduce the heat, and allow to simmer while preparing the bagels.",
      "Shape the dough portions into bagels or doughnutlike rings by elongating each portion into an 8- to 10-inch coil that is 3/4 inch thick. Fold the ends over each other, pressing with the palm of one hand and rolling back and forth gently to seal. This locks the ends together and must be done properly or the bagels will open while being boiled. Let the bagels rest 15 minutes on a towel-lined baking sheet.",
      "Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Bring the water back to a boil and remove the lid. Have bowls of poppy seeds and sesame seeds nearby.",
      "When the water is boiling, use a slotted spoon, and add three bagels to the water. As they rise to the surface, turn them over, and let them boil an additional minute before removing them and quickly dipping them in either bowl of the seeds. Continue boiling the bagels in batches of three until all have been boiled and seeded.",
      "Arrange the boiled bagels on a baking sheet covered with parchment paper or cornmeal, and bake on the lowest rack of oven until they are medium brown, approximately 20-25 minutes. Remove from the oven. Once cooled, the bagels can be placed in a plastic bag, sealed and frozen."

      "For the Dough: Adjust oven rack to medium-low position and heat oven to 200 degrees. When oven reaches 200 degrees, turn it off. Butter Bundt pan with 2 tablespoons softened butter. Set aside.",
      "In large measuring cup, mix together milk, water, melted butter, sugar, and yeast. Mix flour and salt in standing mixer fitted with dough hook, (see below for making Monkey Bread without a mixer). Turn machine to low and slowly add milk mixture. After dough comes together, increase speed to medium and mix until dough is shiny and smooth, 6 to 7 minutes. Turn dough onto lightly floured counter and knead briefly to form smooth, round ball. Coat large bowl with nonstick cooking spray. Place dough in bowl and coat surface of dough with cooking spray. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and place in warm oven until dough doubles in size, 50 to 60 minutes.",
      "For the Sugar Coating: While dough is rising, mix brown sugar and cinnamon together in bowl. Place melted butter in second bowl. Set aside.",
      "To Form the Bread: Gently remove dough from bowl, and pat into rough 8-inch square. Using bench scraper or knife, cut dough into 64 pieces.",
      "Roll each dough piece into a ball. Working one at a time, dip balls in melted butter, allowing excess butter to drip back into bowl. Roll in brown sugar mixture, then layer balls in Bundt pan, staggering seams where dough balls meet as you build layers.",
      "Cover Bundt pan tightly with plastic wrap and place in turned-off oven until dough balls are puffy and have risen 1 to 2 inches from top of pan, 50 to 70 minutes.",
      "Remove pan from oven and heat oven to 350 degrees. Unwrap pan and bake until top is deep brown and caramel begins to bubble around edges, 30 to 35 minutes. Cool in pan for 5 minutes, then turn out on platter and allow to cool slightly, about 10 minutes.",
      "For the glaze: While bread cools, whisk confectioners' sugar and milk in small bowl until lumps are gone. Using whisk, drizzle glaze over warm monkey bread, letting it run over top and sides of bread. Serve warm.",
      "Monkey Bread Without a Mixer: In step 2, mix flour and salt in large bowl. Make well in flour, then add milk mixture to well. Using wooden spoon, stir until dough becomes shaggy and is difficult to stir. Turn out onto lightly floured work surface and begin to knead, incorporating shaggy scraps back into dough. Knead until dough is smooth and satiny, about 10 minutes. Shape into taut ball and proceed as directed."

Blend the confectioner's sugar, butter and vanilla in the bowl of a food processor until smooth, 5-8 minutes. Stir the cooled chocolate into the butter and sugar mixture until smooth.",

      "Pre-heat the water bath to 148\u00b0F. Mix all ingredients except the chicken in a large bowl making sure the sugar dissolved into the mixture. You will need a large plastic cooking bag that is large enough to hold the whole chicken and all the liquid. Also since we are going to cook the chicken in the soy sauce liquid mixture, it works best if you have a chamber vacuum sealer. If you only have a bar sealer, you might have to seal it twice to get a good seal since some of the liquid will probably get caught in the seal area. Drape the bag over the counter edge when you're sealing (for a bar sealer).",
      "Place the whole chicken in the bag neck first so the cavity hole is exposed. Pour the soy sauce mixture into the bag, making sure you fill the cavity. Carefully place the bag in the chamber vacuum and seal the bag. Set the vacuum seal pressure to a low setting. Some of the liquid may come out as the bag is sealed. Just wipe the bag off around the seal area and re-seal a second time if necessary to get a complete seal. The chicken should be immersed in the soy sauce mixture within the bag. Place the bag in the water bath. Cook for 5 hours. This ensures the whole chicken gets cooked.",
      "Once the chicken is done, remove from the water bath and let stand in the bag for 10 minutes. Get out a large cutting board and a heavy meat clever. This will be used to cut the chicken up into small pieces with the bone in, a traditional method of presenting soy sauce chicken. Also this dish is normally served at room temperature or even cold. Take the chicken out of the bag. Reserve some of the liquid for sauce. Separate the legs and wings from the body at the joints. Using your clever, CAREFULLY chop the legs and wings into small pieces, chopping right through the bones. BE CAREFUL! Now separate the breasts from the backbone part of the chicken by slicing horizontally from the bottom of the chicken to the neck area. You can then separate the breasts by cutting down through the breast bone. Again, carefully use your clever to cut the breasts into small pieces.",
      "For plating, place the dark meat on a large plate and then place the breast meat on top. Garnish with scallions and server!"
