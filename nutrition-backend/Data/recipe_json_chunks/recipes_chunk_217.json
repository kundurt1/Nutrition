Add flour and wet ingredients alternately, beginning and ending with flour. Do not overmix this part, just mix enough to make sure each is incorporated. Pour into buttered and floured large Bundt pan. Place into cold oven; turn on to 300\u00b0 and bake for about 1 hour and 45 minutes. Do not open oven during the first 1 hour and 15 minutes after baking. You may check it after this time by gently opening the oven and placing a toothpick into the center. If clean when removed, the cake is done. Allow to cool about 10 minutes and extract from pan after cooling."
