Homemade ice cream is best served the day it's made, but it still tastes delicious for up to a month in the freezer (in an airtight plastic container). If you freeze for more than a day, you'll probably end up with a frozen block, so just be sure to thaw the ice cream for 15-20 minutes prior to serving."

      "Cook burgers meat over low to medium heat. Be sure to coat grill with non-stick spray. Cook about 8-10 minutes on each side. Keep in mind that turkey burger and turkey sausage will look different than beef or pork... and the sausage lends a reddish color, which can be mistaken for rare meat. Cook on the high end of 12 minutes if you want to be safe... though be careful not to cook too long or your burger will dry out. Try not to flip the burger too often as it tends to crumble. If the mozzarella starts to ooze out, don't worry... that's a sign that your burger is almost done.",

Don't let the sugar sit on top of the eggs without whisking, because the sugar will burn the eggs. It will also help to pasteurize the eggs, melt the sugar, and ensure the yolks are whipped really well later on. Making sure the egg yolks don't get overcooked in the water bath is really the only tricky part of this recipe. Make sure the water in the 3.0-Quart Low Casserole is simmering and never touching the bowl of your Stand Mixer!",

      "Make the coconut milk. Use a vegetable peeler to remove the brown skin from all the coconut meat. Measure the coconut water collected from your coconuts and add enough water to create 3 total cups (700ml) of liquid. Add both the coconut meat and the liquid to a saucepan and bring to a simmer on medium heat. Allow to simmer for three minutes, then turn off heat. Allow to cool slightly.",
      "Scoop half of the coconut meat from the saucepan and add it to your KitchenAid(R) K400 Blender along with half of the warm liquid. Turn blender to \"Ice Crush\" setting and let the cycle run through. Add the remaining coconut meat and warm liquid to the blender, and blend again on \"Ice Crush\" setting until cycle runs through. Finally, set the blender to the \"Icy Drink\" setting and let the cycle run through.",
      "Lay a large piece of cheesecloth into a big bowl and pour half of the coconut mixture from the blender in the middle of the cheesecloth. Using clean hands, gather the ends of the cheesecloth and squeeze the coconut pulp to release as much milk as possible into the bowl. Place pulp into a bowl and discard cheesecloth; repeat with second cheesecloth and remaining coconut mixture. (See Chef's Notes about using leftover pulp - or, discard the pulp.)",
      "Make the popsicles. Add the coconut milk, 2 tablespoons (42g) agave syrup, and 3/4 teaspoon (3g) vanilla extract to the blender. Blend on speed 2 for 10 seconds. Carefully pour the sweetened coconut milk into the bottom 2/3 of each popsicle mold. Place the popsicles in the freezer without the sticks for 10 min.",
      "In a small bowl with a spout, mix together the blood orange juice, pomegranate juice, and remaining agave and vanilla. Quickly whisk, then pour the juice mixture over the coconut milk layer in the popsicle molds. Place the lids on the popsicle molds and insert the sticks. Freeze for at least 4 hours.",
      "CHEF'S NOTES: Using mature coconuts can be daunting at first, but don't be shy. First, to pick a good mature coconut, shake it and you should hear water inside. (If there is no water sound, the coconut is rotten.) Next, find the \"eyes\" of the coconut and puncture the most tender of the three \"eyes\" with an icepick or wine opener to create a hole. Drain the coconut water from the coconut into a bowl. Once the water is fully drained, hold a hammer in one hand and the coconut in the other, and carefully begin tapping along the centerline of the coconut, turning the coconut slightly after each tap. Do this until the coconut cracks in half. (You can also do this by placing the coconut on a hard surface.) Finally, to take the flesh from the shell, insert the tip of a knife between the meat and the shell and twist to lift the meat. (If the coconut isn't completely dry, it will be harder to remove. So, just slice the meat into small sections in the shell, and then remove in smaller sections.)",
      "Heating the coconut and water together yields a richer, creamier milk - so don't skip this step! The more coconut water you use, the creamier the popsicle; the more water, the more sorbet like the end result will be.",
      "NOTE ON LEFTOVER COCONUT PULP. Your KitchenAid(R) K400 easily turns coconut pulp into highly-prized coconut flour. First, preheat the oven to 120 degrees and spread the coconut pulp out on a sheet pan. Bake the pulp for 30-40 minutes, or until dry to the touch. (You'll want to shake the pan occasionally while baking and turn the pulp to aerate it.) Remove from the oven and, once cool, add the pulp to your blender and blend on speed 5 until pulp is the consistency of flour. Store in an airtight container."

Make sure you end with your bechamel topping and sprinkle the top with some parmesan cheese or any you have at home. \n\nPut your lasagna to bake in the oven for about 35 minutes. Make sure you do not burn the top. If you are afraid that might happen you can cover your lasagna for the first half with tin foil. \n\nI hope you enjoy this recipe."
