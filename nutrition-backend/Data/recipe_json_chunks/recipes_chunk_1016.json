Roll up as in a sandwich wrap and enjoy an extremely flavourful sandwich!",

Once I mix the Basic Choux Pastry Dough, I will go back to my Chocolate Eclair recipe and go from there -- that is where I will find an explanation for cooking and other directions.

Wow amazing. next time I will try a little chocolate, just curious about how great it will taste. until next time, happy cooking. Rob --",
      "I made the recipe exactly as written and it is really good but when the cream was chilled it was so firm that I was able to stand a spoon upright in it. I too will leave out the corn starch the next time I make it. I much prefer a softer cream.I too,Play with my Food."

      "Pour the can of white wine and chicken stock (good slosh) into a casserole pot. Add the tarragon, salt and pepper (I usually do about 20 twists) then as many grapes as you want. Usually the more you have, the better.",
      "Heat a frying pan and melt the butter, along with the chopped onion and celery. Cook until they're soft (2 minutes or so). Drain them using a metal spoon with holes before placing them into a large casserole pot.",
      "Next, put the flour in a glass dish and add the sausages and chicken.",
      "Make sure all sides of the meat are coated with flour, and the sausages have been pricked with a knife. The reason for doing this is so that they get sealed so wont lose their flavours when being cooked.",
      "Put them in the frying pan and you may need to add a little more olive oil. Fry them lightly, just so they are turning brown before transferring them to the casserole pot.",
      "Mix the meat with the juice in the pot just to spread it out, and place in an oven at 150oC for 2-3 hours. This will mean it can simmer and usually you will find the longer you leave it, the fruitier it will become as the grapes have had a chance to expel all their juices. You could turn up the temperature if in a hurry, and leave it in for an hour. The nice thing is, it is so versatile!",
      "Leave to stand afterwards for about 10 minutes, then serve either with rice or new potatos. Enjoy :)."
