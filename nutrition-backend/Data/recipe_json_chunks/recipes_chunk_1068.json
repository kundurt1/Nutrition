Once the bacon is crispy (but not burnt), remove it to a papertowel lined bowl/plate with a slotted spoon.",
      "Into the hot, delicious bacon fat add the carrots, celery, onion, swiss chard stalks, and bay leaves. Saute until vegetables soften, release liquid, and brown a bit (maybe up to 10 minutes or so?). The browning (but not burning) will develop additional flavor that will help to flavor your soup.",
      "Once the veggies have caramelized a bit, add the garlic, potatoes, and black pepper. Saute a few minutes until garlic is fragrant but not burnt.",
      "Add the swiss chard leaves, and stir well. The garlic and vegetable infused fat should evenly coat and cling to the contents on the pot. Add the chicken stock, enough to cover the veggies, cover the pot, and over a high flame bring to a boil, and reduce heat to simmer.",
      "Keep the soup at a bare simmer for 30 - 45 minutes or so, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are done to your liking. Taste and adjust the salt and black pepper. At this point, you can enjoy the soup as is, or you can use an immersion blender (or the tool of your choice) to further meld the flavors.",

Also transfer to the saucepan.",

Fry the mushroom slices in a little more butter, just turning in the pan for a minute or two; keep to one side.",
      "Place the saucepan on medium heat, stirring in the flour, and allow it to cook for 2 to 3 minutes. Add the tomato puree, bay leaf and mushrooms. Pour in the stock and bring to a simmer, skimming off any impurities. The meat should just be covered with the stock; if not, top with a little more stock or water. Simmer gently, partially covered, for 1 1/2 to 2 hours. During the cooking time it may need to be skimmed several times.",
      "After 1 1/2 hours, check the meat for tenderness. If not quite soft enough, cook for the additional 30 minutes. If the meat is cooking gently, it will not need to be topped up with any additional stock or water. The sauce will have reduced, thickening it's consistency and increasing it's flavour.",

Brush the rim of the pie dish with some beaten egg and apply the strip. Brush again with egg. Making sure the pastry top is bigger than the dish, sit it on top. Push down around the sides, trim and crimp for a neat finish. Brush completely with egg wash and place in the preheated oven. Bake for 30 to 40 minutes until golden brown."

      "Check the percentage of alc/vol printed on the bottle; there are many different strengths offered.",
      "(By law, commercially sold pure vanilla extract must contain a minimum of 35% alcohol by volume).",
      "Cut the vanilla beans into small pieces and drop into a bottle of vodka (pour a little vodka out first, as the vanilla beans will cause some displacement).",
      "That's it!",
      "Now you just have to wait for it to steep.",
      "I'll tell you why I cut up the beans, rather than leaving them whole.",
      "The power of the infusion comes from keeping the essential matter (in this case vanilla, which provides the 'essence') submerged in the liquid (in this case, vodka).",
      "Vanilla beans are long and thin, and will stand up vertically in the bottle.",
      "If you are making a small amount (less than a full bottle) the vodka level may not cover all the beans.",
      "Even when using a full bottle of vodka, little by little this will be poured off as you use the extract, meaning the upper part of the (uncut) beans will quickly become exposed to the air.",
      "The longer the beans steep totally submerged the stronger the flavor of the extract.",
      "That is why I wrote that I pour off only a small amount at a time (enough to fill a 100 ml bottle- less than 4 ounces) and keep this on my spice shelf for regular use.",
      "The remainder I leave in the vodka bottle to further infuse with flavor.",
      "By cutting up the vanilla beans, the pieces will sink to the bottom of the bottle so even as I pour off the extract and the vodka level drops, the remainder continues to infuse as all of the vanilla bean pieces are submerged, and the extract continues to develop flavor.",
      "Aside from this, cutting open the seed pods gives greater access (maximum contact) to the flavor cells.",
      "Remember, you will need to filter the extract if the pods were cut--the seeds are very tiny (like ground poppy) so I recommend straining through something very fine, like coffee filter paper.",
      "Okay, so now it has to steep for a couple of months.",
      "It will get darker and darker over time; strain before using.",
      "I strain and transfer a small amount into a small bottle for everyday use (allowing the original batch in the vodka bottle to further intensify in flavor).",
      "Here's the fun part: the same vanilla beans may be reused to make more essence!",
      "When the liter is all used up, I refill the vodka 50% of the original (using 500 cc or 1/2 liter of vodka) for the second infusion.",
      "When that is used up I may go for a 3rd infusion, using 50% of the previous (this time 250 cc or 1/4 liter of vodka)-- as long as the color comes through the flavor will too.",
      "You really cannot imagine how much flavor these beans contain!",
      "I remember when I first read about doing a 2nd or 3rd infusion (using the same beans) I was skeptical, thinking that this was stretching things too far-- but when I tried it, I found that it really works!",
      "As long as you see the color come through, the flavor will also be there.",
      "As I explained, I cut the vodka in half for each successive infusion, compensating for depleted flavor by raising the concentration factor.",
      "I have been making all my own vanilla extract for years using this method with excellent results.",

Since posting this recipe, having not used this recipe for a while, I made this mousse and for the first time added black cherries. The mousse still tasted delicious, but the cherries being a lot heavier than strawberries sunk to the bottom - not a major problem; I still made sure that the mousse and cherries were evenly distributed between the parfait glasses. But because the cherries had a lot more moisture in them than do strawberries, the consistency of the mousse was not as thick as I should have liked. So I have amended the total quantity of liquid to 11/2-13/4 cups Originally, I had specified TWO cups of liquid. It's probably better to err on the side of adding a little less liquid - but it really does depend a lot on what fruit you are adding."

      "Remove sugar syrup from heat at 250\u00b0F (120\u00b0C), then gently stir in the gelatin mixture until well combined. With the kitchen mixer on highest speed, continue to whip the egg whites while carefully pouring in the hot sugar syrup. Continue to whip until mixture thickens and increases in volume, whilst also remaining pourable. Mix in food color (I used pink) until a desired shade is achieved.",
      "Working quickly, transfer into 1 large piping bag and use scissors to snip 2cm off the end. Quickly pipe the marshmallow into all silicone cells, until level. Place into refrigerator for at least 1 hour or until completely set.",

      "Tip: Store leftover marshmallows in an air-tight container in the fridge for up to 7 days. You can freeze marshmallows in an air-tight container for up to 1 month.",
      "Tip: You can also flavor your marshmallow with fruit puree or natural flavoring extracts.",
      "For the Cream Cheese Frosting:",
      "You will need: 1 piping bag.",

      "Use a long, thin knife to divide your cake horizontally into 3 layers.",
      "Place a dollop of cream cheese frosting onto a cake board or large serving plate and place the bottom layer of cake on top (this should prevent your cake from sliding around!). Use an offset spatula to apply a layer of cream cheese on top.",
