Also you should fill a heat safe bowl (one that's big enough to fit your pot into) with ice. Place the sheet of parchment onto your work surface. It is a good idea to set up your area prior to turning on the stove top because when the candy reaches the hard crack stage, you won't have time to doddle!",
      "With your thermometer attached to a medium sized pot, bring the sugar, corn syrup and water to a boil. Once it reaches hard crack stage (as noted on your candy thermometer), stir in the flavoring and remove from heat. Dip the pot in the ice water bath to stop the cooking then quickly (and carefully) pour small circles of the liquid onto your parchment paper. There are more detailed picture of this process on my site. Decorate by dropping food colors into the hot liquid and swirling with a toothpick. Quickly add the sticks and voila. Beautiful ... and tasty!"

I try not to touch the front of the letters much, so as to avoid fingerprints on the final product. I find it's pretty easy to peel the letter off the wax paper just like a sticker, and pick it up by its back with just one finger. You could also use tweezers or a butter knife if you want to be a bit more precise.",

Bake for 15-18 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in center of several muffins comes out clean. Watch the muffins carefully during the baking process. Do not overcook them because it will result in dry, tough muffins. Suggestion: Every oven bakes differently. Check muffins at the 14-minute mark. If the toothpick comes out very wet with batter, bake muffins for an additional 2 minutes and re-check. However, if the muffins test only a little bit wet, bake for an additional 1 minute and re-check.",

      "1. Chopped dates can be bought in packages in the baking aisle. However, I recommend using fresh dates when possible, particularly the Medjool variety. Medjools are fat and sweet. Be sure to remove the large seed before attempting to chop the dates.",
      "2. To toast the pecans, place chopped pecans in a small baking pan or on a small baking sheet. Put them in preheated 400\u00b0F oven for about 5 minutes until fragrant and lightly golden. Allow to cool while preparing muffin batter.",
      "3. Rewarm finished muffin in microwave for about 10 seconds. These muffins are outstanding when rewarmed.",

I would advise piping though as it's much easier!",
      "Place doughnuts in the oven for 8-10 minutes, until well risen and an inserted skewer comes out clean. Remove from oven. Leave them in the pan for 5 minutes, before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.

      "Once all the doughnuts are completely cool, make the frosting: Place all frosting ingredients into a large bowl and beat on medium-high speed until light and smooth, about 1 minute.",
      "Using a small angled spatula, or spoon, spread frosting over the top of each doughnut before adding whichever sprinkles/decorations you desire.",
      "Frosted doughnuts will keep in an airtight container, in the fridge for 2 days. Un-frosted doughnuts can be frozen for a month."

It should now look like a long roll folded in thirds. Brush with additional egg wash, if desired, to seal dough. Gently maneuver the cake on to a well-greased or parchment-lined baking sheet forming a circle. As you move the cake to your baking sheet, carefully flip it over so that the seam side is down. Pinch the ends together to form a circle. You can squeeze and form your dough ring to manipulate it into a more even circle. Cover, and let it rest for 30 minutes. Brush with remaining egg wash, and bake for 25-35 minutes. The cake should have risen and be a golden brown. Cool.",

For those reasons, I had to settle for two layers and increase the baking time. Unfortunately, this made the cakes turn out a little more dense than they should be. If you have three 9\" cake pans, please do use them because it makes the cakes come out extremely light and fluffy. Either way, it still tastes great.",

      "This pie is a family recipe, but we aren't secretive about it. In fact, my mother sent it in and had it published in Taste of Home years ago. We are, however, secretive about our pie CRUST recipe and process, so I won't be giving you that!",
      "In a saucepan, combine chocolate and butter. Melt over low heat. Remove from the heat and blend in the milk; set aside. In a mixing bowl, combine sugar, cornstarch and salt. Beat in eggs and vanilla. Blend in melted chocolate; pour into the pie shell. Combine coconut and pecans; sprinkle on top of the pie. Bake at 375 degrees F for 45 minutes.",
      "Hints from a third-generation maker of this pie:",
      "Of course, you can also do the melting the chocolate and butter step in the microwave, just be careful not to burn the chocolate.",
      "Make sure your pie shell is deep enough. This is a large recipe and definitely needs a nice deep 9\" crust to hold all the liquid without spilling over the sides.",
      "I put my pie pan on a sturdy cookie sheet before pouring in the filling. I think it makes it easier to handle since the filling is basically liquid when you pour it in and it contains any drips over the edge. (But you shouldn't have any drips if your pie crust is big enough!)",
      "If you don't have German sweet chocolate, you can use semisweet chips (you'll have to weigh them out) or unsweetened bricks (it takes 4). I used unsweetened because it's what I had on hand AND because I think it gives it a much chocolatey flavor, not as sweet. My family and I love it when it's sickeningly sweet, but I knew most people wouldn't care for it that sweet.",
      "When you take the pie out, there will be some burnt pecans on top; that's normal. I usually just brush them off and stir the coconut on top around so it looks less burnt. It doesn't taste burnt but it can look quite ... blackened.",
      "It can be hard to tell when this pie is done. When you take it out, it should be wiggly but NOT liquid. Press down on the coconut layer. If waves ripple out from the center, it is not done. If it's kind of springy like firm jello, then it's done."

Peel the inedible brown layers back towards the root end and use that as a handle. Make little vertical slices and then chop crosswise. Chop up the celery, carrots, and garlic/shallot however you prefer. Sometimes I do rings, sometimes I do little quarter pieces.",

      "8. Add the oxtails back in at this point, and don't forget the tasty juices that have accumulated on the plate, too.",

      "10. Make a little cheesecloth package with the bay leaf and the peppercorns. In it goes.",
      "11. Let the soup come to a boil, then lower to a rumbling simmer. At this point, we wait. This soup takes a super-long time, because oxtails are not exactly fork-tender right out the gate. It usually takes 2-3 hours plus for them to cook to the consistency we are going for.",
      "12. Once they are all gooey and fork tender and reminiscent of pot roast, remove the oxtails. Pick the meat, discard the bones, chop the meat and return it to the soup.",
      "13. Now it's time to add the leeks. Cut off the root ends and the green parts of the stalks. You want the 2 or so inches of white stuff. (If you're enterprising, the green tops are great to freeze for later use in a vegetable stock.) Julienne the white portion and then really rinse them. They love to hide mud and sand in their layers, so don't be shy. That's why I wait until they are chopped to bother rinsing, by the way. Then add them to the soup and let the soup simmer for another 30 minutes.",
      "14. Remove the pot to the fridge overnight so you can skim the impressive layer of fat that develops.",
      "15. Reheat and serve.",

      "Arrange the split peas in a large slow cooker in an even layer. Top with the carrots, celery, onion, garlic and herbs. If you want, you can tie the herbs in a bundle with cooking string. This way they will be easier to fish out later. Layer the turkey bacon on top of the vegetables.",

      "To freeze:",
      "This soup freezes very well. To freeze, I ladled the soup into muffin tins and froze them until they were solid. Then, I quickly dunked the bottom of the muffin tin in hot water and pried out the soup cup with a butter knife. Then, I just threw them all in a freezer bag and I'll have nice serving sizes of soup all winter long! This technique works well for other types of soups and sauces too. Two or three \"pucks\" heat up nicely in a coffee mug or bowl for a quick meal."

If you cook the vermicelli in the soup they continue to soak up the broth after they are done, so they become mushy and you're left with no broth.

Add the cubed butter and pulse it again until the mixture is pebbly. In a separate bowl, add the warm water. Pour the yeast into the water and let it dissolve, then gently stir in the evaporated milk. Then add the yeasty mixture into the food processor along with the eggs. Run the processor just until you have a sticky, uniform dough. Transfer the dough to a large bowl, cover it lightly with plastic wrap and let it sit in the refrigerator overnight.",
      "2. The next day, make the filling first. In a bowl, combine the walnuts, butter, sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, honey and rose water. Stir it together thoroughly to finish the easy and yummy filling! Set it aside. Then, preheat the oven to 325 F and line four sheet trays with silicone mats or parchment paper. Take the dough out of the refrigerator.",
      "3. Divide the dough into four equal pieces. Take the first piece and lightly coat it in flour, then pat it out into a disc on a clean, well floured surface. Roll the disc out with a floured rolling pin until it is about 1/4 inch thick. Using a 3.5 inch round cutter, cut out rounds from the dough. You should get about 9. Then gently form the scraps into a smooth disc and roll it out again to cut out another 3 discs.",
      "4. Add a scant tablespoon of filling on one half of each disc, then seal them by bringing the other half over and thoroughly crimping the edges together. Form pretty tine marks on the edges by pressing a fork along the edges of each pastry. Transfer the dozen pastries onto one of the prepared trays, and repeat the process with the other three quarters of dough.",
      "5. Once all 4 trays are full, bake them in two batches for 20 minutes each until they are puffy and golden. Take them out when they are done and sprinkle them generously with powdered sugar while they are still a little warm. Let them finish cooling on cooling racks before you seal them up in pretty tins. Have fun spreading the holiday cheer!"

      "For the dough:",
      "1. In a small saucepan, add the milk and butter. Gently warm over medium low heat until the butter is melted and your mixture reaches 120-130\u00b0F. You want the mixture to be warm but not hot. Definitely not simmering or boiling. If it's too warm, allow it to cool to 120-130\u00b0F.",
      "2. While that is warming, sift together the flour, sugar and salt in a medium sized bowl. Set aside.",
      "3. Into the bowl of a stand mixer bowl, add the warm milk mixture and the active dry yeast. Mix together well with a spatula or your fingers. Allow this to sit for 1-2 minutes. Next, add the flour mixture and egg and beat with the dough hook attachment on medium to medium-low speed until combined. If you notice your dough is sticking to the bowl, you can add additional flour in small increments, but not exceeding 1/2 cup more flour. I added another 1/4 cup. Allow the dough to form into a ball and pull away from the sides of the bowl. Continue to \"knead\" the dough on medium-low speed for 5 minutes.",
      "4. Once dough has kneaded, remove from mixer, remove dough hook, pick up the dough with your hands and form into a ball. Place it back into your bowl, cover with a tea towel, and set in a warm part of your kitchen to rest and proof until doubled in size, about 40-45 minutes.",
      "For the cranberry filling:",
      "1. While your dough is resting and proofing, mix together the cinnamon, brown sugar and vanilla sugar in a bowl. Set aside.",
      "2. In a food processor (or you can do this by hand with a knife as well) add the fresh cranberries. Pulse until they are very finely chopped but not pureed. Place into a separate bowl and set aside.",
      "To make the rolls:",
      "1. When the dough has proofed and doubled in size, remove it from the bowl and place onto a lightly floured surface. Roll out dough into a rectangle that measures approximately 14x20\".",
      "2. Next, take your softened stick of butter and spread it evenly all over the surface of the dough, leaving a 1/4-1/2\" border of unbuttered dough along one side of the 20\" side.",
      "3. Sprinkle the cinnamon sugar all over the buttered surface and smooth it out evenly with your hands.",
      "4. Finally, sprinkle the finely chopped cranberries over the cinnamon sugar so it's a nice even layer. Be careful not to get any of the cranberry liquid that might have accumulated while sitting.",
      "5. Beginning with the 20\" side that doesn't have the 1/4-1/2\" of blank dough, tightly roll dough over itself and continue until you reach the unbuttered side of the dough. Pinch the end of that unbuttered dough into the roll sealing and closing up the entire thing. Turn roll so that it is seam side down.",
      "6. Using a sharp serrated knife, cut the roll into 1 1/4\" wide slices. I got about 14 good slices out of it.",
      "7. Lightly grease a 9x13\" baking pan, two 9\" cake pans, or whatever you're wanting to bake these babies in. Place the cut slices into that greased pan with a little space in between. They will rise and puff so you'll want to give them room to do so.",
      "8. Cover pan(s) again with your tea towel and allow to rest and proof one more time in a warm part of your kitchen. You're looking for them to have swelled and puffed, about 30 minutes.",
      "9. Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F and make sure your racks are in the center of your oven.",
      "10. Once rolls have proofed the second time, place into the preheated oven and bake for 30 minutes or until rolls are golden brown and cooked all the way through. Make the icing while they bake. Remove from oven when done.",
      "For the brown butter icing:",
      "1. While the rolls are baking, melt and brown the butter. Do this in a small saucepan over medium heat. Stir regularly and heat until the butter turns golden brown and starts to smell nutty.",
      "2. In a medium sized bowl whisk together the browned butter, powdered sugar and milk until a thick but slightly pourable icing forms. You may need to add a touch more milk to achieve this. You're wanting the icing to resemble the texture of a cream cheese frosting.",
      "3. Once the rolls are baked, remove them from the oven and allow them to rest 5 minutes before generously spreading the top with your brown butter icing!",

Let the potato mixture rest for 10 minutes over the bowl. The potato starch will settle to the bottom; reserve that after you have carefully poured off the water.",

      "While the steak is resting, preheat oven to 300 F and place the potato pancakes on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Heat the pancakes for about 2-5 minutes. You just want them to warm up. They will also crisp up a tad more.",
      "For the fried eggs: In a large skillet over medium-high heat add half of the butter and let it melt. Add about 3 eggs at a time and cook for about 2 minutes then flip and cook for 1 minute more or until the whites are set. I made my eggs in 3 batches. Remove cooked eggs to a plate and cook the rest.

Both the eggs and the milk are sourced right from my backyard, and therefore I feel absolutely comfortable with both the health of the animals involved and the handling of the milk and eggs. I am not, however saying that you should partake of these items. Please use your own judgement and do your own research when it comes to consuming raw ingredients. If you have concerns or a weakened immune system, it is probably best for you to use pasteurized ingredients or to look for a cooked eggnog recipe. It won't hurt my feelings. Promise!",
      "2. The eggnog does separate some as it sits, with the fluffy meringue rising to the top, but just give it a little stir and you're back in business!",
      "3. If you want your eggnog less foamy, just don't add all of the whites!"

As soon as you take them out of the oven, sprinkle them with a bit of kosher salt (do not be heavy handed with this, we want just little bites of saltiness). Let cookies cool for 10 minutes, then move to a cooling rack until completely cool (or eat them warm!). Repeat baking the remaining cookies. Enjoy!",

      "2. Do not proceed immediately after browning the butter, as the hot butter will scramble the eggs in your cookie dough, which is no bueno. Also, don't put the browned butter immediately from the saute pan to the bowl of the stand mixer, because the stand mixer will keep the butter hot forever.",

I came across this little cheesecake recipe in a Martha magazine and decided to try it with Girl Scout Peanut Butter Sandwiches, Thin Mints and regular Oreos. I just split up the batter and added a drop of mint extract to the Thin Mints cakes, a couple of crushed Oreos to another and a small drop of peanut butter to the Peanut Butter cookie cakes. Just swirl in the the rest of the batter. I imagine you could probably use any cookie. I even halved the recipe and it worked out fine. They were very cute, very good, and very easy!",

Next add your sour cream and salt - scraping down sides as needed.",

      "Cover the mixer bowl with a kitchen towel and let dough rise for one hour.",

      "Then, loop each rope into a circle, really twisting the ends together to make sure that they are nice and secure. Repeat with all the pieces of dough, and place onto the cornmeal covered baking sheet. Cover with a kitchen towel and let rest until they rise slightly, about 10-15 minutes.",
      "While the dough rests bring a 4 1/2 liter pot of water to a boil. Add in the remaining 1/4 of the honey and then cover and turn the heat down to keep your water at a low boil. Preheat your oven to 450 F and line a separate baking sheet with parchment paper",
      "Once the bagels have risen, gently place 2-3 at time into the water. Cook for 50 seconds and gently flip and cook for an additional 50 seconds. Using a slotted spoon, pick up the bagels. and drain any of the water off. Transfer to the parchment lined baking sheet. Repeat with remaining bagels.",

      "1. A slightly easier way to form the bagels is to roll into balls and use your thumbs to press a hole out of the middle, and gentle form the hole bigger. However, this tends to lead to flatter bagels.",
      "2. The cinnamon sugar topping does go soft if left at room temperature so bagels are best left at room temperature for only 2-3 days, and toasted before eating. Alternatively, you can freeze them for up to 3 months."

Heat it over medium high heat and let it gently boil while you stir it occasionally. It needs to boil until it turns a beautiful, deep amber color. When it does, take it off the heat and carefully pour in the milk. It will make the caramel really bubble up. Then stir in the butter, vanilla and salt. Put the pot back on the heat and let it bubble while you stir. Continue until it is completely melded and smooth for about a minute. Set the sauce aside.",

You won't need all of the sauce. The recipe yields a good amount. Seal the rest in a container and refrigerate it for other yummy uses! It will keep for weeks if refrigerated. Then just cut the cookie into the desired size wedges and serve! This is the perfect fall dessert."

      "3. In a medium bowl that's totally free of any grease, beat egg whites until stiff. Set aside.",
      "4. In a large bowl, lightly beat the egg yolks. Add sugar and beat until thick and lemon-coloured.",

      "Swiss rolls are sponge cakes that are rolled in a tea towel when they first come out of the oven. Then they are unrolled and filled with anything from lemon curd, pastry cream, jam, or in this case, whipped cream. There is a tablespoon of matcha in this cake, but if you want to bump up the green tea flavour even more, you can add one or two teaspoons of matcha to the whipped cream as well."

In a small mixing bowl, add the garlic, oyster sauce, soy sauce, fish sauce, sugar, and cracked black pepper and mix until everything is incorporated. Add this to the zip-lock bag, seal, and toss the beef in the marinade, gently massaging along the way. Place in the refrigerator for 4 hours or up to overnight.",
      "Next, make the dressing. Into a small mixing bowl, add the dressing ingredients, and mix to dissolve the sugar. Seal and place in the refrigerator until you are ready to make the salad.",
      "When the beef is done marinating, remove it from the fridge and let it come up to room temperature, or at least long enough to take the chill off.",
      "Heat a large wok or skillet on medium-high heat. Let this heat up for a few minutes, then add the canola oil. Let the oil heat up for about a minute, then add the beef in a single layer but make sure not to crowd it. You can do this in batches if you prefer.",
      "Keep shaking the skillet back and forth to move the beef. Let it get a nice sear on all sides then cook to your desired done-ness. I tend to go medium on my beef. Once cooked, remove the beef onto a plate. Repeat if necessary.",
      "Into another bowl, add the watercress. Add about 5 tablespoons of the dressing onto the watercress, and give it a gentle toss.",
      "Add the watercress onto your serving dishes. Place the beef on top of the watercress, and add the tomatoes and peanuts. Add more dressing to taste. I like to add some of the remaining shallots from the dressing on top of the beef.",
      "The result is truly a great salad. The presentation is so inviting and the flavors are perfectly balanced. It's nice and sweet. Plus a bit bitter from the watercress. And then you get the awesome Asian flavors from the beef marinade. My wife and I devoured this salad and we both agreed that it would be a hit at any dinner table. Hope you enjoy!"

Fill cupcakes by removing a small piece in the middle of the cupcake then filling the hole with about 1 - 1 1/2 teaspoons of the raspberry filling. Trim the piece you cut out and place it back over the filling in the cupcake. You can also pipe the filling into the cupcake. However, this filling is pretty thick, so it is more difficult.",

My favourite, as you could probably guess from the title of this post, was the Matcha White Hot Chocolate. The last time Rafael and I visited Chococrepe, they were completely out of the Matcha White Hot Chocolate! I sulked during our meal.

      "Many years ago while scanning the Campbell's soup aisle in the grocery store I saw the golden mushroom soup. Having never tried it I thought it might go well baked with some chicken. As a newlywed I was always trying to create and tweak new recipes. The chicken came out great and I have been a fan of this canned soup ever since. I just add some additional ingredients to make it a bit more hearty. It's one of our favorite soups."

To make the mixture into a salsa, add some minced jalapeno, garlic, and scallion, and stir in a bit of oil, lime juice, salt, and pepper. Feel free to grill the corn and red pepper, if you live in a warmer climate or discover this recipe when corn on the cob is in season.",

Reduce heat to a simmer and cook for about two hours (I've gone as little as an hour and as long as three).",

This recipe doesn't have a lot of sugar in it so you really need the natural sweetener that the bananas provide. Add the oil, yogurt, eggs, milk, vanilla and brown sugar and mix to combine. A whisk works great here but a fork is just fine. Just check that you don't have any big banana lumps hiding in there.",

      "1. Lightly spray a glass or metal 8\"x8\" baking dish with baking spray and line the bottom and two sides with parchment paper. I did this by cutting a very long piece of parchment and pressing it onto the bottom and up the two sides. Allow a few inches to hang over the sides, as these will be your handles for lifting the finished fudge. Set aside.",
      "2. In a medium non-reactive sauce pot or Dutch oven over low heat, stir together the candy corn and sweetened condensed milk. Stir frequently, until candy corn is completely melted, making sure not to boil or simmer mixture. Make sure to stir so that nothing sticks to the bottom. This might take a little while.",
      "3. Once the candy corn is completely melted, add the peanut butter chips and coconut oil and stir continuously until peanut butter chips are melted. This will go a lot faster.",
      "4. When peanut butter chips are melted, turn heat off and add the white chocolate chips. Stir again until completely combined and melted.",
      "5. Carefully pour mixture into your prepared baking dish and smooth the surface. Tap dish on the counter a few times to release any air bubbles that may have collected.",
      "6. Allow fudge to cool on the counter for 15-20 minutes and then place dish in the refrigerator to cool completely. This will take a few hours. Your fudge will also firm up significantly!",
      "7. Once completely cool, remove dish from fridge and carefully pull the fudge out of the pan using the parchment paper handles. Place fudge upside down on a cutting board and remove the parchment paper.",
      "8. With a very large knife, cut fudge into whatever sized squares you desire! I suggest cutting the squares on the small side, as the fudge is rich. I cut mine into 3/4-1\" squares and got over 100 pieces! This was more than enough for Bill and I to gorge on and pack up and gift away to loved ones!",
      "Notes:",
      "1. Optional: You can easily melt some semi-sweet chocolate and dip a side of of each fudge square in it, or drizzle chocolate over top. This will really make it Butterfinger-like. I did that last year and thought the chocolate was a bit much for my liking. So this year, I opted to leave them naked. Super duper yummy!",
      "2. Fudge will store for 5 days at room temperature in an airtight container. For longer storage, place the airtight container in the fridge. Allow pieces to come to room temperature before eating.",

      "Notes:",
      "1. Stir in a circular motion instead of back and forth motion. A back and forth motion creates lots of air bubbles which will prevent the surface of the egg custard from being smooth. If it does end up = having a lot of bubbles, use a small spoon to scoop out the bubbles, or set aside and wait for a few minutes for the bubbles to go away.",
      "2. Add salt just before cooking the eggs.",
      "3. Cover the container while steaming. Condensed water vapor on the steamer lid will drip down into the bowl. If there is no cover on the bowl, the water will make the surface of the egg custard uneven and look like honeycomb.",
      "4. Add 2 more minutes of steaming for each additional egg. If you steam too long, the egg will be overcooked and tough."

      "1. Butter a 9x13 inch dish and a medium, heavy saucepan. If you have a cast iron sauce pan, use it.",

      "3. In a large heavy skillet over medium heat, pour the remaining 2 cups sugar. (Again, if you have cast iron and wooden spoons, use them. Do NOT use a plastic spoon - trust me on this one.)",

      "Continue to cook and stir the sugar in the skillet until it is completely melted and light brown. Do not overcook this.",
      "5. Once the sugar in the skillet is melted, pour it very slowly, in a thin stream, into the lightly simmering cream mixture, stirring constantly. This step may take five minutes, and works best if someone strong pours the melted sugar very slowly. Please don't rush this step. Note that the melted sugar will harden a bit upon hitting the cream/sugar mixture. Don't worry about this. It's normal.",
      "6. Now that everything named sugar or cream is in the same pan, heat it without stirring (yeah!), to 242 to 248 degrees F (116 to 120 degrees C), or until a small amount of syrup dropped into cold water forms a firm but pliable ball. In candy making circles, this is known as \"soft ball\". Naturally, it really helps to have a candy thermometer for this part.",
      "7. Remove the sauce pan from heat and stir in the baking soda (mixture will foam). Drop the butter into the foaming mixture and let rest without stirring 30 minutes. Now check out your forearms oh yeah!",
      "8. At this point I usually work on the pecans, picking out any low quality individuals and making sure there are no shell fragments left.",
      "9. Once the 30-minute timer goes off, add the vanilla to the cream mixture and prepare your forearms for a quick 10 to 15 minute stirring workout. Your goal is to stir the \"sheen\" off of this melting pot of buttery, creamy, sugary goodness.",
      "10. At this point, fold in the pecans and quickly turn and spread the candy into the previously prepared 9x13 inch dish. Let it cool until just warm and cut in 1 inch pieces.",
