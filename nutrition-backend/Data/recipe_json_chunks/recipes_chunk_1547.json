Then slowly add in the milk and each egg one at a time. Finally, turn the speed to low and slowly add in the dry ingredients until you have a soft, sticky dough. Line a sheet tray with a silicone mat and turn the dough out onto it. Flour the top of it with a generous sprinkle and also flour your hands. Use your hands to gently spread the dough out to be about 1/2 inch thick and pretty much fill the sheet tray. Set it in the freezer for an hour. This makes it much easier to cut out and handle.",
      "When the hour is up, line another sheet tray with a silicone mat and get out a donut cutter. Cut out the donuts and the lovely holes that come with them, cutting them as close together as possible to yield as many as you can. You should get about 20 donuts and 20 holes. Line them all up on the sheet trays and return them to the freezer for another 30 minutes to firm up again. While that happens, get out a large skillet with deep sides and fill it with about 3 inches of canola oil. Heat it over medium high heat and use a deep fry thermometer to make sure the oil reaches and stays around 350\u00b0F. Fry the donuts in batches for about a minute on each side, removing them to a plate lined with paper towel to drain. While they cook, stir the remaining pumpkin pie spice and granulated sugar together. When the donuts are all fried, coat them all in the sugar and pumpkin pie spice. Serve immediately warm! They also keep well for a couple of days sealed in a container."

I use my hand immersion blender which works perfectly for jobs like this, but any blender or food processor will work. The amount of broth needed for the soup will depend on how much moisture is in your pumpkin, as well as how thick you prefer your soup to be. Just allow the soup to cool a bit before blending it to prevent boiling hot soup from flying around your kitchen.",
      "This soup is best served warm and not too hot so you can taste the complexity of flavors, and since the flavors seem to develop further the day after it is made, it is a great soup to make the day before you plan on serving it. Just allow the soup to cool, then refrigerate it until needed, and reheat gently adding a little additional broth if the soup seems too thick.",

In the morning, remove the dough from the fridge and proceed with the recipe. Don't worry if your dough has risen even more in the refrigerator. It may take a while longer for your buns to double in size after you have shaped and filled them. Overnight proofing actually develops a much more complex flavor which I prefer."

In a separate bowl, whisk eggs, then whisk in 1 1/2 cups sugar, vanilla extract, vegetable oil and buttermilk. With a wooden spoon or spatula, slowly add dry ingredients to wet mixture. Stir until mixture just comes together. Divide batter evenly between pans and bake for 25-30 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the centre of the cake comes out clean.",
      "For the frosting:",
      "In a large bowl or stand mixer with the paddle attachment, stir softened butter until smooth. Add icing sugar bit by bit, followed by vanilla extract. Add buttermilk, 1 tablespoon at a time, until frosting comes together and is smooth and creamy, if it is necessary to add more than 4 tablespoons to reach the desired consistency then add a touch more. Stir in a pinch of salt to taste.",
      "For the candied rose petals:",
      "Set up a sheet pan with parchment paper, one small bowl with the egg white in it, one small bowl with the sugar, and another bowl with the rose petals. Take each rose petal and run gently through the egg white, coat in the sugar and place on the sheet tray to dry for a minimum of 2 hours.",
      "To assemble the cake:",
      "When cakes come out, transfer to a cooling rack and set in the fridge to cool for 1 hour before levelling them off and icing them. Once cakes are cool, use a serrated knife to cut off the rounded top of the cake. (There are a number of good videos on how to do this properly online and they are definitely worth checking out.) The trip to perfectly smooth icing is to use a spatula for the top of the cake and run a pastry scraper along the sides of the cake to give it a smooth and uniform appearance.",
      "Top with raspberries or candied rose petals or both, slice and enjoy. Chill cake in the fridge and remove it 30 minutes before you'd like to serve it to allow the cake to soften up slightly at room temperature."

      "1. Make sure your Zoku Quick Pop maker base has thoroughly frozen. I leave mine in my freezer indefinitely. Then it's ready whenever I need to use it to make popsicles! I do the same with my ice cream maker base!",
      "2. In a food processor (or powerful blender) add your bag of frozen blueberries and 1/4 cup concord grape juice. Process until mixture stops twirling around. When it starts twirling around this means you need to add more liquid. Continue until all of the juice is added.",
      "3. While processor is on, slowly pour in your buttermilk. Continue adding until your mixture freely spins around and turns into a puree. You are looking for the consistency of baby food (or a nice smoothie). You might not need to add your whole cup of buttermilk if your berries were full of juice OR if the bag had defrosted some before you began. You might need to add more than a cup if the mixture was too frozen. Either is totally OK. Add as much as you need to acquire smoothie consistency.",
      "4. Scrape down the sides of the bowl and add your 1/8-1/4 cup of honey. Because my berries were on the tarter side, I needed the full 1/4 cup. Process again until thoroughly combined. Taste. Mixture should be just barely overly sweet. Because it will be consumed frozen, it'll lose a tiny bit of its sweetness. Add more honey if need be; do so to your liking.",
      "5. Pour mixture into an easy pourable container. I used my Pyrex 4 cup measuring cup with lip for easy pouring. Remove popsicle base out of freezer, place sticks in and carefully pour blueberry mixture into slots. For the Zoku Quick Pop Maker, pour until you reach the \"fill line\". Set timer for 6-8 minutes. Place remaining blueberry mixture in fridge.",

Then carefully remove them as per your manufacturer's instructions, wrap in plastic wrap, and place into freezer. For Zoku Maker, use the \"Super Tool\" to twist popsicles out of base, wrap in plastic wrap, and place in freezer.",
      "7. Continue again with more of the blueberry mixture and more popsicle sticks, until you've used it all. Remember that for each new batch of popsicles being made, increase your freezing time in the base. As base sits out on counter it will lose it's freezing strength. For second batch set your timer for 8-9 minutes, for the third batch set it for 9-10 minutes, etc.",

Remove the mixer attachment and knead by hand, adding flour until dough does not stick to the bowl (while I did not keep count of total flour used, it was about 3/4 of a 5 pound bag). Remove dough from bowl and knead until dough feels satiny and looks smooth. It shouldn't be sticking to your countertop at this point, and you should not need any more flour.",
      "7. Cover and let rise for at least 30 minutes.",

      "15. Let rolls cool before frosting to allow for a thick cover like those pictured, or frost while warm for a light glaze."

    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "Prepare the Jars:",
      "Begin by separating 12 half-pint-sized (8-ounce) jars from their lids and rings. If you haven't already, sanitize them and make sure insides are well-dried.",
      "In a large bowl, crush the Oreo cookies into medium-sized chunks. Place a large spoonful of cookie crumbles in the bottom of each jar, just covering the bottom of the glass.",
      "Have a 9x13 metal pan with 2\" sides or taller at the ready on your counter top. This is what you will bake the jars in, surrounded by water.",
      "Prepare the Filling:",
      "Use an electric mixer to whip all 5 bricks of the room-temperature cream cheese until smooth and creamy. Slowly beat in 1-1/2 cups of the granulated sugar until evenly mixed (save the remaining 1/4 cup sugar for later).",
      "Using a separate bowl and wire egg whisk, beat the eggs until yolks and whites run together a little bit. (You can do this by hand; it doesn't take very long.) Add the milk, flour and vanilla extract to the egg mixture and use the whisk to lightly incorporate everything.",
      "Using the \"stir\" setting on mixer, gradually pour the egg mixture into the cream cheese mixture; once it is mostly incorporated you can raise the beater speed until the batter is smooth.",
      "Take two large mixing bowls and pour about 1/3 of the mixture into each of them, leaving 1/3 in the original mixing bowl. Scrape the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula as you do this to make sure no cheese lumps are left in there.",
      "To the first bowl, add the cocoa powder and your remaining 1/4 cup additional granulated sugar.",
      "To the second bowl, add the vanilla bean scrapings and ground cinnamon.",
      "For the third bowl, microwave the black raspberry jam in a measuring cup for about 30 seconds. Stir until smooth and add to the third bowl of cheese filling. If the final stirred product looks a little bit too purple, you can add a couple of drops of pink food coloring. I kind of liked the purplish-pink look, so I left it as-is.",
      "Layer the Jars:",
      "Preheat the oven to 325F at this point because it will still take you a little while to complete this process. You will also want to begin boiling a kettle full of water at this point. Once boil is reached, remove the kettle from heat even if you're not quite done assembling the jars. It will still be warm enough for what you need in a few minutes.",
      "Add a few spoonfuls of chocolate batter to each jar over the cookie crumbles. Don't add too much, though, because you've still got several layers to go.",
      "It helps to have a folded, clean dishtowel on the counter top to rap the jar up and down a little bit on to get mixture to settle without breaking the jar on the hard counter.",
      "Make sure there are no streaks of chocolate filling on the jar sides above that layer. If there are, you can run a clean napkin around the inside of the jar to take most of it away.",
      "Repeat this process with the vanilla filling layer, being sure you are barely over the halfway mark of the jar after adding the second filling.",
      "(The batter is probably going to rise slightly or shift while in the oven, and you will also need to conserve the upper-rim area for the pie filling so that all three actual cheesecake layers are visible even when lids/rings are in place later.)",
      "Again, wipe any higher-than-vanilla-layer filling away from jar sides.",
      "Repeat this process again with the raspberry filling layer. You should now be almost to the top of the regular jar part (not rim).",
      "Some air bubbles may rise to the surface as you fill the jars. You can pop them with a toothpick if it's easy to do, but don't stress about it too much.",
      "Bake the Jars:",
      "As you complete the raspberry cheesecake layer for each jar, place the jar into the 9x13\" metal cake pan, making rows. Once all 12 jars have been filled and transferred to the pan, you can slowly begin pouring the hot water from the tea kettle into the pan (surrounding the jars). This is easiest to do from one corner of the pan.",
      "Be patient and careful when adding the heated water; you don't want any of the jars to overheat too quickly and crack. The entire purpose of using very hot water here is to prepare them for an easy transition into the hot oven. So...slowly, gradually, methodically is how you want to temper the glass.",
      "Once the water is about 2/3 way up the sides of the jars(or no higher than you feel comfortable lifting), put on your oven mitts and carefully transfer the water-and-jar-filled pan into the preheated oven and. Position pan on the center rack and close the oven door, and reduce heat to 300 degrees F.",
      "Bake jars for 30 minutes, avoiding opening the oven door unless absolutely necessary. At the end of 30 minutes, turn the oven off, but leave jar-filled pan inside oven for another 20 minutes or so. If it's not hot in your kitchen, you can prop the oven door open after 15 minutes like this.",
      "When you remove the pan from the oven, you'll see that the filling has probably risen up to the surface of the jar mouth on each one. Once out of the oven, you should be able to use the back of a spoon to tap the filling back down to the level of the rim bottom.",
      "Spoon raspberry pie filling into the top of each jar, filling most of the rim area with it while cheesecake is still hot. Add the lids and rims to the jars. As they cool, you might even hear some of them do that fun \"plink!\" that regular jars* do when you're canning other items.",
      "*Because you'll be using these within the next several days regardless of that plinking seal, it doesn't really matter if they all seal like that.",
      "Once your jars have finished cooling, decorate lids with ribbons or fabric if desired and transfer to the fridge."

      "To grill the corn:",
      "1. Over medium heat, place the corn (in their husks!) on the grill, directly over the heat. Turn the corn every 2-3 minutes, when the husks begin to blacken. The silk or ends of the husks might catch fire as they dry out. I think this adds an amazing smoky flavor to the corn, but if you're scared (chicken!), just make sure to trim those bits off before you put them on the grill. (Practice proper safety! Always use long tongs when handling the corn, and keep your digits away from the flame.)",
      "2. When the husks are good and charred and the kernels are mostly cooked, remove the corn from the grill and place it in a pan or bowl you have standing by until it cools down a bit. Carefully peel back and remove the husks, watching out for any trapped hot steam. Place the naked ears (teehee!) back on the grill and turn every 1-2 minutes, or until as many kernels as possible have browned and caramelized. Brown = sweet flavor!",
      "3. Remove the corn from the grill, and when it is cool enough to handle, cut the kernels from the cob. Scrape the back of your knife along the cob to really get all the creamy corn bits out of there. Set the kernels aside, and reserve the empty cobs as well (don't throw them away!).",
      "To make the soup:",
      "1. In a Dutch oven or soup pot over medium heat, saute the onion and shallots in 1 Tablespoon of olive oil and 1 teaspoon of salt until they are soft and starting to brown, about 10 minutes. Add the garlic and jalapeno and cook another 3 minutes, until softened. Add the potato and cook until starting to soften, about 5 minutes. Add the remaining teaspoon of the salt, pepper, paprika, coriander, celery salt, cayenne, oregano, tarragon, and cumin, stir to coat the vegetables, and let it cook for about a minute, until the spices release their fragrant oils.",
      "2. Increase the heat to high and deglaze the pot with the sherry, making sure to scrape up any flavor bits from the bottom. Bring the sherry to a simmer and let it reduce by half, to about 1 cup of liquid. Add the chicken broth, and when it has come to a boil add the reserved empty corn ears. Reduce the heat to low, cover the pot and simmer for at least 30 minutes. The longer you let it simmer, the more flavor the soup will have. I would shoot for an hour if you have the time.",
      "3. While the soup is simmering, preheat the oven to 425 degrees. Spread the chopped cauliflower in a single layer in a roasting pan, and toss with the remaining Tablespoon of olive oil. Roast in the oven for about 20-25 minutes, or until the cauliflower is soft and starting to brown around the edges. Check on it about 10 minutes in and give it a good stir so it browns evenly.",
      "4. When the soup is simmered to your satisfaction, remove the pot from the heat and let it cool down a little. Remove and discard the ears of corn, and stir in the roasted cauliflower. When it is cool enough, puree the soup using an immersion blender, blender, or food processor.",
      "5. Place the soup back over medium-low heat. Add the reserved corn kernels, cream, and milk. Bring the soup to a bare simmer and let it cook for 10 minutes or so, just to let all the flavors come together.",
      "6. Stir in the chopped cilantro at the very end and serve."

      "Begin by heating a large cast iron skillet on medium heat. Add the bacon pieces and cook, rendering all of the fat, until slightly crisp but not super crispy. This will take about 10 minutes or so. During this time, prepare the rest of the ingredients.",
      "When the bacon is cooked, remove it from the skillet with a slotted spoon onto some paper towel to remove any excess fat. Pour off most of the bacon grease, reserving it for a later use. Return the skillet back to the heat and add the tablespoon of butter. Toss in the onion and garlic, and let them begin to sweat, cooking on medium heat for about 5 minutes. Make sure to stir along the way.",
      "When the onions and garlic and cooked, add the salt and pepper, along with the brown sugar. Give it a good stir, letting the sugar begin to melt away into the onions. After a couple of minutes, add the remaining ingredients and let it come to a boil. Toss in the bacon and stir to combine. Now put the mixture into a slow cooker. Cook on low heat for 3 hours.",
      "After 3 hours in the slow cooker, place the mixture into a food processor and pulse it until you reach your desired consistency. I like mine to have some recognizable bacon pieces, but pieces that are not extremely big (almost like bacon bit consistency).",
      "Return the mixture to a sauce pan and cook on medium heat until most if not all of the liquid evaporates, leaving you with a jam-like consistency.",
      "Store in the refrigerator in a sealed container for up to three weeks, if it lasts that long.",
      "When you are ready to serve, feel free to spread this on pretty much anything. The texture is spot on, and the flavor is something out of this world. You get the sweetness from the onion, sugar and maple, and a subtle but ever so delicious bitterness from the coffee. Along with the smokiness of the bacon and a slight sourness from the cider vinegar, this bacon jam is something else. Give it a shot and let me know your thoughts! Hope you enjoy."

Season with a pinch each of salt and pepper and sweat over medium heat until the onions are translucent and the carrots are soft. Add to the bowl with the bread cubes.",
      "4. Return the skillet to medium-high heat and add the remaining 1 tablespoon butter and 2 tablespoons olive oil. Add the mushrooms and cook, stirring occasionally. After about 7 minutes, when the mushrooms are mostly browned, add the garlic as well as a pinch of salt and pepper. Cook for about 1 minute. Add this to the bowl with the bread and veggies.",
      "5. Stir the Italian parsley, thyme, and fennel fronds into the bread mixture. Add the stock 1/2 cup at a time. Fresher bread will require less liquid. (If you're making dressing, then make the bread a little moister than you would like to eat it, because it will dry out slightly as it bakes. If making stuffing, the stuffing will absorb more moisture from the turkey.) Stir in the Parmesan cheese (optional) and season with salt and pepper to taste.",
      "6. If you're stuffing the turkey, loosely fill the cavity with the stuffing. For dressing, pour the bread mixture into the greased baking dish and cover with aluminum foil. Bake for 20 minutes with the foil and then remove the foil and bake for 20 minutes longer, until the top is brown.",
      "7. Allow the dressing to set for just a few minutes.",
      "Note: Dressing can be made in a couple of days in advance and kept in the refrigerator, just be sure to leave the glass or ceramic baking dish out at room temperature for about 20 minutes before putting it into the hot oven. Also, increase the amount of time the dressing bakes with the foil on to 30 minutes."

Adjust the amount of beef broth and cooking time according to your package instructions. I find it better to err on the side of a little less liquid than called for since you'll be adding some back in with the caramelized veggies.",
      "- If you don't care for peppers, use two onions instead. We buy a club pack of 6 bell peppers every week (which contains 1 green and 5 red/orange/yellow) and roast one every night along with a bunch of other veggies. However, my husband will only eat the green peppers once they've been caramelized for this dish.",
      "- Feel free to experiment with other spices/seasonings. I've tried thyme, oregano, and basil. Just add whatever you want to the veggies while they're caramelizing. However, there's plenty of flavor without other seasonings.",
      "- You could certainly make this vegetarian by using vegetable broth, or just water, to cook the grain. I like the flavor from the beef broth. If you don't use broth, add a little salt.",
      "- I have read that the \"best\" way to cook quinoa is to fully rinse it in cold water and then toast it in the pan before adding cooking liquid. Also, apparently the \"proper\" amount of cooking liquid is closer to 1 1/4 cup per 1 cup of quinoa than the 2:1 ratio usually listed on the package. I rarely rinse/toast my quinoa and have found that I get nice fluffy cooked quinoa using about 1 1/2 cup liquid per 1 cup quinoa. If you have the time and think it will taste better, by all means, rinse/toast and use less cooking liquid!"

Spread evenly over the bottom layer of the cake and set in the freezer for 5 to 10 minutes. Once the Nutella layer sets, spread a layer of chocolate hazelnut whipped cream over it. Top with other cake layer and frost the sides and top of the cake with cream. Top with chopped hazelnuts. Feel free to pipe a design around the top and bottom sides of the cake; you will have more than enough cream to do so!"

      "1. Prepare the batter the night before you want to make these! In a large bowl mix the oats, flour, baking soda, baking powder, cinnamon and nutmeg. Add the honey, eggs, vanilla and buttermilk and mix until the batter is well-combined. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap (or mix it in a container with a lid) and refrigerate overnight.",
      "2. The next morning give the batter a good, quick stir to combine. It should be fairly thick. Heat an electric griddle or skillet on the stove top over medium-low to medium heat. These pancakes need to cook for longer than traditional pancakes so you don't want the pan so hot that they burn. If needed, spray the griddle or skillet with cooking spray. Drop 1/4 cup rounds of batter into the preheated griddle or skillet. Fit as many as you can onto the griddle but don't crowd it. Let them cook for 2-3 minutes until the edges are very set and bubbles are popping on the surface (again, make sure your griddle isn't too hot or the bottoms will burn for this length of time). Quickly slide a flat spatula underneath and flip the pancakes making sure they are set before flipping. Cook for another minute or so until they are cooked through. Remove to a plate and finish cooking the rest of the batter. Serve warm with desired pancake toppings (or Nutella, in our case)!",

      "Add oats, flax, 3 cups flour and salt. Using the dough hook on your stand mixer (or with your hands), knead the dough on low speed for 6 minutes until all the flour is incorporated. If the dough seems too sticky, add extra flour 1 tablespoon at a time until it looks the way you would like (but a little sticky is good!). Add in 3 tablespoons of the mixed seeds and mix until combined.",
      "Grease the bowl you mixed the dough in and place the dough back in the bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and place in a warm place (I use the oven with the light on) for at least 2 hours, or until the dough has doubled in size.",
      "Once the dough has doubled in size, preheat oven 450\u00b0F. Place a large Dutch oven with the lid on in the oven on the centre rack. You may also use a pizza stone (or baking sheet) if that's all you have.",

Knead the dough a few times with your hands and then form the dough into a rough oval shape (if needed, you can divide the dough in half and make two loafs). Place the dough on a parchment-lined baking sheet and cover with a damp kitchen towel. Allow the dough to rise for 20 minutes.",
      "After 20 minutes, brush dough with the beaten egg and then sprinkle with the remaining 4 tablespoons of mixed seeds. Using a sharp knife, gently make a small slit down the center of the loaf. Drizzle the seeds with a little liquid honey.",
      "Carefully remove the hot Dutch oven from the oven and remove the lid. Very carefully, pick the dough up by the parchment paper and lift it into the hot Dutch oven (parchment and all). Place the hot lid back on the pot and return to the oven.",
      "Bake for 20 minutes, then reduce the heat to 375\u00b0F. Using oven mitts, remove the hot lid and continue baking until the bread is a deep, golden brown, about 15-20 minutes more. Remove from the oven. Carefully lift the bread out of the pot and place it on a wire rack to cool completely, about 2 hours (the bread continues to cook as it cools).",

Bake, stirring occasionally, until golden brown, 20-35 minutes. Begin closely checking the granola every 5 minutes after the 15-minute mark because the granola has a tendency to burn quickly and the cocoa will make it hard to see any burnt areas.",

      "Pour the oil into a large skillet or Dutch oven. Use something that is good for frying, about 2 inches deep. Heat the oil to about 375 F over medium heat. You can test the oil by flinging a drop of water into the pan. If it sizzles across the top, it's ready. If not, continue the heat the oil until it does.",
      "With floured hands, roll the dough into small balls, about 1 1/2 inches in diameter. Drop the balls immediately into the oil (they start to lose their shape if you roll them ahead of time). The balls should start to puff out on the bottom and turn a golden brown color. If the tops of the donuts aren't covered with oil, flip the donut balls and fry for another 1-2 minutes. You should fry them for about 3-4 minutes total (see note below). When the donuts are cooked through, remove them from the frying pan and place them on a plate lined with paper towels. Repeat with the remaining dough, if you didn't fry all of them in the first batch.",
      "Put the cinnamon sugar onto a plate. When the donuts are dry to the touch, roll them in cinnamon sugar. These are best served fresh and warm, but they will also last for a day or two in an airtight container. This recipe makes about 20 donut balls.",
      "Notes: If your donuts are dark brown after just 1 minute in the pan, you probably have the oil too hot and you'll end up with a crispy outside with an uncooked inside. Make sure you cook them for 3-4 minutes total to make sure the insides are fully cooked. I went back and forth between the medium-low and medium heat settings on my range (because I don't have an oil thermometer)."
