      "Preheat your oven to 350degrees*.",
      "Grease and flour a 9 x 13 pan or 2 8in. round cake pans.",
      "Measure all ingredients into a large mixing bowl.",
      "Blend for 30 seconds on low speed. Scrape sides of bowl down. Blend on high speed for 60 seconds, scraping bowl occassionally.",
      "Pour into prepared pans. Smack pans gently on counter to get rid of any air bubbles.",
      "Bake 9 x 13 for 45 minutes; 8 inch rounds for 30-40 minutes or until wooden toothpick or cake tester comes out clean. Frost cake with your favorite frosting**.",
      "Notes: *Many home ovens have widely varying oven temperatures. Buying an oven thermometer at your local discount store will cost you about $3 and guarantee you will have great success in your cake & other baking endeavors. Preheat your oven to 350 degrees and place the thermometer in the back of oven. After 5 minutes,check the thermometer and move it to the left side then the right side and then the front of your oven. Adjust your oven settings accordingly to how far off 350 degrees the temps are in your oven. Many of you will be surprised at just how far off a brand new oven can be. $3 is a small price to pay for successful baking. **When baking this cake in 8 inch rounds, I spread a thin layer of my cream cheese frosting on top of the first layer and then slice a couple of bananas on top of the frosting and then place the second layer on top and finish frosting the cake with the rest of the cream cheese frosting. When I bake it in x 13 pan, I like to toast coconut on a cookie sheet and after frosting the cooled cake with either my cream cheese frosting or my butter pecan frosting, I sprinkle the toasted coconut on top of the frosted cake. Either variation pleases my family and friends. Using your imagination you can customize this into your own family favorite."

      "Add the flour, about 1/3 at a time, alternately with the liquids (milk and bourbon). Be sure to scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl after each addition. Blend in the nuts, if you're using them.",
      "Grease and flour your pan(s); use one (2.8L, 11 cup) bundt-style pan, a 10-inch tube pan, or two 8 1/2 x 4 1/2-inch loaf pans. Preheat your oven to 180\u00b0C",
      "Scoop the batter into the pan(s) and level it with a spatula. Bake the cake for 70 to 75 minutes, until a tester inserted in the center comes out clean. Remove the cake from the oven, and let it cool it in the pan(s) for 10 minutes.",
      "Syrup: While the cake is cooling, heat the butter, sugar and bourbon together in a small saucepan set over low heat. Stir until the butter is melted and the sugar is dissolved, then bring the mixture to a boil. CAUTION: The bourbon is likely to burst into flame when it reaches the boiling point. This process, while quite impressive, calls for a few notes of caution. Don't lean over the pan while you're stirring; it also might be a good idea to have a lid handy to quiet the flame. This process will burn off the alcohol. When the flame goes out, remove the glaze from the heat. Note: the bourbon may not ever burst into flame; that's OK. Just boil it for about 15 seconds, then remove it from the heat.",
      "After the cake has cooled for 10 minutes, turn it out of the pan and onto a rack, then poke small toothpick-sized holes all over the top surface. Brush the top of the cake with the still-warm glaze. It'll drizzle down into the holes to make a very moist cake.",
      "You can certainly eat the cake as soon as it's cooled, but it does improve with a \"rest period\" of 1 or 2 days. Do let the cake cool for several hours, to allow the glaze to set before wrapping well in plastic wrap. (No need to refrigerate it.) Before serving, dust the cake with a non-melting sugar, if desired, or ice with Bourbon White Chocolate Ganache. Yield: one cake or two \"loaves,\" about 32 servings."

I have also altered the water ingrediant and used a can of cream of mushroom so that there is some \"gravy\" to pour all over. On occassion, I have seen some people wrinkle their nose at the thought of eating bear meat but when I serve this, they change their minds! Many times, they can't even tell the difference! A stomach doesn't care as long as it's good and this is one of the best. Add/subtract you favorite veggies and enjoy!",

Since we were given this meat, not harvested by us, I was unsure how old it was and how it was prepared, so I added 1 T of vinegar to the water. This tenderizes the meat while cooking and does not leave a vinegary taste. Also added the salt at the end.",
      "If you didn't have any bear, but beef stew meat. And needed a recipe for turnips and this is very good. I also added some whole allspice and parsnip, as well as whole pepper kernels instead of ground. I'd only suggest to add the turnips and mushrooms about 1/2hr before the end as they got rather soft. Otherwise it's very tasty, even my 15mo old enjoyed it!"

      "1. In a large bowl, combine ground beef, bread crumbs, parsley, Parmesan, 1/4 teaspoon black pepper, garlic powder and beaten egg. Mix well and form into 12 balls. Store, covered, in refrigerator until needed. Or you can prepared the meatballs and cooked them in the oven on a sheet pan for 20 minutes at 350*F. Then added them to the sauce, or store, covered, in refrigerator until needed.",
      "2. In a large saucepan over medium heat, saute onion and garlic in olive oil until onion is translucent. Stir lean the ground beef, in tomatoes, salt, sugar and bay leaf. Cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer 90 minutes. Stir in tomato paste, basil, 1/2 teaspoon pepper and meatballs and simmer 30 minutes more. Serve.",
      "My Note: Sometime I also spiced up the meatballs with some stand-by italian spices (basic, oregano, etc.) and I upped the garlic (to taste). Also, I used crackers (pounded or processed to crumbs) in place of bread crumbs, and used a little less than called for. This made a very solid and yummy meatball I was leary of making this without first pre-cooking the meatballs, but this is by far the best spaghetti and meatballs I have ever made. The meatballs ended up a nice brown color, they were not over cooked and I think putting them in before browning allowed some of the meat flavor to seep into the sauce. opted to use a combination of ground pork and ground beef (12 oz ground beef, 4 oz ground pork) -instead of plain bread crumbs, I used pre-seasoned breadcrumbs, I increased the parmesan cheese to 4 oz. With the sauce, instead of using 2 (28 oz) cans of whole tomatoes, I used 1 (28 oz can) of whole tomatoes, and then two smaller cans (14 oz) of crushed tomatoes. After simmering the sauce, I ran half of it through the blender to make it smoother. I also added a small can of tomato sauce in addition to the tomato paste, plus for added flavour I added 1 tsp italian seasoning, 1/2 tsp basil, and 1 tsp garlic powder. If you think or found the meatballs too dry, may I suggest adding 1/2 cup of water, or milk, or tomato sauce to the meatballs? The eggs will bind them, but not make them moister - adding liquid makes them exquisitely tender and juicy. Also, if you want a lighter meatball, substitute oatmeal for the breadcrumbs - measure it first, then run it briefly in the blender so you won't have any big bits in the meatballs. I added 1.5 tsp oregano and 3 tsp basil; added 1 tsp seasoned salt, 1 medium green pepper. I was very, very happy with the sauce. Put it into a 250* oven while I cooked other stuff, for about 2 hours,it was wonderful.",
      "We do work long hours and don't have time at night to make a 2 hour meal, so what I did was use my slow cooker. In the morning I sauteed my onion and garlic, combined it with all the ingredience including half a can of tomato sauce for extra liquid since it tends to lose some in a slow cooker. Had my Son turn the cooker on low at his lunch, so the sauce cooked about 6 1/2 hours. one hour before the sauce was done, he put the meat balls inches We did end up adding the extra half a can of sauce just for liquid, but the flavor was amazing. By using the slow cooker for us working cooks, it was nice to come home to a ready made meal and good as this. Old YES! If you substituted turkey or other poultry for ground beef -- you are never supposed to use breadcrumbs, that type of meat is quite dry, breadcrumbs only makes it worse!"

Keep working the flour and shortening until the mixture is rather grainy, like coarse cornmeal. Mix the egg and vinegar together and, using a wooden fork, stir the mixture into the flour.

      "Preheat the oven to 280\u00b0 and position two racks in the lower section of the oven. Line two rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper. If you have time, draw 1-inch circles on the back of each sheet, spacing the circles at least 1/2-inch apart.",
      "If your almond meal is very coarse, grind it with the powdered sugar in a food processor until fine. Sift the almond meal-powdered sugar mixture twice through a mesh sieve.",
      "Place egg whites in the bowl of a stand mixer (or use a hand mixer) and begin to beat on medium-high. When the eggs are frothy, gradually add granulated sugar one tablespoon at a time until fully incorporated. Continue to beat the egg white mixture until glossy and stiff peaks form when you lift the beaters. Gently stir in the vanilla extract. Be careful to not overbeat the meringue (e.g., the meringue takes on a clumpy texture).",
      "Add half of the sifted almond mixture and gently fold it into the meringue using a flexible silicone spatula. Lift from the bottom, up around the sides, and toward the middle, being careful to not overagitate the meringue and lose too much air. Once the almond mixture is predominantly incorporated, add the second half and repeat the folding motion.",
      "When the almond mixture is just incorporated, you will need to transform the batter into the appropriate texture. Using the flat of the spatula, \"punch\" down into the center of the batter, then scrape more batter from the sides to the center, and punch again. You will need to repeat this 10-15 times (or more, depending on your arm strength and the beginning texture of your batter) until the batter slowly and continuously drips back into the bowl when you scoop it up with the spatula. Think of the consistency of molten lava. For the best results, punch the batter a few times, check the consistency, then punch a few more times, etc. Do not make the batter too runny or the macarons won't rise as they should, and you could end up with oil stains on the surface.",
      "Pour batter into a pastry bag fitted with a 0.4-inch tip. In a pinch, you can also use a gallon size Ziploc bag: just snip a teeny bit from one of the bottom corners. Twist and clip the top of the bag to avoid overflow. On your prepared baking sheets, pipe out 1-inch rounds in the circles you drew (remember to draw the circles on the back side of your parchment to avoid ink or pencil stains on your macarons!).",
      "Holding the baking sheet in both hands, rap each baking sheet firmly on the counter two or three times. This smooths out the tops and helps form the \"pied\" or frilly foot on the bottoms of the macarons. Allow the piped macarons to dry, uncovered, for at least 15 minutes. The macarons should form a very thin, smooth crust where, if you tap it lightly with your finger, the batter will not stick to your finger. If after 15 minutes, the batter is still sticky, let it dry longer. This may take up to an hour on humid days.",
      "Place both baking sheets in the oven and bake for 15-18 minutes. After the first 2 minutes, open the oven to allow any excess humidity to escape. Halfway through, swap oven racks and rotate the sheets for even baking. The macarons are done when they are baked all the way through and the shells are just hard. Take care to not underbake (insides will still be mushy) or overbake (tops will begin to brown). Remove them from the oven, and cool on baking sheet placed on a wire rack.",

Arrange the legs so the cut side of the marshmallow faces the back of the bear.",

      "Dust the entire frosted surface (except the blue water) so it looks like freshly fallen snow coats the surface. Use any extra confectioner's sugar to finish off the igloo (make sure the entry of the igloo does not show foil).",
      "Lastly, position the mother polar bear so she is half sitting and looking into the water. Position the tiny triangle (the cub's head) in the water so it seems to be looking up at its mother.",
      "If this will not be served the same day, place the entire tray into a larger box and either seal it or cover well with plastic wrap.",
      "Note: You will need a very sharp or well serrated knife to cut this. Watch your fingers.",
      "The igloo will make many servings. Because it is so sweet, small portions are best. I had at least 50 modest portions, but one inch portions might be better.",
      "Caution: The polar bear mother can be eaten, but remove all toothpicks first.",
      "Get ready for heaps of praise! Enjoy!"

If you are not in the mood to stick your hands in and mix, a large rubber spatula works well to keep scraping and folding. Mix until there is no sign of flour. You can put all the of the flour and broth in an 11-cup food processor if you have one, but it makes for a pretty rubbery seitan.",

You can wrap some of the seitan in foil, or wrap in cheesecloth to give it a denser, less porous texture that works well for browning in dishes like Fajitas. You can also make a more free-form seitan that works well in soups and stir frys. A favorite thing to do is make Texas-Style BBQ Brisket.",

Now add the sliced red onions and saute until translucent. Transfer the pre-cooked pork to this and stir fry with constant stirring for 6-8 minutes to caramelize. If the meat feels dry, add a tbsp or two of the reserved cooking liquid and cook until it's dried up. The pork will acquire a shiny glaze. Correct the seasoning and serve with steamed rice.",

      "In the great cookie debate, there are chewy people and there are crispy people. But when it comes to peanut butter cookies, it seems that the chewy lovers are always forced to settle for an \"inferior\" crispy version. We wanted to change that. Here's what we discovered:",

      "* Switching from shortening to butter made the task of creating a chewy cookie more difficult, but the superior flavor was worth the complication.",
      "* Thanks to hydrogenated oils used in manufacturing, processed peanut butter produced a chewier cookie than natural peanut butter.",
      "* The chewiest recipes we encountered were sweetened with honey, but we found the flavor overbearing. To retain the moisture of the honey without sacrificing flavor, we used light corn syrup instead.",
      "* We cut back on the egg white in our recipe and added more peanut butter to make up for the loss of moisture.",
      "* Chopped peanuts on top of the cookies added even more peanut flavor.",
      "* Baking soda reacted quickly with the acidic ingredients in the dough to create bubbles that expanded in the heat of the oven. This caused the cookies to puff up and deflate before their structure had time to set, leaving the centers soft and chewy.",
      "* We used melted butter instead of creamed butter to ensure that the cookies weren't too cakey."

Stir to mix flavors. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Continue sauteing until onions are dark golden brown and fully caramelized, about 5-10 minutes more. Add water, 1 tablespoon at a time, if pan becomes dry. (Refer to Tidbit below).",

Roast for an additional 5 - 8 minutes until potatoes are cooked through and slightly browned. Taste for seasoning.",

You will not have a solid dough, but it will be tacky and easy to form into balls. If by chance the dough is too soft, then semi-flatten the dough into a medium size bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and place in the freezer for 10 to 15 minutes.",

      "After you have all the balls rolled, slide the sheet pan into the freezer for 5 to 10 minutes. While they're firming up a bit, start working on melting the chocolate coating. You'll need about 3/4 of the package of almond bark plus approximately 1/3 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips. The chocolate chips are to add a milk chocolate color to the coating. Careful not to go too heavy on the chocolate chips, they can cause the coating to be soft and lose that chocolate snap you want around the creamy center.",

It will take 1-2 minutes to fully melt, so do not walk away.",

When you see there's just a few chips left, turn off heat. Add another teaspoon of shortening if the coating seems too thick. Go get the cookie truffles from the freezer.",
      "Using the same pan, push all the balls to one side and make room for chocolate dipped balls. With a fork or dipping tool, place one ball in melted chocolate and quickly coat evenly. Lift up ball and gently shake extra chocolate off. Flip coated ball back onto sheet pan. Get another dough ball and repeat steps until all are coated. Now it's time to decorate.",

Then again at 70% power, 30 second intervals until melted, stirring between intervals. Continuous stirring helps melt any remaining lumps.",

      "Preheat oven to 375 degrees Farenheit. Put about 1Tbsp. butter on a sheet pan (I lined the sheet pan with nonstick aluminum foil first-worked great!). Put pan in preheated oven and melt butter. Thinly slice a pear that you've cored. Take pan with melted butter out of oven, put tortilla on butter, then flip over so bottom is greased. Put sliced pear on the tortilla, dot about a teaspoon butter on pear in little bits, sprinkle a little sugar on pear. Bake in preheated oven for about 10 minutes, until the pear is cooked through and the tortilla is lightly browned around the edges. Remove from oven, cut into wedges and enjoy while still warm."
