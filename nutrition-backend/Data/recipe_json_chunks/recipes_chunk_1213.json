      "If meat is not too lean it will add moisture to soup mixture as it cooks. When roast is finished, remove from slow cooker and pour the juices into a seperate container or measuring cup. Let the fat rise to top. Drain off fat and pour juices into a saucepan. For thicker \"Gravy\", simply Pour juices into large saucepan, mix 2-3 tablespoons of flour(Depending on how much liquid you have to work with) with 2-3 tablespoons of cold water until it has no lumps. Pour flour mixture into meat juices in saucepan and bring to a boil, (whisking constantly) reduce heat and whisk continuously until mixture thickens. About 1 minute. Remove from heat and serve as a gravy or transfer meat to a serving platter, slice meat thin and pour over beef before serving."

It sounded just a bit too nineteenth century, somehow smacking of grim British boarding school meals. Or something like that. Tapioca was an ingredient I had NEVER used, so I checked it out on the internet and learnt courtesy of Encyclopedia Britannica, that it (tapioca) was probably first harvested by the Mayans. And the sheer mystique of THAT connection was enough for me to give the recipe a try. I still haven't used tapioca in any other way, but I'm glad to have found this recipe. Tapioca and all!"

Smear the ricotta mixture on top of the dry pasta sheets, sprinkle chicken on top of that, the grated cheese on top of that and then spoon half your jar of salsa over that. Then add another, more generous layer of the pumpkin sauce. Then pasta, ricotta, chicken, jack, salsa and/or pumpkin. The last layer should be pumpkin sauce sprinkled with the grated cheese.",

Coming up short or with too much this or that has to do with how thickly you layer things and the depth of your pan. I do know that you don't really want to end with a layer of pasta noodles because they'll just stay hard and that if you only give yourself a centimeter clearance from the top you should probably place the pan on a cookie sheet before it goes into the over because it will likely boil over! I often keep a small pan off to the side so I can improvise with any leftovers.",
