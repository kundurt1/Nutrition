Butter paper and dust the pans with flour, tapping out any excess. Set aside. In medium bowl, sift together flour, baking soda, cinnamon and salt; set aside. In mixer bowl, beat oil, vanilla and sugar until combined, about 2 minutes. Add eggs one at a time, incorporating each before adding the next. Beat at medium speed until mixture is pale yellow and fluffy, about 3 minutes. In a medium bowl, mix together bananas, pineapple, walnuts and coconut. Add to egg mixture, stir until well combined. Add flour mixture and blend well. Divide batter between pans. Bake until golden brown and a cake tester inserted in the center comes out clean, 30 to 40 minutes. Transfer pans to greased wire rack. Let cool 15 minutes. Run a knife around edges to loosen. Invert onto racks; reinvert, top side up. Cool completely. Assemble cake, or wrap each layer well and freeze. With serrated knife, trim and discard rounded top off one layer. Place layer on serving platter. Using an offset spatula, spread top of layer with 1/4 inch of frosting. Top with untrimmed layer. Frost sides and top with remaining frosting. Decorate with pineapple flowers, if desired. Serve at room temperature (cake can be refrigerated up to 3 days)."

Slowly add the hot mixture to the dry mixture. Mix in 3 beaten eggs. Mix in enough more flour (at least one more cup) until thoroughly mixed and becomes a soft dough. Cover dough, let rest 10-15 minutes (leave in the bowl). Divide dough into thirds. Knead about 10 times adding flour, if needed. Roll each third into a 9 inch circle. Brush the circle with melted margarine. Cut into 12 pie shaped pieces. (I use a pizza cutter to cut them). Roll from wide end to point and place on greased cookie sheet, point side down. Brush again with melted margarine. Cover, let raise until very light (20-30 minutes). Bake at 350 degrees for 10-12 minutes, or until lightly brown. These freeze very well. Just take out as many as you need and reheat."
