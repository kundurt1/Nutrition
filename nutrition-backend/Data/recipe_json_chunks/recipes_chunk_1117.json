      "CAKE: Set a rack to the middle of your oven and preheat to 350-degrees. Grease an 18\"x 13\" rimmed baking sheet, line it with parchment paper, and then grease the parchment paper too.",
      "Shred four carrots on the large holes of a box grater or using the shedding disk and your food processor.",
      "In a medium bowl, add together flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, nutmeg, salt, and cloves. Whisk together until combined.",
      "In another large bowl add sugar, oil, eggs, and vanilla. Use a whisk to combine until smooth. Gently stir in carrots and currants with a rubber spatula until evenly distributed. Finally, add in flour mixture and fold in with your rubber spatula, but only until it is just combined.",
      "Empty batter onto baking sheet. Use an offset spatula to smooth surface and ensure the batter is an even depth. Bake for about 15 minutes, rotating half-way through baking, until the center is firm when touched.",
      "Allow cake to cool for 5 minutes in pan set on a wire rack. Flip the cake onto a wire rack then immediately re-flip back onto a second wire rack. The cake should be resting with the parchment side down. Allow the cake to cool for another 30 minutes.",
      "FROSTING: While the cake is cooking, toast your pecans and chop them coarsely. Cut your cream cheese into 12 equal-size pieces, but keep it refrigerated until you are ready to use in step 3.",
      "Add the butter, sugar, buttermilk powder, vanilla extract and salt to the bowl of a standing mixer. Mix using the paddle attachment on low-speed for 2 minutes; scrape down the bowl as necessary.",
      "Increase mixer speed to medium-low, then add cream cheese one piece at a time. Mix for 2 minutes until the frosting is smooth.",
      "ASSEMBLY: Put cooled cake on a cutting board and cut into equal halves cross-wise. Cut length-wise so that you have 4 equal pieces, measuring about 6\"x8\" each.",
      "Cut out a 6\"x8\" rectangle out of stiff cardboard. Put the first of the cake piece on the cardboard. Use a spatula to spread 2/3-cup of frosting over layer. Repeat with two more layers.",
      "Place the final cake layer on top. Remove any crumbs from your spatula and frost the top with a 1-cup of frosting.",
      "Frost the sides of the cake with your remaining frosting. You just need enough frosting to hold the chopped pecans, not completely hide all the crumbs.",
      "Holding the cake with one hand, use your other hand to gently press the chopped pecans onto the side of your cake. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour before serving."

      "First, grind almonds and rolled oats into fine meal. I find it works the best when you grind them together as the oats keep the almonds dry and you'll not have oily clumps.",
      "Then, in a large bowl, mix together the dry ingredients (flours, carob and spices).",
      "Next, in a small bowl, whisk together all the ingredients of wet mixture (applesauce, chia seeds, oat milk, xylitol, stevia, 1 teaspoons of chicory paste or instant chicory, salt and nut butters) and let sit for a few minutes until the ground chia seeds absorb the liquid.",
      "Now, pour the wet mixture on dry ingredients and mix carefully until a well-incorporated batter forms. I find it the easiest to use my hand.",
      "Put the dough ball into a sealed container and refrigerate overnight or all day or at least for 6 hours.",
      "Divide the dough into 2 balls and place one at a time on a floured non-stick mat or on stone surface. Keep the dough you are not working with in fridge. Flour a rolling pin, sprinkle some flour (I prefer unroasted buckwheat flour) on the dough and begin rolling it out until you have a rectangle or circle that is about 2mm thick. I like to press it down with my hands first to ease rolling. When rolling the dough ball try moving it around the surface every now and then to make sure there's flour underneath and that it wouldn't stick to the surface. Add flour if it starts to stick.",
      "Cut the gingerbread cookie batter into the shapes of your choice and place on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.",
      "Bake for 10 minutes (175\u00b0C, 350\u00b0F), and then remove from oven. Rotate the pan and return to oven for 3-4 minutes longer, until golden. Let the cookies cool down.",
      "For egg-free royal icing grind 100 grams (3.5oz) of xylitol into powder (confectioner's sugar). Whisk in 2.5 tbsps. of coconut milk and it's ready. I divided the icing between three bowls and added some spirulina to one and some acai powder to the other to have different colours to play with. You can also use turmeric for yellow, matcha powder for green, beet juice for red/pink and blueberry juice or blended blueberries for blue/purple.",

Add the chicken, with more salt, and brown until not pink but not overcooked. If the temperature gets too hot, add warm water to cover and continue to cook. Now add your dry spices including about 1/2 teaspoons salt and generous sprinkling of pepper. Before adding the saffron, dilute in hot water. Mix thoroughly and bring to a covered boil. Add all of tomato paste and mix thoroughly, then adding carrots, turnip and green peppers. Mix thoroughly, adding enough water to cover vegetables.",

Note: when stirring occasionally, have a plate ready to put the steamer part on while you stir the stew. Be sure to wear oven mitts because the steam can easily burn.",
      "By the time you put the top on, it takes about 20-30 minutes to cook. Your couscous will become very fluffy. If it looks too dry, pour some hot water over. Make sure your carrots are done before turning off, but be sure to turn off before your potatoes turn to mush. Just before removing, add your harissa and drained chick peas and mix thoroughly. (Some people ladle out some broth and add more harissa as an optional topping for those who like it extra hot!).",

After both pans have cooled, cut into uniform 2 inch squares and arrange in a checker board fashion.",

The crust is the perfect thickness and there is enough lemon custard in each bite to satisfy. This recipe makes a lot of crust and does spread into a 9 x 13 dish easily, but makes a thinner bar. If using the smaller baking dish (i.e, 8 X 11), make sure to increase cooking time of the crust and filling an extra 5-10 min each. As another reviewer stated, it's better to overcook then undercook the crust. Also, add 1/4 teaspoon salt to the crust for more flavor. This will be my master recipe for Lemon Bars.",

      "I tried it again using the juice of 5 lemons (a little over 2/3 cup) and the zest of two lemons. I also added 1/3 Celsius flour to compensate for the extra liquid. I also had to increase the bake time to about 24 minutes. These turned out GREAT with the extra lemon (and, of course, powdered sugar on top). I also added a dash of salt to the crust and thought it was divine. These weren't anything flashy or out of the ordinary -- just exactly what lemon bars should taste like."

It should not stick to your fingers or fall apart. To test for the correct consistency, pinch a small amount of dough together after kneading for 2 to 3 minutes -- if the dough stays together without sticking to your fingers or falling apart, it should work well. If too soft, add more flour by dusting the top of the dough and knead some more, continuing to dust the dough with flour until achieving the right consistency. If too dry, wet your hands and knead some more, continuing to wet your hands a little at a time & knead until the right consistency. (Achieving the right consistency isn't hard at all -- I got it just right the very first time I tried this recipe).",

IMPORTANT: Flour the pasta rack or the plastic hangers before placing pasta on them. ALSO, separate the strips of pasta as best you can, so they aren't touching. This way they won't dry sticking together. If you want to dry the pasta for later use, dry for several hours and then store in airtight plastic bags (i.e. Ziploc Freezer or Storage Bags).",

Stir and cook the meat until it is no longer pink. Drain the meat and return it to the pan (draining is optional). Stir in the crushed tomatoes, red wine, Worcestershire sauce, parsley, basil, garlic powder, oregano and red pepper flakes. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Reduce the heat to low. Cover and simmer for 20 minutes.",
      "Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.",
      "Gently stir the finely grated Parmesan cheese into the cooked rigatoni. Stand the rigatoni up vertically in a greased springform pan. You should use the entire pound of the cooked pasta for this.",
      "Gently spread the ricotta cheese on top of the rigatoni in a thin, even layer.",
      "Carefully pour the meat sauce over all. This is the most time-consuming part. With clean hands, use your fingers to carefully push the meat sauce down into the rigatoni. As you push the meat sauce down, you will also push the ricotta cheese into the rigatoni, which will help keep this dish from being dry. The more time you spend on this step, the better results you will obtain - allow your obsessive-compulsiveness to shine! I spent about 8 minutes on this step.",

      "HELPFUL TIPS: Use the rigatoni that is approximately 1 inch long. Make sure you freshly grate your Parmesan cheese because the pasta will not stick together if you use the grated cheese from a green can. Also, as mentioned above, allow your obsessive compulsiveness to shine while pushing the meat sauce down through the rigatoni. The more time you spend on this, the better results you will obtain."

When you lower the temperature, things get interesting and sauces have more time to interact with the flesh. By lowering the temperature to 325 or so, this increases the cooking time to 1 1/2 hours.",

You can also do this but instead of baking, put in a medium hot frying pan with a tablespoon of oil.",

To make the rolls, cut -- don't rip -- a piece of dough from both the light and dark ryes; pieces should be maybe twice the size of a ping pong or golf ball. Stretch each ball into a rope approximately 8 inches long, then squeeze the ropes together into one rope. Gently twist the rope, then form it into a pinwheel shape, pinching the outside end of the rope into the bottom of the roll.",

Pour one cup of dry white wine (or dry vermouth) into the pan and bring the liquid to a simmer. With a wooden spoon or spatula, scrape the pan bottom to loosen the browned bits. Remove the roasting pan from the heat, and strain the liquid into a measuring cup, discarding the solids left in the strainer.",

Heat and stir the fat and flour mixture until bubbling - about 1 full minute, then gradually whisk in the defatted pan drippings, and finally, whisk in the finished sauce made ahead as described above. Reduce heat to a simmer, and simmer the drippings mixture with the sauce for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Taste for seasoning with salt and pepper.",
      "NOTE: As the finished gravy is allowed to stand and cool, it will become thicker. To correct gravy that has become too thick, simply re-heat the gravy, adding water, turkey broth or chicken broth until it has thinned to desired consistency. Taste again for seasonings.
