Using your hands, break up the tuna as finely as you can and whisk this into the mixture. Whisk in the remaining oil. Aside from the chunks of scallions and chives, the sauce should have consistency of aioli. If it seems loose, whisk in some additional grapeseed oil. Season with salt and pepper to taste.",

It's a pretty good product, even if it is sometimes over-proofed, resulting in air bubbles and blistering/blackening edges. Today's dough, however, was great. I turn it out of the bag onto my floured counter, then split the lump in half to make my pizza base and some garlic rolls to go with it.",

I drizzle some EVOO over the dough, then spread out my sausage bits, red onion, minced garlic, and cheeses. I shake some black pepper and oregano over the whole thing, before putting the pan into the oven. My oven's two racks are on the top two slots - as far from the bottom's heating coils as possible - so I place the rolls on the top one (since they need more room to grown), and my pizza on the bottom.

      "Procedures: Select twelve unblemished organically grown small lemons, preferrably Meyer (a small type). Wash and dry the lemons. If using store-bought lemons, scrub them carefully to remove any pesticides. Cut a thin slice from the top and the bottom of each lemon. Set one lemon on end and make a vertical cut 3 quarters of the way through the fruit, so that the 2 halves still remain attached at the base; do not cut it in half. Turn the lemon upside down and rotate it so that you can make a second vertical cut down the center, crosswise to the first, leaving the bottom",
      "Fill each cut with as much salt as it will hold.",
      "Carefully place the lemon at the bottom of a hot, sterilized, wide-mouthed quart glass jar. Proceed in this manner with the remaining lemons, compressing them in the jar until no space is left and the lemon juice has risen to the top. Seal and set aside at room temperature. More lemons may be added in the following days as the lemon rinds begin to soften.",
      "Make sure the lemons are covered with juice at all times, adding freshly squeezed lemon juice if necessary. The lemons are ready to use when the rinds are tender, in 5 to 6 weeks. Rinse them lightly before using. Once opened, refrigerate preserved lemons for up to 6 months."
