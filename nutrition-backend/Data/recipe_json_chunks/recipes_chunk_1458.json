      "Casserole Basics: Glass and ceramic (earthenware) dishes work best for casserole cooking because they heat up quickly and evenly. If you substitute a metal baking pan, the casserole usually cooks more slowly, so you may have to increase the oven temperature by 25\u00b0 to compensate.",
      "Always start with the freshest seafood available and pat it dry. If you use individual steaks or fillets, select pieces that are at least 1 inch thick. If a single fillet from a large fish tapers to a thin end, fold the thin end under to help the fillet cook uniformly.",
      "If the fillet in the casserole is thick, let it sit at room temperature while you prepare the other ingredients for the dish. It will cook more quickly.",
      "Thick fillets or steaks, especially if covered with a sauce or topping, can take from 12 to 15 minutes of baking time per inch. To check for doneness, cut into the fillet at the thickest part to see if it's opaque inside and pulls apart with little resistance.",
      "Casserole recipes calling for fully or partially cooked seafood or fish need only enough time in the oven to get hot, so an instant-read thermometer comes in handy. If the middle of the casserole registers 160\u00b0, it's done.",
      "If you're making a casserole with cooked seafood that's added to a sauce, heat the sauce separately, stir in cold, cooked fish, and then assemble the dish. This will speed up the time in the oven and keep the fish from disintegrating.",
      "Don't cook fish until it flakes easily-- by that point, the fish has given up all of its juices, rendering it dry and leaving a lot of water in the dish. If this occurs, spoon the juices back over the fish when serving.",
      "Remember, the casserole will continue cooking once it's pulled from the oven, so it's better to take it out sooner rather than later."

      "TIPS FOR COOKS Shop: Regardless of variety, all mushrooms should smell sweet and earthy and have dry, firm, undamaged caps. If they're spongy or sticky, steer clear. Store: Keep in a paper bag (storing them in plastic rots them), chilled, up to 4 days. Even if they become completely dry, they'll be fine in stews; the juices plump them back up. Clean: Wipe with a barely damp paper towel. If they're very dirty or sandy, swish briefly in cold water and scrub with a small brush, then dry immediately (they get soggy fast). To cook or not to cook?: Most experts advise cooking all edible mushrooms because, to varying degrees (and depending on the person), they're difficult to digest raw. Also, many have toxins that cooking destroys. However, there's no conclusive proof that eating mild raw mushrooms, especially in moderation, is harmful."

      "Bring a pot of water tot he boil and salt generously 2-3 Tablespoons salt to 6 cups water. Heat oil in pan. Add garlic. Add Aleppo Pepper. The dish is Fra Diavolo, or from the Devil and should be spicy. Add half the herbs, and season with salt pepper. If you are using dried pasta, drop it in the boiling water now. Add the white wine, the mussels and the clams. Cover and let steam until the clams and mussels are just opening, 5 minutes at most. If you are using fresh pasta, drop it now. Add fra diavolo sauce and the rest of the seafood and fish and stir until the fish is just opaque. Add the Fra Diavolo sauce and simmer vigorously, covered, until the fish is done, about 5 minutes. Add the remaining herbs and taste for seasoning. Drain the pasta just short of al dente and add to the pot of fish and sauce. Cook int he sauce for a minute to let it absorb the flavors. Now the pasta should be al dente. Using tongs, divide the pasta into portions and place in bowls or a mussel pot. Twist the tongs as you lift to make the pasta into a compact next. then place all the seafood divided evenly on the top of the pasta and drizzle the sauce over all. Garnish with some chopped parsley. Drizzle a bit of really good olive oil over the top. If you don't want to have pasta, the stew may be served over a slice per person of grilled hearty bread."

      "Meanwhile, for all recipes except jams, wash canning jars, bands, and lids in hot, soapy water, or run jars and bands through a dishwasher and hand-wash lids; drain. If making jam, which has a short processing time, sterilize jars: When water in canner is boiling, place jars on rack, lower into water, and boil for 10 minutes (at elevations of 1,000 feet or higher, add 1 minute for each 1,000-foot increase above sea level). Reduce heat to a simmer and keep jars in water until needed.",
      "Follow manufacturer's directions for preparing lids and bands.",
      "Rinse all fruit and vegetables well.",
      "For pourable foods, such as jam or chutney, quickly ladle hot mixture through a wide funnel into jars, leaving headspace (the distance between top of jar rim and food inside) as recommended. For mixtures involving large pieces such as whole tomatoes, arrange pieces in jars with a spoon, then pour hot liquid through funnel over foods, again leaving headspace as recommended in recipe. (If the last jar isn't completely full, let cool, then serve or chill; do not process.) To release any air bubbles in chunky mixtures, run a clean plastic knife around the inside of the jars (metal knives can damage jars). Wipe jar rims and outer threads with a clean, damp cloth.",
      "Center lids on jars so the red or gray sealing compound is touching jar rims. Using a hot pad, screw bands on firmly, but don't force.",
      "Place jars on rack in canner and lower into water. The water should cover jars by at least 1 inch; if necessary, add more hot water.",
      "Cover canner, return water to a boil (or to 180\u00b0-185\u00b0 for pickles), and process for time specified in recipe; if boiling water starts spilling from canner, reduce heat slightly.",
      "Using tongs and a hot pad, lift rack with jars onto edge of canner. With jar lifter, remove jars and set upright on towels on a counter. Do not tighten bands. Let jars cool completely at room temperature.",
      "Press on the center of each lid--if it stays down, jar is sealed; if it pops up, chill the jar and serve within 2 to 3 weeks (see below). Remove bands. Wipe jars and lids with a clean, damp cloth. If desired, replace bands.",
      "Label jars; store in a cool, dark place for up to 2 years for best quality. Once opened, chill; consume jams, chutneys, and relishes within 3 weeks, pickles within 2 months.",
      "Sunset's Canning Tips:",
      "When making jams and jellies, you can add 1/2 tsp. butter to prevent foam from forming during cooking (see recipes for more details). If you omit the butter, skim off the foam before ladling jam or jelly into jars. The recipe will yield about 1/4 cup less.",
      "Another tip for jams and jellies: Measure all the sugar into a bowl before beginning the recipe. Many canning recipes call for a large volume of sugar to be added when a mixture is already boiling; measuring ahead simplifies this step and prevents mistakes.",
      "Use a ruler to measure volume. Some recipes call for a mixture to be reduced by a certain amount. To ascertain this easily, insert a clean, wood ruler into the pan before cooking and measure how far up the mixture comes. Then cook as directed until it has reduced by the percentage specified. For example, if uncooked mixture measures 4 inches in pan and recipe says to reduce by half, cook it down to 2 inches.",
      "Canning Safely:",
      "Home canning is not complicated, but for success and safety, you must precisely follow the recipes and procedures described here.",
      "Do not double the recipes. If you want to make more, cook successive batches.",
      "Always use the processing method recommended in the recipe. All of our mixtures are sufficiently high in acid to be safe when processed in a boiling-water canner (at 212\u00b0). However, meats, seafood, and low-acid vegetables must be processed in a pressure canner (at 240\u00b0).",
      "Maintain safe levels of vinegar and sugar. Use the recommended amount of commercial vinegar to prevent the growth of harmful bacteria. Using the full amount of sugar called for in jams and chutneys is also vital for safe preservation; plus, it ensures the correct consistency.",
      "For more details on canning safety, visit the National Center for Home Food Preservation (www.uga.edu/nchfp) for an excellent reference on the principles and techniques of canning.",
      "Thanks to Elizabeth Andress, food-safety specialist for the USDA at the University of Georgia Extension Service for sharing technical expertise.",

      "Wine note: No matter how they're prepared, scallops have a flavor that's unique, complex, and earthy, while their texture is almost creamy. And while all sorts of white wines work well, there's a European classic that's not to be missed: albarino. Albarinos are fresh, superlively, and have light peach, citrus, and almond flavors.
