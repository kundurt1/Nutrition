      "Combine all the ingredients for the meat patty.\nUsing fresh meat gives you more leverage over texture and flavour as opposed to frozen meat. If you're mincing the meat yourself, partially freeze the meat before mincing it as this makes it easier to control the fat and prevent it from melting during mincing.",
      "Once the meat mixture is ready, gently portion them depending on the size of the burger buns that you will be using. Remember the meat shrinks when it's cooked so it's best to portion it slightly bigger than the diameter of the burger bun. When you're shaping it, press down on the middle portion of the patty very gently to facilitate better cooking. Sprinkle some salt and pepper on the set patties.",
      "Now for the best part - fire up the grills!\nOil the grill once it's been heated and place the patties on them carefully. When the change in colour from pink to brown is noticeable, flip the patties over and continue grilling. You'll have to be careful at this stage because it could crumble while you're flipping it. It's a bigger mess if it slips through the grills and lands straight on the heat source. Brush the patties with Teriyaki sauce on either side at least once.",
      "While the patties are cooking, saute the sliced mushrooms in some Teriyaki sauce. Right before the patties are set to be assembled between the burger bun slices, toast the sliced buns on the grill. Place a slice of cheese on the patties as you take them off the grill.",

      "Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Break open the heads of garlic, separating the cloves. Do not peel, just flake off the white papery outer skins.\nPlace the unpeeled cloves in a baking dish to fit with a piece of parchment paper (tin foil fine too) underneath. Wrap up, cover tightly with foil and roast in the oven for about 35 - 40 minutes (checking after 30 minutes). The garlic will be starting to burst out of their skins, and be a touch golden in color and soft inside. Remove from the oven, cool 5 minutes. In a small bowl squeeze out all of the garlic, discard the skins. Set aside.\n\nWhile the garlic roasts, start the base of the soup. In a large 2 quart pot (I use enameled cast iron) add the chicken broth, cubes of celery root and potato. Bring to a boil. Crumble the saffron with your fingertips, and place in a small bowl with 1 T. water to bloom.\nWhen the soup has come to a boil, reduce to a simmer and add the saffron, water, tomato paste, smoked paprika, hot pepper flakes (to taste) and the\nsage and thyme sprigs. \n\nSet aside 1 T. of roasted garlic for the rouille sauce. Add the rest of the roasted garlic to the pot.\nWhisk to blend all ingredients, cover and simmer for 20 minutes, or until the vegetable are tender.\nAdd 1 cup of broth and half of the vegetables to the carafe of a blender and puree (careful, will be hot).\nPour the mixture back into the pot, stir up and taste for salt. Reduce the soup just a bit to thicken it.",

      "Rouille Sauce (Garlicky- Mayonnaise)\nIn a small 3 cup capacity bowl, add the reserved 1 T. roasted garlic and the egg yolk, mix well with a whisk. Add the tomato paste, cayenne and a pinch of sea salt. \nMeasure the oil in a measuring cup, drizzle in SLOWLY - drop by drop at the beginning until thickening, then in a steady slow stream. Do not rush.\nAdd the lemon juice and taste for seasonings. For an extra-garlicky assertive flavor, add 1/4 t. minced garlic. Save any extra in a glass, airtight container.",
      "Croutons:\n4 slices of bread from a brioche roll (crusts removed) \n1 T. extra virgin olive oil\n1 small peeled garlic clove\n~ Brush the bread with the oil, bake in a 350 oven until golden and crisp. \nRub immediately with the garlic clove, then discard. Add a sprinkle of salt.\n\nThis recipe may not be reproduced without the consent of it's author, Karen Sheer.",

I let the soup boil until the miso, hot pepper and rice have a chance to create a nice glutinous soup stock, and the pieces of kimchi are almost translucent. The nice green color of the kale will fade, but even with boiling, the kale will remain crunchy. If you don't like your kale a little tough, I suggest brining it before you start the soup (boiling it in salt water for a few minutes.)",
      "I don't generally time how long I get the soup boil for, but about 30-40 minutes should be enough. Again, this is homestyle, and Korean cuisine (at least the way my grandmother makes it) relies more on tasting thoroughout the cooking process that set amounts of time.",
      "Serve hot, with a very cold glass of water or barley tea. You will sweat buckets while eating this, and you might upset some with the pungent garlic-y smell, but it's worth it - it's for your health! I've found this soup and eating kimchi will help vigorously chase the common cold, or whenever your immune system needs a kick in the butt. Kimchi is actually probiotic, much like kombucha."

      "In a large and tall saucepan, combine the remaining 1/2 cup of water, maple syrup, honey and salt. Bring the mixture to a boil over medium-high heat. Make sure you keep a close eye on it, as it tends to foam up pretty quickly. (This is why using a very tall saucepan is helpful!) Place a candy thermometer into the saucepan and continue boiling until the temperature reaches 240\u00b0F (114\u00b0C). This will usually take around 12-14 minutes after it first boils.",

Make sure you cover all of the gelatin with it, so it can melt. After the syrup has been incorporated, turn the mixer up to high and continue beating until the mixture has more than doubled in volume and the marshmallow is slightly cool to the touch. This will take anywhere between 6-8 minutes. If you are using a hand mixer to do this, the process will take slightly longer. To ensure the marshmallow is done, turn off the mixer and lift up the whisk. What should happen is the marshmallow cream should slowly fall off the whisk attachment, a lot like lava. Next, beat in the vanilla and peppermint extracts until combined.",

Carefully lift the marshmallows, using the handles you created with the excess parchment paper, up and out of the baking dish.

      "Measure the dry ingredients into the bowl of a standing mixer attached with the steel blade. Quarter the chilled butter lengthwise and cut crosswise into 3/8-inch pieces; add to the flour along with the chilled shortening. Pulse the mixer 4 or 5 times. Turn the machine on and pour in the water, and immediately pulse the mixer on and off several times. The dough should begin to mass on the blade. If not, drizzle in a little more water and repeat, repeating again if necessary. Dough is done when it has begun to mass; do not over mix it. Scrape the dough out onto your work surface and proceed to the fraisage.",
      "The fraisage (final blending): Place the dough on a lightly floured pastry board. With the heel of one hand (not the palm which is too warm) rapidly press the pastry by two-spoonful bits down on the board and away from you in a firm, quick smear of about 6 inches.",
      "With a scraper or spatula, gather the dough again into a mass; knead it briefly into a fairly smooth round ball. Sprinkle it lightly with flour and wrap it in waxed paper. Either place the dough in the freezer for about 1 hour until it is firm but not congealed, or refrigerate for 2 hours or overnight. (Uncooked pastry dough will keep for 2 to 3 days under refrigeration, or may be frozen for several weeks. Always wrap it airtight in waxed paper and a plastic bag.)",
      "Rolling out the dough: Because of its high butter content, roll out the dough as quickly as possible, so that it will not soften and become difficult to handle. Place the dough on a lightly floured board or marble. If the dough is hard, beat it with the rolling pin to soften it. Then knead it briefly into a fairly flat circle. It should be just malleable enough to roll out without cracking.",
      "Lightly flour the top of the dough. Place rolling pin across center and roll the pin back and forth with firm but gentle pressure to start the dough moving. Then, with a firm, even stroke, and always rolling away from you, start just below the center of the dough and roll to within an inch of the far edge. Lift dough and turn it at a slight angle.",
      "Give it another roll. Continue lifting, turning and rolling and, as necessary, sprinkle the board and top of dough lightly with flour to prevent sticking. Roll it into a circle 1/8-inch thick and about 2 inches larger all around than your pie pan or flan ring. If your circle is uneven, cut off a too-large portion, moisten the edge of the too-small portion with water, press the 2 pieces of pastry together and smooth them with your rolling pin.",
      "The dough should be used as soon as it has been rolled out, so that it will not soften.",
      "Making a pastry shell: Mold your pastry in a false-bottomed, straight-sided cake pan 1- to 1 1/2- inches deep and refrigerate.",
      "Prebaking the pastry shell: Partial baking sets the dough and is a safeguard against soggy bottom crusts. Line the pastry with buttered lightweight foil or buttered brown paper, press it will against the sides of the pastry and fill it with dried beans. The weight of the beans will hold the pastry against the mold during the baking. Bake at the middle of a preheated 400-degree oven for 8 to 9 minutes until pastry is set. Remove mold or foil and beans. Prick bottom of pastry with a fork to keep it from rising. Return to oven for 2 to 3 minutes more. When"

      "Attach the KitchenAid(R) Sifter + Scale Attachment to your KitchenAid(R) Stand Mixer fitted with the wire whip. Close the ingredient valve. Weigh the flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt in the ingredient hopper, taring the scale between ingredients. Turn the mixer to medium-low speed, open the ingredient valve, and sift the flour mixture into the mixing bowl. Turn the mixer off.",
      "In a medium bowl, whisk together the buttermilk, coffee, vegetable oil, eggs, and vanilla extract.",
      "Turn the mixer to medium-low, and pour the liquid ingredients in a slow steady stream down the side of the mixing bowl. Mix just until combined. Be careful not to overmix the batter. Remove the mixer bowl, and use a rubber spatula to blend in any flour remaining on the sides of the bowl.",
      "Gently pour the batter into the prepared cake pan. Bake the cake until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, 40 to 45 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack and let the cake cool in the pan.",
      "While the cake is cooling, make the Kirsch-soaked cherries and whipped cream. In a medium saucepan, combine the cherries, sugar, lemon juice and salt. Bring to a simmer and cook the cherries, stirring frequently, until the sugar is dissolved and the cherries are tender and the liquid is syrupy, about 12 to 15 minutes. Remove from the heat and cool to room temperature. Once cool, add the vanilla and Kirschwasser. Set aside. Just before assembling the cake, strain the cherries, reserving the cherries and syrup separately.",
      "To make the mascarpone whipped cream, combine the cream, mascarpone, sugar, vanilla, espresso powder, and salt in the bowl of your stand mixer fitted with the wire whip. With the mixer on medium-low speed, begin to whip the cream. As the mixture thickens turn the mixer to medium, and then to high, beating the cream until soft peaks form. Set aside.",
      "To assemble the cake, run a table knife around the edges of the pan to loosen the cake. Invert the cake onto a wire rack. Using a long serrated knife, cut the cake crosswise in half to form two thin round layers. Remove the parchment paper. Place one cake layer, cut side up, on a cake plate. Brush this layer generously with the cherry syrup. Using a small offset spatula, spread half of the mascarpone whipped cream over top. Next, arrange three-quarters of the cherries over the whipped cream layer. Place the second cake layer on top, cut side down. Brush the top with cherry syrup. Top the cake with the remaining mascarpone cream, swirling the cream to decorate the top. (The sides of the cake are not spread with the whipped cream.) Mound the remaining cherries in the center of the cake. Shave chocolate over top and dust the surface with Confectioners Sugar. Refrigerate until ready to serve. Cut into wedges to serve.",
      "The cake can be assembled up to 6 hours in advance. (The cake can be baked one day in advance, cooled and tightly wrapped until ready to assemble. The cherries and mascarpone whipped cream can also be prepared one day in advance.) The cake is best when served on the day it is assembled. Refrigerate any leftovers in a covered cake box for up to 2 days."

When ready to cook, let the pork shoulder come to room temperature for 20 minutes and then season each piece of pork with 1 teaspoon of salt. Pre-heat oven to 300 degrees F and position the middle rack to be used. Place the pork in a medium size baking dish and pour in the pork stock, vinegar, and liquid smoke. Roughly chop the carrots and red onions, and lay them around the pork in the baking dish. Tightly cover the dish with tin foil and cook in the oven for 3.5 hours. You will know the pork is ready when it's fork tender.",

When melted, add the flour and constantly whisk(or it will burn) until the mixture is light blonde in color, about 5 minutes. While whisking, slowly add the milk and raise the heat to medium. Keep whisking so no lumps form in the sauce and cook until the mixture thickens up a bit, about 5-7 minutes. You know it's ready when the sauce coats the back of a spoon. Lower the heat to low and add a small handful of cheddar and whisk until it's incorporated, continue doing this with all the cheese. Season with the nutmeg, salt, and check for seasoning. Keep cheese sauce on the lowest heat setting, and whisk it every once in a while.",
