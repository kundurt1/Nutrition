      "2. Melt both chocolates together with the 6 tablespoons of water. Use either a double-boiler or a microwave, stirring every 30 seconds. Stir until smooth, then set aside until room temperature.",
      "3. In the bowl of an electric mixer, beat the butter and 1 1/4 cup of the sugar until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Beat in the melted chocolate, then the egg yolks, one at a time.",
      "4. Sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.",
      "5. Mix in half of the dry ingredients into the creamed butter mixture, then the buttermilk and the vanilla extract, then the rest of the dry ingredients.",
      "6. In a separate metal or glass bowl, beat the egg whites until they hold soft, droopy peaks. Beat in the remaining 1/4 cup of sugar until stiff.",
      "7. Carefully fold about one-third of the egg whites into the cake batter to lighten it, then fold in the remaining egg whites just until there's no trace of egg white visible. Don't overmix!",
      "8. Divide the batter into the 2 prepared cake pans, smooth the tops, and bake for about 40 to 45 minutes, until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.",

      "1. In a small saucepan, heat the sugar and water until the sugar has melted. Remove from heat and stir in the dark rum.",
      "TO MAKE THE ICING:",
      "1. Place the 8 ounces of chopped chocolate in a bowl with the corn syrup and 3 tablespoons of butter.",
      "2. Heat the cream until it just begins to boil. Remove from heat and pour over the chocolate. Let stand for one minute, then stir until smooth. Refrigerate, tightly sealed, overnight. When ready to use, bring to room temperature, and whip to form a spreadable frosting.",

      "Note: This makes enough fondant to cover a standard-sized cake plus anything you could possibly think of to decorate it with. I've never used up the whole batch on one cake.",
      "Start out by microwaving your marshmallow creme for 20-30 seconds, or as long as necessary to loosen it up and help it easily come out of the jar, wasting as little as possible. Scoop the warm marshmallow creme into a shortening-greased bowl with a small rubber spatula.",
      "Add the extract flavoring to the warm creme and stir well. Be sure to use clear-colored flavorings if your fondant will be tinted a light color (or if you need a bright white).",
      "At this point, you can mix in your food coloring. The addition of powdered sugar shouldn't have much of an effect on the base color tint, so you'll have a pretty good idea of what color you're making. It is WAY easier and tidier to tint it at this stage than to knead the coloring in later with your hands. If making multiple colors, divide creme into bowls and tint each bowl.",
      "Next, begin shaking in powdered sugar, stirring after the addition of each cup or two. (A wooden spoon greased with Crisco is a big help for stirring the fondant.)",
      "When the mixture starts to thicken and is no longer manageable with a spoon, cover your clean hands with Crisco and begin kneading. It's a good idea to put the remaining powdered sugar in a bowl or pitcher so you don't have to keep touching the sugar bag with greasy/sticky hands. OR, if you have a high-powered speed mixer, you can use a dough hook to form the fondant without using your hands.",
      "Continue working in small amounts of powdered sugar until fondant is somewhat tacky, but no longer sticky or gooey. You'll probably have a little bit of powdered sugar left from the amount you started with, which is good because you'll need a little bit when you roll it out later.",
      "If you are making the fondant in advance, this is the point at which you can form the fondant into one large blob, cover with as much Crisco as possible, and place it inside a sealed, gallon-sized Ziploc bag, removing as much excess air as possible before sealing.",
      "If using right away, roll out fondant to about 1/4\" thick (no more) and transfer onto a buttercream-iced cake.",
      "Here's a great trick! You can roll it out onto a large piece of parchment or wax paper that's been dusted in confectioner's sugar if you're worried about transferring it to the cake with the pin. Just roll it, flip it over the cake, and peel the paper off."

Whisk in espresso powder, vanilla and salt. Then sift the flour over the chocolate mixture and stir to blend well. Transfer batter to prepared pan and bake brownies until slightly puffed and dry-looking, and tester inserted into center comes out with some moist batter attached. This should take about 20 minutes. Let cool completely in the pan on a cooling rack.",
      "Once cooled, run a knife around the inside edge of the brownie pan. Use the overhanging foil as an aid and gently lift the brownies from the pan. Cut into individual rectangular flag shapes. Mine are approximately 2-1/2\" wide by 1-1/2\" tall.",
      "For the buttercream frosting:",
      "Cook the raspberries in a small saucepan over medium heat, stirring frequently until the raspberries are broken down into a sauce. Set up a fine mesh strainer lined with 2 layers of cheese cloth over a bowl. Pour the raspberry sauce over the cheese cloth to remove the seeds. I gather up the ends of the cheese cloth and gently press out all the raspberry juice to get as much juice out as possible. Pour the raspberry juice back in the pan. Simmer a bit until the juice reduces to 2 tablespoons. It will be a very rich red and concentrated sauce. Set aside to cool completely.",
      "With a mixer, cream the butter with a paddle attachment on medium high speed about 2 minutes, until lightened in color and a bit fluffy. Add half the powdered sugar, lemon juice and salt. Mix until smooth. Add the rest of the powdered sugar and mix until smooth. Measure out 1 cup of the frosting and set aside. To the remaining frosting in the mixer bowl, add the 2 tablespoons of raspberry sauce. Mix well. This will be used for the red stripes on the flag. If you want the red to be deeper in color, add a little bit of red food coloring. (I did.) Mix well again.",
      "If either the white or red frosting seems too stiff, you can add milk, a half teaspoon at a time.",
      "To assemble the patriotic brownies:",
      "Fit a pastry bag with a flat petal tip (I used a Wilton #150 with an opening that is about 1/2\" wide) and fill it with the red frosting. Pipe 2 straight lines, 1 on top and the other on the bottom, onto the brownies as shown in the picture. Repeat until all brownies have 2 red stripes.",
      "Then fit another pastry bag with the same tip and fill it with the reserved white frosting. Pipe 1 line in between the two red lines, as shown in the picture. Repeat until all brownies have a white stripe.",
      "Remove the flat petal tip from the bag with the white frosting and replace it with a small star tip. Squeeze a small amount of frosting onto the brownie where the blueberry will go, and then stick a blueberry on it. Finish by adding a small star to the top of the blueberry with the frosting. Repeat until all brownies have a blueberry with a star.",

Reserve 1 teaspoon of the juice to mix with 1 teaspoon of cornstarch. You may drink the rest. Yum-e!",

Stir frequently until the mixture is golden in color and sticky. This will take about an hour to an hour and a half. Remove the mixture from the heat, and add the cornstarch dissolved in pineapple juice. Or you can use water if you goofed on that step and forgot to reserve the juice. Refrigerate until ready to use.",

Pinch off a bit of jam, about a teaspoon full, and roll it into a ball. Place the jam ball in the center of a cookie, and repeat. You'll have to divide the jam among the 24 cookies.",

      "Note: If you froze your mango for several days, you'll need to let it sit for 15-20 minutes because otherwise it'll be like a rock, and considering you'll need a pretty sharp knife, it would be hazardous to cut! Here is the mango cutting method that I find easy: quarter it lengthwise, peel back the skin, slice it twice more lengthwise and widthwise on the rounded part, and then shave off mango starting at the rounded part and heading toward to seed. Since it's frozen, it is actually easier to cut than a normal mango-but your fingers freeze!",
      "Once cut, place mango in blender or blender cup. Add coconut milk. Blend! Mixture should look almost like ice cream after a few minutes. Squeeze in orange juice and add ginger. Blend again until perfection is reached.",
      "The best way to eat this is somewhere between a smoothie-like consistency and sorbet, hence the name Shmorbet. After blended, pop it back into the freezer for about 45 minutes. Don't leave it in much more than 1 hour as it starts to really solidify and loses some of its shmorbetness. When you are ready, take it out, spoon it up and enjoy! It makes a huge amount for 1, a good amount for 2, and an okay amount for 3. I would upgrade to 1 1/2 or 2 mangoes if you want to serve 4 or more. Another idea is to serve it in little side dishes when you eat spicy Thai or Indian food-it's just the perfect thing to cool you off!"

      "I chop the vegetables that need to be sauteed first such as the celery and onions. I generally chop them in rather large pieces since they shrink during cooking. In fact, I don't like turnips but using a small one makes all the difference in the world in flavor in this recipe. I dice the turnip (instead of chopping it) since I don't care for it. That way, it disappears but improves the flavor.",
      "Using a very large stock pot, drizzle olive oil over bottom of pan on medium high heat. Meanwhile put garlic salt on beef and rub in. When pan is hot put roast in to brown. Brown both sides to a medium brown. I add the celery and onions to the beef as it browns.",
      "During this time, continue chopping the sweet potato, turnip, carrots, and potatoes. Cut the corn off the cob. Leave the skin on your russet potatoes to capture all the vitamins.",
      "By now the meat should be browned. When the meat is brown add the tomatoes and baking soda. The baking soda cuts the acidity of the tomatoes. Add a can of water for each can of tomatoes that you add (4 cans total). If this does not cover the beef vegetable mixture continuing adding water until it is just covered.",
      "Now add all your vegetables to your soup. This is the time to add your soup bones as well. If your grocer doesn't carry soup bones in the meat section you can always ask for them. If they don't have them double your bouillon. The only issue with that is the amount of salt in the bouillon. Cover your ingredients with water (a good two inches or more over) and add your beef bouillon.",
      "Cover your soup with a lid and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to a simmer (it needs to simmer vigorously) and keep it over the heat for 6 - 8 hours. An hour before the soup is done add your frozen vegetables to the soup. Cook a minimum of six hours. I like to have mine on the stove boiling by 10 AM (I also like to sleep late) and have it ready to eat by 6 PM. Again, the longer it cooks the better it is. By the way, I've cooked this and somehow ended up with a weak broth (how?). I fixed that by putting it back on the stove another 4 or more hours. You get all those wonderful vegetable flavors from the fresh vegetables combined with the beef. Yum yum in your tum tum!",
      "Add water as needed if you are losing broth. Keep in mind that this is a soup not a stew. Be careful though, because boiling it too vigorously will cause loss of broth and adding water weakens the broth. There is a fine line between vigorously simmering and boiling. Use your judgement. This is probably the most difficult part of the recipe. Be sure to stir frequently and of course someone must stay home watching the pot on the stove. I have never tried this in the crock pot but I'm sure it would be excellent.",
      "Serve with fresh crusty French bread and plenty of butter. You now have a healthy filling dinner for the family. Guess what? You have leftovers for lunch or dinner too.",
      "If you plan on freezing the leftovers then add only the number of potatoes you think the family will eat. When you reheat add more potatoes. This is just a suggestion. I've done it both ways. The potatoes are the only thing that don't freeze well.",

      "When you are ready to serve, give it another good stir. The end result is a coleslaw that is not only light in terms of dressing, but it is tangy and has this perfect crunch from all of the veggies. The simple additions of the dark green vegetables really bring this coleslaw to life. It goes perfectly with anything on the grill, including delicious ribs. I hope you enjoy."

Allow the cake to cool completely-at least 2 hours.",

      "In a large bowl, thoroughly crumble the cake. Add frosting and mix together with your hands. Be sure to use enough frosting so that the cake binds well together and can hold shape. If it's too crumbly, add more frosting. Using a cookie scoop or small ice cream scoop, scoop/roll/mold an oval shape for kitty's head. Dip the tip of a lollipop stick into some of the melted chocolate and insert into the bottom of kitty's head. Place the heads on the covered baking sheet and refrigerate for about 2 hours.",
      "Once chilled, take two white chocolate chips and dip the bottoms in the melted chocolate. Place/glue them on the top of the head as kitty's ears. Stand them up in a styrofoam block to dry. When the ears are firmly attached to the head, dip the cake pop in a bowl of melted white chocolate. Then remove and gently tap off any extra coating. Stand them up in a styrofoam block to dry. When the heads are completely dry, apply the hearts and sprinkles to make a bow and the yellow rainbow chips to make a nose. Use toothpicks to assist in this process. Once everything is completely dry, draw eyes and whiskers with edible pen or paint on with food coloring."

      "In a large bowl add the flour, remaining 2 tablespoons sugar, salt and butter. Cut the butter into the dry ingredients using forks or a pastry blender until the mixture looks like bread crumbs. Add the yeast and cold milk and stir together with a wooden spoon until the dough forms a ball.",
      "Lightly flour your counter and knead the dough until it comes together a little bit more. Don't knead too much because there will be a lot of rolling and folding done to the dough later. Wrap the dough in plastic cling, but not too tight; since there is yeast in the dough, it will expand. Refrigerate for at least a half hour or up to an hour.",
      "Step 2: Make the Beurrage (Butter Mixture)",
      "Toss the butter with the flour and stick back in the fridge for 20 minutes. Using a mixer, beat the butter with a medium speed until all the butter is smooth and pliable. It must stay cold, too! Wrap the butter in plastic cling and refrigerate until needed.",
      "Step 3: Incorporating the Beurrage with the Detrempe",
      "Lightly flour the counter. Place dough on the counter and lightly dust the top. Roll the dough into a tall rectangle measuring 15x12 inches. Try to make the edges straight and the corners sharp. You can gently stretch the dough to achieve this. Brush off the extra flour. (Extra flour will make for a very dry, tough dough so remember this throughout the whole process.) With your eyes, divide the dough into thirds as if each third was a section of a folded letter. Using your fingers, spread the butter over the top two thirds of the dough, leaving a half-inch border around the outside of the dough.",
      "Step 4: Using the Letter Fold",
      "Fold the bottom third of dough over the middle third of dough as if you were folding a letter. The empty bottom third of the dough will be resting over the butter of the middle third. Finish the letter fold by folding the top third down. Very lightly pinch the seams together and carefully roll your rolling pin over the dough to seal the seams. As long as your butter is still cold, you may proceed with the next step. If not, wrap the dough in plastic cling and return to the refrigerator for an hour.",
      "Step 5: Using the Book Fold",
      "Lightly flour the counter. Place dough on the counter and lightly dust the top. Roll the dough into a tall rectangle measuring 20x12 inches. Dust off extra flour. Fold the two short sides of the dough into the middle leaving a space of 1/4 inch between the two. Then fold both sides together like folding a book. Roll the dough gently to seal the seams. Wrap and refrigerate for 1 hour.",
      "Step 6: Another Letter Fold",
      "Lightly flour the counter. Place dough on the counter and lightly dust the top. Roll the dough into a tall rectangle measuring 20x12 inches. Dust off extra flour. Fold the dough using the letter fold. Gently roll to seal edges. Wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours but no longer than 24 hours. You could freeze for up to a month instead.",
      "Note: This is a really good place to stop for the day. That's what I do.",
      "Step 7: Cutting and Shaping the Dough",
      "Flour your counter then roll out the dough to a rectangle that is 1/4 inch thick, about 26x14 inches. With a sharp knife or pizza cutter, cut the dough into 3 1/2-inch x 4 1/2-inch rectangles. For each rectangle, do the following: visually divide the rectangle into thirds as you did with the letter fold before. Place a half tablespoon of chocolate on the top third and fold the top third over the chocolate to the middle. Place another half tablespoon of chocolate where the top third meets the middle and fold the bottom third over the chocolate. Turn the roll over so that the seam is on the bottom.",
      "Note: The rolls can be frozen at this point. Just cover tightly with plastic cling and freeze for up to a week. Thaw overnight in the refrigerator before moving on to step 8.",
      "Step 8: Egg Wash and Proof",
      "In a small bowl, beat the egg and then add the milk. Brush each roll with the egg wash. Save the egg wash in the fridge. Set the rolls in a cool spot in your kitchen to double in size for 1-2 hours. Don't let them get warm!",
      "Step 9: Baking",
      "Move your oven rack to the center of the oven and preheat to 400\u00b0F. Put the rolls in the refrigerator until the oven is preheated, at least 15 minutes. (You could leave them in the freezer for 10 minutes.) Brush again with the egg wash. Bake for 17-22 minutes, turning the pan halfway through. You know they're done when they are a rich golden brown. Allow the rolls to the rest on a cooling rack before devouring. Drizzle with melted chocolate for a little something extra.",
      "Note: Baked rolls will only last one day, but you must keep them unwrapped. To keep longer, wrap each pain well with plastic then put them all together in a large freezer bag. They can hibernate in your freezer for up to a month! Then just thaw them for about 30 minutes then bake them for 7-8 minutes in a 350\u00b0F oven."

Rinse well while using your hands to separate them.",

      "Spread the peanut butter evenly over the chilled brownies. Press soft cookie dough evenly over the peanut butter, covering the whole surface of the brownies. I found it was easiest to flatten chunks of cookie dough in my hands, then press these dough pancakes onto the peanut butter. Then I went back with bits of dough to fill in the holes. Chill brownies in refrigerator for at least 30 minutes before slicing. Brownies will keep covered and chilled for up to 5 days; they can also be frozen for longer.",

Toss the pine nuts with 1 Tablespoon vegetable oil and put on a cookie sheet (sprayed with non-stick or use parchment paper/silipat mat) in the oven at 425 degrees F for 5-10 minutes or until fragrant and golden brown (you will want to flip them over to get even browning mid-roasting). Remember that because of the oil content in the nuts, they will continue to cook after removed from the oven, so don't leave in too long. **You can also saute the oil/nuts mix over medium high heat for 3-4 minutes, stirring to saute evenly. Let the nuts rest on a few paper towels afterwards.",

      "1. Pour the 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil into the saucer and dip a section of the paper towel in it. Rub the oiled towel over the surface of the erepe pan.",
      "2. Heat the pan over medium heat until it is hot-just as you would if making pancakes-and pour in about 1/4 cup of batter, swirling it around over the bottom of the pan to cover it.",
      "3. In a minute or two, when the bottom is golden and the top is dry, turn the crepe and fry it a little more until that side is golden. Transfer it to the napkin-lined plate, cover it, and continue to make more crepes, wiping the pan with the oiled paper towel between crepes.",
      "A Note: Basically, crepe-making becomes easy with practice. Whatever sort of pan you use, after a few tries, you will figure out the best cooking time, heat and best amount of batter for that pan. Crepes freeze very well. Place them between sheets of parchment paper or waxed paper, and wrap them in a plastic wrap. By separating the crepes between sheets of paper, it is easy to take them out and thaw just as many as you want at a time.",

      "Carefully peel the husks back from the corn (keeping them intact). Remove the silk from each then fold the husks back up over the ears. Lay the ears of corn evenly over the grill (if using charcoal, be sure to leave the area immediately above the coals free of ears of corn.) Grill with the lid closed for about 30-45 minutes, turning and changing the ears' positions about every 5-7 minutes",

      "To serve:",
      "Shuck each ear of corn and top with pats of Chipotle Cilantro Lime Butter, about 1 tablespoon of crumbled queso blanco or Chihuahua cheese and a shower of minced cilantro. Let the butter melt and dribble down the corn and serve immediately. Make sure you wash your hands before eating so you can lick your fingers to get every last bit of that wonderful butter."

Fill at least two-thirds full with pie weights - dry beans, rice, or stainless-steel pie weights. Bake with weights for 20 minutes. Remove from oven, cool a few minutes and carefully remove pie weights. Poke small holes in the bottom of the pie crust with a fork and return to oven (without the weights) and cook for an additional 5 minutes, until the crust is golden. Cool completely before filling. You may need to tent the edges of the pie with aluminum foil when you bake your pie, to keep the edges from getting too dried out and burnt.",

Pour the mixture in the pre-baked pie crust and bake for about 30 minutes. Take from oven, spread the Nutella on top or make decorations with a pastry bag. Sprinkle the coconut flakes on top of the Nutella spread, turn the oven to broil and insert the pie pan for about 5 additional minutes until the coconut is golden brown (be careful to not burn the pie at this point)."

      "First, take care of your leeks! Leeks are filled with dirt, but it's so simple to clean it! Cut the leeks into the about 1/2 inch pieces and simply dump them in a bowl of cold water. Let them swim in there for about 20 minutes. The sand and dirt should sink to the bottom! Prep the rest of your veggies during this time. I made little fancy carrot stars to go with the noodles but this isn't easy and I spent two weeks just on carving vegetables in culinary school. Don't feel like a dunce if you can't or don't have time to do that!",
      "Now is a good time to get started on those noodles! In a large bowl combine the flour and salt. Make a well/hole in the flour, like the center of a volcano and crack the eggs into the hole. Now use your hands to mash the eggs and flour together making a coarse and crumbly mixture. Add the water. Mix again until you have a nice, stiff dough. I like to knead the dough a few minutes to get it nice and smooth. You may need to dust it with a little flour to keep it from sticking to your hands. When you are satisfied with your ball of noodle dough cover it with plastic wrap and allow to rest for about 20 minutes in the fridge.",
      "While they are hanging out in the fridge, you can start working on the soup. Now, you can saute the leeks in the butter and oil. Just saute them until they are soft and then add the garlic cloves, carrots, and celery. With a wooden spoon saute and stir them for about a minute in the butter and then proceed to add the chicken/veggie stock, bay leaf, and water. Let it simmer and fetch your noodles that are hanging out in your fridge.",
      "After the dough has rested, lay it on a lightly floured surface. Using a rolling pin (or my personal favorite, a wine bottle!) roll the dough out thinner than pie crust. Fancy shmancy noodles are made from rolling the dough out until it is almost see-through, but I am not that dedicated. Here, you can make real noodles by using a knife or pizza cutter or do what I did and cut out stars or any other cool cookie cutter shapes you've got laying around.",
      "To cook the noodles, drop them in the boiling broth of the soup. Simmer for 20 to 30 minutes, or until the noodles are tender enough for eating. You can dump the pre-cooked chicken in once the noodles are ready. I would not recommend adding it early on because it can over cook the meat and make it dry. Yes, even swimming in soup, chicken can get dry.",

      "First Rise: In a large bowl, stir together 3 cups of flour with the sugar, salt and yeast. Slowly stir the water into the bowl, scraping down sides and mixing just until the ingredients are thoroughly blended. If too dry, add just enough additional water to blend. If too wet, add just enough flour to produce a soft dough. Brush the top of the dough with butter or spray with vegetable oil and cover. For best flavor, refrigerate for 3-10 hours. Then, let rise at room temperature for 16 to 18 hours, stirring vigorously with an oiled rubber spatula halfway through the rise.",
      "Second Rise: In a medium bowl, stir together the butter, milk powder and 2 tablespoons of the beaten egg until blended (keep the rest of the beaten egg for later). Vigorously mix the butter mixture into the dough until blended smoothly and evenly. Add raisins and gradually mix in 2/3 cup or enough flour to create a hard-to-stir dough. Coat a rubber spatula with spray oil and carefully fold the dough in towards the center, working all the way around the bowl.",
      "Turn dough out onto floured counter or oiled parchment. Dust with more flour if needed and press or roll into a 9x14-inch evenly thick rectangle. Brush some of the beaten egg evenly over the dough to within 1/8 inch of the edge all the way around (reserve the remaining egg for brushing the top of the loaf). Combine the cinnamon and sugar in a bowl. Sprinkle all but 2 tablespoons of the cinnamon-sugar mixture evenly over the dough to within 1/4 inch of the edge all around. Reserve the remainder for the top. Brush with remaining melted butter and blend with egg and cinnamon.",
      "Tightly roll up the dough to form a pinwheel log. Pinch the seam together tightly along the length of the log, then lay seam-side down. Firmly tuck the ends of the log underneath the loaf. Transfer the loaf, seam side down into a well greased loaf pan (I made two loaves in smaller loaf pans). Brush or spray the top with oil. Cover with nonstick spray-coated plastic wrap.",
      "One More Rise: For a 1 1/2- to 2 1/2 regular rise, let stand at room temperature; or, for a 1- to 2- hour accelerated rise, let stand in a turned-off microwave with a cup of boiling hot water inside. Continue the rise until the dough nears the plastic. Then remove the plastic and continue until the dough rises 1/2 inch above the pan rim.",
      "Baking: Preheat oven to 350 F. Brush the dough top with remaining beaten egg and top with remaining cinnamon sugar. Bake on the lower rack for 25 to 30 minutes or until loaf is nicely browned. Cover with foil and continue baking for 25 to 35 minutes longer, testing occasionally with a skewer inserted in the thickest part. Once it comes out with only a few particles on the end, then bake for an additional 10 to 15 minutes to make sure the center is done. Cool in the pan on a wire rack for 10 minutes. Turn loaf onto rack and cool thoroughly."

You'll feel better since you worked out some and you'll feel better about eating the cake when it's done, since you'll have burned some calories.",

      "When making pies, I like to prep my fillings first so that when the crust is done, it can go into the oven more quickly. I usually peel and cut up my apples first, put them in a bowl, coat the slices in the lemon juice, cover the bowl and set aside. You can also do this step after making your crust if you prefer.",
      "Prep your crust dough. In a food processor, or in a large bowl, mix together the flour, salt and powdered honey. Add your butter and pulse until your mixture combines into pea size pieces. Add 4-5 tablespoons cold water in between pulsing and continue until just combined. Add more water if needed. If using a large bowl to make the dough, cut in your butter until pea size chunks form and add water until it's all combined. Add more water if dough is a little dry. The dough should hold together but not be super sticky.",
      "On a floured work surface, divide your dough into 2 equal parts. Roll out the first half of the dough into a 1/8-1/4 inch thick circle. Transfer to a greased pie pan. Roll the other half of the dough to the same thickness. This is the top of your pie to be used after you fill your shell with the apple filling. You can leave the dough in a circle, cut out strips to form a lattice top or use cookie cutters to cut out shapes to cover your pie. Whichever way you prefer, cover the 2 pieces with plastic wrap and set in the freezer to keep cold.",
      "Preheat your oven to 400 F.",
      "Next, start on your filling. In your bowl with your sliced apples, add the lemon juice, if you haven't already, the coconut sugar, honey or agave, molasses, vanilla, cinnamon, salt and nutmeg. Add flour or agave inulin and mix until all of the apples are nicely coated. Pour your filling into your pie crust. Top your pie with the remaining dough and/or cutouts. If you decide to leave your dough in a circle, don't forget to use your knife to cut a few slits in the top, seal the seams together and flute the edges to make it pretty!",
      "Cover pie with a sheet of aluminum foil and bake covered for 30 minutes, then remove the foil and bake for an additional 15 minutes. Then remove it from the oven and let it cool for 10 minutes, cut into slices and enjoy!"

During this time, start skimming the brown foam that comes to the top of your stock and discard that. Continue this process until you no longer have those impurities. Continue cooking the pork for about 2 1/2 hours, until the meat is super tender. Once the meat is cooked, remove the meat from the stock with a slotted spoon and place it in a bowl. Let the meat cool so that you can handle it with your fingers.",
      "Once the chiles have rehydrated, add them to a blender with about 1 cup of the water that they were hydrating in. Add the two cups of chicken stock to the blender, along with the salt, oregano, pepper, and garlic. Blend until you have a very smooth mixture.",
      "If you have a mesh strainer, now is the time to use it. Your goal is to push the blended chile mixture through the strainer into a bowl. You do this in case there are any remaining portions of the flesh from the chile peppers. Pour the chili puree that you have in the bowl into the pork stock and give a good stir. You now have the beginnings of your red stock-the rojo in pozole rojo. Give yourself a pat on the back, and carry onward.",
      "Once the meat is cooled, tear it up into manageable bite size pieces and add it to the stock. Toss in the diced onions, as well as the drained hominy. Give it a good stir, bring it to a simmer, cover and let it simmer for an additional two hours.",
      "Once the soup is cooked, put a couple of good ladles full of the soup into your bowl. Top it with the jalapeno slices, radishes, cabbage, cilantro, and lime wedges. Just use a generous serving of each topping, per your preference.",
      "To eat it... Well, you can probably figure this one out. Get your spoon and tortilla chip ready. Mix the cabbage into the soup, along with some of the radishes and cilantro, and dig in. Every bite is amazing. Tender bites of delicious pork pairs ever so nicely with the subtle heat of the stock. Then you can the tender bites of hominy and the crunchiness of the cabbage and radish. Wow! Comfort in every bite. This batch of pozole can be eaten of the course of a few days, and gets better every day.",

Raise the speed to medium-high and whisk the whites until soft peaks form. Gradually beat in the remaining 3/4 cup of sugar and continue whisking on medium-high until stiff peaks form. Whisk in the vanilla until combined.",
      "Lightly sift the flour mixture over the egg whites, 1/4 cup at a time. With a large spatula, fold in the flour quickly but gently. You don't have to incorporate every speck of flour until the last addition. Once all of the flour has been added fold in the chilled, grated chocolate until evenly incorporated.",
      "Using a long, thin spatula or palette knife; spread a thin layer of the batter along the sides of the pan. This will help to ensure smooth sides when it is done. Empty the remaining batter into the pan. Run a small knife through the batter or tap the pan gently on the counter to prevent air pockets. Then smooth the top surface of the batter.",
      "Bake the cake for 30-40 minutes or until it is golden brown. It should spring to the touch and a toothpick inserted into the center will have a few moist crumbs. During baking, the center may rise above the pan, but it will sink to almost the level of the pan when it is done. The surface will have deep cracks like a souffle.",
      "When it's done remove it from the oven and invert the pan immediately over the wine bottle and allow it to cool, suspended over the counter for 1 1/2 hours. Then loosen around the sides and core of the pan with a long spatula or palette knife. Remove the core. Use your palette knife again to dislodge the cake from the bottom of the core. Invert the cake onto a flat plate that has been covered in plastic wrap which you sprayed with cooking spray. Allow the cake to sit for an hour or until it is no longer tacky to the touch. Cover it with a dome or wrap it so that it's nice and airtight. It will keep for 3 days like this at room temperature or 10 days refrigerated.",
      "For the whipped cream:",
      "Chill the mixer bowl and beater before starting. Then add the cream and vanilla into the chilled bowl and beat on low using the chilled beater until the cream just starts to thicken. Mix the sugar and cocoa together in a small bowl and sift them into the cream. Continue to beat until soft peaks form. Cover the bowl and keep refrigerated until you are ready to frost the cake.",
      "For the assembly:",
      "Using a long, serrated knife, cut the cake horizontally into 3 even layers. Set the bottom layer on your cake plate and place a couple of strips of parchment or wax paper under the edges to keep the plate clean as you frost. Spread about 1/2 inch of cream on the top of the bottom layer. Gently place the second layer on top and repeat the frosting. Add the top layer and frost the top and sides. Sprinkle the top with chocolate pearls. To get the pearls to stick along the sides, pelt them against the sides of the cake. Remove the paper strips from the platter and chill until you are ready to serve.",

It's saves wasting some bananas that are a bit past their prime and using them makes the cake that much better.",
      "Put the bananas into a measuring cup until half thawed then sqeeze the banana \"mush\" out. To get 1 1/2 cups it's about 3 or 4 bananas. Add the lemon juice and mix. Since mine were frozen, I didn't have to mess around with mashing them. Set the mashed bananas aside for the moment.",
      "In another bowl mix the flour, salt, and baking soda. Set it aside while you beat the butter.",
      "Cream the butter and the sugar. I don't whip it too hard but let it go on KitchenAid speed 4 for about 2 minutes - just until it looks nice and creamy pale yellow. Then crack the eggs in there one at a time, but be sure to mix in between each addition. Then add in the vanilla and just stir in. If you're using a mixer be sure to scrape down the sides of the bowl.",
      "Then, if you're like me you have no buttermilk and you forgot to add a tablespoon of lemon juice to the scant 1 1/2 cups of milk (so you have 1 1/2 cups total). Go ahead and do it now and let it sit for a few moments, I won't tell. Or if you already have buttermilk on hand then you are ready to go. Add about a half cup of buttermilk to the butter mixture. Mix on speed 2 until mostly combined then add a bit of the flour. Go back and forth between the two (adding buttermilk and flour mixture to the creamed mixture) until there is nothing left to add. Finally, add in the bananas and give it one final stir.",
      "Pour into a greased (or cooking sprayed) 9x13 inch cake pan. Bake for about 1 hour or until it passes the crumb test. Sometimes it takes a bit longer than an hour. This is okay. When it's done let it cool completely then make the icing.",
      "For the icing:",
      "Throw the butter and cream cheese into the mixer bowl. Beat it until it's all mixed, no lumps or clumps. Add the vanilla. Then reduce the speed (or turn it off!) and add the powdered sugar. Mix it slowly so you don't get a poof of sugar in your face. Once that danger has passed, beat the heck out of it until smooth and delicious. Spread on the cooled cake."
