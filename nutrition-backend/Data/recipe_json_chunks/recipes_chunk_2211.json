      "Not all sourdough is sour-tasting; Amish Friendship Bread and other types of live-yeast breads are also sourdough.",
      "To become a sourdough baker, all you need are some basic ingredients (flour, water, salt, and sugar), some basic tools (a mixing bowl, an oven, and a baking sheet), and a basic interest.",
      "This page is for the novice sourdough baker, but assumes that the reader is familiar with regular yeast-based baking.",
      "If you can make bread, you can make sourdough bread.",
      "There are only a few simple steps to becoming a sourdough baker.",
      "First, you must create a starter: This is a bubbly batter that you keep in your fridge.",
      "The starter is mixed into a dough, and it causes the bread to rise.",
      "Bake and serve.",
      "Yum!",
      "Creating Your Starter",
      "The novel thing about sourdough baking is that it requires that you keep something alive in your fridge.",
      "I think of my starter as a pet, kept and fed so that Sandra and I will have all the bread we need.",
      "Sourdough \"starter\" is a batter of flour and water, filled with living yeast and bacteria.",
      "The yeast and bacteria form a stable symbiotic relationship, and (as long as you keep the starter fed) can live for centuries, a thriving colony of microorganisms.",
      "To make sourdough bread, you blend the starter with some flour and make dough.",
      "The yeast propogates, and leavens your bread.",
      "This is how you make your starter:",
      "Select a container that your \"pet\" will live in.",

      "A wide-mouthed mayonnaise or pickle jar will also do just fine.",

      "You should keep the starter in a warm place; 70 to 80 degrees Farenheit is perfect.",
      "This allows the yeast already present in the flour (and in the air) to grow rapidly.",
      "Temperatures hotter than 100 degrees or so will kill it.",
      "You can take comfort from the fact that almost nothing else will do so.",
      "The way you feed the starter is to (A) throw away half of it and then (B) add a half-cup of flour and a half-cup of water.",
      "Do this every 24 hours.",

      "This is the basic recipe I use, though, and it's simple and makes a fine bread.",
      "You'll need the following:",
      "2 Cups of sponge (proofed starter) 3 Cups of unbleached flour 2 tablespoons of olive oil or softened margarine 4 teaspoons of sugar 2 teaspoons of salt",
      "First, let's talk about leftover sponge.",

      "The leftover sponge is your starter for next time: Put it into the jar, and give it a fresh feed of a half-cup each of flour and warm water.",
      "Keep it in the fridge as above; you'll have starter again next time.",
      "Now, for the recipe: To the sponge, add the sugar, salt, and oil (the oil is optional - you can use softened butter instead, or no oil at all).",
      "Mix well, then knead in the flour a half-cup at a time.",
      "Knead in enough flour to make a good, flexible bread dough.",
      "You can do this with an electric mixer, a bread machine on \"dough cycle,\" or a food processor.",
      "You can also do it with a big bowl and your bare hands.",
      "Keep in mind that flour amounts are approximate; flour varies in absorbency, and your sponge can vary in wetness.",

      "Trust your hands and eyes more than the recipe, always.",
      "Let the dough rise in a warm place, in a bowl covered loosely with a towel (if you're using a bread machine's dough cycle, let it rise in the machine).",
      "Note that sourdough rises more slowly than yeast bread; my starter takes about an hour or so, but some starters take much longer.",
      "Let the dough double in bulk, just like yeast-bread dough.",
      "When a finger poked into the top of the dough creates a pit that doesn't \"heal\" (spring back), you've got a risen dough.",
      "Punch the dough down and knead it a little more.",
      "Make a loaf and place it on a baking sheet (lightly greased or sprinkled with cornmeal).",
      "Slit the top if you like, and cover the loaf with a paper towel and place it in a warm place to rise again, until doubled in bulk.",
      "Place the pan with the loaf in your oven, and then turn your oven to 350o Farenheit and bake the bread for 30 to 45 minutes.",
      "Do not preheat the oven.",
      "The loaf is done when the crust is brown and the bottom sounds hollow when thumped with a wooden spoon.",
      "Turn the loaf out onto a cooling rack or a towel and let it cool for an hour before slicing.",

      "If you double the recipe for two big two-pound loaves of bread, the total price tag will be less than a dollar.",
      "Comments and Notes and Ramblings",

      "Turn the oven on for a minute or so, then turn it off again.",
