Simmer slowly, covered, for 3 hours, stirring occasionally, and adjusting the heat if necessary to keep the liquid from boiling. Remove the ham hocks and remove the meat from the bones. Chop the meat into bite-sized pieces and discard the bones. Using a potato masher, roughly mash the beans in the kettle. The soup should be lumpy. Return the meat to the pot. If the soup seems too thin, boil, uncovered, 10 to 15 minutes, stirring frequently, until the soup has thickened slightly. Saut the onions in a heavy skillet in the butter over moderate heat until richly browned, 10 to 15 minutes. Add the browned onions to the soup and continue to cook, uncovered, for 10 to 15 minutes, stirring frequently. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Serves 8 to 10."
