Let stand for 5 minutes until the yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam. Mix brown sugar, 1 teaspoon of salt, and butter together in a small bowl. Combine the yeast mixture with the brown sugar mixture in a large mixing bowl; stir well to combine. Stir in 1 cup of flour until no dry spots remain. Stir in the remaining 1 cup of flour, a 1/2 cup at a time, mixing well after each addition.",
      "When the dough has pulled together, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes. Lightly oil a large bowl, then place the dough in the bowl and turn to coat with oil. Cover with a light cloth and let rise in a warm place (80 to 95 degrees F (27 to 35 degrees C)) until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.",

Stir in the garlic and onion; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in the chicken thighs; cook and stir for 5 minutes. Pour in the chicken broth and simmer over medium-low heat until the chicken thighs are until no longer pink in the center, about 10 minutes. Stir in the tomato; cook for about 2 minutes.

Coat three equally sized oven safe glass or ceramic bowls with oil and place a piece of dough into each bowl. Take three smaller oven safe glass or ceramic bowls and coat the outside of each bowl with oil. Press the smaller bowl into the larger bowl, leaving about 1/2 an inch between the bowls. Allow bread to rise, while continuously pushing the smaller bowl into the larger bowl, about 10 minutes.",

Fill each bread bowl with the chicken mixture and sprinkle with the remaining Cheddar cheese. Return the filled bread bowls to the oven and bake until the Cheddar cheese melts, about 5 minutes."
