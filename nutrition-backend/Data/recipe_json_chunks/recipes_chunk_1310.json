      "* toss in a penny - when the penny stops clicking you need more water). Dampen a piece of cheesecloth and twist into a strip the length of the circumference of the kettle's rim. Use this strip to fasten the perforated top so that it fits snugly on top. Check all sides for effective sealing: steam should rise only through the holes. Make a bed of parsley over the holes and rest the shoulder of lamb on it. Surround with the onions, if used, and cover with a double layer of cheesecloth and then, tightly, with a lid.",
      "of steaming. Be very careful, and stand back when lifting the lid. If the lamb is tender and falling off the bone it is ready; if not, continue steaming 15 to 30 minutes longer.",
      "3. If desired, brown in oil and butter or rub again with butter and brown in a very hot oven (highest setting). Serve with bowls of ground cumin and salt, to be used as a dip.",

      ", a pungent, naturally curdled product that originated with the Moroccan Berbers. American unsalted butter, while not an exact match, can be successfully substituted.\nThis dish is typically served with couscous, the tiny Moroccan semolina pasta. To produce authentically fluffy Moroccan couscous, steam it for 30 minutes in a couscousiere or tight-fitting, lidless steamer. Then dump it into a flat pan, slowly add 1 cup of salted water, and rake out any lumps with a wire whisk. Finally, return the couscous to the couscousiere and steam it for an additional 30 minutes."

This doesn't take very long: probably around 3 minutes or 5 by hand.",
      "Flour your work surface and turn out your dough. Then divide the dough into 10 roughly equal pieces, each about the size of a golf ball. Take 1 ball and roll it into a rope approx. 1/2 inch thick, then with floury hands divide this into about 20 small pieces, and roll each piece between your hands (flouring them again if this helps) to make marble-sized balls.",

Regulate the temperature and keep a careful eye on the pan and the oil all the time.",
      "Gently lower, using a mesh scoop or perforated spoon, about 15 little dough balls at a time. At first they will sink and then, as they cook, they'll float to the surface and begin to turn golden brown. This will take up to about 1 minute depending on how many you have in at a time, but be ready to fish them out with your mesh scoop or perforated spoon onto the paper towel-lined tray as soon as they become the right golden color. And keep watching your pan.",
      "Continue to cook them in batches-making sure the oil returns to the correct temperature but doesn't get too hot or bubble too vigorously-until they are all fried; you can pile them up on the tray without harm. Now turn off the heat under the oil pan, and move on to the adhesive and assembly stage.",

      "Tip all of the fried dough balls into the warmed honey and, using a soft spatula, turn them gently to coat them. Get out a large plate or cake stand with a slight lip or rim and, with wet hands, check the balls are not too hot then pick up the sticky balls and arrange them around the outer edge of the plate in the shape of a bobbly wreath, leaving just a small empty circle in the middle. Do not worry about symmetry or perfection or counting dough balls here, please.",
      "Wash the honey from your hands and shake your chosen sprinkles over the sticky wreath, then stand back and admire, before placing your creation where others can do likewise. These struffoli are best, to my mind, eaten on the day they're made. Use a scoop or spoon and fork to serve. It will be a sticky affair, but that's part of their charm."

Set on the pot's cover and place in the oven. Cook until the pork registers about 150\u00b0 on a meat or instant-read thermometer-the meat will feel rather firm (not hard) to the touch, and cutting into the center will reveal only the slightest hint of pink.

Spoon the beans and sauce around the meat, sprinkle everything with the crumbled bacon, garnish with herb sprigs, and carry to the table."

Add remaining 1/2 cup flour and pulse until mixture is evenly distributed around bowl and mass of dough has been broken up, 4 to 6 quick pulses. Empty mixture into medium bowl. Sprinkle vodka and water over mixture. With rubber spatula, use folding motion to mix, pressing down on dough until dough is slightly tacky and sticks together. Flatten dough into 4-inch disk. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 45 minutes or up to 2 days. Adjust oven rack to lowest position, place rimmed baking sheet on oven rack, and heat oven to 425 degrees. Remove dough from refrigerator and roll out on generously floured (up to 1/4 cup) work surface to 12-inch circle about 1/8 inch thick. Roll dough loosely around rolling pin and unroll into pie plate, leaving at least 1-inch overhang on each side. Working around circumference, ease dough into plate by gently lifting edge of dough with one hand while pressing into plate bottom with other hand. Leave overhanging dough in place; refrigerate until dough is firm, about 30 minutes. Trim overhang to 1/2 inch beyond lip of pie plate. Fold overhang under itself; folded edge should be flush with edge of pie plate. Flute dough or press the tines of a fork against dough to flatten it against rim of pie plate. Refrigerate dough-lined plate until firm, about 15 minutes. Remove pie pan from refrigerator, line crust with foil, and fill with pie weights or pennies. Bake for 15 minutes.

Set the roasting pan over two burners of the stovetop set over medium heat. Add the flour (or corn starch slurry) and whisk it into the drippings. Stir in the minced giblets. Let cook for a few minutes, stirring while cooking.",

Add 1-2 teaspoons of mustard (to taste). Check for salt and add more salt to taste if needed. Serve it as-is, or puree the gravy in a blender for a smoother texture."

      "Stir the yeast in the warm water and let liquefy completely while measuring flour into mixing bowl. When yeast has liquefied, pour it into the flour along with the salt and the rest of the water.",
      "NOTE: We do not find the food processor satisfactory here, since the dough is so soft the machine clogs; however, you can use a heavy-duty mixer with dough hook, and finish it up by hand.",
      "_Stir and cut the liquids into the flour with a rubber spatula, pressing firmly to form a dough, and making sure that all bits of flour and unmassed pieces are gathered in._Turn the dough out onto kneading surface, scraping bowl clean. Dough will be soft and sticky. Let it rest for 2 to 3 minutes while you wash and dry the bowl.",
      "The flour will have absorbed the liquid during this short rest, and the dough will have a little more cohesion for the kneading that is about to begin. Use one hand only for kneading and keep the other clean to hold a pastry scraper, to dip out extra flour, to answer the telephone, and so forth. Your object in kneading is to render the dough perfectly smooth and to work it sufficiently so that all the gluten molecules are moistened and joined together into an interlocking web. You cannot see this happen, of course, but you can feel it because the dough will become elastic and will retract into shape when you push it out.",
      "Scrape the dough off the surface and slap it down; lift edge and flip it over again, repeating the movement rapidly.",
      "In 2 to 3 minutes the dough should have enough body so that you can",
      ". Continue to knead rapidly and vigoursly in this way. If it remains too sticky, knead in a sprinkling of flour. (Whole kneading process will take 5 to 10 minutes, depending on how vigourous and expert you become.)",
      "Shortly after this point, the dough should have developed enough elasticity so that it draws back into shape when pushed, indicating the the gluten molecules haved united and are under tension like a thin web of rubber; the dough should also begin to clean itself off the kneading surface, although it will stick to your fingers if you hold a pinch for more than a minute or two. Let it rest for 3 to 4 minutes. Knead again for a minute: the surface should now look smooth; the dough will be less sticky but it will still remain soft. It is now ready for its first rise.",
      "You now have approximately 3 cups of dough that is to rise 3 1/2 times its original volume, or to about 10 1/2 cups. Fill the mixing bowl about 10 1/2 cups of tepid water and make a mark to indicate that the level on the outside of the bowl (note that the bowl should have fairly upright sides; if they are too outward slanting, the dough will have difficulty rising). Pour out the water, dry the bowl, and place the dough in it; slip bowl into a large plastic bag or cover with plastic, and top with a folded bath towel. Set on a wooden surface (marble or stone are too cold) or on a folded towel or pillow, and let rise free from drafts anyplace where the temperature is around 70 degrees; if the room is too hot, set bowl in water and keep renewing water to maintain it at around 70 degrees. Dough should take at least 3 hours to rise to 10 1/2 cups; if the temperature is lower, it will simply take longer.",
      "(*) DELAYED ACTION: See chart at end of recipe.",
      "When fully risen, the dough will be humped into a slight dome, showing that the yeast is still active; it will be light and spongy when pressed. There will be usually be some big bubbly blisters on the surface, and if you are using a glass bowl you will see bubbles through the glass.",
      "The dough is now ready to be deflated, which will release the yeast-engendered gases and redistribute the yeast cells so that the dough will rise again and continue the fermentation process.",
      "and turn out onto a lightly floured surface, scraping the bowl clean. If dough seems damp and sweaty, sprinkle with a tablespoon of flour.",
      "Lightly flour the palms of your hands and",
      ", deflating any gas bubble by pinching them.",
      "Do the same with the left side, then the right side. Finally lift the near side and tuck it just under the edge of the far side. The mass of dough will look like a rounded cushion.",
      "Slip the sides of your hands under the dough and return it to the bowl. Cover and let rise again, this time to not quite triple, but again until it is dome-shaped and light and spongy when touched.",
      "(*) DELAYED ACTION: See chart at end of recipe.",
      "Loosen dough all around inside of bowl and turn out onto a lightly floured surface. Because of its two long rises, the dough will have much more body. If it seems damp and sweaty, sprinkle lightly with flour.",
      "or whatever is specified for other shapes and sizes.",
      "place dough at far side of kneading surface. Cover loosely with a sheet of plastic and let rest for 5 minutes before forming. This relaxes the gluten enough for shaping, but not long enough for the dough to begin rising again.",
      "While the dough is resting, prepare the rising surface: smooth the canvas or linen toweling on a large tray or baking sheet, and rub flour thoroughly into the entire surface of the cloth to prevent the dough from sticking.",
      "Because French bread stands free in the oven and it is not baked in a pan, it has to be formed in such a way that tension of the coagulated gluten cloak on the surface will hold the dough in shape. Following are illustrated directions for the familiar long loaf-the",
      "(baked size 16 by 3 inches); other shapes are described and illustrated at the end of the recipe.",
      "are much too long for home ovens.",
      "After the 3 pieces of dough have rested 5 minutes, form one piece at a time, keeping the remaining one covered.",
      "Working rapidly, turn the dough upside down on a lightly floured kneading surface and",
      "Deflate any gas bubbles in the dough by pinching them.",
      "Being sure that the working surface is always very lightly floured so the dough will not stick and tear, which would break the lightly coagulated gluten cloak that is being formed,",
      ", and roll the dough a quarter turn toward you so the seal is on the bottom.",
      "Now, by rolling the dough back and forth with the palms of your hands, you will lengthen it into a sausage shape.",
      "Deflate any gas blisters on the surface by pinching them. Repeat the rolling movement rapidly several times until the dough is 16 inches long, or whatever length will fit on your baking sheet. During the extention rolls, keep circumference of dough as even as possible and try to start each roll with sealed side of dough down, twisting the rope of dough to straighten the line of seal as necessary. If seal disappears, as it sometimes does with all-purpose flour, do not worry.",
      "(The top will crust slightly as the dough rises; it is turned over for baking so the soft, smooth underside will be uppermost.)",
      "Cover dough with plastic while you are forming the rest of the loaves.",
      "baking pans, or books, if the dough seems very soft and wants to spread out. Cover the dough loosely with a flour-rubbed dish towel or canvas, and a sheet of plastic. Proceed immediately to the final rising, next step.",
      "The covered dough is now to rise to almost triple in volume; look carefully at its pre-risen size so that you will be able to judge correctly. It will be light and swollen when risen, but will feel still a little springy when pressed.",
      "It is important that the final rise take place where it is dry; if your kitchen is damp, hot, and steamy, let the bread rise in another room or dough will stick to canvas and you will have difficulty getting it off and onto the baking sheet. It will turn into bread in the oven whatever happens, but you will have an easier time and a better loaf if you aim for ideal conditions.",
      "Preheat oven to 450 degrees 30 minutes before estimated baking time.",
      "(*) DELAYED ACTION: See chart at end of recipe.",
      "The 3 pieces of risen dough are now to be unmolded from the canvas and arranged upside down on the baking sheet. The reason for this reversal is that the present top of the dough has crusted over during its rise; the smooth, soft underside should be uppermost in the oven so that the dough can expand and allow the loaf its final puff of volume. For the unmolding you will need a non-sticking intermediate surface such as stiff piece of cardboard or plywood sprinkled with cornmeal or pulverized pasta.",
      "Remove rolling pins or braces.",
      "Dough is now lying along one edge of the umolding board: rest this edge on the right side of a lightly buttered baking sheet. Gently dislodge dough onto baking sheet, keeping same side of dough uppermost: this is the soft smooth side, which was underneath while dough rose on canvas. If necessary, run sides of hands lightly down the length of the dough to straighten it. Unmold the next piece of dough the same way, placing it to the left of the first, leaving a 3-inch space. Unmold the final piece near the left side of the sheet.",
      "The top of each piece of dough is now to be slashed in several places. This opens the covering cloak of gluten and allows a bulge of dough underneath to swell up through the cuts during the first 10 minutes of baking, making decorative patterns in the crust. These are done with a blade that cuts almost horizontally into the dough to a depth of less than half an inch. Start the cut at the middle of the blade, drawing toward you in a swift, clean sweep. This is not quite as easy as it sounds, and you will probably make ragged cuts at first; never mind, you will improve with practice. Use an ordinary razor blade and slide one side of it into a cork for safety; or buy a barber's straight razor at a cutlery store.",
      "As soon as the dough has been slashed, moisten the surface either by painting with a soft brush dipped in cold water, or with a fine-spray atomizer, and slide baking sheet onto rack in upper third of preheated oven. Rapidly paint or spray dough with cold water after 3 minutes, again in 3 minutes, and a final time 3 minutes later. Moistening the dough at this point helps the crust to brown and allows the yeast action to continue in the dough a little longer. The bread should be done in about 25 minutes; the crust will be crisp, and the bread will make a hollow sound when thumped.",
      "If you want the crust to shine, paint lightly with a brush dipped in cold water as soon as you slide baking sheet out of the oven.",
      "Cool the bread on a rack or set it upright in a basket or large bowl so that air can circulate freely around each piece. Although bread is always exciting to eat fresh from the oven, it will have a much better taste when the inside is thoroughly cool and has composed itself.",
      "Because it contains no fat or preservatives of any kind, French bread is at its best when eaten the day it is baked. It will keep for a day or two longer, wrapped airtight and refrigerated, but it will keep best if you freeze it-let the loaves cool first, then wrap airtight. To thaw, unwrap and place on a baking sheet in a cold oven; heat the oven to 400 degrees. In about 20 minutes the crush will be hot and crisp, and the bread thawed. The French, of course, never heat French bread except possibly on Monday, the baker's holiday, when the bread is a day old.",
      "After each bread session, if you have used canvas, brush it thoroughly to remove all traces of flour and hang it out to dry before putting away. Otherwise the canvas could become moldy and run your next badge of dough."

When the oil is very hot, lay the pieces skin side down, an inch or so apart-watch out for oil spatters. Don't crowd the chicken: if necessary fry it in batches, similar pieces (like drumsticks) together.",

Let the chicken fry in place for several minutes to brown on the underside, then turn and continue frying until they are golden brown on all sides, 7 to 10 minutes or more. Fry breast pieces, only for 5 or so minutes, taking them out of the oil with tongs as soon as they are golden.

Knead the dough, by hand (10 minutes) or by machine (5 minutes) till it's smooth.

However, we found that as they rise and bake, they pop open at the seam and lose their shape, due to the fact the melted butter doesn't allow the dough to form a tight seal. Our preferred method is as follows: Deeply crease each circle, slightly off center, with a dough scraper or bench knife. Pinch off a 1/2-teaspoon piece of the softened butter and smear it along this crease, then fold the smaller \"half\" of dough over the larger half. The edges won't quite meet. Pinch the dough to form a good, tight seal, cover the rolls with lightly greased plastic wrap, and allow them to rise for about 1 hour. They won't double in bulk, but will become somewhat puffy; if you let them rise too much, they'll pop open in the oven.",

      "Bake the rolls in a preheated 400\u00b0F oven for 10 to 12 minutes, or until they're a light golden brown. Remove them from the oven, and allow them to cool on a rack till they're almost completely cool; while they're still very slightly warm, place them in a closed container, such as a plastic bag.

      "2. Put the oven on broil and the bacon on a rimmed cookie sheet. Position the cookie sheet about 4 inches from the coil. They will spend 2 minutes under the broiler. Then flip them. You want them cooked but not crunchy. They need to be soft and pliable.",
      "",
      "3. Place a skillet on med/low heat with a dab of butter and oil. When skillet is hot place the bread in the skillet next to each other. Let it cook for about 30 seconds to 1 minute before flipping. You want the bread to begin to brown just a little. After flipping pour remaining egg white mixture over the top of the two pieces of bread, connecting them. Wait a minute or so and then flip again.",
      "",
      "4. Form the bacon into a circle and place in middle of the bread to make a little circle. Then place the egg yolks in the middle of the bacon circles. Though bacon is delicious. The main purpose for the bacon is to keep the yolks from rolling off the bread into the skillet. Next drape the cheese over the top of the bacon, covering the yolks.",
      "",
      "5. Now pour the wine into the skillet and cover. The wine should steam immediately, melting the cheese, cooking the yolks and preventing the bottom of the toast from burning. This should take about 30 seconds to 1 minute.",
      "",
      "6. Last, if you so desire, add some hot sauce before plating. This recipe can be cut down by changing all the main ingredients to 1 instead of 2. I've been playing with this recipe for a couple of years. If you have any suggestions please post them. Have fun."

Add Black Beans to skillet and mix with the corn, heating only 1 minute longer (you only want the black beans to get warm). Empty Romaine into a large bowl. Add Chicken, Corn and Bean mixture, and tomatoes. Crumble tortilla chips in your hands and add to salad. Drizzle the salad with both Ranch Dressing and BBQ sauce and toss. We prefer a 1/2 and 1/2 ratio, but you can dress to taste. I use a reduced or low-fat ranch because you really don't miss the taste with the mixture of BBQ sauce and it makes the salad a little lighter."

Taste the cream for the desired level of salt and pepper. Whisk the eggs in a stainless bowl and temper them with the hot cream. Remove the bay leaves. Place the roasted cauliflower in a baking dish and pour the hot cream and egg mixture over it. Stir to ensure everything is coated evenly. Cover with aluminum foil and bake for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, mix the panko breadcrumbs, gruyere cheese, and parsley in a bowl. Remove the foil from the baking dish and sprinkle the breadcrumb mixture evenly over the gratin.

Pat the dough into a 9- inch square pan, press evenly into a greased 9-inch square pan, and top it with the reserved onion mixture. In a small bowl whisk together the egg, the sour cream, and salt and pepper to taste, pour the mixture over the onion mixture, smoothing it with a spatula to cover the onion mixture evenly, and bake the bread in the middle of a preheated 450 degree oven for 20-25 minutes or until it is cooked through. Cut the bread into squares and serve it hot"

Continue kneading on low for about 8 minutes. The dough may still not form around the dough hook. Scrape the dough off the dough hook and add the yeast mixture. Knead on low speed until the dough feels smooth and elastic, yet still fluffy and soft, about another 10 minutes. It will remain sticky.",
      "On a lightly floured work surface, shape the dough into a ball, dust a large bowl lightly with flour, and add the dough. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and leave in a warm place to rise until doubled in size, about 2 hours. When ready, the dough will not spring back when poked gently with a finger.",
      "Punch the dough down and turn it out onto a lightly floured work surface. Cut the dough into 12 evenly sized pieces (about 2 1/2 ounces each). Under cupped palms with stiff fingers, roll the pieces into tight balls. They should stick a little bit to the counter to create tension, so use very little to no flour on the countertop. Cover with a kitchen towel and let rest for about 15 minutes.",
      "To shape the bretzels, work sequentially, completing each step with all the dough. This allows the dough to rest and makes it easier to work. As you work, if the dough seems to fight you and doesn't stretch out, just let it rest for a few minutes and then continue. Line 2 baking sheets with nonstick baking mats or parchment paper.",
      "Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F. Roll each ball into a log about 6 inches long. Then roll each of these into a long, thin rope about 30 inches long, tapering the ends to points, and immediately shape it and arrange it on the prepared baking sheet.",
      "To make the classic twisted pretzel shape, pick up the tapered ends of the 30-inch-long roll and cross your hands, right over left. The end that was on the right is now on the left. Repeat for a second twist. To complete the classic pretzel shape, lift the tapered ends and drape them over the sides of the bretzel, at 10 o'clock and 2 o'clock. You can leave the tips on top or flip the bretzel over, covering the ends with the sides of the bretzel. Either is correct. Your finished bretzel should be about 5 inches wide with very large openings to fill the pastry cream.",
      "Meanwhile, scrape the warm pastry cream into a pastry bag fitted with a large round tip. As soon as you have shaped a bretzel, pipe the pastry cream into the open spaces of the bretzels, overfilling them so the cream mounds above the dough. This helps prevent the dough from springing back on itself. With a wet finger, smooth any points left by the piping. Set the bretzels aside in a warm place to rise, about 30 minutes.",
      "In a small bowl, whisk the egg yolk with 1/2 teaspoon water. With a pastry brush, brush the dough only with the egg wash. Bake until medium brown, about 20 minutes, rotating the pans front to back and top to bottom about halfway through. Let the bretzels cool for a few minutes on the baking sheets.",
      "Mix the powdered sugar in a bowl with just enough water to make a thin sugar glaze and brush it onto the breads. Let the bretzels continue to cool on the baking sheets until the pastry cream has firmed up. I like them best still warm from the oven (a privilege of living above a pastry shop), but they taste very good for the whole day."
