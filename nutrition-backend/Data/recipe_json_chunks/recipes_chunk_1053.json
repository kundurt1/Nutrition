However, if you wish to make this a one-day jam process, you can just skip the maceration and start cooking straight away at step 7 after combining the chopped/mashed berries and sugar).",
      "Before you hull the berries, wash them. You wash them before you hull them so they will not absorb excess water.",
      "Hull the berries and measure out 4 pounds. Take one pound of berries and mash them with a potato masher ( you may want to chop them first to make this process easier). Take the remaining 3 pounds of berries and halve them or quarter them if they are very large.",
      "Mix the mashed berries and the halved berries together in a large (10 to 12 quart) stainless steel stock pot (do not use aluminum as the berries may react with it).",
      "Add the sugar to the berries in the pot and mix well to combine. Cover well and let sit for 8 hours on your kitchen counter.",
      "After 8 hours have passed, bring the berries to a boil over high heat, stirring occasionally. You want them to come to a full boil. Be careful once the mixture reaches a boil, as it will more than double in volume (this is why I say to use a large stock pot). Once they have reached a boil, take them off the heat, stir and cover. Let them rest on the counter for another 8 hours or overnight.",
      "Day 2:",
      "TIP: 1 ounce = 2 tablespoons, you may be more comfortable measuring out the lemon juice and vinegar this way.",
      "Add the lemon juice, balsamic vinegar, and lemon zest to the sugar/strawberry mixture, and mix well to combine.",
      "Place two or three small saucers in the freezer. You will use these later to check the set of the jam.",
      "Pour the strawberry mixture into an 11 to 12 quart preserving pan or other wide, non-reactive kettle. If you do not have a preserving pan, use the widest non-reactive pan you have. The wider the pan, the more quickly moisture will evaporate from the mixture, and this is what you want when you are making jelly, jam, or marmalade.",
      "Bring the mixture to a boil over high heat, stirring frequently to make sure it is not sticking to the bottom of the pan. Continue to cook over medium-high heat for 30 minutes, and continue to stir every two minutes or so to make sure the jam is not sticking to the bottom of the pan.",
      "After the jam has cooked for 30 minutes, take it off the heat and place a drop of the jam mixture (try to get the \"jelly\" part of the mixture, avoiding the berries; I use a 1/4 teaspoon measure to dip out the drop) on one of the saucers you've kept in the freezer, & place the saucer back in the freezer for 3 minutes. After 3 minutes, take the saucer out of the freezer and tilt it vertically to see how quickly the jam runs. If it runs quickly, the jam is not ready and needs to be cooked longer. If it runs slowly, nudge the drop of jam with your finger. If it \"wrinkles\" or pushes up when you nudge it with your finger it is done. If the jam is not set, continue cooking over medium-high heat, checking the set again every 5 minutes.

      "When the jam is set, mix in the teaspoon of butter, stirring well until it is completely melted into the mixture and all the foam on the jam has subsided. Continue to stir for 1 minute to make sure the berries are well distributed throughout the jam.",
      "Ladle the jam into sterilized canning jars, leaving 1/4\" headspace. Wipe the rims of the jars with damp paper towels to remove any jam which got on the rims or the threads. Place the lids and the bands on the jars, just tightening the bands fingertip tight.",
      "Process in a boiling water bath for 5 minutes, then remove and let sit, undisturbed, for at least 12 hours before checking seals. It is important to let them sit undisturbed for 12 hours because the sealing compound on the lids is still cooling and hardening, completing the seal. While the jars cool, you will hear a \"plink\" type sound from each jar - this is the jars completing the vacuum seal as the final air escapes the jar. After 12 hours have passed, remove the bands and check the lids - press down in the center of the lid. If you cannot push the lid down any further, the jar is sealed. If the lid \"gives\" a bit, and you can push it down, the jar did not seal. You can either put the band back on the jar, and reprocess it for another 5 minutes, or you can just put it in the fridge and use it within 3 months."

    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "To start you will need three main ingredients. You can add others to add more flavor or texture, but the main three you need to make rice are: Oil, rice, and seasoning. Today I used a vegetarian seasoning that is very flavorful and also commonly used in Spanish rice. It contains no animals products so for all my vegetarians out there please know that you can still eat flavorful food if you are vegetarian or vegan. The seasoning I used is called Sazon Goya con Azafran (sassafras). Sassafras is what what gives the rice that traditional \"yellow rice\" color seen in Spanish dishes. My only warning is that because sassafras is yellow, this seasoning will give your fingers a yellow color. And please do not wear any clothes that you don't want splashed with yellow drops. I always try to wear and old shirt when I use this seasoning, and definitely not anything white!",
      "Now let's get to talking about some of the secrets you need to know if you want authentic tasting Spanish rice. The first secret is that you need to use a specific type of rice. You want to use parboiled rice. If you use a different type of rice, the rice will either turn out super mushy, or it will take forever and ever to cook, and probably turn out undercooked or overcooked and mushy. Parboiled rice is a very important for ingredient for restaurant quality rice.",
      "The second secret is that you want to cook, or \"toast\", the rice in hot oil BEFORE you add water to it. This helps to harden up the rice and prevent it from being super mushy or watery when it's finished cooking.",
      "The third secret is not mandatory but helps to add flavor. It is sauteing vegetables, such as onions and tomatoes, in the hot oil before you toast the rice. This flavors the oil and when you toast the rice in it, the rice absorbs even more flavor. You can saute pretty much any vegetables you like. In the pictures below you see me sauteing onions and a tomato together in oil, then toasting the rice in this oil before I add the water.",
      "Once you have toasted your rice for a minute or two, you are now free to add your water. It is better to add less water than more, and you can always add more water if you need it, but if you start by putting way too much water in, it will ruin the rice and reduce the flavor of it. I like to add a little water as I go, so when the rice looks like it has soaked up all the water and still isn't tender enough, I add a little more, and keep going until the rice tastes tender enough. Then I just cover the pot and turn the stove off, and let the rice continue to cook slowly for a little longer until somebody wants some. My family like butter in their rice, so sometimes I will add a few pats of butter into the cooking rice, but this is not necessary and abuelita would not approve of this, so this is really up to you to do this.",
      "If your rice doesn't come out perfect, don't panic! After a few times of making it you should be a pro!",
      "Buen Provecho!"

You may have to do this and the next step in two batches if your mixer bowl is not large enough to hold all the ingredients without overflowing.",
      "With the mixer still on low speed, add remaining 1/2 cup of the sour orange juice and enough chicken stock to make a soft, moist dough (about 7 cups added intermitently between mixing). It should be almost like the texture of mashed potatoes but thicker. Increase the mixer speed to medium-high and beat for 2-3 minutes to incorporate some air into the masa and make it fluffier. Cover the bowl and set the masa aside to rest for at least 30 minutes.",
      "After the resting period, place the masa in a large pot and on medium heat, stir the masa slowly and constantly for about 20 mintues adding 2 more cups of water or chichen stock (1/2 cup every 5 minutes for the 20 mintues of stirring). Remove from heat and set aside.",
      "Drain the marinade from the pork and set aside. Heat oil in large frying pan on high heat. Once it is heated, add the cubed pork and brown for abour 3 minutes (being careful of splattering oil). Set aside and let cool for about 5 minutes Reserve pan juices from pork in another bowl.",

Put about 4 pieces of pork on top of the masa and sprinkle 1 or 2 tablespoons of rice over the pork. Lay 5 or 6 pieces of potato on top of the pork, add 1 table spoon green beans/garganzo beans, add 1 olive and add a little bit of the pan juices from the pork. Top off with 1 or 2 cilantro leaves.",
      "Fold the top edge of the banana leaf down over the filling. Bring the bottom edge of the banana leaf up over this. Then fold in both sides to make a rectangular package. Be careful not to wrap it too tightly or the filling will squeeze out. Flip the package over so it is seam side down.",

      "Add 2 or 3 inches of water to a tamalera or pot large enough to hold all the nacatamales. (You may have to use two pots if you don't have one big enough to hold the nacatamales in one batch.) Place a rack in the bottom or toss in enough wadded up aluminum foil to hold the nacatamales mostly out of the water. Add the nacatamales and bring to a boil over high heat. Cover tightly, reduce heat to low and steam for about 3 hours. Add more water as needed to keep the pot from boiling dry.",
      "Once cooked, drain the water and let tamales rest for atleast 2 hours in the pot so that the masa can become firm.",

But keep in mind that there is no authentic recipe so PLEASE do not compare MY recipe to other recipes as I am sure everyones is different. It is very helpful to others if you rate according to your experience and result with this particular recipe. Thanks and enjoy!"

      "You want the ice cream to be JUST softened enough to scoop out. If it's too soft, it's a pain and squeezes out the sides of the cookies to much. Scoop about 1/3 cup of your favorite ice cream onto the flat side of 12 cookies and top with the other 12 cookies. Press down lightly so the ice cream squeezes out to the edges. I use a small butter knife to smooth it out all the way around. Put your sprinkles or whatever decorations you're using into a small, shallow but wide bowl or saucer. Roll the ice cream sandwiches through the sprinkles like a wheel kind of and the sprinkles will easily stick to the ice cream around the edges. See photos.",
      "Freeze at least 1 hour (really, I'm serious! You have to freeze them at least an hour or the ice cream will squeeze out the sides when you eat them) and then wrap the 1 or 2 that you haven't eaten (ha, ha) in plastic wrap for a midnight snack."

      "Cook potato in skin until soft (like for potato salad). When ready peal the skin and mash potato on flat surface. Be careful it is very hot.",
      "Add butter (crush it a bit to speed melting), flour, semolina, nutmeg and salt. Make it into a dough, and when cools it a bit add two eggs. You will think now that you make a big mistake because it will turn very wet, but you have to be firm and continue to make dough. It is OK to add more flour.",
      "The right amount of flour will be clear to you after you make this several times, this is amount I usually put. It also depends on quality of potato; some are softer than others. When the dough is firm, but soft enough, make the dumplings.",
      "Cut a piece of dough and roll around cleaned and washed plum. The dough shouldn't be more than 1 cm thick. If you make it without plum stone, break the plum into half, remove the stone and put a sugar cube instead. After that, do as previously mention.",
      "At this point you can freeze the whole amount of dumplings, but do it on flat surface making sure they don't touch. After they freeze, you can put them in a bag.",
      "If you want to cook them right away, use large pot, fill with water up to 2/3 and add some oil. When water boils, put the dumplings into the water and cook until they start to float on the surface. You may use a toothpick to check if they are soft.",
      "In the meantime melt butter in a frying pan and fry some breadcrumbs. When removing dumplings from the pot put them into hot butter with breadcrumbs and fry them just a bit to reduce surplus of water.",
      "You may serve them as a desert, but also as a lunch, of course amount of dumplings will differ in both cases.",
      "When you open the dumplings, you may put some sugar over it and also some grounded cinnamon. Some people add sour cream over dumplings, but I don't like it that way."
