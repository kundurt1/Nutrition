      "Important tip: For incrased macaron success, pleast take the time to weigh and/or measure out all of your ingredients and have them organized and ready to go before you start mixing. While this is a good tip for any recipe, it's especially helpful the first few times you make these macarons as you are getting your bearings around the recipe.",
      "In a food processor fitted with a steel blade, combine almond flour and powdered sugar. Run the food processor for about 30 seconds until sugar and flour are nicely combined. Sift through a fine mesh strainer into a medium-sized bowl and set aside.",
      "Place room temperature egg whites into a stainless steel mixing bowl (I don't use my stand mixer for this, I think it's a little easier to just bust out the hand mixer). Turn beaters to medium speed and whip until bubbles start appearing and it becomes frothy and opaque. Slowly sprinkle in superfine sugar to incorporate into egg whites. Turn beaters to high and whip until medium stiff peaks and meringue is nice and shiny. If you would like to add color to the shells, now is the time!",
      "Once meringue is ready, take the bowl with the almond flour and sugar mixture and add half to the meringue. Fold and scrape the mixture with a rubber spatula until flour is incorporated, then add the rest. Add spinkles. Continue scraping the bowl and folding the mixture until batter falls off the spatula in thick ribbons (yes, this is an insane description, but it's everywhere and truly is the best way to describe it). The mixture should settle into itself in a few seconds after falling off the spatula. Do not overmix.",
      "Note: This is a great time to search Youtube to watch someone making macarons so you can see for yourself exactly how the batter is supposed to look!",
      "Once batter is nice and ribbony, prep the piping bag. I like to shove mine into a large plastic tumbler, and pull the edges of the bag around the outside like a teeny trash bag. Pour the batter into the cup, and once it's done, pull up on the bag to let the batter fall to the bottom. At this point, you can fit the piping bag with a tip if you want- but I am a big fan of the Wilton 16-inch Disposable Decorating Bags and then I just cut the tip off the bottom of the bag.",
      "Once batter is ready to roll, twist one end of the pastry bag and hover over your prepared baking sheets. Keeping the bag straight up and down, pipe even circles into rows with the batter spaced about 1 inch apart. For evenness, I like to count in my head \"one, two\" while I pipe to make sure I am making the same size. There will be variation- that's ok! Remember this is FUNfetti.",
      "Once batter is piped and things are looking good, give the sheet a good 4-inch drop onto the work surface. This gets out any pesky bubbles that might be lurking under the surface, threatening your macaron glory. I do this a couple of times. Sprinkle with, well, sprinkles. Set aside to dry.Put them on a counter and set a timer for 15-20 minutes to let the batter set up. You'll know they're ready for the oven when you can barely touch one and your finger comes away dry.",
      "While macarons are drying out, preheat oven to 300\u00b0F and make sure racks are set to the upper middle and lower middle positions.",
      "Once the macs are ready (see? Having so much fun now we are calling them by nicknames!), place in the oven and set the timer for 10 minutes. At the 6- or 7-minute mark, rotate and swap the position of the sheet pans to ensure even cooking. You'll want to stick around and not leave the kitchen during this time. Don't become too distracted! You don't want the macarons to brown at all. Overcooked macarons are no bueno.",
      "Once macarons are done, remove from oven and set to cool on a wire rack for 15 minutes. Once cool, carefully remove from the parchment paper (sometimes I use an offset spatula to make sure I am getting them off just right). Set them aside to cool completely, and match them up into pairs by size.",

      "First, make the crust. Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F and spray a 9-inch springform pan really well with cooking spray. Get out a food processor and process the biscotti until they become fine crumbs. Transfer the crumbs to a bowl and stir them with the melted butter and cinnamon until it resembles wet sand. Press the mixture into a firm bottom layer in the prepared pan and bake it for 15 minutes to set it. Take it out and let it cool. Reduce the oven heat to 325\u00b0F.",
      "While the crust cools, make the filling. Get out a small saucepan and combine the espresso powder and chocolate liqueur in it. Heat it over medium heat and stir it to dissolve the espresso powder into the liqueur for just a minute. Don't let it come to a boil. Set it aside. Then get out a stand mixer and combine the cream cheese and sugar in its bowl. Beat them together thoroughly, until fluffy. Add in the eggs one at a time. Then pour in the liqueur mixture and heavy cream, pushing down the sides occasionally. Let the stand mixer beat the mixture really thoroughly until it is completely smooth.",
      "Pour the cheesecake mixture on top of the cooled crust and smooth it out on top. Then wrap the springform pan in aluminum foil snuggly and place it in a large roasting pan. Pour warm water into the roasting pan around the springform pan about 1/3 of the way up the sides, taking care to not get any on the cheesecake. The foil protects the pan from water getting into the cake too. This creates a steam bath to gently bake the cake without it cracking on top. Bake the cheesecake for an hour and a half. Take it out and let it cool for about 45 minutes. Then refrigerate it for at least 4 hours, up to overnight. When you are ready to serve, sprinkle a generous layer of cocoa powder on top and slice it! Enjoy!"

      "Notes:",
      "1. This recipe can be made by hand or with a kitchen mixer. If using a kitchen mixer, use a dough hook or paddle attachment. A dough hook is the best choice for mixing this bread dough.",
      "2. A kitchen scale is a great tool to help portion the dough out evenly.",
      "3. Cutting a cross in the top quarter of each bun will allow for more nooks and crannies for the garlic oil. Be careful not to cut too deep.",
      "4. This recipe can also be used to make garlic knots. Divide the dough evenly into 20 pieces and shape each piece into a rope and then a knot. Place the garlic oil into a small bowl and dip each knot into the garlic oil to cover completely. Place each knot on a parchment covered baking sheet and finish the same as the instructions for the buns. If any garlic oil remains after the second application, you can drizzle it over the baked knots for extra flavor.",
      "Substitutions:",
      "1. Parsley can be substituted for the chives. I prefer to stay within the same flavor profile of garlic, so I use chives. You can also omit the chives entirely.",
      "2. If you do not have grated parmesan cheese, a light sprinkling of fine sea salt is a great and, also, economical substitute to get a kick of saltiness on the top of the buns."

The potatoes definitely had a nice heat to them, but I want to see if I can get the rosemary to be more of the dominant flavor. However, if you love spice (or if you're cooking for someone who does), you might think they're just fine the way they are."

Mix, check the consistency, too dry? Add some more! Place the chicken salad in the fridge to allow it to chill and let the flavors make friends. Now the most complicated part: Open the bag of salad and get a strainer. Put the lettuce in the strainer and rinse it well. If you have a salad spinner, use it to dry the lettuce. If no salad spinner is handy just use some clean dishtowels to GENTLY dry the lettuce. Just lay one on the counter, spread the lettuce on it and lay another clean dishtowel on top. There are many ways that you can arrange butter lettuce and chicken salad for a beautiful presentation. Should be served cold."

Make savory pancakes with any leftover wild rice by adding it to your favorite pancake batter along with thinly sliced green onions. Be sure to reduce the sugar in the batter and serve the pancakes with savory brown gravy.",

      "4. This chicken salad pairs well with many wines. My favorite pairings are fruit forward Bordeaux style red wines, buttery California Chardonnays, and crisp Rose wines."

      " One of the secrets of making a nice omelette is not to use too large of a pan. The goal is an omelette that is thick, but cooked through. This method of cooking an omelette results in a thick fluffy omelette every time. Another secret is to not skimp on the butter. It gets incorporated into the omelette while drawing the sides in, adding flavor, and giving the outside of the omelette a nice golden color.",

We liked our Belgian waffle iron set to somewhere between 80% and 90% of the full dial. Pour mix onto hot waffle iron and let it ooze out to the edges of the iron. Our waffle iron uses slightly less than 1 cup of batter per waffle. Then shut the top lid (some batter will probably run over the edge) and let the waffle bake. No peeking! Your waffle iron should be emitting quite a bit of steam now, and you need to pay attention to it. When that steam significantly decreases/stops, your waffle is ready. This took about 4 minutes from the time we shut the lid."

      "6. While marshmallows are in the microwave, put 1/2 cup shortening in a mixing bowl.",
      "7. Add 2 pounds minus 1/2-1 cup of SIFTED powdered sugar to the mixing bowl.",
      "8. Once marshmallows are done, stir them up a little bit to soften more and mix with the water.",
      "9. Take softened marshmallows and add to mixing bowl with the sugar.",
      "10. Using a mixer and dough hook, position hook so that the mixture does not go over dough hook. You may have to keep the head of mixer lifted to prevent hook from being buried. If you have a \"splatter\" guard put it in place - you will be happy you did. Turn mixer on slowest speed.",
      "11. As it is mixing, you want to \"knock\" the powdered sugar off sides of bowl. Powdered sugar may \"dust\" up and this is where the \"splatter\" guard will be helpful. Continue mixing.",
      "12. If you want to color the fondant all one color, add coloring now.",
      "13. Increase speed as necessary.",
      "14. Once ingredients are mixed, stop mixer and lift dough hook out of bowl. Use your fingers to get mixture off dough hook - mixture is very sticky.",
      "15. Pour mixture out onto your work surface. Be sure to get all remaining pieces from mixing bowl.",
      "16. Start kneading just like you would bread dough.",
      "17. As you knead it the texture will change. If you have mixture sticking to the countertop, use a pastry scraper to remove it. Unlike bread dough, fondant needs a lot of kneading to get to a soft and non-sticky ball. You do not want mixture to be sticky after kneading. If it gets too dry, add shortening to the mixture in 1/8 teaspoon increments (or you can add water if shortening doesn't work).",
      "18. When you have a soft smooth consistency you're done. You need to double wrap it in cling wrap to keep air from getting to it.",
      "19. You can store it out on the counter for a couple of weeks. If it is going to be longer than that, put it in the refrigerator. When you are ready to use it, you can re-soften it by putting in microwave for a few seconds at a time so that it is soft and you can then re-knead it."

      "3. Divide dough evenly into 12 balls, cover with damp towel. Heat cast iron comal to high or med high heat.",
      "4. Using the tortilla press lined with either plastic or parchment, press each ball to approximately 1/8 of an inch thick. Carefully peel back plastic or parchment, and place on comal.",
      "5. Cook one side for 30 seconds, flip and cook other side for 30 to 60 seconds (edges will curl, small brown spots may appear), flip again and cook first side for additional 30 to 60 seconds.",
      "6. Transfer tortilla to rest between two damp towels to steam. When you are finished, transfer tortillas to a tortilla warmer, or keep covered with a damp towel.",
      "~Additional Notes!~",
      "~You don't have to own a corn tortilla press, but I love mine. It gets the job done perfectly. If you have a Mexican Grocery near by, check for them. I paid $8 for mine, it's not fancy or brand name, but it works perfectly fine. It is made of cast iron, and you will want to wash it thoroughly and let it dry.",
      "~You can use a good ole cast iron skillet, but it you have a flat griddle - cast iron of course, you can use that. I have heard of them referred to as a comal, but I need to check on that. I thought a comal was a specialize clay baking disc used in Mexico. Maybe the term applies to both! Also, make sure it is wiped clean of oil. You want the cast iron dry.",
      "~If you are cooking your tortillas right away, you can cut 2 plastic circles (from a freezer bag) the size of your press. Use these plastic circles to line the press. Place the dough between the two circles and then press.",
      "~If you want to reserve the dough to cook a couple hours later, you could cut 24 - 8 inch parchment squares. Press dough between squares, set aside and cover with a damp cloth. I have read that you can make dough this way up to 4 hours ahead of cooking.",
      "~I set my comal on high heat for about 7 minutes before using. You will have to experiment with your stove settings and how quickly your tortillas cook. You may need to adjust you heat to medium-high.",
      "~I now add one extra step to the end of my tortilla making process that makes all the difference to us. I keep damp towels in a bowl, and as I cook each tortilla, I then place it under a damp towel. This step steams the tortilla, making them soft and pliable instead of dry.",
      "~If you have left over tortillas (we rarely do), spray or brush lightly with water, and heat on comal for 10 seconds or each side. This should bring them back into a pliable state. This is also how we prepare store bought corn tortillas.",
      "~There are a few other ways to further prepare corn tortillas for other uses, but for now, this is how we mostly use corn tortillas at home.",

      "3. Slowly add the dry ingredients in 3 batches. If you don't have ground flax seed you don't need to add it, simply add an additional 1/2 cup of either white or wheat flour. You can also adjust the amounts of whole and white flours, the total amount must equal 3 cups of some type of flour (either flax, white, or wheat).",
      "4. After all the ingredients have been mixed by hand, add the zucchini and any chocolate chips or dried fruit.",

Loaves take around 60-70 minutes, muffins around 20 minutes. Insert a toothpick in the center; if it comes out clean then they are done.",

Bake them on the same rack of the oven for 15 minutes, until golden brown on top and fluffy. Let them cool a few minutes, then transfer them to a rack to cool completely.

      "Note:",
      "Any yellow or red onions will do, as I realize not many people will be able to use the sweet, squat Cannara onions I used. The bread should be stale, coarse-textured country style Italian bread so it will hold up to being baked with broth without turning mushy. As for the broth, you can use canned beef broth if you must, but honestly, if you make your own it will be better. I wasn't sure what the cheese was used in the dish I had in Arezzo but it melted nicely into the soup, so I used Fontina along with a little grated Pecorino for flavor.",
      "This dish even tasted better the second day so it really is a dish you can make ahead of time and reheat.",
      "It is difficult to give exact amounts for the ingredients listed as it depends on the type and size of onions you use, the size of your bread slices, as well as how much broth your bread absorbs. Do use enough broth to cover most of the ingredients, leaving just the top layer of onions uncovered (see photo). I used a 25 X 35 cm casserole dish for my dish in the photo."

      "2. Avocados are also easier to cut and peel when they're cold. They need to be sliceable, so make sure you choose one that's not too hard, not too soft.",
      "3. I like to cut the avocado on a slight bias rather than straight up and down. This makes them easier to stack and a little more attractive.",
      "4. If the grapefruit pieces keep sliding off the avocado, they're probably too thick. You can slice them thinner lengthwise if you're worried about presentation.",
      "5. It's not necessary but I prefer to bake the ricotta salata, which removes some of the moisture and makes it easier to shave. To bake: Place in a 350 F oven on a sheet tray for 45 minutes. The edges will be golden brown. Slice away all sides and shave it with vegetable peeler}.",
      "6. This salad can be made ahead of time and stored in the refrigerator. I often do that.",
      "This recipe is largely inspired by the Cara Cara Salad recipe that Chef Carmen Quagliata makes every winter at Union Square Cafe in New York City."
