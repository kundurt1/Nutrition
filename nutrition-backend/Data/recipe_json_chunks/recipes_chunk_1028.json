The water doesn't need to run completely clear, but it should not be very cloudy or brownish when the rice is washed. Leave the rice in the strainer to drip out for at least a few minutes.",
      "Put the rice and water in a saucepan with a tight-fitting lid and bring just to a boil over high heat. You don't want it to really boil, as soon as you start to see the bubbles, put on the lid and turn the heat down to very, very low (on my electric stove, I put it between \"lo\" and 1).",
      "Resist the temptation to take off the lid and check the rice too much. After about 25 minutes you can check it once and see how much water is left. I do this by sticking a wooden spatula down into the rice and pushing it to the side a little. If there is still water, push the rice back together, put the lid back on, and let it cook a few more minutes. Do not stir or disrupt the rice any more than you have to. It will take about 30 to 35 minutes for it to finish cooking.",
      "When all the water is absorbed, there will still be sort of a mushy layer at the bottom of the pot. Take the pot off the heat and leave undisturbed for at least 10 minutes. You can really leave it there as long as you like -- the moisture at the bottom will even out and the finished rice should be slightly al dente with all the grains separate.If there are a few clumps, just break them up with a fork or your fingers before serving or storing.",
      "If you plan to use the rice for fried rice, I would recommend refrigerating it for at least 6 hours, but overnight is better, so plan ahead!"

Something about the length of a boning knife is best. Hold corn over a large skillet (best to prop the ear of corn against the bottom of the pan, and begin cutting the kernels, so that they fall into the pan. Once all kernels are removed, take the back of a butter knife, and scrape it against all sides of the corn, you'll notice pulp and a milky liquid, keep scraping until nothing is coming out, then turn the corn so you are holding the tip, with the stem end in the pan, and repeat this process. Don't worry it's impossible to scrap the ear too much. Repeat with the remaining corn.",
      "Add the butter and bacon drippings to the pan, and add the cup of water. If one cup doesn't cover the corn, just add a little more, til the corn is just barely cover with water. Add a few dashes of salt and a dash of pepper.",

      "Let it boil about 10 to 15 minutes, then reduce heat to the lowest setting your stove has. Remove the lid and continue to cook, until all water is absorbed and/or evaporated. I recommend tasting the corn, just before you start to cook down the water, and decide if it needs more butter or salt, and if necessary add a bit more to taste. Personally I've never measured the amount. My granny taught me this recipe and she never measured anything. This final cooking stage is very important, you want to cook it slow, to help the natural sugar in the corn start to caramelize a bit. Once the water gets pretty low, you want to keep a close eye on it, and stir often. You'll notice when it's close to done, you'll be scraping sort of a thick juice from the bottom of the pan. (my best quess is this is the caramelized fluid, but also the stuff that you scraped from the ears)."

      "Move the dough to a lightly floured surface and knead it by hand for 5 minutes. Gently shape the dough into a loose ball, cover it with plastic, and let it rest on the table for 20 minutes. NOTE: This is a soft, moist dough. If the dough seems too stiff and hard to knead, add extra warm water 1 tablespoon at a time until you get a nice malleable dough.",
      "Gently knead the dough on the lightly floured surface for 1-2 more minutes, or until it becomes smooth, supple, and elastic but not too firm (The texture of the dough should be soft but springy). Shape the dough into a loose ball, place it in a lightly oiled bowl, and turn to coat the top with oil. Cover it tightly with plastic wrap and let it rise at room temperature about 1 1/2 to 2 hours (until doubled).",

Whisk until the mixture looks silky and a little lighter in color.",

      "Meanwhile, position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F Bake for 30-35 minutes, until the tops of the buns are golden brown and crusty (It's important to bake the buns long enough so the dough is cooked all the way through and the caramel topping develops properly).",
      "Set the pan of buns on a rack to cool for 5 minutes. Then quickly but carefully transfer the buns onto a heatproof plate. Immediately drizzle any remaining caramel from the bottom of the pan and spread it on the tops of the buns, filling in any bare spots (or drizzle with honey).

JUST A QUICK NOTE ABOUT THIS STEP -- The longer the dish sits, the thicker the dish will be after baking. Setting it aside for at least 20 minutes will result in a cobbler-like consistency. But if you prepare this dish in advance (several hours to even a day ahead of time) and letting it chill in the refrigerator (covered) will result in a thicker, quiche-like consistency.",
