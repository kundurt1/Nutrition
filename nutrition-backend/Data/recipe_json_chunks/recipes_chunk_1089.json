      "Cream together the sugar, salt, and shortening or butter on medium-high speed in an electric mixer with a paddle attachment (or use a large metal spoon and mixing bowl and do it by hand); if you are using powdered milk, cream the milk with the sugar, and add the water with the flour and yeast. Whip in the egg and lemon extract/zest until smooth. Then add the flour, yeast, and milk. Mix on low speed (or stir by hand) until the dough forms a ball. Switch to the dough hook and increase the speed to medium, mixing for approximately 10 minutes (or knead by hand for 12 to 15 minutes), or until the dough is silky and supple, tacky but not sticky. You may have to add a little flour or water while mixing to achieve this texture. Lightly oil a large bowl and transfer the dough to the bowl, rolling it around to coat it with oil. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap.",
      "Ferment at room temperature for approximately 2 hours, or until the dough doubles in size.",
      "Mist the counter with spray oil and transfer the dough to the counter.",
      "(A) Roll out the dough with a rolling pin, lightly dusting the top with flour to keep it from sticking to the pin. Roll it into a rectangle about 2/3 inch thick and 14 inches wide by 12 inches long for larger buns, or 18 inches wide by 9 inches long for smaller buns. Don t roll out the dough too thin, or the finished buns will be tough and chewy rather than soft and plump. (B)Sprinkle the cinnamon sugar over the surface of the dough and (C) roll the dough up into a cigar-shaped log, creating a cinnamon-sugar spiral as you roll. With the seam side down, cut the dough into 8 to 12 pieces each about 1 3/4 inches thick for larger buns, or 12 to 16 pieces each 1 1/4 inch thick for smaller buns.).",
      "For cinnamon buns, line 1 or more sheet pans with baking parchment. Place the buns approximately 1/2 inch apart so that they aren t touching but are close to one another.",
      "For sticky buns, coat the bottom of 1 or more baking dishes or baking pans with sides at least 1 1/2 inches high with a 1/4 inch layer of the caramel glaze. Sprinkle on the nuts and raisins (if you are using raisins or dried fruit.) You do not need a lot of nuts and raisins, only a sprinkling. Lay the pieces of dough on top of the caramel glaze, spacing them about 1/2 inch apart. Mist the dough with spray oil and cover loosely with plastic wrap or a food-grade plastic bag.",
      "Proof at room temperature for 75 to 90 minutes, or until the pieces have grown into one another and have nearly doubled in size. You may also retard the shaped buns in the refrigerator for up to 2 days, pulling the pans out of the refrigerator 3 to 4 hours before baking to allow the dough to proof.",

If you are baking sticky buns, remember that they are really upside down (regular cinnamon buns are baked right side up), so the heat has to penetrate through the pan and into the glaze to caramelize it. The tops will become the bottoms, so they may appear dark and done, but the real key is whether the underside is fully baked. It takes practice to know just when to pull the buns out of the oven.",
      "For cinnamon buns, cool the buns in the pan for about 10 minutes and then streak white fondant glaze across the tops, while the buns are warm but not too hot. Remove the buns from the pans and place them on a cooling rack. Wait for at least 20 minutes before serving. For the sticky buns, cool the buns in the pan for 5 to 10 minutes and then remove them by flipping them over into another pan. Carefully scoop any run-off glaze back over the buns with a spatula. Wait at least 20 minutes before serving.",
      "White fondant glaze for cinnamon buns.",
      "Cinnamon buns are usually topped with a thick white glaze called fondant. There are many ways to make fondant glaze, but here is a delicious and simple version, enlivened by the addition of citrus flavor, either lemon or orange. You can also substitute vanilla extract or rum extract, or simply make the glaze without any flavorings.",
      "Sift 4 cups of powdered sugar into a bowl. Add 1 teaspoon of lemon or orange extract and 6 tablespoons to 1/2 cup of warm milk, briskly whisking until all the sugar is dissolved. Add the milk slowly and only as much as is needed to make a thick, smooth paste.",
      "When the buns have cooled but are still warm, streak the glaze over them by dipping the tines of a fork or a whisk into the glaze and waving the fork or whisk over the tops. Or, form the streaks by dipping your fingers in the glaze and letting it drip off as you wave them over the tops of the buns. (Remember to wear latex gloves.).",

    "title": "red velvet cheesecake-cake",
    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "1. Prepare the cheesecake layer: Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Place a large roasting pan on the lower third rack of the oven. Place a kettle of water on the stove to boil. Spray a 9-inch springform pan with nonstick spray and line the bottom with a round of parchment paper. Wrap a double layer of foil around the bottom and up the sides of the pan (you want to seal it so the water from the water bath doesn't seep into the pan). In a large bowl, use an electric mixer to mix the cream cheese- blend until it is nice and smooth and creamy. Mix in sugar and salt and blend for 2 minutes, scraping down sides of the bowl as needed. Add eggs, one at a time, blending after each addition. Finally, mix in sour cream, whipping cream and vanilla. Mix until smooth. Pour the batter into the prepared pan. Set the pan into the roasting pan in the pre-heated oven. Carefully pour the hot water from your kettle into the roasting pan (it will fill the pan surrounding the cheesecake). Pour enough water so that there is about an inch of water coming up the foil along the sides of the cheesecake pan. Bake the cheesecake for 45 minutes. It should be set to the touch and not jiggly. Remove the cheesecake from the roasting pan and let it cool on a wire rack for at least an hour. When it has cooled, place the pan into the freezer and let the cheesecake freeze completely. This can be done in several hours- or overnight.",
      "2. Prepare the cake layers: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Grease and flour two 9-inch round metal baking pans (or spray with nonstick baking spray with flour). In a large bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking soda and salt. Add eggs, oil, buttermilk, food coloring, vanilla and vinegar to the flour mixture. Using an electric mixer on medium-low speed, beat for 1 minute, until blended. Scrape sides and bottom of bowl with a rubber spatula. Beat on high speed for 2 minutes. Spread the batter evenly into the prepared pans, dividing equally. Bake 30 to 35 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out with a few moist crumbs attached. Let cool in pans on a wire rack for 10 minutes. Run a knife around the edge of the pans, then invert cakes onto a rack to cool completely.",
      "3. Prepare the frosting: In a large bowl, using an electric mixer on medium-high speed, beat powdered sugar, cream cheese, butter and vanilla until it is smooth and creamy (do not overbeat).",
      "4. Assemble the cake: Place one cake layer into the center of a cake plate or platter. Remove the cheesecake from the freezer, take off the sides of the pan, and slide a knife under the parchment to remove the cheesecake from the pan. Peel off the parchment. Measure your cheesecake layer against the cake layers. If the cheesecake layer turns out to be a slightly larger round than your cake, move it to a cutting board and gently shave off some of the exterior of the cheesecake to get it to the same size as your cake layers. Place the cheesecake layer on top of the first cake layer. Place the 2nd cake layer on top of the cheesecake.",
      "5. Frost the cake: Apply a crumb coat layer to the cake- use a long, thin spatula to cover the cake completely with a thin and even layer of frosting. Be sure to wipe off your spatula each time you are about to dip it back into the bowl to get more frosting (this way you won't be transferring any red crumbs into the bowl of frosting). Don't worry at this point about the crumbs being visible in the frosting on the cake. When your cake has a thin layer of frosting all over it, place it into the refrigerator for 30 minutes to \"set\" the frosting. Once the first layer of frosting is set, apply the 2nd layer. Start by adding a large scoop of frosting onto the top of the cake. Use a long, thin spatula to spread the frosting evenly across the top and then spread it down the sides of the cake too. Because you applied a crumb-coat layer, you shouldn't have any red crumbs floating around in the final frosting layer. Decorate, as desired. I recommend white chocolate shavings (see *Tips below). Keep this cake refrigerated."

I usually do this by putting the chicken strips in a big zip-top bag with the flour in it, and shake until all of the chicken pieces are evenly covered with flour. Next, drop the chicken strips in the beaten egg. Again, I do this all at once. Just make sure the egg is in a big bowl, dump all of the chicken strips in, and evenly coat. Lastly, dip in cornstarch. This time the process is a little more precise, so I take about one-third of the strips and toss them in a zip-top bag with cornstarch. Lay them on a wire rack to prep for frying, and repeat the process. This method is pretty messy, and if you have another way of doing it, feel free to do it! =).",

Once they are evenly goldish-brown, and appear to be crispy, remove them from the oil and lay on a wire cooling rack lined with paper towels to allow the excess oil to drain off of them. Set aside and make the sauce.",
      "For the sauce, combine all ingredients, except for cornstarch and 3 tablespoons of water, in a food processor. Blend until the ingredients are well combined, and garlic and jalapeno is finely minced into the liquid. Next, place the mixture into a medium saucepan, and simmer over medium heat for about 5 minutes. Combine the cornstarch and water in a separate container to form a thick paste. Incorporate paste into the simmering sauce. Whisk together, until the sauce starts to thicken slightly. Remove from heat, and toss in pineapple chunks (or use fresh pineapple if you prefer it).",
      "In a large skillet, heat the sauce to a simmering, and add the fried chicken strips. Simmer for about five minutes, or until all of the chicken strips are well coated and reheated (if they were set aside to cool for a long time). Serve over white rice, or by itself.

As all I had were 8 inch tortillas when I made these, I cut my tostada shells down to 3 inches using a sharp knife. As a result, I had sort-of \"mini crunchwraps\", so don't judge the size of your crunchwrap based on my pictures.",
      "As the cheese needs to go nearest to the outside, and beans don't spread well on cheese, it works best to spread the beans on the tostada shell rather than the tortilla. Pre-heating the beans will also make them easier to spread, and help to melt the cheese (just zap them in the microwave quickly).",
      "If you plan to use beef, invert the instructions below, and sprinkle the cheese then the meat onto the center of the tortilla first instead.",
      "If you really want to do everything properly, add 1/2 Tbsp water to your sour cream, and put it into a condiment squeeze bottle for easy application.",

Mix well and then add the steak. The longer the marinating time the better. I love to let it marinate all day. I make it before I go to work and then cook it when I get home. You need at least 3-4 hours to get a good flavor but all day gives it great flavor.",
      "Dressing -- Simply mix the mayonnaise, roasted red peppers and basil and set to the side in a small bowl and refrigerate. Make this ahead.",
      "Steak -- Now the steak is ready to grill, but remember -- room temperature Never grill cold meat. Set it on the counter to take the chill off as your prepare the tomato relish. This steak can be done on a outside grill which is ideal. Or you can use your inside grill pan which I use quite often. You can also use a cast iron or saute pan if you don't have the other options. I suppose a George Foreman type of grill would work too. So lightly oil your cooking utensil and heat to medium high.",
      "Relish -- As the steak is coming to room temp and the grill is heating up, chop up your vegetables (tomatoes, onions and artichokes) and add the pre chopped olives and mix them all together in a small bowl with the salt and pepper. NOTE: I only use 8 oz of the artichokes so I don't drain the whole can, only those which I am using. A little oil from the artichokes in the can is all it needs to flavor the relish. I just add 1/2 teaspoon or so which gives the relish a good flavor. And make sure to go easy on the salt as olives are quite salty.",
      "Grilling -- Just grill your steak on medium high heat. It should only take 4-5 minutes per side at the most. I like mine to medium rare, but you can cook it to whatever temperature you like. Medium rare -- remove and 125, cover and let set 4-5 minute as you prepare the flat breads. Now mine, since store bought, I just drizzle on some olive oil and a little oregano and brush on each side of the flatbread and grill on the same pan as my steaks for just a minute to warm up. If making your own, follow your recipe, again brushing with the olive oil and oregano as they grill.",
      "Finish -- Lay out the flat bread and spread with the roasted red pepper, basil and mayonnaise. Then top with slices of the skirt steak (remember to always slice against the grain for tender steak) on one side of the bread, then top with a few spoons of the tomato relish and some fresh spinach. Fold over and secure with a tooth pick. ENJOY!",
      "This is a hearty sandwich, so I try to stay away from serving it with fries or onions rings, although you could. But I would rather serve with some oven baked zucchini planks with a light dip, a fruit salad, or a bowl of soup to start. One of my favorites is a beer cheese soup or roasted cauliflower soup."

Heat about 2 tablespoons of bacon grease or margarine in a large iron skillet over medium high heat. When the fat is hot, it's time to drop in the fritters. Drop about 1/4 cup of batter for each fritter, cooking about 3 or 4 together in the sme pan. Fry them like pancakes, turning them, after the underside is crispy brown. They cook a little slower than pancakes, because they are thicker. After they have browned on both sides, transfer them to a plate to keep warm. Add more fat to the pan as necessary.
