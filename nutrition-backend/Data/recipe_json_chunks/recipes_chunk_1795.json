      "I followed the directions exactly, only adjusting the time spent baking at 325*F. for my 7 1/2 pound prime rib.",

      "P.S.",
      "I was worried that cooking at 500*F. was burning that yummy crust created by the garlic and thyme, but I kept faith and stuck with it and it turned out nice and crispy, not burned at all.",
      "**A Test I did was Wonderful!",
      "Even though I cooked a 4.5 lb roast, I made the amount of garlic mixture called for in the recipe, which covered the fat very generously and produced a delicious crust.",
      "One reviewer mentioned their garlic was bitter.",
      "I imagine that the high initial temperature of 500*F. scorched the garlic.",
      "I seared my roast at 460*F. for 12 minutes, and then since the fat seemed like it was on the verge of smoking, I turned the oven down to 400*F. for the last 8 minutes.",
      "I then roasted at 350*F. rather than the 325*F. in the recipe, until my meat thermometer read 130*F. It was juicy with beautiful pink color in the center.",
