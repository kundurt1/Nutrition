A healthy body means a properly functioning metabolic system.",

    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "This recipe is so simple and easy and tastes so delicious. I use the cryovac Kansas City style pork rib slabs, but any style would work except boneless pork ribs. With those you would need some kind of rack in the bottom of your crock pot so they don't rest in the accumulation of fat and juices while cooking. Rub the rack of ribs with your favorite dry rub. If you don't have a favorite, you can make a quick dry rub with seasoned salt, pepper, paprika, chili powder, garlic powder and onion powder (or any combination of those). You can do a marinate over night, but I like the way the dry rubs taste. For easier clean up use a crock pot liner. Place the ribs in the crock standing on their side. No need to add any liquid. Cook on low for 8 or more hours, or on high for 5 hours. The ribs are done when you see them pulling away from the bone. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Remove the ribs carefully from the crockpot and place on a flat pan, meaty side up. Brush or pour on and spread BBQ sauce, as much or as little as you like. Cook in oven for 10-15 minutes, just long enough to carmelize the sugars in the sauce. Remove from oven, slice into servings. Serve with potato salad, ranch beans, pickles and onions. Yummy!"

Pour in the egg yolk mixture and continue to pulse, about 3 seconds per pulse, JUST until the mixture no longer looks dry and small clumps begin to form.",

Another option is to roll and cut with cookie cutters, sprinkle with sugar and bake along with the tart, later sandwiching them with jam.",

Whisk in juice and salt, place over medium heat and cook stirring constantly. As the mixture warms and starts to thicken a bit speed up your whisking, the faster you whisk the lighter the filling will become, which is the characteristic of this filling. Increase the heat if necessary, being sure to whisk constantly and vigorously.",

Once completely mixed, pour into the cooled tart shell.

      "Process almonds, hazelnuts, cornstarch, and salt in food processor until nuts are finely ground, 15 to 20 seconds. Add 1/2 cup sugar and pulse to combine, 1 to 2 pulses.",
      "Using stand mixer fitted with whisk, whip egg whites and cream of tartar on medium-low speed until foamy, about 1 minute. Increase speed to medium-high and whip whites to soft, billowy mounds, about 1 minute. With mixer running at medium-high speed, slowly add remaining 1/2 cup sugar and continue to whip until glossy, stiff peaks form, 2 to 3 minutes. Fold nut mixture into egg whites in 2 batches. With offset spatula, spread meringue evenly into 13 by 10 1/2-inch rectangle on parchment, using lines on parchment as guide. Using spray bottle, evenly mist surface of meringue with water until glistening. Bake for 1 1/2 hours. Turn off oven and allow meringue to cool in oven for 1 1/2 hours. (Do not open oven during baking and cooling.) Remove from oven and let cool to room temperature, about 10 minutes. (Cooled meringue can be kept at room temperature, tightly wrapped in plastic wrap, for up to 2 days.).",
      "FOR THE BUTTERCREAM: Heat milk in small saucepan over medium heat until just simmering. Meanwhile, whisk yolks, sugar, cornstarch, and salt in bowl until smooth. Remove milk from heat and, whisking constantly, add half of milk to yolk mixture to temper. Whisking constantly, return tempered yolk mixture to remaining milk in saucepan. Return saucepan to medium heat and cook, whisking constantly, until mixture is bubbling and thickens to consistency of warm pudding, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer pastry cream to bowl. Cover and refrigerate until set, at least 2 hours or up to 24 hours. Before using, warm gently to room temperature in microwave at 50 percent power, stirring every 10 seconds.",
      "Stir together amaretto and espresso powder; set aside. Using stand mixer fitted with paddle, beat butter at medium speed until smooth and light, 3 to 4 minutes. Add pastry cream in 3 batches, beating for 30 seconds after each addition. Add amaretto mixture and continue to beat until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes longer, scraping down bowl thoroughly halfway through mixing.",
      "FOR THE GANACHE: Place chocolate in heatproof bowl. Bring cream and corn syrup to simmer in small saucepan over medium heat. Pour cream mixture over chocolate and let stand for 1 minute. Stir mixture until smooth. Set aside to cool until chocolate mounds slightly when dripped from spoon, about 5 minutes.",
      "Carefully invert meringue and peel off parchment. Reinvert meringue and place on cutting board. Using serrated knife and gentle, repeated scoring motion, trim edges of meringue to form 12 by 10-inch rectangle. Discard trimmings. With long side of rectangle parallel to counter, use ruler to mark both long edges of meringue at 3-inch intervals. Using serrated knife, score surface of meringue by drawing knife toward you from mark on top edge to corresponding mark on bottom edge. Repeat scoring until meringue is fully cut through. Repeat until you have four 10 by 3-inch rectangles. (If any meringues break during cutting, use them as middle layers.).",
      "Place 3 rectangles on wire rack set in rimmed baking sheet. Using offset spatula, spread 1/4 cup ganache evenly over surface of each meringue. Refrigerate until ganache is firm, about 15 minutes. Set aside remaining ganache.",

Invert 1 ganache-coated meringue, place on top of buttercream, and press gently to level. Repeat, spreading meringue with 1/2 cup buttercream and topping with inverted ganache-coated meringue. Spread top with buttercream. Invert final ganache-coated strip on top of cake. Use 1 hand to steady top of cake and spread half of remaining buttercream to lightly coat sides of cake, then use remaining buttercream to coat top of cake. Smooth until cake resembles box. Refrigerate until buttercream is firm, about 2 hours. (Once buttercream is firm, assembled cake may be wrapped tightly in plastic and refrigerated for up to 2 days.).",
      "Warm remaining ganache in heatproof bowl set over barely simmering water, stirring occasionally, until mixture is very fluid but not hot. Keeping assembled cake on wire rack, pour ganache over top of cake. Using offset spatula, spread ganache in thin, even layer over top of cake, letting excess flow down sides. Spread ganache over sides in thin layer (top must be completely covered, but some small gaps on sides are OK).",
      "Garnish top of cake with hazelnuts. Holding bottom of cake with 1 hand, gently press almonds onto sides with other hand. Chill on wire rack, uncovered, for at least 3 hours or up to 12 hours. Transfer to platter. Cut into slices with sharp knife that has been dipped in hot water and wiped dry before each slice. Serve."

    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "Lightly oil a large bowl and set it aside. Mix the flour and salt together in a second large bowl. Make a well in the middle and slowly blend in the warm water, using an electric mixer or a fork, until a stiff dough has formed.",
      "Lightly sprinkle a work surface with flour, and transfer the dough to it. Knead and fold the dough until it is elastic and shiny, about 10 minutes. Pat the dough into a ball, place it in the oiled bowl, and turn to coat it all over with the oil. Cover with a cloth or plastic wrap and set aside in a warm place to rest for 2 hours.",
      "Dust the work surface again with a light layer of flour. Divide the dough into four pieces. With a 1 1/2 inch diameter dowel, roll each piece out to form a 10 inch circle. Lay the dough circles out on a dry surface that has been dusted with cornstarch, cover them with a cloth, and allow to rest for 30 minutes.",
      "Dust the rolling surface again. With the dowel, roll each circle as thin as you can. This dough is very elastic, and you will probably have to use your hands to stretch it as well as roll it. You can roll the whole circle of dough around the rolling stick, and holding up the stick let the dough slowly unroll so that gravity helps stretch it. After rolling and stretching each circle as thin as you can, place a clean, smooth cloth over your table. Dust the cloth with flour and lay the rolled pastry in the center. With both hands, stretch the dough until it is as thin as a dime and at least 14 x 12 inches in size. Don't worry about any holes; you can work around them later.",
      "When the dough is stretched thin, cut sheets the size you desire. Save any trimmings to roll again. Continue with the other circles until all the filo is rolled and cut. Keep the rolled sheets covered until ready to use.",
      "Use the filo sheets right away, or sprinkle them with flour and stack them one on top of another. Loosely roll the stack up into a log. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for up to 2 weeks, or freeze for up to 6 months. Makes 4 to 6 sheets: enough for a 12 x 9 inch pan.",
      "VARIATIONS:",
      "FILO WITH CARBONATED WATER, BEER, OR BAKING POWDER: Some Greeks substitute carbonated water or beer for the plain water, or add a little baking powder, to get a bit of rise in their dough.",
      "When using carbonated water or beer, simply replace the water with the liquid of choice.",
      "When adding baking powder, include 2 teaspoons baking powder when you mix together the flour and salt in Step 1. Include 2 Tablespoons olive oil along with the first 1/2 cup water; then add up to 1/4 cup more water, as needed, to form a stiff dough.",
      "FILO WITH VINEGAR OR LEMON JUICE: Vinegar and lemon juice, in some opinions, add a little sparkle and elasticity to the dough. Vinegar in the dough goes particularly well with pitas filled with spinach, leeks, or various greens.",
      "To use, include 1 tablespoon white wine vinegar or lemon juice and 2 tablespoons olive oil along with the first 1/2 cup water. Add up to 1/4 cup more water, as needed.",
      "FILO WITH EGG, MILK, OR YOGURT: Occasionally a dough maker will enrich filo dough with an egg, or will use milk or yogurt instead of the water. The resulting dough is yellower and creamier.",
      "When adding egg, you will need to use a little less water or a little more flour to achieve a stiff dough. It takes approximately 4 cups of flour to make the dough stiff enough when using 2 eggs.",
      "To use milk, simply substitute the same amount of milk for the water.",
      "When replacing water with yogurt, use either less flour or add a few extra tablespoons of water to achieve a stiff dough.",
      "FILO WITH OIL: Many Greeks use oil in their filo dough. Oil makes the dough even more elastic, though a bit less flaky. Use 3/4 cup warm water, 1/3 cup oil and 1/2 cup more flour. The oil can be olive oil, a flavorful nut oil, or for a very Mediterranean touch, sesame oil. You can also use part oil and part melted butter. Work the dough as little as possible; stop when it holds together.",

In smaller bowl, combine the Mexican cheese and taco seasoning (or cumin, paprika, and garlic powder). Add 3/4 cup of the Mexican cheese mixture to chicken mixture. Next add 1/4 cup green enchilada sauce to add moisture to chicken mixture, and set aside. If desired, add salt and pepper to taste.",
      "Next, place one tortilla at a time in the oil for about 10 seconds on each side. The tortillas will begin to bubble up some, and the edges will also turn upwards.

      "Take the dough out of the refrigerator (if it was in the fridge for a long time, let it sit on the countertop for 10 to 15 minutes so it's malleable enough to roll). Dust your work surface lightly with flour and place the dough on top. Sprinkle a little flour over the dough. Use your hands to quickly work the dough into a smooth disc. Don't overwork or warm it up too much, just smooth the edges as best you can so it's easier to roll.",
      "Roll the dough, adding more flour as necessary under and on top of the dough so it doesn't stick, into a 13 inch circle. Carefully drape the dough over the rolling pin and transfer it to a 9 inch deep dish pie pan (it should be least 1 1/2 inches deep). Gently fit the dough into the pan, easing it inwards rather than stretching it outwards. Don't worry if it tears, just patch it right back up. Trim the edges to 1/2 inch beyond the lip of the pie pan. Turn the edges under to create a rim on the crust (you can use the scraps to patch in any thin areas) and then press the rim against the lip of the pan, forming it into an even edge as you go. Using your fingers, crimp the rim. Place the crust in the freezer for at least 15 minutes while you heat the oven.",
      "Preheat the oven to 375. Remove the pie crust from the freezer and place on a baking sheet to make it easier to move in and out of the oven. Cover the crust with a piece of parchment paper and fill it about halfway full with dried beans or pie weights. Bake for 20 minutes. Take the crust out of the oven and remove the parchment paper and beans/pie weights and tent the edges with a few strips of foil folded in half lengthwise. This will protect the edges from getting too dark. Bake for another 20 minutes, until the dough is dry and golden. Don't worry if the bottom puffs up and just press it down gently with a flat spatula, such as a pancake turner, taking care not to puncture it. Remove the foil but don't throw it away. You may need it again.",
      "Reduce the oven temperature to 325.",
      "Make the filling by whisking together all of the ingredients in a large bowl. Pour the filling into the pre-baked crust. Bake for 50 to 60 minutes, until the filling is just set. It should look dry around the edges and the center should jiggle just slightly if you nudge the pan. Keep a close eye on the pie as it bakes. If the crust looks like it's browning too quickly, tent the edges again with the foil strips. Cool the pie on a rack and leave it on the baking sheet in room temperature for a few hours. Slice or refrigerate until ready to serve."

Bouquet garni is a bundle of fresh herbs, usually by leaf, sprig of thyme and parsley stalks, tied together with kitchen string. The bundle is removed at the end of cooking and discarded."

To the Mason jar sponge, add another cup of flour, and another cup of warm water. Mix well. Loosely cap this jar to let it breathe a little. Don't forget to feed your starter 1/2 cup flour and 1/2 cup warm water weekly, or else you should make bread once a week. This is a living yeast culture and should be treated like a pet!",

      "Place the loaf in oven; turn it to 350 degrees F. Do not preheat! Loaf is done when a light brown crust forms, and makes a hollow noise when tapped with a wooden spoon, anywhere from 30-45 minutes. Cool before slicing."
