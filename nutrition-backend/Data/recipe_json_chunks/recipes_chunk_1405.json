Sprinkle 2 tablespoons of water over mixture and pulse a few times, then repeat with 1 tablespoon of water at a time, or just until small curds start to form and dough holds together when pinched with fingers. It'll look kind of crumbly but that's okay. (Alternatively, you can do this by hand.)",
      "Empty dough onto clean counter or piece of wax paper. Using bench scraper, gather dough into a rough rectangular mound about 12 inches long and 4 inches wide. Starting from the farthest end, use the heel of your hand to smear about one sixth of dough against your work surface away from you. Repeat until all of your dough has been smeared. Using bench scraper, gather the dough again into a 12-inch long and 4-inch wide mound and repeat smearing of dough with heel of hand. The dough should be smooth and cohesive at this point; if not, repeat smearing process again. Form dough into 4 inch disk, wrap in plastic, and refrigerate until firm about 1 hour. The smearing process creates long layers of butter in the dough, which translates to long flaky layers in the cooked crust.",

Gently lay round of dough atop the fruit filling, tucking and folding the dough edges around the fruit, leaving a small rim that sticks up against the side of the skillet. Brush with egg white and then sprinkle evenly with turbinado sugar. Poke a few small holes in the crust so steam can vent.",
      "Bake pandowdy for about 30 minutes (place a foil-lined baking sheet underneath the skillet to catch any fruit juices that spill over), then remove the skillet from oven and break the dough into large pieces with a sharp knife to \"dowdy\" its looks. Return to oven and bake until the crust is golden and firm and the fruit juices are bubbling up through the crust pieces, about 20 minutes longer.",
      "Meanwhile, whisk together the cream, egg yolk, and vanilla extract in a measuring cup with a spout. Remove the pandowdy from the oven and let the juices settle for a minute or two. Slowly begin pouring the cream mixture into each of the cuts; use the back of a spoon or a knife if needed to help with the flooding, working your way around the entire pandowdy. Some of the cream will go under the crust and much will pool on top. This is okay (and expected)!",
      "Return the pandowdy to the oven and bake until the cream just sets but is still a little jiggly, about 8 to 10 minutes. Remove to a cooling rack and let cool completely. Even when fully cool, the pandowdy will have lots of juice, part of its charm, so serve in bowls with spoons. It's best on the day it's baked, but it's not bad at all on Day 2 straight from the fridge (breakfast, perhaps?!)."

    "title": "rye orecchiette with stinging nettles, sheep\u2019s milk feta, and chive blossoms",
    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "In a large mixing bowl, combine the rye flour, semolina flour, and salt. (If mixing in the bowl of a stand mixer, use the dough hook attachment.) Add 1 cup of warm water and combine on medium speed (or using a spatula), until a ball of dough forms and pulls away from the sides of the bowl. If you notice the dough crumbling, add 1 to 3 more tablespoons of warm water. If you notice that it's too sticky, add 1 to 3 more tablespoons of rye flour until it loses its stickiness.",
      "Knead the dough until it becomes smooth and supple. If you're using a stand mixer, this will take about 5 to 6 minutes on medium speed; if you're using your hands, it will take a bit longer, about 8 to 10 minutes. The dough should be cohesive and smooth after kneading. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and allow to rest in a dry place at room temperature for 45 minutes.",
      "Once the dough has rested, lightly dust your workspace with about 1 tablespoon of semolina flour. Wooden work surfaces, such as butcher block countertops or large wooden boards, are ideal for shaping the orecchiette. Use the dusting flour sparingly; 1 to 2 tablespoons should be enough for the entire mass of dough. Dust 2 large rimmed baking trays with semolina flour sparingly, about 1 tablespoon per tray.",
      "Cut off approximately one-sixth of the dough (about 100 grams) and roll into a long rope that's about 1/2-inch in diameter. Cut the log into several small pieces, about 1/2-inch wide, and one by one roll each piece into a circle. To give you a sense of how large these should be, 5 orecchiette pieces (uncooked) should weigh about 12 to 15 grams. On the dusted work surface, press down with your finger into the center of each dough circle (I use my middle finger, but you could also use your thumb) and rotate in small circles to spread the dough into a bowl shape, making it thin at the bottom. Next, pinch each dough piece on your finger to smooth out the shape. To get the classic orecchiette shape, pull back on the edges to create a small ear-like saucer. Place the finished orecchiette on the dusted baking tray and continue the process until all of the dough is formed into orecchiette. Make sure not to allow them to touch on the tray or they will stick together.",
      "The formed orecchiette can be frozen directly on the trays and then transferred and stored in sealed storage containers in the freezer for up to 2 to 3 weeks. Cook the frozen orecchiette just as you would the fresh; do not thaw before cooking.",
      "In a large pot, heat 1/4 cup of olive oil over medium heat. Add shallots and cook until translucent, about 4 to 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Add nettles, salt, and pepper, and cook, stirring frequently, until nettles have wilted, about 5 to 6 minutes. Add the stock and continue to cook, 1 to 2 minutes.",
      "Transfer to a bowl and blend with an immersion blender, or puree in a food processor until smooth. Set aside.",
      "Bring a large pot of salted water to a gentle simmer. Add all the orecchiette at once and cook until you notice them floating to the top, about 3 to 4 minutes. Once they've floated to the top, continue to cook approximately 2 to 3 minutes longer or until al dente. Reserve 1 cup of pasta liquid for later use and drain cooked orecchiette in a colander.",
      "Toss cooked orecchiette with the nettle puree and 1/4 cup of the reserved pasta liquid, adding a little bit at a time until you've reached your desired ratio. If you have leftover puree, you can freeze it in ice cubes for several weeks for later use.",
      "Toss the finished pasta with the feta and lemon zest, then garnish with fresh herbs. I used chive blossoms here for their delicate flavor, but fresh-snipped chives or basil would also work well."

Make sure to allow it to dissolve well and sip some water before re-tasting.",
      "Freeze the ice cream base as directed by your ice cream machine's instruction manual. Transfer the ice cream into a storage container, drizzling with thick ribbons of sauce as you go, and ending with a drizzle of sauce. Place a piece of parchment on the surface of the ice cream, and place the container in the freezer. Freeze in the coldest part of your freezer until firm, at least 4 hours, before serving. (NOTE: the caramel stays nicely gooey in this ice cream, so I'd recommend serving in a dish rather than a cone)."

    "title": "converted best-ever lemon meringue cake",
    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Line 2 round 9-inch cake pans with parchment and spray lightly with cooking spray.",
      "Beat the sugar and eggs in a large bowl of an electric mixer at medium speed for 1 minute. Add all flours/starches, salt, baking powder, xanthan gum, oil, milk, vanilla, and lemon zest; beat at medium speed for 1 minute.",
      "Pour batter into prepared pans. Bake for 25 minutes or until cake is firm and the center springs back when touched. Cool on wire racks in the pan for 5 minutes, then use a small knife to cut around the sides of the pan to loosen. Invert the cakes, peel off the parchment and cool completely.\r\n\r\nYou will need to divide each of these two layers in half, making 4 layers total",
      "Caramel: Pour the cream into a small, heavy saucepan. Split the vanilla bean in half lengthwise and use the tip of a sharp knife to scrape the seeds into the milk (or add the vanilla extract at this point). Place over medium-high heat and bring to just under a boil, stirring occasionally. Reduce the heat to low to keep the cream warm while you caramelize the sugar.\r\n\r\nIn a large saucepan (much larger than you think you need--the caramel will boil very high when you add the cream later on), combine the 1 1/4 c. sugar, 1/4 c. water, 1/4 tsp. salt and corn syrup. Bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Then cook, without stirring, until the mixture is amber colored, about 5-8 minutes. Remove from heat. Make sure your cream is closeby because the caramel will continue to cook once you take it off the heat.\r\n\r\nCarefully and slowly add the cream to the sugar syrup. The mixture will boil vigorously at first. Let the mixture simmer down, then whisk until smooth. Add the 3/4 tsp. lemon juice, then let cool for about 10 minutes.\r\n\r\nCut the 4 tbsp. butter into 1-inch chunks and add them to the caramel one at a time, whisking constantly after each addition. Whisk the caramel periodically as it cools. You will end up with more than you actually need for the recipe, but consider this a good thing. A very, very good thing. Keep well-covered in the fridge.",
      "Lemon syrup: combine the 1/3 c. sugar and 1/3 c. water in a small saucepan and bring to a boil, stirring frequently. When the sugar has dissolved, remove the pan from the heat, let cool for a few minutes and chill until cool to the touch, about 30 minutes. Whisk the 1/3 c. lemon juice into the syrup.",
      "Lemon cream: Boil some water in a saucepan, then bring it down to a simmer. Combine the 1/2c. + 2 tbsp. lemon juice, 3 whole eggs, 1 egg yolk, 3/4 c. sugar and a pinch of salt in a stainless steel bowl that will rest securely in the rim of the saucepan over, not touching, the water. Do not let the egg yolks and sugar sit together without stirring; the sugar will mix with the yolks and become quite grainy. Whisk the ingredients until the mixture becomes very thick and registers 180 degrees on a thermometer. \r\n\r\nRemove the bowl from over the water and let cool to 140 degrees, stirring from time to time to release the heat. Meanwhile, cut the 1 c. butter into 1-inch chunks. When the cream is ready, use an immersion blender to add the butter 1 tablespoon at a time, blending until incorporated after each addition. The cream should be pale yellow and opaque and thick at this point.\r\n\r\nYou can use the cream immediately or pour it into a storage container with a tight fitting lid. If you want to save this for later use, you can refrigerate for up to 5 days and reheat gently in a stainless steel bowl set over simmering water until it has softened",
      "Assembly + meringue: Line the sides of a 9-inch springform pan with 3-inch sides with plastic wrap, allowing enough overhang to cover the top of the cake completely once it's assembled. I find it's easiest to do a piece of saran going each way over the springform without the bottom in it and then drop the bottom in. You want the saran to be going underneath the pan bottom so it only touches the sides.\r\n\r\nFit one cake layer into the bottom of the pan. Using a pastry brush, moisten the layer evenly with 1/4 of the lemon syrup. You may want to use more syrup on the top layers and less on the bottom because it does seep down overnight. Then, cover the layer with 1/3 c. of caramel, then 3/4 c. of the lemon cream. Repeat with the next two layers. Top with the last cake layer, moisten it with syrup, and fold the overhanging plastic wrap over it to seal. Refrigerate for at least 4 hours or up to overnight.\r\n\r\nWhen you are ready to finish the cake, make the meringue. Boil water in a saucepan over medium heat. Combine the egg whites, 1 3/4 c. sugar and pinch salt in the bowl of a stand mixer that will rest securely in the rim of the saucepan over, not touching, the water. Whisk together and then place over the the water. Continue to whisk until the whites are hot to the touch (120 degrees).\r\n\r\nRemove the bowl from over the water and place on the mixer stand. Using the whisk attachment, mix on high speed until the mixture is very thick and holds glossy, stiff peaks.\r\n\r\nRetrieve your cake. Release and list off the pan sides and peel away the plastic wrap. Transfer onto your serving plate. Immediately frost your cake with the meringue, creating swoops and peaks with your offset spatula. If you'd like, you can create more peaks by using your fingers to pull away at the meringue (which is what I did). Using a kitchen torch, lightly brown the meringue, blackening some of the peaks.\r\n\r\nThe cake can be served immediately or kept cold in the fridge until ready to serve, up to 1 week."

To begin, combine 3 heaping tablespoons of peanut butter with 2 tablespoons of soy sauce, along with the garlic, ginger, chilies, palm sugar, juice from one lime and a drizzle of sesame oil. Blend this until smooth, and then add a generous splash of the rice wine vinegar, the rest of the peanut butter and the juice from the other lime. Continue the process of blending, tasting and adding until you settle on a peanut sauce that suits your taste buds- it should be peanutty, a little bit sweet, tangy and have plenty of spice. I didn't find that the sauce needed any extra salt due to the soy sauce, but if necessary feel free to add some salt and pepper. You will find that the peanut sauce is quite thick, so add about 1/4 of a cup of water, and give the mixture one final blend. The result should be a frothy, delicious peanut sauce, just thin enough to coat the noodles nicely.",

      "On a back burner scald the milk or half and half, but don't boil it.Get your food processor ready. Peel the garlic and give it a quick chop and put it in the processor.",
      "When the cod is tender and flakey remove it from the poaching liquid and break it into smaller pieces. Put that in the food processor along with the garlic. Give that a quick pulse on a low setting. Add the potatoes and repeat. Add the olive oil and piment and repeat. You want the brandade to be a bit chunky not Gerbered. Finally, through the tube carefully add the hot milk and pulse several times. CAUTION! Adding hot liquids to food processors or blenders can be explosive if you don't keep the lid tightly closed. If necessary wrap a towel around your hand and hold the lid in place.",
      "From here it's easy. While the soaking process should have taken most of the residual saltiness from the cod you may still have to adjust the seasoning by adding salt or pepper.",
      "Roasting peppers is pretty damn easy. Using tongs place them directly on gas burners over a high flame or outside on a wood fired grill (the preferred method). Drop them into individual paper sacks and close or into a large bowl and cover with cling wrap. Peel by hand, any lingering black bits are fine. It gives them character and makes you strong.",

Remove from oven, discard thyme sprigs, and set mushrooms aside. Meanwhile, warm 2 cups chicken broth with reserved fresh mushroom stems and parmigiano heel. When it comes to a gentle boil, remove from heat and add dried mushrooms. Cover and let steep.",
      "Warm 2 tbsp olive oil and chopped bacon together over medium-low heat. When it has rendered its fat and begun to brown, add turmeric, 2 tbsp butter and the leeks. Lower heat, cover, and let stew for about 5 mins. Remove cover and add shallots and garlic, and stir until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add carrot, endive, and potato and continue to sweat, another few mins, until they start to soften as well. Add the roasted mushrooms, then clear a little hole in the middle of the pan and add tomato paste. Let it take on a little color, then stir to incorporate into the vegetables. Raise heat to medium (or medium-high; my stovetop runs pretty hot) and add Worcestershire sauce. Give a quick stir, then add the white wine. Cook until reduced by half, 2 or 3 mins. Strain the infused chicken broth into the pan, pressing down on solids to extract as much liquid as possible. Transfer the parmesean heel to the pan mixture and let it continue to do its thing. Stir in the heavy cream. Bring to a boil, then lower heat and simmer, covered, until flavor is well-developed, 15-20 mins, although it won't hurt if you let it go longer.",
      "Uncover and remove from heat. The sauce will look greasy and broken. That's ok, because it will emulsify when pureed, which is what you do next: Once it's cooled a little, fish out the parmesean heel, then work in batches and puree in a blender or food processor until completely smooth, a minute or two. Alternatively, you can do this directly in the pan using an immersion blender. If you think it needs it (it may not), add the juice of up to half a lemon and adjust for salt and pepper. Finish with chopped fresh thyme or lemon thyme leaves. Serve over grilled bread a la Welsh Rarebit, or to sauce cooked broccoli, or as a base for mac and cheese. (Note: If serving with pasta and you want to keep the texture of the cooked vegetables, simply strain out the liquid and emulsify it before returning it to the pan along with the cooked pasta and a little of the cooking water.)"

Bake for about 15 to 18 minutes, or until golden brown (you can smell fresh cookies awaiting). You can always toothpick test the center, but these are chewy not cakey cookies, so it's okay if the center is a tiny bit underdone."

Spray with neutral flavored cooking spray. If you want your pecans buried in your caramel, distribute them evenly over the bottom of the pan.",
      "Dissolve the cream of tartar in the water in a 6- to 8-quart stock pot. Add in the sugar and corn syrup. Cover the pot and bring to a boil over medium heat. Once mixture is boiling, uncover the pan and increase the heat to medium high. You will need to keep a pretty close eye on the pan, and swirl the pan occasionally. If you are using a candy thermometer you will notice the mixture hovers near the boiling point for a while then starts to climb fairly rapidly. As the mixture approaches 310 degrees F, you will want to start swirling it fairly frequently as caramelization is imminent. Once caramel color is to your liking remove pan from heat. The pan will retain some heat so I like to remove the caramelized sugar mixture from the heat at about 325-330 degrees F, or when it is a golden brown color.",
      "Slowly pour the warm cream mixture through a mesh strainer into the the sugar mixture. It will boil violently and create hot steam, so use caution. I like to wear an oven mitt while stirring until the boiling has settled down. Stir with a wooden spoon until sugar has all dissolved into the cream.",
      "Return caramel mixture to medium to medium-high heat and bring the mixture up to 244-248 degrees F, the firm ball stage (if you drop about a 1/2 teaspoon of the mixture into a bowl of refrigerator cold water it should form a ball, that is not soft but still malleable - the lower end of the temperature range should produce a somewhat gooey caramel and the upper range should produce a firmer texture - see cooks note at end of recipe.) Stir often, scraping the bottom of the pan. As you get close to your target temperature you may want to turn the heat down to low if you are using a gas stove, or off if you are using electric to slow things down. Your caramels can go from too soft to tooth breaking within a short time frame. You will also want to stir almost continuously as you get close to your target temp to prevent burning.",
      "Remove from heat and quickly stir in vanilla extract, then proceed with pouring the caramel into your prepared pan. If the pecans are in the bottom of the pan you will want a thinner stream, that moves over the surface of the pan to help keep an even layer of pecans.",
      "If you want your pecans to remain somewhat separated on the surface of the caramel, evenly distribute them over the freshly poured caramel mixture. Wait about 10 minutes, then gently and carefully press them into place. Sprinkle with fleur de sel about 10 minutes after pouring the caramel in either case; attempt to get several salt grains per piece of caramel.",
      "Allow to cool to room temperature. Use parchment paper \"sling\" to remove from the pan, then cut caramel into 1-inch squares, or whatever size pieces you prefer. I periodically spray my knife with non-stick spray to help cut the caramels. Wrap individually with waxed paper, and store in an airtight container.",
      "Note: Caramel making is a bit trial-and-error based on humidity and other factors. If your caramels come out too soft, modify the final temperature up 1-4 degrees. If they come out too hard, modify down. This recipe scales down by half to an 8-inch square pan if you want to make a smaller amount or feel like experimenting!"

If you don't, the milk won't strain through the muslin, and you won't end up with the leftover cashew cream. At first the straining process might seem a little tedious, but you'll get the hang of it quickly. The double bargain of cashew milk and cashew cream are worth it.",
      "Put the cashews in a separate bowl with three cups of water, cover with plastic wrap or a towel and soak overnight or at least 12 hours. After 12 or more hours, discard the soaking water and rinse the cashews. Put the cashews and 3-1/2 cups of fresh water in the blender container. Using the highest speed on the blender, blend the ingredients for about 2 minutes. The mixture will become smooth and creamy and will have a thick layer of foam on top.",

Line the strainer with the muslin, making sure it is large enough to cover the entire strainer and hang over the edges a bit. Slowly pour the entire mixture over the muslin into the strainer. Let sit until most of the liquid has drained through, at least 30 minutes. Once the liquid has stopped dripping through the muslin, carefully gather the edges of the muslin together, lift out of the strainer with the cream still sitting in the muslin, and place in a separate bowl as is.",

Scoop the cream mixture from the muslin sitting in the separate bowl into the cheesecloth, gently spreading it out so any remaining liquid can drain easily. Let this sit for at least another 30 minutes, until the cream looks like it has thickened and the liquid has mostly stopped dripping through. You can alternatively let the milk strain for several hours to make an even thicker cream.",

Gently scoop cream from cheesecloth into a small storage container for later use. Remove the strainer from the bowl and set aside. Use a whisk to stir the milk in the bowl, since some of the sediment will have settled as it sat, and pour into another storage container. Store both milk and cream in the refrigerator.

For example, if you wish to use 100g of your starter in the poolish, you should add just 50g each of water and flour, to make the poolish.

Rub the outside of the chicken with olive oil, and season aggressively with salt.

You will need approximately 2 cups of shredded chicken for the soup, and any remaining chicken can be eaten as a snack or put to another use.

When the matzo mixture has been in the refrigerator for 30 minutes, you can lightly salt the boiling water, shape the matzo mixture into balls that are slightly bigger than a ping pong ball, and add them to the simmering water.

      "FOR THE CRUST: In a food processor, pulse flours and salt to combine about 3 times. Scatter butter pieces over the flour mixture, then pulse until the butter is about the size of chickpeas, about 8 short pulses. Add the cheese and thyme, and pulse once or twice to evenly integrate. Sprinkle 2 tablespoons of water over mixture and pulse a few times, then repeat with 1 tablespoon of water at a time, or just until small curds start to form and dough holds together when pinched with fingers. It'll look kind of crumbly but that's okay. (Alternatively, you can do this by hand.)",
      "Empty dough onto clean counter or piece of wax paper. Using bench scraper, gather dough into a rough rectangular mound about 12 inches long and 4 inches wide. Starting from the farthest end, use the heel of your hand to smear about one sixth of dough against your work surface away from you. Repeat until all of your dough has been smeared. Using bench scraper, gather the dough again into a 12-inch long and 4-inch wide mound and repeat smearing of dough with heel of hand. The dough should be smooth and cohesive at this point; if not, repeat smearing process again. Form dough into 4-inch disk, wrap in plastic, and refrigerate until firm about 1 hour, or up to 3 days. The smearing process creates long layers of butter in the dough, which translates to long flaky layers in the cooked crust.",

      "FOR THE FILLING: In a large saute pan over medium heat, heat 2 tablespoons olive oil. Add the onions, stirring to coat them evenly in the oil. Once the onions have started to color, lower the heat, stir in a few pinches of salt and pepper, and cook until the onions are a golden, amber color-about 25 to 30 minutes. Remove from the heat and let cool.",
      "In a small bowl, stir together the ricotta cheese, 1 teaspoon olive oil, and salt and pepper, to taste. Meanwhile, on a large plate or cutting board, sprinkle the cherry tomatoes with salt; let them sit while preparing the dough to draw the juices out.",
      "TO ASSEMBLE AND BAKE: On a lightly floured work surface, roll dough into a 12-inch round, dusting with flour as needed. (Don't worry if your dough isn't perfectly round.) Transfer the dough to a parchment-lined baking sheet. Spread the caramelized onions over the dough, leaving a 2 1/2-inch border around the edges, then top with the ricotta cheese mixture, spreading it evenly over the onions, then the cherry tomatoes. Fold the edges of the dough over the filling, pleating it in several places to hold in the filling. Lay a few sprigs of thyme over the tomatoes. (If your dough is getting too warm at any point and is difficult to manage, return it to the refrigerator for 10 to 15 minutes, then proceed.)",

Lay each thick slice flat and cut in half. Slice each half about 3/4 through to create two thick rolls. Toast the rolls by gently pulling them open 90 degrees. These are thick, so don't try to put the whole roll in your toaster. Instead, turn your toaster to the lowest setting. Open each roll 90 degrees and toast the rolls by hanging one side into the toaster at a time.",
      "Assemble the sandwiches by giving each toasted roll a thin swipe of mayonnaise. Layer in the baby greens and cucumber. Pile on your lobster pieces. Add generous amounts of mint and a good scattering of the chopped tarragon. Tarragon is potent, but here, don't be shy: it will play really well with the mint and lobster. Use less than the mint, but you'll be surprised at how much of it you will want in the end. If unsure, you can start with the equiv. of a few leaves per sandwich and let people add more at the table.",
      "Drizzle with the tarragon dressing just before serving. Have a small plate with extra fixings out so people can grab more herbs, lemon or dressing. If any extra lobster has made it past the snacking-I-mean-shelling-station, add that to the fixings plate and let people have at it."

Move your oven rack as close to the coils as you can, keeping in mind that you don't want the fish to actually touch the top of the oven. Line a baking tray with aluminum foil.",
      "Rinse the salmon quickly under water and pat dry. Slice into single serving pieces. One pound usually results in 4-5 slices. Place the slices on the aluminum foil.",
      "Sprinkle the fish with a generous amount of salt and pepper. Slice the lemon in half and remove the seeds. Squeeze half a lemon (or more) over the fish. I usually use at least part of the second half of the lemon because I think the tanginess really compliments the richness of the salmon. Next, drizzle the olive oil on top then turn all the pieces in the excess oil, lemon, and spices until all sides are well coated.",
      "With the slices of salmon lying skin side down, press a thick layer of za'atar onto the top of the fish so that you can't see much pink through the spices. I usually use two spoons: one to scoop the za'atar and the other to press it onto the fish (or just use your fingers). It will seem like an unreasonable amount of za'atar, but it's not. If you aren't sure how much you love za'atar or you are running low, you could use less and the fish will still taste great.",
      "Carefully turn the fish pieces so the skin side is facing up, but make sure most of the za'atar does not fall off (that's why pressing it in is important). Slide the tray into the oven as close to the broiler as you can and cook for 6-7 minutes.",
      "Remove the tray and flip the slices of salmon so the za'atar side is facing up and broil for another 5-6 minutes, or less if you like it a bit less opaque in the middle. I like my salmon well done with crispy edges so I usually err on the upper end of the time range. That said, the timing could be slightly different depending on your oven, so I recommend slicing one piece in the middle to be sure it's done the way you like it.",
      "One pound of fish (plus a side) typically feeds two of us heartily, so you could scale up by buying about a half pound (or slightly less) per person.",
      "The blackened vegetables mentioned in the title are optional, but highly recommended. To add them: After you slice the fish and season it, chop the peppers and onions into large (about 2 inch) cubes. Add the vegetables to the tray and swirl them in the seasoning that has collected on the aluminum foil. You might want to add a bit more salt and pepper, to your taste. That's it! Just follow the fish instructions and you'll have some tasty, partially blackened veggies to accompany your dish."

Add the liquid ingredients to the dry and stir together with a wooden spoon or rubber spatula. It will yield a very sticky dough.",

Transfer to the sheet tray and roll around in the oil. Use your palms and fingertips to flatten into a rectangle. When it resists stretching any further, leave it alone. Let be for 20 minutes. Right before you bake, use your fingertips to flatten the focaccia a little more, so it fills out the pan.",

Pour in all 6 cups of water, cover, and let sit overnight.",

Turn heat up to high, and stir to dissolve the sugar. Allow the mixture to boil on high heat for about 6 minutes, and then turn the heat to medium. Stir the mixture, making sure it is always simmering. At this point, add the rum and the vanilla seed, as well as the vanilla pod.",
      "Keep stirring the mixture until it is shiny, and you can run a wooden spoon across the bottom of the pot and you see a clean \"trail\" of the pot.

Using the handle of a wooden spoon, create a trough down the middle of the dough about 2 inches wide (it will cause the dough to spread out a bit, but that's fine).

Add the remaining ingredients and slowly heat until it just starts to bubble. Turn off the heat and let sit for 15 minutes. Remove the onion slice. I then blend with an immersion blender. Alternately, if you prefer not to blend, you can just mince the herbs and garlic before adding to the pot. Set aside.",

Add a layer of turnips and then sprinkle with more salt, pepper and a scant TB of parmesan. Add another layer of potatoes and repeat with the salt, pepper, and parmesan.

      "Proof the yeast in 1/2 cup of warm water (no hotter than 115 degrees Fahrenheit) with a pinch of sugar. Give it at least ten minutes, or until it has doubled in volume. It's easiest to know this for sure if you proof in a glass measuring cup.",
      "(Please see the note below. You don't have to knead this by hand if you don't care to do so.) In a large bowl and using a sturdy wooden spoon, mix the egg, milk, mashed potato, wheat germ, oil and honey. Add one cup of flour. Beat well.",
      "Add the yeast mixture, once it's ready, and a second cup of flour. Beat until thoroughly combined.",
      "Gradually add two more cups of flour and the salt; use the back of your spoon to stir as much of the flour into the dough as you can without too much work. Then dump out onto a lightly floured work surface everything in the bowl (and scrape the sides and add that to the pile). Put the remaining 1/2 cup of flour on the counter, within easy reach, off to the side.",
      "Knead the bread well, and patiently, using a bench scraper to pull up any dough that sticks to your work surface. Add flour just a bit at a time, being careful not to add too much. I use my bench scraper to pull over about a teaspoon or two at a time from the little pile of flour I measured out before I started kneading. Remember, you may not need all of that remaining 1/2 cup.",
      "After kneading for about ten minutes, the dough should be smooth and elastic. Continue to knead if it isn't. You can't over-knead it.",
      "Shape the dough into a ball, put it in an oiled bowl, then turn it over to coat it well. Let rise for an hour, or until doubled, in a covered bowl in a draft-free place that's not too chilly. (See note below about rising.)",
      "When the dough has doubled in size, punch it down gently, knead a few times and shape it into large oval loaf (or any other shape you want); put it on a piece of parchment, on a pizza stone, and let it rise for another 45 minutes or so.",
      "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Just before baking, slash the bread three or four times and brush with a wash made of one egg and a tablespoon of whole milk.",
      "Bake for about 45 to 50 minutes, or longer if necessary. When done, it will sound hollow when tapped. Convection ovens can often make the crust a bit dark, especially those made with milk, so if the crust is looking too brown after 25 or 30 minutes, cover it very lightly with a piece of foil.",
      "When done, remove from the oven and let the bread cool on a rack for at least 30 minutes before slicing.",
      "Enjoy!!",
      "A quick note about rising: In my old, chilly house, the best place for the bread to rise is in my microwave. I put a cup or small jar with some water in it into the microwave and cook it at full power for 2 minutes, then take it out. It warms the space inside and makes it nice and moist.",
      "And another note, about kneading: This dough does not necessarily have to be kneaded by hand, if you have another method that you prefer, and are able to make adjustments accordingly. I happen to like stirring and kneading, because I rely on my hands to tell me when the correct amount of flour has been added. Plus, there's nothing quite like the satisfaction of using your own hands to turn a shaggy, floury mass of not-quite combined ingredients into the most glorious, smooth, shiny and supple ball of dough. I do some of my best thinking while kneading, too."

Heat a heavy saucepan or Dutch oven (with a tight-fitting lid), into which the roast will fit snugly, over medium-high heat. Add olive or grapeseed oil to cover the bottom of the pan. Sear the roast on both sides, adjusting the heat as necessary, to achieve a deep brown crust on the meat. Take your time with this step, you are developing the \"fond\" that will flavor the cooking liquid. Remove the roast to a plate and pour off all but a teaspoon or so of the fat.",
      "Place the pan over medium heat and add the chopped onion and a large pinch of salt. Saute until the onion is translucent and beginning to brown a little. Toss in the garlic cloves and stir again for a minute or two. Add the vinegar and stir well to dislodge those browned bits on the bottom of the pan. Raise the heat and let the vinegar bubble away until there is only a glaze left in the pan. Add 1 1/2 cups of beef broth and the fresh herbs and bring to a lively simmer. Add the roast back to the saucepan, there should be enough liquid to come up the sides of the meat, but not completely cover it. (Add the remaining 1/2 cup of broth if necessary).",
      "Cover the roast with a circle of parchment paper, put the lid on the pot and place the roast in the oven. Braise the meat for two hours, turning it once, halfway through. Add the carrots and potatoes to the pot and braise for an additional hour or until the vegetables are cooked and the meat is meltingly tender.",
      "To serve immediately remove the meat and vegetables to a warm serving bowl, cover with foil, and set in a low oven. Strain the cooking liquid through a fine sieve, pushing hard on the solids. Let stand for a moment or two, then skim as much fat as possible from the surface of the sauce. Taste for seasoning and add salt and pepper, as desired. In the meantime, quickly saute the sliced mushrooms in the butter until lightly browned and tender. Add the mushrooms to the sauce and serve with the roast, carrots and potatoes. Rather than carve the meat you can simply pull chunks apart and plate them with the potatoes and carrots. If you prefer, cook the potatoes separately and mash them. Set the meat and carrots atop the mash then add the mushrooms and sauce. Sprinkle chopped fresh herbs over as a garnish. If preparing the roast ahead of time, cover it and cool slightly, then wrap tightly and refrigerate for up to three days. Package the sauce and vegetables separately and refrigerate. When ready to serve, lift any fat from the sauce, add the meat and vegetables, and heat in a low oven."

Tear off a chunk of the dough and use it to wipe out any residual yeast and water, then add it back to the bowl. Sprinkle the salt and oil onto the dough. Moisten your dominant hand. Hold the rim of your bowl with your other hand, then reach under the dough and grab about a quarter of it. Stretch the dough (but don't tear it), and fold it over the top of the dough. Rotate the bowl and repeat to encase the salt, yeast, and oil in the dough (don't worry if a bit of the water or oil escapes in the process). Use your thumb and index finger like a lobster claw to pinch through the dough creating 5 or 6 sections. Fold the dough as before until it becomes a cohesive mass.

      "In a small bowl, whisk all of the ingredients together until blended. Let rest for at least 15 minutes or cover and refrigerate the batter for up to 3 days.",
      "To bake one tray at a time (recommended if this is your first time), position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 300\u00b0 F. Otherwise, position racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven.",
      "If you are shaping tuiles over a rolling, set the pin on a rack to prevent it from rolling, or anchor it in some other way. If you are shaping the tuiles in cups or over other objects, have these ready.",
      "Stir the batter. Drop rounded teaspoons 2 inches apart on the lined baking sheets. Using a small offset spatula or the back of a spoon and a circular motion, spread the batter evenly into 3-inch rounds about 1/16-inch thick. Bake, watching carefully for 12 to 15 minutes, until the tuiles are mostly golden brown with pale splotches. Rotate the sheets from front to back (and top to bottom if baking two trays) halfway through the baking time, to ensure even baking. If tuiles are not baked enough, they will not be completely crisp when cool.",
      "Tuiles must be shaped while hot from the oven.",
      "If using Silicone mats: As soon as you can coax a thin metal spatula under a tuile without destroying it, transfer it to a rack to cool flat. Or shape it by draping it over a rolling pin; nestling it into a little cup; or twisting it with you fingers. Working fast, remove and shape the remaining tuiles; Reheat them if they become too brittle to bend by returning them to the oven for a couple of minutes, until they're flexible.",
      "If using regular or nonstick foil: For flat tuiles, slide the entire sheet of foil onto a rack to cool. For shaped tuiles, transfer and drape them as described above. Tuiles are easiest to remove from regular foil when they are either very hot or completely cool.",
      "Bonus technique for regular foil only: You can curve an entire sheet of tuiles at once by rolling the foil into a fat cylinder with hot cookies attached, here's how: As soon as you remove the baking sheet from the oven, grasp the edges of the foil (without touching the hot pan or the cookies) and roll it into a fat cylinder, gently curving the attached cookies. Crimp or secure the foil with paper clips. Set the cylinder between a couple of heavy objects (cans or jars) to prevent it from sagging. When cool, unroll the foil carefully and remove the tuiles.",
      "Repeat until all of the tuiles are baked. To retain crispness, put tuiles into an airtight container as soon as they are completely cool. Store in airtight container for at least 1 month.",
      "TIP: While tuiles are baking, you can continue to spread batter on extra pan liners set on the counter (or on extra pans if you have them). Slide the batter-laden liners onto cookies sheets and into the oven as soon as the oven is empty. You do not have to wait for the pans to cool between rounds so long as the liners are already filled with batter when you slide them onto the pans and the pans go into the oven immediately.",
      "PAN LINER CHOICES:\r\n* * *\r\nRegular foil (lightly greased): Tuiles baked on regular foil will spread in the oven, sometimes making beautiful but slightly irregular organic-shaped cookies with extra thin delicate edges. They will be even more irregular if the pan under the foil is not perfectly flat or the foil is creased or wrinkled! Don't choose regular foil if you want perfect control over the shape of your tuiles. Tuiles are easiest to remove from foil while very hot, or completely cool. \r\n* * *\r\nNon-stick foil: Tuiles baked on nonstick foil hold their shape and are easy to remove at any temperature.\r\n* * *\r\nSilicone mat (lightly greased): Tuiles baked on Silicone will hold their shape and can be removed at any temperature.\r\n* * *\r\nParchment: I don't recommend parchment because it does not brown the tuiles as well as the other choices."

If the foam is still warm or the butter too soft when you combine them, the buttercream will seem a little soupy instead of thick and creamy. If it doesn't come together and thicken with beating, set the bowl in a bowl of ice and water or in the refrigerator for 5 to 10 minutes; then resume beating until the mixture is creamy and smooth.",

Turn the mixer on and beat for several minutes, until well combined and frothy. With the motor still running, add the Lebkuchengewurz, salt, grated lemon peel, candied citron peel, candied orange peel, and all of the ground and chopped nuts. Mix until well combined.",
      "Using a paring knife, split the baking wafers in half. The inside surface will be gritty. Lay the wafers, smooth side down, on the prepared baking sheets. Using a small spoon or a palette knife, mound some of the batter neatly on each wafer. The batter should be very moist and spreadable, but it should also be able to hold its shape. If it's too liquid, add a few more spoonsful of ground nuts to the batter and mix well. For the 2-inch/5cm wafers, you'll need about 2 teaspoons of batter apiece; for the 23/4-inch/7cm wafers, about 3 tablespoons. \r\n\r\nAlternatively, you can fill a pastry bag fitted with a large round tip with the batter and pipe out rounds of the batter onto the prepared baking sheet, skipping the wafers. Leave about 1/2 inch/12mm of space between the rounds of batter.",
      "For a traditional look, you can decorate half of the Elisenlebkuchen with blanched and split almonds, pressing 1 almond half lightly into the middle of each of the 2-inch/5cm rounds of batter, or pressing 3 lightly into the middle of each of the 23/4-inch/7cm rounds of batter. (These almond-topped Elisenlebkuchen should be left plain after baking or glazed with the sugar glaze. The unadorned Elisenlebkuchen can be coated with melted chocolate.)",
      "Place one baking sheet in the oven and bake until the Elisenlebkuchen are golden and slightly puffed, about 20 minutes for the 2-inch/5cm size and 25 to 27 minutes for the 23/4-inch/7cm size. Repeat the assembly with the remaining wafers and batter while the first batch bakes. Remove the first batch from the oven and cool on a rack. Bake the second batch.",
      "To make the decorations: If you wish to coat the cookies with a sugar glaze, they must still be hot, so while the cookies you want to glaze are baking in the oven, place the confectioners' sugar and water in a small pan over medium-high heat. Bring to a boil and cook until the water has mostly evaporated and the glaze is thick with big bubbles. Remove from the heat, timing this to coincide with taking the cookies out of the oven. Immediately brush each Elisenlebkuchen with a thin layer of the hot glaze. Double or halve the glaze quantities as needed.",
      "If you wish to coat the cookies with chocolate, the Elisenlebkuchen should be fully cooled. Coarsely chop the chocolate, place in a metal bowl over a pot of simmering water, and melt, stirring, until smooth and glossy. Turn the undecorated cookies upside down and dip them evenly into the melted chocolate; let cool right-side up on a rack until set.",
      "When the glazed and chocolate-coated Elisenlebkuchen are set, store them in an airtight container, where they will keep for at least 2 months and up to 4 months."

      "Make the dough: In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, salt, and yeast with 3 cups cold water. Cover bowl with a damp towel, plastic wrap, or bowl cover and let sit for 12 to 18 hours at room temperature. Turn dough out onto a generously floured work surface. Divide into 6 equal portions. Shape each piece into a ball. Let sit for another hour or so or, if storing the dough for later use, transfer each round to a storage container and place in the refrigerator. (When using refrigerated dough, remove dough from fridge an hour or so before baking).",
      "Place a baking steel or pizza stone in the oven and preheat it to 550\u00b0F (or your oven's hottest setting). Allow the steel to heat for at least 45 minutes at 550\u00b0F before using it. Meanwhile, prepare the toppings: Place a large skillet over high heat. Add 1 tablespoon of oil. When it shimmers, add the onions, reduce the heat to medium or medium low, season with a pinch of salt, and saute, stirring every so often, for about 20 minutes or until the onions are lightly caramelized. Transfer onions to a bowl.",
      "In a separate large skillet over high heat, add another tablespoon of olive oil. When it shimmers, add the broccoli rabe, being careful of splattering if the broccoli rabe is wet. Season with a pinch of salt. Saute 1 to 2 minutes, using tongs to rearrange the leaves as necessary and encourage wilting. Transfer the greens to a bowl.",
      "In a small dry skillet over medium heat, brown the sausage until nearly cooked through, about 5 minutes. Break it up with a wooden spoon into small pieces as it browns. Transfer sausage to a bowl.",
      "To make each pizza: Place a piece of parchment paper on a pizza peel. (You may be able to cut parchment sheets in half to make the most of each sheet). Grab the edge of one round of dough with two hands and let the weight of the hanging dough stretch it out-rotate your hands around the edge of the dough to stretch it evenly. When it hints of tearing, transfer it to the sheet or parchment paper and stretch it further-it should be 8 to 10 inches in diameter. Spread 2 tablespoons of creme fraiche evenly over the surface using the back of a spoon. Gently push the dough out as you spread the creme fraiche to encourage a puffy outer edge.",
      "To make the peach pizza: Top the creme fraiche with a light layer of peaches. Drizzle lightly with olive oil. Sprinkle with sea salt. Bake 5 to 6 minutes or until the edges are puffed and golden. Top with fresh basil leaves out of the oven. Repeat with another round of dough.",
      "To make the broccoli rabe pizza: Top the creme fraiche with a light layer of caramelized onions, sauteed greens, and sausage. Drizzle lightly with olive oil. Sprinkle with sea salt. Bake 5 to 6 minutes or until the edges are puffed and golden. Repeat with another round of dough.",
      "To make the pepper and tomato pizza: Top the creme fraiche with a light layer of roasted red peppers (cut into strips) and a few tomatoes-too many and the pizza will be watery. Scatter with mozzarella, lightly, if you wish. Drizzle lightly with olive oil. Sprinkle with sea salt. Bake 5 to 6 minutes or until the edges are puffed and golden. Top with fresh basil leaves out of the oven. Repeat with another round of dough."

      "In the bowl of your mixer (fitted with a dough hook), combine the starter, 2 3/4 cups of flour, milk, butter, egg, 1/4 cup of sugar, salt, vanilla extract and the rest of the yeast. Mix together 3-5 minutes on low speed until the dough is smooth, supple and stretches easily. This is a very wet dough, so I think it would be hard to do this by hand. Place the dough in a bowl, covered with a clean towel, and let it rise for about an hour. It may not double--that's OK.",
      "Mix together the toasted pecans,chocolate, spices and brown sugar. Gently deflate the dough and knead the chocolate-pecan-spice mixture into the dough. Keep folding the dough over itself until the spices are blended through the dough and the nuts and chocolate are fairly evenly distributed (but it doesn't have to be perfect). Shape the dough into a flat ball and place it in a 9-inch round cake pan. Cover with plastic wrap and allow the loaf to rise till it fills up the pan and slightly crests over the top. (about 2 hours) Place pecan halves in on top of the cake.",
      "Heat the oven to 350 and place the rack in the center of the oven. Bake for 45-50 minutes. It should be golden brown and an instant-read thermometer placed in the center of the cake should read 190 degrees. Remove from oven, and after about 5 minutes, take it out of the pan. (You may need to slide a knife around the edge to help release it.) Let it cool completely.",
      "When the cake has cooled, mix the confectioner's sugar, salt and maple syrup together, and drizzle it over the top of the cake. (If you have any leftover, be sure and wrap it in plastic wrap or the cut surfaces will dry out!)"

      "To make the crust: Put the yeast, 1 teaspoon of the sugar, and 1/4 cup of the warm water (check the yeast package for the correct temperature) in a small bowl. Stir and let stand for about 5 minutes, or until the yeast dissolves and becomes creamy. The mixture may or may not bubble.",
      "Put the all-purpose, whole wheat, and rye flours, along with the remaining 1 teaspoon sugar and the salt, in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. (Alternatively, you can make this dough in a bowl with a wooden spoon.) Turn the mixer to low and beat just to blend the dry ingredients. Pour in the yeast mixture and continue to mix for a minute or two; the dough will be dry and shaggy, but that's fine. Mix the olive oil with the remaining 1/4 cup warm water, pour it into the bowl and mix at medium speed. The dough will quickly absorb the liquid and, in a minute or so, start to ball up around the paddle and slap the sides of the bowl. If the dough looks dry and doesn't come together, add some more water, a teaspoonful at a time. Depending on your flour (and the day), the dough might need just a splash or a couple of teaspoons water. Keep the mixer at medium speed and beat the dough for 5 minutes. (If you're working by hand, turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and knead the dough until it is smooth.) You'll have a springy, slightly sticky dough.",
      "Shape the dough into a ball, place it in a clean bowl and cover the bowl tightly with plastic film. Put the bowl in a warm spot (between 70\u00b0 and 75\u00b0 F) and allow the dough to rise until doubled in volume, 2 to 2 1/2 hours.",
      "Position a rack in the lower third of the oven and remove any higher racks; you'll need room to get the tarte flambee in and out quickly. If you've got a pizza or bread stone, put it on the rack; if not, put a heavy cookie sheet on the rack (or, in a pinch, flip over a rimmed baking sheet). Preheat the oven to its highest setting, as close to 600\u00b0 F as you can get. After the temperature indicator goes off, keep preheating for another 20 minutes -- remember, you've got to heat the stone as well as the oven. If you've got a pizza peel, have it at the ready; a rimless cookie sheet makes a good stand-in.",
      "Meanwhile, make the topping: Whisk all of the ingredients (except the apples) together in a medium bowl until smooth. Cover until needed.",
      "Turn the dough out onto a floured work surface and press it down with your palms. Lightly flour the top of the dough and start rolling it out. You can roll the dough into a rectangle, a circle, or something more free-form. Rolling a springy yeast dough like this isn't easy, and so I'm content to go with whatever shape I end up with; the shape is less important than the thinness. You want to roll the dough as thin as you possibly can and, to get it to behave and thin out, you might have to roll, let it rest for a few minutes, roll and rest again. Relax, and the dough will too. Each time you let the dough rest, cover it with plastic film or a kitchen towel.",
      "Lightly flour the preheated peel or rimless cookie sheet and transfer the dough to it. (I roll the dough up around my floured rolling pin and then unroll it onto the peel.) Brush off any excess flour and use a fork to prick the dough all over -- really, all over. You want to make sure you prick the dough all the way through, so listen for the rat-a-tat of the fork against the peel.",
      "Slide the baking stone into the oven, shut the oven door and set a timer for 1 minute. When the timer rings, pull out the tart. Depending on what kind of work surface you have, you can either put the hot tart on the counter or slide it onto a cooling rack. Using a flexible spatula or a large spoon, spread the topping over the crust, going very close to the edges.",
      "Cut a small slice off two opposite sides of each apple to expose the flesh and then slice each apple, from top to bottom, paper-thin on a mandolin or Benriner until you've almost reached the core on the first side of the apple. (If you don't have a mandoline, cut the apples in half from top to bottom and slice them with a thin blade on a food processor, or do this by hand.) Turn the apple to the opposite side and slice almost to the core. (The leftover piece encasing the core is the baker's nibble.) Arrange the apple slices in a single layer over the cream topping. Sprinkle generously with sugar or cinnamon sugar.",
      "Slide the tart back onto the baking stone and bake for about 5 minutes more. You want the crust to be dark and well baked on the bottom, and if you've got a burnt edge here or there and the occasional curled and browned apple slice, so much the better. Transfer the tart to a cutting board, immediately cut it with a pizza wheel or chef 's knife and serve.",
      "Serving: Just like pizza, tarte flambee is meant to be eaten seconds out of the oven. At Flamme & Co, the dessert is served with a fork and knife (the way just about everything is served in France), but chez you, it's fine to pick it up and eat it out of hand -- it's what we do chez moi.",
      "Storing: Once made, the tart has to be eaten immediately. You can make the dough a day ahead, let it rise, flatten it and put it in the refrigerator. Keep flattening it as it rises and then, when it's worn itself out (usually in an hour or two), wrap it tightly in plastic film and keep it cold. When you're ready to make the tart, take the dough out of the refrigerator, put it in a covered bowl in a warm place and allow it to rise to double its size again."

      "Rinse and pat dry your greens. Add to a salad bowl. Pinch your pea pods to open them, then loosen each pea with your finger to release them into your salad bowl. Slice the cherry tomatoes in half, and the spring onion into thin rounds. Add the tomatoes and onions to your salad.\r\n\r\nPut the tofu and garlic into a small electric bender and blend until the tofu is creamy and the garlic is completely mashed. Cut your lemon in half and squeeze in the juice. Add the dill and curry powder and mix well. Drizzle in the olive oil and just lightly pulse a few times. Crack the pepper in and just light stir with a spatula. Taste and adjust lemon, spices, and add, maybe maybe, a pinch of salt. Use the spatula to pour the dressing over the salad. The consistency will be thick, but once tossed, the greens, tomatoes, and peas will add their moisture to give it a beautiful balance between creamy and crunchy, soft and snappy, soothing and fresh.\r\n\r\nGarnish with a generous helping of sunflower seeds, and a sprig of fresh rosemary.\r\n\r\nI also tossed into the salad a handful of fresh cilantro. I love treating mint, cilantro, parsley as if they are more than garnish, but leaves with their own rightful place in the salad.",
