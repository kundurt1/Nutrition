I followed the scaled measurements except only used a pinch of cayenne and chili powder. Concern was it may be too spicy for kids. I did not have celery seed, so I had to leave it out. If you like a sweet and spicy sauce you must try this recipe. I will use this on chicken, pulled pork and ribs. UPDATE: I've made this again using the celery seed and think I like the taste without it. Also for a nice thick sauce it is necessary to simmer on low for at least 20 minutes. And advice to anyone wanting to make it, don't leave out the liquid smoke! I didn't have any, so I was just going to leave it out, but then my son offered to buy me some and when we added it it was SO much better and really added to the flavor. Only suggestions are that oil can be substituted for the butter or left out alltogether, the molasses can be reduced and it's still sweet, and the chili powder, cayenne, and pepper should probably be doubled. Red pepper is also wonderful for the flavor.",
      "I am helping in catering a wedding reception the end of this month and needed a sauce I could call my own, so my kitchen was tore up from the floor up! I measured the spices and saved them for later, then I mixed up the liquids over a slow flame, I did not have any red wine vinegar, but I did have some marsala I mixed 1/4c. and the balance I used of white vinegar, I did not add the butter, I figured the fat from the meat would be enough and I wanted it to have some table time. The sauce tasted good but it had no depth, I only used 3 teaspoons of liquid smoke, and let it simmer for a while. Once I added the spices it was the bomb! This is the best sauce I have ever tasted. The spices are fantastic! Whoever thought cinnamon would work in a bbq sauce? I told my husband, we have to go get a piece of meat to go with the sauce. Thanks for sharing, this is great! I also simmered it for about 1 1/2 hours to thicken, Uuummm finger licken good! I will serve it with pulled pork and baked chicken, I am sure you could serve this with fingernails, and toe-jams.",
      "I made just as is (but halved the recipe= 1 1/2 C) and I simmered it for about 50 minutes. The next day it was nice and thick. The liquid smoke is a great flavor in this (a must!), and mellows out by the next day. I also used a pinch of cayenne, so the kids could eat it. I used this on some pulled pork, next it'll go on grilled chicken. Next time I'll make the full batch to keep on hand."

Blanche cabbage 25 minutes. Cut everything in small pieces. Bring to a boil. Close and cook on low until soft.",
      "- The recipes are just guidelines. I don't like leeks and they're a bit too expensive too, so don't use them. I added lots of garlic and onion (sauteed in a bit of olive oil), and herbs. Sprouts are a great addition, sprinkled just before eating. Once I added 1 tbsp of my favorite bottled salsa (Herdez) and a handful of chopped cilantro to my dish. When I was desperately hungry I ate some nuts (they do fill you up and are \"good\" fat) and once a thin slice of Mexican fresh cheese (low on fat). After the diet I kept carbs low, ate only sprouted bread, tortillas and chapatis (Ezekiel, Genesis, etc), or whole grain/brown rice bread. I use Splenda and try to avoid cane/beet sugar. When you think you might kill for a taste of chocolate, try this \"Low Carb 3 Minute Chocolate Cake\": 1/4 cup soy flour; 1 tbsp cocoa powder (Nestle Toll House); 1/4 tsp baking powder; 5 (1 g) packets Splenda; 2 tsp melted butter; 1 tbsp water; 1 egg. Blend flour, cocoa, baking powder, splenda in a 2-cup baking dish. Add water, butter and egg; blend thoroughly with fork. Cover with plastic wrap and cut a small vent in the top. Microwave on HIGH 1 min, until knife comes out clean. Cool or eat warm with whipped cream. (This does NOT taste like soy!) Try also the \"South Beach Muffin\": 1 large egg; 1 1/2 tsp Splenda; 1 tsp cinnamon (I mix cinnamon + nutmeg); 2 tsp plain fat-free yogurt; 1/2 tsp baking powder; 3 tbsp ground flax seeds. Spray microwave safe ramekin/bowl with cooking spray (or use muffin liner). Mix egg and splenda with fork until well combined; add yogurt, blend well. Mix in flaxseed, cinnamon and baking powder until well combined. Pour in ramekin; microwave on HIGH 1:30 minute (Note: dish should be no more than 1/2 full; these rise a lot.) Best served hot. Then, there is the \"South Beach Diet Flax Cracker\": 4 tbsp flax seed meal; 2 tbsp chicken broth; 2 tbsp water; spices; salt. Mix flax and liquid. Add spices + salt. Spread thin on parchment paper. Microwave 2-3 minutes. Serve with Hummus bi Tahine, low fat/carb dip or cheese. If you like chapatti-like breads, you will love this."

Use your judgement and add a little more wine to further deglaze the pan, if needed. Stirring constantly, slowly pour cream into pan, about 1/2 cup. Let the sauce simmer and thicken.

The dough is nothing like wheat bread dough. It is very moist and slippery and cannot be kneaded. When a handful is squeezed, it will squirt out between your fingers.",

There's not much rising that goes on and too much air space in the bread would be detrimental to the texture.

Lay a piece of parchment paper over the top of the form and then cover tightly with aluminum foil.

In another saucepan melt 3tbsp of butter then blend in 3 tbsp of flour, then slowly pour milk mixture into the butter mixture, bring to a soft boil on med/ med-high until sauce is thick. set aside in a bowl. In a SKILLETT add 3 tbsp of oil on meduim/ med-high add i would say almost all of the spinach and almost all of the carrots UNTIL YOU HAVE AN EVEN AMOUNT OF BOTH carrot and spinach, add 1/2 tea salt to veggies, cook until veggies are soft, then add milk mixture to veggies if sauce is a little thin you can cook until it gets a liitle thicker. place mixture in bowl off to the side. now comes the fun part. preheat oven to 350. get a 13x9 pan and take a bit of nonstick spray to the pan. take the beaten egg and mix it into the container of cottage cheese. open one of the jars of sauce and place i would say maybe a 1/2 cup of prego sauce on bottom of the pan so noodles do not get dry as they bake. (now comes the layering) place 3 or 4 no boil noodles across pan over the prego sauce. then add a few spoonfuls of white sauce, a few spoonfuls of prego sauce again, a few spoonfuls of cottage cheese, a handful of both mozzerella and yellow cheese mix and a sprinkle of parm cheese, now doing the same again repeating the layers again,noodles,white sauce,redsauce,cottage cheese, both shredded cheeses and a sprinkle of parm cheese. you should get about 4 or 5 layers of noodles, of course ending with a nice cheese top and sprinkle with parm cheese.now place tented foil over pan making a tight seal around the edges careful not to touch cheese. place in oven. bake for about 1 hour, the noodles will be done because they are a no-boil. I also like to uncover after 1 hour and bake maybe 5-10 min more to brown the top keep a careful eye not to burn it .if you have any problems lets me know."
