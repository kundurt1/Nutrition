      "Start with creating your beef patty. Add salt, black pepper and white pepper to the meat and work it well together and add a small part of your melted butter as well (you will need the rest for later). Divide the meat into 2 equal parts and create two patties. Try to press hard and not to leave any air inside of the minced meat. Coat it from all sides with the melted butter and leave it to rest on a plate in your kitchen to allow the temperature of the meat to be more close to the room temperature. \n\nNow prepare your dip. Mince 2 garlic cloves and then with a side of a knife mash it with the help of a little salt until you get a smooth garlic mash. Combine it with your mayonnaise or Greek yogurt together and your dried parsley. Stir well and cover and set aside in the fridge.",
      "For your burger sauce: In a mug add all ingredients (mayonnaise, cayenne pepper, ketchup, mustard, white pepper, salt) and stir well with a spoon. Cover and set aside in your fridge (you can use a little of the liquid from your pickles as well - not too much so the sauce does not become too runny).\n\nWash and prepare your carrots, cucumber and tomato. Cut your carrots and cucumber into long wedges in order for them to represent your ,fries, and to easily dip them in your garlic sauce. Slice your tomato horizontally.",
      "It is time to fry your meat. Heat up a pan on medium heat. Wait until your pan is heated up. Add some oil.\nAnd add your patties. You can season your patty with extra pepper and salt. \nIn order to help the meat to cook faster and more evenly and preserve the correct shape press down a heavy pot on top of your meat. Apply the pressure for at least a minute. And again if your patty is starting to change it's shape later on. Add your leftover butter for extra taste - make sure your pan is not too hot since it is much easier to burn your butter than oil (if you do not have any leftover you can of course use some fresh from the fridge).\nYour will need to fry it for about 7 minutes from both sides to have it well done but still juicy. Set aside to rest when it is ready.\n\nSlice your red and white onions into very thin slices and your pickles as well. Wash your salad.\n\nNow it is only time to dress all prepared ingredients on your plate. The onions, pickles, salad, beef patty and burger sauce goes into the tomato and the carrots, cucumbers and garlic dip goes on the side.\n\nEnjoy.",
      "TIP: I personally love the taste of pickles with the beef patty so I add A LOT of pickles to my plate - to me it enhances the taste so much in such a good way."

      "Wash and peel the celery root first, this will take the longest to cook. Since the root is very tough on the outside and a bit bumpy, it is easier to use your knife and cut away the outer layer. Trim off the top and bottom ends, and sit the celery root up on the flat surface. Use a chef's knife to carve away the outer layers and leave just the white flesh. Chop the celery root into uniform-sized pieces. Put the celery root chunks in a pot and cover with chicken stock. For 3 large celery roots, you'll need about 2 quarts of stock. Bring to a boil and cook for 15 minutes until fork-tender.",
      "While the celery root is cooking, start prepping your other vegetables. Chop two white onions, 1 large shallot, 4 garlic cloves and saute in a pan with canola oil and a nob of butter. I used some Ronnybrook Farm Dairy garlic butter that I bought at the farmers market, but any unsalted butter is fine. Peel the butternut squash and chop into very tiny cubes. You will only need about a cup to garnish the 8 servings of soup. Reserve the rest of the butternut squash for another meal. Saute the butternut squash in a pan or roast in the oven. Be careful not to burn them because the pieces are very small. They should be soft throughout and have a golden caramelized outside. Blot on a paper towel until ready to use.",
      "When the celery root pieces are cooked and you're able to smash it with a spoon on your cutting board, drain them and reserve the chicken stock for the soup. Puree the celery root in a food processor or blender. Slowly add the chicken stock back into the mixture. I ended up using almost all of the chicken stock but use enough to get the soup to the correct consistency. Puree the onion, shallot, garlic mixture and add this to the soup. Add a half-cup of heavy cream and season to taste with salt and pepper. When you're ready to eat, ladle the soup into a bowl and garnish with the butternut squash pieces, a few greens (I used sunflower greens from Windfall Farms, and drizzle with a little bit of truffle oil or high quality olive oil. I used 100% organic daRosario Organics Black Truffle Flavored Olive Oil. It tastes amazing, it's USDA certified organic and includes pieces of real truffles. I hop you enjoy this soup recipe. It should be perfect for snowy winter days and all of the veg are available at your local farmers markets and grocery stores this time of year."
