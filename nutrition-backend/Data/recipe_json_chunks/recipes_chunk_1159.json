      "To make the pesto, preheat an oven to 350\u00b0F Spread the nuts on a baking sheet and toast until they take on color and are fragrant, 5 to 8 minutes. Let cool. In a food processor, combine the nuts, basil and garlic. Pulse until the basil is chopped. Add the cheese and pulse to combine. With the motor running, pour in the 1/2 cup oil, a few drops at a time, until the mixture has the consistency of mayonnaise, adding more oil as needed. Season with salt and pepper. You will need 1/4 cup of the pesto for the soup.",
      "To make the soup, if using dried beans, pick over and discard any misshapen beans and stones. Rinse, drain and place in a pot with water to cover by 2 inches. Bring to a boil, boil for 2 minutes, then cover, remove from the heat and let stand for 1 hour. Drain and return to the pot with fresh water to cover by 2 inches. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat to low, cover and simmer until tender, 45 to 60 minutes. Add salt during the last 10 minutes of cooking. If using canned beans, drain and rinse well.",
      "In a large soup pot over medium heat, warm the olive oil. Add the onions and cook, stirring, until softened and translucent, about 10 minutes. Add the pancetta and cook, stirring, until tender, about 5 minutes more. Add the carrots and celery and cook, stirring, until beginning to soften, just a few minutes. Add the tomatoes and enough water to cover amply. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat to low, cover and simmer until the tomatoes break down, about 10 minutes.",
      "Meanwhile, if desired, place half of the white beans in a food processor or blender with a little of the cooking liquid or, if using canned beans, a little broth. Puree until smooth.",
      "Add the potatoes, zucchini, green beans, white beans (including pureed, if using), Swiss chard (if using) and pasta to the pot and simmer until the vegetables and pasta are cooked, about 15 minutes. Stir often to prevent sticking. Swirl in the 2 Tbs. extra-virgin olive oil. Season with salt and pepper.",
      "Remove from the heat and stir in the pesto. Ladle into warmed bowls and serve immediately. Pass the Parmesan at the table."

    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "Early in the day (earlier the better) make the cornbread, when done, place in a large bowl and break into large chunks. Also, I make my cornbread southern style, heating some bacon fat in the pan, as the oven heats, before pouring in the batter. (by the way, I'm doing this so early, and starving, so I usually have a small slice for breakfast - hey I'm human :) Lay bread slices on top ( you can tear those up a bit if you want). The purpose is to let it all dry out a bit. If you are cooking the turkey at home - take the giblets, neck etc out of the turkey, place in sauce pan, cover with water and bring to a boil, then simmer about an hour.",
      "Remove the turkey parts from the broth, and add the diced celery and onion, bring to a boil again, then simmer about 30 to 45 minutes. If you aren't making your own turkey, use chicken broth or turkey broth (if you can find it)- Trader Joes has it, if you have one in your area, probably about 2 cans. Dump entire hot mixture of liquid and veggies onto the cornbread/bread in the bowl. Use a potato masher to start mashing it up.",
      "Again if you are making your own turkey, at this point your turkey should be about done, because you would have started cooking it sometime after you finished the cornbread. Use a turkey baster to start taking turkey juice and transferring it to the bowl. (I use a cooking/turkey bag) to make my turkey, so I always have a ton of juice, enough for the dressing, and to make gravy.) After every couple of additions, mash it in some more. At this point you can use an electric hand mixer.",
      "Mixture should be a bit soupy. At this point, add seasonings. I'd guess about 1/4 teaspoon sage, and 1 teaspoon poultry seasoning. Taste, then add a little salt and a little pepper. Taste again, then decide if you want more poultry seasoning or sage - just remember a little sage goes a long way. Once it tastes like you want it, beat in the raw eggs, using the hand mixer, mix it on medium or high speed about 2 minutes.",
      "Again, if you aren't making your own turkey, you can use chicken broth, you'll need to heat it up, and I'm not quite sure how much it would take, my guess is 3 cans, but have extra on hand just in case. The broth that comes in boxes is fine to use - I prefer to not use the swansons brand, it's not as rich as some of the other brands that come in a box. Just remember, again, this mixture should be pretty soupy - the raw eggs are what's going to make it set.",
      "Generously butter a large casserole (if you don't have at least a 3quart casserole, you can use more than one, and pour the dressing mixture into that. Bake at 350 about an hour. It should puff up just a little bit, be a bit brown on top. Test for doneness by sticking in a toothpick, or you can use a butter knife, it should come out basically clean. Serve with Turkey and gravy."

      "Step 3: Skim off as much scum as possible as it forms.",

      "Step 5: Use a saw and saw halfway down the center of the bones. Then use hammer to break bone.",
      "Note: I didn't have to break the bones since my butcher's pork hocks already had the marrow exposed.",
      "Step 6: The bones will be filled with marrow. Simmer for several hours until the marrow dissolves out from the bones.",
      "Step 7: Scum will form at the start. Carefully skim the scum off. On mid flame, maintain a low boil.",
      "Step 8: After scum has stopped forming, simmer for 6 hours or more. Add more water if the water level drops.",
      "Step 9: Making the noodles. After measuring out the ingredients, mix the flour and kansui together, then add the water. It may feel as if the amount of water is insufficient. This is normal.",
      "Step 10: Mix in bowl until a mealy consistency is achieved.",
      "Step 11: The dough will be very stiff. Use you body weight to form the dough into a ball.",
      "Step 12: Transfer to kneading surface and knead. Knead vigorously for 10 minutes. It is ok if the dough cracks or does not knead together well.",
      "Step 13: Form into ball, cover with plastic wrap and allow to rest in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes. Make sure that the dough does not dry out.",
      "Step 14: While the dough rests, prepare the char siu. Brown the meat in a pan and then simmer in a pot for 2 hours in a sauce made from the remaining ingredients. Allow to cool in the pot.",
      "Step 15: After the dough has rested, roll the dough out with a rolling pin to a thickness of 5 mm and then insert into pasta machine. Start out with the highest thickness and then continue on the lower settings until the desired thickness is achieved.",
      "Step 16: If a pasta machine is not used, roll out the dough to the desired thickness with the rolling pin. Take into account that the noodles will expand 1.3 times when boiled.",
      "Step 17: The dough will not be that sticky, so a small amount of flour or potato (or corn) starch is sufficient for flouring. (Note that the recipe only shows the noodles being cut by a pasta machine and does not mention hand cutting).",
      "Step 18: A wooden box is best for storing the noodles, but if one is not available, use a metal tray lined with wax paper (to prevent sticking) and store in the refrigerator.",
      "Step 19: 2 hours after the pork bones have started simmering, the soup should become progressively white and cloudy. If tasted at this stage, the soup will not taste good since it will still have a raw flavor.",
      "Step 20: After the soup has simmered for 6 hours, The inside of the bones should now be empty and the soup should have a rich smell just like a ramen place.",
      "The stock is rich. It exactly like the picture, it's not a clear stock at all. Just remember that it won't have much taste right now because there's no salt. But don't adjust the seasoning until the end of the recipe because you're adding soy sauce to the ramen base.",
      "Step 21: The char siu should be a nice amber color. Slice with care since it will be very tender and tend to fall apart.",
      "Step 22: Any leftovers can be eaten with beer.",
      "LOL But I will add that if you ever have trouble slicing soft pork, chill the whole piece in the refrigerator until cold, and it makes slicing easier. Reheating is easy, in either the microwave or oven, even stove top.",
      "Step 23: It's time to put everything together. Since boiling time can differ, boil the noodles to each person's preference. For people who like curly noodles, firmly squeeze the noodles until the desired effect is achieved.",
      "Step 24: Warm the bowl, and add the char siu sauce and salt for flavor. Use sparingly at first and then add more if desired.",
      "Step 25: I prefer to boil the noodles for 1 1/2 to 2 minutes. Your rich and hearty tonkotsu ramen is complete.",

The the water is at a full boil, I put the eggs inches The water should cover the eggs. Wait for the water to come back to a full boil, and time for 7 minutes. (9 minutes will give you a fully hard boiled egg. 7 minutes is a very soft boiled egg.) Drain the pot and eggs and plunge the eggs in ice water to stop cooking. This also makes the shells a bit easier to peel.",
      "Step 2: In a small pot, saute pork, garlic, onions, and ginger until slightly browned. Add soy sauce, cooking alcohol, sugar, water and simmer for 10 minutes. Until pork is cooked through and flavors meld. Remove from stove. Remove pork to eat separately. Pour everything else into a bowl large enough to hold marinade and eggs.",
      "Step 3: Carefully, peel the eggs, and place in marinade. Try to make sure the marinade covers all of the eggs. If not, try transferring the sauce into a large ZipLock bag, and place the eggs in the bag and seal. Place the bag in a bowl, and put everything in the refrigerator overnight. Or at least for a few hours.",
      "Soy sauce eggs ready!",

So either bring your leftover spaghetti or cooked spaghetti to ROOM temperature Make sure that the spaghetti is done and tender, not undercooked.",
