If it holds together, transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface; if not, add a couple of teaspoons of ice water and test again. Knead gently and form into a ball, divide the pastry in half, and flatten into 2 disks. Wrap each disk in plastic and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes before using.",
      "Make the tart: Roll out the pastry on a floured surface and line a 9-inch or 9 1/2-inch (23-cm or 24-cm) tart pan. Prick the base of the tart with a fork and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.",
      "Preheat the oven to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C).",
      "Place the tart shell on a baking sheet. Line the tart with parchment paper and fill it with dried beans. Bake until the pastry is just set, about 15 minutes. Remove the paper and beans and continue to cook until the pastry is a dark golden color, 10 to 15 minutes. Transfer the tart to a wire rack and leave to cool completely.",
      "Combine the sugar and butter in a deep, heavy saucepan over medium heat. Stir to mix and cook, stirring occasionally, until the butter and sugar caramelize, 10 to 15 minutes. The sugar and butter will go through several stages. First it will look like a flour-butter roux, then it will appear curdled, and then the butter will leak out of the sugar mixture. Don't worry: It will all come together in the end.",
      "While the caramel is cooking, pour the cream into a saucepan and bring it to a boil over medium heat. Remove from the heat and set aside.",
      "Keep stirring the butter-sugar mixture, watching carefully as it begins to caramelize and remembering that the heat in the pan will continue to cook the caramel once it is removed from the burner. You want a rich, dark caramel color, but you don't want to burn the mixture, which will give it a bitter taste. When the caramel reaches the right color, remove the pan from the heat and slowly and carefully pour in the cream; the mixture will bubble and spit. When the caramel stops bubbling, return it to low heat and cook for 5 minutes, stirring to dissolve the caramel in the cream. Remove the pan from the heat and let the caramel cool for 10 minutes. Slowly pour the cooled caramel into the baked pastry shell and chill the tart for at least 2 hours.",
      "This tart is easier to cut when it is chilled. Remove the tart from the pan and, using a wet knife, cut it into wedges. Serve the tart at room temperature, however, for maximum flavor, with a dollop of whipped cream."

This can take about 15 minutes total. Transfer to a plate, then add the onion, carrot and celery, stirring to coat in the pan fat. Cook for about 10 minutes, stirring, until browned at the edges. At this point, the giblets (heart, liver, gizzard) can be added and sauteed until lightly browned, if desired. Transfer the contents of the pot to a plate; reserve for later use.",

Place it over medium-high heat; when it is quite hot, add the broth and use a wooden spoon to dislodge any browned bits in the bottom of the pot. Add the bones, trimmings and vegetables, stirring to combine, then add the bay leaves and thyme, 1/4 teaspoon of salt and a few grinds of pepper. Once the liquid starts to bubble at the edges, reduce the heat to medium or medium-low and cook for 30 minutes, occasionally skimming off any foam or scum that rises to the top. Then cover and cook for 1 to 1 1/2 hours, during which time you can add the heart and gizzard to cook for 15 minutes and 45 minutes, respectively, then remove to cool and reserve for later use, if desired.",
      "Strain the stock through a fine-mesh strainer into an 8-cup container, discarding the solids. You should have about 6 cups. Taste, and adjust the seasoning as needed. Cool to room temperature, then cover and refrigerate so that any remaining fat rises to the top and can be discarded.",

      "Heat a teaspoon or two of the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the sausage meat in several pinches/pieces. Cook for about 5 minutes, until it is no longer pink (but not fully browned), stirring often to break up the meat. Use a slotted spoon to transfer to the paper towel-lined bowl to drain.",
      "Add the remaining oil and the butter to the skillet; increase the heat to medium-high and add the onion, celery, mushrooms, sage, salt and pepper, stirring to combine. Cook for about 8 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables have slightly softened. Return the drained sausage to the skillet, then add the broth and cook for about 1 minute, stirring.",
      "While the vegetables are cooking, place the cornbread cubes in a large mixing bowl. Add the cooked vegetables and sausage, and toss to combine, crumbling some of the cornbread to form a stuffing that is moist yet loose. Taste and adjust seasoning as needed.

Use a large butcher's knife to carefully cut off the ends of the drumsticks bone; discard the nubs. Use a sharp knife to cut the leg-thigh section from the bird, keeping them together as one large piece.

Place the roasting pan with the stuffed legs on the upper rack and the pan with the whole turkey breast/stuffing on the lower rack. Roast for 30 minutes.",

      "Remove the pan of stuffed legs from the oven; turn them seam side down on the rack, then use a pastry brush to baste them with half of the cider mixture. Return them to the oven and roast for about 1 hour, or until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the drumstick meat registers 170 degrees. The legs should be browned and crisp. Transfer to a cutting board and let cool for a few minutes.",

Use the remaining cider mixture to baste the skin, then return the pan to the oven and roast for 1 hour, or until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the breast meat (close to the bone) registers 155 to 160 degrees. Transfer the whole turkey breast to a serving platter, and transfer the stuffing to a serving bowl; cover loosely with aluminum foil to keep warm.",

Remove from the heat; strain through a fine-mesh strainer into a medium saucepan, discarding any solids.",
      "Place the saucepan over medium heat so the strained mixture heats through. Add the roasted giblets or gizzard, if desired, and allow to heat through. Then use an immersion (stick) blender to puree them in the liquid.",
      "Whisk together the potato starch or arrowroot and the port in a small measuring cup. Add to the saucepan, whisking, and cook until the liquid in the pan thickens slightly to form a gravy. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Reduce the heat and keep warm on the lowest setting.",
      "When ready to serve, discard the toothpicks in the stuffed legs, then, if desired, use needlenose pliers to carefully dislodge and remove any white tendons that should now be visible on the drumsticks. Arrange the legs in natural positions on either side of the turkey breast; if desired, spoon some of the warm gravy over the turkey pieces before taking the platter and the bowl of warm stuffing to the table. Pour the remaining gravy into a warmed gravy boat.",
      "To serve, cut the stuffed thighs crosswise into 1/2- or 3/4-inch slices that show stuffing at their center. Carve the remaining turkey at the table; pass the gravy at the table."

Pork tenderloin is a very lean, tender cut from the loin section. It is long and slender, and usually weighs between 3/4 and 1 1/2 pounds. It has a mild flavor, so it benefits from being prepared with a rub, marinade or sauce, but does NOT benefit from extended cooking. To keep tenderloin juicy, make sure you don't overcook it.

Also, be sure to remove all giblets and other stuff from the cavity of the chicken before brining.",

Mix melted butter, vegetable oil, salt, pepper, cayenne, garlic powder, thyme, and rosemary to coat the bird both inside and out. I also put a quartered onion, 2 tbs butter, and some garlic inside the cavity. The can of chicken stock at bottom of pan is good for basting about every 15 minutes. Cook at 350 for about 1 hour and 15 minutes under aluminum foil. Cook another 20 minutes w/ foil off to finish the bird. Make sure that juices run clear and chicken is white throughout. Internal temperature should be 180\u00b0F."

Basically, I just fill a gallon baggie and use that and the weight of the baggie just depends on what kinds of trimmings I've put in during the week.",
      "I keep a gallon freezer baggie in the freezer and dump my veggie trimmings in it after each meal I cook. In no time at all, maybe a week or two, the bag is full and ready to use for making stock.",
      "Empty the gallon baggie of veggie trimmings into a large stew pot or stock pot, along with the bay leaf and peppercorns. Add 8 cups of water and see where your water level is. Remember it. This is the point where you will refill after reducing. Go ahead and add the other 4 cups of water and the salt. Resist the urge to stir!",
      "Bring to a nice simmer over high heat, then reduce heat to maintain the simmer.",
      "Never ever stir! You can use the back of a wooden spoon to gently push the veggies down into the liquid every now and then, but don't stir. If you do, your stock will come out cloudy. By resisting the urge to stir, your stock will be crystal clear and beautiful. If it does cloud up, it's still good, just not nearly as pretty.",
      "When the liquid has reduced by 4 cups, add another 4 cups of water and continue to simmer. Do this 2 more times, for a total of 3 times. You are essentially reducing the water 100% by reducing by a third three times.",
      "After the final reduction, remove from heat and strain through a colander. Squeeze all of the stock out of the veggies, then discard the veggies.",
      "Strain the stock through a sieve, and then strain again through a fine mesh. I use a permanent coffee filter for this step.",
      "At this point, I pour the stock off into plastic cups in 8 ounce portions. Let cool completely at room temperature, then freeze. Cooling your stock off too quickly results in clouding.",
      "When the stock is frozen, I pop each stock \"cube\" out of its cup, wrap it in parchment or wax paper, and put all the stock into a big gallon freezer bag.",
      "To reconstitute, melt an 8 ounce portion of the frozen stock, add an equal amount of water and a teaspoon of salt. Stir well to dissolve the salt. The stock will keep in the fridge for up to a week.",
      "I use this stock for rice, soups, sauces, etc. If the recipe calls for water and it's a savory dish, I use stock instead. It can also be substituted for chicken stock in most cases.",
      "This recipe makes 8 cups of stock and dilutes to 16 cups.",
      "Don't worry if you're not a big veggie eater. I live alone and cook for 1, and I don't eat as many veggies as I should, and still I have enough trimmings to make stock every 7 to 14 days. My bags are usually full of onion and garlic skins, onion ends, pepper ends and seeds and membranes, celery ends, cucumber ends and peels, salad trimmings, and herb stems. The stock is fantastic! If you throw in some red onion skin, your stock will be a lovely mahogany color."

      "Wash artichokes under cold water. Using a heavy stainless steel knife, cut off the stems close to the base. Pull off the lower petals that are small and tough. Cut off the top inch of the artichoke and rub with half a lemon to preserve the green color. Or you may put the artichokes in water that has some lemon juice in it. If you wish, trim the thorny tips of the petals with kitchen shears.",
      "Place the artichokes in the steaming broth, bottom up. Cover and simmer for about 30 minutes. The artichokes are done when a knife is inserted into the base and there is no resistance.",
      "To eat, pull off a leaf and scrape the meat off the tender end with your front teeth. Dip the ends of the leaves in lemon juice and melted butter if desired. When you reach the center cone of purple prickly leaves, remove it. This is the choke that protects the heart. Now, scrape away the thistle fuzz covering the artichoke heart. The heart is the meatiest and in my opinion, the best part of the artichoke. Steamed artichokes may be served hot or cold. Enjoy!",
