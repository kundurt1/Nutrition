      "Add almonds and rosemary to your KitchenAid(R) K400 Blender. Close lid, select \"Ice Crush\" setting, and let blender run through the setting. Scrape down the sides of the blender with a rubber spatula, then replace lid and blend on speed 5 for 10 seconds. Scrape sides again and blend on speed 5 for a final 15-20 seconds, or until almonds and rosemary are finely ground.",
      "Pour the almond mixture from blender in a small mixing bowl. Add all-purpose flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Whisk to combine, and set aside.",

      "Assemble the cakes. Use a sharp knife to cut off the ends of four of the citrus fruits. Slice the citrus into very thin rounds, no thicker than 1/8\". Remove any seeds from the rounds and place one small citrus round in the bottom of each sugared muffin cavity. (See Chef's Notes for choosing/placing citrus.)",
      "Slowly fill each muffin cavity to a little more than halfway full. (A pastry spatula is helpful in portioning the batter from the blender and into the cavities.) Bake cakes for 20-25 minutes, rotating the pans halfway through baking. Cakes are done when a toothpick inserted into the cakes comes out clean.",
      "While cakes are baking, make the rosemary syrup. Add sugar, water, and rosemary sprig to a small saucepan set to medium-high heat. Stir until sugar dissolves and then bring to a boil. Let boil for 2 minutes, then reduce to a simmer for 5 minutes. Remove from the heat to steep and cool for 10 minutes.",
      "When cakes are done baking, place the pans on a wire rack and allow the cakes to cool in the pan for 8-10 minutes. Carefully run a sharp knife around outside of each cake to unstick the sides, place the cooling rack on top of the pan and flip the pan and rack over. Remove the pan to release the cakes.",
      "Discard the rosemary sprig from the syrup, then finish the cakes by generously brushing the syrup over the tops of the cakes. Cakes are best served warm, but still delicious if served at room temperature.",
      "CHEF'S NOTES: Use the base of your muffin tin as a guide when selecting citrus. You may need to cut some rounds into a \"C\" shape and fold them in on themselves. Save leftover orange pieces in a plastic bag in the refrigerator.",
      "Blood oranges add the most dramatic color variation, but any citrus of choice can be used, including lemons, limes or kumquats. This makes more rosemary syrup than you will need. We recommend portioning 1/3 cup of the syrup into a small bowl for dipping your pastry brush into while glazing, and saving the remaining syrup in an airtight glass container. The leftover syrup can be used for lemonade, cocktails, etc. Assembled cakes can be kept for up to 3 days in an airtight container stored at room temperature."

      "Pulse all ingredients together until a rough, coarse meal forms. Scrape the sides of the processor periodically and push the mixture down the sides. Process till the mixture is somewhere between the texture of couscous and a paste. You want the mixture to hold together, and a more paste-like consistency will help with that... but don't overprocess, you don't want it turning into hummus!",
      "Once the mixture reaches the desired consistency, pour it out into a bowl and use a fork to stir; this will make the texture more even throughout. Remove any large chickpea chunks that the processor missed.",
      "Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1-2 hours.\nNote: Some people like to add baking soda to the mix to lighten up the texture inside of the falafel balls. I don't usually add it, since the falafel is generally pretty fluffy on its own. If you would like to add it, dissolve 2 tsp of baking soda in 1 tbsp of water and mix it into the falafel mixture after it has been refrigerated.\nFill a skillet with vegetable oil to a depth of 1 1/2 inches. I prefer to use cooking oil with a high smoke point, like grapeseed. Heat the oil slowly over medium heat. Meanwhile, form falafel mixture into round balls or slider-shaped patties using wet hands or a falafel scoop. I usually use about 2 tbsp of mixture per falafel. You can make them smaller or larger depending on your personal preference. The balls will stick together loosely at first, but will bind nicely once they begin to fry.\nNote: if the balls won't hold together, place the mixture back in the processor again and continue processing to make it more paste-like. Keep in mind that the balls will be delicate at first; if you can get them into the hot oil, they will bind together and stick. If they still won't hold together, you can try adding 2-3 tbsp of flour to the mixture. If they still won't hold, add 1-2 eggs to the mix. This should fix any issues you are having.",
      "Before frying my first batch of falafel, I like to fry a test one in the center of the pan. If the oil is at the right temperature, it will take 2-3 minutes per side to brown (5-6 minutes total). If it browns faster than that, your oil is too hot and your falafels will not be fully cooked in the center. Cool the oil down slightly and try again. When the oil is at the right temperature, fry the falafels in batches of 5-6 at a time till golden brown on both sides.",
      "Once the falafels are fried, remove them from the oil using a slotted spoon.",
      "Let them drain on paper towels. Serve the falafels fresh and hot; they go best with a plate of hummus and topped with creamy tahini sauce. You can also stuff them into a pita.",
      "Troubleshooting: If your falafel is too hard/too crunchy on the outside, there are two possible reasons-- 1) you didn't process the mixture enough-- return the chickpea mixture to the processor to make it more paste-like. 2) the chickpeas you used were old. Try buying a fresher batch of dried chickpeas next time."

      "Chicken/meat preparation: Cut the chicken into large bite size chunks. Boil the chicken in about 6 cups or more of water with one tbsp of salt, as if making chicken soup. You can also add chicken stock cubes if you like once the \"soup\" starts boiling. Do not discard the broth. You want to make sure you have about 5 or 6 cups of broth that will be added to the tamale mixture for additional flavor. Set aside.",

Stir, until much of the water is evaporated from the mixture and it is more creamy in texture rather than watery. Slowly pour in the chile mixture and stir. Cook, stirring the total mixture together, for 15 minutes. This is called aji colorado.",
      "In the meanwhile, take the powdered corn in the large pot that you've set aside and add to it the instant corn masa. Stir the dry mixture together. Then, add the chicken broth that you've saved from boiling the chicken, to the dry mixture. Stir. Add in the majority of the cooked aji colorado and stir. Make sure to save some of the mixture to add together with your cooked chicken-enough to produce a chile coating of the chicken. Set the chicken aside once again.",

The heat will thicken the mixture towards the final product, which is a thick, gooey (not watery) consistency. When the mixture reaches this consistency, let it cool and set aside. When it cools, it will thicken even more into a final paste-like product that we will use to slather on the corn husks.",

Slather on one or two husks some of the corn mixture, add in pieces of the chicken and if desired, one or two pitted olives and one or two sliced pieces of the hard-boiled eggs, and then slather with the corn mixture again. You can either tie the corn husks together with corn husk strips that you tear off yourself or wrap in foil and then tie with string.",

      "Aspargus: For asparagus, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. In a small bowl, combine 1 1/2 tsp oil and 1 1/2 tsp harissa*. Arrange asparagus on a rimmed baking sheet and spread with harissa mixture. Season with salt and pepper. Roast until tender, about 10 minutes. Squeeze juice from lemon over asparagus. Cover to keep warm and set aside. *Harissa, a Tunisian chile paste, is available in cans and jars at Middle Eastern markets and specialty food stores.",
      "Eggs: While asparagus is roasting, for eggs, prepare an ice bath and set aside. In a medium saucepan of boiling water, cook 4 eggs for exactly 6 minutes. Transfer eggs to the ice bath and set aside until cool enough to handle. Peel eggs, then season with salt and pepper. Cover to keep warm and set aside.",
      "Ham Cutlets: For ham cutlet, place flour in a large, shallow bowl. In another large, shallow bowl, whisk 2 eggs, 1 tsp mustard, and 1 tsp hot sauce. In a third large, shallow bowl, combine 1 cup panko bread crumbs, 2 Tbs parsley, 1 Tbs basil, 1 Tbs chives, 1 tsp tarragon, and 3 cloves minced garlic.",
      "In a very large skillet over medium-high heat, warm 2 tablespoons lard. Working one cutlet at a time, dredge in flour mixture, egg mixture, and panko mixture. Add cutlets to skillet and cook, in batches if necessary and using more lard as needed, until golden and crisp, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer cutlets to a plate and cover to keep warm.",
      "To serve, arrange cutlets on plates, and spoon on breakfast sausage vinaigrette. Arrange egg on top and asparagus along side. Garnish with whipped maple."

It is rather thick now.\n\nWith a silicon scraper, pour and scrape the wet mix into the bowl containing the dry ingredients. Mix with a large serving spoon.\n\nExpect to add 1 1/2 cups of liquid (water or milk) to the developing batter before you get a wet enough batter. It has to be thinner than biscuit dough but thicker than pancake batter.",

      "First cut the chicken breast in half, down the side, creating two thinner breast halves. Season both sides with fresh cracked salt and pepper.",

Bread each chicken breast half by first dredging in flour, coating completely and shaking off excess, then dipping in the egg, again coating completely and letting excess run off, and finally coating in bread crumbs. The flour helps the egg stick, and the egg helps the bread crumbs stick. Set each chicken breast half on a drying rack for 5 minutes to set.",
      "Meanwhile, melt the half stick of butter in a large skillet (large enough to fit both breast halves) over medium heat. Crush each garlic clove under a knife, but do not cut them up. Place them in the melted butter and then bruise the basil leaves and also add to the butter. The easiest way to bruise basil is to just roll the basil in between your palms until the oils break from the leaves and become aromatic.",
      "Very lightly simmer the garlic and basil in the butter only for a couple minutes, stirring to infuse the flavors together. I also added a little garlic-infused olive oil that I had at this point. Remove the garlic and basil and increase heat to medium-high.",
      "When the butter begins to shimmer, you know it is hot enough to add your chicken. Add each breast half and fry on each side until golden brown and crispy and the chicken is cooked through, approximately 3-5 minutes per side. This part of the cooking process is going to determine how tender and juicy your chicken is.",
      "My favorite way to determine this is by gently sticking a fork through the thickest part of the breast, making sure not to ruin your breading. When the fork slides through the chicken like butter, turn off the heat. Your chicken is ready.",
      "Lightly season the chicken with your dry Italian herbs, squeeze a little lemon juice over top if you'd like, and plate. Garnish with a simple fresh basil leaf."
