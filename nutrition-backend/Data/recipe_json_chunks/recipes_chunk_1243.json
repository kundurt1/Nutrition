Top with a couple of bite sized pieces of the prepared beef, a couple pieces of chopped green onion, about 1/2 teaspoon of chopped green chile, and about 1/4-1/2 teaspoon of crushed pine cuts. Moisten the tips of your finger and rub around the edge of the won ton wrapper. Bring the edge together and pinch together, sealing firmly and creating a small package. Repeat with the remaining won ton wraps.",
      "When all the wraps are filled bring a 4 inch depth of oil to a high heat in a 4 quart or larger saucepan. Gently drop in the beef bites and fry until crisp and golden, about 1-2 minutes. Remove from oil, drain on paper towels and arrange on platter."

If you don't have a star cutter, you can cut them free hand with a sharp paring knife or break the chocolate into shards once it is set. Store this garnish tightly wrapped in the refrigerator as humidity will cause the popping candy to melt.Alternate garnishes include sparklers, anything red white or blue, flags (edible or non-edible).",

If you don't want to take the time to make the white chocolate whipped cream, whip 3 cups of regular heavy cream with 3 tablespoon of powdered sugar and proceed with the recipe. You can also use whipped topping and fold in fresh blueberries."

      "FOR THE PATE BRISEE: Using a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment (or a handheld mixer), mix together flour, sugar, and salt for 10 - 15 seconds, or until combined. Scatter butter over the top. Mix on low speed for 1 - 1 1/2 minutes, or just until the flour is no longer bright white and holds together when you clump it and lumps of butter the size of pecans are visible throughout.",
      "In a small bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and milk until blended. Add to the flour mixture all at once. Mix on low speed for about 30 seconds, or until the dough just barely comes together. It will look really shaggy and more like a mess than a dough.",
      "Dump the dough out onto an unfloured work surface, then gather it together into a tight mound. Using your palm and starting on one side of the mound, smear the dough bit by bit, starting at the top of the mound and then sliding your palm down the side and along the work surface, until most of the butter chunks are smeared into the dough and the dough comes together. Do this once or twice on each part of the dough, moving through the mound until the whole mess has been smeared into a cohesive dough with streaks of butter. Gather up the dough, wrap tightly in plastic wrap, and press down to flatten into a disk about 1 inch thick. Refrigerate for at least 4 hours before using. The dough will keep in the refrigerator for up to 4 days or in the freezer for up to 1 month. (Makes about 18 oz dough, enough for 8 pop-tarts or one 9-inch double-crust pie.).",
      "FOR THE POP-TARTS: Position a rack in the center of the oven, and heat the oven to 350\u00b0F Remove the dough from the refrigerator and divide it in half. Press each half into a rectangle. On a lightly floured surface, roll out each half into a 14-by-11-inch rectangle. Using a paring knife, lightly score 1 rectangle into eight 3 1/2-by-5 1/2-inch rectangles (about the size of an index card).",
      "Brush the top surface of the entire scored rectangle with the egg. Spoon 2 tablespoons of the jam in a mound in the center of each scored rectangle. Lay the second large dough rectangle directly on top of the first. Using fingertips, carefully press down all around each jam mound, so the pastry sheets adhere to each other.",
      "Using a knife, a pizza roller, or a fluted roller, and following the scored lines, cut the layered dough into 8 rectangles. Place the rectangles, well spaced, on a baking sheet.",
      "Bake for 40 - 45 minutes, or until the tops of the pastries are evenly golden brown. Let cool on the baking sheet on a wire rack for about 30 minutes.",
      "FOR THE GLAZE: While the pastries are cooling, in a small bowl, whisk together confectioners' sugar, vanilla, and enough of the water to make a smooth, pourable glaze. You should have about 1/2 cup. (The glaze can be made ahead and stored in an airtight container at room temp for up to 1 week.).",
      "When the pastries have cooled for 30 minutes, brush the tops evenly with the glaze, then sprinkle with the rainbow sprinkles (if using). Let stand for 10 to 15 minutes to allow the glaze to set before serving. The pastries can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days."
