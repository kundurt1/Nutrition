      "My Note: To make a few changes to make this recipe more of a creamy cheesecake that most people are used to. I used 3 8oz packages of cream cheese instead of 2, added 1/2 cup of sour cream (Fold the sour cream in after adding the eggs), and increased the pumpkin puree to 1 8oz can. I also had to adjust the spices a bit for my taste (added 1 tbls of spiced rum to the pumpkin mixture and a bit more nutmeg and cinnamon). I baked this in a water bath at 350 for 1 hr (till the middle jiggles like jello), then turn off the oven, prop the door open and let the cheesecake sit for another hour, I promise you it will not crack at all. I used a 10in springform pan and a shortbread cookie crust. I used one of the caramel sauce recipes from this web site and poured it over the cheesecake to give it a caramel glaze like the one at the restaurant had. It was fabulous! I took it to work, went to answer the phone, came back 10 minutes later and the whole cheesecake was gone! I couldn't believe it! Now I have to make another one.",
      "UPDATE 02: We always like to find shortcuts in the kitchen and these are the few alterations I've made to this recipe. First, instead of using the pumpkin puree and all the spices -- We simply used a can of pumpkin pie filling -- Libby's or the cheap store brand (which we used). 3/4 cup. Make sure your cream cheese is room tempture. It blends better. We used 1/2 cup + 2 tbs sugar. 1 tsp vanilla. And also 1/2 tsp cinnamon. We carefully layered 1 1/2 cup of the cream cheese mixture on the bottom of the crust. Then added the pumpkin mixture on top carefully. Make sure your crust is not cracked or out dated when you get it from the store. Place on a cookie sheet and bake for 50-55 mins or until center of pie is set (center will spring back when touched)."

Reduce the speed to low, then add the lemon zest, vanilla extract and the tablespoon of poppy seeds, beating to incorporate.",

Working with one quarter at a time, roll out the dough to a thickness of 1/16 inch (or as thin as possible). Use a 3- to 3 1/2-inch cookie cutter to cut out 12 cookies, or a 2 1/2-inch cookie cutter to cut out 18 cookies, transferring them to the baking sheets with an offset spatula. It's best to re-roll the dough only once.",
      "Sprinkle the cut-out cookies lightly with poppy seeds. Bake for 11 to 13 minutes, or until just set but not browned. Let cool on the baking sheet while you roll and cut out the remaining portion of dough, using the same-size cookie cutter to make 12 large or 18 medium cookies. If desired, use a smaller cookie cutter to create a center \"window\" in each of these cookies so the filling will show through. (Bake the mini rounds as well.) Sprinkle the cookies lightly with poppy seeds. Repeat the baking and cooling steps.",
      "At this point, the cookies can be frozen until they are assembled into sandwiches.",
      "Spread the first batch of cookies with a thin layer of homemade or store-bought cranberry jam, leaving a narrow margin at the edges. Top with the cooled cookies from the second batch, pressing together gently to form cookie sandwiches. Store in an airtight container for up to 3 days."

    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "Fish -- A easy way to steam salmon is to individually wrap the fillets in saran wrap and steam right in a colander over a pan of water. No clean up and easy. So, my trick is to set a 10x10 piece of plastic wrap in a small cereal bowl or something similar. Then, set the salmon skin side down on the plastic wrap and top with butter, salt and pepper, 2 orange slices and then 1/4 cup wine. Wrap up the salmon like a little package and you are ready to cook it. Bring a medium pan or pot of water to a boil and set a colander or strainer over the top. This way you will be steaming your fish. As the water comes to a boil, start your sauce.",
      "Sauce -- In a small pot add the butter and melt on medium heat, add the flour and mix to make a roux. Cook another minute until well combined. Add in 3/4 cup of the vegetable broth, garlic and cream and cook on medium (not boiling) until thickened. It will take about 7-10 minutes. Once thickened, add the lemon and orange juice, parsley and check for seasoning and add salt and pepper to taste. Set on low while you finish the fish and spinach. Before I serve the sauce I add the remaining 1/4 cup broth to thin it out just a bit.",
      "Fish Steaming -- Your water is boiling and the salmon is wrapped. As you were making the sauce. Just set your 4 packets on the colander or steamer and cover. You just want the water level so it doesn't come up through the colander or steamer. Cover -- I use an over sized lid or even just a piece of foil. Don't worry if it doesn't fit, it is just meant to keep some of the steam inches The fish will take around 15 minutes.",
      "Spinach -- Sauce is done, fish is cooking. Time to saute your spinach. In a large saute pan, add the olive oil and pancetta and cook 4-5 minutes until golden brown. Add in the onion and cook another couple of minutes. Then add in the spinach and a couple of tablespoons of broth and cook just a few minutes until wilted. I don't like to over cook the spinach.",
      "Plate -- Place a bed of spinach on each plate. Unwrap the steamed / poached salmon and place each piece on the bed of spinach. Don't worry about the wine in the bottom of the packets, that was just to keep the fish moist as it cooked, but it certainly couldn't hurt to add it right over the spinach.",
      "Note: The skin should come right off when you remove from the packets.",
      "Top the salmon with the citrus sauce and enjoy. Serve with some buttered new potatoes.",
      "Plate the spinach, nicely wilted but still not too overdone, top with the salmon, orange slices and some of the wine and butter and then top with the citrus sauce.",

(Many canned or bottled peppers are slit open lengthwise and therefore are not suitable for stuffing.) If whole roasted peppers are not available in your area, or you prefer freshly roasted peppers, roast the red bell peppers, peel and de-seed them before preparing filling. Use our simple step-by-step instructions on How to Roast Peppers over a BBQ grill, or under a broiler. If you wish to make a tapa, use 12-18 roasted small piquillo peppers.",

    "title": "garden fresh salsa",
    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "Individually chop all the peppers, onions, garlic, and cilantro and put them in a large bowl. A food processor comes in real handy here, but you can do it by hand as well. The processor helps, because I like my salsa pretty smooth, but you can make it chunky style too, that just depends on your personal preference.",
      "On peppers:",
      "The bell peppers are necessary as a good base to the salsa but they don't add any heat. Adding the jalapenos as listed above should make your salsa come out a notch or two above the hot stuff you get at the store (still not very hot in my opinion). Adding less or more jalapenos will vary the degree of heat to the salsa. I chop the whole pepper as well (minus the stem) as the heat is stored in the guts of the pepper which a lot of people mistakenly clean out with the seeds. Adding other varieties of hot peppers or sauces will also add flavor and make your salsa unique. Just be careful but remember experimentation is a good thing.",
      "Stir all this in the bowl, and now its time to add the tomatoes. I always use fresh tomatoes (even if I have to pay for the nice ones at the store in winter). You can do 50/50 fresh vs. canned and it will still taste good, but if you do all canned tomatoes it will taste like canned salsa which you might as well just buy at the store. That's really the big secret to great salsa. Fresh tomatoes, fresh peppers and fresh cilantro taste a whole lot better than stuff that's been sitting on the shelf for a few months. Back to the tomatoes though, I peel them and puree them and add them to the mix. Your bowl should be almost half full pre-tomatoes and that's generally the ratio I use. Good salsa is about 50% tomatoes and 50% other good stuff. Stir all this really well, and now it is time to season and taste test. You will want to put in 3-4 tablespoons of salt (this is a big batch after all). I taste test while adding the salt. Not enough and it will taste a little flat, too much and it will be ... too salty. If you go overboard you can add more tomatoes to dilute it (this works with the pepper heat too), but I just add some and taste until its right. Now add some black pepper and Tabasco, or experiment on other hot sauces. I also like to add a couple tablespoons vinegar and juice from one lime to add acidity. Once everything is mixed in and suits your taste, give it a final good blending and place in the refrigerator. It's good for it to set in the cool for a few hours or even overnight as this allows all the flavors to mix together and steep. Just like a good chili, salsa is always better the next day. You should have a mammoth sized bowl of salsa that looks like it will last a month, but trust me, I doubt it makes it to the end of the week. Now its time to stock up on the Tostitos!",
      "Warning: Salsa is proven to be addictive, and once you've had fresh, its hard to go back to that stuff they sell in the grocery store. Seriously though, use caution when you are handling the peppers, especially the hotter varieties, as the heat stays on your fingers, and could irritate your eyes or nose or other sensitive areas that you might inadvertently scratch for the next few hours after you are done in the kitchen."
