Flatten the dough into a disk and wrap the two disks in plastic wrap or waxed paper. Refrigerate for 30 minutes or longer; this resting period allows the flour to absorb the water, making the dough easier to roll out.",
      "When you're \"ready to roll,\" remove the dough from the fridge. Dough made with a combination of butter and shortening should rest for about 5 minutes at room temperature before rolling. If you've made the dough with all vegetable shortening, you'll be able to work with it directly from the refrigerator. A dough made with all butter will need to warm slightly (10 to 15 minutes) before rolling, as butter becomes brittle when it's refrigerated.",

The mixing is held to an absolute minimum, a light stirring from 10-20 seconds, batter will be lumpy. The batter should not be mixed to the point of pouring, ribbon-like from the spoon, but should break into course globs. If the batter has been beaten too long, the gluten in the flour will develop and toughen the dough. Sprinkle muffins with a mixture of sugar and cinnamon prior to baking.",
      "To bake, preheat oven to 400\u00b0F Grease bottoms only of medium size muffin cups, fill 2/3 full. Bake at once in a preheat 400F oven until golden brown, about 15-20 minutes. If muffins remain in tins a few moments after leaving the oven they will be easier to remove."

Remove the pork loin from the ribs and chine bone by cutting between the beat and bones. Rub the marinade all over loin and ribs.

Set the roast rib side down over the drip pan on the side opposite from the heat. Cover with the vent holes over the pork and cook, basting the meat periodically with the MOJO sauce. Rotate the roast 180 degrees after 30 minutes so it cooks evenly. (Add coals to the fire as needed to maintain an even heat.) After an hour, begin to baste with MOJO every 15 minutes and set the roast on its chine (back) bone, with the fat facing the heat, so it browns evenly. Cook until a meat thermometer inserted into the center of the loin registers 140\u00b0F, about 1 1/2 hours in all.",
      "Remove the roast from grill, cut the twine, and let the loin rest for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, place the ribs on the grill over direct heat with the side where the loin was attached facing down. Grill, turning as needed, until evenly browned, about 4 minutes. Let rest 5 minutes and cut between the ribs. Serve ribs with sliced loin and reserved MOJO sauce."

As the mixture thickens, add more milk to the amount of your desire, probably an additional 1/2 cup of milk, maybe even 1 additional cup of milk. Be careful or you will add too much and it will not thicken anymore. Keep stirring as you are simmering on LOW heat until smooth.",

But feel to cook it to whatever temperature you feel comfortable with. 145-150 for tenderloins, but roasts with a bone should be a bit longer. I remove mine at 140-145, cover and let rest for 10 minutes and they always come out perfect. Use a thermometer guys! Important for this type of cooking.",
      "Vinaigrette -- Pork is done. While it rests, make the vinaigrette. Add everything except the olive oil to the blender and pulse a few times until well combined. Then slowly add in the olive oil and blend on low until the dressing becomes creamy and thick.",
      "Serve -- Just slice and drizzle the creamy vinaigrette over the pork. I love to serve the pork over a bed of rice on a large serving platter family style and the vinaigrette over the top. Serve some black beans, roasted veggies and my olive salad, for a great family style dinner. ENJOY this unique and great pork tenderloin!"

Pour the chicken stock over.

If it looks like it's going to turn black, take the pan off the heat for a while to cool it down. Continue melting the sugar until a thick caramel is formed.",
      "Tip all the sliced apples into the pan at once - be careful, the pot might spit at you when the moisture of the apples hits the caramel, and spitting caramel is very painful. Stir to combine the apple and caramel as well as you can - the caramel will stick to the bottom of the pan and your stirring spatula quite a lot, but don't worry about it. If your spatula gets too caramel-clogged, scrape it off gently with the back of a knife and plop the caramel lump back into the pot. It will melt as the apple cooks down and exudes more moisture.",
      "Lower the heat to low, just high enough so that the pan is barely simmering. Put a lid on, and let it cook, stirring occasionally, for about 30 to 40 minutes, until the apple slices are permeated with caramel color, as in the photo above. At this point add the optional butter and stir it in, though it's fine to leave it out if you wish.",
      "Let cool thoroughly before packing into jars or plastic containers. Since this doesn't have the large amount of sugar that jams or preserves do, it needs to be stored in the refrigerator, where it will keep for a couple of weeks, or the freezer, where it should keep for a month or more.",
      "Eat hot or cold. It's really nice on pancakes, with or without butter, as well as on oatmeal, yogurt, ice cream, or on its own. In the manga they lightly toast some bread, pile the apple on top with a pat of butter, and toast it again in a toaster oven."

The latter by itself doesn't taste of much; a slightly sweet, vegetably taste, nothing like what its violent colour suggests. Overall, it flavours the martini in a way reminiscent of a dirty martini (martini with olive brine added). So you'll only like it if you like dirty martinis, probably a pretty small constituency."

    "title": "how to make awesome deviled eggs",
    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "To boil an egg correctly place your eggs in a pot. Make sure there is room for the eggs to move around as they boil so they don't crack. Fill with water so the water is an inch or more over the eggs. Bring to a boil. Allow eggs to boil only for 2 to 3 minutes. Turn the heat off, put a lid on the pot and move the pot off of the hot burner. Allow eggs to sit in the hot water for about 15 minutes. The hot water will continue to cook the eggs and you will have lovely mustard yellow yolks. After fifteen minutes rinse with cold water and peel.",
      "FYI if your shell sticks to the egg membrane your eggs are too fresh. This is not caused from over cooking your eggs. Buy your eggs a few days in advance of hard boiling them.",
      "Cut your hard boiled eggs in half with a sharp knife. Put the whites on a plate or in a deviled eggs dish. Put the yolks in the bowl of a food processor. Once you've got all the yolks in the processor pulse the yolks for about a minute. Add the rest of the ingredients into the food processor bowl and turn it on low and let it mix for about 1 1/2 minutes. Scrap down the bowl and pulse it a couple more times.",
      "That's it! Your filling is done and there shouldn't be any lumps of egg yolk. You can slide the bowl of a spoon across the top of the filling to check for lumps. Believe me you will see them if they are there. If there are lumps run your processor for another minute.",
      "Filling your egg whites can be done simply by spooning the filling in with a teaspoon or you can get fancy like I did today and put all the filling in a piping bag with a star tip. It's a little more work to use the piping bag but the deviled eggs look so pretty when they are filled this way. When I want to get fancy I use the bag and tip otherwise I will just use a spoon. My husband inhales them so quickly I usually just use the bag for the holidays.",
      "You can sprinkle some paprika on top to make them look prettier. My husband is picky about his deviled eggs and he doesn't like the paprika so I never use it.",
      "Enjoy!",
      "Thanks for stopping by!"

I scoop them out with a spoon, roll them in my hands, and bake on a cake rack in the oven over a foil-lined cookie sheet. This way, they brown nicely, excess fat is drained off, and they can go right into sauce, or, in our family, meatball hoagies, along with sauteed onions and peppers. They also freeze very well when baked this way.",
      "funny! 3 meats, the breadcrumbs, plus 1 egg. You can also use fresh chopped spinach instead of parsley (or 1 pkg frozen, thawed and all water squeezed out) and pecorino romano cheese instead of parmesan. I make sure I have these on hand almost all the time, I use one lb of EACH meat, and it makes 30-40. Instead of frying, I par bake mine on a cookie sheet at 325 for about 10 minutes, then set the tray (if room allows) into the freezer for an hour or so. Pop them off the tray, into a couple of large freezer bags. Meatballs on demand! Drop them into a sauce or steam in a glass casserole dish for about 5 minutes, they will be medium-well on the inside. Absolute crowd pleaser if you are making a big Italian dinner!",
