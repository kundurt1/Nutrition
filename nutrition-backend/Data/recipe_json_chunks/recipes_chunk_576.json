Sprinkle work surface with sesame seeds, covering area about 1 foot square. Turn dough onto prepared surface. Sprinkle top with sesame seeds and pat out into rough square about 9-inches on each side and 1/2-inch thick. Add seeds as necessary to keep fingers from sticking. Using sharp knife dipped in flour, cut dough into squares. Transfer squares to generously buttered baking sheet, placing squares at least 2-inches apart. Bake at 450\u00b0 for 20 minutes or until well browned. Cool squares on wire racks if biscuits won't be eaten right away. Makes 16 biscuits."
