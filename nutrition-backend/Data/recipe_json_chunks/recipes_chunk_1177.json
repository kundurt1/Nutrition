I sometimes reduce the dried red chili to one and add 1 teaspoons coarsely ground black pepper--more of a style from the state of Kerala; C.) Make it a mixed vegetable curry adding to the potatoes 1 finely minced carrot, 2 cups fresh green beans, and using the peas; D.) Another mixed vegetable curry would reduce the potatoes to two, add the carrot, green beans, about six largish cauliflower florets, and the peas. I don't like to add peas too early to any recipe, as they become over cooked. Turn off the heat and stir in frozen peas at the end, and the heat will defrost the peas in just a few minutes."

      "In the bottom of a small saucepan, off the heat, beat or whisk your egg yolks and 1/4 cup sugar together vigorously, until it pales in color and a ribbon of batter falls off your whisk when you lift it from the bowl; this will take a few minutes by hand, and likely just one minute with an electric mixer. Whisk in the flour until fully incorporated.",
      "Whisking the whole time, drizzle the warm vanilla-milk mixture into the egg yolk mixture, just a tiny bit at a time at first. Once you've added about 1/4 of the milk, you can add the rest in a thin stream, whisking constantly.",
      "Bring the saucepan to your stove and heat it over medium-high heat, whisking constantly, until it begins to bubble. Once bubbling, whisk it for 1 to 2 more minutes, then remove it from the heat. Immediately stir in vanilla extract (if using) and butter until combined. [Updated to add] As a final step for a perfectly smooth and silky custard, you can press the mixture through a fine-mesh strainer. You can also skip this step if you're not terribly concerned about an imperfect custard.",
      "To cool your custard quickly, place the saucepan in a larger bowl of ice water that will go halfway up the sides of the saucepan (i.e. water should not spill in) and stir the custard until lukewarm, then divide among serving dishes or ramekins. You can also pour it into serving dishes or ramekins still hot, but you should then press a film of plastic wrap against each custard in the fridge so it doesn't form a pudding skin. Custards keep in fridge for up to 4 days.",
      "To serve: Preheat oven to 450\u00b0F. Place blueberries in a heatproof, shallow roasting dish and sprinkle with 1 1/2 teaspoons sugar. Roast in oven for 12 to 15 minutes, rolling around once or twice during cooking time to ensure they roast evenly. The goal is not to let the blueberries fully slump or turn to sauce; you just want a little trickle of juices puddled across in the bottom. Squeeze a bit of lemon juice over berries the second they come out of the oven and roll them back and forth to evenly incorporate it. Spoon hot roasted blueberries and some of their juices over each custard. Eat immediately, passing any extra roasted blueberries alongside."

      "First, prepare all the meats for the stew. Combine beef tongue and tripe in a kettle; add water to cover. Simmer for about 30 minutes, then lift out tripe. Let it cool slightly and cut into strips. Continue to cook tongue for another 30 to 40 minutes. Drain tongue and let it cool slightly, then pull off skin. Cut of fat and gristly portions and cut tongue into 1 1/2 inch cubes.",
      "Meanwhile, soak kidney in salted water for about 1 hour, then cut into cubes, cutting out all white veins and fat. Cut beef heart and liver into 1-inch cubes. Parboil brains and sweetbreads in lightly salted water for about 15 minutes. Drain them and cut brains into 1-inch cubes. Remove membrane from sweetbreads and cut or break into pieces.",
      "Dice the salt pork. In a large heavy Dutch oven or kettle fry it until crisp and brown. Peel and slice onions and add to salt pork. Cook until brown. Add all pieces of meat except brains and sweetbreads. Cook meat in browned onions, turning and stirring frequently, for about 10 to 15 minutes. Add hot water, salt, pepper, and Worcestershire sauce. Crush marjoram and thyme and stir into stew. Cover and simmer for about 2 to 2 1/2 hours, or until meats are tender. Add brains and sweetbreads and continue simmering another 30 minutes or so. If desired for thickening, blend flour with cold water and stir into stew. When stew simmers again and is thickened, it is ready to serve. (You may not want to thicken the stew). Serve with whatever you wish-steamed rice, mashed potatoes, buttered noodles-or lots of crusty homemade bread. Make 8 to 10 servings.",
      "NOTE: Some versions, notably from Texas, are thickened by sprinkling in a little cornmeal and served with corn bread.",

Add the butter, and again, pulse the ingredients 5 or 6 times, and then for 3-5 seconds, until there are small lumps of butter throughout the flour, about the size of peas.",
      "Through the feed-tube, with the machine running, quickly add 1/3 cup (a little more than 5 tablespoons) ice water. After about 20-30 seconds, the dough should come together and form a ball on top of the blade. If not, add a tablespoon of water. Do not over-process to ensure a flaky crust.",
      "Put the dough, and any little scraps on the bottom into a bowl together - pressing into two balls. Press each ball into a disc, about 1/3 to 1/2-inch thick. At this point, you can put the disc on a plate, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or up to 2 days. The dough, wrapped well, also freezes well for 30-45 days (defrost in the refrigerator overnight before using).",
      "When ready to use, dust each side of the dough with a little flour, then roll the dough on a lightly floured surface to a circle about 1/8-inch thick. Rotating the disc, as you roll to maintain an even circle.",
      "Transfer the dough to a deep-dish 9-inch or 10-inch pie plate. Press the dough lightly into place along bottom and sides. Using a knife, trim the dough, leaving a 1-inch overlap*. Fold the dough in half to create a double thickness along the rim of the pie plate. Push lightly along the outer edge, leaving room for the dough to shrink on the rim during baking. Pinch the dough along the rim to create a decorative edge. Because this is an all-butter crust, it must be very cold going into the oven. Refrigerate the prepared shell for 30-60 minutes, or overnight lightly covered with plastic wrap.",
      "If a recipe calls for a baked pie crust (blind bake), simply \"dock\" the crust, which means, using a fork, prick the crust along the bottom and sides, or use pie weights. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. Bake the crust at 425 degrees 15 to 18 minutes or until the sides begin to brown. (The initial high heat will force much of the steam out, helping the crust become flaky.) Remove the pan from the oven. Gently remove your pie weights. Reduce oven to 375 degrees and continue to bake the crust for several minutes until it's golden. Without the weight of a filling, a baking crust can shrink, fill with air pockets, and puff up with bubbles, so it is important to either dock the crust or weigh the crust down as it bakes. Weights are easier and you won't risk the filling leaking through the holes. This is done by lining the dough with parchment paper or foil (if you use foil, you may need to grease the dough first, to prevent the foil from sticking) and filling it with pie weights or a pie chain (or dried beans, pennies, rice, marbles, etc.) to hold its shape during baking."
