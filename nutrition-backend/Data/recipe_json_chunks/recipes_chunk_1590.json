Strain all drippings from the turkey pan through a fine mesh sieve into a large measuring cup. Discard anything you catch in the sieve. Let drippings in the measuring cup rest for a minute. The fat will float to the top and broth will sink to the bottom.",

Set saucepan over medium heat. Once oil is starting to sizzle, whisk in the flour and stir until well combined. Continue whisking until mixture is starting to turn a light golden brown.",
      "3. Gradually pour the skimmed turkey drippings/broth into your saucepan, whisking constantly. You should have about 2 cups of drippings left in the measuring cup after fat is removed. Add more water or broth if needed to make 2 cups (I had to add 1/3 cup water). Bring to a light boil, whisking constantly.",
      "4. Add the milk for a creamier gravy and continue to simmer for 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste if needed (mine was plenty flavorful without it). Remove from heat, cover with lid and keep warm until ready to serve, then transfer gravy to a gravy boat. It will thicken slightly as it cools. Pour over sliced turkey and mashed potatoes. It's truly wonderful."

      "First, blanch the broccoli. Fill a large pot a little over halfway with water and bring it to a boil on the stove. Salt it generously. Set up a bowl of ice water as well. Boil the broccoli head for just about a minute, then remove it right into the ice bath to stop the cooking. Cut the broccoli into manageable pieces, then transfer it to the bowl of a food processor. Also add the onion, garlic, dill and parsley. Pulse the mixture until it is a fine texture, then scoop it into a large mixing bowl. Add the egg, corn meal, cheddar, salt and Sriracha. Mix it all together thoroughly. Put the bowl in the fridge to chill the mixture for 15 minutes.",
      "While it chills, preheat the oven to 400\u00b0F and line a sheet tray with a silicone mat. Take a small amount of the chilled broccoli mixture about the size of your palm and form it into the classic tot shape. Place it on the sheet tray with one of the flat sides down. Repeat until the mixture is used up and you have about 36 tots. Bake them for 9 minutes, then take them out and turn them over onto the other flat side. Put them back in for another 9 minutes to get them completely cooked through and golden. Let them cool a minute, then serve them with your favorite main course!"

In place of rolling them in sugar, they can be rolled in white nonpareil candy sprinkles.",
      "For the bunny bottoms:",
      "Using kitchen scissors for food, cut the large marshmallows in half crosswise. Lay them on a plate sticky side up, and set aside for a moment while making the bunny feet. Just 1 half is needed for each cup.",
      "For the bunny feet:",
      "On a plate, lay a piece of parchment or wax paper. Melt white candy melts according to the package instructions. In one corner of a snack-size zipper plastic bag, spoon in the melted candy. In the corner of the bag where the candy is, snip a very small hole. Pipe the melted candy from the bag on to the parchment/wax paper to form the bunny feet. Use the flat side of a toothpick to spread the top of the candy feet as flat as possible because after these are cooled they'll be turned over; the smooth bottom will be where the bunny pads and toes are added. So the flatter that the feet lay when turned over, the better for piping on the pink pads and toes. Chill in the refrigerator for about 10 minutes or until they're set.",
      "When the bunny feet are set, turn them over smooth-side up (this is where the bunny pads and toes will be added). Melt the pink candy melts according to the package instructions. Spoon the pink candy in a snack-size plastic bag just like it was done for the white candy melts. Only this time, make an ultra super tiny snip in the corner where the pink candy is. Pipe the melted pink candy on to the white candy feet to form the pads (try not to hold on to the white part of the feet because the candy melts super quick when touched). To make the toes, an option is to use a toothpick (dipped in the melted pink candy) rather than piping the candy from the bag. Chill the feet in the refrigerator for about 5 minutes or until the pink pads and toes are set.",
      "For assembly of the bunny bottom, tail and feet:",
      "Lay a piece of parchment/wax paper on a plate. Lay the bunny bottom marshmallow sticky-side down on the parchment/wax paper. Using a toothpick, dab melted white candy on to the top side of the large marshmallow and lay the tail on top of it. Under the tail, dab melted white candy where the left foot will go and lay a candy foot on top of it. Then dab melted white candy where the right foot will go and lay the other candy foot on top of it. It's best to add melted candy for one foot at a time so that the melted candy doesn't start to set. With the remaining cookie crumbs, make a small \"mound\" in the middle of the dirt. Lay a bunny bottom in the mound. Add candy grass, jelly beans, and/or candy sprinkles in the dirt just outside of the \"mound\" where the bunny is. Repeat with remaining desserts.",
      "Cover and store in the refrigerator. These are best served right away."

      "To form the roll shape, turn the sponge out onto a piece of baking parchment, and make a dent along the width of the sponge, 1cm in from one of the longest edges. From this same end, roll up the sponge into a long thin sausage shape with the paper in the middle, and twist the overlapping ends of the baking parchment like a sweet and leave it to cool on a wire rack. I also covered mine with foil to hold the shape firmly.",
      "For the chocolate butter filling:",
      "Beat the butter and icing sugar together until light and fluffy and then beat in the melted chocolate. Unroll the sponge from its wrappings, spread over the butter icing and roll up again, using the paper to support the sponge and protect from breakage. Cover with foil again and set to one side whilst you make the chocolate ganache frosting.",
      "For the chocolate ganache frosting:",
      "Place chocolate in a large heatproof bowl. Bring the double cream and the corn syrup to a simmer over medium-high heat in a nonstick saucepan on the hob; pour the sugar and cream mixture over chocolate and leave it to stand, without stirring, until chocolate begins to melt.",
      "Stir the melted chocolate into cream until mixture is combined and smooth, stop as soon as you achieve a glossy, well mixed finish.",
      "Refrigerate the mixture in a Tupperware container, until the frosting begins to thicken and becomes lighter in colour. Remove the chocolate Swiss roll from its foil and cover the entire thing with a 1cm thick layer of chocolate frosting. Sprinkle with a little icing sugar and some edible glitter.",
      "Tips:",
      "This entire recipe would work incredibly well as a white chocolate version. Add a little vanilla essence to the sponge mix and substitute the chocolate cocoa for white chocolate powder or Ovaltine in the sponge mix. Substitute the chopped hard chocolate in the chocolate cream and frosting for white chocolate. To finish, omit the icing powder sprinkles and instead, use a little vanilla sugar and some cute pink edible glitter for some Barbie-inspired glam!",
      "On either version, use a packet of licorice allsorts to turn this cake into a hungry crocodile birthday cake. Cut the square allsorts in half diagonally and use to make teeth 1/3 of the way along the cake and halfway down as teeth. Use the licorice roll shapes as feet on either side, top and bottom. Use the pink and blue bobble-covered allsorts as eyes. This snappy sweet crocodile cake will bring toothy grins from children and adults alike!"

      "Place the semisweet chocolate chips in a heatproof bowl and set aside. In a double boiler heat the milk and butter over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until it begins to simmer. Turn off the heat and pour the milk over the chocolate chips and allow to sit for a few minutes to melt the chocolate, then whisk until all the chocolate is melted and you have a smooth and shiny liquid chocolate.",
      "Alternate adding half of the dry mixture and half of the melted chocolate to the contents of the stand mixer bowl until everything is combined. Do not overmix! The dough should be fairly thick with a slightly sticky texture. (If you overmix after adding the dry ingredients, you will develop the gluten in the flour and make a cookie with a tough consistency. Mix on low just until the flour disappears into the dough. Do not be tempted to add more flour if the dough looks runnier than you think it should be, this will dry out the cookie. Even if the dough seems really soft, it will firm up in the fridge.)",
      "Gently mix in the three different kinds of chocolate chips and distribute them evenly through the dough.",
      "Turn the dough out onto a large piece of plastic wrap. Wrap the dough up tight and allow it to rest in the refrigerator for a minimum of 2 hours. It can be kept in the fridge for a couple of days before it needs to be baked or frozen. Do not skip this step!",
      "Once the dough is completely chilled and firm, remove the plastic wrap and roll into tablespoon-sized balls. Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F. Place the cookie dough balls on a Silpat-lined cookie sheet (I can usually fit about 18 to a tray) and bake for 10 to 11 minutes.",
      "Remove them from the oven when the top of the dough starts to crack. Let them rest on the cookie sheet outside the oven for 1 minute before placing them on a cooling rack. Allow to cool for 5 minutes before eating. Best served warm, fresh out of the oven. Store any leftover cookies in an airtight Ziploc bag for up to a week. When they are fresh out of the oven they have a soft and fudgy texture. Once they are fully cooled overnight, they have a lighter, cake-like but slightly chewy texture.",
      "You can also place the unbaked cookie dough balls in a plastic bag and freezer them for baking at a later date. You can bake straight from frozen using the same baking instructions above but you may have to add a few minutes to the baking time.",
      "This recipe makes about 60 to 70 cookies depending on how large you roll them. My test batch made 72 tablespoon size dough balls."

Add celery (finely chopped) and carrots. Add garlic (I use the jar minced kind - or you can mince your own) and stir well. Sprinkle veggies with flour and cook for about 3 minutes. Add tomato paste, beef stock, and wine. Stir well. Place 3 whole springs of rosemary in mix. Add the cooked beef and all the juices back to the pot and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to a simmer, partially cover pot (I just turn my lid a little crooked) and cook for a half hour stirring occasionally. Then add potatoes to the stew and simmer for an hour or so longer, until potatoes are very tender. Be sure to stir fairly often, scraping edges and bottom of the pot. Give stew a good stir and remove from heat. Remove rosemary stems and serve hot. Makes excellent leftovers and freezes well.",
      "Some people like to serve their stew over rice or noodles, if that is your preference, enjoy!"

      "In a large heat-safe bowl, whisk the eggs yolks until they are light in color. Slowly add in the sugar and whisk to combine. At this point, the mixture should be on the thicker side.

While the hook is still going, slowly add flour. It will become a crumbly dough. Add olive oil, then turn off the mixer. If it is still too dry, add a bit of warm water. Bring it together into a ball and knead it in the bowl for 2-3 minutes. Lightly grease the bowl with more olive oil and cover it with a damp towel. Set it aside to rise for 1 hour.",

Line them up nicely and brush them all with the beaten egg. Sprinkle all of the pieces with a little extra Asiago on top and a generous sprinkle of salt.",
      "Bake the pretzel bites for 15-18 minutes, until they become completely golden on top and baked through. Serve them immediately warm with either ketchup or warmed up marinara sauce! Enjoy!"

      "Heat a large soup pot to medium heat with olive oil. Add onions and bell pepper and cook for 3 minutes to soften slightly. Add garlic, tomato paste, and chili paste, and stir to combine. Cook for 2 minutes more, then sprinkle with flour. Stir flour into mixture for 2 minutes, then add drained hominy and chicken broth. Bring to a boil (increase heat if you need to), and let posole thicken and reduce slightly.",
      "Taste, and add salt, hot sauce, or more chili paste to your preference (this will depend on salt content and spice of stock and chili paste). When posole tastes perfect, let simmer for 10-20 minutes more. Prepare any toppings you'd like to use, and serve!",
      "Notes:",
      "1. I have a Mexican neighbor who makes her own chili paste, and I have a jar of it in my fridge that is pretty much the best thing ever. If you don't have a Mexican neighbor and can't find chili paste in the store, do the following: remove stems and seeds from 2 dried ancho chilis. Pour 1 cup boiling water over them and let sit for 20 minutes to soften. When peppers are soft, fish out of the water (reserve water) and add to a blender with 1 clove of garlic and 1 teaspoon apple cider vinegar and a pinch of salt. Blend until smooth, and add 1 tablespoon chili water at a time to thin mixture if needed. Use in posole, starting with 1 tablespoon and adding more as you prefer for spice level.",
      "2. Make-ahead: You can make this up to 4 days in advance. Store covered in soup pot in the fridge, or earlier in the day and leave it (stove off) on the stovetop. Reheat by turning stove to medium-low, and add a bit more stock or water if posole has thickened too much."

Cover with a clean kitchen towel and allow to rise for 1-2 hours in a warm draft-free place (such as the inside of a turned-off oven).

      "Transfer to a parchment-lined baking sheet and place in the freezer for 10 minutes to firm up. Remove from freezer, place on a lightly floured surface and slice in half length-wise. With the cut sides up, make an 'X' using the two halves. On one side, working from the center outwards, cross the pieces once over each other and once again, as if braiding. Repeat on opposite side.

Bake on the center rack of the oven for a total of 40-50 minutes. After 20-30 minutes or when golden brown, tent with foil to avoid overbrowning. The bread is done when a tester inserted into the center comes out clean. An instant read thermometer will read between 185-200\u00b0F. The bread will also sound hollow after unmolding when you tap the bottom.",

I like the Fiasconaro brand from Amazon, although it is a bit pricey. The brand shown in my photo is from Eataly in NYC. There are also recipes for homemade pistachio paste, which might be good to try.",
      "2. For a more ideal proofing environment, I actually turned on my oven until it reached about 90-100\u00b0F, according to an oven thermometer. Then I turned off the oven and place the dough inside to proof.",
      "3. If you have leftover simple syrup, filter it through a mesh sieve, place it in a small jar and refrigerate for other uses. It canned be used to sweeten chilled beverages, such as cocktails or iced coffee.",

      "Please see Notes below.",
      "1. Heat about 3/4 cup + 2 tablespoons heavy or whipping cream (200 ml) in a heavy saucepan until almost boiling, stirring all the while as to prevent it from catching. Pour into a 1 quart or 1 liter measuring jug or heat-proof bowl.",
      "2. Add roughly 7 oz Nutella (about 200 grams) into the hot cream, and stir well to dissolve. If all Nutella is not dissolved, you can pour the mixture back into the saucepan and heat it gently until you get a velvety smooth emulsion.",
      "3. Set a mesh strainer on top of the measuring jug or bowl that contains the creamy Nutella mixture. Quickly wash out the saucepan with hot water and pat it dry with a kitchen towel, we're going to prepare the custard in it next.",
      "4. Start the custard by separating the egg yolks from the whites. Most easily done when the eggs are fridge cold by cracking them open into the palm of your hand and letting the whites slip through your fingers into the kitchen sink, or whatever container on hand if you wish to preserve them, and transferring the white-free yolks into a small bowl. Whisk briskly to break their structure and incorporate some air into them. You can freeze the egg whites and make meringue later, for example.",
      "5. Heat 1 cup milk (about 250 ml) in the same saucepan, stirring constantly with a whisk or a spatula so it won't catch. When the milk is steaming hot, temper the egg yolks. This can be quite an operation if you've never done it before. Slowly drizzle some of the hot milk into the egg yolks while whisking the mixture like a madman so they won't cook. Keep doing this, slowly drizzling the milk into the yolks and stirring at breakneck speed, until all milk is used, and pour back into the saucepan.",
      "6. Slowly heat the egg yolk and milk mixture over a gentle heat (or a not-so-gentle heat if you're familiar with the process), constantly stirring with a whisk or a spatula and scraping the bottom of the pan. After a few minutes the custard will thicken noticeably. When this happens, immediately remove from heat and keep stirring. Do not let it boil or you will end up with scrambled eggs! This custard contains no sugar, so it will thicken quite fast.",
      "7. To remove any bits of cooked egg yolk, pour the hot custard through the mesh strainer into the bowl or jug containing the Nutella mixture. Discard egg solids. Stir well to combine the Nutella cream and the custard until you get a homogeneous mixture, and place some cling wrap directly on top of the surface of the mixture to prevent a skin from forming, and cool in an ice bath until cool enough to transfer to the fridge. Cool thoroughly (at least 4 hours, though I have been a bit impatient myself...), and freeze in your ice cream maker according to the manufacturer's instructions.",
      "You can serve it straight from the ice cream maker if you prefer, but I found it was too soft and melts quickly so I transferred the ice cream into the freezer and let it ripen for several hours. If it gets too hard to scoop out, let it sit a few minutes in room temperature first.",
      "NOTES -",
      "You may add more Nutella than the recipe calls for after you've tasted the Nutella and cream mixture. Or, indeed, you may want to use less if you don't have a particularly sweet tooth, in which case proceed with caution when adding the Nutella.",
      "Makes about 4/5 quarts or 800 ml ice cream, depending on how much air your ice cream maker incorporates in the mixing process. I have no idea how many servings that is, I could probably eat it all in one sitting but then again not everyone has a death wish. All I know is that the resulting ice cream is very, very rich. Sinfully, decadently rich. Enjoy!",
