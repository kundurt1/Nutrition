      "Preheat a large sheet tray in the center rack of the oven at 450\u00b0F. Add potatoes to a large pot of salted water and bring to a boil. Parboil potatoes for 5 minutes or until outsides start to soften. Drain well.",

      "Roast a total of 25-30 minutes, flipping half way through. Toss with lemon zest while hot. Enjoy.",
      "Why these techniques are important for crispy, well-seasoned potatoes:",
      "1. Parboiling the potatoes in salted water not only helps season their interiors, but the softened exteriors are more susceptible to attaining crispy edges. Starch is also released in the water, allowing for easier crisping.",
      "2. Flour helps to dry out the exterior (also leads to easier crisping).",
      "3. Preheating the sheet tray ensures ultimate browning and helps prevent the potatoes from sticking!",
      "Note: Truffle salt can be found in gourmet grocery stores or online."

      "First, you're going to cut the dark green part off of the leek, then cut off the root. You'll be left with just the white part and a little bit of the lighter green part. Don't worry about cutting all the green off, it's OK to have some light green. Then, cut the leeks in half lengthwise and rinse them well. Cut them in half again, down the middle, and chop them. Chop them just like you would celery! Your pieces will be pretty small; just use my photo in the related link as a guideline!",
      "Now that your leeks are ready, get a large pot and melt butter in it over medium heat. Once the butter has melted, add the leeks and salt and cook them for 5 minutes, stirring constantly. In the last thirty seconds, add the minced garlic. Lower the heat to medium low and cook the leeks for 25 minutes. Stir occasionally. This will get them nice and soft.",
      "While the leeks are cooking, peel and finely dice the potatoes. When the leeks are finished, add the potatoes and chicken broth to the pot. Bring this mixture to a boil over medium high heat. Then reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for about 25 minutes, or longer if your potatoes are not tender.",
      "While the soup is cooking, measure out the half-and-half. Take out a tablespoon of the half-and-half and add the lemon juice into the larger portion of half-and-half. Let this sit for at least 10 minutes.",
      "When the potatoes are tender, remove from heat and puree the mixture using an immersion blender, or transfer the mixture to your stand blender or Vitamix (when blending hot ingredients, make sure to not fill your blender canister too full, to allow room for expansion). Once the mixture is smooth, add the heavy cream and the half-and-half and lemon mixture. The half-and-half with lemon juice will have curdled. That's OK, because you're now going to blend again until incorporated.",
      "Taste and re-season if necessary, however, keep in mind that if you're using truffle oil, you may need less salt! I would suggest testing a bowl with the truffle oil and then adding more salt if you would like it saltier! I like salt, but with the truffle oil, I thought it had plenty of flavor! Serve immediately, garnished with a drizzle of truffle oil and fresh chives!"

While that happens whisk the egg yolks together in a bowl. Then in a separate bowl stir the other 1/4 cup of milk thoroughly with the corn starch. Scoop a 1/2 cup of the hot milk into the bowl with the egg yolks and whisk them together to temper the eggs. Then whisk that mixture back into the pot with the rest of the milk, letting it cook for just 15-20 seconds. Continue to whisk while you pour in the cornstarch mixture. Let the pudding bubble and thicken for a minute while you keep whisking, then finally whisk in the banana extract and butter until it is smooth. Transfer the pudding to a bowl and place plastic wrap directly on it to keep it from developing a skin. Set it in the refrigerator to chill for at least 2 hours.",
      "Make the cupcakes while the pudding chills. Take two cupcake trays and line 16 of the wells with paper liners. Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F and set up a stand mixer with the paddle attachment. Whisk the flour, baking powder, cinnamon and salt together in a bowl to aerate the dry ingredients and then set them aside. Combine the butter and sugar in the stand mixer bowl and beat them together until fluffy. Add in each egg one at a time, followed by the two extracts. Turn the speed to low and slowly add in the dry ingredients until you have a sticky, thick batter. Evenly distribute the batter among the 16 wells, filling them just about 3/4 of the way. Bake the cupcakes for about 20 minutes, until golden and crackly around the edges. Let them cool completely.",
      "Make the frosting while the cupcakes bake and cool. Wash out the stand mixer bowl and paddle attachment first. Then combine the cream cheese and butter in the bowl and beat them together thoroughly. Add in the cinnamon and banana extract next. Then turn the speed to low and slowly add in the powdered sugar. Cover the bowl and refrigerate the frosting until you are ready to assemble the cupcakes. When you are ready to assemble the cupcakes, mash the banana for the pudding first. Fold it into the rest of the pudding to make it thicker and more flavorful.",
      "Use a 1-inch circle cutter to cut out a hole in the center of each cupcake, being careful to not go all of the way to the bottom. Spoon the pudding into the holes generously to fill the cupcakes. Scoop the frosting into a piping bag fitted with a star tip and frost each cupcake. Then take 8 of the vanilla wafers and put them into a resealable bag. Crush them into crumbs with a rolling pin, then sprinkle each of the cupcakes generously with the crumbs. Finish by sticking a whole vanilla wafer on top. There will be leftover crumbs and pudding that can be made into great dessert later! Store the cupcakes in a sealed container in the refrigerator until you are ready to serve them. Enjoy!"

      "Once it is chilled, set up a sheet tray and line it with a silicone mat. Use a 1 1/2-inch cookie scoop to scoop out perfect portions of the ganache and roll them into balls. Line them up on the sheet tray as you make them. Then put the tray back into the freezer for another hour to chill them completely again. When they are done chilling again, set up a second sheet tray with another silicone mat. Break up the remaining three chocolate bars into small piece and get them into a large, microwave safe bowl.",
      "Microwave the chocolate for 1 to 2 minutes, checking it and stirring it until it is completely melted and smooth. Coat the ganache centers in the chocolate, fishing them out with a fork to let the excess drip back in. Nudge them off the fork with a toothpick onto the second sheet tray. About halfway through you may need to microwave the chocolate to make it melty again for about 30 seconds. Top all of the truffles with a generous sprinkle of the crushed peppermint candy while the coating is still soft so that it will stick. Store the tray in the freezer to set the chocolate for an hour, then keep them in a sealed container in the refrigerator until you are ready to serve them!"

Combine the butter and brown sugar in its bowl and beat them together until it is a fluffy mixture. Add in the ginger, cinnamon, mace and nutmeg, followed by the two eggs. Then pour in the yeast mixture and the other cup of warm water. Finally, slowly add in the flour until you have a soft dough. Bring the dough together into a ball with your clean hands in the bowl, then cover it and set it aside in a warm, dry area. Let it rise for 3 hours.",
      "While the dough sits, make the glaze and prepare the baking pans. Stir the soft butter, brown sugar, maple syrup, and water together thoroughly. The butter will be broken up but not melted in and that's great. Take four 9 inch cake pans and spray them all well with cooking spray. Divide the glaze evenly among them, making sure it is an even layer across the whole bottom. Sprinkle half a cup of the chopped pecans into an even layer in each pan and press them lightly into the glaze. Set the pans aside.",
      "When the dough is done rising, gently punch it down and divide it in half. Turn the first half out onto a clean, well floured surface and roll it out to be a thin rectangle about 10 inches long. Stir the brown sugar, ginger, cinnamon, mace and nutmeg together thoroughly for the filling. Brush the dough with half of the melted butter and sprinkle half of the filling all over it evenly. Roll it up tightly to make it a long log with the long side coming toward you. Cut the log in half, then cut each half in half. Then cut each half into three equal pieces to get 12 sticky buns total. Put 6 rolls into each pan to fill two of them, pressing them down gently into the glaze.",
      "Repeat this process with the other half of dough to get 24 sticky buns total. Let them sit for an hour to rise again. When the hour is up, heat the oven to 350\u00b0F. Bake the sticky buns for 30-35 minutes with two pans on each rack. Take them out and let them cool for 5 minutes. Turn each pan out onto a large plate or small platter and serve them warm immediately! At this point you can also separate the sticky buns and place them all into 2 large baking dishes with fitted lids that don't touch the topping. Refrigerate them and then warm them up the next morning at 350\u00b0F for 5-7 minutes so that you can make them ahead!"

      "For the crust, combine flour, sugar, and salt in a food processor (or bowl, if that is what you have to work with). Add butter and pulse to combine until resembles coarse crumbs, about 10 to 15 seconds (if using bowl, cut the butter in with a pastry blender). Add ice water in a steady stream, starting with just 1/4 cup. Process just until the dough pinches together. If necessary, add a little more water until you get to this state. You should not need more than 1/2 cup nor require longer than 30 seconds processing. Turn the dough out onto your work surface and divide in half. Shape into flattened discs, wrap each into plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 hour.",
      "Take one disc and roll it out onto your floured work surface until about 12\" in diameter. Roll from the center out and rotate your crust quarter turns occasionally to avoid sticking. Transfer the crust to a 9\" pie pan. (To transfer, I gently fold the dough into quarters and unfold in the pan.) Trim the edges, leaving about 1/2\" overhang and then fold them under. Cover with plastic wrap, and place in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes.",
      "Repeat process with second disc. Cut about 3 to 5 long, thin pieces from the middle. Transfer to a parchment paper-lined cookie sheet. Gently pinch each piece all along the length, and then roll so it is rope-like. Using a small flower-shaped cookie cutter, cut out and transfer about 7 flowers to the cookie sheet. With the remaining dough, use an almond-shaped cookie cutter to obtain as many pieces as you can. From the scraps, cut out small circles that will be the center of your flowers. To finish off the leaves, use a knife or clean razor blade to lightly etch \"leaf lines\" into each almond-shaped dough piece. Cover with plastic wrap, and place in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes.",
      "For the filling, rinse and dry the berries. Place them in a large mixing bowl, and stir in the remaining ingredients until uniformly coated. Remove the bottom crust from the refrigerator.",
      "Use a pastry brush to apply a thin layer of egg white to the bottom crust. Pour the filling into the crust-lined pie pan, and level with a spoon.",
      "Whisk together the yolk and cream. Brush a thin layer around the edge of the crust.",
      "Remove the crust flowers, vines and leaves from the refrigerator and let sit for a couple of minutes. Start by putting down one long piece of rope-like dough across the top of the berry filling in a loopy, simple way (like an S shape). Just make sure each end overlaps the bottom crust edges. Lay down the other rope-like pieces as branch-offs, keeping the design simple and loopy. Cut down the lengths of the dough rope as it suits you. Don't worry about bad branch connections or cracking/breaking pieces; you can always cover them up with leaves. Once you are satisfied with the general vine shape, brush a thin layer of the yolk-cream mixture over it. As you finish decorating from this point, apply the yolk-cream mixture on the tops of each piece as you go. Use a little on the undersides of those that do not want to stay (especially the center of the flowers to their petals); it'll work like a paste.",
      "Wherever you want to designate as the \"top\" of your pie, that is where you will place a flower. First place a leaf lightly down on either side. Place a flower down between them, slightly covering the inner corners of the leaves. Place several more leaves around the edge. You will have to raise the previous leaf slightly and slide the new one under. You can place as many around the edge as you want. I did not go all the way around but left a few inches opposite the flower uncovered.",
      "Place as many leaves as desired hanging off the vine branches. You do not need to pinch these down; just gently place each where you want them. Place your flowers where ever looks good to you. Overlapping a leaf or two looks nice.",
      "Place the pie in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes. In the meantime, preheat the oven to 375\u00b0F.",
      "Place the pie in the oven on top of a cookie sheet. At about 10 to 15 minutes into baking, place an aluminum foil ring over the pie edges to prevent them from burning. Continue baking for another 35 to 40 minutes or until the top is golden brown. Serve warm or at room temperature.",

      "Wow. All I can say is, wow. I tried making a triple berry pie on a whim, not really expecting much from it, and I just might have found my favorite fruit pie. Ever. Not only that, but it is incredibly easy to put together. You can probably use any combination of berries you want, adjusting the sugar content accordingly, but I went with fresh blueberries, raspberries, and blackberries. If you decide to use frozen, thaw and drain them first.",
      "The recipe calls for enough dough for a double crust pie, you can use either your favorite pie dough recipe, or the refrigerated pie dough.",
      "The amounts of sugar, milk and butter for dotting the filling and brushing the top crust are fungible, you can judge by eye how much you think is appropriate. Unfortunately \"by eye\" is not accepted as a valid quantity by TK, haha!",
      "Directions:",
      "1. Preheat oven to 450F",
      "2. Combine berries, sugar, cornstarch, salt, and lemon juice in a bowl",
      "3. Line a pie plate with bottom crust. Spread 1 Tablespoon flour over the crust, to prevent crust from getting soggy.",
      "4. Spoon filling into the crust and dot with butter.",
      "5. Place top crust over filling and seal. I chose to make a lattice crust (click on Related Link for more photos), but you can also use a full top crust with vents cut out if you wish. However, a lattice crust really shows off the ruby red filling to perfection. A dual-blade pastry cutter is a nice tool to have for lattice crust-making, it will add lovely little crimps to your dough strips.",
      "6. Brush the top crust with milk and sprinkle with sugar.",
      "7. Place a protective (aluminum foil) shield around the crust edge to prevent excess browning.",
      "8. Place the pie on a parchment-lined cookie sheet, and bake for 15 minutes.",
      "9. Lower oven temp to 375 (without opening the oven) and bake an additional 40-45 minutes, until crust is golden brown. Keep an eye on your crust, different recipes might brown at different rates depending on the amount of butter in the dough.",
      "10. Let pie cool on rack. If you cut the pie too soon, it will run. It needs to sit for several hours at a bare minimum to gel. I waited until the next day to cut mine, and the filling was perfect.",
      "This pie was fabulous. It looked spectacular, was possibly the best smelling thing I've ever baked, and the filling was divine. The combination of berries gave the pie an incredible complex flavor that was slightly tart, as a fresh fruit pie should be. Alone, or paired with vanilla ice cream, this pie was a huge hit when I brought it to work, and I can't give it enough accolades. I'm definitely going to the store to purchase some more berries, I want to make this pie several more times this summer!"

If you are using an electric mixer, mix it at low speed for 10 minutes.

(I add a significant amount of flour, so don't be afraid to keep adding more until you reach the right consistency.)",

Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a damp towel and set aside to rise until it has doubled in size, approximately 90 minutes.",

Roll each piece into a ball, cover the balls with a damp kitchen towel, and let them rest for 20 minutes. This step allows the dough to relax so that it will be easier to shape.",
      "While the dough is resting, preheat the oven to 450\u00b0F. If you have a baking stone, put it in the oven to preheat as well. If you do not have a baking stone, turn a cookie sheet upside down and place it on the middle rack of the oven while it is preheating. This will be the surface on which you bake your pitas.",
      "After the dough has relaxed for 20 minutes, spread a light coating of flour on a work surface and place one of the balls of dough there. Sprinkle a little bit of flour on top of the dough and use a rolling pin or your hands to stretch and flatten the dough. You should be able to roll it out to between 1/4 to 1/8\" thick, 6 inches in diameter. If the dough does not stretch sufficiently, you can cover it with the damp towel and let it rest 5-10 minutes before trying again.",

Once onions are finished, remove the thyme stems.",

Place underneath the broiler until cheese turns golden-brown, about 5-7 minutes, then remove from the oven. Let cool. And with that, you're ready to dig in (the easiest part). Enjoy!"

      "This recipe takes 11-15 days but it's so delicious and worth the time. I never buy store bought kraut after making this.",
      "Day 1: Remove unhealthy leaves from cabbage. Cut in half and core the cabbage. Thinly slice cabbage; use a slicer for uniformed thickness if desired. One cabbage is sliced, place in large bowls and generously salt. Toss with your hands to mix in the salt with the cabbage. Cover with a damp towel on the counter for 24 hours.",
      "Day 2: Peel and shave or slice thin pieces of horseradish, rinse your dill and prepare for the crock. In a large ceramic crock or food grade plastic crock, start by placing 2-3 slices of radish root in the bottom of the crock. Add in 1/4 of your salted cabbage. With clean scrubbed feet, climb into your crock and stomp away (I know it sounds crazy but it's the best way to compress the cabbage to release the juices). Top with 2 dill springs and another few pieces of radish root. Layer 1/4 cabbage and stomp again. Continue layering and stomping until done.",
      "Top with 5-6 slices of radish root. Cover with a plate, and push down until juices surface. (If your cabbage isn't juicy enough, top off with lightly sea salted water to cover.) Weight down the plate with a brick or large container filled with water for weight. Cover with a towel to keep pets, pests and debris from falling in your crock.",
      "Note: Horseradish root will not really flavor the kraut when it's finished. It's purpose is to minimize mold formation. Quince can also be used in its place as it will do the same.",
      "Days 3-15: Check crock daily and skim any mold. Add more sea salted water if needed to keep cabbage submerged.",
      "Note: Foaming will occur. This is normal part of fermentation process, when it stops foaming within those 15 days, it is done, but the longer you let it sit the more sour flavor you'll get.",
      "On the last day, you can test the flavor of your kraut after skimming and removing any browned cabbage. It will be crunchy soft. Remove and place into jars, being sure you scoop in some of that valuable juice. Process cans as you would normally. I hot water bath mine for 15 minutes.",
      "Kraut will keep for up to 6-8 months once opened if kept refrigerated. Some texture may be lost but it will still be good to cook with. (Kraut will soften when cooked.)",
      "Have fun with this. It's really tasty."

Depending on the thickness of the slices, it will take 1 to 3 days. Test for dryness by tearing one in half. There should be no beads of moisture along the tear. The ideal dried tomato is leathery, not moist at all, but not brittle. Store in glass jars, Ziploc bags, or anything that will keep them dry and cool. No need to process or freeze, but you can freeze if you want, for added longevity.",

I then scoop approximately 2 tablespoons cashew cream onto each baked peach crumble and sprinkle additional cinnamon or top with fresh fruit for good measure. And, about that foil, how long you choose to cover the baking peaches depends on how crispy you like your desserts. I let mine brown a little, and it was delicious. But I have discovered over the years, this definitely one of personal preference.",
      "2. To make the cashew cream, soak approximately 1 cup of cashews in warm water for at least 2-3 hours. Combine cashews and soaking water in a high-speed blender. Blend on low speed for 5-6 minutes or until cashews have been creamed. Store in a glass jar in the refrigerator for up to 1 week."

Bake for about 30 minutes or until the outer skin softens and gives under pressure. When cool enough to handle, scoop flesh from skins and use a food processor to puree (you can skip this step if your squash doesn't have a stringy texture).",

      "3. Baked loaves freeze beautifully when wrapped well in plastic followed by heavy-duty foil, being sure to seal very well. Thaw, wrapped, in the fridge overnight."

Take the squash out of the oven and allow it to cool a bit. It will be soft and easy to handle, so just slice it in half, discard the seeds, and scoop out all that beautiful fall goodness. You can do this days or hours in advance and simply refrigerate (or freeze) the squash until you need it."

      "Pour the mixture back in the pot and simmer for another 40 minutes or until you see it has thickened. Tip: Place a small saucer in a fridge before making the jam. When you want to check its thickness, simply take the saucer from the fridge and pour some jam onto it. Leave it cool a few seconds before running your finger through, making a line. If the jam doesn't fill the line, then you are good to go.",

To see if the jars are properly sealed, tap or push down the lid. If it doesn't pop up it's sealed. If it does, it is not airtight. If this happens to you, simply put the jars in your fridge and eat within a week.",
      "Notes:",
      "1. Sanitize your jars and lids by washing them in warm soapy water and subsequently boiling them in water bath for 15 minutes. Using tongs, transfer the jars and lids onto a clean kitchen towel turning them upside down.",
      "2. Airtight sealed jars should last for several weeks, if not months. I advise you to follow current safety standards for canning fruits (sterilize jars and lids plus 10-minute water bath in boiling water once the jars are filled and sealed), especially if you want to can large quantities and you also want to keep your jams for several months. I don't use water bath for extra safety-sterilization simply because I only can in small quantities and we eat our jams very fast (within 1-3 weeks)."

      "I poured my stock into my OXO fat separator. And let me just say, I love this thing. It allows you to quickly strain out any solids, and allows for a clean pour of enriched stock, removing any of the fat. So pour the stock (fat removed if you have a separator) into your soup pot, and set it aside.",
      "Remove the skin from the chicken and discard it. Pull the chicken apart with a couple of forks. It should be super tender. Add the chicken to the stock, and bring that up to medium heat.",

      "Add the mushrooms, coconut milk, remaining two cups of chicken stock, Thai chilies, lemongrass, and galangal into the pot. Give a good stir, and let that come to a simmer.",
      "Once simmering, lower the heat, and let the ingredients infuse in the stock, cooking for about 45 minutes. After 45 minutes, toss in the lime juice, kaffir lime leaves, and fish sauce. Stir, and cook another 5 minutes or so.",
      "To serve, add some of the cooked rice into your soup bowl, and ladle in a generous amount of the soup, keeping all ingredients together. Inform your guests that they should not eat the lemongrass, kaffir, nor galangal. Those are really only there for flavor. Toss in some basil, and dig in.",
      "Your end result is a bowl of comfort. It has that perfect balance of sweet, spice, and sour. And when eaten with rice, well, things just keep getting better. If you are looking for a great soup that has Thai flavors and that balance in food you are looking for, give this one a shot. It is perfect any time of the year, but especially good during a cold afternoon. I hope you enjoy."
