With a small sharp paring knife, trim the stem of the artichoke by starting at the bottom of the stem and trimming toward the top of the artichoke - you are removing the tough dark green outer part of the stem. Slice off the very tip of the stem. With the sharp small paring knife, clean up the bottom of the artichoke by removing any of the dark parts of the leaves that you snapped off. Just slide your knife around the bottom of the artichoke, like you were peeling an apple, and remove all those bits. With a very sharp larger knife, cut off about the top third of the whole artichoke. Place artichoke on cutting board, stem up, and slice right down the stem, cutting the artichoke in half. Rub the cut lemon all over the artichoke, to prevent browning. With your small knife, insert point right under the choke and run knife all the way under the choke and lift out. The choke is the hairy part right under the purple inner leaves. Do not cut into or remove the heart, which lies right under the hairy choke and on top of the stem. Lift out all the hairy choke and inner leaves. Moisten with lemon all of the cut, exposed parts. (See photos in post). Set artichokes in a large baking or roasting dish. (I used a paella pan). Sprinkle with salt and pepper.",

Slice thinly into half rings. Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in skillet. Add leeks and cook, not allowing them to brown, for a few minutes until they are soft. Add garlic and saute for two minutes. Season with some salt and pepper. Turn off heat. Add chopped parsley, bread crumbs and cheese and stir. Transfer to a bowl.",

      "Shape the dough into a flat disk and wrap in plastic wrap. Place the dough in the refrigerator and chill for at least two hours. You can also refrigerate the dough overnight.",
      "When you are ready to prepare the dish... Heat the oven to 350F. Take the dough out of the fridge, unwrap it, but keep the dough loosely covered. Roll the tart dough out between the plastic wrap, this prevents the dough from sticking to your surface without using flour, and makes it easier to transfer to your tart pan.",
      "If the dough is very firm, start by pressing the dough with the rolling pin from the middle to each end, moving the rolling pin by a pin's width each time; turn the dough 180 degrees and repeat; when it softens, start rolling. Roll the dough into a circle about 1/8th inch thick. Now flip the dough over the tart pan, centering it, and delicately press it all around so the corners are well covered. Peel away the plastic wrap. Trim the excess dough hanging over the edges of the pan. Press the remaining dough around the border into the sides of the pan making sure the border is an even thickness all the way around.",

You can use pie weights or dry beans to blind bake. Place whatever weight you're using directly on the parchment paper or aluminum foil in an even layer. Bake for 20 minutes. Remove the beans and foil and continue baking the tart shell until the border is light golden, about 5 minutes (watch carefully to avoid over-baking, which results in a hard shell). If you don't use a baking weight, the crust may rise in the middle: if that occurs, gently push it back down with the back of a spoon. Remove from the oven and let the shell cool completely before proceeding.",
      "Remove the tart shell from the tart pan, and place on a serving plate. Fill the cooled shell with the prepared pastry cream, then sprinkle the pomegranate arils over the top. Enjoy!",

      "Combine the cookie crumbs and melted butter in a small bowl. Toss with a fork to moisten all of the crumbs. Using a flat-sided glass, press the mixture into a thin layer covering the bottom and sides (you want it to be tall - try to get to about 2.5-3 inches high and not too thick in any one spot) of your cheesecake pan. Bake the crust for about 6 minutes and then remove it from the oven and let it cool as you make your cheesecake filling.",
      "In a large bowl, beat the cream cheese and sugar on medium-high speed until well blended. Beat in the flour. Add in the vanilla and beat until well incorporated, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed. Beat in the eggs one at a time, scraping down the bowl between each addition. Pour the filling into your crust.",
      "Bake in the preheated oven until the top is lightly browned, puffed and cracked at the edges, and the center moves only very slightly when the pan is lightly shaken (about 40 minutes). Check while baking periodically and put a pie shield (or strips of foil) around the top of your pan to protect the crust edges if they're getting too dark. Just don't let the shield/foil touch the crust - it's delicate and might crumble.",
      "When done, remove it from the oven and let cheesecake cool before chilling it in the fridge for at least 3 hours. (My crust kind of crumbled on top as the cheesecake cooled and pulled it inward, but don't fret if this happens - everything will still be delicious! I just swept away the crumblies with a pastry brush.)",
      "Make Sticky Toffee Pudding: In the meantime, grease a 9-inch round cake pan. Place a parchment paper round in it to line the bottom, and grease the paper as well. You don't want your pudding stuck in your pan!",

Pour your batter into your prepared pan and bake until the pudding is set up and firm, about 35 minutes (jiggle the pan and watch the middle). Then remove it from the oven and let the pudding cool completely on a wire rack before inverting it onto a wax paper lined plate and popping it in the freezer to firm up for easy handling (or leave it in the fridge overnight).",

      "Place the cake under the broiler until the topping is bubbly, about 1 minute (keep a close watch! I rotated mine carefully every few seconds for even bubbling).

      "I would avoid using grocery store chocolate candy bars, they have a higher wax and filler content and a lower cocoa butter content. Use a high quality chocolate such as Guitard, Peters, Ghiradelli, or Merckens... Good chocolate is not going to be cheap but if you work with chocolate a lot you know it is worth it. If you are using white chocolate do not add any cocoa butter.",
      "You are going to temper the chocolate. Remember that this is a skill that takes time to develop, don't get frustrated if you cause a mess or it isn't perfect right away. You can remelt your mistakes and start over, or better yet, eat them! Every time your chocolate completely hardens and you need to remelt it, you need to re-temper. Chocolate loses its temper every time it melts.",
      "Tempering your chocolate:",
      "Chop your chocolate into bite size pieces. Place 3/4 of the chocolate (1 1/2 pounds of it) and all of the cocoa butter in a double boiler and heat over medium high heat, stirring constantly, or use a slow cooker at low heat and stir every couple minutes (note: using a slow cooker is best for novices, that way you avoid accidently seizing your chocolate or causing \"blooms\" with the water/steam from a double boiler). NEVER EVER melt your chocolate directly on the stove in a regular sauce pan OR in a microwave, it is a surefire way to scorch and ruin it.",
      "You need to heat dark chocolate to about 115F, milk and white need to go to just 105F. Once you reach this temperature, then remove it from the heat and stir vigorously to finish melting all the chocolate. Pour half of the liquid chocolate onto a stone slab, place double boiler on a trivet near your stone. Add the remaining 1/4 (the last half pound) of the unmelted chocolate to the hot melted chocolate that is still in the pan and allow it to melt while you work.",
      "On the slab spread the chocolate thin with your hand or a spatula and then gather all the chocolate back to the center with your hand, repeat about 6 or 7 times until it starts to cool to the touch and thicken. Scrape the chocolate off the stone and back into the rest of the chocolate. Stir chocolate until everything is melted and smooth.",
      "How to make the cups:",
      "When the chocolate is completely melted and a nice smooth texture, fill/inflate the water balloons and tie them off, do not over fill the balloons - there should be some give on their surface or else they may pop when the chocolate contracts as it cools.",
      "Stir the chocolate briskly just prior to dipping. Holding the tied off end of the balloon in your hand, dip the smooth bottom end of each balloon in the chocolate, up to about 1/2 of the way up the balloon. Give it a little shake to remove excess chocolate to ensure a light layer. To make petals, dip the balloon at a 45 degree angle, then remove it from chocolate, turn it 1/4 and then dip at the same angle, repeat 2 more times so you have a total of 4 petals.",
      "Do not let the balloons touch the sides of the chocolate container or they may pop. Place the dipped balloons on a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper. Hold them in place for 10 to 20 seconds to allow them to set enough to stand up on their own.",
      "When all the balloons are on the tray, place tray in a fridge or freezer for at least 30 minutes to set (do not leave them in any loger than that). Remove tray from fridge/freezer and use a pin to pop each balloon. Gently remove balloons from cups and they are ready to serve.",
      "Fill them with anything you like; mousse, ice cream, candies, etc.",
      "If you cannot find cocoa butter you can substitute 1 1/2 tablespoons of vegetable oil instead. The purpose of adding the butter or oil is to aid the tempering by thinning and smoothing the chocolate, it also adds a nice sheen to the finished product."

      "1) Level off the oranges with a serrated knife so that they sit nicely on a flat surface. You just want to shave off a sliver of the bottom - not all the way through into the orange flesh. Slice off the top of the oranges, reserving the tops. Carefully remove the flesh of the orange with a grapefruit knife or paring knife but don't poke all the way through the bottom of the orange. Remove the remainder of the flesh with a spoon. Place the orange cups and the tops into the freezer on a plate for at least two hours.",
      "2) When ready to serve, collect everything you'll need before removing the oranges from the freezer. You'll need serving plates, the ice cream, the sherbet, an ice cream scoop, the mint, and the cookies.",
      "3) Remove the oranges from the freezer. (Avoid handling the frozen orange cups with your hands as it will leave fingerprints). Using a spatula, place an orange on each serving plate. Add a scoop of sherbet, packing the sherbet into the orange with a spoon. Then add a scoop of vanilla, pack it in there as well. Lastly, add another generous scoop of the sherbet. Top with the orange top and a sprig of mint. Serve with a couple of pretty cookies. Serves four very happy guests."

Open the can of dulce de leche and spread some on the cake for the filling. If it's not spreadable, heat it up a bit in a bowl (out of the can) in the microwave, so it's smooth and then try spreading. Once you have a thin layer of dulce de leche add the second cake. Be sure to place the flat side of the cake on top of the one with the filling already spread.",
      "In your mixer, whisk together the heavy cream and sugar until peaks form. Grab a pastry bag and insert a star decorating tip (I used Wilton 8B), scoop in the whipped cream. Make small stars along the rim of the top cake. Decorate about three times around. Now, grab another pastry bag and star tip, scoop in the remaining dulce de leche. Add a small rim of the dulce de leche in the center of the cake. Complete with more whipped cream stars.",

      "When ingredients come together, add 1 cup of flour a little at a time, allowing the flour to be incorporated between additions. The dough will probably be cleaning the sides of the sides of the bowl, depending on the moisture content of the flour. Add just enough flour, a little at a time, to make a mildly stiff dough. It is better to err on the side of having a slightly softer dough than to have a heavy dough-you don't want to make brickbats, right? The dough should be easy to handle and hold its shape well. It's a dough thing-do your best. Allow the mixer to knead the dough until smooth and elastic (the dough, not the mixer).",

      "To form a bagel out of each ball, press your thumbs through the center of the dough ball. Pick the dough up and, with it resting in your upward-turned palms, put your fingers through the center hole and thumbs around the outside of the dough. Enlarge the hole by gently pulling and squeezing the dough with your hands. Continually work your way around the dough while enlarging the diameter of the circle and pulling it (gently) into an oval.",
      "Place the dough onto either a parchment-lined cookie sheet or an oiled cookie sheet, if you don't have parchment paper. (Two half-sheet cake pans will also work well.) You will only be able to fit two bagels side by side on each cookie sheet with the long portion of the oval running lengthwise in the pan. Continue to shape the bagels on the pan-they should be nearly as long as the pan. There should be several inches at the widest part between the two sides of each oval. Be sure to leave space between the ovals because they will need room to rise.",
      "To make an egg wash, whisk together the whole egg and the 2 teaspoons water. Brush each bagel with the egg wash, then sprinkle with sesame seeds. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and set in a warm place to rise until approximately doubled in size.",
      "Uncover and bake in a 350\u00b0F oven until golden brown, about 20-30 minutes. If baking two pans at once, be sure to rotate them halfway through the cooking time. Remove from the oven and allow to cool before eating.",
      "Serve with a little olive oil and za'atar for dipping. My son in-law ate these dipped in mustard, as you would do with a pretzel. Good idea.",
      "Note: za'atar is a blend of herbs such as thyme, oregano, marjoram, sumac, toasted sesame seeds, and salt. If you do not have access to za'atar, there are numerous recipes for it on the internet. Otherwise, just use a nice powdery blend of Mediterranean or Middle Eastern type spices along with some toasted sesame seeds and salt."

Let muffins cool for a minute or two, then gently lift each muffin and tilt it so it's resting in the muffin cup almost on its side (this lets them cool without continuing to bake). Allow muffins to cool in the pans just until cool enough to handle, then transfer to a wire rack.",

Cover the surface with plastic wrap to prevent a skin forming and chill in an airtight container for up to 3 days.",

Cover and refrigerate if not using immediately.",

You may need to break the pound cake slices into smaller pieces and jigsaw them together to fit. Then drizzle on about 1/3 of the berry syrup. Don't worry if it doesn't completely coat the pound cake - just drizzle it across and let the berries fall where they may. Spoon a layer of lemon cream over the top, smoothing to the sides. Repeat all the layers, 2 or 3 more times, depending on the size of the bowl, finishing with a layer of lemon cream. Cover and refrigerate until ready to serve. It is best to make this several hours before serving and refrigerate it."

      "1. In the bowl of your stand mixer, dissolve yeast in warm water in large bowl and let it stand 5 minutes. Add buttermilk, sugar, butter, eggs, baking powder, salt and 21/2 cups of the flour. With the whisk attachment, beat on low speed for 30 seconds, stopping to scrape the bowl a couple of times. Then beat on medium speed 2 minutes, scraping the bowl occasionally. Stir in remaining flour with a wooden spoon (I added 4 cups all-purpose here, but try 3-3.5 first to see how it works for you). Switch to the dough attachment and knead about 5-10 minutes until smooth and elastic. The dough should be soft and slightly sticky.",
      "2. Turn dough onto a well-floured surface and divide into 3 equal parts. I weighed mine to be sure they were even. Roll each part into a rectangle, 15x9 inches. Place them on greased cookie sheets. (These instructions are for 3 cakes, but I cut 2 of those in half and made 4 smaller cakes to freeze and bake one at a time when I need it.)",
      "3. Now for the filling: With the paddle attachment of your stand mixer, beat the cream cheese with the almond paste until well mixed. Spread 1/3 of the cream cheese mixture in a strip about 21/2 inches wide lengthwise down center of the rectangle. Mix the apricot jam with the lemon juice and spread 1/3 of this mixture over the cream cheese mixture. Make cuts in the dough at 1/2-inch intervals on both of the long (15-inch) sides almost all the way to the filling. First fold the ends in and then fold the strips over the filling, overlapping and crossing in center. You can leave the cake like it is, or it can be carefully stretched into a shape, such as a candy cane or heart, if desired. Repeat for the other 2 dough rectangles.",
      "4. At this point, you can either allow the cakes to rise or you can refrigerate or freeze them. To refrigerate, cover loosely with plastic wrap. The dough will rise in the fridge a bit. You can keep it there for 1-2 days before baking. When ready to bake, allow it to come to room temperature first and to rise more if necessary (it should be double in size).",
      "Here's how I froze my small cakes: Take an empty cereal box and flatten it, then cover it in foil. Place two sheets of plastic wrap over it so that they hang over the edges. Place two small sized cakes next to each other on it and pull the plastic wrap over to cover them tightly. Put another piece of plastic wrap over the top and tuck it under the edges of the cakes. Carefully cover the whole thing in foil again. Place it directly in the freezer, not allowing the cakes to rise. They can probably be frozen for up to 3 months if covered properly. When you want to bake one, pull it out of the freezer and place it on a greased baking sheet. Cover it loosely with plastic wrap and a tea towel. It can sit on the counter or in the fridge while it defrosts. After it's defrosted, allow it to come to room temperature and then rise in a warm place until doubled in size.",
      "To let the cakes rise: Remove the plastic wrap and towel, turn the oven on to 450\u00b0F (230\u00b0C) for one or two minutes and then turn it off. Now you have a warm, draft free place to let the cakes rise. It will take about 1 hour. Dough is ready if doubled in size and indentation remains when touched.",
      "5. When ready to bake: Heat oven to 375\u00b0F. Whisk the egg with the milk and brush this mixture over the dough. Then sprinkle slivered almonds over the top. Bake 20 to 25 minutes or until golden brown. Mix up all of the glaze ingredients and drizzle it over warm coffee cakes. Cakes are best when served the day they are baked. That is why freezing extra cakes is a good option. Store any leftovers covered in plastic wrap or in an air tight container at room temperature for up to a day.",
      "Note: The filling, while delicious, is more almondy than cream cheesy. If you prefer a stronger cream cheese flavor, you could make a cream cheese glaze instead of the basic glaze provided in the ingredients list. For this, you will beat 3 ounces of cream cheese with 3 Tablesp0ons of powdered sugar. Then add in about 2 Tablespoons of milk and 1/4 teaspoon of vanilla. Adjust ingredients as needed to find your desired consistency."

Then transfer to your mixer bowl and re-whip for 30 seconds to re-fluff. Yes. Re-fluff.",

      "Get your chocolate chips, and melt them in a double boiler with a bit of butter. I didn't have a double boiler, so I used a glass bowl set over a small pot of water. Don't turn your heat too high. Melt the chocolate slowly until it's all melted and yummy. Now, take it over to your cake, and using a spoon or a butter knife, plop little globs (between a teaspoon and a teaspoon and a half) all over the top surface of your cake. My little globs looked like slugs, and suddenly I wasn't hungry for cake. But that's okay, because I fixed it. When it looks like you've got enough chocolate on your cake (you probably won't use all the chocolate), take a butter knife and swirl it around in the pan, creating a marble effect. Be sure the knife goes all the way to the bottom of the pan, and go through all the little chocolate 'slugs'. Add more chocolate at the end if you think you didn't add enough yet.",
      "Then, stick it in the preheated oven. It might take longer than 30 minutes, so you'll have to keep an eye on it. If you decide that you're crazy, and would like to bake a wedding cake, you'll need to triple the recipe and split it between three pans, a 14 inch a 10 inch and a 6 inch. And do that twice, so you have two layers of each size."

      "Cooking is a science. Explain to your children when they cook with you how the chemistry of food is a fascinating part of what happens while making then completing some recipes.",
      "Kids and adults both love marshmallows, but have you ever made your own?",
      "Taste the difference!",
      "Marshmallows depend on gelatin, a common household ingredient to create their shape and texture. For young scientists however, gelatin is also a great way to demonstrate how molecules can rearrange to change matter from one state to another. Follow the directions below to see just what can happen when gelatin meets some sugar, cornstarch, and heat.",
      "In a small bowl, combine the cornstarch and confectioner's sugar.",
      "Grease the sides of a 9\" square baking pan, and place a sheet of parchment paper or wax paper, cut to size, along the bottom and then grease that, too.",
      "Use a bit of the cornstarch mixture to dust the bottom and sides of the greased pan.",
      "Place the contents of the packets of gelatin into a small saucepan, and mix in the cold water. Let it stand for one minute, and then stir over low heat until the gelatin is fully dissolved. (What's happening? The water has spread out the special protein fibers that make up the gelatin, and the heat has dissolved their original bonds. That's why the gelatin seems to \"dissolve\" into the water.)",
      "Now pull out a mixing bowl, and blend the granulated sugar, corn syrup, and vanilla. Add the gelatin mixture, and beat the whole mixture thoroughly-for up to 12-15 minutes-with an electric mixer. Watch the mix become thick and creamy.",
      "Pour it into the greased baking pan, and let it stand at room temperature for at least 4 hours. (What happens: the protein bonds will begin to re-form as the gelatin cools, but now it's mixed with other ingredients, so it will hold them together, too, in classic \"marshmallow\" texture.)",
      "After four hours, or overnight, place the white sheet on a cutting board which has been sprinkled with the remaining cornstarch-sugar mixture. Cut into cubes with a knife. (Hint: it's helpful to dip the knife into hot water first, to keep marshmallow from sticking!)",
      "Roll the cut-up marshmallows in the cornstarch mixture to keep them dry to the touch, and then devour!",
      "Jazz them up with sprinkles, drizzles, chocolate or any fun topping you wish. Serve them as s'mores; you can't go wrong here! In the photo, we served them on graham crackers and let the kids decorate them. Not sure who ate more, the kids or the parents!",
      "Gotta love it when science and cooking collide!",
      "Enjoy!"

    "directions": [
      "This will make eight 8-inch tortillas.",
      "Combine your dry ingredients in a mixing bowl. Cut in the shortening with a pastry cutter, a fork, or your fingers, until it's combined. I use my fingers, because my pastry cutter is in storage. Add the water a splash at a time, loosely mixing it in. When all of the water has been added, you should be able to form the dough into a ball. If your ball won't stay together, work in more warm water by the tablespoon, until the ball holds its shape. It shouldn't be sticky, it should be just cohesive enough to not fall apart. Knead this ball 15 times, and then leave it to rest for 15 minutes.",
      "While it's resting, you can prepare your fillings! If you use a skillet to cook your fillings, when you're done, simply wipe it clean and return it to the heat. You'll want your pan to be just above medium heat when you place the tortillas on, and fully heated.",
      "After the rest, divide your dough into 8 even pieces. You don't have to be super exact, just break it in half, break your halves in half, then break those pieces in half, and you'll have 8. Using a floured rolling pin and a floured surface, roll each ball into a rough circle. Or a perfect circle, if you're talented or a perfectionist or both. The circles should be about 8 inches. I have a problem with circles, and I usually end up with ovals. Or quadrangles. But hey, that's part of the charm of homemade tortillas, right?",
      "You'll cook one tortilla at a time in your heated ungreased pan. Place in the first tortilla, and wait about 30 seconds. It should puff a bit. Flip it over, wait about 20 seconds, then remove it from the pan. You can use this one as a guide for the rest. If you'd like the brown spots to be a bit browner, add 5-10 seconds to the cook time. If they're too brown already, turn the heat down a little; it shouldn't take less than 20 seconds per side to cook. If it looks to be a bit thick, quickly give the rest of the tortillas another roll or two with the pin.",
      "Now you know just how long to cook the other 7 tortillas. Do so, one at a time. As they come off of the pan, I like to stack them on a plate with some foil thrown over it, to keep their heat in.",
      "If you'd like to make them in advance, you should lay them out on their own little sheets of waxed paper until they cool completely. When they are room temperature, cover each one with another sheet of waxed paper, stack them all, and place them in a plastic freezer bag. They'll keep well in the fridge for a week and in the freezer for a couple months.",
      "To reheat, thaw them completely if they're frozen. Take away the waxed paper and wrap the stack of tortillas in foil. Place them in a 350 F oven for 10 minutes. Alternately, reheat them individually in a medium temperature skillet for 20 seconds per side."

      "Begin by cleaning and peeling the potatoes. Dice them into 1-inch cubes, as this will cause them to cook faster. Boil them in a pot of salted water with the minced garlic, minced shallots, parsley and thyme until you can cut them with the edge of a fork. I like to boil my potatoes with the garlic, onions and other seasonings because I feel it allows the flavor to seep into the potatoes better. Who knows if it's really true.",
      "Drain the water and mash the potatoes with the tines of a fork until only a few lumps remain. You should mash this less than you would for mashed potatoes-lumps are your friend here. Set aside.",
      "In the same pot that you boiled the potatoes in, melt the butter or margarine and add the milk. As the milk begins to boil, add the Laughing Cow Cheese (cut into small pieces) or the cheese of your choice (if you're lucky enough to have a grocery store that stocks cheese, not \"cheese product\"). Stir constantly until the cheese melts. This will take longer for the Laughing Cow cheese triangles as they don't like to melt. Be careful not to burn the milk and watch it to make sure it doesn't boil over (as milk likes to do).",
      "When the cheese has melted, add the mashed potato mixture and stir to combine. The soup will be very \"soupy\" right now. Don't be concerned. Bring the milk back to a low boil and stir. The soup will thicken as it cooks. Add the nutmeg, black pepper, mustard powder, salt and chili pepper, stirring to combine.",
      "Enjoy the soup when it has reached your desired thickness. I like my soup thick enough to hold a spoon on the surface."

Add vanilla and a few dashes of milk, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed, beating until just combined. (If icing is too stiff - add a tad more milk until desired consistency is reached. If too thin - add a tad more powdered sugar.) Tint with any color food coloring of your choosing. Beat until color is consistent and well combined. Refrigerate until ready to use.",
      "FOR DECORATING:",
      "To decorate, lay out a sheet of wax paper. On a piece of plain paper draw an outline of legs (see photo). Place the stencil under a sheet of wax paper.",
      "Melt white candy melts in a bowl set over a pan of simmering water with a drop each of red and yellow food coloring plus 1/4 teaspoon of cocoa powder. Stir until melted - add additional color until it looks like desired skin color.",
      "When melted ladle the chocolate into a plastic squeeze bottle. Working fast, fill the outline of legs with white chocolate. Move paper stencil under the sheet of wax paper and repeat until 12 sets of legs have been made.",
      "Melt the chocolate candy melts in double boiler as instructed above and transfer to a separate squeeze bottle. Outline the feet for shoes and draw garter on one leg for each pair. Immediately place these on the dragees, if desired.",
      "Set aside to set (or place in freezer to speed up process if desired). Ladle buttercream into a plastic decorator's bag with a large petal tip in it. With the small side of the icing tip facing outward go around the outside rim of each cupcake with a back and forth motion. Continue for the middle as well with a layer of frosting desired. Continue until cupcake is completely covered. If you don't like how it looks, just scrape it off and try again. It took me a few tries to get the look I was going for. It helps if the buttercream is cold. Immediately top with firmed chocolate legs. Enjoy!"

      "In a heat proof mixing bowl, combine egg whites, sugar, and pinch of salt. Place over a pan with about 2 inches of simmering water. The bowl should NOT touch the water.",
      "Whisk constantly in the double-boiler for about 3 minutes, until all the sugar granules are dissolved. To test, rub some of the mixture between your fingertips; it should be smooth and slippery with no grains remaining.",
      "Remove from heat and place the bowl on your stand mixer or a hot mat if using a hand mixer (and yes, this CAN be done with a decent hand mixer). Whip meringue mixture on medium speed for 5 to 10 minutes, or until cooled and stiff peaks have formed.",
      "Add the very soft butter one stick at at time, incorporating completely before adding the next. DO NOT PANIC if your mixture curdles or appears soupy after adding the butter. Continue whipping on high speed until it comes back together. This can take up to 15 or 20 minutes for some people, but it usually only takes about 10 minutes. Some folks don't have trouble with this step at all. The frosting should whip up very soft and smooth but still able to hold firm peaks.",
      "Add flavoring extract of your choice at this point. Basic vanilla is lovely; lemon extract is also delicious. If coloring, paste food color is preferred over liquid drops to avoid adding excess moisture to the buttercream.",
      "This buttercream may be used immediately and is suitable for both spreading and piping. It can also be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for 3 or 4 days (with plastic wrap touching the surface of the frosting) or packed in the freezer for up to 1 month. Thaw in the fridge and allow refrigerated buttercream to sit out on the counter until it comes to room temperature before whipping on medium speed and spreading/piping."

      "In a separate bowl, beat butter, cream cheese, vanilla and 3/4 cup powdered sugar together for 2 minutes. Add melted chocolate to cream cheese mix. Beat 1 minute. Fold in the whipped cream mixture.",

      "4. Making the chocolate covered strawberries: Melt chocolate and shortening in the microwave on high in 15 second increments. Stir each time and stop once it's melted and smooth. Dip or drizzle melted chocolate onto each strawberry. Place on a sheet of wax paper to dry.",
      "5. Place 1 layer of cake on your serving platter. Spread 1 cup of filling on top. Layer the sliced strawberries on top of filling. Repeat cake layer, filling, strawberries. Repeat cake layer, filling, strawberries. Place final layer on top. Frost cake with the frosting and place chocolate dipped strawberries on top.",
      "**Tips:**",
      "1. If you don't have 4 round pans, then use two and let the batter sit out while the first set of cakes bake and cools for 10 minutes. Put the cakes on a wire rack and use the cake pan and parchment paper over again.",
      "2. You can use parchment paper or nonstick foil on the bottom of the cake pan to keep the bottom from sticking.",
      "3. You can make the mousse 1-2 days ahead of time as long as it is very airtight in the fridge. The fudge buttercream frosting can be made ahead of time and stored in the fridge as well. If you do this, just make sure to let it sit out to warm up a few hours before decorating.",

Then press the ball evenly with your fingers, creating a flat disk which is the same diameter as your cookie. Lay the filling onto the flat side of one cookie and then top with a second cookie (flat sides in). If you have omitted the Marshmallow Fluff, spread 1-2 tablespoons full of filling onto the flat side of one cookie and then top with a second cookie (flat sides in). You could also pipe the filling onto the cookies - if you're fancy like.",

Pour the limeade (2 cups water mixed with 1 cup concentrate) over the ice until it is even with the top of the ice. Put a tight-fitting lid on the jar and shake. The movement of the ice across the mint leaves and the limes will release additional flavor into the jar of limeade. Remove lid and serve.",

      "Start out with the freshest and ripest tomatoes available. Wash them thoroughly and cut off any blemishes or excessive core parts. Cut them into quarters or eighths depending on the size of the tomato.",

      "Slice or quarter all of the tomatoes a couple of pounds at a time and put into a large pot. Heat immediately to boiling while crushing. A potato masher works well. Continue to slowly add and crush freshly cut tomato quarters to the boiling mixture. Make sure the mixture boils constantly and vigorously while you add the remaining tomatoes. When the pot is full, heat this for another 5 minutes. (You may have to do this in batches.)",
      "Press the heated tomato juice through a sieve or food mill to remove skins and seeds. You can also use a juicer if it is one made for hot liquids. Keep adding the juice to a large stock pot as it's being extracted.",
      "Bring the pot of juice to a boil and let this boil for about 10 minutes and skim off any large amounts of white foam. At this point, the juice will be watery. Turn the pot down to a low boil and add the green pepper, celery, onion, garlic and parsley. Cook for about an hour and a half, occasionally stirring and until you see the consistency of tomato juice. This could take less time or could take more time, depending on the amount of water in your tomatoes. When your juice has cooked to the desired consistency, it is time to add salt and pepper. Add by constantly tasting and adding.",
      "While the tomato juice is cooking, prepare your jars. Wash your jars in soapy hot water and inspect the tops for any chips or cracks.",

      "Add 2 tablespoons of lemon juice to the bottom of each quart jar (1 tablespoon to a pint). This will acidify the juice and helps avoid spoilage and increase safety.",
      "Fill jars with hot tomato juice, leaving 1/4-inch headspace. Immediately put on a hot lid and hand tighten it with a band and set into the canner rack.",
      "Ensure that the water in the canner is boiling and lower the rack. There should be about 1-2 inches of water covering the top of the jars. Process the quart jars for 35 minutes (process pints for 30 minutes).",
      "Be very carefull! Things are HOT!",
      "Lift the jars out of the water with jar grips and let them cool on a towel, without touching or bumping in a draft-free place (usually takes overnight). Once the jars are cool, you can check that they are sealed, verifying that the lid has been sucked down. Just press in the center, gently, with your finger. If it pops up and down (often making a popping sound), it is not sealed. If you put the jar in the refrigerator right away, you can still use it."
