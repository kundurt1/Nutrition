      "In a 2-quart saucepan, bring the rice and water to a boil; lower the heat so the mixture no longer boils so vigorously. Continue to cook the rice, covered, until the water is almost entirely absorbed. The amount of time this takes depends on the age of your rice.",
      "Once most of the water is absorbed, check to see if the rice kernels have split and softened and the overall consistency has become like runny oatmeal. If not, add more water, one cup at a time, and bring the mixture back to a boil then lower the heat and simmer, covered.",
      "Continue to check for doneness and add more water along the way as necessary. You shouldn't need more 4 cups of water, and the rice shouldn't take longer than 45 minutes to soften and gelatinize.",
      "Once the grains have split and released some starch, turn off the heat. Let the rice kernels continue to swell as they cool in the covered pot.",
      "After the rice has cooled down somewhat, you'll see that there's no liquid left in the pot and the rice has become soft (though it's not going to be entirely soft and smooth as we're dealing with whole grain here) and gooey.",
      "Your black rice porridge is now ready to be sweetened and salted.",
      "To serve, spoon the rice porridge into a serving bowl, top with the coconut cream, fresh fruits, nuts and/or seeds."

Add the celery, carrot, and mushrooms and continue to saute for about 2 minutes, or until half cooked. Add the chicken and saute gently for 3 to 4 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through. Remove from the heat, stir in the peas, and set the pan aside.",
      "Rinse the rice and let it drain from 10 minutes in a sieve positioned over a bowl. Meanwhile, bring the stock to a near simmer in a small saucepan and then cover to keep it hot.",
      "In a heavy-bottomed 5-quart Dutch oven or similar pot, heat the remaining 3 tablespoons oil over medium-high heat. Firmly shake the sieve holding the rice to expel any hidden water, and then add the rice to the pot. Stir constantly with a large spoon for about 3 minutes, or until the grains are opaque and feel light. Add the stock and expect dramatic boiling. Immediately give the rice and stock a big stir, then lower the heat to medium so the contents simmer and cover the pot. Put your ear by the pot and you will hear gentle bubbling.",
      "During the next 5 minutes, encourage the grains to absorb the stock and cook evenly. To do this, periodically remove the lid, give the rice a big, quick stir, and then replace the lid. I typically stir the rice 3 times, usually about 30 seconds after the steam plumes begin shooting from under the lid. The rice will first swim in stock and then progressively become less easy to move. Small craters will form on the surface, too. When you stir the third time, the rice should stick a bit to the pan and most of the stock will have been absorbed. (If it has not reached this point, continue cooking for a minute or so and check again.) At this point, level the rice and turn the heat to low. Cover and cook for 10 minutes.",
      "Uncover and add the vegetables and chicken and any juices from the skillet, distributing them evenly over the rice. Replace the lid and continue cooking for 10 minutes longer. Uncover and stir the contents, scraping the bottom to combine all the ingredients. Replace the lid, remove from the heat, and let the rice sit for 10 minutes to allow the flavors to meld.",
      "Fluff the rice with chopsticks or a fork and then spoon it into 1 or 2 serving bowls or platters. If a little crust has formed on the bottom of the pot, scoop it out and serve the shards separately for anyone who enjoys their crisp, nutty taste."

Start with less lime juice and fish sauce than you think prudent as you can always add more. (It's good to have about 1/4 cup of fish sauce and 3-4 limes on hand just so you know you have enough ingredients to work with even though you may not need to use all of them. Also, take into consideration whether your cashews are salted or not. If they are, go easy on the fish sauce.)",

      "In a medium saucepan, heat olive oil over medium heat until shimmering. Add rice and cook, stirring, until they turn translucent around the edges, about 3 minutes. Add 2 tablespoons butter and leeks and cook, stirring, until butter is melted and leeks are tender but not browned, about 5 minutes.",
      "Add wine and simmer, stirring, until it has evaporated, about 3 minutes. Add 1/2 cup warm stock and stir until almost all the liquid has been absorbed. Continue cooking the rice, adding the broth in 1/2-cup additions, and stirring until the liquid is absorbed before the next addition, until rice is al dente, about 20 minutes. The rice can be kept warm at this point until ready to finish.",
      "When ready to finish, stir in enough warm stock to loosen risotto to a creamy consistency. Stir in the remaining 2 tablespoons butter, mascarpone, Parmigiano-Reggiano, and lemon zest and juice. Season with salt and pepper. When finished, the grains of rice should be suspended in a thick and creamy sauce; if risotto thickens too much, simply add additional warm stock or water to restore proper consistency.",
      "Add butter to a small saucepan set over medium heat. Cook, stirring and swirling the pan every few seconds, until the foam subsides and the butter begins to turn golden brown and smells nutty, about 3 minutes. Off the heat, stir in garlic and let it sizzle for about 10-15 seconds, then add lemon juice. Season with salt and pepper; keep warm.",
      "Season scallops with salt. Let stand in the refrigerator for 15 minutes.",
      "Remove salted scallops from the refrigerator and pat dry. Season lightly with a little more salt. Heat vegetable oil in a large stainless steel or cast iron skillet over high heat until lightly smoking. Add scallops, leaving space between each one. Press each scallop down very lightly with a spatula to ensure good contact with the pan.",
      "Cook scallops without moving them until well browned on first side, 1-2 minutes. Carefully flip scallops and cook until seared on opposite side and medium-rare within, about 1 minute longer. Transfer scallops to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. To serve, scoop risotto into warmed bowls, top with scallops, and drizzle with the sauce. Top with a few peppers, if using."

With a pastry brush, brush melted butter over the layer of phyllo you'll be working with. Put one teaspoon of filling at the bottom of 1 phyllo strip. Fold the lower right-hand corner up and to the left, so that the former bottom of the strip is now even with the left-hand side, making a little triangular pouch at the bottom of the strip. Fold that pouch up.

If the dough cracks when you start to roll, it may be too cold, Let it stand for 10 minutes, then try again-this dough rolls most easily when it is at cool room temperature. Ads you roll, the parchment will wrinkle, especially on the bottom. When this happens, peel off the top parchment paper, smooth out any wrinkles, and place it back on the dough. Flip the dough and repeat with the paper on the other side. You may need to do this several times during the rolling process.",

Stack the cookies on the sheet pan with a piece of parchment paper between each layer. Scraps of dough can be gently kneaded then rerolled, but the more they are rerolled, the less tender the cookies, so strategically place your cookie cutters to leave as few scraps as possible.

I found that I could get a sharper line down the middle if I started frosting from the outside in, finishing with a stroke down the center. When adding the second color of frosting, the key is to make sure you frost the part where the two colors touch last, frosting the dividing line in one smooth stroke (no backtracking or you will drag the other color of frosting back with you!).",

      "For the dressing: On a griddle or in a cast iron pan, pressing with a spatula, toast the chiles for 30 seconds or so on each side until they begin to blister and emit a small wisp of smoke. Soak them in a container submerged with hot water for 30 minutes. In a small saucepot, ignite the tequila to burn off the alcohol, and reduce by two thirds. Place the walnuts in a blender, along with the mustard, vinegar, reduced tequila, and soaked chiles (you can discard the soaking liquid, or use it to thin out the vinaigrette if the results are a little too thick). Puree with some oil, and continue adding the oil in a slow stream until the dressing is emulsified. Season with salt to taste and check for acidity, adjusting with vinegar or lime juice if necessary. A small pinch of sugar may be nice here, as well.",
      "For the salad: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Rinse the beets well, remove the tops if they are still attached, and, while still wet, coat the beets liberally with salt. Salt roast for about an hour, depending on the size of the beets, or until they are fork tender. Peel the beets, and shave them with a mandolin, or slice them thinly with a knife. Using the mandolin, or a knife, slice the fennel across the grain and slice the red onion to the same thickness of the beet slices. In one bowl, place the beets, in another, the fennel and onion. This will prevent staining the lighter colored components beet red, and preserve the attractive colors reminiscent of the Mexican flag.",
      "Heat a griddle or cast iron pan, lay down a thin film of oil, and cook the morcilla, crisping up the casing of the sausage. It may be finished in the oven, but take care not to burst the casing. Remove the sausages from the heat, allow to rest for a minute while you dress your salad. In the bowls with the beets and fennel, place a spoonful of dressing, along with the herbs. Season with salt, and toss until you are satisfied. On four plates, drag some of the dressing under where you plan to plate the morcilla, and off to the side build your salad, alternating layers of beet and fennel in an appealing way. Slice your morcilla on the bias, and fan out over the drag of dressing. Garnish with chopped walnuts, or, for a refined look, use a microplane to make it rain walnuts all over the plate. Make sure to set out an extra plate, as well as a glass of water and a beer for the spirit of the dead that will be joining your feast."

It's not an exact process.",

Take about a tablespoon of the almond paste and spread it on the lower part of the dough, and then spread it about halfway up, leaving most of it at the end. Roll the dough up and place it, seam-side down, on the prepared sheet pan. Leave plenty of room between the rolls.",

      "Bake until the biscuits are well-risen and golden brown, about 25 minutes (or longer if cut thicker than 3/4-inch). Let the biscuits cool about 5 minutes to help set their crumb, then serve as desired, whether alongside soups and stews or split for shortcake or breakfast sandwiches. Leftovers can be stored up to a week in an airtight container; to serve, split the stale biscuits in half, brush with melted butter, arrange on a baking sheet, and broil until golden brown, then serve with jam."

      "Sift flour into a medium bowl, then add sugar, black sesame seeds, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Whisk until well combined (this may take a minute or more). Add cubed butter, toss to break up the pieces, and smash each cube flat. Continue smashing and rubbing until butter has mostly disappeared into a floury mix, although a few larger, Cheerio-sized pieces may remain. (This can also be done with 4 or 5 pulses in a",

      "Add buttermilk and stir with a flexible spatula until the flour has been fully absorbed. The dough will seem rather crumbly and dry at first, but keep mixing until it finally comes together. (Don't worry about over-mixing; until the flour has been fully incorporated, the greater concern is under-mixing.) Once the dough forms a rough ball, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface.",
      "Using your bare hands, gently pat dough into a squarish shape about 1/2 inch thick, then fold in half; repeat twice more for a total of 3 folds, using only enough flour to keep your hands from sticking. Finish by patting the dough to a thickness of 3/4 inch. Dust away any excess flour, if necessary, then cut dough into 3-inch rounds and arrange closely in a 10-inch cast iron skillet. Gather scraps into a ball, pat and fold a single time, then cut as many more biscuits as you can. The final round of scraps can be gathered and shaped into a single biscuit by hand.",
      "Brush tops of biscuits with sesame oil and bake until biscuits are well risen and golden brown, about 30 minutes. Let biscuits cool about 5 minutes to help set their crumb, then serve fresh, whether alongside soups and stews or as a base for a fried chicken sandwich."

Pour the wet mixture into the well in the dry mixture and begin mixing the two together with your hands, gradually incorporating the dry into the wet. This process will be more like mixing than kneading. After about 3 minutes, when the wet and dry are well combined, set the mixture aside and let it rest, uncovered, for 15 minutes. This allows time for the flour to absorb the moisture.",
      "Flour your hands and a work surface. Gently but firmly knead the mixture on the work surface for about 3 minutes. Reflour your hands and the surface as needed. The dough will be moist and sticky, but after",
      "a few minutes of kneading it should come together into a smooth mass. Divide the dough into 2 pieces, shape them gently into balls, and wrap them in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for at least 24 and up to 48 hours before using. This process, called proofing, allows for the fermentation that gives the dough structure-which means a chewy, pliable crust-and flavor.",

      "Lightly flour your hands and work surface. Using your fingertips, push down any bubbles in the dough. Then use your fingertips to push down on the round of dough, from the center out to the perimeter, to encourage it to spread out.",
      "Aiming for a round that's no bigger than 12 inches across and no less than 1/8 inch thick in the center, stretch the dough into a round: Pick up the disc of dough and hold your hands parallel to the floor. Then squeeze your fingers together and curve them so that your hands are like paddles. Drape the dough over one hand and flip it over to the other hand in a smooth motion. Continue moving the dough slowly back and forth, rotating it 90 degrees every few seconds so that you end up with a circle. It will start to stretch. After 1 to 2 minutes, you should have a round of dough that's about 12 inches in diameter. Transfer it to a floured pizza peel-preferably a metal one-and gently push out any edges that need pushing to make a better-looking circle.",
      "Scatter the dried oregano over the dough. Break the mozzarella into pieces and distribute them over the pizza. Layer the mushrooms on top of the mozzarella. Tear each speck slice into two pieces and put each piece in a small heap on the pizza. Scatter the red onion and a pinch of sea salt on top.",
      "Bake the pizza for 5 to 7 minutes, until the crust is bubbling up and beginning to turn golden. The cooking time will vary depending on your oven and other factors (how much you've been opening the oven, for instance). Keep an eye on it. Then turn on the broiler and broil the pizza for 1 to 2 minutes, checking on it to make sure the cheese doesn't brown, until the crust is golden and just starting to char in a few places. If your oven doesn't have a broiler, just cook the pizza a minute or two longer, until the crust is nice and golden. Give it two grinds of black pepper, and serve."

If the sage pieces are very large at all, they will wrap themselves around the whisk attachment during mixing, clump together, and not incorporating into the marshmallow.

Stop stirring. Cook the sugar syrup until a candy thermometer registers 240\u00b0. Remove the pot from the heat and cool to 210\u00b0. Stir occasionally as the mixture cools to ensure an accurate temperature reading. If the mixture does not cool to 210\u00b0 before proceeding, the gelatin will not set properly.",

If you add the butter too fast, it won't incorporate and the marshmallow mixture may be sufficiently greased to fly right out of the bowl. Please go slowly.

Do the same with the galangal (1 minute), then the lime zest (1 minute), then the chiles (4 minutes), then the garlic (4 minutes), then the shallots (4 minutes), and finally, the shrimp paste (1 minute), fully pounding each ingredient before moving on to the next and stirring occasionally with a spoon. You'll have a smooth, slightly fibrous paste. Finally, pound the spice powder into the paste until it's well incorporated, about 30 seconds.",
      "You'll have about 9 tablespoons of paste. You can use it right away, or store the paste in the fridge for up to 1 week or in the freezer for up to 6 months. You'll need about 6 tablespoons of paste for 6 portions of curry.",

Cook, stirring occasionally, until the cream has reduced by about half and \"breaks\"-it'll look like curdled milk-anywhere from 3 to 10 minutes, depending on the brand of coconut cream. What you're doing as you simmer is cooking off the water in the cream so you're left with some white-ish solids but primarily the translucent fat, which you'll use to fry the curry paste. Patience is essential here. (If for some reason it doesn't crack after 10 minutes, add a tablespoon of vegetable oil, but know that the curry will be oilier than it should be.)",

Cook, stirring frequently, until garlic and shallots in the paste no longer smell raw and the paste has turned a shade or two darker, 6 to 8 minutes. Knowing when it's done takes experience, but as long as you're cooking it at a low sizzle, the curry will taste great.",
      "Add the palm sugar and cook, stirring often and breaking up the sugar once it softens, until the sugar has more or less fully melted, about 2 minutes. Add the remaining coconut cream, the coconut milk, and the fish balls. You'll notice that the curry is not even close to emerald green but rather a khaki color. That's what it's supposed to look like. Have a taste and consider adding, gradually, more of the curry paste.",
      "Increase the heat to high, bring the mixture to a simmer (don't let it boil), then decrease the heat to maintain a gentle simmer. Stem and quarter the eggplants, add them to the curry, and cook until they're tender but still crunchy, about 3 minutes.",

      "Cover the pot and let the curry sit for at least 10 minutes or up to an hour (either way, remove the basil sprigs after 10 minutes). It tastes best served slightly warmer than room temperature. The oil that rises to the surface is a good sign, not a bad one."

      "Whisk the salt and sugar with the 10 cups of tepid water in a large mixing bowl or pot until the sugar and salt fully dissolve. Combine the garlic, peppercorns, ginger, and lemongrass in a mortar and lightly pound to bruise and slightly crush them. Add them along with the cilantro and green onions to the brine, then add the birds breast side down. If they float, weigh them down with a plate. If the birds still aren't completely submerged, choose a different container. Cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or, even better, overnight.",
      "Remove the birds, discarding the brine, and sit them ass down in a colander to drain.",
      "Cut the lemongrass crosswise (tough parts, too) into rough 1/8-inch slices. Firmly pound it in a granite mortar until it's very fragrant, about 10 seconds. Add the garlic and pound to break it into small pieces (you're not making a paste), about 20 seconds. Add the salt and pepper, pound briefly, then add the cilantro stems and pound to bruise them, about 10 seconds more.",
      "Divide the stuffing equally among the birds' cavities, set the birds breast side up on a plate (or even better, a rack set over a tray) so there's some space between them. Tuck each wing tip under the body. Put the birds in the fridge, uncovered, to dry out for at least 4 hours or up to 12 hours.",
      "Stir the fish sauce, soy sauce, sugar, and pepper in a small bowl along with the 2 tablespoons of water until the sugar is fully dissolved. Brush the birds with the marinade, then put them back, uncovered, into the fridge for about 2 hours.",
      "Prepare a charcoal grill to cook at 350\u00b0F to 375\u00b0F. If your grill doesn't have a firebox, which allows for easy indirect cooking, push the coals to one side of the grill and form them into a mound. Add the birds, breasts up, to the grill rack opposite the charcoal, and cover the grill, opening the vents and rotating the grill cover if possible so the vents are directly over the birds. Positioning the open vents above the birds will pull the charcoal smoke toward them, giving them a little more smoky flavor. While you cook, you'll have to add more charcoal as necessary to maintain the temperature.",
      "Cook for 25 minutes, flip the birds over to get some color on the other side, and after about 5 minutes more, flip the birds over again.",
      "If you're not cooking on a grill with a firebox, carefully remove the birds and the grill grate. Spread out the coals so that instead of mound, they're lying in one or two layers, still on one side of the grill. Return the grate and the birds to the grill.",
      "Continue cooking, covered, with the birds on the side opposite the coals. After 5 minutes, brush the birds all over with the shallot oil and re-cover. After 5 minutes more, brush the birds all over with the honey mixture and move them so they're directly over the coals. Keep cooking, covered, turning over and rotating the birds as necessary to achieve even browning and brushing occasionally with the honey mixture, until the skin is a slightly glossy golden brown with some dark patches and the juices of the thigh run clear, 5 to 10 minutes more, depending on the size of the bird.",
      "Move the oven rack to the bottom third of the oven, and preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F. Put the birds breast side up on a baking tray (or even better, a rack set over a tray or roasting pan).",
      "Roast the birds for 30 minutes. Rotate the pan and brush the birds all over with the shallot oil. Cook for 5 minutes more, then brush the birds all over with the honey mixture. Crank up the heat to 400\u00b0F. Check on the birds every 5 minutes, brushing them with the honey mixture, until the skin is a slightly glossy golden brown with some darker patches and the juices run clear when you pierce the thickest part of the thigh, about 10 minutes more, depending on the size of the bird.",
      "Let the birds rest for at least 10 minutes or up to 30 minutes. Serve them whole or carved-it's up to you-with the dipping sauces. At Pok Pok, we halve the birds lengthwise, then remove the hindquarters and separate them into drumsticks and thighs, remove the wings, and chop the breast portions through the bone into two or three pieces."

    "directions": [
      "Put the ginger into a blender jar with 4 tablespoons of water and blend until it becomes smooth, about 1 minute. [This just doesn't work with my blender, but it doesn't seem to matter. I usually grate the ginger and whisk it with a little water to make a loose paste.]",
      "Cut off the thick, coarse stem of the cauliflower and remove all leaves. First break the cauliflower into large florets with your hands (if the head is loosely packed) or a knife (if it is tightly packed). Since you want to end up with small florets, not longer than 1 by 1 1/2 inches and not wider at the head than 1/2 to 1 inch, she recommends taking each large floret and beginning by slicing the stems crosswise into fairly thin rounds. Keep these, as they are quite edible. When you reach the upper end of the stem, start breaking off the small florets. Slice the stem into rounds whenever it seems too long, and keep the rounds. Wash the florets and rounds of stem in a colander and leave to drain.",
      "Heat the oil in a 12-inch skillet over medium heat. Add the ginger paste and turmeric. Fry, stirring constantly; after about 2 minutes, add green chili or cayenne and cilantro; after another 2 minutes, put in the cauliflower, continuing to cook and stir for 5 minutes. (If necessary, add 1 teaspoon warm water at a time to prevent sticking.) Now add the cumin, coriander, garam masala, lemon juice, salt, and 3 tablespoons warm water, cook and stir for about 5 minutes, then cover, lower the flame, and let cook slowly for 35-45 minutes (tightly packed cauliflower takes longer to cook), stirring gently every 10 minutes. The cauliflower is done when it is tender with just a faint trace of crispness along its inner spine.",
      "To serve: Lift out gently and place in serving dish-a low, wide bowl would be best. Serve with hot chapatis, pooris, or parathas, or serve with any kind of lentils and plain boiled rice. it is particularly good with Lamb Pullao and Cumcumber Raita."
