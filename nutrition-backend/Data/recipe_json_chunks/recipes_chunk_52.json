Dip each cutlet into buttermilk, then dredge each in another coating of flour, shaking off excess. (Reserve remaining gravy for making gravy.) Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add 2 of the steaks and cook until golden brown on both sides, about 4 to 5 minutes per side. Transfer to a serving platter. Repeat with remaining 2 steaks, adding remaining oil as needed. Stir remaining flour into skillet. Stir in broth, milk, salt and pepper with a wire whisk.
