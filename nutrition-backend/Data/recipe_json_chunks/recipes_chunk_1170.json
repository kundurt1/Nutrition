      "Heat a large soup pot on medium heat. Once the pot is hot, add olive oil. The pot should not be so hot that the oil smokes. Add chopped carrots and saute for a few minutes until slightly softened. Add diced onions, stir occasionally.",
      "If desired, while the vegetables saute in the pot, the ham steak may be grilled for 3-4 minutes on each side. This is not necessary, as the steak is already fully cooked, but grilling seems to improve the flavor and texture of the meat.",
      "When the onions are translucent, add the garlic and allow it to soften for a minute or two but don't let the garlic burn. Trim and dice the ham, removing as much of the fat as possible. Add the remaining ingredients to the pot and stir.",
      "Using a ladle, carefully remove about half of the soup mixture to a blender. With the lid firmly covering the blender, and with one hand on top of the blender to keep it secure, puree the soup mixture. Return the puree to the soup pot.",
      "Increase heat to medium high until soup gently boils, then reduce heat to simmer. Allow soup to simmer for about 20 minutes, uncovered, and stir occasionally. Do not add salt or other seasoning until after the soup has simmered. Much of the salt from the ham will simmer out and flavor the soup, so it is not necessary to add salt.",
      "Taste and adjust seasonings before serving. For a thicker soup, continue to simmer an additional 5-10 minutes, stirring occasionally. For a thinner soup, add a few ounces of water or chicken broth.",
      "To \"stretch\" this recipe and get an additional 1-2 servings, simply add one additional can of Navy beans and about 4-6 more ounces chicken broth (or water) at the appropriate step. Adjust seasoning to taste."

When cooked right, the hard outer shell peels off practically by itself!Sugar pumpkins (the small pumpkins the size of a volleyball) are recommended, but we have used jack-o-lantern sized pumpkins, and even giant 50-100 pound pumpkins, with good results. In general, the smaller the pumpkin, the sweeter the meat. You may need to add more honey with a larger pumpkin (taste before baking). Use fresh pumpkins, not carved pumpkins. Any pulp not used immediately in recipes can be stored for up to 2 days in the refridgerator, or can be stored in the freezer indefinitely. If you store in the freezer, place a 1 cup portion in a plastic bag - this is the amount required by most recipes.",
      "Directions:Cut pumpkin in halves (or quarters, if large). Scoop out pulp and seeds. (Seeds can be saved later for roasting.) Lightly oil inside meat of pumpkin. Cover meat side of pumpkin with foil. Place foil-side down on cookie sheet. Bake at 400 degrees for 1 1/2 hours, or until meat is soft throughout. Allow to cool until you can handle with your hands. Scrape pulp from rind and place in blender. Puree until consistent throughout. Line colander with coffee filters. Place puree in colander and allow to drain 2-3 hours, or overnight in fridge."

At first, after you add all the eggs, it will look kind of worrisome, like tiny curdles and you've ruined it. Don't worry! Keep mixing!
