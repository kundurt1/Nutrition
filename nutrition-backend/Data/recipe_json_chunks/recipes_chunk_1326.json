Mix by hand for ten to fifteen minutes (three to five with a Kitchen Aid using the paddle on medium speed) until the dough forms a smooth paste. It should still be sticky and stretchy, but not very wet. If you're using a machine; switch to the dough hook and mix for another five minutes on medium; if you're manual, turn the dough out on a floured surface and knead the hell out of it for seven minutes.",

Make sure to spread evenly all the way to the edges. Apply the dill and the cheese in a similar fashion; evenly distribute all the way to the corners of your dough sheet.",

Use a sharp knife and slice rolls off of the left side of the log. You can make them as thick as you'd like; we like ours about two inches thick.",

      "10. When thirty minutes-minimum!-has elapsed, slide the rolls into the oven and bake for fifteen to twenty minutes. When they start to smell amazing, check them. You're looking for a nice golden brown hue on the top of each one."

Alternatively, thinly slice the radishes with a knife. Stack the circles on top of each other and slice straight down to get mini matchsticks.",

I added the juice of another lemon, but my lemons were on the small side. I also added more crushed red pepper flakes - I think a bit of heat is really nice in this salad."

Season the thick sections a little more heavily than the skinny ankles and wings. Sprinkle a little of the salt just inside the cavity, on the backbone, but don't otherwise worry about seasoning the inside. Twist and tuck the wing tips behind the shoulders. Cover loosely and refrigerate.",

Carve off all of the bottom crust and most of the top and side crust (reserve the top and side crusts to use as croutons in salads or soups). Brush the bread all over with olive oil. Broil very briefly, to crisp and lightly color the surface. Turn the bread chunks over and crisp the other side. Trim off any badly charred tips, then tear the chunks into a combination of irregular 2- to 3-inch wads, bite-sized bits, and fat crumbs. You should get about 4 cups.",

Toss about 1/4 cup of this tart vinaigrette with the torn bread in a wide salad bowl; the bread will be unevenly dressed. Taste one of the more saturated pieces. If it is bland, add a little salt and pepper and toss again. Place the currants in a small bowl and moisten with the red wine vinegar and warm water. Set aside.",
      "Preheat the oven to 475\u00b0F. (Depending on the size, efficiency, and accuracy of your oven, and the size of your bird, you may need to adjust the heat to as high as 500\u00b0F or as low as 450\u00b0F during the course of roasting the chicken to get it to brown properly. If that proves to be the case, begin at that temperature the next time you roast a chicken. If you have a convection function on your oven, use it for the first 30 minutes; it will enhance browning, and may reduce overall cooking time by 5 to 10 minutes.)",
      "Choose a shallow flameproof roasting pan or dish barely larger than the chicken, or use a 10-inch skillet with an all-metal handle. Preheat the pan over medium heat. Wipe the chicken dry and set it breast side up in the pan. It should sizzle. Place in the center of the oven and listen and watch for it to start sizzling and browning within 20 minutes. If it doesn't, raise the temperature progressively until it does. The skin should blister, but if the chicken begins to char, or the fat is smoking, reduce the temperature by 25 degrees. After about 30 minutes, turn the bird over (drying the bird and preheating the pan should keep the skin from sticking). Roast for another 10 to 20 minutes, depending on size, then flip back over to recrisp the breast skin, another 5 to 10 minutes. Total oven time will be 45 minutes to an hour.",
      "While the chicken is roasting, place the pine nuts in a small baking dish and set in the hot oven for a minute or two, just to warm through. Add them to the bowl of bread.",

Scrape into the bread and fold to combine. Drain the plumped currants and fold in. Dribble the chicken stock or lightly salted water over the salad and fold again. Taste a few pieces of bread-a fairly saturated one and a dryish one. If it is bland, add salt, pepper, and/or a few drops of vinegar, then toss well. Since the basic character of bread salad depends on the bread you use, these adjustments can be essential. Pile the bread salad in a 1-quart baking dish and tent with foil; set the salad bowl aside. Place the salad in the oven after you flip the chicken the final time.",
      "Remove the chicken from the oven and turn off the heat. Leave the bread salad to continue warming for another 5 minutes or so. Lift the chicken from the roasting pan and set on a plate. Carefully pour the clear fat from the roasting pan, leaving the lean drippings behind. Add about a tablespoon of water to the hot pan and swirl it. Slash the stretched skin between the thighs and breasts of the chicken, then tilt the bird and plate over the roasting pan to drain the juice into the drippings. Set the chicken in a warm spot (which may be your stovetop), and leave to rest while you finish the bread salad. The meat will become more tender and uniformly succulent as it cools.",
      "Set a platter in the oven to warm for a minute or two. Tilt the roasting pan and skim the last of the fat. Place over medium-low heat, add any juice that has collected under the chicken, and bring to a simmer. Stir and scrape to soften any hard golden drippings. Taste-the juices will be extremely flavorful.",
      "Tip the bread salad into the salad bowl. (It will be steamy-hot, a mixture of soft, moist wads, crispy-on-the-outside-but-moist-in-the-middle wads, and a few downright crispy ones.) Drizzle and toss with a spoonful of the pan juices. Add the greens, a drizzle of vinaigrette, and fold well. Taste again.",

Meanwhile, put the salad leaves onto a serving platter or into a large bowl. Quickly tear in some mint and tarragon leaves, and add a large handful of whole or halved grapes. When the pancetta is nice and crispy, take the pan off the heat. Toss the salad together and put on a platter. Crumble over the crispy pancetta, and sprinkle the fennel seeds on top.",
      "Make the dressing. Pour 1/4 cup of extra virgin olive oil and 2 tablespoons of balsamic vinegar into a small pitcher or screw-top jar. Add a pinch of salt & pepper and squeeze in the juice of 1/2 lemon, then take to the table with the salad so you can dress it right before tucking in.",
      "Stack the lasagne sheets on a chopping board and carefully slice them into fairly thin strips - do this in batches. Add to the pan of boiling water with a good pinch of salt. Stir, then put the lid on slightly askew and keep it at a hard boil for just 1 1/2 minutes.",

      "This pasta must be eaten ASAP to be enjoyed properly, so call everyone around the table now. I like to use tongs to move the pasta to the egg mixture, because the cooking water that comes with it is what really makes the sauce incredible. If you find that tricky, just drain the pasta in a colander, but save the water. Toss the pasta and sauce together quickly, then add 2 or 3 more spoonfuls of cooking water to make it silkier if needed. Fresh pasta is constantly sucking up water so make it slightly looser than it needs to be and it will be perfect at the table. Have a taste. Does it need more salt or Parmesan to balance the lemon juice? If so, adjust then sprinkle over the reserved basil leaves and grate over some extra Parmesan. Take to the table, quickly dress the salad, and eat right away."

The tartness is important to balance the the strong spices in this recipe, which will soften and meld together as they cook. My grandmother Rose used Rome apples, a traditional \"baking apple,\" but I find that it can get mushy. Macintoshes and red or yellow delicious apples will quickly turn to applesauce when cooked, so I'd save those for out-of-hand eating."

      "Warm oven to 375\u00b0. Using flour only to keep dough from sticking, work dough into a pizza crust shape. It should be about 12\" across. Lightly sprinkle pizza pan or cookie sheet with corn meal, then gently lay crust on it. It is recommended to parbake the crust for up to 10 minutes, though this step can be omitted- it depends on the dough. Monitor dough for bubbling, and pierce to remove the bubble. After removing crust from oven, spread the refried beans evenly, leaving no more than 1/2\" border on the crust. Sprinke on mozzarella cheese, then cilantro. Next sprinkle on cheddar, black beans, and tomatoes. Add green chiles to taste. Return pizza to upper-middle area of oven for 10-20 minutes. Watch for cheese to melt and crust to turn light golden brown (watch bottom of crust as well). Alow to cool for 5 minutes, then cut and serve."

      "3. Beat the butter in the bowl of a eavy-duty standing mixer fitted with the paddle blade on medium-high speed until smooth, about 1 inute. On low speed, beat in the confectioners' sugar. Return the speed to medium-high and beat until light in color and texture, about 2 minutes. Beat in the egg yolks, one at a time, scraping down the sides of the bowl. Beat in the chocolate and vanilla.",

Remove the sides of the pan, and invert the cake onto the rack. Remove the paper and reinvert on another rack to turn right side up. Cool completely.",

Brush the top of the cake layer with the apricot glaze. Place the second cake layer on top and brush again. Brush the top and sides of the cake with the remaining glaze. Transfer the cake to a wire rack placed over a jelly-roll pan lined with waxed paper. Let cool until the glaze is set.",

Using a metal offset spatula, gently smooth the glaze over the cake, allowing it to run down the sides, being sure that the glaze completely coats the cake (patch any bare spots with the spatula and the icing that has dripped). Cool until the glaze is barely set, then transfer the cake to a serving plate. Refrigerate until the glaze is completely set, at least 1 hour. Remove the cake from the refrigerator about 1 hour before serving.",

      "Place the cashews, garlic, lemon, sea salt, and pepper in a food processor or high speed blender. Process until the mixture is a thick paste. With the motor running, drizzle in water till the mixture is the texture of light, fluffy ricotta. It may not take much water at all, depending on how much water the cashews absorbed! Season to taste, and then pulse in the sun dried tomatoes, herbes de provence, and the basil. To prep the collards: you can either a) blanch them in boiling water for one minute each, then submerge in cool water and pat down with paper towels, or you can b) marinate them for 3-4 hours in a mixture of 1 tbsp olive oil, 2 tbsp fresh lemon juice, and a pinch of sea salt, wiping the marinade off before you get to wrapping. If you don't mind the taste of raw collards, you can skip this step! Trim down the inner spine of the collard leaves, per column instructions: http://www.food52.com/articles/4484_thinking_outside_the_wrap. Spread them with 1/4 the cashew mixture each, and then top that with 1/4 of the red peppers and arugula, if using. Wrap them up, slice, and serve!"
