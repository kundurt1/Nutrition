      "Grease a marble slab or piece of parchment paper with olive oil (marble is ideal, as it's heavy and won't move. Parchment, on the other hand, tends to slide-pull yourself a generous-sized piece and dampen the flat surface, such as kitchen counter, with a wet hand before placing the parchment down; this will help keep it in place).",
      "Place the sugar in a wide, flat skillet in an even layer and turn the heat on low. Watch it carefully but don't touch it or stir it. As soon as it starts to melt, you can help it along with a gentle shake of the pan here and there, paying close attention that it doesn't become too dark (which means it will taste too bitter). It should be a medium or dark amber color, like maple syrup or a little darker, but it shouldn't go dark enough that it begins to look black!",
      "When it begins to melt and you can see the caramel forming around the edges, you can give it a gentle stir with a wooden spoon to help it along. As soon as it has liquified completely and it is dark amber in color, tip in the almonds. The almonds will cool down the caramel and make it harder to work with (smaller nuts such as pine nuts or seeds such as sesame seeds are decidedly easier to work with), but don't lose focus! Keep it over the low heat and mix to combine until all the almonds are coated, then tip it out onto your prepared surface.",
      "Now work quickly. I find the easiest way to flatten the top and reach the desired height (it should be the thickness of about 1/2 inch) is to place another oiled sheet of parchment face down on the top of the almond mixture and use a rolling pin to roll it to the right height. When doing this with smaller nuts, it's easy enough just to use the pressure in your hands (dampened with water) or a lemon half to push it out to the right size and height. If using the parchment and rolling pin, once you have reached the desired height, you can now rub the lemon half over the surface to add shine and a touch of flavor and to even out the brittle along the way. Let cool slightly. While the brittle is still warm, cut into pieces to serve (I find a large, heavy kitchen knife to be the best for this task). I like large bars for giving away as gifts, or small squares for serving with coffee at the end of a meal.",
      "This makes a great edible gift: Wrap pieces individually in cellophane or parchment paper and tie with string. Keep any leftovers in an airtight container (preferably separated in layers with parchment paper to avoid sticking) and store in a cool, dark, dry place. Note that if you live in a warm, humid climate you might find this torrone is always a little bit sticky-nothing wrong with this (licking fingers is always a good thing if you ask me)."

    "title": "cocunut mango icecream/frozen yogurt with salted ginger caramel",
    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "For the the ice cream cut the mangoes from the peel and the seed and add into a food processor or blender with the Greek yogurt, coconut milk and vanilla. Put in a container and chill for at least an hour. Prepare your ice cream maker and add the mixture to your ice cream maker.",
      "While the ice cream is churning, eat sugar on moderately high heat in a heavy-bottomed 2-quart or 3-quart saucepan. As the sugar begins to melt, stir vigorously with a whisk or wooden spoon. As soon as the sugar comes to a boil, stop stirring. You can swirl the pan a bit if you want, from this point on. Note that this recipe works best if you are using a thick-bottomed pan. If you find that you end up burning some of the sugar before the rest of it is melted, the next time you attempt it, add a half cup of water to the sugar at the beginning of the process, this will help the sugar to cook more evenly, though it will take longer as the water will need to evaporate before the sugar will caramelize. s soon as all of the sugar crystals have melted (the liquid sugar should be dark amber in color), immediately add the butter to the pan. Whisk until the butter has melted. Once the butter has melted, take the pan off the heat. Count to three, then slowly add the cream to the pan and continue to whisk to incorporate. Note than when you add the butter and the cream, the mixture will foam up considerably. This is why you must use a pan that is at least 2-quarts (preferably 3-quarts) big. Whisk until caramel sauce is smooth. Let cool in the pan for a couple minutes, then pour into a glass mason jar and let sit to cool to room temperature. (Remember to use pot holders when handling the jar filled with hot caramel sauce.) Store in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks. Warm before serving.",
      "You can also top this ice cream with home made or store bought candied ginger. To make candied ginger, 1 pound fresh ginger root\r\n 5 cups water\r\n Approximately 1 pound granulated sugar\r\n\r\nDirections\r\n\r\nSpray a cooling rack with nonstick spray and set it in a half sheet pan lined with parchment.\r\n\r\nPeel the ginger root and slice into 1/8-inch thick slices using a mandoline. Place into a 4-quart saucepan with the water and set over medium-high heat. Cover and cook for 35 minutes or until the ginger is tender.\r\n\r\nTransfer the ginger to a colander to drain, reserving 1/4 cup of the cooking liquid. Weigh the ginger and measure out an equal amount of sugar. Return the ginger and 1/4 cup water to the pan and add the sugar. Set over medium-high heat and bring to a boil, stirring frequently. Reduce the heat to medium and cook, stirring frequently, until the sugar syrup looks dry, has almost evaporated and begins to recrystallize, approximately 20 minutes. Transfer the ginger immediately to the cooling rack and spread to separate the individual pieces"

Add the onions and garlic to the pan and saute a bit. Add the rest of the ingredients, plus the chicken, to the Dutch oven and bring to a boil. Erstwhile, heat your oven to a happy 250 degrees F. Put the pot in the oven and forgetaboutit. Check in about three hours. Is it ready to shred? Trust your judgment. It can hang in the oven longer. Follow the rest of the instructions. Easy peasy.",

Continue to stir gently until the dough starts to form into a ball. Now, using your hands, knead the dough and incorporate any remaining flour. Knead the dough a few times to make a ball. The dough should feel slightly tacky but not damp. It should not stick to your fingers.",

Shape each piece of dough roughly into a rectangle. (If you start with a rectangular shape, you are more likely to roll out a rectangular sheet.)",

The rolled-out dough will be about 18 inches long by 7 to 8 inches wide. Dust your work surface and the dough generously with our as you go.",

Fold the rectangle of dough in half lengthwise, so that you join short edge to short edge. Dust the dough with our and fold that in half again. Turn the dough so that the folds are facing you. Using a sharp knife, cut noodles that are about 1/4 inch in width. Dust the cut noodles with our and use your hands to unfurl the strands. Place the noodles in a loose bundle on the prepared baking sheet. Repeat with each of the remaining sections of dough. (To cook the noodles later, see note.)",

When the water begins to bubble up, add about 1/2 cup of the cold water to keep the noodles at a manageable simmer. Add additional cold water as needed. Test a noodle. It should be cooked through but still have a tiny bit of chew. Drain and use immediately.",
      "If you aren't using the noodles immediately, you can \"shock\" them under running cold tap water to cool them and keep them from becoming a giant noodle brick. When ready to serve, dip the noodles in hot, simmering water for about 1 minute to bring them back to temperature.",

Cook covered over lowest heat for 60 minutes, but stir every now and then since you don't want the bottom to scorch. I find that the okras are more flavorful if \"slow cooked\" to a soft texture because somehow they get to better absorb the flavors of the other ingredients. Add the sesame oil and heavy cream around the last 15 minutes. Sprinkle chopped parsley on top of dish. But you can choose other toppings like cilantro, basil, or even crumbled crispy bacon, feta, or queso fresco. Drizzle a bit more honey right before serving.

      "Bake in the oven for 30-40 minutes. Once the squash has cooled off, put it into a bowl where you can slightly mash the squash, leaving most of them cubed and intact. You want a chunky squash rather than a completely pureed mixture as the chunks hold moisture better and will keep the filling from drying out as it cooks. This will be especially true if you bake instead of fry them.",
      "Place the frying oil into a heavy pot narrow enough for the oil to be at least 3? deep. Heat the oil until it reaches and stays between 350\u00b0 and 400\u00b0 while you're frying the cigars.",
      "Have 1-2 wet and squeezed out paper towels at the ready. Place the melted butter next to you for ease of work. Gently take 4-5 sheets and with the widest side facing you, using a sharp knife cut 4 long strips of dough, stacking them one on top of one another as you go. Completely cover all the cut strips with the wet paper towels as you work with one strip at a time.",
      "Butter the strip and place 1 heaping tablespoon of butternut squash close to the short straight edge closest to you, leaving some room on the sides. If you have a strip that has torn in half on one side, flip that side closer to you, so the tear ends up folding in as you roll the cigar. You can also slightly overlap the torn pieces before you put the filling in. Once you've placed the squash filling in, fold the short edge over the squash and start rolling toward the other end. Early on, about 1/4 of the way down the strip, fold in 1/16? of the outer left and right sides of the strip, so while you roll the cigar it remains straight and the edges are tucked in. Keep filling each cigar and stack them on the side before you fry them.",
      "Once your oil is heated to the right temperature, drop in 3-4 cigars at once, without overcrowding the pot. Don't worry if the edges of the cigar unfurl a little as they fry. Once they cool off, you can flake off some of this excess. Use tongs to roll the cigars over so they turn brown and golden on all sides. You'll want to fry them for no longer than a minutes on each side, but this will depend on how hot the oil is. Spread the cigars on paper towels to drain. Serve warm.",
      "*If you wanted to skip the frying and bake them instead, prepare them as you would up until the cooking time, then place them on an oiled or nonstick cookie sheet and bake them for 15-20 minutes in a 350\u00b0 oven. If you bake these ahead and store them in the refrigerator, they will become limpy and moist. However, you can bring them back to their crispy golden life by reheating them for 10 minutes at 300\u00b0."

Even as I'm sitting here writing, I'm thinking I need to go back to the grocery store one last time before fresh corn is gone and make this again! Simply lovely, and a definite crowd pleaser."

    "ingredients": [],

      "The pasta recipe can be adjusted as you see fit: measure your moist ingredients into a liquid measuring cup. You should have 7oz total. If you have less, you can add moisture by adding more egg or some cold water. As long as your mixture of moist ingredients includes 2 tablespoons of olive oil, a couple eggs, and totals 7oz, it should turn out well. Put all the ingredients in a food processor, pulse until just combined. Turn out onto a floured surface and knead a few times until the dough is smooth. Wrap with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least a half hour.",
      "While the pasta dough rests, prep the hazelnuts. If you can find skinned hazelnuts, you are in luck! If you can't, here's how to skin them: bring a pot of water to a boil, add the hazelnuts, and add 3 tablespoons baking soda. The water will bubble dramatically and turn an ominous shade of black. Let boil for 2 minutes while you prepare an ice bath. Drain the hazelnuts and plunge into the ice bath. Then, drain them and tip them onto a clean dishcloth. Rub them vigorously with the dishcloth. Most of the skins will rub off easily. A few stubborn nuts will demand individual attention.",
      "After the hazelnuts are skinned, heat the oven to 300 degrees and roast the hazelnuts for 30-35 minutes, until they take on a nice golden color. Keep an eye on them: they might take longer or shorter. After they are done, let cool slightly and then, using food processor, pulse until you have a nice mix of larger crumbs and some finer powder. The mix of sizes is good.",
      "While the nuts roast, return to the pasta: divide the dough into four pieces, keeping the pieces you aren't working with covered. Have flour on hand: as you work the pasta, dust with a little flour anytime the pasta begins to seem sticky. Flatten each quarter into a small round, and send through your pasta maker, set to 0. Fold in half, and repeat. Turn the pasta machine to 1; fold the dough in thirds, and send through; refold and repeat, 6 times, so that the pasta is well kneaded. Always send the fatter side through first to keep the dough roughly even.",
      "Now the really fun part: set the machine to 3 and send the dough through unfolded. Dust with flour, set the machine to 5, send through; continue this way, skipping numbers, until you get to 7 or 8, depending on how thin you prefer your pasta.",
      "Once rolled out to the desired thinness, dust with flour and fold in half, and then in quarters. Using a sharp knife, cut the long way into wide pappadelle noodles. There might be some irregularities: it is okay. Unfold the pasta and either hang the noodles, or make small nests. Be sure to keep everything well dusted with flour so that things do not stick. Repeat with each piece of the dough.",
      "Bring a large pot of generously salted water to a boil. In a medium-sized saucepan (large enough to hold all of the pasta eventually), heat the olive oil and add the chopped hazelnuts and a large pinch of salt, a little freshly ground pepper, and cook for two or so minutes, until the nuts are fragrant. Be careful not to burn them. Add the cream and lower the heat and simmer until it thickens, stirring frequently. When it begins to thicken, add the fresh thyme.",
      "Meanwhile, cook the fresh pasta. It will cook extremely quickly-around 3 minutes. Drain the pasta, add it to the saucepan, and toss everything to combine and coat the noodles. Plate the pasta individually and sprinkle fresh grated parmesan cheese on each plate and some fresh ground black pepper."

      "Make the vinaigrette: Pound the garlic cloves into a paste in a mortar with the pestle. Add the anchovies and pound until everything is fairly smooth but still slightly chunky. Add the vinegar, olive oil, and cracked black pepper to taste and mix to combine. The idea is to get a broken vinaigrette with pieces of anchovy still visible.",
      "Make the granola: Preheat the oven to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C). Put the bread cubes on a baking sheet and toss with a few teaspoons of olive oil and a pinch of salt, then spread them out. Spread the nuts out on a separate baking sheet. Toast the bread and walnuts in the oven, tossing them every few minutes. Remove the nuts once they are dark and well toasted, about 8 minutes. Remove the bread once it's dark brown and toasted all the way through, about 10 minutes. While the nuts are still warm, put them in a mortar, add a teaspoon of olive oil, a pinch of salt, a few generous cranks of black pepper, and a pinch of chile flakes and crush them into coarse chunks with the pestle. Using the bottom of a heavy pan, crush the bread cubes into chunks between 1/4 and 1/2 inch. (With each component, you want a mix of textures and sizes.) Combine the croutons, walnuts, and cheeses in a medium bowl. Dress with the vinaigrette, mixing well. Let sit while you prepare the endives so the croutons get a little softer and the flavors come together.",
      "Prepare the endives: Cut an inch off the bottom of each endive and discard. Gently peel back the leaves, continuing to trim the root as you go, until you get to the core (it's the sweetest part of the endive). Cut each core in half lengthwise, or into quarters if it's large, and toss them into the bowl.",
      "To serve, season the endives with a generous pinch of salt. Grate the zest of the orange evenly over the top of the endives, then halve the orange and squeeze the juice over the leaves. Add the vinegar and gently toss the leaves to coat, as you don't want them to bruise.",
      "Spread the granola mixture evenly on two plates. Arrange the endive leaves on top so that they make little cups for the dressing. Sprinkle with salt, spoon on the orange juice mixture left in the bottom of the bowl, and drizzle on a bit of olive oil."

      "For the Kimchi you will first need to sterlilise a large kilner jar with a lid. Make sure it is rinsed thoroughly to remove all traces of steriliser. You can also steam the jar if you so wish. \r\n\r\nTake the chinese lettuce (cabbage) and tear the leaves then wash thoroughly. Sprinkle some salt onto the cabbage and leave it to sit for a while. Massage the cabbage until the natural juices begin to appear. \r\n\r\nUsing a pessle and mortar crush the finely chopped red pepper, 1 red chilli, garlic clove, spring onion, and once all nicely crushed add the agave to make a seasoning. With very clean hands mix the seasoning in with the cabbage. Once a good amount of brine has been released add the rest of your bell pepper, carrots, purple cabbage, cauliflower and any other suitable vegetables for pickling. Transfer the kimchi mix to your jar and push it down well. Kimchi is anaerobic so it's important that the vegetables are under the surface of the brine and not poking above. Seal with a lid and leave on kitchen surface. After a day release the lid and BURP the kimchi. Put lid back on and then repeat following day. You will start to see bubbles appear that is normal. After two days transfer to fridge and leave for a week or a few days as you wish. It is now ready to use.",
      "To use your kimchi as a flavouring add a 1/2 cup to 1 cup of soaked cashew nuts and in a mini food prep mix it up nicely. You can also add another spring onion, some nutritional yeast, 1 teaspoon of sesame oil, a teaspoon of agave, and a splash of tamari. \r\n\r\nTo Assemble\r\n\r\nCut your rice wrappers into 4 squares and using a paint brush paint them one side with water and quickly flip over. Paint with the food dye (optional). Add a teaspoon of the filling to the center of the square and squeeze two corners together, then fold the other sides up and squeeze into a dumpling shape - be patient it will work in time and takes a little practise. \r\n\r\nServe with Tamari dipping sauce and a splash of ginger juice or a dipping sauce of your choice."

Put them on a baking tray in the oven, and set a timer for 30 minutes so you can check them for doneness. You're looking for them to be soft, as they will be added to the risotto at the very end. The reason for this is that, if cooked with the rice, they would bread down completely.",

      "Add the rice, stirring to make sure all the grains get toasted against the hot pot. When you feel good about this, add the wine. Stir.",
      "Here is where this recipe differs from a traditional risotto: once you've added the wine and let that bubble away, you can begin to add the broth in much larger amounts than with a traditional risotto. And, because the brown rice takes at least an hour to cook, if you make sure it's completely covered by the broth, you can leave it bubbling on a low heat and walk away.",

Then, I gave the rice a stir, added more broth, and grated my cheese. Gave the rice a stir, picked more thyme off it's stems, and watched some TV. I was worried that the rice wouldn't get starchy/creamy enough, but when I began treating it like a risotto in the last quarter of it's cooking time--by which I mean, stirring constantly for the last 20 minutes it was on the stove--that seemed to be enough attention to make it nice and creamy.",

      "Kitchen Notes:\r\n Mango jam is widely available in supermarkets these days and you can also find it online; Goya makes a tasty, easy to find version.\r\n Coconut cream is made from the flesh of coconuts. It is very fatty and rich, with a texture similar to thick whipped cream. It's typically used in tropical cuisines, but kosher cooks and others who rely on dairy-free cooking use it as an alternative to regular cream. Coconut cream is used in recipes from curries to baked goods. It can be purchased at most major supermarkets, Asian specialty stores, or online. Coconut cream should not be confused with cream of coconut, the canned, sweetened product that is used in cocktails and also in baked goods.\r\n To bruise cardamom place the pods on a cutting board. Using the flat side of a large chef's knife, (being careful not to have the blade face you), press on the pods very gently so that they just crack without releasing their seeds.\r\n If you would like to make these pareve, you can substitute an equal amount of nonhydrogenated margarine for the butter.\r\n Toasted shredded coconut is available in stores, but it's easy to do yourself. Preheat the oven to 375\u00b0F. Scatter the coconut evenly on a rimmed baking sheet and bake, mixing every 3 minutes and watching carefully to make sure that it does not burn, for a total of about 9 minutes, or until lightly browned. Note that sweetened coconut will toast a little faster than unsweetened, so adjust the timing accordingly."

      "When you are ready to fry, add peanut oil to a large, deep cast iron pot (such as a French oven) and turn to medium. The oil should come up about 1 1/2 to 2 inches high on the sides, so you may need more or less than 1 cup of oil depending on your frying vessel. Place a deep-fry thermometer in the pot and bring oil to between 350 and 375 degrees F.",

      "When the oil is ready, add half the wings and immediately turn the heat up high to compensate for the temperature drop. Once the oil returns to around 350F, dial the heat back down. The main goal is to try to keep the temperature as close to 350 as you can. If you have the temperature at around 350 (and you fry relatively small batches -- I fried 10 at a time), each batch of wings should take 6-8 minutes to cook through and get golden brown. Using tongs, remove each piece and set on the rack to drain and cool. Check your oil temperature and fry the second batch using the same method.",
      "Now make your sauce. In a wide skillet (nonstick is nice here) heated to medium, add 3 tablespoons of the frying oil. (Feel free to use fresh oil if you prefer.) Saute the garlic and ginger until translucent, slightly golden and aromatic. Add 2 tablespoons of water and 3 tablespoons granulated sugar. Stir to combine and cook until the sugar melts and the sauce becomes foamy and glossy, about 2-3 minutes. Add 2 tablespoons fish sauce and cook an additional 2-3 minutes. The glaze should be slightly thickened by now. Finally, add 1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon of sambal oelek. Taste and add additional sambal oelek, if desired. Give the sauce a last stir to combine and add all the chicken pieces back to the skillet. Turn the pieces several times to coat with the glaze.",

      "Notes on how to measure:\r\nfor every 500g chestnuts, use 1 tbsp baking soda; 60% sugar of total weight peeled chestnuts; a good splash of preferred optional additions.",
      "Place chestnuts in a bowl and cover with boiling water. Let steep for 30 minutes. This step helps peel the hard shell.",
      "Carefully peel the hard skin, leaving soft skin in tact. The more soft skin is broken and the nut exposed, the more fragile they become as they braise and may fall apart.",
      "Place peeled chestnuts in a bowl or the wide bottom pot you'll use to simmer, cover with cold water mixed with baking soda. Let it steep for 8 hours/overnight. This step offsets the bitterness in the skin.",
      "Transfer the chestnuts with its soaking water to a pot if still in bowl. Simmer for 30 minutes. This is the first cleanse. Skin foam during simmering process. The water will be dark and bitter. Drain. Renew water. Do this a total of three times. The water from the third cleanse should be the color of light red wine.",
      "After the last drain, gently remove any big veins and skim off patches of fury bits left on the soft skin. You're not removing the soft skin, just tidying it up. The pointed end of a skewer helps this task along.",
      "Just barely cover the chestnuts with clean water. Add your 60% of sugar. Simmer until all the sugar is dissolved. Right before switching off the heat, add your splash of preferred aroma. Or omit altogether. I added a generous splash of cognac.",
      "Spoon into a clean jar, cover with soaking syrup and let cool completely before storing in fridge. I placed thin lemon slices inside the jar to infuse as it ages.",
      "Though it can be consumed right away, the real treat lies in the several-months wait. Try it on the first day and every few days after that; take pleasure in notes that change over time. The longer they sit it the syrup, the stickier, gooier and chewier they transform. It's a good thing."

      "First you'll need to smoke the cream. To do that, pour the cream (or half & half) in a shallow dish set in a pan of ice and place that in the BBQ. If it's summer, I smoke overnight when it is cooler outside. I use the A-Maze-N smoker, filled with the wood chips of choice, light, and close the BBQ lid to contain all the smokey goodness. Come back in the morning and poof! Smoked cream.\r\n\r\nCombine the smoked cream and 1/4 cup sugar in a small saucepan. Heat, stirring occasionally, until steam arises from the milk. Remove from the heat.\r\nUsing an electric mixer, beat 1/4 cup sugar with the egg yolks until the mixture is light yellow and thick, about four minutes.\r\nBeat 1/2 cup hot cream into the egg mixture, then gradually stir this mixture into the saucepan with the remaining cream. Cook over medium-low heat, stirring almost constantly, until the mixture reaches 175\u00b0 to 180\u00b0 degrees or is slightly thickened. Do not boil or you'll have scrambled eggs and while they're good with bacon too, they're really nothing like ice cream. There will be a thick coating on the back of a spoon that will hold the outline of your finger after you pass it through.\r\nStir in the remaining milk and vanilla extract. Chill to 40\u00b0. If you're the impatient type you can speed this up by setting the bowl in a large bowl filled with a mixture of ice and water and give it a stir every now and then.\r\nChurn chilled mixture in an ice cream maker according to the manufacturer's directions. Meanwhile make the stir ins.",
      "For the candied bacon, preheat oven to 350\u00b0F. Mix 1/2 cup brown sugar and cinnamon on a plate and then coat each slice of bacon with the mixture. Cover the bottom of a rimmed baking pan with foil (you'll be glad you did when it comes to clean up) and place a cooling rack on top of that. Spray with non-stick cooking spray and place the coated bacon strips on top. Bake 15 to 20 minutes until bacon begins to caramelized and crisp up, watching carefully as there's a fine line between done and the sugar starting to burn. Cool, cut into pieces and try not to eat all of it before the ice cream is done.\r\n\r\nFor the pecans, melt butter in a skillet and mixed in 1/4 cup brown sugar. Toss that with pecans and let cool on parchment paper in a single layer. Chop coarsely.\r\n\r\nWhen the ice cream maker has done it's job, move the ice cream to a storage container, stir in the bacon and pecans and then place in the freezer to harden up.\r\n\r\nBreak out the spoons and get ready to rake in the compliments. Yup... definitely another thing that is better with bacon."

      "Use a spice grinder or mortar and pestle to grind aniseed or fennel seeds. They don't have to be a fine powder, but the seeds should be cracked open and fairly pulverized.",
      "Whisk the flour, salt, and a few pinches of ground aniseed or fennel seeds together in a large bowl. In a small bowl, combine warm water, olive oil, extracts, if adding (see flavor variations, below), and yeast and whisk until yeast dissolves. Combine the oil mixture with the flour mixture, then knead with the heel of your hand-inside the bowl is fine, if there's room-for about five minutes. Alternatively, you can use the dough hook of an electric mixer if that's more your speed.",
      "If it's chilly in the kitchen, heat the oven to 200\u00b0 F for the duration of kneading time, then turn it off. Cover the bowl containing dough with a dish towel and place it in the warm oven with the door open, or find another warm space. Let it sit for 30 minutes, until doubled in size.",
      "Preheat the oven to 400\u00b0 F, line a baking sheet with parchment paper, and lightly dust a work surface with flour. Pinch off pieces of dough to form mounds about the size of golf balls. Use a rolling pin to roll out each ball into a flat round, about 6 inches in diameter. Rounds should be very thin and fairly-but not very-translucent. If the dough resists being rolled flat, the gluten simply needs to relax a little. Move onto the next ball and then try again.",
      "Place no more than 4 tortas on the baking sheet at a time. Brush each cracker with egg white, then sprinkle with a mixture of sugar and aniseed. If making savory crackers, omit the sugar. If adding extra flavors, sprinkle them on now. Note: If doing a chocolate drizzle/dip, save that for baked crackers.",
      "Bake for 6 to 10 minutes, depending on how large and thick crackers are. They can burn within that last 30 seconds, so be cautious. Start with 6 minutes, check the crackers, and rotate the pan. Continue baking at 1-minute intervals until the tortas are golden brown. Remove from the oven and transfer to a wire wrack to cool.",
      "Enjoy the crackers warm, or let cool completely, then wrap individually in waxed paper. Place wrapped crackers in a large zip-top bag. They'll keep for about 5 days.",
      "Flavor variations:\r\n\r\nFor the sweet-toothed: To the dough add 1/2 teaspoon of almond extract, vanilla extract, orange flower water, cinnamon, ground star anise, and/or citrus zest; sprinkle with chopped nuts or dried fruit; or drizzle the baked crackers with or dip into melted chocolate post-baking.\r\n\r\nFor the savory snacker: Omit the sugar and sprinkle with 1 teaspoon of dried herbs (like rosemary, thyme, or sage), 2 teaspoons of chopped fresh herbs or spices like sweet paprika or sesame seeds, or finely grated Parmesan or Manchego before baking."

    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "CLARIFY AND BROWN THE BUTTER: Have ready by the cooktop a 1 cup glass measure with a spout. In a small heavy saucepan, on very low heat, melt the butter, stirring often with a silicone spatula. Raise the heat to low and boil, stirring constantly, until the milk solids on the spatula become a deep brown. Immediately pour the butter into the glass measure, scraping in the browned solids as well. Allow the browned butter to cool to room temperature, or no higher than 80\u00b0F/27\u00b0C (see Baking Pearls, \r\nbelow).",
      "Into another 1 cup measure with a spout or a small bowl, weigh or measure the egg. Cover with plastic wrap.",
      "In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, cloves, and ginger.",
      "MAKE THE DOUGH: In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the flat beater, mix the browned butter with its solids, the sugar, molasses, and egg on low speed for 1 minute.",
      "Add the flour mixture. Start mixing on the lowest speed to moisten the flour. Raise the speed to low and beat for 30 seconds.",
      "Scrape the dough onto a piece of plastic wrap and divide it in half (about 281 grams each). Wrap each piece in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 hour, or until firm enough to handle (see Baking Pearls).",
      "PREHEAT THE OVEN: Thirty minutes or longer before baking, set an oven rack at the middle level. Set the oven at 375\u00b0F/190\u00b0C.",
      "ROLL THE DOUGH INTO BALLS: In a small bowl or large custard cup, place the sugar for rolling the dough balls. Remove one piece of dough from the refrigerator.",
      "Measure the dough into a 1 1/2-inch diameter cookie scoop and level it off with a small metal spatula, or scoop out a heaping tablespoon (23 grams). You will get 12 pieces of dough. Roll each piece in the palms of your hands to form a 11/4 inch ball.",
      "Roll each dough ball around in the bowl of sugar to coat it well. Set the dough balls a minimum of 1 1/2 inches apart on a cookie sheet.",
      "BAKE THE COOKIES: Bake for 4 minutes. For even baking, rotate the cookie sheet halfway around. Continue baking for 4 to 6 minutes. Cracks will appear on the surface, but the inside will look slightly underbaked. When gently pressed with a fingertip, the cookies should still feel soft in the middle. (Baking longer will result in a darker looking and crisper cookie throughout.)",
      "COOL THE COOKIES: Set the cookie sheet on a wire rack and let the cookies cool for 3 to 5 minutes, until firm enough to transfer to a wire rack for cooling. Use a thin pancake turner to transfer the cookies to another wire rack. They will firm up as they cool, with a crisp surface and soft chewy interior. Shape, bake, and cool the second batch.",
      "STORE AIRTIGHT: room temperature, 7 days; refrigerated, 2 weeks; frozen, 3 months.",
      "BAKING PEARLS: If the browned butter is used at a higher temperature than 80\u00b0F/27\u00b0C, the cookies will not expand to 2 3/4 inches and will not form cracks. They will also require another 2 minutes of baking.",
      "It is essential to clarify the butter for these cookies, because just melting the butter will result in a thinner cookie that doesn't bake through. Use grade AA butter; lower-quality butter (containing more water) will result in a lesser amount of browned butter. You will need a total of 110 grams/1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon/133 ml browned butter.",
      "Superfine sugar will give the finest, most even crunch to the surface of the cookies, but if desired, turbinado sugar can be used instead for more sparkle.",
      "Refrigerating half the dough while you shape the first batch keeps the remaining dough cool, which prevents the baking soda from activating and ensures that the cookies will be uniform in size and shape. The time it takes to roll the remaining twelve dough balls is about the same as it takes to bake the first batch.",
      "The raw dough freezes nicely; however, if the dough is not baked on the same day as mixing, the cookies will be slightly larger, flatter, and darker in color."

Crack the eggs in to the well and pour in the olive oil, salt and about 1 tablespoon water. Whisk the eggs with a fork, gradually incorporating the flour.\r\n\r\nOnce you've incorporated as much flour as you can with the fork, set it aside and begin kneading the dough with your hands. Add more water as needed, 1 teaspoon at a time. Be careful not to let the dough become wet.\r\n\r\nContinue kneading for five minutes after the dough forms a ball. Knead by rotating the dough in quarter turns and pressing the half closest to your body over the other half with the heel of your hand. Knead until the dough becomes smooth, firm and slightly elastic. Cover with plastic wrap and let it sit at room temperature for 20 minutes.\r\n\r\nDivide the dough into four pieces. Keep each piece covered while working with the others so it doesn't become dry. Lightly flour the counter top and press the dough into a rectangle.\r\n\r\nAdjust the pasta roller to the widest setting and slowly feed the dough through. Return it to the counter and fold the dough into thirds. Feed it through again. Repeat five times in total, dusting with flour as needed.\r\n\r\nNow roll the dough one time through each of the remaining settings until you reach the desired thickness, usually the second-to-last setting (on my model it is setting #7).

Mix on medium speed for about 5 to 10 minutes, stopping the machine once or twice to scrape the sides and roll excess flour from the bottom of the bowl into the ball of dough. Note: You may need the extra 2 tablespoons water to get the dough to form, but allow it to mix for several minutes before adding any additional water.",
      "The dough should be slightly shiny and a little sticky to the touch, but should easily form into a ball without getting all over your hands. Cover it with a clean, cloth towel and allow to sit at room temperature for one hour.",
      "Preheat your oven to 425 F and position the rack to the middle. Divide the dough into four equal parts. On a lightly floured surface, roll the first piece of dough into a 1/4 of an inch thick, flat, rectangle.If you're using a pasta machine, it's time to set it up. Be sure it's tightened down to your work surface. If you're using a rolling pin, see step 5. Note: Dough is much easier to work with on porous surfaces, especially wood.",
      "Lightly flour the strip of dough on either side and feed the narrow end through the pasta machine on the first setting, twice. Move the dial to setting 2 and roll it through twice as well. Continue onto settings 3 and 4, flouring the dough lightly as needed and passing through each setting two times. Next, fold the strip of dough in half lengthwise, reshape it into a rectangle, and start back at the first setting as you did before, running it through settings 2, 3 and 4 two times each. Running the dough through all the settings twice helps it to strengthen and develop the gluten Tip: Do this when you make homemade pasta too, it makes the dough much easier to handle.",
      "Lay the flattened strip of dough onto a lightly floured surface and using a pizza cutter, slice it into equally sized rectangles (or squares). Note: If you do not have a pasta machine, roll the dough as evenly as possible, so it's about 1/8 of an inch thick and cut into crackers from there. They'll just have a more rustic look this way. Be sure to flour the surface so it doesn't stick once you're rolled the dough out thin.",
      "Place the crackers onto a baking sheet. If they're on the thicker side, prick each cracker lightly with a fork a few times. Bake in the preheated oven for about 10-12 minutes, turning the pan once partway through to promote even browning. Be sure to watch them carefully, they're done when the edges are golden brown. Note: Cooking time will vary based on the thickness of your crackers. Even when browned a little too much, they still taste great!",
      "Continue with the remaining three parts of dough until you've shaped and baked all your crackers. Depending on the size and shape you should yield about 50 crackers. Serve with cheese, dips, and spreads at your next get together. The crackers will store at room temperature in an airtight container for up to a week."

      "Dry the fish well with a towel. Using a pestle or heavy pan, whack the thick end of the lemongrass several times to bruise it, which releases some of its oils. Insert the stalk through the fish's belly so that the thin end comes out of the fish's mouth. (You may have to use a knife to clear a path from belly to mouth.) Pull the thin end of the lemongrass firmly but gently so as much of the stalk sticks out of the mouth as possible, and tuck the thick end into the belly until it's no longer visible.",
      "Spread the salt on a large plate. Using a brush or your hands, coat the fish on one side with the beaten egg white in a thin layer from the head to the tip of the tail. Lay the fish, egg white-brushed side down, onto the bed of salt, gently pushing down on the fish so the salt adheres. Brush the other side with the egg white (there's no need to use it all), flip the fish over, and use your hands to pat the salt on the fish to form a more or less even layer (thick enough to partially obscure the color of the skin, but not as thick as a European salt crust), enlisting some salt from the plate if necessary. Flip the fish once more and do the same on the other side. There will be a lot of salt left over. That's fine. At this point, you can keep the fish in the fridge for 30 minutes to help the crust firm up or cook it right away.",
      "ON THE GRILL (Highly recommended): Prepare a grill, preferably charcoal, to cook over high -- but not blazing hot -- heat. Put the fish directly on the grill grates and cook, without messing with it, for at least 6 minutes (otherwise, the crust could break). Then begin checking the underside, and when it's a light golden brown with a few darker brown patches, use the spatula and a pair of tongs to carefully turn it over and cook until both sides are golden brown and the fish is just cooked through to the bone, about 16 to 20 minutes total (see Note, below).",
      "IN THE OVEN: Preheat the oven broiler to high and position the oven rack as far as possible from the heat source. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and add a wire rack. Put the fish on the wire rack and broil, using a spatula and a pair of tongs to carefully turn it over once, but only after the crust has firmed up, until both sides are golden brown and the fish is just cooked through to the bone, 16 to 20 minutes (see Note, below).",
      "Right before you serve it (perhaps at the table for dramatic effect), remove the crust (it's too salty to eat and it's very easy to do): Using the tip of a sharp knife,\r\nmake an L-shaped cut just through the salt crust, starting at the tail, cutting along the back toward the gills, then down toward the bottom of the fish. Peel back the skin in one piece, do the same on the other side of the fish, and discard both pieces or leave them on the plate as garnish. Serve with a bowl of the dipping sauce.",
      "Note: Because the crust makes it difficult to inspect the flesh, the best way to check doneness is to use a thin, instant-read thermometer. The fish is done when the thermometer inserted into the flesh at the thickest part of the fish (behind the head at the fish's back) registers 125\u00b0 F."

      "Prepare the crust; butter a nine-inch tart pan with a removable bottom; set aside.",
      "Place flour, pecans, confectioners' sugar, espresso powder & salt in a food processor. Pulse about three times, just to combine. Use a fork to toss in cold butter cubes. Pulse until butter pieces are the size of oatmeal flakes and peas (they do not need to be uniform, you're aiming coarsely cut bits). Slowly add the egg yolk, pulsing briefly after each addition. When egg is completely in, process dough in long pulses (about 10 seconds each) until the dough forms clumps and curds (the processor will make a noticeable change in sound when this happens). Try not to overprocess. Turn dough out onto a work surface and, very gently, knead until any remaining dry bits are incorporated.",
      "Press dough evenly onto the bottom and up the sides of prepare tart pan. Place crust in freezer for at least 30 minutes. (freezing the crust will allow you to bake it without the use of pie weights.)",
      "Preheat oven to 375 F.",
      "Butter/spray the shiny side of a piece of foil and fit foil, butter side down, tightly over frozen tart crust. Place crust on a baking sheet and bake 25 minutes. Carefully remove foil and, using the back of a spoon, gently press down on any puffy areas. Return uncovered crust to oven and bake for another 8-10 minutes, or until crust is a deep golden brown. Remove crust from oven and place onto a cooling rack. Cool completely before filling with dulce de leche. (recipe below)",
      "Dulce de leche filling; prepare a double boiler; fill a medium saucepan with about 1-inch of water and bring the water to a slow simmer. Find a large heatproof bowl that fits snugly over the saucepan (make sure the bottom of the bowl does not touch simmering water). Pour both cans of sweet milk into heatproof bowl and place the bowl over simmering water. Stirring occasionally, cook until the sweet milk thickens and turns golden brown. This can take up to three-four hours; replenish the simmering water as needed. The sweet milk will thin out a bit before morphing into gorgeous dulce de leche - it's a long process but well worth the wait. {Note; if you have a faster method, feel free to use it.}",
      "Remove the bowl of dulce de leche from the heat and set aside until cool to room temperature. It will thicken up even more whilst cooling.",
      "When dulce de leche has come to room temperature, scrape it into cool tart crust. Use an offset spatula to spread it out into an even layer. {Note; use a light hand when spreading so you don't disturb the fragile crust.} Place tart in refrigerator for about 30 minutes to firm up.",
      "Prepare whiskey whipped cream; place cream and salt into stand mixer bowl fitted with whisk attachment. Beat on med-high until soft peaks are just beginning to form. With mixer set to medium speed, start adding whiskey and sugar. Turn speed up to med-high and beat until stiff peaks form (do not overbeat).",

You can absolutely substitute your favorite cheese here, but I always go for American. It melts, it's creamy, and I'm a sucker for tradition. Check your bacon. Split the muffins.",
      "The layering of the ingredients should start with the cheese since it doesn't need to be cooked. The bacon too can be cooked and crumbled before the muffin and the egg. The timing will come into play with the egg, which at sea level, cooks for exactly 5 minutes and 15 seconds at a rolling boil. This is crucial! You want a perfectly cooked soft-boiled egg, where the whites are done and the yolk is still runny. If you overcook the yolk, it's all over. You've RUINED BREAKFAST! So get your muffins toasting, and add your eggs to the pot. Make sure to keep it at a rolling boil! And don't forget to set your timer (hi Mike!). You may want to add an extra egg or two in case some crack, but these are usually still fine as long as they don't overcook. Extra eggs, bacon, and muffins always get eaten.",
      "Pull out the muffins (if you are making a large batch I suggest using the oven so you can do them all at once), butter them, and break them up into the bowl (one full muffin per bowl). I find that folding the muffin in half like a taco, with the butter inside, and breaking it up that way prevents butter-burnt fingers. You should be finishing with the muffins just as your timer is counting down to zero, so that the muffins are hot and the eggs are just about done. Having two people working on this is definitely a huge advantage, so you can delegate muffin duty to one person and egg duty to another.",
      "Now, pull your eggs off the heat and get them under cold water. Don't let them sit there, but get them cool enough to handle without burning yourself. The more you cool them, the faster your eggs will get cold, so you still want them to be warm. If you can barely hold them to peel them, then they are perfect. Gently peel the eggs and add two to each bowl (whole). Season with salt and pepper.",
      "When you are ready, break open the eggs and stir the whole thing up with a fork. This dish isn't pretty, and it doesn't photograph well, but if you decide to give it a try I think you will find that this will become one of your breakfast staples."

It should thicken to a gel-like consistency after just a few minutes. As soon as lines appear in the mixture when stirred, remove it from the heat and transfer it to a small, clean bowl. Let cool to room temperature.",
      "Next, heat the milk briefly to just above room temperature, about 110\u00b0 F or lukewarm to the touch (I do this simply by microwaving it for 10 to 15 seconds). Sprinkle the yeast over the milk and set it aside for 5 to 10 minutes for the yeast to activate (you'll see the milk start to foam).",
      "In the meantime, whisk together 2 1/2 cups of the bread flour, salt, and sugar in a large bowl. In a smaller bowl or a measuring cup, whisk together the tangzhong, cream, condensed milk (or milk powder), and one egg.",
      "When it's ready, add the yeast mixture to the wet ingredients, and whisk gently, just to incorporate. Make a well in the dry ingredients and pour in all of the wet ingredients. Stir with a wooden spoon until the mixture forms a loose, shaggy dough, then switch to using your hands. Knead for 4 to 5 minutes, or until the dough forms a semi-smooth ball. The dough will be quite sticky -- sprinkle the extra 1/4 cup flour, a tablespoon or so at a time, over the dough and your hands as you knead to keep it from sticking too much. I usually use at least 2 tablespoons and often up to the full amount, but you may not need it all.",
      "Add the butter to the dough, one tablespoon at a time, kneading after each addition. Add the second tablespoon of butter only after the first has been evenly incorporated. The dough will be slippery and messy at this point, but just keep kneading (actually, it's oddly satisfying) and it should eventually form a soft and pliable dough that's easy to work with. Knead for an additional 4 to 5 minutes, or until the dough becomes smooth and elastic.",
      "Place the dough in a large bowl with plenty of room and cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a damp towel. Let rise for 1 to 2 hours, or until well doubled. Alternatively, you can let the dough proof overnight in the refrigerator, which I prefer. It gives extra time for the gluten to develop, and yields a better flavor, in my opinion. Plus, dividing the labor over two days makes the process much more manageable. The dough should be fine for up to 24 hours. If storing in the refrigerator, cover more tightly with plastic wrap to avoid drying out, but do not seal completely (an airtight seal can sometimes cause an alcohol-like smell to build up in the dough).",
      "Once the dough is doubled, turn it out and punch it down. Divide it into three or four equal pieces. For each piece, roll the dough out to a long oval. Fold the oval into thirds widthwise, then flatten again. Roll the dough up lengthwise, then place into the loaf pan. Repeat with remaining pieces.",
      "Let the dough rise again until it's nearly doubled, another hour or so. After about 40 minutes, preheat the oven to 350\u00b0 F. When the dough seems ready, test it by pressing it gently with one finger; when the indentation bounces back slowly but remains visible, the dough is ready to bake.",
      "Whisk your second egg with a splash of milk or water, and brush the egg wash over the dough. Bake for about 30 minutes, or until golden-brown on top. (If your heating element is at the top of your oven and the bread begins to brown too quickly, cover with foil to prevent burning.) When it's done, the bread will sound hollow when tapped. Let it cool briefly, then slice and enjoy!"

      "On a cutting board, take the head of broccoli and cut off the florets with about 2 inches of stem attached to each. Slice these thinly (aim for between 1/8 inch and 1/4 inch), but roughly-no need to spend too much time getting everything the same size or thinness. Different textures are ideal. You want about 4 cups total of sliced broccoli pieces-add to a large bowl, where we'll build the salad. (Save the remaining stalks for another use!)",
      "Roughly chop the dates into pea-sized pieces-you should end up with about 1/3 cup. If the walnut pieces are large, give them a quick chop, too, so no piece is so chunky that it'd be unpleasant to get in a bite. Add the dates, walnuts, and dried sour cherries to the bowl of sliced broccoli. Crumble in the 2 ounces of goat cheese.",
      "In a food processor, blend the remaining 3 ounces of goat cheese with 1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil, 1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice, 1/4 teaspoon lemon rind, and 1/2 teaspoon salt, until the mixture is creamy. Pause the blending once or twice to scrape down the sides with a spatula, to ensure no cheese clumps are hanging around the perimeter. As it gets fully smooth and homogenous (this takes less than a minute), drizzle in the remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil, until you have a dressing with the consistency of loose, thick yogurt. Taste and add additional salt and lemon juice if needed.",
      "Drizzle the dressing over your broccoli salad and toss to thoroughly coat. This salad is excellent right away, but can also sit in the fridge, fully dressed and covered, up to three days. (And it even lasts a few extra days if you prep everything, but wait to dress it until you serve.)"

Set the pan uncovered in the refrigerator and chill thoroughly, at least 2 hours or up to overnight (if chilling overnight, cover with plastic wrap after the first 2 hours).",

Add the melted white chocolate. Beat again on medium-high speed until velvety and light, about 2 minutes more. Spread the frosting over the cake. Best served at room temperature. Tightly cover and refrigerate any leftovers for up to 2 days."

      "Set a large skillet over medium heat and add 1 tablespoon of butter. When the butter melts and begins to sizzle, add the chard leaves. Cook the chard, stirring occasionally, until it just begins to wilt down. Season the chard lightly with salt and pepper, and remove the skillet from the heat. Transfer the cooked chard to a plate and set it aside until it is no longer hot.",
      "Squeeze any excess liquid out of the chard. Discard the excess liquid. Transfer the chard to a cutting board, and finely chop the chard.",
      "Add the finely chopped chard into a mixing bowl, along with the ricotta, parmigiano, marjoram, and lemon juice. Add a pinch of salt and a generous amount of freshly cracked black pepper. Mix with a rubber spatula and taste. Adjust with more salt, pepper, parmigiano, or lemon juice as necessary. Everybody is different, so adjust the quantities until you are happy with the taste. Transfer the filling to a pastry bag.",
      "Roll out your pasta dough. You will likely need to work in batches. Every pasta machine is different, so here is my advice - do not roll it out to the absolute thinnest setting, but role it out to the \"almost thinnest\" setting. Make sure the surface you're working on is lightly coated in bench flour. You don't want to make perfect tortelli and then have them stick to the table and rip.",
      "When you have a sheet of thin, rolled out dough in front of you, use the pastry bag to dollop the filling. The dollops should be equivalent to about 1 tablespoon of filling. The dollops should be spread about 1 inch apart. And most importantly of all, do not put the dollop in the exact center of the dough. Looking at the dough, it will be a rectangle that is very long and about 6 inches in width - your dollop should be near the bottom of the dough, when considering the dough width-wise. The top half of the dough should be empty.",
      "Fold the top half of the dough over the dollops, covering the bottom half of the dough. Cup your hands around the filling to press the dough together and squeeze out any pockets of air. Use a pasta cutter to cut a rectangular shape around each dollop of filling (there will be some dough scraps, discard them). You should now have something that looks like a ravioli. To form the tortelli, you will keep three sides of the \"ravioli\" untouched. The fourth side, you will create a U shape by pressing inward with your index finger. Next, take the two corners at the top of the U shape, and bring them together, pinching them together so that the dough fuses tight. You should have something that looks like a tortelli. You can place the tortelli on a parchment-lined sheet tray and freeze them (after one day in the freezer, you can transfer them from the sheet try to a plastic bag). Or, you can cook them immediately.",
      "Set a large pot of water on high heat. When the water is boiling, add enough salt so that the pasta water tastes like the ocean. Set a large skillet over low heat. Add the remaining three tablespoons of butter. Boil the tortelli for two or three minutes. If they have been previously frozen, add another couple of minutes. You should consider cooking the tortelli in batches - they are delicate, and overcrowding the pot might result in a lot of burst tortelli. When the tortelli are nearly cooked, add 1/4 cup of pasta water to the skillet with the butter. Increase the heat under the skillet to medium-high, and swirl the pasta water with the butter. Delicately transfer the tortelli from the pot of water to the skillet. Gently swirl the tortelli around in the butter sauce. The sauce should look creamy and emulsified. Serve the tortelli on a plate with a drizzle of sauce, and garnish with finely grated parmigiano and some freshly ground black pepper. Enjoy."

The large bowl is necessary to be able to whip the cream vigorously without making a mess, and the style of whisk is very important: If you whisk is too small or has too few wires, it will take much more effort to whip the cream. Whisking vigorously, it should take about 3 to 5 minutes to bring the liquid cream to the proper consistency.",
      "By machine, start on low speed until the cream thickens enough not to spatter. Increase the speed to medium high and continue to whip, stopping the machine before the cream will hold soft peaks. Remove the bowl from the electric mixer and finish whipping the cream by hand with a whisk. Fold or gently whisk in creme fraiche.",
      "Note: Salvaging extremely overwhipped cream can be done. You must add up to 1/4 cup of cold whipping cream and work it in, stirring with a rubber spatula to restore the proper consistency."

      "Place a chestnut flat-side-down on a cutting board. Use a serrated knife to cut a deep \"x\" on the rounded side of the nut. (I find using a serrated bread knife to be the safest and easiest way to cut the chestnuts.) Repeat with remaining nuts.",
      "Bring a small saucepan of water to the boil. While the water is coming to the boil, place a kitchen towel inside a medium bowl.",
      "When the water is boiling, place a large handful of chestnuts (about 1 cup) in the pot. Boil for 2 minutes. Remove the nuts with a slotted spoon or spider and transfer them to the heated sheet pan. The boiling allows water to get beneath the inner membrane and the hot oven creates steam that helps lift the membrane from the chestnut. Roast for 7 minutes.",
      "Tip the nuts from the sheet pan into the towel-lined bowl and bring the corners of the towel together to keep the nuts warm. Return the sheet pan to the oven.",
      "Note: You might want to wear latex or rubber gloves for this step if your fingers are sensitive. \r\n\r\nRemove one of the nuts from the bowl, taking care to close the towel and keep the rest of the chestnuts warm. The corners of the \"x\" will have peeled back to reveal the skin beneath. Using both hands, pinch the four corners of the shell together to loosen and crack the skin beneath. Then peel the shell and skin from the chestnut. Repeat with remaining warm nuts then steam-roast another batch and peel. Continue until all the nuts have been peeled. You should have about 1 3/4 lbs. (800g) peeled nuts.",
      "To make the jam:",
      "Put a few small plates in the freezer so you can check the set of the jam later.",
      "Place the peeled chestnuts in a large stockpot or Dutch oven. Add a pinch of salt and enough water to cover the nuts by 2 inches. Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat and simmer until the nuts are very soft but not falling apart, 40-55 minutes. The time will vary depending on the size of your chestnuts. When done, the chestnuts should feel starchy and you should be able to easily smash them to a paste with a fork.",
      "Drain the nuts, reserving the cooking water. You should have roughly 2 1/4 lbs. (1kg) cooked chestnuts.",
      "Place the nuts in a food processor (you may need to work in batches). Measure out 2/3 cup of the cooking water, and set aside for use later. Process the nuts to a very smooth paste, adding some of the remaining cooking water as necessary to get them moving. The chestnut puree will get thick and look sandy as you process it; just keep adding cooking water until it moves again. Let your food processor run for a minute or longer to make sure the paste is quite smooth. If you use all the remaining cooking water to get your machine moving and need a bit more, just use tap water. The amount of water needed will vary depending on how powerful your food processor is and on the size of the bowl. Set the chestnut puree aside.",
      "Slice the vanilla bean in half lengthwise. Using a paring knife, scrape the seeds from the vanilla bean into the sugar. Rub the vanilla seeds into the sugar to distribute them evenly.",
      "Rinse the pot you used to cook the chestnuts. Place the vanilla sugar, the scraped vanilla bean pod, lemon juice and the reserved 2/3 cup (200mL) cooking water in the pot. Cook over medium heat, stirring frequently, until the sugar has dissolved. Increase the heat to high and bring the sugar mixture to a boil. Continue to cook over high heat until the sugar mixture starts to foam. Add the chestnut puree and whisk well to combine, taking care not to splash any of the hot sugar syrup on yourself. The jam will darken as you cook it.",
      "Cook at a rolling boil for 3 minutes then check for a set using the plates you placed in the freezer: place a teaspoon or so of the jam on the frozen plate and wait 10 seconds for it to cool. Rotate the plate. The jam should not run like a liquid, but have the consistency of loosely set jam. It will not wrinkle like jams with pectin to tell you it's done, so just look for a consistency you like. If it is too loose for your taste, cook the jam for another 30-60 seconds and check for a set again. When the jam has reached your desired consistency, remove the pot from the heat and ladle the jam into the clean, sterilized jars. Process the jam or cool it and then store in the refrigerator or freezer. The jam will keep in the refrigerator for up to one month and in the freezer for up to a year."

      "Boil the fingerling potatoes in salted water until they are cooked through, about 15 minutes. Drain.",
      "Trim the stems from the green beans and blanch them in salted water for about 4 minutes, until they are just tender. Drain and cool in an ice water bath.",
      "While the potatoes and beans are cooking, prepare a mustard vinaigrette by whisking together 1 tablespoon of white wine vinegar, the mustard, and the olive oil, and salt and pepper.",
      "As soon as the potatoes are cool enough to handle (but still quite warm), peel them, slice them into 1 inch chunks. In a storage container or bowl that is large enough to hold the potatoes, beans, and eggs and will be convenient to transport, toss the potatoes with the white vermouth. Once they have absorbed the vermouth, toss them in the mustard vinaigrette. Chop the tarragon and chives and stir these in, along with the green beans. Taste and adjust seasonings.",
      "Peel the eggs and cut them into quarters. Layer these onto the potatoes and beans, cover and store until your picnic. A few hours sitting will allow the vegetables to absorb the vinaigrette.",
      "In another transportable container, mix the remaining tablespoon of white wine vinegar and lemon juice. Whisk in the olive oil from the tuna cans, salt and pepper. Add the tuna, flake with a fork, and mix into the vinaigrette, keeping some larger chunks.",
      "Wash and cut the tomatoes into slices, or half the cherry tomatoes. Wash and chop the basil and parsley leaves. Gently mix the herbs and tomatoes into the tuna. Taste and adjust seasonings. Layer the anchovy fillets on top, cover and store until your picnic. Again, this salad will improve with a few hours of sitting.",
      "At your picnic, arrange on each plate a handful of lettuce, a generous helping of the potato and bean salad, and top this with a generous helping of the tomato and tuna salad. Enjoy with a crunchy loaf of fresh bread."
