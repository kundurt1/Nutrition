      "Glace de viande can also be used to enrich any gravy or sauce, by just stirring in 1-2 Tbsp.",
      "Just cut or break off a small chunk of the frozen glace de viande, and stir it into the sauce.",
      "Just remember, this stuff is potent, equivalent to 10 times the amount of rich stock as the amount of glace de viande being used (1 Tbsp glace de viande= about 5 fl oz stock)."

      "Combine the Sugar, Water and Corn Syrup (or Glucose) in a large pot over medium-high heat. Brush the sides of the pot with a wet pastry brush to remove any stray Sugar granules.",
      "Chef's Note: Once the pot is on the heat, do not stir. Stirring can cause the Sugar mixture to recrystallize. Make sure your pot can hold at least three times the volume of your ingredients. Later, when you add the Cream, the mixture will bubble dramatically. If the pot is too small, the Caramel will spill everywhere.",
      "Make a slurry (i.e. a paste) with the Cream and Cocoa Powder, slowly adding the Cream to the Cocoa Powder while stirring gently.",
      "Slowly adding the Cream to the Cocoa Powder while stirring helps to create a smoother mixture without leaving dry lumps of Cocoa Powder.",
      "Continue heating the Sugar until the mixture begins to turn a golden amber. At this point, it is okay to stir gently to redistribute the heat if necessary. Continue heating the Caramel until it turns a deep amber or to approximately 360 - 370 degrees Fahrenheit (182 - 188 degrees Celsius).",
      "Chef's Note: As the Caramel continues to cook, the rate at which the temperature rises will increase. Keep an eye on your heat and be ready to remove the pot from the stove as you approach your desired color. Remember that the Caramel will continue to cook even after the pot is removed from the heat.",
      "When the Caramel has reached temperature, remove the pot from the heat and slowly pour in the Cream and Cocoa Powder mixture while whisking actively. Do not pour too much of the mixture in at one time. The mixture will steam and bubble dramatically, and the pot could overflow.",
      "Once all of the Cream and Cocoa Powder mixture has been incorporated, add the Salt and Butter, and stir until combined. When the Butter is fully incorporated, add the Nutella and stir until combined.",
      "Set the Nutella Chocolate Caramel Sauce aside to cool and thicken, stirring occasionally.",
      "Store the Nutella Chocolate Caramel Sauce in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to a month or in the freezer for several months. The cold Nutella Chocolate Caramel Sauce is very thick. To return it to a pouring consistency, gently heat it over a double boiler."

      "Add the sour cream to the flour mixture and process until the dough comes together in the bowl. Gather the dough into a ball and knead it several times on a lightly floured surface. Form it into a 1-inch-thick disk, wrap it in plastic, and chill for at least 30 minutes before rolling.",
      "To make the dough by hand: In a medium bowl, combine the flour, sugar, salt, and baking powder. Add the butter and cut it into the flour with a pastry cutter or two knives until it resembles a very coarse meal. Alternatively, using a pinching motion, mix the butter into the flour with your fingers, then rub the butter and flour between the palms of both hands to blend it until the mixture is the texture of coarse meal. Chill the dough in the refrigerator for 15 minutes. Add the sour cream and blend it in with the pastry cutter or a fork. Knead and squeeze the dough 7 or 8 times to incorporate any loose bits. Gather the dough together into a rough ball (it will be a coarse mass), flatten it into a 1-inch-thick disk, and wrap in plastic wrap. Refrigerate at least 30 minutes before rolling.",
      "You can roll and cut the dough into shapes up to one week ahead of baking, arrange on a baking sheet, wrap well, and freeze. There is no need to defrost them before baking.",
      "To roll out the dough: Let the dough sit at room temperature for about 15 minutes before rolling. Sprinkle the work surface lightly and evenly with a little flour. Rub the rolling pin with flour as well. Place the dough in the middle of the work surface. Beginning at one edge, press the rolling pin down onto the dough to flatten it, moving across the dough in increments. Then, moving from the center of the dough outward, begin to roll the dough, adding more flour as necessary to keep the dough from sticking. Roll the dough gradually in all directions, flattening as you go, to form a large circle about 14 inches in diameter; do not roll it thinner than 1/8 inch. If the dough cracks or pulls apart, moisten the torn edges with a little water (using your finger or a brush) and press together to seal. Dust lightly with flour if the surface of the dough is sticky.",
      "The dough is ready to use in a tart or to cut out. To transfer the dough to a 9-by-10-inch tart tin or baking sheet, place the rolling pin gently on one edge of the dough and roll the dough up over the pin - then you can move it wherever your want.",
      "Sweet Pastry Variation: This variation produces a pastry that is sweeter and crisp like a sugar cookie. Increase the sugar to 3 tablespoons and add 1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract or grated lemon zest."

    "title": "how to make pizza",

      "Preheat your oven to about 180 degrees.",
      "Buy ready-made pizza bases, such as McCains Ready-Made Pizza Bases if you are short on time. If you have plenty of time, then you can just get dough. To make the method faster, don't get a huge pizza if you're only serving yourself or two. You don't want to take forever making your pizza.",
      "Spread tomato paste on your pizza base. It is a good idea to buy one that is specially made for pizzas. (For a spicier flavor, you can use any kind of spaghetti sauce, but mix about 2 tablespoons of brown sugar with the spaghetti sauce to make it less acidic.) You may want to sprinkle some Italian seasoning with the sauce as well. Make sure you don't put tomato base on the outside part of the pizza, or you won't have a crust for your pizza. Don't make the sauce layer too thick or too thin.",
      "Put a layer of ham onto your pizza. Use nice, wholesome and delicious ham for your pizza to help it taste better. If a brand claims that it is the best ham, buy it, taste it, and see for yourself. In order to find the best ham, take a whole bunch of ham from the store. It doesn't have to be the perfect ham, just the ind of ham that you like. Some people prefer smoked, while others prefer cooked ham, or honey ham. It all depends on you, and a couple of other people to help take \"votes\". Make sure that it is within its use-by date. Ham is optional because some people don't like ham in their pizza.",
      "Add a sprinkling of cheese. You can put as little or as much as you like, depending on your personal taste. Mozzarella pizza cheese usually tastes really nice on pizzas. Other people prefer other types of cheese. Just like the ham, it is up to you. Make sure that there are no spots without the cheese for your best taste. Some people don't like the cheese, while some don't want too much cheese. Common pizza takes the same old Mozzarella, but if you are feeling creative, you can use any cheese you want-with any amount! Try being creative if you are artistic, and if you area serious chef then cook the traditional way. The benefits of creating your own is that you can find a better tasting way of pizza, and it is more fun!",
      "Enjoy it by adding sliced olives to your pizza but make sure that the olives are pitless. You don't have to have olives, this is optional. You can take almost any topping you want, like extra cheese, sausage, meatballs, pepperoni, chili peppers, supreme, veggies, and others. Remember that it is your pizza and that you can do whatever you want with it. This time, you're the chef!",
      "Place your pizza on an oven tray sprayed with olive-oil, so that the pizza doesn't stick. You can use anything that prevents the pizza from sticking to the pan. This is important, and if you don't do that, you can end up without the pizza.",
      "Put your pizza in the oven, and turn it down to about 160 degrees. Too hot pizzas can burn you, and then you'll have to wait to eat your pizza. You don't want to have to wait for the pizza to cool off. Plus, you can get distracted and leave it in too long, then realize that you forgot the pizza was in the oven, and then you have charcoal in the oven. Nobody wants their work to turn into burn ashes, don't they? This happens with some people.",
      "Take it out after about 15 - 25 minutes, depending on your oven. Use your own judgment to tell when the pizza is ready. The cheese should be a golden brown, but it should not be burnt.",
      "Grill Method (Faster)Spread the sauce all over the tortilla but you might want to leave a little crust around the edge. Leaving some around the edge will give you that delicious, crispy pizza taste. Also, it will give you that nice crust to eat later after the main part of the pizza is eaten.",
      "Put on your toppings and arrange. Remember, you can take any topping you want, anywhere you want. Just don't melt a pepperoni on a meatball!",
      "Grate the cheese over the pizza. You can use basically any cheese such as cheddar or Edam. Mozzarella cheese is the best for pizzas and it is the most common, but there are many cheeses to choose from.",
      "Simply put it under the grill. Be careful not to get burned and your pizza could sizzle and pop because of the common bubbles in the pizza crust. The bubbles form often in pizza, but the best pizza doesn't have bubbles.",
      "Take it out after three minutes, it should be done! Now you can enjoy your tasty work.",
      "Wood-fired oven method (Even faster)Get your pizza base, it can be any sort, although it can't be more than 2 cms thick.",
      "Place your tomato base and toppings on, do not be scared to put sausage, or any other raw meat on; it will cook.",
      "Make sure your Wood-fired oven is very hot for the best pizza ever and to help the pizza cook faster.",
      "Put your pizza into the oven, preferably on a tray so the base does not burn. Remember that you don't want your work to burn, and nobody wants a burnt pizza.",
      "Turn your pizza every 30 seconds for two minutes, and at the 1:30 mark take it off the tray. Now your pizza should be done.",

Put 200g of \"00\" flour on a wooden board, make a hole in the centre and break the eggs in, add a drop of olive oil and a pinch of salt and with a fork then break up the eggs slowly pulling down the flour a bit at a time. Once this step is complete we move on to the \"massage\" phase. Knead the dough with your hands until it becomes soft and compact and stretches when pulled, once it reaches the right consistency leave it to rest for around 30 min in a cool place.",
      "Now comes the most delicate phase of the making of the pasta (in the local \"Cossignanese\" dialect this is called the \"pannella\") it is made by rolling using a long wooden pasta rolling-pin to stretch out the dough until it becomes 2mm thin. Use a little four to prevent the dough sticking to the board or rolling pin. It is important to keep all parts of the dough at a similar thickness as it thins out. Start with your hands near the centre of the rolling pin and move them to the ends of the pin as you roll so as to keep an even pressure over the whole area of the dough. Occasionally lift the dough and dust with flour underneath to ensure it does not stick. A special long thin rolling-pin is required to avoid creating flat spots on the pasta as the area of the dough increases.",
      "At this point the dough can lightly rolled up and cut with a knife to create thin strips 3/4m for \"maccheroncino\" and 7/8mm for \"tagliatella\" strips. The pasta is ready to use and since it is fresh it takes only a couple of minutes in boiling water to reach the \"al dente\" (to the tooth) stage. It can be topped with any suitable sauce: perfect is a \"ragu\" meat sauce but equally good is a mushroom or fish sauce.",
      "Ragu.",
      "In Cossignano the ragu is made with ground beef and pork. This is not \"mince\" that you might buy in a supermarket. In Italy we buy a piece of meat and ask the butcher to grind it for us so we know exactly what we are eating. Fry a finely chopped onion in a little olive oil, when it becomes soft and translucent add a diced carrot and a chopped stick of celery and cook together for a few minutes. Add 200 grams ground beef and 100 grams of minced pork, brown it with the addition of a glass of red wine. As soon as the meat is browned add salt and pepper to taste pop in a parmesan rind and pour about a quart of passata di pomodoro - pureed tomatoes. Cook for about two hours covered over low heat, stirring occasionally to prevent the sauce from sticking to the bottom."

      "Saute the package of potatoes, stirring occasionally until they turn brown and tender and if necessary, add 2 Tablespoons of water to allow potatoes to steam a bit. You can also keep slightly covered. When potatoes are still slightly firm (about 17 minutes) and golden brown add the sausage back to the skillet and mix thoroughly. Transfer entire mixture back to the bowl and set aside.",
      "Again, do not rinse skillet. Add 1 tortilla to the skillet and toast on each side about 1-2 minutes per side until golden and slightly crisp. Remove from pan, put on a plate and toast remaining tortillas. Stack tortillas and cover with a tin foil or kitchen towel to keep warm and allow any steam to heat through.",
      "Put 4 tortillas on the parchment lined baking sheet and using the back of a large Tablespoon, spread enough pepper jelly on each tortilla, stopping about 1/4\" from the outside edge. Once 4 tortillas are coated with jelly, spoon the sausage/potato mixture on top. Add 5 small scoops of ricotta cheese to each pizza and place in 450* oven for 12 - 14 minutes until crisp and jelly begins to bubble.",
      "Once cooked through, remove, and add another small amount of ricotta cheese to each pizza. At this time you may serve 1 pizza per person while cooking the next set of 4 pizzas. To serve them all together, if you have a second baking sheet, these can be cooked together in the oven, rotating the sheets from the top to the bottom about 1/2 way through the cooking time, just like when baking cookies.",
      "Place pizzas on plate, using a pizza cutter, cut into triangles and serve.",
      "Tip: This is a great make-ahead snack for the kids. Saute the meat and potato mixture and put into an air tight container in the refrigerator. Toast the tortillas as well and set aside lining each tortilla between a small sheet of wax paper.",
      "To assemble, add the jelly to the previously toasted tortilla, put the potato/sausage mixture on top and once again add the ricotta cheese. For children that are comfortable with the toaster oven, place on a small sheet pan and toast until warmed through being careful not to burn the edges. Allow to cool slightly before cutting and serving.",

      "For shortcake biscuits: Preheat oven to 350F and set rack in middle of oven; combine all dry ingredients in a large bowl until blended; rub butter into flour mixture with your fingertips until mixture resembles coarse meal; in a small bowl, whisk egg yolks with buttermilk to blend; add to flour mixture and stir just until evenly moistened; turn dough out onto a floured board and, with lightly floured hands, knead just until it comes together (if the dough is very sticky, sprinkle on some additional all purpose flour); pat out to about 1 1/4 inches thick and cut into rounds with a 3 inch cutter; gather dough scraps and pat out again to make remaining shortcake biscuits; set 2 inches apart on a large baking sheet; bake biscuits for approximately 25 minutes, or until golden-brown, and transfer to a rack to cool completely.",
      "For whipped cream: Beat cream, sugar and vanilla until soft peaks form.",
      "To assemble: Slice shortcake biscuits in half and set bottoms of biscuits on 6 dessert plates; dollop generously with whipped cream and distribute cherry topping evenly over the cream; place biscuit tops over cherries at a slight angle and sprinkle tops lightly with confectioners' sugar."

    "directions": [
      "To make the mojo de ajo, in a small saucepan over medium-low heat, combine the garlic, olive oil and the 1/2 teaspoons salt, stir to mix and cook, stirring occasionally, until the mixture is barely simmering. Reduce the heat to very low and cook at a very gentle simmer, stirring occasionally, until the garlic is lightly golden (the color of light brown sugar), about 30 minutes. (The slower the cooking, the sweeter the garlic.).",
      "Add the lime juice and simmer, stirring, until most of the juice has evaporated or has been absorbed into the garlic, about 5 minutes. Stir in the chilies, taste and adjust the seasonings with salt. Keep the pan over low heat so the garlic will be warm when the shrimp are ready.",
      "In a large nonstick fry pan over medium-high heat, spoon 1 1/2 Tbs. of the oil (but not any garlic) from the mojo. Add half the shrimp to the pan, season with salt, and stir gently and continuously until the shrimp are just cooked through, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in half the cilantro. Scoop the shrimp into a deep serving platter and repeat with another 1 1/2 Tbs. of the oil and the remaining shrimp and cilantro. When all of the shrimp are cooked, use a slotted spoon to scoop out the warm bits of garlic and chilies from the mojo pan and scatter them over the shrimp. Serve immediately with the lime wedges alongside to squeeze over the shrimp. (You may have as much as 1/3 cup of the oil left over. Reserve for another use.) Serves 6."

      "Make the salted caramel: In a heavy-bottomed saucepan, bring the sugar, corn syrup and water to a boil over high heat, swirling (not stirring) to caramelize evenly. When the caramel reaches a dark amber color (about 3 minutes), remove from the heat and carefully add the cream. (The mixture will foam up.) Add the butter, sea salt and vanilla and whisk to combine. Set aside and reserve.",
      "Make the pudding: In a saucepan, combine the maple syrup, brown sugar, water and salt and bring to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally. Simmer for about 5 minutes, until the mixture darkens slightly in color. Remove from the heat and whisk in the half-and-half until smooth.",
      "In a large, heatproof mixing bowl, whisk the whole egg with the egg yolks and cornstarch until combined. Whisk in the maple-syrup-brown-sugar mixture in a slow, thin stream. Pour the mixture into the saucepan through a fine-mesh strainer and cook over medium heat, whisking constantly, until it thickens to a puddinglike texture, about 5 minutes.",
      "Divide the pudding among four 8-ounce ramekins or small mason jars and top each with a quarter of the reserved caramel. Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours or up to overnight. Sprinkle the top of the puddings with sea salt and a dollop of whipped cream before serving."
