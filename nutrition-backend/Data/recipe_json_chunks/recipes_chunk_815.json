Then pour the egg mixture into the pot with the other half of pudding and continue to cook on medium heat until it reaches boiling stage again. Add cream cheese & mix thoroughly (use a hand mixer). It will dissolve the cream cheese better & make the pudding lighter & creamier. Remove from heat & add vanilla & butter. Keep using hand mixer until all is blended. Let pudding stand for 15 minutes, but while still warm pour half of pudding in pie shell & layer with bananas. Then pour remainder of pudding on top. When pie is completely cooled, top with fresh whipped cream and garnish with sliced almonds."
