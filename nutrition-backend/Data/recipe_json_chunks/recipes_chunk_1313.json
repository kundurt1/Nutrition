I think it's funny that she wrote chocolate \"bits\". One thing to remember is to make sure the melted chocolate, milk, and sugar mixture is cooled down a little before you add in the egg yolks or they'll cook and make it lumpy. Also, once the chocolate filling is made, pour it into the pre-baked pie shell and refrigerate it for 3 or 4 hours and it'll set up nicely so that you can spread whipped cream on the top."

      "Place your stone on the lowest shelf of your oven, then turn your oven to its highest temperature. Most ovens go to 500\u00b0F (260\u00b0C) and some to 550\u00b0F (287\u00b0C). Heat your stone for at least one hour before baking.",
      "If you're taking your dough out of the fridge, give it about 15 minutes or so to warm up a bit so it will be easier to work with. It should have doubled in size in the fridge. If it hasn't, let it sit at room temperature, covered with a slightly damp towel, until it does.",
      "Lightly flour your counter and your hands. Flip the dough into the flour bowl so the top side of the dough ball gets dusted first. Flip it once more, making sure that the dough is completely coated. Press the dough down into the flour, then pick it up and place it on the floured countertop.",
      "Pressing your fingers firmly into the dough, start by flattening the center and work your way out toward the edge to make it wider, until it's about 7 to 9 inches (17 to 23 cm) wide. Pushing down on the dough will release some of the gas and actually begin opening up the dough. Be careful not to disturb the outermost lip. This will eventually become your crust.",
      "The next step is a bit tricky. Your goal is to take this disc of dough and carefully stretch it to about 14 to 16 inches (35.5 to 40.5 cm) without tearing it or creating a hole. I pick it up with floured hands and begin to gently stretch it over my fists, letting gravity do most of the work.",
      "Once you've stretched it enough, put the dough back on the counter, making sure there is a generous dusting of flour underneath. Take a few generous pinches of semolina flour and dust your pizza peel. Make sure it's coated evenly. Gently lift and transfer your dough to the peel. Make sure both your hands and the peel are well-floured. You are now ready to dress your pie.",
      "Start by adding both mozzarellas to the dough, followed by the spinach and garlic. Add the sausage.\nTop with the cream and season with salt. Transfer to the oven. Bake for 3 minutes, then open the oven, pull out the rack with the baking stone, crack the eggs into the center of the pizza, and season them with salt and pepper. Push the rack back into the oven, close the door, and finish baking.",
      "The crust will rise significantly. Then change the oven setting from bake to broil, cooking the pizza from the top down until the crust begins to blister. The residual heat of the stone will continue to cook the bottom. (If your broiler is at the bottom of your oven, skip this step and continue to bake the pizza as described.) I cook all my pizzas until they're well done, which could take up to 10 minutes total (sometimes less). Just keep checking so you don't burn it. Look for the cheese to color and the crust to turn deep brown. It may blacken in spots, and that's okay.",
      "When the pizza is done, remove it from the oven and finish with the chives, a pinch or two of crushed red pepper flakes, a drizzle of olive oil, and the grated hard cheese."

Unfold the collar of the double bag and pour the brine over the bird, then add 2 cups of cold water. Draw up the top of the inner bag, squeezing out as much air as possible, and secure it closed with a twist tie. Do the same with the outer bag. Turn the package so the turkey is breast side down in the roasting pan and refrigerate for at least 12 and up to 24 hours. Turn the turkey 3 or 4 times while it is brining.",

Place the turkey back in the roasting pan and refrigerate, unwrapped, for at least 6 hours or up to overnight. This resting period allows the skin of the turkey to dry a bit so it is crisp when roasted. The turkey is now ready to be roasted.",
      "Plastic oven bags (made by Reynolds) are found with other food storage bags at supermarkets. Buy the turkey-sized bags. They are food-safe, plus they are big, strong, tear-resistant, and come with twist ties. Do not use plastic garbage bags, as they are not intended for food storage. I use a double thickness of bags as a precautionary measure against leakage. For the same reason, I place the bagged turkey in a roasting pan."

Add evaporated milk, being sure to add small amounts, mixing and scraping bowl between additions so the mixture does not separate. Pour pumpkin mixture over a spoon into crumbles, being careful not to disturb the bottom layer. Bake at a 325 oven until pumpkin custard is fully set, usually 45 minutes to an hour.

Decorate top with flower like geometric pattern with spinach and sun-dried tomatoes once it cooks a bit. Cook over medium heat until frittata is just set at edges, about 10 minutes. Take a dull knife and run it along the sides of the pans until it is loosened a bit. Be sure and go all the way around. Then transfer to oven and bake until just set, about 20 minutes.",
