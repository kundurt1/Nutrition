      "Gather all your ingredients and 2 large mixing bowls. If you have a large wooden spoon- use that; if not- put it on your shopping list. Mince your onion and chop your parsley. Chop your sliced bread up in small cubes. Beat your egg. Chop your claw meat into 1 square centimeter cubes (or just tear into pieces).",
      "In one bowl: mix onion, bread, and milk. Then add: mayo, dijon, worcestershire sauce, egg. Mix well.",
      "Make sure there's no moisture in your second bowl so the seasonings don't stick. In your second bowl: Place your crab meat in bowl. Season evenly with the black pepper, parsley, and Old Bay seasoning.",

      "Form the mixture into crab cakes as big or as small as you like them and place them on something flat that can fit in the fridge ( I use a hard plastic cutting board). Spray the cutting board very lightly with cooking spray to keep the cakes from sticking while in the fridge. Cover with plastic and put in fridge for 1/2 - 1 hour.",
      "If you are frying your cakes (recommended) I would use Canola Oil in your pan. If you are broiling- I recommend coating the baking sheet with Olive Oil and also drizzling just a little Olive Oil over the tops of your cakes.",
      "Pour your breadcrumbs on a dinner plate and coat each side of your crab cakes lightly with them.",
      "Heat the Canola Oil in your pan over a medium-high heat. When the oil starts putting off a little smoke it should be ready. You want to hear a little sizzle when you drop your crab cakes in the pan- that's how you know your oil is at a good frying temperature.",
      "Once you have your crab cakes in the pan- give them a minute to just sit- undisturbed. After about a minute- gently start shaking your pan- you want to see some movement in the pan to ensure they're not burning. Make sure they're not cooking too fast- if you start to smell a burn coming on- lift the pan off the heat and flip the cakes- reduce heat and return pan to stove.",
      "The method I use for cooking a perfect crab cake is simple- my fingers. Tilt your pan just enough to move the oil down to one side of the pan- feel around the bottom of one of the cakes at the top of the pan. The cakes are ready to be flipped when they begin to crisp around the bottom edges. If you have more sensitive fingers (like normal people) just simply use a slotted spatula to lift the cakes out of the pan and look at the bottom of the cake- when it's nice and golden-brown you can flip them.",
      "Don't depend on a timer to cook when pan frying because that's not always reliable. Use your eyes and your fingers.",
      "Take a big dollop of Tar Tar sauce in the middle of a plate. Take a spoon and push down in the middle of the dollop and lightly spread in circles to make a perfect little bed for your crab cake. Place your crab cake on its bed and serve with your favorite sides.",
      "I'll add a recipe for Tar Tar sauce sometime soon. For now- just use your favorite."

      "1. In a small bowl, mix together the garlic salt, onion powder, sugar, oregano, pepper, thyme, basil, parsley, celery salt and regular salt. Store in a tightly sealed container.",
      "2. To prepare dressing, whisk together 1/4 cup white vinegar, 2/3 cup canola oil, 2 tablespoons water and 2 tablespoons of the dry mix.",
      "My Note: I eliminated the 2 tablespoons of salt and it was just right without it. I doubled this recipe to fill a 16 oz bottle. I used balsamic vinegar which makes this extra special. It seemed like the amount of oregano was excessive but really it is perfect once mixed and poured on the salad. This dressing mixes and tastes best when the ingredients are allowed to \"marry\" overnight in the refrigerator. Finally a wonderful salad dressing that tastes as good as any in an Italian restaurant - we loved it! **- Update - Since I doubled the recipe, I used 1 tablespoon garlic salt and one tablespoon garlic powder which really gives this dressing a smooth taste with less saltiness. After making this quite a few times, adding a bit more sugar will temper down the acidic taste. I've also been adventurous and added dried, minced onion bits.",
      "To replicate the Zesty Good Seasons mix, add 1 tablespoon dried red and green bell pepper mix (found with the dried spices) plus 1 teaspoon dried red pepper flakes. Also, I suggest omitting the 2 tablespoons salt. You may want to add 1 tablespoon lemon pepper (not lemon pepper salt!) to increase the \"zest.\" Experiment with balsamic vinegar, fruit juices (orange juice is great with red wine vinegar) and flavored oils. Side notes: Blend the vinegar and 2 tablespoons mix and let sit for at least 5 minutes before proceeding with the recipe. This helps dissolve the individual spices and herbs. The water is unnecessary. You only need that with the Good Seasons mix, for goodness knows what chemical reaction to occur. This dressing will not stay emulsified (mixed) when stored in the refrigerator. Just shake it up well before use. I have used it for everything from marinading steaks to on popcorn. I think it is actually more flavorful that the packaged kind. I recently added this mix to a 50/50 blend of mayo/sour cream to make a veggie dip. It was great. I would say it would also be great for chips, or if you thin it with a little milk, it would make a great ranch dressing.",
      "I have made it several times with modifications per our taste of the day. I've used olive oil, canola, red wine vinegar, cider vinegar, balsamic and combinations of these. I have also substituted salt-free seasoning (just the cheap kind from Big Lots) for the salt. These changes all work well. Substituting Marjoram or Savory for the Thyme, celery seed for celery salt, 1/2 garlic powder for the garlic salt also works well. Sometimes I add a squirt or two of spicy brown mustard when mixing in the oil & vinegar. The great thing about this recipe is it is a versatile Italian season mix. I spooned out this mix into a cold pasta salad, and I spooned some into a homemade pasta sauce.",
      "When spooning out the seasoning mix, I felt that I couldn't get an even amount of the granulated seasoning and flaky seasoning. The next time I make this, I will separate items like sugar, salt, onion powder, pepper, celery salt from items like basil, oregano, parsley, thyme and spoon 1T of each (granulated and flaky)."

      "Add the oil and when the dough coheres enough, place it on a floured counter and knead for 10 minutes until it is smooth. It is very important that the dough be soft. Do not add more flour unless necessary to keep it from sticking to your hands and the kneading surface. Once the dough is kneaded, oil the dough ball with peanut oil and place in a covered bowl in a warm place.",
      "Separate and blanch the cabbage leaves for 3 minutes in a large pot of boiling water. Remove, drain, and cool. When it is cool enough to handle, roughly chop the cabbage and put in a clean hand towel. Wring out as much of the water as possible, then mince.",
      "Mix together the pork, cabbage, the minced ginger, minced scallion, minced garlic, salt and pepper. Mixing thoroughly with a wooden spoon or paddle of a kitchen mixer, add the cup of strained ginger water, soy, wine and sesame oil. Add cornstarch, and mix in one direction for several minutes. The filling should be moist, almost like batter; add chicken stock if the filling seems stiff or dry.",
      "Have the steamer ready before you begin. When the dough has doubled in bulk, and you are ready to make the baozi, punch down the dough and make several indentations in the dough with your fingers. Sift the baking powder into these holes, fold up the dough and pinch the edges together to contain the baking powder.",
      "Knead for five minutes, or until the baking powder is thoroughly incorporated. Cover the dough ball and let it rest for five or ten minutes. Form the dough into two ropes, approximately 1-1/2\" in diameter, then cut the ropes into sections approximately 1-1/2\" long. Roll each segment into a ball, place, separated, on a tray, and cover.",
      "To make a baozi, flatten one of the balls with your hand, keeping it as round as possible. Roll the discs into approximately 4\" rounds, as thin as possible on the edges, and 1/8\" or so in the center. Roll out several rounds and keep them covered as you begin to fill the baozi (Doing these somewhat ahead once again rests the dough and makes them more manageable).",
      "Smear a couple of heaping tablespoons of filling to the dough, leaving a border of a half inch or so, and begin pleating the very edge with your fingers and thumb, overlapping the dough by a quarter inch or so. The pleat should be squeezed firmly and pulled slightly vertically to prevent the top of the finished bun from being too thick.",
      "As you pleat, rotate the baozi clockwise, making sure the filling remains well below the edges of the bun. Complete the process by closing the top with a spiral twist. Place the pleated baozi, separated from one another, on a steamer tray lined with perforated parchment paper or (napa) cabbage leaves and steam, covered, for 14 to 15 minutes.",
      "It is very important to make one or two sample baozi to test for salt and seasonings. When you've done this, you are ready to complete the batch of 20 - 30 baozi."
