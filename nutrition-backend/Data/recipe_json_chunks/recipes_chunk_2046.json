      "Remove from the heat and make a ganache by pouring the hot cream over the chocolate.",
      "Let stand for about 30 seconds to allow the heat to distribute throughout the bowl.",
      "Add the hydrated gelatin and gently stir the mixture with a rubber spatula.",
      "The hot cream will cause the chocolate and the gelatin to melt.",
      "Slowly mixing the heavy cream and chocolate together causes the fats in them to combine to form an emulsion.",

      "If the line fills in immediately, the ganache is too warm.",
      "Keep cooling and retest every 30 seconds.",

      "If this happens, warm it up over a saucepan of simmering water, removing it every 10 seconds and whisking it gently until it is smooth and viscous.",
      "To finish the mousse: While the ganache is cooling, pour the heavy cream into another medium-size mixing bowl and beat to soft peaks with an electric mixer on medium speed.",
      "Be careful; if you overwhip the heavy cream, it will lose volume and the mousse will not be as light and airy.",
      "When the ganache is cool but not cold, fold in the whipped cream in 2 additions until combined.",
      "The ganache should not be so cold that it has begun to set and is grainy, yet is should be cool enough that it doesn't melt the whipped cream.",

      "Do not warm it so much that the whipped cream begins to melt.",

      "Prepare the pound cake: Cut the pound cake into a 4-inch flat circle and a 5 1/2-inch flat circle.",
      "You want the larger circle to be just a bit smaller than the diameter of your mold.",
      "That way, the mousse will cover the edge and the cake won't show through the mold.",

      "Place the dome, cake side down, in the center of the white chocolate circle.",
      "Prepare the paint sprayer: Place equal amounts of white chocolate and cocoa butter over a double boiler and melt until smooth with no lumps.",
      "Assemble the dessert and place in the freezer for about 10 minutes.",
      "The surface of the dessert must be chilled so the chocolate coating will harden upon contact, giving it the desired texture.",
      "Remove the dessert from the freezer and place on a platter or cake circle.",
      "Place the chocolate mixture in a clean paint sprayer and use it to spray the dessert with the chocolate.",
      "Cleanup will be much easier if you use a plastic-lined cardboard box as a backdrop to the dessert when you spray it.",

      "Let thaw in the refrigerator for about 1 hour before serving.",
