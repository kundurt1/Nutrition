    "directions": [
      "What Happens During Tempering?",
      "When chocolates temperature is raised to above 92 or 93F and then lowered, the triglyceride molecules in the cocoa butter bond together to form crystals.",
      "Imagine the crystals as stacking chairs.",
      "In the right formation, these crystals form a stable, tightly linked unit.",
      "But if chocolate melts and then hardens without tempering, the crystals arent neatly stacked but instead tossed together every which way, which means you dont have the same stabilityand you dont have the same beautiful glossiness, snap, and smoothness you find in tempered chocolate.",
      "Even professional pastry chefs can approach tempering with trepidation.",
      "But if you keep in mind that tempering is just a matter of time, temperature, and stirring, you wont feel intimidated.",
      "Here are several methods you can follow, based on how much chocolate youd like to temper.",
      "Methods",
      "Whichever method you use, work slowly and do not rush the process.",
      "THE BASIC METHOD OF TEMPERING",
      "Place the chopped chocolate in the top of a double boiler set over simmering water.",
      "When the chocolate is three-quarters melted, remove the bowl from the water and stir slowly but constantly.",
      "Stirring will distribute the still-tempered crystals throughout the chocolate and cause the other crystals to temper.",
      "The melted chocolate will be at around 95 to 96F.",
      "Because the melting point of chocolate is actually below body temperature, it will feel slightly cool to the touch.",
      "When it is lifted on a spatula and drizzled onto itself, tempered chocolate will form ribbons on the surface of the chocolate.",
      "You can also test by dipping a knife blade in the chocolate and setting it on a plate to cool for about 5 minutes.",
      "When the chocolate on the knife is set, it shouldnt have any streaks.",
      "If the process of tempering goes too far, the chocolate may start to solidify in the bowl.",
      "Return it to the double boiler and stir briefly over warm water just long enough to remelt it.",
      "A workable temperature for tempered chocolate is 89 to 91F.",
      "THE SEEDING METHOD OF TEMPERING",
      "You can temper a large quantity of chocolate easily by adding solid chocolate to already melted chocolate.",
      "Put aside one-quarter to one-third of the chocolate you are going to temper, leaving it in a solid block.",
      "Chop the rest of the chocolate.",
      "Place the chopped chocolate in the top of a double boiler set over simmering water.",
      "Stir the chocolate slowly but constantly.",

      "(It is more difficult to decorate each brownie from start to finish.)",
      "3 For skulls and ghosts: Pipe on the shapes of skulls or ghosts in: Pipe on the shapes of skulls or ghosts in white and allow them to harden for a few minutes (see photo 1).",
      "Then fill them in completely (see photo 2).",
      "Gently pipe final embellishments (eyes, mouths, etc.)",
      "directly on top of the white icing with any other color you like.",

      "Gently pipe on the stem in green.",
      "5 Allow the icing to harden completely before serving.",

      "Place the lobster on its stomach on a cutting board and while firmly holding its body use a cleaver or a heavy French knife to remove the claws and legs.",

      "Next, place the lobster on its back and firmly grasp the tail.",
      "Insert a very sharp boning knife into the abdomen where it meets the tail and draw the knife towards the tail.",

      "We suggest that the lobster be thoroughly washed under cold running water before proceeding with a recipe.",
