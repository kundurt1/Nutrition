    "ingredients": [],

      "Important info: Be sure that your oven is clean as this is cooked at a constant very high heat and it's nice not to have a smoking oven!. Bring the bird to room temp before roasting as it will cook more evenly and quicker.",
      "Preheat over to 475 degrees for 30 minutes.",
      "Remove and discard truss that holds turkey legs together. Pull or trim off and discard any excess fat in neck or body cavity. Remove giblets and neck (use for gravy or in stuffing if desired).",
      "Rinse turkey inside and out with warm water and pat dry with paper towels.",
      "Place a roasting rack in a 13 x 16 x 3-inch roasting pan (set rack sides so the bird is a minimum of 2 inches from pan bottom).",
      "Rub turkey skin generously all over with olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Set bird breast-side-up on rack. Pull wings away from body, then firmly twist them to push the wing tips under the bird (I find this easier to do before placing the bird onto the rack).",
      "Using aluminum foil, form caps over the tips of the end of each drumstick. If any parts of the turkey extend beyond pan rim, fashion a foil collar underneath to make sure drippings flow back into pan. Do not tie legs together (stuff if desired, in which case you will close body cavity. These days I always cook the stuffing separately).",
      "Insert an oven-safe meat thermometer near the center of the breast through thickest part until the tip touches bone, which is most accurate spot to check doneness.",
      "When oven temperature is reached set pan on the lowest rack in a 475\u00b0 oven. Roast, checking as directed during cooking, until thermometer reaches 160\u00b0 (my built in oven probe says NOT to touch bone, maybe it's a difference in thermometer types?). Halfway through roasting time, rotate pan in oven to assure even cooking and browning. If areas on turkey breast start to get browner than you like, lay a piece of foil over the dark areas.",
      "Remove pan from oven, set in a warm spot, and loosely cover pan with foil to keep it warm. Rearrange oven racks to accommodate potatoes and dressing. Decrease oven temperature to 400\u00b0. Let turkey rest 30 to 60 minutes. The resting period will allow the internal temperature to reach 165\u00b0, the USDA safe cooking temperature for poultry.",
      "Drain juices from body cavity (often plentiful in unstuffed birds) into roasting pan. Transfer turkey to a platter or rimmed cutting board. Set aside juices for gravy.",
      "Cut off turkey legs at thigh joint. If joint is red or pink, return legs to the oven for 3 to 5 minutes (at 400\u00b0) or heat in a microwave oven for 3 to 4 minutes. Carve the rest of the turkey. Carving juices may be clear to pink or rosy, this is fine as long as the thermometer temp is where it should be."

The deflation causes the very fine texture you will see, when you cut/split the bun. *To have less deflation, use the smaller amount of water - this will cause a denser bun."

I have tried it with garlic and it is good that way also. I have also found that it is good with shrimp and pork. Basically what I am trying to say is, the original recipe is just a simple, quick and healthy meal I came up with when I was craving Chinese food. I thought it turned out really great and wanted to share it. I'm happy that so many of you have enjoyed it.

If fresh fruit is available you may want to wait to add it (1/2 cup) just before serving. If you are in a hurry, you can try 30 minutes soaking time but if you can't soak overnight I recommend the HOT serving instead.",

Chia is very tiny -like the size of kiwi seeds- and it doesn't need to be ground for your body to digest it. It has a much higher nutritional footprint than flaxseed. Unfortunately it is about $15 a pound and I have never had enough on hand to put a whole cup into the mix. Instead I just left out the flax and put one tablespoon into the individual bowl.",
      "Note on nurtritional info: According to my calculations it contains 272 calories and 10 grams of fiber not counting the fruit. I guess it would depend on the amount in your soymilk etc."

      "2. In a large bowl, combine the roma tomatoes, sun-dried tomatoes, garlic, olive oil, vinegar, basil, salt, and pepper. Allow the mixture to sit for 10 minutes.",

      "4. Divide the tomato mixture evenly over the baguette slices. Top the slices with mozzarella cheese.",
      "5. Broil for 5 minutes, or until the cheese is melted.",
      "My Note: Here are a few tips from someone who has made this recipe at least a dozen times: 1) Once, I couldn't find sun-dried tomatoes packed in oil and used the dry kind. Perhaps it was my imagination, but I think I lost some of that distinctive sun-dried tomato flavor. 2) The recipe suggests that you could use dried basil if you're in a pinch. That's true, but use it ONLY if you're in pinch! Fresh basil (I chiffonade mine) is part of what makes this recipe so absolutely delicious. 3) The recipe calls for shredded cheese, but I like to buy bulk mozzarella and slice it into pieces that are about 1/8\" thick, and that are sized to fit onto the bruschetta. That keeps your cheese from falling off the sides, and it creates a nice \"blanketing\" effect over your tomato mixture that keeps it from falling off when you're eating it. Enjoy!",
      "UPDATE: My friends felt there was something missing and next time I plan on adding some fresh cut Oregano and doubling the garlic. I also plan on cutting the amount of olive oil used in half to only 1/8 cup. From the suggestions of previous a friends, I decided to brush olive oil onto the bread, broil it for a couple minutes, then add the topping. The cutting of the tomatoes did take a bit of time and I think substituting a couple cans of diced tomatoes would be fine. Just be sure to use FRESH herbs!",
      "After thinking about it, I would definitely suggest letting it marinate over night - the longer the better. I also took someone's suggestion to put the cheese on the bread and bake it first - then everyone can put on their own amount of bruschetta. Everyone agreed that was the better way to go. This really is easy to make - I also definitely suggest using fresh basil and buying the bread the day you are serving it as well. I will be adding this part to my receipe box, to add to my regular rotation.",
      "Have made it many times Now.And YES There is a reason this recipe lists roma/plum tomatoes as the tomato of choice. They are meatier than a beefsteak, early girl, or some of the other varietals available. Using romas will eliminate some of the wateriness that I have mentioned. If you have the opportunity to make this a day ahead, it gives the flavors a chance to marry and allows the garlic to mellow somewhat ~ so MUCH better! Absolutely great as it is, but decided to try adding a smidgen of anchovy paste to it on the third time. It sent it over the edge from outstanding to sublime!",
      "Update: 9/17/13 - 5 or 6 tomatoes roma (plum) tomato chopped, 2 cups a #1 Tall can =16 oz. and a #300 can =14 to 16 oz. Canned would work but be sure to drain it well or your bread will get very soggy.",
      "Many recipes specify a can size rather than a volume amount.",
      "I've tried a bunch of them! Here are a few tips from someone who has made this recipe at least a dozen times: 1) Once, I couldn't find sun-dried tomatoes packed in oil and used the dry kind.

      "- Eat and enjoy!",
      "~TRY THESE TASTY, FUN IDEAS!~.",

      "~ Divide everything all the ingredients by 3 to make 3 different pots then take each pot and use a different filler; batch #1 using oats, batch #2 using rice crispies, cereal, and batch #3 using frosted corn flakes!",
      "~ Use bigger globs and after putting each one down, push a small Reese peanut butter cup in the middle instead of dabbing peanut butter on after done!",

      "NOTE: You'll see I used specific brand names for 2 things. The peanut butter because after using a few brands, me and others agreed that this one definitely tasted the best for the cookies. The oats because other brands such as Quaker were MUCH different textured and were hard and completely ruined the taste or texture of the entire experience. So following these aren't required but very recommended."

      "Preheat oven to 400\u00b0F. Using a knife and your hands, break cauliflower head into bite-sized florets and place in large bowl. Peel and slice carrots and add to bowl. Drizzle vegetables with olive oil and toss to coat. Spread into a single layer in a large roasting pan [or onto a large baking sheet with a rim] and season with pepper. DON'T add salt at this point; your broth will probably add plenty. Roast vegetables in the middle of the oven until tender and golden brown, stirring occasionally, for about 25 to 35 minutes [mine took the full 35]. Remove from oven and transfer back to the bowl you used earlier. The soup can be made a day ahead up to this point; cool vegetable slightly, then cover and refrigerate.",
      "If you're making it right away, peel and chop onion and garlic while the cauliflower mixture roasts. When it's ready, heat a large, heavy pot or dutch oven over a medium flame. Add a tablespoon of olive oil and saute onion until softened and translucent, 3 to 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 45 seconds. Add cauliflower mixture to pot, along with broth and water. Bring to a boil and reduce heat to low to let soup simmer 20 minutes or so.",
      "Toward the end of this time, carefully ladle out 3 cups of cauliflower and broth and puree it in a food processor or blender. Avoid pureeing carrots with the cauliflower and broth. I do this partly to maintain the soup's pale, creamy color and partly because you want the sweetness of the carrots to be isolated bites as you eat the soup, and not to add an overall sweet flavor to it.",
      "Return the puree to the soup pot and stir to blend. Remove from heat, stir in the fresh dill and adjust seasoning with salt. Serve."

      "Meanwhile, prepare a nice bladder of blood. Stir together the corn syrup, grenadine, and food colorings (we do it right in the measuring cup to save dish washing--every erg saved in preparation is an erg one can use to enjoy the Payoff).",
      "For the bladder (the bag that keeps the blood together inside the mass of gelatin) take the gallon-size food-storage bag and turn it inside out.",
      "Pour the blood mixture into one corner of the bag and twist it closed so that no air bubble is caught between the sauce and the twist.",
      "Tie a knot in the twisted plastic.",
      "Adjust the position of the knot so that when the bag lies on the counter, it's about 1 1/2 to 2 inches high, and tighten the knot. With a pair of scissors, snip off the frilly extra plastic outside the knot.",
      "When the gelatin on the bottom of the mold is stiff and firm, position the bladder of blood in the mold, with the point of the bag just inside the point of the heart.",
      "Make sure there is at least 3/4\" of space between all sides of the bag and the walls of the mold (this will ensure that your guests don't see clues ahead of time).",
      "Pour in the remaining gelatin until the mold is as full as you can handle.",
      "Don't worry if you see a little of the blood-bladder grazing the surface of the gelatin, as longs as it doesn't project too much; the side you are looking at now will be the bottom when you serve it.",
      "Refrigerate until gelled firmly to the texture of fine, lean organ meat.",
      "It takes about 4 hours.",
      "To unmold, put about 2 1/2 inches of hot, but not boiling water in your sink.",
      "Set your mold in the water so that the water comes just below the edge of the mold for 15 to 20 seconds; the time depends on the thickness of the mold pan.",
      "Remove the mold from the water, and run the blade of a knife around the edge of the gelatin.",
      "Invert your serving platter, ideally a white pedestal cake plate, on top and hold it firmly in place.",
      "Then use both hands to turn over the mold and the plate.",

      "To serve, use a nice, big Psycho-style chef's knife and stab the side of the gelatin about one third of the way up from the pointed end of the heart. Twist the knife slightly, and blood will start to ooze out.",
      "Bare your teeth like a Marine jabbing with bayonet, and widen the wound. When the blood is coming at a good slip, grab a dessert plate, and cut a slice from one of the lobes of the heart. Flip it onto the plate, and drizzle it with blood by holding it under the edge of the pedestal. Add whipped cream and serve.",
      "This dish delights all five senses:",

We want to help you become a more exciting host, not a criminally negligent klutz. If, on the other hand, you're deliberately trying to murder your guests, please think up your own modus operandi. Don't try anything that might implicate a couple of innocent fun-book writers."
