      "The first secret to perfect buttermilk pancakes begins by separating the egg yolks from the whites. You need to whisk the egg whites until stiff peaks are formed, ideally with a hand mixer unless you enjoy torturing yourself. The reason for this will be explained shortly.",
      "With the exception of the egg whites, combine the wet and dry ingredients in separate bowls. Once each are properly mixed combine the two bowls together.",
      "The next secret is to leave the batter lumpy. Stir your mixture to combine the wet and dry ingredients but only stir enough to ensure everything is mingled. The lumps will work themselves out and result in a lighter pancake.",
      "Now for the most important step. FOLD the remaining egg whites into the mixture half at a time. Be careful not to overly agitate the batter because you want to leave all of the bubbles intact. This will give the pancakes extra rise.",
      "Now let the batter rest for 15-30 minutes to allow the baking powder to work its magic and let the flour absorb the moisture.",
      "Heat your griddle to 375 degrees, brush with butter and begin frying! Flip the pancake when you see bubbles on the surface.",
      "If you would like to add additional ingredients such as blueberries, chocolate chips or anything else - don't mix it in the batter. They will just sink to the bottom. Instead, sprinkle the additions on the pancakes as soon as they are ladled onto the griddle.",
      "Here is one final bonus tip: If you really want to replicate the flavor of an exceptional diner pancake replace the sugar with malted milk powder instead."

Add lamb and cook, turning occasionally, until browned on all sides, about 12 minutes. Transfer lamb to a plate. Add wine and 2 cups water to the Dutch oven; scrape up browned bits from bottom of pot. Nestle garlic and herbs into a large oval casserole; place lamb on top of herbs; add pan juices from Dutch oven. Cover lamb with foil; transfer to oven and roast, basting frequently, for 3 hours. Uncover, flip lamb, and continue to cook, basting frequently, until lamb is very tender, 2-3 more hours. Transfer to a rack and let cool for 20 minutes.",
      "2. Meanwhile, prepare the beans: About 1 1/2 hours before the lamb is done, drain beans and transfer to a 4-qt. saucepan along with 6 cups water, 4 cloves garlic, and the herb bundle. Insert the cloves into the onion and add to the pot. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer until beans are tender, about 1 hour. Remove pot from heat and season with salt and pepper. Discard herbs and strain beans, reserving cooking liquid. Transfer 2 cups beans, 1/4 cup cooking liquid, oil, creme fraiche, and remaining garlic clove to a blender and puree. Stir pureed bean mixture and about 1 cup of the cooking liquid back into pot and cover to keep warm until lamb is cooked. Serve the lamb sliced or torn into chunks, alongside the beans.",

Gradually whisk in the hot half-and-half mixture and return to the rinsed-out saucepan. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly with a flat wooden spatula (to keep the mixture from scorching), until it comes to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low and let the mixture bubble, stirring constantly, for 1 minute. Remove from the heat, add the chocolate, butter, and vanilla, and whisk until the chocolate melts completely. Strain through a wire sieve into a clean bowl.",

Spread and swirl the topping over the filling. (If you wish, transfer the whipped cream to a pastry bag fitted with a star tip, and pipe the cream onto the pie.) Sprinkle pie with cookie crumbs.

When the broth comes to a light simmer, slowly stir in the cornstarch and water while stirring the soup. This should thicken the soup. Add more or less depending on how thick you want it. Add tofu and simmer for five minutes or so. Pour the eggs into the soup in a circular motion. using a fine stream. Stir soup slowly to distribute the egg thoroughly. Add green onions as a garnish."
