Form your hand into a loose fist, and, with the back of the fingers, gently ream out the center of the mound until you have something that resembles a low, broad volcano with a very deep crater. Italian cooks call this a fountain,",
      ", for the pool of liquid in the center, but it's definitely a cone.",
      "Pour about half the water into the crater; add more water gradually as needed. Incorporate the liquid from the center outward. The walls of the crater will keep the liquid from running out.",
      "When the liquid has absorbed enough flour that you now have a messy, wet dough surrounded by flour, knock what's left of the volcano in toward the center and begin to knead with your hands to incorporate the rest of the flour into the dough. Scrape up all the remaining flour and the dough bits and squeeze them into the dough.",
      "Put all the ingredients in the container of a food processor fitted with the steel blade (not pastry hooks or the like). Let rip at high speed until you see crumbs forming. Keep going until the dough forms a ball. You may become convinced that your dough will never form a single ball, only many little ones. In that case, give up because you risk overheating the dough. Pour what you have out on the wooden board; use your hands to form the pieces into a single loaf of dough.",
      "The biggest mistake people make, says Oretta, is not using enough force. Skip the gym the day you make pasta and make kneading your workout. The women of Scandriglia, where Oretta has her country house, recommend making",
      "as a remedy for backache in preference to those boring exercises. On the other hand, my friend Antonietta, who learned to make pasta as a child in Basilicata, tells me southern men enjoy watching the undulating hips of southern women as they knead the pasta dough. If it helps to put on some music and do the",
      "as you knead, go right ahead.",
      "Plant your feet firmly on the floor and the heels of your hands firmly on the dough in front of you. A dining table will usually be a more comfortable height than a kitchen counter, which may be too high. With all your strength, and leaning in with your whole body, push the dough forward hard with the heel of one hand, then with the heel of the other hand. Then fold it over and continue the movement, alternating hands-or whatever works for you. You're pushing the whole piece of dough forward, so it moves on the board.",
      "After each completed movement, give the dough a quarter turn and repeat. Keep this up for 30 minutes, or as long as you can stand. If you've used the food processor, 15 or 20 minutes will do. You can quit early, too, if you plan to use a rolling machine: send the dough through one extra pass for each minute of kneading saved.",
      "As you work, the dough may seem dry, but you don't want it to be wet and sticky. It needs just enough moisture to hold it together, not a drop more. If your dough is so dry that you are quite sure it will never hold together, you can add a teensy bit of water. Your goal is a single smooth loaf of dough that is not sticky to the touch. If the flour is either very freshly ground (hence moister) or very old (drier), you'll have to adjust by feel. When it feels just right-moist but not tacky, considerably drier than the average dog's nose-set it aside for a moment.",
      "You'll probably need to clean the board about halfway through the process. Use a plastic scraper or the blunt side of a large knife to scrape up any bits that have stuck to the board. (Sharp knives may damage your nice wooden board, and their edges are dulled by scraping.) Likewise wash your hands, which are doubtless also encrusted with bits of dried dough by this time.",
      "Once you have a beautifully silky loaf of dough, let it rest for 30 minutes to let the gluten develop. Wrap it in foil, or just place it on the board and invert a bowl over it until you're ready. By this time, you probably need to put your feet up too.",
      "When the dough and you have rested, you can proceed to the next stage. Depending on what kind of pasta you want to make, this may involve rolling and cutting to make a pasta sheet (",
      ") or pulling pieces directly from the loaf of dough and shaping them by hand."

While the cedar plank is soaking, get the salmon fillets ready for cooking. Take the salmon and gently rinse with cold water and then pat dry with a towel. Next, rub the salmon with olive oil (both sides) and then salt and pepper the fillets. At this point go ahead and load the charcoal into the chimney starter and light. The coals should be ready in 20-25 minutes. While waiting for the charcoal take the mixed greens you have selected and wash, dry, and tear them into bite-sized pieces. Toss the greens together in a large bowl and set aside. Take the asparagus and trim 1/2\" off of the bottom of each stalk and then take a vegetable peeler and peel each stalk about 1-1 1/2\" (this really helps make the stalks more tender to eat).",
      "Next go ahead and cut your assorted heirloom tomatoes either in half (if small) or into wedges (if larger).",
      "When the coals are ready spread them onto half of the Weber BBQ. Take the cedar plank and place the lightly oiled Salmon skin side down on the plank and then place the plank over the coals. The Salmon should take about 10-12 minutes to cook. When the Salmon is done,remove it from the grill and keep it on the cedar plank to rest for 5 minutes. At this time place the asparagus on grill and cook over the side without the coals (2-3 minutes per side-turn once). When the asparagus is done lightly dress the greens and then separate then onto six plates, top with the Salmon fillet, the asparagus and the heirloom tomatoes and then follow with more vinaigrette. This is a great outdoor dish and will pair well with a crisp Sauvignon Blanc."

      "Whisk eggs, sugar, and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer. Place stand mixer bowl over a pot of barely simmering water and cook, whisking constantly, until mixture is warm to the touch and sugar is dissolved (use your fingers to check). Transfer bowl to stand mixer and beat on medium-high speed with the whisk attachment until mixture is cooled and tripled in volume, about 5 minutes (when you lift the whisk, mixture should fall back on itself in thick ribbons).",
      "Transfer melted butter to a medium bowl. Add thyme, vanilla, and 1 cup egg mixture to butter and whisk to combine.",
      "Transfer remaining egg mixture to a large wide bowl. Sift half of the flour over egg mixture. Using a rubber spatula or large balloon whisk, fold flour gently into egg mixture until almost fully incorporated. Repeat with the remaining flour, then fold in butter mixture with spatula just until incorporated. Gently divide batter between prepared pans; smooth surface.",
      "Bake cakes until tops are deep golden and centers spring back when pressed lightly, 25-30 minutes. Immediately run a knife around edges and remove springform. Transfer pans to a wire rack and let cakes cool completely.",

      "Toss 10 oz. strawberries with1 Tbsp. syrup in a medium bowl and let sit at least 10 minutes or up to 1 hour.",
      "Meanwhile, whip heavy cream to soft peaks in the bowl of stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. Add sour cream and 2 Tbsp. syrup and whip to stiff peaks.",
      "Transfer 1 cake layer to a platter and top with syrup-macerated strawberries. Top with half of the whipped cream, then place second cake layer gently on the first. Top with remaining whipped cream. Chill to set, at least 1 hour. Just before serving, arrange remaining 6 oz. strawberries, baby strawberries, if using, and thyme over cake.",
      "Cakes can be baked and syrup-soaked, but not assembled, 2 days ahead; wrap layers separately in plastic and chill. Thyme syrup can be made 5 days ahead; chill in a resealable container. Assembled cake can be made 12 hours ahead; chill."

      "Order the brisket You'll have to special-order your brisket ahead of time (the brisket already sold at the meat counter is typically not whole). You should be able to do this at almost any butcher shop or at a grocery store meat counter. Ask for a brisket that is as evenly thick as possible, with the surrounding fat trimmed to 1/4\" thick (this protects the meat from drying out while cooking).",
      "Season the meat An hour before preparing the grill, place brisket on a rimmed baking sheet. Mix salt and pepper in a small bowl and season the meat all over (it should look like sand stuck to wet skin but without being cakey). Let meat sit at room temperature for 1 hour.",
      "Prepare your grill Meanwhile, soak 6 cups wood chips in a bowl of water for at least 30 minutes or overnight. Leave in water throughout the cooking process. Keep remaining 2 cups chips dry. Light only 1 grill burner to medium (if using a 3-burner grill, light burner on either end). Make sure drip tray is empty, as a lot of fat will render. Place smoker box over the lit burner, add 1/2 cup soaked wood chips to box, and close grill. Adjust heat as needed to keep temperature at 225-250\u00b0F. We recommend using a stand-alone thermometer, even if your grill has one, to ensure an accurate reading. Stick it through the gap between the lid and base of the grill (or set it on the grill's upper shelf, though this is not ideal, as it requires opening the lid more frequently). The wood chips should begin to smolder and release a steady stream of smoke. How long this takes depends on how wet your chips are and the heat of your grill. To get more smoke without increasing grill heat, add a few dry chips to the soaked ones.",
      "Maintain the heat Place brisket, fatty side up, on grill grate as far away from lit burner as possible. Cover grill and smoke meat, resisting the urge to open grill often, as this will cause the temperature to fluctuate. Adjust heat as needed to keep temperature steady at 225-250\u00b0F. Check wood chips every 45 minutes or so, and add soaked chips by 1/2-cupfuls as needed to keep smoke level constant.",
      "Know when it's done Keep smoking the brisket, rotating every 3 hours and flipping as needed if top or bottom is coloring faster than the other, until meat is very tender but not falling apart and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of meat registers 195-205\u00b0F, 10-12 hours total.*",
      "*",
      "If you just don't want to spend your whole day at the grill, here's a fail-safe, Aaron Franklin- endorsed alternate method that will deliver similarly glorious results: Smoke brisket on grill until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of meat registers 150-170\u00b0F, 5-6 hours. Wrap brisket in foil, place on a baking sheet, and cook in a 250\u00b0F oven until meat reaches the same 195-205\u00b0F internal temperature, 4-6 hours longer. What's important is getting that smoky flavor into the meat, and 5-6 hours on the grill should do it. After that point, you're simply getting the meat cooked through.",

Once your grill has heated up brush it with some olive oil and place the portabello caps directly on the grill. They will need about 2 minutes or so per side max. Meanwhile mix your mayo, ancho chili powder, powdered dried chipotle and a dash of lime juice in a metal bowl with a wisk till smooth in color. Once the portobello caps are done let them stand on a cutting board for about 2 minutes. Cut the grilled caps in thin strips about 1/2 an inch thick. Now you can start assembly but make sure your grill is still on medium to high heat. Spread a layer of the mayo on the bottom piece of bread, then put the pieces of portabello in on thin layer. Next layer on a thin layer of the pablano followed by the pickle and lastly the swiss cheese. Lastly cover with the top part of the bread. Do this for both. Once assembled wrap in tin foil till it is air tight and squeezed well but not too hard. Now take the sandwiches and put them directly on the grill with the top side up and lay a frying pan, cast iron prefered, on top to \"press\" them down a bit into the grill. Late about 1-2 minutes pass, lift the pan, flip the sandwiches over and do the same with the pan for about 1-2 minutes. Take them off the grill and let rest for about a minute. You can now either slice in half or if serving at a party slice into 2 inch pieces."

Bake until the pudding is puffy, souffled, and golden brown, 35 to 40 minutes (don't let it overbake or get too brown). Touch it: The top should be spongy, not dry or crusty. The bread pudding is best served piping hot, right out of the oven."

For a more classic pairing, go for beer: Try a hoppy, malty IPA (India Pale Ale), like Northern California's Lagunitas IPA ($9 for a six-pack)."

Sear the meat on both sides, about 8 minutes per side, until it's deep golden brown. You will need to sear a portion of the meat at a time, because the entire brisket probably won't fit in the pan. To do this, leave one end of the brisket hanging off the edge of the pan, and then move that end into the pan when the other part is well seared. Once both sides are well browned, transfer the brisket to a large roasting pan that has a tight-fitting lid, or a Dutch oven.",

Then, working over a bowl, remove the segments, cutting between the membrane. Place the segments in a strainer to drain off excess juice.",
