With your palms, roll each section into a cylindrical shape, and cut into sections approximately 1/2 inch thick and 1 inch in diameter. Flatten each section with your palm, pushing it into a broad circle. With your rolling pin, roll into a circle approximately 2.5 to 3 inches in diameter, tapering the edges to be thinner than the center of the circle.",

The easiest way to remove it is to start in the middle of the rack and work a table knife or a screwdriver underneath the skin, going all the way across and teasing it up. Slide your forefinger in there and bring your thumb across, holding the rib down and pulling the membrane straight up. It'll peel from the middle.",
      "Sprinkle the ribs liberally with Magic Dust, coating both sides. Put them in a shallow pan or on a cookie sheet and cover them with clear plastic wrap or a lid. Refrigerate them until you're ready to use them. I recommend letting them marinate for at least an hour. At the restaurant, we dust the ribs up to a day in advance.",
      "Start your fire per the",
      "instructions.",
      "Soak the apple wood chips in water for half an hour. Drain.",
      "Remove the grate and arrange the medium-hot coals in a grill or smoker. If you are using a grill, it must have a lid. Set an aluminum pan next to the coals as a drip pan. Spread out the wet wood chips on the coals. Replace the rack, close the grill, and check the temperature. It should be between 200 and 210 degrees. If the temperature is too high, open the lid to allow some heat to escape.",
      "Notice that the meat on a rack of ribs is on the top. The bottom, where you removed the membrane, is called the \"bone side.\" Once the temperature is steady, place the ribs on the rack, bone side down. You want to cook them bone side down as much as possible. Turning them dries out the meat. If necessary, you can cut the racks of ribs in half to comfortably fit your grill.",
      "Cover and smoke the ribs for about 1 1/2 hours or until the ribs are done and tender. Do all your homework and read the characteristics of a perfectly cooked rib in Chapter 8. (?)",
      "You'll want to check the ribs every 20 minutes or so. Examine them to see if the surface of the meat looks dry or moist. Ribs \"sweat\" about three times during the smoking process. The pores of the meat open, and this allows moisture to escape. This is when the seasoning from the dry rub and the smoke itself are reabsorbed into the meat. When they're sweating, mop or mist them with some apple juice and sprinkle them with a little more Magic Dust. Opening the lid will lower the temperature; add more coals and wood chips as needed to maintain the temperature.",
      "About 10 minutes before you remove the ribs from the pit, mop them with the sauce. When you take them off the pit, mop again with sauce and sprinkle some more Magic Dust on them. Serve immediately.",
      "Mix all ingredients, and store in a tightly covered container. You'll want to keep some in a shaker next to the grill or stove. Keeps indefinitely but won't last long.",
      "Combine the ketchup, rice vinegar, apple juice or cider, cider viengar, brown sugar, soy sauce or Worcestershire sauce, mustard, garlic powder, white pepper, cayenne, and bacon bits in a large saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat.",
      "Stir in the apple, onion, and bell pepper. Reduce the heat, and simmer, uncovered, 10 to 15 minutes or until it thickens slightly. Stir often.",
      "Allow to cool; pour into sterilized glass bottles. A glass jar that used to contain mayonnaise or juice works well. Refrigerate for up to 2 weeks.",
      "As I've mentioned, I think the chimney starter is one of the best inventions ever. All you'll need is the charcoal, a few sheets of newspaper or a paper towel, and a match. A chimney starter will hold about 2 to 2 1/2 pounds of charcoal-half of a 5-pound bag.",
      "Determine how many coals you think you'll need at one time. This will depend on your pit, and it'll require some trial and error. Put the charcoal in the chimney, wad up a piece of newspaper or a paper towel, stuff it underneath the chimney, and light the paper. Set the chimney on the ground next to your pit. Your charcoal will be ready to transfer to the grill in the time it takes to drink one beer-about 15 minutes.",
      "Again, anticipating when you'll need that next batch of coals takes some practice. When you transfer your coals to the pit, leave one or two lumps in the bottom of the chimney starter and then add some more charcoal on top of that. The smoldering coals will start burning the fresh charcoal. You won't need to use any more paper. This batch of charcoal will take a little longer to burn down, maybe 20 to 30 minutes, but typically you have the time. You won't need this next batch of coals that quickly.",
      "If you're competing and you're using two or more pits, you'll want to have two or three chimney starters to keep up with the amount of charcoal you'll need.",
      "If you're using natural lump charcoal, which I highly recommend, you could add a few raw lumps directly to the fire, once it gets going. In a pinch, I might add two, three, or four raw lumps, but I'd never add 30 at a time. It takes too long for 'em to catch on fire. I'd never add raw briquettes. Not only do they take too long to catch on fire, but even good briquettes seem to put off a fume. Something to do with the binder and compression of wood.",
      "Most people overfire. By that I mean that they start off with too much charcoal, thus starting out at too high a temperature. I suggest starting off with fewer pieces of charcoal and increasing the temperature as necessary. It's easier to increase the temperature than to try to bring it down.",
      "Another common mistake is opening the lid to bring the temperature down. This does allow the heat at the top of the pit to escape, but it also lets the fire get all of the oxygen it wants, so the tire picks up. If you do need to bring the temperature down, you need to shut off the air source to the fire. Shut off both the draw (bottom vent) and the top vent to smother the fire.",
      "Charcoal is what you use for heat. Be sure to use a natural lump charcoal. Charcoal briquettes have additives such as carbon, coal dust, lime, binders, and other chemicals that make them easy to light but that throw off an unpleasant taste. Never use lighter fluid, either. Briquettes and lighter fluid will leave your meat with a noticeable chemical taste.",
      "There are many good natural lump charcoals on the market. Be sure to look for the words \"all natural\" and \"no additives\" on the label. On the competition circuit, I used charcoal by Hickory Specialties, now called Royal Oak. Peoples Woods' \"Nature's Own\" from Cumberland, Rhode Island, is another one of my favorite brands. Barbecue legend Billy Bones has his own private label charcoal made by Sugartown Products for sale on his Web site.",
      "Wood is used in barbecue to get smoke value, not heat value. Heat comes from charcoal; smoke flavor comes from wood."

Feel free to move the shanks around so that any that are submerged can be exposed to the oven air.

      "For the most authentic Fruit Roll-Ups, pass this fruit mixture through a food mill or a sieve and discard any solids that won't pass through (about 3 ounces). It'll take some elbow grease, but you'll be rewarded with some freakishly smooth roll-ups.",
      "Preheat the oven to 150\u00b0F, or as low as your oven will go. Line two sheet pans with silicon mats (I've read microwave-safe plastic wrap works too, but I haven't tested that myself). Pour half the mixture into each and spread into an even, thin layer with an offset spatula.",
      "Dry roll-ups in the oven for 6 to 10 hours. I know that's a big window, but all ovens differ wildly in how low of a temperature they can achieve. The time it takes will depend on your lowest oven temperature and roll-up preferences. In any event, you want to dry the fruit puree until it is perfectly dry to the touch and not at all squishy when pressed firmly. You should be able to peel up a corner and tug gently without the roll-up tearing.",
      "When the fruit puree has dried adequately, remove from oven and cool to room temperature. Use a knife to loosen the fruit sheets from the edges of the pan. Press a sheet of parchment or wax paper against the surface of the fruit and invert onto a cutting board. Peel off the plastic wrap or silicon from the bottom.",
      "If you want to make shapes for \"pull outs,\" use the tip of a knife to gently score each sheet into 8 square portions (this will prevent you from stamping shapes that will accidentally get cut in half when you portion out the roll-ups). Next, use a cookie cutter to stamp various shapes, but do not remove them.",
      "Next, whether you're making pull outs or not, place a fresh sheet of plastic wrap over the exposed fruit. Use the tip of a chef's knife to cut through the plastic wrap, fruit and parchment, dividing each fruit sheet into 8 squares. For Fruit by the Foot, just cut each large sheet into 8 long strips instead. Either way, roll them up and store in an airtight container for about one week at room temperature."

Garnish with cilantro and serve as an appetizer or as a dipping broth for fritters."

Add the butter and lard (if using) to the dry ingredients and, using the tool of your choice (see Tools of the Trade, page 20), cut the fat into the flour with speed and patience, until the fat has been reduced to small pea-sized chunks. Try to use a straight up-and-down motion, avoiding twisting your wrists, as the more you press on the flour the more tough gluten will develop in the dough. Avoid using your fingers, as the heat from your hands will melt the fat and further encourage gluten development. Unlike with pasta or bread, gluten is the enemy of pie dough, so be gentle, and be quick!",
      "Once your fat has been cut down to size, spread your mixture out gently to expose as much surface area as possible. Gently drizzle about half of your milk mixture over the flour, trying to cover as wide an area as you can. Using bench scrapers or a large spoon, toss the flour over the liquid (don't stir; just lightly toss), spread everything out again, and repeat the process with the second half of the liquid. You should now have a dough that will just hold together when pressed against the bowl, with visible little chunks of butter. If you need to add more liquid to bind it, do so with more cold milk, adding a tablespoon at a time until you reach the right texture. It's not an exact science, as everything from the humidity in the air to the dryness of your flour will affect the consistency of your dough.",
      "Once you've reached your goal, cover the dough tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate it for at least 1 hour. The dough can be kept in the fridge for up to 1 week, well wrapped, or in the freezer for up to 2 months. Note: For this recipe, you'll only need half the dough, as it's a single-crust pie.",
      "Preheat the oven to 425\u00b0F (220\u00b0C). Roll out the dough into a circle about 11 inches (28 cm) in diameter. Transfer it to a 9-inch (23-cm) tart pan or pie plate, trim the overhang to about 1 inch (2.5 cm), tuck the overhang under, and crimp decoratively. Blind-bake the crust until partially baked; set it aside to cool. Lower the oven to 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C).",
      "Make the filling: In a stand mixer with the paddle attachment, cream together the butter, sugar, and syrup until fluffy. Add the eggs, one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Whisk in the salt and the malt powder until they are fully blended. Put the pie crust on a baking sheet. Pour the filling in to the crust and bake it for 30 to 40 minutes, until the filling has just set and is still slightly wobbly in the center. Remove the pie to a wire rack to cool completely, at least 1 hour.",
      "Make the topping (if using): In a stand mixer, with a hand mixer, or by hand with a whisk, whip the cream with the remaining malt powder until stiff peaks form. Dollop the whipped cream on top of the cooled pie. Sprinkle the crushed malt balls on top and serve. This pie can be made ahead, without the topping, and refrigerated for up to 1 week, covered in plastic wrap. Add the topping (if using) just before serving."

Slowly add the milk while stirring constantly, then continue to stir until free of lumps. Add the salt and pepper and simmer, stirring often, for about 10 minutes, until the gravy has thickened and reduced. Serve hot.",
      "Pour the oil to a depth of 1 inch into a deep cast-iron skillet and heat to 370\u00b0F.",
      "While the oil is heating, put the flour in a large, shallow bowl. In a separate shallow bowl, whisk together the buttermilk and egg. Dredge each steak in the flour, shaking off the excess; dip it into the buttermilk mixture, allowing the excess to drip off; and then dredge again in the flour, evenly coating the batter so it is dry on the outside.",
      "Slide 2 or 3 steaks into the hot oil, being careful not to crowd them. The temperature of the oil will fall the moment the meat is added, so you will need to adjust the heat. As the steaks cook, try to keep the oil at around 350\u00b0F. If it gets too hot, the steaks will burn before they are cooked through. If it is not hot enough, the batter will be soggy. Cook the steaks for 3 to 5 minutes, until the batter is crisp and brown and the meat is cooked through. Using a wire skimmer, transfer the steaks to paper towels to drain and keep in a warm oven until all of the batches are done.",
      "Serve the steaks with the gravy. Plan on 2 steaks for a typical serving; children and dainty eaters will probably want only 1 steak."

      "Preheat oven to 425\u00b0F. Line the bottom of the chilled, shaped pie crust with parchment or foil and fill with weights (I like to use and re-use dried beans for this purpose). Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes, rotating halfway through. Remove the weights and lining and bake for an additional 10 minutes, or until the bottom is a light golden brown. Allow the crust to cool and lower the oven temperature to 350\u00b0F.",
      "In the bowl of a food processor, combine the pumpkin, evaporated milk, sugar, bourbon, and spices. Puree for 30 seconds, stop and scrape down the sides of the bowl and around the blade, then puree for another 30 seconds. Add the eggs, one at a time, and process for 5 seconds each time. Scrape down the sides one more time and run again for 5 seconds. Pour filling into the cooled pie crust, and bake for approximately 30 minutes on the middle rack, rotating halfway through, or until the filling jiggles just slightly and puffs a bit. If the crust begins to get too dark, place patches of foil over the dark spots. Allow the pie to cool completely. You may refrigerate or hold it at room temperature for up to 4 hours.",
      "Right before serving: Place the heavy cream in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment. Whip the cream to soft peaks on medium-high speed then add the mascarpone and whip until the cream is thick and somewhat stiff. Turn the mixer down to low speed and drizzle in maple syrup. Whisk on high until it is incorporated and the mixture is stiff. Reduce the speed to low and add the bourbon. Whisk on high speed to incorporate. Top the pie with a layer of cooled, toasted pecans, reserving some for the top. Cover the pecan layer with the whipped bourbon topping, then sprinkle additional toasted pecans over the top. Serve immediately."

      "Warm the vegetable oil in a large Dutch oven or other heavy-bottomed pot placed over medium heat. Season the pieces of meat with a little salt and pepper and add them to the pot. Brown for 3 to 4 minutes, then turn the pieces to brown the other side, another 3 to 4 minutes. Continue to brown the meat until it is nicely seared all over. Remove the pieces to a deep plate or bowl. Set the pot aside.",
      "Pass the tomatoes through a food mill fitted with the disk with the smallest holes. Discard the solids. Set the milled tomatoes aside.",
      "Return the pot to medium heat and add the extra-virgin olive oil. Stir in the onion, reduce the heat to medium-low, and saute for about 5 minutes, or until the onion is shiny and beginning to soften. Pour in the tomatoes, raise the heat to medium-high, and bring to a simmer. Return the meat to the pot and reduce the heat to medium-low or low to maintain a gentle simmer. Cover partially and let the sauce simmer, stirring it from time to time, for about 3 hours, or until the meat is very tender and the sauce is thickened. Add a splash or two of water if the sauce thickens too much before the meat is done. Taste and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper, if you like.",
      "Turn off the heat. Remove the meat from the pot before using the sauce.",
      "Put 4 cups of the flour and the salt in a food processor and pulse briefly to combine. Break the eggs into the work bowl and drizzle in the olive oil. With the motor running, slowly begin to add the water, adding only as much as you need for the mixture to form crumbs that look like small curds. Pinch together a bit of the mixture and roll it around. It should form a soft ball. If the mixture seems dry, drizzle in another 1 to 2 drops of water. If it seems too wet and sticky, add additional flour, 1 tbsp at a time, and pulse briefly.",
      "Turn the mixture out onto a clean work surface sprinkled lightly with flour and press it together with your hands to form a rough ball. Knead the dough: Using the palm of your hand, push the dough gently but firmly away from you, and then fold it over toward you. Rotate the dough a quarter turn, and repeat the pushing and folding motion. Continue kneading for several minutes, or until the dough is smooth and silky. Form it into a ball and wrap it tightly in plastic/cling film. Let the dough rest at room temperature for 30 minutes.",
      "Cover a large space with a clean tablecloth and sprinkle the cloth with flour. This is where you will put the anellini once they are shaped. Pinch off a piece of dough about the size of a walnut and rewrap the rest. On a lightly floured work surface, roll the piece of dough into a thin rope about 1/8 inch in diameter. Use your palms to roll back and forth and your fingers to spread and stretch the rope as you roll. I find it is helpful to",
      "moisten my palms with water every so often to assist the rolling, so I keep a small bowl of water nearby.",
      "When the rope is the correct diameter, cut it into 3 1/2-ich lengths. Bring the two ends of each length together to form a ring, and then roll the connecting seam together between two fingers to seal securely. As the rings are ready, place them on the flour-dusted cloth. Once you have finished shaping the first rope, pinch off a second walnut-sized piece of dough, roll it out, and shape and seal more rings. Continue to shape the anellini until you have used up all the dough.",
      "There is a traditional way to form anellini you may want to try. It takes some practice and agility, but it is fairly easy to master and a little bit quicker. Rather than cut the rope into shorter lengths, lift it up with the thumb and middle finger of one hand, and wrap the end of it loosely around the index finger of your other hand, to form a loop with a tail. Pinch off the tail and seal the loop, then continue to form more loops with the remaining portion of rope.",
      "(If you are serving the anellini the same day, your can leave them out on the cloth for up to a couple of hours before cooking.)",
      "Bring a very large pot or stockpot of water to a rolling boil and salt generously.",
      "While the water is heating, pour the vegetable oil to a depth of 1/4 inch into a large frying pan and place over medium-high heat. Place a platter lined with a double layer of paper towels/absorbent paper or a large, plain brown-paper bag near the stove.",
      "Carefully add the eggplant pieces (the oil may spatter) and fry, turning them occasionally with a slotted spoon, for 4 to 5 minutes, or until golden. Using the slotted spoon, transfer the pieces to the prepared platter to drain. Fry the zucchini in the oil in the same way, moving the pieces around in the frying pan, for about 5 minutes, or until golden. Transfer them to the same platter. Then fry the peppers for about 5 minutes, or until golden in spots and just tender. Transfer them to the platter with the other vegetables. Carefully transfer all but about 1 cup of the vegetables to the pot of ragu, gently stirring them in. Set aside the reserved vegetables for garnishing the finished dish.",
      "When the water is boiling, carefully drop the anellini into the pot and stir to separate. Cover the pot until the water returns to a boil, then uncover and cook the pasta for about 15 minutes, or until al dente. Drain the pasta in a colander set in the sink, reserving about 1 cup of the cooking water.",
      "Return the pasta to the pot and spoon about two-thirds of the sauce over it. Gently toss until the pasta is evenly coated with the sauce, adding a splash or two of the cooking water if necessary to loosen the sauce. Transfer the dressed pasta to a warmed serving bowl or shallow individual bowls and spoon the remaining sauce over the top. Sprinkle the reserved vegetables over the top, and then top with the ricotta and with a little Parmigiano. Serve immediately."

      "Prepare the mold: Place the dome mold sheet onto a sheet tray. Using a pastry brush, paint the melted, tempered chocolate evenly on the surface of each of the mold cavities, making sure that the chocolate goes straight to the edge. Place the molds in the fridge to set.",
      "Prepare the cake: Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F. Make an X with butter on the surface of a sheet tray, and line the tray with parchment. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment on high speed, cream the butter and sugar until they are light and fluffy, scraping down the sides of the bowl periodically. Add the eggs and yolks one at a time and mix well after each addition. Sift dry ingredients together, turn the mixer down to low speed, and add half of the dry ingredients, followed by half the buttermilk. Mix on low until just incorporated, then add the rest of the dry ingredients and buttermilk and mix until just incorporated. Remove the bowl from the stand mixer and finish mixing by hand with a large rubber spatula, then pour the batter into the prepared pan and spread it evenly with an offset spatula. Bake for 15-20 minutes, rotating halfway through, until a tester inserted in the center comes out clean and the cake begins to pull away from the sides of the pan. Allow the cake to cool for 15 minutes in the pan, then run a knife around the edge and place a piece of parchment and an inverted sheet tray on top and turn the cake upside down onto the new parchment. Pull the parchment off the top gently and allow the cake to rest for 10 minutes before cutting cake circles with a cutter that is the same size as the cavities of the mold.",
      "Prepare the mousse: In a large bowl set over boiling water, melt the white chocolate. Add the 2 ounces of cream a little at a time, stirring until the mixture becomes smooth and warm to the touch. Melt the bloomed gelatin in the microwave (stop every 15 seconds to check it) and stir to add it to the mixture. Whisk the egg yolks and the salt together, then add them to the chocolate mixture a little bit at a time, whisking as you go to prevent them from cooking into chunks. Whisk the mixture for 1 minute over the double broiler, then remove it from the heat and place in the fridge to cool to room temperature, a point where the mixture is neither warm nor cold (about 20 minutes). At this point, the chocolate mixture will be firmer. Whisk to make it smooth and supple. Add 1/4 of the cold whipped cream to the chocolate mixture and stir to lighten it. Add the remaining cream and fold gently to incorporate it.",
      "Assemble the bombes: Place the mousse in a piping bag. Remove the chilled mold from the fridge. Pipe the mousse into each of the shells, taking care to only fill it just to the top. Place a raspberry or two into each bombe and smooth mousse over the top. Place a circle of cake over each and gently press the cake into the mousse. Put the mold on a sheet tray in the freezer and allow it to freeze for at least 4 hours.",
      "Make the sauce: Place the frozen raspberries and sugar in a saucepan over low heat, stirring occasionally. The raspberries will begin to melt, then they will liquefy. Stir to help break them up in the pot. When the fruit begins to simmer, remove from heat and force the juice through a fine mesh strainer. Discard the seeds, chill the sauce.",
      "Plate the dessert: Set out plates for portioning. Place a tablespoon of sauce on the plate, then drag the spoon through the spot to create a design. Loosen the edges of the bombes from the molds and turn the cavities inside out to unmold the bombes. Allow them to sit for 20 minutes so the cake can thaw, then carefully place the bombes on the plates and serve."

Bake cake until tester inserted into center comes out clean, rotating them once front to back if your oven bakes unevenly. The original recipe suggested 17 minutes, but I found it took more like 20 minutes. Cool cupcakes on a rack completely.",
      "Note: If you don't let them cool completely before filling, they will taste good--but they won't look so pretty. Here's an example (I couldn't resist trying one right away)",
      "While your cupcakes cool, go ahead and make the filling. Chop the chocolate into coarse but roughly even pieces, and transfer it to a heatproof bowl. Heat the cream until it is simmering (but not boiling) and pour it over the chocolate. Let it sit for about a minute and then stir until smooth. (Note: Per the original recipe, if this has not sufficiently melted the chocolate, you can return it to a double-boiler or give it 20 seconds in the microwave to help the chocolate get sufficiently melty.) Add the butter, Irish Cream, and whiskey and stir until combined.",
      "Make space for the filling. The original recipe suggests using an apple corer to cut out a section from your cooled cupcakes to fill, but lacking one I found that the cake is sturdy enough that if you gently cut out a circle using a small, sharp knife, it works just fine. You want to cut halfway to 2/3 of the way down--not too far down or your filling might ooze out the bottom. You don't want to lose a single drop.",
      "Fill the cupcakes. You can pipe in the filling, or if it is still pretty smooth and fluid, you can just spoon it in.",
      "Make the frosting. In an electric mixer, mix the butter on medium speed until it is very fluffy. Whip the butter in the bowl of an electric mixer, or with a hand mixer, for several minutes. You want to get it very light and fluffy. Slowly add the confectioners' sugar, starting with a few tablespoons at a time of your sugar until the frosting looks thick enough to spread (for me, this was about 2 cups). At this point, add in the Irish Cream and whip it until combined. Beat in as much or as little of the remaining confectioners' sugar until the frosting has reached your desired consistency.",
      "Frost your cupcakes. If you want to get fancy, pipe the frosting on top in swirls or whirls-but if you just want to eat the cupcakes, frost using a spatula, garnish with a little something green, and get eating."

Increase the speed to moderate and beat for another minute until the whites hold a soft shape. Continue to beat on medium and start adding the sugar, one tablespoon at a time, beating 1/2 minute between additions. When half the sugar has been added, add the vanilla, continue beating, and resume adding the sugar as you were before. When all the sugar has been added, increase the speed to high and beat for 7 to 8 minutes or until the meringue is very stiff and the sugar is dissolved (rub some between two fingers to feel for grittiness). Depending on the power of your mixer, the total beating time will be between 15 and 18 minutes.",
      "To hold the parchment in place, pipe a little of the meringue onto each of the corners of the baking sheets and press the parchment flat to adhere.",
      "Do not allow the meringue to stand. Fit a large pastry bag (or gallon ziploc bag with the corner clipped) with a plain round tip (1/2 to 3/4 inch works best) and fill the bag with meringue. Pipe the stems onto one of the lined baking sheets, by holding the bag at a right angle close to the parchment and pressing the meringue out gently while slowly raising the bag straight up. The base of the stem should be a bit wider for support. Hold the bag with one hand and use a knife to cut away the stream of meringue with the other. If you get little points on top do not worry, you can shave them away after baking using a microplane. The stems should be 1 - 1 1/2 inches tall. Strain the cocoa through a fine strainer lightly over the stems to imitate soil and natural mushroom coloring. Place in the oven on the high rack. On the other piece of parchment, shape the mushroom caps. Holding the bag straight up and close to the foil, press out flat, even rounds of meringue. The caps should average 1 1/2 - 2 inches in diameter. Sharply twist the bag away when finishing to avoid leaving a bump on the top (smooth over with a knife if you do).",
      "Bake for 1 hour and 15 minutes or even longer, until the meringues may be lifted easily from the foil and the bottoms are firm to the touch. The longer they bake, the drier they are (and the better they are too) but they should not be allowed to brown at all as it will affect the taste. Turn the heat off, prop the oven door open slightly, and allow the meringues to dry out even more as the oven comes down to completely cool, approximately one hour.",
      "Remove the meringues from the parchment. They may be placed on a clean piece of foil, or parchment. Immediately, while the meringues are very crisp, use a microplane to shave away any points on the tops of the stems, making small, flat surfaces on top for easy gluing to the tops.",
      "Weigh out one oz. of chocolate for every five mushroom caps that you have. Chop the chocolate coarsely and warm it over a double boiler until it is completely melted and smooth(not over 115\u00b0F). Turn off the heat to avoid burning. Allow the chocolate to come down to 91\u00b0F before using. (you can do this by adding additional room temp chocolate)",
      "Hold a mushroom cap upside down and use a spoon to spread a thin layer of chocolate around the flat side of the cap. Adhere the stem to the center of the cap in the chocolate. Place the mushroom, stem side up in an empty egg carton to stabilize it. Freeze in the carton, only until the chocolate is completely set (it will go from shiny to matte) but no longer (the moisture will kill the meringues). Remove and store at room temperature.",

Sink your fingers into the mixture and begin pinching the butter and flour together, making thin, floury disks of the butter. Continue working the mixture until the butter is broken down first into floury pea-sized beads and then into a loose mixture that resembles wet sand. Drizzle in 3 tablespoons of the ice water and use your hand like a comb to mix in the liquid just until the dough holds together. If necessary, add additional water, 1 tablespoon at a time, until the dough comes together in a crumbly mass.",
      "Turn the dough out onto a clean, floured work surface or sheet of parchment paper. Gather the dough together in a mound, then knead it a few times to smooth it out. Divide it in half, and gently pat and press each half into a rough rectangle, circle, or square about 1 inch thick. The shape you choose depends on what shape you will be rolling out the dough. If you don't know how you will be using the dough at this point, opt for a circle. Wrap in plastic wrap or in the parchment paper and refrigerate for at least 2 hours or up to 3 days.",
      "Have eight half-pint jars ready. Remove half of the dough from the refrigerator.",
      "Lightly flour a clean work surface. Unwrap the dough, place it on the floured work surface, and flour the top lightly. Roll out the dough into a square measuring 12 to 14 inches and about 1/8 inch thick. Cut the square into six uniform squares or circles. Roll out the remaining half of the dough the same way and cut out two more squares or circles of the same size and eight circles the same size as the mouth of the jar. You can flip over a jar and use it to cut these circles (it's a perfect fit!), or use a biscuit or cookie cutter. If needed, gather the dough scraps from both halves, form into a ball, and roll out to cut more circles. (Reroll the dough only once or it will bake up tough.)",
      "To line each jar, hold the jar in your nondominant hand (left hand if you are right-handed, for example) and pick up a square or circle dough in your other hand. Position the dough over the jar mouth and then gently stuff it into the jar, pressing it against the bottom and up the sides of the jar and centering it as you work. Then, using your thumbs, press the dough gently against the sides of the jar while rotating the jar slowly in a clockwise motion. Make sure the dough is clinging to the sides of the jar. It should not extend more than three-fourths of the way up the sides of the jar. Repeat to line the remaining jars.",
      "Alternatively, carefully lift the dough round or square and fold it in half. Then, with the folded side down and the open edges facing up, lower the dough into the jar, open it, and press the dough from the middle outward to the sides of the jar.",
      "In a bowl, combine all of the ingredients, adding the sugar to taste. Mix gently so as not to crush the berries. Use immediately.",
      "Fill each pastry-lined jar with about 2/3 cup. Do not fill the crusts to the top. (The jars should be no more than three-fourths full.) You want to leave at least 1/4 inch of dough above the filling uncovered so you can attach the top crust. Now, lay a dough circle on top of the filling in each jar, and use your fingers or a fork to tease the edges of the crusts gently together. Cut a few small slashes in the top of each pie to allow the steam to vent. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes or up to 24 hours. (At this point, the unbaked pies can be covered with a lid and frozen for up to 2 months.)",
      "Preheat the oven to 375\u00b0F. Just before baking, in a small bowl, whisk together the egg and 1 tablespoon water until blended. Brush the top crust of each pie with the egg mixture.",
      "Arrange the jars on a rimmed baking sheet, place in the oven, and bake until the top and side crusts are golden, about 25 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool on a baking rack for at least 1 hour before serving.",
      "Once the pies have cooled for 1 hour, they can be popped out of the jars. Holding a jar in your nondominant hand, run a sharp, thin knife around the inside rim of the jar with your other hand to loosen any filling that may have stuck to the glass. Then gently invert the pie into your palm. It should slide from the jar with little resistance. If it sticks, coax it out gently by running the knife along the inside edge of the jar. Once the pie slides free of the jar, quickly invert it onto a plate or the baking rack. Serve warm or at room temperature."

Invert the second cake onto the bottom of the now empty sheet pan from the first cake (it's easier to handle the cake when it's on the bottom of the sheet pan, rather than nestled down into the sheet pan and hard to access). Likewise, peel away parchment paper. Now re-invert this second cake to the bottom of its original sheet pan. You now have both cakes right side up, one on a cutting board, one on an upside down sheet pan.",

Let any excess glaze drip back into the pot. Lightly drag the bottom of the cake/fork against the edge of the pot to minimize dripping and excess glaze. Gently place the cake onto the prepared sheet pan.",
      "Repeat with the remaining cakes. For a thick, dark coating, let the cakes dry for about an hour, then make a second batch of glaze (reserving none of the vanilla) and dip the cakes again. If given only one glaze, the cake will show through the glaze in patches. Whether you dip a second round is entirely up to your sense of perfectionism; one glaze is all it takes for a delicious cake.",
      "Once all of the cakes have been glazed, drizzle with the remaining vanilla glaze (tint the glaze red, if making the vanilla version). If the glaze has become too firm to drizzle, add in a teaspoon of water and stir to thin. Drizzle with a spoon, or with a pastry bag fitted with a small, plain tip. Finally, scatter sprinkles all over.",
      "Place the tray of cakes in a well ventilated and safe location where they may dry, undisturbed by pets or children. Let the cakes stand, uncovered, for about six hours or until the glaze has set. Exactly how long this takes will depend on the air flow and humidity in your home.",
      "Once the glaze has set, the cakes are ready for snacking! (Use a spatula to lift the cakes from the parchment, once free, you can handle them easily.)",
      "The cakes will store, covered, at room temperature for about 2 days, or up to a week in the fridge."

      "The night before you plan on baking, mix the whey and rye flour in the bowl of your stand mixer, cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and let it sit overnight.",
      "The next day, add the yeast, sugar, and one cup of the bread flour. With the bread hook, knead until it is thoroughly mixed, then add the salt and the rest of the bread flour, and knead until the dough begins to become elastic. Because of the rye, this can take a bit of kneading.",
      "Add the olive oil and caraway seeds and continue kneading until the dough is elastic and no longer sticky. A rye dough will never have the elasticity of an all-white loaf, but you need to develop enough gluten so the bread will hold its shape rather than spread sideways.",
      "Form the dough into a ball, put it back into the bowl, and drizzle it with olive oil to coat.",
      "Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let it sit until it has doubled in size, about 1 to 1 1/2 hours.",
      "Sprinkle cornmeal on the bottom of a cast iron dutch oven (or similar pot). Take the dough out of the bowl and knead it briefly and form it into a nice, tight, smooth ball. Put the dough into the dutch oven, cover it, and let it rest for 45 minutes. It should be just about doubled in size.",
      "Put the dutch oven into a cold oven, set the heat for 400 degrees and set the timer for one hour. Bake, covered. After an hour, take the pot out of the oven and uncover. It should be nicely browned and fully cooked. If it's not as brown as you like, you can put it back in the oven for another five minutes, uncovered.",

To keep the dough from shrinking while it bakes, line the shell with a piece of foil or parchment paper, then fill the tart with a layer of dried beans or other pie weights. Bake for 15 minutes, or until lightly golden around the edge. Take the tart out of the oven; remove the foil and the weights. Return to the oven and cook for another 5 to 7 minutes, until the pastry is an even light golden brown. (I went for 10 more minutes here and think it would have been fine to go even a bit longer.)",

When the onions are cool, spread them in the baked tart shell, pour in the custard mixture, and bake at 375 for 35 to 40 minutes, until the top is puffed and golden brown.

    "ingredients": [],

      "Have the pie shell ready for filling. Preheat the oven to 375\u00b0.",
      "Put 1 egg and the flour in the bowl of a stand mixer or a large mixing bowl and mix at high speed or by hand with a whisk until smooth (I used a handheld mixer in a large bowl). Mix or whisk in the remaining 4 eggs until blended. In a medium bowl, whisk the creme fraiche until it is perfectly smooth and then whisk in the milk.",
      "Pour the egg mixture through a fine-mesh sieve held over the milk mixture. Whisk in the salt, pepper, and thyme. (You can prepare the custard up to 4 days in advance before baking; cover and refrigerate. The flour, thyme, and pepper will settle to the bottom of the storage container and might stick to it, so whisk well before using.)",
      "Pour the egg mixture into the pastry shell. Put in the oven and bake for 10 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 325\u00b0 and bake until the filling is just set, about 30 minutes longer (for me it was 40 minutes). When touched, the center of the quiche should feel slightly firm, not liquidy. Let cool on a wire rack for at least 20 minutes to allow the custard to set up, so that it will slice neatly. Serve warm or at room temperature. To reheat a fully cooled quiche, cover with foil and bake at 325 for about 15 minutes.",
      "Stir the salt into the water until dissolved. Chop the butter into small pieces (1/2 to 1 inch). I stash the water and butter in the freezer for 20-30 minutes before proceeding.",
      "Take the top off the processor, sprinkle the flour-butter mixture with about half of the very cold water, replace the top, and pulse a couple of times. Then add the rest of the water and pulse until the dough begins to come together into a ball but is not completely smooth. You should still be able to see some butter chunks. (I think it is more common to pour the water through the feed tube with the top on while the processor is running, but that method usually leads me to over-process and still fails to distribute the water evenly.)",
      "On a lightly floured surface, divide the dough into 2 equal balls and shape each ball into a disk 1 inch thick. Wrap well and chill for at least 2 hours or up to overnight. I accidentally froze (instead of refrigerating) my dough for 2 hours before rolling out and found it especially easy to work with.",
      "On a lightly floured surface or between two pieces of parchment paper, roll the chilled dough out 1/8 inch thick, rolling from the center toward the edge in all directions. Work as quickly as you can and give the dough a quarter turn every few strokes to discourage sticking. Carefully transfer the dough to a pie dish or tart pan, easing it into the bottom and sides and then pressing gently into place. Trim or flute exess dough at the rim as you like. Chill until firm to the touch, 30 minutes to 1 hour (or wrap well and chill overnight).",
      "Preheat the oven to 375\u00b0. Line the chilled shell with parchment paper and fill with pie weights. For a fully baked shell, bake until the surface looks light brown, about 25 minutes (peek under the paper to check). Remove from the oven and remove parchment and pie weights. Return shell to oven and bake until golden brown, about 5 minutes more. Cool completely on wire racks before filling."

      "Reduce the heat and let simmer uncovered until the chicken is cooked, about 45 minutes. Transfer the chicken to a large bowl and, when cool enough to handle, take the meat off the bones (reserve the meat for another purpose). Return the bones to the pot and simmer for 1 hour more. Strain through a cheesecloth-lined sieve, discarding the solids. Cool the broth slightly, then refrigerate until cold, overnight or up to 3 days.",
      "Using a slotted spoon, skim off the solidified chicken fat from the broth. Save for making matzo balls or another purpose.",

Working gently, without pressing, use clean, wet hands to form 1/2-inch-round matzo balls. As they are formed, drop them into the boiling water. When all of the matzo balls are formed, cover the pot with a round of parchment paper to keep them submerged (or partially cover the pot with a lid if you don't have parchment paper) and simmer very gently (don't let the water boil again) until cooked through and tender, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Remove from the cooking liquid with a slotted spoon, and arrange in a single layer on a rimmed baking sheet. If not using that day, let cool to room temperature, then store the matzo balls in a single layer in an airtight container filled with cooled cooking liquid to cover for up to 2 days.",
      "To serve, gently reheat the matzo balls in a pot filled with matzo ball cooking liquid or fresh water to cover (when the water comes to a simmer, taste a matzo ball to see if it's hot enough, and either use immediately or continue to simmer until warmed to taste).",
      "In a separate pot, bring the chicken broth to a boil. Add the carrot rounds and simmer until soft, about 7 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper, then add the dill.",
      "Ladle the broth into individual serving bowls. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the warmed matzo balls into the soup and serve piping hot."

      "Pour 2/3 cup of the water into a measuring cup and sprinkle over the yeast and sugar. Stir with a wooden spoon or rubber spatula, and let the yeast dissolve for about 5 minutes. When the mixture bubbles and looks creamy, add 1 more cup of the water, along with 4 1/2 tablespoons of the olive oil.",

Turn the speed up to medium and beat for 10 minutes more, or until the dough cleans the sides of the bowl. The dough will be very soft and sticky, almost like a batter, and it will pool at the bottom of the bowl, but that's fine. (You can mix this dough by hand using a wooden spoon, but you'll need time and a lot of energy, since the dough is so very soft and stretchy.)",
      "Mix the olives, rosemary, and lemon or orange zest together, add them to the mixer, and beat for another minute or so. The olives won't blend into the dough completely, so finish the job with a sturdy rubber spatula or a wooden spoon.",
      "Lightly oil a large bowl and scrape the dough into it. Lightly oil the top of the dough, then oil a piece of plastic wrap. Cover the bowl with the plastic, oiled side down, and put it in a warm place until the dough doubles in volume, 1 to 2 hours, depending upon the warmth of your room.",
      "Stir the dough, cover it again, and refrigerate it for at least 6 hours, or for as long as 3 days. (I prefer to let the dough rest overnight.) If you're keeping it in the fridge for a while, it will probably rise to the top of the bowl again, in which case you can stir it down, or not-it's not crucial.",
      "Remove the dough from the refrigerator, stir it down, and divide it in half. Turn 1 piece of dough out onto a floured surface and flour the top of the dough. Roll the dough into a rectangle that's about 12 inches long and 7 to 9 inches wide. Precision isn't important here. As you're working, lift the dough and flour the counter again if the dough is sticking. Transfer the dough to a large nonstick baking sheet or one lined with a silicone baking mat or parchment paper.",
      "Using a pizza cutter, a single-edged razor blade, or an X-Acto knife, cut about 4 slashes, about 2 inches long, at an angle down each long side of the rectangle, rather like the veins on a leaf. If you'd like, make another 2-inch vertical slash near the top of the rectangle. Again, don't worry about precision. With your fingers, gently push and pull the slashes open, tugging the dough a little as you go. Try to get the holes to open to about an inch wide. As you cajole the dough, you might want to tug a little more at the base than at the top, so you end up with a bread that's flat at the bottom and tapers toward the top, like a leaf.",
      "Repeat with the second piece of dough on a second baking sheet (or cover that portion and return it to the refrigerator to bake later).",
      "Cover the dough with a dish towel and let it rest for 15 minutes.",
      "Position the racks to divide the oven into thirds and preheat the oven to 450\u00b0F. (If you're baking just 1 bread, bake it on the lower or middle rack.)",
      "Mix the remaining tablespoon of olive oil with the remaining 2 teaspoons water in a small cup. Prick the dough all over with a fork and, with a pastry brush, lightly coat the fougasse with the oil and water mixture. Sprinkle the bread all over with kosher or other coarse salt.",
      "Slide the baking sheets into the oven and bake for 10 minutes. Rotate the sheets from top to bottom and front to back and bake for another 8 to 10 minutes, or until the bread is golden-it won't get too dark. Transfer the fougasse to a cooling rack and let rest for at least 10 to 15 minutes before serving.",
      "You can keep the dough in the refrigerator for up to 3 days, but once baked, the bread should be eaten the same day."
