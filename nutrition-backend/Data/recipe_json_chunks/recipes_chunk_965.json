      "1. Place the chicken, butter, soup, and onion in a slow cooker, and fill with enough water to cover.",
      "2. Cover, and cook for 5 to 6 hours on High. About 30 minutes before serving, place the torn biscuit dough in the slow cooker. Cook until the dough is no longer raw in the center.",
      "My Update Note: It better than grandma's homemade chicken and dumplings and the gourmet chef who lives next door tasted it and thought it was an old family recipe. :) And loved it! First, you definitly need to add spices. I used cumin, parsley, poultry seasoning, seasoned salt and pepper. Next, I only used 1 can of biscuits, not 2. (I even used the reduced fat version and they tasted the same!) Thirdly, I used 1 can of cream of mushroom soup and 1 can of cream of chicken. Instead of water, I used 3/4 can of low sodium/lowfat chicken broth. At first, it seemed like way to much liquid, but eventually the biscuits soaked it all up! Fourthly, I added 2 CANS of mixed veggies (mix of carrots, peas, tiny potatoes, celery). I am not a fan of canned veggies by any means, but they tasted great in this recipe- so tender! I did add red onion, but I used only half and chopped the pieces extra small. Lastly, I cooked the biscuits for almost 3 hours for a total cooking time of 6.5 hours on high. 30 minutes is just not enough time! Another tip- if you accidentally add too much chicken broth, add a bit of sifted flour and the sauce thickens right up! I know that this recipe will be a winter tradition in our household for years to come!",
      "Some other adjustments I do sometime are as follows: Use 2 cans of cream of chicken soup (as directed- don't deviate with other cream soups) cover with 1 14 oz can of chicken broth (no need to cover with water, dillutes flavor). Put torn biscuit dough in roughly 90 minutes before ready to serve and make sure that you push them down into the liquid mixture a little, so that they get cooked on the tops, too and saturated with the chicken flavor. I made this recipe with veggies and without, it was better WITHOUT, because the consistency was better and the veggie flavor soaked into the dumplings. 5 hours on High is MORE than enough total cooking time. Also, leave chicken partially frozen when starting out and don't tear meat until right before adding dumplings, this keeps chicken moist. THIS ONE'S IS A WINNER TOO! Now you have three way to do it."

      "Add the tomato paste, the walnuts, and the granulated gluten. Season it with salt, pepper, a dash of soy sauce, and other seasonings you may want. Heat for a minute or two and then turn off the stove and let cool down a little.",
      "Remove the hard core of the cabbage. Ceave the cabbage in a bowl/pot with hot water and salt for 5-10 minutes (until the leaves can be removed easily, but it shouldn not stay too long because the leaves will be easily broken).",
      "Drain the cabbage and wait for it to cool off until you can work with it. Remove the spine from each leaf (leaving two halves with each leaf about the size of your hand). From the cabbage around 20 medium leaves should result. Some leaves may rip, but don't use those to add filling to, instead set aside.",
      "Chop the remaining onion and carrot, and the extra cabbage leaves that had been set aside because they had torn. Saute them in a large pot with a little oil. Add the tomato sauce and mix well. Put 2-3 bay leaves over this mixture. Turn off the heat and set aside (this is not the filling, but where the cabbage rolls will later be placed).",
      "On every cabbage leaf place about 1 Tbsp of filling (the first mixture sauteed and put aside from direction steps 1 and 2) and roll. Roll by folding one of the width sides over the filling and then roll the length of it. One side should be still open, stuff that side inside with your finger to close. If there is too much filling to stuff the opened side inside then you can remove a little bit of the filling.",
      "In the large pot with the other sauteed vegetables lay down the cabbage rolls in a circle. Don't have them touching the sides of the pot. Put the heart of the cabbage or more chopped cabbage in the center of the pot with the cabbage rolls around it. The cabbage in the middle is there to keep the cabbage rolls in place while boiling. Once a circle has been made in the pot you can put more cabbage rolls on top of the last ones making another circle, etc.",
      "Boil enough water in another pot to cover the cabbage rolls. Add the lemon juice to the water if you want to add a little sour taste to them. Add the boiling water and lemon juice to the pot with the samales and make sure the samales are covered by the water. Place a large soup plate over them that covers them all and keeps them in place in the pot.",

Place them in a bowl and toss with the chopped sage, olive oil and a light sprinkle of salt.

Ribs can be left whole in racks and layered, I have done 6 at a time, they still come out great. Rub the brown sugar mixture liberally over each rack. Then using heavy duty tin foil, cover the pan so that no heat escapes. I usually double wrap the ribs. Set in oven for 3 hours and can be up to 5 hours. Remove foil carefully and cut ribs into a manageable length to grill them. If you try to grill the rack without making it smaller, some of the ribs will fall apart and the meat will literally fall off the bones! Brush with your favorite barbecue sauce, I like homemade or Sweet Baby Ray's brand. Grill over a very hot gas or charcoal rill for 2 to 3 minutes per side. Serve with plenty of napkins. These ribs are amazing!"
