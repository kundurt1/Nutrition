This dish is really best made using a firm silky one.",
      "Now put a large saucepan on the heat and drizzle in 4 to 5 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil. When it's hot, add the cubes of eggplant, and as soon as they hit the pan, stir them around with a spoon so they are delicately coated with the oil and not soaked on one side only. Cook for about 7 or 8 minutes on a medium heat. Then add the garlic and onion. When they have a little color, add the canned tomatoes and the balsamic vinegar. Stir around and season carefully with salt and pepper. At this point, if you wanted to give the dish a little heat you could add some chopped fresh or crumbled dried chilli, but that's up to you. Add the basil stalks, and simmer the sauce nice and gently for around 15 minutes, then add the cream.",
      "While the sauce is simmering, bring a large pan of salted water to the boil and add the pasta. Cook according to the package instructions until it is soft but still holding its shape, then drain it, saving a little of the cooking water. I like to put the pasta back into the pot it was cooked in with a tiny bit of the cooking water and a drizzle of olive oil and move it around so it becomes almost dressed with the water and oil.",
      "At this point add the lovely tomato sauce to the pasta. By now the eggplant will have cooked into a creamy tomatoey pulp, which is just yum yum yum! (Jamie's words) Season carefully to taste with salt and pepper. Take the pan to the table, tear up the mozzarella and the fresh basil, and fold these in nicely for 30 seconds. Then very quickly serve into bowls. By the time your guests start to eat, the mozzarella will have started to melt and will be stringy and gorgeous and really milky-tasting. Just lovely with the tomatoes and eggplant. Serve at the table with a block of Parmesan cheese and a grater so that everyone can help themselves."

      "1. Preheat oven to 400*F. and turn at least once during the baking.",

      "3. Bake for 30-45 minutes in preheated oven. Cooking time and temperature will vary greatly on how thick you cut the wedges.",
      "My Note: Update: bake at 450*F., for 40-45 minutes, and turn at least once during the baking. If you use the 450*F. in the recipe, the fries will burn. I mixed everything in a gallon size ziploc bag. For the spices, I used freshly minced garlic (no onion powder), paprika, cumin, cayenne pepper, and chili powder. I used 6 potatoes (4 russet, 2 sweet) and 1/3 cup oil. I have cut the potatoes into sticks like normal fries and then baked them for 15 minutes, turned them over, and baked for another 15 minutes (the whole time at 425 since they're thinner than wedges), and I must say these are the tastiest fries ever! I also added salt and freshly ground pepper and garlic salt, and didn't measure it out- just kinda put on as much as looked good, and wow, were they tasty! I think the chili powder was what really put them over the top, so don't be shy with it, and remember that seasonings seem to lose some of their flavors when baked (which means put on more than you usually would)!",
      "So, if you cut your wedges small and thin - you will need to cut the temp and cooking time. But if you cut true (thick) wedges - follow the recipes directions (although I strongly encourage flipping the potatoes halfway through the process). For a super easy cleanup - I poured the oil and spices into a gallon size Ziploc bag and mixed it all together until well blended - then I added the cut potatoes and kneaded and shook the bag until all the potatoes were well and evenly coated. Then poured it into a 9x13 glass baking dish lined with foil. Minor adjustments: I used paprika, garlic powder, salt, freshly ground black pepper, a pinch of chili powder - mine is exceptionally potent, and cumin) -- The second time making this recipe I added fresh minced onion - and that was a very tasty addition too!",
      "FOR THOSE WHO THINK THIS RECIPE TOO BLAND: Take one onion for every 3 potatoes. Cut it in half lengthwise and cut it into slivers. Take all ingredients, including the onions, and put them in a zipper bag. Knead and shake until ingredients are thoroughly mixed. Proceed with recipe directions. The onions add quite a bit of zing as well as nutrition!",
      "I use my french fry cutter to cut the potatoes. I don't even measure the spices anymore. I bake them at 400*, for 15 min, then flip and bake for another 15 on the other side. However, I like my fries less on the crispy side, also using the french fry cutter makes all the fries about the same size for uniform cooking."

Add the melted, cooled chocolate and the vanilla. Mix well.",

The cake is done when it begins to pull away from the sides of the pans and springs back to a light touch. Cool layers in the pans for about 8 minutes.",

Place over simmering water and bring to a boil. Simmer for 12-15 minutes longer, stirring constantly, until the mixture thickens. Add the vanilla, coconut, and nuts. cool.",
      "To assemble the cake, place one layer on a cake stand and spread with frosting. Frost each layer completely, top and sides, as it is added to the cake.",
      "Note:",
      "You can also make the frosting in a regular saucepan, but be sure to stir it constantly, as it scorches easily. Also, you MUST use the finely grated fresh or frozen coconut, not canned or shredded, to be able to spread the frosting on the sides of the cake easlily.",
      "Another note from Trisha's sister, Gwen:",
      "Refrigerate the cake after it's frosted. Before serving, touch up any frosting that may have run down the sides.",
      "Hint: Trisha says if you use a lot of sweet baking chocolate, you can purchase it in bulk online at www.cocoasupply.com. Choose La Equatoriale-Dark Chocolate Coverture. The cost, including postage, is half what you would probaly pay in grocery stores. Share the large bar with your friends who bake. I haven't checked this out, but you might want to."

Cover evenly with Hot Salad Dressing. With wide spatula turn potatoes carefully in the dressing to coat completely. Let stand in a warm place, covered, for half an hour. At serving time, sprinkle with 1 cup chopped green pepper, 4 cups finely slivered celery, and 2 cups diced cucumber. Carefully toss to mix ingredients. Adjust seasoning, if necessary, with salt, pepper, and cayenne. Separately grate the yolks and whites of 12 hard cooked eggs and sprinkle on the salad in patterns through a paper doily, keeping the colors separate. Makes about 50 servings, 2/3 cup each.",

In the pan, mix together 1/2 cup flour, 1/4 cup sugar, 1 Tablespoon each dry mustard and salt, 1/2 teaspoon pepper, and a generous dash of cayenne. Gradually add 1 quart hot milk, stirring until smooth. Cook, stirring, until the sauce bubbles and thickens. Cook 10 minutes, stirring often. Beat 4 eggs lightly, warm them with a little hot sauce, and stir them into the pan. Cook for a minute or two. Remove the pan from the hot water and add 1 cup full strength distilled vinegar (not the mild seasoned type). Swirl in 1/4 cup butter. If the sauce seems too thick, add a few tablespoons of water to thin it as desired. Taste and adjust the seasoning with more salt and pepper to taste. Makes 1 1/2 quarts.",

Dice, peeling is not necessary.",
      "A note about the tamarind soup mix: If you're vegetarian or sensitive to MSG check the ingredients on the packet. I think they all have MSG, and most have pork, fish or beef in them. I found tamarind broth cubes (listed as tamarind powder b/c Zaar doesn't recognize it) which have less of those things in them which is great, but the best is if you can find real tamarind. I have found both of these in Asian grocery stores in the US, though you can occasionally find them in the ethnic foods isle of a grocery store. If you're using tamarind remove the hard outer shell. The insides feel and sometimes smell like the insides of raisins or prunes. If the tamarind tastes sweet it's not going to give you the right flavor for the soup, but can still be close with kalamansi or lemon juice added. It should be a sour taste. Soak the tamarind pulp, seeds and all, in 1 cup of warm water. Mash this with a fork to remove most of the tamarind from the seeds. Fish out the seeds and the membranes and reserve the liquid to add after potatoes are cooked.",
      "Cook potatoes in water with a touch of salt for about 10 minutes, or until almost cooked through.",
      "Add remaining veggies and seasoning and cook 10-15 minutes more, or until veggies are cooked to desired consistency.",
      "Taste broth and adjust water and tamarind seasoning and salt to your liking. Keep in mind that if you're serving this with rice, as I always do, you probably want more intense flavors and a more stew like consistency.",
      "I typically double this recipe since it keeps well in the refrigerator and it gets eaten quite quickly even with just me and my husband. It is important to cook the potatoes before you cook the other veggies because the acid from the tomatoes and the tamarind mix prevent the potatoes from ever cooking through if you add them straight away. The quantities are still an approximation as I've never measured, so if you make this I'd love if you gave me feedback about your input on amounts of water, what seasoning you used etc."

When done, the chicken should be cooked through and the sauce lightly charred in a few spots and chewy in others. Serve warm, piled high on a colorful platter, as finger food."

Once the pan is lined and you have slack foil on the sides, pour in all the pork and juice and close the foil up over the meat. It wouldn't hurt to add ANOTHER layer of foil and tuck the meat in on the inside of the pan. This prevents any steam from escaping, thus properly allowing the food to slow cook perfectly.

I just flatten mine with my mallet in between saran wrap, but you can use what method you like best.",

I like to use a couple of tooth picks to secure it at the end.",
