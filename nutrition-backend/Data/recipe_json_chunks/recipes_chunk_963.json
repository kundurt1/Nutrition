Allow noodles to soak approximately 6 minutes, OR until soft enough to bend easily, but still firm and 'undercooked' by regular standards (this is the key to good pad Thai, so be sure not to over-soak or boil the noodles. They will finish cooking later). Drain and rinse noodles briefly with cold water to keep from sticking. Set aside.",
      "Heat a wok or large frying pan over medium-high heat. Drizzle in the oil and swirl around, then add the garlic, chili, galangal/ginger, and half of green onion (or just the white parts), reserving remaining for later. Stir-fry 1 minute to release the fragrance.",

When sauce has been absorbed and noodles are cooked, fold in the bean sprouts (you want them to stay crispy).",

Before eating, top with remaining green onion and squeeze over the lime wedge, then finish with a generous sprinkling of chopped/ground nuts. For those whole like it extra spicy, serve with Thai chili sauce on the side, and ENJOY!",
      "*Note about Tamarind: Although today we associate pad Thai sauce with tamarind, in this authentic southern-Thai recipe, the sourness comes from a combination of rice vinegar and lime juice instead. Traditionally (several hundred years ago), pad Thai was made in just this way - without tamarind - and versions of this original formula can still be found in various regions of Thailand. This particular recipe was taught to me by a local Thai chef in south-western Phuket, Thailand.",

Once you have the rolled mixture into shape, tighten the roll and fold one end and then the other. Do this until you have finished all the millet.",

      "-\tHeat the olive oil in a very large frying pan* and drop the pork cubes into it. Add 2 tablespoons of Teriyaki sauce, a pinch or two of salt and cook until well browned.",
      "-\tAdd the shredded cabbage, bean sprouts, onions, garlic and carrots. Stir thoroughly and then add the remaining 2 tablespoons of virgin olive oil over the top. Stir thoroughly again. Other cooks like to mix the meat with the raw veggies and let the final frying cook the vegetables. However, I like to cook them a little first to get rid of some of the moisture (especially in the cabbage and sprouts). I have found that, if I get rid of some of the moisture first, the veggies will not shrink as much inside the wrapper later during frying and gives me a much firmer roll without large, empty pockets of air.",
      "-\tSprinkle the Kosher salt, ginger and black pepper over the top. Add the soy sauce and stir until everything is evenly distributed.",
      "-\tStir the mixture well several times until the cabbage becomes somewhat soft.",
      "-\tWhen the mixture has reached the desired consistency, turn off the heat and add the shrimp. Stir well and allow mixture to rest for about 10 minutes.",
      "-\tHave a small bowl of water ready. Take an egg roll wrapper out of the package; lay it flat so that one of the corners is pointing at your belly. Dip your fingers into the bowl of water and run them along all four edges of the wrapper so that they are all nice and moist.",
      "-\tPlace (approximately) 2 to 3 tablespoons of the filling in the middle of the wrapper so that it forms an elongated hill that comes to about 1 inch from the left and right sides. Fold the bottom corner (the one near your belly) over the mixture and press the corner lightly into the middle of the wrapper. Fold the left and right corners of the rolled wrapper so they end up pointing at each other on top of the folded wrapper. Using slight pressure from your fingers, \"roll\" the wrapped mixture towards the top until you end up with your roll. Keep it as tight as possible as you roll but not too much or you may break the wrapper and it will be a mess when you fry it. (Holy Mung Beans, Batman! I hope that makes sense!).",
      "-\tFOR FRYING: I use vegetable shortening or canola oil, whichever I have on hand at the time. I also use my deep fryer but, in a pinch, I have used a deep frying pan with enough frying oil in it to completely cover the egg rolls. I have also heard that peanut oil does a great job but I am a cheapskate and don't want to spend the extra bucks.",
      "-\tFry on medium-high heat. I have found that anything lower makes the wrappers a little soft and chewy and I like mine nice and crispy.",
      "-\tNow, you will find that egg rolls can be temperamental and some will follow basic orders but some won't. As you fry a batch, you will find that some of your egg rolls have turned over by themselves and some have not. You will also find that some will stay in the position once you turn them but some will absolutely refuse to turn; it seems that no matter how many times you turn them, they will turn back leaving the whitish, uncooked belly exposed. For those rebels, you may need to turn them and hold them under the oil with your utensil until they stay turned.",
      "-\tFry until golden brown and \"bumpy\". Place on top of a cookie sheet covered with a thick layer of paper towels and let them \"drain\" for 10 minutes or so. Serve and enjoy!",
      "*I use my big Paella pan (see picture) which requires three burners to use. Otherwise, you may need to cook the filling in a couple of batches if your frying pan is not big enough. At times, your frying pan may not appear to be big enough but, after the cabbage and bean sprouts cook for a few minutes, the mixture will shrink so you may be able to keep adding the fresh veggies slowly and cook it all in one batch.).",
      "HINT: When filling the egg rolls, I place my frying pan (or Paella pan) on a flat counter. Then, I place a piece of board about 1.5 inches thick under one side of the pan. This puts the pan on a slight angle which allows the juices and sauce to drain to the lower end. I then start using the filling from the higher side with a slotted spoon. This method allows me to use dryer filling without the sloppiness of wet cabbage."

      "Measure your flour, salt, garlic powder, parsley, and baking powder into a big bowl. Stir the dry ingredients together so that they are evenly distributed throughout the flour. Now, pour in the milk. Stir with a big spoon until you have a ball of dough that leaves the sides of the bowl. You may have to dust the ball of dough with a little flour if it seems sticky to you. Gently knead the ball of dough right there in the bowl 5 or 6 times. Now place your dough on the counter. You may use a piece of waxed paper under the dough if you like. Using a rolling pin roll out the dough to a rectangular shape. If the edges become uneven, use your hands to reshape into a rectangle. It doesn't have to be perfect. You are aiming for a rectangle that will fi into a 9- by 13-inch pan. When you get the dough the right size, set it aside.",
      "Meanwhile, place the margarine in the 9- by 13-inch pan and place the pan in a 425F oven to melt the margarine. When the margarine is melted, carefully remove the pan from the oven, so as not to burn yourself. Sprinkle the second teaspoon of garlic powder and the 1/2 teaspoon of salt into the pan. You do not have to use the extra salt. Now, very carefully, lay your rectangle of dough into the pan, over top of the margarine. Next cut the rectangle into narrow strips. One method of doing this is to cut the dough in half, then cut each half again, quartering the dough, and then cut each quarter into narrow strips. The margarine will creep up between the strips. This is normal. It is what gives these bread sticks their texture. After cutting your strips, place the pan in the oven, still at 425F, and bake them for 20 minutes. They will be browned and crispy when they are done.",
      "The parsley is simply for decoration. It makes the bread sticks look more gourmet, but it adds little to the flavor or the texture. Leave it out if you don't have any, or are running low. If desired, you may sprinkle the bread sticks with a little bit of parmesan cheese before or after baking. This tastes good, but once again, is optional."

I prefer to put mine in a large plastic bag - press all the air out and seal - then pound away. I use a meat mallet, but a heavy pan, rolling pin or pretty much anything heavy will work. I pound as thin as possible without breaking the chicken up or making any holes in the breast. Salt and pepper well and then just set to the side as you make the filling.",
      "Chorizo -- In a large saute pan (I use a heavy oven proof pan that way everything is cooked in one pan) If you don't have one, use what you have on hand. Add 1/2 teaspoon olive oil and saute the chorizo on medium heat until golden brown 4-5 minutes. Remove to a plate lined with a paper towel to drain any excess grease. Pour out the grease from the pan.",
      "Shrimp -- Add to the same pan, the remaining 1/2 teaspoon olive oil and put back on medium heat. Add the shrimp and onion and saute just a couple of minutes until the shrimp are just beginning to turn pink - It won't take long. NOTE: You can use any size shrimp, as long as you end up with 1 cup diced. As soon as they start to turn pink, remove from the heat and add the olives, parsley, bread crumbs, salt (go easy, the olives are salty) and pepper. Mix well and remove to a small bowl so the shrimp do not continue to cook. Add the chorizo to the shrimp mixture and stir well. Add a drizzle of olive oil if necessary to hold the dressing together.",
      "Sauce -- In the same pan, add the shallots and white wine to deglaze the pan and cook just a minute if that. Add the tomatoes, chicken broth and parsley. Remove from the heat.",
      "Stuffing -- Lay out the chicken breasts and top with the shrimp and chorizo filling. Roll up the chicken and secure with a toothpick. The filling will fill 4-5 breasts depending on the size. If there is any leftover, just freeze it for another time.",
      "Bake -- Heat the oven to 350, middle shelf. If using a oven proof saute pan, add the chicken seam side down right in the pan with the sauce. Use a spoon and spoon some of the sauce over the chicken. If using a casserole dish, add the chicken seam side down and pour the tomato sauce over the top.",
      "Cover with foil and bake for 30-40 minutes (the thickness of the chicken and the type of pan can affect cooking times). The last 10 minutes, uncover and top each chicken roll with cheese (I love manchego, but Monterey Jack will work just fine) and cook until bubbly and the cheese is melted.",

      "Bake your pie shells according to package directions and let them cool completely.",
      "While your pie shells are baking, melt the butter in a skillet over medium and add the pecans and coconut. Toast your coconut and pecans in the butter until they become golden brown (roughly 10 minutes). Keep stirring constantly -- these can scorch easily. Set them aside to let them cool.",
      "In a large mixing bowl, beat the cream cheese and sweetened condensed milk together until creamy. Fold in your whipped topping by hand -- be careful not to \"break it down\" too much, but still get it incorporated nicely (it's such a fine line, isn't it?).",
      "Have your baked and cooled pie shells ready to fill -- it's time to start layering!",
      "Start by using 1/2 of your cream cheese mixture and divide that evenly between the two pie shells (so, technically, each pie will get 1/4 of the mixture).",
      "Drizzle 1/4 of your caramel sauce over the cream cheese mixture on each pie, use 1/4 per pie and 1/2 the jar total for this layer.",
      "Sprinkle 1/4 of the pecan/coconut mixture over the caramel on each pie. Again, use 1/2 of the mixture total.",
      "Repeat the layers, using the remaining ingredients. Place pies in the freezer overnight.",
      "You'll pull them out about about 20-30 minutes before serving to let them thaw a bit. You can store them in your freezer for about a month. I double wrap mine in Press-N-Seal and then add an additional layer of foil on top of that, to prevent any freezer burn."
