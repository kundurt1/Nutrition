      "When I was young, this old French classic was still - though in a quiet way - very much in vogue.",
      "I dare say it was because the novelty of using so many garlic cloves had not worn off; it seemed somehow dangerously excessive.",
      "Even so, I don't think anyone would think it quite unremarkable now to put 40 cloves of garlic in a casserole.",
      "Certainly, if you peeled and chopped - let alone minced - the garlic, it would be inedible, but garlic cloves cooked encased in their skins grow sweet and caramelly as they cook, like savory bonbons in their sticky wrappers, rather than breathing out acrid heat.",
      "This is a cozy supper, not a caustic one.",
      "This dish entered my canon under someone else's auspices.",
      "A few years ago, for the fortieth birthday of a then-colleague and friend of mine, Nick Thorogood, his partner asked everyone to contribute something written expressly for purpose to be compiled in a fat tribute of a book.",
      "Since most of Nick's and my conversation dwells, with almost fetid passion, on food, it seemed only proper to write a recipe for him.",
      "And given that it was his fortieth birthday, this seemed the right recipe.",
      "It is not quite the classic version (not that there is only one: food is as variable as the people who cook it) but it sticks to the basic principles.",
      "Maybe because the white meat on chicken tends towards the utterly tasteless these days, I prefer to use not a whole chicken, but thigh portions only.",
      "Naturally, this wouldn't make sense if you were raising your own chickens, then slaughtering them for the pot, as was the custom when this recipe came into being (and very good it would have been, too, for adding oomph to an old bird) but if you're following the contemporary shopping model, it works very well.",
      "For some reason, I veer towards recipes that can easily be cooked in one of my wide and shallow cast-iron Dutch ovens and this fits the bill perfectly.",
      "By all means, add some steamed or boiled potatoes alongside if you wish, but I'd prefer, by far, a baguette or two to be torn up and dunked into the flavorsome juices; though don't rule out the option of sourdough toast, which is the perfect vehicle for spreading the sweet-cooked garlic onto.",
      "Otherwise, some green beans or baby peas or a plain green salad is all you need for a sure-fire salivation-inducing supper.",
      "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.",
      "Heat the oil on the stovetop in a wide, shallow ovenproof and flameproof Dutch oven (that will ultimately fit all the chicken in one layer, and that has a lid), and sear the chicken over a high heat, skin-side down.",
      "This may take 2 batches, so transfer the browned pieces to a bowl as you go.",
      "Once the chicken pieces are seared, transfer them all to the bowl.",
      "Finely slice the scallions, put them into the Dutch oven and quickly stir-fry them with the leaves torn from a few sprigs of thyme.",
      "Put 20 of the unpeeled cloves of garlic (papery excess removed) into the pan, top with the chicken pieces skin-side up, then cover with the remaining 20 cloves of garlic.",
      "Add the vermouth (or white wine) to any oily, chickeny juices left in the bowl.",
      "Swish it around and pour this into the pan too.",
      "Sprinkle with the salt, grind over the pepper, and add a few more sprigs of thyme.",
      "Put on the lid and cook in the oven for 1 1/2 hours.",
      "Make Ahead Note: Chicken can be browned and casserole assembled 1 day ahead.",
      "Cover tightly and store in the refrigerator.",
      "Season with salt and pepper and warm the pan gently on the stovetop for 5 minutes before baking as directed in recipe.",
      "Making Leftovers Right: If I do have any chicken left over - and I don't think I've ever had more than 1 thigh portion - I take out the bone then and there and put the chicken in the refrigerator.",
      "Later (within a day or two), I make a garlicky soup, by removing the chicken, adding some chicken broth or water to the cold, jelled juices, placing it over a high heat and, when that's hot, shredding the chicken into it and heating it through thoroughly, till everything is piping hot.",
      "You can obviously add rice or pasta.",
      "Otherwise, mash any leftover garlic into the concentrated liquid (which will be solid when cold), chop up some leftover chicken, and put it all into a saucepan with some cream.",
      "Reheat gently until everything is piping hot, and use as a pasta sauce or serve with rice."

      "Knead the dough by hand on a breadboard or tabletop, until it has the consistency of an earlobe, or by machine until the dough forms a ball that follows the path of the hook around the bowl.",
      "You may need to add a little extra water or flour to achieve the desired consistency.",
      "Kneading with take about 10 to 12 minutes by machine.",
      "Allow the dough to rest in a bowl of cold water for about 10 minutes.",
      "While the dough is resting, prepare the stock.",
      "In a large pot, bring to boil 3 quarts of water.",
      "Add the tamari, ginger, and kombu, and cook for 15 minutes.",
      "Remove from heat and allow to cool.",
      "This stock must be cold before it's used.",

      "To wash out the starch, use warm water to begin with.",
      "Warm water loosens the dough and makes the task easier.",
      "Knead the dough, immersed in water, in the bowl.",
      "When the water turns milky, drain it off and refill the bowl with fresh water.",
      "In the final rinses, use cold water to tighten the gluten.",
      "If you wish, save the bran by straining the water through a fine sieve; the bran will be left behind.",
      "Save the starch by allowing the milky water to settle in the bottom of the bowl; slowly pour off the water and collect the starch, which you can use for thickening soups, sauces, and stews.",
      "When kneading, remember to work toward the center of the dough so that it does not break into pieces.",
      "After about eight changes of water, you will begin to feel the dough become firmer and more elastic.",
      "The water will no longer become cloudy as you knead it.",
      "To make sure you have kneaded and rinsed it enough, lift the dough out of the water and squeeze it.",
      "The liquid oozing out should be clear, not milky.",
      "To shape the seitan, lightly oil a 1-pound loaf pan.",
      "Place the rinsed seitan in the pan and let it rest until the dough relaxes.",
      "(After the dough has been rinsed for the last time in cold water, the gluten will have tightened and the dough will be tense, tough, and resistant to taking on any other shape. )",
      "After it has rested for 10 minutes, it will be much more flexible.",
      "Seitan is cooked in two steps.",
      "In the first step, the dough is put into a large pot with about 3 quarts of plain, boiling water.",
      "Boil the seitan for about 30 to 45 minutes, or until it floats to the surface.",
      "Drain the seitan and cut it into usable pieces (steaks, cutlets, 1-inch chunks, or whatever) or leave whole.",
      "Return the seitan to the cold tamari stock.",
      "Bring the stock to a boil, lower temperature, and simmer in the stock for 1 1/2 to 2 hours (45 minutes if the seitan is cut into small pieces).",
      "The second cooking step may also be done in a pressure cooker, in which case it would take between 30 to 45 minutes.",
      "To store seitan, keep it refrigerated, immersed in the tamari stock.",
      "Seitan will keep indefinitely if it is brought to a boil in the tamari stock and boiled for 10 minutes twice a week.",
      "Otherwise, use it within eight or nine days.",
      "VARIATIONS: Instead of boiling the seitan in plain water and then stock, let the seitan drain for a while after it has been rinsed.",
      "Slice it and either deep-fry or saute the slices until both sides are brown.",
      "Then cook it in the tamari stock according to the recipe.",
      "Seitan also may be cooked (at the second step) in a broth flavored with carrots, onion, celery, garlic, tamari, and black pepper, which will give it a flavor similar to pot roast.",
      "Shiitake mushrooms may also be added to the stock."

      "At this point, I like to remove any excess fat, membrane, or cartilage that may remain, being careful not to remove any skin.",

      "The breast portion looks a bit like a valentine's heart with wings.",

      "To broil, season with whatever you like, broil on low for about 15 minutes skin side down.",
      "Turn and broil skin side up taking care not to burn the skin.",
      "Use an instant read thermometer.",
      "For me, chicken is done when it registers 165 degrees internally.",
