Turn and brush with more of the soy-sauce mixture. Continue cooking until the fish is browned and just barely done (the fish should still be translucent in the center), about 3 minutes longer. Brush with the remaining soy-sauce mixture and serve.",
      "Fish Alternatives: If you can find sablefish--a rich, succulent fish also called black cod, though it's very different from regular cod--by all means use it. Other alternatives are bluefish or mackerel fillets, but don't turn them during cooking or they may fall apart.",
      "In Place of Mirin",
      "This is one case where the substitute really is just as good as the original ingredient. In fact, in our taste tests we could barely tell the difference between this recipe prepared with mirin (sweet Asian cooking wine) and with sweet sherry. You can also use six tablespoons dry sherry and add an additional three tablespoons sugar.",
      "Wine Recommendation: Soy sauce is notoriously tough to pair with wine, which is one reason beer is so often served with Japanese food. A moderately priced sparkling wine from California is another possibility. This will stand up to the soy sauce and cut through the richness of the salmon."

This wine has soft tannins and juicy plum and black cherry flavors that meld with the fruity combination of avocado and tomato. -Jeffery Lindenmuth"

Lay 10 cutouts in a concentric circle around rim of pie, barely covering the border and barely overlapping one another; brush with egg wash, so they adhere to one another. Make a second circle the same way with 5 cutouts, overlapping the first by about 1/2 in. Set 1 cutout in the center.",
      "Freeze pie and remaining cutouts uncovered until cutouts feel very firm, 20 to 30 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 350\u00b0 with racks in center and lower third. Brush pie with egg wash again and sprinkle with remaining 1 tbsp. sugar.",
      "Bake cutouts on baking sheet until well browned, 20 to 22 minutes. Bake pie until crust is deeply browned, juices are bubbling, and an instant-read thermometer inserted in center reaches 180\u00b0, 1 1/2 hours; after 45 minutes, set a drip pan on rack under pie, and after about 1 1/4 hours, tent pie with foil. Cool pie on a rack at least 2 1/2 hours. Serve with extra cutouts for nibbling.",
