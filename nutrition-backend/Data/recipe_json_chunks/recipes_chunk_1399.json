(Note that if you simmer uncovered, you'll need to add a cup of water every 15 minutes or so, as the water depletes.) If you like softer eggs, simmer for just 40-45 minutes, with the pot covered. Be warned that these eggs are never the soft, bright yellow yolk eggs you get \r\nfrom hard-boiling for just a few minutes. They often have that greenish tinge that I've learned some people abhor -- it's only natural because they cook for much longer.",

(Note: If your one true love is soft-boiled eggs, you could theoretically simply skip step 4, heat the mixture until warm and flavors have a chance to disburse, then let the soft-boiled eggs steep overnight in the liquid in the refrigerator. The flavor should still come through, and the eggs would be less cooked. If you try this, I would love to know your results!)"

Generally, the higher the temp, the more cheese you will get. (But you risk scorching bottom of pot and leaving ricotta with that scorched taste). If you prefer to go on looks, wait until you see curds separate from the whey (when you dip your spoon in, you should see white blobs/specks on top and a milky liquid underneath). At that point, take off heat and put on back burner for about 30 minutes. The less time, the less firm the ricotta will be. You can leave it for up to an hour, depending on your tastes.",

      "You will have extra ricotta - its worth making a big batch, because it will go quick!! If you want to just make enough for recipe, you can reduce quantities by 1/4 and should have enough for bread. It takes a few tries to properly develop the curds, so I would recommend making the bigger batch to be safe."

Wrap tightly in plastic wrap, gently smoosh into the rough shape of a rectangle (this will make your life easier later on) and refrigerate for at least an hour and up to 3 days.",

Slice dough into two pieces, one about two-thirds of the dough, the other about one-third of the dough. The fact that you wrapped this in the shape of a rectangle should help make this and rolling it out as a rectangle a little easier.",

You want to be able to fold excess dough over to create the outside crust. Don't be scared, it doesn't have to be perfect. Move the dough and add more flour to your work surface as necessary to prevent sticking. Once you're there (or as close to it as you're going to get), transfer the dough to the sheet pan. Roll out the second slab of dough to approximately fit the top of the pie in a similar fashion.",

Next, brush the top lightly with heavy cream, poke it all over with a fork and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Into the oven is goes for about an hour. Check it after about 50 minutes. If the top is nicely golden, you're good. I like to err on the side of well-browned versus just-bronzed, but that's up to you."

Repeat the entire blanching and cooling sequence twice for thin-skinned Meyer lemons or tangerines; three times for oranges, regular lemons, or tangelos; or four times for grapefruit. (Blanching rids the fruit of excess harshness and astringency and tenderizes it. The number of blanchings is not cast in stone. With experience, you may increase or decrease the number to get the tenderness and flavor that you like. Even fruit of the same variety varies in texture, skin thickness, and bitterness, so use my guidelines as you will.)",

Whisk in the flour and use to fill the toastries. You can also use any other unsweetened, cooked fruit puree by substituting it for the apple-pear sauce. To use a purchased jam, increase the amount to 1 cup, omit the added sugar and whisk in the flour."

Keeping the scales on, crack an egg into the yoghurt mixture. Add all of the milk, next. Stir 'em together (but don't use your hands for this bit)! You want the total weight of the liquid ingredients to be around 450mls - a little more or less is no bother; if you use a massive egg, you'll use less milk.",

Resist the urge to open the oven door. If you so desire, a handful of oats sprinkled over the batter before it cooks gives the bread a lovely rustic look.",
      "When the bread is finished, it should be hard to the touch on the outside, but with a little give when poked. A knife stuck into it will come out clean, and not gummy. Free the loaf from the tin, place it on a cooling rack, and cover with a tea towel. Let it sit for at least two hours before cutting - if you cut it while it's still warm, you'll end up with delicious crumbs and not much else, and all your hard work will've been for naught.",
      "Serve with butter and jam, or with fish (not at the same time, though, yuck). Or just eat it however you want, the important thing is that you enjoy it!"

It smells great when grilled and gives the chicken wonderful color.",
      "Next, prepare the bird. Butterflying a chicken is pretty easy. It is best done with a set of really sharp kitchen shears. If you are more of a visual person, I would look up a youtube video that shows you how to do this. \r\n\r\nBut, simply put, starting from the rear, cut down each side of the spine. Stay as close to the bone as you can so as not to waste any meat. This will effectively remove the spine. \r\n\r\nAfter the spine has been removed, open up the bird as far as it will go, but be gentle, you don't want to break the skin. You will notice that there is a small tendon near the top that prevents the bird from opening flat. Once you see that just nick it with a sharp knife. This should allow the bird to open up. But again, be gentle. Slicing too deep here could mess with the cooking time and leave a part of the chicken dry and a big bummer.\r\n\r\nAfter this, pat the chicken dry with some paper towel.\r\nThen apply the rub to the bird on both sides. Rub the rub into the bird gently but firmly. I suggest using a spoon to scoop the rub onto the chick then rub it in with your hands. If you can keep your raw chicken hand out of the rub you can save it for another day.\r\n\r\ndrizzle the bird with some olive oil. Have a small bowl and brush with more oil (or melted butter) for basting throughout the grilling process.",
      "Let the chicken rest, and take in all that flavor from the rub as you prepare the grill. I always use wood charcoal but gas would obviously work fine. At this point in the process, it's absolutely imperative that you have 1-4 beers.\r\n\r\nArrange the coals in your grill so that you have two different heat zones going on. One very hot, the other medium. \r\n\r\nStart by cooking the bird for 5 minutes or so over the hot coals, meaty side down. The idea is to get a nice sear on this. Little bit of char is alright. Flip it over and do the same on the other side.\r\n\r\nThen move the bird to the more tame side of the grill and cook until done. Flip and baste frequently to avoid burning and drying out. This usually takes about 40-60 minutes - depending on the size of the bird. The best way to tell if it's done is to use a thermometer. You're looking for 165F or 75C.\r\n\r\nPull the chicken off and allow to rest for at least 10 minutes before carving and serving. \r\n\r\nAs I mentioned above. The sides are up to you but I like a onion-garlic couscous and a simple tomato-cucumber salad."

      "When the water has boiled, gently add the eggs and boil for exactly 6 minutes and 30 seconds (if you like your eggs less runny you can do up to 6 minutes and 50 seconds as the original recipe suggests). Gently stir for the first minute or so, so the heat distributes evenly. While the eggs continue to cook, prepare a bowl with cold water and ice. When the eggs are done, gently transfer them to the ice bath. Let them cool and then peel them in the water (will help prevent breakage). Once peeled, place the eggs in the soy sauce mixture. You can add up to an additional ~ 1/4 c more water so that the eggs are mostly covered by the soy liquid. Marinate in the refrigerator for 2 - 4 hours.",
      "For the fried onions: Thinly slice the onions horizontally so you have rings of onion. In a shallow bowl or plate, add the whole wheat flour. Lightly spritz some water or run the onion rings under water and then shake off the water. The reason I suggest this is because if they are a little damp (not wet) they will pick up more flour. Place the damp onion rings in the flour and coat the rings.",
      "Heat a skillet to medium high/high heat. I use a nonstick skillet on medium high heat. You don't want the onions to cook too fast and burn, nor do you want hot oil splashed in your face. Once hot, add the olive oil. Then place the onions in the oil, making sure the rings aren't overlapping or touching each other. Fry until golden brown and then place on a paper towel to cool.",
      "For the greens: Heat a skillet on medium high. Once hot, add the dash of sesame oil and grated garlic. Add the garlic first so it sautees for a moment and then add the sliced greens. Sautee until the greens become tender. After a minute or so, add the 2 tbsp of vegetable broth. This will help wilt and cook the greens and add some flavor. Once tender, put the greens in a small dish and set aside.",
      "For the oats: Heat the vegetable broth in a small pot. Note, if you like your oats soupy or like porridge, you can add an extra 1/2 c of broth. Once boiling, turn off the heat and add the oats and flax, giving it one gentle stir to combine. Then let the oats sit for a few minutes in the hot broth, and then stir again. The water should be absorbed and the oats cooked. Combine everything with the warm oats and top with flaky sea salt and pepper."

Cradle one avocado half in palm of one hand, and have sharp knife in other hand. Gently score the avocado lengthwise, all the way through the flesh, just til you reach the shell with about 1/2\" between the cuts. Using a soup spoon, scoop out the avocado in one or two scoops.

      "To make the pie dough: Place the flour into a medium sized bowl. Work the cold chopped butter into the flour by hand or with a pastry cutter until there are no chunks of butter left, the mixture looks damp and crumbly, and it clumps when squeezed in your hand. Stir the salt into the water until it is dissolved, and pour into the flour mixture. Stir with a spoon until large pieces form, and then mix together by hand until a uniform ball of dough forms.\r\n\r\nSet aside the egg yolk and milk for the egg wash to be used later.\r\n\r\nRoll the dough out to about 1/8 inch thick on a lightly floured surface. Grab 8 disposable 5 inch aluminum pie tins and turn them over on top of the dough and trace around the tops of the pie tins with a paring knife, marking about 1/2 inch beyond the edges of the tins. Place the dough rounds onto a sheet pan and set in the fridge to chill.\r\n\r\nPreheat oven to 375 degrees and set aside 2 sheet pans.",
      "To make the filling: In a large pot over medium heat, melt the butter. Add the minced garlic and diced onion and let cook until the onion has softened. Whisk in the flour until there are no lumps, and let cook over medium heat until bubbly and lightly golden brown. Pour in the chicken stock and whisk until smooth. Add the apple cider vinegar, salt, pepper, and sage. Turn heat to low and let simmer.\r\n\r\nPlace the sweet potato and Yukon gold potato into a shallow microwave safe container. Add water until the potatoes are just submerged, and microwave on high for 6 minutes. Stir, heat 6 minutes more. The potatoes should be fork tender but not mushy. Drain well and set aside.\r\n\r\nRemove the sausage from its casing, and in a large skillet over medium heat, cook the sausage until no longer pink. Break apart into small chunks with a spatula as it cooks, and drain off any liquid once the sausage has cooked fully. Turn up to high heat and cook until the sausage starts to brown, stirring occasionally. Set aside.\r\n\r\nStir the cooked potatoes and sausage into the thickened stock mixture. Slice the apple in half and remove the core and seeds. Leaving the skin on, dice the apple into small pieces and add to the rest of the filling. Stir to combine everything, taste to adjust seasoning if desired.",
      "To assemble: Take pie dough rounds from the fridge and with a sharp paring knife, cut out jack-o-lantern faces from each round. Divide the filling between the 8 pie tins and set a pie dough round on top of each filled tin. If the dough is too firm to work with, allow to sit briefly to soften. Fold the overhang of crust over the edge of the tin and press lightly to seal to the underside edge of the pie tin. Press firmly with your thumb all around the top edge of the crust to seal well. Beat the egg yolk and milk together until smooth, and brush the egg wash over the pie dough.\r\n\r\nBake the pot pies in the preheated oven for 40-55 minutes, or until the filling is bubbling and the crust is golden brown. Allow the pies to rest for 5-10 minutes before eating."

Don't add too much cream - the dough should be cohesive and slightly wet, but not sticky. Gather the dough into a ball and divide it in half.

Without stirring, cook until the caramel turns amber - give the pan an occasional swirl with the handle. Depending on how comfortable you are with making caramel, and the heat level, this process can take about 8-15 minutes - Do Not wander off as the caramel is cooking. Once the caramel turns amber, remove the pan from the heat and slowly whisk in the cream. As you add the cream the caramel will sputter, so be very careful! Keep whisking until the caramel is smooth. If you notice any large clumps, return to low heat and whisk until everything smooths out. Stir in the bits of butter until melted. Pour the hot caramel into a medium heatproof bowl and set it aside to cool as you prepare the rest of the pie. {Note: Don't refrigerate the caramel or it will get too hard to \"dollop\" and spread.} Whilst preparing the filling and rolling the dough, give the caramel a good stir from time to time.",

Heat the oven to 220C. On a tray put out 4 sheets of parchment paper each about 50 cm long. Toss the half cooked pasta with the sauce and divide evenly between the pieces of paper, placing the pasta on half of each sheet, fold the paper over the top and start rolling and folding the edges of the paper to create a sealed container from which steam cannot escape. Place in the hot oven for 6 minutes. To serve put each paper package on a plate and allow the diners to open it themselves. The aroma released from the packet is truly magnificent. Serve with olive oil and a pepper grinder for to guests to add themselves."

Season the leg liberally with freshly cracked pepper and salt.\r\n4. Place on a roasting pan, preferably with rack.\r\n5. Add a cup of water.\r\n6. Roast at 425 degrees for 15 -20 minutes.\r\n7. Lower temperature to 325 and roast for another 1 to an 1 and a half depending on your oven and meat thermometer.\r\n8. Let rest at least 10 minutes before serving.\r\n9. You can also add water at the end to make the drippings more liquid. Use your personal taste test to make sure that you do not add to little or too much water.",

Add two cups of dripping and broth, whisk until smooth, bring to a boil reduce heat and serve! Many Icelandic cooks will only use drippings and water which I think is very good, but if you have homemade broth on hand I think it adds more flavor to the gravy. 1 cup of pan dripping and 1 cup of broth is a good combo.\r\n4. *in Iceland they use a browning coloring to make the gravy brown, which is not natural. This gravy might look like chicken gravy but it is not and has a very deep rich flavor even though the color is light"

When the fragrance of the dry spices becomes noticeable, remove the skillet from the heat. Transfer the spices to a spice grinder and blend until they are finely ground.",

Pulse the food processor until the ingredients are roughly chopped. If you can't fit all the Thai basil and cilantro in the food processor at one time, add and pulse it in batches.",
      "Add the shallots, garlic, sugar, fish sauce, and ginger to the food processor. Blend all the ingredients for 2-3 minutes, until the curry paste looks homogenous and fairly smooth. Pause the food processor and scrape down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula as needed.",
      "You should have about 2.5 cups of curry paste. If you want, you can freeze it in ice cube molds, and it will last in your freezer for months. To make a portion of green curry, you will need about 1 ice cube worth of curry paste (about 2 tablespoons).",
      "To make the curry, set a large pot or dutch oven over high heat and add just enough canola oil to coat the bottom of the pot. When the oil just begins to faintly smoke, add the shrimp in a single even layer. Let the shrimp cook, undisturbed, until the underside of the shrimp looks nicely caramelized (about 2-3 minutes). When the underside of the shrimp looks golden brown, flip the shrimp and cook one additional minute, so that the shrimp are just cooked through. Shut the heat but leave the pot on the burner, and use tongs to remove the shrimp to a plate. Set the shrimp aside for now.",
      "Add the can of coconut milk to the pot on the stove and return the heat to low. Use a wooden spoon to scrape the bottom of the pot, releasing any flavorful caramelized shrimp bits. Add the lime leaves (if using) and add 2 Tablespoons of curry paste. Stir to mix the curry paste in with the coconut milk, and let the coconut milk simmer gently for about 10 minutes.",
      "While the coconut milk is simmering, cut the stem off each head of bok choy, separate the leaves, and wash the leaves thoroughly under cold running water. Cut the thick white stems into 1/2 inch pieces, and cut the tender green leaf into wider 1 inch pieces. By the time you're done prepping the bok choy, the coconut milk will likely have been simmering for about 10 minutes, so add the bok choy to the pot and cook with the lid on for about 3-4 minutes, until the greens have wilted and the white stem pieces are cooked through.",
      "Remove the lid and add the shrimp back into the pot. Add the juice of one and half limes, along with a pinch of salt. Stir the curry. Taste the curry. Add more lime juice and/or more salt as necessary. If you have a half of a lime left over, save it for later and squeeze it into your water when you want a refreshing drink.",

Even when you remove the pan from flame, remember that it will still keep cooking. Keep stirring to prevent the flour from burning or transfer the mixture to a bigger pot (as you still have to add sugar).",
      "Once it's done, add the ground cardamom and mix well. Then, let it sit at room temperature to cool completely. Once it has cooled down, add the sugar and mix it well-really well.

Immediately cut the barfi into diamond shapes or use a cookie cutter (I've used my daisy cutter to make these cuties).",
      "For the chocolate garnish: melt either milk chocolate or dark chocolate in the microwave at intervals of 30 seconds, stirring with a spoon in between, until the chocolate is melted enough to garnish it on the barfi. Be careful not to scorch the chocolate. You can also melt chocolate in a double boiler. Drizzle the chocolate on the barfi freestyle with a fork or make little dots; anything you feel like. Let your imagination run wild.",

If you can't find coarse chickpea flour, you can make some by yourself: Get the smooth variety, add a couple of spoons of ghee and milk to it and try to rub it in your palms-what this will do is will form crumbles, thus making it coarse in texture. Either way it will taste good. Keep in mind that sometimes you'll need more or less ghee depending on the quality of flour."

While the chocolate is still warm, place some of the chopped cherries over the chocolate on one side of a piece of bacon. The cherries are sticky so it is a bit of work. Sprinkle that side with the almonds and a pinch of Demerara sugar. Flip that piece over and do it again so that both sides are sprinkled with cherries, almonds, and Demerara. Do this for each piece of chocolate covered bacon. Refrigerate until hardened. Serve."

Chill the brine in the refrigerator until cooled. Place the pork belly in a zip-lock bag and pour the brine into the bag to submerge it. Rest the bag on top of a deep plate and leave in the fridge to brine for 6 hours. Make sure the pork belly is fully submerged at all time.",

Place the belly, SKIN-SIDE DOWN in an oven-proof container that's just wide enough to hold the pork belly, and deep enough to allow 1? or 3 cm of room on the top. The better the fit of the contain, the less fat you'll need to confit the pork (a square cake-pan is great). Heat up enough oil (I just used light olive oil instead of pork fat) to cover the pork belly by at least 1/2? or 2 cm, in a pot until warmed through (but not hot enough to cook the belly). Pour the oil into the baking container, then cover with aluminum foil.\r\nConfit the pork in the oven for 4 hours. It should be easy to pierce through with a fork.",

Wrap a handful of wooden skewers together with tape. Pierce the skin ALL OVER with the tip of the skewers until you have made densely populated, mini holes throughout the skin. Do this GENTLY without breaking up the fat-layer underneath. I find it more efficient to move slowly from one side to the other, instead of random jabbing.",

Cover with plastic wrap, then another piece of flat-shaped plate (the bottom of a cake-pan, or another baking dish) over the top of the pork belly. Rest something relatively heavy on top (2 cans, or a pot). Chill in the fridge for at least 12 hours, or until needed.",

Trim the pork belly, according to the shape of the skin, into very clean, even and straight-edged square or rectangle. Heat up approx 2 tbsp of the confit-fat in a wide, NON-STICK pan over medium-high heat. Carefully lay the pork belly, SKIN-SIDE DOWN on the pan then turn the heat down to LOW. Take a piece of parchment paper and rest it over the pan, with a opening on the side FACING AWAY from you. Trust me, the skin is going to mini-explode and splatter. The opening allows the steam to escape, but also retain enough heat inside the pan to warm up the pork.",
      "Leave the skin to crisp up over low-heat for 18 min, then REMOVE the parchment paper (we want to eliminate the moisture inside the pan now) and cook for another 5 min. Check the skin and see if the entire depth is blistered thoroughly. If not, keep cooking for another 5 min. It took mine about 30+ minutes. Once ready, turn the pork belly over to heat up the meat-side slighly, approx 1 min.",
      "Move the pork belly to a board, skin-side up. Cover the skin with an even layer of granulated sugar. It should be thick enough that you don't see the skin underneath. Caramelize the sugar with a blowtorch until completely melted and browned. Let the caramel harden. Invert the pork belly with the creme brulee-side facing down. Use a VERY SHARP KNIFE, cut through the meat-layer and once the knife hits the skin-layer, PRESS THE KNIFE DOWN hard until you hear a crackle and feel the knife has cut through the skin.

      "PREPARATION \r\nApproximate time: 10 mins\r\n\r\nCut the stems off the cilantro. Chop into small pieces and set aside. Wash the leaves. Set aside 80% of the leaves which will later be added to the soup. The other 20% you can set aside for a garnish. Cut the chicken into thin slices that will cook easily. About 2 by 1 (inches). Set aside.\r\nTake the hard exterior off the lemon grass. Cut it once lengthwise. (Do not cut it into small pieces as you will be removing these before serving). Set aside.\r\nGrate the outside of your two limes and save the zest for later. Roll the limes with the palm of your hands to loosen the juices. Squeeze into a bowl and save for later. Also save the lime leaves if you have them (these are often hard to find). \r\nGrate the frozen ginger and set aside. \r\nJulienne the carrots into thin slices. See a one minute tutorial here. Or if you have a spiralizer you are also use that. \r\nNow that you've prepare all your ingredients, you will find the actual cooking part much less stressful!",
      "INSTRUCTIONS\r\nA can of coconut milk has a top layer of cream and a bottom layer of liquid. Scoop the thick coconut cream from the top of just one of the cans into a large stockpot set over a medium-high heat. Melt the cream, add the curry paste and stir for a few minutes until they begin to sizzle.\r\nAdd the cilantro roots and chicken and saute until the chicken is cooked through, about 5 minutes.\r\nAdd the coconut juice from the first can and all the contents of the second and third cans along with the chicken broth, carrot, lime leaves, lemon grass, fish sauce, ginger, and lime zest and juice. Simmer for 20 minutes or so.\r\nStir in the bean sprouts. Add the rice noodles, gently pushing them beneath the surface of the broth. Turn off the heat and let stand until the noodles soften, about 3-5 minutes. Rice noodles just need to soak in the hot water (no cooking required) but you don't want to over cook them so keep an eye on them and use your judgement. \r\nStir in most of the cilantro leaves. Scoop out the lemon grass stalks. Taste and season with a touch more salt (or soy sauce) as needed. Ladle into large bowls and garnish with the green onions and remaining cilantro leaves. Add Sriracha for extra spice.",

      "Wash or peel the carrots and slice roughly into three large pieces each, or more if you have very large carrots. These are just going to give flavor to the soup but won't go in the final mix, unless you don't mind a coarser texture and slightly less tomato flavor.",
      "Wash the garlic cloves but don't peel them. Place anywhere on the sheet pan.",
      "Bake until there is a good amount of liquid in the bottom of the sheet pan, the garlic cloves give a lot when you touch them and look browned in some spots, and the tomato skins have completely wrinkled up and are starting to brown or burn. This really depends on what size you cut the tomatoes, for me a good 3 hours. You can definitely rush this step with a higher oven temperature and less baking time, but the flavor might not be as robust.",
      "Let the whole pan cool until you can handle the tomatoes but they are still hot. The skins should come away very easily, with barely any effort. If they're not, that probably means they need more time in the oven. You don't need to peel off *all* the skins because they add fiber and vitamins to the soup obviously, but the more you do remove the creamier the texture will be.",
      "Carefully pour the *entire* contents of the sheet pan into a heatproof bowl, including (especially!) the juice at the bottom of the pan.",
      "Stir once or twice, then fish out the pieces of carrot and the garlic cloves.",
      "Discard the carrots or keep them to roast further for another dish, unless they're so soft they completely break up to mush if you press on them (in which case, keep them in the bowl). They've already imparted just a little bit of bright flavor that won't be recognizable as carrot in final soup.",
      "Squeeze the entire contents of the roasted garlic cloves one they're cool enough to handle into the bowl; the cloves should have cooked to a golden brown paste that smells like mellow and sweet garlic.",
      "Once the entire mixture is cool enough that you can touch the sides of the bowl without hurting your hands, blend in a blender or food processor until you reach your desired soup consistency. You can do this step pretty much right away if you have a stick blender.",
      "Taste for seasoning; I actually find that just a small pinch of salt is necessary for really ripe tomatoes, but sugar will help lift less ripe ones, or if you're cutting back on salt leave it out entirely and flavor with pepper or herbs instead.",
      "Serve with any garnishes (alongside a grilled cheese, with a really crisp piece of toast, or olive-oil soaked bread ripped into pieces and stirred in to the soup are my favorites). Because there's no fat in the actual soup, it keeps for a fairly long time in the fridge without getting \"scummy\" and also freezes beautifully. Enjoy!"

Sitr frequently, especially as it begins to cook down, to keep the bottom from burning. If it starts to get very thick before the plum chunks break down, add a splash or two of water to thin it out again and keep cooking. You should end up with about 1 cup of plum goo. Remove from heat and chill until you're ready to make your paletas.",
      "Bring the quinoa and 1 cup of the water to a boil in a small pot. Boil gently, uncovered, for 4 minutes without stirring; then remove from the heat, cover, and let sit for at least 15 minutes. Go fold your laundry, or work on your lab report, or what have you-the quinoa has infinite patience. When you're ready, add the other 1/2 cup of water, the sugar, the evaporated milk and the cinnamon stick, and bring it all back to a boil. Then, turn down the heat and simmer it uncovered for about 30 minutes, or until most of the liquid is absorbed or evaporated away. You'll need to stir it pretty frequently to keep it from burning on the bottom. A skin may form on the surface; that's alright, just stir it right back in. Finally, stir in the cream, continue heating for another minute or two, and then take the pot off the stove. Let it cool.",
      "When the quinoa has cooled enough not to burn you, carefully extract the cinnamon stick with whatever utensil you please (in my kitchen, fingers may have been used for at least part of this process). If you taste the pudding now, it will taste very sweet, but fear not: when it's frozen you won't taste the sweet nearly as much. Anyway, to make the paletas: layer the pudding and the plum mixture into a popsicle mold, willy-nilly, any way you like. I found it surprisingly difficult to spoon stuff in neatly so I just went for broad stripes, but if you have mad paleta skills, you might try narrower bands, or swirls, or something. The number of paletas you make will depend on (a) your popsicle mold, and (b) your particular balance of plum to pudding. The ratio per paleta is very much to taste.",
      "Put the filled mold in the freezer for a couple hours or overnight, until the paletas are frozen solid. To serve, run the mold under hot water until you can extract the paletas, and eat!"
