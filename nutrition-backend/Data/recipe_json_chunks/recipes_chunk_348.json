Stir together soy sauce and next 5 ingredients. Make a 1-inch deep cut lengthwise down top of tenderloin. Spoon mushroom mixture into cut. Tie tenderloin with cotton string at 1-inch intervals. Place in large shallow dish. Pour soy sauce mixture over top of tenderloin; cover and chill 2 to 8 hours, turning occasionally. Remove tenderloin from marinade, reserving marinade. Place tenderloin on a lightly greased rack in a roasting pan. Add 1 cup water to roasting pan. Bring reserved marinade to a boil in a small saucepan over medium-high heat. Boil 1 minute. Bake tenderloin at 425\u00b0 for 1 hour and 10 minutes or until a meat thermometer inserted in thickest portion registers 145\u00b0 (medium-rare) to 160\u00b0 (medium), basting occasionally with reserved marinade and covering with aluminum foil the last 30 minutes. Let stand 10 minutes before slicing. Yields 10 to 12 servings."
