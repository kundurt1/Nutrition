Remove the pears with a slotted spoon and continue to reduce the poaching liquid to 1/3 cup, creating a thick syrup. Discard the cloves. Bosc pears would probably work nicely, too.

(Chef Sarah uses a method of slicing the pear half ALMOST to the bottom, but leaving it intact, transferring it to the custard and then fanning the pear out. But this didn't work for me.)

Prick the chilled tart shell on the bottom with a fork in several places. Bake 12 - 15 minutes until just lightly browned. Remove from oven and set aside to cool. Proceed with recipe as above.

      "Once the hamburger is browned evenly, reduce the heat to medium low.",
      "Now comes the first of two critical steps in making a great coney sauce. The hamburger needs to be crumbled into extremely fine particles; the finer the better.",
      "Pampered Chef makes a tool for chopping hamburger into fine particles that I use. It requires a lot of effort and time but I cannot overstress the importance of getting the hamburger particles as small as you can.",
      "I have been tempted to put the cooked hamburger into a food processor but I am not sure if a food processor is appropriate for use on meat. I usually move small amounts of hamburger to the center of the skillet and take out my frustrations on it with my Pampered Chef tool adding the hamburger to the sauce as I go.",
      "While I am cooking the hamburger, I slowly add the rest of the chili sauce a little at a time. This is the second of two critical steps. It is important to get a balance between the sweetness of the sugar and the tang of the chili sauce.",
      "For a sauce to be truly good you should be able to taste both the sweet and tangy at the same time with neither overpowering the other. You should have a lingering taste of chili with just a hint of sweetness. It is important to frequently taste the sauce, as balance is critical.",
      "After making it for many years you will be able to pretty much tell how far along the sauce is by the color; the sauce will start to take on a rich dark red color from the dark chili powder when you are nearing completion.",
      "All this sounds like a lot of work, and it is. But the outcome is worth it. Rest assured that if you follow my directions you will be treated with a sauce that some day will come to be known as Sam's, Jane's or maybe if your name happens to be Richard - Dick's Famous Coney Sauce."

      "Optional Rice -- If you decide to serve this dish over the rice you should start the rice first as the fish and sauce don't take much time to make. Just follow package directions for whatever type of rice you are using. When the rice is finished cooking, toss in the lemon zest, fresh scallions and season with salt and pepper.",
      "Sauce -- In a small sauce pan, add the flour and just a little white wine and whisk well to combine the two. Then add the remaining white wine and bring to medium heat. Then add in the salt, pepper and cream and bring to a medium boil, cook just a minute and then reduce to medium low and let it simmer. The cream will naturally thicken as it simmers on low heat. You will add the shrimp and crab later. You want the sauce to simmer at least 5-7 minutes. This is just enough time to cook the fish.",
      "Fish -- Make sure your fish is NOT icy cold; it doesn't have to be room temperature, but just not right out of the refrigerator. Season each side of the fish well with salt and pepper. In a medium saute pan, I prefer non stick for this, add the butter and oil and bring to medium high heat. Saute the fish on each side until golden brown. Try not to move the fish once you put it in the pan until the first side is golden brown. Cooking time will vary depending on the type of fish and thickness. Tilapia takes just 2-3 minutes on the first side and even quicker on the second side.",
      "Sauce -- When you start the fish is a good time to add the shrimp and crab to your sauce. Bring the sauce back up to medium heat and add the shrimp. Cook just 1-2 minutes and then stir in the crab. Don't stir too much, you don't want to break up the crab. Add the lemon juice, zest, parsley and dill and then turn off the heat -- the sauce is done.",
      "Serve -- For each plate, add 3/4-1 cup of the rice, top with one of the fish fillets and top with the sauce. Garnish with a fresh lemon slice. ENJOY!"

      "In a blender, combine the garlic, vinegar, achiote, salt, cumin, and cloves. Puree until well combined. Add the ground chiles and blend for several minutes, or until the sauce is very smooth; if necessary, add a tablespoon or so of vinegar to make a thick paste.",
      "Heat the oil over medium heat in a frying pan. Add the onion and cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Add the chile paste; use the water to swish out the blender and add to the pan. Cook, stirring, for 3 minutes, or until thickened. Scrape onto a plate and cool completely.",
      "Cut the pork into lengthwise slices about 3/4 inch thick and smear a layer of the chile paste on each side (thick enough to draw a line in). Stack the slices in a shallow container, cover, and refrigerate for 6 to 12 hours.",
      "Cut the crown off the pineapple and cut a slice off the bottom. Carve off the prickly skin, slicing from top to bottom, then cut the flesh into slices 1/2 inch thick; set aside.",
      "Grill Method: Half an hour before cooking, clean the grill thoroughly with a brush and wipe it down with an oil-dampened rag. Preheat the grill on high. Remove any thick blobs of chile paste from the meat, as these will burn. Grill the meat and pineapple for 7 minutes on each side, directly over the flame (if your grill is hot as heck -- medium is ok). Watch carefully to make sure the chile paste is not burning; if needed, turn down the heat or move the meat to a cooler part of the grill. The pineapple should be given a half-turn partway through cooking to make nice crosshatch marks. When the meat is cooked to an internal temperature of 145 degrees (don't overcook) remove to a warm plate.",
      "Oven method: Preheat the oven to 375\u00b0F Spread the meat out in one layer in a shallow, lightly oiled baking dish or a rimmed cookie sheet. There should be some open space between the pieces; it's better to use several baking dishes than crowd the meat. Cut half of the pineapple slices into quarters and scatter over the top. Reserve the rest for another use. Roast the meat and pineapple for 30 to 40 minutes, or until well browned and crisp; there should be some caramelized juices in the bottom of the dish. Remove from the oven, cover the cooked meat and pineapple loosely with foil, and let stand 5 minutes while you heat the tortillas.",
      "To Serve: Heat the tortillas' keep them warm in a cloth napkin or a tortilla warmer. Dice the meat into small bits, mix with the juices on the plate or in the baking dish, and fill the tortillas. The pineapple can be chopped up or cut into quarters. Serve with the onion, radishes, cilantro, and your choice of salsa or hot sauce."
