Take skin off garlic clove and put into press and press directly into dressing or if you don't have a press chop extreamly fine and then add.

Once mixture is thick enough to form a filling for a burrito (rather than a \"Mexican gravy\"), remove from heat. Add some of mixture to center of a tortilla so that mixture is longer than it is wide. Top with cheese, then fold tortilla at either \"end\" of the line of filling over filling. Fold remaining sides over the first two sides that you folded. Flip burrito over on plate so that fold is down.

This is a good step if you want to melt some cheese on top of refried beans from a can while heating burrito and rice.)

      "To fix the flavor problem and streamline the cooking method, we turned to one pan to get the job done -a baking sheet. A baking sheet's roomy cooking surface allowed us to easily prepare potatoes for four at once, while panfrying the potatoes would mean frying in fussy batches. To soften the potatoes, we spread them out on the baking sheet, added a little water, covered the pan with foil, and baked them until tender. To smash all the potatoes at once, we used a second baking sheet, which we simply pressed evenly and firmly on top of the pan of parcooked potatoes. To crisp the potatoes we opted for olive oil to coat the baking sheet (and later drizzle over the broken spuds). In other words after potatoes are smashed put olive oil on baking sheet and bake again in 350 degree oven for about 15 to 20 minutes until outides are crisp and insides are fluffy and soft. The result? A welcome addition to the potato rotation: browned and crunchy potato patties, full of deep, earthy flavor. (less)"

Meanwhile, chop the peppers, onions and pineapple. Add the juice of 1/2 lime, red pepper flakes (to taste), salt, pepper and a splash of olive oil. Add a dash of the pineapple juice if it suits you. Set aside. Preare orzo, drain and set aside to cool. Grill shrimp 2-3 min/side until done. If serving as appetizer, present chutney on a platter w/ shrimp on top. As a meal, you will now add chopped tomatoes, goat cheese and a handful of fresh basil to the Orzo. Serve alongside the shrimp and chutney."

With the seed perpendicular to you, slice the fruit from both sides of the seed, yielding two large pieces. Turn the seed parallel to you and slice the two smaller pieces of fruit from each side. Dice into desired size.",
      "Note: Shrimp is usually sold by the number needed to make one pound. For example, \"21-25 count\" means there will be 21 to 25 shrimp in a pound. Size names, such as \"large\" or \"extra large,\" are not standardized, so to get the size you want, order by the count per pound. Both wild-caught and farm-raised shrimp can damage the surrounding ecosystems when not managed properly. Fortunately, it is possible to buy shrimp that have been raised or caught with sound environmental practices. Look for fresh or frozen shrimp certified by an independent agency, such as the Marine Stewardship Council. If you can't find certified shrimp, choose wild-caught shrimp from North America-it's more likely to be sustainably caught."

Cut the chocolate into small pieces (the size of a pea or smaller) and add them to the ricotta as well as the small pieces of candied fruit. When the wheat has been cooked for three hours it is ready. Throw away the water. I use a colander. Be sure to leave no water in the wheat.

In a large bowl, toss the mesclun with the olive oil, salt and pepper to taste. Arrange on a platter. With a sharp knife, cut each avocado half lengthwise almost all the way but not completely to the other end. Place each half seed side down on the lettuce and spread into a fan shape. Place the lobster-egg salad in the center of the 2 avocados and the asparagus spears around the sides of the plate. Top the avocados with a dollop of the mayonnaise, and a little caviar. Sprinkle with the tarragon and serve."

So make sure there's some meaningful space between the liquid and the top of the pot.)",

      "In a mixing bowl, combine the powdered sugar, star anise, cardamon, and salt. Grate in the nutmeg and lemon zest, and whisk everything together.",
      "Strain the cooled cream through a fine-mesh strainer into a small mixing bowl (so the sassafras pieces don't end up in the glaze).",

      "1. Combine the marinade ingredients in a bowl (the garlic through cumin and salt). Place the steaks in a large sealable plastic bag, then pour in 1/3 cup of the marinade mixture into the bag.",
      "2. Set aside the rest of the marinade. Seal the bag, and gently toss the steak around with the marinade to get it well-coated. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours. About 4 hours is optimal.",
      "3. Finish the avocado sauce by taking the remaining marinade that you set aside, stir in the parsley, jalapeno, and lime juice into the reserved marinade. Salt and pepper.......do not forget this!",
      "4. You can have all this ready to go well before your dinner, then stir in the diced avocados closer to serving time.",
      "5. Grill the peppers and onions until nice and charred. This gives them a great smokey flavor. Set aside. This can be done 2 hours before you finish the meat.",
      "6. Now, you've got the preliminaries taken care of, it's time to grill that steak! Take the steak out of the fridge 15 minutes before grilling time and pre-heat the grill to medium high. Shake the excess marinade off the steaks, then place them on the grill. For medium rare, which I recommend for this cut, grill 5 to 6 minutes on one side, then flip over to grill another 5 minutes on the other side.",
      "7. Remove the the steak to a serving platter. Slice the steak thin after it has rested a few minutes, and have it ready to go on the taco bar.",
      "8. You can set up the rest of the items on the taco bar as the steak grills. Line up the tortillas, steak, avocado sauce, onions/peppers, sour cream, lettuce and beans and let folks build their own tasty creations. I like to go through the line first and point out the items people can choose from so they don't miss anything. Enjoy your taco party!"

      "As already noted, great care must be taken when washing partially polished rice to avoid dislodging the nutrient-rich germ. Place the rice in a deep bowl and pour in enough cool tap water just to cover the grains. Using your fingertips in gentle swirling, swishing motions, rinse the grains for about 15 seconds. With slightly scooping motions, gently lift the grains once or twice, to ensure that water flows freely around each grain. Drain the rice. Use your hand or a fine-mesh strainer to hold back the rice as you drain off the water. Some people find it useful to line their strainer with fine-woven cloth (the Japanese use",
      ") or a clean, low-lint kitchen towel. Carefully transfer the rice to a pot or rice-cooker bowl.",
      "Place the washed and drained rice in a sturdy, straight-sided pot. A 2- or 3-quart size will work well for the two smaller quantities, and a 4- to 6-quart pot is appropriate for the larger amount. Add the water. Ideally, the rice should sit in its measured water for 10 minutes before cooking, but if you are pressed for time, add a few extra drops of water and cook right away. Cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid.",
      "Bring the water to a rolling boil over high heat. You will hear bubbling noises and see the lid begin to dance after several minutes. An onomatopoeic folk jingle that describes the cooking of rice refers to this bubbling stage as",

      "). If it is difficult to rely on the sound of the cooking and you must check visually on progress along the way, peek quickly, replacing the lid immediately.",
      "Increase the heat to high again for 30 seconds to dry off the rice. Remove the pot from the heat and let the rice stand, still tightly covered, for at least 10 minutes. Even if you wish to serve the rice piping hot, these final minutes of self-steaming (called",
      ") are necessary to achieve the proper texture.",
      "Place the washed and drained rice in the bowl of your cooker. Add the water. It is important to use cool liquid when cooking rice in a thermostatically controlled appliance; using warm or hot liquid from the start will cut short the cooking cycle. Close the lid, press the start switch, and let the appliance do the cooking. The time required to complete the cooking cycle will vary with the appliance, but most models take about 40 minutes to cook 1 to 1 1/2 cups raw rice."

      "Add the warm tap water and yeast packet to a mixing bowl. Mix in sugar, salt, and flour, then knead with your hands. When dough is well kneaded and consistent to the touch (and, at most, only slightly sticky, a factor adjusted by adding small amounts of flour as you knead without overdoing the flour), remove your hands from dough and form dough into a ball in bottom of mixing bowl. Cover, and let it rise for roughly an hour in a warm place, until it doubles. Punch it down. You can let rest sealed in refrigerator overnight or up to five days. Oil the large pizza pan in which you plan to stretch the dough and the screen. (Some use spray olive oil or PAM. I put oil on a new piece of paper towel and rub it on pan and one side of screen.) Stretch the dough out on the pizza pan as much as you can by rotating pan and pressing dough outward with your knuckles. Make it thinner in the center than on the edges, then just pick up stretched dough and transfer onto oiled, sixteen inch pizza screen, with oiled side of dough down, for final stretching around edges, and topping. Dough will be thin uncooked, covering all of pizza screen. Put an oven rack in the middle position to accommodate your pizza as it bakes. Preheat oven to 425 deg. F. Top pizza as you wish.",

      "1. Place the rice in a 1-1/2- or 2-quart saucepan. Fill the pot halfway with cold water. If any rice hulls or small twigs float to the surface, scoop them aside with your hand and discard them. Gently swirl your fingers through the rice until the water becomes cloudy with the rice's surface starch, about 20 seconds. Be careful not to massage the rice aggressively-you don't want to crack or break the grains. Allow the rice to settle for a few seconds. Tilt the pot over a sink and drain out all the water, cupping the rice with your hand to prevent it from spilling out of the pot. Repeat this process with three more changes of water. The water after the first 2 rinses will be quite cloudy; by the fourth rinse, it will be much less so. The water need not run completely clear by the final rinse-slightly cloudy is fine. Leave the rinsed rice in the pot.",
      "2. To the rinsed rice, add the tied lemongrass, the cooking water, the coconut milk, the salt, and the daun salam leaves (if using). Stir well to combine, making sure that the lemongrass stalks and daun salam leaves are submerged in as much of the rice as possible.",
      "3. Place the pot over high heat and, stirring constantly with a large spoon to prevent the rice at the bottom of the pot from scorching or burning, bring the liquid to a rolling, noisy boil. Allow the rice to boil vigorously for fifteen seconds, continuing to stir constantly. (It's essential that you stir constantly, otherwise the fats and proteins in the coconut milk will cause the rice at the bottom of the pot to become gummy and stick together, which will ultimately lead to the final dish having a scorched or burned bottom layer.) Immediately reduce the heat to the lowest possible setting and cover the pot tightly with the lid. Continue cooking for 15 minutes. Don't be tempted to lift or remove the lid during this time-you'll lose essential cooking steam if you do.",
      "4. Remove the pot from the heat and allow the rice to continue to steam, covered, away from the heat for an additional 10 minutes.",
      "5. Open the pot and discard the lemongrass and daun salam leaves. Fold the rice over gently with a spoon, distributing the aromatic flavors which may be concentrated in pockets in the rice. Transfer the rice to a deep serving bowl, fluffing it gently with a fork and lifting it into a high, peaked mound. Serve hot or warm. (If serving the rice warm, keep it covered with aluminum foil until then.)"

When the vegetables are soft, add the rice, one generous fistful per person. Stir continually to coat the rice. Have twice as much broth as the amount of rice you plan to use. If you run out of broth, use water. Add a ladleful of broth to the rice and continue stirring. When all the liquid has been absorbed, add more broth. Add more liquid when the rice has absorbed what is in the pan. The rice should be between wet and dry, never soupy; otherwise, the rice boils and won't absorb the taste of the other ingredients. Continue for 15 or 20 minutes, stirring continually and adding liquid as it is absorbed. Adjust the heat as you cook. It should be low enough so that nothing sticks to the bottom of the pan, but high enough so that everything is bubbling in a lively way. The risotto is done when the center of the rice is slightly firm and not bright white. As with pasta, taste a kernel to see if it's done."

      "1. If you've bought a separate pork loin and pork belly, drape belly skin-side up around pork loin to test fit. If it extends more than 1/2 inch over ends of loin, trim it down. If there's a gap on the underside because belly doesn't reach all the way around, that's fine.",
      "",
      "2. Arrange belly, separate or attached, so it sits skin-side up on a stable work surface. Using a utility knife or other razor-sharp blade, carefully but firmly score rind in criss-crossing parallel lines about 1/2 inch apart, cutting through rind and just into fat about 1/4 inch deep without cutting through to meat.",

Roast 25 min, then reduce oven temp to 325 deg. Roast until an instant-read thermometer inserted into center of roast registers 140-145 deg, another 2-3 hrs.",

If rind is too tough to slice through easily, remove it in larger chunks and transfer it to a second cutting board, where you can chop it into pieces to serve alongside the sliced roast. Use leftover meat for sandwiches."

Use plenty of aluminum foil to create a good seal around each individually wrapped rack of ribs. Leave them in the refrigerator for a couple days to marinate.",

Take each rack of ribs off the grill and rub them with just a little bit more cajun seasoning-bourbon-maple syrup mixture, then go straight to the smoker with them.
