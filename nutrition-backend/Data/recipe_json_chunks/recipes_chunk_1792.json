      "When you add sugar to eggs (especially to egg yolks), it is important to create an emulsion quickly or else a chemical reaction that produces heat will occur.",

      "It is important to fill the molds completely since the custard loses volume as it bakes.",
      "Traditionally, custard is baked in a hot water bath to insulate it from the direct heat of the oven and to keep the eggs from cooking too fast, which would cause them to separate.",
      "Use hot water from the tap and pour enough water into the roasting pan to reach halfway up the sides of the molds.",
      "When baked correctly, the custard should tremble slightly when gently shaken.",
      "In a conventional oven, this should take about 1 hour 15 minutes for a large mold, 45 minutes for individual molds.",
      "If you detect any liquid under the skin, the custard is under baked.",
