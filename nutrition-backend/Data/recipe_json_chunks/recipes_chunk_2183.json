      "A cheese can be classified in many ways: by the process or recipe used to make it, by the type of milk, by its texture, by the appearance of its rind, and other ways,-- it's impossible to choose the classification method that works best and has the fewest exceptions.",
      "for simplicity's sake cheeses are classified by family, grouping together those which share primary characteristics and are related by their finished appearance, texture, and level of flavor",
      "Fresh Cheeses - Are essentially uncooked and unripened ( or slightly ripened ) curd that may or may not have been drained of its whey, ( ie.",
      "ricotta is undrained, while cream cheese is drained ) usually very moist and mild, their flavor is characterized by a pleasant tartness.",
      "some are molded, while others are simply scooped from a container.",
      "Examples include farmers cheese, cottage cheese , French fromage blanc and unaged fromage de chevre, and Italian Mascarpone.",
      "Soft-ripened or Bloomy Rind Cheeses - which have a semisoft consistency, have been surface ripened - either sprayed or exposed to molds so that they ripen from the rind inward , their crusts are thin, whiten,and velvety ( bloomy ).",
      "Examples include French Brie, Camembert, and triple - cremes such as Gratte-Paille and Pierre Robert , as well as Italian Paglia-style and Toma cheeses.",
      "Washed-rind Cheeses - Whose rinds are usually orange-hued, have been rubbed or washed ( sometimes immersed ) during the ripening process with a solution of brine, wine, beer, or grape brandy to promote a desirable exterior mold that is instrumental in creating the cheese's characteristically pronounced flavor.",
      "Examples include French Epoisses , Livarot, and Pont-I Eveque, Italian Taleggio, Spanish Manon, and most Trappist or monastery- style cheeses.",
      "Natural - rind Cheeses - Have self-formed rinds, no microflora or molds and no waxing areb used to create their thin exteriors .",
      "They are denser in texture than other cheeses and usually aged longer .",
      "Examples include English Stilton, Lancashire, French Chantal, fromage de chevre, Mimolette, Tomme de Savoie, and Spanish Roncal.",
      "Blue - veined Cheeses - Which are marbled with a blueish-green mold, reveal visible mold cultures within their interiors.",
      "Examples include American Maytag Blue, English Stilton, French Roquefort, Italian Gorgonzola, and Spanish Cabrales.",
      "Uncooked, Pressed Cheeses - Which are made from curd that has not been heated ( or cooked ) to soto complete the drainage of whey and to achieve a specific, firm texture.",
      "Examples include Cheddar, French Morbier and To me de Savoie, Italian Montasio, and Spanish Manchego.",
      "Cooked, Pressed Cheese - Is made from curd that has been heated ( or cooked ) before pressing.",
      "Examples include Dutch Gouda, English Cheshire, French Cancel and Swiss Emmental.",
      "Processed Cheese - Is a cheese by-product made from a combination of natural cheese , vegetable-based gums, dyes, emulsifiers , and stabilizers, blandly uniform in flavor, it has a smooth or spreadable consistency and a long shelf life.",
      "Examples include american Cheese, imitation cheese and cheese spreads, as well as imported examples such as French Gourmandise, LA Vache Qui Rit, and Rambol.",
