Continue with remaining pastry. Bake 400 degrees until tops are just brown. To freeze, place wax paper between stacks. For parties, bake using frozen pastries straight from freezer."

      "Scald milk; pour over the shortening. Add sugar and salt and cool to tepid. Add the dissolved yeast and beaten egg. Add 4 cups flour adding one at a time beating after each addition.",

      "Press dough down and divide into workable size. Roll dough out into a rectangle. Cover with melted butter. Layer with a generous thick layer* of brown sugar. Sprinkle on cinnamon* as desired. If you like raisins, layer on a layer of raisins. Roll up jellyroll fashion.",
      "Using a scissors or a piece of string, cut off slices about 1 to 1-1/2 inches thick. Place slices in an 8 or 9 inch round greased cake pan. Place one slice in the middle and other slices around it. Press rolls down to even out and fill pan. Let rise until rolls fill the pan generously -- about another hour.",
      "Bake in a 350*F. oven about 15 - 20 minutes. If rolls get too brown, cover with a piece of tine foil until the end of baking. Do not over bake rolls.",
      "Remove immediately from pan by inverting onto a plate and then tip over onto another plate to right the rolls.",

      "Spread over warm rolls as soon as they are placed on a plate to let the frosting melt and run into the rolls.",
      "* I was pretty generous with both the brown sugar and cinnamon. I ended up with about a 1/2 inch layer of brown sugar completely covered with cinnamon. I very lightly sprinkled the brown sugar filling with flour. This prevents the filling from melting thru rolls as they are baking. Or any easy way is to mix the brown sugar, cinnamon & about 1/4 cup of flour, then spread the mixture on dough. I also like diced Granny Smith Apple with chopped walnuts.",
      "My Note: This time a double batch, wel l actually 2 single batches because I don't know what would happen with a double batch. I am well versed in the kitchen but baking seems to be an exact science. The only thing I altered from the recipie was to grate a little fresh nutmeg over the buttered dough before applying the brown sugar.",
      "This remains to be delicious even on the second day! Most cinnamon recipes I have tried promised to be the best of the best. However, in the end, after trying them- they are a disappointment and not good. They turned out to be like old hard bread with a cinnamon taste. This one is exceptional. This THE BEST! My cinnamon turned out to be really yummy, super delicious and moist! My husband and I ended up eating the bread while it was still hot, fresh from the oven! He suggested that I pour or drizzle the frosting only before eating time. I did it and yes, it was better and tasted really fresh! ALTERNATIVE: I used SOUR CREAM for this recipe! I used 3/4 cup of water and 1/3 cup of sour cream, mixed them well and placed the combo in the microwave for 30 seconds.This is my sub for the milk! No wonder the bread is creamy! I used OLIVE OIL instead of shortening for health reasons. Turned out excellent! For VANILLA FROSTING, I used sour cream. This the real and ULTIMATE CINNAMON RECIPE that is very, very delicious! And the bread is soft, delicate, moist and creamy- probably because of the sour cream I used! TIPS: I used BREAD FLOUR instead of the usual ALL PURPOSE FLOUR. And I also added 5 tablespoons GLUTEN to help it to rise easier, faster and softer. I used 5 cupsof BREAD FLOUR.",
      "Better than Cinnabon! =) I made a few changes to the recipe for personal preference: I used 3/4 Silk almond milk and 1/4 sweetened condensed milk (I still added the 1/3 cup white sugar). I used 4 cups of bread flour and I kneaded the dough for about 45 mins by hand. I let the dough rise in the sunlight with plastic wrap tightly covering the bowl. This extra heat helped the dough rise much faster. Then I punched it down and prepared the rolls by using 1/2 stick of room temp butter and smeared it over the dough by hand. I pat down the brown sugar / cinnamon mix and then began to roll it tightly. I placed the cut up rolls into a baking dish and placed it in the sunlight for an hour to let rise (double / triple in size). Baked in the oven for 20 mins at 350 F and as soon as they came out, I brushed melted butter on top. I also used store bought Pillsbury cream cheese icing and melted it in the microwave before putting it on top of the baked rolls. This recipe is well worth the time and effort required to make this dessert. You'll be glad you did."

On a gas stove, the eggplant can be put directly on a moderate flame and roasted for 12-15 minutes (turning frequently with metal tongs) until the flesh is soft and smoky and the skin is burnt all over. To roast in the oven, pierce the eggplant with a sharp knife in a few places. Put it on a foil-lined tray and place directly under a hot broiler for 45 minutes, turning a few times. The aubergine needs to deflate completely and its skin should burn and break. It should look very wrinkly. Or you can use the grill and keep turning it, about 20-25 minutes.",
      "Once the eggplant is ready, remove it from the heat and make a long cut through it. Scoop out the soft flesh while avoiding the skin. Discard the skin. Chop the flesh roughly and set aside.",
      "Cut the other eggplant into a 1/2 inch dice, leaving the skin on. Heat up 1/3 cup of the olive oil in a frying pan and fry the eggplant dice in batches until golden and crisp. (you may need more oil).Transfer to a colander and sprinkle with salt. Leave to cool.",
      "Put the onion and remaining oil in a heavy pan and fry slowly until the onion is soft and translucent. Add the garlic and cook for a further 3 minutes. Turn up the heat and add the rice, stirring to coat it in the oil. Fry for 2-3 minutes. Add the wine (it should hiss) and cook for 2-3 minutes, or until nearly evaporated. Turn the heat down to medium.",
      "Now start adding the hot stock to the rice, a ladleful at a time, waiting until each addition has been fully absorbed before adding the next and stirring all the time. When all the stock has been added remove the pan from the heat. Add half of the lemon zest, the lemon juice, grilled aubergine flesh, butter, most of the parmesan and about 3/4 teaspoon salt. Stir well, then cover and set aside untouched for 5 minutes. Taste and add more salt, if you like, plus black pepper.",

      "Normally, I use 2 full cups cream and no sweetener. If you add in moisture with liquor or honey or a flavored syrup, you have to reduce the cream accordingly. You want the total VOLUME of the liquid to chocolate to be about even. So if you get 2 cups of chocolate after shaving it down, you will need 2 cups of liquid. Heavy cream and flavored syrup both included.",
      "For Christmas, I divided the chocolate in half and adding a 1/2 cup of liquer to each. Because the mint Bailey's is a chocolate mint, I added some mint extract to increase the mint flavor a bit. With the kahlua, I added a couple tablespoons of espresso ground beans. If you are separating this into several flavors, divide the chocolate before cutting it, it's easier when you use 2 types of chocolate.",
      "Shave the chocolate into a glass measuring cup. This makes it really easy to add the cream straight into it and, if the chocolate cools too fast, you can place the measuring cup right into the pot of hot water (see next step) and finish mixing.",

      "Pour the cream over the chocolate. If you are doing more than one flavor of chocolate, try to get the cream divided equally between the chocolates. I suggest leaving the dish of chocolate (or dishes) on the stove so they don't get cold. It blends best this way.",
      "Let sit for 1 minute and then slowly stir each until well blended. Then beat until it shines. Refrigerate until stiff enough to roll into balls (about 6 hours. I stir hourly). I found 2 teaspoons to be a good size for me.",
      "If you are going to dip these in chocolate, then once you form them, freeze for one hour. Otherwise, roll them in your topping as you form them into balls. Being warm from your hands helps them pick up the coating.",

      "Line a baking sheet with waxed paper. One at a time, drop the truffles into the chocolate, coat, and then place on the waxed paper. I found that chopsticks were the easier to do this with, as I could grip easily and let it drip off excess. I've read suggestions about stabbing with a fork, but that just didn't work for me.",
      "These will soften quickly. If they start slipping off the chopsticks or smush as you work with them, put them back in the freezer for a bit. I divided my truffles onto to trays so that one was always in the freezer and just swapped them as the ones out softened. I also put an ice bag on the tray with the truffles to help keep them cool while they were out.",
      "Once all the truffles are coated, let them get hard enough to move. Then you can nestle them all together on the same tray and drizzle them with white chocolate. Alternately, you can sprinkle them with cocoa powder or ground cacao nibs while still soft."

Make sure whatever you add isn't too runny or juicy, because this will prevent the pudding from setting up properly. You can also stir in fresh fruit after the pudding is set. One of my favorite combos is to drain a can of cinnamon fried apples, dice them, and then mix them in the pudding. Serve with some caramel sauce drizzled on top - yummy!",

Oh- and warm each slices in the microwave about 25-30 seconds. It's so much better that way! A couple of suggestions: 1) The recipe suggests serving the pie cold, but try it at room temperature, or slightly warm (30 seconds in the microwave should do it) 2) The thinner your apple slices, the better! Try it with pear and/or peach. Adding walnut pieces is a nice variation. Use aluminum foil at the end of baking to keep the crust from getting too brown. A little extra cinnamon or lemon zest in the glaze is good. (I use an extra deep dish, make a lattice top and extra custard and glaze.) Make 2 and hide 1 if you want leftovers. Delicious!"

When the apples are sliced, stir them with your hand so that all the slices get coated with the lemon water. Then, drain the apples completely and place them in a bowl that has a cover and pour in 3/4 cup of the sugar, 1 tablespoon (3 teaspoons) of the cinnamon, and, 1/2 teaspoon of the allspice. Stir gently and allow this mix to marinate (covered) in the refrigerator for 24-48 hours.",
      "Once the apples have marinated and you are ready to bake your mini-pies, preheat your oven to 350-degrees F. (If you are having a dinner party, simply prepare the mini-pies in advance, ready to bake, by having them on the baking tray in the refrigerator, covered with cling wrap -- remove the cling wrap and stick them in the oven about 40 minutes before you intend to serve them).",
      "Lay out some parchment paper, or otherwise prepare a flat surface for rolling out the individual biscuits. Dust the surface with some of the flour and flip a biscuit on it to lightly coat both sides and roll it out with a rolling pin. (The kids LOVE to do this!). Add just a little additional flour to each side as needed to keep the dough from sticking to the rolling pin. (I like to rub flour on to my rolling pin before I start, and as needed thereafter). Continue to roll each biscuit until they are each about eight inches across. THEY DO NOT HAVE TO END UP BEING ROUND, OR PERFECT IN ANY WAY! As each crust is finished, stack them on a plate until they're all finished.",
      "On a work surface (I use a cookie sheet, but not the one I'll be baking on), lay out a crust and brush the edges with a hand-beaten mixture of the 2 tablespoons of warm water and the egg white. (Save the remaining egg white blend -- you'll need it again!) Then, after stirring the apples but NOT using the juice in the bottom of the bowl, place about 1/3 to 1/2 cup of the sliced apples on the center of the crust. Spoon on 1 1/2 teaspoons sugar over these apples and dot the apples with a little butter, about a teaspoonfull for each mini-pie.",

      "Blend the topping by mixing 2 tablespoons of sugar, 1 teaspoon of cinnamon, and 1/4 teaspoon of ground allspice in a small bowl. Mix these dry ingredients with a fork. Brush the tops of the mini-pies with the remaining egg white and then sprinkle on a good bit of the topping blend.",
      "Bake the mini-pies at 350-degrees F. for 30 minutes. Some of the butter will leak out onto the baking tray but this is normal. As soon as the mini-pies have baked for 30 minutes, remove them from the oven and use a sharp-edged spatula right away to transfer them either to a platter, or, to individual serving plates.
