When it is full, force it closed and tie it up with butcher's string. Use plenty and make sure it's good and tight to prevent stuffing erupting out of any available opening.",

Pour that over the heart, and add some more wine to the base of the tray to keep the vegetables from getting too dry.",

When it is done cooking, take it all out and pour the juices into a saucepan. Cover the meat in foil and leave it somewhere warm for at least 10 minutes. Simmer the juices and add whatever is left of your glass of wine. Reduce until it thickens, giving you a fittingly rich sauce to serve with the heart.",
