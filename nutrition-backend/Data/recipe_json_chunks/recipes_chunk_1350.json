Once they are all peeled, remove them from the water and pat dry. Then slice the potatoes about 1/4-inch apart and about three-quarters of the way through to create a series of uniform slices so that they are still joined together at the bottom. This should create a fan type finish to the potatoes. Next, using a whisk, blend the butter, parsley, salt and pepper. Make sure to mix well. Dunk the potatoes into the butter mixture, making sure that the slits in the potato soak up the mixture as well. Place the potatoes on a baking sheet and bake for 30 minutes. After 30 minutes, remove the potatoes, re-heat any remaining butter and drizzle on top. Divide the cheese mixture over the potatoes. Bake the potatoes until the cheese is melted and the potatoes are cooked through, about 15 minutes. Once melted, remove the potatoes and serve."

Sprinkle the butter cubes over the flour mixture and use your fingers to work them in (you want to rub your thumb against your fingertips, smearing the butter as you do so). Do this until the mixture looks like cornmeal with some pea-sized bits of butter remaining. Stir in the cheese with a fork until evenly distributed. Sprinkle 6 tablespoons ice water over the mixture and stir with a fork until the dough begins to come together. If needed, add an additional tablespoon or two of ice water (you shouldn't need much more). Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead three times. Gather the dough into a ball, then divide into two portions, making one slightly bigger than the other. Press each portion down into a disk and wrap in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.",

Add oil to the pan and increase the heat to medium-high. Add the onion, pork, brown sugar, salt, and spices. Cook, using a wooden spoon to break up the meat, until it is lightly browned, about 10 minutes. Let the meat mixture cool for 10 minutes, then transfer to a food processor. Add the breadcrumbs and pulse five times until the mixture has the texture of coarse sand. Set aside.",

Roll out, working from the center, to a 13-inch circle. Peel off the top piece of parchment and transfer the dough to a pie plate, peeled side down. Peel off the remaining parchment and press the crust into the sides of the pie plate, draping any excess over the edge. Unwrap the smaller disk of dough and put it in the center of a large sheet of parchment paper. Cover the dough with a second piece of parchment.

Arrange the cooked apple slices over the meat, pressing down to make the whole construction as smooth and neat as possible. Peel the top sheet of parchment off the top crust. Transfer, peeled side down, to the pie, then peel off the remaining parchment. Using a sharp knife, make two 3-inch slashes in the crust to allow steam to escape. Fold the edges of the bottom crust up over the top crust and crimp the edges to seal. Brush the crust with the egg wash and decorate with sage leaves, if desired. Bake at 425\u00b0F for 10 minutes, then reduce the heat to 375\u00b0F and bake until the crust is golden brown, 25 to 35 minutes more. Remove from oven and let cool 25 minutes before serving."

Remove the lid and stir once or twice. Keep the heat on low and let the onions sit in the hot oil without stirring for about 6-8 minutes. Stir and continue to cook the onions. Repeat every 6-8 minutes until onions are soft and golden slightly caramelized. Adjust the heat to avoid scorching but do not cook on high heat. This is a slow process and can take up to 30 minutes. Be patient, it's worth it! The onions can be made up to 1 week ahead of time, keep in a well-sealed container in the fridge until you're ready to use, let them come up to room temperature first.",

Dip pastry brush into the egg wash and run over the edge.",

      "For dough: In a large mixing bowl, stir yeast into 1/2 cup warm water; add 1 teaspoon sugar. Let stand for about five minutes or until foamy. Stir the cake mix, 1 cup of the flour, the egg, cooking oil, salt and the remaining water into yeast mixture. Beat with an electric mixer on high speed for three minutes, scraping sides of bowl constantly. Using a wooden spoon, stir in the remaining flour to form moderately soft dough. (dough will be sticky)",
      "Cover and let rise in refrigerator 2 to 24 hours or until doubled in size. Lightly grease two 13x9x2 inch baking pans. Set aside. Stir dough. Divide in half. Turn one portion of dough out onto well floured surface. Roll the dough into a 12x8 inch rectangle. Brush with half the melted butter. For filling: IN a small bowl, combine the 2/3 cup sugar and the cinnamon. Sprinkle half of the sugar mixture over dough. Roll up into a spiral, starting from one of the long sides. Pinch edges to seal. Repeat with the remaining dough, remaining butter and remaining sugar mixture. Cut each roll of the dough crosswise into 12 pieces. Arrange 12 pieces cut sides down in each of the prepared pans. Cover loosely; let the dough rise in a warm place until nearly doubled in size (about one hour). Uncover pans. Place a baking sheet under each of the pans. Bake in a 350 degree oven for 25 to 30 minutes or until lightly brown and rolls sound hollow when lightly tapped."

      "2. Place the salt, flour, and the remaining 2 cups sugar together in a very large bowl and stir together. Add the 4 egg yolks. Make a well in the middle and add the yeast mixture and the remaining 4 cups water. Start kneading together; add 1/2 cup canola oil. Knead for 10 minutes, adding 1/2 cup canola oil, a small amount at a time, to create a workable dough. The dough will become a cohesive mass yet be a bit sticky. Rub a little of the remaining 1/4 cup canola oil over the top and sides of the dough. Loosely cover the dough with a kitchen towel and place the bowl in a warm spot for 15 minutes.",
      "3. After 15 minutes, the dough will have relaxed a bit and should be easier to work with. Lightly oil your hands and knead the dough again until smooth and satiny, 2 to 3 minutes. Rub a little oil over the top and sides of the dough. Cover with a kitchen towel and place the bowl in a medium garbage bag. Place the open end loosely underneath the bowl to trap air. Let the dough rise in a warm dark corner of your kitchen until doubled in size, about 1 hour.",
      "4. Uncover the dough. With lightly oiled hands, punch the dough down to release air. Cover again with the bag, loosely tucked under, and let rise for 1 hour.",
      "5. Divide the dough into five equal parts, about 2 pounds each. Preheat oven to 375\u00b0F. Spray five 9-inch round baking pans with cooking spray.",
      "6. Place one piece of dough on a smooth work surface. Squeeze out any air bubbles from the dough and roll in into a 12-inch rope. If the dough is sticking, lightly spray your work surface with cooking spray. Cut the rope into eight equal pieces. Roll each piece into a ball. Place one ball in the center of the prepared pan and surround it with the remaining balls. Repeat with the remaining pieces of dough so you have five pans of challah. Loosely cover each pan with a kitchen towel or plastic wrap and let rise 15 minutes. (If you can't fit all the pans in your oven at once and you want your challahs to be as beautiful as possible, shape the remaining dough while the first round of challahs are in the oven so they don't see rise for too much longer than 15 minutes before baking.)",

      "8. Bake for 10 minutes. Reduce the temperature to 350\u00b0F and bake until tops are dark golden brown, 35 to 45 minutes more. Let cool 15 minutes before serving warm, or cool completely on a wire rack."

Scatter the garlic cloves into the pan with the chopped chile and drizzle over some olive oil. Mix around a bit, pushing the tomatoes underneath. Place in the oven, uncovered, for 1 1/2 hours, turning any of the exposed tomatoes halfway through, until the chicken skin is crisp,the meat is falling off the bone and the garlic is very soft. If after an hour or so the skin isn't crisping to your liking, you can turn up the heat and switch to convection, or just blast it under the broiler for a bit at the end, rotating the pan occasionally and watching closely, until you get the skin as brown as you like. Just don't let the sauce simmer too vigorously or the meat might toughen up. If you fancy, you can add some drained cannelini beans or some sliced new potatoes to the pan along with the chicken. Or you can serve the chicken with some simple mashed potato. Squeeze the garlic out of the skins before serving. You could even make it part of a pasta dish-remove the chicken meat from the bone and shred it, then toss into a bowl of linguini or spaghetti and serve at once.",
