Stir in 1 cup chicken broth, 1/2 cup lemon juice, orange juice, parsley, and salt and pepper, bring to a boil, and cover. Reduce heat and simmer for 1 hour; strain the stock and set aside.",

Skim fat out of the roasting pan, and pour reserved basting mixture into the pan, stirring and scraping to dissolve the brown bits of flavor from the bottom of the pan. Bring the mixture to a boil over medium heat, and stir in the reserved duck stock. Bring back to a boil, and cook the sauce down by about half, stirring constantly to prevent burning, about 10 minutes. Whisk in sour cream to make a smooth, glossy sauce. Pour the sauce over the carved duck to serve."
