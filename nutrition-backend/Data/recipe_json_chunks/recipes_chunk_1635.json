Add a bit of the stock to the risotto, stirring constantly until the rice has absorbed the stock, then repeat the process until all the stock all has been used up. This will take about 20 to 25 minutes or until the rice has cooked. Stir frequently & watch the rice very carefully. When ready, taste! It has to taste fab! Put the cooking pot off the fire but add a lid on top to keep hot.",
      "On the same fire, heat a large non stick pan and add 2 to 3 tablespoons of olive oil on medium heat. Now, add the rest of the cut up onions and the rest of the garlic into the pan. Fry for about 2 to 4 minutes. Add the cut up chanterelles, the cut up oyster mushrooms and fry for about 3 to 5 minutes until they are cooked through. Add some sea salt, only a bit because the Parmesan cheese already will be salty and fresh grinds of black pepper. Taste again!",
      "Now, add the chopped Italian parsley and turn the heat off. Finally, add the onion, garlic and mushroom mix to the risotto pot & carefully mix everything.",

(Tightly covered, the dough can be kept at room temperature for overnight or for about 12 hours, or in the refrigerator for a week or so. If refrigerated, it should be brought to room temperature before it is rolled).",

Sprinkle a smoothly woven kitchen towel with a little cornstarch and, one at a time, roll each ball with a rolling pin into a round about 7 inches in diameter. As they are rolled, place the rounds between strips of wax paper and stack them on a plate. Then cover all the rounds with a kitchen towel and let them rest for about 30 minutes."

      "Have all the ingredients ready for assembly. In a large bowl filled with water, dip a wrapper in the water. The rice wrapper will begin to soften and this is your cue to remove it from the water and lay it flat. Place 2 shrimp halves in a row across the center and top with basil, mint, cilantro and lettuce. Leave about 1 to 2 inches uncovered on each side. Fold uncovered sides inward, then tightly roll the wrapper, beginning at the end with the lettuce. Repeat with remaining wrappers and ingredients. Cut and serve at room temperature with dipping sauce.",
      "The Culinary Chase's Note: The rice wrapper can be fussy to handle if you let it soak too long. I usually give it a couple of swishes in the water and then remove. It may feel slightly stiff but by the time you are ready to roll up, the wrapper will become very pliable. A typical spring roll contains cooked rice vermicelli, slivers of cooked pork and julienned carrots but you can use whatever suits your fancy. Enjoy!"

Using a mesh strainer held over a bowl, push the puree through with a spatula (you should be left with about a tablespoon of dry seeds which you can then discard).\nCream the butter, sugar, and salt together in an electric stand mixer (use whisk attachment) or in a mixing bowl with an electric hand mixer starting on low speed. It takes about 2 minutes for the mixture to start to come together. At this point, continue to cream the mixture for 2-3 minutes at medium-high speed until it is light and fluffy.\nMix the cream cheese in 2 ounces at a time and then cream for 2 more minutes (be sure to scrape down the sides of the bowl).\nAdd the blackberry puree and vanilla and mix until combined.\nPlace frosting tip (2D or M1) in a piping bag and fill the bag with the frosting.

      "While the garlic roasts and the steak marinades, begin preparing the scallions, mushrooms, and asparagus. If grilling, place the asparagus in foil exposing the ends so they can brown and caramelize, and drizzle with olive oil, balsamic vinegar, and cajun seasoning. Wrap the mushrooms and scallions together in foil, and drizzle olive oil and balsamic vinegar over them, and, if desired, place a dollop of butter on top before closing completely. Place on grill and cook until slightly tender and asparagus heads have browned. You can also saute them all together as well until lightly tender. \n If baking, place all veggies on cookie sheet on foil and drizzle with olive oil, vinegar, and sprinkle more cajun seasoning if desired. Bake until veggies are slightly tender. You can also saute them all together with olive oil until slightly tender, then deglaze the pan with balsamic and reduce.",
      "Next, grill steak so it sears on both sides with grill marks. I do this by having a grill around 350-400 F with wood chips smoking, put the steak on at an angle and close the grill for 90 seconds., Next, rotate the steak 90 degrees and close the grill for 90 more seconds. Next, flip the steak from top to bottom, not side to side, because, from my experience, most grills tend to have hot spots vertically rather than horizontally. Close the grill for 90 seconds, then rotate 90 degrees and cook for another 90 secs, and if you grill is hot enough, there should be diamond-pattern, criss-cross grill marks, and your steak will be medium rare-medium, add a minute or 2 to each side for medium well-well. Pull off the grill and let meat rest for 6-8 minutes, remember, don't cut into it or the juices will all leak out.\nIf pan searing, get you pan to medium-medium high heat with a higher heat cooking oil like safflower oil.. For medium rare-medium, sear the steak on both sides for 3 minutes and then let rest for 6-8 minutes. Add 2-4 minutes for medium well-well\n\nCut the steak into 1/4 thin slices so they can easily be rolled up.",
