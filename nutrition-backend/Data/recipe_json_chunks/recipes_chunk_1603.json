Put an egg onto the prepared baking sheet, and stretch the dough around it.

      "To make the Coq Au Vin on your stovetop, if you're using lardons or bacon, saute them in 2 tablespoons oil in a heavy-bottomed casserole until lightly browned, about 2 minutes. Transfer the pork to a side dish, leaving the drippings in the pan. (Otherwise, coat the casserole with 1/8 inch of olive oil.) 2. Heat the drippings or oil in the pan over medium-high heat. Add the chicken, before careful not to crowd the pan. (You may need to work in batches). Cook the chicken, turning frequently, until nicely browned on all sides. Carefully pour the Cognac or Armagnac into the pan, let it become bubbling hot, and then, if desired-and if you're brave-ignite the sauce with a match. Let it flame for a minute, tilting the pan by its handle and swirling the sauce to burn off alcohol. To extinguish the flames, simply cover the pan with its lid. 3. Season the chicken pieces with salt and pepper. Add the bay leaf and thyme to the pan and place the onions around the chicken. Cover and simmer gently, turning the chicken once, for about 10 minutes. 4. Uncover the pan, sprinkle the flour over everything, and turn the chicken and onions so the flour is absorbed by the sauce. Cover and cook, turning once or twice, for 3 to 4 minutes more. 5. Remove the pan from the heat and gradually stir and swirl in the wine and enough stock or bouillon to almost cover the chicken. Add the lardons or bacon, garlic, tomato paste, and mushrooms to the pan, cover, and gently simmer for 25 to 30 minutes. Test the chicken for doneness (there should be no trace of pink and the juices should run clear when the meat is pierced with a knife) and remove those pieces that are ready. Continue to cook the rest of the chicken a few minutes longer. If the onions are not quite tender, continue cooking them in the sauce, then return the chicken to the pan, add the mushrooms, and simmer 4 to 5 minutes. The sauce should be just thick enough to lightly coat the chicken and vegetables. If it is too thin, boil it d"

      "In a food processor, pulse the cauliflower until mostly finely chopped, about 5-7 pulses. (For my recipe, I ended up with 4 1/2 cups of cauliflower.) Melt the butter in a large skillet over med-high heat. Add the cauliflower and 1/2 t. salt. When you hear the cauliflower begin to sizzle, cover the skillet and cook for about 3 minutes, stirring once halfway through. Uncover the skillet and cook another 2 minutes, the cauliflower will be al dente. (If there is liquid pooled in the skillet at all make sure you let it evaporate, I didn't have this problem, but you want the cauliflower to not be wet.) Remove from heat and set aside to cool at least 10 minutes.",
      "Meanwhile, preheat oven to 200 degrees. When cauliflower has cooled, add to a large bowl along with minced onion, Parmesan and cheddar cheeses, egg and egg yolk, parsley, paprika, a few grindings of fresh black pepper and panko breadcrumbs. Mix well. If the mixture seems too loose to make patties, add more breadcrumbs, a tablespoon or two at a time until the mix holds together better.",
      "Using a measuring cup, scoop out 1/3 c. portions and firmly pat into a patty shape. Set patties aside on a plate. You should have about 8 patties.",
      "Wipe out the skillet used to cook the cauliflower. Place back on the burner at medium-high heat. Add 2 T. vegetable oil to the skillet and heat until the oil starts to shimmer. Carefully lay half the patties in the hot oil and cook until golden brown about 2 minutes per side, being careful that they don't fall apart when you flip them. Remove to a paper towel-lined baking sheet and place into the oven to keep warm. Wipe out the skillet then repeat this step with the remaining oil and cauliflower cakes. Serve hot."

      "Cherry Almond Scones:\n\nPreheat your oven to 400 degrees if it is on regular or 375 if you are using a convection oven; Line a baking sheet with parchment paper; set aside.\n\nWash your fresh cherries and use a pairing knife to cut them in half and remove all of the pits. Leave half of the cherries in halves and cut the rest into quarters. (I like to do this just for blending purposes, but you don't have to do this) Next, spread your cut cherries onto a baking sheet and place them into the freezer to flash freeze them until you are ready to work them into your dough. This step isn't 100% necessary, however, when it comes time to work the cherries into your dough, it is much easier to work with frozen cherries, and this will also help to ensure your dough doesn't turn pink from the fresh cherry juices.",
      "Meanwhile, prepare your scone dough. In a small mixing bowl, whisk together buttermilk, cream, egg, vanilla, almond extract and lemon zest; Place in the refrigerator until ready to use. \n\nNext, in a large mixing bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, baking soda, baking powder, salt, cinnamon and ginger until evenly combined. Add in your cubes of cold butter and lightly toss to coat each of the butter cubes with the flour mixture. Begin working the butter into the dry ingredients with your fingers or with a pastry cutter until most of the butter chunks are the size of peas, with a few larger almond sized chunks.",
      "Drizzle the cream & buttermilk mixture over the dry ingredients and use a fork to gently fold the wet into the dry ingredients until a ragged dough forms and turn the ragged dough out onto a cool lightly flour work surface. Now it is time to begin folding the cherries into the dough.",
      "Dust the dough with some additional flour if needed and sprinkle with 1/4 cup of your prepared frozen cherries. Gently fold the right half of the dough over onto the left half; sprinkle the top of the dough with another 1/4 cup of the frozen cherries and gently press them down into the dough sprinkle with additional flour if your dough is quite wet. Next, fold the left half of the dough onto the right half of the dough; sprinkle with another 1/4 cup of the frozen cherries and gently press them into the dough. Next, gently fold one half of the dough over onto the other half one final time.",
      "Gently pat/shape your dough into a 3/4-1 inch thick disk, and use a sharp knife to cut the disk into 8 equal parts. Place the 8 scones onto your prepared baking sheet; Brush the tops the melted butter and sprinkle with coarse sugar and slices almonds.",
      "Place the tray into the oven and bake for 20-25 minutes or until the tops are golden brown and the tops spring back to your touch. Note - your scones will cook a bit faster if you are using a convection oven.",
      "Almond Glaze: \n\nWhile your scones are baking, prepare your almond glaze. In a small mixing bowl, whisk together milk, icing sugar, vanilla and almond extract until a thick yet still fluid glaze forms. You may need to add additional icing sugar or milk to achieve the desired consistency. \n\nOnce your scones are ready to take out of the oven, remove them and place the tray onto a wired cooling rack. Allow the Scones to cool for 10 minutes and drizzle the glaze over the tops. Allow the scones to cool with the glaze on top for about another 5 minutes before serving. \n\nServe the scones slightly warm or completely cooled - either way... they will be delicious :D"

      "Time to cook the pork. The two pieces took approx 45-55 minutes to cook. Remove the pork from the fridge an hour prior to cooking it. Place the pieces of pork on separate baking sheets and and switch shelves half way through the cooking time. After approx 45-50 minutes I placed each piece of pork under the broiler for 5 minutes to ensure a browned and crisp skin. Isn't it beautiful!!!",

      "Allow the pork to rest for at least 10 minutes to let the juices redistribute into the meat.",
      "For the applesauce... While the pork is cooking you can get the applesauce cooked. To a large saute pan, over medium heat, add the butter, apples, rosemary, sugar, cinnamon and salt. Cook for approx 8-10 minutes until slightly softened.",
      "Add in the water and simmer for another 10 minutes. Using an immersion blender, carefully blend the mixture to the consistency of your preference. Once again, allow the applesauce to simmer for another 5 minutes or so. I served it warm over the pork.",

      "While the potatoes are cooking, place the butter and garlic into a small pot and cook until the garlic has softened a bit. Add the light cream and allow to simmer on low for 10-15 minutes. You do not want it to boil! The next step is your choice, you can either remove the garlic cloves from the liquid or leave them in.",

You can use the spine to make some chicken stock what you can later use as a base for a soup or freeze for the time you will need it. \nWith removing the spine you have cut down the baking time of the chicken and also making it bake more evenly.",
      "It is time to add all the ingredients on the chicken and rub it all in. Give your chicken a well deserved massage and ensure all is well spread.",
      "Put in your chicken now with the top down on your roasting pan and put in the oven. If you want your skin perfect on top you can put it with the skin on top from the beginning.",
      "It is time now to prepare your side dishes. Cut your potatoes in pieces (I leave the skin on). Peel your carrots and cut them in half if they are too big. Peel your onion and cut them in quarters. Add your vegetables to your chicken and also ad 1 - 1 1/2 cup of water into your roasting pan.",
      "Set your timer for 30 minutes and you do not have to bother with anything for a while. When the time is up turn around your chicken to obtain a nice grilled crisp from both sides. Set your timer for additional 30 minutes (total time about 1 hr 15 min). When the time is up check your chicken that it is cooked all the way to the bone. You can also use a thermometer. If so I am happy if the temperature has reached 75 C.",
      "If your chicken is not ready you should put it back to the oven. If you are concerned the skin will burn put a silver foil over it to prevent burning. \n\nWhen your chicken is ready set it out to rest for few minutes. \n\nYour chicken is ready please be served and eaten. Enjoy."
