This is so that you don't have floaty things in the soup later (personally I often miss this step and don't mind the results at all). If you decide to miss cleaning everything just move straight to step 4 right away. Otherwise, you need to add 6 cups (or more, you need enough to cover them) clean cold water before step 4.",
      "Add the garlic, seasonings and the chopped vegetables.",
      "Bring the pot back to a boil, turn down and simmer 1 1/2 to 2 hours or until the pork hock is loosened and tender.",

Lay the slices down and cut these into 1'8\" slices across the width of the beet. This method gives the prettiest presentation.",
      "Add the potato to the pot and return the soup to a slow boil, then add the beet slices. DO NOT LET THE SOUP BOIL ONCE THE BEETS ARE ADDED OR IT WILL LOSE IT'S COLOR.",
      "While this is coming up to heat, clean the pork hock and return them to the pot. Make sure to get all the ugly bits and fat, but leave the meat as whole as you can, better to shred it in you bowl! Trust me!",
      "Leave this to simmer very slowly until the potato is cooked and the beets are tender. Meanwhile, chop the beet stalks (if they are tender) and the leaves; and peel and grate the final 2 beets.",
      "Add the peas and tops/leaves to the pot. When the peas are cooked add the grated beets (this is more to thicken the soup and add back any color that may have been lost before; and also DH loves the addition of shredded beat to this cause that's the way his mom made borscht). Continue to cook VERY SLOWLY.",
      "Once everything is tender you can finally add the dill and 1/2 teaspoon of sour salt. Tasting is important here, I usually add about 1 1/2 teaspoons of sour salt myself, but I prefer it a bit sour.",
      "I taste all the way through because I love the way the flavor builds, but it is very important at the end. Adjust the dill, salt and sour salt carefully, with some practice you'll find a soup that everyone loves.",
      "Add more water if this soup begins looking dry, but it is a thick soup so doesn't require a lot of broth - cream will be added at the table.",
      "You can park the soup overnight in the fridge and remove all the fat that rises the next day. This soup is excellent on day 1 but even better day 2, and healthier when the fat is removed.",
      "The broth shouldn't be sweet (the sweetness will happen with every bite) and it should have a bit of a sour tang (I like mine quite sour)and a taste of dill (and quite dilly). The soup SHOULD NEVER be salty because the meat may call for some seasoning in the bowl.",
      "This soup is better the next day, and may be put in jars and canned (10 minutes in a water bath) or frozen (but I find the beans go off when it's frozen so would leave them out in this case).",

Then place the covered yogurt container inside the crockpot, making sure the water does not enter the yogurt. You can then use a thermometer to monitor the water temperature, and adjust your crockpot during the incubation period to maintain ideal temperature."

      "Put the rack into the insert pan and make sure the handles are up, not tucked below. Put the bird in the insert pan on top of the rack. Don't add water to the pan. Put the insert pan back into the roasting pan. If your roaster doesn't have an insert pan, it's ok - just be very careful putting the bird into that hot oven, you don't want to burn your hands on the sides of the oven! Cover.",
      "Roast at highest setting for 30 minutes. The butter/oil, seasonings and the searing time will make the skin beautifully browned and perfect!",
      "After 30 minutes, turn the oven temperature down to 325.",
      "The turkey will self-baste if you do not lift the lid, so you don't have to baste it every 20 minutes like you do in your conventional oven. DO NOT LIFT LID during cooking time! Lifting the lid will increase cooking time because roaster ovens lose their heat unlike regular ovens. I've read that roaster ovens effectively 'steam' the turkey making the meat come out -- well, steamed. This is not true as you will find out. Similar to the roasted chickens you can get at your supermarket, the bird will come out moist and perfectly roasted. Why do you think they call it a Roaster Oven?.",

      "Check your turkey EARLY. Really start watching the temp an hour before it's supposed to be done. Your turkey will almost certainly be done before the suggested cooking time. Watch your wired meat thermometer. If using a pop-up turkey plug type thermometer, check by lifting the lid quickly so the oven doesn't lose its heat. If necessary, check after another 30 minutes, but I doubt you'll have to do that. I say check after 30 minutes because it's really OK to let the bird roast a little extra - you won't dry it out using my method if you let it go for 1/2 hour.",
      "When done, remove the turkey from the roaster, tent with foil, and let rest for 20 minutes. This allows the juices to really seep into the meat, so they say.",

      "Use the cold plate test to check set after 15 minutes of cooking: take the pot of jam off the heat (if you don't remove the jam from the heat while you check the set, it could over-cook and become rubbery or hard if the jam is indeed already set) place a drop of the jam mixture on one of the saucers you've kept in the freezer, & place the plate back in the freezer for 1 minute. After 1 minute, take the saucer out of the freezer and nudge the drop of jam with your finger. If it \"wrinkles\" when you nudge it with your finger it is done. If the jam is not set, continue cooking over medium-high heat, checking the set again every 5 minutes."

      "you will need an open (no lid) deep fryer , if you only have the kind with filters and lids , just don't close them, the steam has to be able to leave very fast else you loose crunchiness.",
      "Peel your potatoes , and cut them lengthwise into discs of about 1/4 inch thick (they can be a bit thicker if you like that) . Then slice the discs lengthwise into fries of the same thickness.",
      "Make sure your sink is clean , and wash your fries in cold water . Drain the water , and wash them again in new clean water. Repeat this a few times until no starch comes off the potatoes and the water stays clear. Dry your fries well , so there is no more moisture on their sides.",
      "First cooking . Put the thermostat for your oil to approximately 320\u00b0F or 160\u00b0C , not higher . Put a small to medium amount of fries in the cooking basket ( you will have to do this multiple times , if you put in too much fries at once you will loose your temperature and your fries will turn out horrible) . Make sure all fries are under by shaking the basket . During cooking you can shake the basket a few times so you know they're not sticking together. Important: To check if the first cooking is done lift your basket out and pinch a fry if you can pinch all the way through they are done (if you do it fast you will certainly not burn your fingers ), they should still look pale and white , stay with your cooking for this , timing is important.(repeat until they are all done , and let your fat heat up to the appropriate temperature each time).",
      "Take out the fries , shake them and put them in a big bowl to cool off , once they are cooled to room temperature they are ok to start the second cooking . you can keep these at room temperature for hours until you are ready to serve the meal , in fact leaving them a bit will only make them better , just put a towel over the bowl , no need to put them in the fridge(where condensationwould coat them).",
      "Second cooking. Put the thermostat of your oil at approximately 370\u00b0F-374\u00b0F or 185\u00b0C-190\u00b0C , this is usually the highest setting , or just below that . Put a _small_ amount of the precooked fries in your basket . fry them while shaking the basket in the oil a few times during cooking , you can even take the basket out a few times to throw them in the air (not really needed , but supposed to be good tor making bubbles appear on them :) . They are ready when they are a rich golden brown in color . I put them in a deep plate with a paper towel at the bottom , and use a paper towel to quickly rub the excess fat off them before i serve(paper towel on top hand on paper towel , make a circular movement , take out towel). add a bit of fine salt , and serve. best with a T bone steak or sirloin *grinn* but as you know , fries go with just about anything :).",
      "A bit of added history : The French will be the first to say that \"les frites\" come from Belgium. And it being true that Belgians have made and perfected the stuff for years and years, the origin of deep frying potatoes in oil comes from a monastery in Spain.",
