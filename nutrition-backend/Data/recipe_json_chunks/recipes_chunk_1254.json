(If the dough is too crumbly, add a little more water; if it's too wet, add a little more flour.) Turn the dough onto the work surface (not floured) and knead by hand for 8-10 mins until the dough is elastic. Shape into a ball, rub it with a little oil then wrap tightly in plastic wrap or foil. Leave it to rest at room temperature for 30 mins.",

Brush around the filling with egg white. Lay the other 2 sheets of pasta dough over the top and use your fingers to press around the filling to seal it in. Use a pastry wheel or a knife to cut around the filling so the ravioli are about 2 inches square. Put them on floured baking sheets.",
