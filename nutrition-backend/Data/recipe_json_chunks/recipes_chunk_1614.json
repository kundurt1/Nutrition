      "To make crust: Butter a 10-inch tart pan with a removable bottom. Cream the butter and sugar in a bowl with a mixer on medium speed. Add the whole egg, then the vanilla. Whisk the all-purpose flour, almond flour, lemon zest, cinnamon and cloves in a bowl. With the mixer on medium speed, gradually add the dry ingredients to the butter mixture. Reduce the mixer speed to low and mix in up to 1 tablespoon water until the dough just comes together. Wrap two-thirds of the dough in plastic wrap, then wrap the remaining one-third in plastic wrap. Refrigerate both for 30 minutes.",
      "Meanwhile, to make filling: Heat large saucepan on medium high and add blueberries. Stir as blueberries start to soften - about 3 to 5 minutes. Add sugar, jam, lemon juice, and cinnamon. Continue to stir and bring to a slight boil. Turn down heat, add cornstarch and stir well. Bring mixture to a simmer and continue to stir while mixture thickens. (Note: you may want to add more cornstarch depending upon how thick you want your filling. I have a family that likes what I call...runny pies.) Remove from heat.",
      "Put the larger piece of dough between 2 sheets of parchment paper and roll it out into an 11-inch round. Remove the top sheet of parchment paper and invert the dough into the prepared tart pan; peel off the other sheet of parchment paper and trim the excess dough.",
      "Spread the filling evenly on the crust.",
      "Roll out the remaining dough to about 1/4 inch thick and cut it into 1/2- to 1-inch-wide strips (10 to 14 strips). Arrange the strips in a lattice pattern on top of the filling. (Note: I'm not coordinated enough to do a true lattice pattern (over under under over).) Beat the egg yolk with 1 tablespoon water and brush on the lattice and edge of the crust. Bake until the crust is golden and the filling is bubbly, about 30 minutes. Let cool completely."

Remove the strainer and add enough heavy cream to the raspberry juice to total 3/4 cup.",

Cook over medium heat for six minutes and then crank the heat to medium-high and cook for roughly eight minutes or until the sugar mixture is dark amber in color. Make sure not to burn the sugar (the mixture goes from pale amber to dark amber very quickly).",
      "As soon as that happens, turn the heat off and carefully pour in the cream and raspberry mixture. Everything will bubble vigorously, but remain calm and carefully whisk the mixture. Add the butter, salt, and sugar mixture, and continue whisking.",
      "Once the bubbling subsides, turn the heat back on to medium-low and cook for another five minutes, stirring often. Remove from heat and set aside. The caramel will thicken up as it cools and will keep in the refrigerator for 5-7 days.",

In a mixing bowl and using a metal balloon whisk, whisk together the egg yolk, mustard and white wine vinegar until thoroughly blended.",

I use groundnut oil as olive oil would be far too strong. Any light-flavoured oil - sunflower or vegetable - will do. Gradually the mixture will emulsify, becoming thicker, velvety and smooth.",

      "Mix in the capers, gherkins, shallot and parsley. Add these in to your taste; your palate should dictate. Where possible, I'd recommend setting the tartare sauce for an hour to let the flavours develop before serving. Don't forget to taste it again before serving to adjust the flavouring.",
      "Now prepare the buttered potatoes. Place the potatoes in large pan of water, bring to the boil and boil until tender. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the hot potatoes to a dish containing the cubed butter, season with a pinch of salt and add in the mint leaves. Cover the dish with cling film and set aside for 20 minutes.",

Then use the bottom of a standard size mug (should be about 3 inches in diameter) to press each burger down until it is about 1/2 inch thick.",
      "Bake the burgers on one side for 20 minutes. Then flip the burgers and bake on the other side for 5 minutes.",
      "Allow the patties to rest on paper towels for 5 minutes before serving to remove any excess oil."

Make sure the butter is room temperature before mixing, or else you're going to have a hard time. You can put the butter in the microwave and heat it up at 15 seconds, checking on it every time, to soften it. Once you have the butter done, put it aside and proceed with separating the skin from the breast with a spoon. Go slowly making sure not to break the skin in the process. Stuff the herb butter on each side once you're done and smooth the butter flat underneath the skin by press your fingers against it.",
      "You will want to generously salt and pepper the inside of the cavity with about 1 TSP of each. Give the inside a good rub to make sure it is properly seasoned. Pat the chicken dry with some paper towels, this allows the wet rub to stay on the chicken.",
      "Next we'll move onto making the wet rub for the chicken. Grab a pestle and mortar and add 2 sliced garlic cloves, 2 TBS of fresh thyme leaves, the zest of a whole lemon, 2 TSP of salt, and 1 TSP of pepper. Grind the ingredients until it looks like a thick past, add the juice of half a lemon and continue grinding until it is smooth. Pour in 1 TBS of oil, stir until it is incorporated and spoon it over the chicken. If you do not have a pestle and mortar, you mince the garlic, lemon, thyme and then have it sit in the oil with the rest of the seasonings for 15 minutes before rubbing it on the chicken.",
      "Chop the vegetables roughly, and mix them with the seasonings in the roasting pan. You don't need too much oil, as you already have the oil and butter from the chicken dripping down.",
      "Stuff the chicken with a couple cloves of garlic, thyme sprigs and lemon wedges. Then tie the legs up and place it on the vegetables. Place two bay leaves underneath the chicken and put everything into a pre-heated 375F oven, for 1.5 hours or until an internal temperature of 180F at the thickest part of the chicken.",
      "If you're not sure if the chicken will be thoroughly cooked, you can start the roast with the back of the chicken facing up for about 40 minutes, flip it over and finish it for about 1 hour or so. Piercing the thickest part of the chicken and seeing if the juice is running clear is a good way to tell if it's done. Or a crazier method would be to get a paring knife and stick it the thickest part of the chicken for a couple of seconds, take it out and see if the tip of the knife is hot against inside part of your arm.",
      "Once your chicken is thoroughly cooked through, take it of the oven and put aside to rest. Pour the drippings into a sauce pan, if you used a cast iron pan take everything off and put it on the stove over medium to medium low heat. Skim the fat of the drippings and add a TBS of flour to thicken the gravy. Whisk the flour for a minute or so, and then add any other juices from chicken as well as the some lemon juice from the roasted chicken. Make sure to add the lemon juice in small portions so it doesn't get too tart. Give a splash of water or chicken stock, and season to taste with salt and pepper."

      "Place coffee beans, peppercorns and dried onion in a coffee grinder or (preferably) a spice grinder.",
      "I used my coffee grinder but promptly washed it, so my coffee wouldn't be oniony!) Grind the mixture until fine. Place in a small bowl and mix in the kosher salt and Ferneau (or other) seasoning. Using your hands, press the mixture over all surfaces of the tenderloins.",
      "Heat a large nonstick skillet with about one tablespoon of olive oil. When hot, sear the tenderloins, one at a time, turning after about one minute on each side. Look for a crisp, dark sear without being burnt. (Even a little burnt will be OK.)",
      "At this point, you can store the tenderloin overnight or up to 24 hours in the fridge. This allows the flavors to infuse into the meat, and also allows for my favorite Sunday morning food trick - the slow cooker.",
      "Place the loins into an 8 qt. slow cooker. Whisk the orange concentrate into the apple juice or water and pour it in. Cover and set to high for 4 hours or low for 8. I did mine on high, and when we got home from church, the loins were beautifully moist and tender, even at the higher temperature.",
      "When they're done, remove the tenderloins to a platter and allow to rest for at least 15 minutes. This makes them easier to slice without shredding that beautiful, dark crust. Meanwhile, dump the juice left in the slow cooker into a small saucepan. (If you trimmed the loins well, don't worry about skimming fat, but you can if you want.) Heat the juices to a simmer. Whisk the cornstarch into the half and half, then stir into the juices. It will thicken quickly, so whisk constantly until smooth and the consistency you want. It should be plenty seasoned from the crust, but taste it at the end and see if it needs",
      "While your gravy is heating (or holding), cook one or two eggs over easy or medium in another nonstick skillet, or poach 'em if you know how. After the flip (or extraction from poaching water), sprinkle with matcha salt and freshly ground pepper. Repeat until you have one egg for each diner. Then go apply for a job as a short order cook.",
      "Slice the loin, top with gravy, and serve with the egg and a nice salad. Yummers."

Pull the edges of the dough in toward the center like an envelope, using the dough scraper at first and then your fingers as the dough gets less sticky. Continue this, constantly pulling and then pushing down on the center with your palms, adding a little flour as needed to prevent sticking.
