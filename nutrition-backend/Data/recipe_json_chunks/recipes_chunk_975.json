Transfer crumbs to medium bowl, drizzle melted butter over, and mix with rubber spatula until evenly moistened. Turn crumbs into prepared springform pan and, using hand, spread crumbs into even layer. Using flat-bottomed ramekin or drinking glass, press crumbs evenly into pan bottom, then use a soup spoon to press and smooth crumbs into edges of pan. Bake until fragrant and browned about the edges, about 15 minutes. Cool on wire rack",
      "FILLING: Bring about 4 quarts water to simmer in stockpot. Whisk sugar, spices, and salt in small bowl; set aside. To dry pumpkin see instructions below In standing mixer fitted with flat beater, beat cream cheese at medium speed to break up and soften slightly, about 1 minute. Scrape beater and bottom and sides of bowl well with rubber spatula. Add about one third of sugar mixture and beat at medium-low speed until combined, about 1 minute; scrape bowl and add remaining sugar in two additions, scraping bowl after each addition. Add pumpkin and vanilla and beat at medium speed until combined, about 45 seconds; scrape bowl. Add 3 eggs and beat at medium-low until incorporated, about 1 minute; scrape bowl. Add remaining 2 eggs and beat at medium-low until incorporated, about 45 seconds; scrape bowl. Add heavy cream and bourbon and beat at low speed until combined, about 45 seconds. Using rubber spatula, scrape bottom and sides of bowl and give final stir by hand. Set springform pan with cooled crust on 18-inch-square doubled layer heavy-duty foil and wrap bottom and sides with foil; set wrapped set wrapped springform pan in roasting pan. Pour filling into springform pan and smooth surface; set roasting pan in oven and pour enough boiling water to come about halfway up side of springform pan. Bake until center of cake is slightly wobbly when pan is shaken, and center of cake registers 145 to 150 degrees on instant-read thermometer, about 1 1/2 hours see note. Set roasting pan on wire rack and use paring knife to loosen cake from sides of pan. Cool until water is just warm, about 45 minutes.Remove springform pan from water bath, discard foil, and set on wire rack; continue to cool until barely warm, about 3 hours. Wrap with plastic wrap and refrigerate until chilled, at least 4 hours or up to 3 days.",

Grasp bottom towels and fold pumpkin in half; peel back towels. Repeat and flip pumpkin onto baking sheet; discard towels.

      "Brown Sugar and Bourbon Cream:When ready to serve cheesecake, add bourbon and beat mixture with whisk attachment at medium speed until small bubbles form around edges, about 40 seconds; increase speed to high and continue to beat until fluffy and doubled in volume, about 1 minute longer. Spoon cream on individual slices of cheesecake.",
      "Note:Depending on the oven and the temperature of the ingredients, the cheesecake may bake about 15 minutes faster or slower than the instructions indicate; it is therefore best to check the cake 1 1/4 hours into baking. Although the cheesecake can be made up to three days in advance, the crust will begin to lose its crispness after only one day. To make slicing the cheesecake easy and neat, use a knife with a narrow blade, such as a carving knife; between cuts, dip the blade into a pitcher of hot water and wipe it clean with paper towels. The cheesecake is good on its own, but the Brown Sugar and Bourbon Cream is a grand addition."

      "Take the dough out of the refrigerator, unwrap the plastic, and cut the ball in half. Rewrap and return 1 of the balls to the refrigerator, until ready for the top crust. Let the dough rest on the counter for 15 minutes so it will be pliable enough to roll out.",

      "Crimp the edges of dough together with your fingers to make a tight seal. Cut slits in the top of the pie so steam can escape while baking. Place the pie on a sheet tray and tent it with a piece of aluminum foil, so the crust does not cook faster than the apples.",

Let the apple pie rest at room temperature for at least 1 hour to allow the fruit pectin to gel and set; otherwise the pie will fall apart when you cut into it."

      "DAY BEFORE CANNING: Cut the pumpkin into large chunks, discarding the stems, seeds, and stringy innards attached to them. Pare the skin from the chunks. Slice each chunk into pieces 1/2\" to 3/4\" square, as evenly as you can. Stir to combine the pumpkin pieces in a large glass or ceramic bowl with the sugar, lemon juice and zest, and 1/2 cup water. Cover and let the mixture sit overnight, or a few hours longer, at room temperature. It will give off a good bit of liquid.",
      "DAY OF CANNING: Prepare 5 or 6 half-pint canning jars by washing thoroughly. Place the jars on a rack in a boiling water canner, but DO NOT add water yet!",
      "Spoon the pumpkin mixture into a large heavy saucepan and bring it to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat to a bare simmer and cook, covered, until the pumpkin pieces are quite tender, but still hold their shape and have become somewhat translucent in a glaze of thick syrup, about 30 minutes.",
      "As soon as you have reduced the heat for the pumpkin mixture, fill the canner with water; water should be at least 1 inch above the tops of the jars. You may need to add 1 cup of white vinegar if you have hard water in your area. Boil the jars for 10 minutes to sterilize. It will take about 20--30 minutes for the water to come to a boil. Start timing from the time it reaches a good steady boil.",
      "While pumpkin is cooking, blanch the lemon slices in a small saucepan of boiling water, just enough to soften them, and drain. Stir the lemon slices into the chips just before removing the preserves from the heat.",
      "Once the jars have sterilized and the pumpkin is ready, remove jars from canner to a surface covered in heavy towels or layers of newspaper. (NEVER place hot jars on a bare countertop, as the difference in temperature could cause jars to shatter!) Spoon the chips into the hot jars, leaving at least 1/4-inch head space.",
      "Process the jars in a boiling water canner for 10 minutes. Refrigerate jars after opening."

    "title": "southern fried chicken tacos with bacon gravy",
    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "To make the marinade, mix the buttermilk and chipotle peppers in a medium sized bowl and mix to combine. Add a 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt. Add the chicken tenders and marinade in the refrigerator for 30 minutes. If you want spicier chicken, you can marinade up to 2 hours.",
      "To make the roasted corn salsa, heat a barbecue grill or grill pan and heat to medium heat. Spray with a non stick cooking spray. Grill the corn on all sides until slightly charred but cooked through. Remove from the grill and cut the kernels off. In a small bowl, mix together the charred corn kernels, cherry tomatoes, avocado and a pinch of kosher salt and pepper and set aside.",
      "To make the bacon gravy, heat a large saute pan to medium heat. Add the bacon and cook until browned and cooked through on both sides. Remove the bacon to a paper towel lined plate to drain. Once drained and cool, chop the bacon into 1/2 inch pieces and set aside. Remove all but 1 tablespoon of bacon grease left in the saute pan and heat the pan to medium heat. Add 2 tablespoons of flour to the pan. Cook the flour for about 2 minutes, stirring continuously. Slowly pour in the milk and whisk. Cook until the gravy thickens up, but not too thick, about 3-4 minutes. Add the kosher salt, pepper and the crisp bacon to the gravy and mix. Turn the heat off the stove but keep the gravy warm.",
      "To fry the chicken, heat a cast iron skillet or large saute pan to medium heat. Add 1 cup canola oil. Remove the chicken tenders from the marinade and drain. Discard the marinade. Put the flour and taco seasoning in a large zip lock bag. Put the chicken tenders in the flour mixture, close the top of the bag and shake so that the chicken tenders are fully coated with the flour mixture. Remove the tenders and put on a wire rack for 10 minutes to set up. Add the canola oil to a large frying pan and heat to medium-high heat. Test the oil by dropping in a few pinches of flour in the oil to see if it sizzles. When the oil is ready, put the chicken tenders in to fry. Cook for about 2-3 minutes on each side or until the tenders are light golden brown and cooked through. When done, remove the chicken tenders from the oil and put on a paper towel lined plate to drain. Lightly season with kosher salt.",
      "Heat a saute pan to medium heat and rub a little canola oil around the pan. Put one tortilla at a time in the pan and heat for about 30 seconds on each side, or until the tortilla has a little color. Put aside and keep warm.",
      "Heat the mashed potatoes up by following the directions on the package. Keep warm.",
      "To make the tacos, spread a nice helping of mashed potatoes on top of the warm tortilla and then put one chicken tender on top. Drizzle the bacon gravy on top. Top with the salsa and serve.",
      "**If your chicken tenders are slightly larger than normal, cut the chicken tenders in half lengthways. Tenders on the taco should be just a little fatter than your index finger.",
      "Makes 8 tacos or serves 4."

      "Sift the flour into a bowl then add the sugar , cinnamon and the salt if you are using it. Add the butter chunks evenly over the surface of the flour.",
      "Using your thumb and forefingers, rub the butter into the flour (this is easier with smaller chunks of butter). Continue until the butter is all incorporated. The mix should resemble biscuit/bread crumbs when it is ready.",
      "Add the water a little at a time, mixing thoroughly with a good sized spoon. When the mix reaches a smooth (and slightly sticky) consistency (which should look like cookie-dough), shape it into a ball and wrap it in cling film. Refrigerate the dough for 1 hour.",
      "When the dough is nearly chilled, start making the filling. Peel, de-core and cut the apples into orange-segment-sized wedges. Place them in cold water if you are leaving them for any length of time to prevent them from browning.",
      "Mix the water, muscavado and light-brown sugars, cinnamon, lemon juice (and nutmeg & cloves if being used) in a jug/bowl.",
      "Melt the butter on a medium-high heat in a deep pan. Put the apples in and stir gently for 2-3 minutes.",
      "Add the liquid mix to the pan, keeping the heat at medium-high. Keep gently folding the mixture for 5 minutes until the apples begin to look mushy/fluffy (as boiled and shaken potatoes do). The apples will break up to some degree during this process - this is perfectly fine. The apples should all be darkened in colour if you've done this bit right. Leave the filling to cool in the air for about 10 minutes. During this time the fruit will begin to congeal a little more.",
      "Take the dough from the fridge. Divide it into two balls and roll each one out into a disc, each slightly larger than the top of an 8\" diameter pie dish (by about 1\" all round). Use a lightly floured surface to prevent sticking; rubbing flour onto the rolling pin will also help. By rolling one way then the other, you can easily achieve a neat circle. I prefer to use my hands to shape and flatten the dough however.",
      "Rub butter onto the pie dish (including the up-facing lip/edge of the dish). Place the first dough-disc squarely into the dish - make sure it sits flat against the walls of the dish and that it covers the lip of the dish, with a little extra (which you will trim in a minute).",
      "It is time to add the filling now - but make sure you drain it well! Either sieve off the liquid or use a slotted spoon to remove as much liquid as possible - if the filling is too wet the pasty will not cook properly. You can keep the liquid to drink, warmed, as a delicious punch, or even use as a sauce if you don't like creamy/custard like sauces on your pie. If you refrigerate it this sauce will thicken up a bit.",
      "Next whisk up the egg and 2 tablespoons of water. Paint the mixture onto the lip of the pastry (using a pastry brush or your fingertips). This will glue the two halves together.",
      "Now place your other pastry disc on top of the pie. Using a sharp knife, cut down through the top of the pastry to remove the excess. Use the edge of the pie dish to guide your knife - the pastry should be flush with the edge of the dish.",
      "Using one or two fingers, work around the edge of the pie, crimping the pastry together. As well as adding an attractive fluted edge to the crust, this will help to glue the edges together.",
      "Cut a series of 3 or 4 slashes into the top of the pastry, ensuring you go right through. This will allow trapped air to escape and prevent the pastry from cracking open in an uncontrolled manner during cooking. If you have a pie-spout you can use this instead.",
      "Glaze the top of the pie with more of the egg glaze mix (don't feel that you must use all of it - you'll make the pasty soggy if you do!).",
      "Use a sieve to dust the top with the icing sugar and cinnamon.",
      "Place in a preheated oven, middle shelf at around 180 Celcius. Cook for around 30-40 minutes (fan assisted ovens will be quicker).",
      "When the top is browned and the pastry is firm all over take the dish from the oven and cool on a wire rack for around 20-30 minutes. DO NOT remove the pie from the dish until it has cooled as it will most likely disintegrate!",
      "To make the Creme Anglaise sauce, place the milk in a pan. Add the sugar and vanilla (if using vanilla pods, you can use the seeds from a pod, and or the pod itself. I have successfully used a pod which has been in a box of sugar for 3 months to make vanilla sugar and it worked perfectly). Heat gently for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally to allow the vanilla to infuse into the milk properly.",
      "In a jug/bowl, place the cornflour and add a little milk (roughly 1 tablespoon milk to 2 tablespoons of cornflour). Stir thoroughly until it forms a thick paste, adding a little more milk if necessary.",
      "Pour the mix into the milk pan, stirring it in thoroughly. Bring the milk to a boil, stirring continuously all the while.

      "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Spray an 8 1/2\" spring form pan generously with non stick cooking spray. Roll out one sheet of the puff pastry to a 1/4\" thick and cut out a 9\" circle. Place this circle in the bottom of the spring form pan with the extra 1/2\" going up the sides. Roll out the second piece of puff pastry to 1/4\" thick and cut an 8\" circle out. Set aside, this will be the \"lid\" of your torte. Roll out the remaining 2 sheets of puff pastry to a 1/4\" thickness and cut rectangles out to wrap around the inside of the spring form pan leaving a 1\" overhang at the top. Use water where puff pastry seams meet. Press the puff pastry against the pan for a smooth fit. Cover everything with plastic wrap and place in the refrigerator for 1 hour.",
      "For Eggs: In a medium skillet, melt butter over low heat. In a medium mixing bowl, whisk the eggs, herbs, nutmeg, salt and pepper. Pour the egg mixture into the skillet and gently stir the eggs around in the pan constantly. The eggs should be loosely scrambled since they will cook again in the torte. Slide the eggs onto a plate and cover with plastic wrap. Cool eggs completely before using.",
      "To Assemble the Torte: (Have egg wash on hand) Remove the pastry lined pan from the refrigerator. Layer the ingredients in this order, making sure to spread each layer to the edge of the spring form pan: 1. Half the eggs 2. Half the spinach 3. Half the cheese 4. Half the sausage 5. All the peppers 6. Remaining Sausage 7. Remaining Cheese 8. Remaining Spinach 9. Remaining Eggs",
      "Fold the puff pastry overhang onto the ingredients. Brush with egg wash and then place the 8\" circle or \"lid\" on top, gently pushing it down to seal the pastry along the sides. Cut a vent in the center using a sharp small knife and cut other decorative lines in the top to create a design. Make sure to only cut halfway through the pastry. Brush torte with egg wash and place in the refrigerator for 1 hour.",
      "Place the torte on a baking tray. Brush again with the remaining egg wash. Bake for 1 hour and 15 minutes, or until the top is golden and puffed up. Remove from the oven and allow to rest until room temperature. Do not eat the torte hot or it will fall apart.",
