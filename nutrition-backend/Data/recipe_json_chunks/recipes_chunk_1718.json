      "If your arrangement seems sufficiently sturdy, continue to the next step.",
      "Set up a station for shaping the moon cakes near the whacking station, outfitting it with the following: a large work surface (such as a cutting board), flour for dusting, a small bowl of oil, a pastry brush, a rolling pin (preferably an Asian-style pin, which is essentially a 1-inch wood dowel), the dough pieces, the balls of filling, and the mold(s).",
      "Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper, oil the paper, and place them with the other tools.",
      "To shape each moon cake, first oil and flour the mold.",

      "Sprinkle in some flour and tap the mold against your hand to spread the flour evenly over the entire interior surface.",
      "Invert and tap the mold against the sink to remove excess flour.",
      "Set the prepared mold by your work area.",
      "Lightly flour the work surface and place a piece of dough on top of it.",
      "With a lightly floured hand, smack the dough to flatten it to a 1/4-inch-thick disk.",
      "Flip it over.",
      "Quickly dip 2 fingers into the oil and very lightly oil the rolling pin; this tiny bit of oil makes the dough easier to manipulate.",
      "With short, fast strokes, roll the dough away from its center, leaving a plump, roughly 1-inch-wide belly in the middle.",
      "With each roll, pick up the dough and give it a quarter turn to prevent sticking.",
      "When it is about 4 inches in diameter, stop turning the dough and make the final passes to create a circle 5 to 5 1/2 inches in diameter and a generous 1/8 inch thick at the edge.",
      "This Chinese method of rolling dough ensures an even thickness all around the cake.",
      "(If the dough sticks or breaks, scrape it up with a plastic dough scraper or knife, knead it back into a ball, and start over.",
      "It is a forgiving dough.)",
      "Pick up the dough circle and put it in one hand.",
      "Place a ball of filling in the center of the circle, and then invert the entire thing into the other hand; the dough will naturally droop over the filling.",
      "(The dough side that now faces you will be the pretty top of the cake.)",
      "Pass the ball back to the other hand so that the bottom of the cake now faces upward.",
      "Cupping the cake in one hand, use the fingers of your other hand to seal the dough, completely encasing the filling.",
      "Gently press, nudge, and mold the dough as needed.",
      "Once sealed, cup the ball in both hands and gently roll and pat it smooth.",
      "The pastry will take on a slight sheen.",
      "Place the ball, top side down, into the mold.",
      "Using the fleshy part of your hand between the base of your thumb and wrist, press the ball into the mold.",
      "Try to apply even pressure.",
      "Once the cake has filled the mold, go around the edge to press the pastry inward gently and away from the side walls of the mold.",
      "Th is helps the cake to release.",
      "To loosen the cake from the mold, step over to your whacking station.",
      "Take the handle of the mold and firmly whack it against the wood in this precise order: The first 4 whacks are applied to each side of the mold (left , top, right, and bottom).",
      "For the dramatic fifth and final whack, turn the mold so that the cake faces down and place your hand underneath to catch the cake as it falls out.",
      "Place the cake on the baking sheet.",
      "Repeat with the remaining dough and filling, spacing the cakes about 2 inches apart on the baking sheets.",
      "As you work, take note of the following: If the cake threatens to jump out of the mold while you are whacking, immediately reduce the amount of pressure and continue through the entire sequence.",
      "If you have to set the ball of filling and dough down at any time, place it on a floured surface to prevent sticking.",
      "Because the carved impressions dull as oil and flour accumulate in the mold, occasionally pause between shaping the cakes to clean out the mold.",
      "(Use 2 molds and you will clean less often.)",
      "For cleaning, use a toothpick, skewer, or the tip of a paring knife to dislodge bits.",
      "A hard spray of water from the sink faucet also helps.",
      "After spraying, dry the mold with paper towels before oiling and flouring it for the next cake.",
      "Position a rack in the lower third of the oven and preheat to 250F.",
      "Meanwhile, make the glaze by combining the egg yolks and caramel sauce in a small bowl and mixing with a fork until well blended.",
      "Pass the glaze through a fine-mesh sieve into another small bowl.",
      "Discard the solids and set the bowl aside.",
      "Fill the spray bottle halfway with water and set aside.",
      "Use a toothpick to poke 3 or 4 air vents into the top of each cake, about 1/4 inch deep.",
      "(This helps the cakes bake more evenly.)",
      "Flat toothpicks make less conspicuous holes than round ones.",
      "Baking moon cakes is a three-step process, and you must bake only 1 sheet at a time.",
      "Loosely cover the unbaked cakes on 1 sheet with parchment paper.",
      "Slip the other sheet into the oven and bake for 22 to 25 minutes, or until the cakes look dull and a little puffed.",
      "Remove from the oven, and immediately spray the cakes with water to soften the dough.",
      "Wait for about 2 minutes, or until the water is absorbed, and then use your fingers to push and straighten up the cakes.",
      "(They are not that hot.)",
      "This cosmetic surgery helps to produce prettier cakes.",
      "Ideally, the sides should be straight, not flared.",
      "The cakes should retain most of their out-of-the-mold appearance but be slightly puffed.",
      "Once you are satisfied with how the cakes look, brush the tops with the glaze and return the cakes to the oven.",
      "Bake this second time for 10 minutes.",
      "Remove the cakes from the oven, brush again with the glaze, and return to the oven.",
      "Bake for a final 10 minutes, or until the tops are richly colored and shiny.",
      "Remove from the oven and put on a rack to cool.",
      "When the cakes are cool enough to handle, after about 30 minutes, you may straighten any lopsided, unsightly cakes.",
      "While the first baking sheet cools, bake the second sheet.",
      "As the moon cakes cool, they darken from the caramel sauce in the dough and glaze.",
      "When they are completely cool, store them in an airtight plastic container.",
      "Before eating them, allow them to age for 1 to 2 days to soften the pastry and develop the flavors.",
      "They will keep at room temperature for up to 5 days and in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.",
      "Enjoy them at room temperature, cut into small wedges.",
      "To freeze, wrap each cake in plastic wrap and place the cakes on a baking sheet.",
      "Put the baking sheet in the freezer for several hours, or until the cakes are hard.",
      "Transfer the cakes to zip-top plastic bags and freeze for up to 6 months.",
      "To thaw, remove the plastic wrap from the still-frozen cakes, put the cakes in an airtight plastic container, and let stand at room temperature for 1 to 2 days before cutting and eating.",
      "Wooden moon cake molds are typically sold at Chinese and Vietnamese cookware stores, especially as the holiday nears.",
      "Or, check the Resources section (page 335) for an online vendor.",

      "If you are unsure, fill the mold with water to determine the size.",
      "For your first time making moon cakes, use the larger mold (about 2 3/4 inches in diameter and 1 1/4 inches deep), which is easier to work with.",
      "Molds from Vietnam are for making either baked moon cakes (this recipe) or for chewy unbaked cakes called banh deo (also eaten on this holiday).",
      "In general, molds for the former are carved with small, delicate scalloped edges, while molds for the latter have much bigger, robust edges.",
