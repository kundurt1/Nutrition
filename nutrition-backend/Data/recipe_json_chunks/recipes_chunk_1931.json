      "To Make the Goat:",
      "Trim and Season the Goat: Using a sharp, narrow knife (a boning knife or paring knife) and your hands, peel and trim away the leathery membrane, known as caul, and any thick patches of fat.",
      "Dont worry about trimming off every last bit of fat (goat is quite lean and will benefit from a little fat), but you do want to remove any tough caul membrane that pulls away in sheets to expose the meat below.",
      "Smear the harissa over the entire surface of the meat.",
      "If seasoning ahead, cover loosely with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 6 to 24 hours.",
      "Let sit at room temperature for about an hour before roasting.",
      "Heat the Oven: Position a rack in the lower third of the oven and heat to 425 degrees (400 degrees convection).",
      "Season the Vegetables: Combine the tomatoes, onions, and garlic in a bowl.",
      "Add the olive oil, season with salt and pepper, and toss to coat.",
      "Set aside.",
      "Roast: Place the goat in a roasting pan just large enough to hold it, and slide it into the oven.",
      "After 15 minutes, slide the oven rack holding the roasting pan out and tip the vegetables into the roasting pan, scattering them around the meat.",
      "Pour the vermouth (or wine or water) over the meat, and slide the rack back in.",
      "Close the oven, and reduce the temperature to 275 degrees (250 degrees convection).",
      "After 30 minutes at the lower temperature, baste the meat with the pan juices and stir the vegetables; do this again every 20 minutes or so, flipping the leg over after about 1 hour at the lower temperature.",
      "Continue roasting, basting, and stirring, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the leg registers about 150 degrees, about 1 hour more.",
      "Rest: Transfer the meat to a cutting board, preferably one with a trough, and let it rest for 20 to 30 minutes.",
      "Stir the vegetables, scraping the roasting pan to capture any roasted-on bits.",
      "Taste the vegetables for salt and pepper, and keep warm until serving.",
      "Carve: If youve ever carved a bone-in leg of lamb, you are on familiar ground here.",
      "Start by grabbing hold of the shank end (the narrow end) of the leg with your hand or a clean dish towel.",
      "Now, either carve thin lengthwise slices of meat from the roast, or, my preferred method, carve off large chunks of meat by sliding the knife as close to the bone as possible and then slice those chunks crosswise into thin slices.",
      "This method may look less dramatic and give you smaller slices, but it ensures that you carve the meat across the grain (which means more tender bites) and gives a better mix of doneness, as each slice contains some of the outside and inside of the roast.",
      "In most cases, whole goat legs have the pelvic bone intact (this is the convoluted bone that runs laterally at the wide end of the leg).",
      "Even the most expert carvers have trouble getting around this bone, so simply do the best you can.",
      "Serve: Transfer the sliced goat to a carving platter or individual plates.",
      "Surround with the tomatoes and onions and spoon any carving juices over the top.",
      "To Make the Harissa:",
      "Soak the Chiles: Put the chiles in a medium bowl and cover with boiling water.",
      "If the chiles float, weight them down with a small plate.",
      "Let them sit until softened, about 25 minutes.",
      "Toast the Spices: Combine the coriander, cumin, and caraway in a small, dry skillet and heat over medium, shaking the pan to prevent burning, until fragrant and beginning to color, about 2 minutes.",
      "Transfer to a mortar or spice grinder, let cool, and grind to a fine powder.",
      "Make the Paste: Outfit a food processor with a chopping blade, and, with the motor running, drop the garlic cloves into the feed tube.",
      "Process until finely minced.",
      "Drain the chiles, and tear them into medium-small pieces, removing and discarding the seeds and stems.",
      "Add the chiles to the food processor along with the ground spices and the salt.",
      "Process, stopping to scrape down the sides, to make a course puree.",
      "Add the olive oil, and process briefly to incorporate (avoid overworking the olive oil, as that can turn it bitter).",
      "Pack in a Jar: Transfer the paste to a clean glass jar-the paste may discolor plastic containers-packing it down with a small rubber spatula.",
      "Pour a thin layer of olive oil over the surface (this preserves the flavor and color).",
      "Put a lid on the jar, and refrigerate for up to 3 weeks.",
      "Top off with olive oil after each use."
