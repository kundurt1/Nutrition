      "In a large bowl, combine the noodles with the lobster, snow peas and the hijiki and its marinade. Toss well, using clean hands or tongs. Add the fish sauce dressing and the cilantro leaves, season with pepper and toss well. Turn the salad out onto a large platter, sprinkle the peanuts on top and serve.",
      "Wine Recommendation: A straightforward Riesling with a hint of sweetness will underscore the richness of the lobster and balance the Asian flavors of the seaweed and fish sauce. Consider the 1994 Sichel Piesporter Goldtropfchen Riesling Spatlese from Germany or the 1993 Columbia Winery Cellarmaster's Reserve Johannisberg Riesling from Washington State."

Marinate at least 1 hour (chill if longer than 1 hour) and up to 24 hours.",

      "While grill heats, whisk together remaining 3 tbsp. oil, 1 tbsp. lemon juice, and 1/2 tsp. each salt and dried oregano to make a vinaigrette. Set aside. Thread 5 or 6 pork cubes onto each skewer, adding an onion piece between them, and adding a bay leaf, if using, after every 2 pork cubes. \"I'll put some of the fattier pieces on the end for an extra-delicious first bite,\" says Cervone.

Warm up pita if they've gotten cold, advises Bililies. \"They're more flexible when they're warm.\"",
      "Assemble sandwiches: Snap bay leaves off skewers, if using. Arrange a sheet of parchment on a work surface so it looks like a diamond. Set a warm pita on top corner of diamond so it extends a little beyond parchment. Spread with 2 to 3 tbsp. yogurt sauce--\"You don't need to go super crazy with it,\" says Bililies--then push off a skewer's worth of pork down its center. Top pork with 1/2 cup cucumber-tomato salad, then 1/4 cup pickled onions. Finish with 2 tbsp. feta.",
