      "Finely chop the rosemary with the salt. This will keep those resinous little leaves from sticking so tenaciously to your knife blade, plus, this enables you to put a lot more of the flavorful oils of the fresh rosemary into the bread.",
      "(Before we get into a whole lot of detail about how to make this bread, please see the note below about kneading. You don't need to mix or knead this dough by hand, if you don't want to do so.) In the bottom of a large bowl, put the cereal flakes. Crush them very lightly; don't worry if you have some whole flakes.",
      "Pour 1/2 cup of boiling water over them and, using a sturdy, flat backed wooden spoon, stir a few times. Add the butter, the honey, the whole milk and the salt, and stir a bit more.",
      "Add one cup of flour and stir well. Add another half cup of flour and stir, then add the yeast mixture and beat the mixture until the ingredients are combined. Beat a few more times for good measure. Cover the bowl with a tea towel and let it sit for at least 25 minutes.",
      "Put the remaining half cup of measured flour onto your work surface, near the dough. Turn the dough over, put a bit of flour on each hand, and start to knead in earnest. If the dough sticks to the work surface (meaning that it holds tight and stretches to stay put), use a bench scraper to pull that dough up; then use the scraper to pull over no more than a tablespoon of flour at a time onto the surface where you are kneading, and continue.",
      "Resist the temptation to add more flour; add only a teaspoon or two at most at a time once the dough has come together and is starting to look and feel smoother and more elastic. Kneading time should take, all told, about 10-12 minutes.",
      "Let the dough sit while you prepare the bowl and rising area. (See note below for some suggestions about that.) Wash and dry the bowl you used to start the dough. Put about a teaspoon and a half of olive oil in the bottom of it. Put the dough in, turn it over, cover with a damp tea towel and let rise for an hour to an hour and a half.",
      "When the dough has risen, remove it from the bowl and gently shape it into a loaf, or boule, whichever you prefer. (Please see the notes below for more information on how I use a clay pot for baking loaves.)",
      "Let the shaped dough rise again. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit, or 325 for a convection, if that's what your oven manufacturer recommends. When the loaf has increased by about 70%, put it in the bottom third of your oven and bake for 50 minutes. If the crust appears to be getting too dark after about thirty minutes, lightly cover with foil. (Breads with milk and butter in them tend to darken more quickly than others, especially in ultra-efficient convection ovens.)",
      "The bread is ready when it makes a hollow sound when the bottom is tapped.",
      "Let it sit for at least an hour before slicing. The wait will be difficult, I know, but it'' will be worth it.",
      "Enjoy!! ;o)",
      "A Note about Rising: Your microwave is draft free. If you can fit your bread bowl in it, prepare it by warming it slightly and introducing some warm moisture, which will help the bread rise. To do this, put a few tablespoons of water in a small cup or jar into the microwave and turn it on high for two minutes. Instruct members of your household, in no uncertain terms, that if they need to use the microwave while the bread is rising, they are to gently remove the dough and then to replace it, gently, shutting the door, gently, when they are done using the microwave.",
      "Using a Clay Pot for Baking: Clay pots are nice to use for bread making because the clay absorbs water, when filled beforehand, which then is released into the oven, giving the bread a nice crust. You can''t put a cold clay pot into a hot oven, however, so after shaping the dough, put it on some parchment to rise. Fill up the clay pot about 3/4 with water and put it into the oven; then, turn it on to 325 degrees Fahrenheit to let it warm up with the oven. If your clay pot has a lid (and most roasting clay pots do), fill that will water, too, and put it in the oven. When the bread is ready to go into the oven, dump the hot water out of the bottom half of the clay pot, then put the dough and parchment into the bread pan and bake as directed. Leave the water-filled top of the clay pot in the oven while baking.",
      "A Note about Kneading: This dough does not necessarily have to be kneaded by hand, if you have another method that you prefer, and are able to make adjustments accordingly. I happen to like stirring and kneading, because I rely on my hands to tell me when the correct amount of flour has been added. Plus, there's nothing quite like the satisfaction of using your own hands to turn a shaggy, floury mass of not-quite combined ingredients into the most glorious, smooth, shiny and supple ball of dough. I do some of my best thinking while kneading, too."

      "Dice larger tomatoes, such as homegrown or beefsteak, and if you are using grape or cherry tomatoes, slice in half. Place the tomatoes in the mesh strainer and sprinkle with salt (about 1 teaspoon or so should do.) At this point, the salt is not just for seasoning but drawing the moisture out of the tomatoes. Let the tomatoes sit in the strainer for at least 10 minutes, slightly squeezing the tomatoes with your hand every once in a while, coaxing the water out of the tomatoes. Allowing the tomatoes to drain this way will leave you with a more concentrated tomato flavor for your pasta salad.",
      "Meanwhile, whisk together olive oil, red wine vinegar, garlic, and red pepper flakes in a small container (or shake all the ingredients together in a Mason jar.) Season with salt and freshly cracked black pepper to taste.",
      "After the tomatoes have been sitting in the strainer for at least 10 minutes, place tomatoes in a large mixing bowl and discard any juice that came from the tomatoes. Add the finely chopped parsley and dressing to the bowl. Mix to combine. Add the pasta to the mixing bowl and toss again until all of the pasta is covered with the dressing and tomatoes. Top with Parmesan cheese shavings and serve. Enjoy!"

Although we've never been sick ourselves, or anyone in our family (and I will continue to make this), I just want to put this out there...http://www.livestrong.com/article/485148-eating-raw-garlic-botulism/ It's probably the vinegar in the recipe, which is one of the things recommended to avoid botulism, as well as refrigerating the pickles when finished.

      "To bake the pizzas, turn the broiler in your oven on high. Place a 12-inch cast-iron skillet on your stovetop and heat it over medium-high heat for about 10 minutes, until it is HOT! In the meantime, on a floured surface, divide your dough into two pieces and use your fingers to press each into a thick circle (you're not stretching the dough quite yet). Let the pieces rest for a couple of minutes while you cut two rounds of parchment paper the size of your skillet. Then, put the parchment on a couple of cookie sheets or cutting boards.",
      "Gently stretch each of your dough pieces into a round that's about the size of the skillet, then place each on one of the parchment circles. Top the first round with half of the leek mixture and sprinkle on half of the Parmesan. Slide this-parchment and all-carefully into the hot skillet (DO NOT TOUCH the skillet without using really good hot pads), crack 2 to 3 eggs over the top, and sprinkle each egg with a pinch of salt.",
      "Transfer the skillet into the oven (remember, it's hot!), directly under the broiler, and cook for about 3 to 4 minutes, until the dough is puffed and deep brown and the egg whites are cooked but the yolks still seem not quite cooked through. Remove the skillet from the oven. Use mitted hands and a large spatula to transfer the pizza to a cutting board. Return the skillet to the stove top and repeat the process to make the second pizza."

Ideally, serve and eat it while it's quite firm but pliable and you are able to easily roll it into a ball. Once you've scooped it, return any remaining ice cream to the freezer. If the ice cream has melted too much at room temperature, refreezing it will result in an ice cream that is too icy.",

I like the chopped pieces or bite of peaches so I churned the ice cream first and then added the peaches. Go for whatever you like. There are no hard rules. I have totally adapted Jeni's ice cream recipe , so if there is any confusion then follow her basic recipe sub cream cheese to blue cheese of your choice and add peaches. And, there you have wonderful ice-cream. Garnish it with mint leaves, if you wish to.How I would like to serve it - I would cut very thin triangle slices of blue cheese and place it right next to the ice-cream scoop and top the ice cream with some sliced caramelized peach.

Remove from heat, and when temperature has reduced to 120\u00b0 F pass the mixture through a fine mesh strainer into a 4-cup glass measure or small pitcher. Whisk in orange blossom water if desired, starting with 1/8 teaspoon. The goal is to enhance the lovely perfume from the orange blossom honey, not make the panna cotta overtly flowery in flavor. Pour the panna cotta into individual ramekins. Allow to cool to room temperature, then cover with plastic wrap and chill until ready to serve.",

Cover and heat on medium until the mixture starts to boil, swirling the pan occasionally. Remove the cover and raise heat to medium-high. Swirl pan frequently. The honey will foam up while swirling, and the foam starts out a pale color. As the honey caramelizes the foam will become an amber color. Once the honey is a deep amber and the foam is a homogenous amber the honey is done. (It should register about 250\u00b0 F on a candy thermometer.) Remove from heat, then stir in the remaining 2 tablespoons of water. Transfer to a glass jar or small glass measure until ready to serve the panna cotta.",
      "Remove the panna cotta from the refrigerator 30 to 60 minutes before you're ready to serve. Its flavor is delicate and will benefit from being a bit warmer than the fridge.

      "To serve: Make a pool of 1/2 tablespoon to 2 teaspoons caramelized honey on a plate, allow to spread naturally or help it along using the convex surface of a spoon in circular movements. You want the pool to be wider than the panna cotta. Dip the ramekin in hot water, and run a thin blade around the edge of it (once around only, otherwise you'll get little flakes of panna cotta). Use the blade to gently separate the panna cotta from the side of the ramekin in several places. Turn the ramekin over the plate and shake (somewhate gently) like you're trying to get the last ketchup out of a bottle. The panna cotta should plop onto the plate. Top with 2 orange supremes. Garnish with sesame candies if desired, otherwise a tiny drizzle more of the caramelized honey. Serve.",
      "(PS. If you don't feel like going through the rigamarole of unmolding the panna cotta, feel free to serve it in the ramekin, topped with a teaspoon or so of caramelized honey and supremes instead.)",

      "Note on pan prep: In situations where I absolutely need to get cakes out of their pans in one piece, I find that having a well greased pan makes a huge difference. I've had great success using the following method:\r\n\r\nTrace the bottom of the pan on a sheet of parchment paper, and cut it out - you'll have a circle that will fit perfectly into the bottom of your pan. Grease the whole pan (bottom and sides) with cooking spray or butter, then lay the parchment paper on the bottom. Next, add a bit of flour to the pan, and turning the pan on its side and moving it around, allow the flour to coat the sides of the pan completely, tapping out any excess. Now your pan is ready to go, and you should have minimal trouble getting your cake out in one piece."

      "Return to a gentle boil and reduce heat to maintain that slow, gentle boil. Stir occasionally, picking up the frequency as the water cooks out and you get closer to gel-stage (you don't want the stuff on the bottom to get stuck and burn). Depending on the size of your pot, you may need to stir more frequently/vigorously to keep it from foaming over. Alternatively, you can lower the heat for less foam, but this will lengthen cooking time.",
      "When the foam starts to settle down and the liquid starts to darken, remove from heat and test the gel using one of your frozen spoons; spoon out a little bit, return the spoon to the freezer for a minute or two. Feel the bottom of the spoon - it should feel room temperature. If it's too hot, put it back in the freezer a moment longer. If the marmalade has the sort of set you like, you're done! Otherwise, put it back on for another 2-5 minutes and then test again.",
      "This should keep in the fridge for at least a week, but you can water-bath can it; I processed my half-pint jars for 10 minutes. I imagine it's shelf stable for at least a year, but I've not had the chance to find out, since we eat it too fast :-)"

Heat 2 tsp olive oil in a pan over medium heat for about 1 minute and then add your diced sweet potato, cooking until browned, which will take about 5 minutes. The sweet potato should be diced to about the size of a black bean. Once cooked, set aside to cool for about 1 minute while you mix together the rest of your salsa ingredients.",

Over medium heat, add 1 tsp olive oil and 2/3 C diced yellow onion to your pan (I prefer an uncoated saute pan or saucepan for sauces). Cook the onions until translucent, but not browned, for 3-4 minutes. Then add 1 Tbsp arrowroot flour and cook for another minute, stirring continuously.",
      "4. Turn the heat down to medium-low and add your milk to the pan, 1/2 C at a time, stirring continuously to prevent clumping. Cook the milk until it's hot and steaming, but don't allow it to simmer or boil, as this may cause curdling.",
      "5. Once your milk is heated and thick from the arrowroot flour, stir in your shredded cheese.",

Or your adult friends may enjoy all of the ingredients served separately as a nacho bar (I know I would like that). First, put about 15 blue tortillas on a plate and top with your sweet potato salsa.",

      "To roast the brussels sprouts (recommended): Heat the oven to 400 degrees F. Heat 2 tablespoons grapeseed oil (or just enough to evenly coat the bottom of the pan) in 2 oven-safe wide skillets (12 to 14 inches) over medium heat. When the oil slides easily from side to side of the pan, add the brussels sprouts cut side down. When the cut faces of the sprouts begin to brown, transfer the pan to the oven to finish cooking, about 15 minutes. Alternately, if you don't have 2 large skillets or are cooking more sprouts for a larger crowd, roast them in the oven: toss them with 1 tablespoon of oil per pound and spread them on a baking sheet, cut sides down. Roast in the oven, checking for browning every 10-15 minutes, tossing them around with a spatula only once they start to brown nicely.The sprouts are ready when they are tender but not soft, with nice, dark brown color.",
      "To fry the brussels sprouts: Heat 1 1/2 inches of oil in a deep saucepan over medium-high heat until a deep-fry or instant-read thermometer registers 375\u00b0F. Line a plate with paper towels. Fry in batches that don't crowd the pan -- be careful, these will pop and spatter. Brussels sprouts will take about 5 minutes: when the outer leaves begin to hint at going black around the edges-i.e., after the sprouts have sizzled, shrunk, popped, and browned but before they burn-remove them to a paper towel-lined plate or tray.",
      "Serve warm or at room temperature. When ready to serve, divide the brussels sprouts among four bowls (or serve it all out of one big bowl), top with the dressing to taste and cilantro leaves, and toss once or twice to coat.",

      "Wash and chop: 2 leeks, 1 carrot, 1 onion and 1 head of celery; it is totally unimportant how prettily they are chopped. Add everything to the pot. Fill the pot with enough water to cover the bones and the vegetables, and then toss in 2 sprigs of thyme, 1 bay leaf and the peppercorns.",
      "Bring the stock to a boil, and then lower to a simmer. Let it go for 3-4 hours, or until the veg are looking used up and the broth is tasty.",
      "Run the stock through a sieve; reserve the liquid, and throw away all the solids. At this point, you could refrigerate the stock for later use, or make the soup right away.",
      "Make the soup: Clean out and dry the pot. Over medium heat, crisp up the bacon. When it looks crispy, remove it to a paper towel-lined plate, and save it for later.",
      "Mince the remaining onion and 5 cloves of the garlic. Add the garlic to the pot, and mix it into the rendered bacon fat for 1 minute, or until fragrant. Add the onion next, and saute until translucent, about 3 minutes.",
      "Wash, dry and chop the remaining: leek, carrot and celery. Try to cut everything into uniform-ish pieces, so all the veg will cook at an even rate.",
      "Add the carrot and the celery to the pot, and saute for about 10 minutes. Add the leek, and saute another 5 minutes or so.",
      "Meanwhile, peel and slice the potato. After the leek has been added, toss the potato slices into the pot, along with the can of (rinsed) chickpeas. (Don't worry about how thinly the potato is sliced; it should break down a bit during cooking, and will thicken the soup.)",
      "Add the chicken stock to the pot, as well as the remaining thyme and bay leaf. Bring the soup to a boil, and then lower the heat to a simmer; let the soup cook gently for about 1 hour.",
      "When you think its done, throw away the thyme sprig and the bay leaf. Add the orzo, and let it cook for 5 minutes.",
      "Meanwhile, take the chicken meat from the refrigerator and shred it into bite-sized pieces. Stir the chicken into the soup, and let it warm up. Stir in the basil, until wilted.",
      "Just before you are read to eat, toast however much bread you like. Rub each slice down with the remaining garlic, and then butter generously.",
      "Cut each piece of toast into batons, for dipping into the soup. Top each bowl of soup with the crispy bacon and a crack of black pepper. Serve with toast and a hunk of pecorino cheese."

Add the butter and pulse several more times, until butter is coarsely incorporated into the mixture. In a small bowl, beat the egg with the ice water. Pour about a third of the egg mixture into the dough and pulse once or twice. Repeat two more times. Pulse only once or twice after each addition, and do not over-process the dough. (The dough shouldn't form a ball or ride on the blade, but just barely come together in a moist, malleable mass.) Place the dough on a work surface dusted with flour, gather into a ball, and then gently flatten into a disk. Wrap with plastic wrap and place into refrigerator for at least 3 hours or overnight.",

Drizzle the vegetables generously with olive oil, and season with salt, a generous amount of white pepper, and a pinch of black pepper. Place on a baking sheet and bake for about 40 minutes, until the vegetables are soft and begin to develop deep golden crust around the edges. Mix the vegetables often with a spatula, to prevent them from getting charred. Remove the vegetables from the oven and let them cool. (Roasted vegetables can be kept overnight in a closed container.)",
      "To make the tart: Heat oven to 375\u00b0F convection (400\u00b0F regular). Butter and flour the tart pan. On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough into a round. The rolled-out dough should be about 1/4-inch thick and at about 11 to 12 inches in diameter. Transfer the dough to the pan without stretching it, and press gently against the bottom and the sides. Trim the edges. Transfer the pan to refrigerator and chill the dough for about one hour.",
      "When ready to bake, using a fork, prick the dough all over. Cover the dough with parchment paper and fill with pie weights or dried beans. Bake for 20 minutes. Remove the paper and weights and bake for additional 5 minutes until it is lightly golden. Remove the pan from the oven and let the dough cool before adding the filling.",

      "In a small bowl, work the goat cheese with a fork until it is smooth and pasty. Slowly add milk, a tablespoon at time, and mix until fully incorporated. The mixture should have the consistency of heavy whipping cream. In a separate medium bowl, whisk the eggs. Add the cheese mixture, nutmeg, and a pinch of salt. Arrange the vegetables in the tart and then slowly pour the egg mixture over. (You may not be able to fit all of either the vegetables or the egg mixture, depending on how large your vegetables were.) Bake the tart until filling is set and pastry is golden brown, about 45 to 50 minutes. Let stand for at least 10 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature."

When the oil just starts to smoke add 4 of the chicken thighs skin side down, and cook until skin is brown and crispy about 4 to 5 minutes. Flip the chicken and cook an additional 4 to 5 minutes.

Add 1 teaspoon kosher salt and 2 tablespoons water to the pan, and scrape the bottom to pull up all the fond. Cook, stirring & scraping the bottom of the pan every couple minutes, until the onions are very soft and pale brown, about 15 to 20 minutes. They shouldn't be fully caramelized, but should all have a little color on them.",

Increase heat to high, and bring to a boil.",

Add the remaining chicken broth from the first can, as well as the prunes and apricots to the braising liquid. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to maintain a gentle simmer. Leave the pot uncovered, and stir occasionally to prevent sticking. Remove the cinnamon sticks and taste for salt before serving.",
      "Once the water, broth, and onion mixture comes to a full boil, pour it into the bowl with the couscous. Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap, and let it sit for 11 to 12 minutes, or until the couscous is tender. Fluff the couscous gently with a fork. Gently stir in the orange zest and juice mixture and the toasted almond slices, reserving a handful for garnish.",
      "To serve: Spread the couscous into a \"bed\" on a large serving platter or individual plates. Spoon the reduced braising liquid onto the couscous leaving some exposed couscous at the edges. Top with the chicken and scatter the remaining toasted almond slices on for garnish. (If you prefer you can plate the chicken before the braising liquid instead.)"

Just before you go to bed, sneak back the fridge and tenderly massage again. Cover and leave the chemistry do its own thing. A magic marriage of flavors will occur.",

    "title": "perfect soft boiled eggs for a party",
    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "First, leave your eggs out until they reach room temperature. This step is critical. While you're waiting, fill the largest stock pot or plastic tub you have with water. Fix your immersion circulator to the side of the pot, so that the water is above the minimum fill line on your circulator. Set the circulator to 148 F. Make sure you have enough ice for two rounds of ice bath cooling. Fill your largest rondeau or braiser with water, leaving about a couple inches of space at the top. Bring the water to a rapid boil.",
      "Set your timer to four minutes, but don't start it. Using a wide, flat-bottomed pasta basket or a spider, gently lower your eggs to the bottom of the pot and start your timer. Prepare an ice bath large enough to fit your pasta basket, or all your eggs if not using one. At exactly four minutes, remove your eggs and place them into the ice water as quickly as possible without damaging any shells. Let them cool completely, about 10 to 15 minutes.",
      "Once cool, set your timer to 46 minutes, but don't start it. Using your pasta basket or spider, lower the eggs into your sous vide setup and start the timer. When the time is almost up, prepare a second ice bath or refresh the first with new ice. When the timer goes off, remove the eggs from the circulator and place them into the ice bath as quickly as possible. Once more, let them cool completely.",
      "Once cold, the eggs are ready to peel. Line a cookie sheet with damp paper towels. Place a small pot or cake pan in your sink and run a stream of cold water into it. Tap each egg all over, gently, with a spoon. Make sure to crack the top and bottom of the egg. Under the stream of water, gently peel the pieces of shell away, taking particular care around the top and bottom of the egg. This is where the flesh is most likely to peel away with the shell. When finished with each egg, place it on the damp paper towels. Cover them with another damp paper towel while you finish the rest of the eggs. Once they are peeled, they can be held for hours until you're ready to serve them.",
      "Clean your frisee. Wash it well and spin it dry. Using kitchen shears/scissors, trim away any dark green near the top and outer edges of each bunch. Cut off the base of the bunch. If you see any large, white ribs, you can remove them to create a more refined look for your finished plate. Keep the frisee covered cool and covered with a damp towel until ready to use.",
      "Prepare a vinaigrette that will pair well with the bitterness of the frisee, the creaminess of the egg, and the smoky saltiness of the bacon.",
      "Cut your bacon width-wise into 1/2 inch (or smaller, if your bacon is on the thinner side) batons. Starting with a cold pan and using med-low heat, cook the bacon until it is crispy and browned, rendering all fat. Transfer the bacon to a paper towel lined plate to drain.",
      "Adjust your sous vide circulator to 134 F. At this temperature, the eggs will slowly heat through without further coagulating any of the proteins it contains. When you're ready to fire the dish, set a timer for 8 minutes. Gently lower the peeled eggs into the circulator. While they reheat, put your frisee into a mixing bowl. Season lightly with salt and pepper, then toss with your vinaigrette. Make a small mound of dressed frisee on a plate for each guest. Sprinkle the mound with your cooked bacon pieces. When the timer goes off, remove the eggs from the circulator and let them drain, briefly, on a paper towel lined plate. Using your hands, carefully nestle one egg into each mound of frisee. Top each egg with a small pinch of flaky sea salt and serve. The effort is worth it to watch each guest cut into a perfectly smooth, soft egg and smile with delight as creamy, decadent yolk flows over and into their salad."

This will take some effort-keep on mashing and rubbing into the strainer. Scrape the strained mixture from the underside of the strainer into the bowl. Continue to press the mixture, even with your fingers, until there's only 2-3 tablespoons of dry cranberry skins and raspberry seeds left behind to discard. You should have about 2/3 cup strained cranberry spread. Set aside.",

      "Use a serrated knife to split the cake in half horizontally. Spread about 1/2 cup of the cranberry spread evenly over the bottom layer-you should have a little left over. Spread all of the whipped cream over the cranberry spread. Top with the second cake layer and press gently to level. Use a metal spatula to smooth any cream that has oozed from the layers around the sides of the cake. Then spread the remaining cranberry spread around the sides of the cake in the thinnest possible layer-just enough make the cake sides sticky enough to adhere the pistachios (but if you run short, use a little extra jam). Press chopped pistachios around the sides of the cake. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours and up to 1 day. Sieve a little powdered sugar over the top before serving."

    "title": "roasted stuffed chicken with herb butter, potatoes and onions",
    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "The first (and easiest) step to making a great roast chicken is the brining process. A brine is simply salted (and sugared) water that the chicken will soak in for between 1-5 hours prior to cooking. As soon as you are ready to begin cooking and you've bought your bird, get it brining. In a pot large enough to hold the chicken, fill halfway with water and add 1/2 cup salt and 1/4 cup sugar per gallon of water. Stir to dissolve the salt and sugar, and put your bird into the brine. Simple. Brining keeps the bird moist during cooking (along with the butter rub and the basting we will be doing, we're maximizing tenderness). For a crispier skin remove the bird from the brine about 1 hour before cooking and allow it to dry in the refrigerator, uncovered. This will also aid in getting your herb butter onto the bird.",
      "In a roasting pan with a rack, arrange the potatoes, onions and garlic in the bottom of the pan. Drizzle with olive oil, and give a liberal seasoning with salt and pepper. The potatoes and onions will cook in the chicken drippings and will be absolutely wonderful. Trust me on this one.",
      "Make the stuffing: Pulse the French bread in a food processor to make crumbs. I like to leave my stuffing with some nice bread chunks in it, but that choice is up to you. Saute the mushrooms in butter until soft (about 5 minutes). Add the mushrooms (and any butter left in the pan), celery, parsley, salt and pepper to the breadcrumbs. Mix to combine. If they seem dry (i.e., if your mushrooms sucked up all of your butter) feel free to add a bit of olive oil to get the stuffing to a good consistency. You don't want them to be mushy, but they should hold together well enough to form a good ball without crumbling apart.",
      "Remove any giblets that may be in the cavity of the chicken. Stuff the bird.",
      "Prepare the herb butter: combine the rosemary, sage, and thyme with the softened butter, and mix together. Now, here is where you will really get your hands dirty. The herbed butter needs to go underneath the skin of the bird. There is really no way to do this without coating your hands in butter and chicken juices, so just get right in there. Work your fingers underneath the skin, push that butter mixter as far down as you can, and get a nice layer of herbed butter spread out across the whole bird. Rub any extra over the outside of the skin. This will all melt during the cooking, basting the bird from the inside, and will leave the skin crispy and seasoned.",
      "Heat your oven to 350, and cook the bird for about 40 minutes a pound. Baste every 30 minutes after the first hour. My supermarket had some great little artichokes for sale, so I picked up one per person and threw them into the bottom of the pan with about an hour to go. You can really roast any vegetable you want with the chicken.",
      "Turn the heat up to 450 for the last 10 minutes to crisp the skin. A meat thermometer should read 165 when inserted into the thigh.",
      "Slice, serve with the stuffing and potatoes. Spoon extra herbed butter over the chicken. Enjoy!"

      "You'll also need...\r\n\r\nA large wooden board\r\nA slotted spoon\r\nVery clean hands!",
      "Bake the potatoes at 425\u00b0 for about 45 minutes, or until you start to smell them charring slightly. The key word being slightly. You want to bake the moisture out of them. This is key to good gnocchi because if there's moisture in the potatoes, it will make it difficult for the dough to congeal the right way. Some people say you should boil the potatoes. I don't agree with that and the years have taught me that baking them is better.",
      "Let the potatoes cool and then peel the skin. You don't need to get the second, interior layer off entirely-just the exterior skin. There will still be some charred spots on the potatoes and that's OK.",
      "Pess the potatoes against the large holes on a cheese grater. Some recipes ask you to use a ricer. I've never used the ricer. Use a fork to mash the potatoes against the side of the bowl. Don't try to make the potatoes perfectly smooth. A little lumpiness will make the gnocchi lighter.",
      "Make a well in the middle of the potatoes and add 1/2 cup of Parmesan cheese. Add the dash of nutmeg.",
      "Add 3 egg yolks. (Keep some of the egg whites you might want to add it in later depending on the consistency of your dough as making gnocchi, as you'll learn, is not always an exact science.)",
      "At this point, if you haven't already, wash your hands really well. I've never known an Italian to use a Kitchen Aid with gnocchi. This is \"hands on\" pasta! Your hands are the best tool with gnocchi. Start kneading the mixture between your fingers. It will be sticky. When it looks a little like egg salad you're good. It's OK if its a little lumpy.",
      "First, add just 1/2 cup of the flour and mix it in with your hands. The dough will still be sticky and will stick to your hands.",
      "Gradually begin to add the remaining half cup of flour, kneading and mixing the dough between your fingers. Th stickiness will start going away and you'll feel suppleness to the dough. It's perfect when its slightly springy.",
      "Sprinkle flour and spread it across the wooden board. At this point you should have a ball of dough, which you'll place on the board and dust with the flour. On the board, continue to roll the dough, dusting it with the flour, creating one large ball. Cut the ball into four equal pieces. Roll each piece into a long string about 1 inch in diameter.",
      "Cut the string into 1/4 to 1/2 inch pieces. You'll be creating what many people call \"little pillows.\" Now, here you can make a decision. A lot of people like to push each piece against a fork to create a texture that they feel will hold the sauce better. I prefer not to do this, and most of the Italians I know from Italy don't do it either. But the choice is yours.",
      "Place the gnocchi pillows on a cookie sheet covered with parchment paper. Now, here's my tip, but you only need to do this if you live where there is humidity. Place the gnocchi in the freezer for no more than 15 minutes just to let them set.",
      "Boil a pot of water with olive oil and a little bit of salt. The olive oil is important with gnocchi so don't skip it. (yes, I realize this is contrary to what many chefs on T.V. tell you, but an Italian chef taught me this!)",
      "You'll need a slotted spoon. Place the gnocchi into the boiling water in batches, just a handful at a time. They'll start to boil to the top of the water. Before you remove them, wait about 3 minutes and just let them boil. Don't use a strainer with gnocchi. Instead, remove them using the slotted spoon."

Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let it sit at room temperature for 15 to 30 minutes.",

I suspect that later versions are similar.) The method of stirring some cold liquid into the cornstarch mixture, and the admonition to stir very gently, I learned from a book I stumbled on at the library some time ago, called \"Milk: The Surprising Story of Milk Through the Ages.\" According to its author, Anne Mendelson, vigorous stirring while cooking a pudding can break the starch links that form to thicken it.",
      "About the vanilla: Vanilla bean tends to be too strong in this pudding, as it can overwhelm the bay, which by nature is more delicate. For that reason, I suggest using a good vanilla extract. If you have a vanilla bean that's been used once, and from which someone has scraped the seeds, so that just the pod remains, about 4 inches of that can be used in this pudding, instead of the extract. Add it when you pour the milk mixture into the double boiler and remove it when you remove the bay leaves."

Add the pink peppercorns, slightly bruised with the flat side of a knife, and the preserved lemon choppen fine. If you do not have preserved lemon, you could always make \"quick preserved lemon\" by slicing and cutting in small cubes 3 well washed organic lemons with the skin on, to which you add 1 tbsp of sugar and 1 tbsp of salt --let rest for at least 30 mns (or keep a jar of these in the fridge at all times), and voila!",

The mixture will thicken & streaks from your whisk will appear, this usually takes about 3-5 minutes\r\nRemove from the heat & transfer the mixture from the saucepan to a clean bowl - let cool to room temperature",
      "FOR THE DOUGH:\r\nWhisk together the flour, sugar, matcha, instant yeast, salt & milk powder in the bowl of your stand mixer.

      "MAKING THE TURTLES:\r\nAfter dough is done rising, weigh your dough & divide it into 8 equally sized pieces (mine weighed about 72g each)\r\nReserve 2 of the pieces for the heads & feet of the turtles\r\nFlatten each piece of dough into about a 4-5\" circle & add 15g of chopped white chocolate to the flattened dough, pressing the chocolate into the dough. Fold the dough up & around the white chocolate, pressing the dough together to ensure it is well sealed.\r\nFlip over the dough so the sealed side is facing down - repeat with the other 5 pieces of dough & the turtle bodies are done",

Slip the pinched ends under the turtle body placing them where the turtle's feet need to be.\r\nOnce all turtles have heads & feet, make the eyes by taking 2 black sesame seeds & place them onto each head, gently pressing them into the dough with a toothpick.\r\nCover the completed turtle rolls with plastic wrap & put in a warm place to rise for about 30 minutes",
      "While the turtles are rising make the dutch crunch.\r\nIn a small bowl whisk together the dutch crunch ingredients until smooth. Cover with plastic & leave to rise while the turtles are rising\r\nWhen turtles are done rising, pre-heat oven to 350F - Stir the dutch crunch topping until smooth & then coat the top of each turtle body with the dutch crunch topping, spreading it evenly with a spoon until all of the topping is used up.\r\nSprinkle the dutch crunch coating with sugar & then bake the rolls for 20 minutes",
      "Remove from oven & place turtles on a rack to cool for about 10-15 minutes.\r\nEnjoy turtles while still warm from the oven - this is when they are at their best - otherwise, store in an airtight container & re-heat in the microwave for about 20 seconds"

      "Take your chilled butter and dice it into 1/2\" cubes. Set them on a small plate or tray and stash, with the water, in the freezer while you prep the rest of your ingredients; for at least 15 minutes.",
      "Combine the flour, salt and sugar in a large bowl (I'm messy, so I like a lot of space to work with) and toss with your hands to incorporate. Scatter in the chilled butter. Now, everyone has their personal method of blending butter and flour for pie crust, but I prefer to take large handfuls of the mixture, press them between my hands (as if praying to the pastry gods for a stunning result), and swiftly rub them together, incorporating the butter into the flour as evenly and quickly as possible. In the end, you should have pieces of butter that range in size from a nickel to small peas. Pour in 2 oz. of the cold water and toss with your fingertips to blend. Pick up a handful and give it a feel. If you feel quite a bit of loose flour, and the dough doesn't hold together when you squeeze it, sprinkle in the remaining 1/2 oz. of cold water. Knead the dough quickly, just until it comes together in a bit of a shaggy mess (I like to err a bit on the dry side).",
      "Dump the mass onto a lightly floured work surface and form it into a tight mound. Using a bench scraper or a sharp knife, cut the dough in half and stack one on top of the other. Using the palms of your hands, quickly smash the stack down into another tight mound. Repeat this step 3 or 4 times before forming a tight disk with the dough and wrapping it well in plastic wrap. Refrigerate the disk for at least 30 minutes (or in the freezer for 10) in the refrigerator before working with it.",
      "When you're ready to use the dough, remove the disk from the refrigerator and allow the chill to come off slightly. Scatter a few pinches of flour across a clean work surface, and dust a rolling pin generously. Place the disk on the work surface and dose the top with a pinch of flour. Working from the middle of the disk out, begin rolling away from you, turning the dough a quarter turn after each outward roll, trying your darndest to keep an even \"circle\" (it will never be perfect). When the disk becomes too large to turn easily, begin rolling from the center, outward, keeping the round stationary. If you feel the dough is beginning to stick to the counter, shimmy it a bit to loosen it, flip it over your rolling pin and give the work surface a few more pinches of flour. Don't worry if small cracks begin to form around the edges, although, if large fissures begin to form, simply pinch them back together and proceed. Work as quickly as possible, to prevent the dough from becoming too soft on you. If that happens, take a cue from Alton Brown and set a chilled sheet pan on top of the dough for 5 minutes before attempting another go.",
      "After you have a circle 11 - 12\" in diameter, fetch a large sheet pan or saute pan (I prefer my trusted, 9\" cast iron skillet) and transfer the dough to the center of the pan using either deft hands or by draping it over the rolling pin to assist the move. Allow the dough to settle into the pan, but don't press it in. Stash the pan in the fridge while you work on the filling.",
      "To prepare the filling (this step can be done at least a day in advance), set the cobs of corn, upright in a large bowl and, using a sharp serrated knife, cut the kernels from the cob (being careful not to shave off any of the white pith). Melt the butter with a tablespoon of olive oil in a medium-sized skillet set over medium heat and add the leeks with a generous pinch of salt and a healthy dose of cracked pepper. Lower the heat to medium-low and cook for 3 - 4 minutes, stirring frequently, until the leeks have just softened and sweetened a bit. Add in the corn kernels and 2 tablespoons of dill, and cook for just another minute. Scrape the mixture (and all of its buttery goodness) into a bowl and set aside to cool slightly.",
      "Preheat the oven to 400? and arrange a rack to the lowest position. Beat together the egg and cream in a bowl with a fork until well mixed.",
      "Fetch the pie dough from the fridge and, using a pastry brush, paint the entire surface of the dough with the egg wash. Dot or spread the goat cheese in the very center (in an area approximately 6\" in diameter, but don't fret about being exact). Pile the leek-corn mixture in the very center of the dough, mounding it up high. Shingle the slices of tomato on top of the veggies in a single layer, overlapping slightly. Fold the edges tightly over the filling, crimping them tightly to keep them in place. Completely egg wash the now exposed pie dough. Drizzle the tomatoes with a tablespoon or so of olive oil and dose generously with flaked sea salt (I swear by Maldon) and a few grinds of cracked pepper.",
      "Bake on the bottom rack for 35 - 45 minutes, or until the crust is a rich, golden-brown and the tomatoes are slightly shriveled. If you're feeling particularly dangerous, I like to take a long, offset spatula and lift the galette to make sure the bottom is nice and golden brown as well. Remove from the oven and allow the galette to cool in the pan for an hour before sliding it out onto a cutting board to finish cooling completely. When ready to serve, scatter the remaining tablespoon of fresh dill on the galette, slice it into wedges and serve it with a simple salad of bitter greens."

      "Many of us are big fans of roasted vegetables. Giving them a light glaze of oil and seasoning and submitting them to high heat, their sugars caramelize and their flavor is intensified. But there are many instances when a recipe calls for blanching or boiling a vegetable. In those cases, I have become a major fan of steaming vegetables over blanching or boiling them. Steaming is a much faster method, uses less water and fuel, requires no dangerous boiling water, and is far more nutritional, as the steamed food retains its nutrients rather than discharging them into a pot of water. Only a little water is needed to create steam and it takes a short time to heat that little amount of water to steaming, so you save time and gas or electricity every time you steam!",
      "I love my inexpensive 2- tiered Chinese aluminum dome-topped steamer which I bought in a Chinatown restaurant supply store. The tiers are flat (think ' 3\" deep cake pan with holes all over the bottom') and they are so space efficient, both for setting over another pot to cool, and for stacked storage.They have an interior diameter of 10\" and hold alot of food in a single layer. They also have a thick sturdy rim around each tier, making it easy to grasp and remove them from the steamer part below them.",

Or you can use the standby fold-up 'steamer basket', opened up as wide and flat as possible, to hold more food.( The steamer basket is what I use when I'm just steaming broccoli for the two of us.)."

      "Toast the crushed peanuts in a skillet over medium-low heat until slightly golden on the surface. Transfer to a bowl and freeze until completely cold (this will prevent the peanuts turning into butter when processed). Pulse the cold peanuts and the sugar in a spice-grinder or food-processor, in small batches, until finely ground. Can be done the day before.",
      "NOTE: The key to remember is this, that the butter and the dough should have an equal softness/density for the layering to execute perfectly, that they should both behave/spread similarly when pressure is applied (the rolling). So room-temperature dough + semi-soften butter can create layers almost as efficiently as cold dough + cold butter (which is what's been generally practiced only that it takes a gazillion-times longer). Another thing is, don't go crazy trying to create 100 layers within a relatively thin dough! Over a certain threshold, you'll just be forcing the butter to merge with the dough and you'll have yourself some nice brioche! I think a good, down-to-earth 30 layers is well enough to fill my heart with content.",
      "NOTE 2: Reducing the times of folding by starting with a much larger sheet of dough, also reduces the times of rolling as well which I believe as a result, prevents the layers from being lost. Yes, it will require a counter surface that's more than 3-feet long (the width of a door... a door, guys!). And if that sounds over-reaching to you (nothing wrong with living in a shoe-box)... I assume you have a dining surface to accommodate...",
      "NOTE 3: I happened to have crushed peanuts around, but if you are using whole, skinless peanuts and measuring by volume, you may need more than 3/4 cup because of the empty space it occupies. And please use a high-gluten bread flour as it gives body and chewiness to the buns. Unless soft and flappy buns are your thing then by all means, all-purpose flour...",
      "TO MAKE THE DOUGH: Microwave 1 1/8 cups of water on high for about 30 seconds (the water should be warm but not hot. you should be able to leave your finger in it without discomfort). Then evenly mix the warm water with 2 cups of bread flour and 1/4 tsp of instant dry yeast with a fork, and set aside for 20 min.",
      "Meanwhile, prepare the butter: In a stand-mixer with pedal-attachment, mix the cold unsalted butter (right out of the fridge) with all-purpose flour on low speed first, then increase to medium speed and beat until thick but \"creamy\" without lumps (like the consistency of cold cream cheese). Transfer all the butter onto a parchment paper and set aside at room-temperature. Scrape the butter off the bowl as cleanly as you can with a spatula, but there's no need to wash the bowl.",
      "Switch to a dough-hook, then add the flour/yeast/water-mixture, plus 2 1/2 cups of bread flour, light brown sugar, salt, 1/2 tbsp of instant dry yeast and warm milk (microwave cold milk on high for 30 seconds). Knead the dough on low first until evenly incorporated (scrape the bottom of the bowl if need be), then increase to medium-high speed to knead for another 5 min. The dough should be wet and sticky, but pulls away cleanly from the side while the machine is running. Dust your working surface generously with flour, then transfer the dough on top. (CHECK THE ATTACHED GRAPH FOR REFERENCE)",
      "No chilling, resting or what-so-ever (the original recipe says to chill the dough for 4 hours which I didn't). Dust the top of the dough with more flour, then press it down with your hands to shape it into a rectangle about 13? long x 10? wide (33 cm long x 25 cm wide). Keep the width at 10?, then roll it out length-wise to 33? long (84 cm). It's easier to start rolling from the middle of the rectangle and out towards both sides, and keep the bottom of the dough well dusted with flour to prevent sticking. You should have a gigantic sheet of dough about 33? long x 10? wide.",
      "Scatter the butter in dollops evenly over the dough-sheet, then gently rub/smear the butter into an even layer cross the sheet, all the way to the edges (like applying lotions on a baby's buttock). Wash your hands, then use a dough-scraper to lift one side of the sheet up, and fold it 5 times over until you get to the end of the dough, which should give you 5 layers. Now you should have a scroll about 6? long x 10 \" wide. Now, gently pinch the two openings of the scrolls together, then turn it 90 degrees. You'll have a rectangle that's 10? long x 6? wide. Here's a trick: the trapped air inside the scroll will make it hard to roll out evenly, so poke a few holes with a wooden skewer so the air can escape when the dough's being rolled out. Roll the dough out again length-wise to 33? long (84 cm), and fold 5 times again from one side to another. So now you have a 6? square (doesn't have to be exact). Place the square-dough on a well-dusted sheet pan, cover with plastic wrap and rest in the fridge for at least 2 hours to overnight (I admit I only waited 1:30 hour but it worked out fine).\r\n\r\nThere! You're done with all the foldings and if you were counting, all 30 layers!",
      "TO BAKE THE BUN: Preheat the oven on 400\u00b0F/200\u00b0C.\r\n\r\nTransfer the dough on a floured surface, and roll it out into a 18? long x 10? wide (46x 25 cm) rectangle. Sprinkle 1 cup of peanut sugar in an even layer over the top, then roll the sheet length-wise into a long log (still 18? long). Use a serrated knife to cut the dough into 3? (7.5 cm) wide segments, so you'll have 6 segments. Butter 6 large ramekins, or XL muffin-cups, then coat with peanut sugar. Place each segments inside the mold, cover loosely with plastic wrap and let proof for 30 ~ 45 min. The dough should expand slightly and look puffy.",
      "Bake in the oven for 30 min until golden browned and puffed (if the top is browning too fast, lower the temperature slightly for the last 10 min). Remove the buns from the molds and let cool completely, then drench the in the peanut sugar and serve."

If the mixture is too moist, add about 1/2 cup of dry breadcrumbs. You want the balls to be quite moist, but able to hold their integrity in the pan.",
      "Roll meat mix into 1 or 1.5 inch balls with hands. In a large non-stick pan, in batches if necessary, fry the meatballs in the olive oil. You just need a bit of oil in the pan to begin with, as the meatballs will generally render a bit of fat. If there is too much oil as you fry a second or third batch, pour off the excess. Don't worry if your meatballs aren't really round - they should develop a nice brown crust on 3 or four sides. \r\nYou want to fry the meatballs until they are still pink in the center, as they will finish cooking in the tomato sauce. If you intend to use them just for sandwiches, cook them at a slightly lower heat for longer, until done through. Taste-test one from the first batch, and dust on a bit more salt if needed.",
      "While the meatballs are cooking - or before you begin the meatballs if you like a slow-cooked sauce - make the tomato sauce. Puree the fresh tomatoes in a food processor with the sage, garlic, and salt. In a sauce pan, fry the onions and garlic gently in the olive oil until tender. Pour fresh tomato puree into the pan and bring to a low simmer. Add the canned tomatoes. The combination of fresh and canned tomatoes makes an excellent quick pasta sauce that tastes great but will not overpower the meatballs. Add other spices and pepper if desired.",
      "When the sauce is hot and has simmered for about 10-15 minutes, and the meatballs have all been fried and have developed a nice brown crust on the sides, add the meatballs to the sauce and simmer gently until the meatballs are cooked through. Serve over pasta, halved in sandwiches with mozzarella slices, or bring to a potluck in a Crock Pot. If serving over pasta, it's great to garnish with a few ribbons of fresh sage."

Let it boil away for a few minutes. Once it starts to darken in patches, swirl the pan to make sure it's caramelizing evenly. The burning sugar will smell smoky and sweet.

And start stirring. Don't walk away. Or you will have caramel-flavored scrambled eggs. Watch and feel for the shift in viscosity. As you stir, the thin custard will slap against the sides of the pot like waves against the side of a boat. As it thickens, the gliding spoon will cause the custard to rise up and settle back down without much of a splash. This takes anywhere from 3 to 5 minutes. But don't time it. Just watch. To confirm that it's done, do the drag-your-finger-across-the-back-of-the-wooden-spoon test. It's ready when your finger leaves a lovely lingering trail.",

Repeat with half of the remaining flour. Repeat with the rest of the flour. Pour all of the hot milk mixture over the batter and fold gently but authoritatively, scraping batter up from the bottom of the bowl and rotating the bowl until the milk and butter are incorporated.

Hold the ends of the paper and the pan together and invert the whole business onto the counter (or on another baking sheet-but not on a rack)-so the top of the cake rests directly on the parchment. Leave the pan on top so that the cake steams a little as it cools. The top of the cake will stick to the parchment-this is correct. Let the cake cool completely while you make the cranberry raspberry spread.",
      "Make cranberry-raspberry spread: Put the cranberries in a small saucepan with 1/4 cup sugar. Cover and cook until about 2/3 of the berries are burst (4-5 minutes). Scrape the mixture into a medium coarse strainer with the raspberry or cherry preserves. Mash and press as much of the mixture through the strainer as possible, using a rubber spatula. This will take some effort-keep on mashing and rubbing into the strainer. Scrape the strained mixture from the underside of the strainer into the bowl. Continue to press the mixture, even with your fingers, until there's only 2-3 tablespoons of dry cranberry skins and raspberry seeds left behind to discard. You should have about 2/3 cup strained cranberry spread. Set aside.",
      "To assemble and freeze the cranberry-raspberry jelly roll (for lining for the bombe mold): Tear off a sheet of foil the size of the sponge sheet and set it on the counter next to the sponge. Lift the pan off of the sponge sheet and peel off the parchment liner. Using the parchment under the cake, flip the cake over onto the foil. Peel the parchment from the cake, taking all or most of the skin off of the cake as well. If any of the skin remains, remove it with a knife.",
      "Spread all of the cranberry-raspberry in a very thin even layer over the sponge sheet. Starting with one long edge, use the foil underneath the cake to help roll the cake as tightly as possible to form a 16 or 17-inch jelly roll. To tighten a jelly roll, imagine it as rolling a sleeping bag as tightly as possible so that you can squeeze it back into its impossibly small bag. Start with the sponge sheet on a piece of foil on the counter with one long side facing you. Start at the edge of the cake thats nearest you-and using the foil under the cakes as necessary, fold the least amount of cake possible over itself to start the roll, and keep the roll as round and tight as possible as you roll the cake away from you. When the roll is complete, squeeze and tighten it as follows: Roll the entire jelly roll back towards the center the foil. Pull the far end of the foil towards you and over the jelly roll to cover it. Hold a ruler or straight edge on top of the foil against the bottom of the jelly roll. Use your other hand to anchor the foil under the cake against the counter so it won't slide while you press the edge of the ruler away from you, against the top foil (which should be free so it will slide forward) as you tighten the jellyroll inside the foil.",
      "Wrap the jelly roll tightly in the foil. Freeze for several hours or overnight for easiest handling. You can do this days or weeks in advance!",
      "To line the bombe with jelly-roll slices: Have a 6-cup half dome shaped bowl or bombe mold at hand (mine is 7 1/4 inches in diameter and 3 1/2 inches deep). There is no need to line it or grease it.",
      "Remove the frozen jelly roll from the freezer and unwrap it. Without thawing, trim ragged ends if necessary (and reserve the trimmings). Use a sharp serrated knife to cut slices 1/4 inch thick. Line the mold with slices as follows: place 1 slice in the center of the bottom of the mold. Next fit 7 (or more, as needed) slices around the center slice, pushing and fitting them together (assertively!) so that no space whatever is left between them (take this seriously or you will end up with mousse showing between the jelly-roll slices. Fit the next 9 or more slices around the mold, starting up the sides. Finish by fitting the next 10 or so slices to completely line the mold, always pushing and fitting to eliminate any space between slices. Push the last slices even with the rim of the mold if possible, or trim them so that they are flush. Reserve, wrap and freeze all trimmings and extra slices. Set the lined mold aside while you make the mousse.",
      "To make the mousse and fill the mold: Put the white chocolate, water and kirsch in a medium stainless steel bowl. Bring 1 inch of water to a simmer in a wide skillet. Turn the heat off under the skillet (or remove it from an electric burner) and wait 30 seconds, then set the bowl of chocolate directly into the hot water. Stir constantly until the chocolate is melted and smooth. Remove the bowl from the water and let the chocolate mixture cool until it is 85F-slightly cool when you dab a little on your lip. If the chocolate is too cool or cold, the mousse will be grainy, if it is hot, it will melt the whipped cream you are going to fold into it.",
      "Just before the chocolate is cool enough, whip the cream only until it is thickened and barely being to hold a share-when you tilt the bowl the cream should flow to one side, fluffy but still pourable and not at all stiff. Scrape the cream into the bowl of chocolate (not vice versa!) and fold carefully but quickly just until the two are incorporated. The mousse should seem far too soft to set-but it will firm up as it cools. Immediately (before the mousse even thinks about starting to set) scrape it all into the lined bomb mold and spread it evenly.",
      "Remove the remaining jelly-roll slices and trimming from the freezer. Set aside just enough slices to completely cover the top of the mouse if placed tightly together- do this by laying slices on a piece of parchment and then pushing the edges together to form a round layer the same diameter at the bomb mold or bowl-but don't put them into the mold yet.",
      "Dice any remaining slices and trimming with a sharp knife. Scatter the dice evenly over the mousse. Now (finally), fit the slices assembled into a layer over the dice cake pieces to form the bottom layer of the dessert. Place a cardboard round or flat plate smaller than the diameter of the mold inside the mold and press firmly to level and compact the bombe. Wrap and refrigerate the bombe for at least 6 hours before unfolding and serving. The bombe may be completely to this point up to 36 hours in advance.",
      "To unfold and finish the bombe: Invert the mold and rap the edges sharply on the counter to release the dessert onto a cake circle or cookie sheet. Simmer trained apricot preserves in a small saucepan for 2-3 minutes to make a glaze. Use a pastry brush to paint the entire dessert with a very thin coat of glaze. Touch the bottom edges of the bombe with minced pistachios. Transfer to a serving platter. Refrigerate until serving."

      "Add the eggs and sour cream or yogurt. Mix gently to combine, then add the sugar. Turn the mixer up to medium-low and mix until the dough forms a ball, about 4 minutes.",
      "Turn the mixer back down to low and mix the butter into the dough in 2-tablespoon-sized chunks, beating until each piece is almost completely incorporated before adding the next piece. Make sure to take this step nice and slow to ensure that the dough is evenly mixed and kneaded. Stop periodically to pull the dough from the hook and scrape the sides of the bowl to ensure even mixing. The dough will be very soft and billowy.",
      "Once all of the butter has been incorporated, continue to knead the dough until it pulls away from the sides of the bowl, about 10 minutes.",
      "Transfer the dough to a clean bowl and let it rise at room temperature until it has doubled in size, 40 to 60 minutes. Knead the dough in the bowl a few times to release the air, then cover and transfer the bowl to the refrigerator. Check on the dough every half hour or so and gently knead it in the bowl a few times until it is chilled and stops rising, about 2 hours. Let the dough rest at least overnight and up to 24 hours in the refrigerator.",
      "When you are ready to bake, remove the dough from the fridge and, to make loaves, divide the dough into 2 pieces. Divide each piece into 4 pieces and roll each piece into a ball. Arrange the dough balls in two greased loaf pans. To make individual brioches, divide the dough into 16 equal pieces and gently roll each piece into a tight ball. For round brioches, place the dough balls into well-greased individual pans. For traditional brioche a tete (those little guys with the \"heads\"), you'll have to do a little more shaping. Flour the pinky side of your hand and place it about 1 inch from the top of the dough. Use the side of your hand and gently roll back and forth while cutting into the dough to make a little ball. The motion should be something like a very delicate, rolling karate chop. You should have a large ball on one side connected to a small ball on the other. Gently move the dough into the prepared tin, with the large part on the bottom. Use your finger to poke a hole in the middle of the large portion of dough and tuck the smaller ball into it. Repeat with the rest of the dough.",
      "For loaves or individual brioches, let the dough rise until it reaches the top of the pans. Preheat oven to 400\u00b0 F and brush the dough with a beaten egg. Sprinkle with the optional pearl sugar if desired. Bake loaves for 25 to 35 minutes, or until deep golden brown. Bake individual brioches for 15 to 20 minutes, or until deep golden brown. Let the brioche cool in the pan (or pans) for 5 minutes, then remove to a rack to cool completely."

I like to squeeze the dough between my fingers like play-dough and reform it multiple times to make sure the salt is evenly incorporated.",
      "Cover and let the dough raise for 2-3 hours at warm room temperature (75-ish degrees). Every 30 minutes or so give it about a dozen turns. To turn, wet your hand and reach along the side of the bowl, grip the bottom of the mass and pull the handful of dough up pressing it down onto the top. It's basically taking the bottom part, stretching it, and folding it over the top.",
      "Thus completes the bulk rise. Now portion the dough into 8 balls. I form the dough balls as I would normal Tartine bread. Put them on a floured surface, stretch out the corners, one at a time, and folding the ear you just stretched onto the center mass. Do this on the right side, left, bottom, and then top. When you do the top, roll the ball over itself and start shaping it with your hands. That all may be overkill because pizza dough doesn't really need the structural integrity of a loaf of bread, but it's just what I do.",
      "Now you have two choices, you can put each ball in a little olive oil lined bowl, cover, and proof for 2-4 hours and then use, or you can retard the rising by brushing with olive oil and wrapping them in plastic.

If you are using a bowl, don't make the layers more than a half-inch to an inch deep; you want to be able to see the beautiful striations, and each serving spoonful should yield a combination of them all. I began with black beans on the bottom because they are the sturdiest of all the ingredients and can stand to soak up dressing that accumulates at the bottom. Next, I layered the celery because, again, it is hardy; too, its color is beautiful against the black beans. I spooned about 2 tablespoons of dressing over the celery. Next, in went some yellow lentils, followed by a layer of red rice, and more dressing. The red onions, yellow corn, red rice, tender cucumbers and some more dressing finished filling the jars. I set the lids in place, screwed on the rings, and stored the jars of salad in the refrigerator overnight. Plan to do the same if you are layering the salad in a bowl, and be sure to cover it tightly with plastic since there are some strong flavors and scents that will be best retained in the salad, not flavoring your butter and eggs.",
