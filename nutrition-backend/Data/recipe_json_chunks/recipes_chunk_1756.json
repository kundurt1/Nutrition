Raise your crust just big sufficient to hold a large goose; first have a picked dry tongue boiled tender sufficient to peel, cut off the root, bone a goose and a large fowl; take half a quarter of an oz of mace beat fine, a large teaspoonful of beaten pepper, three teaspoonfuls of salt; mix all together, season your fowl and goose with it, then lay the fowl in the goose, and the tongue in the fowl, and the goose in the same form as id whole.",
      "Put half a lb.",
      "of butter on the top, and lay on the lid.",
      "this pie is delicious, either warm or possibly cool, and will keep a great while.",
      "A slice of this pye cut down across makes a pretty little side dish for supper.\"",
      "A splendid centre piece for a party.",
      "Unless your pie has to go by train to London, like Mr Turner's, there is no need to make such a thick crust.",
      "However it must be thick sufficient to keep in the juices as far as possible.",
      "I recommend a warm-water pastry made with 3 lbs flour.",
      "It seems which the varieties of poultry in Hannah Glasse's day were not as large as they are now, because you need to increase the seasonings (as in ingredients list IMH).",
      "To make pastry",
      "Bring water to boil with the lard and the salt.",
      "As soon as it comes to the boil, tip it into the middle of the flour, mixing everything together rapidly to a dough with a wooden spoon or possibly electric beater.",
      "Leave the dough till it can be handled without too much discomfort, but don't let it allow to cold.",
      "Cut off about a quarter for the lid and put the rest into a large hinged pie mould, or possibly even a roasting pan 11 \" x 9\" x 2\" as a mould.",
      "Quickly and lightly push the pastry up the sides of the tin, being careful to leave no cracks.",
      "If the pastry collapses down into a dismal heap, it is a little too warm, so wait and try again.",
      "Having put your filling in the pie, put on the lid, fixing it with beaten egg, and make a central hole.",
      "Decorate the top with leaves and roses made from the trimmings.",
      "Before starting the pastry, soak, boil, trim and skin the tongue as usual.",
      "Bone the goose and the chicken.",
      "Prepare the seasonings.",
      "Proceed as above, putting the tongue inside the chicken inside the goose, seasoning as you go.",
      "Put the butter on top and close the pie with the lid section that you reserved.",
      "To bake the pie, put it into a warm oven, mark 7 425F for 20 min.",
      "then lower the heat to Mark 4 350 F and cover the top with brown paper to prevent it from becoming too brown too soon.",
      "Leave for 3 hrs.",
      "It is only prudent to check the pie from time to time.",
      "Lower the heat if it is bubbling away too fast, to mark 3 325F.",
      "Towards the end of this time, push a larding needle or possibly skewer into the pie through the top central hole; if the juices come out very red, leave the pie a little longer.",
      "On the other hand, if they come out a pale pink, which is all right - the pie continues to cook as it cools down (I took mine out of the oven at 1 am., and it was still not quite cool by lunchtime next day, with the juices still liquid: it should have been left till the evening with an hour or possibly two in the refrigerator to set it properly JG).",
