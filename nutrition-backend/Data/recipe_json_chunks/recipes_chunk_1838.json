      "I always use extra potatoes from the night before for this, I just boil twice as many as I need for mashed potatoes and then just save the cut potato in the cooking water in the fridge, but you may not do this, so we will start from scratch - peel and cut the 5 large potatoes and put about 3 quarts of water in the pot with them, season this water with 1 T garlic powder and 2 tablespoons chicken bouillon, let them cook down until about 3/4 of the water is gone, now pull them off the heat and just give them a mash or 3 - this soup is chunky, but if you like it creamed you could do it later.",
      "Preheat a heavy bottom skillet (about 3 to 4 inches deep) get your package of bacon first, cut strips off of both ends, approx and 1/8th of an inch thick, you want to take about 2 inches off each end this way, if your going to use it as a topper do the whole package - you really want the fatty ends for this - don't worry too much about separating them, they are going to separate easily in the pan - we like them in the short strips but if you want them diced go ahead - fry the bacon just until it's soft, now scoot it to one side of the pan and add in your finely died onion, cook it in the bacon grease until it is soft, now scoot the bacon back in the grease and cook it about a minute more.",
      "Now scoop the bacon and onion out and just add it to the potato pot, if you using some for topping put it to the side on a paper towel, pour the grease out and just add back 1 tablespoon into the pan and add in 1 to 2 tablespoons butter - let the butter melt and then sprinkle the flour into the grease, were going to still it til it just gets brown - keep stirring it, add add in your milk, not all at once, just about 1 cup first them 1/2 cup at a time after that, stirring it constantly at this point, we want it to look like a thin gravy, when it is like a thin gravy add in your shredded cheeses, stir it constantly until the cheese has melted - this is a true cheese sauce, you could use it for mac and cheese also, or add some salsa and use it as nacho dip - but for this recipe we are going to add it to the pot with the potatoes - it will be too thick, so we are going to cut it with some milk - this is where you taste it, add in your salt to taste, start with a teaspoon (because that bouillon is salty) and add a little bit more til you have the salt right - now season it with you thyme, celery salt and parsley - never bring this back up to a boil, it can simmer on low, but that it's it.",
      "If it gets too thick just thin it with more milk -- This is not a highly seasoned soup, but the pepper jack cheese gives it a bite and the bacon is very flavorful.",
      "If you have leftovers, or are just making it for 1 or 2 people you can freeze the leftovers - when you want to eat it, let it come to a complete thaw then warm it over low heat thinning it with milk, I also like to add some chopped broccoli to it the second time around., just a handful is usually enough -- But squeeze the liquid out."

      "You might find it helpful to leave a small workspace clear in front of you where you can move each cookie as youre working on it.",
      "Prepare the border icing: Mix together the powdered sugar, vanilla, and 2 tablespoons of milk or water for the border icing using a spoon or a fork.",
      "It should be quite thick, and if you drizzle a little from your spoon, the ribbon should hold for a few second before melting back into the icing.",
      "This border icing should be just thick enough to pour easily.",

      "Prepare your flood icing while you wait.",
      "Prepare flood icing: Mix together the powdered sugar, vanilla and 2 1/2 tablespoons of milk or water for the flood icing using a fork or a spoon.",
      "This icing should still be fairly thick, but it should drizzle easily and a bit of drizzled icing should sink immediately back into the icing.",

      "2) The stock can be made months ahead and kept frozen in securely covered, heavy freezer containers.",
      "\"Variation\" Tips:",
      "1) Changing the type of stock can give your rice dish a totally different taste and (at times) color.",
      "Choose your stock according to your menu and don't be afraid to mix different types of stock,vegetables (and herbs) to create an even more complex flavor.",
      "Also, always thaw more stock than you'll need so you can boil it down until the volume is reduced (which will concentrate the flavor).",
      "Some winning combinations of stock: Beef and chicken, chicken and shrimp, veal and beef, veal and chicken or chicken and fish.",
      "Tips From a Teacher:",
      "The most renown type of aromatic rice is Basmati rice which (once grown only in Pakistan and India), is now also grown here in the United States.",
      "This type of rice is special (although pricey) not only for it's nutty, butterlike and seductive flavor, but during cooking, the grains swell much more in length than in width, making the feel of the cooked rice more distinctive in the mouth.",
      "Basmati rice is also lower in starch which encourages the grains to remain separate.",
      "Jasmine rice, another long grain white rice once grown exclusively in Thailand, is now also grown here and the flavor is similar to Basmati although the texture is somewhat softer when cooked.",
