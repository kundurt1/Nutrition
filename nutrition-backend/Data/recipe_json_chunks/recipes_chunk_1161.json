I've tried these not par-baking first but it seems par-baking makes the better \"lite crunch\" on the outside of the crust and is best for freezing.",

Place the crust back into a 9 inch pan, which has again been seasoned with olive oil and brush the top of the crust again. If you use a pizza screen, brush top and bottom. Apply the toppings of your choice and bake for 12-15 minutes at 425 degrees (less time if using a screen). You'll have a finished pizza that has a light crunch on the outside and a delightfully chewy texture. When checking cooking time, look for a golden brown edge on the crust."

Continue on high heat until the shrimp turn opaque & pink and tails begin to curl, this will only take approximately 5-7 minutes, depending on the size of the shrimp. After boiling is complete, prepare to remove from water but DO NOT RINSE, or you will rinse away all teh good flavors!",
      "Quickly remove the shrimp with a large slotted spoon and place into DOUBLE zip lock bag, close securely. Place the bags of shrimp in the ice water bath to halt the cooking, being careful not to let any water seep into the bags. I like to put a plate over the bags to keep them submerged while they cool. Turn the bags over a time or 2 to insure shrimp are getting cooled down.",

Scoop alternating scoops of half of the ice cream and half of the sorbet into the crust using an ice-cream scoop. Smooth the top, filling in any gaps. Tile slices of pound cake over the ice cream.

Scoop the remaining ice cream and sorbet onto the hot fudge sauce and smooth the top. Cover with plastic wrap and freeze until completely set, 4 hours.",

Fruit jams could be used as a filling in place of hot fudge. Other things that hold up as well as pound cake - brownies, chocolate chip cookies, ice cream sandwiches."

Wash the plants and chop them up real fine and put in a saucepan with enough water to barely cover. Salt and pepper to taste. I added a little fresh chopped jalapeno pepper to mine but that's optional. Throw in about 1/2 cup of finely diced smoked ham chunks, cover with lid and simmer until the tumbleweed is tender. Then you can run it all through a blender or food processor to puree. You should have a thick soup as an end result that tastes very well. I've tried it using bacon instead of ham and it's ok but I prefer ham. If you want a chunkier soup you don't have to puree it. There are quite a few variations. Any split pea soup recipe will do, substituting the tumbleweed for the peas of course."

In a large bowl, thoroughly stir together the flour, salt, and yeast. Gradually but vigorously stir the ice water into the cooled cornmeal until very smoothly blended. Then vigorously stir the cornmeal mixture into the bowl with the flour, scraping down the sides until the ingredients are thoroughly blended. If too dry to mix completely, a bit at a time, stir in just enough more ice water to blend the ingredients; don't over-moisten, as the dough should be stiff. If the dough is soft, vigorously stir in enough more flour to stiffen it. Brush or spray the top with vegetable oil. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap. If desired, for best flavor or for convenience, you can refrigerate the dough for 3 to 10 hours. Then let rise at cool room temperature for 12 to 18 hours.",
      "Second Rise: Vigorously stir the dough, adding more flour if needed to yield a hard-to-stir dough. Using an oiled rubber spatula, fold the dough in towards the center all the way around. Brush or spray the top with oil. Re-cover with nonstick spray-coated plastic wrap.",
      "Let Rise Using Any of These Methods: For a 1-1/2- to 2-1/2-hour regular rise, let stand at warm room temperature; for a 1- to 2-hour accelerated rise, let stand in a turned-off microwave along with 1 cup of boiling-hot water; or for an extended rise, refrigerate, covered, for 4 to 12 hours, then set out at room temperature. Continue the rise until the dough doubles from the deflated size, removing the plastic if the dough nears it.",
      "Baking Preliminaries: 20 minutes before baking time, put a rack in the lower third of the oven; preheat to 450\u00b0F Heat a 3-1/2- to 4-quart (or larger) heavy metal pot in the oven until sizzling hot (check with a few drops of water), then remove it, using heavy mitts. Taking care not to deflate the dough, loosen it from the bowl sides with an oiled rubber spatula and gently invert it into the pot. Don't worry if it's lopsided and raggedlooking; it will even out during baking. Generously spray or brush the top with water, then sprinkle over a tablespoon of cornmeal. Immediately top with the lid. Shake the pot back and forth to center the dough.",
      "Baking: Reduce the heat to 425\u00b0F Bake on the lower rack for 50 minutes. Remove the lid. Reduce the heat to 400\u00b0F Bake for 15 to 25 minutes longer, until the top is well browned and a skewer inserted in the thickest part comes out with just a few crumbs on the tip (or until the center registers 210\u00b0F to 212\u00b0F on an instant-read thermometer). Then bake for 5 minutes longer to ensure the center is baked through. Cool in the pan on a wire rack for 10 to 15 minutes. Remove the loaf to the rack. Cool thoroughly.",
      "Serving and Storing: This tastes good warm but will cut better when cool. Cool completely before storing. To maintain the crisp crust, store in a large bowl draped with a clean tea towel or in a heavy paper bag. Or store airtight in a plastic bag or foil: The crust will soften, but can be crisped by heating the loaf, uncovered, in a 400\u00b0F oven for a few minutes. The bread will keep at room temperature for 3 days, and may be frozen, airtight, for up to 2 months."
