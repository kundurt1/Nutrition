You need to avoid permitting clumps of paste to remain, or you'll be eating pizza bites that taste bad every now and then when you take a bite that has only what was left as a lump of tomato paste on top. Use hot tap water to make the mixing by hand easier. (I believe this is the right amount of sauce for a sixteen inch pizza made using two cups of flour. If you use one cup, roughly, of flour to make your dough, use half of the sauce recipe.) There is no pre-cooking of the sauce. Just put it on top of the crust after you have made little indentations all over the crust with a fork (\"fork-indented\").

Tie the herbs in a bundle with kitchen string or twine (something food-safe) and saute them in the hot oil until wilted. Add the onions, garlic, salt, and white pepper to the oil and saute until the onions are translucent. Turn the heat up to high and add the crimini and shitake mushrooms. Let this cook for about ten minutes, stirring occasionally as the liquid bubbles off. Add the chicken stock, porcini mushrooms, and the porcini liquid. Let the soup come to a boil and then reduce it to a simmer. Let simmer for 30 minutes. Remove the bundle of herbs. Stir the cream and butter into the soup. Using an immersion blender, puree the contents of the soup until smooth. Alternatively, you can ladle the soup into a blender and puree the soup in small batches - but I recommend letting the soup cool quite a bit before doing so and not overfilling the blender because explosive accidents can (and do) happen, which is why I now own an immersion blender.

    "title": "butterflied turkey with lemon sage gremolata from standards of excellence's chef rachelle boucher",
    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "1. Remove turkey from the refrigerator at least one hour before cooking. Set oven racks so that the top of the butterflied turkey, on top of the pan and rack will be at least 6 inches from the heat source. Make the gremolata by blending the butter with lemon zest, garlic, parsley and sage. Set aside at room temperature. Set oven temperature to 375\u00b0 F convection or 400\u00b0F thermal (non-convection). Prepare a shallow roasting pan with a rack or broiling pan by spraying both with non-stick spray. 2. You can order your turkey with the back bone removed or you can do it yourself. BE CAREFUL! Use poultry scissors, a sharp serrated knife or a boning knife. To butterfly, place breast side down on a cutting board and starting at the neck, remove backbone completely by cutting through the ribs on each side. Open the cavity and cut along one side of the ridge of the breast bone through the bone (not through the meat) so the turkey lays flat. Remove pointed wing tips. 3. Brush 2 Tablespoons of olive oil over the entire underside and legs; season generously with salt, pepper and paprika. Flip the turkey over and place on top of rosemary sprigs. Press the legs slightly away from the body of the turkey so they lie flat on the pan to insure even cooking. Tie one end of twine to a leg bone and bring it up under the breast and back down to the other leg bone. Be sure wings are tucked in. Tie off twine. Brush the top of the turkey with olive oil, generously season again and place in the oven. Place an inch or more water, stock or white wine in the pan to catch drippings for gravy. 4. Place the probe deep into the breast near the center bone and set it for 155\u00b0 F. 5. During the last 20 minutes of roasting, brush bird with half of the gremolata and finish roasting. Save remaining gremolata to serve with the turkey. 6. Remove from oven, and let meat rest for 20-30 min. to retain juices. The breast meat will reach 160\u00b0F and the legs will come up to 180\u00b0F."

Toss in enough good quality free range chicken so that each guest will have a breast and a Maryland piece, and continue to fry piece by piece in the pot until skin is golden brown. If you've bought whole chicken add the rest for flavour (but discard). Sprinkle two or three tablespoons of plain flour and continue cooking until absorbed. Then add two cups of reasonable cask shiraz and one of prefab real chicken stock. Throw the pancetta and garlic back in the pot. Season with plenty of salt, pepper and dried thyme. Add a handful of chopped red pepper in lieu of tomato and half a dozen spring onions cut in half and simmer for 40-80 minutes or until the sauce is the approximate consistency of sump oil. About 10 minutes before serving, add some chopped fresh basil and a big handful of button mushrooms cut in half. Good with boiled peas with fresh sage, and slices of crusty baguette to mop up."

Reduce mixer speed to medium and add eggs and vanilla; beat until very fluffy, about 30 seconds. Reduce speed to low and gradually add dry ingredients, beating just until combined (use a large spatula to incorporate any dry ingredients at the bottom of the bowl). Divide dough in half and wrap each in plastic, pressing down to form into 1/2\"-thick disks. Chill until firm, at least 2 hours.",

Roll out on a lightly floured piece of parchment paper into a large 1/8\"-thick rectangle (about 16x12\"), dusting with more flour as needed. Use a knife and a ruler (precision is key) to cut into 4x1 1/2\" rectangles, then use a thin metal spatula to transfer rectangles to a parchment-lined baking sheet, spacing 1\" apart.

Cut ice cream into 2\" pieces and place in a large bowl. Let sit until slightly softened, about 5 minutes, then stir with a wooden spoon or a large rubber spatula until the consistency of thick cake batter.

Plate the pasta on two dishes, top with the pork, and pour any remaining pan juices over. Serve with steamed broccoli or green beans. Grate manchego or parmesan over all."

When the foaming subsides, add the flour; cook about 1 minute. Whisk in the reserved chicken broth, the milk, any accumulated chicken juices, and the thyme. Bring to a simmer, then continue to simmer until the sauce fully thickens, about 1 minute. Season with salt and pepper to taste and stir in the sherry. Pour the sauce over the chicken mixture and stir to combine. Stir in the peas and parsley. Adjust the seasonings.

Pour the mixture into a 13 by 9-inch baking pan (or shallow baking dish of similar size) or six 12- ounce ovenproof dishes. Top with the desired pastry. Bake until the pastry is golden brown and the filling is bubbling, 30 minutes for the large pot pie and 20 to 25 minutes for the smaller pies. Serve hot."

      "In a large heavy thick bottomed pan;",
      "take a bit of olive oil and heat it up, but don't burn it. Add some chopped onion. When the onion is sort of clear and fragrant add whole canned tomatoes. Add raw chicken parts and cook and cook and cook until the chicken completely cooked through, but not falling apart. Remove the chicken from pan, mash the tomatoes with a hand held manual potato masher, then keep on cooking until tomatoes are sort of dry and dark in color. This will take a long time. Don't get impatient. You'll need to stir a lot to keep from burning near the end, because it will have reduced to a cup or so of solids. The amount of time it takes to get to this stage depends on how many cans of tomatoes you used. But the idea is to go slow and long. Once you have reduced it to almost DRY without burning, add water to approximately the same level as where you started out with the tomatoes. Gently stir smooth and add one can of tomato paste per can of whole tomatoes. Bring slowly up to simmer again and add cooked chicken back just to reheat it. Then add chopped garlic, cook for just a few minutes (overcooking here will mush the chicken and take the flavor from the garlic, so just cook until the garlic bits are tender ). Remove from heat add fresh Italian basil and either fresh or dried oregano and mint, to taste.",
      "Salt and pepper is optional (if the canned tomatoes had salt added, don't put more in)",

A bench scraper helps greatly with this step.",

      "4. At least 30 minutes before baking, preheat the oven to 450\u00b0 F. Put a 6- to 8-quart heavy covered pot (see note 1 below) in oven as it heats. When the dough is ready, carefully remove the pot from the oven. Transfer the dough to the pot by lifting the parchment by the edges, and carefully and quickly lowering the dough into the pot. Shake the pan once or twice if dough is unevenly distributed, but don't worry about it too much; it will straighten out as it bakes.",

An instant-read thermometer should register around 205\u00b0 to 210\u00b0 F when fully baked. Transfer to a wire rack to cool thoroughly, discarding the parchment."
