      "You will need 2 baking sheets, a large pastry bag, a 3/4-inch plain tip for piping shells, a 1/4-inch plain tip for filling the eclairs. My filling method makes it completely unnecessary to have the special long eclair tip shown in one photo.",
      "In a non-convection oven, plan to bake one sheet at a time. Preheat the oven to 400\u00b0 F with a rack in the lower third. (For a convection oven, you'll need four baking sheets; adjust the temperature according to your oven's instructions.)",
      "Make two parchment paper templates the size of your baking sheets as follows: Draw 2 sets of heavy parallel guidelines 4 1/2 inches apart (to make 4 1/2 inch eclairs shells) on each parchment.",
      "Whisk the whole eggs and the egg white together briefly. Divide the egg mixture into unequal portions-3/4 cup and 1/4 cup-and set both bowls near the stove. (Set aside any extra egg in a different bowl.)",
      "Put the butter, sugar and salt with water and milk in heavy bottom saucepan 7 to 8 inches in diameter. Bring the liquid to a simmer over medium heat, stirring frequently so that butter is completely melted by the time the liquid simmers. If it seems like the butter will not be melted in time, slide the pot off the burner and stir until the butter is melted, then return the pot to the burner and continue.",
      "When the liquid is simmering, dump all of the flour into the pot and commence stirring briskly with a wooden spoon or spatula until all of the flour and liquid are blended and form a stiff paste resembling mashed potatoes, with no patches of dry flour. Continue stirring-spreading, and mashing the paste over the bottom of the pan and gathering it back together again-for 4 to 5 minutes to cook the flour and dry the paste sufficiently to absorb the eggs that will be incorporated in the next step. Some crust will form on the sides and bottom of the pot (don't try to scrape and blend it back into the paste)-and your arm will be tired before you are finished.",
      "Turn the hot paste into the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a paddle (or a bowl in which you can operate a handheld electric mixer). Mix at low speed for 3 to 5 minutes until the paste has cooled to 103 degrees.",
      "Beating on medium speed, pour in the 3/4 cup of eggs in a slow, steady stream. Scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl as necessary, and if the mixture does not form a cohesive mass, turn the mixing speed up briefly to bring it together. Once the eggs are beaten in, turn the mixer off. If the batter is glossy and soft enough that it slumps slowly downwards from the beater-or falls very slowly from a big spoon-no more egg is needed. Beat the paste for another 2 minutes at medium speed.",
      "If the batter is dull and does not slump or fall slowly, judiciously add in as much of the last 1/4 cup of eggs as it takes to meet the criteria described and then beat for the last 2 minutes. (Combine all leftover egg and set aside for egg wash-whisked with a little water until paint-able-and/or breakfast.)",
      "Form and bake the choux: Set one template upside down on a baking sheet, and the other upside down on the counter. Fit the pastry bag with the large tip and fill with the paste. Pipe 6 or 7 fat fingers, 4 1/2 inches long, on each template, preparing your first and second batch. Use a natural bristle pastry brush to brush the fingers lengthwise with water or egg wash. (Dip the brush and remove excess liquid against the side of the bowl before brushing.) Rake the brushed fingers gently with the tines of a form. (Brushing and raking all help the shells to expand more evenly in the oven-if your piping is not smooth or even, use the brush to even them up.)",
      "Set the baking sheet with choux on a second baking sheet (turned upside-down if rimmed) and set the ensemble in the oven. (Double sheeting protects the bottoms of the shells from becoming too dark before the shells are fully baked). Bake 15 minutes without opening the oven. Shells should be puffed and golden. Rotate the baking sheet front to back and turn the oven down to 375\u00b0 F. Bake 15-18 minutes until the shells are more brown than golden brown (pale shells will be under-baked inside, soft on the outside, and may collapse as they cool).",
      "Transfer individual shells from the pan to a cooling rack. Turn the oven temperature back up to 400\u00b0, and set pans aside to cool.",
      "While shells are still hot drill two holes in the bottom of each one as follows: insert the tip of a paring knife one inch from one end of a shell and rotate it like a drill until the hole is slightly larger than 1/4 inch. Repeat one inch from the opposite end of the shell. (Holes release steam and are handy for filling later). Let shells cool completely.",
      "Once the pans are cooled, slide the second drawn-on parchment sheet with the piped choux on it onto one baking sheet, double sheet it by putting it atop the second baking sheet, and repeat instructions above for your second batch of eclair shells.",
      "When shells are completely cool, you can fill them with cream (https://food52.com/recipes/35141-vanilla-rice-flour-pastry-cream), or, better yet, freeze them for another day. Fresh or frozen, shells can be re-crisped (without thawing) on a baking sheet in a preheated 375 F oven until very hot to the touch, 6-8 minutes. Twice baking is not only an excellent hack whenever shells do not turn out quite as crispy as you want them to be, but might even make the best shells of all!",
      "To fill eclairs, scrape the pastry cream into a clean, dry, pastry bag fitted with the plain 1/4-inch tip. Cradle a shell in your palm and insert the tip of the bag into one hole. Squeeze cream into the shell until it wants to ooze back out. Repeat with the second hole. Scrape off any cream that has oozed and set the eclair right side up on a tray. Repeat with the remaining eclairs. Chill before glazing.",
      "Make the glaze: Melt the chocolate with the butter, corn syrup, and water in a stainless steel bowl set directly in a wide skillet of almost simmering water. Stir frequently until the chocolate is almost entirely melted. Remove the bowl from water and stir to finish melting the chocolate. Use immediately or set aside until later.",
      "To glaze eclairs, cool freshly made glaze (or gently reheat glaze that has set) to 88-90 F and pour it into a container long enough to fit an eclair, such as a small loaf pan, or a wide bowl. Dip the top of each chilled pastry into the glaze. Refrigerate immediately to set the glaze. Store eclairs in the refrigerator. They are best within 8 hours or filling, but still darned good for another day or two."

Once the sugar is incorporated, add the food coloring, until the desired color is reached. Continue to beat until stiff peaks form. This whole process should take about 8 minutes. You will know it's ready when you pick up the batter with a whisk and the mixture retains solid peaks. Set mixture aside.",

At first the mixture will seem dry and 'un-mixable,' but keep mixing until when you lift up the spatula, the batter will slowly stream down in thick ribbons. It shouldn't plop or clump down - this means you've under mixed it - but it should also not ooze down into thin, liquidy ribbons (this means you've over mixed it). They say it takes around 50 folds all together to reach the right consistency and this actually worked for me and was really helpful!",

Pipe the mixture into the 1 1/2 inch rounds on the baking sheet, about 1 inch apart, using the stencil as guidelines. This is to ensure the cookies will all cook evenly. If there are any points sticking on top of the cookie, use a damp finger to slightly press down and flatten the peaks.",

Place cookies into the oven and bake for 10-13 minutes, until firm and golden. If you pick up one of the cookies and it sticks to the parchment paper, it's not ready and needs more time. Once baked, remove macarons from the oven and place onto a drying rack to cool.",

Place into a piping bag and let chill in the fridge for at least 10 minutes before applying it to the macarons.",

Place the other macaron on top and gently press down to attach. Do this with the rest of the macarons. Store the cookies in the fridge or at room temperature (if it's not too hot) for a few days.

      "Heat the oven to 500\u00b0F. Line a rimmed sheet pan with foil, then add the bell peppers. Rub each with canola oil (you just want a thin film, so if there's any excess on the sheet tray, wipe it away with a towel). Roast the bell peppers for 20 to 30 minutes, flipping halfway, until their skin is charred and the flesh is fork-tender. Remove the sheet pan from the oven and bundle the peppers in the foil to steam for about 10 minutes (this will help the skins loosen).",

Let them cool completely before removing their skins. My favorite way to do this: Set a colander on top of the sheet tray, dump the walnuts in the colander, and use your hand to swirl them around; the skins will fall through the holes. (Don't worry if a few stubborn skins remain on the walnuts.)",
      "After the peppers have steamed, peel away as much of the skin as possible (a little remaining is fine). Lop off the tops, remove the seeds, and give the peppers a rough chop. Add to a large bowl, along with the olives, anchovies, and olive oil.",
      "When the water starts boiling, season it generously with salt (I estimate 1 tablespoon kosher salt per quart of water). Add the pasta and stir. Cook it for about 8 minutes, or until al dente (I start taste-testing at 7 minutes to avoid overcooking). Reserve 1/2 cup or so of pasta water, then drain.",
      "Add the pasta and walnuts to the bowl with the roasted peppers. Season with a big pinch each of salt and pepper, then toss. Add more salt, pepper, olive oil, or pasta water if necessary. You can eat this right away or leave it at room temperature to eat later in the day. If you refrigerate the pasta salad, you might want to add a bit more oil or pasta water right before serving to loosen it up."

Cut the vanilla bean(s) in half and scrape out the seeds. Set the seeds aside with the minced orange zest. Place the empty bean(s) into a 3.5 to 4 quart wide sauce/stock pot.",

      "Wash the quince well. Quarter, peel, and core them. Add the quince peels to the orange peels in the cheesecloth, and discard the cores. I find it easiest to use a melon baller to remove the stem and blossom ends, then a sharp knife to quarter the fruit. I then use the melon baller to scoop out the core, being careful to not cut myself and to get all the white core bits out. The core will never get soft, and the melon baller is surprisingly sharp. Don't worry if you don't get 100% of the peel removed from the nooks and crannies of the fruit.",
      "Add the quince quarters to the pot. Use some kitchen twine to tie the cheesecloth containing the peels into a sachet. Add it to the pot. If needed add extra water to the pot so the quince is mostly covered.",
      "Reduce heat to medium-low and allow the quince to cook until it is quite soft, stirring occasionally. The quince should break apart with stirring and should just be starting to turn pinkish, 60 to 90 minutes. Remove the sachet and set it into the quart measure or a small bowl.",
      "Place a mesh strainer over a large bowl. Carefully pour the quince and liquid through the strainer. Allow the mixture to drain, undisturbed for at least 30 minutes. Transfer the strained quince to a food processor with the blade attachment, removing the vanilla bean as you go. Puree until smooth, scraping the sides of the bowl once or twice, 60 to 90 seconds. Now is a good time to put a few small plates into the freezer for testing the butter later.",
      "Transfer the strained liquid back into the pot. Squeeze the liquid from the peel sachet and add it along with any liquid that drained into the measuring cup back into the pot.",
      "Cook the syrup on high until it has reduced by more than half, become a gorgeous translucent salmon color, and takes a half second or so to \"heal\" when a wooden spoon is scraped across the bottom of the pan. At first the mixture will boil vigorously and not need much babysitting. As the water evaporates and the mixture starts to thicken, the bubbles will get larger and the boiling will seem less intense. Turn the heat down to medium-high at this point, stir the mixture frequently, and babysit it closely as the sugar syrup can burn. A small amount of browning on the bottom will be okay, but burning will ruin the batch.",
      "Remove the syrup from the heat, and add the pureed quince back in. Stir together to thoroughly combine. The butter will be a lovely apricot color. The mixture should be thick enough that your spoon will leave traces. If for some reason it is not, return the mixture to medium-low heat and cook, scraping bottom frequently until it is thick enough. If you put a spoonful onto a cold plate, no water should weep from the perimeter.",
      "Taste the quince butter, and add sugar a tablespoon at a time if needed to get your ideal sweet-tart balance. Make sure to stir well so the sugar gets fully dissolved. Stir in the orange zest and vanilla seeds. Transfer to an airtight container or canning jars (process as for jam). Keeps refrigerated for a month or more."

Once melted, add the shallots and toss to coat. Add the water and salt, and toss again. Reduce heat to low, cover and cook stirring occasionally until the shallots are softened, about 20 minutes. Remove the cover and cook until most of the water has cooked off, about 3 to 5 minutes. Cool to room temperature, then transfer to a tightly sealed container and refrigerate until you are ready to cook your turkey.",
      "While the shallots are cooking or cooling, butterfly your turkey (unless you've had your butcher do it for you). Using a sharp kitchen or poultry shears cut along each side of the backbone starting at the neck. You will hit a point where you cannot cut any further at the pelvic area. Use your cleaver to chop and hack through the pelvic bones, being exceedingly careful not to cut yourself. (See video link in Cook's notes above.) Once the backbone has been removed from the turkey, turn the turkey over and push down on the breast to break the keel bone. I had to wrap the turkey in plastic wrap and bash it with my cast iron skillet a couple of times to make it happen. (Phew! The hardest part is now over.)",
      "With the turkey breast side up, gently separate the skin from the breast meat using your fingers or the end of a wooden spoon. Flip the turkey over and do the same with the skin over the legs. Be careful not to tear the skin. Flip the turkey over again, and make your salt paste.",
      "In a small bowl combine the kosher salt and honey, mixing together into a homogenous paste. Rub about 1 tablespoon of the paste under the skin over each breast, massaging out any clumps and trying to get an even coating. Rub about 2 teaspoons of the paste under the skin over each leg, again massaging out the clumps and aiming for even dispersal. Rub the remaining paste on what would've been the cavity of a whole turkey. Wrap the turkey in plastic, and place on a platter, then refrigerate for 24 to 48 hours to let the brine work its magic.",
      "About 3 1/2 hours before meal time, remove the turkey from the refrigerator. Unwrap it, and pat it dry with paper towels or a clean tea towel. Transfer the turkey to a cooling rack (set over a pan to catch any juices,) and set aside. Preheat your oven to 425\u00b0F with a rack in the lower middle position.",
      "Remove your shallot confit from the refrigerator when you pull the turkey out. Transfer it to a medium sized bowl.",
      "Zest the oranges, and add zest (about a heaping tablespoon) to the confit. Set the oranges aside, you will be using them shortly. Add the mustard, minced thyme, coriander, cumin, and pepper to the confit. Stir to combine. (Note: the duck fat is soft enough at refrigerator temperature to mix into a smooth paste. Butter will need to warm up a bit to mix well.)",
      "With the turkey breast side up, insert about 1/4 of the seasoned shallot confit under the skin of each breast, attempting to cover the entire surface of the meat evenly. Flip the bird over and work about 1/3 of the remaining paste under the skin of each leg. Rub remaining paste onto what would've been the cavity of a whole bird.",
      "Slice the ends off each orange, then slice the oranges into thirds. Remove the skins from the onion, slice the ends off, then cut 2 slices from the onion about the thickness of the orange slices you have. Separate each onion slice into 2 or 3 groups of rings. Arrange the orange and onion slices on a rimmed baking sheet; you are creating a \"rack\" for the turkey to rest on to keep it elevated from the pan. Scatter thyme sprigs over the orange and onion slices.",
      "Place the turkey breast side up over the orange and onion slices. Tie the drum sticks together so the legs rest on the narrow portion of the breast -- this helps to protect the breast from cooking too quickly. Tuck the wings under the breasts. The turkey should essentially be in a single thickness layer. Rub the skin with the oil. Set aside until about 2 1/2 hours prior to mealtime.",
      "Place turkey in oven, and set timer for 30 minutes. After 30 minutes lower the oven heat to 325\u00b0F. Cook the turkey until the breast meat registers 165\u00b0 F on an instant read thermometer, about 75 to 115 minutes. Rotate the pan from front to back at about the halfway point. Monitor for excess browning of the bird, and cover with aluminum foil if needed.",
      "Remove from the oven and allow turkey to rest for 20 to 30 minutes before carving and serving."

      "While the grill heats, bring a large pot of generously salted water to a boil over high heat. Add the orzo and cook according to the package instructions until al dente (tender but still firm). Drain the orzo in a colander, rinse it briefly, then transfer it to a mixing bowl. Drizzle the pasta with enough olive oil to lightly coat and toss to combine (this will help prevent the pasta from sticking).",

      "When the fire begins to produce a steady stream of smoke, pour the shrimp into the preheated skillet and cook, flipping the shrimp and rotating the pan around the heat (closing the lid in between to make the most of the wood smoke) until just cooked (they will turn opaque and be firm and springy to the touch), 5 to 6 minutes total. Remove the pan from the heat and let the shrimp cool briefly.",

Taste and adjust the seasonings, adding more salt or pepper as desired. Divide the pasta and shrimp among bowls and serve warm or at room temperature with the grilled lemon halves. Refrigerate any leftovers in a sealed container in the fridge for up to 4 days.",
      "**NOTE: Smoking is where the magic happens. Incorporating hardwood in any of the following forms creates a stream of aromatic smoke to infuse whatever you're cooking. If you're using a gas grill, your only option is to rey on wood chips (soaked in water beforehand so they'll slowly smolder) placed in a smoker box or foil packet that's placed directly on the grates over a flame. You can also use soaked chips in a charcoal grill, either wrapped in a foil packet or scattered directly on the coals. Chips burn much more quickly than wood chunks, so consider the latter for recipes that require longer cook times. I love wood chunks because I can place a couple directly on a bed of hot coals (no soaking required), where they'll light quickly and smolder steadily, and they're easy to move with tongs if I need to balance the heat. Wood chunks are a great way to build heat if your temperature begins to drop midway through cooking and you don't have hot coals at the ready. Once the chunks ignite, you can control the speed at which they burn by moving them around the fire and venting your grill to control the amount of air the fire is receiving."

If desired, dust with powdered sugar (or non dissolving sugar) using a fine meshed sieve held about 6 inches above, when the cake is cool. Optionally, you can place an object on the top of the cake and sift powdered sugar around it for a fun decorative effect (as illustrated from my earlier version). You can also serve this cake warm or have it for breakfast. For non-vegan options, serve with a dollop of creme fraiche, ginger ice cream, a Greek yogurt rhubarb icing, or a tequila-lime goat cheese frosting. Slice into small pieces and enjoy."

If it's too spicy for you, let it sit for another week. If it's just right, put mustard in the refrigerator (cooling halts the \"mellowing\" process).

Bring the cold water and kombu to a boil (cook for about 5 to 10 mins), add bonito flakes, and cook for about 5 to 10 mins. Strain and reserve the broth to remove the kombu and bonito flakes. (You might need to to season the dashi, if so use some soy sauce).",

During this time the flavor from the meatballs and shiitake mushrooms will infuse the broth. Ladle the soup into bowl and garnish with the reserved sliced scallion. Enjoy!!"

Add the beef to the pot, working in batches to avoid crowding (so the meat sears and browns rather than steams). Let the short ribs cook undisturbed until deeply browned on all sides, flipping with tongs, 3 to 4 minutes per side. (When the meat is sufficiently seared, it will release from the pot without tugging and lift easily with tongs.) Transfer the browned pieces to a large bowl and repeat with the remaining pieces, adding more oil as needed if the pot looks dry. Reduce the heat and add a few drops of water if the browned glaze on the bottom of the pot begins to scorch or does not loosen. (The multi cooker might issue a burn warning message if there are solids stuck to the bottom of the pot during pressure-cooking.)",

      "Hint: Braised beef always tastes best the second or third day, so when time allows, let the finished dish cool to room temperature, which you can speed up by setting the inner pot in a large bowl or sink of ice water. When it's time to serve the dish, discard the fat that collects and solidifies on top. Wipe the outside of the inner pot dry, return it to the multi-cooker, and reheat the meat and gravy on WARM HIGH before serving."

I haven't tried this yet, but it might work to apply a little egg wash to the back of the almond before you first press it into the raw dough. 2) Rough up the bottom end of the finger with a knife before baking...looks a little gorier that way. 3) This looks like a lot of work, and it is, but it goes pretty quickly if you do each step on a tray worth of cookies at once...in other words, don't make each cookie individually from beginning to end, make all the cylinders, insert all of the almonds, etc."

Remove the sheet cake from the pan by flipping it over and peel off the parchment. Trim of the curved sides if necessary (doing this will yield an 8x12 inch sheet) and divide the cake along the longer side into three 8x4 inch portions. Cool completely cakes completely before frosting. (I froze the sheets for two hours before icing.)",
      "In the bowl of your electric stand mixer or with a hand mixer, at medium speed beat the cream cheese and mascarpone cheese until smooth. Add in the vanilla and icing sugar and beat until smooth. Using the whisk attachment, gradually add in the heavy cream and whip at increasing speed until the frosting is thick enough to spread. Be careful not to overwhip or you'll end up with mascarpone butter. If necessary, add more sugar or cream as needed to get the right consistency. Chill to thicken before using.",
      "To assemble the cake, remove the layers from the freezer and frost each layers with about 4 tablespoons of cream in between each layer. Spread a thin layer of frosting over the entire cake with a crumb coat and freeze uncovered for 45 minutes to an hour. Repeat with a second crumb coat if necessary before frosting the final coating. Decorate accordingly, I used some cocoa nibs on the sides and top of this cake. I find that refrigerating the frosted cake overnight keeps the frosting stable at room temperature for many hours when the cake was served the next day. Cakes keeps covered and chilled for up to 3 days."

Stretch the dough a bit to create a ring, then gently place it in the pan. Fill the pan with as many rings as you can fit. Cook until the bottom of the sfinj is golden brown, then flip them with a non-plastic spatula - about 2 minutes each side.",

Many stores now stock ready to slice cooked beets in the refrigerated case. To steam your own beets, cut off the tops (save and saute with a little garlic and olive oil) wash, and bake covered with foil in a small baking dish containing about an inch of water and a drizzle of olive oil; bake at 400 degrees until tender, about 45 minutes. Test with a sharp knife. Cool to the touch and the peel slides off easily. An inexpensive handheld mandoline slicer, is best to achieve razor thin slices."

This dough can be a little delicate and tricky (which can be frustrating, but the baked shell gives you great flavor and texture). Use moistened fingers to repair any cracks. Gently drape your dough over a 9 inch tart pan with removable bottom (many pastry chefs recommend using your rolling pin to help with the transfer, but I never find this to help much, so I just lift it gently with my hands all the way underneath).

Remove from the heat and stir in the chopped chocolate. Allow to sit for 30 seconds to a minute, then using a wooden spoon or whisk, start stirring in small circles in the center of the saucepan slowly working your way out until you have a uniform melted ganache mixture (this stirring technique keeps it smooth and introduces a minimal amount of air). Pour the ganache into the cooked tart shell, spread it evenly over the bottom, and allow it to cool completely to room temperature.",
      "Go back to making the rest of the filling. In a small bowl, whisk the egg yolks for a minute until lightened and lemon colored. Over medium-low heat, combine the infused cream with the brown sugar in a saucepan, stirring until the sugar is completely melted. Bring the cream to a simmer, then take off the heat.",
      "Pour about 1/4 cup of the hot cream mixture into the egg yolks, whisking vigorously all the while to temper the yolks. Repeat. Then, scrape the egg yolk mix into the saucepan.

Add lemon and orange juice and zest strips, honey, sugar, vanilla beans and pod pieces, white wine, and ginger pieces to pan. Add one cup water (plus extra, if needed, in order to just cover the pears).",

(Alternatively, you could chop them in a food processor, pulsing until you get the desired result, being careful not to overchop them into a paste). Set finely chopped hazelnuts aside.",
      "When you're ready to cook the crepes, bring the batter to room temperature. Check the consistency of the batter--it should just coat the back of a spoon, like a heavy cream. Add water a little bit at a time if you need to thin the batter, then stir in the finely chopped hazelnuts (it's best to add the hazelnuts just before you cook the crepes, otherwise, if they sit in the batter, they will get soggy). Heat a 6-inch nonstick skillet over high heat, add a dab of butter (enough to thinly coat the bottom of the pan), lift the pan from the heat, and pour 1/4 cup batter into the center of the bottom of the pan as you quickly swirl it around to spread the batter evenly.",
      "Return the pan to the heat. As it cooks through, gently peel it from the pan with a rubber spatula; flip the crepe with the spatula or your fingers and cook it on the second side until light golden brown. Repeat until all crepes have been cooked (stir the batter before you ladle the batter for each crepe, since hazelnuts may settle to the bottom of your bowl).",
      "To assemble, fold the crepes in half, then in half again. Place one or two on a plate. Top with 8 or so pear pieces; spoon ginger syrup over the top. Add a dollop of creme fraiche. Sprinkle coarsely chopped hazelnuts on top."

      "Bring some water to a boil, In my dream, I hadn't wanted to buy stock, so I decided to make an impromptu mushroom stock. Our little kitchenette (very -ette) was nicely equipped with basic equipment, but it clearly was not anticipated that anyone would be doing something so sophisticated as measuring. So I filled a coffee cup four times with boiling water, plus an extra splash. I had put the mushrooms in our one large bowl, poured in the boiling water, and set one of our two dinner plates on top to retain the heat. We poured some wine and sat down to read in front of the lovely huge window that let in a cooling evening breeze. After about a half hour, the water was looking richly brown, so we started prepping the onions and garlic. Start to finish, the mushrooms probably soaked for a good 45 minutes.",
      "I set the bowl of mushrooms and their stock (no strainer) in the microwave to heat up preparatory to making the risotto. We melted some butter and added some olive oil and when they were hot, added the garlic. Instantly, our little place was starting to smell seriously good. I added the rice and stirred it around to toast for a few minutes, then added the wine and stirred slowly until most of it was absorbed. The stock was next While I added it a coffee cupful at a time, dodging mushrooms and stirring exquisitely slowly all the while, my daughter made us a beautiful salad and tossed it simply with olive oil and sea salt. As the risotto began to look creamier and creamier, she sliced an unbelievably fresh baguette and refilled the wine glasses.",
      "When all the stock was in the pot, and the risotto perfectly al dente, I swirled in the lemon zest and juice, the green onions (their flavor wants to be bright, and they'll lend a bit of a good crunch) a knob of butter, the cheese, and last, the mushrooms and the bit of remaining stock. I seasoned it up, and transferred it to plates. Finally, I snipped some fresh chives over the top. We sat down together and raised a toast to the power of dreams."

      "Make the pastry dough: \r\n\r\nIn the bowl of a food processor, pulse the dry ingredients together, then add the cold butter and lard. Give 7-9 quick pulses, or until the fats are just bigger than peas. \r\n\r\nTurn on the processor and add the water in a stream down the feed tube while the machine runs, just until the dough has started to collect together in a mass around the blade.\r\n \r\nTurn the dough out onto your work surface, and use the heels of your hand to smear the dough out all over (about five or six strokes are perfect); the goal is to create flaky little layers of butter in the dough, while keeping it as cold as possible- this is called a fraisage. \r\n\r\nGather the dough and form into a disk. \r\n\r\nChill for at least one hour. \r\n\r\n(This can also be done by hand, rustic style: cutting the fats into the dry ingredients with your fingers or a pastry blender, then adding the ice water and proceeding as usual).",
      "Make the filling:\r\n\r\nMix the dried cherries with the juice, zest, sugar and salt in a saucepan. \r\n\r\nBring to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce the heat to medium/ medium-low, and continue to simmer until the cherries have plumped beautifully, and the mixture is reduced by about half. \r\n\r\nAdd the drained cherries. Using an immersion blender, or taking about 1/3 of the mixture out and putting in the food processor, lightly puree some of the cherry mixture. The idea is to get some of the cherries broken down to thicken and hold the filling together, while leaving a nice textural element to the filling. Just eye it and call it a day. \r\n\r\nContinue to cook the filling until it has reduced down to a lovely thick jammy compote. \r\n\r\nCool the mixture completely (if it is only very slightly warm, you can get away with it, but you just don't want to melt the crust).",
      "Assemble the pies!\r\n\r\nDivide the chilled dough in two, and roll out each half. This is a matter of preference, we like a thinner crust, about 1/8\" thick. Cut out rectangles (or other simple shapes) by hand, or with a toaster pastry stamper (ours measures approximately 3 1/2\" x 4 1/2\". Be sure to cut out an even number of shapes, so they can be paired together. \r\n\r\nIf you have leftover dough scraps, you can cut out little shapes (stars, hearts etc.) to decorate the pies with, or to brush with melted butter or an egg wash, and then sprinkle with cinnamon-sugar and nibble on with a cup of tea.\r\n\r\nLay the pastry shapes onto parchment lined baking sheets. Brush the edges of the rectangles with an egg wash (whisk an egg with a spot of cream or milk) and spoon on the filling; keep the filling within the border of the egg wash (about 1/2'' from the sides), mounding it some in the center. \r\n\r\nLay a pastry piece atop a piece with filling, pressing lightly around the edges to seal. Use a table fork to gently tamp down the edges all around the pastries. This will help seal them, and also leave cute crimp marks. \r\n\r\nBrush the sealed pastries with egg wash. Decorate with dough shapes if you're feeling artsy. *Note, if you are skipping the cream cheese glaze, I would give the pies a nice sparkly sprinkle of sugar (turbinado or regular).",
      "Refrigerate the pies for about 15 minutes. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.",
      "Bake the pies for five minutes. Then turn down the oven to 375 degrees and continue baking for about another 20 minutes, or until the pies are golden brown all over. Some cherry filling may have seeped out in a couple of places, which should luxuriously bubble about around the edges and contribute beautifully to the appeal.",
      "Cool the pies some before adding the glaze. They are sublime warm with the glaze, which will start to melt into a translucent creaminess (if you were- or still are- a Toaster Strudel lover, you will be in dreamland). They are also fabulous served tepid (picnic style!!!) with the glaze. The decision is yours, though you'll probably want to sample one in each way just to make sure. . .",
      "Make the cream cheese glaze:\r\n\r\nStir together the cream cheese, sugar, vanilla and cream until well incorporated. The mixture should have the texture of a soft icing. \r\n\r\nAdorn the pastries with the glaze at your pleasure: you may wish to spread it all over, drizzle it with the tines of a fork, or use a pastry bag (or a plastic bag with the corner snipped), and go for it. \r\n\r\nThe glaze will set up, which allows for perfect packing into picnic baskets or lunch boxes. I have found that the glaze holds fine at room temperature. \r\n\r\nThe pies, glazed or not, will keep for 2-4 days well-wrapped at room temperature, but they freeze beautifully. Just wrap the pies, put them in a sealed plastic bag before setting them in the freezer. Bring them back to life in a 375 degree oven until warm and crisp again.",

Add the large egg yolks (or whole eggs) into the center of the well and whisk them with a fork. Slowly work your way outwards to gradually incorporate the flour into the eggs. Now slowly knead the dough inside the bowl and try to get all the flours into the dough. If the dough feel too dry to come together, wet your hands with water and work the water into the dough (instead of pouring water directly onto the dough) because it gives you better control as how much more water you are adding. Once the dough as come together, take it out of the bowl and start kneading on the counter. You must do this vigorously for about 10 minutes, until the dough is very smooth and elastic. It should spring back when you make a dent with your finger.\r\n\r\nWrap the dough in plastic wrap and let rest for at least 30 min.",

With a counter-top pasta machine, or a pasta machine-attachment on your mixer, run the dough through the widest setting. Then fold the dough in 3 folds (like folding a letter), and run it again. Repeat once more.",
      "Now you should have a rectangular/oval-shaped dough with sort of uneven ends. Don't worry about it. Feed the dough through the machine again, but this time, STOP MIDWAY. Then bring the 2 ends of the dough together, overlap them and pinch them lightly so they stick. Hold them in position and start running it again through the machine. Once the \"seam\" passes through the machine, you should have a connected, \"conveyor belt\" looking pasta sheet that passes through the machine. Keep running the machine to ensure that the seam/connection point is tightly merged together.\r\n\r\nNow, no more re-feeding.",

    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "In a bowl, thoroughly combine the flour and salt and make a well in the center. In a separate bowl, thoroughly combine the yeast, olive oil, and lukewarm water. Pour the wet mixture into the well in the dry mixture and begin mixing the two together with your hands, gradually incorporating the dry into the wet. The process will be more like mixing than kneading. After about 3 minutes, when the wet and dry are well combined, set the mixture aside and let it rest, uncovered for 15 minutes. This allows time for the flour to absorb the moisture.",
      "Flour your hands and a work surface. Gently but firmly knead the mixture on the work surface for about 3 minutes. Reflour your hands and the surgace as needed. The dough will be moist and sticky, but after a few minutes, it should come together in a smooth mass. Divide the dough into 2 pieces, shape them gently into balls, and wrap them tightly in plastic wrap. Refrigerate the dough for at least 24 hours and up to 48, before using. This process, called proofing, allows for the fermentation that gives the dough structure - which means a chewy pliable crust - and flavor.",
      "To make a pizza, preheat the oven to the highest temperature - ideally at least 500\u00b0F. Place a pizza stone or four 6X6 inch unglazed quarry tiles on the middle rack of the oven. Let the oven heat up for 1 hour.",
      "Remove the dough from the refrigerator and let it come to room temperature. Lightly flour your hands and a work surface. Using your fingertips, push down any bubbles in the dough. Then, use your fingertips to push down on the round of dough, from the center out to the perimeter, to encourage it to spread out. Don't push the dough out - and pushing or pulling you do will cause it to toughen, be gentle with the dough. Take your time. Spend a minute or two gently flattening the dough ball into a disc shape before you move on to the next step.",
      "Aim for a round that's no bigger than 12 inches across and no less than 1/8 inch thick in the center; it should be a little thicker than that at the edges. \"Slapping out\" the dough (yup, that's really what it's called) is basically letting the crust form itself. It lets gravity do the stretching and shaping of the dough. There are many ways to do this and you should find the way you're comfortable. The Roberta's guys do this: pick up the disc of dough and hold your hands parallel to the floor. Then, squeeze your fingers together and curve them so that your hands are like paddles. Drape the dough over one hand and flip it over to the other hand in a smooth motion. Continue moving the dough slowly back and forth, rotating it 90 degrees every few seconds so that you end up with a circle. (Clearly, based on the photo, I failed to follow this instruction adequately and wound up with a wobbly oblong pizza instead of a circle, but whatever.) After a couple minutes you should have a round of dough that's about 12 inches in diameter. Transfer it to a well-floured pizza peel, preferably a metal one. Top and bake it immediately otherwise it will get soggy.",
      "To make the pizza sauce, drain the tomatoes and discard the juice. Ise a blender to puree the tomatoes until almost smooth. Add a splash of olive oil and a pinch of salt, blend until smooth and taste. Add more oil and salt to taste, but remember that the sauce will reduce a little when it's baked on a pizza, so be judicious with the salt. The sauce will keep in the fridge for a week or the freezer for 6 months. (Which is good because they only call for 3 Tbs. for a pizza.).",
      "Put 3 Tbs. of sauce in the center of the dough round and use the back of a spoon to spread it evenly over the pizza, stopping about half an inch from the edge. Break the mozzarella into pieces and distribute them over the pizza, leaving a space in the middle where the egg will go. Distribute guanciale over the pizza in the same way. Give the pizza a small drizzle of olive oil and bake it in the preheated oven until the crust is golden brown and bubbly.",
      "While the pizza is cooking, coat a saute pan lightly with olive oil and set it over medium heat. Crack the egg into the pan and cook it without moving it until the white just barely sets. The white should be set, but the yolk should still be runny. When the pizza is done, slide it out of the oven and put the egg on top."

      "Pour the chocolate directly on top of the crust. Allow it to set in a cool place for an hour before serving. You can also pop it in the fridge for 15 minutes-1/2 hour if you're in a rush. If making ahead and refrigerating for more than 2 hours, the ganache may lose some of its sheen. Remove and allow to temper for 30 min-2 hours before serving (Depending on how long it's been refrigerated) so that the ganache softens. You can also very quickly run a creme brulee torch over the surface of the tart to get the sheen back. Just before serving sprinkle with a few pieces of hazelnut and sea salt crystals. I love the texture and flavor of Maldon, but you could try fleur de sel, too!"

    "title": "vegan greens and sunchoke ravioli",
    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "Make the filling: I highly recommend you do this the night before, so the filling will have time to release as much water as possible.\r\nCook the greens in a pot that can fit all of them, with just a couple inches of salted boiling water. Cover the pot and cook until tender, 15 to 25 minutes depending on which greens you are using. Also boil the sunchokes until tender, about 30 minutes. It would be even better to roast them - put them in a 400F? oven for about 40 minutes.",
      "Once everything is cooked, let the vegetables cool and squeeze as much water as you can from the herbs. You can peel the sunchokes or leave them whole. I prefer to keep the skins.",
      "Put all the ingredients for the filling in a food processor, and process until smooth. As for the salt and nutmeg, add a little and adjust at the end. You can taste the filling to check if you are okay with the amount of spice.\r\nPut the filling in a colander in the fridge over a bowl and leave it there overnight, or for several hours.",
      "Make the pasta: Make a well of flour on a wooden board, add a bit of water and start kneading, adding more water a little by little as you go. You should end up with a very supple ball of dough. If it seems too stiff or too dry, add more waer and re-knead.",
      "Roll it out: if you make it with a rolling pin, roll it to the desired thinness (but not too thin) and cut the sheet of pasta into 4 inch wide strips. Same Using a pasta machine makes it even easier! Make sure everything is constantly well floured. For further reference on pasta making, check out the link in the description.",
      "Take out the filling and discard any liquid. Put a teaspoonful of filling at regular intervals near the lower edge of the strips, then fold the pasta over the filling. Press to seal the edges with your fingers. To make the pockets, pinch the pasta in between the gaps, as to create a sort of 'wall' out of the strip. With a pasta wheel, cut each ravioli by dragging the wheel towards yourself. This will cause the part you pinched to fold inwards and create a sort of pocket.",
      "Lay the prepared ravioli on a floured tray, and make sure they do not overlap. You can freeze them this way and, once they're frozen, dump them in a bag. To boil them straight away, dump them in a large pot with plenty of salted boiling water until they rise to the surface, about 3 to 5 minutes.\r\nDo not throw away the pasta scraps! They are great in soups.",
      "SUGGESTIONS FOR DRESSING ~ Because these are so simple, they can be tossed with pretty much any sauce you have - especially if you are making these with potatoes instead of sunchokes. Dress them in a simple tomato sauce and extra virgin olive oil, or with pesto (again, see the links in the description for more info)."

      "FOR SALAD: 2 ways of making roasted or dehydrated Pecans - I usually use my stove top as I wait to the last minute I will be honest. When I am organized and think ahead it's not a problem :) I put in some Tamari or Braggs (approx 3 tbsp) into a pan on med - low heat and mix in Pecans, sometimes I add in Agave (approx 2 tbsp) for a little sweeter version.\r\nStir well, and let sit, stirring often until the Tamrai or Braggs starts drying - take off heat and let cool. You can cook this faster by using higher heat but you will also destroy the enzymes. Once fully cool down, add to salad. That is all I put in the salad - but don't be afraid to add in more if you like - some veggies or herbs or.........you aren't limited!!!",

Add the butter and continue stirring until melted. \r\n\r\nWhen the sauce it hot (steamy), temper the egg by pouring a small stream of the sauce into the egg. Continue whisking the egg and add a little more until all the sauce is added. (This technique will prevent the egg from turning into scrambled eggs.) \r\n\r\nPour the sauce back into the pan and cook over medium-low heat until smooth and the sauce is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. Stir in the rum and get ready for some boozy maple deliciousness!",

Lay the leaves on top of each other and roll up length ways like a cigar - then finely slice into strips.\r\nHeat a frying pan and add a glug of rapeseed or coconut oil on a medium heat. Add your chard and allow to wilt - it will only take a few minutes for it to soften.\r\nRemove from the pan and keep aside while you cook out your garlic and add in your black onion seeds and cumin to release the flavours of the spices. Add the chard back into the pan and mix everything together.\r\nIn a separate bowl add the chick pea flour and break in an egg. Next add in your cooled chard and the water (start off with 80ml water and add more if it still feels very thick) mix all together until you get a thick but not stiff batter - a reluctant dropping consistency.\r\nSeason with salt and pepper.\r\nAdd a fresh glug of oil to your pan and spoon tablespoons of your mix into your pan. Leave for a few minutes (until set on one side) and gently flip over with a palette knife or fish slice. They should be beautifully browned. Cook on the other side for a few more minutes until cooked through.\r\nServe warm with the dipping sauce as a canape or starter.",
      "For the relish...\r\nSimply place everything into a blender and blitz until a generic smoothness. Taste and season if needed\r\nThis keeps wonderfully if stored in the fridge and is delicious stired through dips such as hummus or on its own."

    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "Prepare the chicken: Using a poultry shears (or a VERY sharp, slender knife), carefully cut the chicken directly up the backbone, beginning at the tail. You want the skin to remain attached on either side of the spinal column, so it's important that the shears not slip. Grab each drumstick, one at a time, in your hand, and bend it until the joint connecting it to the thigh breaks. Open the chicken out on a chopping board, skin side-up, with the drumstick/thighs facing inward. Use the flat side of a cleaver or a mallet-or the heel of your hand-to flatten the chicken by breaking the breastbone at the wishbone. This will also break the ribcage and collarbone. Don't remove any of the broken ribs because they're attached to thin sheets of flesh that will help to hold the stuffing in place.",
      "Starting at the neck, carefully slide first your fingertips, then your hand under the skin and loosen the filaments that hold the skin to the flesh. Leave the skin attached at the top of the breast bone. Work slowly and carefully so you won't tear the skin. You will soon find that you1ve loosened the skin all the way below the knee on each side. Cut the wing tips at the second joint.",
      "Sprinkle a little olive oil on the chicken and rub it all over. Then rub the chicken on the skin side and the bone side-but not under the skin-with a mixture of sea salt and freshly ground black pepper. Let the chicken marinate while you prepare the pistou.",
      "Make the pistou: With the motor running in your food processor fitted with the metal blade, drop the garlic cloves through the feed tube and process until chopped very fine. Scrape down the garlic, then add basil and chop fine. Leaving the motor running, add the olive oil in a slow, steady stream.",
      "Shut off the motor, add the cheese, a big pinch of salt and a liberal grinding of pepper. Pulse three or four times to mix well. Scrape into a glass jar and cover until ready to use. You can prepare the pistou up to this point a day or two ahead. (You should have some pistou left over for another use when the chicken is stuffed.)",
      "Heat the oven to 450\u00b0 F. Stir the pistou into the breadcrumbs a few tablespoons at a time, until you have a stiff mixture. Using your (scrupulously clean) hands, take the pistou by handfuls and slide it under the skin, all the way down around the knees. Use half the mixture for each side of the chicken. When you have it all underneath the skin, wash your hands, then mold the pistou (from the outside) so that it assumes the shape of the chicken. With a small, sharply pointed knife, pierce the web of skin and thin flesh between the inside of the thigh and the tip of the breast, making a slit just large enough to insert the drumstick tip. Place the chicken on a rack in a shallow roasting pan just large enough to hold the spread-out bird. Sprinkle the chicken with more salt and pepper, if you like.",
      "As soon as the chicken is in the oven, reduce the temperature to 375\u00b0 F. Cover it loosely with a sheet of heavy-duty foil (shiny side-in) Roast for 1 hour and 10 minutes. After the chicken has baked for 30 minutes, begin basting it by pouring 3/4 cup cold water over the chicken. Baste with the accumulated juices every 15 minutes thereafter. After 1 hour and 10 minutes, remove the foil and raise the temperature to 450\u00b0 F and roast for an additional 20 minutes to ensure the skin is brown and crispy.",
      "Remove the chicken from the oven and allow it to rest for at least 15 minutes before carving it. Serve on a large platter surrounded by a freshly cooked green vegetable, such as broccoli and cherry tomatoes (if they're in season)-for a beautiful presentation.",
      "Teacher's Tip: If you want this dish to be kosher, omit the cheese from the pistou.",
      "Wine Tip: The wine I prefer to accompany this flavorful roast chicken is a red Cote du Rhone. Mas du Gourgonnier is a local Provencal wine from the Les Baux region that would be especially delicious."
