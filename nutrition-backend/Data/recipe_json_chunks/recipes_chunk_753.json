I like to use my food processor to make the dough. Combine flour, shortening and the 1/3 cup of milk. Process until a dough is formed. Turn out onto floured surface and work more flour into the dough, if needed, to make a firm dough. Roll to a thickness of about 1/4 inch or less. Cut into strips. Bring the liquid to a rolling boil. Drop pieces of dumpling strips into pot. Cover and reduce heat to low. Cook about 6 minutes. Remove cover and add the 1/4 cup of milk and butter. Stir until butter melts. Add the sweet potatoes back to the pan and continue cooking for another 4 to 5 minutes or until slightly thickened."
