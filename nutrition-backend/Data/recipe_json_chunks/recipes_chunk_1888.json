      "The paste is fermented by the yeast, and it grows while the dough grows.",
      "But because the rice flour has very little gluten to hold it together, it spreads apart and then gelatinizes and caramelizes when the bread is baked.",

      "Lift them out of the liquid with a slotted spoon or spider, drain, and set in a bowl to cool.",
      "Boil the cooking liquid, uncovered, until it has reduced to 1/4 cup or so of syrup; scrape it into a cup or bowl to stop the cooking.",

      "Cover the pan, and bring the liquid to a boil over medium heat, stirring frequently to make sure the sugar dissolves.",
      "Uncover, and cook at a gentle simmer for about 25 minutes, until the sauce has thickened and the cranberries are thoroughly cooked (but still have their berry shape).",
      "Let the berries and squash cool to room temperature, then fold them together gently, in a large mixing bowl, keeping the chunks intact.",
      "Fold in the apricot jam and the soft butter and finally the squash syrupor as much syrup as needed, without making the filling too loose.",
      "It should be dense enough to stay in a mound when you heap it up, with no liquid seeping out.",
      "Before you form the strudel, arrange a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 375.",
      "On a large, lightly floured work surface, roll and stretch the strudel dough into a rectangle that measures approximately 2 feet wide (left to right in front of you) and 18 inches long (from the nearest edge to the one farthest from you).",
      "Follow the strudel-stretching procedures detailed on pages 384 to 385: start by rolling the dough into a rectangular shape, then gradually stretch it with your hands until it reaches the size you want.",
      "Now you want to cover the work surface with the cloth to help you roll the strudel.",
      "The best way is to have someone else lay out the cloth while you hold the dough up in the air (or lay out the cloth on another flat surface, then transfer it).",
      "Arrange the cloth so that its front edge is aligned with the near edge of your counter (it can drape over the edge a few inches too).",
      "The cloth should extend at least 4 feet left to right and 3 feet toward the far side of the counter.",
      "When the cloth is flat and smooth, flour it lightly, then lay down the sheet of dough with its longer side left to right in front of you, parallel to the cloth.",
      "There should be 6 inches to a foot of uncovered cloth all around the dough.",
      "Brush the parchment liner of the baking sheet with about 2 tablespoons of the very soft butter; keep the baking sheet handy.",
      "Brush the surface of the doughgentlywith soft butter all over, using about 2 tablespoons in all.",
      "Stir and toss together the toasted bread crumbs, the cinnamon, and about 2 teaspoons of the sugar.",
      "Sprinkle this evenly all over the buttered dough (it keeps the layers of dough separated when the strudels rolled up).",
      "Now youre going to create a long row of the squash-cranberry filling on the dough.",
      "The row will be about 18 inches long, running left to right in front of you, about 4 inches in from the edge of the dough nearest you.",
      "The row will start about 3 inches in from the left edge of the dough and end about 3 inches from the right edge of the dough.",
      "And it will be 3 to 4 inches high and 4 or 5 inches wideleaving lots of dough to roll around it.",
      "Got that?",
      "When you have a good idea of where the filling is going, scoop the filling out in cups all along the filling line onto the dough and use your hands to push it evenly into its proper place and shape, resembling a long, plump sausage of squash chunks in cranberry jelly.",
      "Wash and dry your hands.",
      "Now the rolling begins.",
      "Grasp the edge of the cloth nearest you, at the points close to the left and right corners of the dough.",
      "It is a good idea to have someone help you, at least the first time, so each of you can take a side.",
      "Lift the cloth, bringing the 4-inch margin of uncovered dough up and against the row of filling.",
      "Roll the cloth into your fists, so your hands are close to the dough and in better control; with your knuckles tight in a fist facing the filling, lift and push your hands, with cloth in them, forward, so the whole row of filling rolls over at the same timeand gets wrapped snugly in dough.",
      "Keep gathering the cloth in your hands, holding it close to the strudel.",
      "Pull the cloth up gently as the strudel rolls over several more times, wrapping more dough around the filling, until youve created a long neat log.",
      "Get ready to roll the strudel right onto the baking sheet.",
      "First, make sure the seam of the dough is on top, so it will be on the bottom when you roll it onto the sheet: use the cloth to roll it seam up.",
      "Next, place the wide edge of the baking sheet against the strudel and lift the far side of the pan so it looks like youre going to roll the log up a steep rampget someone to help you hold the sheet.",
      "Using the cloth, give the strudel a final forceful roll so it goes over the rim and onto the buttered parchment liner, seam down, on the near side of the baking sheet.",
      "The empty ends of the strudel dough are probably flopping off the sides of the pan.",
      "Twist these flaps (several dough layers thick) so they are snug against the ends of the filling and cut them off, leaving just an inch or two of twisted dough sticking out of the strudel.",
      "Tuck them under the strudel log.",
      "Form the strudel into a horseshoe shape, carefully curving each end in on the baking sheet.",
      "Brush the strudel dough with the remaining soft butter all over.",
      "Cut 1/2-inch slits for steam vents all over the top of the pastry: plunge the tip of a sharp, thin-bladed knife straight down into the strudel, making sure it pierces through the layers of dough.",
      "Finally, sprinkle the remaining teaspoon of sugar all over the top of the strudel.",
      "Bake the strudel for approximately 45 minutes, rotating the pan front to back once or twice, for even baking.",
      "The strudel should be deeply browned, with the juices of the filling bubbling out of the slits.",
      "If you want, brush any fruity juices in the baking pan on the strudel dough.",
      "You can also glaze the strudel with softened apricot jam, but wait until the pastry has cooled a bit.",
      "Glazing the hot strudel will cause the dough to lose all its crispness; glazing later on will soften it less.",
      "(I like crisp, flaky dough, so I dont glaze at all.)",
      "Let the strudel cool on the pan briefly, then use a wide metal spatula to separate it from the sticky, caramelized juices on the parchment sheet.",
      "Use two spatulasand a helping handto lift up the strudel in one piece and transfer it to a cutting board or platter.",
      "Or just slice the strudel right in the baking pan and serve on individual dessert plates.",
      "Serve slices of the strudel warm or at room temperaturewith cream, whipped cream, or ice cream, if you like."

      "Wash the bracken fern thoroughly and trim off 1-2 cm of the stems (I often find the cut surface of store-bought fresh bracken fern stems to be blackened by the astringency).",
      "Sprinkle baking soda on a plate, hold the tips of the bracken fern, and dunk the stems into the baking soda (the stems will be sticky, so the baking soda should easily stick).",
      "Put the bracken fern into a bowl large enough to contain them, sprinkle on a pinch of baking soda, and pour boiling water over them until they are immersed (bubbles should form from the stems).",
      "Cover with a plate so that the bracken fern will not float to the top and let sit overnight to remove the astringency.",
      "This is what they should look like the following day (after about 8 hours).",
      "The astringency should be removed from the bracken fern and the color of the water should be dark green.",
      "Rinse the bracken fern and soak it in fresh clean water.",
      "If the water still becomes cloudy, drain and refresh the water until it becomes clear.",
      "Since the bracken fern is not boiled, if you are making ohitashi (blanched vegetables with soy sauce or something similar), blanch it before using.",
      "The bracken fern will keep for 4 to 5 days, as long as you refresh the water everyday and store it in the refrigerator."

      "With a very sharp butcher knife, score (i.e., make shallow cuts in the meat) along each side of the spine of the hog, where the ribs connect.",
      "Then crack and pull down each side of the hog, starting from the spine.",
      "You want the hog to be lying semi-flat so that you can easily reach inside.",
      "Following the instructions on page 76, remove the membrane (or silver) from the backs of the ribs on each side.",
      "Trim away any excess fat on the hams, shoulders, and along the rib cage.",
      "Using a meat saw, split and saw down between the ribs and down each side of the hog: Youre going to cut the ribs on both sides three inches off the spine.",
      "This is basically making baby back ribs out of the full spares.",
      "Saw only the bone, trying not to pierce the skin on the bottom of the hog.",
      "(This makes it easier, after cooking, to serve ribs from the hog.)",
      "Separate the picnic ham of the shoulder from the Boston butt.",
      "Again, trim both hams of any excess fat.",
      "When prepping the shoulder, there is a membrane that you can feel with a knife that separates the Boston butt end, which is next to the spine, from the picnic ham (or shank).",
      "Cut through the membrane, making sure not to cut through the skin.",
      "This lays the shoulder so it can crust over and have a good bark.",
      "Load the hog injection into your injector.",
      "Out of habit, I always start by injecting the hams first and then I work my way to the head.",
      "I inject in seven locations all over the ham, making sure the ham is full to the point of popping.",
      "It doesnt matter where exactly you inject so long as its all over the hog.",
      "A word of caution: Dont make more injection holes than necessary, because more holes means more places for the marinade to leak out.",
      "Move to the sides of the cavity where the bacon is.",
      "It will be covered by the ribs.",
      "Inject all along both sides.",
      "There are two tenderloins at the end of the spine near the hams.",
      "Inject them carefully and do not over-inject (or shoot too much fluid in); if the fluid begins leaking out, youll know that youve done more than enough.",
      "Then move to the shortened ribs that have been cut and inject straight down between the ribs directly against the spine into the loin.",
      "Remember not to push the needle through the skin on the bottom of the hogs back.",
      "Now inject the shoulder, butt, and shank (picnic ham).",
      "Last, inject the cheek meat (or jowl) along the hogs jawbone.",
      "Sprinkle the rub throughout the cavity and on the surface of any exposed meat.",
      "(Some people think you have to actually rub the rub into the meat, but I dont think that does anything to the taste.)",
      "Gather up the foil youve laid the hog on and use it to wrap the entire hog loosely.",
      "Let the hog sit for 1 hour to soak up all the injection.",
      "During this time, light the smoker and bring it to 250 F.",
      "Place the 2 shoulders or brisket flats in the smoker, and then carefully place the hog on top of the shoulders/brisket, so that the extra meat runs the length of the hog directly under the center.",
      "Close the smoker and let the hog smoke for about 20 hours, or until the internal temperature of the meatiest part of the shoulder is 205 F. (I often set my hog on the smoker at noon the day before I want to eat it; then I remove it at 8 a.m. the next morning.)",
      "Unwrap the foil, and using a brush, apply the hog glaze throughout the inside of the cavity and on the hams.",
      "Rewrap the hog loosely in the foil.",
      "Leaving the hog on the smoker, let the temperature fall (no more wood is needed at this point).",
      "The glaze will caramelize and set while the hog begins to rest and cool down enough so that folks can start pulling the meat.",
      "(Unless youre a professional caterer or otherwise need to present the whole hog, the hog is left in the smoker while it is picked and pulled and, best of all, eaten.)",
      "In true Southern tradition, a whole hog is never carved per se.",
      "Wearing clean heavy-duty gloves and using either large tongs or your hands, gently pull the meat out of the hog in chunks and pile it onto large trays or straight onto plates.",
      "Now, the most difficult part of cooking the whole hog properly is the loin, which tends to cook faster than the tougher, bigger, and denser hams and shoulders.",
      "I solve this problem by placing a cheaper cut of meat, such as a boneless butt or brisket flat, underneath the hog down the length of the backbone.",
      "This will add another barrier between the loin and the heat from the smoker, helping to keep it moist and not overcooked.",
      "Thats why this recipe calls for adding two shoulders or brisket flats: it will keep your loin from overcooking.",
      "And the type of meat you choose wont matter, as it wont be fit for a buzzard when youre through cooking the hog."

      "Stir for 4 to 5 minutes, about 200 strokes.",

      "If you are unsure, keep stirring for a little longer.",
      "Gather the finished dough together; it should hold a slightly mounded shape for a few minutes before spreading out to touch the walls of the bowl.",
      "Cover with plastic wrap and set aside at room temperature for 3 to 4 hours, or refrigerate overnight and return to room temperature before using.",
      "Alternatively, use a mixer fitted with the dough hook attachment.",

      "Place next to the stove.",
      "Preheat a large, heavy-bottomed nonstick skillet to medium-low and then lower the heat slightly.",

      "Adjusting the flame is tricky, and I use a standard burner for these skins.",
      "If you have a high-output burner or stove, it may be necessary to use a flame tamer to diffuse the heat and/or to remove the skillet from the heat in between skins.",
      "Because slightly chilled dough is firmer and easier to manipulate into a thin film, put the bowl containing the dough in a larger bowl in which you have put 8 ice cubes (without water).",

      "To make a skin, gently press the dough onto the skillet and slowly wipe it in a circular motion.",

      "It does not need to be perfect and a tiny hole now and then is forgivable.",
      "After forming the skin, you can keep the dough in your hand, but I like to let it drip back down into the chilled bowl to firm up; it takes seconds to retrieve and work it for the next one.",
      "Should the dough get cold, warm it up by working it with the rotating wrist motion before making another skin.",
      "After about 15 seconds, part of the lacy edge should dry out and lift off the skillet, the sign of doneness.",
      "Use your fingers to peel the skin from the skillet.",
      "You do not have to cook the other side.",
      "Place the finished skin, uncooked side down, on the plate and cover with the damp kitchen towel, which will soften the edges.",
      "Make more skins from the remaining dough, adjusting the heat as needed and stacking one on top of the other.",
      "As you get toward the end, the skins will get smaller as theres less dough to work with.",
      "Try spiraling the dough from the center outward to create decent-size skins.",
      "Its hard to use up all the dough so discard the last bit.",
      "Remove the finished skins from the plate, wrap them in a double-folded kitchen towel, and slide them into a zip-top plastic bag.",
      "Keep at room temperature if you are going to be using them right away.",
      "The skins can be refrigerated for up to 5 days; for less bulk, wrap them in parchment paper.",
      "Before using, return them to room temperature.",
      "Over low heat, steam stacks of 10 skins at a time in a kitchen towel for 10 minutes to soften them.",
      "Once refreshed, keep them soft in the warm steamer as you work.",
      "Shanghai spring roll skins, often labeled spring roll skins or lumpia skins, are stocked in the frozen section at Chinese and Southeast Asian markets.",

      "Thaw them before using and separate them one by one, restacking them and covering them with a damp kitchen towel to prevent drying, just as if you made them fresh.",
      "If they are dry, apply the steaming method outlined in step 4 to revitalize and soften them.",
      "When filling a square spring roll skin, position it as a diamond with a corner pointing toward you.",
