Then add them directly to the stock musli (2 ounces). Spelt, rye and millet germ are difficult to get. You can omit them, but they have a very special taste. Therefore I add them on a daily basis. Spelt is nutty, millet is crisp and rye has a flavor of bread. As dried fruit use whatever you like, take this as a suggestion. You could combine the daily additions.",
      "NOTE on Thorsten's Musli: This Musli can be varied. You can reduce the number of different grains or omit one or the other ingredient. But then it would not be Thorsten's Musli. Then it is your own Musli. You'll have to find your way and taste. I created this Musli to combine as much as possible different resources for carbohydrates, dietary fibres, minerals, vitamins or proteins. I use no additional sweetening, except that of the dried fruits, because I like the natural sweetness and taste of the different cereals, seeds and fruits. If you like some additional sweetening, use a mild honey (e.g. clover). I eat this Musli every day 'very slowly' with a teaspoon and a glass of orange juice or water. This note is rather long, sorry, I just wanted to share some of my ideas and this recipe (or my ideas on a healthy and tasty granola respectively)."

      "Ask the butcher to split a few marrowbones lengthwise and extract the marrow For you. Have the beef, pork and veal ground together in front of you, for unless you see it you cannot be sure that it will be free of fat.",
      "So that they can be chilled, prepare the meat balls at least an hour before you plan to cook them. They are less likely then to crumble and lose their shape when they are fried.",
      "Soak the crumbs in the four Tab. of cream for 5 minutes, then put them in a large mixing bowl with the marrow and ground meats.",
      "Melt the 2 T. butter in a small frying pan and in it cook the chopped onion, shallots and garlic over Moderate heat for 5 min.,or until softened and color lightly. Add them to the mixing bowl and at the same time add the grated lemon rind, parsley, salt, pepper, and thyme.",
      "Beat the 2 eggs lightly with a fork and pour them over the meat. With a large spoon, beat this mixture vigorously until the ingredients are thoroughly combined and the meat loses its granular texture. If you own an electric mixer with a dough hook attachment, the beating operation will be much easier. But do not attempt to use an ordinary beater attachment; it will not work.",
      "Form into small balls, about an inch in diameter. The simplest and most efficient way to do this is to place a heaping teaspoon of the meat in the palm of of one hand and after moistening the other hand with cold water, roll it lightly over the meat until you have shaped it into a sphere. Do not fuss with this too much; when the balls are chilled, you can reshape them easily if you wish.",
      "Place the meat balls, as you finish them, on a baking sheet or platter lined with wax paper. Cover them with another sheet of waxed paper, and chill for at least an hour. For more firmly crusted meatballs, roll each lightly in flour just before frying them.",
      "When you are ready to cook the meatballs, melt the 3 Tab. butter and 2 Tab. oil over high heat in a large heavy frying pan. When the fat begins to sputter, lightly drop into the pan enough meat balls to cover the bottom about three quarters full. At once slide the pan back and forth over the burner so that they roll around in the hot fat; this will help them to keep their shapes and to brown evenly.",
      "After a couple of minutes, turn the heat down to moderate, and cook the balls 6-7 minutes longer, or until they are crisp brown all over and cooked through. Make sure by breaking one open; there should not be the slightest indication of pink in the center. With a slotted spoon, transfer the finished meatballs to a shallow casserole and continue with the remaining meatballs until they are all cooked.",
      "Make the sauce in the same frying pan. If the fat remaining in it is a good deep brown; pour off all but 3 Tab. of it. If, however, it is black and badly burned, scrape it all out and in its place melt 3 T. butter.",
      "Off the heat, with a wooden spoon, stir into the pan 2 Tab of flour and mix it to a smooth paste with the fat. Return the pan to a low heat and cook this roux slowly for a minute of so, stirring all the while. Then pour in, all at once, the cup of stock. Raise the heat to moderate and, with a wire whisk, beat this sauce together until it boils, thickens and becomes quite smooth. Then turn the heat down to the barest simmer. Still using the whisk, stir the sour cream into the sauce, about a Tab. at a time. Use more than 1/2 cup if you like the sauce fairly thin. At the last, add the fresh dill, lemon juice, salt to taste and cayenne. Pour the sauce over the meatballs in the casserole.",
      "When you are ready to serve them, reheat the meatballs slowly without letting the sauce boil.",
      "Serve them directly from the casserole, sprinkled with a little extra fresh dill if you have it. Buttered rice, noodles or pasta of any kind go well with this.",
      "Note: If you are unable to get any marrow, in its place beat into the meat ball mixture 3 tab. soft butter."

Next, add garlic - continue to stir all and cook another 1-2 minutes longer to allow garlic to penetrate the oil and flavor to develop.",
      "Next add the prepared marinara sauce, chopped tomato, and can of crushed tomatoes, stir well and begin to add all dry seasonings. Continue to stir and allow sauce to begin bubbling. After sauce begins to bubble, stir in the red wine and add your Bay leaf. Next, add the shredded cooked chicken as well as the diced portobello, squash, & olives. Stir well and add the 1/2 teaspoon sugar, (this will help cut the acidity of the tomatoes and bring all flavors together nicely). Cover, and allow to cook for 10 minutes on simmer. You may want to check the consistency of the sauce to ensure it is not too thick, if so - add about 1/2 cup of water, though do so gradually and stir after each addition - you may or may not need that much water. If your sauce looks too thin, just take the lid off while the sauce is cooking on simmer to allow moisture to evaporate naturally. Of course the seasoned italian cook, (or chef) knows to taste the sauce to see if it is missing something, which you can then add what you think is missing. Salt & pepper to taste. Sauce can be left on Simmer for up to 30 minutes, as long as you check frequently and stir to ensure the bottom is not scorching. Serve with your favorite Al Dente Pasta, a good crusty bread (our favorite is Ciabatta), and of course use the best pecorino romano or locatelli cheese you can find & a glass of your favorite wine."

      "Cook's Notes:.",
      "These homemade bars are very economical, and you get to select all the ingredients according to your own standards, needs, and taste. For nondairy bars, replace the yogurt with unsweetened applesauce, canned pumpkin, or mashed banana. (Or try the silken tofu option in the Protein Boosters box.) Add an extra pinch of salt if using pumpkin or silken tofu. The range of sugar allows you to make these bars sweeter or not, according to your taste."

      "you'll first want to wash and trim the jalapeno peppers.Chop the stem off and slice the pepper lengthwise to expose the seeds and vein. Using a spoon, scrape out the white vein and rinse under water to wash away the seeds. The cream cheese will ultimately counteract the burn from the peppers, so leave a good amount of the inner membrane in tact if you want to feel the heat.",
      "In a mixing bowl, combine the cream cheese, paprika and cayenne pepper. Using a butter knife, or a pastry bag, fill each jalapeno half with a generous portion of the cream cheese mixture.",
      "Top each one of the jalapeno \"boats\" with a little smokey.",
      "Wrap each of the smokey topped jalapenos with a half slice of bacon, making sure that the seam is directly on top of the little smokey. Secure the wrap by inserting a toothpick straight down through the overlapping edges of the bacon all the way through the little smokey. Stop just short of going through the pepper though, that way the cream cheese doesn't leak out through the hole.",
      "Since bacon already contains a good amount of sodium, you'll want to season the buffalo poppers with a sugar based rub. A nice blend of brown sugar and cayenne pepper works great on these bad boys as well.",
      "Cooking the poppers is a matter of getting the bacon done to your liking. My preference is smoke at 250 degrees for about an hour and a half. At this point the bacon isn't overly crispy, but it's definitely cooked enough to be bite through. If you prefer a crispier bacon, then I'd suggest kicking the temperature up to 300 degrees for about an hour. You'll want to keep a close eye on the peppers though. If they overcook, then they'll loose their stability and your poppers will spill out all over your smoker.",
      "once your poppers are cooked to your liking, remove them from the grill to cool down a bit before serving. At this point I would typically top them with a generous helping of Barbecue Sauce cut with a little cran-apple juice, but this time around I happened to have a bottle of hot raspberry sauce. I used this sauce a few weeks ago on some pulled pork sandwiches and was pleasantly surprised as to how well the raspberry flavor melded with the smoked pork, but this blew the sandwich out of the water. The flavor of the smokey jalapeno matches perfectly with the sweet fruity sauce, and of course it's heat is in good company with the medley of peppers tasted in each bite. A spoonful of sauce on each popper and you can guarantee these tasty treats will disappear in no time flat!"

    "directions": [
      "Preheat the oven to 325\u00b0F.",
      "Beginning with a large saucepan or braising pan with a lid, heat the tablespoon of grapeseed oil over medium-high heat. Season the short ribs with salt and pepper. Sear the short ribs on either side until caramelized and golden brown, about 5 minutes. Remove the meat from the pan. Add the carrot and celery to the pan and cook for 5 minutes over the same heat. Add the onion and garlic. Cook together until caramelized, about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally as needed. Add the short ribs back to the pan and deglaze with the red wine. Add the sachet (see below) and, stirring from time to time, allow the wine to reduce until almost evaporated, about 6 minutes. Pour in the beef broth and bring the braise up to a boil. Put the lid on and place in the oven for 2 hours. Stir occasionally.",
      "After the first 2 hours of cooking time, remove the lid. For the next hour, baste the short ribs every 15 minutes, leaving the lid off. Cook for an additional hour, until very tender, for a total of 4 hours cooking time.",
      "Pull the short ribs from the oven and allow them to cool in the braising juices for at least a few hours. Carefully transfer the meat to a plate and strain the juices through a fine sieve, then allow the fat to rise. Remove the fat. Using a dinner fork in each hand, lightly shred the meat along the natural grains in a pulling motion from the center outward, and set aside.",
      "To prepare each sandwich, begin by preheating the oven to 350\u00b0.",
      "Take two slices of bread. On the bottom slice, place a layer of cheese (you'll want approximately 1 1/2 ounces for each sandwich, just enough to cover the bread to the edges), then top with 1 teaspoon of Pickled Red Onion, spread to the sides. Place 1/4 cup of the pulled short ribs on top, add another layer of cheese, and top with the second slice of bread. Brush each completed sandwich on top and bottom with 1/2 teaspoon butter.",
      "In a cast-iron pan over medium-high heat, add 1 teaspoon of the grapeseed oil and allow it to get nice and hot. Place 2 sandwiches in at a time and flip so they will absorb the oil on both sides. Weight them down with a small saute pan. After 1 minute, flip the sandwiches, return the weight, and place directly in the oven. After 2 minutes, remove the weight. Flip the sandwich one final time, and cook for 1 final minute. Pull from the oven, slice diagonally, and serve immediately. Repeat with the remaining sandwiches.",
      "For the Sachet/Bouquet Garni.",
      "For the sachet, wrap the parsley, thyme, bay leaves, and peppercorns in a small amount of cheesecloth and tie with butcher's twine."

This is done so all sugar and salt crystals are dissolved and none get back in the mixture. Turn heat down and let boil gently with out a lid for 5 minutes stirring constantly.",
      "When 5 minutes are up remove from heat and stir in baking soda. Syrup will foam but this is normal. Stir until baking soda is completely dissolved. Add butter flavoring and stir. Pour over popcorn slowly stirring popcorn constantly, coating all the popcorn gently. When popcorn is coated, pour almonds in and stir well. Place in a preheated oven at 225 degrees for 1 hour. Popcorn needs to be stirred and mixed through every 15 minutes. When popcorn is finished baking pour onto a non-stick service and let cool."
