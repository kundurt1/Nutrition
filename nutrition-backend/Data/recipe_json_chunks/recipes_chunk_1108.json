You don't want it crisp as you will be adding it directly to the burger meat. Remove the bacon to a plate lined with a paper to drain. Then in the same pan, drain all the bacon drippings and add the onion and garlic and cook just a minute, this will soften them up a bit.",
      "In a large bowl, add the egg (beaten well), worcestershire, dijon mustard, pinch of salt (about 1/2 teaspoon) and pepper (about 1/4 teaspoon), the onion and garlic mix, bacon, bread crumbs, parsley, and mix well. Lastly, add in the turkey and mix lightly to combine. Over mixing the turkey can cause the burger to become tough. Make 4 large patties and place on a small cookie sheet lined with parchment or foil and freeze for 15-20 minutes. Freezing them slightly makes it easier to cook.",
      "Onions -- As your burgers are in the freezer, saute the onions. Use that same pan you cooked the bacon, onion and garlic. The same flavors are fine for this. Add the butter, onions, salt and pepper and bring to medium heat and sweat (cook) the onions without browning until they are soft and translucent. They will take around 10 minutes. When they are done, turn off the heat and set to the side. The onions can also be done the day or night before and then reheated in the microwave in just seconds.",
      "Tomatoes -- You can use slices, but I just like them chopped for this burger. To me it just works best and is just as easy to prepare. Cut in half and lightly squeeze over your sink, and most of the seeds and juice will come right out. Then chop and set to the side in a small bowl as you cook your burgers.",
      "Texas Toast -- As the burgers cook prepare your Texas toast according to directions. My brand takes approximately 15 minutes in the oven, so I start that before I start to cook the burgers.",
      "Burgers -- I add butter to either a saute or grill pan and bring to medium high heat. Add the chilled (but not frozen) burgers) and cook approximately 5-6 minutes per side. It is turkey, so you want the burger completely done. Remember make sure you get a nice crust on the first side before you flip the burger.",

      "Bring 4 quarts of water to a boil in a large pot, add 1 tbs of salt, and drop in the pasta all at once, stirring until the strands are submerged. If you have a smaller pot, you can use less than 4 quarts of water, but you must constantly stir the spaghetti for one minute.",
      "When the pasta is almost done, return the skillet with the sauce to a medium heat, adding the oregano, capers, and olives. Simmer 3-5 more mins, no more. Cooking too long after capers and olives have been added will make sauce taste less fresh and more salty. (Trust me.).",
      "When the pasta is cooked al dente, drain and toss with 1/2 cup of the sauce, to pre-flavour it and prevent it from sticking. Ladle pasta into serving dishes, taste sauce for salt, pour sauce over each serving bowl and serve at once.",
