      "Divide the 1/2 gallon of milk into two saucepans and heat one to barely warm, the other to really warm, but not scalding. Do not heat the other 1-2 cups of milk - that is for thinning the batter later, and only if necessary.",
      "Melt 1/2 of one stick (1/4 cup) of the butter in the microwave for about 30 seconds, or more if needed.",
      "In the large bowl of a stand mixer, add eggs and mix on low speed while slowly adding the barely warm milk. Add salt, sugar and the 1/2 stick of melted butter.",
      "Add the flour and remaining hot milk alternately in thirds. Batter is somewhat complete, but must 'rest' covered in refrigerator for a minimum of 1 hour, or even overnight.",
      "Before making crepes, melt the remainder of the 1st stick of butter and set aside.",
      "Pull the batter out of the refrigerator and let it sit out to come almost to room temperature. Mix in only 2 tablespoons of the melted butter. Blend batter thoroughly to blend the thicker batter that has settled to the bottom. There will be some melted butter floating on top. Leave a large spoon or whisk in your batter to continually mix after you make every few crepes.",
      "Heat 12\" non-stick pan/s heated thoroughly to medium - that will yield 9\" crepes. Slightly coat the pan either with a tiny bit of the melted butter or vegetable spray. Holding the pan handle with one hand, pour in 1/4 - 1/3 cup of batter - rotate the pan around in a swirling motion to completely cover the bottom of the pan with a thin layer of batter, then place pan back on th burner to cook. If batter is too thick to make a sort-of thin crepe, use some of the additional milk to thin it out. Do not make it too thin. There will be some \"drip mark, hills and valleys\" as the first batter poured cooks before you get the rest of the batter into the pan. That is fine and will add to the overall beauty of your crepe.",
      "Watching closely, after the top of the batter is set, use a spatula to lift and peek under an edge of the crepe to make sure there are some nicely tanned areas, then gently flip your crepe over to get color on the other side. These colored areas provide most of the flavor so your crepes don't taste like cooked milk and flour.",
      "When the crepe has finished obtaining wonderful color on the 2nd side, flip it directly onto a clean tea towel to cool. You may spread out 2 or 3 tea towels. As the subsequent crepes are added to the towels, the first will have cooled and can be stacked onto a platter. As you use your 'batch' of batter, add more of the melted butter slowly when you notice the floating droplets of butter have disappeared from your pan. This adds flavor as well as helps them not stick.",
      "To prepare for baking, preheat oven to 350 degrees F.",
      "Roll up the crepes like little burritos - folding 1/4 of the top down, then two sides in and finish rolling. I prefer fatter rolled crepes so sometimes I roll two together. Line your rolled crepes up in a single layer in glass baking dishes or roasting pans with high sides that have been sprayed with vegetable spray. (At this point the crepes can be covered with foil and refrigerated or frozen for one or two days.)",
      "When you are ready to prepare: Cut the 2nd stick of butter into small pieces and evenly lay them over the top of your crepes. Pour enough half and half in to almost cover the crepes, but not completely.",
      "Bake uncovered for about 45 minutes, until you see that the liquid is bubbling in all areas of your pan. These items are already cooked, so they only need to be heated throughout completely.",
      "The crepes are wonderful just as they are, but we traditionally serve them with sour cream, and defrosted frozen strawberries."

      "Scald 1/2 a cup of the milk (basically heat it until just before boiling point - don't worry if it does reach boiling point - it will still be okay to use), pour the hot milk back into your measuring cup, and top it off with the remaining milk to make a full cup. The milk should be lukewarm at this point - if it is too hot, set it aside for a minute or two, or pour a bit of warm milk out of the cup and top it back up to a full cup with cold milk.",
      "Add the lukewarm milk to the dry ingredients and mix together. Knead for a minute or so in the bowl (don't be surprised if it is very sticky), and then cover with a clean, damp tea-towel and leave somewhere warm to rise until the dough has at least doubled in volume. This may take up to an hour, depending on how warm it is wherever you leave the bowl.",
      "When the dough has risen, tip it onto a lightly floured, clean surface, and knead it for four or five minutes. When you've finished kneading the dough, roll it out into a long rectangle (you might need to lightly flour the surface again, as well as the rolling pin). It doesn't matter how long the rectangle is, but it should be about 20 cm wide (a bit more than that is fine) and half a cm thick. It doesn't matter if it isn't a perfect rectangle - just aim for a minimum width of 20 cm.",
      "Generously brush the top of the rolled out dough with the melted butter or margarine (you probably won't need all of it).",
      "Put the chopped fruit onto a couple of pieces of scrunched-up kitchen towel to absorb some of the juice, and then evenly spread the chopped apples and plums across the top of the dough. Leave about an inch of the dough uncovered (at the bottom of the rectangle), to ensure that it will stick together nicely when you roll it.",
      "Carefully, and tightly, roll the dough along its length. Work lengthwise, starting with the end opposite the border that you left without fruit. The easiest way to do this is, using both hands, to roll it just a little way, starting from one end and working to the other end, before going back to the first end and rolling it another little bit across its length. As you get to the end of the dough with the border without fruit, push any stray bits of fruit into the inside of the roll with your thumbs as you finish rolling. When you've finished, the final product will look a bit like a long sausage roll that you've not yet cut into little sausage rolls. Next, cut off the jagged ends of the long roll, and then cut the roll into evenly-sized smaller rolls. I cut 10 rolls from my long roll, but the number you get will depend on how wide you cut them.",
      "Carefully put the rolls into a greased pan (grease the sides and the bottom of the pan), with one of the open-sides of the roll face down. I used a 9-inch diameter round cake tin for all 10 rolls and the two end pieces (no point in wasting them!). You might need to push each roll downwards slightly as you put it into the tin so that it doesn't fall over. Leave at least a centimetre between each roll.",
      "Cover the pan with a clean, damp tea towel again and leave to rise for a second time. When the rolls have risen, pre-heat the oven to gas mark 5 (190\u00b0 C or 375\u00b0 F) and then bake in the middle of the oven for about half an hour, or until golden brown on top. When the rolls have baked, take them out the oven and immediately sprinkle them with icing sugar (or a glaze if you prefer), before setting aside to cool. Cooling in the tin should be fine."

      "3.\tRemove tea bags from the butter, and squeeze them well to release all butter from the bags.",
      "4.\tLet butter cool to room temperature. Butter will re-solidify, but remain soft. Stir the softened butter before using.",

      "Notes:",
      "- This makes a soft consistency frosting.",
      "- For a stiff decorator frosting: add more powdered sugar, 1/2 cup at a time, until desired consistency is reached. Be aware that more powdered sugar will dilute the tea flavor of the frosting."

Crumble one-third of the chocolate filling evenly over dough, leaving about a 1/2-inch border on the long sides. Roll up dough lengthwise into a tight log, pinching ends together to seal. Twist dough evenly down the length of the log, a full five or six times. Brush the top of the log with egg wash. Crumble 2 tablespoons of filling down the center of the log, being careful not to let mixture slide off. Bend log in half into a horseshoe shape, then cross the right half over the left and pinch ends together to seal and form a figure eight. Twist it two more times, and fit into a prepared pan.

Add the vanilla and the eggs and whisk until smooth. Add the flour and stir with a rubber spatula until blended. Scrape the batter into the baking pan and smooth out evenly. Bake for about 20 minutes. The top should be shiny and dry looking, but the brownie should not be completely baked. Set on a wire rack.",
      "While the brownie layer is baking, start the macadamia layer. Combine the brown sugar and flour in a large mixing bowl. Whisk until combined, using your fingers to break up any large clumps. Add the melted butter, corn syrup, and vanilla. Whisk until blended, about a minute. Add the eggs and then whisk until combined. Don't over mix or the batter will be foamy. Add the nuts and coconut and stir with a rubber spatula until evenly blended. Pour the macadamia mix over the warm, partially baked brownie layer. Carefully spread the mix into an even layer. Return the pan to the oven and bake an additional 35-40 minutes, until the top is golden brown. Transfer the pan to a wire rack and cool completely. Using the foil overhang as handles, lift the brownies from the pan and invert onto a work surface. Carefully peel away the foil. Flip right side up and cut into desire shapes."

Next, pour the strawberry mix gently on top of the pistachio layer. Smooth the top and freeze until firm, again, about 45 minutes. Finally pour vanilla mix over strawberry layer, smooth the top and cover loosely with plastic wrap and freeze for about 4 hours, till firm.",

No matter how careful you are in smoothing the plastic in the mold, the edges of the semifreddo may have wrinkles and dents. Using a knife, just trim the wrinkles off by cutting a thin slice from all 4 sides. Place on a chilled plate and slice."

This lets the gluten relax, so you'll have a more tender and airy pancake, and the leavening agents do their thing. (If pressed for time, you can use it right away.)",
      "Preheat an electric griddle or heat a non-stick pan over medium high heat. When a small drop of water sizzles and skips across the cooking surface, the pan is ready. Spray lightly with cooking spray. For each pancake, place a scant 1/2 cup of batter onto the griddle surface or non-stick pan. When bubbles appear across the surface of the pancake and the batter begins to look slightly dry, flip the pancake and cook for a few moments longer on the second side. If the pancakes appear to be browning too quickly, turn down the heat.",

      "Cooks note: In most recipes you can substitute milk and lemon juice (1 cup milk plus 1 tablespoon lemon juice, let sit for 5 minutes) for buttermilk, but not in this recipe. I have never had good results with it."

Place pan on a middle rack in the preheated oven and bake for approximately 30 minutes, stirring halfway through cooking time. Remove pan and stir the fruit once more. At this point the fruit can be left on the pan to cool or it can be transferred to a plate or bowl for cooling. I chose to transfer the fruit to a plate for quicker cooling.",

We ate some of the ice cream after only three hours in the freezer, but it was pretty much the consistency of a thickened milk shake at that point. No problem, it tasted great. Know, however, that if you want to have firmer, scoopable ice cream, it takes several hours to achieve a solid consistency.",

      "Make the cookies:",
      "1. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Lightly grease a baking sheet and set aside (or use parchment paper).",
      "2. Cream the butter, sugar, molasses, and eggs in a large bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment.",
      "3. Add the salt, flour, and baking powder to the creamed mixture. Add the cinnamon and oats. Mix well.",
      "4. In a small dish, add the baking soda to the boiling water, and then stir the mixture into the rest of the batter. Mix well.",
      "5. Drop by the tablespoon (important to measure for uniformity so the cookies pair well to make the pies) onto the baking sheets about 2 inches apart and bake just until the cookies first turn golden in the center, about 8-10 minutes. Keep a close eye on the first batch - this change happens quickly and the cookies need to be pulled out at the exact moment the center darkens. The center will continue cooking until set for a minute or so after pulling from the oven.",
      "6. Let the cookies cool on the pan for a few minutes before removing to a cooling rack. If you don't wait, the cookies will scrunch up and lose their shape.",
      "7. Beware of too little flour in the batter - this will cause the middle of the cookies to be too thin and the bubbles will create holes that will allow the filling to seep through.",
      "Make the filling:",
      "1. In a small measuring cup, slowly sprinkle the gelatin over 1/3 cup cold water while stirring. Let stand, stirring once or twice until the gelatin softens, about 5 minutes.",
      "2. In a heavy 2-quart saucepan over medium-high heat, stir together the granulated sugar, corn syrup, and 1/4 cup hot water until everything dissolves and the mixture is well-blended. Continuing to stir, raise the heat to high and bring to a full boil. Continue boiling for 30 seconds. Immediately remove from the heat. Stir in the gelatin mixture until it dissolves completely.",
      "3. Transfer the mixture to a large bowl or a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. Add the vanilla.",
      "4. With the mixer on medium speed, beat for 20 seconds. Gradually raise the speed to high and beat until the mixture is stiffened, white, very fluffy, and cooled to barely warm, about 5 minutes.",
      "5. Reduce the mixer speed to low and gradually add the powdered sugar.",
      "6. Add the shortening and beat until completely smooth.",
      "7. The filling will set up as it sits, so wait until it is thick enough to spread or pipe before filling the cookies.",
      "8. Pair up the cookies with another of comparable size and shape.",
      "9. Even if you don't have piping bags, it's easiest to pipe the filling so fill a Ziploc bag and snip off a corner to use as a piping bag. Put the filling into the bag and pipe onto the bottom of one of the cookie pairs in a circle spiraling outward, leaving room around the edges to smoosh the cookie pairs together. Add another cookie and sandwich the filling in. Enjoy!"

      "2. Once the water is boiling, add in the potatoes. A great tip is to keep the sliced potatoes in a bowl of cold water to keep them from turning brown. Cook the potatoes for about 8 minutes until they are just beginning to get tender.",
      "3. While the potatoes are cooking, make the cream sauce. Melt the butter in a saucepan over medium heat and stir in the flour with a wooden spoon to make a paste. Cook, stirring, until the paste puffs slightly and begins to bubble (should only take a minute or so). Gradually whisk in both milks and simmer, whisking constantly for 5 minutes or until the mixture begins to thicken.",
      "4. Take the cream sauce mixture off the heat and whisk in pepper and salt. I know this seems like a lot of salt, but you need to be generous with your salt in order to really bring out the flavor of the potatoes. Add in the nutmeg and stir well to combine. The potatoes should be done, so drain them and return them to the pot.",
      "5. Pour the cream sauce over the potatoes, tossing gently to combine before transferring the mixture to the prepared baking dish. Shred your cheese and sprinkle it generously over the potatoes.",
      "6. Pop the potatoes in the oven and bake for about 10 minutes. Then take the dish out of the oven and sprinkle the top with the Panko, plus a generous grind of both salt and pepper over the top of the dish. Increase the oven temperature to broil and bake for about 5-8 more minutes, until the top is browned. Let the dish rest for 10 minutes before serving."

    "title": "stone baked chocolate chippers with vanilla maple candied pecans",
    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "For the cookies:",
      "Soften butter at room temperature slightly - about 10 minutes. Cream butter with both sugars: mix on low, then increase the mixer to high and continue beating about 3 minutes, until the mixture is very light and fluffy.",
      "Add eggs, and vanilla, and beat 2 more minutes. Set aside.",
      "Whisk the flours, baking soda, salt, and baking powder together in a separate bowl. I like medium coarse sea salt in this recipe because you'll get this wonderful salty bite here and there in your cookies. That combo of chocolate, caramel and salt is so delish. If you would rather use regular salt, just use 1/4 teaspoon instead.",
      "Using an on/off pulsing motion, add 1/3 of the flour into the creamed mixture, stopping just before it is fully incorporated. Add the remaining two portions of flour in the same way, stopping again before the flour is fully incorporated. Now, add the chocolate chips and chopped candied pecans, and mix on low speed just until all is incorporated. This might seem like extra steps, but mixing the flour in several additions ensures even mixing, and prevents over mixing the dough, which would result in tough cookies. That's all fine and good if you're making bread, but we want tender, chewy, melt in your mouth cookies here.",
      "Now, here's the hard part: If you can stand it, cover your cookie dough and let it sit in the fridge for at least an hour, overnight is even better. I know, I know, that dough staring you in the face every time you open the fridge is really hard. It'll be worth it - if we bake them now, they'll spread more than we want.",
      "Next, using a 1 1/2\" ice cream scoop, plop the chilled dough in a single layer into a glass or plastic freezable container. Cover tightly and freeze cookies about 10 minutes before baking. You don't have to freeze the dough, but \"flash freezing\" the dough this way helps keep the cookies from spreading, giving you a slightly higher, sturdier cookie. Plus, you can leave scooped dough in the freezer, ready to bake whenever you get that cookie craving. If you freeze the dough completely, you might want to let them sit on the kitchen counter about 5 minutes to thaw before baking.",
      "While the cookies are in the freezer, place the pizza stone on the middle rack of the oven, and turn it on to preheat at 350 degrees F.",
      "I found it easiest to place parchment paper on top of my pizza peel, then stagger 6 cookies on the paper so they didn't run into each other. If desired, top your cookies with 2 or 3 pecan halves before baking. Slide the the pizza stone into the oven and then slide the pizza peel out from underneath the paper so that the paper and cookies are resting on the stone that you placed in the oven. Bake 12-14 minutes until cookies are a light golden and set, but still soft in the center. In my oven it took 13 minutes. Slide the pizza peel underneath the parchment, remove from the oven and let cookies cool on the peel 2 minutes. Transfer cookies on the parchment to a baking rack to cool for at least 5 minutes before digging in.",
      "For the Vanilla Maple Candied Pecans:",
      "In a nonstick skillet over medium high heat, toast pecans about 3-5 minutes until they become fragrant. Add maple syrup, sea salt and vanilla. The syrup mixture should bubble. Shake the skillet vigorously, reduce heat to medium and cook another 1-2 minutes until syrup is thick and sticks to pecans. Scrape pecans out onto a piece of parchment paper to cool completely. When cool, chop half of pecans to add to cookies, saving remainder to top the cookies with. These are also great just eating by the handful, or adding to salads, muffins, yogurt, oatmeal, etc.",
      "You could use a sugar/egg white based coating for the candied pecans in this recipe too. I'm just crazy about the chewy, caramel like maple coating on these pecans, they pair perfectly with the more intense caramel flavor in these cookies.",

Make sure you mix the ingredients with a fork or whisk until the mixture is fully blended and all the lumps of flour are gone.",

      "3. At this point, start adding the powdered sugar a few spoonfuls at a time with the mixer running. Once all of the sugar has been added, add any extracts you are using and turn the mixer to high speed. Continue to beat the egg whites until they are very thick, glossy, and a shiny white color. When you stop the mixer and lift the whisk out of the whites, the whites should have a very stiff peak. This process will take about 7-12 minutes in a stand mixer.",

      "5. Pipe your meringue onto the parchment paper in ghost shapes about 1-1/2 inches wide and 2 inches tall. You can either do this by squeezing the bag and pulling up gradually, making one big \"blobby\" ghost, or by making a series of concentric circles spiraling upward. Pipe 12 ghosts onto each baking sheet, for a total of about 2 dozen meringue ghosts.",
      "6. Bake the meringues in the preheated oven for an hour. After an hour, open the oven door and continue to cook for 30 minutes, then turn the oven off, close the door, and allow the meringues to sit until completely cool, about 1 hour.",
      "7. Once the meringues are crisp and room temperature, melt the chocolate in a microwave-safe bowl, stirring after every 30 seconds to prevent overheating. If you want to coat the bottoms in crushed nuts, sprinkles, or toasted coconut as well, place those toppings in small, shallow bowls nearby.",
      "8. Dip the bottoms of the ghosts in the melted chocolate, and scrape the bottoms against the lip of the bowl to remove excess chocolate. If you're dipping them in other toppings, immediately press the bottom of the ghost into the bowl of toppings so they adhere to the wet chocolate. Replace the dipped ghost back on the baking sheet and repeat with remaining ghosts and chocolate. Dip a toothpick in the remaining melted chocolate and give each ghost two dots for eyes and, if you desire, a mouth or other features.",

Drain beans and rinse in a colander until they aren't slimy anymore and add to the pot. Cook about 20-30 minutes until beans are tender. You may want to add a few teaspoons of flour if you want to make it a bit thicker. Serve with cheese and sour cream in a bowl, with Fritos or tortilla chips, or on top of a tortilla!

      "To Make the Cake:",
      "Butter and flour a 9\" springform pan. Preheat oven to 375F degrees.",
      "In a stand mixer with the wire whisk attachment, beat egg whites and a pinch of salt on low speed until foamy. Slowly add 1 cup of sugar and increase speed to medium, beating until soft peaks form. This will take about 5 minutes. Don't over beat! Carefully transfer the egg white mixture to a large stainless steel mixing bowl and set aside.",
      "Using the same mixer bowl, beat the egg yolk, 1/3 cup of sugar, orange zest, Frangelico and vanilla until it becomes thickened and pale yellow in color.",
      "Using a spatula, gently scrape the egg yolk mixture on top of egg whites. Gently incorporate the egg yolk mixture, using a folding motion (scraping along the bottom of the bowl under the egg whites and up through the center of the mixture),",
      "In a small bowl, whisk together the 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons of flour and baking powder to blend well. Sift the flour mixture over the top of the egg mixture (if you dump it in all at once you'll deflate it), and again gently fold in the flour just until it is combined. Gently scrape the batter into your springform pan. Bake for about 30 minutes, until the top is golden and the cake springs back when lightly touched.",
      "Place cake on a baking rack to cool for 20 minutes. Remove the ring of the springform pan from the cake, using a knife if necessary to loosen the sides. Cool completely on the baking rack.",
      "While cake cools, prepare orange simple syrup:",
      "In a small saucepan, over high heat, stir all of the simple syrup ingredients until sugar is dissolved. Heat until mixture boils, and boil for 1 minute. Then remove from heat and cool slightly.",
      "Using a long serrated knife, cut cake into two layers (cutting horizontally). Place strips of waxed paper, about 2 or 3 inches wide, along the edges of your serving platter, this will keep it clean while you ice the cake, then you can remove them before serving.",
      "Remove the bottom cake layer from the springform pan base and place it on the serving platter. Brush it with half of the orange syrup. Brush the top layer with remaining syrup but don't put it on the top of the bottom layer yet. Set both aside.",
      "Prepare Cannoli Filling:",
      "With the wire whisk attachment on your stand mixer, whip the mascarpone and ricotta on high speed until light and fluffy. Add the remaining filling ingredients except for the chocolate chunks, and continue beating until well combined. Stir in the chocolate chunks. If filling seems a little soft, cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place it in the freezer for about 10 minutes to firm it up.",
      "Using an offset spatula (another handy helper in the kitchen - great for spreading evenly), spread the cannoli filling on the top of the bottom cake layer. You may have a little extra filling, it depends on how thick you want your filling layer to be. Then carefully place top cake layer over the filling. Cover cake with plastic wrap and refrigerate. This is one cake that gets better as it sits - so make it a day ahead. It will keep for several days in the refrigerator before it's frosted.",
      "To top your cake with a dusting of powdered sugar and chocolate (topping option #1):",
      "Place confectioner's sugar in a wire mesh strainer and sift it over the top of the cake. Finely grate a piece of semisweet chocolate on top of the powdered sugar. Add a garnish, if desired, in the center of the cake: chocolate covered strawberries, edible flowers, or mini cannolis are good choices.",
      "To make a stabilized vanilla whipped cream frosting (topping option #2):",
      "In a small saucepan, sprinkle the gelatin over the water. Let it stand 1 minute. Then heat the mixture over medium low heat, stirring constantly until gelatin dissolves. Remove from heat and cool slightly. Usually whipped cream begins to weep or separate several hours after being made - adding gelatin helps to prevent this.",
      "Using your mixer, whip the cream with the sugar and vanilla extract on high speed until soft peaks form. Add the gelatin and continue whipping until stiff peaks form. I prefer to use superfine sugar in whipped cream, however with a cake that's going to sit in the fridge for a day, confectioner's sugar adds stability, due to its added cornstarch. But if you're going to use the whipped cream right away, give superfine sugar a try sometime.",
      "Spread the frosting on the top and sides of the cake. If desired, use a spatula to transfer some of the whipped cream to a pastry bag with a star tip and pipe decorative rosettes or a pretty border along the top of the cake. Garnish with chocolate curls, dragees, chocolate pearls, or cocoa nibs. Cake will keep in the refrigerator for 1 day once it's frosted."

      "2. Ground hazelnuts in a food processor or grinder into rock salt consistency. Depending on your preference you can go finer than 3mm or you can go for chunky. Keep in mind that pronounced angular edges tend to tear the mochi as you mold it.",
      "3. Mix Nutella spread and ground hazelnuts in a small bowl until all nut pieces are coated. Form 1-teaspoon sized balls using a measuring spoon and a small teaspoon. Scoop them out from the measuring spoon, place the spread back in and scoop again until you form a ball. It shouldn't take more than 3 strokes. Once you get the hang of it, it will be a breeze. Drop each ball on some aluminum foil placed over a cookie sheet. Place nutella balls on the foil in the freezer for at least 30 minutes, preferably an hour before making mochi so they will harden.",
      "4. Combine glutinous rice flour, 6 tablespoons water, food coloring (if desired) and granulated sugar in a small bowl. Heat it in the microwave on high for 2 minutes. Stir. If the sticky paste peels away from the side of the bowl as you stir, add the remaining tablespoon of water until combined. If not, return bowl to the microwave and heat in 20-second intervals until the paste peels away from the sides of the bowl, then mix with the remaining water.",
      "5. Take the frozen Nutella balls from the freezer.",
      "6. Dust some parchment paper and your work surface (could be just plate) with some extra rice flour. Place a small mound of flour on your work surface for dipping. Flour your hands generously. I find that the best way to 'dust' my hands with rice flour is to wash and wipe, and flour my damp hands. Spoon at least half a tablespoon of sticky paste (a.k.a. the mochi mixture) onto your floured surface. Dip all exposed areas onto your mound of flour. Once it doesn't stick anymore, peel it from the spoon with your hands, then dip all un-floured areas in flour. Press this mound of paste until you form a 4mm-thick wrapper. Dust your hand with flour whenever it sticks to the paste. Use that floured mochi to grab a Nutella ball from the foil, and then carefully wrap it around the Nutella ball. You can stretch it a little, and flour any sticky surface as needed. Once the two mochi wrapper ends meet, to pinch them together with floured fingers - it's just like working with clay. It takes a little practice to get this right, but once you realize that the trick is really to keep your hands from sticking to the mochi, you will be fine. If all else fails, you can eat your mistake. Mmm... Nutella.",
      "7. Lightly roll each Nutella stuffed mochi wrapper in some more flour, and place on the floured parchment paper. Place in the freezer for 30 minutes to set. Or you can eat it right away, really.",
      "Notes: I do repeat the importance of putting flour on the surface and your hands when making the mochi because it is extremely sticky. The mochi paste recipe has provisions for extra paste when you need to start over with the mochi wrapper.",
      "Variation: You can wrap a whole hazelnut in Nutella and freeze it. You can use any imaginable filling you like and you can put any flavorings in the mochi paste itself - from extracts to powder. The mochi paste can also be just rolled in rice flour and eaten plain.",
      "One of the best things about mochi is that you can be very creative about it. Make it savory, make it sweet, it will succumb to whatever flavor whim you fancy. It's open to experimentation without a lot of fail.",
      "For those who haven't eaten mochi or sticky rice cake before, it is like a very soft (sticky/stretchy) pillow of gnocchi. I grew up eating sticky rice cakes and would prefer them to gnocchi on any given day. Try it!"

      "1. In a small bowl, mix the cream cheese, lemon zest and 1 Tablespoon of pure cane juice. Add the mint and mix gently. Allow the cream cheese mixture to rest in the refrigerator for 30 minutes to an hour to incorporate flavors.",
      "Once the cream cheese has rested, preheat your oven with a baking stone in it at 400F.",
      "2. In a separate bowl, mix 1/4 cup of cane juice with 1 Tablespoon of arrowroot powder. Add the lemon juice and strawberries. Mix until the strawberries are well coated with the sweetener.",

      "6. You can arrange thinly sliced lemons on top for decorative purposes.",
      "7. Once filled, fold over the edges of the pate brisee/pie dough to create a rustic tart (see photo). Add the remaining juice from the strawberry mixture over the strawberries in the center of the folded tart.",
      "8. Brush egg whites on the edges of the tart crust for a glowing browned crust.",
      "7. Transfer the tart to the hot baking stone by sliding it off the counter like a pizza peel or bake directly on the parchment paper by placing it on the baking stone. This method will ensure that you get a nice crispy bottom.",
      "8. Bake for 30-35 minutes.",
      "9. Once baked allow to cool for 10 minutes and transfer to a serving dish. This can be served warm or at room temperature."
