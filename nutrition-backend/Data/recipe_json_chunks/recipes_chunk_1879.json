      "Wrap the dough tightly and refrigerate for 1 hour.",
      "Position racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven; preheat the oven to 350F (175C).",
      "Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats.",
      "Divide the dough into 2 pieces.",
      "On a lightly floured work surface, roll out 1 piece of dough about 1/2 inch (1.5 cm) thick, sprinkling the work surface with only as much flour as needed to prevent the dough from sticking (too much flour can make the cookies tough).",
      "Using a 2-inch (5-cm) round cookie cutter, cut out circles of dough.",
      "Place them on one of the prepared baking sheets, spacing them 1 inch (3 cm) apart.",
      "Repeat with the second piece of dough, then reroll the dough scraps.",
      "Using a 1/2-inch (1.5-cm) round cookie cutter (the wide end of a metal pastry tip works well, too), cut out the centers of half of the circles, making sure you have the same number of solid cookies as you do those with cut-outs.",
      "Bake, rotating the baking sheets midway through baking, until the cookies are lightly browned, about 12 minutes.",
      "Let cool completely on the baking sheets.",
      "Spread a rounded teaspoon of jam on all of the solid cookies, then top with the cut-out cookies, making sandwiches.",
      "The dough can be chilled for up to 4 days, or frozen for up to 1 month.",
      "The filled cookies will keep well, stored in an airtight container, for up to 4 days.",
      "For a slightly exotic taste, substitute 1/2 teaspoon of orange-flower water for the orange liqueur.",
      "Or, for lemon-flavored cookies, use the grated zest of 2 lemons.",
      "You can fill the orange-flavored cookies with chocolate instead of jam: Heat 2 ounces (60 g) of chopped bittersweet or semisweet chocolate with 3 tablespoons (45 ml) heavy cream in a bowl set over a saucepan of simmering water.",
      "Use 1 teaspoon of the chocolate mixture for each cookie sandwich.",
      "Another option is to fill them with Nutella or a similar spreadable chocolate-hazelnut paste."

      "If it has a permanent whitish stain, it has been used to store eggs in waterglass, and this makes the container unsuitable for making sauerkraut as the waterglass residue inhibits fermentation.",
      "There are recipes for making sauerkraut in jars or other large containers.",
      "You can purchase specially made fermentation pots: which can relieve you of some of the work involved in keeping the air out of the fermenting cabbage.",
      "All cabbages will make sauerkraut, but each has slightly different properties.",
      "Cabbages are roughly divided into types according to the number of growing days from transplantation to maturity.",
      "Early cabbages take from 56 to 70 days: mid-season from 70 to 76 days; and late cabbages from 76 to 99 days.",

      "EARLY CABBAGE: Early cabbage is the most tender, and the heads are the best to cure for use in making cabbage rolls.",
      "This cabbage also makes the most tender sauerkraut, but one that does not keep long in storage.",
      "Unfortunately, early cabbage matures so early that you may not be able to make use of it.",
      "Other disadvantages are the heads split very quickly in the garden, often beyond redemption, and they do not keep well in storage.",
      "MID-SEASON CABBAGE: This is still a tender cabbage.",

      "LATE CABBAGE: The heads of late cabbage keep well in storage for most of the winter, but they make the least tender sauerkraut, and they require more cooking.",
      "In spite of this, late cabbage is often made into sauerkraut because it is ready about the time that the garden work is slowing down.",

      "Some like to mix in a quantity of pickling spice; others like the tang of peppercorns.",
      "Any single whole spice can be added to your liking, or you can mix them in any combination.",
      "If you are in the mood to experiment, add a few pieces of ginger root and lemons.",
      "HERE IS A PARTIAL LIST OF WHAT YOU CAN ADD: Pumpkin Any of the root vegetables Celery Carrots Onions Horseradish Radish Most garden vegetables may be preserved by lactic acid fermentation, either separately or in combination.",

      "Use all vegetables raw, with the exception of green or yellow wax beans, which must be cooked for at least 5 minutes before being pickled.",
