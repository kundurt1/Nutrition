      "Add more flour or water as needed, but mix only until the dough has formed.",
      "It is important that it be very soft and pliable, and somewhat sticky.",
      "If its dry to the touch, it needs more water.",

      "Cut the cold butter into about 16 pieces and put the pieces in a mixing bowl along with the flour.",
      "I recommend using a mixer, as its so much easier.",
      "Use the paddle attachment and mix on the lowest speed for about 1 minute to break down the butter into smaller pieces.",
      "Stop the machine and scrape down the bowl and paddle as needed, then mix again until the mixture is no longer lumpy.",

      "(Though its harder, you can also do this by hand by squeezing the butter and flour for a few minutes until you have a smooth paste.",
      "It should be cool to the touch, not warm.",
      "You can also use a food processor, but be sure to use pulses rather than running the processor continuously, or the butter may melt.)",

      "If necessary, lift the plastic wrap and use a metal pastry scraper or bowl scraper to trim off uneven corners or sides, putting the trimmings in the center of the butter block or using them to fill any gaps.",
      "The butter block should be about 1/2 inch thick and smooth across the top, with nicely squared-off corners.",
      "If the butter block has warmed up or seems to be melting due to friction or hand warmth, place it in the refrigerator for a few minutes (parchment and all).",

      "Always begin by rolling from the center to the four corners, and then roll to the four sides to even it out.",
      "Check under the dough frequently, lifting it with a metal pastry scraper to see if it needs more dusting flour.",
      "(In addition to preventing sticking, the flour acts like ball bearings, allowing the dough to extend more easily.)",
      "Square off the sides and corners of the rectangle with the pastry scraper.",
      "The dough will be about 1/2 inch thick, the same as the butter block.",
      "Lift the parchment with the butter block and set it down atop the dough on the left side to check the sizing.",
      "The butter should cover only half of the dough, with just a 1/4-inch border on the left, top, and bottom.",
      "If it covers more than that, remove the butter block and roll out the dough a little wider or taller, as needed.",
      "If theres more than 1/2 inch of dough around the border, shrink the dough by scooting in the edges with the pastry blade or a sturdy ruler.",
      "When the dough and butter are properly matched, remove the plastic wrap and flip the butter block over onto the left half of the dough, again with a border of about 1/4 inch on the left, top, and bottom.",
      "Carefully adjust it into place before removing the parchment.",

      "Lift the right half of the dough and fold it over the butter block to envelop or sandwich the butter.",
      "Stretch the dough along the top rim to seal the butter inside by pressing the top rim of dough to the rim of the underside and pinching them together to create a seal.",
      "You now have three layersdough, butter, dough.",

      "Working from the center to the four corners and then to the four sides, gently roll out the dough into a rectangle, dusting under and on top of the dough with flour as needed.",
      "Continue rolling until you have a 1/2-inch-thick rectangle thats about 16 inches wide and 9 inches long.",
      "Square off the sides and the four corners, then fold the dough as if folding a letter: Fold the right one-third of the dough to the left, and as you lay it down, be sure to square it off so that the top and bottom edges are perfectly aligned with the underlying dough.",
      "Then fold the left one-third of the dough to the right in the same way.",
      "Use the rolling pin to press out any air pockets so that the folds lay flat, then gently transfer the dough to a lightly floured sheet pan and cover loosely with plastic wrap.",
      "Let the dough rest at room temperature for 15 to 20 minutes so the gluten can relax.",
      "If the butter seems very soft, you can put the pan in the refrigerator for this resting period.",
      "After the resting period, transfer the dough back to the floured work surface with the open seam facing away from you and the closed side facing you.",
      "Gently roll out the dough to a rectangle about 16 inches wide by 9 inches long, then once again fold it in thirds.",
      "Gently transfer the dough back to the floured sheet pan, cover loosely with plastic wrap, and let the dough rest at room temperature (or in the refrigerator if the butter seems very soft) for 20 minutes.",
      "After the second resting period, once again transfer the dough to the floured work surface, closed side facing you, and gently roll it out and fold it as before.",
      "Gently transfer the dough back to the floured pan, cover loosely with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for 20 minutes.",
      "You have now completed three turns and have created 81 layers of dough and butter.",
      "For the final roll-out and shaping, transfer the dough back to the floured work surface and gently roll it out, first from the center to the corners and then out to the sides, until the dough is just under 1/4 inch thick and forms a rectangle 24 to 28 inches wide and 9 inches long.",
      "(If you want to make small croissants or chocolate croissants, roll the dough into a rectangle about 32 inches wide and only about 7 inches long.)",
      "Be careful not to put too much downward pressure on the dough as you roll it, or the thin layers could break, but you do need to be somewhat firm, yet patient, as you roll.",
      "You may have to stop and dust with flour underneath the dough from time to time or give the dough a short rest if it starts to resist or shrink back.",
      "Square off the sides and four corners with the pastry scraper or a ruler.",
      "To make crescent-shaped croissants, begin by cutting out triangles.",
      "For full-size croissants, cut triangles about 9 inches long by 4 inches wide at the base.",
      "(The 9-inch length of the rolled-out dough will shrink to 8 inches as you cut.)",
      "Use a ruler or yardstick to measure and, starting at the left side, place a small notch at 4-inch intervals along the bottom edge of the dough with the pastry scraper or a knife.",
      "Repeat this along the top edge, but mark the first interval at 2 inches from the left end, then continue measuring at 4-inch intervals from that point on.",
      "For smaller croissants, roll the dough to only 7 inches long, which means it will be much wider, probably closer to 30 to 33 inches, and make the notches at an interval of only 3 inches, instead of 4 inches.",
      "Use a pizza cutter or a metal pastry scraper to cut a line from the left bottom corner of the dough to the notch in from the left at the top, then simply connect the marks to cut off the dough triangles.",
      "When all of the pieces are cut and separated, cut a 1-inch notch into the bottom center of the triangle base of each piece.",
      "Spread the bottom as wide as the notch will allow to create winglike flaps.",
      "Start with the flaps and begin rolling up the dough as if it were a rug.",
      "Gently pull out the top point (the nose) of the dough as you roll the bottom toward it, but be careful not to squeeze the dough or the layers will break.",
      "Stretching the nose will elongate the dough a bit as you roll it up.",
      "It should form in either 5 or 7 steps; if you only get 5 steps, you can give the flaps at each end a twist to create another set of steps if you like.",
      "Repeat with all of the dough triangles.",
      "(If you have any leftover scraps, simply roll them up to make mini croissants or coil them for Danish.)",
      "Place the croissants about 1 1/2 inches apart on a sheet pan lined with parchment paper or a silicone mat, with the nose of each one positioned underneath so that its anchored.",
      "As you pan each croissant, give the end flaps a slight curve inward, facing in the same direction as the nose is pointing, forming a crescent shape.",
      "(If you dont want to bake all of the croissants at this time, place the extra croissants on a pan or in individual freezer bags and chill or freeze them.)",
      "Cover loosely with plastic wrap and proof at room temperature for 2 1/2 to 3 hours.",
      "The croissants will rise slowly and swell noticeably in size, but they wont double.",
      "About 20 minutes before baking, preheat the oven to 450F (232C).",
      "Applying egg wash (see page 135) is an option at this point; some people like the glossy finish it provides, but I dont think its necessary.",
      "Place the croissants in the oven and lower the oven temperature to 375F (191C).",
      "Bake for 15 minutes, then rotate the pans and bake for an additional 15 to 20 minutes, until the croissants are a rich golden brown on all sides, without any white sections in the visible layers.",
      "If they seem to be baking unevenly or are getting too dark and have streaks of light sections, lower the oven temperature to 325F (162C) and extend the baking time as needed.",
      "The croissants should feel very light when lifted and be flaky on the surface.",
      "Allow the croissants to cool for at least 45 minutes before serving; an hour is even better.",
      "If served while still hot, theyll appear to be greasy because the butter hasnt yet firmed up and been fully absorbed into the pastry.",
      "One of the recipe testers accidentally left her melted butter for the detrempe on the stove too long and it browned.",
      "She used it anyway and reported that it added a wonderful flavor to her finished products.",
      "So consider using browned butter in your detrempe, but keep a watchful eye on it.",
      "Such a small amount of butter can go from brown to black very quickly.",
      "To bake frozen croissants, remove the shaped croissants from the freezer at least 3 hours before you plan to bake so they can thaw.",
      "Dont bake them while theyre still frozen or they wont rise or bake evenly.",
      "Once the croissants have thawed, follow the baking instructions in the recipe."
