      "For the crust, drizzle in ice water, mixing until the dough is cohesive.",
      "Grab a handful; if it holds together willingly and doesn't seem at all dry or crumbly, you've added enough liquid.",
      "Divide the dough in half, and shape each half into a disk.",

      "Refrigerate the tart shells, and preheat the oven to 350F, while you prepare the filling.",

      "The filling should come to within about 3/8-inch of the top of the pastry.",
      "Sprinkle 1 tablespoon chopped pecans atop the filling.",
      "Suggestion: assemble one tart first, so you can see how much filling to add without it overflowing once you add the pecans.",

      "Bake the tarts for 45 minutes (in a metal muffin pan), or 40 minutes (in a silicone muffin pan).",
