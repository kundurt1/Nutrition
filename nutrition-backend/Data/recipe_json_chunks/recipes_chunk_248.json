Drop batter 3-inches apart on an ungreased cookie sheet. Flatten slightly with the back of the spoon if you wish. Thumbs do just as well. Bake for 15 minutes. Do not overbake. The centers should be soft when the cookies first come out of the oven. Makes 30 (5-inch) cookies. I like to use a cookie scoop and have smaller cookies and if you do, bake only for 12 minutes. Each oven is different though. They can be lightly frosted or plain is very good also."
