      "To poach the octopus, adjust the oven rack to the middle position and preheat the oven to 300F.",
      "In a braising pot just big enough to hold the octopus, heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil over medium-high heat until it is almost smoking and slides easily in the pan, 2 to 3 minutes.",
      "Add the octopus and sear it for 8 to 10 minutes, turning to cook all sides evenly, until the octopus is burgundy all over and browned in places.",
      "Remove the octopus to a plate and wipe out the pot.",
      "In the pot you seared the octopus in, heat the garlic cloves with 2 tablespoons of the remaining olive oil and saute the garlic over medium-high heat, stirring often, until it is golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes.",
      "Turn off the heat.",
      "Remove and discard the garlic cloves and return the octopus to the pot.",
      "Add the red pepper flakes, wine cork, and enough olive oil to cover the octopus.",
      "Put the lid on the pot and place it in the oven for 1 1/2 to 2 hours, until the octopus is very tender; it will puncture and tear easily with a fork.",
      "Remove the pot from the oven, and set it aside to allow the octopus to cool to room temperature in the oil.",
      "Remove the octopus from the oil, reserving the oil to poach another octopus within a week, and place the octopus on a baking sheet.",

      "Use a large knife to cut the octopus in half through the body, keeping the tentacles intact.",
      "Working from the body outward as if you were cutting off the petals of the flower, cut each tentacle to remove it from the head.",
      "Turn the head inside out, scrape out and discard any guck left inside the head, and cut the head into quarters.",
      "Cut the body into 2-inch segments, leaving the ends of each tentacle long for their dramatic effect on the plate, and place all of the octopus pieces in a medium bowl or a large, nonreactive baking dish.",
      "To make the marinade, combine the parsley, olive oil, garlic, and red pepper flakes in the bowl of a miniature food processor fitted with a metal blade or the jar of a blender and puree.",
      "Drizzle the marinade over the octopus and toss to coat it with the marinade.",
      "Cover the bowl or dish tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate the octopus until you are ready to grill it or for up to three days.",
      "To make the salad, steam the potatoes until they are tender when pierced with a small sharp knife, about 20 minutes.",
      "Remove the potatoes to a plate until they are cool enough to touch.",
      "Use a small, sharp knife to remove the peel from the potatoes and discard the peels.",
      "Slice the potatoes into 1/2-inch-thick rounds, place them in a small bowl, and set aside.",

      "Prepare a hot fire in a gas or charcoal grill or preheat a grill pan.",
      "Season the potatoes with the 1 teaspoon of kosher salt and toss to distribute the salt evenly over the potato slices.",
      "Add the leek, scallions, sliced celery, and celery leaves to the bowl with the potatoes.",
      "Season the salad with salt and pepper, drizzle with 1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons of the vinaigrette, and toss to coat with the seasonings.",
      "Taste for seasoning and add more vinaigrette, salt, and pepper, if desired.",
      "Pile the salad in the center of four plates, dividing it equally and reserving any vinaigrette left in the bottom of the bowl.",
      "Have the bowl with the reserved vinaigrette nearby and grill the octopus pieces until they are charred on all sides, about 3 minutes total.",
      "Remove the octopus pieces from the grill as they are done and place them in the bowl with the vinaigrette you tossed the salad with.",
      "Drizzle with another 1/4 cup of the vinaigrette and toss to coat the octopus with the vinaigrette.",
