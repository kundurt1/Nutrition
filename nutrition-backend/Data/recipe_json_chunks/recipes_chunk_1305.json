You've just made clarified butter. To make classical Indian ghee, after the butter stops boiling, increase the heat to about 250 F to brown the bottom mil solids slightly.

Stir together and cook until the beans are heated through. Add the canned diced tomatoes, the worcestershire and the Old Bay. Stir thoroughly and let this mixture simmer for about 5 minutes. Add the salsa and stir. At this point, be sure to sample the sauce to assess its saltiness. I'm not big on salt, so I only add an additional tablespoon or so to my pot. If you need more salt and spice, be sure to add more Old Bay before you add salt, since it's a salty spice mixture. At this point, your chili's ready to serve. If I have time, I like to let it simmer for an hour or so to let the flavors continue to meld together, but if you're in a hurry, this is not necessary! Serve over rice, with or without Tabasco sauce."

      "Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Toss the cinnamon and sugar together and set aside. In a large bowl whisk together all the dry ingredients. In another bowl stir together oil, lemon juice, maple syrup, egg and yogurt. Make a hole in the center of the dry ingredients and pour the wet ingredients into the hole. Gently fold everything together until combined. Divide batter evenly into a greased donut pan. (I used the cooking spray that has flour in it but I think any kind would work.) The batter will be pretty thick and airy. We found it was easier to scoop it into the donut pan with our hands. Before baking be sure to clean off any stray dough around the circle so there's a hole in the middle of the donut. Bake for 10 minutes or until golden brown. Let cool for a few moments and then flip over onto a cooling rack while still warm. Use a pastry brush to butter your donuts and then dip each donut in the cinnamon sugar mixture to coat."

The baking soda will lose weight as it bakes but maintains about the same volume, so you should end up with about 1/4 cup (60g) of baked baking soda. Allow it to cool completely, and then keep it in an airtight container at room temperature until you are ready to make pretzels.

Sift baked baking soda before using, as it cakes after prolonged storage.)",

Be sure to choose a pot that is at least a finger's length wider than the diameter of the pretzels and tall enough so that the water comes up no more than 2 in (5cm) from the rim. (Avoid other metal surfaces, such as aluminum and copper, and nonstick surfaces, which may react with the baked baking soda.) Pour in the 1/4 cup (60g) of baked baking soda, and bring the liquid to a simmer over medium-high heat. Once the baking soda dissolves, reduce the heat to medium to maintain a gentle simmer.",

Add ground seeds, baobab powder, processed carrots, salt, turmeric, pepper, cumin, curry, thyme and some water to the center. Using a fork, begin to incorporate ingredients for dough by pulling flour into the center. Slowly mix in as much flour as the mixture can absorb. Once the dough starts to come together, begin kneading by hand. During the kneading process, add as much flour as necessary to hold the dough together, but don't over-flour (otherwise you'll end up eating stones). Knead until ingredients are thoroughly combined. Divide the dough into 4 pieces. Roll each piece by gently pushing with fingers spread so as to make an evenly-distributed \"snake\" (diameter: 1 cm). Cut into 1-cm long pieces. Use a fork to make ribs (I used a \"rigagnocchi\", i.e. a gnocchi board like this). Dehydrate for about 6 hours and store in the fridge. Before eating, soak the gnocchi in warm water for about 10 minutes, then drain and serve with some diluted Jerusalem artichoke & spinach velvet sauce (blended until warm and well-combined) and some herb oil.* Sprinkle some chia and hemp seeds and serve."

In a large bowl mix flour, salt, sugar, and cheese. When the butter is nice and cold, mix into the flour with a pastry cutter (I 100% used my hands and just worked quickly so as not to melt the butter). When the mixture begins to clump together, slowly add water. Only add as much as needed to form a ball! Start with 1/4 cup and increase as you mix. You don't want a wet dough. On a floured surface shape ball into a disc and wrap tightly with plastic wrap. Refrigerate for an hour before using.",
      "Make the Onions: Heat 2 Tbsp. olive oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add in onions and stir frequently so they can brown but not burn. Adjust the heat as necessary. After about 20 minutes add sugar and season with a bit of salt. Continue cooking and stirring until onions are a deep golden brown. This can take about 45 minutes but they could go for an hour. Just don't wander away and leave them unattended, they can stick and burn. When the onions have acquired that nice deep golden tan, add in the wine and cook for about 2-3 minutes, until the liquid has evaporated. Set aside to cool before assembling the galette.",
      "Assemble the Galette: Preheat oven to 400\u00b0 F. Lay out a large sheet of parchment paper on your work surface. Remove dough from refrigerator and with a lightly floured rolling pin, roll out dough into a somewhat circle-shape, about 1/8 in. thick. Place about 1/2 of the onions in the center of the dough, followed by all of the garlic, and about 1/2 of the potato slices. Leave about a 1 1/2 to 2 in. border. See photos above. Lightly season with salt and pepper and top with 1/2 of the cheese and thyme. Drizzle with 1/2 of the butter mixture. Follow with the rest of the potatoes, more salt and pepper, the remaining onions, cheese and thyme and lemon zest. Folded the edges of the dough over, brush with egg wash, and bake for about 45-50 minutes until golden brown. Let cool for about 5-10 minutes before serving."

After 24 hours add the day 2 ingredients to the mixture; mix till smooth and cover with plastic wrap and allow to sit for 2 hours. Take the bowl and place into the refrigerator for another 24 to 72 hours. The night before you want to bake the bread you will need to create the soaker. You need to add the 8 grains to a bowl and add the 1 cup of water. Cover with plastic wrap and allow to sit on the counter overnight. When you are ready to make the bread. remove the dough from the fridge and allow to sit on the counter for 2 hours. Pour mixture out onto a flat surface and add the soaked grains. Knead for 6 minutes. The dough should be slightly sticky, but not wet. So, if you need to add a little more flour go a head. Add just a tablespoon of flour at a time. Place dough in a lightly oiled large bowl and turn a few times to lightly coat. Allow to rest for 1 1/2 hours. Afterwards, pour dough out onto a flat surface and punch down. Cut dough into 3 equal parts. Flatten each piece and roll up like a jelly roll; be sure that they are rolled tightly. Place loaves on top of parchment that is sprinkled with cormeal. You may only be able to bake two first and the third one separately. Cover with plastic wrap and allow to rest for 1 hour. Dust with flour and score the tops just before placing into oven. Place into a preheated 400 degree oven with a baking stone. Create steam by placing a cast iron pan on the bottom of the oven the same time that you turn on the oven. Once you place the breads onto the baking stone pour about a cup of boiling water into the hot pan and close the door. Bake for 30 -35 minutes or till when tapped on the bottom of the loaf it sounds hollow or a meat thermometer reads 180F in the center. Remove and cool on a wire rack."

You want them to caramelize, so don't toss or move them. Add a little more oil if the flour absorbs what's in the pan. After about 3 minutes, turn over the prawns. Let it caramelize, toss and turn out onto a cookie sheet. Add about 1/4 cup more olive oil to the already hot saute pan. Drain pan juices from the cookie sheet into the saute pan. Add sliced garlic and let it get light brown. Add chiles and let them get soft. Add the basil and stand back - there's a lot of water in basil and it will pop. Let it get crispy, less than a minute.

      "Put the chicken thighs in a large pot, add water to cover and stir in the salt. Bring to a simmer over medium heat and simmer until the chicken is cooked through, 20 to 25 minutes. Drain the chicken. When the chicken is cool enough to handle, remove the meat from the bones, discarding the skin, and shred the meat. Set the chicken aside. Preheat an oven to 400\u00b0F. Lightly grease a 9-by-13-inch roasting pan. In a saute pan over medium heat, warm the oil. Using tongs, quickly pass each tortilla through the hot oil until softened, 2 to 3 seconds. Drain on a paper towel-lined baking sheet. Pour 1/2 cup of the chili verde starter into the prepared roasting pan and spread evenly. Place 3 tortillas on top (cut 1 tortilla in half so it will fit in the pan). Top with 1 cup of the chicken, 1 cup of the jack cheese and 1/2 cup of the chili verde starter. Repeat the layering 4 more times, ending with a layer of tortillas. Top with the remaining 1/2 cup chili verde starter and the remaining jack cheese. Cover the pan with aluminum foil and bake for 30 minutes. Remove the foil and continue baking until the cheese is bubbly and lightly browned, about 20 minutes more. Remove from the oven and let stand for 10 minutes. Sprinkle the red onion, cilantro and queso anejo cheese on top. Slice and serve warm. Serves 10 to 12."

Pour one of the bowls of batter into the prepared baking pan and then pour the other bowl of batter on top. Use a knife to swirl the top batter into the bottom one. Decorate the top of the cake with slivers of almonds if you wish. Bake for 35 to 40 minutes or until done. Remove from oven and let sit for ten minutes. Invert onto a cake dish if you wish. Sift a light coating of icing sugar on the top after it has cooled. For a smaller cake prepare half of the recipe and bake in a greased and floured 9\"x13\" pan or a round 10\" pan for 25 to 30 minutes."

      "Cook 4 pieces of bacon to your liking. While bacon is cooking, slice avocado (slice in shell for easier handling), tomato, and lettuce. If you decide to use scallions, chop as much as you see fit. Use a small bowl to mix mayo and scallions together (for a more mild tasting spread, use half mayo and half sour cream). Take bread (toasted or un-toasted) and coat each slice with spread. Layer on half of ingredients to each and enjoy! This is a quick and easy sandwich that is loaded with flavor! This is a great recipe because it is easy to add or subtract ingredients without losing the integrity of the sandwich."
