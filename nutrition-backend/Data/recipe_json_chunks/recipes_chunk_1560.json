      "Dry the beef cubes well, and season on all sides with salt and pepper. Put half the beef in a bowl and sprinkle with half of the flour. Toss to coat well. Remove the coated beef to a plate. Repeat with the second half of the beef and remaining 1/4 cup of flour.",
      "Next you'll be cooking the beef, working in batches with plenty of room between the pieces of meat. So put some of the beef into the hot Dutch oven. Brown the beef on all sides over medium-high heat. As meat browns, transfer it to a bowl and set aside. Keep cooking the rest of the beef. The flour and fat will begin to stick to the bottom of the pan and form fond. This is good, just take care to stir and not to blacken it. Add a bit of canola oil as needed if you need more fat.",
      "Once meat is browned and has been transferred to the bowl, saute leeks and carrots in the same pot for about 8 minutes, until they are soft and have begun to caramelize. As the vegetables cook, stir frequently, scraping up the brown bits from the bottom of the pan. As the vegetables release some of their moisture, the fond will begin to loosen. Add garlic and saute another minute. Add vegetables to the beef bowl and set aside.",
      "Turn the heat up to high and carefully add brandy or cognac to the pot. Vigorously scrape up the bits of fond from the bottom of the pot. Reduce the liquor to a few tablespoons. Add 1 1/2 cups beef broth and bring to a boil. Reduce the liquid to about half.",
      "Return the pancetta, meat and vegetables back to the pot, along with any juices that may have accumulated. Add the remaining 1 1/2 cups broth, wine, mushrooms, herbs, sugar and tomato paste. Liquid should just cover meat and vegetables. Bring to a boil. Stir deeply, scraping the bottom of the pot then put the lid on. Place it in the hot oven and cook for an hour and a half with the lid on. Remove the lid and stir. Return it to the oven for another hour and a half, stirring and checking every 30 minutes. Dish is ready when beef is fork-tender and the liquid has reduced to a thick broth. Garnish with chopped parsley.",
      "This recipe is loosely based on a Beef Bourguignonne recipe published in the May 1994 edition of Bon Appetit, with quite a bit of tweaking."

However after about 30 minutes you can grab the edges of your parchment and lift the bars out of the pan to continue cooling. You want your bars to be completely room temperature before cutting into them, in fact I even pop mine into the fridge for a good 30 minutes just to be sure. Once cooled, using a serrated knife, cut into desired sized pieces. If they start to crumble then they're not completely cool - so pop 'em back in the fridge and try again in 15 minutes.",

Chocolate bark should harden within several minutes, at which point you should definitely sample one, and then return the rest to the refrigerator for another 2 hours.",

This would also go really well as a sloppy joe sort of thing if straining off some of the liquid. Or it would also go perfect on a hot dog. So if you are looking for a new idea for making chili, give this one a shot. It was great. I hope you enjoy."

      "Recipe source: barely adapted from my virtual friend, Kim.",
      "Note: Kim, who gave me this recipe, alerted me to the most magnificent tip. I love onions but hate the after effects of eating them raw in a salad. To temper the onions a bit, soak the onion slices covered in cold water with a bit of baking soda (I use about 1/2 teaspoon soda). Let them sit for 15-20 minutes then rinse and drain well. Also, in my pictures, disregard the overly yellow color of my vinaigrette. I went a little crazy with the mustard when I made it this time. Yours probably won't be quite this yellow. Finally, this recipe makes an excellent main dish if served alongside grilled chicken. Keep in mind that all the quantities can easily be adapted according to taste. Yum!"

It is made with both cream cheese and condensed milk with a little lemon juice and zest added to bring out all the lovely flavors. Again, as with the tart shells, the filling can be made several days in advance and simply covered and stored in the refrigerator. Just be sure to fill the shortbread tarts with the cream mixture the day of serving in order to keep the shortbread wonderfully crisp. These are so pretty when garnished with fresh berries or slices of your favorite fruit.",

      "Divide the dough into 36 even pieces and place one ball of dough in the center of each muffin tin. With your fingertips, press the dough up the sides of the individual muffin tin so there is an indentation in the center. Once filled, place the tart pan, with the unbaked shells, in the freezer for about 20 minutes so the shortbread can become firm. (This will help to prevent the shortbread from puffing up during baking.)",

Knead the dough until the dough is smooth and forms a ball, about 5 minutes. Remove the dough from the bowl. Spray the bowl with non-stick cooking spray. Place the dough back in the bowl and cover with plastic wrap or a damp towel. Let the dough rise in a warm area for about 1 hour or until doubled in size. (I preheated the oven to 150 F, shut it off, and put the dough in the oven to rise).",

Spread most of the melted butter evenly over the dough (reserve about a tablespoon, for brushing over the top of the rolls). Sprinkle the brown sugar and cinnamon filling evenly over the butter and lightly push the mixture into the butter. Starting with the long edge closest to you, carefully roll the dough into a log, keeping it tight as you roll. When you reach the end of the dough, pinch along the edge to seal. Cut the log into slices using a knife, or place a long piece of dental floss under the roll about an inch away from the very end of the roll. Take the ends of the floss in each hand and wrap them around the roll. Keeping the ends of the floss in each hand, don't let go and then tighten the floss so it starts to cut through the roll. Again, don't change hands. Tighten until the floss comes out and the individual roll is separated. Cut the roll about every inch.",
      "5. Place the rolls in the buttered pan (cut side up) about 1/2 an inch apart. Cover with a damp towel or plastic wrap and allow to rise in a warm place until the dough is doubled in size, about 30 minutes.",

      "7. In the meantime, make the frosting: In a medium bowl, combine the softened cream cheese and butter. Whisk until it's creamy. Add the powdered sugar and mix until well combined. Add the eggnog and vanilla and whisk until smooth. Drizzle the frosting on each warm roll. Enjoy!",

Use Velveeta shredded cheese, and pecans, with raisins instead of the cranberries. Do you love Caesar salad? Use Italian cheese blend, and sunflower seeds. The type of salad greens you use also make a big difference....there is rich and delicious butter lettuce, or spicy spring greens...the sky is the limit with flavor combinations here.",

You can use as little as one bag, or as many as four bags depending on how many people you are feeding. If you are using home grown (and if you are, I'm so jealous) salad greens then simple wash and gently tear up 6 or so cups of greens.",

I love having a multitude of textures in my pie, thus my recommendation to use more than one variety. I like to use at least 2 Granny Smith and 2 honeycrisp, but you can use any variety you like. For the pie crust, I use Pillsbury crusts for time's sake. But I'm sure this would be even more scrumptious with a homemade crust!",

I love cinnamon, so I typically use quite a bit. The end result should be apples that are covered by the spices, but not so much that there's lots of extra cinnamon in the bottom of the bowl. You just want to coat the apples really well.",

Place the other pie crust on top and press edges into the side of the dish and into the edges of the bottom layer, so as to seal the pie.",
      "Crack egg into a small bowl. Stir the egg yolk. Now lightly brush the yolk over the top layer of the pie. I like to use my fingers for this part, but you can use a pastry brush. You just want a light egg-glaze. This will make your pie crust nice and shiny. Who doesn't love a pretty pie?",

      "2. For the cake and cream layer: In a blender or with an electric mixer (handheld or stand mixer), whip together the cream cheese, half-and-half or evaporated milk and sugar until smooth and creamy. Transfer the mixture to a bowl if you used a blender. Fold in the angel food cake cubes. Keep in mind (from the note below) that you may not use all of the cake cubes, especially if using an angel food cake mix. Add cake cubes until they are all thickly coated with a layer of cream. If making this in advance, it can dry out if there is too much angel food cake added.",
      "3. For the whipped cream: In a medium sized bowl using a mixer, beat together the heavy cream and powdered sugar until peaks form.",
      "4. To assemble: In a trifle dish or in a large glass bowl, spread half of the angel food cake mixture. Top with half of the blueberries, spreading evenly across, and then spread half of the sweetened whipped cream. Repeat the layers.",
      "5. Cover and refrigerate at least 2 hours or up to 24 hours. Serve chilled.",
      "Recipe source: Adapted from my Aunt Marilyn.",
      "Note: So here's the deal ... it depends on what type of angel food cake you are using to determine how much of it you need. You need about one angel food cake. According to my Aunt Marilyn, a store bought angel food cake is the perfect size. I made this while my mom was visiting; she made an angel food cake from a cake mix and we used almost all of it in the dessert (minus the amount that exploded in my oven and the pieces we snacked on-so I'd say we used 3/4 of the cake). I'm guessing that my homemade angel food cake recipe would be just about perfect since it is slightly less tall than a cake mix angel food cake. Basically, just keep an eye on the cream/cake mixture as you are adding the cake. Only add cake cubes while they are all evenly coated with a thick layer of cream. Too many cake cubes and it might dry out (especially if it is made in advance). Speaking of making it ahead, this can be assembled and refrigerated up to 24 hours in advance."

    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "**If you're not familiar with the 5 Minutes a Day approach, you'll need a LARGE (a gallon at least) container with a lid. I use a gallon ice cream tub with a hole poked in the lid (you don't want the lid to be airtight or it'll explode with the expanding gases as the dough rises). You'll also need enough fridge space to store this container until you use all the dough. You should also know that this recipe will make 3-4 medium sized (about a pound) loaves. But that won't be a problem. Oh, and once you've tried this approach, it WILL change your everyday life. If you're a bread person, at least.",
      "1. In your storage tub, combine the warm water, yeast, and salt. Swirl or stir gently to dissolve the yeast.",
      "2. Add the flours and sunflower seeds all at once.",
      "3. Stir with a spoon until the dough begins to come together. Then get your hands in there and mix until all the liquid is incorporated and there are patches of dry flour left over.",
      "4. Put the lid on the container (you may not want to seal it yet - and remember - don't use an airtight lid!) and let the dough rise at room temperature for three hours or so. At this point it should have not quite doubled in size. (I found this dough didn't rise as much as others, but it has an amazing oven lift.) Stick it in the fridge over night.",
      "5. About an hour before you want to eat the bread, preheat the oven to 450F and place a pan of water on the bottom shelf of the oven.",
      "6. Now prepare your baking surface. You can use a pizza stone (which you should preheat with the oven), but I don't have one, so I've been using a normal half-sheet pan. To use a normal half-sheet pan, you need to spread a thin layer of cornmeal or semolina on the pan roughly in the shape and size of your loaf. This will keep it from sticking.",
      "7. Then pull out a chunk of dough about the size of a softball (or however big you want the loaf to be) and shape the loaf: what you want to do is create a \"gluten cloak\". To do this you need to sort of flatten (not squish) your dough into a disc and then roll the edges toward the bottom. You'll be able to see the strands of gluten forming and creating almost a network across the top of the loaf. I like an oblong loaf shape for this bread, but it really doesn't much matter what shape you give it. (*See photo)",
      "8. Once you've shaped the loaf, roll the top and sides of it in the extra sunflower seeds until the loaf is pretty generously coated. Place it on top of the cornmeal on your baking sheet and make sure the bottom is pretty thoroughly coated in the cornmeal. Trust me: you do NOT want your bread sticking. Then slash the loaf: take a sharp knife and cut a slash about 3/4\" right down the middle of the loaf (lengthwise). This will give it room to rise and will make it look awfully pretty. Let the bread rest at room temperature for 20 minutes while the oven pre-heats.",
      "9. Bake it for 30 minutes. It should be evenly browned (my oven is really small and heats unevenly, so I rotate the loaf halfway through to ensure even browning) and when it's done it will sound hollow if you tap on the bottom of the loaf. (You *may* need an additional 5 or so minutes and definitely more if you bake a considerably larger loaf.) Let it cool for a few minutes before you tear into it. It'll give it time to compose itself and will lessen the likelihood that you'll burn the dickens out of your mouth. (Not that it wouldn't have been worth it.)"

Slowly pour your 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons of hot (but not boiling, don't wanna kill the yeast!) water through the feed tube, until a dough forms. Then let the machine run for a minute to knead the dough. (I have a 5-cup processor, and I do sometimes start and stop the machine in 20-second increments, because I've overheated my processor before making this recipe. However, if you have a bigger processor, no worries, and I have made it successfully plenty of times in mine.)",

My kitchen must be cold, because I always have to wait about an hour for my dough to double, but you might see results in about 45 minutes.",

Divide your dough ball into 8 pieces (to me, this is the hardest part-I can never make them perfectly even!) and shape each piece into a roll-shaped ball. If you get them to be perfectly round, you might want to flatten them a little bit, but I don't worry too much about perfection here. Put the rolls onto that floured baking sheet, cover it with your towel from before, and leave them for another 30 minutes.",
      "Now we're ready to give them that nice, chewy soft pretzel crust. I have never made bagels personally, but I would imagine that the treatment is the same. Go ahead and preheat the oven to 375F. Get a clean baking sheet or jelly roll pan and cover it with parchment (SmittenKitchen uses cornmeal but I never found it necessary). Boil 8 cups of water. While you wait for the water to boil, go ahead and lightly beat one egg white in a small bowl, and get your pastry brush and your sea salt out. When the water is boiling, add your baking soda and remaining 2 tablespoons of sugar. The water will foam up very quickly, but just for a few seconds-still, use a bigger pot! You don't want to make a mess. You should add the rolls, 4 at a time, to the pot, and let them sit there for 30 seconds, then flip them (I like to use a big strainer spoon) and do 30 seconds on the other side. Once they're done, put them (right side up) onto your parchment-covered baking sheet. Repeat with the other 4 rolls.",
      "At this point, you're going to want to use a sharp, preferably serrated knife to cut Xs into the top of each roll. I've seen pretzel rolls that are far prettier than mine, so I don't work too hard, but it does look nice on your finished product. Then use your pastry brush to glaze the rolls with egg white, then top each with sea salt or other coarse salt to your liking.",
      "Finally, we're ready to bake! Pop these into the oven for 25 minutes (they should be brown and smell delicious). Let them cool on a cooling rack for 10 minutes, then dig in! I like to eat them warm, or cut them like hamburger buns to make an awesome ham and cheese sandwich (I don't like mustard but something tells me most people would like it in this combo). They don't keep very well, because the salt kind of makes them squishy. If I have any left over, I put them in a loosely closed paper bag and eat them all up the next day!"

If you are watching your weight, clean out the pan and heat 2 tablespoons olive oil to the pan; if you are feeling naughty, leave the bacon fat in the pan. Add 1/2 onion diced, cook until translucent. Add Brussels sprouts and saute till al dente. I like mine a little brown. I find they become sweet. Make sure you salt and pepper the veggies. I have made the mistake of forgetting and my family was not happy. This veggie needs the salt. Add the bacon back to the pan and top with 1/2 cup of your favorite nut. Sunflower or almond is what I prefer, but candied pecans would be nice too!"

      "Directions For Cake:",
      "1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Prepare a 9x13 cake pan with baking spray and a sprinkle of flour over it to coat. You want this baby to come out nice and easy.",
      "2. Sift the flour, sugar, cocoa, baking soda and baking powder together into a bowl and mix until well combined",
      "3. In a stand mixer, combine the milk, oil, eggs, and vanilla. With the mixer on low speed, slowly add the dry ingredients until incorporated.",
      "4. With the mixer on low, add the hot water until combined.",
      "5. Pour cake mix into 9x13 cake pan. You will need about 2-3 cups as you do not want a thick cake. You can use the reserve cake mix to make a dozen cupcakes - which is what I did! or to make another small cake.",
      "Bake the cake for approximately 15-20 minutes or until toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Remember, it's not as thick as usual cake so it doesn't need a long time to bake.",
      "6. Allow cake to cool slightly, and turn out onto cutting board lined with parchment or cooling rack. Make sure it does not stick to the board. You'll want it right side up.",
      "Directions to Assemble Marquise:",
      "While the cake bakes/cools, line a loaf pan with cling wrap.",
      "On a sheet of paper, trace the sides of your loaf pan and label them. See \"Related Link\" for a step by step photo tutorial. But what we're looking for is to 'line' the insides and bottom of the loaf pan with slices of cake, and leave the middle open (for the ice cream). Then, cut out the pieces of paper and place them into the pan to make sure they fit!",
      "Once the cake is baked and cooled, turn it out onto a cooling rack or cutting board lined with parchment or wax paper.",
      "Next, place the cut outs over top of the cooled cake and cut out each piece to match the size of the paper cutout. Once they are cut, place them one at a time into the loaf pan - so that you know which is which. Start with the bottom, then place the sides and top side pieces in. You can use your fingers to push it into place and against the sides.",
      "Then, cover the cake/loaf pan with cling wrap and press it firmly in place. Place into the freezer for about 20 minutes to harden and firm up.",
      "Remove the frozen cake 'shell' from the freezer and peel away cling wrap. Using homemade or store bought ice cream, carefully fill the inside of the loaf cake with the ice cream. The ice cream may need to be softened at room temperature for a few minutes. Then place another piece of cling wrap over the top and return to the freezer. It should set for at least 4 hours or overnight. It can stay in the freezer for quite a few days properly wrapped.",
      "Once you are ready to serve it, take off the cling wrap, and place it upside down onto a serving dish. Carefully un-mold it. You can leave it for a few minutes to warm up before cutting. Use a large cake knife heated under water before slicing.",
      "You can eat it plain - or in a saucepan over medium heat, make a raspberry coulis sauce to pour on top."

You also can test out how much of all of those chips you actually need, because I always tend to have leftover chocolate. You'll need to let these sit for a while, maybe an hour or two, to let the chocolate harden. But don't worry, it won't be too hard. They will be soft and delicious!",

      "1. Heat the oil in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat, then add the garlic and curry paste and stir well. Cook for 2-3 minutes, breaking up the large pieces of curry paste with the back of a spoon.",
      "2. Add in the mushrooms and let them brown, stirring occasionally for 2 minutes. Add in the ground beef then use your spoon to break up the meat into large chunks. You do not need to fully brown the meat as it will cook in the broth in the next step. You also do not need to drain the fat, as it adds richness to the broth (however, you may drain it if you prefer).",
      "3. Reduce heat to medium, and add in the broth, green beans, zucchini, lime leaves, fish sauce, brown sugar, salt and pepper. Let the soup come to a boil over medium heat, then cook, stirring occasionally, for 3 minutes or until the vegetables are tender.",
      "4. Turn the heat off and stir in the basil leaves and chili-garlic sauce. Serve with jasmine rice and tomato chunks."

      "1. Lightly butter the bottom of the crockpot, as well as the sides.",
      "2. Lay the apple slices at the bottom of the crockpot. Once you can no longer see the bottom, begin to layer them on top of one another.",
      "3. Combine the brown sugar, flour, rolled oats, nutmeg and cinnamon in a medium sized bowl. Cut the butter into the mixture.",
      "4. Sprinkle the topping (using your hands) over the base of apples. Put the lid on and cook on low for 4-5 hours (mine took 4 1/2).",
