      "If you're icing by hand you may only need one container of icing - but if you're swirling it up with a piping / decorating bag you will need 2-3 containers of icing.",

      "So it's time to bake them.",
      "I've heard people say they have a hard time getting these cuties into the oven without knocking them over.",
      "If you forsee that issue - you can put you're baking sheets/tray in the oven first, and then carefully put each conecake onto the baking sheet.",
      "Just make sure you use your bottom oven rack - and pull the middle rack out before heating the oven.",
      "Bake 15 - 20 minutes or until toothpick in center of cake comes out clean.",
      "Cool & frost.",

      "For the cappuccino semifreddo: Place the egg yolks and 1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons of sugar in the bowl of a mixer fitted with the whisk attachment.",
      "Scrape the seeds from the vanilla bean into the bowl.",
      "Whip for about 12 minutes at medium speed, or until the mixture has lightened and tripled in volume.",
      "Beat in the espresso extract.",
      "Transfer the mixture to a bowl placed in a larger bowl of ice water to maintain its consistency.",
      "In a mixer bowl or a metal bowl, whip the heavy cream with 3 tablespoons of the sugar until it holds its shape when the whisk or beater is lifted.",
      "Fold the whipped cream into the yolk mixture and return the bowl to the ice.",
      "Whip the egg whites in a mixer bowl or metal bowl until they are frothy.",
      "While whipping, add in the remaining 3 tablespoons of sugar and whip the egg whites just until they hold soft peaks, being careful not to overwhip them.",
      "Fold in the beaten egg whites into the egg yolk mixture until they are completely combined.",
      "Spoon the semifreddo into six 8- to 10-ounce coffee cups, leaving at least 1/2 inch at the top for the steamed milk.",

      "Cover the cups with plastic wrap and place them in the freezer until frozen, at least 6 to 8 hours, or overnight.",

      "They can be refrigerated for several hours or overnight, to rise slowly.",

      "If they have not been refrigerated or frozen, they should rise at room temperature in about 15 minutes.",
      "Once proofed, they will have risen to approximately 3/4 inch.",
      "To cook the doughnuts: In a deep heavy saucepan large enough to hold half the doughnuts and holes at a time, heat canola oil for deep-frying to 325 degrees F. Add half the doughnuts and holes to the oil and cook for approximately 30 seconds on the first side.",
      "Flip the doughnuts and fry for 1 minute on the second side, then turn back to the first side to cook for an additional 30 seconds, or until a deep golden brown.",
      "Remove the doughnuts, drain them briefly on paper towels, and toss them in a bowl with the cinnamon sugar.",

      "To complete: Remove the semifreddo from the freezer a few minutes before serving to soften slightly.",

      "Top each doughnut with a doughnut hole.",
