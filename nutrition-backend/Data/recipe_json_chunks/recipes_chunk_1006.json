      "PREP: Place oven rack on middle setting and preheat oven to 350 degrees. If using a less fatty meat, use a non-stick cooking spray to lightly coat the inside of your loaf pan. (If using ground beef, it is unnecessary to spray or grease your pan.). Lightly press the separate 2 tbsp of the packed brown sugar into the bottom of your loaf pan. Put like ingredients into prep bowls for ease in mixing later - this helps when you'll only have one hand (especially at least the dry ingredients of bread crumbs, salt, and pepper). Hint: thaw meat fully and bring cold ingredients (eggs, pasta sauce, sauce ingredients, etc) to room temperature prior to combining - this will aid in even cooking and correct cook time. (Waiting for items to reach room temperature is the bulk of your prep time, so your actual \"work\" prep time v. \"waiting\" prep time is about 5 min of work and 15-20 min of waiting.).",
      "SAUCE: Stir the remaining tbsp of brown sugar and the rest of the sauce ingredients in a bowl until combined. Sauce should be slightly runny. With a spatula, lightly drizzle some rows of the sauce over the brown sugar in the bottom of the loaf pan. Do not fully cover. Set the remaining majority of the sauce aside.",
      "LOAF: In a small skillet, sweat the diced onion over low heat. Half way through, add the garlic. (The onions and garlic do not cook inside the loaf and therefore you must heat them before.) Do not let them brown or carmelize. In a large mixing bowl, gently break up the meat with one hand (keep your other hand free and clean to hold the bowl and add in your other ingredients). When they are cool enough, slowly add in the onions and garlic until completely folded. Then add the pasta sauce, parsley, basil, garlic powder, and marjoram until blended. Next, you will alternate combining the dry ingredients (bread crumbs, salt, pepper combination) and half of the beaten eggs. Repeat dry ingredients and eggs until fully mixed. Shape mixture into a loaf and transfer it into your loaf pan. Gently press the loaf down and against the sides until you have a flat top service (as the meat cooks, it will pull away from the sides and form the classic \"loaf\" shape\"). Pour the majority of the sauce over the top of your loaf and spread it evenly until covered (I like to keep just a tiny bity of sauce to drizzle over the loaf when there is about 10 min of cook time left, but you can add it all at this point if you like).",
      "Bake for 1 hour to 1 hour 15 minutes, checking occassionally. Add more sauce when and if necessary. Let cool for at least 10 minutes before serving."

By giving these cookies away, you may need to be prepared for a marriage proposal on the spot. I have been baking since I was a little one. I was the only girl in a house full of brothers (5 to be exact), so I quickly found my spot in the kitchen. My love affair with baking started with cookies and it is how I won dates in high school by delivering them every Sunday night to my \"friends.\" Love would usually ensue. Now I find joy in baking them for my own 4 little ones and they are my ultimate taste testers in the quest for the perfect cookie. They say we got it years ago so it is about time to share it."

Chop tomatoes roughly, and place into a large pot. Scrape the gel and seeds against the bottom of the strainer with a spoon or your fingers, then discard the seeds. Put all the liquid from the bowl into the pot. In a medium skillet, heat oil over medium heat until rippling in the pan. Add the onion and carrot and saute for 4 minutes or until the onions are transparent. Add the garlic and saute 30 seconds. Add the onion mixture to the tomatoes in the pot, then add the tomato paste, water, chicken base (or you can use chicken bouillon), and the chopped tomatoes, as well as the salt and pepper. Simmer for 15 minutes. Add the basil during the last five minutes. Remove from the heat, stir in the cream, adjust the seasonings as needed to taste. Allow to cool then blend into a smooth puree.

Press each pepper half with your hand to flatten it a bit, then arrange peppers skin-side up on foil-lined baking dish. Rub peppers with oil, then transfer to top rack of oven and broil for 5-10 minutes, until skins are very charred and blistered. Remove from oven and carefully fold the foil around the peppers to form a closed packet. Set aside and let peppers steam for 10 minutes before opening packet. Once peppers are cool enough to handle, peel the skins away from the flesh of the peppers with your fingers. Discard the skins and set the peeled roasted peppers aside.",
      "Make the Mole Sauce: While the peppers are steaming, combine the hot coffee, boiling water, dried cherries, and chopped walnuts in a heat-proof bowl and set aside for 10 minutes to soften the fruit and nuts. After 10 minutes, transfer this mixture to a blender and add the peeled roasted peppers, A1 sauce, chili powder, cinnamon, and brown sugar. Puree the mixture until very smooth, taking care to first remove the center stopper of the blender lid and cover the opening with a towel (this allows steam from the hot liquid to escape while blending).",
      "Cook the Beans: Transfer the mole sauce to a large saucepan over medium heat. Whisk in the chocolate until dissolved, then add the black beans. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer uncovered for 50-60 minutes, gently stirring every so often to make sure the beans on the bottom are not sticking or becoming overdone. The beans are done when the sauce has thickened to a gravy-like consistency that coats the beans nicely. You can serve the beans immediately, though they will keep for several days in the fridge. As the batch is quite large, you can also choose to freeze half of the beans for a later use. To prepare frozen beans, first thaw overnight in the fridge, then reheat gently."

      "Add the beef, pork, and pancetta and cook, breaking up the meats with a spoon and stirring often, until the meats lose their redness, 5 to 8 minutes.",
      "Stir in the wine, tomato puree, and tomato paste and simmer vigorously until the liquid is almost evaporated, 15 to 20 minutes.",
      "Add the beef or chicken broth and the milk, cover with the lid ajar, reduce the heat to low, and simmer gently until you have a rich, concentrated sauce, about 2-1/2 hours. Check every 30 minutes to see if more liquid is needed, adding more broth if necessary to prevent scorching.",
      "Season to taste with salt and pepper, if needed. Let cool. Skim off the fat from the top, if desired. You should have about 6 cups.",
      "Cook the noodles: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Prepare a large bowl of ice water. Slip the noodles, two or three at a time, into the boiling water and cook them until they're tender and pale, 3 to 5 minutes (thinner noodles will cook more quickly). If using dried noodles, cook according to box directions.",
      "Carefully scoop the noodles out of the water with a large wire skimmer and slide them into the ice water to stop the cooking. When they're cool, layer them between clean dish towels until you're ready to assemble the lasagne (they'll keep this way for up to two hours).",
      "Make the cream sauce: In a 2-qt. saucepan, melt the butter over medium-low heat. Add the flour and cook, whisking constantly for 2 to 3 minutes. Do not let the mixture brown.",
      "Slowly whisk in the hot milk and bring just to a simmer, whisking frequently.",
      "Reduce the heat to low and cook, whisking often, until the sauce has thickened to a creamy, gravy-like consistency and no longer tastes of raw flour, 10 to 12 minutes.",
      "Remove from the heat and whisk in the salt, pepper, and nutmeg. If not using right away, transfer to a bowl and press a piece of plastic wrap directly on the surface of the sauce to keep a skin from forming. Plan to use the sauce within 30 minutes because it thickens if it's left to sit for too long. If that should happen, add a little warm milk and whisk well to thin it.",
      "Assemble the lasagna: Position a rack in the center of the oven and heat the oven to 350\u00b0F Choose a baking dish that's about 9x12 inches and 3 inches deep, or about 10x14 inches and 2 inches deep. Butter the baking dish.",
      "Spread 1/2 cup of ragu in a sparse layer on the bottom of the dish. Then cover with a slightly overlapping layer of cooked noodles, cutting them as needed to fill the gaps. Spread one-third of the remaining ragu (about 1-1/2 cups) over the first layer of noodles.",
      "Drizzle on one-third of the Basic Cream Sauce (about 1 cup) and spread it with a spatula or the back of a spoon.",
      "Sprinkle with 1/3 cup Parmigiano. Add a new layer of noodles, overlapping them slightly.",
      "Repeat the layers as instructed above, until all of the filling ingredients are used, to make a total of three layers (you may not need all the pasta). Dot the top with the butter cubes.",
      "Put the baking dish on a baking sheet and bake until heated through and bubbling at the edges, 45 to 50 minutes. Remove from the oven and let rest for 10 to 15 minutes before serving.",
      "Make Ahead Tips: You can prepare the ragu up to four days ahead and refrigerate it, or freeze it for up to one month. Reheat gently until the sauce is warm enough to spread for assembling the lasagne. The assembled, unbaked lasagne will keep for at least a day in the refrigerator. Alternatively, you can freeze it for up to four months (make sure you wrap the dish tightly with plastic). Thaw the lasagne in the fridge and bring it to room temperature before baking."

      "You will need:--A 6 to 8 quart stainless steel pot. Aluminum or cast iron will not work.--A stainless steel or strong plastic slotted spoon.--A two quart microwave safe mixing bowl--measuring spoons--A thermometer which will clearly read between 80 - 120 degrees F.",
      "Prepare your work area: Do not prepare any other food while you are making cheese. Put all food products away. Move all sponges, cloths and dirty towels away from your work surface, wipe your sink and stove with soap and water. Finally use your antibacterial cleaner to wipe down all surfaces.",

      "3. Bake in preheated oven for 20 to 25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the loaf comes out clean.",
      "My Note: I use 1/3 Celsius white and 1/3 Celsius brown sugar, and I let the cornmeal soak in the milk for 10-15 minutes before mixing with the other ingredients. I've also replaced the vegetable oil with melted butter, which works very well.",
      "This works as cornbread muffins, too! I am not a huge fan of making cornbread as a round or square cake shape... they just are too messy that way. Instead I like to pour the batter into muffin tins lined with cupcake/muffin papers. This recipe works great as muffins. I pour the batter almost to the very top of the paper liners then I bake this at 375 degrees, but I have a convection oven so the heat is usually 25*F. less than the normal temperature... so you can cook it at the suggested heat of 400*F. with a normal oven. It takes 20-23 minutes for a toothpick to come out clean. The tops are always nicely browned and the muffins are perfectly cooked. The only other minor change I make is I use a medium grind cornmeal that is a little more course. It makes the cornbread more like a true \"comfort food\". If you don't like that extra crunch then use a finer grind. EVERYONE loves this-.",
      "Additional options: I can bake it in a muffin pan (bake only 15 minutes); I can cut back on my sugar to maybe a round 1/2-cup (or less). I can add just a smidgen more salt. I can add a 1/2 t. vanilla. Add I can also add just a little bit more oil (so it's not quite so crumbly). The next time I bake this for our gang, I'm going to add all of the above.",
      "I did cut down on the sugar a little. (It's still sweet) Delicious with butter and honey on it. Fantastic accompaniment to soup or stew or beans or even makes a great breakfast!"

      "in a small sauce pan add the milk, crushed cardamom pods, and ground espresso. Heat on low setting for approximately 30 minutes, to fully infuse the espresso and cardamom in the milk.",
      "while the milk is steeping measure flour into a stand mixer mixing bowl. once the milk has finished steeping strain through cheese cloth or a coffee filter in a strainer. let milk cool down to warm but not hot. Add the yeast, sugar, and salt to the warm milk and let it sit for 5-10 minutes or until the yeast begins to activate and become foamy.",
      "add the milk mixture to the flour and let mix on stand mixer with dough hook, until all the ingredients come together, about 3-5 minutes on med-low speed. The mixture will be dry and possibly crumbly, do not add more milk. Now, add the egg and let mix for 5 minutes. Add a few teaspoons of flour as needed to keep the dough from sticking to the sides of the bowl so badly, it tends to be a sticky mess once the egg goes inches Next, add the 1/2 cup (1 stick) of room temperature butter and let mix again for approximately 5 minutes. Adding a few teaspoons of flour as necessary to help with sticking. By now the dough should be a tan color from the espresso and moderately soft and springy.",
      "Place the dough in a large, well oiled bowl, cover with plastic wrap and a dish towel and set aside to rise in a warm, draft-free area for approximately 60-90 minutes, or until the dough has doubled in size. Lightly press the down on the dough in the bowl to release some of the air trapped inside. Recover the bowl and place it in the refrigerator for at least 4-6 hours, and up to overnight.",
      "Remove dough from the refrigerator and let sit on the counter for at least an hour, to get back to room temperature. Once dough has warmed up, cut into 3 pieces. Take each piece and press it into a rectangle or oval shape and spread the some of the chocolate chips or chocolate bar pieces in a line down the center, keeping the chocolate and inch away from the edges. Pinch the outside edges closed and shape into a small loaf. Repeat with the 2 remaining pieces of dough. Place loaves, seam side down, on a parchment-lined baking sheet, cover with plastic wrap and a dish towel and let rise until they are 1 1/2 times in size.",
      "Take the remaining egg and a splash of water and beat thoroughly, brush the egg wash on the 3 loaves and decoratively cut or slash the loaves to your liking with a lame or serrated knife. I used kitchen shears to make spiky snips on mine. Bake in a 400 degree oven for 20-30 minutes, turning occasionally, until crust is shiny and deeply colored. Or until the bottom of each loaf sounds hollow when tapped.",
      "Let the loaves cool on metal cooling racks until no longer warm to the touch. Room temperature is best. If you try to eat them hot, just be aware that the chocolate will be liquidy and quite hot. It is best to let them sit at least 2-3 hours after baking. Enjoy these incredibly fragrant and soft coffee rolls with coffee, espresso, or a good, strong black breakfast tea."

    "title": "rosemary christmas tree centerpiece",
    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "Make the Base:",
      "To begin, fashion a central trunk from your green floral foam (Oasis). If you want to use a food-based option, try a conical root like carrot, horseradish, or burdock - that way every part of your centerpiece is edible.",
      "Once you've selected your base material, bore holes with a bradawl or screwdriver. This method will be how the trunk holds the rosemary sprigs.",
      "After boring the holes, push the woody ends of the rosemary sprigs far enough into the trunk so that they won't fall out. Start with larger sprigs at the base and work your way up the trunk adding smaller and smaller sprigs as you go. You can always cut sprigs in half to create the smaller sprigs near the top of the tree.",
      "The height of your finished tree will depend on the length of your trunk (Oasis, carrot, etc.), while the width of your trunk depends on the length of your longest rosemary sprigs at the base of your tree. So if you have six-inch sprigs, the width of your base will be double that.",
      "Once you have worked your way to the top and evenly spaced your branches all around the trunk, your tree will be complete. At this point, take a good look at the shape of it. If it is too wide in places or uneven in any way, don't worry, you can always snip a bit here and there with a sturdy pair of scissors or garden shears.",
      "Once you are happy with the shape, you can begin the decorating. This is a great time to get family, friends or children involved, although they could, of course, be making their own especially if you want more than one tree to decorate the table.",
      "Using toothpicks (or gardening wire of the same length), push the ends through the rosemary into the trunk leaving their points exposed. If your base is small, you may need to cut your toothpicks in half. Space them evenly up and down and around the tree. Then push your decorations onto the exposed points. These ornaments can be whatever you want, from marzipan fruits as listed in the instructions to frosted jellies, candied fruits, chocolates, or any sort soft candy.",
      "Now that you've decorated the tree, you need to finish it off with a star on the top. This can be cut from a candied lemon or orange slice, or as I have used, and listed in the directions, a slice of star fruit.",
      "Having completed your tree, place it on to a round cake plate or chopping board. If your rosemary sprigs go all the way down to the base of the tree, it should stand easily. However, if you have kept the bottom of the trunk clear of sprigs you may need to secure your tree on to a spike by drilling a hole into your base and putting a nail or screw through it. You could also use a glue-style icing one uses when assembling gingerbread houses.",
      "After ensuring your tree is stabilized, you can add more sweets, candies and treats around the base. These candies act as the presents under the tree, while also saving your beautiful tree from hungry hands.",
      "The beauty of this idea is that it can be tailored to your time and budget, and if you don't have a sweet tooth you can always decorate your tree with spices such as cinnamon and star anise to combine with the rosemary and fill the room with Christmas aromas.",
      "Whichever way you choose, the scent of rosemary will fill the home and fill your guests with wonderment and intrigue.",
      "Of course, if you want to take your tree to another level, you can always do what I have done here and build a whole landscape of rosemary sprigs pushed into fondant icing that has been rolled over loaves of stale bread. Nuts and chocolate swirls provided the rocks and fence posts, and a blue bulb in an overhead light bathes the scene in moonlight.",
      "Finally, a dusting of icing sugar over the whole set gives that freshly fallen snow look, creating a feast for the eyes and the imagination at this magical time of year.",

      "Cover and cook on high for 1 1/2 hours. After 1 1/2 hours remove the lid. Using a turkey baster or a ladle, remove all excess liquid that has pooled in the crock pot (the zucchini will let off quite a bit of liquid) and place it in a shallow frying pan. Bring the liquid to a boil and simmer for about 5 to 7 minutes or until reduced into a thick creamy sauce. Pour the sauce over the top of the lasagna in the crock pot and serve."

      "To make the ganache drizzle: Heat the heavy cream in a 2-quart heavy-bottomed saucepan until bubbles begin to form around the edge of the pan. Place the chopped chocolate in a medium-size mixing bowl. Make a ganache by pouring about half of the hot cream over the chocolate and letting it sit for 30 seconds to melt the chocolate. Then, slowly whisk until smooth and homogenous. Do not add all of the hot cream to the cold chocolate at once. The shock of the temperature extremes will cause the fat in the chocolate to separate. If the ganache separates, it loses its elasticity, collapses, and becomes very liquid. I use a hand-held immersion blender to ensure a smooth ganache and to keep the emulsion of the chocolate. Add the remaining cream gradually and mix until all of the hot cream is incorporated and the ganache is smooth and homogenous.",

      "Remove the cakes from the oven and cool on a rack for at least 20 minutes before using a small paring knife to free the sides from the pan and removing the cake.

Ideally, you will time this to coincide with the sugar syrup reaching 248\u00b0-250\u00b0 F, the Firm Ball Stage. If your whites reach stiff peaks before the sugar syrup reaches the correct temperature, reduce the mixer speed to the lowest setting and leave running until the syrup is ready.",

Remove the saucepan from the heat and slowly pour the hot syrup down the side of the bowl into the egg whites, being very careful to avoid allowing the stream to hit the whisk and spatter. Pour slowly and steadily until all the syrup has been added, and continue beating the meringue until it becomes light and fluffy and holds its shape exactly when the beater is removed, roughly 3-5 minutes.",
      "After this time, the meringue may still be hot-if so, place the bowl in the refrigerator (or freezer) for 8-10 minutes until it has cooled all the way through.",
      "When the meringue has cooled, place the bowl back on the mixer, replacing the whisk with the paddle attachment. Begin mixing on low, and add the butter 1/4 cup (half a stick) at a time, beating well after each addition. Once the butter is added, increase the speed to medium and beat the buttercream until it becomes light and fluffy. It may look soupy or curdled shortly after all the butter is added-this is okay! Just keep on beating it and it will whip up into a light, fluffy cloud.",

Then, using the second-smallest cutter, cut a round out of the middle of 2 more gingerbread rounds (these layers will create the trunk of your tree), leaving just 1 last layer whole. Discard the small rounds you've removed (read: snack away!).",
      "Use the 8 larger cutters to cut green rounds out of the green eggnog layers, cutting 2 small rounds out of each layer once you get to the 4 smaller sizes to economize on space. You should wind up with 8 total green rounds of varying sizes. This time, reserve the small rounds, and snack on the scraps left from the layers they were cut from.",
      "Take the cutter that's two sizes smaller and place it gently on top of each green circle. Press lightly to mark the top of each green circle, and using that as a guide, gently trim the edges of each round at an angle.",
      "Insert each angled green round into its properly-sized gingerbread layer to keep everything organized, and to prepare for building the cake, arrange your stack of layers stack so the gingerbread layer with the smallest, empty hole goes at the bottom, and then the layers should go from smallest to biggest green round, the opposite of how it will appear when it's finally stacked with buttercream to look like a tree. Top it off with the 2 \"trunk\" layers, and finally the single whole layer. Wrap the stack in plastic and refrigerate until you're ready to use it.",

      "Tip: If the buttercream looks broken at any point, microwave for 3 seconds at a time once or twice, mixing by hand each time to re-incorporate.",
      "Stack Your Cake:",
      "Place a small dollop of buttercream on the cake plate or drum you're using as a base and center the single whole cake layer on it. Spread a thin layer of plain, un-colored buttercream on the layer and then place one of the 2 \"trunk\" layers down. Add another layer of plain buttercream, this time icing around the hole cut out of the middle of the slice.",
      "Stack the second \"trunk\" layer on top, use plain buttercream to add a layer of filling, then pipe your brown buttercream into the hole created by those two layers. Fill it a little above the top, then level it with your spatula.",
      "Now, begin to add your green tree layers. Starting with the layer with the largest green insert, place it on top of the \"trunk\" layers with the angle you've cut into the edges sloping down. Pipe a ring of plain buttercream around that sloped cake to seal it, then smooth it, trying not to get any plain buttercream on the green part of the cake.",
      "Now you'll add your Christmas lights! Cut off a very small bit of the tip of your red, blue, green, and yellow piping bags to leave a small hole, and pipe concentric rings of color on top of the green part of the layer, switching up colors as you go and leaving space between each ring. Fill in the gaps with your green, and very gently smooth that section of buttercream down. Add plain buttercream to the gingerbread portion of the layer and smooth to create one level layer of buttercream, then place your next largest green layer on top.",
      "Continue this process until you run out of green layers. You'll be left with a gingerbread layer with the smallest hole cut into it, but no green cake inside. Fill this gap with yellow buttercream to represent the start at the top of the tree, and smooth out. Ice over the top with a very thin layer of plain buttercream to seal that yellow in, then refrigerate the stacked cake.",
      "Ice Your Cake:",
      "Once your cake has had 15-20 minutes to chill, trim the sides if you'd like.",
      "If desired, you can also start icing the cake by doing a light coat of plain, un-colored buttercream over the whole cake so that when you apply your colored buttercream you don't have to use very much.",
      "Using your leftover blue (perhaps cutting a bigger hole in the tip of your piping bag) and your 1.5 cups pinky red, pipe alternating rings of buttercream around the sides of the cake, keeping in mind that you have more red than blue so keep the red sections about 2-3 times taller. It doesn't need to be, and in fact shouldn't be, perfect, since a little unevenness is in keeping with Dr. Seuss' aesthetic!",
      "Pipe a large dollop of red on the top of the cake and, using a small offset spatula, smooth it down.",
      "Using a very tall straight edge (you can use a quilting ruler if you don't have a cake scraper tall enough!), smooth down the rings of color on your cake, keeping the scraper level so you don't muddy up your layers of color.",
      "When you're happy with that, clean up the top of your cake if you need to and refrigerate.",
      "Finishing Touches:",
      "Use an Ateco tip 849 (or any large star tip) and any leftover green buttercream to pipe ruffled puffs around the top of the cake, making pretty buttercream \"trees.\" Pipe a little yellow dot at the top of each tree.",
      "You can also finish the bottom edge of the cake with a little yellow pearl border like I did, or leave it, your call! Get creative!",
      "Now you can slice your Seussian masterpiece to reveal your sneaky surprise inside, a stunning Christmas tree that will warm the heart of even the grumpiest of grinches this holiday season!"
