Cover and leave for 10 minutes, then lightly oil a patch of worktop and knead the dough for 10 seconds. Return to the bowl and leave to rise for an hour, if you can giving it one or two brief kneads during that time.Butter the inside of a large loaf tin and shape the dough into either two balls or a rolled-up sausage and place smooth side up in the tin. Leave to rise by half, flour the top, cut a slash down the middle and bake at 180C (160C fan-assisted)/350F/gas mark 4 for 50 minutes. Remove from the tin as soon as it's baked and leave to cool."

Finish it with the zest. When -mounting- the butter, the butter must be very cold and it helps to have the butter cut up. As you are whisking (and it's constant) you would do well to move the pan on and off the heat, keeping the sauce \"finger hot\". To make a really stable sauce, one can pre-reduce the cream and then chill, resembling something like Noxema Cold-Cream. One can also fill a vacuum thermos (very clean, no coffee residue) with very hot water, then pour out the water and pour the sauce into it, holding the sauce at the corect temerature. If the sauce does -break- (seperate)... you can resuce the efforts by using a hand-prep blender or, you can add mustard (a natural emulsifier) and still have a very tasty sauce."

Melt butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the pears and cook, stirring until the sugar dissolves and juices simmer, about 2 minutes. Reduce heat to medium, and cook, uncovered, until the fruit softens and the juices evaporate some, about 10 minutes. Add the strawberries. Evenly mix in flour. Then cook about a minute more to thicken the juices more. Stir in the vanilla and lemon zest; and remove from the heat. Cool completely and set aside. Roll a disk of pie dough into an 11 to 12-inch circle. Transfer the dough to 9-inch glass pie pan, trimming so it hangs over the edge. Fill the crust with the fruit. Roll the remaining dough into a 12-inch circle. Brush the rim of the crust with some of the egg. Roll the dough onto the rolling pin and unroll it over the fruit so it hangs over the edge of the pie pan by about 1/2-inch. Fold the top crust edge under the bottom one, then press together to seal. Refrigerate the pie for at least 20 minutes. Meanwhile, heat the oven to 425 degrees F. Brush pie with egg and sprinkle sugar. Cut 6 to 8 small steam vents on top. Place pie on a baking sheet and cook for 15 minutes, then reduce to 375 degrees F. Bake until the crust is golden brown, about 50 minutes more.

In a saucepan, dry roast ( pan fry ) the spices until fragrant. Grind the spices until fine powder then divide into 2 portions. Mix one of the spice portion with the lamb along with minced ginger and garlic. Boil the lamb with a cup of water on low simmer for about an hour until the meat is tender. In a casserole, heat the olive oil and ghee. Add the sliced onions, shallots and saute them until they are soft and caramelized. Tip in the remaining spices and tomatoes. After around 5 minutes add in the lamb pieces (without the water) followed by rice. Add in 6 cups of liquid (lamb broth and water) into the rice, followed with salt and lemon juice. Cook on low medium heat until the rice is cooked and fluffy. Alternatively, you can tip everything into a rice cooker and let the rice cooked. Garnish with coriander leaves, fried shallots, pistachios and raisins upon serving."

Repeat twice more to make 3 gallons of brine. Set aside for 4-5 hours at room temperature to allow time for the flavors to infuse the brine. Rinse turkey thoroughly, and submerge in the brine. Place container in the refrigerator. Brine the turkey overnight for about 12 hours (or about 1 hour per pound).",

      "Step 2 -Smoking:",
      "",
      "Remove the turkey from the brine and rinse thoroughly in the sink with cold water. Pad dry. Rub olive oil on the outer surface. Be careful to not damage or tear the skin more than necessary since the skin will protect the meat from drying out while cooking. Toothpicks can help hold the skin in place. Heat your smoker to 225 - 235 degrees F. Use an oven thermometer in the smoker since most thermometers that come with the smokers are usually of poor quality. Place the turkey in the smoker with the breast side up. Smoking takes about 30 - 40 minutes per pound. Use about 3 to 4 fist-sized handfuls of wood chips throughout the smoking process. You don't want the turkey to be overpowered with smoky flavor. You can baste the turkey with a little melted butter a few times as it smokes. As you near the end of the cook time, begin checking the temperature of the turkey. Always check in several locations and use the lowest temperature. Watch the wings and breast, and if they start to get too brown you can cover them with some foil. When the thickest part of the thigh reaches 170 degrees, and the breast about 160, it's time to remove the turkey. Allow 15 - 30 minutes to cool before carving. This allows the juices and smoke flavor to evenly disperse throughout the meat as it cools."

      "First, season or marinate your chicken breast however you like it. I love using come Cajun Seasoning, it spices it up just right. Try marinading it in Lawry's marinades, they are inexpensive and quick. They have great flavors like Carribean or Garlic Lime. Saute the whole breast for about 4 minutes on each side or until juices run clear. Leaving it whole takes longer, but the chicken will be more moist. If you are pressed for time, you can cut up the breast into chunks, then saute it. (The chicken can be baked on a rack, for a low fat option). While chicken is cooking, begin chopping your green onion. Sent them in a small bowl to the side. Next, start layering your salad ingredients. This order works best: Salad Greens, Mandarin Oranges, Croutons, then Almonds. After your chicken breast is finished, decide whether you want it in chunks or sliced. I prefer to chop it into bite size chunks, it makes it easier to eat. Add the chicken pieces atop your assembled salad, and garnish with the green onion.",
