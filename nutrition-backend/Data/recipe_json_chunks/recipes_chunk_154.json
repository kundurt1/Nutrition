You may have to add a little water from time to time to keep them from sticking. Now put the chicken and sausage back in the pot along with all the water and the tomatoes. Add seasonings to your desired taste. When mixture comes to a rolling boil, add minute rice. When this reaches a good boil again, stir well and lower heat; cover and let cook until rice soaks up all the liquid. This should take about 20 to 30 minutes. Stir as little as possible."
