      "If not, wait another day or two, continuing to aerate at least twice a day, until it becomes active and doubles in size.",
      "(If the seed culture was active and bubbly prior to entering this phase, it could become active and bubbly in this stage in less than 24 hours.",

      "When the starter is fermented, degas it by kneading it for a few seconds, then form it back into a ball, cover tightly, and refrigerate.",
      "After a few hours in the refrigerator, vent any carbon dioxide buildup by briefly opening the lid or plastic wrap.",

      "You can even start with as little as 1 ounce (28.5 g) of mother starter and rebuild it in increments over a number of feedings, using the same ratios as for a 4-ounce (113 g) batch.",
      "For example, after a few weeks in the refrigerator, the protein and starches will break down, giving the starter a structure or consistency of potato soup.",
      "This is okay; the microorganisms are still viable, though fairly dormant (and maybe even a little drunk on the alcohol theyve produced, which rises to the top and looks like gray water).",
      "To rebuild your mother starter, use 1 ounce (28.5 g) of mother starter and add 3 ounces (85 g) of flour and 2 to 2.25 ounces (56.5 to 64 g) of water.",
      "This will produce about 6 ounces (170 g) of starter.",
      "You can then build all or part of that into a larger piece using the same ratios: 100 percent flour, 33.3 percent starter, and 66 to 75 percent water.",
      "So for 6 ounces (170 g) of starter, use 18 ounces (510 g) flour (6 multiplied by 3) and 12 to 13.5 ounces (340 to 383 g) water (18 multiplied by 66 percent or 75 percentlower hydration for all white flour, higher hydration for all whole grain flour).",

    "title": "blueberry bundt cake recipe",
    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "I made this cake this week...not exactly low-cal, but it was unbelievably board, and I'm sorry which I do not have a more exact source.",
      "But it is TNT, and will most definitely be again!",
      "The recipe was a bit vague, so I'll write what I did, and the few minor changes/additions I made.",
      "See my note at the end.",
      "Mix all ingredients, except for blueberries, together well.",
      "Mix in blueberries.",
      "Pour into a bundt pan and bake at 350.",
      "Notes: (including glaze at the end)",
      "I sprayed the pan with Pam and it was a non-stick bundt pan.",
      "It needed it...either which or possibly I'm sure greasing and flouring would work too.",
      "However, do what works best for you, because my pan is new, and with PAM I never have a problem... cakes just slip out...but this seemed a bit stubborn.",
      "I had to tap fairly hard on the top of the pan to loosen it.",
      "It didn't break, and came out in one piece, except for a small bit where the tube was which didn't show, and while the cake was warm it was moist sufficient to pat back into place.",
      "So, just a warning which this could be one of the more difficult to get out... especially because where the blueberries tended to sit was delicate.",
      "I wouldn't wait more than 10 min to get it out of the pan though.",
      "Also, I didn't just mix it.",
      "I put it in my electric mixer and beat it for about 1 1/2 min...or possibly till the lumps of cream cheese disappeared.",
      "I used a 12-c. bundt pan.",
      "I wouldn't recommend anything smaller.",
      "The cake filled up which pan and went pretty high over the edge, and just made it!",
      "A 10-inch tube pan would work well too.",
      "I baked it for about 50 min.",
      "Which seemed to work for me...a knife (I use a turkey lacing metal thingy) inserted in center should come out clean.",
      "I let it cold in the pan on a rack for about 10 min.",
      "I then put the rack on the top of the cake and turned the whole thing over and knocked on it till it came out.",
      "While it was warm it seemed pretty delicate, but when it cooled the cake was pretty hard.",
      "Also, I didn't have canned blueberries...I used a pint (minus a handful from earlier which day :) ) which I tossed with some flour to coat before folding them in.",
      "I do not know what the difference would be in using canned, but this came out pretty good..would probably try the canned when the blues aren't in season.",
      "I do have to admit which most of the blueberries did sink to the bottom of the pan, although there were a few which stayed suspended.",
      "I might one day try, instead of folding in the berries, to sprinkle them on top after I put the batter in the pan.",
      "If anyone has any hints on how to keep them from sinking like which, I'd appreciate the input!",
      "Last but not least: It is wonderful just the way it is...has a wonderful, rich flavor.",
      "But I also made a glaze with about a c. (maybe a bit more) of confectioner's sugar, 1/4 tsp almond extract, 1 tsp.",
      "or possibly so of amaretto, and water till I got it to glaze consistency.",
      "After glazing the cooled cake, I sprinkled some minced almonds on top before it dry.",
      "By the way...For some reason I can't stand the taste of artificial almond extract...and I found some natural extract.",
      "This is not an advertisement...I don't work for this place...only buy from them!",
      "But I thought I'd share it...someone here on the list did a while back, and I called for their mail-order catalogue and have purchased spices from them...and now would not buy anywhere else.",
      "You can buy in small to large quantities, their selection and prices are excellent (almost half what I would spend in the supermarket...most of the spices have a small size, about the size of the McCormick's small bottles, which run between 89 cents to $2 and change...cannot beat which!)",
      "and the quality is unbelievable.",
      "Especially their China Cassis cinnamon..that was what the person who posted about it here recommended, and I tried which, along with other things.",
      "The company is called Penzys, Ltd., and they are located in WI.",
      "The is wonderful.",
      "It gives very detailed descriptions of the products, pictures, and has recipes also.",
      "Everyone I know who's seen my catalogue has"

      "Step 1: Rice and Water Proportions, Rinsing, and Cooking",
      "The proper rinsing of the rice is important for its final flavor and appearance.",
      "Pour the rice into a fine-mesh strainer, large enough so you can freely toss and turn the grains.",
      "Have at hand a larger bowl into which the strainer can easily fit and fill it with cold tap water.",
      "Pour the rice into the strainer, then lower the strainer into the large bowl so that the water covers the rice.",
      "With both hands, gently rub, turn, and toss the rice.",
      "Do not press the grains too hard against the strainer or against one another, or the fragile grains may break, especially if you are using a lower grade of rice.",
      "The water will instantly turn milky white, so remove the strainer from the large bowl, discard the water, and refill the bowl with fresh cold water.",
      "Return the rice-filled strainer to the bowl and repeat.",
      "On the second rinsing, the water will look only slightly milky.",
      "Repeat once or twice more.",
      "When you have finished, the water will be almost clear, but do not expect 100 percent clarity.",
      "Drain the rice and let it sit in the strainer for 10 minutes.",
      "Transfer the rice to a heavy-bottomed pot that is deeper than it is wide and has a heavy, tightly fitting lid (during cooking, rice swells to as much as two and a half times its original volume, so your pot should be at least three times deeper than the level of the rice and water), add the water, and let it sit for 20 minutes.",
      "Set the rice over medium heat and cook, uncovered, until the water is nearly absorbed by the riceabout 10 minutes.",
      "Quickly reduce the heat to very low, cover the pot with the lid, and cook until the rice is plump and cooked throughanother 10 minutes.",
      "The exact cooking time depends on the heaviness of the pot, the level of the heat, and the quantity and condition of your rice.",
      "After a total of 20 minutes cooking, take a quick look: the rice should be completely transparent.",
      "If you see any dry, very white-looking grains, sprinkle a little warm water over the dry spots and cook another couple of minutes or so over very low heat.",
      "During the cooking, never stir the rice.",
      "After confirming that all the rice gains are transparent, immediately put the lid back on before the built-up steam can escape.",
      "Turn off the heat and let the rice stand for 5 minutes.",
      "Cooking Rice Using a Rice Cooker",
      "If you own a rice cooker, follow these guidelines.",
      "Use the cup that came with your rice cooker, which is about four-fifths the volume of a U.S. cup.",
      "Omit the usual presoaking; it makes the rice too tender when you are using a rice cooker.",
      "Dont follow the usual water line in the bowl of your rice cooker.",
      "Instead, use the guidelines above.",
      "Today, some rice cookers have a special built-in sushi rice cooking function.",
      "If using, add water to the level designated for cooking sushi rice.",
      "Cook the rice according to the manufacturers instructions, usually for 50 minutes.",
      "Step 2: Sushi Vinegar Dressing and Sushi Rice Preparation",
      "While the rice is cooking, put the rice vinegar, salt, and sugar in a bowl and stir with a whisk until the sugar and salt are almost dissolved.",
      "If you are using a Japanese sushi-oke (wooden sushi tub) and shamoji (flat wooden paddle), soak them in a bath of cold water for half an hour while the rice is cooking (dry wood will absorb a good portion of the sushi vinegar dressing, and the rice will stick to the wood).",
      "Grain the water and wipe the tub and paddle with a dry kitchen towel.",
      "If you are using a large unfinished wooden salad bowl, moisten it just before using (soaking for a long time might cause it to crack).",
      "Other bowls made of metal, glass, or porcelain can be substituted, but they tend to make the sushi rice watery, mushy, and lumpy.",
      "Transfer the steaming hot cooked rice all at once to the sushi tub or salad bowl.",
      "Quickly and gently break up the rice, crisscrossing it with the side of your paddle.",
      "Pour the prepared vinegar dressing evenly over it and, with the paddle, break up the lumpy clumps and turn the rice over, working one area at a time.",
      "Repeat once or twice until you can tell by looking that the vinegar dressing is roughly distributed throughout the rice.",
      "Push the rice toward one side of the tub.",
      "Now hold the paddle horizontally and insert the paddle into the rice in one area, then rapidly move it back and forth with many small stroked.",
      "By cutting into the rice this way, you are breaking up the clumps and pushing a portion of rice toward the opposite side of the tub.",
      "Now work on he remaining areas of the rice one at a time in the same way, until you have moved all of the rice to the other side of the tub.",
      "Rotate the tub or bowl 180 degrees and repeat the process.",
      "You can see at the end of the second cutting that each grain looks evenly plump, when all the vinegar dressing has been evenly absorbed.",
      "The whole procedure should take about 2 minutes.",
      "Whit a hand fan or with a magazine or folded newspaper, fan the rice for about 30 seconds.",
      "This quick fanning gelatinizes the surface of the rice to give it a glossy appearance and also cools it, helping the vinegar dressing to settle inside each grain.",
      "Sushi rice, if it is prepared in a large quantity, tends to remain rather hot, even after being fanned.",
      "If so, let it cool to a temperature of 104F, covered with a moist kitchen cloth to prevent it from drying out."
