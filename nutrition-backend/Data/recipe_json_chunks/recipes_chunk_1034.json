My friend Ron, the mastermind behind Herb Farm informed me that fermentation can sometimes stop before it is complete, meaning it's \"stuck.\" This can happen when there aren't enough micronutrients for the yeast. You increase the chance of success by using whole buds because it adds more micronutrients, but you will have a slightly more bitter wine. I'm okay with that, I like a little bitter. But if you're not, try the petals only. This will require more picking and separating.",
      "Note #2: Pick dandelions from an open field far from any insecticide spraying, and if you can, pick early in the season when the leaves of the plant are still tender. Newly opened flowers are also ideal."

Add the ground potatoes and onion to the Sponge and stir until blended. Add the stale roll, flour, salt, baking powder, and ground pepper; mix or pulse only until incorporated. Add the oil and egg and mix well. Drop the mixture out into 3 well-greased 8- or 9-inch loaf pans. Each loaf should weigh about 15 ounces. Leave room for expansion - the potatonik will rise in the oven.",

Let cool on a wire rack covered with a cloth for 5 minutes to allow the loaves to steam. Invert and tap out onto the rack. Serve warm. DO AHEAD: Potatonik can be refrigerated for several days or frozen for 1 to 2 weeks. Reheat at 325 F until warm. When reheating, I like to bake it for 35 to 45 minutes to develop a hard crust.",
      "Steam in Baking: Place an empty roasting pan or other heavy pan on the floor of the oven 5 to 10 minutes before baking, so it gets hot. Brush the tops of the loaves with water, place in the oven and carefully toss 6 to 8 ice cubes into the hot pan, or pour in 1 cup boiling water and immediately close the oven door. CAUTION: When using boiling water, wear a glove and keep your face away from the open oven door, since there will be a burst of live steam when the boiling water hits the hot pan. Do not open the door to peek or the steam will escape."

      "On a baking sheet brushed liberally with olive oil, stretch the dough to desired shape and thickness. Brush the crust with olive oil and top with the mozzarella slices. Bake the pizza until the dough crisps up and cheese is melted, about 15 minutes.",
      "Remove the pizza from oven. Top the melted mozzarella with the grated Parmesan and sliced chicken. Toss the romaine hearts with the Caesar Salad Dressing and season with salt and pepper. Top the pizza with the Caesar salad and shave over some Parmesan. Serve and enjoy! (See Cook's Note).",
      "Caesar Salad Dressing:",
      "In a blender or food processor, process the Parmesan, mayonnaise, lemon juice, olive oil, mustard, Worcestershire, salt, pepper, garlic and anchovy until emulsified and smooth. Refrigerate until ready to use.",
      "Simple Pizza Dough:",
      "In a liquid measuring cup, combine the warm water, yeast and sugar. Allow the yeast to dissolve and bloom, about 5 minutes. Once bloomed, add the olive oil.",
      "Meanwhile, in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine the flour and salt. Stream in the water/yeast mixture and as the dough begins to come together, switch to a dough hook attachment. Allow the dough to knead, adding a bit more flour if needed, so that the dough releases from the sides of the bowl, 1 to 3 minutes. You should be able to touch the dough and not have the dough stick to your fingers. Once the dough has kneaded and has pulled away from the sides of the bowl, remove the dough from bowl to a floured work surface and, with floured hands, continue to knead it by hand for 1 to 2 minutes. Then form the dough into a round ball and place it into a large bowl sprayed with nonstick spray. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a clean dish towel and let the dough rise in a warm area of your kitchen until it doubles in size, 1 1/2 to 2 hours. After the dough has risen it is ready to be cooked however you'd like!",
      "This dough is wet dough, keep bench flour at the ready and make sure to flour your hands when working with the dough. Trust your gut as a chef, if the dough is to wet, add more flour, if it is too stiff, add a little water.",
      "Sugar is used to feed the yeast which will help the dough to grow. Bread flour will give you a chewier texture because the flour has more gluten. You don't need to use a thermometer to get the water temperature, it should just feel warm to the touch.",
      "Cook's Note:",
      "If you don't have a pizza stone at home, no worries, use a well-oiled sheet tray and a hot oven to achieve a crisp bottom on your pizza! Also place the dough on the very bottom rack of your oven. It will help to create that crispy crust."

      "MAKE THE COOKAROLIS: Cut cookie dough in half lengthwise and place onto a long sheet of plastic wrap (about 2 feet). Place one half of the dough into the center, then place another sheet of plastic wrap loosely over top. Roll out cookie dough into a 4\" wide strip 1/4\" thick. Lift off top sheet of plastic wrap and discard. Place 3-4 chocolate morsels in a group onto the bottom of cookie strip 1/2\" apart.",
      "Using the top part of the plastic wrap, fold top half of cookie strip over filling. Using your finger, gently press between and bottom the cookaiolis to seal. Holding the ends of the plastic wrap taut, place the strips onto a cookie sheet and freeze till needed. Repeat with the other half of cookie dough.",
      "MAKE THE PASTRY DOUGH: In the bowl of a food processor, combine the flour, baking powder and salt. Pulse for a few seconds and then pour into a large mixing bowl.",

      "Lightly flour your hands and the countertop and turn the dough out onto the countertop. Knead the dough ball, folding over about 12 times. Divide dough in half. Roll each half out to 6\" wide strips and about 1/8\" thin.",
      "Remove cookarolis from the freezer and separate them into individual pieces using a knife or pizza pie cutter. Place cookarolis onto the dough 1/4\" apart on the bottom half of the dough. Brush the edges of half of the dough lightly with the egg wash (remember egg wash sticks to dough, but not itself). Fold top part of dough over and separate (using a pizza cutter works well) and then gently seal the edges together with the tines of a fork, dipping the tines into some flour as needed. Repeat with second ball of dough. Place on cookie sheet and refridgerate for a minimum of 30 minutes. NOTE: at this point, they can be frozen on the cookie sheets, then placed into a ziploc bag and frozen for up to a year till needed.",
      "DEEP FRY: Heat oil in a deep fryer to 350\u00b0F Carefully fry in batches for about 3 minutes until just light brown. Drain on paper towels. When cooled (about 5 minutes), dust with powdered sugar. Serve immidiately but be careful, as filling may still be hot."
