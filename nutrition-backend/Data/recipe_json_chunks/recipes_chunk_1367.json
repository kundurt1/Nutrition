Nuts](https://www.ohnuts.com/buy.cfm/kosher-for-passover-cakes-cookies/new-burger-buns-4-pack)-you can also skip them and eat the brisket bowl-style over rice (if you're not Ashkenazi and avoiding kitniyot, also known as rice, corn, and legumes) with the sandwich fixins on top.

    "title": "eighteen-layer brazilian guava cake roll (bolo de rolo)",
    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "Measure ingredients for the batter and set aside.",
      "Prepare the filling. Add guava paste, water, and port, if using, to a non-stick medium pan and bring to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring well until guava paste is fully melted and mixture is homogeneous and smooth. Strain through fine mesh sieve if chunky. Remove from heat, let cool, and divide into 9 portions. Set aside.",
      "Next, prepare the batter: In the bowl of a mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat butter at medium speed for about 2 minutes. At a slow speed, gradually add the sugar, then beat for 3 to 5 minutes, or until mixture is homogeneous and creamy. Add the yolks one by one, beating at low speed after each addition until just incorporated.",
      "At low speed, gradually add flour until you have a homogenous batter. You may have to scrape down the batter from the sides of the bowl a few times.",
      "With a spatula, gently fold in the egg whites (do not beat). Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0 F.",
      "Grease and flour 9 (10- by 15-inch) jelly roll pans and pour about 1 cup of batter into each. (If you are short on baking sheets, you can wash and dry the baking sheet, repeating the process of unmolding and rolling as described below as each layer of cake bakes.)",
      "Use an offset icing spatula to spread the batter into a very thin and uniform layer covering the bottom of each sheet pan. Bake the first layer of cake for 3 1/2 to 4 minutes; do not let the cake brown.",
      "Remove from the oven and place baking sheet on a counter lined with a kitchen linen or towel. Since this cake is thin and delicate, here is a great technique to release it from the pan without breaking the layer: Gently run a butter knife around the edges to loosen the cake from pan, making it easier to unmold. Next, sprinkle the top of cake with 2 tablespoons of sugar and spread a kitchen towel on top. Then place an empty and larger baking sheet pan on top of this, right side up, to sandwich the cake and towel between the two pans. Finally, flip the whole assemblage over in order to release the cake from the pan in which it was baked. Remove what is now the top baking sheet pan, and then gently slide the bottom pan from beneath the cake and towel. Working quickly, spread melted guava paste mixture on top of the cake and then roll: Starting from one end, pull up the two adjacent corners along the short length of the towel to initiate rolling of the edge of the cake. Continue supporting/pushing the rolling edge of the cake with the towel beneath as needed until the cake layer is completely rolled. The cake rolls more easily while still warm. Reserve rolled cake layer covered with towel.",
      "Each rolled cake is then rolled into the next subsequent sheet of cake that has been spread with the guava paste. If any breaks appear in cake, press break with fingers to seal while it is still warm, and sprinkle more sugar on top. Slice the 2 edges of the cake to remove rough, imperfect ends. Serve cake roll sliced into thin slices by itself, with a slice of Edam cheese, or slightly warm with a scoop of vanilla or coconut ice cream.",
      "NOTES: 1) For easier handling, you can make 3 smaller cake rolls using the same recipe: To do this, make three rolls with three layers each. 2) Guava paste is available in the Latin aisle of many different supermarket chains such as Walmart, as well as in virtually any Latin market. Alternatively, the guava paste filling can be substituted by thin layers of Nutella or dulce de leche/caramel spread.",
      "STORAGE: You can store in the refrigerator for about 1 week, or at room temperature, covered in parchment paper or plastic wrap, for up to 3 days. Cake can be frozen for up to 1 month."

Ultimately, you'll probably cook this for about 20 minutes.",

      "While the burgers are frying, take out a clean plate and lay 3-4 paper towels on it. You will be using this to drain the excess oil from the burgers. At this time, you can also chop your lettuce, slice the onion/tomato, and toast your buns. But don't forget the burgers and check on them often.",
      "When the burgers are evenly browned, remove from the pan/fryer and place on the paper towels to drain any excess oil. Let sit for at least 2-3 minutes prior to serving as the cheese inside of the patty will be very hot and can cause burns.",

      "Prep Your Ingredients: Thoroughly wash the leeks, removing the tough outer layer and trim the bottoms and cut off the dark green leafy parts. Reserve the tops for another use. Thinly slice crosswise. Trim the mushrooms and cut into bite sized pieces. Halve the lemon and cut one half into slices and juice the other half. Wash the sea scallops and remove the side muscle, pat dry and season with pepper (and salt, if desired).",
      "Melt the Leeks: Melting leeks takes about thirty minutes, so while your leeks are cooking, you can work on preparing the other parts of the meal. In a non-stick or well-seasoned cast iron skillet, heat two tablespoons of butter and one tablespoon of olive oil. Once smoking, add the leeks and season with salt. Reduce the heat to medium low and cover. Continue cooking, stirring occasionally, for thirty minutes. If, during the cooking process, you notice the pan starting to dry up, add a touch of olive oil. You know the leeks are ready when you try a bit and they melt in your mouth.",
      "Make the Couscous: While the leeks are cooking, prepare the couscous. First, heat two tablespoons of olive oil in a high-sided pan over medium high heat. Once shimmering, add the couscous, adjusting the heat as necessary to keep the couscous from burning. Cook, stirring frequently, until the couscous is toasted and golden brown. This takes about 4-5 minutes. Add the 1-1/2 cups of liquid (water or chicken stock) and reduce the heat to a simmer. Cook for about 10-12 minutes or until all the liquid is absorbed and the couscous is tender. If you notice the couscous is drying out, add more liquid during the cooking process. Season with salt and pepper to taste.",
      "Crisp the Mushrooms: Remove the couscous from the pan and set aside. Carefully wipe out the pan and heat two teaspoons of olive oil. Once shimmering, add the mushrooms and cook over medium heat until browning on the bottoms, about 3-5 minutes. Add the lemon juice and the parsley. Coat the mushrooms in the lemon parsley mix and then add the couscous back to the pan and mix well. Set aside and keep warm.",
      "Make the Scallops: Once the leeks have finished cooking, remove them from the pan, draining off and discarding any excess oil, and mix into the couscous mixture. Keep warm. Wipe out the skillet and heat a tablespoon of butter and a tablespoon of olive oil. Once the butter is frothy and just short of smoking, gently add the scallops, spacing them out so they don't touch each other. Cook, without moving, for 1-1/2 to 2 minutes. Flip and cook for an additional 1-1/2 minutes. The scallops are cooked once they have firmed up slightly and have a golden crust on the top and bottom.",
      "Plate it Up: Divide the warm couscous mixture into two bowls and top with the scallops. Serve with a lemon wedge. Enjoy!"

      "In a medium bowl, combine the sugars and spices and stir to combine thoroughly. Add the melted butter and mix until the everything is combined and looks like wet sand. Set aside.",
      "Put an oven rack in the upper middle position and preheat the oven to 425\u00b0F. Get out a 9-inch (23 cm) nonstick circular cake pan. If your pan is pretty good about not sticking, you can skip the next step. If your pan tends to stick, grease the bottom and sides with a bit of butter. Out of the way of your workspace, set a wire cooling rack over a piece of wax paper (for cooling and icing the gooey buns later).",
      "In a large bowl, combine the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and spices and stir to mix. In a large glass measuring cup or small bowl, add 2 tablespoons of the melted butter to the buttermilk and stir. Add these liquid ingredients to the dry ingredients and stir for about 30 seconds, just until the dough comes together (it will still look shaggy). Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured counter and knead gently just until it's smooth and uniform.",
      "Using your hands, gently pat the dough into a 12-inch (30 cm) by 9-inch (23 cm) rectangle. Brush the dough with the remaining 1 tablespoon of butter, leaving a 1/2-inch (1 cm) border around the edge. Sprinkle the filling mixture evenly over the dough, leaving a 1/2-inch (1 cm) border around the edge of the dough. Cut the apple into a small dice and sprinkle evenly over the filling. Press the sugar mixture and apple pieces down so they stay put.",
      "Using a bench scraper or metal spatula, loosen the dough from the counter. Starting on the long edge, roll the dough into a tight log, pressing gently as you go to keep it neat. Roll the log over so the seam side is facing down and cut the log in half, then cut those two pieces in half, then cut each of those four pieces in half so that you end up with 8 evenly-sized pieces. As you pick up each piece, press the open (swirly) sides lightly between your palms to make sure the filling doesn't fall out as you transfer each piece to the pan. Set the first piece in the center of the pan then arrange the other 7 pieces evenly around the perimeter.",
      "Bake the rolls for about 20-25 minutes, or until they are golden brown on the edges. As soon as they come out of the oven, run a rubber spatula around the edge of the pan, then invert your cooling rack over the top of the pan and flip the whole thing right side up over your wax paper. The filling will be gooey and very hot, so be careful. Don't wait to get the rolls out of the pan though, or the goo will turn to glue and the rolls will be stuck in the pan.",
      "To make the icing, while the rolls are in the oven (or just after they come out), sift the powdered sugar into a medium bowl (I find putting the sugar through a fine mesh strainer breaks up those little lumps that otherwise refuse to melt into the icing). Whisk in the milk and vanilla extract, adding milk a few drops at a time if the consistency isn't smooth enough to drizzle over the rolls. The icing will dry out a bit if it sits for a long time uncovered, so you may need to add a drop or two more milk if that happens.",
      "Once the rolls have cooled for about 5 minutes, use a spoon to drizzle the icing over them. Serve immediately, but be super careful with the molten hot core of each roll, which is always about 15 times hotter than the outside pieces."

      "Scrub the apples and cut the fruit into quarters. Leave the skin in tact and place them in a large dutch oven, cover with the 6 1/2 cups of water. Bring this up to a slow boil and simmer on low for about 35 minutes (the apples should just be starting to fall apart). Get out a container that you can plase the chinois over. Pour this mixture into your chinois and use the wooden tool (or back of spatula) to press all the juice out of the mixture. You will then take this juice and strain it again. I use a smaller strainer and take a wet piece of cheesecloth and pour the mixture through again--this ensures the jelly will be clear. Now take 4 1/2 cups of this mixture and place in your preserving pan--add the sugar and lemon. Bring this mixture up to a boil and continue to hold there until your thermometer reaches 221. You can skim as you go. Once you reach 221, shut the fire and let it rest for 5 minutes. Go back now and turn the fire back up to reach 221 degrees. In my experience, this ensures a good gel. Pour this mixture into 8 oz jars, seal and process in boiling water bath for 10 minutes. You should have 6 jars and you will be using one for the Cherry Pinot Grigio Recipe!",
      "Place the 3 pounds of cherries into a non-reactive container, add sugar and lemon and cover and let this macerate overnight. The next day, pour out this mixture into your preserving pan and add 1/2 cup of the Pinot Grigio. Bring this mixture up to 219, stir all along the way to avoid sticking and burning. Once the mixture has reached 219, add the 8 oz jar of Granny Smith Apple Jelly to the mixture. Stir and bring this up to 221. Once the mixture is holding at 221/222 add the balance of the 1/4 cup of Pinot Grigio to the mixture, this will naturally cut the foam and give it a fresh \"winey\" taste. Shut the fire and skim the foam off the top. Pour into your jars and process in a hot water bath canner for 11 minutes. This jam is fabulous as a dessert topping, scone topping or quick bread mix, glaze for pork--so many uses!"

Because there is a lot of sauce you don't have to pre-cook them and they also absorb some liquid from the tomato sauce, which is why you need this much tomato sauce. I don't know if in the U.S you can find these large pasta tubes. If you can, use them by all means, it's much easier then making them out of lasagna. You just fill them with a small spoon or preferably with a piping bag, until the whole tube is filled with meat, then put them on the tomato sauce, cover with tomato sauce, some bechamel and bake for 30 minutes.",
      "Tomato Passata: In Italy we have 2 different kinds of tomato sauce - one is Passata and the other is Pomarola. The Passata is fresh tomatoes, peeled and passed through a vegetable mill so you have in fact raw tomato juice. You can make it by processing canned peeled tomatoes with the liquid that comes in the tin - as easy as that! The Pomarola, or tomato sauce, is made with passata as a base, but is cooked with olive oil, onions, garlic, bay leaf, thyme, basil and sometimes some celery, salt and pepper. It is then cooked for about 45 minutes to reduce and obtain a thicker sauce that is already finished."

Tip: If you don't have an electric mixer, wrap a dampened kitchen towel around the bowl so it's stabilized. Now you have an extra hand to drizzle oil without having to hold the bowl in place.",
      "Begin adding the oil slowly, whisking continuously to incorporate before adding more. Tip: Use a measuring cup with a pour spout to add the oil. If you add oil too quickly or add more before it incorporates, it can break. Once the oil and egg emulsify you can add the oil a little more quickly. The mayonnaise should gradually become a pale yellow and begin to stiffen.",

      "Taste and then season the mayonnaise with salt and additional lemon juice as desired. Homemade mayonnaise should be used within 4-5 days, store in a very clean covered container in the refrigerator."

      "Add the pasta water and two tablespoons of butter (butter is optional but delicious) to the sauce and cook for about 10 more minutes until the liquid is slightly reduced and thickened. Add baby spinach and shrimp (raw or cooked...if raw, you'll need to add a few minutes of cooking time.) Once the spinach has wilted and the shrimp are cooked through, add pasta to the sauce and toss with tongs until well coated.",
      "Divide pasta between plates and arrange tomatoes, mushrooms, and shrimp on top. Add a few parsley leaves or parmesan cheese as garnish (if desired.) Enjoy!"

      "To make the whoopie pies: Center a rack in the oven and preheat the oven to 350\u00b0 F. Butter or spray a whoopie pie pan; you might want to do this even if your pan is nonstick. Or if you're making whoopie pies without a pan, line a baking sheet with parchment paper.",
      "Sift the flour, cocoa, baking soda, baking powder and salt together into a medium bowl.",
      "Working in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, or in a large bowl with a hand mixer, beat the butter at medium speed until soft and creamy. Add both sugars and beat until well blended, about 2 minutes. Add the egg and beat for 2 minutes. Beat in the vanilla. Reduce the mixer speed to low and add the dry ingredients alternately with the milk, adding the dry ingredients in 3 additions and the milk in 2 additions. Mix only until the dry ingredients are incorporated and you've got a thick, smooth, silky batter.",
      "Using a small cookie scoop with a capacity of 2 teaspoons or a teaspoon measure (in which case you'll want to scoop out rounded spoonfuls), fill each of the whoopie molds with batter -- don't bother smoothing it because it will spread under heat-or place dollops of batter on the baking sheet, making sure to leave about 2 inches of space between the mounds of batter. You'll have to work in batches, so cover the leftover batter and set aside.",
      "Bake for 8 to 10 minutes, or until the cakes puff and spring back when poked lightly; a toothpick inserted into the center should come out clean. Transfer the whoopie pie pan to a rack and wait for 5 to 10 minutes, then gently lift the cakes out of the molds. Or, if you baked the cakes on parchment, slide the paper off the baking sheet onto a rack and let the cakes cool to room temperature before gingerly lifting them off the paper.",
      "Continue to bake whoopie pies -- always making sure the pan or baking sheet is cool -- until you've used all the batter. Allow the cakes to cool to room temperature before filling them.",
      "To make the filling: Working in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, or in a medium bowl with a hand mixer, beat all the ingredients together on medium-high speed until soft, fluffy and smooth, about 3 minutes.",
      "To fill the whoopie pies: Using a piping bag with a plain or star tip or a spoon, put about 1 tablespoon filling on the flat side of half the cakes. Top with the other halves, flat side down, twisting the tops gently just to make certain that the pieces are \"glued\" together.",
      "To glaze the whoopie pies: This is an optional step, but it makes the pies look like a true French pastry. Put the chopped chocolate in a medium microwave-safe bowl and heat it for about 90 seconds at 50% power. Bring the cream to a boil. Pour the cream over the chocolate and let it sit for 30 seconds, then gently stir the mixture, starting at the center of the bowl and working your way out in ever-widening concentric circles, until you have a smooth, glossy ganache.",
      "Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. One by one, dip the tops of the whoopie pies into the ganache, twirling each pie slightly as you lift it out of the chocolate, so that the excess drips back into the bowl, and place glazed side up on the baking sheet. When all your pies are dipped, refrigerate for about 30 minutes, or just long enough to set the glaze.",
      "Serving: Since I've never seen a soul, young or old, drink a glass of milk in France, it's unlikely les francais would enjoy les whoopies with milk. A shame, since the dark devil's food cake is so good with milk. I leave it to you, milk or not, and if not, I'd suggest a shot of espresso.",
      "Storing: Best the day they're made, the whoopee pies -- without the filling and glaze -- can be wrapped airtight and frozen for up to 2 months. Defrost in the wrapper."

If you want to be meticulous, you can first spread on a crumb coat (a very thin layer of frosting on the entire cake), chill the cake for a half hour, then top it off with the remaining frosting. I rarely do this as I am too lazy to do so unless my cake is for someone else - sorry family, you don't get a crumb coat.",

Put the tray in the freezer for 20 minutes to let the centers firm up completely.",

Microwave it for about a minute and a half to completely melt it. Stir it well to make sure it is completely smooth. Line another sheet tray with another silicone mat or parchment paper. Roll each of the centers in the melted chocolate to coat them. Use a fork to fish them out so that the excess can drip back into the bowl. Nudge the coated centers off of the fork with a toothpick onto the sheet tray and use the toothpick to score around the truffle so that there isn't a big blob on the bottom of them. When all of the centers are coated, sprinkle them all with the lime sea salt on top. Put the tray in the refrigerator to let the chocolate coating completely harden. When you are ready to serve them, put them in a pretty bowl and let them sit for 15-20 minutes at room temperature so that they aren't rock hard. Then enjoy the decadence!"

When the pan is smoking hot, add the green onions and grill for 5 to 6 minutes, turning halfway through, until black and burnt all over. (Alternately, you can broil the scallions or use a gas or charcoal grill.) Set aside to cool, then finely chop. Transfer the onions to a bowl and add the cream cheese, sour cream, the remaining tablespoon of olive oil, the roasted garlic puree, and 1/4 teaspoon of salt. Mix well and set aside until ready to use.",

(The frying chiles can make you cough, so it's helpful to turn on a fan!) Add the kale, along with 1 1/2 teaspoons of salt and a good grind of black pepper, and cook for 3 minutes-you might need to do this in two or three batches, depending on the size of your pan-stirring often, until the kale is cooked but still retains a bite.

      "Transfer the dough to a lightly floured or lightly greased work surface, knead it gently, then divide it in half. Round each half into a loose ball, and allow the balls to rest, covered, for 10 to 15 minutes. This allows the gluten in the dough to relax, making the focaccia easier to shape.",
      "Roll one ball into a 10- to 12-inch circle. Place it on a lightly oiled baking sheet or pizza pan (or onto a peel dusted with cornmeal if you'll be baking the focaccia on an oven stone). Top the shaped round with the filling ingredients, spreading them evenly over the surface, and leaving about 1 inch crust bare around the edges. Roll the second half of dough into an equal-sized circle, then place it atop the filling. Press the edges of the dough together firmly to seal the two circles.",
      "Cover the focaccia with a damp cloth, lightly greased plastic wrap or a proof cover. Preheat your oven to 425\u00b0F. Allow the focaccia to rise for 45 minutes, or until it's noticeably puffy. Just before placing it in the oven, dimple it (poke gentle indentations into it) with your fingers, brush it with 1 tablespoon olive oil, and sprinkle it with coarse salt and rosemary. Bake the focaccia for 30 to 35 minutes at 350."

(You can also use cherry or grape tomatoes if it's going to sit for a while - cut tomatoes tend to wither faster). Great with fresh herbs from the garden, using up the abundance of basil is a favorite in our house. Delicious with day-old bread cubed and tossed in for a panzanella. Vegan as it stands, you can transform it into a more substantial lunch dish by adding tiny fresh mozzarella peals, shaved stravecchio, a briney feta, or your favorite cheese. Did I mention that it's versatile?"

As the recipe uses a fair amount of oil and there is quite a bit of salt in both the olives and feta cheese, the loaf stays good for around a week (!).

      "When it's hot, place the chicken, breast side down, in the pot and let it brown, about five minutes. Then, gently flip the chicken to brown the other side too, and, at the same time, add your carrots, celery and onions.\r\nYou want the bird to be golden with darker brown spots on the thighs and high points of the breast, the vegetables to have darkened in spots and the onions to be moving towards translucent.",
      "At that point, add the bay leaves, chicken stock, lemon zest, allspice and cinnamon. Grind some fresh pepper over everything and then stir to combine the spices and zest with the stock. Bring the soup to a boil, cover loosely with the pot's lid (slightly askew), and then reduce the heat such that you can maintain a gentle simmer. Cook for an hour, flipping the chicken periodically during that time.",

You want the bird to pretty much fall apart: the meat will not slide off the bones, but the wings, thighs and perhaps even the spine will break apart with just the slightest push.",
      "I usually cook my soup for 90 minutes or a bit more before adding the noodles, at which point I also add some water because the noodles will otherwise suck up too much of your excellent broth. Before you add the water and noodles though, taste the broth: can you taste the richness of the added spices? Feel free to add more cinnamon or allspice if you like.\r\n\r\nRemove the chicken. While it cools, add the noodles and water. While they cook, debone, de-skin and shred the chicken.",
      "When you've finished removing all chicken meat from the carcass, return it to your soup. Remove the bay leaves and if need be, season to taste with salt and pepper. Chop and add any celery leaves you've reserved. \r\n\r\nYou can eat this right away, but I like to let it cool slightly, skim excess fat from the top of the soup, cool in the fridge and reheat later. It freezes well and lasts in the fridge for a good four days."

      "In a large skillet for which you have a good tight lid, cook the bacon over medium heat until it's a nice mahogany color. Drain the slices on a paper towel and pour off all of the fat, except about 1 tablespoon, into a small bowl or jar. Keep it near the stove, as you'll need it soon. Do not wipe out the skillet.",
      "While the bacon is cooking, prepare the cauliflower by cutting off the florets. Keep them separate as you cut the stems into one-inch pieces. They are more dense, requiring more time to soften, so they need to be cooked separately at first.",
      "Once you've removed the bacon, put the cauliflower stems into the skillet, given them a good stir, add a pinch of salt, and cook over medium heat, stirring frequently, for a few minutes. Add a little water - about 1/4 cup - and put the lid on. Set your timer for 4 minutes, but check about half way through, stirring the stems around just a bit and putting the cover back on without delay. They should be getting a light brown glaze from the bacon drippings and small bits left in the skillet. If the pan seems too dry, add a bit more water but immediately put the cover back on.",
      "After another minute or so, add the cauliflower florets, garlic, cloves (garlic's best friend) and fresh marjoram; stir well. Add 1/2 cup of water and cover the skillet. Let it cook for about five minutes, checking quickly after 2, and adding a bit more water if it seems dry.",
      "While the cauliflower is cooking, cut the cooled, crisp bacon into 1/2\" squares. After the cauliflower has cooked for 5 minutes, remove the lid. If there is a lot of liquid in the bottom, reduce it by turning up the heat to cook it for a minute or so, stirring frequently.",
      "Set aside 12 or 15 of the larger floret pieces. This is optional. I like a bit of textural variety in dishes like this, but if you want to skip this detail, that's fine.",
      "Put all of the remaining cooked cauliflower, garlic, cloves and marjoram into a food processor, scraping the skillet well to get all of the little pieces. Pulse firmly five or six times. Scrape down the sides and pulse a few more times. You want to mash it all up well, but not to make a puree. Allow it to cool for a few minutes, stirring occasionally to facilitate that.",
      "Heat the skillet over a medium flame and pour at least two tablespoons of bacon fat back into it. Add the bread crumbs and cook for about a minute, stirring constantly to coat well. Add about 2/3 of the bacon pieces and stir well to incorporate.",
      "In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, feta, ricotta, cream, thyme, nutmeg, parsley and black pepper, along with the remaining 1/3 of the bacon pieces. Add the mashed vegetables from the food processor and stir well to combine. Gently fold in the reserved florets.",
      "Pour into the gratin dish; then sprinkle with the grated parmesan. Cover with the bacon-y bread crumbs.",
      "Bake on the middle shelf of your oven for 30 - 40 minutes, until the bread crumbs are a nice toasty brown. (If baking well in advance, so that you'll be refrigerating the dish, don't sprinkle on the bacon-y bread crumbs. Cover tightly with a lid or foil. Bake for about 30 minutes and let cool covered. Bring to room temperature before baking; sprinkle on the bread crumbs, bake in the upper third of your oven until the crumbs are brown.

      "Heat milk in a small saucepan over medium heat, just until small bubbles start to form. Remove from heat, and after 3-4 minutes skim off the skin that formed on the surface of the milk. Place milk, 6 tablespoons melted butter, salt, and sugar in the bowl of your stand mixer, and whisk to combine. Allow to cool until just warm to the touch (about 100 degrees F), then whisk in yeast and eggs.",
      "Add flour to bowl; using dough hook, mix on low speed on standing mixer until combined, several minutes. Increase speed to medium-low and knead about 3 minutes more; when pressed with finger, dough should feel moist but should not stick. If dough is sticky, add an additional 1 to 3 tablespoons flour in 1 tablespoon increments until dough is no longer sticky. This is a soft dough, so err on the side of less flour. Continue to knead on medium-low until dough is elastic, 4 to 5 minutes longer. Dough should clear the sides of the bowl, but still stick to the bottom.",
      "Transfer dough to lightly floured work surface. Knead dough by hand 1 to 2 minutes. Dough should be very soft and moist but not overly sticky. If necessary knead in additional flour one tablespoon at a time. Form dough into a ball. Lightly oil medium bowl with canola or other neutral oil. Transfer dough to bowl and roll it to lightly coat with oil, then cover bowl with plastic wrap. Let dough rise in warm, draft-free location until doubled in volume, 2 to 3 hours.",
      "While dough is rising heat olive oil and butter over medium-low heat until butter stops foaming. Add diced shallot and sugar, and cook until golden brown, stirring occasionally. Transfer shallots to a paper towel-lined plate and set aside at room temperature.",
      "Once dough has risen lightly coat two 9-inch round cake pans or one 9 by 13-inch baking pan with canola oil and set aside. Turn dough out onto very lightly floured work surface. Pat dough into rough 12 by 10-inch rectangle, gently pressing out air; one long end of the rectangle should be toward you. Sprinkle dough with shallots and herbs, leaving about 1 and 1/2 inches of dough clear at the edge closest to you. Starting from edge farthest from you, tightly roll dough into 12-inch long cylinder. Using palms, roll dough back and forth until cylinder is about 17 inches long and of even thickness. Using bench scraper or chef's knife, cut into even sized pieces, each end piece should be about 1 & 1/2 inches thick, and the rest of the pieces should be about 1 inch thick.",
      "Working with one piece at a time and keeping remaining pieces covered with plastic wrap, pinch cut edges on each side together, top to bottom to help embed the shallots and herbs. Set piece of dough on unfloured area of work surface. Loosely cup hand around dough (think of your hand as a cage); without applying pressure to dough, move hand in small circular motions, until a tight ball forms. A few pieces of herbs or shallot may pop out of the rolls in the process; just discard them. Arrange shaped rolls in prepared cake pans, with one in the center and 7 equally spaced surrounding it for the round pans or 3 rows of 5-6-5 for the 9 by 13. Cover pan(s) with lightly oiled plastic wrap, then cover pan(s) securely with foil. Refrigerate overnight, preferably 24 hours, and up to 48 hours.",
      "Remove foil (but not plastic wrap) from pan(s); let rolls rise in draft-free cool room-temperature location (about 68 degrees F) until doubled in volume (rolls should press against each other). This should take 6-7 hours. The slow rise allows the rolls to rise more consistently centers to edges, and creates lighter, fluffier rolls. When rolls are nearly doubled in volume, adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 400 degrees. Remove plastic wrap. Brush rolls with 2 tablespoons melted butter and gently press sage leaf on top of each roll if desired. Bake rolls for 10 minutes, then quickly rotate pan(s) 180 degrees, and bake until deep golden brown, an additional 5-8 minutes. Cool rolls in pan(s) on wire rack about 3 minutes, then remove and cool rolls on wire rack an additional 10 to 15 minutes. Take care when transferring them, as sage leaf decorations may fall off. Break rolls apart and serve warm.",
      "Note: Alternate, less appropriate for a dinner-roll, but very yummy filling: Peel and 1/4-inch dice 1 firm ripe d'Anjou or Bartlett pear, Saute in butter over medium-high heat with 1 tsp sugar, until brown. Pear should still have some texture. Sprinkle dough with pear, 1 - 1 &1/2 tsp chopped fresh rosemary, and 2 oz. of bittersweet chocolate, also 1/4-inch dice."

If using a Dutch oven, turn stove to medium-high heat (5 on my stove) and keep covered (although you may need to turn down once oil gets hot). Set up a baking sheet topped with a cooling rack near your frying station. Cover the rack with a few paper towels.",

Fry chicken until cooked and golden brown, about 6 minutes. As you remove the cooked chicken with tongs, squeeze out excess oil (over fryer or Dutch oven). Place on paper towel covered rack. Continue until all the chicken is cooked.",

      "Sprinkle coated pieces with sesame seeds and serve immediately with your favorite beer. These are best piping hot, although are also good cold (just not crispy).",
      "Note: You can also roast the marinated wings and drumettes (omit cornstarch) on a lined baking sheet in the top third of a 450 degree oven for 10 minutes, turning after 5 minutes. Finish under the broiler for about 2-3 minutes. Coat in sauce as in step 6. These are lovely, although I personally prefer the crispier skin from frying."

      "Special equipment: 13- by 18-inch rimmed baking sheet, parchment paper, stand mixer with whisk attachment or handheld mixer, sifter or sieve, offset spatula, clean cardboard.",
      "To make the sponge cake: Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F/180\u00b0C, and place a rack in the middle of the oven. Line the baking sheet with parchment paper.",
      "Using the stand mixer or the handheld mixer and a medium bowl, beat together the egg yolks, 1?4 cup (50 g) of the sugar, and the lemon juice on high speed for at least 6 to 8 minutes if using the stand mixer or 10 to 12 minutes if using the handheld mixer, or until thick and doubled in volume. Stop the mixer once or twice and scrape down the sides of the bowl and the whisk to ensure the sugar and yolks are evenly mixed. Transfer to a large bowl and set aside.",
      "Clean the bowl and the whisk attachment or beaters (they must be spotless) and beat the egg whites on medium speed for 2 to 3 minutes with the stand mixer or 4 to 6 minutes with the handheld mixer, or until soft peaks form. The whites will start to froth and turn into bubbles, and eventually the yellowy viscous part will disappear. Keep beating until you can see the tines of the whisk or beaters leaving a slight trail in the whites. To test for the soft-peak stage, stop the mixer and lift the whisk or beaters out of the whites; the whites should peak and then droop. With the mixer on medium speed, add the remaining 3/4 cup (150 g) sugar very slowly, a spoonful or so at a time, taking about 1 minute to add all of the sugar. Continue beating on medium speed for another 2 to 3 minutes, or until the whites are glossy and shiny and hold a stiff peak when you slowly lift the whisk or beaters straight up and out of the whites.",
      "Using a rubber spatula, gently fold about one third of the whipped whites into the yolk mixture to lighten it. Then gently fold in the remaining egg whites. Sift the flour and salt together over the top of the mixture and fold in gently until the flour is completely incorporated. Pour the batter into the prepared baking sheet.",
      "Using the offset spatula, carefully spread the batter evenly to cover the entire baking sheet. Concentrate on spreading the batter toward the corners and edges of the pan. The center will be easier to fill once the edges are filled with batter. Don't worry about the top being perfectly smooth; it is more important that the batter be spread evenly so that the cake is the same thickness throughout. Bake the cake for 18 to 24 minutes, rotating the baking sheet back to front about halfway through, or until the top is pale golden brown and springs back when pressed in the center with your fingertips and the cake doesn't stick to your fingers. Let the cake cool in the pan on the wire rack for about 5 minutes.",
      "Line a large cutting board with parchment. Run a paring knife around the edge of the still-warm cake to release it from the sides of the baking sheet, and invert the cake onto the parchment. Carefully peel off the parchment and allow the cake to cool completely. Using a chef's knife, cut the cake in half crosswise and then in half lengthwise. You should now have four cake layers, each about 5 1/2 by 8 inches. Cut the cardboard so that its dimensions are just slightly larger than the cake layer dimensions.",
      "To make the soaking syrup: In a small bowl, stir together the coffee and sugar until the sugar has dissolved.",
      "Using the pastry brush, brush the top of all four cake rectangles evenly with the soaking syrup, using up all of the syrup.",
      "Place one cake layer, syrup-side up, on the prepared cardboard rectangle. In a medium bowl, using a mixer or a whisk, whip the heavy cream until it holds very firm, stiff peaks. Fold in the pastry cream (see separate recipe) until well combined. Using the offset spatula, spread about one third of the cream mixture over the cake layer. There is a tendency for the cream to mound in the center, so be sure to spread the cream out to the edges of the cake. In fact, to make the best-looking cake possible, it is better if the cream layer is slightly thicker along the edge than in the center.",
      "Place a second cake layer, syrup-side up, on top of the cream layer and press down gently so the cake layer is level. Using the offset spatula, spread about half of the remaining cream mixture over the cake layer. Again, you want to spread the cream a bit thicker along the edge of the rectangle to prevent the final cake from doming.",
      "Place a third cake layer, syrup-side up, on top of the cream and press down slightly to level the cake. Using the offset spatula, spread the remaining cream mixture over the cake, again making it a bit thicker along the edges than in the center. Top the cake with the final cake layer, syrup-side up, and press down gently so that the top layer is flat. Lightly wrap the cake with plastic wrap, place in the freezer, and freeze for about 8 hours or up to overnight, or until it is frozen solid. (At this point, the cake can instead be put into the freezer just until it has firmed up and then it can be well wrapped and frozen for up to 2 weeks.)",
      "At least 3 hours in advance of serving, remove the cake from the freezer and place it on a cutting board. Using a chef's knife dipped in very hot water, trim the edges of the cake so that they are neat and even. (These trimmings make for great snacking.) Dip and wipe the knife clean several times as you trim to make sure you get a neat, sharp edge on the cake. Trim the cardboard underneath so it is flush with the cake.",
      "Place the cake on its cardboard base on a cooling rack set on a baking sheet. Pour the warm ganache (see separate recipe) over the top of the cake. Using the offset spatula, spread the ganache in an even layer. It will begin to firm up right away when it hits the cold cake, so work quickly to even the surface. Let the excess ganache drip down the sides of the cake, leaving some parts of the cake exposed. Let the ganache set for several seconds, then transfer the cake to a serving plate. Let the cake thaw at room temperature before serving."

Cook for 1 to 2 minutes, until the egg whites are barely opaque. The eggs will continue to cook once they're off the heat and it's important to remove the pan at this point to prevent the mixture from drying out. Again, it's a personal decision: If you like very soft, wet eggs, take the mixture off the heat immediately after incorporating the eggs into the tomatoes.",
      "To serve, spoon into individual bowls and top with chopped parsley, fried sujuk, and beyaz peynir. Menemen is traditionally served with simit, a Turkish sesame bread ring, but feel free to substitute that with any bread of your liking."

      "Kefir grains are live, active cultures that look like little pieces of cottage cheese or tiny cauliflower (see photo above). You can buy them online or get some from a friend if you're lucky enough to know anyone who has some. You can also try to finding a Facebook fermentation group (I belong to one called \"Boston Culture Sharing\") to see if people in your area are willing to giving away any for free. Craig's list is a good resource, too; I've sold quite a few starters (sourdough, kombucha, kefir, etc.) there. If you just want to buy online, I suggest either Cultures for Health or the Kefir Lady, which is where I got my grains years ago.",
      "When you get the grains-you'll probably have about teaspoon or so-place them in a strainer and rinse with filtered water.",
      "Put the rinsed grains in a glass jar and cover with about one cup of pasteurized milk-I use whole, organic, pasteurized milk. DO NOT use ultra-pasteurized milk. It is too \"dead\" for the grains to ferment.",
      "Cover the jar with a cloth and secure with a rubberband. Allow the jar to sit at room temperature for about 24 hours; you can stir it once or twice if you like but it's not necessary. The milk will be undergoing fermentation during this time, a safe process that can only happen at room temperature, not in the fridge. Have a little faith in the safety of this-kefir dates back centuries! (Legend has it that Mohammed gave kefir grains to the Orthodox people and taught them how to make kefir. It is still widely consumed today throughout Eastern Europe and Asia.)",
      "You'll know the kefir is done when the milk doesn't swish around when you move the jar. It will seem thick toward the top, and you may also see small pockets of whey (clear yellow liquid) start to separate out-that's a tell-tale sign it's ready (see first photo in series above). If you see more whey than milk, you have let it ferment a little too long. It is totally safe to consume, but will just be a bit more tangy.",
      "Place a strainer over a large bowl and dump the contents into it. The resulting (strained) liquid is your kefir, and the grains in the strainer are now ready to be used again. Place them back in the (rinsed out) jar, cover with fresh milk, and repeat the process.",
      "Use the strained kefir right away, or refrigerate until needed. It lasts for weeks, if not longer, in the fridge (though it does get more tangy over time, as fermentation slows, but doesn't stop completely).",
      "For smoothies: Blend kefir + whatever fruit/veg you like in a blender or food processor. I find that the best smoothies always have at least some frozen fruit in them, which makes everything extra thick and creamy once blended. My favorite is 1 frozen banana + 3/4 cup wild frozen blueberries + 2 cups kefir (and sometimes a scoop of Green Superfood powder, available on Amazon). If the mixture looks too thick, just dilute with milk, water, or, my favorite, coconut water.",
      "Consume smoothies immediately, or within a few hours at most. Real kefir is so alive that it will begin feasting on the sugars in the the fruit pretty quickly, so after a few hours, most of the smoothie's sweetness will be gone. I always drink immediately.",
      "Some Final Notes:\r\n-The kefir grains talked about here are also known as \"milk kefir grains.\" They can ferment dairy as well as non-dairy milk (such as coconut milk, which is excellent). \"Water kefir grains\" are different and are used to culture sugar-water instead of dairy. They can be found online at all of the places listed above. I've experimented with them, but prefer kombucha over water kefir in terms of non-dairy, fermented drinks. //\r\n-Avoid using any metal utensils or bowls when making kefir, as it can react negatively and produce off-tasting flavors. (A metal strainer is fine since you're only using it for a minute.) //\r\n-Your first batch of kefir may take a bit more time to ferment, as the grains need to adjust and acclimate to your house and the milk you're using. //\r\n-Your grains will grow in size and multiply as you keep using them, and as they do, they will be able to culture larger amounts of milk. A tablespoon of grains can culture at least 2 to 3 cups, sometimes more. If you find you can't keep up, just give some grains away or discard a bit. //\r\n-If your kefir is too strong for your liking, try fermenting for only 12 hours, or add some fresh milk to an over-fermented batch and let things balance out. It takes some experimentation to get it how you like it."

      "DAY 1\r\n\r\nMarinade for the Meat\r\nMake Marinade - Look to First Ingredient List. Mix together the marinade ingredients ( Tamarind Pulp, Sugar, Coriander, Cayenne, Chili Powder, Salt, Garlic and Canola Oil) and rub all over the meat. Leave in a ziploc bag for at least 3 hours or if possible overnight in the fridge.",
      "Pulses\r\nIf you are not using dried Chickpeas and Black Beans do not worry about soaking overnight. However if you are then you need to soak overnight. Rinse thoroughly next morning and boil until soft. Do them separately as the black in the beans will taint the colour of the chickpeas.",
      "Prepare Veggies \r\nCut the Pumpkin into Wedges ready for roasting. No need to peel skin off. Rub oil, salt, pepper and chili powder all over. Eggplants go in whole. Bake in the oven at 350F until soft. The eggplant should be almost mush and the skin browned. If the eggplants still feel relatively in tact cook a little longer. Once done remove from oven and remove rinds from the veggies. Cut pumpkin into small pieces and don't worry about the eggplant as it will disintegrate into a fleshy mess. Just make sure to remove all skin from the eggplant. \r\n\r\nDice the onions and tomatoes, grate/mince the ginger and finely chop the garlic, shallots and the chilies. If you have a blender then puree the garlic, ginger,chilies and shallots together. It may need a little water for assistance.\r\n\r\nMeasure out your pulses and beans except the sprouted mung beans. \r\n\r\n\r\nPrepare Spice Blend\r\nPreparing your spice blend can be done in advance too. If you have the time great but if not don't panic. It can be done during Day 2.\r\nMix the Spices together\r\nIt is important that the Cumin and Coriander are roasted first before you blend the rest of the spices together. Cumin and Coriander have to be roasted and ground separately. I usually do this in larger batches as it is a pain to always have to do. Take your biggest frying pan and if you have an outdoor burner it is best to do outside as this tends to smoke and the aromas released from the spices are very pungent. Always do the cumin first as this is the stronger smelling of spices. Fill the bottom of the pan with the cumin seeds and once they start popping and turning colour they are ready to be removed. Place in a bowl and allow to cool first. Then repeat with the coriander. Keep the spices separate. The seeds roast in no time usually no more than 5 minutes from start to finish. Once cooled place the seeds in a spice/coffee/vita mix grinder and grind until you have a fine texture. Place in air tight glass jars and leave in your cupboard for up to six months. \r\n\r\nOnce the cumin and coriander are ready, take the black little seeds from the cardamom pods and mix with the rest of the spices (not cinnamon sticks). Using your spice grinder or coffee grinder blend into a powder.",
      "Day 2 (after the meat has marinated)\r\n\r\nCombining the Ingredients\r\nFirst add ghee to the pan, enough to coat the onions. Place onions in the pan and cook until caramelized. Then add garlic/ginger/chili/shallot mixture. Stir for 2 minutes. Now add tomatoes and spice blend. Don't forget the cinnamon sticks. Mix well. Now add the meat and coat well. Then add the pumpkin and the eggplant. Now add the chickpeas and the black beans. Now add the pulses and 2 cans of 14oz fire roasted tomatoes and a cup or so of water (alternatively you can make or buy a lamb stock and use this as your liquid instead of the cans of tomatoes and water). You want enough liquid for the lentils to cook and soak up plus some extra for simmering. Simmer on low and stir often for 5 hours or so until the meat is falling off of the pieces with bones. Cool and refrigerate. \r\n\r\nThe next day remove all bones from the pot best you can. Reheat and once at a simmer add the sprouted mung beans (optional). They need about 6-8 minutes to cook. Once they \"sprout\" they are cooked. Just before serving cut up spinach/kale and mix through. Top with coriander once cooled and add lime juice and rind. Probably a little more salt will be needed at this point. If you want it spicier add some cayenne but be careful as a little goes a long way.\r\n\r\nThis is great served with chutneys and Poppadoms. I make my own chutneys but of course you can buy them. I highly recommend mango chutney, Pineapple Chutney or tamarind and date chutney. Also really good on top is yoghurt infused with a little garam masala, lemon juice, grated cucumber and salt. \r\n\r\nIf you are serving wine with this make sure it is one with low tannins. Beaujolais, Tempranillo and Pinot Noir varietals will all be good choices with this dish.\r\n\r\nHope you all enjoy this recipe and if you have any questions by all means make some comments and I will answer. Enjoy!"

    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "Prepare soffritto by sauteeing the carrot, celery and onion in 2 tablespoons of oil or butter until beginning to color, 10 minutes over medium low. Add garlic and saute a minute longer. Combine all ingredients in slow cooker. Cook for 10 hours at the slow cooker's Low setting or 6 hours at High, maybe longer for a larger roast.",
      "Variation #1 - \tPot roast: you're obviously 90% of the way there and can credibly serve the above recipe over egg noodles or mashed potatoes directly from the slow cooker. However, proper American pot roast can be made by combining 3 cups of the sauce, 2 cups of chopped canned tomatoes (no juice), 1T of Minute tapioca (for thickening), 1T of tomato paste and 1t of dried thyme in a large pan and simmer for an hour. If you like a saucier sauce, substitute 1 cup of tomato sauce for the 2 cups of chopped tomatoes. Shred or chop enough roast to total 5-6 cups and combine with the sauce and heat through. Serve over starch of your choice (rice is nice).",
      "Variation #2 - \tPot roast ragu: shred three cups of roast with a fork. Make a simple soffritto of a peeled carrot, a stalk of celery and half an onion, roughly chopped together and sauteed in olive oil in a Dutch oven until soft, 7 minutes. While this is cooking, chop a large (29oz) can of whole tomatoes by hand or briefly grind in the food processor, reserving the juice. Mince three cloves of garlic. Add the garlic to the soffritto to cook briefly until aromatic (2 minutes) and then add the tomatoes and shredded pot roast. Add a cup of red wine and about half the remaining tomato juice and reduce the heat to low. Cook uncovered, simmering lightly, for about 45 minutes, adding more tomato juice to get the texture right. If you like a saucier ragu, substitute 2 cups of tomato sauce for the whole tomatoes. If you like a more rustic, traditional ragu, you can add a cup of the pot roast sauce at the beginning of the preparation with just a bit of chopped tomato. Prepare a suitable pasta (tubular would be nice) and when just al dente, add the pasta directly to the ragu, and cook together for a few minutes. Serve with shredded parmesan. Stirring in frozen peas along with the pasta is also quite nice and solves the nightly vegetable problem.",
      "Variation #3 - Beef barley soup: This one works particularly well if your roast came out a little tough and doesn't shred easily. Chop or shred enough beef for 2 cups. Dice one onion, cut two peeled carrots into 1/4\" coins and mince one clove of garlic. Saute the onion in 1T of olive oil in a Dutch oven for 5 minutes over medium heat until very soft . Add 1/2 cup barley and saute with onion over low heat to slightly toast the barley. Add carrots and cover, allowing to sweat for 5 minutes. Add pot roast beef and 6c of pot roast sauce. Cover and cook for 45 minutes. Adjust seasoning and serve.",
      "Variation #4 - \tBorscht: You don't have a lot of control over the size of the beets you buy so approach this one as a ratio recipe. You need 6:2:2:2:2 for broth/meat/beets/cabbage/onion so let's say 6 cups of broth, 2 cups of chopped meat, 2 cups of chopped beets, 2 cups of shredded cabbage and 2 cups of sliced onions. Cook whole beets with 1 cup of water in a pressure cooker for 30 minutes (or roast them or buy them pre-cooked, whatever you like). Allow to cool, rub peel off with paper towels and roughly chop. Combine all ingredients and simmer for an hour, adding water if it starts to dry out. Yields an intensely flavored, sweet/savory and dense soup. You could probably live on this indefinitely and be perfectly happy.",
      "Variation #5 - \tBeef stew: the distinction between beef stew and pot roast is pretty fine, but I'm shooting for 8 variations here so bear with me. Saute 1 onion, chopped, in 1T olive oil for 7 minutes until soft over medium heat, add 1 minced clove garlic and saute momentarily until fragrant. Add 3 peeled carrots sliced into 1/4\" coins, 3 stalks of celery sliced into 1/4\" pieces and 4-6 small white potatoes, diced medium. Cover and sweat for 5 minutes over low heat. Combine 2 cups of chopped beef, 1 cup of tomato sauce and 5 cups pot roast sauce, simmer until vegetables are tender, about 15 minutes. Season and serve. If you have fresh parsley, add a handful of it, chopped, right after you turn off the heat.",
      "Variation #6 - \tShepherd's pie: Prepare the beef stew above, substituting 2T tomato paste for the 1 cup of tomato sauce and use only 2 cups of pot roast sauce to create a _very_ thick stew. Remember, you can always add more liquid but you cannot add less, so go slow. Peel and dice coarsely 5 large baking potatoes and simmer until tender in very salty water to cover. Drain, mash and add in a large handful of shredded cheddar cheese, salt, pepper plus dairy of choice (cream, butter or whole milk) to taste with the goal of a fairly loose mashed potato mix. Make sure these potatoes are well seasoned otherwise the dish will be bland. Allow mashed potatoes to cool. In an oversized pie pan or casserole dish, smear butter and coat interior of pan in breadcrumbs with some chopped fresh rosemary or thyme if it's handy (I usually just lightly toast some bread and leave it to crisp in the residual heat of the toaster oven, then chop finely with a knife but feel free to use commercial crumbs), then line the entire inside of the pan with about 1/2 of the mashed potato mix. The best way to do this is with clean, wet hands. Don't overthink this. Top the mashed potato with the beef stew, and then cover the stew with remaining mashed potato again using your wet hands. The goal here is basically a double-crust pie made with mashed potatoes, OK? Lavish the top of the pie with butter and parmesan and bake at 425' until hot and brown (twenty minutes?). The crumbs on the bottom give you a wonderful crunchy contrast to the smooth potato and savory stew. Don't allow the diners to burn their mouths in their eagerness to eat this. This variation may have been stolen from Jamie Oliver. My wife thinks it's better with a pie crust instead of mashed potatoes. Whatever works for you.",
      "Variation #7: Beef udon soup: Frozen udon noodles are available in most Asian markets and are great. For four diners, bring 6 cups of sauce to a simmer. Slice unpeeled ginger into 3 or 4 1/4\" coins and smash with knife blade. Smash 3-4 garlic cloves with knife blade. Add ginger, garlic, and 3 tablespoons of soy sauce to simmering sauce. If you have instant dashi, add a teaspoon. Simmer for 10 minutes and adjust seasonings to taste. Carefully remove the ginger and garlic with tongs. While simmering, finely julienne carrots, snow peas and mushrooms of your choice - this is really more of a garnish. Add 1 cup of shredded beef and return to simmer. Add frozen udon noodles to soup (I find three bundles of noodles is more than enough for four diners) and return to a simmer over medium-high heat. Stir to separate noodles, add julienned vegetables and simmer for a minute to blanch the vegetables. Add two to three scallions, chopped (you really need this, trust me) and serve. Serving can be tricky - it's easiest to pour the broth into bowls and then serve the noodles into the bowls using tongs. Fun to eat with chopsticks. Garnish with sesame seeds, sichimi togarashi and pieces of dried seaweed. This is in no way traditional, but it's good fun and it's an excuse for an outing to the Asian food store (assuming you don't go there as a matter of course).",
      "Variation #8: Sunday lasagna: prepare 4 cups of ragu (above). Buy some prepared fresh lasagna noodles (or use the no bake dried ones, which aren't dreadful) and one pound of frozen spinach (I really like the \"leaf\" style frozen spinach which isn't frozen in a block). Mince some garlic, add it to 2T of olive oil and saute briefly. Add the frozen spinach to the garlic, cover and allow to defrost and heat through until just cooked and set mixture aside. Prepare a bechamel with a stick of butter, a cup of flour, 4 cups of hot milk, a handful of shredded cheddar and a generous amount of some other cheese, shredded (fontina, taleggio, parmesan - you can't go too wrong). Use the Internet if you don't know how to make bechamel, I have nothing to add here. Make sure it's well seasoned, no one likes bland bechamel. To assemble the lasagna, start with a thin layer of spinach, cover with bechamel and ragu, some parmesan and a sheet of lasagna. Alternate, making sure you leave enough bechamel to cover the top. Sprinkle with parmesan and bake at 350' until golden and bubbling, about 40 minutes, and allow to cool for 20 minutes."

Flatten the disc as much as possible, then stretch it into shape, keeping the edges a little thicker than the interior. You can aim for a large disc, or fit the dough into the rectangle of the pan. If a thin spot or two forms, that's okay -- it doesn't have to be perfect. Just call it rustic!",
      "Brush the edges of the dough with a little olive oil. Spread the shallot mixture lightly over the dough, leaving a 1-inch margin all around. Scatter some of the walnuts and cheese across the top, but make sure to keep the topping light. Cover with a tea towel or plastic wrap, and repeat with the other half of the dough. Remove the covering. Bake the pizzas in the bottom third of the oven for about 5 to 10 minutes, rotating the pan halfway through, until edges are golden. Watch carefully to make sure the walnuts don't burn too badly -- if they begin to, you may need to turn down the oven to 400\u00b0 F or 450\u00b0 F. There will be some burnt onion edges, which is perfectly fine.",

Last add the lemon zest.",
      "Taste the mixture at this point and adjust the spices to your taste, it will most likely need both salt and pepper. The salt needed will vary based on the chicken broth you have used. If the couscous is bland you can also use some of the juice of the lemon you have just zested to give it added brightness.",
      "The couscous can be set aside for a few minutes or a full day before you use it to stuff the hens. On its own the couscous is a nice hot side dish or can be served as a cold salad that travels well for school lunches and picnics.",
      "Rinse your hens and let them dry and come to room temperature. Pre-heat oven to 350 degrees. The hens will cook more evenly and hold stuffing better if you tie the legs together and tuck the wing tips under. These are little hens, no need to fully truss the bird, if you want to go crazy and do all that work truss away. Otherwise just knot a piece of cooking twine around one leg and then wrap around the other leg and knot together tightly, crossing one leg over the other. Tuck the wings back and under the bird to protect the wing tips from burring.",
      "Rub the outside of hens with olive oil. Salt the cavity and then stuff with the couscous. Don't over stuff just a 1/4 of a cup or so of the stuffing will fit in each bird.",
      "Salt, pepper and poultry spice the outside of the birds. Place the hens breast-side up on a large broiler pan sprayed with cooking spray. Leave room for air to circulate around the birds, don't over crowd.",
      "Bake at 350 for 40-45 minutes. While the birds bake, mix up the glaze. Put the jam, garlic and soy in a bowl and microwave for 30 second so it will mix easily. Taste and adjust the soy and garlic to you taste. Depending on the thickness of your jam you may need to add more or less soy to get the right consistency. Add the glaze and turn up the oven to 425 bake for just 5-10 more minutes be sure not to burn the glaze and that a thermometer in the breast reads 165.",
      "Allow to rest for about 10 minutes then remove from the broiler pan. Serve the hens whole or split down the center. The birds are very simple to slice in half with either a heavy duty steak knife or butcher knife. Warm the extra couscous and serve on the side. Enjoy."

Sprinkle the chopped herbs and red pepper flakes over the chicken and use your hands to distribute the seasonings over each piece.",
      "When the fire begins to produce a steady stream of smoke, place the chicken breasts over direct heat and grill, flipping every minute or so, until lightly charred, 6 to 7 minutes total. Transfer the breasts to a plate and let rest for 5 minutes. Place the radicchio in a bowl, top with a generous drizzle of the dressing, half of the Parmesan, and the olives and toss well. Taste the salad and add additional salt, pepper, or dressing as desired. Divide the salad among four plates and top with the remaining Parmesan and a whole or sliced chicken breast.",
      "**NOTE: Smoking is where the magic happens. Incorporating hardwood in any of the following forms creates a stream of aromatic smoke to infuse whatever you're cooking. If you're using a gas grill, your only option is to rey on wood chips (soaked in water beforehand so they'll slowly smolder) placed in a smoker box or foil packet that's placed directly on the grates over a flame. You can also use soaked chips in a charcoal grill, either wrapped in a foil packet or scattered directly on the coals. Chips burn much more quickly than wood chunks, so consider the latter for recipes that require longer cook times. I love wood chunks because I can place a couple directly on a bed of hot coals (no soaking required), where they'll light quickly and smolder steadily, and they're easy to move with tongs if I need to balance the heat. Wood chunks are a great way to build heat if your temperature begins to drop midway through cooking and you don't have hot coals at the ready. Once the chunks ignite, you can control the speed at which they burn by moving them around the fire and venting your grill to control the amount of air the fire is receiving."

Add Butter to bowl, reserve flour in 1 cup increments, with a pastry cutter start working butter and adding flour as you go. It should start forming powdery butter crumbs. Continue until all flour is used. Add salt, and sugar then pour water on top. You can use your hands for this part, as it will be tough to do with a spoon. Mix until you have formed a ball that is solid. Dough should be pliable, but not sticky. If it is too sticky, add more flour. If it is too dry add a little more water. Roll dough out onto floured surface so it is about 1/4 in. thick, or if you like thicker crust go for it. Just know the thicker the dough, the longer the cooking time. Form dough into cupcake pans that have been buttered and dusted with flour or lined with wax paper. The dough circles should be cut 1/2 in bigger than the cupcake pan circles. Throw into oven to bake for about 8-12 minutes, you want the pie crust to be formed enough to hold the filling, but not completely cooked.

Place pitted and halved cherries into saucepan, add rum and sugar, turn on burner to a medium heat. Let the cherries and rum marinate and create a compote. This mixture should not boil as the sugar will start to caramelize. Once all sugar has melted, add your vanilla. Then add the cornstarch or flour to the mixture. IMPORTANT, you must pre-mix your cornstarch with a little bit of water so the cornstarch does not create lumps. Whisk the cornstarch or flour mixture into the cherries as they are cooking, continue to whisk until the filling gets thick. Once the filling has thickened, you can add it to the pre-formed pie crusts.",
      "Once filling is added to crust, you can top it with a top crust or add some decoration with extra pie dough. This recipe is for crusts on top and bottom of pies so they are handheld. IF YOU DO NOT WANT PIE CRUST TOPS, then bake the crust until it is golden brown in the cupcake pans, before you add your filling. Butter the top crusts of your pies and put in the oven for another 8-10 minutes, or until golden brown."

When water is at a brisk boil, turn heat down a bit and salt the water, a teaspoon at a time, until the water has a mild, salty taste. While water is coming to a boil, remove core from cabbage and slice into 2-3 wedges. After water is salted, add cabbage wedges to boiling water, cover pot and blanche for 3 minutes. Remove cabbage wedges from pot and add to large bowl filled with a mixture of ice water and ice. Reserve blanching water. When cabbage has cooled, remove from ice and ice water mixture, dry thoroughly with some tea towels, and cut into 1 inch pieces.",

When oil is warm, butter has melted and is a lovely golden color and you can smell its fragrance, add cabbage slices to pan in single layer, if possible. Cabbage may splatter if it is still slightly wet. If that happens, turn heat down a bit. Let cabbage cook for about five minutes without disturbing until underside is caramelized. Watch it carefully because you don't want it to burn. It should be a lovely golden color, not blackened. When cabbage has caramelized on one side, carefully turn pieces over and continue to cook. You may have to adjust the heat, if necessary. You don't want the pieces to cook too quickly. Aim for about five minutes per side.",
      "While cabbage is cooking, add walnuts to a pie pan and place in preheated oven. After about five minutes, check on nuts. If they are starting to smell fragrant and are a beautiful golden color, remove from heat. Otherwise, give them another minute or two to finish toasting. Remove from heat. Crumble nuts if pieces look too large. Add remaining 1/2 tablespoon (you may need less) olive oil to nuts, just to very lightly moisten them. Sprinkle with sea salt and reserve.",
      "After the cabbage has been cooking for about five minutes, start cooking your pasta. When blanching water has come to a rolling boil, add pasta. Keep water at a steady boil, adjusting heat if necessary. Give pasta a good stir with a ladle to make sure pasta is not sticking together.",
      "Check on cabbage. Once cabbage is caramelized on all sides and is a lovely golden color, add garlic to pan. When you can smell garlic cooking (after about 1 minute), add thyme sprig and chopped sage leaves to pan. Add a ladleful or two of pasta water to pan, lower heat and keep at a simmer while pasta finishes cooking and while you prepare the brown butter.",
      "Add 3 ounces of butter to small skillet. Turn heat on burner to medium. Once butter has melted and is a lovely golden color, add 10 whole sage leaves to pan. Turn heat down to medium-low. Stir butter frequently, spooning butter over sage leaves. Watch carefully, you don't want the sage leaves (or the butter) to burn. After about 5 minutes, when sage leaves are a slightly darker green and are no longer limp, remove from butter with slotted spoon. They should have a nice crisp texture. If not, return to butter to continue cooking for another minute or two. When sage leaves have crisped, drain on paper towel-lined plate. Continue cooking butter until it is a lovely dark brown color, about another minute or two more. Remove butter from heat.",
      "When pasta is almost finished cooking and is still a bit al dente (taste it, if you are in doubt), fish pasta out of saucepan with a spider and add pasta to cabbage mixture in skillet. If there is not much liquid in the pan, add a few more ladlefuls of the cooking liquid. Raise heat to medium, and stir pasta and cabbage together so that the cabbage sauce coats the pasta. Cook for another minute or two until pasta is completely cooked and cabbage sauce has slightly thickened. Remove from heat. Taste and add more salt if necessary. Put a generous amount of pasta and cabbage on each plate or in pasta bowls. Add a generous spoonful of brown butter to each serving of pasta and gently mix with tongs. Add a shower of salted walnuts, top with two crispy sage leaves, and shred Parmesan cheese over top of pasta. Spoon a little more brown butter over all.",
