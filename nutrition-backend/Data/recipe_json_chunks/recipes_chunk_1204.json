A simple olive oil in a medium saute pan (no NON stick) heated to medium high. Sear each side. When the first side goes down, brush the top with the butter. Once flipped, brush that side as well with the butter. Only cook 2-3 minutes per side. The last time you flip again baste with the tomato butter and put back on the heat to finish cooking. another 2-3 minutes. It won't take long. You want the tenderloins to be medium rare. Keep a little butter for the end to top if you have any. Once done remove and cover. Temp -- I like to get to 150, it will get to 160 which is medium rare as it rests. It will be just fine. DO NOT overcook. Remove immediately and cover with foil to rest.",

Season with salt and pepper and just top the pork tenderloins with the onion/olive sauce and dinner is served.",

      "This is best started the afternoon before.",
      "Put the red peppers in an oven dish which holds them fairly snugly.",
      "Grill -- this will take about 20 minutes. Turn them frequently and make sure the pepper skins are wrinkly and slightly charred all over. Remove, cover and cool. When cool, peel the peppers thoroughly, slice, and remove all seeds and ribs. Save as much liquid as possible with the slices. Cover and save in fridge. (This can be done the afternoon before).",
      "Next morning, bring a pot of water to the boil, and dip in the chard leaves one by one, for 30 seconds each. Put on kitchen paper to drain - they only need to \"relax\", not cook.",
      "If using the dried mushrooms, let them soak in warm water and leave.",
      "Measure the tomato juice into a measuring cup - it should be 12 fluid oz or 375 ml. Pour a little of the juice into a small pot, add the Worcestershire sauce, Tabasco and sugar, and stir over low heat. Sprinkle over 4 teaspoons gelatine and stir in with the back of a spoon. Do NOT boil - all you want to do is dissolve the gelatine in warm to hot juice.",
      "When dissolved, stir into the rest of the juice.",
      "Oil your bread tin with olive oil. Cut the ribs from the chard with scissors, and line the bread tin with the chard, overlapping as neatly as possible. Pour the tomato juice into the prepared tin, then put it in the fridge to set while you continue.",
      "Clean the fresh mushrooms, and slice. In a pot, put the olive oil, and over medium heat fry the mushrooms. Add the soaked mushrooms (taken out of the soaking water by hand, and squeezed lightly. Keep the soaking liquid!). Cook the mushrooms until soft. (You can use any mushrooms, but try and get some cooking juice from them, to soak the gelatine in).",
      "While they cook, add the sherry, nutmeg, some salt and black pepper to the pot and stir.",
      "Process or puree the mushrooms until coarsely pureed, having remembered to keep some pot juices back. You should have about 1 1/2 cups or 375 ml. Scrape into a bowl.",
      "Using 4 tablespoons of the mushroom soaking liquid or pot juices, put into the (rinsed) pot you used before, and sprinkle over 4 teaspoons gelatine. Again, using the back of a spoon, stir over low heat until the gelatine granules are dissolved. Stir this into the mushroom puree and mix well. The mushroom mixture will probably be very warm still at this stage, so let cool over a draft to lukewarm, stirring now and then but do not let it set. Carry on with the prep.",
      "Drain the artichoke hearts very well, then slice them up. You won't need them all, and it's not possible to slice them neatly.",
      "By now the first layer, the tomato juice, will have set. Scrape out the mushroom puree over the tomato layer and smooth out. Then lay one layer of artichoke pieces over the mushroom layer, pressing in very slightly. Season with black pepper and sprinkle with the lime juice. (Save leftovers for a salad). Put terrine back into fridge for mushroom layer to set.",
      "Cut up the peeled pepper slices, saving all the juice for the gelatine stage. (If not enough you may have to add a teaspoon or so of water). Save the juices to the small pot. (Just rinse after every use and use same pot!).",
      "Using your processor or blender, process the pepper flesh until smooth. Add the cream and process again. Add 1 teaspoon salt: this mixture definitely benefits from a little more salt than seems necessary.",
      "You should again have about 1 1/2 cups puree (375 ml). Again, dissolve gelatine in the pepper juice, but this time you need more gelatine (6 teaspoons) because peppers do not set easily.",
      "If the mushroom mixture has set a little by now, scrape the pepper mixture over it, and smooth the top. The bread tin should be full by now.",
      "Sprinkle the top (which will be the bottom) with dried breadcrumbs. Use more, if necessary, to cover well, and pat flat lightly.",
      "With kitchen scissors, cut off the bits of chard leaves hanging over the sides of the tin.",
      "Cover the tin with plastic wrap and chill until firm, about 4 hours or preferably overnight. Dipping the bottom of the bread tin in hot water helps when you try to turn out the terrine, and also loosen the sides carefully first, with the thin blade of a paring knife.",
      "Turn out on a rectangular dish, and garnish to taste. I only used sliced tomato and caperberries for a garnish. This is best served with mayonnaise flavoured with a little mustard, with a good vinaigrette, or even plain as it comes."

Fold one third of the egg whites into the sweet potato/chocolate mixture and work them in well to loosen the batter. Then, gently fold in the remaining egg whites, blending well but taking care not to deflate the mixture. Spoon the batter into the prepared pan and bake for about 40 minutes. The cake rises and looks dry, and slightly cracked on top when done. The middle should be soft but firm. Cool in the pan for 20 minutes, then remove to a wire rack. At this point, the cake can be frozen for up to a month. Even if serving it the same day, chill the cake for an hour or two before finishing it with the ganache glaze.",

Remove from the heat and stir briskly with a wire whisk until all the chocolate melts and you have a thick glaze or sauce-like topping. Refrigerate for an hour or so. (You can also make this ahead and refrigerate it for up to a week or two. Simply warm it to the right temperature for glazing the cake.).",
      "Invert the cake onto a cardboard circle or cake board so that the smooth, flat bottom faces up. Do not be dismayed if this is not a high cake - it is a torte and is meant to be a little less than statuesque. Pour the glaze over the cake and, using a metal spatula, even out the glaze and spread it along the sides.",
      "Instead of the glaze, you can also simply sift some cocoa over the top of the cake or decorate it with curls of chocolate (using a vegetable peeler and a warmish chocolate bar). The cake can also be offered with a pureed raspberry or strawberry sauce, garnished with chocolate shavings, or left as is, with a citrus leaf, a sweetheart rose, or several berries in the center."

(Apples and juices should gently simmer during cooking.) Transfer apples and juices to rimmed baking sheet and cool to room temperature, about 30 minutes. While apples cool, adjust oven rack to lowest position, place empty rimmed baking sheet on rack, and heat oven to 425 degrees.",
      "Remove 1 disk of dough from refrigerator and roll out between 2 large sheets of parchment paper or plastic wrap to 12-inch circle, about 1/8 inch thick. (If dough becomes soft and/or sticky, return to refrigerator until firm.) Remove parchment from one side of dough and flip onto 9-inch pie plate; peel off second layer of parchment. Working around circumference, ease dough into plate by gently lifting edge of dough with one hand while pressing into plate bottom with other hand. Leave dough that overhangs plate in place; refrigerate until dough is firm, about 30 minutes.",
      "Meanwhile, roll second disk of dough between 2 large sheets of parchment paper or plastic wrap to 12-inch circle, about 1/8 inch thick. Refrigerate, leaving dough between parchment sheets, until firm, about 30 minutes.",
      "Set large colander over now-empty bowl; transfer cooled apples to colander. Shake colander to drain off as much juice as possible (cooked apples should measure about 8 cups); discard juice. Transfer apples to dough-lined pie plate; sprinkle with lemon juice.",
      "Remove parchment from one side of remaining dough and flip dough onto apples; peel off second piece of parchment. Pinch edges of top and bottom dough rounds firmly together. Following illustrations 1 through 4, trim and seal edges of dough, then cut four 2-inch slits in top of dough. Brush surface with beaten egg white and sprinkle evenly with remaining teaspoon sugar.",
      "Set pie on preheated baking sheet; bake until crust is dark golden brown, 45 to 55 minutes. Transfer pie to wire rack and cool at least 1 1/2 hours. Cut into wedges and serve.",
      "Freezing Instructions:",
      "We tried two different methods for freezing: (1) fully assembled and ready to go directly from freezer to oven and (2) divided into separate components of crust and cooked apple filling to be thawed, assembled, and baked. Both versions were good, although the reassembled pie was deemed marginally better for its slightly flakier, more evenly browned crust. You'll probably want to choose one method or the other based on how long you expect to keep a pie (or its components) in the freezer.",
      "Assembled pies kept well for up to two weeks in the freezer; after that, the texture of the crust and apples suffered. To freeze an assembled pie, follow the recipe all the way through sealing the pie crust, but do not brush with egg wash. Freeze the pie for two to three hours, then wrap it tightly in a double layer of plastic wrap, followed by a layer of foil, and return it to the freezer. To bake, remove the pie from the freezer, brush it with egg wash, sprinkle with sugar, cut slits in the top crust, and place directly on the baking sheet in the preheated oven. Bake 5 to 10 minutes longer than normal.",
      "For a longer freezer storage time of several months, freeze the crust and apples separately. Freeze individual batches of the cooked, drained apple filling in quart-sized freezer bags (this doubles as a great alternative to canning). Then make the pie dough, shape it into two 4-inch disks, wrap the disks tightly in a double layer of plastic wrap and foil, and freeze. When you're ready to make the pie, simply thaw the apples and crust in the refrigerator the night before, assemble as per the recipe instructions, and bake as directed. Of course, you can always just freeze the apples and make the crust fresh the day you bake the pie."
