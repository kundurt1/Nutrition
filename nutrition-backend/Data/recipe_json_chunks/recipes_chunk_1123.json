As with any non-commercial butter/hotsauce sauce, the butter *will* separate a bit, that's normal.",

If you don't have ancho chile powder, you shouldn't substitute it with cayenne or regular chile powder because it won't taste the same. Cayenne will add a lot of heat, as will regular chile powder, and there's plenty of heat already in the Frank's Hot Sauce. If you don't have ancho, you can try smoked spanish paprika. Or if you really feel up to experimentation, you can try a couple drops of Liquid Smoke and regular mild (not hot) paprika or a little chile powder, making sure that you taste it as they're added gradually to get the amount of heat and smokiness you prefer."

      "In a small, heavy saucepan, combine the apricots with the water. Simmer over low heat until the fruit is plump and soft and most of the water has been absorbed, about 25 minutes. Add more water if needed.",
      "Drain the apricots and chop them. Mix the apricots in a small bowl with the jam or preserves, and the nuts or bread crumbs. Refrigerate the filling, if you wish, for as long as 24 hours.",
      "Roll the pie dough out 1/8 to 1/4 inch thick. Cut it into rounds with the top of a coffee can or with a large round biscuit or cookie cutter. Spread equal portions of filling on each round, moisten the dough edges lightly, and fold the rounds over into half moon shapes. Crimp the edges with a fork.",
      "In a heavy saucepan or Dutch oven, heat at least 4 inches of shortening to 350\u00b0F Fry the pies in batches, turning them over midway through the cooking, after they rise to the surface. Remove them when they are golden brown and crispy, about 3 minutes. Drain them, and sprinkle them with sugar. Let them cool for at least 5 minutes before eating. Makes 8 pies.",
      "Variations: The pies can be baked rather than fried. Place them on a greased baking sheet, brush them with a little beaten egg (1 egg is enough for this batch of pies), sprinkle them with sugar, and bake them at 375\u00b0F for about 20 minutes, or until they are lightly browned.",
      "Experiment with other dried fruit or jam fillings. Try dried peaches simmered in peach nectar with a touch of jalapeno jam, or dried apples with cider, a splash of applejack, and cinnamon.",
      "FOR THE PIE CRUST: Using a food processor, a bowl with a pastry blender, or your fingers, cut the lard, butter and vegetable shortening into the flour and salt. Whatever method you choose, be careful not to overwork the dough, which would reduce flakiness. Add the water a few tablespoons at a time, until the dough just holds together. Divide the dough into two mounds, wrap them in plastic, and refrigerate them at least 30 minutes (or wrap one mound for the freezer, if you don't plan to use it in the next couple of days).",
      "If the pie crust is to be baked, preheat the oven to 400\u00b0F",
      "On a floured board or pastry cloth, roll out the dough in a circle a couple of inches larger than the pie pan. To avoid stretching the dough excessively, roll it from the center outwards, lifting the rolling pin after each stroke rather than rolling back over the dough in the opposite direction. Loosen the dough, drape it around the rolling pin, and center the crust over the pan, dropping it gently into place.",
      "If you're making a one crust pie, crimp the edges decoratively. If your pie is to have two crusts, roll out the second mound of dough, too.",
      "For a single pre-baked crust, prick the dough in several spots. Cover the pie shell with foil, and weight the foil with dried beans or pie weights. Bake the crust for 10 minutes, and then lower the temperature to 350\u00b0F and bake for an additional 15 minutes, or follow the directions in your pie recipe.",

      "In medium size sauce pan add the following ingredients: Sugar replacement, water, both boxes of sugar free jello. Separately, in a measuring cup place the cornstarch and just enough cold water to dissolve. Add to saucepan. Whisk all ingredients frequently. Once boiling, allow to boil for three minutes. Remove from heat source. Place on top of ice bath (this facilitates the cooling process). When cool, add extracts (if you are using them), and whisk to combine. This mixture MUST be completely cooled prior to adding to the fresh cut strawberries. As pictured, I cut the strawberries in very large pieces. Feel free to slice, or cut up as you like. Add cooled mixture to strawberries. Gently toss to coat well. Pour mixture into pre-baked pie crust and place in fridge. Using the ice bath technique to chill the gel mixture expedites this recipe! It will set up in about an hour. Top with whipped topping if desired.",
      "Ice Bath- Use a bowl much larger than the saucepan containing the gel mixture. Fill half way with ice. When gel mixture is removed from the heat source, place hot pan on top of the ice and continue to whisk."

If mixing by hand, use a large wooden spoon and mix for one minute. The dough should form a firm ball and shouldn't be sticky. Mix in extra flour or milk as needed to adjust texture.",
      "Transfer dough to a lightly floured surface and knead for 30 seconds to make sure all ingredients are evenly incorporated. The dough should be slightly tacky but not sticky.",
      "Preheat the oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit, or 350 degrees Fahrenheit for a convection oven. Line 2 baking pans with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. Do not oil the paper or silicone mats.",
      "Use a rolling pin to roll out the dough on a floured work surface, frequently lifting the dough with a metal pastry scraper or bowl scraper to be sure it isn't sticking and dusting with more flour underneath if need be. You can flip the dough over and continue rolling with the bottom side up. The goal is to roll it to about 1/8 inch thickness. Use a fork or dough docker and poke holes all over the surface of the dough. Brush the surface of the dough with an even coating of the egg wash and sprinkle with fine salt.",
      "Use a small cookie cutter dipped in flour to make round crackers or cut into squares or diamonds with a pizza cutter. Place the crackers about 1/2 inch apart on the prepared pans. Gather any scrap dough and repeat the rolling out, egg wash and salting process until all dough is formed into crackers.",
      "If making more than one pan of crackers you can bake them all at once. Place the pans on different shelves and bake for 8 minutes, rotate the pans and bake for an additional 8 to 12 minutes, or until the crackers are firm and lightly golden. Remove the pans from the oven and brush the hot crackers with the melted butter. Immediately, turn off the oven, then return the pans to the hot oven for 3 to 5 minutes. Remove the pans from the oven and let the crackers cool on the pan. The crackers are done when they have a rich golden brown color and are fairly dry and crisp. If they don't snap cleanly after they cool, return the pan to a hot oven for a few more minutes until they dry sufficiently to snap when broken."

It is important to let them sit undisturbed for 12 hours because the sealing compound on the lids is still cooling and hardening, completing the seal. While the jars cool, you will hear a \"plink\" type sound from each jar - this is the jars completing the vacuum seal as the final air escapes the jar. After 12 hours have passed, remove the bands and check the lids - press down in the center of the lid. If you cannot push the lid down any further, the jar is sealed. If the lid \"gives\" a bit, and you can push it down, the jar did not seal. You can either put the band back on the jar, and reprocess it for another 10 minutes, or you can just put it in the fridge and use it within 3 months."

I used the 1-cup water in the recipe for this purpose and didn't need to add any juice. I used water because it took out some of the intense flavor of kraut (my personal preference). If you do not want to dilute the flavor, you may want to use an extra cup of kraut juice from another can or two.",

      "**Note1: I put the pork in the pot on low in the morning to cook low & slow and not dry out as a lean cut of pork often will. I turned up the heat a bit at the end to ensure the hot dogs and kielbasa were cooked through.",
      "**Note 2: I lightened this up by using a lean tenderloin, my favorite 98% fat free beef hot dogs, and turkey kielbasa, but you can use any type of meat you want. My mom/grandma/aunties would have used a pork loin roast (sliced not shredded), Full strength kielbasa and hot dogs -- btw -- the hot dogs were typically for the kids who didn't like kielbasa -- but made great left overs w/ the sauerkraut. I used my left over shredded pork & kielbasa for sandwiches the next day -- on rye bread with 2% swiss cheese and fat free thousand island dressing :).",
