      "Like many casseroles, this one involves prepping a bunch of ingredients, mixing them together, and then baking the dish with delicious results. To begin, rinse the quinoa, place it in a sauce pan with 2 C of water, and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Once boiling, cover, reduce heat to medium-low, simmer, and allow it to cook until all of the water is absorbed. This will take about 12 minutes. Note that it's important to rinse your quinoa before cooking, otherwise it may have a slightly bitter flavor.",
      "While your quinoa is cooking, cut your broccoli, place it in a pot so that it's submerged in water, bring to a boil, and boil for 2 minutes. You will then drain off the hot water and submerge the broccoli in cold water until your are ready to use it. This will make it so the broccoli is not under-cooked or mushy in your casserole, but just right.",
      "After you have the quinoa simmering and have begun bringing the broccoli up to a boil, cube your chicken breast into bite-sized pieces and brown over medium-high heat with 1 tsp of olive oil. You're just browning, so your chicken shouldn't cook through (no nibbling!).",
      "At this point, your quinoa is just about ready to remove from the heat. Fluff with a fork and set aside. Your broccoli is also ready to place into a cold water bath. Set both aside until you're ready to assemble your casserole.",
      "Shred 1 cup each of extra sharp cheddar cheese and fresh parmesan.",
      "All of your filling is now prepped, so it's time to prepare the sauce that makes this recipe so delicious. First, Place 1 Tbsp of olive oil in a saucepan and heat over medium heat for 1 minute. Next, add 2 Tbsp of flour (or arrowroot flour), mix together, and cook for 1 minute. Now add 2/3 C of white wine and 1/2 C of chicken broth and whisk in with the flour and oil mixture. Bring the sauce to a simmer, continuously whisking, and simmer until the sauce has thickened. Add 1 cup of milk and continue whisking until the sauce begins to simmer again, and then immediately remove from the heat. Finally, mix in the sour cream, lemon juice, yellow curry and salt.",

      "Lightly coat a tart shell (I use a 10 inch one with a removable bottom) with a little extra coconut oil and then pour in the crust mixture. With clean hands (you could also use a piece of wax paper or parchment), press the crust into the shell, pushing up the sides until it is even all around the sides and bottom.",
      "Bake in preheated oven for 15 minutes. Note: if you wish to use the crust for a tart with a baked filling, only bake the tart for 8-10 minutes before filling and baking again. Either way, allow the tart shell to completely cool before filling.",
      "For the Cashew Cream:\r\nSoak 1 cup Raw Unsalted Cashews in 1 cup water for at least two hours or overnight. In a high powered blender, blend soaked Cashews and Water about 1 minute until creamy. Cashew cream will be used for the chocolate ganache, raspberry cream and as a topping.",
      "For the Chocolate Ganache:\r\nIn a bowl over a small pot with slightly simmering water or a double boiler, add all of the Chocolate and 2/3 cup of the Cashew Cream, stir occasionally until the chocolate is completely melted and combined with the cashew cream. Once the chocolate is melted and thoroughly mixed with the cream, remove from the heat and add in Vanilla and Maple Syrup. Allow to cool.",
      "For the Raspberry Cream:\r\nIn a medium saucepan over low to medium heat, add in Raspberries, Jam and 1/3 cup Cashew Cream. Stir and gently press the raspberries to break them up until everything is melted together.",
      "Finally to assemble the tart: (really the recipe comes together pretty quickly)\r\nPour about half of the cooled chocolate ganache into the cooled tart crust. Carefully spread the ganache to completely cover the crust. Chill for about 15 minutes in the fridge. \r\nAfter 15 minutes, spread all of the raspberry cream over the ganache. Place in the fridge to chill again.\r\nAfter another 15 minutes, spread the remaining chocolate ganache over the chilled tart. I leave about 1/2 inch of the raspberry cream around the edges exposed without covering in ganache. \r\nChill again in the refrigerator, this time for at least an hour to allow the ganache to fully firm up.",
      "Garnish the finished tart with the remaining handful of raspberries. I like to place them all around the outer edge of the tart or you could also arrange them all in the center, whatever you prefer. Serve with additional fresh raspberries and cream. If you don't need to keep your dessert vegan or dairy free, lightly sweetened fresh whipped cream is a perfect accompaniment. Otherwise, whip up the remaining cashew cream (you should still have about 1/3 to 1/2 cup left) with a bit of maple syrup and serve that alongside the finished tart. Enjoy!"

Stir the no-longer-cold buttermilk into the yeast and water.",
      "Add the flour, sugar, and kosher salt to the bowl, turn the mixer on to low/medium-low speed, and process just until it comes together as a shaggy, droopy dough 3 to 4 minutes.",
      "With the mixer still running, add the butter to the dough a tablespoon at a time. (Make sure it's at room temperature-you'll overwork the dough trying to incorporate cold butter into it.) The dough will look as if it is separating, and from this point on it will hang out at the bottom of the bowl, reaching up the dough hook like an appendage of the sandman but never fully coalescing into a ball again. Knead it for 7 to 8 minutes, by which time it should be tacky but no longer sticky and hold its shape.",
      "Lightly spray a large mixing bowl with oil. Using a rubber spatula, scrape the dough from the mixer bowl into the greased bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and leave the dough to rest, relax, and rise (though it doesn't rise so much as it expands in the bowl) for 1 hour.",
      "After the dough has risen, put it into the refrigerator for 30 minutes to 1 hour to chill, to make it easier to handle.",
      "While the dough's resting, line a couple of rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper and cover them each with a 1/4-inch-deep layer of cornmeal, into which you will nestle your muffins. (That's way more cornmeal than will stick to the muffins, but whatever's left over will be fine to use in another recipe.)",
      "Scatter your work surface with a very, very fine dusting of flour, and very lightly flour your hands. Turn the dough out onto the work surface and knead it a few times to deflate it. Shape it into a fat, smoothish log. For traditional-size English muffins, pinch off pieces about the size of a handball (which should weigh about 60 grams). With lightly floured palms, roll the pieces of dough into neat balls, applying as little pressure as possible. The dough should be pillowy and tender and delicate and have the tiniest bit of spring to it. As you shape them, transfer the balls of dough, one by one, to the baking sheet: Nestle each ball of dough into the cornmeal, then pat it down gently so some of the cornmeal adheres to the bottom of the future muffin, grab the ball very gently by its sides (the parts you don't want cornmeal on), and flip it over, gently patting the cornmealed top so the bottom picks up some of the cornmeal. Leave about an inch between the muffins, giving them enough space to stretch and rise as they may need. You can proceed with the recipe directly, or you can wrap the baking sheets of proofing dough in plastic wrap and put them in the fridge to chill for 30 minutes, after which time the muffins will be easier to handle. You can also take a longer break: wrapped and refrigerated, the muffins will keep (and improve) for up to 3 days.",
      "Turn the oven on to 250\u00b0F. Warm a cast-iron skillet or griddle over the lowest heat setting possible for 5 or so minutes. You should be able to comfortably hold your hand very close to the pan and just feel some radiant heat-nothing that would make you want to pull your hand back. Scatter the pan with a thin, even layer of cornmeal and warm for a minute more.",
      "Grab the proofed muffins one by one by their uncornmealed sides, dust off any excess cornmeal clinging to their tops and bottoms (you want a thin even coating, not a thick jacket), and transfer them to the pan, working in batches. This is the all-important nook-and-crannies-forming stage of English muffin cookery: you want the muffins to rise and griddle-bake slowly. You almost can't take enough time with this stage. (And if any point before the final couple of minutes of cooking you smell cornmeal toasting or browning, instead of just warming, turn the heat down.) After about 4 minutes, their tops will begin to puff and dome: that's your cue to flip them. Use a small offset spatula to flip them if you have one (and buy one to do so the next time if you don't-your fingers will leave prints). After 4 or 5 minutes on the second side, the bottoms of the muffins should still feel airy and light. Once they're at that point (you may have to gently cook and gently flip them one more time before they get to the handleably delicate stage), you can nudge up the heat slightly, and turning them every 2 to 3 minutes, toast their tops and bottoms. (Here the smell of toasting cornmeal is okay.)",
      "When the muffins are toasted-tops and bottoms mottled with brown, but mainly golden-transfer them to a baking sheet, and put them in the oven for 10 minutes-transfer them to a baking sheet, and put them in the oven for 10 minutes to finish baking. Remove from the oven and let them cool on the baking sheet until they reach room temperature.",
      "Use the tines of a fork to puncture an equator of tiny holes around the middle of each muffin, and then pry them apart into two halves. The muffins are ready to be seared (with a light spread of butter) and spread with pickled strawberry jam!"

Dump in the pici noodles and stir stir stir until the sauce is glossy and coats the noodles thickly. (If you're having trouble getting everything to emulsify, toss in a tablespoon of butter. Not very authentic, but it works every time.) If sauce becomes dry, gradually add more cooking water. Take the pan off the heat.",

Remove the foil, careful to retain the shape of the pie pan and set aside to use later when pre-baking the pie crust.",

Add the liquid to the flour mixture and toss with a rubber spatula or with your hands just until the dough comes together in a ball. Add more ice water if your dough is not coming together or a bit more flour if it's too moist. You want it to hold together in a ball without being sticky. Pat the dough into a disk, wrap in plastic wrap and chill in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes.",

Fold the overhang under itself so you have a cylinder that rests on the edge of the pie plate. With one hand on the inside of the edge, and one hand on the outside, use the index finger of your inside hand to push the dough between the thumb and index finger of your outside hand to form a U or V shape. Continue this crimping motion around the entire edge. Cover with plastic wrap and chill in the refrigerator for at least an hour or place in the freezer for 30 min.",
      "While the crust is chilling, preheat the oven to 400 degrees.",
      "Take your pre-shaped piece of foil and gently press it over your pie crust in the pie pan. Fold the edges of the foil over the edges of the crust very gently so as not to wreck your beautifully shaped edges. For the first several minutes of baking, it's important to weight down the pie crust. Otherwise the crust will puff up as it bakes making it very difficult to fill later. I like to use dried beans to weight the crust, but you could also use pie weights. (I've been reusing the same beans for years, storing them in a zip-top bag.) Pour in enough dried beans over the foil to almost reach the top of the pan.",

Cook the apple pie filling over medium heat, stirring constantly, just until the mixture thickens and boils. Pour the apple pie filling into the pre-baked pie crust and dot the surface evenly with the 1 tbsp butter. Bake, uncovered, for 15 minutes.",

      "Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0 F. In a medium bowl, stir the pretzels and melted butter together to combine. Press the crumb mixture into a 14 x 5 1/2 inch tart pan (this can also be made in a 9-inch round pie plate). Bake the crust for 15 minutes. Cool completely.",
      "In a medium pot, combine the milk, cream, vanilla bean, and half of the sugar. Bring the mixture to a simmer over medium heat.",
      "When the milk comes to a simmer, whisk the remaining sugar, cornstarch, and egg yolks to combine. Temper the mixture with a small amount of the milk (you can gently pour it in from the pot), stirring constantly.",
      "Pour the tempered yolk mixture back into the pot with the remaining milk, and whisk constantly over medium low heat until the mixture begins to boil. Immediately remove from heat and stir in the butter and vanilla extract.",
      "Strain the custard into the cooled crust and smooth into an even layer. Cover the surface of the custard directly with plastic wrap and chill for at least 2 hours, and up to overnight.",
      "To make the whipped cream, place the freeze dried raspberries in a food processor and pulse until the mixture forms a fine powder.",
      "In the bowl of an electric mixer, whip the cream, sugar, and raspberry powder to soft peaks. Whisk in the vanilla.",
      "Start by piping a circle where you'd like the first peony to go. The peony will end up being slightly larger than this circle-so consider that when piping it (I piped my circle about 2 1/2 inches wide and ended up with 3 inch peonies). To pipe the circles, the rounded portion of the tip should be facing up. Hold the pastry bag at a 45-degree angle and spin the pie as you gently apply pressure to create the circle. Don't worry if it's a little wonky-it will be totally covered up later!",
      "To pipe the petals, you'll continue to hold the pastry bag in the same way, with the rounded portion of the tip facing upward. Pipe the first petal right on top of the circle you piped. Pipe a short petal by applying gentle pressure to the bag and making a very small U-shape with your wrist.",
      "Place the next petal so that it overlaps the first. Continue this process until you've fully covered the circle. Do the same process again, this time piping the petals on the outer edge of the circle - these petals should overlap the first round slightly.",
      "Finally, pipe the outer petals. For this, you'll want to change your pastry bag angle a bit so that the curved edge of the tip is facing away from the flower. Follow the same U motion, this time making petals that stand straight up on the outer edge of the circle. This is one of those ones that you sometimes just have to add as many petals as feels right to get it to look right! Once you finish piping one peony, you can pipe another circle next to it and keep going!",
      "Repeat until you've piped all the peonies you'd like. Refrigerate until ready to serve (up to 6 hours)."

You may need to cut a tomato segment in half in order to access and discard all the seeds. When all seeds have been removed, dice the tomato flesh into 1/4-inch pieces.

Fold the whites gently into the yolk mixture. \r\nTurn into pan & bake for about 20 minutes or until well risen & golden brown. Leave in tin for 10 minutes, then unmold onto a cooking rack. Wash, dry and regrease same springform pan (but it may look even nicer if you use an 8 inch pan since cake shrinks a bit). Place cake back in pan, then pour mango mousse.",

Place bowl over bowl of ice water and stir occasionally until the mixture is syrupy and just beings to thicken(do not let jell); remove from ice water. When mixture is syrupy, pour over mango mousse. Place in freezer overnight or for a few hours.",

Run a small sharp knife tip around the edge of the mango mirror to separate it from the sides of pan. Mirror will tear when sides are unlatched if it is stuck at ANY point. Slowly unlatch the pan and slide it off the cake. Place cake back in fridge until it is defrosted or leave it outside about 2-3 hours prior to serving Optional - Cut 1 or 2 mangoes into slices or whatever shape you want and place on top of mirror in a decorative manner. I am not too good at that (as shown on picture) but maybe you can do a better job than I. Slice cake in wedges and serve in upright slices."

You need to be watching the fruit quite closely, as the line between \"perfectly caramelized\" and \"burnt\" happens in a flash.) After 12 minutes, all the fruit should be in the pan; give everything a stir. Stirring occasionally, continue to cook the fruit for another 25 minutes, or until the apples and pears have broken down, and are the color of golden raisins.

In a heavy bottomed pot, heat enough oil to cover the bottom of the pot. Brown both sides of the meat, 3-5 minuets each. Kill the heat, pull the meat out and set it aside.",
      "Heat your oven to 300. Take the same heavy bottomed pot used for the meat and add a bit more olive oil so the bottom is covered again. Add the ginger, garlic, onions, carrots and celery and cook over a medium high heat until they begin to get nice and brown (10-15 minuets). Make sure and work the veggies around with a wooden spoon to keep them from burning (browning is okay though). Add the green onions and cook for another 4-5 minuets. Add the mirin and stir all the browned veggies around, trying to scrape the stuff off of the bottom.",
      "Turn the heat off and put the beef back in the pot. Add the Sambal Oelek, lemon grass, shoyu, miso paste, honey, lime juice and rice wine vinegar. Make sure it's fairly combined (mixing the stuff up before adding it helps). Now break out your veal stock (or boxes of beef broth) and add enough to cover the piece(s) of meat completely. Now add your cilantro, five spice and black pepper.",
      "Now the easy part. Cover the pot with foil, or if you have a nifty top, put that on. Slide the sucker in the oven and set your timer for 4 hours.",
      "At the four hour mark turn off the oven and pull it out. After a quick cool down carefully remove the short ribs with a slotted spoon (they tend to fall apart when they're warm, so if you can let them cool down a bit they are much easier to handle) and set it aside. Strain out all the liquid and save it for the sauce.",
      "For the sauce, heat up some of the reserved liquid and let it cook down to an slightly thick sauce. If it cooks down too much it will just be salty and lame, so make sure and taste it as it cooks. Reheat the ribs in the sauce and then serve the in a big bowl with the sauce all over or on the side."

Grind toasted spices with 1 teaspoon yellow mustard seeds, 5 whole cloves and 1/2 teaspoon black peppercorns. *** You can also skip the roasting part of this if you want.

So don't worry if it doesn't reach the tomato's brim. Wrap each tomato in a piece of prosciutto (sort of like a wide belt). It's fine to tear the slices up a bit in order to wrap the tomatoes nicely. Don't cover the tops or bottoms, and you might not need all of the prosciutto. Gently press the tomatoes down into the cheese bed. Bake for 40 to 50 minutes. About 25 minutes in, you can use a spatula to smash the cooking tomatoes down a bit. Be gentle-you don't want the tomato juice to squirt out on the cheese-it's just a tiny nudge downward. If the tart shell starts to brown too much, cover it with aluminum foil while the tomatoes cook. Remove the tart from the oven when the cheese is starting to brown and the tomatoes are starting to shrivel and darken. Cool for 30 minutes. Carefully remove the outer ring of the tart pan. Slide the tart off of the metal bottom and onto a cutting board. Cut into 9 squares. Serve right away with a crunchy green salad. It will keep in the fridge for a few days, or you can freeze it for a few months."

      "To prepare the salt, zest as many lemons and oranges as you have on hand into a large bowl with the egg whites. Whisk until the whites froth a bit, and then stir in the salt. Mix in the bay leaves--as many as you can spare, really, reserving a few to put inside the cavity of the fish--so that they bruise a bit and begin to infuse the salt. You may add other herbs such as thyme, but this dish is great with just the combination of bay and citrus.",
      "It's incredible how cooking can dislodge a memory from the mental archive. Sometimes it's a repetitive motion that's to blame. Zesting, that simple motion of scraping the outermost layer of skin from a citrus fruit with a sharp tool to release the oils, always connects me to the days when I used to work in a bakery. I let myself wander through memories of lemon shortbread and the woman who taught me to make marmelade, as I turn the fruit, gleaning the flavor from its every surface.",
      "The first time I made fish baked in a salt crust, Jon and I were hosting a dinner party. We'd just moved back to the East coast and wanted to reconnect with friends. I recall us buying the fish--six at least--in Chinatown the night before. It was already dark, but the stalls were well-lit, it seemed, because the fish were glowing!",
      "I think afterwards we went to a bar for a drink, and convinced the bartender to keep our fish in his fridge!",
      "Rouse yourself from musings, and lay about an inch of salt on the dish where the fish is to be placed. Did I mention, it doesn't matter if the fish is scaled or not? The scales and skin will stick to the salt when the meat is lifted out. Just make sure the fish's cavity is clean and fill with thyme and/or bay leaves. Then place the fish on the layer of salt, and mound the rest of the salt around to completely cover it.",
      "Roast for 25-30 minutes. (Err on the low side if you fish is less than 1 lb, on the high side if it's more than 2.)",
      "The only trick to this dish, if there is one, is the serving. It should be served at the table, the better to impress your loved one(s) when you crack the aromatic crust of salt and chisel it away to reveal the fish within. The first time I had this dish, in Venice, while on a trip to do interviews for a film which was never made, it had been ordered for me in a restaurant and took me completely by surprise. Luckily, my boyfriend Jon is as patient as that waiter. When he finds the tender fish, he lifts off the skin and cuts the fillet with a serving spoon into spoon-sized sections he can easily scoop off the skeleton onto the waiting plates.",
      "Don't forget to keep another dish nearby to whisk the fish skeletons into, so you can reach the bottom-fillet.",

    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "Put the butter in a 3 quart heavy saucepan over medium heat. Once the butter stops foaming, and you see orangey brown specks start to appear, stir gently with a wooden spoon. After a minute or two, when the specks are nut brown and the butter smells nice and toasty, sprinkle 1/4 cup of sugar over the butter and stir to combine. (It will clump up a little, but don't worry!)",
      "Switch to a whisk, and cook the butter and sugar, whisking all the time, until the sugar has melted and the mixture becomes a smooth, rich brown caramel, about 5 minutes. (Early on, the butter and sugar will separate, and the butter will pool around the edges of the sugar, but never fear! Once the sugar has fully melted, the two will start to come together again, and you'll have a nice smooth caramel.)",
      "When the caramel is a rich nut brown and starts to smoke, remove the pan from the heat and quickly and carefully whisk in the creme fraiche and about 1/2 a cup of the milk. Don't worry if the mixture bubbles up when you do this - it'll settle down again quickly. (This step cools off the caramel and keeps it from cooking further.) Return the pan to the heat and whisk in the rest of the milk, the remaining 3 tablespoons of sugar, the vanilla seeds and the salt. If the caramel seizes a little, just keep whisking until the mixture becomes smooth again.",
      "Switch back to the wooden spoon and stir in the rice. Turn up the heat and bring the mixture to a boil. Reduce the heat so that the milk is simmering steadily and cook the rice pudding uncovered for about 25 minutes, stirring frequently to make sure nothing sticks to the bottom of the pan, especially towards the end. The rice should be tender but not mushy, and the pudding should thicken but still be quite loose - remember that it will thicken a lot more while it's cooling. Transfer the pudding to a container, cover and refrigerate until cold. Serve in individual bowls with a dollop of creme fraiche."

In the end, you still want some pieces of them into your lovely brownie base. See 1 st picture above! Now, add pitted dates, solid coconut oil & raw cacao powder. Pulse until it is fully mixed in. Taste. My base was a bit crumbly & not so sweet so I added 1 tablespoon of maple syrup & pulsed again on speed 1 & 2. I only have 2 speeds. Taste again. It is just a bit sweet but not overly sweet , just the way, I like it. Take a cheesecake pan & place fitted ring on & secure. Grease base & sides of the pan in with vegan butter. Now, place your raw brownie base all over the base of the pan. You want a thicker layer, so push it all well into the base & sides. Push it with your hand into the base. I still had 3 tablespoons of filling over. Use if for later on, to snack on or to top a vegan yoghurt. Yum too! :) Now, place into the freezer to stiff up, for about 30 minutes.",
      "Meanwhile, make the raw chocolate cheesecake filling! Take your Vitamix or a really good blender & place your cashews, cacao powder, maple syrup, dates, water & melted coconut oil in it. Place fitted lid & tamper in. Turn on high power until fully joined, using the tamper to push ingredients into the running blades. Stop from time to time. Scrape the sides & mix again. Taste. The filling is very creamy, chocolately & just sweetened enough. (If you like it to be more sweet, add a bit more dates or maple syrup.) Take your cheesecake pan out of the freezer & smear your filling on top. It is not easy to smear it on all of the sides, but a knife worked for me. See that your filling is equally divided & place into the freezer for about 3-4 hours.\r\n\r\n3. If you want to eat it, take it out of the freezer, 15 minutes before serving otherwise you will end up with ice-cream bars! Wait 5-10 minutes & click the ring open & carefully with your hands take if off the base. Now, with help of a large pallet knife, place it under your base & carefully slide it over onto a clean plate. This way, you can slice it!\r\nI stored, kept my chocolate cheesecake into the fridge, for a more creamy chocolate cheesecake. So, when you want a lovely piece, your cheesecake will be very creamy & delicious! That is what you see with the 1st picture, straight from the fridge! :) Enjoy, my sweeties!"

      "Next morning, remove the chicken from the brine, run it under water to wash off any extra salt, place it on a wire rack to drip dry. Throw away the water and ingredients.",
      "Once the chicken has dried sufficiently, pat it with a kitchen towel to remove all the extra moisture.",
      "Slather the chicken with butter all over, place the lemon cut in half with half the thyme sprigs in the cavity, lightly season with salt and pepper.",
      "Cut one large onion and 2 carrots into brunoise, half the size of your little finger nail, scatter on the bottom of the roasting pan. Cut the garlic pod into half so that all the cloves are halves, place these in the center of the roasting pan, sprinkle a pinch of thyme over the top.",
      "Place a wire rack over the veggies in the roasting pan, place the chicken breast side down over the wire rack. Ensure the rack is high enough so that the chicken does not touch the veggies or pan. Do not truss the chicken, i.e. tie the legs and wings, that is an old fashioned method of roasting chicken.",
      "Preheat the oven to 90 degrees C, use the oven thermometer or probe thermometer to ensure that it is accurate. Place the roasting pan with the chicken in the oven for about 3.5-4 hours, keep checking after 3-hours if the internal temperature of the thickest part of the breast is 60-65 degrees, do this by using a probe thermometer. Once the chicken has reached that internal temperature, remove the chicken with the tray and allow it to rest for 45-mins until it reaches room temperature. Turn up the heat in the oven to the highest and preheat it to the maximum temperature.",
      "In the meanwhile, melt the remaining butter in a pan, add wine and a few sprigs of thyme, mix well and remove in about a minute, use this to thoroughly baste the cooled down chicken.",
      "Remove the veggies from the roasting pan along with the garlic pod, place the chicken breast side up on the wire rack in the pan, baste one more time and place in the oven for 10-15 mins, depending on how high the oven temperature is. You're looking to brown the chicken now, not over cook it, keep basting at regular intervals to ensure browning.",
      "Remove the chicken from the pan and place it on a cooling rack over a platter, cool for about 10-mins before carving.",
      "Place the roasting pan on a cook top, add the wine to deglaze the pan on a high heat, add the chicken stock and bring to boil, add mustard, tarragon and parsley, continue to reduce the liquid, squeeze out half the garlic cloves for one half of the pod into the sauce, season with pepper, check for salt, adjust, taste again. Once the liquid has reduced by half, strain it through a sieve or serve as is with the garlic cloves, we like it with the garlic.",
      "Add remaining butter (basting) and a little olive oil in a saute pan, heat, add the gizzard and fry well for about 4-mins on a medium heat. Now add the chopped bacon and fry well until almost crisp, add the chicken liver and toss, cook for about 4-mins. Once all the proteins are cooked add the soy sauce to gain some color, throw in the frozen peas and stir fry well, add bite size pieces of the bread and toss well, all of the fat will be absorbed by the bread, keep tossing on a high heat until you start seeing color on the bread. Sprinkle with parsley leaves. Taste, season, adjust, taste again.",
      "Place the chicken on a serving platter, fill the cavity with the stuffing, keep a carving knife and fork ready, serve the gravy separately."

    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "To make the candied kumquats: In a small saucepan, stir together the hot water, sugar, and salt. Place over medium-low heat and cook the syrup while you slice the kumquats about 1/8 inch thick. Discard the ends and the seeds, then add the kumquats to the syrup and bring to a bare simmer.",
      "Cook until the fruit is soft and translucent, 7 to 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and let the kumquats cool in their syrup. The kumquats can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.",
      "Meanwhile, make the cardamom caramel sauce: In a small saucepan, combine the cream and cardamom and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Turn off the heat and let the cardamom steep on the burner while you cook the sugar.",
      "Put the sugar, hot water, and salt in a heavy saucepan with a tight-fitting lid. Pour in both the water and the sugar carefully, keeping the sugar crystals from splashing around the sides of the pan. It may seem like you have very little in the bottom of the pan, but you want to have lots of room when you add the cream because the mixture will spit and bubble. Place the pan over low heat and stir the contents with a wooden spoon until the sugar is dissolved; try to dissolve the sugar before the mixture boils. Rinse your spoon well to remove any sugar crystals and don't stir the mixture again until you add the cream. If there are any unmelted crystals, they can cause the caramel sauce to crystallize instead of remaining smooth. Cover the pan, turn the heat to medium, and cook for 5 minutes to help create condensation to wash down sugar crystals from the sides of the pot. Uncover and continue to cook the sugar until it starts to take on some color. At first it will be just a little blond or caramel colored in certain spots. Keep cooking until the sugar starts to smoke a little and turns deep mahogany brown. Don't worry about the smoke and dark color; undercaramelization results in a flat, undeveloped taste.",
      "Remove the pan from the heat and pour in about 1/4 cup of the hot cream, stirring with a long-handled wooden spoon. The caramel will bubble like crazy-don't get burned! Keep stirring and slowly add the remaining cream. Continue stirring after all of the cream has been added, until the bubbling has calmed down. Strain the caramel sauce through a fine-mesh strainer into a metal bowl, stirring occasionally as it cools. Taste for salt and adjust as necessary. The sauce will keep in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.",
      "To make the cake, preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F. Brush an 81/2 by 41/2-inch loaf pan with the 1 tablespoon softened butter.",
      "In a small saucepan over medium-low heat, melt the 10 tablespoons of butter. Stir in the rum and vanilla and set aside to cool.",
      "Place 1 cup of the pistachios and 3/4 cup of the sugar in a food processor and grind together until the pistachios are sandy, about 10 seconds. If there are too many big pieces of pistachio, they will deflate your cake, so grind for a few more seconds if necessary, but keep an eye on the nuts to ensure you don't overprocess them. They should look powdery, not like they are about to form a paste. Add the flour and process for about 2 seconds to combine. Set aside.",
      "Spread the remaining 1/4 cup pistachios on a small baking sheet and bake until lightly toasted, 3 to 4 minutes. Since pistachios already have a brown skin and crisp texture, it can be hard to tell when they're toasted. If you are not sure, allow them to cool and then taste one. You're looking for an only slightly toasted flavor and a remaining green interior. Roughly chop the pistachios and set aside.",
      "In a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, whisk the egg whites on medium speed for about 11/2 minutes. They will be slightly foamy. Add the remaining 1/2 cup sugar and the salt and whip on medium speed for 1 minute. Use a rubber spatula to scrape the sugar from the sides of the bowl, then whip the egg whites on medium speed for 8 more minutes, until all of the granules of sugar and salt have dissolved and the egg whites are stiff and glossy.",
      "Using a rubber spatula, fold one-third of the pistachio mixture into the egg whites. Repeat with the remaining pistachio mixture in two batches, folding just until combined. Add the melted butter-rum mixture and again fold just until combined.",
      "Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan. Bake for 30 to 40 minutes, until the cake pulls away slightly from the sides of the pan, feels springy to the touch, and a skewer inserted in the center comes out clean. Let the cake cool in the pan on a wire rack for 20 minutes. Turn it out onto the rack and let cool completely.",
      "To assemble the dish, supreme the citrus fruits. Place the citrus segments in a strainer set over a small bowl. Cut the cake into 1-inch slices. Pour a small pool of caramel sauce on each plate, place a slice of cake overlapping the sauce, and arrange a mixture of the citrus segments alongside. Top with a dollop of whipped cream, a few wheels of candied kumquats, and a sprinkling of toasted pistachios."

    "directions": [
      "WHOLE WHEAT PIE CRUST\r\nTo make sure the butter stays really cold while you make the crust, place the butter in the freezer for a few minutes while you prepare the other ingredients. To do so, you don't need a bowl, just measure your flour and dump it on a clean working surface in a rectangular shape approximately 2 cm thick. Then, add the salt to the water and stir to dissolve. Set aside.\r\nEvenly distribute the cold butter cubes over the flour and toss them around a little in the flour so that it doesn't stick to your rolling pin. Start rolling with the rolling pin to create flat pieces of butter. These will create extra flakiness when baking. Pull the dough back together with your hands to recreate the original rectangle and drizzle a spoon or two of water over the dough. Roll one more time and pull the dough back together. Drizzle a few more spoons of water. Continue rolling and adding water. When the dough starts holding together after a few rolls, instead of just gathering the dough, start folding it in two over itself. Keep rolling and folding until the dough holds together and there are no more dry bits. You might still see pieces of butter, that's perfectly fine! You don't want to overwork the dough, just make it smooth.\r\nCover it with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least an hour or overnight.",
      "BOURBON THYME CARAMELLY PEACH FILLING\r\nTo cut the peach in slices, follow the natural indent of the peach to cut it in half. Using your hands, twist one side of the peach holding the other and it should pull apart. Remove the pit with your hands or a spoon if needed. With each halves flat surface on a cutting board, cut slices lengthwise.\r\nIn a small pot, place the bourbon, brown sugar, butter, salt and thyme springs. Cook constantly stirring over medium heat until the butter is melted. Place the peach slices in the pot and stir to coat them.\r\nLet them soak while you're waiting for the pie crust to chill.",
      "ASSEMBLY\r\nDust a clean working surface with flour and starting rolling the dough, turning 90\u00b0 after each few rolls to make sure it doesn't stick to the surface, adding a bit of flour below and over the dough as needed. Once the dough is about 4-5 mm thick, you are ready to cut it the make the galettes. Find a round object that is about 16-18 cm of diameter. Before cutting, make sure that you can fit 4 circles on the dough. If not, roll it a bit thinner or use a smaller object. You want to avoid rolling the dough a second time, since it'll be tougher and the galettes might not keep their beautiful shape in the oven.\r\nOnce you have your pieces of dough ready, place them on a baking sheet that's either greased or covered with parchment paper. Fill the center of each dough with 1/4 of the soaked slices of peach, leaving a 4 cm border. Fold the border over the fruits making little folds to create a roundish shape. Put the galettes in the fridge for 20 minutes so that the dough can firm up. Heat the oven to 375\u00b0F.\r\nMake an egg wash by mixing the egg yolk and cream in a small bowl. Brush it over the galettes and sprinkle with raw cane sugar. Place a small sprig of thyme in the center of each and bake for 40 to 50 minutes, rotating the baking sheet half-way through."

First, it will not be white like confectioner's sugar due to the off white/beige color of the white chocolate. Second, you may notice it feels a bit grainy in your mouth. Third, it will understandably have a bit of a white chocolate flavor.

Pat dry the wrappers lightly.\r\nFirst lay the lettuce down on the overlapped rice wrappers so that it acts like a small internal blanket to wrap up the rolls in. It will help to support the ingredients. Lay a few ingredients of each into the lettuce. Don't overload or they wrapper will break. Taking one side fold over the ingredients and tuck a little under while keeping a tight roll and fold over as you go until the wrapper ends and is \"stuck\" to the other side. That is it! Let stand for a few minutes until a little firm and it is ready. Now, set a side and do the rest until all the ingredients are used up. When you are ready to serve, cut on the diagonal in the middle and sit upright to show off the pretty colors of all the vegetables inside. Dipping sauce can be a store bought version, but it is really easy to boil 2 cups of water with 1 cup sugar, then add the bright orange spicy garlic sauce from the store. Enjoy."

It's best to do this over a sheet tray, newspapers, a flattened cardboard box, or whatever you have handy to avoid staining your counters. Wear gloves to avoid being caught red-handed. Wring or press the beets to remove as much excess juice as possible.",
      "Lay out the prepared cheesecloth over a metal cooling rack placed over a baking tray. Place about half of the grated beets in the center, in the shape of the salmon. Lay about half of the sugar and salt on top of this. Finally, layer the salmon on top of this. Push any excess salt, sugar, and beets up against the sides to make sure the whole bottom and sides of the salmon are covered. Press the remaining sugar and salt over the surface of the salmon. Lay the remaining shredded beets over the top.",
      "Firmly wrap the salmon and its toppings in the cheesecloth, tight enough to keep the seasonings pressed against the flesh, but not so tight that the salmon can't lay flat. Keep the salmon on the wire rack over the sheet tray. Wrap the whole thing tightly in plastic wrap and place it on the lowest shelf in your fridge.",
      "The salmon will need two to three days to cure. Check it daily, draining any fluid that accumulates in the pan. When you're ready to unveil it, cut a small test portion from the tail end to ensure that you have a nice ruby ring around the outside of the salmon and that the flesh tastes salty enough. When you're happy, gently scrape away the beets, salt, and sugar.",
      "To serve it, you can rinse the whole thing gently under cold water, or you can wipe it down with a wet towel. Don't leave the salmon in the cure too long, or it will be too salty, and eventually, tough. When you serve it, shave thin slices off of the salmon and plate it. For a boosted presentation, curl the slices up into rosettes or waves to give the red edges a rippling effect-not that they'll need any dressing up."

Add 1 cup of the stock and, over low heat, bring to a simmer. As the liquid reduces, keep adding stock by the cup. The rice will take about 17 minutes to cook in total; halfway through cooking, add the squid to the rice. Continue cooking and adding stock (in some cases, you may need to add some water as you want the rice to cook in plenty of liquid).",
      "After 17 minutes the rice should be al dente and the risotto itself should still have a good amount of liquid in it. Take off the heat and toss the rice energetically to create creaminess - essentially you are emulsifying the liquid. The risotto should end up being what Italians call 'al onda', wave-like, which means when you put it on the plate (not a bowl, but a flat plate), it should be liquid enough that it spreads out when you bang the bottom of the plate gently with the palm of your hand.

      "First, make your veggie tofu scramble. Take a large non-stick pan, pour 2 swirls of oil in it & heat up on medium-high. When hot, add garlic & onion wedges. Fry for about 2 minutes. Now, add a few knobs of vegan butter & aubergine chunks. Stir often. After 5 minutes, add chickpeas, 2 teaspoons of mild smoked paprika, 1 teaspoon of Maldon sea salt, 1/2 teaspoon of turmeric & 10 grins of black pepper. Saute. Stir often for 5 minute or so & then, add a few splashes of hot water to the pan, if you need to, so that the spices won't stick to your pan. Transfer the veggies mix to another large pot with fitting lid. Add a bit of vegan butter & add tofu, that you crumble between your clean hands into your pan. Crumble the tofu well but don't crush it, just lift it up & swirl it around the pan. It need to be chunky! Fry for about 10 minutes max. Lower the heat if the tofu gets sticky to the pan. Add some extra oil, if you need to. Add lemon juice, 1/2 teaspoon turmeric & nutritional yeast too. Stir often everything round in the pan. If the tofu sticks to the pan, add some hot water to prevent sticking! Taste! I added 1/2 teaspoon of Maldon sea salt & 8 grins of finely milled black pepper. Stir well around in the pan. It has to taste soothing & fab! Now, it looks like scrambled eggs. Mix the scrambled tofu with the rest of the veggie & chickpea mix into that larger bowl with fitting lid.",
      "In the meantime, heat up your tortilla wraps according to your packet instructions. Plate up! Take a warm & pliable wrap & place 7 fresh rocket leaves in the middle of each wrap. Place tofu & veggie scramble on top of the rocket leaves, all over the middle of each wrap, a few tablespoons, leaving the sides uncovered. Now, first, fold the bottom to the inside , fold the left side & the right side to the middle & carefully roll the wraps up! I place each 1/2 of the end of each wrap into aluminium foil to eat it more easily. After being carefully wrapped in foil, I added at least 2 tablespoons of the filling to the inside of the tortilla. So that it is fully packed! Things will be kept together nicely! Enjoy it once or twice! :) MMM!\r\nOne wrap really fills you up with bang on protein!!! Yeah, baby!! :)\r\nYou can make it Gluten-gree by using Gf tortillas!"

Grill the poblanos, onions , scallions and jalapenos for 5 to 7 minutes, turning halfway through, until softened and cooked but not soggy.

      "Kitchen Tips: Use avocados that are ripe but not overly ripe, mushy, or brown. They will not grill well.\r\nPoblanos can vary in heat and intensity, so taste a piece to check for heat before adding all of it. The ones for the final test were unusually spunky so we used just one, but I often use 2. If you have any extra they are great with some olive oil and salt on a sandwich - especially rather bland cold cuts like turkey or add it to a grilled swiss on rye.\r\nWear gloves if possible, while removing the jalapeno's veins or seeds. It's true for any hot peppers.Be very carefully to avoid touching your eyes and nose as well. Trust me , you will be very unhappy. Gloves or not, use a small very sharp knife to remove the seeds and white ribs."

Scrape the cobs over the reserved brodo kernels with the back of your knife to extract the sweet corn \"milk.\" Reserve the cobs. (NOTE: If fresh corn is out of season, skip this step and use defrosted frozen kernels--2 cups for the brodo and 2 for the pasta--instead.)",
      "Heat a little olive oil and 1 tbsp butter in a large pot over medium heat. When the butter melts, add the scraped corn cobs and reserved shiitake stems, along with the halved garlic head, onions, carrots, celery, mushrooms, herbs, and spices. Let the aromatics soften, 8-10 mins, stirring occasionally. (Look for browning of the garlic and translucence of the onions.) As in the Cowgirl recipe, add the cheese rinds next, allowing them to sit at the bottom of the pot for short periods of time (10 seconds between scrapes) to get some nice browning going. Deglaze with white wine, stirring to scrape up all the good stuff stuck to the bottom of the pan, and reduce by half, then add the 2 quarts of simmering water. How long you let it go on the stove depends how robust a flavor you want--about two hours at a gentle simmer will reduce the broth by half, yielding a quart. A shorter simmer (say an hour), will yield a less-concentrated quart and a half. In either case, be sure to stir often (every five minutes, give or take), as the rinds will stick to the bottom and scorch otherwise. When reduced to the desired amount, strain and cool. Season to taste with salt. If making far enough in advance, refrigerate overnight so a fat cap forms and is easily removable. Otherwise, do your best to skim fat from the surface once the broth has cooled. You will only need 2 cups broth for the corn brodo; reserve the rest for another use.",
      "Next, make the corn brodo. Melt the remaining 2 tbsp butter in a large saucepan over medium heat, and saute the 2 cups reserved corn kernels with 1/2 cup chopped onion and 2 chopped garlic cloves until corn is tender. Remove from heat and let cool, then puree with 2 cups of the parmesan broth until smooth. Put through a fine-mesh sieve, then whisk in a few tbsps of creme fraiche and season with salt to taste. Set aside til ready to use.",
      "Bring a pot of well-salted water to a boil, and cook the cavatelli according to package directions, draining it just shy of the recommended cook time, as it will finish cooking in the sauce. (Reserve some of the cooking water--a cup should do.)",
      "While the pasta is cooking, film a large skillet with olive oil and saute the bacon and green onions over medium heat, until bacon starts to brown and crisp at the edges. Add the remaining reserved corn kernels and roasted shiitakes--about a 1/2 cup of each per person. (You may have some leftover mushrooms.) Toss. Add corn brodo and lower to a simmer.",
      "When pasta is ready, toss it in the sauce with a little of the pasta water and allow it to finish cooking. Add more water if too dry. Remove from heat and stir in butter and parmesan. Garnish with parsley, thyme, and a little extra parmesan, and serve."

Cook time will vary depending on the squash and how thickly you've cut it, but should range from 20-35 minutes.\r\n\r\n- For this salad, I look for Swiss chard with white stems. The ones with red and orange stems have a mineral beet flavor that I don't like as well in this recipe.\r\n\r\n- I use lacinato kale in raw salads because I think it's the most tender.",

If you have time, let this sit for 10-15 minutes to mellow the shallot. Whisk in 6 tablespoons of olive oil. Taste and adjust seasonings. Set aside.",

      "When you are ready to fry the chicken, combine the flour, cornstarch, dried seasonings, salt, and pepper in a large plastic or paper bag. Give it a shake to mix.",
      "Work with three pieces of chicken at a time. Place the first three pieces into the flour. Close the bag and shake it around until the chicken is coated evenly. Before you remove the chicken to a cooling rack give it a gently shake to rid it of excess flour. Continue with the first flour coat until all the pieces are floured.",
      "Again, working with three pieces at a time dip the first three pieces of chicken into the egg wash( the buttermilk and egg whisked together). Make sure they are coated on all sides. Remove them from the wash and place them into the flour bag. Gently shake and roll them until they are fully coated for the second time. Remove them to a cooling rack once more. Continue until you have finished with all the pieces. Now let the flour-coated chicken rest for 20 minutes to form a crust.",
      "Turn your oven to 250? F.",
      "Place the pot over medium-high heat. Add the pancetta and oil. You can use a deep fry thermometer but I never really find them accurate unless you can submerge then at least 2 inches up the stem. The pancetta is your canary in a coal mine. As the oil heats it will begin to bubble. It will get you close to the right oil temperature but then you need to go with the crouton method. In other words I take a piece of bread, pinch off a corner and drop it into the oil. If the oil is hot enough the bread will sink almost to the bottom but before it gets there the bubbles that have formed from the hot oil will carry it back to the top. If the bread sinks to the bottom and rests, gets a few bubbles and then slowly rises, the oil isn't hot enough. On the other hand if the bread hits the surface of the oil and it looks immediately like it is surfing a volcano then the oil is way too hot -- remove the pot from the heat, let it cool for a few minutes then place it back on the heat and test again.",
      "Remove the pancetta when it is crispy.",
      "When the oil is right, begin frying 5 to 7 pieces of chicken at a time. Just be sure to give the chicken some room. This, of course, is a common sense moment. It all depends on the size of your pot -- you be the judge. Just realize if you crowd the chicken, the crust will cook together and you either have one big piece of fried chicken or you'll have to break off pieces of the crust, which is less than desirable.",
      "After you place the chicken into the pot, let it sit for 15 to 30 seconds before you attempt to turn it. This moment of time allows the crust to set so when you go to turn it the crust doesn't fall off.",
      "Turn the chicken as necessary. If by chance your oil has not risen above the chicken you will need to turn it more often but by no means add oil after you have begun frying.",
      "Brown the chicken on all sides. Once it has browned, remove it to a tray with a cooling rack and place it immediately into the heated oven.",
      "After the last batch of chicken goes into the oven, let all of it rest in there for 15 to 20 minutes. Finish any sides that need it, dress the salads, and get everything to the table.",

      "First, prepare the fruit. Wash the berries well and remove any stems and adventurous bugs. Wash, pit and slice the peaches. If you like, you can peel the peaches first by blanching them for 2 or 3 minutes, removing them to an ice bath, and then rubbing off the skins gently; then pit and slice as usual. I don't tend to peel peaches for cobbler, since it's rustic sort of affair, but if you have an issue with peach skin, go for it.",
      "Toss the fruit, gently, with the sugar, flour, and cinnamon. Feel free to add any other spices you like; my sister is a big fan of ginger with peaches. Set the fruit aside while you make the topping. Now would also be a good time to preheat the oven to 375 F.",
      "To make the topping, mix the dry ingredients together, and rub or cut in the butter as you would for any type of short pastry: using your fingertips, two knives, a pastry blender, or even a food processor, combine the flour and fat until you get \"pea-sized bits\" of butter. Add the milk and stir gently until the dough JUST comes together-no need to be too enthusiastic.",
      "To cobble everything together, pour your fruit and all its juices into an 8x8 (or 9x9, not a big deal) baking dish. Pull off lumps of biscuit dough and arrange them over the top of the fruit; they shouldn't cover the whole top like a crust, just dollop them about somehow. Bake your cobbler in that 375 F oven for 40 to 50 minutes, or until the fruit is completely bubbly and the biscuit bits are brown. Serve hot (with a few minutes' cooling so you don't burn your mouth!) or warm, perhaps with some whipped cream or ice cream-or just plain.\r\n\r\n(I absolutely advocate cobbler for breakfast, by the way. yum.)"

Line a sheet tray with a silicone mat and lightly flour it.

While that is happening, get out a large cast iron pot and fill it with about 3-5 inches of canola oil. Use a deep fry thermometer to make sure it gets to and stays at around 350. Then quickly make the glaze. Combine the powdered sugar and juice of two lemons in a large bowl and stir it together thoroughly until it is a thin glaze.",

While the next batch cooks, dip the finished hot donuts and holes in the glaze and transfer them to a rack set over a lined tray. Sprinkle them with the lavender vanilla sugar on top before the glaze sets. Repeat this process until all of the donuts are cooked, glazed and sprinkled with sugar.

Bring to medium-high heat and when they just begin to sizzle, reduce to very low heat and cover skillet. Set a timer (please! there's a lot of multi-tasking going on here and you don't want to forget the garlic and let it get too done, or worse, burn. . . . like my first batch) for 5 minutes. By that time, the downside of the cloves should be a lovely golden brown. Turn them all over with tongs, cover skillet again, and set timer for another 5 minutes. By the time the timer goes off, all cloves should be an even golden brown. Remove the skillet from the heat. Scoop the cloves out of the skillet and into the bowl of a food processor. Add salt and puree. With processor running, drop in yolks one at a time, letting each be incorporated for a few second before adding the next. Patience. Begin adding the canola oil in 1-ounce increments: use a tablespoon from your best silver - you're making something precious - dropping one spoonful at a time until you're down to 6 ounces remaining. At that point, with processor still running, add remaining oil in a slow, steady stream. Add olive oil from skillet in which garlic was roasted, also in a slow, steady stream, followed by lemon juice. You will have a thick, rich, custardy aioli that you will be tempted to eat straight away. Restrain yourself, but taste, oh please taste, and adjust salt and pepper as you wish.

      "Prepare the dry ingredients. In a medium bowl, whisk together all of the dry ingredients. Set aside.",
      "Once the butter has cooled, whisk all of the remaining wet ingredients into the cooled butter until evenly combined. Pour the wet mixture into the dry mixture, whisking until only small lumps remain in the batter. Allow the batter to rest for about 10 minutes.",
      "Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 250\u00b0 F and heat a 10-inch cast-iron skillet or griddle on medium-low. Just before cooking, lightly spray the surface with the cooking spray, and stir the batter gently a couple times more to incorporate. Using a 4 tablespoon-sized spring-release scoop (2-ounce scoop/#16 scoop), about 1/4 cup, add the pancake batter to the pan. The pancake is ready to flip once bubbles begin to appear on the surface. Flip and allow the pancake to continue cooking undisturbed. Stack the pancakes on a baking sheet. Place them in the preheated oven to keep warm as you make the rest of the pancakes. Serve with pure maple syrup and seasonal fruit of your choice.",
      "Notes: There are two keys to making great pancakes-a good recipe and perfecting the heat of the skillet. Too low of heat will keep the pancakes from rising to their full potential, leaving a gummy, uncooked texture. Too high of heat will cause the exterior of the pancake to burn before the insides cook through. Of course every stovetop and every pan is different, so it will take a bit of trial and error to achieve the perfect pancake. As I often say, marry a recipe, and then adjust to make it work best in your kitchen. If using cast iron, know that it keeps heat really well. By the end of cooking, I've typically reduced the heat on my skillet to accommodate the heat wave.",
      "Ingredient Tip: Freeze pancakes for later. Place the pancakes in a single layer on a baking sheet, and freeze them until solid (about 30 minutes). Then stack the frozen pancakes in a freezer-safe ziplock bag. This process keeps the pancakes from freezing to each other. Toast in the toaster to reheat.",
      "Minimalist Tip: Turn this recipe into waffles by omitting the baking soda and using an additional 1/4 cup whole-wheat pastry flour (3/4 cup total). Pour 1/2 cup batter at a time into a waffle iron and cook over medium-high. It will yield six 6-inch round waffles."

Shell and devein the scampi_ you can do this by gripping its body on one hand and twisting the head off with the other_ but you may separate some entire for decoration; which will also provide a more flavorful dish. Then turn the scampi over, pull the shell open (lengthwise along its belly); working from the head end downwards; prise it open and pull the prawn free. Leave the very end of the shell on. To devein it, check for a black line down the back of it, and carefully remove it with a toothpick or a small, sharp knife. You will actually leave the tail on (which is called to butterfly a prawn or scampi). Then make a deep cut along its belly, open it outwards and press it down, to release the flavors. This latter technique can be done right before serving, or as you prefer.",
      "In a pan, bring the water to a quick boil (equivalent of two fingers of height of liquid), add the mussels, pepper and lemon juice. Turn off the heat right after that; let them on the hot stovetop until they open up the shells. Once they do, remove immediately from any heat or water and reserve, with the shells wide opened.",

Reserve away from all heat, along with the mussels. In the same pan with the same oil, quickly saute the scampi for 2 minutes. All of these delicate seafood cannot be overcooked; so consider that you add them to the steamy hot rice in the end; adding another 2 minutes in the hot rice will finish cooking them to perfection, without getting mushy.",
      "In a big paella pan, saute the remaining olive oil with the whole cloves of garlic and the rosemary and let them aromatize it. Before burning, remove them. Keep the moderate heat; and add the crushed garlic. When it's about to brown, add the rice and 'fry' it for a couple of minutes_ So as not to let the garlic get bitter, don't let it get brown. Add the clam stock, saffron flowers, paprika, turmeric, salt, chipotle and tomato puree, and give it a stir. Cook preferably in low to moderate heat. Keep a lid on top and open on 5 minutes; or if not using a lid, just keep an eye on it. Add half the coconut milk and part of the wine. Let it finish cooking and 5 minutes later you should check again; to see if the rice is almost al dente and if it needs additional liquid. If it does, add a bit of water and the remaining wine, but solely the necessary. Add the fish. Sprinkle the chopped parsley. If the rice is al dente, you may turn off the heat and add the remaining seafood, even the ones for decoration, so they will also absorb the moisture. Also add the olives. Stir it a little bit and bring the serving platter next to the stove. Delicately place the paella on the platter, using the most beautiful scampi for decorating the borders. Also sprinkle the mondego cheese on top and serve.",

      "METHOD\r\n\r\nI. Crust\r\n\r\nAdjust the oven rack to lower-middle position and heat the oven to 325F degrees\r\n\r\nPrepare a muffin/cupcake bake ware with silicon cups (that is what I do for a foolproof method and the look is attractive too); but you can use cupcake liners of your preference\r\n\r\nToast the pecans for 10 minutes; mixing and turning them during half-time\r\n\r\nCool the pecans on a rack then process them in a Food Processor to fine, even crumbs (you should use about 3 ounces for the base)\r\n\r\nProcess the crackers in the Food Processor, to fine, even crumbs (you should use about 5 ounces for the base)\r\n\r\nPour both crumbs into a clean bowl and mix them well\r\n\r\nAdd the sugar and mix well to incorporate\r\n\r\nMelt the butter\r\n\r\nPour the warm, melted butter into the crumb mix and mix the mixture until it is evenly moistened and resembles wet sand\r\n\r\nPlace two tablespoon of the mixture into each of the prepared silicone cups and press it firmly to the bottom and as much as you can to the sides (you can use a small measuring cup to assist you in the pressing of the crumbs).\r\n\r\nBake until golden brown (about 10 minutes)\r\n\r\nCool on a wire rack to room temperature (about 30 minutes)\r\n\r\nWhen cooled, set the pan as is (with the baked crumbs in the silicon cups) into a roasting pan and fill the roasting pan with warm water so that it is about half the height of the muffin/cupcake pan.",
      "THE FILLING\r\n\r\nZest the lemon\r\n\r\nSqueeze the lemons (measure out 1/2 cup juice for use)\r\n\r\nCut the vanilla bean into half and scrape the content with the blunt side of the knife into the heavy cream\r\n\r\nWarm the cream in a non-reactive pan to the point of boil, then move the pan off the heat source and let it rest until use\r\n\r\nProcess a quarter cup sugar and lemon zest with a wooden spoon until the zest is absorbed completely into the sugar and makes the sugar moist, and pale yellow in color.\r\n\r\nStir into the sugar mixture the rest of the sugar (1 cup)\r\n\r\nProcess the farmer- and goat cheese in the Food Processor until the cheese will resemble cream cheese (It my take up to 5 minutes)\r\n\r\nPlace the cheese mixture into the Kitchen Aid Mixer bowl, add the sugar/lemon zest mixture in a slow, steady stream while using the paddle; increase the speed to medium and continue to beat the mixture until it is creamy and smooth, scraping down the bowl sides with a rubber spatula, as needed.\r\n\r\nReduce the speed to medium-low, and add the eggs, 2 at a time; beat the mixture until the eggs are incorporated. Scrape the side and bottom of the bowl well, after each addition.\r\n\r\nAdd the lemon juice and salt and mix until just incorporated\r\n\r\nAdd the heavy cream with the vanilla, and mix until just incorporated\r\n\r\nGive the batter a final scrap, stir with a rubber spatula to make sure that there are no lumps in the batter\r\n\r\nPour the cheese mixture into each of the silicon cups (leave about 1/8 inch at the top)\r\n\r\nIncrease the temperature in the oven to 350F\r\n\r\nThe first 15 minutes place a wooden spoon in the door of the oven (the oven door will remain open); \r\n\r\nThen take away the spoon, close the oven door and bake the cupcakes for another 20 minutes (but you may need to check earlier, because the timing depends on your oven)\r\n\r\nThe cupcake is done when the center jiggles slightly, the sides just start to puff, the surface is not shiny and the instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of the cake registers 150F degree\r\n\r\nTurn off the oven and prop open the oven door with the handle of the wooden spoon; allow the cupcake to cool in the water bath in the oven for 1 hour\r\n\r\nTake out the pan after 1 hour, and place it on a wire rack and continue to let it cool for 2 more hours",
      "The Lemon Curd\r\n\r\nHeat the lemon juice in small non-reactive saucepan over a medium heat, until hot, but not boiling\r\n\r\nWhisk the eggs and the egg yolk in a medium non-reactive bowl and gradually whisk in the sugar\r\n\r\nWhisking constantly then slowly pour the warm lemon juice into the egg mixture and then return the mixture to the saucepan and cook over medium heat, while stirring constantly with a rubber spoon, until the mixture register 170F degrees on an instant-read thermometer and thick enough to cling to the spoon\r\n\r\nImmediately remove pan from the heat source and stir the butter into the mixture until incorporated\r\n\r\nStir in the vanilla extract and salt\r\n\r\nPour the curd through a fine mash strainer to assure that there are no lumps in the curve, into a small non-reactive bowl\r\n\r\nCover the surface of the curd directly with plastic wrap and refrigerate until needed",
      "ASSEMBLE THE CUPCAKE\r\n\r\nWhen the cheese cupcake is cool, take about a heaping tablespoon of the curd and spread it on top of each of the cheese-cupcake\r\n\r\nrefrigerate at least for 4 hours or over night\r\n\r\nTo serve, remove the silicon cup and place the cupcakes on a serving plate (you could also remove the silicon cup prior to placing the lemon curd on the top of the cupcake, but I believe it iseasier to work with the cupcake while it is with the silicon cup\r\n\r\nTake a vegetable peeler and drop a few chocolate curls on top of of the lemon curd"
