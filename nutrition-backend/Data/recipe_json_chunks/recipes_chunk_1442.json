The smoke doesn't actually cook the fish, so it stays silky and has a mild smoke flavor. Nova salmon is cured in a mild brine solution. Scottish-style uses a dry rub that is rinsed off before smoking. Indian-cure salmon is first brined and then smoked for up to two weeks, until it has the texture of jerky. Lox, the bagel's best friend, is brined and sometimes (but not always) lightly smoked, and tends to be on the salty side. Scandinavian gravlax is not smoked at all, just dry-cured with salt, sugar, and dill.",
      "HOT-SMOKED: As with cold-smoked, hot-smoked-or kippered-salmon is cured first. Then it's smoked at a higher temperature (generally 120\u00b0 to 180\u00b0) for a shorter period, typically no more than 12 hours. The result: a flaky, cooked texture and a deep, smoky flavor.",

      "Variation: If you'd prefer a completely smooth soup, add the broccoli florets to the pot after the potatoes have cooked for five minutes, and continue simmering until all of the vegetables are tender, about five minutes more.

      "Wine Recommendation: Pinot grigio is the all-purpose Italian white. Its full body matches the creaminess of this soup, while its high acidity offers contrast. The relatively neutral taste of the wine allows the soup's subtle flavors to come through. No wonder pinot grigio is so popular."

If you can feel grains of sugar, it hasn't dissolved yet.",
