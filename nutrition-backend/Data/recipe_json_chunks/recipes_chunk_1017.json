Cook for about 2 minutes in the roux then add the chicken and garlic and cook another 2 minutes. Be sure to continually stir at this point. You can also add sausage now if you want, but be sure it is heavily smoked. Now is the time to add the water, salt, pepper, cayenne, green onion, and parsley. Bring to a slow boil and simmer for about 1 hour stirring occasionally. Serve over Aromatic Rice like a soup and a large scoop of rice in the middle of the bowl. ENJOY because it the real thing without going to Louisiana. You can make this Sauce Picante with Shrimp, and Turtle as the meat also. Use as much meat as you like."

I prefer to use frozen strawberries that are set on counter while crumbs are prepared and baked. I have also substituted Whipped Cream for frozen topping. Place in cold bowl 1 cup heavy cream, and while beating add 2 tablespoons confectioners sugar, 1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract. Fold into strawberry cloud in step 5.",

    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "The casings:",
      "1.\tSoak the hog casings in 4 cups tepid water (90 degrees to start) overnight in the fridge. Some sausage experts may disagree but I soak the casings overnight and then, prior to stuffing them, I add about 1 tablespoon of cider vinegar per cup of water (4 tbs. in this case) and let the casings soak for the final 15 minutes. I have found that the vinegar makes the casings more pliable and translucent.",
      "2.\tRinse the casings thoroughly inside and out (simply slide the end of the casing over your faucet and run water through). Begin stuffing right away since the casings may become tough or burst if you let them dry too much.",
      "The stuffing:",
      "1.\tCut the pork meat and the pork belly into very small cubes (approximately 1/4 inch). This is the longest and most tiring part but don't be lazy; the more uniform your cubes are, the better the mixture will blend and the more evenly your chorizo will cook. Please, do not grind the meat!",
      "2.\tPut the cubed meat in a large bowl and mix it well.",
      "3.\tAdd the finely chopped cilantro and green onions and mix well.",
      "4.\tAdd the rest of the ingredients (minced garlic, oregano, salt and vinegar). Mix well with your hands.",
      "5.\tFinally, start adding the water gradually and mixing it with your hands. I normally add two cups, mix it and then add more water until the mixture becomes sticky but not runny. Continue to hand-mix for approximately ten minutes to make sure that the water is fully incorporated into the mixture.",
      "6.\tThis is where some other experts may also disagree but I let the stuffing mixture sit in the fridge overnight, covered. I honestly think that this allows all of the flavors to really soak into the meats and bring out the unique Colombian flavor in the chorizos.",
      "7.\tTie one end of the casing in a knot. I don't like to use thread because it gets stuck between my teeth. Stuff the casings and tie the other end. To make the links, I simply twist the stuffed casing two or three times every six inches or so (up to you on the link length). Stuffing is one of those trial-and-error kinds of things. Too tight and you may burst the casing as you twist it into links; too loose and your chorizo will get all wrinkly and have air pockets all over the place. I usually stuff one end of the casing fairly full and then very lightly at the other end. This way, I can start twisting from the heavy end, twist and allow the mixture to move along the length of the casing and fill in the light end. (Boy, I hope that made sense!).",
      "8.\tAfter the links are done, use a pin or needle to poke three or four holes on each side of the link. This prevents bursting while cooking.",
      "9.\tThe final step is yet one more with which the experts may disagree. However, I most assuredly remember that all of the restaurants I visited as a child that served chorizo, cured the links for approximately three days. My \"curing\" consists simply of hanging the chorizos as horizontally as possible from hooks around the bay window frame in my butler pantry. If you decide to cure them, make sure that you place paper towels or newspaper on the sill to catch the drippings. Allowing the chorizos to dangle vertically will probably result in the twisted links unraveling somewhat.",
      "10.\tStorage: My family loves chorizos so I really do not have to worry too much about storage. However, on the couple of occasions where I had to store a few links, they will keep perfectly in the refrigerator for up to 20 days. I have also frozen some of them and have had no problems thawing them out and using them normally.",
      "Cooking:",
      "1.\tMy favorite cooking method is to put the links in a frying pan with enough water to reach about half way up the prone link. Turn your burner to low and allow the chorizo to cook slowly until all the water has evaporated, turning occasionally so all sides cook evenly. After the water has evaporated, the chorizo will look kind of whitish and opaque. Continue to fry until dark brown. The fat from the chorizo mixture will escape through the pin holes and will provide enough of a frying medium so that you do not have to add oil or any other frying agent.",
      "2.\tOther methods include cooking them over charcoal, on your gas grill, boiled, skewered over a wood fire and, of course, cut into chunks as part of lentil soup and other dishes. Whatever method you choose, remember that chorizo should be cooked slowly and gently to avoid bursting the casings. Please come back in the future as I plan to soon upload my recipe for \"sancocho\" which, of course, includes lots of chorizo."

      "Pour half of the mixture into each cake tin and bake for 40-45 or until a skewer inserted into the middle comes out mostly clean.",
      "When cooked, allow cakes to cool in tins for five minutes before turning out onto wire racks to cool completely.",
      "When cakes are at room temperature, slice the top off both so that they have a flat surface and set the tops aside.",
      "Out of one cake cut out an oval (for the body) and a banana-shape for the tail. Reserve remaining cake.",

      "To make the icing beat the butter with an electric mixer until white and creamy. Add icing sugar 1/2 a cup at a time and beat well. Add in milk and beat for a further 1-2 minutes. Lastly, stir in enough food coloring to achieve your desired colour.",
      "To ice the cake, start by spreading icing on the tops of each spike that goes along the dinosaurs back. Pour some sprinkles in a shallow bowl so that you can't see the bottom of the bowl. Press the iced top of each spike onto the sprinkles carefully so that it is covered in sprinkles. Return spikes to their position on the dinosaur and continue icing the cake.",
      "Spread and even, smooth layer of icing all over the cake using dobs of icing to connect each section of the cake if necessary. When cake is completely covered in every nook and cranny and icing is used up you are ready to decorate.",

      "Place the mini marshmallows on the head for eyes and dot the black writing icing on each marshmallow to make pupils.",
      "Draw a smile on the face of the dinosaur using the red writing icing.",
      "Lastly place the smarties on the dinosaur's back and neck for spots.",
      "Chill cake for at least 1 hour or until icing is set and ENJOY!"

Either use or discard at least half of it when feeding--THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT to maintian a healthy starter!

    "title": "cedar plank spicy apple grilled salmon",
    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "Cedar Plank -- If using a cedar plank (grill or oven), make sure to soak the plank approximately 2-3 hours in water. I just use the sink, or a tupperware container works great. Just make sure the wood is submerged in the water. A couple of heavy cans or soda bottles work great.",
      "Apple Glaze -- Mix the jelly, horseradish, vinegar, and chives together and set to the side.",
      "Cedar Plank -- Remove the cedar plank from the water and dry it well. Brush the top of the plank where the salmon will be placed with 2 tablespoons of the olive oil and sprinkle with coarse salt, kosher salt works great.",
      "Salmon -- Have your guy behind the fish counter remove the skin for you, if they will. If not, run a sharp thin knife along the skin with the salmon sitting flat on the counter. It is very easy to remove. Brush the remaining 1 tablespoon of olive oil on the top of the salmon and season well with salt and pepper.",
      "Grilling -- If using a grill, medium high heat or charcoal works great as well. This can also be done in a 400 degree oven. With either method, I prefer to let the cedar plank heat up for a few minutes and get good and smoky before I add the salmon (about 5 minutes works great).",
      "Once the cedar plank is slightly smoking and hot. Add the salmon which has been brushed with olive oil, salt and pepper on the cedar plank. Then, immediately brush the apple glaze on the salmon and close the lid on the grill or continue cooking in the oven. After 5 minutes, brush more glaze on, and again after another 5 minutes. The salmon should take around 15 minutes depending on the thickness. It should be opaque, flaky, and firm to the touch. You don't want it raw in the middle but you don't want to over cook it either - you still want it moist and tender.",
      "Serve -- I like to serve mine right on the cedar plank. ENJOY!",
      "Note: Make sure to let the plank cool properly before disposing of it. Also, prep time doesn't include the time to soak the plank."

      "Garnish with the chow mien noodles and peanuts.",
      "Feb. 15, 2009, Edited by the author of this recipe to add just in case others prefer the original: The last few times I have made this soup, I have taken to cooking the noodles separately in chicken broth and straining the broth into the rest of the soup base leaving the noodles mostly al dente in a separate dish to be added to each serving with the vegetables in step 6. Using boiling hot soup will ensure that your veggies and noodles will be hot and cooked, while the vegetables and cooled noodles cools the soup enough to eat comfortably. Using this technique also allows you to freeze the base for future meals without compromising the noodles after step 3 making this perfect for a OMAC. Don't worry about the water chestnuts. They will stand up beautifully to freezing and will make this soup a quick dish when time is limited. I have also started using extra crunchy peanut butter instead of peanuts. Dip your clean spoon into the jar of peanut butter and get a big heaping spoonful. Stir it into your hot soup before garnishing with chow mein noodles. This not only gives you a more enhanced peanut taste, but gives the soup a pleasant peanutty, creamy flavor. I have also been using a small amount of hot chili oil in the olive oil to stir fry with instead of chilies. I like the taste and you can control the heat factor easier. I like to sear the seasoned chicken breasts in it before cutting it into bite size pieces before stir frying the vegetables."
