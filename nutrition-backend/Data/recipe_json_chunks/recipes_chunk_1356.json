Scoop up half of one of the sixths, form it into a ball with your hands, flatten it into a patty, and place it in the flour. Turn the patty to coat, shake off the excess, and then place it in the eggs. Turn it to coat completely, let excess egg drip off, and then place it in the crumbs. Coat it completely with crumbs, set it on the baking sheet, and repeat with the remaining mixture until you have 12 fishcakes. Refrigerate them for 20 minutes to 6 hours before cooking.",

Turn and brown the other side. Peek into one of the cakes to be sure it's cooked through and then keep the batch warm in the oven while you fry the rest.

      "Into a large saucepan, heat all the chicken broth to just about boiling. Into another large sauce pan, add 2 tbsps of olive oil and 1 pat butter. Add all the onions, and let them soften. Do not let them overcook, carmelize too much or burn. cook them until they absorb all the oil, then add a little water. About 10 minutes. Cook until they absorb all the water. Add the 2 cups of rice and a little more oil like a tspn. Brown the rice. This creates a shell on the risotto, and hardens the starch. (Don't burn the rice:) ). When it is golden brown, add 1 cup of white wine to deglaze the pan. Stir frequently for about a minute. Ladel into the pan 2 spoons full of broth. At this point, you cannot leave the risotto. Keep stirring and stirring and stirring and stirring.......... When you can make a valley thru the risotto and see the bottom of the pan, you need to add a ladel or two full of broth to the mixture again. Keep doing this, stir until you see the valley, add broth. The broth must be hot, or it will cool down the risotto and you will have to bring the whole pot to temperature again, and this will cause the risotto to stick and burn. Keep to just before boiling. After you have used most of the broth, taste the risotto. It should be creamy, the rice it's self should be soft. Remove from heat source. Grate fresh parmesean cheese on top 1/4 cup or more. Add white pepper and one dash of nutmeg to bring out the flavor of the cheese. Stir in olive oil, 1 tbspn."

Coat the bottom of your pallera/pan with olive oil.Brown your chorizo over high heat for 1-2 minutes. Do not fully cook, just get the outside well browned. Set aside. This should add a nice red color and a hell of a flavor to your oil. Brown the chiken for 2-3 minutes. It should not be fully cooked. Set aside. Brown garlic, onion and bell pepper until they're softened, adding plum tomatoes shortly before the mixture is finished.Push the vegetables to one side of the pan and on the other add the half can of tomato paste. Caramelize it, flipping it and spreading it until it begins to loosen (1-2 min over hight heat).Mix all of the vegetables and meats together with the caramelized tomato paste also adding the paprika, parsley and thyme.Add rice, mixing together and stirring as the rice browns (1-1 1/2) minutes. As the rice browns mix in the saffron. Make sure to break it between your fingers and stir it in to release all those tasty oils. When the rice is slightly translucent add enough chicken stock to cover the whole mixture. If it's been kept warm, it will begin to boil almost immediately. Lower to a medium heat but keep it at a steady boil.",

Let it cook another 10-20 minutes (I find that this step takes longer on a stovetop), adding broth bit by bit to keep the rice submerged until the rice on the top is al dente.Once you've stirred the paella for the last time and are letting cook, when you have about 8 minutes left to cook lay shrimp on top, turning over after 2-4 minutes to cook other side.When the rice on top is still quite al dente, take paella off of heat and cover.

Because most of the water has cooked off at this point, there might be some bare spots where the pot could start to burn. If this happens, stir in a splash of broth or water.

In a small saucepan, cook sugar over low heat, stirring occasionally with a silicone spatula or wooden spoon, until sugar melts and turns lightly golden, about 12 minutes. Remove from heat and add nuts, stirring quickly to combine. Immediately pour brittle into baking dish; spread evenly into a 1/4- to 1/2-inch-thick layer and sprinkle with salt. Use a sharp knife to score the brittle into 8 wedges. Let cool completely. Remove brittle from pan and break into wedges. Chop wedges into small pieces. Divide yogurt, honey, apricots and brittle among 8 bowls."

Leave a small end of the bag unsealed to allow for gas to escape during fermentation and refrigerate the dough overnight. The next day, bring the dough to room temperature at least 1 hour before shaping and baking the loaf.",
      "For proper texture, it's important for the bread to get a blast of heat as soon as it goes into the oven.

Then I strain the seeds and use some \"dill water\" for each batch to add to the flavour of the dill sprigs.)",

When the water is boiling again, measure 5 to 8 minutes depending on the size of the crawfish. Then take out the crawfish and put them in a bowl or a bucket. Don't try to cook the double amount on a normal stove, since it takes too long for the water to start boiling again and the time of cooking will be confused. Strain the hot water over them and put in a few fresh dill flowers. Leave them to cool off before serving, at least for 5 or 6 hours. Well covered with the salt decoct they will keep for at least 48 hours in a cool place, so you can cook them the day before the party. Or else put them in containers in the freezer were they will keep for the good part of a year if you want to save some.",
      "The crawfish are served cold and drained and the plate is decorated with dill flowers. Typical accessories are bread, butter, one or two kinds of well-matured hard cheese and finally snaps and beer to drink. The table will have bright paper lanterns above it, with at least one in the shape of a smiling man in the moon to remind of dark august evenings. If real fancy the guests are supplied with decorated paper napkins and party hats in different shapes. The meal is accompanied by drinking songs, (should be one for each snaps) and the few none Swedish guests I have had have considered the occasion both amusing and exotic."
