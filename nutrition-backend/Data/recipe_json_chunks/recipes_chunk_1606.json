Add the duck breasts to a clean and COLD pan. Do not add any oil. Place the pan on the stove and turn the heat to medium.",
      "As the pan heats up, the fat from the duck will render off and the skin will brown beautifully. Always keep the heat to between medium to medium-high. Never use high heat as the skin will burn before the duck is cooked through. Once the skin is a gorgeous dark golden brown, flip the duck breasts to the other side and cook for a few more minutes till the other sides are also golden brown. Be careful not to overcook the duck. Set the cooked duck aside and leave to rest covered with foil. Duck, like beef must be rested. The resting time is half that of cooking time. If the duck was cooked for 6 mins, then it should be rested for at least 3 minutes.",

Use the best quality one you have. Add 4 teaspoons of balsamic vinegar. Add salt and pepper to taste. Whisk the mixture well. Set aside.",
      "When the beets are done, remove them from the oven and let them cool for a few minutes so that they are easier to hold. Put on some disposable gloves (else get blood red stained fingers later). Open the foil-wrapped beets. Using the rough surface of each piece of foil, rub the beets with the foil to remove the skin. Cut the cooked beets into small pieces. Set aside in a bowl.",

Add a little honey to make a sweeter, slightly gamier version.\n\nc.) Add 1/4 cup of milk to make a creamier version perfect for really cold nights."

I used my experience along with some research, and I came up with this simple and easy cake base. You will need to separate the egg whites from the egg yolks. Whip your egg whites in a thick meringue add a few drops of lemon, this will thicken the whites. When meringue is ready set it aside. In a separate bowl add your egg yolks and sugar and mix on high speed until the mixture is fluffy. Add vanilla ( I used powder vanilla, you can use extract vanilla) and your baking powder and mix for about 10 minutes. A picture is worth a 1,000 words so follow along. :)",

      "Meanwhile, when the dough has doubled, gently punch it down and place it on a lightly floured surface. Pat into a 6\" circle. Transfer to the reserved 6\" pan. Press into the bottom and about 1/2\" up the sides of the pan. Spoon on the sauce, leaving a bare 1/2\" border. Sprinkle half of the cheese over the sauce. Top evenly with three-quarters of each of these toppings: the beef, pork, pepperoni, and the onion-pepper-mushroom mixture. Sprinkle on the remaining cheese. Top evenly with the remaining one-quarter of the beef, pork, pepperoni, and onion-pepper-mushroom mixture.",
      "Bake for 12 to 16 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and the crust starts to crisp. If baking with a terra-cotta saucer (see \"Before You Start\" note below), adjust time to 20 minutes. Allow to sit in the pan on a rack for 3 to 5 minutes. Cut into quarters.",
      "Makes 1 serving (6\" pizza)\n533 calories, 28 g protein, 81 g carbohydrates, 11 g fat, 3 g sat. fat, 6 g fiber\n\nOriginal Pizza Hut Supreme Personal Pan Pizza (6\"):\n\n750 calories, 32 g protein, 73 g carbohydrates, 36 g fat, 15 g sat. fat, 6 g fiber\n\nEven Better: The crust on this pizza is rich and oily. If you don't mind it without the oily flavor, just skip oiling the pizza pan. You'll save an additional 42 calories, 5 g fat, and 0.5 g sat. fat.\n\nBefore You Start: Specialty cookware shops and Web sites sell individual-size pizza pans, but you can use any 6\" round nonstick baking or cake pan for this recipe. A dark metal pan will crisp and color the crust better than a shiny pan will. If you don't have one, you can purchase an inexpensive 6\" round unglazed terra-cotta flowerpot saucer at a hardware or plant store. In fact, if you use the terra-cotta saucer, your pizza will come out the perfect shape since Pizza Hut's pans also have flared sides. If you opt for the saucer, season it by rubbing it with any vegetable oil. Use a paper towel to soak up any excess. Bake the saucer in a 400\u00b0F oven for 15 minutes. Allow it to cool completely before using. (You need to do this only once, not every time you want to use it.)\n\nDrive-Thru: To make these personal pizzas pronto, you can shape one or more batches of the meat toppings to store in the freezer for up to 2 months. Spending some time making the toppings is a particularly fun project to do with children. Layer the prepared uncooked topping in a waxed paper-lined airtight plastic container between sheets of waxed paper.",
      "If you don't care if the toppings look perfectly uniform, simply use your fingers to break the prepared meat mixtures into roughly 1/4\" pieces. Spread out on a waxed paper-lined freezer-proof tray. Cover loosely with a sheet of waxed paper. Place in the freezer for about 2 hours, or until frozen solid. Transfer the pieces to a resealable plastic freezer bag. Return to the freezer for up to 2 months.\n\nAlso, the 3 extra dough balls (punched down after rising) can be frozen individually in resealable plastic freezer bags. To use, thaw for several hours at room temperature. Or, for even greater convenience, after the initial rising, the dough balls can be punched down and shaped into 6\" round pizza pans (if you have extra). Set in the freezer for about 2 hours, or until frozen solid. With a butter knife, pop the dough out of the pan. Wrap tightly in plastic wrap and then in aluminum foil before placing back into the freezer. When you're ready to make a pizza, just pop the frozen dough back into the pan.\n\nWhen you want the pizza, it will come together really quickly because the crust and meat toppings need no thawing. Bake for about 25 minutes. You can definitely whip out these pizzas in less time than a trip to Pizza Hut. You'll save money on gasoline, too!"

Cook at medium to medium high heat until warmed through and a nice crust has formed on the outside, Depending on the thickness of the burgers anywhere from 3-7 minutes per side.",
      "To serve you can place on a bun with the usual accoutrements or go crazy with whatever you think will go, garlic aioli, roasted peppers. Serve without the bun with grilled pineapple, BBQ sauce the choices are endless."

Gradually sprinkle in the flour, and stir well with a wooden spoon until smooth in consistency; cook gently until the mixture becomes a light golden color. Gradually add the boiling hot milk, stirring to avoid forming lumps. Cook for at least 15 minutes, stirring constantly.",

Cook the lasagne sheets for 5 minutes, fish them out with a slotted spoon and lay them flat to dry on a clean kitchen towel. Keep aside a glass of the pasta cooking water, and stir 2 tablespoons (or more) of it in the pesto sauce.",

Smear evenly with 3-4 tablespoons of slightly diluted pesto sauce and a wee drizzle of olive oil. Next, slather on the bechamel and a few flakes of butter. Dust with a light hand of grated Parmigiano, and repeat the layers until you reach the top of the baker pan, or you run out of lasagna sheets. Should find you are running low on bechamel, you can always make more. It's never too much. On the other hand, having too little could signify a dry, parched final outcome. We want scrumptious, succulent and creamy.",

      "Make the pasta dough: Pulse the flour once or twice in a food processor. Add the eggs and olive oil and pulse untilthe dough gathers around the blade, 40 to 60 seconds. Turn the dough out onto the counter and knead a few times, then shape it into a smooth ball. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and let rest at room temperature, 30 minutes. (The dough can be made a day ahead and refrigerated; bring it to room temperature before rolling.)",
      "Prepare the filling: Remove the mushroom stems and set aside for the broth; finely chop the caps. Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the chopped mushroom caps and season lightly with salt; cook until they release their liquid, about 2 minutes. Increase the heat to medium high and cook until the pan is dry and the mushrooms are golden brown, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a bowl and let cool completely, then stir in the ricotta, chives, parsley, parmesan, egg yolk and nutmeg.",
      "Make the broth: Combine the reserved mushroom stems in a large Dutch oven with the porcini, onion, carrot, celery, parmesan rind, parsley and thyme sprigs, peppercorns, 1 teaspoon salt and the lemon zest. Add 10 cups cold water and bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and simmer until the broth is dark and reduced by half, about 1 1/2 hours. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a clean pot and season with salt; set aside.",
      "Meanwhile, fill and shape the pasta: Cut the dough into 4 pieces. Working with 1 piece at a time (and keeping the other pieces wrapped), flatten and shape the dough into a 3-inch square with your hands. Dust a clean work surface with flour; using a floured rolling pin, roll out the dough into a 10-inch square, about 1/8 inch thick. Trim the edges so they are straight, then cut the dough into sixteen 2-to-2 1/2-inch squares. Place a heaping teaspoonful of filling in the center of each square. With damp fingers, lightly moisten the edges of the dough; fold the square diagonally to form a triangle, pressing out any air pockets around the filling. Bring the 2 opposite points of the triangle together around your finger to form a ring; lightly moisten and pinch the points together to seal. Transfer to a well-floured baking sheet as you go. Repeat to form the remaining tortelloni.",
      "Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Bring the prepared mushroom broth to a simmer. Add the tortelloni to the boiling water. After they float to the top, cook until al dente, 3 to 4 more minutes. Divide the mushroom broth among 6 bowls. Drain the tortelloni in a colander, then divide among the bowls. Top with chopped chives and parsley."

The olive oil is optional. I don't use it when I cook a fresh salmon, because it's a fish that have a lot of fat in itself that is coming out during the baking time. So, for me it becomes too heavy with the olive oil. Cover the salmon with the cooking paper like a pocket. On this way it doesn't burn too much, it cooks good and the top remains crispy but not burn.

When the mixture starts to separate from the pan walls and it's thick enough to shape it, turn the heat off (yeah, I know this is tricky if you've never seen the real consistency. But you have to be careful, if the dough is too runny, the croquetas will burst the coating on frying... they should be solid enough). Try the salt and add more if necessary (it will be). Add the nutmeg and stir. Pour the whole thing on a shallow dish to cool. Cover with a plastic wrap that touches the surface, so that no crust is formed on cooling.",
      "When the dough is at ambient, take small portions with a table spoon, like in the photos, and use 2 spoons to shape them into oval patties. Beat a 2 or 3 eggs in a container and coat the patties in egg. Then roll them in breadcrumbs. When my sister and I were small we used to help my mother with the coating task. When all the croquetas are prepared, heat the oil in a deep pan. Then fry them in very hot oil (I fry them in a deep-fryer, at maximum temperature of 190\u00b0C). People usually prepare a lot of them and freeze a part for later use (isn't it nice to have a ready-to-be-fried appetizer if you have some people coming unexpectedly?). I love them dipped in a good homemade tomato sauce, like they're served at many bars."

      "Preparing the chicken. Cut or ask your butcher to cut the chicken into serving size pieces. In a bowl empty the cut chicken and squeeze the lime or lemon (or vinegar) onto the chicken, then add some water from your tap to cover the pieces of chicken. Now wash each piece individually, removing skin and any fat (we'll try to keep this a bit healthy). Now rinse with a new batch of water and drain.\nNow in the same bowl with the freshly washed chicken you'll add ALL the ingredients EXCEPT the oil, sugar and cup of water, we'll be using those to cook the chicken. Here's what it should look like (remember to mix everything around and let it sit (marinate) in the fridge for about 1hr before cooking.",
      "Ok so at this point, you've just seasoned the chicken. After about an hour or so it time to get things moving. It's best if you could find a solid or heavy pan/pot, like a dutch oven for the actual cooking process. The heavier the pan, the better the oil will heat evenly and the chicken will caramelize for you. On high heat, add the oil to the pan. Just before the oil starts to smoke, add the brown sugar. TIP - be sure to have the seasoned chicken handy, use a long handle spoon (it will get hot) and oven mitts to hold onto the pot to turn the pieces of chicken to get it evenly coated. It's important that you keep an eye on things and be ready to act fast. Next tip - it can get a bit smoky with the high heat at this point, so you may want to turn the exhaust fan over your stove on or open a window in the event you have smoke detectors installed.",
      "Move around the sugar in the pot (remember to use a dry spoon with a long handle), until it starts to melt. Now keep a close eye on things here, since you're looking for the sugar to go a bit foamy, and change color to golden. See pic below. Notice the bottom left of the picture where the sugar appears a bit darker? That's the exact color you're looking for before adding the chicken.",
      "At this point you can start adding the pieces of chicken into the pot with the caramelized sugar. Try to be quick, since you don't want the sugar to go much darker than in the picture above. Be sure to coat every piece of chicken so it \"browns\" evenly. Now cover the pot and let simmer for about 5 -10 minutes. you'll notice that the pot will now have some excess water in it.",
      "Remove the lid and turn the heat back up to high. Let's get rid of that water that formed earlier.We're ensuring that all the pieces of meat is nice an golden brown at this point. Ensure that there's no water left in the pot.. it will seems as if it's starting to stick or burn.\nNow add the cup of water to the bowl that contained the seasoned chicken. Swish it around so you get all the seasoning bits that were left back. Add this water to the pot so you can continue cooking the chicken for another 25 minutes or so. Turn the heat back down to a simmer and let cook until the water thickens up to a nice gravy like consistency.",
      "Couple points..\nSalt - be sure to taste near the end to add extra salt as to your liking.\nSauce - my mom hates allowing any form of sauce with her stew chicken, she like it to \"fry down\" so it dry. Makes for a more unique and traditional flavor. But I like to leave it with sauce or gravy so I can put it on a bed of brown rice."
