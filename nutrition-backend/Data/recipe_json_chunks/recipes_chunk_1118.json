Open biscuits can and place individual biscuits on a large microwave safe plate. Heat biscuits for 40 seconds on 50% power. This makes them soft for easy shaping. Spray large muffin tin (bakery sized muffins) or custard cups with non-stick cooking spray. With your hands flatten out each biscuit and press into each muffin cup or custard cup (if you use large muffin tin you will need 2 custard cups as the canned biscuits come in groups of 8). Cook the biscuit baskets in oven for 15 minutes. When you remove from the oven use the back of an ice cream scoop to press the biscuit basket into the tin to flatten out as much as possible. Divide up the barbeque beef between all the biscuit baskets. Sprinkle a little cheese on top of each. Cook in 350 degree oven for 10-15 minutes until cheese is melted."

Now empty the contents of the bag into a bowl and mix in the melted butter. Next place the butter-crumb mixture in the flan tin and, using your hands, press it down evenly and firmly all over the base and up the sides of the tin. Then place it on the baking sheet and bake on the centre shelf of the oven for 10-12 minutes, or until crisp and golden brown.",

Finally, add the lime juice and give it another quick whisk, then pour the whole lot on to the baked crust and return it to the oven for another 20 minutes. Ten minutes in, add the meringue mixture. Now remove it from the oven and, when it's completely cold and chill until needed. Serve.",

Strain if the sauce is lumpy (sift the flour to avoid this). Heat to boiling again, and add some cream (not strictly necessary, but improves the flavour and smoothness). Adjust the flavour with salt/spices if necessary.",

For my part, I like to leave out the peas and jam and serve instead a fresh salad and some sauteed mushrooms.

But if you have a newer or bigger crock pot, you may need to revise times downward, esp. after the bbq sauce is added. I think you need at least a couple of hours for it all to meld, but that may be all you need. Update: I recently bought a bigger crockpot, I think 5 or 6 qts. I cooked a 6 lb pork shoulder in it for 8 hours and it was shreddable at that point. Shredded, added the sauce, and cooked for another hour or so to meld everything. So use your best judgment on timing!",

I think this may depend on the size and shape of your roast and the size of your slow cooker. Remember that each time you remove the lid you lose heat and be careful, as turning a large piece of meat is awkward.",

    "title": "no knead whole wheat bread",
    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "1. Measure the dry ingredients. Use dry-ingredient measuring cups (avoid 2 cup measures, which compress the flour) to gently scoop up flour, then sweep the top level with a knife or spatula. Whisk together the flours, yeast, salt and vital wheat gluten in a 5-quart bowl, or, preferably, in a resealable, lidded (not airtight) plastic food container or food-grade bucket. Lidded (or even vented) plastic buckets designed for dough storage are readily available.",
      "2. Mix with water - kneading is unnecessary. Heat the water to slightly warmer than body temperature (about 100 degrees Fahrenheit). Add to the dry ingredients and mix without kneading, using a spoon, food processor (with dough attachment), or heavy-duty stand mixer (with paddle). You may need to get your hands wet to get the flour to incorporate if you're not using a machine. Don't knead! It isn't necessary.",
      "You're finished when everything is uniformly moist, without dry patches. This step is done in a matter of minutes, and yields a wet dough that remains loose enough to conform to the shape of its container.",
      "3. Allow to rise. Cover with a lid (not airtight) or cover loosely with plastic wrap. Allow the mixture to rise at room temperature until it begins to collapse (or at least flatten on top), which will take about 2 hours. Longer rising times - even overnight - will not change the result. Fully refrigerated wet dough is less sticky and is easier to work with than dough at room temperature. So, the first time you try our method, it's best to refrigerate the dough overnight (or at least 3 hours) before shaping a loaf.",
      "After it's been refrigerated, the dough will seem to have shrunk back upon itself. It will never rise again in the bucket, which is normal for our dough. Whatever you do, do not punch down this dough! With our method, you're trying to retain as much gas in the dough as possible, and punching it down knocks gas out and will make your loaves denser.",
      "On Baking Day.",
      "4. Quickly shape a loaf. First, prepare a pizza peel by sprinkling it liberally with cornmeal (or lining it with parchment paper or a silicone mat) to prevent your loaf from sticking to it when you slide it into the oven. Dust the surface of your refrigerated dough with flour. Pull up and cut off a 1-pound (grapefruit-size) piece of dough, using a serrated knife or kitchen shears. Hold the mass of dough in your hands and add a little more flour as needed so it won't stick to your hands. Gently stretch the surface of the dough around to the bottom on all four sides, rotating a quarter-turn as you go to form a ball. Most of the dusting flour will fall off; it's not intended to be incorporated into the dough. The bottom of the ball may appear to be a collection of bunched ends, but it will flatten out during resting and baking. The correctly shaped final product will be smooth and cohesive.",
      "5. Form a narrow, oval-shaped loaf and let it rest. Stretch the ball gently to elongate it, and taper the ends by rolling them between your palms and pinching them.",
      "6. Allow the loaf to rest - covered loosely with plastic wrap - on the pizza peel for 90 minutes (40 minutes if you're using fresh, unrefrigerated dough).",
      "Alternatively, you can allow the loaf to rest on a silicone mat or greased cookie sheet. Depending on the age of the dough, you may not see much rise during this period. More rising will occur during baking.",
      "7. Thirty minutes before baking, preheat the oven to 450 degrees, with a baking stone placed on the middle rack. Place an empty broiler tray for holding water on any other rack that won't interfere with the rising bread.",
      "8. Paint and slash. Just before baking, use a pastry brush to paint the top of the loaf with a little water. Sprinkle with the seed and nut mixture. Slash the loaf with quarter-inch-deep parallel cuts across the top, using a serrated bread knife.",
      "9. Baking with steam. After a 30-minute preheat, you're ready to bake. With a quick forward jerking motion of the wrist, slide the loaf off the pizza peel and onto the preheated baking stone. If you used parchment paper instead of cornmeal, it will slide onto the stone with the loaf. If you used a silicone mat or cookie sheet, just place it on the stone. Quickly but carefully pour about a cup of hot water into the broiler tray and close the door to trap the steam. Bake for about 30 minutes, or until the crust is richly browned and firm to the touch (smaller or larger loaves will require adjustments in resting and baking time).",
      "If you used parchment paper, a silicone mat, or a cookie sheet under the loaf, carefully remove it and bake the loaf directly on the stone or an oven rack when the loaf is about two-thirds of the way through baking.",
      "When you remove the loaf from the oven, it may audibly crackle, or \"sing,\" when initially exposed to room-temperature air. Allow the bread to cool completely, preferably on a wire cooling rack. The perfect crust may initially soften, but will firm up again when cooled.",
      "10. Store the remaining dough in your container in the refrigerator and use it over the next couple of weeks. You'll find that even one day's storage improves the flavor and texture of your bread. The dough ferments and takes on sourdough characteristics. When your bucket is empty, don't wash it! Mix another batch in the same container. The aged dough stuck to the sides will give you a head start on sourdough flavor. To take it even further, incorporate up to 2 cups of your old dough."

      "Slice the shallots in 1/4 inch slices, down to the root end. Toss the sliced shallots (onions) in a light coating of olive oil, a few grinds of black pepper and a good sprinkle of kosher salt. Put in a non-stick roasting pan or oven proof skillet and set in a 350 degree oven. Now all you have to do is leave the onions for about 45 minutes. Don't touch, don't move, don't shake - just leave them. This is what gives them caramalization - which gives them the depth of flavor that is needed for a great onion soup. It's also what makes it a soup to make for quiet days - there's not much to do! After the first 45 minutes, check the shallots, tossing to assess the browning. If there is just slight browning, return to the oven, checking every 10 minutes, until there is a lot of deep brown color, but not dried out or burnt.",
      "Bring the beef stock, water, brandy, thyme and bay leaf to a simmer. Add the braised shallots, and simmer for 45 minutes then taste for salt and pepper. If using fresh thyme, remove the stems. Preheat your broiler to high.",
      "As the broiler is heating up, time to prepare the cheese and bread - the two other components to this triumverate of a soup. Use the best Emmenthaler you can afford - this is a cave-aged Swiss Emmenthaler from a wonderful local cheese purveyor, Joppa Fine Foods. Because their artisinal cheeses vary by season I have used many different Emmenthalers for this soup, but always it is flavorful! My favorite way to use the cheese is to shred some to put directly on the soup, as well as full slices to place directly on the croutons.",
      "Put some nice thick slices of baguette under the broiler as it is heating up, just to toast lightly on both sides. Ladle soup into some bowls or crocks, add the toasted baguette slices and cover with the shredded/sliced Emmenthaler. Place under the broiler until bubbly and lightly browned - just a few minutes."

In Syria and Lebanon, and in some specialty grocery stores in North America, you can find elaborately carved mamoul molds. If you have a mold, oil it with olive oil and then oil again lightly every 3 or 4 mamoul. Fill the mold almost full of dough and use your thumb to press down in the center. This will make a hollow in the center and will also give you thin walls of dough around the edges. You may need less filling, say 1 teaspoon each. Place the filling in the center, then fold the thin walls over and pinch off any excess dough. Pull the shaped mamoul up gently from the mold and transfer to the baking sheet, decorative side up.

      "Sponge: Mix together the starter, the water, and 1 1/2 cups flour in a reasonably sized bowl. A slightly bigger bowl is always better. After all, this sponge is supposed to rise, and much as you want it to rise well, you don't want it to rise out of the bowl! (This is also something to watch out for when you feed your sourdough starter.)",
      "Cover the bowl with a damp cloth. If the cloth is dry, then the top of the sponge will dry out slightly as it ferments. Let it sit until foamy. The time of this is bound to vary considerably, depending on the starter. With my starter, it usually takes about 15 hours to get it really foamy. However long it takes, don't let it sit for too long. Too many cookbooks say to let it sit for a time that's too long, and by then the yeast's activity is way down, and the lactobacilli damage the gluten. If that happens, the bread almost certainly won't rise, at least not as much.",
      "Dough: Add the salt and the rest of the flour. Knead well. In the middle of kneading, wash out the bowl. This gives the gluten in the dough a chance to relax, and will make kneading it easier. Let rise in a greased bowl, covered by a damp dishtowel. When it's finished rising, punch it down. How long it takes for the dough to rise depends on your sourdough starter. Test the dough to see if it's done by prodding it with a finger. If your finger hardly dents it, it isn't done. If it leaves a depression that doesn't start filling in, the dough is ready for the next step.",
      "Lightly grease a baking sheet, or sprinkle it with cornmeal. (I prefer the texture of the bottom crust with the cornmeal. Also, the baking sheet is much easier to clean.) Shape, place on the baking sheet, and let rise again, still covered. Just before putting it in the oven, slash the top of the loaf with a sharp knife. This is more than just decorative; it allows the bread to rise better. If you don't slash it, the upper crust could lift off the bread (called a \"flying crust\"). (It does take some practice to slash the bread well.)",
      "Bake in a 425 degree F oven for 25 minutes. Let cool on a rack before cutting, or the bread won't be fully cooked inside.",
      "Variations:.",
      "Egg-Onion Sourdough: Before you add the salt to the sponge, mix in 2 eggs and 4 tbs. dried minced onion. This recipe produces a much larger loaf than the basic one, so you may want to divide it into two loaves.",
      "Oatmeal Sourdough: Replace the water you add to the sponge with 3/4 cups rolled oats cooked in 1 cup water. The oats don't make the loaf heavier than usual. This bread has an interesting taste, but it doesn't have a strong oatmeal flavor. The crust is wonderful, dark and crisp. The oats aren't very visible in the final product.",
      "Cheese-Pepper Sourdough: Add two oz. shredded gruyere and 1/2 teaspoons ground black pepper to the dough, just before you add the salt. (I've always used processed gruyere. Unprocessed would work too, but it might not blend into the bread's crumb as well. The crust is the best part, so this recipe would be very good as breadsticks.) I bet cheddar or parmesan would be good, too."
