Pat the dough into a disk. On a lightly floured work surface, roll out the dough into a 16- to 17-inch round about 1/4 inch thick. Line a large unrimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Roll the dough around the rolling pin and unroll it onto the prepared baking sheet. In a small bowl, combine 2 tablespoons of the sugar with the remaining 1 tablespoon of flour and sprinkle over the dough. Arrange the apple slices on top in overlapping concentric circles to within 3 inches of the edge. Fold the dough over the apples in a free-form fashion. Brush the apples with the melted butter and sprinkle with the remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons of sugar. Refrigerate the unbaked tart until slightly chilled, about 10 minutes. Preheat the oven to 400\u00b0. Bake the tart in the center of the oven for 1 hour, or until the apples are tender and golden and the crust is deep golden and cooked through.

      "Lightly butter the two baking or [sided] cookie sheets. In a large, heavy saucepan or Dutch oven, combine the granulated sugar, brown sugar, corn syrup, water and salt. Cook over medium heat until all the sugars are dissolved. Continue to cook while stirring constantly until the mixture just begins coming to a full boil. Stirring mixture occasionally, continue to cook until a candy thermometer inserted measures 234 degrees, or the 'soft ball' stage. Stir in any and ALL nuts - 2cups, and remainder of butter. Continue to cook - stirring occasionally to keep nuts from scorching until temperature reaches 300 degrees, or what's called the 'hard crack' stage, then remove pot from heat. Stir in baking soda and vanilla extract immediately upon removing from heat - the mixture will 'foam up', giving you 'light & airy' brittle. Pour equally divided amounts onto each sheet, then tilt and turn until mixture covers it entirely. When completely cooled, 'crack' into pieces while still on sheet - do not remove brittle from sheet. Melt 3/4 pound of white chocolate in a double-boiler, making sure it's broken up for even melting until it's 'pourable', then - in a zigzag fashion or any way you'd like, pour over brittle covering entirely or leaving some spaces bare. When chocolate hardens, break brittle into pieces, remove from sheet, and store in any airtight container in a cool, dry place....enjoy!"

In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the butter and sugar until light and fluffy, 3 to 4 minutes, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed. Beat in eggs, one at a time, then beat in vanilla. With the mixer on low speed, add the flour mixture in three parts, alternating with the milk and beginning and ending with the flour; beat until combined after each addition. Divide the batter between the prepared pans, and smooth with an offset spatula. Bake, rotating the pans halfway through, until cakes are golden brown and a cake tester inserted in the centers comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes. Transfer pans to a wire rack to cool 20 minutes. Invert cakes onto the rack; peel off the parchment. Reinvert cakes and let them cool completely, top sides up. Using a serrated knife, trim the tops of the cakes to make level. Place one layer on a cake plate, and spread top with 3/4 cup Dark Chocolate Frosting. Place the other cake layer on top. Spread the entire cake with remaining frosting, swirling to coat in a decorative fashion. Cake can be kept in the refrigerator, covered with a cake dome, for up to 3 days. Let cake sit at room temperature for 20 minutes before serving."

Be careful not to hold the can too close to the flame here. I'm going to start this salmon with the flesh side down first. I've seasoned that with a dry seasoning mixture of garlic salt and lemon pepper so I'm going to get some good lines on this guy. Then we're going to flip him on the skin side. Once the flesh side is showing up, I've got a butter mixture over here that's got some beer butter and onions and garlic salt in it so I can brush that fish down throughout the cooking process. If you notice, I've got these dials cranked just above the off position. I don't want a really intense heat for this fish, but it's hot enough to cook on. So now we'll shut the lid here and get some of that good smoke kickin'.",

Pat into a 5-by-6-inch rectangle, sprinkle with flour, flip, and dust again. Working from the center out and adding more flour as needed, roll the dough until roughly 15-by-11 inches and very thin.

Place the beef in a 2-gallon ziptop bag. Place the bag in a stockpot and pour the brine into it, over the meat. Seal the bag, squeezing as much air out of it as possible so the meat remains completely submerged. Refrigerate the beef in the bag for 10 days.",

Spread the rub over the beef with your hands, covering all surfaces, and place the beef in a 2-gallon zip-top bag; seal the bag, squeezing out as much of the air as possible. Place the bag on a baking dish and refrigerate for a week, turning the bag over once a day. This is known as dry brining-you will notice each day that more liquid leaches from the beef.",
      "On the day you wish to serve the beef, place it in a large pot with all of the accumulated juices in the bag. Add water as needed to cover the meat and bring to a boil over high heat. Lower the heat to medium, cover the pot, and let the beef simmer for 3 hours, until fork tender but not falling apart.",
      "Spoon the warm parsley sauce into a small bowl. Drain the beef and transfer it to a cutting board. Let it rest for 15 minutes and then slice it 1/2 inch thick, cutting lengthwise, against the grain. Arrange the meat on a serving platter or individual plates; serve with the sauce on the side, along with your chosen side dishes."

Refrigerate for 30 minutes or until ready to use. (Covered tightly, the marinade will keep for a few days in the refrigerator.) Slide the handle of a wooden spoon, or the edge of a butter knife, below the membrane on the back of each rack of ribs, and then use your fingers to grab it and pull it off. Season the ribs aggressively with salt and pepper. Place each rack of ribs on a large sheet of aluminum foil, and slather with the jerk marinade. Wrap the ribs tightly in the foil, and place on a sheet pan in the oven for 90 minutes. Remove the sheet pan from the oven, carefully unwrap the ribs and anoint again with the jerk marinade. Return the ribs, uncovered, to the oven, and continue roasting for an additional 90 minutes, or until the meat is crusty and has just begun to pull back from the bone. Remove ribs from oven, allow to rest 5 minutes, then slice into individual ribs and serve on a warmed platter."

Use a pair of kitchen tongs to add a single layer of the eggplant to the pan. Cook them until they are golden brown, about 2 minutes per side. Remove from the oil and transfer to the warming rack on the grill so the eggplant can drain as the others cook. Season lightly with salt.In an 11 x17-inch baking dish, spoon about 1/4 of the tomato sauce on the bottom. Top with a layer of the fried eggplant; the eggplant slices can overlap slightly. Top with about 1/3 of the mozzarella slices. Sprinkle with about 1/4 of the Parmesan and provolone cheeses. Top with a layer of torn basil leaves. Spoon sauce and repeat the layering.Place the dish in the oven and cook until the cheese is melted."

Then, when the crust is finished baking for 20 minutes, pour lemony mixture over hot crust. Reduce oven temperature to 300 degrees, and bake the bars in the middle of oven until set, about 30-35 minutes. Cool completely in the pan on a cooling rack, and then cut into 24 bars. These bars keep well if covered and chilled for about 3 days, (if they last that long!). Sift powdered sugar over bars just before serving for best presentation.

      "1. Mix lemon zest, rosemary, garlic, salt and pepper in small bowl. Following illustrations 6 and 7, loosen the skin on each leg and thigh; rub the herb mixture under the skin. Loosen the breast skin; rub the remaining herb mixture under the skin. Place chicken in a gallon size zipper-lock bag with lemon juice and olive oil. Seal and refrigerate from 2 to 24 hours; return to room temperature before cooking.",
      "",
      "2. Ignite about 6 quarts (1 large chimney, or about 6 pounds) charcoal briquettes and burn until covered with thin coating of light gray ash, about 20 minutes. Empty chimney and spread coals in an even layer. Position grill grate over coals, cover grill, and heat grate until hot, about 5 minutes; scrape grate clean with grill brush. Lightly dip small wad paper towels in vegetable oil; holding wad with tongs, wipe grill grate. Place chicken skin side down, on grill rack. Set a jelly roll or other flat plan on top of chicken. Place two bricks in pan to weigh down chicken as it grills. Cover and grill until the chicken skin is deep brown and shows grill marks, about 12 to 15 minutes. Turn chicken with tongs, replace jelly roll pan, bricks, and grill lid, and continue cooking until instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part of thigh registers 170 to 175 degrees, about 5 to 10 more minutes.",
      "",
      "3. Remove chicken from grill; cover with foil and let rest 10 to 15 minutes. Carve, following illustrations 8 and 9, and serve."

      "3. Once the dough feels firm and dry, and can form a craggy looking ball, it's time to start kneading. An under-kneaded pasta won't have the same kind of snappy spring as a properly worked dough. It's almost impossible to over-knead a dough, though, since it'll eventually build up so much elasticity that it won't allow you to continue. Around ten minutes of kneading will allow you get a smooth ball of dough without drying being an issue. To knead, simply press the heel of your hand into the ball of dough, pushing forward and down. Rotate the ball 45 degrees and do it again. You'll want to keep going until the dough no longer looks powdery-it should have a smooth, elastic texture. If your dough feels wet and tacky, add more flour as necessary.",
