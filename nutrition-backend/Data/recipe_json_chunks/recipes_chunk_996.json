Since the mixture should already be chilled, the grapes are excellent substitutes for ice (no watering down). Simple enough and the grapes, like the Spiked Melon Balls, will be fun to eat! Fruit with a Punch! You can add a splash of Grenadine for sweetness and color. Just need sweetness? -- make some simple sugar (1 part water to 1 part sugar then boil/stir until syrup) and pour amount desired. Keep simple sugar in the fridge to use again. If using ice, make sure the cubes are large.",

Add balls to bowl and pour in Everclear until it covers about 1/2 of the fruit. If too much Everclear is used, you will drain and waste because the fruit can only absorb so much. Prepare the Spiked Balls the day before consumption or at least 4 hours in advance. Turn a few times to ensure even infusion of the Everclear. Friendly reminder -- Everclear is powerful stuff, 190 proof (95% alcohol by volume!) to be exact though some bottles are sold as 151 proof (75.5% alcohol by volume). Either version is stout to say the least! While it complements this drink recipe, we don't recommend friends toss back a bunch as a snack! As a comparison, the average vodka is 80 proof or 40% alcohol by volume.",

If you're using a stand mixer, beat with the flat beater for about 3 minutes at medium-high speed; then scrape the dough into the center of the bowl, switch to the dough hook, and knead for about 5 minutes at medium speed. It may have formed a very soft ball, but will probably still be sticking to the bottom of the bowl. If you're using a bread machine, simply let it go through its entire cycle. If you find the dough isn't coming together, add a tablespoon or two of flour.",
      "Lightly grease the mixing bowl or a large (8-cup) measure; round the dough into a ball, and place it in the bowl or measure. Cover, and let rise until very puffy, about 1 1/2 to 2 hours. If you're using a bread machine and the dough hasn't doubled in size when the cycle is complete, simply let it rest in the machine for another 30 to 60 minutes.",

      "Mix the reserved egg white with 1 tablespoon cold water, and brush some onto the surface of the rolls; this will give them a satiny crust.",

      "Tips from the bakers.",
      "Sweet breads can be agonizingly slow risers. Why? Because sugar attracts water, and when it's in bread dough, it pulls water away from yeast - leaving the yeast thirsty and unable to grow. If you're using regular yeast not formulated for sweet dough, you may find the rising time for these rolls will be longer by 30 minutes or more for each rise.",
      "This is a very wet dough, and can be tricky to handle. If you're having difficulty, we suggest lightly oiling your hands and counter before attempting to roll out the buns.",
      "If you want to use fresh pineapple juice: microwave the juice for 2 minutes until it reaches 200\u00b0F and allow to cool to lukewarm before using. The process of heating will kill any enzymes in the juice, which would otherwise destroy the gluten.",
      "To make hamburger-sized buns, prepare the dough according to the recipe instructions, and after the rise divide it into six equal pieces. Round each piece into a smooth ball, and place them into the lightly-greased wells of a hamburger bun pan, flattening them gently. Let the buns rise for an hour, until they fill the wells and are nicely puffy, then brush the rolls with the egg wash, and bake them for 20 to 25 minutes until they're a deep golden brown."

Slowly stir in milk as not to allow lumps to form until all of the milk has been added. Continue stirring over medium-low heat until thick, 4 to 5 minutes.",
      "3. Stir the milk mixture into the stockpot, and cook soup until heated through. Serve immediately.",
      "My Note: Sometime I do a few changes I do at time to play with my food -- I didn't bother peeling the potatoes, just washed and diced them up. Also added some chopped carrots for color and flavor. Only added about 1/2tsp of pepper and no extra salt, just the boullion. I like my potatoe soup a little bit thicker than it turned out. I'm not sure if I did something wrong with the flour mixture or if it's just a thinner broth. So I mashed the veges real lightly with potatoe masher and added instant mashed potatoe flakes to thicken it up a bit!",
      "This is one of the best ham & potato soups I've ever did! I'm always looking for ham recipes, as I often buy a half fully cooked ham, cube, and divide up into freezer bags for quick meals. Making the white sauce separately really added the right creaminess to the potato/ham & veggie mixture. I used a can of chicken broth for part of the liquid, as I didn't have any bullion. Also threw in some shredded carrots I had on hand, plus 1/2 cup shredded cheese to the white sauce after it had thickened. Also, (to disguise the carrots), added a sprinkle of cheese to each bowl upon serving. Very creamy and tasty. A possibly adding corn next time.",
      "I used a ham bone with a little meat left on it. I boiled it to make stock and used this in place of the water. Then stripped the meat off the bone to use in the soup. I also put a few sprigs of fresh thyme in it -- the result was soooo good. I made it for a friend who was sick and her husband was begging me to get them a pizza and let us have the soup!. I sauted the onions in a little vegetable oil until soft, added all the ingredients except the butter/flour and milk to the crockpot and cooked all day until the potatoes were nice and soft. I also added one diced carrot. About an hour before dinner I made the rue with the flour and butter and used a 12 oz. and 5 oz. can of evaporated milk instead of regular milk. I don't like to use regular milk in crockpot recipes because it sometimes curdles on me. I added about a 1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder to the soup, it just seemed like it needed a little something when I tasted it before serving. Topped each bowl of soup with fresh ground pepper and sliced green onions. This soup is rich, thick and creamy. Very hearty and filling, perfect for a cold winter night meal! My family really enjoyed this served with a homemade cheesy garlic pizza."

I have also found that it makes a difference if you use quick cooking oats or old fashioned. In my experience it takes more old fashioned oats than quick cooking and I like the texture of the quick cooking better.

      "First, make \"1st dry rub\" mix by combining all the dry ingredients together in a bowl making sure to break up brown sugar lumps (9TB tender quick, 1/2c brown sugar, 1/4c cayenne, 1/3c black pepper, 1/4c white pepper, 1/4c paprika, 3TB onion pwdr, 1/4c granulated garlic, 2TB celery seed, 2TB mustard powder, 2TB cinnamon). Once that's done, make \"wet cure mix\" by combining 3 or 4 tbsp of dry rub mix with 1 cup cold water in separate small container with a lid. Cover and shake well to dissolve all dry rub mix in the water. This liquid will be the wet cure that is injected. Set wet cure and remaining dry rub mix aside for now.",
      "Cut up the meat into roughly 1 pound chunks. This will make it easier to inject the wet cure. After that, slice the meat into roughly 1 or 2 inch wide slices. Inject each piece with the wet-cure (as much as it can hold -- about a syringe-full each). After injection, slice up the chunks and set them into pans.",
      "Now liberally rub all sides of meat with remaining dry rub, make sure they are coated well. Then place meat in two, one-gallon Ziploc bags along with the left over dry rub mix. Put both bags into a 9x13 roasting pan and into the fridge.",
      "Now wait for the butt to cure into Tasso. During the next 5 days massage and turn them over every 12 hours. Then we will rinse and smoke our Tasso.",
      "O.K, it's day 5 and we are ready to smoke. But first we have a couple of steps. We need to make a new, final dry rub (1/4c celery seed, 1/4c sylvias secret seasoning, 1/2c black pepper, 1/4c white pepper, 1/2c brown sugar, 3TB cayenne, 3TB granulated garlic, 1/4c coarse kosher salt). If you are unable to find Sylvia's Secret Seasoning, here is the recipe: 1 Tablespoon of dried basil, 1 Teaspoon dried oregano, 1/2 Teaspoon of dried thyme, 1/4 Teaspoon dried rosemary crumbled. Combine as needed to obtain 1/4 cup. Combine all above ingredients and mix well. Store in airtight container until ready to use.",
      "Pull the curing meat out of the refrigerator and open the bag. First up is to rinse the cure-rub off the meat. Once all meat is rinsed off, plug the sink and soak them in cold water for 1 hour. During the soaking, change the water 3 times.",
      "Now it's time for the final rub. Dry each piece on a few layers of paper towels, then rub, and then stack onto a single pan. Start the charcoal for the smoker. Stabilize smoker temp at 225\u00b0F The plan is to keep it between 200 degrees and 225 Fahrenheit during the smoke. We want to cook it of course, but also want the drying out effect of the lower temp's.",
      "After just a bit over 5 hours, the meat should be ready. pull temp's on the pieces, especially the thick ones and call it done once they reach 165 degrees Fahrenheit minimum.",
      "Transfer meat into three pans to cool down to room temperature maybe 30 minutes or so, then vacuum-sealer went to work. Got 5 bags of 5 pieces each, so I figure there was about a pound, maybe a few ounces less, per bag. This is plenty for a single recipe dish of whatever it is you want to make."

      "**************************************************.",
      "Preserved lemon: I usually start with about 5 lbs of organic lemons, juicing enough of them to yield about a cup. Go for organic ones, otherwise they have a coating of wax on them to preserve shelf life in the supermarket. You will need a glass jar with an air-tight seal. Combine ~ a tablespoon of coriander seed with ~ a tablespoon of fennel seed. Place 1 bay leaf and 1 cinnamon stick in the bottom of glass jar. Have a small bowl of Kosher salt nearby. Slice lemons in quarters ALMOST down to stem end, but leave intact. Place coriander and fennel seed inside lemon and also fill with salt. Place cut side down into glass jar, squeezing as many into the jar as you can. As you squeeze them, some of the lemon juice is released, but not enough to fill the jar. Just continue packing in as many lemons as you can and add additional salt between layers of lemon. Top off with freshly squeezed lemon juice. Then refrigerate for a month before using. I think this is Jamie Oliver's technique, but there are many out there. He has also suggested doing this with other citrus, like limes and mandarin oranges. Meyer lemons work nicely. Some techniques suggest a layer of olive oil on top, and this works well, too. If refrigerated, they last indefinitely."

The curd will have settled into the bottom of the bowl, and at this point you have to work quickly or risk over-cooking the curd. Using the wooden spoon stir and stretch the mozzarella. By stretching the cheese you insure that all the curds have completely melted. The curds will become incredibly soft and have buttery shine, and also, it smells wonderful. At this point I place the curd in the second bowl of warm water so not to have the cheese get to tough. Form the mozzarella into tomato size balls or larger, your prefrence and then drop the mozzarella into the salted ice water to stop the cooking process.
