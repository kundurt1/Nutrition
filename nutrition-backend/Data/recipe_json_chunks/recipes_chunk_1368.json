Remove the pan from heat and set aside to cool completely, about 1 hour. This step is crucial because if the spices are not cooled properly, they will form a paste when ground rather than a powder. Place all the roasted spices into a heavy-duty spice grinder and grind until you achieve a fine powder consistency. Store the spice mix in an airtight container. It will keep for several months although the aroma will fade with time.",

Tear off another portion and repeat, slightly overlapping it with the first. Continue, wetting your hands as you go, until the top layer is covered, then smooth out.",

If using a rectangular dish, the most customary is a diamond pattern, which can be achieved by doing criss-crossing diagonal lines.

Once you have created your pattern, cut all the way through the kubbeh along the lines that you want each serving sizes to be.",

Season with salt and pepper as you go. To the pan add the diced leeks, saute for about 10 to 15 mins. The leeks will start to caramelize at this point add the carrots and shiitake mushrooms, the sage and thyme. Cook until the carrots soften, about 10 more mins. If needed add more olive oil.",

      "Heat your stock on the back burner. You always want to use a hot stock when making risotto. If you use cold stock, it will result in hard, uncooked grains that will not release their starches.",
      "2) Dice the onion. Heat about one TB olive oil in a pan, add the onion and cook over medium flame. You want to sweat the onion rather than brown it, so watch the heat.\r\n\r\nWhen the onion is tender, add the barley and saute. It will begin to smell toasty and turn light brown.",
      "Deglaze the pan with 2 TB of the white wine and cook till it has been fully absorbed by the barley.",
      "Begin to add the stock by the ladleful. I used a ladle that holds 1/2 cup of liquid.",
      "When you drag your spoon across the bottom of the pan and it leaves a trail, you know that it is time to add more stock.\r\n\r\nNever leave your risotto unattended. You need to add the stock at precisely the right time or you will end up with unevenly cooked grains. This is one dish to which you must devote your undivided attention and pamper into being.",
      "Rinse your edamame in a mesh strainer with cold water. This will thaw the beans.",
      "Get your diced summer squash into a separate pan with the garlic, a splash of olive oil and salt to taste. Over medium flame, cook until just soft, then kill the fire. No color here, and don't overcook.",
      "Strip the leaves from your herb stems and rough chop. Get the herbs and edamame into the pan. The residual heat will cook the edamame and bloom the herbs.",
      "Back to the barley. You may or may not need all of the stock as required. It depends on how thirsty your grains are. If you find that you are running out of stock before the barley is sufficiently cooked, go ahead and add a little water to the pot, and keep ladling as you were. If the grains are cooked and there is stock left over, do not be tempted to add the rest to the pan merely to use it up or you can kiss your risotto goodbye and have soup for supper instead.",
      "A note on salting risotto. It's one of those dishes that you season toward the end, because it is easy to over salt given that you are concentrating the stock as you cook the grains. As well, most people do add cheese to the finish, which can alone season the dish with its salt content. I have made risotto that needed no additional salt after adding the cheese.\r\n\r\nTry this: When the grains are about 80% done, go ahead and get some salt into the pan. You can safely adjust the seasoning at the finish.\r\n\r\nBack to your barley.",
      "Your risotto is done when the grains are tender but al dente. That means 'to the teeth', in Italian. Meaning, you don't want mush. There should be some body in those grains, and a lovely, unctuous sauce in the pan.\r\n\r\nTaste and adjust the seasoning with salt.",
      "Stir your dandies and veg into the barley. The greens will wilt in a minute. Then pour in a splash of white wine, about 1 TB, cook it out for about 30 seconds, and add about 1 TB of olive oil and the coconut milk. Stir all this in. The finished barley should be rich and creamy. Now would be the time to add cheese, if you are not vegan, or not into labels."

Stir the icing until it is the text of thick cream and everything is combined. Take some of the icing and place it in a small bowl, add some yellow food colouring to this icing and mix well. Put this icing in a piping bag with a very thin nozzle, or use a disposable bag and cut a very thin nozzle. Add pink (or a small amount of red) food colouring to the remaining icing and stir well to combine. Pour the pink icing over the top of the mille-feuille and use a palette knife to spread the icing evenly.",

Using a cocktail stick, pull it back and forth through the icing to create the desired feathering on the cake. Leave the icing to set for around 15-20mins before attempting to cut it. Using a serrated pastry knife try to line the knife up with your lengths of rhubarb and cut the pastries into 3.75cm sized slices. The rhubarb doesn't cut well with the serrated knife, so that is why the pieces of rhubarb were trimmed.",

Add in 1 tablespoon freshly grated ginger, 1 tablespoon sugar, the lemon juice, sliced jalapeno and stir to combine. The jalapeno will give your ginger beer that kick you can feel in the back of your throat -- if you don't roll like that, omit it. Pour into a glass jar -- one that's large enough for the liquid to fit comfortably, with a bit of extra space. Cover with a clean, dry kitchen towel and secure it over the jar with a rubber band. Place jar in the warmest place in your house. Next to your heater, near the refrigerator, or by a heat vent.",
      "Every day for the next week you'll have to \"feed\" your ginger beer. First off, feel the bottle -- it should be slightly warm. If it's too cold your yeast will go into hibernation, and if it's too hot it could kill your yeast. Take off the towel and add another tablespoon of grated ginger, and another tablespoon of sugar. Stir until sugar dissolves, then replace the towel and put your plant back in a warm place. Do this every day for a week -- think of it as your neighbor's dog you've promised to dog sit.",
      "After about a week, you should see small bubbles floating to the surface of your plant. You can certainly keep your plant at this stage longer; the more you feed it, the more concentrated the ginger flavor will become. You can adjust flavors later!",
      "Now it's time to bottle. Think ahead to how many bottles of ginger beer you'll want to make. Make sure to use PLASTIC soda bottles -- glass bottles could explode from carbonation, which would not be pretty. Estimate how much water you'll need to fill these bottles 3/4 of the way full, then boil it to purify. Dissolve enough sugar into the water that it tastes very sweet -- as sweet as soda. You can adjust this later as well.",
      "Using a cheesecloth, strain the plant out into a large measuring cup, or a bowl. Using a funnel, add about a cup of the plant liquid to each clean, dry soda bottle -- more if you want it stronger, less if you want it less intense. Add sweet water to the bottles until they are 3/4 of the way full, then stir with a chopstick to combine. you can dip your finger in and taste here to see if the mixture needs more ginger. If so, add more plant liquid. Don't worry if it seems too sweet: the yeast will eat the sugar and turn it to alcohol, so most of it will disappear. You can add it back later.",
      "Seal the bottles tightly with their caps and place them back in the warm place you had your plant. Squeeze the bottles once a day to test how they're carbonating. After a few days they should be hard to compress; when they are impossible to compress at all, slowly start to unscrew the cap just until the carbonation begins to release -- do not open it all the way! Do this whenever you can't compress the bottle at all.",
      "After a week and a half to two weeks, the yeast should have eaten up most of the sugar in the bottle. This means your ginger beer is ready to open up and taste! If you have multiple bottles, open one up and taste test. Add more sugar or lemon juice if you think your ginger beer needs it. Serve ice cold with citrus, and a rum float if you're feeling dangerous. Make sure to consume the whole bottle within 24 hours once you've opened it -- feel free it enlist a friend here. It's impossible to gauge the alcohol content of your ginger beer, but it should be a bit less than a light beer. Enjoy!"

Season the chicken all over with the black pepper, red pepper flakes, and salt, rubbing the seasonings into the skin until it is well coated. Put the chicken skin side up in a large dish. Combine the lemon juice and olive oil in a small bowl and pour it over the bird. Let the chicken marinate at room temperature for 1 hour, turning it over halfway through.",

Grill the chicken skin side down in the center of the grill until well marked and slightly charred in places, about 20 minutes. Baste the chicken often with the leftover marinade, taking care not to drip too much oil onto the coals to avoid flare-ups. Move the chicken to a cooler spot on the grill if there are flare-ups and the chicken begins to burn. Turn the chicken and grill the other side until the thigh juices run clear when pierced, about 20 minutes.",

Baking hot filling in a chilled crust at 400\u00b0 F for 25 to 30 minutes produces a smooth, shiny good textured custard and a well-baked crust free from soaking. But if your pie dish is thicker glass or ceramic instead of metal, or you loathe underdone bottom crust, you might still want to blind bake it a little. Here's what we'd recommend: Blind bake at 350 F lined with parchment and filled with baking beans/weights until sides are dry and firm, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove weights, then bake until completely dry and firm (including bottom crust) and starting to turn golden, 5 to 10 minutes more. Cool thoroughly. Then watch the pie closely as it bakes -- it might be done early, since the cold raw crust isn't there to protect it. And if the edges are starting to look wrinkled while the middle is very jiggly, turn the heat down to 350."

      "Cook the tofu: Heat oven to 400 degrees. Cut the tofu lengthwise into four pieces, then cut each of those into generous bite-sized squares or rectangles. Place on a parchment lined baking sheet and put into the oven. You don't need to wait for it to heat all the way before putting them in.) Bake for 15 - 25 minutes, depending on how hot the oven is when you start baking. See note, below, if you want to cook the tofu on the top of the stove. You should do that pan frying right before you're ready to start cooking the vegetables.",
      "Make the stock. (See instructions below.)",
      "Prepare the vegetables: thinly slice the top half of the napa cabbage, then thoroughly rinse and drain. Put those leafy pieces into a container. Then thinly slice the rest, which will consist of the large, hard white middle, and rinse and drain them; set those pieces aside in a separate container.",
      "Cut the bok choy in half, crosswise, and rinse the dark green leafy pieces. Shake off any excess water, and put in the container with the soft leafy pieces of the napa cabbage. Cut off the hard bottom of each bok choy, then remove what's left and wash. Stack those hard stems and slice into thirds or quarters, lengthwise. Put those pieces into the same container as the hard, mostly white pieces of napa cabbage. (If using broccoli florets, make sure they're fairly small, and put them with the napa cabbage leaves.)",
      "While the tofu is cooking, start making the noodles. Cook them according to the instructions on the package. Once you drain them, toss immediately with sesame oil and divide between the bowls in which you'll be plating the soup. Cover them if you won't be serving within a few minutes.",
      "Cook the vegetables: Heat a large skillet and then add the peanut oil. cook the hard portions of the napa cabbage and bok choy for about five minutes, along with the scallion pieces, turning frequently.",
      "Add to the drained broth the cooked napa cabbage and bok choy pieces, the reserved leafy pieces of cabbage and bok choy (or broccoli florets, if using), the doenjang or fish sauce (or a couple teaspoons of soy sauce, if not using either of those), brown sugar, fermented black beans, and vinegar to the stock. If using doenjang, thin it with a half cup of broth before adding to the pot. (If using red miso, add it at the very end, right before serving, thinning it with a cup or so of the hot broth.) Heat the soup back up to a low boil, and cook for 2-3 minutes.",
      "Taste the broth. If it needs seasoning, add a teaspoon or two of soy sauce - or more to taste.",
      "Shortly before serving, add the cilantro leaves (reserving a few for garnish) and the cooked tofu. Simmer it just enough to heat the tofu through. (If you add it sooner, it will soak up too much broth.) Turn off the heat and drizzle in the sesame oil.",
      "Ladle the hot soup over the noodles in the soup plates. Give each bowl a good stir. Garnish with the reserved whole cilantro leaves. Let your guests stir in hot chili oil, to taste.",
      "Enjoy! ;o)",
      "To cook the tofu on the top of the stove: cut the tofu into equal sized rectangles. (I cut crosswise, as if slicing a cake to fill between layers, then cut those rectangles each into four pieces.) Put the tofu slices between two cutting boards; then put some heavy but stable objects, such as large unopened cans, a stone mortar and pestle, etc., on the top cutting board to press the liquid out of the tofu. Let rest while you prep your vegetables. Then, drain and cut the rectangles into smaller, easier-to-eat rectangles. Pat dry. Heat a large skillet and then add the peanut oil. When it spits when you flick a drop of water on it, add the tofu. Cook over medium heat, resisting the urge to turn the tofu pieces for at least two minutes. You want them to get a bit crusty, so they'll hold up better in the soup. After two minutes or so, turn the tofu pieces over and cook for another minute or so. When lightly browned, remove from the pan.",
      "As with most of my soups, I view a recipe like this as merely a template. Depending on what's on hand, you can use whatever vegetables you like -- kale or standard green cabbage instead of bok choy and/or napa cabbage, sugar snap peas or regular string beans, cut on the diagonal into one-inch pieces, julienned carrots for color - whatever you like. Just make sure to put the harder vegetables into the pot first, adding the more delicate ones at the very end, to ensure the best texture and color. ;o)",
      "Put all of the ingredients into a heavy pot with 6 cups of water. Simmer for about 15 minutes, then let stand for another 15 minutes, or more, if you have the time.",
      "Strain the broth. You should have about 4 cups. Don't worry if you have less; just make up the difference with a bit of filtered water. If you have much more than 4 cups, simmer it for a while longer to reduce it."

If you are going to ice them I would roll the dough out to 1/4 inch thickness instead of 1/8 inch so that they are a little sturdier and easier to handle. Our family prefers them thin and crispy with the sugar sprinkles, that's how my Mom has made them for 30 odd years. Use a spatula if necessary to move them onto the lined baking sheet. Place them about 1 inch apart. Knead the scraps into another disk and roll out again, keep doing so until there is no dough left to cut out cookies. Now sprinkle with coloured sugars and place in oven for 8-9 minutes, maybe a minute or 2 longer, depending on the thickness of the dough.",
      "When finished, pull out of the oven, let cool for a few minutes then transfer the cookies onto cooling racks. When completely cool, store in a sealed container in the freezer for up to 3 months. Bring out as you need."

(A recipe like this is a great reason to freeze fresh when we can!) If your corn doesn't come naturally wrapped don't fret - wrap each ear in aluminum foil and roast away as directed above. \r\n\r\nWhen I roast corn on the grill as a dish unto itself, I soak the ears, with the husks intact for an hour. For this recipe however, the quick soak in water while the grill is heating will help to steam the corn while not water logging the cobs and allowing them to flavor the stock.\r\n\r\nAs with any hot peppers, Chipotles will vary in their \"hotness\" from batch to batch. For this reason, my recipe incorporates only 1 pepper to start. If you'd like a little more pizazz in the Chowder, you can add another minced Chipotle at the very end. Since they are already prepared by the process used to turn them from Jalapenos into Chipotles with Adobo, you can add them at this time. Do note, however, that the additional Adobo Sauce will greatly increase the Southwestern note already present in the Chowder. You may wish to rinse off this \"late arrival\" pepper.\r\n\r\nYou can flavor your \"croutons\" by tossing the just prepared hot popcorn with a little garlic powder, onion powder, or chili powder. If you want the popcorn salty use the superfine variety sold near the popcorn at your grocer. Kosher or even regular table salt will not cling to the unbuttered popcorn kernels."

      "add the rapini to the flour and dust lightly to ensure the rapini are dry before moving rapini to the egg mixture. add porcini pieces to the eggs wash and make sure they all of the surfaces are well-coated in the egg. then transfer to the panko mixture. coat the rapini in the panko and porcini, pressing the coating on with your fingers or a utensil.",
      "heat oil and butter in a wide non-stick skillet over medium-high heat. distribute the oil and butter evenly and when the fat is hot, lay the rapini in the skillet in a single layer. do not crowd the skillet, fry in two batches if necessary. season with remaining salt (1/4 tsp) and pepper (1/8 tsp). fry on one side until the crust turns golden brown (about 2-3 minutes). turn rapini over and fry on the other side until golden. serve hot. (if making ahead, rapini can sit at room temperate for up to 4 hours. reheat in a 250 degree oven for 10-15 minutes, or at a higher heat for 5-10 minutes.) serve hot."

Meanwhile, to a food processor add the quartered onion and pulse until you achieve a fine paste. Transfer the paste to a mesh sieve and remove as much liquid as possible then return the onion paste to the food processor and to it add 400g/14 oz of the minced lamb or beef.",
      "Strain the burghul very well of any liquid so that it's very dry and mix in 1 tablespoon of the salt, all the herbs and spices, reserving 1/2 teaspoon of the allspice for use later in the recipe. Add the spiced burghul to the meat and onion in the food processor and pulse for a few minutes until you achieve a fine, emulsified mixture. You may need to stop the food processor every once in a while and scrape the sides to ensure the meat is evenly worked.",
      "To create the meat filling, place a frying pan on medium heat, add the vegetable oil and heat through for about a minute and then add the sliced red onions for about 5 minutes or until softened. Add the remaining lamb or beef (300g/10/1/2 oz) to the pan with the remaining allspice and salt, mix well and brown the meat for about 8-10 minutes. Stir in the pomegranate molasses and toasted pine nuts. Taste and adjust seasoning.",
      "Pre-heat the oven to 200C/400F/6G. To a small bowl add some water and ice cube (this keeps your fingers cool while handling the meat and makes spreading a little easier.) Grease a 9in/23cm in diameter x 1 1/2 in/ 4cm thick round pan with olive oil. Remove 1/3 of the prepared meat paste and spread it out into the base of the greased pan, creating a thin, even layer. You can dap your fingers into the ice cold water to help with spreading the meat but you just want drops of water on your fingers or else the meat becomes too wet. Next, evenly spread the filling mixture across the first layer and then remove about half of the remaining meat paste and flatten it in between the palms of your hands before laying it above the layer of filling. Repeat once more with the remaining paste. Dab your fingers in the ice water and then very gently stretch the meat to connect it together creating an even, top layer.",
      "Using a knife, gently score the top layer diagonally and then across again to create diamond shapes. Create a small hole in the centre and drizzle over about 2-3 tablespoons of the olive oil. This gives it a nice golden brown colour as well as adding a bit more to the final flavour. Bake uncovered in the oven for 40 minutes until golden brown. During the last 5 minutes turn the grill on high and allow the top layer to crisp up. Make sure you keep a close eye on it during this time to avoid burning it. Serve with cucumber and mint yogurt."

Then add in the raspberry jam and mix it into the cranberry sauce until everything is smooth and incorporated. Taste for sugar, adding more as needed. (This will make extra jam, but I was extremely happy about it. I kept it in my refrigerator all week and ate it with yogurt, by the spoonful, and on Merrill's Cream Biscuits.)",
      "Now start on the cakes! Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0 F. Get out two 9- x 2-inch cake pans and two baking sheets.",
      "Whisk together the flour, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt. Set aside.",
      "Butter and flour the sides of one of the cake pans (not the bottom). In a small saucepan, melt 6 tablespoons of butter. Sprinkle in 6 tablespoons of sugar and cook, stirring, until the mixture comes to a boil. Pour this evenly over the bottom of the cake pan, then scatter over the cranberries, chopped nuts, and chopped candied ginger. Smooth this layer out evenly with a spatula, pressing down gently. Set aside.",
      "Use a stand mixer or hand beaters to beat the remaining 2 sticks of butter on medium speed until smooth. Add the brown sugar and continue to beat until creamy, about 3 minutes. Add the eggs one at a time, beating for 1 minute after each addition and scraping down the bowl as needed. Beat in the vanilla.",
      "Reduce the mixer to low speed and add 1/2 of the dry ingredients, mixing until they've only just disappeared into the batter. Mix in the milk, then the rest of the dry ingredients.",
      "Divide the batter in half (you'll want to use a kitchen scale if you're aiming for even layers). Spoon half of the batter over the cake pan with the cranberry layer and smooth the top with a rubber spatula. Set the pan on a baking sheet, then butter and flour the other cake pan. Spoon the remaining batter into this cake pan, and again, smooth the top, then set the pan on a baking sheet. Put both cake pans in the oven for 40 minutes, rotating them at 20 minutes. When the cakes are golden brown and a knife inserted into the centers come out clean, they're ready to be removed from the oven (this could take up to 45 minutes, maybe more).",
      "When the cakes come out of the oven, use a blunt knife to loosen the sides. Cool the upside down cake in the pan for 10 minutes on the rack. Run your knife around it again. Invert the cake onto a flat platter or cutting board and let it sit with the pan holding it in place for another 10 minutes. Meanwhile, invert the plain cake onto a wire rack and let it cool. Remove the hot pan from the inverted cake and allow it to come to room temperature. Before assembling the cake, put the upside down layer in the refrigerator until it's thoroughly chilled.\r\n\r\nSpread the cran-raspberry jam on the plain layer, then carefully lift the cranberry cake (it works well to use two big spatulas) and place it on top, cranberry side up.",
      "To make the ginger whipped cream, whip the chilled cream, the confectioners' sugar, and the ground ginger until you get soft peaks. Taste for the ginger, whipping in more as you like."

Before grilling, strain the eggplant from the brine (discarding the brine) and gently pat dry with paper towels, leaving any feta bits on the eggplant. Toss with enough olive oil to generously coat both sides. (Tip: use the same bowl you used for brining for coating your eggplant in olive oil, and then again when removing the eggplant from the grill. Any leftover feta bits in the bowl can be added to the salad, and you'll save yourself some dirty dishes!)",

Grill the eggplant on the first side until nicely charred (lift up a piece or two to check), then flip and continue grilling until tender and nicely charred. (Back down the heat if the eggplant is browning too much before it cooks through.) Remember, char equals flavor so don't hesitate to get some color on the eggplant!",

Drizzle the preserved lemon salsa verde over the salad (serving extra at the table). Serve slightly warm or at room temperature.",

(It's important to cover the herbs with the olive oil before processing so they don't discolor.) Pulse several more times until well mixed, but leave some texture in the herbs. Stir in the preserved lemon rind and season to taste with lemon juice, chile flakes, and kosher salt."

      "There are a few things to know before you begin:\r\n*You will need a cast-iron dutch oven. Do not purchase an enameled one; they are not heat resistant at the high temperature required to bake this bread. We use a 5-qt. dutch oven made by Lodge.\r\n*Baking bread is a two day process. You do not need to knead this dough, but you do need to let it sit overnight. We mix the dough on Saturday afternoon, and bake it on Sunday.\r\n*Use standard, unbleached bread flour.\r\n *Use bread machine yeast that comes in a glass jar, and store your yeast in the refrigerator.\r\n*Weigh your flour, don't measure it.\r\n*Acquire plastic chopping mats, pastry mats or even plastic place mats to let your loaves rise on.\r\n*Consider making a few loaves at a time. Whatever you do not eat that same day you can slice and freeze, and pull out as needed throughout the week. Freezing is a better solution to storing in paper bags. Never store this bread in plastic bags.",
      "Place the salt and the yeast into a medium-sized glass or ceramic bowl. Add the warm water, and stir until the yeast and the salt are dissolved and the water is cloudy. Measure the flour and add it to the water. With a wooden spoon, stir the flour into the water until just mixed. The dough will come together and form a ball. Don't over-stir - the consistency will be unequal with some parts more dense and other parts stickier.",
      "Cover the bowl with plastic wrap, creating a tight, airproof seal. Let sit overnight for 12-18 hours. When you return to your dough the next day, you will see that it has risen and become a light, wet, sticky dough with air bubbles covering its surface.",
      "The next phase of the process involves shaping your dough into loaves, and letting them rise Lay a plastic chopping mat or pastry mat down on a work surface in a part of the kitchen where the temperature is even - not too close to the oven, and away from drafts. Sprinkle flour over the surface of the mat. Remove the plastic wrap from the bowl of dough, and set aside to be used again later. Using your fingers, pull the dough out of the bowl and onto the mat. Let it rest there for 15 minutes.",
      "Using the extra flour on the mat to keep the dough from sticking to your hands, lift the dough and carefully work it into a round loaf shape by pulling the ends around and working them together on the underneath side. Move quickly and efficiently so as not to overwork the dough. With the dough in one hand, remove the excess flour from the mat using the other hand, and then gently set the loaf back down onto the mat. Retrieve the plastic wrap that previously covered the bowl, and place loosely over the dough, dry-side down. Let the dough rise for 2-3 more hours.",
      "30 minutes before baking the bread, place the dutch oven into your oven, and preheat it to 475\u00b0 F. You want your dutch oven to be scorching hot when you place your dough into it.",
      "When your dough is ready and your oven has reached 475\u00b0 F, remove the dutch oven, and take its lid off. Working quickly so that your dutch oven and your oven do not cool down too much, lift the entire plastic mat with the dough on it, and carefully turn the dough over into the dutch oven. Replace the lid and using pot holders, give the dutch oven a shake or two while on your countertop in so that the dough inside settles into the center of the dutch oven.",
      "Return the dutch oven to the oven, and bake for 30 minutes. After 30 minutes, remove the lid of the dutch oven and check the color of the bread. If it is still pale yellow, return the dutch oven to the oven uncovered for up to 5 more minutes, until the crust achieves a deep golden-brown color.",
      "Remove the dutch oven from the oven, and turn the bread out onto the counter top immediately. Let cool on a baking rack so that the heat can escape from underneath. When no longer piping hot, slice and enjoy.",

Process until the nuts are finely ground. The sugar helps prevent the nuts from turning into butter, but still be careful not to over-process. Add the rest of the sugar and pulse a few times to combine. Add the egg white and and continue to process until the mixture turns into a ball, which only took a few seconds for me. If it's sticky, add more powdered sugar, a little at a time.\r\n\r\nUse at once or wrap in plastic wrap and store in the refrigerator for up to 3 months.

The mixture should froth and foam slightly. You can stir it gently to make sure all the yeast has been moistened, but if the yeast does not foam, dump it out and start over. Once the yeast has been activated, stir 1/2 cup of the flour in to the milk mixture. Once combined, add the remaining sugar, 1 egg, and salt, and stir to combine. On low speed, add the remainder of the flour and beat to combine, scraping the sides of the bowl as needed. Once evenly combined, increase the speed to medium (I use speed number 4 on my Kitchen Aid stand mixer) and add the softened butter 1 tablespoon at a time. Scrape the sides of the bowl and then continue to beat on medium speed for an additional 4 minutes. The dough will be quite moist and sticky.",

Allow the dough to rest in a warm spot in the kitchen until it has approximately doubled in size, about 1-1/2-2 hours.\r\nOnce the bread has nearly risen, melt the chocolate, butter, and cocoa in a saucepan over low heat. Once smooth, stir in the powdered sugar until well combined. Set aside until the dough is ready. If it firms up beyond a spreadable consistency, gently melt it again.",

Spread the chocolate filling evenly over the rectangle, leaving a 1\" border around the perimeter of the dough. Sprinkle evenly with the peppermint bark bits.\r\nStarting with one of the long ends, roll the dough somewhat tightly into one long tube and pinch the ends of the dough to seal in the filling. Use a sharp knife to slice down the middle of the length of the dough, leaving one inch at the top uncut. You should end with two strands of rolled dough connected by a 1\" chunk of dough at the top. This will serve as the starting point for your braid, so you want the dough to remain connected here. Turn the exposed innards of the dough roll to face upwards and then twist the dough, right over left, right over left, until the entire length of dough has been twisted into one long piece. Join the ends of the dough to make a ring, pinching the ends together slightly. Carefully transfer the ring of dough into a lightly greased 10\" cast-iron skillet. Cover the skillet with a piece of plastic wrap and allow the dough to rest while you preheat the oven to 350 degrees.",

Bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until the dough is puffed and golden brown throughout. Allow to cool slightly prior to cutting and serving.

Mint will quickly develop blemishes from hitting, cutting, bruising in exactly the same way that basil or shiso leaves will, so prepare a bowl of cold water. Begin pulling mint leaves off, the little one go directly into the water. The medium sized leaves are ripped in half, and the largest leaves just rip into thirds. Quickly put into the cold water. Don't use any stems. \r\n(You can cut with a knife but it seemed to take more time, switching from pulling to cutting. Use a stainless steel or ceramic knife) Put mint in measuring cup, and if its not enough, return prepared mint to the cold water bowl, then continue ripping more mint. Drain right before mixing into the batter (Salad spinner works great).",

Once your icing is mixed, scoop it onto a sheet of plastic wrap, spreading it out into a log (as you might do for cookie dough you are freezing). Wrap the plastic wrap around, pushing out the air and then twisting the ends. At this point you can keep the icing in the refrigerator until you are ready to use. \r\n\r\nWhen ready to decorate, simply cut off one of the ends and put the whole log (including the plastic wrap) with the cut side down into a decorating bag already set with your decorating tip. That's it! Now you can work as you please without having to scoop it into the bag, trying not to get it everywhere, and trying to balance it with one hand, while trying to make sure you get all the icing out of the bowl. The icing comes right out without any air pockets! Genius!"

Lay down three slices of Gruyere cheese on top of the mustard, then top each with four slices of the black forest ham. Let them continue cooking on the skillet, lifting to peak every couple of minutes, until the have reached that golden brown color, and have a crunchy exterior.\r\n\r\nNow for the assembly.\r\n\r\nGet your broiler going on 475 degrees.",

Crack the eggs, leaving the yolks whole, and continue cooking in the skillet until the whites around the yolk are cooked through, sunny side up style.\r\n\r\nRemove the sandwiches from the broiler, and place on a serving plate.

You get the perfect sharpness from the cheese and mustard, along with the creaminess of the egg and bechamel sauce, then on top of that, you get the tender ham. Wow.

Stir the onions and add a half-cup of wine and deglaze the pan, scraping up all the burnt and browned bits.

The onions should now be a rich, dark brown color; they should smell divine.",

In the bowl of a food processor, pulse together the flour, brown sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Add the butter and pulse until the bits of butter are about the size of peas.

Make a well in the center of the flour mixture and pour in the buttermilk mixture. Use a rubber spatula or your hands to mix enough to begin moistening the flour mixture, then knead gently just until the mixture forms a homogeneous dough. Take care not to overwork the dough.",
      "Divide the dough evenly among the prepared pans (about 525g per pan). Press into an even layer-if the dough is sticky and hard to handle, lightly moisten your hands with water. Sprinkle each layer evenly with about a tablespoon of turbinado sugar. If the dough has warmed up by this point and is getting sticky or melty, pop it back in the fridge until it's firm and cold, about 20 minutes or so.",
      "Bake until the biscuits are golden brown on the surface and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 28 to 32 minutes, rotating the pans midway if they look like they're baking unevenly. Cool the biscuits in the pans for 20 minutes, then turn out onto wire racks to cool completely.",

      "Meanwhile, make the whipped cream: In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment (or a large bowl, using a hand mixer), whip the cream cheese and powdered sugar until light and fluffy, 2 to 3 minutes. With the mixer running on low speed, add the cream in a slow, steady stream, then whip on medium speed until medium peaks form. Add the vanilla and mix on low speed to combine.",
      "Assemble the cake: Place one biscuit layer on a cake stand or platter. Top it with 1 1/2 cups of the whipped cream, spreading it evenly, followed by one third of the strawberries. Repeat with the remaining biscuit layers, cream, and strawberries. Drizzle the juices from the strawberry bowl over the finished cake, or drizzle a little on each wedge when serving.",
      "Pro tip: If you don't have three cake pans, just divide your dough into 3 pieces and press into roughly 9-inch disks. Chill the dough until firm to minimize spreading, about 15 minutes in the freezer or 20 to 30 in the refrigerator. The dough can be refrigerated until you're ready to bake (up to 6 hours), so you can bake the layers in batches if needed.",
      "Make-ahead notes: The components of this recipe can all be made ahead and stored for up to 1 day (though the biscuits are most delicious on the day they're baked)-biscuits wrapped tightly in plastic wrap, at room temperature, and the strawberries and cream refrigerated in separate airtight containers. Once assembled, the cake should be kept refrigerated and served within 1 day."

      "If caramelizing the onions, heat 2 tablespoons of butter in a large saucepan or high-sided skillet until sizzling. Add onions, 1 teaspoon of salt (and optional brown sugar, if using) and cook, stirring frequently, until translucent. Reduce heat to medium-low and keep cooking, stirring very frequently, for 25-45 minutes depending on how deeply caramelized you prefer your onions. To prevent sticking, and to aid the caramelization process, you may add a splash of water as needed (recommended at least twice during process). Depending on your stove, you may need to adjust the temperature slightly up or down. You will need to pay attention to prevent burning. I like my onions to cook down until quite \"jammy\" (about 45 minutes) but this is optional. When onions are browned/caramelized to your liking, add soy sauce, balsamic vinegar, and freshly ground pepper and stir till absorbed. Remove from heat.",
      "Chop tomatoes into bite size chunks. For medium tomatoes, chopping into quarters is enough but large tomatoes may need to be cut into 6 or 8 equal-sized pieces. I leave cherry tomatoes whole. I do not remove seeds or skins.",
      "In a large bowl, sprinkle chopped tomatoes with 2 tablespoons of cornstarch, 1 to 2 teaspoons of salt, pepper, cumin, cayenne and paprika. Stir lightly to combine ingredients.",
      "Layer caramelized (or sauteed) onions on bottom of a deep-dish 9\" glass pie pan or an 8\" square pan. Arrange tomatoes evenly on top of onions. Tomatoes will cook down so you don't need to arrange it 'prettily'. Don't overfill pie pan as tomatoes will release lots of juices as they roast. Place in oven and roast for 30-35 minutes or until filling is hot and bubbling around the edges and the tomatoes are *very slightly* caramelized or browning on top. When ready, remove from oven and gently stir in freshly chopped basil before arranging biscuit dough on top.",
      "While tomatoes are roasting in the oven, you can prep the dry biscuit ingredients. Whisk flour, cornmeal, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in large bowl to combine. I like to add a few twists of ground pepper too (optional).",
      "Whisk melted and slightly-cooled butter & buttermilk in small bowl. ONE MINUTE before tomatoes come out of the oven, add these wet ingredients to dry ingredients. Stir with rubber spatula until just combined and no dry pockets remain. Don't over-mix. Sometimes I need to add a splash more buttermilk if too dry.",
      "To assemble and bake cobbler: Pinch off biscuit dough into 8 equal-sized pieces and place on hot tomato-onion filling, spacing them at least 1/2 inch apart (they should not touch). Bake until filling is bubbling and biscuits are golden brown on top and cooked through, 20-22 minutes. Cool cobbler on wire rack 10 minutes and serve."

      "Brown the butter: Add the butter to a large skillet and set on the stove over medium heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until it turns a chestnutty brown. It will sputter a lot at first, then foam, then you'll start seeing these bits on the bottom going from golden to brown to mahogany. Just before it burns, turn off the heat, and pour the brown butter into a heatproof bowl (preferably one that's large enough to mix the rest of the cookie dough). Immediately add 2 tablespoons water to the emptied, off-the-heat pan (be careful, it may spatter a bit). Use a wooden spoon to scrape up any remaining buttery bits, then add that liquid to the brown butter in the bowl.",
      "Refrigerate or freeze the brown butter until solid but softish, like you would normally use for chocolate chip cookies.",
      "Meanwhile, toast the pecans. Heat the oven to 350\u00b0F. Line a sheet pan with parchment or a silicone mat. Add the pecans and bake for about 8 to 10 minutes, or until fragrant and deeply browned. Cool completely.",
      "When the pecans are totally cool, add them to a food processor. Pulse until they're very finely ground, scraping down the food processor as needed. Watch these closely! Because pecans are so rich and fatty, they go from finely ground to pecan butter in the blink of an eye. They skip that floury stage that you'd get with almonds.",
      "If the chilled butter isn't already in a large bowl, transfer it to one. Add the confectioners' sugar (preferably through a fine-mesh sieve to remove any lumps, but no big deal if you don't have one). Use a spoon or rubber spatula to combine until totally smooth. Add the salt and stir. Add the ground pecans and stir. Add the flour and stir until a cohesive dough forms.",
      "If the dough is wet and/or soft, refrigerate for a bit until it's firm enough for you to scoop and roll into balls. If the oven isn't still at 350\u00b0F, bring it back. Line 2 sheet pans with parchment paper or silicone mats.",
      "Scoop the dough into heaping tablespoons and roll each into a ball. You should get about 32. Add these to the lined sheet pans, evenly spaced out with a couple of inches between each-they won't spread too much. Bake for about 16 minutes, until deeply golden brown. Repeat in batches if needed.",
      "Let the cookies cool for at least 10 minutes on the tray, until they're sturdy enough to transfer to a cooling rack. There, cool completely.",
      "When the cookies are cool, dredge them in powdered sugar: Dump about 2 cups of powdered sugar on a rimmed plate or in a bowl. Roll around each cookie until completely coated."
