      "Heat a small omelet pan over medium heat for 5 minutes.",
      "Turn on the broiler in your oven. (Mine has a high/low setting, so I use low.).",
      "Crack the eggs into a 4 cup measuring cup. Add the milk, seasoned salt and pepper and beat the mixture completely with a fork or whisk. Set aside.",
      "Add 1/2-1 tbsp butter to the omelet pan and add anywhere from 1/2 tsp to 1 tbsp of any the vegetables first, depending on what is ordered. Using a spatula, saute the requested ingredients for a minute or two until the vegetables are crisp tender. Then add any meats/seafood and saute for one more minute.",
      "Spread the mixture around the pan evenly. Then give the egg mixture a quick whisk and SLOWLY pour 1/4 of the mixture in and around the ingredients.",
      "As the eggs cook, use your spatula to push the eggs toward the center of the pan and tilt the pan so the uncooked eggs fill the gaps. Keep your pan on a medium-low setting.",
      "When there is no more liquid egg to fill the gaps, turn off the burner, place the pan in the oven under the broiler for a couple of minutes. Leave the door propped open a bit so you can watch the omelet. Don't take your eyes off of it - it could burn very quickly. The broiler will cook the top of your eggs. (I'm not a good omelet flipper, especially with all those yummy, but heavy goodies in them, so this method works well for me.)",
      "Using a hotpad to grab the handle, put the pan back on the stove, making sure the burner you previously used is turned off. If desired, sprinkle the cheese(s) on one side of the omelet and fold the other side over on top of the cheesy side, slide the omelet onto a plate and serve. The heat from the omelet will melt the cheese without overcooking the omelet.",
      "Enjoy!"

Perfect! Three chores done in one (oven clean, racks clean and bathtub clean). Once you find out how easy it is to clean those nasty racks you will never have to scour, scrape, get steel fibers from SOS pads in your fingers or buy expensive cleaners that DON'T work again! LOL!"

It is important that the saucepan be deep because brown sugar syrup tends to boil up higher than white sugar, and you don't want to have to deal with a syrup spill, trust me! \tSet over medium heat, stirring occasionally. Use a pastry brush dipped in water to melt the sugar crystals that form on the sides of the pan. When the syrup begins to boil, reduce the heat to low and insert a candy thermometer into the syrup.

Remove the saucepan from the heat and slowly pour the hot syrup down the side of the bowl into the egg whites, being very careful to avoid allowing the stream to hit the whisk and spatter. Pour slowly and steadily until all the syrup has been added, and continue beating the meringue until it becomes light and fluffy and holds its shape exactly when the beater is removed, roughly 3-5 minutes.",

Once the butter is added, increase the speed to medium and beat the buttercream until it becomes light and fluffy. It may look soupy or curdled shortly after all the butter is added-this is okay! Just keep on beating it and it will whip up into a light, fluffy cloud.",
      "Add the vanilla additional grounds, if using, and beat on low speed until incorporated. Use straight away or keep in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks in an airtight container, bringing to room temperature and beating until smooth to use.",

A green salad is always welcomed as it adds a refreshing note.",

Heat half of the olive oil in a saucepan, pat the rabbit pieces dry and fry them in it until they are quite brown on both sides. Take out and put on to a plate. When all the rabbit pieces have been fried, put them back into the saucepan along with the garlic cloves, bay leaves, spices, rosemary and the wine. Then add the tomato puree or tomatoes, sugar and the hot water. Season, cover and cook for about 1 hour. In the meantime, heat the remaining olive oil in a frying pan and gently fry the onions. Stir them occasionally, in order to make sure they turn golden all over, for about 15 minutes. Add the contents of the frying pan to the saucepan, and shake it so that the onions spread evenly. Then cover and simmer for a further 15 minutes. Serve with fried potatoes or plain white rice and a green salad."

      "UPDATE: I thought they needed to be a little sweeter and wanted the coconut more on top and not in the bars. I made them again and OMG I want to eat the whole pan! This is what I did different. Instead of 1/2 cup lemon juice, I used 1/4 cup lemon juice and 1/4 cup orange juice. I also cooked it with the filling for about 10 minutes, then added the coconut and cooked for about 10-12 minutes more. The coconut went in the batter but also stayed on top some and got a little toasted. These were sooooooo good, I will be making them again and again with the modifications.",
      "However, if it was a little too sweet so I might reduce the amount of sugar I put inches Otherwise, it was yummy. The picture looks a lot different than the way it turned out. Next time I will probably sprinkle the coconut on it as soon as I take it out of the oven while it is out. Sprinkling it on the raw batter makes it sink into it and it doesn't show up on top as in the pic. It gives it a marbly look. I used maybe 1/4 cup of shredded coconut because I didn't want to overpower the taste of the lemon with that of coconut. Using 3/4 cup as suggested would have made it even sweeter than it already was for me.",
      "I use lemon zest. I also put them in a slightly smaller pan than the 13x9 for a higher bar and cook 10 minutes more. A light refreshing taste of lemon evened out by the not too sweet wonderful shortbread crust. These also travel well. I cut them into small squares and used parchment paper between the layers in a lidded container. They made a two hour trip in a cooler and transferred beautifully to a serving dish. Have been making these lemon bars for a few years now. I love this recipe. It is easy to prepare and serves up a refreshing \"hit\" of lemon flavor. Do Added a little bit of lemon zest to the filling to up the lemon flavour."

When the oil is smoking, add the pork and beef mixture in batches to the hot pan and cook until the meat is seared on all sides. Remove the seared meat to a paper towel lined sheet tray, leaving behind any rendered fat in the pan, and continue to sear the remaining meat in batches, ensuring that you do not overcrowd the pan and steam the meat. Set the seared meat aside.",
      "In the same pan, over medium heat, add the onion and cook 5 minutes or until beginning to caramelize. Then add in the carrots, celery, 1 teaspoon kosher salt, garlic, parsley, sage and 1/4 cup basil. Cook for 5-6 minutes or until the vegetables are soft and just beginning to caramelize. Add the meat back to the pan along with the crushed tomatoes and beef broth. Bring the mixture to a boil and reduce to a simmer, stirring occasionally. Season with additional kosher salt to taste and crushed red pepper flakes. Continue to simmer for at least 1 hour or until the sauce has thickened. You can continue to cook the sauce for longer, if you have time; the longer you cook the sauce the deeper the flavor. While the sauce simmers roast the spaghetti squash.",

      "Cut the squash in half lengthwise and discard the seeds. Season each squash half with 1 tablespoon olive oil, 1 teaspoon kosher salt and 1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper. Add two large basil leaves to the cavity of each squash and then turn the squash cavity side down on a half sheet tray. You will need two half sheet trays to hold all six halves. Roast the squash for 40 minutes or until the squash is fork tender and easily shreds when you run a fork over the flesh. Remove from oven and let cool 10-15 minutes.",

Spread the squash evenly on the sheet tray and shred it lightly with a fork so it looks like spaghetti. Place the sheet trays back in the oven and cook an additional 15 minutes or until the excess liquid has evaporated and the squash has just begun to crisp and lightly brown.

      "Divide your dough ball in half, then divide each half into halves. Do you see where this is going? Now, take your four quarters and half each of them. You should now have 8 little dough balls.",
      "Flatten each of your 8 dough balls into thick disks, and wrap them with plastic wrap, or \"Cling film\" as my friend likes to say. Let these guys chill out in your fridge for at least an hour. The longer, the better! (Note: You could stop here if you wanted to, and continue another day or such.).",
      "When you're ready to continue, or after at least 1 hour, preheat your oven to 350\u00b0F Lightly grease (Or parchment) two baking sheets (Three is even better!). Use parchment! It's better. These cookies will ooze as they cook, and with parchment there's much less cleanup.",
      "Now let's move on to the filling. If you have a food processor, you can add all the filling ingredients except for the apricot jelly (Your raisins, sugar, butter, cinnamon, almonds, and salt) and pulse a few times. If you're like me you don't have a food processor, so finely dice your Raisins and Almonds (There's a lullaby called that, did you know that?). Then add your sugar, butter, cinnamon and salt and mix well.",
      "Shaping the cookies: Work with only one dough disk at a time, and keep the others refrigerated while you do this. Here's where your team of helpers, if you have any, will come in handy. On a piece of parchment or a lightly floured work surface, roll the dough into an 8 inch circle. Take the top off of your apricot jam and place it (Or a the lid to a salad dressing bottle, or something similar) smack in the middle of your dough circle.",
      "Spread a thin layer of the apricot jam into the dough circle, making sure to leave about a 1/2 inch uncovered border on the outside. Then, sprinkle 1/4 cup of your filling over the dough, again staying within your 1/2 inch boundaries (And that lid in the center!).",
      "Carefully remove the lid, and use a sharp knife or a pizza wheel to cut your circle into 8 equal wedges.",
      "Starting at the wide (Outside) Edge of each wedge, roll it toward its narrow edge, just like you would on a crescent roll. Place these rolled wedges, tips down (Filling up!) onto one prepared baking sheet, then carefully bend the tips into a crescent shape. Remember the crescent roll.",
      "Now for the topping. Crack your egg into a small bowl and add about 1 tsp of water. Brush this egg wash onto your rugelach, and top them with that granulated or coarse sugar. Bake them for 20 minutes. Set your timer. Once they're done, carefully remove them from the oven and remove from the baking sheet(s), setting them on a wire rack to cool.",
      "While one batch is cooking, repeat the same steps with the remaining dough disks. If you have a team of helpers, you can get an assembly line going so you never have to stop! It makes it all the easier, also.",
