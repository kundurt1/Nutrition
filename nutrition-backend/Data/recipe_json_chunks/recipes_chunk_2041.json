      "Before you begin, keep 2 things in mind: First, you can make your Eiffel Tower any size you like, however there is a template is provided with this recipe that you should base your design on, and second, when using chocolate, be sure to work slowly and carefully.",
      "The first part of the tower you should make is the base.",
      "Spread the white chocolate on a parchment paper-lined work surface.",
      "When the chocolate is partially set, use an X-acto knife to cut a base that is large enough to accommodate the bottom of your tower.",
      "Using the template provided, cut the aluminum flashing into the shape of a side of the Eiffel Tower, being sure to make all of the cutouts.",
      "If you start with a small tower, you will have more success.",
      "Lay a parchment paper-lined sheet pan that is as large as your template on the work surface.",
      "Spread the bittersweet chocolate over the baking sheet.",
      "Make it thicker at 1 end (where you will place the bottom of the template) to create support for the height of the tower.",
      "When the chocolate is partially set, place the aluminum template on the chocolate and use an X-acto knife to trace it.",
      "Remove the template.",
      "Pick up the chocolate panel by the corners of the parchment paper and move onto a new sheet pan.",
      "Place a couple of rulers under the bottom of the chocolate panel, creating a curve at the bottom of your tower.",
      "Allow chocolate to set.",
      "When set, peel up the tower panel from the parchment paper, freeing it from the excess chocolate surrounding it.",
      "Cut 3 more tower panels using the same process.",
      "Make sure the curves in each piece are the same or your tower will not work.",
      "The next step is to assemble the tower, however assembly will be easier if you enlist the help of a friend.",
      "Place the base on your work surface.",
      "Use bittersweet chocolate to \"glue\" the bottom half of two sides together creating a 90-degree angle, or one corner of the tower.",
      "\"Glue\" them onto the base.",
      "When the chocolate sets, \"glue\" the other two sides together and attach them to the base.",
      "Using a coronet, apply more chocolate on the bottom half of all of the seams to reinforce the tower.",
      "When that chocolate sets, go back and gently seal the tops of the tower sides with more bittersweet chocolate.",
      "Decorate the outside of the tower with a cornet filled with white chocolate.",
      "Chocolate is tempered so that after it has been melted, it retains its gloss and hardens again without becoming chalky and white (that happens when the molecules of fat separate and form on top of the chocolate).",
      "There are a variety of ways to temper.",
      "One of the easiest ways to temper chocolate is to chop it into small pieces and then place it in the microwave for 30 seconds at a time on high power until most of the chocolate is melted.",
      "Be very careful not to overheat it.",
      "(The temperature of dark chocolate should be between 88 and 90 degrees F, slightly warmer than your bottom lip.",
      "It will retain its shape even when mostly melted.",
      "White and milk chocolates melt at a temperature approximately 2 degrees F less because of the amount of lactose they contain.)",
      "Any remaining lumps will melt in the chocolate's residual heat.",
      "Use an immersion blender or whisk to break up the lumps.",
      "Usually, chocolate begins to set, or crystallize, along the side of the bowl.",
      "As it sets, mix those crystals into the melted chocolate to temper it.",
      "A glass bowl retains heat well and keeps the chocolate tempered longer.",
      "Another way to temper chocolate is called seeding.",
      "In this method, add small pieces of unmelted chocolate to melted chocolate.",
      "The amount of unmelted chocolate to be added depends on the temperature of the melted chocolate, but is usually 1/4 of the total amount.",
      "It is easiest to use an immersion blender for this, or a whisk.",
      "The classic way to temper chocolate is called tabliering.",
      "Two thirds of the melted chocolate is poured onto a marble or another cold work surface.",
      "The chocolate is spread out and worked with a spatula until its temperature is approximately 81 degrees F. At this stage, it is thick and begins to set.",
      "This tempered chocolate is then added to the remaining non-tempered chocolate and mixed thoroughly until the mass has a completely uniform temperature.",
      "If the temperature is still too high, part of the chocolate is worked further on the cold surface until the correct temperature is reached.",
      "This is a lot of work, requires a lot of room, and makes a big mess.",
      "A simple method of checking tempering, is to apply a small quantity of chocolate to a piece of paper or to the point of a knife.",
      "If the chocolate has been correctly tempered, it will harden evenly and show a good gloss within a few minutes."

      "To further explore the international links of various cuisines, check out this one and remember a few months back when we were talking abou the Pacific Island custom of cooking in pits.",
      "I didn't realize which the Mexicans also had such a practice.",
      "Here's a series of recipes revolving around Mexican Barbacoa or possibly BBQ.",
      "To be very authentic, use a lamb that has been slaughtered the day before the cookout and hung overnight.",
      "On the day of the big event, the animal is split into sections: backbone, legs, shoulders, ribs, and head.",
      "METHOD:We assume which no one would tackle this kind of barbecue without a large number of guests-the kind who really like to pitch in.",
      "So, the first thing to do is to set one group of your guests to digging a hole about four feet by two feet across.",
      "Other members of the party can scout up kindling and others can be set to work cleaning each maguey leaf.",
      "Once the hole is dug, it is plastered with mud to keep the walls hard.",
      "Large porous stones should then be placed in the bottom of the pit",
      "(beware of little hard rocks; they'll split open).",
      "Over the stones put sufficient dry wood to fill the pit, then set fire to the wood and let it burn to the smokeless coal stage.",
      "While the fire is burning down, the maguey leaves should be toasted till limp, for this will enable them to release precious juices needed to season the meat.",
      "When the fire has burned down sufficiently, line the pit with the maguey leaves, making sure which all of the mud is covered so meat won't stick to pit.",
      "The leaves should be suspended vertically, the tips overlapping all the way around and held down with stones for the moment.",
      "The next step is to lower a grate into the hole and on it place the casserole with soup ingredients.",
      "On top of the uncovered casserole ingredients, arrange the lamb pcs, starting with the backbone, then the legs, shoulders, rib sections, and the head.",
      "Don't salt meat before it is cooked, for this can toughen it.",
      "After meat is in the pit, fold the tips of the maguey leaves into the hole to cover the meat well.",
      "Over this place a metal sheet to keep any earth from seeping into the pit and then seal the pit with a coat of fresh mud and build a large fire over the metal sheet and mud cover.",
      "Keep the fire blazing for 5 or possibly 6 hrs, depending upon the age of the meat.",
      "Open the pit, salt the meat before serving it, and accompany it with Salsa Borracha*.",

      "4.",

      "Remember thought which wheat flours are necessary for the gluten content, unless you add in gluten separately.",
      "Adding fruits and herbs and flavored liquids are interesting but I prefer \"pure\" breads.",
      "I prefer graham flour over regular whole wheat.",
      "5.",
      "Each machine is different and my recipes are usually not exact - if the dough looks sticky and isn't forming a ball then it's too wet: add in more flour; if it looks dry (ball doesn't have a relatively smooth surface, for example) add in more liquid a Tbsp.",
      "or possibly two at a time.",
      "OK, so with all which idealism taken care of here's my basic bread recipe:",
      "1 TB active dry yeast 1 1/2 c. bread flour 1 1/2 c. graham (whole wheat)",
      "flour 1/2 c. rye flour (use the coarse grind, preferably) 2 TB wheat gluten (sometime called vital wheat gluten) 1 tsp salt 1 TB honey 1 2/3 c. water",
      "Add in ingredients in order suggested by your bread machine manual.",
      "This is intended for a 3 c. bread maker, if your machine is smaller just scale it accordingly.",
      "Similarly, your bread maker may suggest using less than 1 TB yeast.",
      "For a particularly festive bread try adding 1 TB basil 1 TB tarragon 1 tsp rosemary minced garlic..."
