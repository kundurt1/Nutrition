Spoon about one-quarter of the beaten whites into the chocolate mixture and whisk until blended. Add the remaining whites and gently fold them in until just blended. Pour evenly into prepared ramekins (the mixture will almost completely fill the ramekins). If you want to bake the souffles within 24 hours, refrigerate them.

Remove the souffles from the oven and serve immediately.",

To bake straight from the freezer, unwrap the ramekins and set on a small baking sheet or jellyroll pan. Let them sit for 20 minute while heating the oven to 400\u00b0F Bake on the baking sheet until puffed and risen about 1 inch above the ramekin, 18 minute Remove from the oven and serve immediately."

Cover loosely with plastic wrap and let rise at room temperature until dough has doubled in size and does not readily spring back when poked with finger, about 2 hours.",

Lightly flour top of dough and, using razor blade or sharp knife, make one 6-inch-long, 1/2-inch-deep slit along top of dough. Carefully remove pot from oven and remove lid. Pick up dough by lifting parchment overhang and lower into pot (let any excess parchment hang over pot edge). Cover pot and place in oven. Reduce oven temperature to 425 degrees and bake covered for 30 minutes. Remove lid and continue to bake until loaf is deep brown and instant-read thermometer inserted into center registers 210 degrees, 20 to 30 minutes longer. Carefully remove bread from pot; transfer to wire rack and cool to room temperature, about 2 hours.",
      "Note: See the related information in \"High-Heat Baking in a Dutch Oven\" for information on converting Dutch oven handles to work safely in a hot oven. How can I keep my Dutch oven safe when baking in a really hot oven? Our recipe for Almost No-Knead Bread calls for preheating a Dutch oven to 500 degrees. After publishing our recipe, it was called to our attention that the manufacturers of both our favorite Dutch oven (the 7 1/4-Quart Round French by Le Creuset) and our best buy Dutch oven (the 6.5 Quart Cast Iron Dutch Oven by Tramontina) recommend against heating the pots to this temperature, due to the phenolic knobs used on the lids. And we subsequently learned that in certain instances, the pot itself might crack.",
      "SOLVING THE KNOB PROBLEM: Fortunately, there are two easy solutions. The knobs on both lids are secured with a single screw that is very easily removed. Once the knob is removed you can replace it with an inexpensive all-metal drawer handle purchased from a hardware store. Alternatively, Le Creuset has introduced a stainless steel replacement knob for its Dutch ovens (which also fits perfectly on the Lodge enameled Dutch oven and the Chefmate Dutch oven), available for around $10, which is completely oven-safe. To fit this knob on the Tramontina Dutch oven, you'll need to use a single 3/8-inch-diameter, 3/4-inch-long machine screw-the 1/2-inch screw that comes with the knob is not long enough to fit through the thicker lid of the Tramontina.",
      "DEALING WITH THE CRACKING ISSUE: The enamel coating on cast-iron pots is made of vitrified glass. Although this material is built to withstand years of cooking, it can crack if the pot is dropped, the enamel has been improperly applied, or thermal shock occurs. Thermal shock may occur if a cold, empty pot is placed in a hot oven; if an empty pot is heated and then filled with cold food; or if a hot pot is placed on a cold surface. According to Le Creuset and Lodge (two of the leading manufacturers of enameled cast iron), the risk for thermal shock with our Almost No-Knead Bread recipe is low. The recipe calls for placing a cold pot in a cold oven, heating the oven to 500 degrees, and then placing room-temperature dough into the pot. Both manufacturers agree that there would be a much greater risk of thermal shock if cold food, liquid, or oil were placed in the hot pot. To prevent thermal shock when the pot is removed from the oven, place it on a wire rack or trivet or on the cooking grate of the stove.",
      "Use a mild-flavored lager, such as Budweiser (mild non-alcoholic lager also works). The bread is best eaten the day it is baked but can be wrapped in aluminum foil and stored in a cool, dry place for up to 2 days."

Take bacon and garlic up when the bacon is done - drain on paper towel. You will reserve one tablespoon or so of the grease, but dump the rest out. Add a little margarine to the bacon grease and then two tablespoons of flour (to make a paste). After the paste is made, slowly add cream while you are stirring. If you add it slowly, a little at a time, you can watch the sauce thicken and doesn't take as long over heat to thicken it. After the sauce is thickened, add a tablespoon of garlic, pepper and salt to taste. Reduce to low heat and stir frequently while you cook the 1/2 box of penne pasta (11 minutes till done). Drain pasta, put that in cream sauce. After chicken is done, chop it and mix that into the pasta and cream sauce. Mix together nicely and top with drained (chopped) bacon! Add some parmesan on top if you wish. Delicious! Serve with a salad."

You can even broil it, but I don't like the outcome as well. Cook to medium rare, for me (but cook it how you like it), and remember it will continue to cook after removing from the heat. About 5-7 minutes on the first side not quite as long on the second side (it depends on the thickness of your steak). Remove and cover with foil to let it rest.",

If you ignite it, please let it burn off a few seconds, and then add in the broth and simmer about 4 minutes until most of the liquid is absorbed. This is the perfect time as the steak is resting.",

One the other hand- if you find that after processing your tomatoes and onions that you have less than 2 cups- simply add enough bottled salsa to make up the difference.",

Reduce heat to a low simmer, cover and simmer for 2 to 3 hours, stirring occasionally (2 hours will do the trick, but I like to let it simmer for 3, so the fruit is very soft).",

Press on the fruit with the back of a large spoon to extract all the juice.If some of the pulp squeezes through the sieve and into the juice that's fine. If you get more than the 6 cups needed for this recipe you can freeze it to use later.",

      "In a preserving pan, combine the 6 cups quince juice, juice and zest of the orange and the lemon, spices, & sugar. If you don't have a preserving pan, use the widest pan you have. The wider the pan, the more quickly moisture will evaporate from the mixture, and this is what you want when making jelly or jam.",
      "Bring to a boil and continue cooking on medium-high heat for about 20 minutes, stirring gently. Check the set - it may take up to 40 minutes of simmering over medium high heat for the jelly/jam to reach the set stage - use the cold plate test to check set: take the pot of jam off the heat (if you don't remove the jam from the heat while you check the set, it could over-cook and become rubbery or hard, if the jam is indeed already set) place a drop of the jam mixture on one of the saucers you've kept in the freezer, & place the plate back in the freezer for 1 minute. After 1 minute, take the saucer out of the freezer and nudge the drop of jam with your finger. If it \"wrinkles\" when you nudge it with your finger it is done. If the jam is not set, continue cooking over medium-high heat, checking the set again every 5 minutes.",

      "In a nonstick skillet, lightly fry the chicken cubes on canola oil until ready. Careful not to overcook.",
      "Meanwhile, in a wok, add the mango chutney, and cook until it's slightly reduced, about 3min.",
      "Slowly add the onion soup mix until your desired taste.",
      "Add in the cooked chicken, and mix to coat.",
      "Serve immediately (we have it either over white rice or couscous).",
      "Variation: Use (unseasoned) chicken thighs, and bake them in the oven with the unreduced mixture of mango chutney and onion soup mix poured on top of the chicken on 375degF for 45-60min. You would need to cover for half the time, and uncover the other half until mixture is brownish and crunchy looking."
