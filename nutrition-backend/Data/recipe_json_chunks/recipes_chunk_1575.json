Simply use this trick. Frost with a light coating first, and don't worry if the darker crumbs invade your frosting. Refrigerate for 10-15 minutes after frosting the thin layer. When the cake comes out of the refrigerator, it will be much easier to frost with the remaining frosting, and your outer layer with be nice and \"clean\" looking. Refrigerate cakes (I find this cuts the sweetness a little, and also helps so the heavy cream cheese frosting stays put)."

If you're using raisins or nuts, add them with the oats. I like to use a cookie scoop to form golfball-sized balls, but you can use two spoons to scoop and place balls of dough onto un-greased, nonstick cookie sheets. If you have those silicone baking mats, use them. They totally rock! You want your dough balls to be about 2\" apart, since these will spread as they bake.",

If you like them really chewy, take them out closer to the 11-12 minute mark. If you like them crispier, leave them in up to 15 minutes, or until they turn a nice golden brown. Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheets for 10 minutes, then move to waxed paper to cool completely.",
      "Once your cookies are cooled, store them in an airtight container. If you're going to stack them in layers, I recommend you cut strips of waxed paper or parchment to place between the layers.

I used it as a walking stick and even though it was stripped of its bark, it still faintly smelled of cinnamon for months afterward.",

I could taste the difference between his cinnamon and the so-called cinnamon I had tried in the past, and this was much superior. Alas, most of the cassia is labeled 'Cinnamon,' so it is extremely difficult to tell if you're getting the real deal. No matter, this recipe works well with cassia, too. Try a splash of this in a cup of apple cider and enjoy either hot or cold!"

    "directions": [
      "Please make sure to read the entire recipe before getting started. The baked cake requires several hours of chilling and the assembled ice cream cake requires overnight freezing.",
      "For the chocolate cake:",
      "Preheat the oven to 350 F. In a small bowl, whisk together the flour, cocoa powder, baking powder and salt. Set aside. In a separate larger bowl, whisk together the eggs and sugar until well-combined. Whisk in the oil, vanilla, and mashed bananas. Whisk in the milk.",
      "Fold the dry ingredients into the wet until just combined. Pour the batter into a greased 9-inch springform cake pan. Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Remove from oven.",
      "Let the cake cool completely, then refrigerate for several hours, or overnight.",
      "The next day, remove the cake from the mold and cut the cake into three even horizontal layers. Re-assemble the springform pan. Line the sides with plastic wrap or wax paper for easy removal of the cake so you don't have to saw the edges of the cakes later on.",
      "Place the top layer (the domed one) of the cake on the bottom of the cake pan. (You'll spread a thick layer of ice cream on top of it so that this way, the top of the cake won't be domed. Alternately, if you really want to make your layers even, cut off the dome before layering your cake.)",
      "You'll need to work quickly for this next part. Add about 4 cups of vanilla ice cream, half of the mashed banana, and half of the chocolate chips and walnuts into a mixing bowl. Mash them together with a wooden spoon. It doesn't have to be perfect. It's more important that the ice cream doesn't melt. Spread the ice cream over the layer of cake at the bottom of the springform pan. Place the pan in the freezer for about 30 minutes, so that the layer of ice cream is firm.",
      "Remove pan from the freezer. Place another cake layer on top of the ice cream. Repeat the step above with the remaining ice cream, banana, nuts, and chocolate chips and spread this on top of the second layer. Then top with the final cake layer. Freeze the cake for at least 2 hours, or overnight.",
      "Make the frosting. Whisk together the cream cheese, powdered sugar and vanilla extract in a bowl.",
      "Remove the cake from the springform pan. Spread the frosting over the cake and decorate with banana slices. If the cake starts to melt while you're frosting it, return it to the freezer for another 30 minutes.",
      "Cut the cake with a sharp knife that you've run under hot water. Serve!",
      "Notes:",
      "1. Don't use butter for the cake. It'll make the cake very hard when you freeze it.",
      "2. I'd recommend Breyers for the ice cream. It's airier than most, so it's easy to scoop, spread and slice.",
      "3. Cake adapted from a recipe for Double Chocolate Banana Bread by Smitten Kitchen."

If they have even a tiny film of butter that the dishwasher didn't catch, your meringue will not set. Also, it is very important that your eggs are room temperature (if you are short on time, put the whole eggs in a bowl of hot water for a few minutes). Also, make sure to separate them well. There cannot be even the tiniest bit of yolk in your egg whites.",
      "In a large mixing bowl, beat the egg whites on high until they are frothy. Add the cream of tartar, salt and vanilla and continue to beat until the egg whites have begun to thicken and set. Slowly add the sugar, 2 tablespoons at a time and beat well. You need to beat them until the meringue is stiff and glossy and peaks.",
      "At this time you have a couple options. You could just drop your desired size scoops of the mixture onto parchment paper lined cookie sheets (foil would work too, but do not grease the pan). I like to spoon the meringue into a large zip bag, snip off the corner, and make cute little kiss-shaped meringues, This also makes for easy cleanup. I learned that the best way to get the meringue into the bag and not on your counter is to put the bag into a large cup first, spoon it in, and then zip.",
      "Then pop them in the oven for 1.5 hours. Now turn off the oven but do not take them out. Leave them in the oven for at least 2-3 hours. This is why they are also called \"forgotten cookies\". If you take them out too early, they will be soft and chewy. Soft and chewy is great for snickerdoodles but less than awesome for meringues so don't rush them. I usually make them one day and dip them in the chocolate the next day.",
      "When they are done, it's time for the chocolate and coconut. First you're going to melt your chocolate. I used a dark 70% chocolate. The bittersweet flavor that dark chocolate has really complements the vanilla and toasted coconut. The best way to melt chocolate and not burn it is to heat up water in a small pot with a bowl placed on top (make sure the bowl doesn't touch the water). Put the chocolate in the bowl and stir until melted. It takes a bit longer than microwaving but is definitely worth it. Besides you're not going anywhere, you've got coconut to toast.",
      "Spread the coconut evenly on a cookie sheet and bake at 250 F for about 20 minutes. You want the edges of the coconut to be turning a light brown. At that point, pull it out and cool.",
      "Time to dip. I actually set up a little dipping station over parchment paper where I dipped the bottom of the meringues into the chocolate and then sprinkled the coconut on. I wouldn't recommend dipping the chocolate coated cookie into the bowl of coconut. I tried that and it not only crushed the bottom of my meringue but my coconut got all chocolaty. You've been warned. So that's basically it. Dip, sprinkle, repeat. Enjoy."

      "3. As the biscuit base cools, make the filling. In a medium sized bowl using a hand mixer, whizz together the cream cheese, eggs, sugar, vanilla extract and yogurt. Mix this for 2 minutes until it's smooth, fully incorporated (you might need to scrape down the sides of the bowl once or twice) and free of lumps. Be careful not to over-mix.",
      "4. Pour this on top of the biscuit base and smooth over evenly.",
      "5. Using a teaspoon, add a few dollops of the caramel sauce on top of the cheesecake in random spots. Then, using the tip of a knife, gently 'swish' to add some swirls.",
      "6. Pop this into the oven to cook for 25-28 minutes. If you can, I'd recommend that you line the base of the tray with foil and place it inside of a larger tray that filled with some water (the water should only go about halfway up the side of the cheesecake pan). This helps the cheesecake to cook more evenly and helps prevent cracking. If you don't have a tray large enough, just add some foil to the top of the cheesecake at the 20 minute mark.",
      "7. Once done, remove from the oven and allow to cool completely before refrigerating. You can scatter the chopped pecans over the top at this time if using them."

      "Put the mixture into a 9-inch tart pan (see note) and begin pressing down to form the crust. Don't forget to cover the sides. Bake it for about 10-12 minutes. The crust will harden. Once done, remove it from the oven, set aside and let it cool.",
      "For the ganache filling:",
      "Preheat your oven to 350 F. Put the cream into a medium-sized microwave-safe bowl. Heat it in the microwave in 30 seconds bursts, and continue until hot.

Note to self: Resist the temptation to lick the bowl and spill chocolate on your t-shirt while doing so. Keep the bowl close to the pan while pouring. That way, you will not have many air bubbles.",
      "Bake for 25 minutes. When you take it out of the oven, the chocolate mix will wobble ever so slightly. It will harden when it cools off. Set it on a rack to cool a bit. Then put it in the fridge and let it cool completely before glazing it.",

      "- This recipe is for a 9-inch tart pan. I used a tart pan with a removable bottom.",
      "- You can use bittersweet chocolate or semi-sweet chocolate or half of each. I used semi-sweet chocolate chips."

If not, just store the rest in an airtight container in the refrigerator for ice cream or pie. The cakes should be done by this point.

In a bowl whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt and allspice. Then in the bowl of your stand mixer, combine the cooled brown butter and brown sugar and beat them together with the paddle attachment until light and fluffy. Add the eggs in one at a time and then add the vanilla and let all of that get thoroughly beat in. Then slowly pour in 1/3 of the flour mixture, followed by the buttermilk. Then add in another 1/3 of the flour mixture followed by the cream soda. Then add in the last of the flour mixture and make sure it all gets well combined into a lovely batter.",

For the ganache, fill a small saucepan about halfway with water and bring it to a simmer over medium heat. Combine the butterscotch chips and heavy cream in a heat proof bowl (one that fits into the saucepan) and put the bowl over the pot of simmering water. Make sure the bowl doesn't touch the water, it should be right above it. With a heat proof spoon or rubber spatula, stir the butterscotch chips and cream until they are fully melted together into a shiny liquid ganache. Take it off the heat and set it aside.",
      "4. You need your stand mixer again for the butterscotch buttercream frosting. In the clean bowl of the mixer combine all of the frosting ingredients except the powdered sugar. Beat it thoroughly together with the paddle attachment until shiny and fluffy. Then slowly pour in the powdered sugar and let it get beat in until you have a thick, rich buttercream.",
      "5. Now it's time to assemble the cupcakes! Either using an offset spatula or piping bag frost each cupcake with the buttercream. With a spoon drizzle some of the leftover butterscotch ganache over all of frosted cupcakes. Then top each of them with a butterscotch candy.",
      "They're gorgeous in taste and appearance. I felt like I got to go back to The Three Broomsticks and have a butterbeer with Madame Rosmerta. The butterscotch and cream soda just make these cupcakes incredible. Make a batch and get transported to that wonderful wizarding world!"

      "1. Preheat the oven to 350 F and liberally spray a 24-well mini muffin pan with cooking spray. In a bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder and salt and set it aside. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine the soft butter and sugar and cream them together until light and fluffy. Add in the eggs and beat them in completely. Then slowly add in the dry ingredients until everything is combined.",
      "2. In a small bowl, stir the sugar and cinnamon together for coating. Take a heaping tablespoon of the cookie dough and roll it in the cinnamon and sugar to coat it. Then press it into the first well of the prepared muffin tin to form a cute little cup. Repeat with the rest of the cookie batter, you should get 24 little cups. Get the tray into the oven and bake the cookie cups for about 15 minutes, until golden and slightly puffy.",
      "3. When they are done, they will look like little muffins with a slight hole in the middle. Take them out of the oven and insert a Rolo flat side up in the middle of each of them right away while the snickerdoodles are still hot. The Rolos will start to melt into the cookie and get soft and luxurious. Then sprinkle the top of each of them will sea salt.",
      "4. Transfer the salted caramel snickerdoodle bites to a rack to finish cooling after they've set for a few minutes. Then you're all done! Biting into one of these was quite a delight, let me tell you. The cookie was slightly crisp and golden on the outside and chewy in the interior. Then you get to that melty chocolate caramel center and it is too good for words. The salt on top enhances everything so much.",

Pour cream mixture over chocolate mixture in bowl. Let stand 1 minute to melt the chocolate, then stir until smooth. Whisk until sauce is glossy, about 1 minute. Can be made 1 week ahead of time, just cool completely. Cover and refrigerate. Rewarm in microwave 30 seconds at a time just until pourable before using.",

Beat on medium-high speed until fluffy and pale, about 2 minutes. Scrape down sides of bowl. Add eggs and beat on low speed to incorporate, then increase speed to medium-high and beat until mixture is light and fluffy, about 2 minutes.",
      "Scrape down sides of bowl. Add melted chocolate. Beat until blended, about 1 minute. Add buttermilk, oil, and vanilla and beat on medium-high speed until pale brown, about 2 minutes. Add dry ingredients and beat on low-speed just until blended, about 45 seconds. Divide batter among three 9-inch cake pans and smooth tops.",

Brush cake with 2 1/2 tablespoons of the Ovaltine-milk mixture. Let Ovaltine-milk mixture soak into the cake for 1 minute. Drizzle about a 1/2 cup malt-fudge sauce over the cake, so it coats the entire top of the cake. Spread out evenly. Sprinkle 1/2 cup chocolate malt crumbs over sauce. Drizzle another 1/3 cup malt-fudge sauce over crumbs. Scatter 1 cup mini marshmallows on top of the crumbs. Using a kitchen torch, toast marshmallows. Repeat the entire process with second cake layer, Ovaltine-milk mixture, malt-fudge sauce, chocolate-malt crumbs, malt-fudge sauce, and marshmallows.",
      "Remove third cake from pan and peel off parchment. Place cake, top side down, on top of the marshmallows of the second cake layer. Brush with remaining Ovaltine-milk mixture. Cover cake and remaining fudge sauce with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight. Pop the leftover chocolate milk crumbs in an airtight container and store overnight at room temperature.",
      "Once chilled overnight, place cake (still on springform pan bottom) on a cake serving plate. Rewarm sauce in the microwave, 30 seconds at a time, until just pourable. Pour over top of cake, allowing the sauce to drip over edges. Add a handful of marshmallows in center of cake. Using kitchen torch, toast marshmallows. Sprinkle the remaining malt crumbs over cake. Let cake stand at room temperature 3 hours before serving.",

    "title": "amazing soft pretzel rolls",
    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "1. In the bowl of an electric mixer (or you can do this by hand in a large bowl), stir together the yeast, oil, milk and water. Add the salt and 2 cups of the flour. Add the rest of the flour gradually until a soft dough is formed and knead for 3-4 minutes. You may not need to use all the flour-just add the flour until a soft dough is formed that clears the sides of the bowl. It is similar in texture to bagel dough and should be slightly more stiff and less sticky than, say, roll dough, but definitely still soft and not over-floured.",
      "2. Transfer the dough to a lightly greased bowl, cover it with greased plastic wrap and let it rise until doubled in size (1-2 hours).",
      "3. Portion the dough into 16 pieces and roll each piece of dough into a lovely little round ball.",
      "4. Lay out the rolls on lightly greased parchment or a lightly floured counter. Make sure the dough balls won't stick! Let them rest for 15-20 minutes.",
      "5. While the dough rests, prepare the water bath. Bring the water, sugar and baking soda to a boil in a large 5-6 quart saucepan.",
      "6. Working with one piece of dough at a time, carefully take it off the parchment or counter, flip it over in your hand and pinch the bottom to form a little pucker and help the dough form a nice, taut ball. Take care not to deflate the dough; you should pinch just the very edge of the dough.",
      "7. Place 3-4 dough balls in the boiling water and boil for 30 seconds to 1 minute on each side (the longer you boil, the chewier the baked pretzel roll will be).",
      "8. With a spatula, remove the dough from the boiling water and let the excess water drip off into the pan. Place the boiled dough balls onto lined baking sheets (lined with parchment or a silpat liner).",
      "9. Preheat the oven to 425\u00b0F.",
      "10. Using a very sharp knife or razor, slice 2-3 cuts into the top of each unbaked roll about 1/4-inch deep or so. It's important to use a very sharp blade so that it cuts the dough without deflating it. It's ok if the dough looks wrinkly and kind of funny. It will work itself out during baking. Lightly sprinkle each dough ball with coarse salt.",
      "11. Bake for 20-22 minutes until the rolls are deep golden brown. These rolls definitely taste best the same day they are made. However, lightly warmed in the microwave for a few seconds will do wonders for pretzel rolls 1-2 days old.",
      "Recipe originally inspired by many versions online that made me decide to create my own variation: I wanted more milk in the dough than water, different amount of salt and instant yeast, simpler method for mixing the dough, among many other factors."

However, if you are new to ganache it could be a good idea to make it all so you have extra to spread over the cake. Ganache does refrigerate very well for a very long time and is nice to have to heat up and pour over all things sweet.",
