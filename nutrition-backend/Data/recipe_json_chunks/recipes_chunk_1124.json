NOTE: don't cook this too long or too hard - you'll get a hard candy topping -- Joan cooked it for just a few minutes -- You can optionally add nuts to the topping. You can make the topping ahead of time and pour into the prepared pans while the dough is rising.",
      "Divide dough in half once doubled. Perform the following on each dough: Roll dough out oblong to about 12 X 18 inches. Spread milk over the dough with your fingers (1/8 C or so?) (note - some recipes call for using butter instead of milk - the milk does work fine though -- ) Sprinkle sugar and cinnamon over the dough. Can optionally add raisins. Roll up dough lengthwise. NOTE: First time I made these I used an unmeasured amount of cinnamon and sugar - sprinkled it on what I thought was liberally and it wasn't nearly enough. Researched cinnamon rolls on the internet and found 1C Sugar + 1 TBL cinnamon was a pretty common ingredient set in cinnamon rolls. I tried these amounts and the sugar melted out of the rolls when they cooked and left gaps in the rolls that I wasn't happy with. Next time will use between 1/2 - 3/4 C sugar and a slightly reduced amount of Cinnamon.",
      "Cut rolls about every 1 1/2 inches and place on top of syrup in pan. When you place the rolls, there will be big gaps between them - rolls will be 3 X 4 in the 9 X 12 pan. As they rolls rise the second time, these gaps will be filled in nicely. Let rise until \"ready\" (Second raise - maybe another 1/2 - 1 hour to hour depending on humidity levels?).",
      "Bake at 350 degrees for 30 minutes. Important - Check the rolls about 20 minutes inches If the rolls on the edges start to brown and the middle looks not done - put tin foil over the rolls and cook a bit longer. Once all are done, run a spatula along the edge of the pan and then immediately turn out (with topping on top) onto a bread board, cookie sheet, foil or wax paper to cool completely (But not a cooling rack - you want to capture all of the topping!).",
      "Aunt Joan lets them cool completely and then wraps tightly in wrap (freezer paper / plastic combo) and puts most into the freezer now days as her kids are long ago grown and moved away. Believe me - even frozen and thawed these things ROCK. (of course, you could eat them right away ;)."

Great on fried wontons, add some heat with a chili pepper or 4 and use to coat fried (tempura or otherwise) chicken pieces for my version of General Tso's chicken, or just on nuggets or breasts, also great as a BBQ sauce for pork.

Cover the pan with plastic wrap and chill the crust for at least 2 hours, or overnight.",
      "Once the crust is properly chilled, preheat the oven to 350 deg F. Unwrap the crust and prick it all over with a fork. Bake it until partly dried and partly firm, 15 to 25 minutes. Don't overbake at this point, because then your crust will be very overbaked once the cheesecake cooks. Set the partially cooked crust aside to cool completely before adding the filling.",
      "CHEESECAKE:.",
      "Preheat oven to 300 deg F.",
      "Peel the guavas with a veggie peeler, then scoop out the seeds with a spoon. Roughly chop the seeded fruit, then puree in the food processor. Another way to do this is to puree the peeled fruit in the blender, then strain the seeds out with a coarse mesh strainer. Measure out 1 cup of guava puree (set aside the remainder of the puree for another use, such as topping ice cream or mixing into a smoothie). Beat the cream cheese with an electric mixer until smooth and creamy. Gradually add the sugar and vanilla seeds (if using), and continue beating until fluffy. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition and scraping the bowl down often. If using vanilla extract instead of the seeds, stir it in at this point. Stir in the mascarpone and guava puree.",
      "Pour the filling into the prepared crust. Set the pan on the middle oven rack in the center of the oven. Place a shallow pan of water on the bottom oven rack, right below the cheesecake pan (this step will help to prevent cracking). Bake for 1 3/4 to 2 hours, or until edges are set but center is slightly wobbly. The edges should be lightly colored, and may have a bit of cracking. As soon as the cheesecake is out of the oven, run a thin-bladed knife around the edge of the cheesecake to loosen it from the edge of the pan (this also helps to prevent or minimize cracking as the cheesecake cools). Cool the cheesecake for 1 hour on a wire rack, then thoroughly chill the cheesecake in the fridge (preferably overnight, but no less than 4 hours). Once the cheesecake is no longer warm, you can cover it. If you cover it as soon as you put it in the fridge, the cheesecake will sweat and leave little puddles of condensation on the surface.",
      "GLAZING:.",
      "Once the cheesecake is completely chilled, run a thin-bladed knife around the edge one more time, then release the edge of the springform pan. Melt the guava jelly and water in a small saucepan, then bring to a boil. Simmer glaze for about 1 minute, then pour it over the top of the chilled cheesecake. Spread to distribute the glaze, then chill glazed cheesecake for about 1 hour before serving. This keeps very well if stored in the fridge, covered with foil."

      "Creamy Caramel Sauce: Notes:Adding any liquid to hot caramel will cause it to bubble up like an eruption of molten lava. Using a pot that is at least twice the volume of the ingredients will prevent boil-over. Heating the liquid first reduces the volatility of this reaction but does not eliminate it, so be prepared. Oven mitts and a long-handled whisk are helpful, and don't stick your head or arms directly over the pot. It is important to remember that the steam rising out of a pot of hot caramel is as hot as the caramel inside.",

      "Heat a saucepan of water and place a whisk in it.",
      "Wash and dry your hands thoroughly. Combine the water, 1 cup of sugar, and the corn syrup in a medium saucepan. Stir them together with very clean fingers, making sure no lumps of dry sugar remain. Brush down the insides of the pan with a little water, using your hand to feel for any stray granules of sugar.",
      "Cover the saucepan and place it over medium heat for 4 minutes. After 4 minutes, remove the lid, increase the heat to high, and bring to a boil. Do not stir from this point on. Keep an eye on the pan. It will be very bubbly. When stray sugar crystals appear on the side of the pan, brush them down with a wet pastry brush.",
      "As the sugar cooks, the bubbles will get larger. Insert a candy thermometer, and when the temperature reaches 300 degrees F, lower the heat to medium, which will slow the cooking. Continue to cook the sugar until it reaches 350 degrees F. It will be dark brown. Remove the pot from the heat and let it sit for 1 minute, or until the bubbles subside.",
      "Add the cream to the caramel. It will bubble up vigorously, so be careful.",
      "Vigorously whisk in the remaining 1 tablespoon sugar, creme fraiche, lemon juice, and salt. This sauce is now ready to be served warm or cooled to room temperature. It will keep stored airtight in the refrigerator for up to 1 month. When cold, it has the consistency of peanut butter.",
      "Souffle.Preheat the oven to 425 degree F.",

      "Using a standing mixer fitted with a whisk attachment or a hand mixer, whip the egg whites for about 30 seconds or until soft foam appears. Add the cream of tartar and continue to whip the whites for 2 minutes. Add the sugar and beat until the egg whites reach the medium-stiff peak stage.",
      "Using a rubber spatula, fold 1/3 of the egg whites into the caramel mixture to lighten the base. Fold in the remaining whites carefully so that the mixture is not deflated. The most efficient way to fold is to rotate the bowl and spatula simultaneously in opposite directions, one clockwise and the other counterclockwise.",
      "Spoon the souffle into the dish or dishes, filling them to the rim. Flatten the top with a metal spatula. Gently run a paring knife around the inner wall of the ramekin. This created a small wall of air between the souffle and the ramekin, which helps the souffle rise up straight. Place the souffles on a baking sheet. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes for individual souffles or 30 to 40 minutes for a large souffle.",

Cover with aluminum foil or such and put in fridge over night to marinate so the meat soaks up the flavor. Stir occasionally. The ice will probably all be melted the next day before you make the sausage. The meat kind of absorbs the flavors. Yes, it will smell up the fridge. In fact, it will smell up the whole house! Open the windows. Make the neighbors crazy!",
      "Next day, take the casings out and soak in warm water for several hours; it makes them more flexible. Cut in 4 ft. lengths. Shove the meat in the freezer for 1/2 to 1 hour before you start. The meat stiffens up a little and it's easier to put through the grinder. (We forget to do this a lot!) Stick one end of each casing on the faucet and run warm water through the inside of the casing.",
      "Ready? (Keep everything as cold as you can) This is the fun part. Put a little oil on your hand and run it over the horn where the meat will come out. Run casing through fingers to drain slightly. Put a casing on the horn. One person helps push the meat through the grinder while the other holds the casing while it is filling up. It kinda curls up as you hold it. I find for me that it's better if I hold it up while it's filling, less pressure on the casing. We make each one about 12-16\". Or until it splits! Tie it off with string or knot the end if you can get it close to the end of the filled casing. Some people twist it every 6\" or so to make smaller sausages. If the darn thing splits, you gotta scrape out the meat, dump it back with the other stuff in the dishpan and start over. Some years you're lucky, but some years the darn things split all the time. That's one reason for soaking the casings for a longer time, they don't split as easily. Sometimes it's just a bad batch of casings. Then all you can do is swear at it.",
      "We put the coils of sausage back into clean dishpans (on a rack if possible) and put back into fridge to kinda dry overnight. Then we pack them in Saran, aluminum foil, ziplock bags, anything that will keep the smell in, and put the packages in the freezer. We make 2-3 lb. packages. Since I have a vacuum sealer, I use that. It works really great.",
      "By the way, the sausage is pale because it is not smoked. We don't care for smoked kielbasa. But you can smoke it before freezing. Can't help you with that, though!",
      "We've been able to keep the sausage frozen for months. Just keep everything cold and clean while you're working. Keep a lot of paper towels handy to dry hands, answer the doggone telephone, etc.",
      "We have found over the years, that pork has become much leaner now.That is sometimes a problem. We've considered buying more fat and mixing it in but never have. It worked out all right just not cutting off any fat. But insufficient fat makes for dry sausage.",
      "It takes up about 1-1/2 hours altogether to fill the casings. It's really simple and easy. Of course sometimes we have splashes on the walls when \"someone\" gets a little rough pushing the meat through the grinder. Hey, that's the fun of it. It's a messy job, but someone has to do it.",
      "Oh yeah, the house smells for 3-4 days. But it smells good. If you like garlic. All the seasonings are to your personal taste. You really need a lot of salt though. The pepper -- eh, how much do you like? We like a lot. Same with the garlic.",
      "We keep a little of the ground meat and cook a couple of small patties of the sausage. That's when you can taste it and find out what you did wrong in the seasoning, too late, of course.",
      "Use the plate in the grinder which grinds the meat coarse. It's better if the meat is a little chunky. You don't want a mealy texture.",
      "If you run a search on google, you can find other information under kielbasa.",
      "One recipe I found says to knead meat and seasonings. Supposedly the more you knead, the more tender the sausage. We've never tried that.",
      "In recent years, we've set aside 3-4 lbs. of the ground sausage meat and made it into small patties like breakfast sausage, and larger patties like hamburgers. The grandkids really like that. We do, too. But for Easter and Christmas, it has to be the links."

Create a sofrito with the onion, celery and carrots in the olive oil that has been pre-heated in a fry pan at medium high heat. Allow the onion and carrots to caramelize. Once the stock and beans are up to a warm temp, add the sofrito, oil and all from the fry pan. Make sure you scrape out all the fond for extra flavor. Add the remainder of the ingredients to the beans and allow to cook on high 2 hours. Lower the crock pot to low temp and cook another 6 hours. You can use as a side dish, main course, dip. This is so versatile and will warm the tummy with layers of flavor. I sometimes sprinkle a bit of fresh grated parm cheese over the top for the main dish."
