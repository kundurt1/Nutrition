      "Prep all of your ingredients, and have your mise en place set up. Mix together the pickled peppers, lemon zest, and Parmesan. To prep the collards: Fill a sink with cold water. Holding each leaf by the stem hanging vertically over the sink, use a sharp chef's knife to cut the leaf from the stem so you get 2 leaf halves. Don't fret if a small amount of the leaf center stays attached to the stem, just discard it and move on. Swish the leaves in the sink to remove dirt. Working in 4 or 5 batches remove the leaf halves from the sink, giving each a shake to remove most of the water -- the remaining water will help to steam the greens. Stack the greens on a cutting board so the cut ends are on one side. Starting at a narrow end, tightly roll the leaves. Cut into crosswise shreds, about 1/8-inch thick (no more than 1/4-inch thick).",

Once shimmering, add the garlic and red pepper flakes, and cook, stirring continuously, until garlic is fragrant and just starting to turn gold, about 30 to 60 seconds. Add the collard greens and season with 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper. Toss the collard greens, then cook, tossing the greens occasionally until they are wilted and tender, and the water has evaporated. This will take 5 minutes or less. Add the pickled pepper, lemon zest and Parmesan mixture. Stir to incorporate. Taste for seasoning and add salt or pepper if needed.

      "To prepare the marinade for the pork, combine 3 tablespoons oil, 1-2 sliced scallions, garlic, chiles, soy sauce, 1/2 of the lemon juice, 1 tablespoon brown sugar, allspice, salt, pepper, thyme, nutmeg, and ginger in a food processor. Pulse until you reach a somewhat smooth texture. (it's okay if it's a little chunky) Pour the marinade in a large plastic freezer bag and add the pork loins. Turn them to coat and then seal the bag, rolling it into a tight cylinder. Place in a medium bowl (to prevent leaking) and let marinate in fridge for about 6 to 8 hours.",
      "Light a grill under medium high heat. Take the pork out of the marinade and brush with remaining tablespoon of oil and season with salt and pepper. Grill the pork over indirect heat until internal temperature is about 135 F, about 20-30 minutes, depending on your grill. Let rest on cutting board for about 10 minutes, then slice into thin medallions.",
      "While you're waiting for the pork to rest, you can quickly whip up the pineapple jicama salsa. In a medium bowl, combine the onion and the remaining lemon juice. Let sit for about 5-10 minutes so the onion can soak up the lemon flavor. Add in the pineapple, pineapple juice, jicama, cilantro, remaining brown sugar, jalapeno, and remaining scallions. Toss quickly and serve with sliced pork."

And for extra delicious risotto, I always add fresh herbs to the broth when it's heating up.",

      "Now add the Arborio rice. No liquid yet. Just add it to the mushrooms and give it a good stir. Doing this allows the rice to soak up the pan flavors before it starts cooking. Let cook for 3-4 minutes.",
      "Now add the hot broth 3/4 cup at a time to the rice. Each time you add broth, add a scoop of pumpkin puree and a dash of salt and pepper. Yes, add salt every time. Let the broth absorb in the rice almost completely before adding the next ladle full.",
      "When you have used all the broth, taste the risotto to make sure it had enough liquid to make the rice soft and creamy. If it needs more liquid still, add water.",
      "After all the liquid has been added, add the kale and freshly grated cheese. Mix so the risotto gets even creamier, and the kale wilts. Make sure the kale is chopped into small pieces or it won't wilt fast enough."

Rub the lamb generously with salt, pepper, and olive oil, and set it aside to come to room temperature, about 1 hour. Heat a small amount of olive oil in a skillet and brown the meat very well on all sides. Do this slowly, it will probably take 15 minutes to get it well browned. If you have room in the pan, brown the bones as well as you can. If they don't fit, brown them separately after you remove the lamb. Stick the cloves into 4 of the shallots.",
      "Preheat the oven to 325\u00b0. Line the bottom of a very large casserole with the pork skin, fat side down, if using, or oil it well.",
      "Put the meat, shallots, garlic, carrots, the browned bones, and the bouquet garni into the casserole. The shallots are especially delicious, so stuff in as many as you can. Pour the bottle of wine over all and cover the casserole tightly. Traditionally you'd seal the lid to the dish with a dough made of flour and water. I don't have a huge lidded casserole, and most people don't either these days, so I seal my casserole very tightly with heavy aluminum foil. You want to prevent any evaporation in the early stages of cooking.",
      "Place the casserole in the oven for 3-4 hours. After that time has passed, reduce the oven temperature to 275\u00b0 and cook for another 3-4 hours. This dish is very flexible, so the time is elastic. If you need to remove the casserole from the oven for an hour to bake something delicious for dessert, just let the meat rest undisturbed on the counter. If you need to start it the night before, let it rest in the fridge overnight, and finish it the day you want to serve it, do that.",
      "For the final hour of cooking you want to have the dish uncovered. With a cup or ladle, scoop out as much of the sauce as you can, probably about 3 cups worth. Let the meat and vegetables continue to cook in the oven until well-bronzed. Let the sauce rest for half an hour, remove whatever fat has risen to the top, then boil the sauce gently for half an hour to reduce it to a smooth, pourable consistency.",
      "When you're ready to serve the main course, remove the bones and the bouquet garni from the dish, set the whole casserole directly on the table, and serve to your delighted guests with mashed potatoes whipped with creme fraiche and lots of butter, and a pitcher of the reduced sauce on the side. You will be able to eat this with a spoon, should you be so inclined. It's that tender.",
      "*Use something that's not too sweet, not too expensive, but definitely not dry, and definitely white. You might try the Hogue Late Harvest Riesling, for example. Drink a red with the finished dish, but cook with a white. Trust me.\r\n\r\n**In France this is called couenne, and is easy to find. It keeps the meat from sticking to the pot, and also adds an elusive richness to the sauce. You may be able to get pork skin at a Chinese grocery or other ethnic market. If you can't get pork skin, just oil the bottom of your dish."

      "For bakers: lightly grease a cookie sheet or pan, and follow the above directions for piping rounds. Bake 10 minutes and then turn the broiler on low to finish the puffs off. As with the griddled puffs, sprinkle with grated cheese and Maldon.",
      "Serve warm! If making in advance, you can stop just after putting the mixture in the ziploc and then cook them fresh, OR you can reheat/toast the cooked puffs before serving."

It is very cost effective and your shopping list is very short. We often make this when there is a challenging weather system. It has been referred to as snow storm soup, hurricane soup, or rain storm soup.

      "I add Dijon mustard, capers, and one of the members of the allium family, depending on what I have on hand - green onion, red onion, shallot, or sweet onion.",
      "For spice I keep it simple. I like Celtic sea salt. Sometimes I will use white pepper, too.",

      "I do all of these ingredients by taste; though to start I will give you some measurements. Then, you can adjust them to match how you like the texture and flavor of your egg salad to be.",
      "In this recipe I suggest salting to your personal taste. Taste the egg salad before you add any salt. The capers and the pickled celery are bringing brininess to the recipe already. After you have tasted the egg salad, begin adding salt in 1/4 tsp increments. I do the same with pepper. You can always add more salt and pepper. You can never take away what you have already added!!",
      "Get creative! Other additions could include, but are not limited to: paprika, parsley, garlic chives, cayenne, pickle relish, dill pickles, bread and butter pickles, cornichons, Castelvetrano olives, pickled jalapenos, and the list goes on!!!",
      "To enjoy on a sandwich, spread on fresh baked rye or sourdough bread with a piece of fresh lettuce, sprouts, or pea shoots. You can make fancy little finger sandwiches to serve as Hors d'oeuvres. Egg salad is also wonderful on cracker or on top of your favorite salad greens. The possibilities for this recipe are endless!"

By placing the roast salted side down, the salt doesn't have enough time to draw water out of the meat, causing it basically to poach in its own juices rather than sear and turn that beautiful brown.

Saute, stirring now and then, until they've softened, browned a bit, and are wonderfully fragrant. Hold a strainer over the pot and pour the mushroom liquid through, using it to deglaze the pan and draw up any browned and flavorful bits from the bottom of the pan. Add the bottle of 2 Below.

The results will not be pretty.",

I usually find it easier to flip them if I use two skewers or two spoons, but use whatever seems easiest for you! If some of the caramel oozes out, don't worry, it is going to taste delicious, anyway! Once flipped, cook the other side for another couple of minutes until it is golden brown in color. Set aside to cool just a little bit (remember it has a hot caramel filling inside). Dust with powdered sugar, if you want. Repeat with the rest of the mixture. If you really want it over the top, drizzle the pile of tea-bleskivers with some of the remaining caramel sauce! Enjoy!",

Once the mixture starts to boil, swirl the pan occasionally, but do not stir anymore. Once the syrup gets a golden amber color ( in about 8 minutes or so), take it off the heat and strain the heavy cream into it, gently pressing the tea bags with the back of a spoon to get every last bit of flavor in. Add the butter. Be careful, the caramel will bubble up violently! Put it back on the heat and stir until the caramel becomes smooth and thick and has that perfect, pale brown color of a caramel candy - about 3-4 minutes. Pour the mixture into a small glass bowl and let it cool completely before using it as the filling. If you decide to make the caramel way beforehand and store it in the fridge, you may have to warm it up for a few seconds in the microwave, before you use it as a filling."

    "title": "focaccia",
    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "Make the poolish. Measure flour into a large mixing bowl. If using instant yeast, stir it in. If active dry, stir it into the water, then add the mixture to the flour. Stir it all together. It will look lumpy and shaggy and wet. That's perfect. Cover with plastic and let sit at room temperature overnight. By the next day, it will have changed dramatically. It will appear actively bubbly, will have a lovely glutinous texture, and will smell fantastic (photo 1).",
      "Make your dough. Try to do so early in the day so it has abundant time to rise. It doesn't like to be rushed. Pour all of the poolish into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook. Add both flours and salt. Add instant yeast if using, otherwise dissolve the active dry yeast in the 2 oz. of tepid water and add. Pour in the olive oil and honey. Mix with the dough hook on lowest speed until dough comes together and all dry ingredients have been hydrated. Dough should leave the sides of the bowl, but if some sticks to the bottom, leave it alone. It's called a \"foot\" and every good batch of focaccia has one. It tells you that your dough is adequately hydrated. Try hard to resist the urge to add flour until it goes away.",
      "Turn off the mixer and cover the top of the bowl with plastic. Set a timer for 20 minutes and walk away. You're giving your bread a rest period called an \"autolyse\". It allows the gluten strands in the flour to absorb water without at the same time undergoing the stress of being kneaded. It's almost miraculous how, after the rest period, when you turn the mixer back on you'll find a completely different dough.",
      "After the rest period, remove the plastic and keep it nearby. Turn the mixer back on to low speed. You should see your dough practically stand right up and square its shoulders and it comes together in its silken glory (photo 3). Knead for 2 or 3 minutes, then stop the mixer and test for a windowpane. Pull off about a walnut-sized piece of dough and quickly round it up between your palms. Next, carefully stretch it out over your fingertips. You're trying to get it as thin as possible (think sheer) without it tearing. If successful, you've just windowpaned your dough. The windowpane tells you that your gluten is developed to the point that not only will it hold up your bread, but it will also stretch to accommodate expanding pockets of steam, also without tearing and allowing the steam to simply escape into the oven, leaving a flat, dense bread behind. If at this point you can't quite get a good windowpane, toss the knob of dough back into the bowl and turn the mixer back on. Knead for a couple of more minutes, then repeat the windowpane test. When it's there, remove bowl from mixer. Turn dough out onto your board and either pan spray the inside or wipe a bit of oil around with a paper towel. Return dough to bowl, then turn it over so that the oiled surface is on top. Cover with your sheet of plastic and allow to proof at room temp until doubled in size. This can take 2 or 3 hours, sometimes more.",
      "When your dough has fully doubled - photo 4 - (press the surface gently with a finger, then let go; if finished proofing, the dough will retain the impression of your fingertip; if it still feels springy, it needs to proof longer), prepare your baking sheet. Oil it generously with your favorite cooking oil (I save the good stuff for the top). Spread the oil all over, especially into the corners, with your hand. Turn your dough right onto the oiled baking sheet (photo 7). Press both your palms into the oil. Working from the center, begin pressing your dough to fill the pan (photo 5, my assistant the lovely Amanda). Have faith; it will. Always work from the center towards the edges. DON'T stretch it or tear it! After a few presses, you'll feel it \"stop\". Suddenly it won't press without shrinking back. The gluten has gotten tired of being pushed around and is fighting back. Stop. Back away from the dough. Let it rest for 5 or 10 minutes, then go back to it, always gently. Repeat as needed until dough has stretched to fill the pan. If necessary, pour a bit of olive oil into the palms of your hands. Rub them gently over the surface of the dough. At the point, you're just trying to prevent your piece of plastic from sticking to it (photo 6). Cover your dough and refrigerate it overnight.",
      "The next day, a good 2 hours or so before you plan/need to bake your bread, remove the dough from the refrigerator. It needs to come to room temperature and finish proofing. Once again, it's done proofing when it retains the indentation of your finger. When it's approaching that point, preheat the oven to 425 degrees.",
      "Just before putting bread in oven, make both your hands into claw shapes. If you have long fingernails, you'll probably want to glove up for this step. Gently press your fingertips all over the surface of your dough, creating dimples which will trap your lovely olive oil (photo 6, lovely Amanda again). Pour the oil into the center of the dough (photo 8). Use you hands to spread it all over the surface; feel free to add a little more if you think you need to. Scatter sea or kosher salt over the surface, followed by several grinds of black pepper (photo 9). Place bread in oven and bake for 25 minutes, rotating at the halfway point.",
      "Focaccia is done when fully golden brown and glistening. Remove from oven and cool on a rack. When cool enough to handle, the easiest way to remove the focaccia from the pan is to slide a hand gently under one long edge and be sure it's loose all over, then slide it off onto the rack (photo 2).",
      "How to eat it? Slice it thinly and grill it (photo 12). Cut it in squares, split them through the middle and use it for sandwiches. Or, hold onto your hats, a hamburger. Once you taste a burger on focaccia, there is no going back."

      "Once the Brioche has risen, divide your dough evenly by the size you'd like it to be. You can round it out with your hands, like I do, or add it to a buttered loaf pan. I usually weigh my dough out on a scale to 100g per roll - or 50g for sliders. If you're making rolls, be sure to put them seam down on a pan with parchment paper.",

Don't leave them alone, open up the oven door once in a while to check on it that they aren't baking but that they're expanding nicely.",
      "Once proofed, take your Brioche and pan of water from the oven and preheat the oven to 325*F. Egg wash your bread and sprinkle some Maldon salt (or another one of my favorites: Caraway seeds) on top. Bake for 20-25 minutes, they should be golden brown.",

When all of the broth has been absorbed, the rice should be creamy, but not mushy. You may need a little more or less broth, depending on your rice.",

The dough should be soft and moist, but not overly sticky.

Let dough rise at room temperature until doubled, which will take between 2 and 2 1/2 hours.",
      "Assemble the buns: Butter a 23x33-cm (9x13-inch) baking dish, a heavier ceramic or glass dish is ideal here. Turn the risen dough out onto a floured work surface and roll it into a rectangle that is 46 cm wide (the side nearest to you) and 30 or so long.

      "The next morning, bake the buns: Take your buns out of the fridge 30 minutes before you'd like to bake them, to allow them to warm up slightly. Heat your oven to 190 degrees (350 d). Bake your buns until they're puffed and golden, approximately 30 minutes.",
      "Transfer pan to a cooling rack and let cool slightly. Make the icing by whisking the orange juice and powdered sugar together. Spread a little on each bun, or drizzle it over the whole pan. Serve immediately.",
      "NOTES:\r\nn the summer, you don't need more than 1 1/2 hour to double the dough. This time didn't left it in the refrigerator over night, baked as soon as I put them in the pan and were equally good.\r\nDon't have a stand mixer? Stir the mixture together with a wooden spoon, then continue stirring and beating it about in a large bowl for several minutes, until it comes together. Turn the dough out onto a floured counter and knead it for another 5 minutes. It will stick; don't sweat it. Just scrape everything up and into the oiled bowl when it's time to let it rise."

      "So. First make the corn stock. It is going to sweeten your soup immeasurably in ways that vegetable or chicken stock can only dream of, and you're going to need that sweetness to balance the peppers' notes.\r\n\r\nTiny Tepin chiles (here is an excellent chile reference guide that would be good to bookmark: http://marxfood.com/how-spicy-are-these-chilies/) have an intense heat, but it is short-lived. Japones chiles pack more of a punch, so use fewer if that is what you have. The chiles are going to deepen the flavor of your stock with a warmth that will be very different from layering them in on the soup end of things.\r\n\r\nI stripped the husks (keeping only the clean ones) and removed the kernels the night before, then refrigerated everything. An easy way to remove the kernels without them flying all over the kitchen is to lay the ear flat on its side on a cutting board. Use a knife to slice off a facet of kernels. Turn the ear, repeat until all kernels have been sliced off. Food 52 has an excellent demonstration of the technique.\r\n\r\nThat done, in the morning, all I needed to do was toss everything in the slow cooker and be on my way. Transfer the husks and cobs to the slow cooker, and add the warm (not hot) water so that it heats up faster (well, as fast as a slow cooker can heat anything up), and set the temperature to High while you get ready to leave. Before you go, reduce heat to low.",
      "When you're ready to make your soup, set a large soup pot in the sink and set a strainer, not a colander in it. Use tongs to lift the cobs and husks out of your stock. Throw them away. Pour the stock through the strainer to remove the fine particulates and chiles, then discard them.",
      "Set the pot over medium heat. Stir in the kernels of corn and the black beans.",
      "Once the onion has been peeled and sliced, arrange the slices on a plate or a baking sheet. Salt both sides and set them aside for about 15 minutes. You want its flavor to be fresh, but not harsh. The salt is going to break down the onion and take the edge off its \"bite\". By the way, this is a little transformative trick I learned from Chef Andrea Reusig in a conversation with Lynne Rosetto Kasper on The Splendid Table (http://www.splendidtable.org/story/andrea-reusing-key-3). Take a look at her Tomato Salad. You'll never see tomatoes, cucumbers, or onions the same again.",
      "While the onions are resting, roast the peppers. Anaheim peppers are quite mild, and when roasted, develop a wonderful, deep fragrance and flavor. Besides, you have to get the skin off, and honestly, it's the best way. Trim the ends off and split them in half the long way. Remove the seeds and white membranes (they're bitter). There are many ways to roast them, with these being the most common. Lay them skin-side-up on a baking sheet and run them under the broiler until they blister and char. Or hold them over the flame of a gas stove with a pair of tongs (hold the tongs with a hot pad!) until the same effect is achieved. In the end, put the slices into a plastic bag and seal it shut. Within just a few minutes, the steam generated will let you slip the skin off easily.",
      "Set a dry skillet over medium-high heat. Once it is hot, add the cumin and coriander seeds. Shake the skillet back and forth to toast the seeds. Once they are fragrant, they're done. If you over-toast cumin, it becomes extremely bitter and will overpower the flavor of whatever you put it in. Remove the skillet from the heat and immediately pour the seeds out into a mortar and pestle to grind them. Add them to the soup pot.",
      "By now, your peppers should be skinless and the onions ready to move on. Chop them both into a 1/4\" dice and add them to the soup.",
      "Bring the soup just to a simmer. You want the corn and onions to retain some of their crunch, so taste the soup periodically and remove it from the heat when all the ingredients are just heated through. Just before you remove it from the heat, season the soup to taste with salt and pepper.",
      "Stir the smoked paprika (add more, if you wish) into the sour cream along with the lime juice. Chop up a handful of cilantro.",
      "Ladle the soup into bowls. Garnish with a splop of the sour cream mixture and some cilantro (or not). Serve with wedges of lime."

      "Take a big pan, sizzle some salted butter in it, and just when the foaming subsides, coarsely grate an unpeeled potato over it on the large holes of a box grater. The potato, unmolested will still have all its starchy essence and the flavor that conveys. Do it sparingly, so that you see as much pan as potato; don't pile it up anywhere. Ozersky used a 12-inch skillet and rarely did more than half a medium potato at a time. (Alternately, you can grate the potato on the side if you need to brace the grater against the counter, then sprinkle in your latticework by hand.)",
      "Once the potato hits the pan, salt it. The reason you want there to be so much space is to give the steam somewhere to go. Potatoes need to shrink and shrivel, concentrating their taste down and replacing their water with precious fat. They can't do that if they're being jammed in next to each other like the crowd at a Motorhead concert. Give them room and let them bind with each other as the starch comes out. Amazingly, the shreds will form a latticework snowflake of starch, butter and salt.",
      "Once this happens, slide it out of the pan in one motion onto a plate. Then flip, salt lightly again and cook for another 15 to 20 seconds. Then eat! (Alternately, you can flip in a couple pieces with a tin, sturdy spatula.)",

Process until the pecans are in tiny, barley-sized pieces, and the oats are ground, but still have some texture (about 30-45 seconds). Add the 1/2 cup of softened butter in several pieces, and pulse about ten times, or until the butter is fully incorporated into the dry ingredients. If the topping seems too wet, add another couple tablespoons of flour, and continue pulsing.",

      "Cover the entire top of the pears with the crumble topping, making sure there are some big chunks of buttery goodness among the smaller crumbles.",

I find that baking time can vary wildly, depending on the oven I'm using.",
      "When the top is browned all over, remove the pie from the oven and allow it to cool at room temperature for at least one hour, preferably two, before serving. Serve by itself, or with a side of vanilla, cinnamon, butter pecan, or caramel ice cream."

      "Transfer the mixture to the prepared pastry bag and pipe the batter in half-dollar sized rounds (the size isn't nearly as important as the uniformity), allowing 1/2\" space in between each. Lift each sheet pan and firmly rap it on the counter 3 - 4 times, settling the texture of the macaron. If prominent peaks remain, use a damp finger to *gently* smooth them out. If small imperfections are visible, don't fret. Take pinches of the toasted coconut and sprinkle half of the shells with about 1/4 t. (use what you need, but leave half of the amount for the filling). Allow the shells to rest for 20 - 30 min on the counter.",
      "Bake the shells for 12 - 15 minutes or until the shells don't move when lightly poked. Rotate the pans halfway through baking, especially if your oven is known for uneven baking, and pull the shells before they take on any color. If your oven doesn't have a convection feature, a fun trick I learned is to prop the oven open with a wooden spoon to allow steam to escape. Allow the shells to cool completely on the sheet pans.",
      "To make the filling: Place the white chocolate in a large bowl. Heat the cream over medium heat, stirring frequently, until it just begins to bubble along the side. Immediately pour the cream into the chocolate and tap the bowl on the counter lightly to settle everything in. Allow to stand for a minute or two. Stir gently to combine the mixture into a glossy ganache. Add in 225 g. of the toasted coconut and fold to combine. Set aside and allow to cool to room temperature.",
      "When everything is cool, flip over the coconut-less shells and spoon about 1/2 t. of the filling on top. Cover with a coconut-topped shell and press lightly to adhere. Eat immediately or store in an airtight container, in the refrigerator, for up to 3 days."

Drain shrimp and lay in a single layer on a sheet pan or plate until they cool to room temperature. The shrimp won't be fully cooked at this point, which is fine, because they'll continue to cook in the marinade.\r\n\r\nIn a bowl or sealable plastic bag, combine citrus juices and orange zest, shallot, garlic, bay leaf, fennel seed, olive oil, 1 teaspoon of kosher salt and 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne (or more to taste). Add the shrimp and seal; refrigerate six hours or overnight. (The pickled shrimp should be consumed within about 24 hours from the time they're refrigerated or otherwise they'll turn mushy.)",

Toast for about 7 to 10 minutes, or until they're slightly crisp and golden.",

      "Wash and dry the tomatoes. Using a sharp knife, cut a horizontal slice of about 3/8-inch off the stem top of each tomato to form a lid, leaving one side attached like a hinge if desired.",
      "Working on one tomato at a time, use a serrated grapefruit spoon or small paring knife to cut around the inside perimeter of the tomato between the wall of flesh and inner pulp. Carefully scoop out the pulp, core, seeds and juice directly into a food mill set over a non-metallic bowl. Scrape out the tomato to create a hollow shell with thick wall of flesh on sides and bottom (about 3/8-inch), taking care not to pierce the flesh or skin while you work. Repeat the process with each tomato.",
      "Sprinkle a bit of salt inside each tomato then turn them upside down on a cutting board to drain while you prepare the rice stuffing.",
      "Puree the tomato pulp and juices through the food mill into bowl, discarding seeds and cores. If you don't have a food mill, press the contents through a strainer with the back of a spoon into bowl or pulse contents in a food processor to liquify then strain to eliminate seeds and cores.",

      "Pat each tomato shell dry, inside and out, with paper towels. Arrange the tomatoes, cut side up, in the oiled baking dish. Fill the tomato shells about 7/8 full with rice stuffing then spoon over remaining tomato juices. Place lids back on the tomatoes, matching up if separated.",

    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "To make the pie dough: Stir the flour, sugar and salt together. Use a pastry cutter or the backs of two forks to cut in the butter until there are pea-sized clumps throughout. Add about 6 tablespoons of the ice water into the flour mixture and begin to stir together. It will likely be dry and require more ice water, so keep adding water 2 tablespoons at a time until a shaggy dough comes together. Dump the mixture out on the counter and use your hands to form the dough into one ball. It should come together as a dough without feeling wet or too tacky. Cut the ball in half and flatten each half into a disk. Wrap each with plastic wrap and store in the fridge for at least an hour or up to a week. You will only need one half of the dough for this quiche. The other can be wrapped in foil and frozen for up to two months.",
      "To prep the quiche: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Use a floured rolling pin to roll the dough out onto a floured work surface into a round of dough about an inch and a half wider on all sides than your 9\" tart dish. Roll the dough back onto the rolling pin and the transfer it to the dish, unrolling as you go. Gently work the dough into the edges of the dish and trim off any excess dough, leaving about an inch of excess hanging on all sides. Fold the dough under itself and gently crimp the edges into the dish, allowing the top of the dough to extend about 3/4-1\" above the lip of the dish. This will help keep your crust tall even after baking. If your dough has gotten soft or warm while rolling it out, place it in the freezer for 5-10 minutes to chill up again.",
      "When ready to bake, place a crinkled sheet of parchment paper into the bottom of the crust and fill it with pie weights or uncooked dry beans. Bake in the preheated oven about 10 minutes, then remove the paper and weights and bake for an additional 5-10 minutes, or until the bottom of the crust doesn't look too wet and soggy. While the crust is baking, begin to assemble your filling.\r\nWhisk together the milk, 4 eggs, garlic powder, salt and pepper. When the crust is finished baking, crack your additional egg in a separate bowl and brush a thin layer of egg white over the bottom of the crust. This will help to keep the crust from becoming soggy. Sprinkle the parmesan evenly over the crust and then spread out the roasted veggies. Sprinkle on the cheddar cheese and then carefully pour the egg mixture into the dish. Be careful to not overflow the tart or the eggs could run over the edge of the crust and into the bottom of your dish. Whisk together the egg from the egg wash and use a pastry brush to brush a thin layer over the exposed crust. Bake in the preheated oven for about 35 minutes or until the top is golden and the center is no longer jiggly. Serve warm or reheat individual slices in the toaster oven!",
      "Notes: To roast your own veggies at home, cut a mixture of vegetables (I use eggplant, tomatoes, onion, bell peppers, and squash) into 1/2\" sized pieces. You'll need about 6 cups fresh vegetables to make about 2 cups roasted vegetables. Toss the chopped veggies with 3 tablespoons of olive oil on a large rimmed sheet pan. Sprinkle with salt and pepper and roast at 420 for about 20-25 minutes, tossing every 8 minutes or so, until the vegetables are tender and beginning to brown around the edges. You can make these in advance and store in the fridge until ready to use in your quiche!"

      "Quick guide to cleaning artichokes: First, put on rubber gloves, because the artichoke leaves make everything taste bitter, and you don't want that on your fingers (alternatively, just wash your hands and your cutting board well when you're done cleaning the artichokes). Rip off the outer leaves of the artichoke until the leaves look light green or yellow. Using a sharp knife, cut off the leaves at their base. Discard the leaves. The choke (the fuzzy prickles in the center of the artichoke) should now be exposed. Use a melon baller to remove and discard the choke. Using a paring knife, separate the stem from the artichoke heart. Save the stem. Remove any dark green from the artichoke heart using the paring knife. The artichoke heart should now be clean, so drop it in the lemon water. Use the paring knife to remove the fibrous outer layer of the stem. The inside of the stem should be a lighter color than the fibrous outside. When the stem is clean, add it to the lemon water.",
      "Thinly slice 3 cloves of garlic and set them aside. Set a large skillet over low heat. Add the olive oil, along with the thinly sliced garlic, chile flakes, lemon peel, and 4 sprigs of thyme. Remove the cleaned artichoke hearts and stems from the lemon water, and cut them into bite-size pieces. Add the artichoke to the skillet and adjust the heat to medium. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the artichokes begin to turn tender (after approximately 10 minutes, taste a piece to see how tender it is). When the artichokes are just tender, add the white wine. Adjust the heat to high and cook for approximately 2 minutes, until the wine has reduced by half. Remove the skillet from the heat, and discard the lemon peel and thyme sprigs. Set a fine mesh strainer over a mixing bowl. Pour the contents of the skillet into the strainer. Transfer the contents of the strainer to a container and store in the refrigerator. Transfer the remaining liquid from the mixing bowl to a large pot.",
      "Remove the roots and dark green outer leaves from the leeks. Slice the leeks in half lengthwise and clean them with cold water to remove any dirt. Slice the leeks into thin half-moons. Set the pot with the artichoke oil over medium heat. Add the leeks and cook, stirring occasionally, until they begin to soften. \r\n\r\nDrain the beans of their soaking water and add the beans to the pot. Add 4 cups of fresh water to the pot and bring the water to a boil. Adjust the heat so that the water is gently simmering. Add the remaining 4 sprigs of thyme, along with the bay leaf. Let the beans cook for at least 2 hours, until they taste soft and creamy. There should be a little liquid left in the pot (it should resemble stew). If too much liquid evaporates during the cooking process, add more water.",
      "While the beans are cooking, set a small skillet over medium heat. Add the butter. When the butter is melted and hot, add the breadcrumbs. Stir the breadcrumbs regularly until they become lightly toasted. Rub 1 clove of garlic against a fine microplane, and add the microplaned garlic to the skillet. Stir for 1 additional minute, until the garlic is fully mixed in with the toasted breadcrumbs. Set the garlic breadcrumbs aside.",
      "When the beans are soft, creamy, and fully cooked, season them with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Taste the beans. Continue to adjust the seasoning until the beans taste delicious. Add the cooked artichokes, along with the sorrel and the lemon juice. Stir regularly over low heat until the sorrel just begins to wilt, approximately 2 minutes. Serve the cassoulet garnished with a sprinkle of garlic breadcrumbs, and enjoy."

Fold each circle in half and gently pinch the edges closed. Transfer finished dumpling to a lightly floured baking sheet and continue with remaining circles.\r\n3. Repeat process with scrap dough and remaining sections until all cherries are used up. At this point, you can freeze the dumplings on the baking sheets. Once frozen, you can place them all in a ziplock bag and store for 3-6 months.",

      "Filling\r\nIn a large bowl, beat the cream cheese on medium low speed with an electric mixer until smooth and creamy, 1 to 2 minutes.\r\n\r\nAdd the honey, lemon juice, and vanilla extract; continue beating on medium low speed until thoroughly combined, about 1 minute.\r\n\r\nAdd eggs, two at a time, beating after each addition. Note: crack the eggs into a small bowl and whisk with a fork to thoroughly break up the egg before adding to the cheese mixture.\r\n\r\nDo not overbeat the cheesecake batter. Blend the ingredients quickly to add as few air bubbles as possible. The ingredients must be well blended, but excessive beating creates too many air pockets which can cause the cheesecake to puff up too much during baking, and then crack during the cooling process. Let the filling rest while preparing the pastry to allow air bubbles to rise to the surface.",
      "Fillo Pastry Crust\r\nNote: the one pound fillo dough box contains two packages of sheets. Only one package is enough for this recipe. Keep the other package in the refrigerator. Check back later for a super easy savory recipe using leftover fillo dough.\r\n\r\nPlace a large piece of waxed paper on your countertop to catch butter drips and make cleanup easier. Lay one pastry sheet on the waxed paper with the long edge parallel to the edge of the work surface, and cover the remaining unused fillo sheets with a damp kitchen towel to prevent them from drying out. Note: It is best to work fast with fillo sheets. Too much moister makes sheets stick together and hard to separate.\r\n\r\nWith a pastry brush, lightly brush melted butter on one half of the pastry sheet along the long edge. Fold the top unbuttered half over onto the buttered half. Brush the top of the pastry with butter. Gently place the pastry sheet in the prepared springform pan buttered side up with a 5-inch overhang. (The pastry should lay across the bottom of the pan, up the side, and have about a 5-inch overhang.) Cover pan and pastry with another damp towel to keep from drying out.\r\n\r\nButter and fold another pastry sheet in the same way and place in pan, overlapping the first sheet by about 3 inches. Repeat with 6 more pastry sheets. Remember to keep unused pastry sheets covered with a damp towel, and to keep pastry lined pan covered with another damp towel.\r\n\r\nWrap remaining fillo sheets airtight in their original wrapping or plastic wrap and store in refrigerator until ready to use for topping.\r\n\r\nPlace the fillo lined pan on a baking sheet with 1/2 inch sides to catch any leakage (trust me on this one). Briefly stir filling to reblend. Pour the filling into the crust. Gently fold the pastry overhang over the filling and gently press down to make a flat surface. Bake 50 to 60 minutes. Note: the cheesecake is done when the pastry has puffed a little and is a light golden brown. The edges of the filling underneath should be set but the center 2 to 3 inches are still a pool of liquid batter. The filling will still be soft and will jiggle when the pan is lightly jarred or tapped with a spoon.\r\n\r\nRemove from the oven and place on a wire cooling rack to cool. Immediately run a thin knife around the edge of the pan, gently pressing into the side of the pan to avoid gouging the cake. This allows the cake to contract away from the sides of the pan as it cools, helping to prevent cracks. Poke several holes with a toothpick in the top of the fillo pastry to allow steam to escape.\r\n\r\nWhen cheesecake is completely cooled, cover the pan and refrigerate for 12 to 24 hours before adding the Fillo and nut topping.",
      "Fillo and Walnut Topping\r\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Prepare 1 large rimmed baking sheet; line with 2 sheets of parchment paper.\r\n\r\nIn a medium mixing bowl, combine chopped walnuts, sugar, and cinnamon; stir together to mix. Set aside.\r\n\r\nCarefully loosen and remove the sides of the springform pan from the chilled cheesecake, cover and return cheesecake to refrigerator. Wash and dry the side of the springform pan. Use a permanent marker and draw around the inside of the rim, then turn the paper over so you can see the marking thru the paper.\r\n\r\nRemove reserved fillo pastry sheets from refrigerator. Stack 10 pastry sheets on a large cutting board. Place the rim of the springform pan on top of the pastry stack and using a sharp kitchen knife cut around the outside rim of the pan and through the entire pastry stack, making 10 pastry rounds. Note: the pastry will somewhat shrink while baking that's why we're cutting them outside the rim. Press firmly down on springform pan while cutting so it doesn't slip.\r\n\r\nDiscard pastry scraps or wrap tightly and refrigerate to use for another project. Cover the pastry rounds with a damp kitchen towel.\r\n\r\nPlace pan rim on the baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Lightly brush the parchment paper inside the rim with melted butter. Place one pastry round on the buttered parchment. Place another pastry round on top of the first one, carefully lining up the edges, and brush the top with butter. Repeat with three more pastry rounds. Spread the nut mixture evenly over the top of the pastry stack. Top with remaining 5 pastry rounds, brushing the top of each with butter. Remove the rim. Using a sharp kitchen knife cut the pastry into 8 or 16 wedges. Use a ruler as a guide, if necessary.\r\n\r\nButter the inside of the springform pan with remaining butter, and place over the pastry stack. The stack should fit neatly inside the rim of the springform pan.\r\n\r\nBake topping until the pastry is crisp and golden, about 30 minutes. While topping is baking make syrup and prepare cheesecake for assembly.",
      "Syrup\r\nMeanwhile, during the last 10 minutes of the fillo and walnut topping baking time, prepare the syrup. In a small heavy saucepan, add the sugar, water, and lemon juice. Stir over low heat until the sugar is dissolved. Add the cinnamon stick, increase the heat to medium and boil and stir about 4 minutes. Remove from heat. When bubbling subsides, stir in cognac. Return pan to low heat to keep hot until ready to use. Let cinnamon stick remain in syrup until ready to pour over cake.",
      "Assembly\r\nJust before fillo and walnut topping is finished baking, remove chilled cheesecake from refrigerator. Flatten the pastry crust that is atop the cheesecake. Remove baked topping from the oven, and remove the springform rim. Use a large spatula or cake lifter and gently place the fillo topping on top of the cheesecake. Gently run the knife through the precut wedges. Replace the pan rim on the assembled cake, and immediately pour the hot syrup evenly over the topping. Cool about 1 hour. Cover and refrigerate 1 to 6 hours before serving. Use the cut topping wedges as a guide to cut through the cheesecake."

Heat the oil in a pan, add the thinly sliced onions, sprinkle generously with kosher salt, and cook them on low, stirring intermittently, until the onions are nicely browned and caramelized (this can take a good 45 minutes, do not rush it). While the onions are caramelizing, roll out the defrosted puff pastry on a lightly floured surface. You want it to be about 9 1/2 x 11. Spread the puff with the caramelized onions (but taste the onions first to make sure they are properly salted)--you want the surface covered, but you might have extra; use your discretion. Then lightly dot the onions with the cheese, you still want some onions peaking through, but this is naturally to taste. (Note, I often use Cabot Clothbound--broken into small chunks or shredded ). Sprinkle with thyme, if using. Starting from the short end, fold each side of the dough halfway to the center, then again halfway to the center so that both sides are nearly touching. Finally, fold one side over the other. Refrigerate the roll, covered in plastic wrap for at least 40 minutes. Repeat with the second piece of puff. Before you begin slicing, preheat the oven to 400 F. Slice each roll into 1/4 inch pieces and place the pieces (face up) on parchment covered baking sheets.

Use a long-handled metal spatula or metal tongs, or the pizza peel, to lift up the pizza and take a peek underneath. 5 minutes should be plenty; don't turn your clams into rubber, please! The parchment will turn black, but it won't catch fire, so don't worry.",

      "Add the whole wheat flour, squash, milk, butter, sugar and spices. Beat with a mixer until well combined for about 2 minutes.",
      "Now, it's time to knead the dough. I use the bread hook on my stand mixer and it takes about 6 minutes to incorporate in 2 cups of the white flour, adding it one half cup at a time. The final half cup I prefer to knead in by hand on a well floured surface. By the end the dough will be smooth and elastic.",
      "If you don't have a stand mixer, or you just love kneading by hand, it will probably take you about 10 minutes. Turn the dough out on a well floured surface and add the remaining 2 1/2 cups of flour a half cup at a time, kneading well between additions.",
      "Place the dough in a well oiled bowl, cover with a dish towel and let rise in a warm spot until doubled in size, about 1 hour. If you have a cold house like I do it can be tricky to get dough to rise properly. One way to remedy this (besides moving to a warmer climate!) is to pre-heat your oven to 200\u00b0, turn it off and then put the bowl of dough in there. It works every time.",

      "Cut the roll in 1-inch slices. You should end up with between 12 and 15 rolls. Place the rolls in a greased 9 x 11-inch baking pan, leaving room for them to rise. If they won't all fit in the 9 x 11 pan use a 9-inch round cake pan or something similar for the extra rolls.",

They still want to be a bit toothy when you take them off the heat so that they retain their integrity in the dough. Kamut will take the longest, about 1/2 hour; barley about 15 minutes; and buckwheat groats about 10. When done, strain off water and allow to cool a bit before adding to the dough.",
      "To mix dough, pour water into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle. Add yeast and whisk to blend. Add all other ingredients, including slightly cooled grains. Mix on lowest speed until dough comes together and looks homogenous. This will be a sticky and fairly soft dough, but it should generally leave the sides of the bowl, so add some bread flour if necessary; just don't add so much that it is too firm.",
      "When dough comes together, stop the mixer and wrap a piece of plastic wrap around the top of the bowl. Let the dough have an autolyse for 20 minutes. This will allow the whole wheat flour to become fully hydrated, and also allow the water in the grains to settle down. If you overknead this dough, you'll essentially start squeezing water out of the grains.",
      "After the autolyse, remove the plastic and again begin kneading on the lowest speed. Within a few minutes, the dough should come fully together, leaving the sides of the bowl. Knead for 5 minutes, then test for a windowpane. It will not be as thin as what you'd expect from a dough without all the grainy content, but it will form a general windowpane.",

      "Flour your work surface - remember, this is a sticky dough! Gently turn dough out onto it. Keep your piece of plastic! Divide dough in half, and shape each as you wish: either shape it for conventional bread pans, or shape as hearth loaves. Dust the top of each with flour (I love that rustic look!), then drape your piece of plastic over them. While your bread is proofing again (and the second proofing goes faster, so keep an eye on it), preheat oven to 375 degrees.",

Place the strawberries on the sheet, drizzle with the coconut oil, and sprinkle on the brown sugar. Toss gently until the berries are evenly coated with oil and sugar. Bake for 25 minutes, or until softened and somewhat shrunken in size. Remove to a plate to cool. If you like, set aside several berry halves. Slice these thinly and use to top the loaf before it goes in the oven. Coarsely chop the remainder of the cooled berries. You should have about a 1 cup measure of chopped berries. Set aside.",
      "Reduce the oven temperature to 350\u00b0F. Butter and flour a standard 9x5-inch loaf pan. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, salt, baking powder, and coconut chips (if using). In a medium bowl combine the brown and granulated sugars. Work the lemon zest into the sugars with a fork, until evenly distributed and fragrant. Whisk in the coconut oil and blend together well. Add the eggs, one at a time, whisking to incorporate. The mixture should look smooth and emulsified. Add the milk and vanilla paste and blend again until smooth. Add the chopped berries to the bowl of dry ingredients and toss gently, just to coat them lightly. This helps keep them from sinking to the bottom of the pan during baking. Add the wet ingredients to the dry and fold together quickly and gently until evenly moistened. Transfer the batter to the prepared pan and smooth the top. Add your strawberry slices to the top of the batter, making a row down either side of the loaf. Place the pan in the oven and bake for 45 minutes. If the bread is sufficiently browned, tent it with foil, lower the oven heat to 325\u00b0F, and bake for another 15 minutes.",
      "Start testing the loaf for doneness at this point, inserting a cake tester in the middle or close to the strawberry slices atop the loaf. The tester should come out completely clean, and the bread will have shrunk a little from the sides of the pan. You may need to bake the bread for an additional 10 minutes or so to achieve this result.",
      "When the strawberry bread is thoroughly baked, remove the pan to a rack and allow it to cool for 15 minutes. Carefully turn the loaf out onto the rack to cool completely. Slice and enjoy! Keep leftovers, tightly wrapped, in the refrigerator for 3 days."

The sauce should be the consistency of a pasta sauce.\r\n\r\nTaste the sauce as it cooks, adjusting the flavor to your liking.\r\n\r\nAfter 30 minutes of simmering, the sauce is almost ready. You can let it cook for even longer (up to an hour on low heat) for a more broken down sauce.\r\n\r\nFinally, mix the cornstarch with 2 tablespoons cold water and add to the sauce. Stir over low heat for a minute to let the starch thicken the sauce. Stir in 1 tablespoon of sesame oil.",
      "For the noodles: Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to boil. Place half the package of noodles in the pot (unless you have a huge pot, cook the noodles in batches so they took faster). If you let the noodles sit in hot water that takes forever to boil, they will get soggy. Cook the noodles according to the package directions, tasting them as they cook, as you would pasta. I like to take the noodles out while they're just undercooked, because they will continue to cook a bit as you assemble the dish. The noodles should be dense and chewy.",
      "For the garnish: Julienne the Persian cucumbers. I prefer Persian cucumbers because they're sweet and crisp, with a light yellow-green colored flesh. They are the perfect complement to the flavor-heavy sauce and chewy noodles. Restaurants usually just garnish the noodles with cucumber, but at home, I try to squeeze in as much veggies as I can into meals. I like to top each bowl off with half of a julienne cucumber or more.",
      "For serving: In each bowl, place approximately 1 cup of cooked noodles. Top noodles with 1/2 cup of sauce and half of a julienned Persian cucumber. Drizzle with a few drops of sesame oil, and serve immediately."

If you are making a kosher version with all short ribs, add additional spices to the beef. Stir in and add additional stock if the sauce is getting overly thick. Simmer slowly for another half hour, at least, until the beans have really softened. Add salt last. Taste and adjust seasoning. You want a long, slow cook with this stew. It should reduce by almost half while cooking.",

Serve with sauteed kale (couve a mineira) or swiss chard, roasted cassava, and a batida de limao (or beer works, too)."

This is especially important if you only have one cutting board. Cut and prep all of the veggies/non-meat ingredients then prep the meat, this will prevent from any harmful cross-contamination.\r\n\r\nOk, back to the salad. Cut the cucumbers into thin rounds and chop the dill as finely as you can manage. In a bowl, add the sour cream, vinegar, salt and pepper and stir to combine. Now, add the cucumber slices, dill and mix. Cover and put it into the refrigerator while you make the Schnitzel.",
      "Next, tenderize and flatten the chicken breasts.\r\n\r\nThe secret in making juicy Schnitzel is pounding the meat! Yes, we have to get these breasts nice and thin. This will ensure that the curst is nicely fired and crispy while the inside of the meat is fully cooked through and stays juicy. If your meat is too thick, the outside will be browned and ready but the inside of the meat will not have had enough time to properly cook through.\r\n\r\nOn a large cutting board or a clean surface, place a large piece of cling film down, add your chicken breast, then cover it with another large piece of cling film (you can also use a zip-lock bag). I suggest doing one breast at a time if you are new to the meat pounding game. With a meat tenderizer/pounder/meat mallet (oh gosh so many names!!) OR what I like to use - a rolling pin, pound the chicken until it is about 1/3 - 1/2 inch thick. Next, season the chicken breast with salt & pepper on both sides and set them aside on a plate.",
      "Let's head over to the stove. Heat up a large skillet with 3 tbsp of oil. Once hot, carefully add the chicken breasts and cook them on medium-high heat for 3-4 minutes on each side.",
      "Time to plate up! It's very traditional to serve a slice or two of lemon with your Schnitzel, the juice of the lemon compliments the meat so well!\r\n\r\nGuten Appetit!"

Cook on medium-low-whisking slowly but constantly (making sure to scrape along the edges, too)-until the mixture thickens like a dense pudding, with your whisk leaving a distinct trail. (This took me about 6 minutes, but it can significantly vary by your stove.) Remove from the heat. Add the butter and vanilla. Whisk until smooth.

Remove from heat. Strain mixture through a sieve into a bowl, pressing lightly with a spatula; reserve solids for another use (a next morning smoothie, perhaps?). Return juice to pan. Combine 1 tablespoon water and 2 teaspoons cornstarch in a small bowl, stirring with a whisk. Add cornstarch mixture to juice. Bring to a boil, cook 1 minute, stirring constantly. Transfer mixture to a bowl, cool to room temperature. Stir in 2 teaspoons juice, and reserve."
