      "Let crust cool quickly in fridge or freezer.",
      "#5 Have every ingredient at room temperature, even the sugar.",
      "This will help tremendously with your mixing and blending.",
      "#6 Using cold cream cheese in your mixture will cause lumps.",
      "However, if you do find yourself with lumps anyway, run mixture through a sieve (tight strainer) and squeeze through with spatula.",
      "Or you can spin mixture very quickly in a food processor.",
      "#7 Don't use cream cheese in a tub or bucket of any kind.",
      "Whipped cream cheese has far too much air in it to make a sturdy or functional cheesecake.",

      "(or as your author recommends) You won't have to blend as much and risk over beating.",
      "#11 Another way of softening your cream cheese is place your brick in the microwave for 15 seconds.",
      "15 additional seconds for every brick you have in the microwave alongside another.",
      "#12 Also, you can add 3 1/2 tbs AP flour to your batter if your recipe doesn't already call for it.",
      "All purpose flour helps keep your cake from splitting and the flour doesn?t tamper with the taste whatsoever.",
      "However, it does effect the texture but not enough to make a huge difference.",
      "The benefits of adding a starch include: Your cake isn't as apt to rise in the middle during baking and eventually sink in the center.",
      "Your cakes top will be flatter and smoother than without it.",
      "Flour will also almost eliminate that dry, dark brown and raised/hardened edge cheesecakes are synonymous for.",
      "#13 It is important to note that cheesecake recipes that contain even a small amount of starch, i.e., cornstarch or flour, will produce a more cake-like texture.",
      "Cheesecakes that do not contain starch tend to be more smooth, creamy and heavy so choose your recipe wisely if you do have a preference!",
      "#14 Time wise, cook your cheesecake as per your authors directions BUT leave your cake in the oven after the baking is completed for a minimum of 2 hours.",
      "I know some say 1 hour, some say 6 hours and some say 5 minutes.",
      "However, I've always had the best of luck with leaving it at minimum (if hurried) of 2 hours undisturbed with the oven door closed and a maximum of 6 hours.",
      "In my opinion, even if your recipe doen't call for this step and you have the extra time, do it anyway.",
      "#15 No poking, no shaking and no toothpicks if checking for doneness during or after baking.",
      "In fact, don't check for doneness at all.",
      "Find a solid recipe with high ratings and trust it.",
      "#16 Speaking of your cake shaking, your cheesecake will shake a bit at its completion but by leaving it in the oven and the cakes refrigerator sitting time, I promise your cake will firm up!",
      "#17 When you cake is setting up, do not peak at the cake [even while baking] and do not open the oven door under any circumstances.",
      "Here's why.",
      "This will let the moisture escape from the hot water bath within the oven and will cause cake cracking and potentially dry your out your cheesecake.",
      "The point of the hot water bath is moisture, moisture, moisture!",
      "#18 If you find you do have some minor cracking on top, a simple cream cheese frosting will cover those right up and put a silky sheen atop your cheesecake.",
      "A garnish (fruit or otherwise) will do the same so no worries!",
      "TIPS FOR BAKING CHEESECAKES:",
      "#20 Preheat oven as per the authors directions for your specific cheesecake recipe.",
      "Take [3] 18\" x 18\" pieces of heavy duty tin foil and CAREFULLY wrap one sheet around the outside of your spring form pan, barely crimping the foil neatly and tightly over the top of pan.",
      "Be careful as to not make any holes in the tinfoil whatsoever.",
      "If you do, discard that foil and start over with a new sheet.",
      "Do the same thing again and again with the second and third sheet of tinfoil.",
      "Remember folks, no holes.",
      "This will keep the fluid from the hot water bath [listed below] from seeping through to your cheesecake.",
      "#21 Some professional Baker's have reported that using extra large Turkey Baking Bags work pretty good as well for keeping water out.",
      "However, I would still use them in conjunction with tinfoil for precautions sake.",
      "Mishaps occur all the time with hot water baths.",
      "#22 After wrapping your spring form pan that already contains your baked crust, fill your pan with your cheesecake mixture and level it neatly with a plastic spatula or spoon.",
      "#23 Don't tamp your unbaked cheesecake mixture on the counter after pouring and leveling it if you see air pockets.",
      "You'll shatter your crust and it will fall apart upon serving.",
      "#24 Place your spring form pan inside a deep roasting pan in the same bottom 1/3 rack as you baked your crust upon.",
      "Now, fill your roasting pan with piping hot water from a tea kettle until it's risen halfway up your cheesecake pan.",
      "Usually it takes about 1 1/4\" of water.",
      "Be careful not to burn yourself reaching in the oven while filing your pan.",
      "This method is slightly safer than filling the roaster outside of the oven and setting your cake in boiling water.",
      "All the while hoping you didn't rip the foil as you try to balance everything without scalding yourself just sounds a bit more dangerous to me.",
      "#25 Another option: Instead of placing your spring form pan inside a roasting pan is to place an oven safe pan filed with rapid boiling water to the side of your cake pan in the oven.",
      "It's not as effective but it does work!",
      "Moisture is moisture!",
      "#26 When you finally pull the cheesecake out, place it in the fridge and chill for at least 4 hours but longer is better for your cake.",
      "#27 When you're cheesecake is ready to be unhinged, a good tip is to use a hairdryer to heat up the spring form sides and use a clean, thin, warm butter knife to separate the cake from the pan walls then unhinge pan.",
      "Some Bakers even use the knife method just as the cake is done and then quickly put the cake back in the oven to let it sit for a few hours.",
      "#28 After a long chill time and unhinging your spring pan, use two large spatulas to pick up your cake and move it safely to a serving platter.",
      "#29 If your recipe calls for you to take your cake directly out of the oven and plate asap, it's a good idea to lightly butter the outside edges while the cake is still warm.",
      "#30 If you intend on freezing your cake, double wrap your firm, 4 to 5 hour refrigerated cheesecake air tight with plastic wrap and tinfoil.",
      "But before you wrap it, freeze the cake uncovered for at least 30 minutes so it can firm up enough to handle the double wrap without denting or mis-shaping it.",
      "#31 A frozen cheesecake can last up to 2 months in the freezer but 1 month is typically recommended.",
      "To de-thaw your cake, just place in the refrigerator for 24 hours.",
      "#32 Cheesecake should always be served at room temperature so take it out of the fridge 45 minutes early unless the weather is very warm.",
      "25-30 minutes will take it to room temperature.",
      "#33 Always garnish your cheesecake 1 hour before serving.",
      "Have your canned or fresh fruit in the fridge so it's fully chilled when you're ready to top and serve.",
      "Remember, the cheesecake should be at room temperature but a chilled fruit garnish is always desired and appreciated!",
      "#34 There's no need to purchase expensive fruit cheesecake toppers.",
      "In fact, one of the best cheesecakes I ever tasted was made with seven tablespoons of warmed, quality, multi-berry jam swirled within the cake and baked!",
      "#35 Most seem to think that a cheesecake MUST have a topping or theme of some type.",
      "However, have you've ever noticed that plain cheesecakes are usually the first to run out at a party or reunion?",
      "My theory?",
      "It's probably because the most of us are simply fickle by nature.",
      "Some like cherry but prefer strawberry.",
      "Some adore blueberry but don't want to stain their teeth in public.",
      "Some enjoy pineapple but claim it gives them canker sores so they decline.",
      "Some even gag at the smell of pumpkin.",
      "With that, [other than the lactose intolerant or extreme dieters] most end up choosing the pain ole' moist, delicious piece of cheesecake rather than going without.",
      "So don't fear the void folks!",
      "#36 Cheesecake is a lot like Sushi.",
      "In order to get a brilliantly clean cut, fill a bowl with steaming hot water and dip your knife in it until it's heated.",
      "Have a clean towel handy to clean your knife blade in between each slice.",
      "Viola!",
      "You'll have perfect slices every time!",
      "#37 Never use anything other than quality cream cheeses in your cheesecakes.",
      "Even if there is a sale on generic cream cheese touting 500 bricks for $2.00.",
      "While you can purchase the more expensive cheeses at a deli, the best cream cheese out there for the price is Philadelphia Brand Cream Cheese.",
      "#38 Always make sure you look for any special instructions (i.e., high or low altitude or barometer precautions) in your recipe.",
      "#39 As I understand it, some of the most famous cheesecakes baked at 3 to 5 star restaurants worldwide employ the low and slow methods of baking their cheesecakes.",
      "They start out at 350 then reduce to 275 and bake for 1 1/2 hours.",
      "After baking, they leave their cheesecakes in the oven and don't open the oven door for at least 4 hours.",
      "They also employ the hot water bath technique.",
      "So, if you come across any recipe that mimics anything like theirs, give her a try!",
      "#40 Kids love to help decorate and if you're interested in getting them to eat cheesecake, try putting whipped cream on top of your cake and have them decorate with candies such as: Skittles M&M's Mini Marshmallows Mini chocolate chips Mini Tootsie Rolls Fruit Rollups Banana Runts Malted Milk Balls Gummy Bears Or Worms Starburst Candies Twizzlers Life Savers Crushed Peppermint Crushed Peanut Brittle Marzipan Shapes Chocolate shapes & Curls Chocolate Mints Hershey's Kisses",
      "*Cheesecake has got to be one of the most versatile desserts in the entire universe.",
      "From fresh fruits to canned fruits, to chocolates and candies, it can accommodate most anything the most creative imagination can dream up.",
      "Is also healthy for you.",
      "Especially if you're a Diabetic with a sweet tooth!",
      "I personally have a Vampire Cheesecake recipe that's packed with 40 cloves of garlic as well as one that's topped with Foie gras moouse and Beluga Caviar in my culinary repertoire!",
      "Now, I'm not suggesting you try those.",
      "Just know that there are far more garnish options than Cherry or Blueberry!",
      "Face it, the garnish options are as endless as they are delicious!",
      "Follow these tips for as perfect of a cheesecake as you're ever going to make!",

      "The microwaving time varies depending on your microwave and how many onions you're cooking.",
      "This process is approximate, so use 7 minutes at 600 W for 2 onions as a guideline, and guesstimate how long you need to microwave the onions you're cooking.",
      "Also refer to Step 19.",
      "Put the onions in a heavy weight pot or frying pan and cook over high heat.",

      "The onion may appear as if close to burning.",
      "If so, add 30-50 ml water.",
      "After adding the water, stir up the pan in an S-pattern.",
      "When the water and onion are well combined, keep cooking and repeating Steps 7 to 8, stirring occasionally.",
      "When stirring the pan, make sure you are scraping off any onion and brown bits that are stuck to the bottom.",
      "Add 30-50 ml water again, as in Step 9, and stir in an S-pattern.",
      "Scrape off any bits of onion stuck to the sides of the pan, too.",
      "Repeat Steps 6 to 11, and cook the onions to the caramelized state you like.",
      "Gradually, the onions will start to brown when you add water.",
      "These browned bits are the sugar in the onions that have caramelized.",
      "This is the umami of caramelized onions.",
      "While it depends on the number of onions you use, how strong the heat of your hob is, and the timing of adding water, it should take about 13 to 18 minutes from Step 5, and after that, you shouldn't have any problems.",
      "If you want to turn the onions into a brown paste, keep repeating the steps and it'll get there quite fast.",
      "Key point 1: Add the water only when the onion stuck to the pan has started to brown.",
      "If you add the water too early, it will take more time to caramelize.",
      "Key point 2: Aim the water at the spot in the pan where the onions are the most browned.",
      "Sometimes that spot is on the side of the pan, but if you use the water to clean the surface, the water will turn brown and the onions will caramelize faster.",
      "Here I used 4 onions, and thinly sliced them rather than chopping them.",
      "I microwaved them for 12 minutes at 600 W, with 2 tablespoons water.",
      "I cooked the onions on the highest setting of my hob, and it took 19 minutes to caramelize them.",
      "For up to 6 onions, I use a frying pan.",
      "Here, I cooked 8 onions in the same way in a wok.",
      "If it's your first time, make a manageable amount in a frying pan.",
      "If you use a lot of onions, they will take slightly longer to cook, but this method is very easy.",
      "I used to caramelize onions the conventional way: over low heat, stirring constantly.",

      "Great for onion soup gratinee of course, as well as in curries and stews.",

    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "Remove the poolish from the refrigerator 1 hour before making the dough to take off the chill.",
      "To make the dough, stir together the flour, salt, and yeast in a 4-quart mixing bowl.",
      "Add the poolish and 6 tablespoons of the water.",
      "With a large metal spoon (or on low speed with the paddle attachment), mix until the ingredients form a sticky ball.",
      "If there is still some loose flour, add the additional water as needed and continue to mix.",
      "If you are mixing by hand, repeatedly dip one of your hands or the metal spoon into cold water and use it, much like a dough hook, to work the dough vigorously into a smooth mass while rotating the bowl in a circular motion with the other hand (see page 56).",
      "Reverse the circular motion a few times to develop the gluten further.",
      "Do this for 5 to 7 minutes, or until the dough is smooth and the ingredients are evenly distributed.",
      "If you are using an electric mixer, mix on medium speed with the paddle attachment for 5 to 7 minutes, or as long as it takes to create a smooth, sticky dough.",
      "Switch to the dough hook for the final 2 minutes of mixing.",
      "The dough should clear the sides of the bowl but stick to the bottom of the bowl.",
      "You may need to add additional flour to firm up the dough enough to clear the sides of the bowl, but the dough should still be quite soft and sticky.",
      "Sprinkle enough flour on the counter to make a bed about 8 inches square.",
      "Using a bowl scraper or spatula dipped in water, transfer the sticky dough to the bed of flour and proceed with the stretch-and-fold method shown below.",
      "Mist the top of the dough with spray oil, again dust with flour, and loosely cover with plastic wrap or a food-grade plastic bag.",
      "Let rest for 30 minutes.",
      "Stretch and fold the dough again; mist with spray oil, dust with flour, and cover.",
      "Allow the covered dough to ferment on the counter for 1 1/2 to 2 hours.",
      "It should swell but not necessarily double in size.",
      "Set up a couche as described on page 38.",
      "Carefully remove the plastic from the dough and proceed as shown below in the Shaping Ciabatta sidebar.",
      "Mist the top of the dough with spray oil and dust the dough with more flour, then cover the cloth with a towel.",
      "Proof for 45 to 60 minutes at room temperature, or until the dough has noticeably swelled.",
      "Prepare the oven for hearth baking as described on pages 9194, making sure to have an empty steam pan in place.",
      "Preheat the oven to 500F.",
      "Generously dust a peel or the back of a sheet pan with semolina flour or cornmeal and very gently transfer the dough pieces to the peel or pan, using the pastry scraper if you need support.",
      "Lift the dough from each end and tug the dough out to a length of 9 to 12 inches.",
      "If the dough bulges too high in the middle, gently dimple it down with your fingertips to even out the height of the loaf.",
      "Slide the 2 doughs (or bake one at a time if you prefer) onto the baking stone (or bake directly on the sheet pan).",
      "Pour 1 cup hot water into the steam pan and close the door.",
      "After 30 seconds, open the door, spray the side walls of the oven with water, and close the door.",
      "Repeat twice more at 30-second intervals.",
      "After the final spray, turn the oven setting down to 450F and bake for 10 minutes.",
      "Rotate the loaves 180 degrees, if necessary, for even baking and continue baking for 5 to 10 minutes longer, or until done.",
      "The bread should register 205F in the center and should be golden in color (but the flour streaks will also give it a dusty look).",
      "The loaves will feel quite hard and crusty at first but will soften as they cool.",
      "Transfer the bread from the oven to a cooling rack and allow to cool for at least 45 minutes before slicing or serving.",
      "Dust the top of the dough liberally with flour, patting the dough into a rectangle.",
      "Wait 2 minutes for the dough to relax.",
      "Coat your hands with flour and lift the dough from each end, stretching it to twice its size.",
      "Fold the dough over itself, letter style, to return it to a rectangular shape.",
      "Using a pastry scraper that has been dipped in water, divide the dough into 2 or 3 rectangles, taking care not to degas the dough.",
      "Sprinkle the dough generously with more flour and, using the scraper to get under the dough, gently lift each piece from the counter and then roll it on both sides in the loose flour to coat.",
      "Lay the loaves on the cloth and gently fold each piece of dough, from left to right, letter style, into an oblong about 6 inches long.",
      "Bunch the cloth between the pieces to provide a wall.",
      "You can add 1/4 cup (2 ounces) of olive oil to the formula and/or substitute whole milk or buttermilk for some or all of the water (even the poolish can be made with milk).",
      "In either instance, the oil- or milk-enriched product will be softer and more tender than the lean, water-only version.",
      "If you are adding the oil, you may need to also add a small amount of flouras always, let the dough dictate if it needs any flour or liquid adjustments.",
      "As you become comfortable with wet dough, you may want to try increasing the hydration and stickiness of the dough.",
      "The wetter the better, as long as it holds together enough to make the stretch-and-fold maneuvers.",
      "It is during the stretching and folding that the gluten has a chance to strengthen, resulting in the large holes so distinctive and prized in this bread.",
      "This dough is very simple to make in a food processor.",
      "See page 55 for instructions.",
