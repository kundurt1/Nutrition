      "Peel the potatoes and cut into 1/2-inch dice. Place in a medium saucepan and cover with cold water. Set over high heat, cover and bring to a boil. Once boiling, reduce heat to simmer. Cook until potatoes are easily pierced with a fork. Place the half-and-half and butter into a microwave-safe container and heat in the microwave until warmed through, about 35 seconds. Drain the potatoes and then return to the saucepan. Mash the potatoes and then add the half and half, butter, rosemary, salt and pepper and whip smooth. Temper the yolk in a separate bowl, the fold into the potato mix. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. While the potatoes are cooking, prepare the filling. Place the canola oil into a 12-inch saute pan and set over medium high heat. Once the oil shimmers, add the onion and carrots and saute just until they begin to take on color, approximately 3 to 4 minutes. Add the garlic and stir to combine. Add the lamb, salt and pepper and cook until browned and cooked through, approximately 3 minutes. Sprinkle the meat with the flour and toss to coat, continuing to cook for another minute. Add the tomato paste, broth, Worcestershire, rosemary, thyme, and stir to combine. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat to low, cover and simmer slowly 10 to 12 minutes or until the sauce is thickened slightly. Add the corn and peas to the lamb mixture and spread evenly into a greased 11 by 7-inch glass baking dish. Top with the mashed potatoes, starting around the edges to create a seal to prevent the mixture from bubbling up and smooth with a rubber spatula. Sprinkle with cheese, salt and pepper, if desired. Place on sheet pan on the middle rack of the oven and bake for 25 minutes or just until the cheese and potatoes begin to brown. Remove to a cooling rack for at least 15 minutes before serving."

Candy will cook over low heat in the following stages: 1. Butter and sugar separate 2. Butter will combine with sugar and thicken like gravy, yellow in color 3. Butter will separate from sugar again (sometimes not real obvious) and turn darker 4. When butter combines with sugar again and is quite thick, then candy is done. Candy will burn easily at this stage so stir continuously. It will take approx. 45 min. of constant stirring over med/low heat. Pour immediately onto cookie sheet and spread out evenly. Top immediately with ground chocolate and spread with table knife to cover surface. Sprinkle nuts to cover. Refrigerate for 1 hr. or so and then return to room temp. Melt remaining chocolate in a double boiler and spread on other side of candy, sprinkle with nuts on top. I usually take wax paper and lay it over the top of candy and turn onto a large cutting board. Then the other side of candy is exposed to add remaining chocolate and nuts. At conclusion refrigerate again for at least 1 hour. With paring knife cut/break into pieces. Save any left over crumbs for future toppings. Enjoy your hour of stirring to meditate and think about all the happy people who will enjoy your gift of homemade candy. I store candy in refrigerator and find it great to mail."

Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 12 hours. It will double in bulk and start to develop a yeasty aroma.",
      "The dough is now ready to use, but for a more flavorful dough, punch it down and reform into a tight ball. Put the dough ball back in the bowl, cover, and refrigerate for another 12 hours.",
      "To grill the dough, preheat the grill on high. Slide the dough onto the hot grill and cook until grill marks appear and the dough is set, about 2 minutes. Carefully flip the dough over with a large spatula or tongs or your hands; brush the top with olive oil, and cook until the dough is firm but not completely cooked and grill marks appear, another 3 to 4 minutes. Slip the pizza paddle under the crust and remove from the grill. Set a large cast-iron griddle on the grill to heat or place a pizza pan in the oven and preheat to 500\u00b0F."

Whisk until all of the ingredients are well-blended, without creating bubbles, about 1 minute. Set aside.",

Turn the heat to high and begin caramelizing the sugar, stirring constantly. Reduce the heat to medium-high as soon as it starts to melt, using a wooden spoon or medium silicone spatula, 2 to 5 minutes, until the sugar is completely melted and a beautiful golden Cognac color.",
      "Turn off and remove the mold immediately from the heat. Working fast, coat the entire mold with the melted sugar, rotating it in a controlled circular motion. If you are not experienced in handling extremely hot caramel, leave the mold on your counter and quickly coat with a pastry brush or a small silicone spatula. It is about 330\u00b0F (165\u00b0C) at this point. Set aside and let sit until the caramel sets, about 1 minute.

Place a large plate on top of the mold and gently but quickly flip upside down. Allow all of the liquid caramel to drizzle all over the flan. Garnish with almonds and ground espresso."

Working in batches, drop dough into oil by heaping teaspoonfuls (about 1\"-diameter rounds). Cook, turning occasionally, until zeppole are golden and cooked, about 4 minutes per batch. Using a slotted spoon, transfer zeppole to paper towels; drain. Sift powdered sugar over zeppole or put sugar in a paper bag and add zeppole; shake gently to coat. Serve with sauce for dipping."

Don't worry about the stringy bits; they'll get blended away in the blender. Place the butternut squash chunks on a baking sheet and drizzle with olive oil. Bake until soft. Depending on how small or big your chunks are, that could be anywhere from 15 to 45 minutes. 3 Meanwhile, make the browned butter. Melt the butter in a saute pan over low heat. You'll hear it start to crackle and see it start to foam as it slowly turns brown in color- should take about 15 or 20 seconds. Add lemon juice and sage. Let the sage fry up a bit, about 30 seconds, before removing the pan from heat. 4 Once the squash is cool enough to handle, combine with the browned butter and chicken stock in blender. Buzz until smooth, and season with salt and pepper."

Once you have basted the bird with the butter, place it in the oven for about 20-30 minutes. This is full blasting the chicken with heat to crisp and golden the skin. Once the skin has turned golden, take your chicken out of the oven. Turn the heat down to 300F. Add the wine and the water to the pan. Just add enough to cover the bottom and form a pool. Since the chicken is on the rack, the liquids should not touch it. Add less water, if necessary, to avoid touching the bird. Cover the chicken with foil to create a \"steam room\". Place it in the oven and let it roast at 300F for 1.5 hours. Meanwhile, prepare the mango sauce (recipe above). After 1.5 hours, check your chicken. Remove the foil and check the temperature for doneness. If done, turn the heat back up to 450F and roast for another 5 minutes. BE SURE TO CHECK THE CHICKEN AT THIS POINT TO AVOID OVER-ROASTING IT OR BURNING IT! When finished, take the chicken out of the oven and let it rest for 10 minutes before carving."

Cook over high heat, stirring, until the sugar dissolves and the mixture comes to a boil. Stop stirring and watch the syrup; when light golden streaks appear, carefully swirl the pot to help the sugar caramelize evenly. Continue boiling until the mixture turns a dark amber color. The sugar will begin to smoke; this is normal.",

Be careful, as hot steam will bubble up furiously. Whisk this mixture until smoothly combined. (If the caramel seizes and becomes a solid mass when the cream is added, return the pan to low heat and continue whisking until it is melted and smooth. You can minimize the chance of seizing by heating the cream prior to pouring it in.)",

Transfer to a container and refrigerate until the pudding is at your desired consistency and temperature-about 30 minutes for a warm pudding, and 2 hours for a cold pudding. (If the cold pudding is too firm, thin with a little whole milk.) Serve warm with unsweetened whipped cream."

      "1. In a medium bowl, stir together the flour, salt, and yeast. Add the water and, using a wooden spoon or your hand, mix until you have a wet, sticky dough, about 30 seconds. Make sure it's really sticky to the touch; if it's not, mix in another tablespoon or two of water. Cover the bowl with a plate, tea towel, or plastic wrap and let sit at room temperature (about 72 degrees F), out of direct sunlight, until the surface is dotted with bubbles and the dough is more than doubled in size. This will take a minimum of 12 hours and (my preference) up to 18 hours. This slow rise-fermentation-is the key to flavor.",
      "2. When the first fermentation is complete, generously dust a work surface (a wooden or plastic cutting board is fine) with flour. Use a bowl scraper or rubber spatula to scrape the dough onto the board in one piece. When you begin to pull the dough away from the bowl, it will cling in long, thin strands (this is the developed gluten), and it will be quite loose and sticky-do not add more flour. Use lightly floured hands or a bowl scraper or spatula to lift the edges of the dough in toward the center. Nudge and tuck in the edges of the dough to make it round.",
      "3. Place a cotton or linen tea towel (not terry cloth, which tends to stick and may leave lint in the dough) or a large cloth napkin on your work surface and generously dust the cloth with wheat bran, cornmeal, or flour. Use your hands or a bowl scraper or wooden spatula to gently lift the dough onto the towel, so it is seam side down. If the dough is tacky, dust the top lightly with wheat bran, cornmeal, or flour. Fold the ends of the towel loosely over the dough to cover it and place it in a warm, draft-free spot to rise for 1 to 2 hours. The dough is ready when it is almost doubled. If you gently poke it with your finger, making an indentation about 1/4 inch deep, it should hold the impression. If it doesn't, let it rise for another 15 minutes.",
      "4. Half an hour before the end of the second rise, preheat the oven to 475 degrees F, with a rack in the lower third position, and place a covered 4 1/2-5 1/2 quart heavy pot in the center of the rack.",
      "5. Using pot holders, carefully remove the preheated pot from the oven and uncover it. Unfold the tea towel, lightly dust the dough with flour or bran, lift up the dough, either on the towel or in your hand, and quickly but gently invert it into the pot, seam side up. (Use caution-the pot will be very hot.) Cover the pot and bake for 30 minutes.",
      "6. Remove the lid and continue baking until the bread is a deep chestnut color but not burnt, 15 to 30 minutes more. Use a heatproof spatula or pot holders to carefully lift the bread out of the pot and place it on a rack to cool thoroughly. Don't slice or tear into it until it has cooled, which usually takes at least an hour."

      "1. Place the dried chickpeas in a large glass or plastic bowl and cover with at least 6 cups of cool water. Leave on the counter top for at least 12 hours or over night. Drain and change the water out at least once, no earlier than 2 hours after the soak starts. Try and change the water out at least twice though the hummus will be delicious if you forget to do so. 2. Place the soaked chickpeas in a large stock pot and cover with 8-10 cups of water. There should be at least 3-inches of water above the chickpeas. Add the baking soda and bring to a boil over high heat. Once it boils, it will begin to foam. You want to skim away all that foam. That's \"dirty water\". Boil for 2 minutes while skimming. Turn the heat down to medium-low and simmer, uncovered, for 35-45 minutes. It should be an active simmer where you can see the chickpeas moving around with the water as it simmers. There really isn't a need to stir the chickpeas while they cook. You should be able to mash the chickpeas with your fingers when they're ready. Turn the heat off and set aside to cool to room temperature. 3. Once cooled, drain the chickpeas SAVING AT LEAST A HALF CUP OF COOKING LIQUID! Make sure to drain the chickpeas as well as possible to be sure that you get a nice thick hummus. Place the chickpeas in a food processor. Process until a thick paste forms, about a minute of two. Add the garlic clove and process again until smooth. Add the tahini, lemon juice, cumin and salt and process again on high. If the hummus is too thick, slowly stream in a little of the chickpea cooking liquid to loosen it up. You may not need to add any liquid at all. Check the consistency of this hummus before adding too much liquid. It should be super smooth with the texture of soft served ice cream. Taste for seasoning and adjust with salt and lemon juice. 4. For the beef, heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onions when hot and saute for 4-5 minutes until softened and translucent. Add the garlic, paprika, cumin, coriander, cardamom, cinnamon, nutmeg, all spice, salt and pepper. Saute for about a minute to release the oils and aromas from the spices. Add the beef and break it up as it browns. Cook for 8-10 minutes until the beef is cooked through and browned nicely. Mix in the pine nuts and cook for another minute. Taste and adjust seasoning. 5. Plate the hummus on 2 serving dishes and create a well in the middle. Place some of the beef right in the middle of the well. Garnish with olive oil, tahini paste, paprika, roasted sesame seeds and black sesame seeds. Serve immediately with pita or laffa. Enjoy!"
