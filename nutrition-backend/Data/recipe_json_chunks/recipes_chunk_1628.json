      "On a large baking sheet, toss the tomatillos, tomatoes, jalapenos and scallions with the chile oil and season with salt. Lightly oil the grill grates with vegetable oil, place the vegetables on the grill and close the lid. Cook the vegetables, turning only once, until they are blackened as much as possible; don't stress out if the tomatoes and tomatillos break open and begin to fall apart-it's a sign that they're cooked through. Aim for these cooking times: 8 minutes per side for the tomatoes and tomatillos, about 6 minutes per side for the jalapenos and about 3 minutes per side for the scallions. Using tongs, transfer the vegetables to the baking sheet and let cool slightly. Meanwhile, let the steaks stand at room temperature, 30 minutes.",
      "Trim the stems from the jalapenos and remove the seeds, if desired. Do not remove the charred skins. In a blender, combine the blackened vegetables, the garlic, cilantro, lemon juice and the toasted chiles de arbol and blend until smooth. Season the salsa to taste with salt. (You will have about 5 cups salsa; it will keep for up to 5 days, stored airtight in the refrigerator.)",
      "Make the steaks: Reduce the grill heat to medium high. For a gas grill, spread the drained wood chips in the smoker box and close it; alternatively, spread the wood chips in the foil pan. Place the smoke box or foil pan on a lit burner. For a charcoal grill, sprinkle the drained wood chips over the hot coals.",
      "Coat the steaks with the olive oil and season with salt and pepper. When you see the wood chips beginning to smoke, set the steaks on the grill grate and grill them 4 to 5 minutes per side, or until the meat feels only slightly resilient when pressed with a fingertip, for medium rare. Transfer the steaks to a carving board and let rest, uncovered, about 5 minutes. Serve the steaks with the salsa."

If your oven has an upper heating element like mine does, just before turning oven back on, tent with foil to protect top while oven is heating back up! Once oven has reached the proper temp again, you can quickly pull the foil off.",

(I've actually had to let 2 different roasts rest for over an hour when company was late and it was fine, but let it rest for at least 20-30 minutes loosely tented before carving.) Once it's out of the oven and before tenting to rest, scrape the salt \"shell\" off of the outside with a sharp knife leaving most of the rest of the seasonings on. It's the salt shell that keeps this roast so juicy inside! But it's very salty and not pleasant to eat. Spread with pats of butter to melt on the outside. Tent and let rest so the juices won't run out.",

And always make sure that what you're buying truly is a \"prime cut\" and not a lesser, more tough grade. Also, \"grass fed\" beef will always be a little more tough and \"gamey\" tasting than beef that has been raised by grass and corn. \n\n**If you prefer it more done, which I don't actually recommend, but if that's what you like, then add the same amount of extra time. *Remember, the ends will be a bit more done than in the very middle, so it's pretty easy to please everyone's taste just as it is. You can always place a few slices for those who prefer it more done in some hot au jus just for a minute or so on each side to cook it a bit further if need be, too. That also works really well."

    "directions": [
      "Fill a large pot with water and bring it to a rolling boil. When the water comes to a boil, fill a large bowl with ice water. Cut out as much of the core as you can from the bottom of the cabbage, then drop the whole, cored head into the boiling water for 3 to 4 minutes. Once the leaves separate and are pliable, immediately remove and drop the blanched leaves that separated (keep the pot of water boiling) in the ice water. Once cooled down, remove and pat the leaves dry. Repeat with any leaves still attached to the head and not pliable, until you've gotten all the leaves off the head, and they are all soft and pliable.\nAlternatively, If you've got time on your hands, you can freeze the wrapped head of cabbage for two days then defrost. When defrosted, the leaves will peel off easily and be soft enough to roll.\nHere's some other ideas from readers, although I have yet to try them so I cannot confirm that they work. 1. Place the cabbage in the microwave for 6 minutes. The core will slip right out and the leaves will be perfect for rolling. 2. Throw the whole, uncored head of cabbage into the boiling water. The leaves won't separate on their owm, but should be easy to peel off.",
      "Set aside about 16 of the largest leaves (these will be your cabbage rolls. If you can only get 14 leaves, it's fine) and slice off any thick parts of the vein on each of them, or just cut out the thick vein since that part will be covered once the cabbage leaf is rolled. Chop some of the remaining cabbage leaves to make 1 cup of chopped cabbage, and reserve.",
      "Mix the ground beef with the eggs, grated onion, chopped garlic, salt, pepper, and rice. (If you use cooked rice, you can test the seasoning of the meat mixture to your liking by frying up or microwaving a piece of it and tasting, if desired). Divide the meat mixture into sixteen equal pieces, or 14 equal pieces, about 2 to 3 oz each, depending on whether you have 16 or 14 cabbage leaves. Using slightly moistened hands (or not, since it rarely sticks to my hands), form the pieces into thick cylinders. Place a cylinder of filling near the bottom of a cabbage leaf (if the vein in the leaf is really thick, shave it down more with a knife before placing the beef on it, being careful not to cut through the leaf itself OR, cut the thick vein out completely in a narrow V. When you roll the cabbage, that V will be covered sufficiently, as mentioned above).",
      "Roll the meat filled cabbage leaf up, folding both sides over the filling, (like you see in the above photos) and finish rolling to enclose the filling, like an egg roll. Continue, filling and rolling all the cabbage leaves. Place them seam side down on a tray or baking sheet. Cover and refrigerate until ready to use.",
      "Over medium heat, melt the butter in a heavy, nonreactive saucepan. Saute the second onion until soft and golden. Add the garlic and saute for 2 more minutes, then add the reserved 1 cup chopped cabbage and saute for about 30 seconds to 1 minute more.",
      "Add the tomato sauce, lemon juice, brown sugar, salt and pepper to taste, and stir to combine. Increase the heat until it comes to a boil, then lower it and simmer for 5 minutes. Add raisins now, if using.",
      "Line of the bottom of a 13 x 9 roasting pan or glass dish with a layer of sauce. Place cabbage rolls, seam side down, on top of sauce. Top cabbage rolls with remaining sauce then cover the whole pan with tin foil. Bake for 2 hours in a preheated 350 F oven."

I am pretty sure can microwave these too if you choose to!"

Place the ham steaks in the pan and allow to sear undisturbed for 1.5-2 minutes. When a nice crust has formed, flip and repeat. Remove the ham steaks from the oven and lower the heat to low. Spoon some over the glaze over the sides of the ham steaks and place back in the pan for 30-60 seconds on each side so the glaze can become sticky and caramelized. Remove from the pan and enjoy."

The flesh of the purple variety doesn't peel off easily, so best to scoop out the pulp with a spoon; discard the skin. If cooking the orange variety, peel off and discard the skin using a paring knife.",

Working quickly, keep adding the flour until you form a fairly smooth dough that no longer sticks to your hands. If necessary, add more flour to prevent stickiness. Scrape the work surface frequently as you work to keep it smooth and free of dried bits of dough as you work. You can sift any dried out bits of dough and flour back onto the board to keep the surface powdery and ease kneading. Once you have formed the dough, stop working it and cut it in half. Cover the remainder with an inverted bowl to keep it from drying out.",
      "Form the dough into ropes about 3/4 inch thick and as long as you like for ease of rolling. Use the dough scraper or a knife to cut it into cylinders as wide as they are thick. Use a butter paddle, the side of a box grater or a fork, take each little piece and dip it in flour on the cut ends to prevent sticking. Roll it against the paddle, grater or tines of a fork, pushing your thumb into it as you do so to form a hollow, concave dumpling with a pretty ridged surface. Place the gnocchi onto the prepared towel-lined baking sheet. Repeat this process with the remaining dough to form the remaining gnocchi, lining them up on the towel without touching.",
      "Have ready a spider strainer or a slotted spoon with which to scoop the cooked gnocchi out of the cooking water. Fill a pot with 5 quarts water. Select a shallow serving platter and spread the butter in it. Bring the water to a rapid boil and add 2 tablespoons kosher salt.",
      "Lift the towel with two corners in the grasp of each hand, and position it over the boiling pot. Release your hold of the bottom two corners of the towel and drop the gnocchi at once into the water. Cook over high heat until the dumplings float to the top, allowing them to bob on the surface no longer than 1 minute before you retrieve them with the spider strainer or slotted spoon.",
      "Transfer the gnocchi to a warm, buttered serving platter, shaking the dish to toss and coat them all over. Scatter with the hazelnuts and grated cheese and serve at once.",
      "Note: Once formed, the gnocchi can be left out at room temperature, uncovered, for up to two hours, or frozen in place in an ample deep-freeze. Once frozen solid, slide the gnocchi into freezer bags and freeze for up to three months. To cook, drop them, frozen into boiling salted water and proceed as described in the recipe"

Add in the Cayenne Pepper before serving. Serve the pancakes warm with the sauce on top or on the side. OH! And for brunch a sunny side up egg will do the trick ;-)"

As you continue to roll, pull the mat up and straighten it so that it doesn't get caught in the roll. Continue until you have completed the burrito and continue rolling to close it completely. Squeeze together gently again one last time to ensure that the roll is secure.",

You now have the quartered potatoes boiled for a total of 15 minutes, and the sliced one for a total of 5 minutes. Drain off the water and set the sliced potato to one side.\n\nAdd about 1/4 of the milk and butter to the pan with the potatoes and mash them together, then set them also to one side.\n\nIn a saucepan on a low heat, melt the remainder of the butter. When melted add the ginger and garlic, saute for 1 minute, then add the flour and keep stirring with a wooden spoon, now add the milk little-by-little. At this stage you might need to turn up the heat to bring it to a simmer. Keep stirring to work out any lumps. It should not be too thick, so add a little extra milk if needed. Finally add the cheese, salt and pepper to taste. Again, set to one side.\n\n\nUsing individual oven-proof dishes, you can now start to assemble it all in layers.\n\nStart in the base with the baked beans in tomato sauce, then a mixture of the salmon and cod, which should be cut up chunky, together with the mixed sea food. Next a little mashed potato and on top of that some sliced mushrooms, add some cheese sauce then some more fish and sea food mix, sauce, mash potato and the top layer of sliced potato and peeled shrimp. Brush the sliced potato with a little butter. \n\n Place the dishes on an oven tray and bake for 30 to 40 minutes at 1800C until golden brown on the top.\n\nAllow this to cool before serving. During this time you can put together a salad to serve this with.\n\nThe overall dish should have a rustic and hearty look about it.",

Always make sure that the dish's you are using are truly oven-proof and fit for the purpose. Also use the correct oven gloves to handle hot items and not a tea towel.
