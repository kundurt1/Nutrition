Once it is hot, place the meat in the pan and sear the meat till it becomes brown and crisp on all sides.

      "Preheat oven to 400\u00b0F.",
      "Scrub each potato to remove dirt. Since eating the skin is part of the dish's charm, it is critical to get all parts of the skin squeaky clean.",
      "Rub the outside of each potato with vegetable oil.",
      "Bake potatoes in the oven for an hour.",
      "Remove potatoes from oven and allow them to cool for 15 minutes.",
      "In a bowl, combine paprika, cayenne pepper, black pepper, garlic powder, salt, oregano and thyme.",
      "Stir the spice mixture until well combined.",
      "Slice each potato in half.",
      "Scoop out part of the inside of the potato to allow room for toppings. Leave at least 1/4-inch border to prevent the potatoes becoming too crispy.",
      "Increase the temperature of you oven to 450\u00b0F.",
      "Place potatoes skin-side down and sprinkle inside of potatoes with spice mixture.",
      "Bake for about 10 minutes.",
      "Flip the potatoes, season again, then bake for another 10 minutes.",
      "Flip potatoes so the skin side is down again. Fill each half with sharp shredded cheddar cheese and top with bacon bits.",
      "Broil for about 2 minutes to melt the cheese.",
      "Remove the potatoes once the cheese is bubbly, then plate immediately.",
      "Top with sour cream, or serve it on the side.",
      "Comment: The secret of the Texas Roadhouse Tater Skins is a delicate balance between a slightly crisp outside and a soft, fluffy potato inside. You can easily alter this recipe to include your favorite types of cheeses. Consider using a Mexican blend for a nice treat. Opt for freshly prepared bacon bits rather than pre-packaged varieties for the best flavor. For an extra spicy kick, drizzle your favorite hot sauce over the top, or add a bit of Cayenne pepper to spice the blend."

      "Pour mixture into a lightly greased 11X15 pan.",
      "Bake for about 40 minutes or until fork is clean. (Do not open oven until after 30 minutes have passed or cake will sink.) (If you are using a glass pan, it will cook much faster than when it's in a foil or aluminum).",
      "After 30 minutes, you can begin testing the cake with a knife. Once it comes out clean, the cake is ready!",
      "Recipe for the Tres Leches:",

      "You may need to blend these ingredients in two batches because they may not all fit. Have a large bowl ready where you can combine both blender batches.",
      "We filled the first blender with 1 can of condensed milk, 1 can of evaporated milk, half a pint of heavy cream, and the vanilla extract. Blend until mixed thoroughly. Then poured the mix into a large bowl. In the second blender, we combined the remaining ingredients (the rest of the heavy cream, 1 can of evaporated milk, 1 can of condensed milk, and a shot of Bailey's).",
      "Set the milk mixture aside until the cake is ready and out of the oven.",
      "While the cake is still hot, poke a bunch of holes with a fork, and begin pouring the milk mixture onto the hot cake. Keep piercing the cake as you pour. (It helps to pour the milk mixture in a pitcher-like-container or something with a spout).",
      "The finished product will look a little messy. But remember the icing is beautiful, and will cover the puncture holes.",
      "Set the cake aside. It needs to cool and soak up the milk.",
      "Recipe for the Meringue:",
      "The safest thing to do is to leave the cake in the fridge covered over night. And then make the icing right before you serve the cake.",
      "First, get all your ingredients ready for the icing. I would recommend using fresh egg whites (not like I did).",
      "Mix the 6 egg whites in your Kitchen Aid or a hand held blender. (I have neither at my house, so I got a real work out mixing those egg whites!) Mix egg whites a \"punto de nieve-\" It has to look thick yet fluffy like fresh ice cream. In the picture below, it's almost ready, but not quite.",
      "* Add 1/4 teaspoon of Cream of Tartar to hold the meringue if you're not serving cake right away.",
      "Meanwhile, add 1/2 cup of sugar into a small sauce pan.",
      "Then, pour just enough water to cover sugar. You may not need the entire amount but do not go over 1/2 cup if it is not covered.",
      "Heat in medium-low heat and stir frequently.",
      "Keep testing it by dipping a fork and lifting it up in the air. Once it is, an \"hilo\" or string will form as you lift the fork. Then you are ready for next step. It might take a while but it is important to get the right consistency. And you need to move quickly with this next step before sugar cools.",
      "Now, while the sugar is hot go back to your egg whites. Add sugar mixture a little at a time while mixing. Once it is all blended in, add a little more. Dont do it too fast or it wont mix right but dont do it too slow or sugar will cool down. Keep mixing until bowl is cool.",
      "Frost your cake and enjoy!"

I can see where some would prefer a sweeter version but me, I like the juice from the fruit to add their signature flavors, not anything else. Make sure to let it sit for several hours before serving. A definite party-maker!",
