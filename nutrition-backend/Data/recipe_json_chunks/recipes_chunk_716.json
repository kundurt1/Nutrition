      "Put the garlic, ginger and 1/2 cup wine vinegar into the container of an electric blender and blend at high speed until smooth. In a 4-quart heavy-bottomed pot with nonmetallic finish, place the tomatoes and juice from the can, the rest of the wine vinegar, sugar, salt and cayenne pepper in pot. Bring to a boil. Add puree from blender. Lower heat and simmer gently, uncovered, for about 1 1/2 to 2 hours or until chutney becomes thick. Chutney should cling to spoon. Stir occasionally at first and more frequently later as it thickens. You may need to lower the heat as the liquid diminishes. You should end up with about 2 1/2 cups chutney and it should be at least as thick as honey after it cools. Add almonds and raisins. Simmer, stirring about 5 minutes. Turn heat off and allow to cool. Bottle and keep refrigerated."
