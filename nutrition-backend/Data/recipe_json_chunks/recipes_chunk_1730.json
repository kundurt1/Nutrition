      "If you are making this without refrigerating the dough : preheat oven to 300F and grease some cookie sheets, or line them with parchment paper if they aren't non-stick.",
      "In a small bowl, sift together the whole wheat flour, tapioca, baking powder, soda, salt and allspice, then add the ground oats and whisk to combine.",
      "The butter must hold its shape, but not be hard or mushy.",
      "If hard, let it sit on the counter a while longer, if mushy, refrigirate it, checking the texture every few minutes.",
      "Then, in a large bowl, cream the butter with a wooden spoon.",
      "Beat the butter and the sugar together using an electric mixer on medium speed approximately 30 seconds.",
      "The mixture must become light and airy.",
      "If it becomes soggy, put it back in the fridge and try again in a couple minutes.",
      "A trick to bring the egg at room temperature quickly is to put it in a bowl of lukewarm water a couple minutes.",
      "Carefully beat the egg in the butter mixture, 1 tbsp at a time, and finish by adding the vanilla extract and beating another 30 seconds.",
      "With a rubber spatula, add the dry ingredients and mix them until almost blended.",
      "You will finish mixing at the next step.",
      "Add your choice of chips and sprinkle the instant coffee, and mix only until combined.",
      "At this step, you have some choices to make : you can either use the dough as is and drop it on your cookie sheet to bake immediately, or chill the dough about 2 hours, or until it doesn't stick much anymore and then roll balls with your hands.",
      "The first option will make cookies of a more uniform texture while the second will make them crispier on the edges and chewier in the center, while having perfectly uniform sizes and shapes.",
      "If you decide to refrigerate the dough, now is the time to grease the cookie sheets, and preheat your oven about 15 minutes before cooking the cookies.",
      "Now, choose the size of your cookies : anywhere from teaspoons to 1/3 cups.",
      "A \"standard\" cookie would be about 1/8 cup.",
      "Do not vary the size on a same sheet, since the cooking time is different for each size.",
      "Using your measure, drop the cookie dough if it's fresh or roll it between your palms if it's refrigerated and place it onto your cookie sheet.",
      "Flatten them gently with the back of a spoon, ensuring about 3/4\" thickness.",
      "Keep in mind they need to be 1 to 3 inches apart, depending on their size (they will expand).",
      "Bake for about 15 to 30 minutes depending on their size or until nicely browned around the edges.",
      "Bake a little less for chewy cookies and a little longer for crispier cookies.",
      "The trick here is to experiment and find out what works for you.",
      "You can start by cooking only a few at a time until you get them just how you like.",
      "Let the cookies sit 1 or 2 minutes on the sheets and transfer to cooling racks.",
      "Wait a couple minutes, and enjoy!",
      "You can keep the cooled cookies in a jar, with paper towels between the layers (to absorb excess humidity)."

      "Bring the mixture to a simmer over low heat.",
      "Add in the brine from the green peppercorns, lower the heat and submerge the duck, breast side down, into the pot.",
      "Let it simmer 30 seconds, basting the top side with the liquid.",
      "Remove the duck and arrange it, breast side down, in a roasting pan fitted with a rack that elevates it off the bottom of the pan.",
      "The rack will allow hot air to circulate around it as it cooks.",
      "(Cook's note: Ideally, the duck should sit overnight to allow the flavors to meld with the meat and for the skin to dry out.",
      "This will mean a crispier skin, once the duck is cooked.)",
      "Put the roasting pan into the oven and turn the temperature down to 400 degrees F. Allow about 15 minutes roasting time for each pound of duck.",
      "Cook for 20 to 25 minutes, remove the pan from the oven, then flip the duck.",

      "Return the duck to the oven and cook for another 45 minutes to1 hour, depending upon the size of your duck.",
      "Meanwhile, in a medium pot, combine the champagne vinegar with the remaining 1/4 cup soy sauce, 1/4 cup honey, Marsala and the reserved green peppercorns.",
      "Bring the ingredients to a boil over high heat.",
      "Lower the heat and simmer gently, allowing the glaze to reduce and the flavors to blend.",
      "Taste for seasoning.",
      "Allow it to cook until all the flavors meld together.",
      "Remove the duck from the oven and baste it with the drippings in the bottom of the pan.",
