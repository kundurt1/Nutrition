      "Defrost Puff Pastry dough fully for 30 - 40 minutes, covered lightly with plastic wrap. Next, Remove stalk from Fennel leaving only the Bulb. Reserve Fronds for Creme Filling and Garnish. Shave off any bruised areas of the Bulb and discard. Set a large pot of salted water to boil.",
      "Preheat oven to 390 degrees with rack in the middle.",
      "Once water has boiled, add the Fennel bulb and cook for 15 minutes. Meanwhile, lightly grease a baking sheet with sides with butter or a tiny bit of Oil. Now you are ready to prepare the dough.",
      "Flour a surface lightly and lay the Dough down. \r\nSprinkle the top of the Dough with some more flour. \r\nCut the top third of the Dough off to form a rectangular shape (though you can certainly create any shape you choose though you must consider changes in cooking time). Roll the Dough Lightly with a rolling pin until it is about 1/8 inch thick. Move the Dough to the baking sheet and trim the edges of the Dough with a knife to make the rectangle more even. \r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nNext, score the Dough all around the rectangle about a centimeter in from the edge.\r\n\r\nFold the scored edges in at a 90 degree angle to form a crust. \r\n\r\nPinch the corners really well so they stay fused, also pressing the insides of the corners into the base of the tart.",
      "When Fennel Bulb has finished cooking, remove it and rinse with cold water. Dry the outside thoroughly and slice horizontally into thin slices. The slices will look roughly like rings cut in half. Discard the circles of hard inner core that you find. Take the remaining slices of fennel and pat dry with paper towel.\r\nNow, Arrange Fennel all over the Tart .",
      "Mix all ingredients for the Creme Filling in a small bowl.\r\nNext, carefully pour in as much of the Creme as it takes to the cover the Tart (don't overfill). There will likely be some Creme leftover. \r\nCook's Note: Without the use of a tart pan (my preference), there is a chance that some of the filling will flow over the sides of the crust as the tart bakes. This is absolutely ok! If any overflow occurs, simply allow the tart to cool a bit and trace around it with a knife to clean up the edges. It will come out looking just perfect so don't fret!",
      "Next, sprinkle Pecorino Romano Cheese \r\nall over the Tart.",
      "Finish with an additional dash of Black Pepper.\r\nPlace Baking Sheet in the oven and bake 40 minutes until crust is crispy and golden. Cool a bit, clean up the Tart edges with a knife if any of the Creme spilled over (*see cook's note above), and garnish with additional Fennel Fronds. Slice, serve, and enjoy! (P.S. also tastes great at room temperature)."

      "Prepare the dressing by mixing the oil, low-sodium soy sauce, garlic and ginger; stir well. Combine the rice, fish, green onions, and carrots with the dressing and toss lightly. It's best after sitting a few minutes.",
      "The result?\r\nWe were both very surprised at how good this was. And filling, too. If I had to eat a low-sodium diet myself, I definitely want this in my rotation. I think it could be done with chicken or shrimp, also. Looking at the ingredients, it is basically the same ingredients as what we use for fried rice, without so much oil and sauce (and no egg). If you can't have fried rice, you might find this a satisfying substitute.\r\nLow sodium note: I used Kikkoman's low sodium soy sauce, which has 537 mg sodium in one tablespoon. This dish made about 5-6 cups. So, in theory, the only salt in this dish was the 1/8 teaspoon salt in the rice, and this soy sauce. I believe that there are some other low sodium soy sauces that have about half the amount of sodium in each tablespoon, but I'm not sure of the brand."

You can do this in a food processor or by hand. Bit by bit add the rest of the water, working the dough after each addition. This is important to allow the flour to absorb all the water. Good flour can absorb even 70-80% of its weight in water. If, while adding the water, you see that it's losing its 'doughness' and becoming a batter, then stop, add a bit more flour until it returns to a dough. Add a tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil to the dough.",

Cover with a damp cloth and set it in a warm place, away from drafts, until it doubles in size (about one hour).

You're looking for a texture that is a bit drier than a normal crouton, which will ensure they retain their shape and don't get mushy in the cooktop stuffing. Once toasted, you should have around 41/2 cups of croutons. Set aside and let cool before using. They can be made a day in advance and stored in an air-tight container.",
      "In a 3 or 4 quart casserole or Dutch oven with a tight-fitting lid, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add chile and let sizzle in pan for 1 minute. Next add fennel seeds, fennel, onion, thyme, rosemary, and garlic. Season with salt and pepper and saute until vegetables are tender and lightly caramelized, about 6 minutes.",
      "Add kale to pan, tossing with tongs to evenly coat the kale with the oil. Season with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste. Saute for about 3 to 4 minutes, tossing occasionally. The kale will turn bright green, slacken, and start to tenderize.",

Uncover pan, fluff with fork, and season to taste with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper. All of the stock should be absorbed and your croutons should be soft yet have retained their shape. Since ciabatta loaves will naturally vary in texture, here are a few troubleshooting notes, if needed: if any stock remains yet croutons are soft, pour off excess and return the pan to low heat so that it all evaporates. If croutons are not soft, add a few tablespoons of stock, bring to a simmer, cover and let rest for a few more minutes.",

Remove the husks from the tomatillos. Cut them in half. Place tomatillos and pepper halves in a mixing bowl. Add 2 or 3 ounces of oil, and toss them all until coated. Set a grill pan on the barbecue grate and allow it to get hot. When it is, add the vegetables. With the lid open, sear the peppers and tomatillos on both sides. on both sides. Cook for about 5-10 minutes total, depending on how large or hot your fire is. Remove the grill pan and scatter a small handful of your favorite smoking chips (I like alder) over the coals. Replace the pan and close the lid of the barbecue. I know, with the handle of the grill pan sticking out, it won't close all the way. No matter. Close the top and bottom drafts almost all the way. Smoke the vegetables for 5 minutes. When finished, take them inside and allow to cool until you can comfortably handle them. Quarter the tomatillo halves and cut the pepper into 1/4a dice.",

In fact, the label asks, aWhat if wheat wasnaTMt the goal in itself? But a route to something awesomely new?a Excellent question, and it applies to how IaTMve come to think of this chili.",
      "Add the beer to the pot. It will foam up; thataTMs okay. Add the beans. Bring everything to a gentle boil. By now, the wheat berries should be done. Pour them and the stock in which they were cooked into the soup pot. Stir it all together, put a lid on the pot, and simmer for 30 minutes.",
      "While the chili is simmering, whisk as much hot sauce as you need (IaTMm partial to Cholula) into the sour cream. Dice half of an avocado and place it in a mixing bowl. Add the lime juice and toss to blend. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Chop some cilantro.",
      "Give the chili a stir. If it seems too thick (if a spoon can stand upright and salute you), add more stock until it reaches a good chili-like consistency. Season to taste with salt and pepper. To serve, ladle the chile into bowls. Scatter the avocados over each, followed by the cilantro. Drop a dollop of sour cream in the middle. Arrange tortilla chips around the perimeter of the bowl. This is great Sunday dinner fare."

      "Preheat your oven to 350 degrees F. Butter a 9-inch nonstick springform pan. I like to butter even though it's nonstick...I hate sticking. If you don't have a springform pan, don't fret. This will still work in a similar-sized dish. I used a pie dish until I got a springform pan, because I typically don't make cheesecake, and it worked fine. You just don't see that pretty side view of the crust. It's a little easier to cut the springform cheesecake as well (if you're looking for a reason to invest in one).",
      "Put the graham crackers, pecans (you can omit, just add 2 more graham crackers to the mix) and brown sugar in a food processor and pulse until the mixture becomes a fine crumb. Drizzle the butter on top and pulse until just mixed. Press the mixture into the bottom of either the springform or the pie pan. Place the crust in the oven for 10 minutes or until it starts to turn a little golden. Don't walk away and do something else here. It can happen fast and you don't want it to burn. When done, set the crust aside for a bit to cool.",
      "Put the cream cheese and sugar in an electric-stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and beat the cream cheese on low-medium until smooth. A couple of notes here... First, if you don't have an electric-stand mixer you can use your beautiful arms and a spatula to beat it into submission. That's how I did it when I was hanging in the PRC. Second, you don't want to add too much air, at any point, into this creamy mixture we're creating right now. Too much air can make unsightly cracks on your cheesecake. Thus keep it to a low-speed beating as much as possible. I don't want you to panic about this now, because we have the awesome salted caramel to mask any of the above-mentioned fissures. But still, the goal is no cracks.",
      "Once the cream cheese is smooth, add the salt and the five-spice powder while the machine is on low.",
      "Scrape the pumpkin off of the paper towels and in with the cream cheese. Mix until completely combined. Add the eggs, one at a time, making sure they are completely incorporated before you add the next.

      "Lastly, throw in the cream, Satsuma juice and the vanilla. Mix until everything is co-mingled and smooth.",
      "Pour the mixture on to the cooled crust. Place in the oven. Check after 50 minutes. The center will wiggle, but should not be liquid. Cook a little longer if it looks too jiggly. It shouldn't take more than 60 minutes. Cool for a couple of hours at room temperature. When cool to the touch, cover with plastic wrap and place in the fridge.",
      "When ready to make the salted caramel, place the butter and brown sugar in a sauce pan on medium-heat and whisk away until the sugar has melted. Pour in the heavy cream, 1/2 teaspoon of salt and vanilla (save the coarse salt for serving time). Bring to a boil and then reduce to a simmer for 5-ish minutes. Continue to whisk and stir as it cooks. You want the caramel to thicken. Set aside to cool or refrigerate until ready to use.",
      "At dessert time, take the side of the springform pan off...you may need a knife to gently run along the side. If so, do this near the sink so that you can run the knife under hot water periodically so that the cheesecake doesn't stick.",
      "If the caramel was refrigerated, place it in a microwave-safe bowl and microwave until just warmed a bit through. You don't want it too hot and runny. I did it for about 15 seconds in my microwave. Let it cool just a hair (5 minutes). Pour the caramel on top of the cheesecake. It should form a pond in the center, leaving about 2 centimeters around the edges. Voile. If you had any cracks, they are now mysteriously gone. No one will ever know. Sprinkle the 1/2 tablespoon of coarse salt over the top. Done. Pour yourself a mason jar of cognac to go with your slice. You done good."

Scrape the sides of the bowl and beaters with a spatula as needed. Blend in remaining 2 packages of the cheese, one package at a time.

Remove the cake from the water bath and let cool in the pan, on a wire rack, for 2 hours. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until completely cold, preferably overnight or at least 4 hours.\r\nTop the cold cheesecake, still in the pan, with a layer of 12 ladyfingers dipped in the coffee mixture. Transfer the cake to the freezer until completely frozen, 3-4 hours or overnight.",

With the mixer still running, add 2 tablespoons sugar and beat until the stiff peaks form. Do not over mix! Beat in 1 tablespoon vanilla. Gently fold in 8 oz. mascarpone with a rubber spatula.",
      "Remove the cheesecake from the freezer and let it stand at room temperature for about 10 minutes. Spoon the 2/3 of the mascarpone mixture on the top of the cheesecake and even out with a frosting spatula. Since the cheesecake is still very cold, the mascarpone cream will set fast. Release and gently remove the sides of the springform. Spread the remaining mascarpone cream around the sides of the cake.",
      "To decorate, sprinkle with cocoa powder or chocolate curls. Refrigerate at least 2 hours, until the mascarpone layer is cold and cheesecake layer has defrosted. Slice cake with a sharp straight-edge knife cleaning it with a paper towel between each slice. Keep leftover cake covered in a refrigerator for up to one week or freeze for up to one month."

      "Whisk together the flour and baking ammonia in a large bowl then whisk in the sugar. Add the butter in small lumps, half the beaten egg, the sour cream and vanilla extract. Rub the mixture together with your fingertips until large coarse crumbs form. Keep rubbing until they start to lump together into a ball, becoming more damp than floury, gathering the remainder as you go. It will be sticky and streaky; this is fine. Wrap this lump with cling film and leave aside for at least 10 minutes, but up to 30 minutes will be okay.",

      "Tip the sugar into a shallow bowl. Brush the tops and sides of the biscuits with the remaining egg. Take a biscuit and press into the sugar, coating the top and side. Re-arrange back on the tray and continue for the remaining biscuits.",
      "When the oven is hot enough (mine has a light that switches off at the indicated temperature), insert the trays and bake the biscuits for 10 minutes but check after 8 minutes, or until very lightly golden in colour. You may be able to smell faint whiffs of ammonium (this is fine) and the biscuits will expand dramatically. Remove from the oven and let them cool on a wire rack. Turn them over to check if the bases are light golden and firm to touch. These biscuits are inedible under-baked (the smell will linger), but over baked will make them tasteless.

Cut the stems out and remove the seeds, leaving the opening of 1 to 1 1/2 inches. iii) Wash the zucchini and squash. Cut the stems out and carefully hollow out the zucchini from the stalk end by pushing and turning an apple corer (or a knife) into the flesh, until you have a generous cavity. Make sure you do not pierce the bottom of the zucchini. Reserve the zucchini flesh for another purpose. iv) Cut the core out of the cabbage.

About half the mixture should do it so that it will just about cover the tomato tops. Then take the remaining tomato slices and arrange your second tomato layer but again, don't overlap.

Stick the pieche in the middle and it should come out clean. If it doesn't, bake a little longer but watch it.

Bake for 15 to 20 minutes-I find that the darker they are (before being burnt, of course), the more flavorful they'll be! You can choose to baste them with additional oil if you'd like them to be a bit richer. Let the crackers cool completely (they crisp up as they cool), then break them apart into sticks with a spatula, butter knife, or your hands. Snack of them as is or incorporate into mixes, eat them as croutons, etc."

I like to add the figs at this point, because they are so delicate. If you try to toss them in with the pear mixture they would easily fall apart. Slice the figs into 1/4 inch slices and add to the tart in any design to like (I interspersedly wedged them between pear slices). Pleat the dough every 2 inches until all sides are folded and the galette has formed. Pour the remaining juice from the pear mixture bowl over the galette. Place the tart in the fridge for 30 minutes to chill.",

Remove the galette from the fridge, brush with the egg wash and place into the oven for 40-45 minutes, until the filling is bubbling and the crust is golden brown. Let cool at room temperature and serve with whipped cream and/or ice cream. Enjoy!"

Pound it (gently!) with a rolling pin until it all comes together into a thin, pliable block. Don't worry if the butter gets too thin (transluscent) in places; if this happens, gently peel back the plastic wrap, refold the butter onto itself, re-cover it with the wrap, and roll or pound it out with the rolling pin. Repeat as necessary until you have a smooth, pliable block of butter. Roll this block-still between the plastic wrap-to a size of 10 - x 8-inches, about 1/8- to 1/4-inch thick.

Fold the dough again like a letter, wrap it in plastic, and place it in the refrigerator to chill for 30 minutes. Repeat this process (rolling and folding it into a letter) 2 more times. After the final turn, let it rest in the refrigerator at least 3 hours, or overnight.",

On each long piece of dough, make a cut every 3 inches so that you have seven 3- x 5-inch rectangles per long strip (for 14 total). Place a rectangle in front of you horizontally, then push out the rectangle slightly with your fingers. Place a line of chopped chocolate across the width from the top edge to the bottom edge and roughly 1/2 inch away from the left edge. Brush the left edge with your egg wash, then fold it over the line of chocolate to seal it. Place another line of chocolate directly to the right of this roll, then seal it with an egg wash in the same way. The croissant should be rolled like a little scroll. Place the croissant on a parchment-lined sheet tray, making sure the sealed edge is on the bottom. Repeat for each rectangle, leaving 3 inches between each croissant on the baking tray. (You should be able to line up 7 to 8 per tray.)",
      "When you're finished shaping each croissant, cover the entire tray lightly with plastic wrap and and allow to proof in a warm place until they're light and airy, about 20 to 40 minutes. To check if the dough has risen enough, poke one. If it retains its poke indent, it's ready to be baked.",

Bake them for 20 minutes, rotating at 10 minutes, then reduce the heat to 400\u00b0 F and continue baking until the croissants are golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes more. While they bake, remove the almond paste from the refrigerator to bring it to room temperature. At this point, you have completed chocolate croissants. Eat one to celebrate, then make the rest into chocolate-almond croissants. I know the chocolate croissants look good enough to stop here, but you won't regret it, I promise.",

Spread 1 to 2 tablespoons of the almond cream over the bottom half and place the top half back on top. Spread another tablespoon of the almond cream over the top, sprinkle with sliced or slivered almonds, and bake in a 350\u00b0 F oven for 15 minutes, or until the almond mixture has cooked through and is golden brown around the edges. Remove them from the oven, pour yourself a cup of tea, and have one or two. To save some for breakfast, store them in airtight container for up to 3 days.",
      "In a stand mixer with a paddle attachment, mix all the ingredients together on low speed for 1 minute. Scrape down the sides, then mix on high speed until well combined, about 1 additional minute.

      "First, find Asian-style Sesame oil and a bottle of cooking rice wine. Asian-style Sesame oil usually looks dark and has a strong flavor because it is made with black seeds (Semen Sesami Nigrum). Instead of using of sherry wine or Vermouth as in Western-style cooking, people in East Asia use rice wine. Please note that some rice wines contain salt; if you buy a rice wine containing salt, be sure to cut back on the amount of additional salt that you add. My experience is Asian-style Sesame oil can be easily found in most stores. Rice wine is usually only found in Asian markets. If you cannot find the cooking rice wine I use, you can use \"AJI-MIRIN\" which can be easily found in most stores. However, since AJI-MIRIN is a sweet rice wine, the flavor is slightly different and you will have to add salt in your dish and reduce the amount of sweet rice wine you use to prevent it from becoming too sweet. I usually use half traditional rice wine and half AJI-MIRIN and my mom only uses rice wine in her recipe.",

When using cast iron to cook rice, the ratio for Rice :Water should be 1:1, but since the sesame oil and rice wine are still in the pot, we need to subtract them from the amount of water we need to add. For 2 cups of rice, we only need to add 1 and 1/4 cups of water.",
      "Add the 2 cups rice and 1 and 1/4 cups water to the pot and then put chicken (and all the liquid) back top of the rice. Don't stir them -the chicken should be on top of the rice. Cover the pot and use the cast iron to cook the rice as usual ( use medium heat to cook it until you see steam, then reduce to low heat and cook for 20 more minutes)",

Place in oven and roast for 45 minutes. When you remove it from the oven, the cloves should be golden and very soft. Allow to cool slightly and squeeze the garlic cloves out of the peel.\r\n\r\nAdd the roasted garlic cloves, tahini, lemon and yogurt to a food processor. Pulse until combined and creamy. While the machine is running, slowly drizzle in the olive oil. You should have a very thick dressing at this point. Thin slightly with up to 1/4 cup of water. Season with salt and pepper to taste.\r\n\r\nNote: You will get a thicker, creamier dressing if you use a food processor but you can also whisk all of the ingredients together by hand.",

Cook for a couple of minutes on medium-high heat, then remove the springs of rosemary and thyme with a slotted spoon, add 1/2 cup of water, wait till it starts boiling, cover with the lid and turn to low heat.

    "title": "gold nugget bread",
    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "Pour hot water and cold milk into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook. In terms of temperatures, they'll meet in the middle and just right for you to sprinkle in your yeast. Add the honey and whisk to blend. Add the bread flour, salt, flax seeds, polenta, millet, and olive oil. Have to hand a bit of additional flour and water in case you need to adjust the balance a bit. Begin mixing on low speed. When all ingredients come together and you can see that most of the dry ingredients have been hydrated, turn mixer off. Cover bowl with a piece of plastic. Let dough rest (this step is called an autolyse) for 20 minutes. This gives those large particles of whole wheat, flax, polenta and millet time to absorb water and be more readily integrated into the dough. Without this time, you'd be tempted to add more water, and just about the time you realized what a mistake that was, you'd need to add more flour. By that time you'd be wondering who thought this was a good idea in the first place. So. Set a timer for 20 minutes and go do something else. Don't hover.",
      "20 minutes later, remove the plastic and hang onto it. You'll need it again. Turn the mixer on to low speed and watch a miracle happen. Your dough should square its shoulders, straighten its spine, and stand right up around the dough hook with no tendrils left sticking to the sides of the bowl. If it doesn't, add a tablespoon of flour at a time until it does. Have faith; it will. Let it knead for a couple of minutes. Turn off the mixer. Pull off a walnut-size piece of dough. Round it up briefly between your palms. Now begin teasing it out over the tips of your index fingers. You are forming a windowpane - a thin sheet of dough that doesn't shred. It tells you when you have adequately developed the gluten (the protein in flour that lets bread stand up). If your dough tears, throw the ball back into the bowl and knead on low speed for a couple of more minutes, then test for a windowpane again.",
      "Turn dough out of bowl. Oil bowl. Return dough and turn it over bottom to top. Cover with that retained piece of plastic. Let dough rise at room temperature until you can gently press a finger into it, and the dough does not spring back, but retains the indentation. This should take 45 minutes to an hour, depending on how warm your kitchen is.",
      "Gently turn dough out onto your board. Don't punch it down. You carefully measured your ingredients, kneaded up to a good windowpane, and let all that nice carbon dioxide be generated during the first rise. Why would you want to drive it all out and force your dough to create it all over again. It will tougher, and take longer on the second rise. So be gentle. Divide your dough in half. If using bread pans, oil or pan spray them. Sprinkle some flour on your board; as you shape your loaves, turn them over and dip the top in the flour. This will prevent the plastic from sticking to them, and also give them a nicely rustic look when baked. Gently shape your dough and drop in bread pan. Cover with your retained piece of plastic. If shaping hearth loaves, line 2 baking sheets with parchment. Shape your loaves as you wish: long and thin, short and fat, round. Place on parchment And also cover with plastic. Let rise at room temperature until dough retains the gentle imprint of a finger without springing back. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 375 degrees.",
      "Just before moving your bread to the oven, grab a serrated knife and give it 3 or 4 slashes a good half-inch deep, holding your knife at an acute angle. It will look even more beautiful and give your bread a direction in which you want it to expand in the oven. Bake for 40 minutes, but set your timer for 20 minutes. At at the halfway point, rotate your pans or baking sheets. When the time is up, test the center of each loaf with a stemmed thermometer. It should read 185 degrees. If it doesn't, add 5-minute increments until it does.",
      "When done, remove from oven. If you've used bread pans, turn your bread out right away and set loaves on a cooling rack. If you leave it in the pans, the loaves will steam themselves soft and soggy (yuk). If you've shaped hearth loaves, lift them and onto cooling racks.",
      "Wait as long as you can before cutting into a loaf and spreading some good soft cheese or butter onto it. Cool completely before storing or freezing. Admire your golden creation."

      "My adaptations:\r\n\r\nTake one - Rosemary and Ginger-Black Pepper Plum: Replace plain olive oil with rosemary-infused olive oil (recipe follows) and use 1/2 cup plum syrup for flavored liquid (recipe follows; supplement with a little bit of water if necessary), 1/2 tablespoon lemon zest, and 1/4 teaspoon almond extract. Serve with remaining plum compote and vanilla ice cream/yogurt (because YOLO.)\r\n\r\nTake Two: Rose, Honey, and Buckwheat: Reduce all-purpose flour to 2 1/4 cups and add 1/3 cup buckwheat flour. For flavored liquid, replace with 1/3 cup honey and 1 1/2 tablespoons rosewater (or to skip the rose, go with 1/2 cup honey and 2 tablespoons water or juice/tea). Add 1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract, and when baking, keep a close eye, as these bake fastest of the three and can burn easily around muffin edges. Finish with an additional drizzle of honey and crushed rose petals (if you have'em). \r\n\r\nTake Three: Chocolate Sea Salt: Melt 6 ounces of milk or bittersweet chocolate ( I used 64%) with a little bit of olive oil (to keep chocolate sauce loose), and when melted, stir in 1 tablespoon of orange juice. (Alternatively, a 1/3-cup glug of Hershey's Chocolate Sauce would be a-okay in my book!). Use the 1 1/2 tablespoons orange zest, and finish muffins with a drizzle of more chocolate sauce and generous sprinkling of flaky sea salt. \r\n\r\nTo really go all-out, leave any of these variations - or even the original- out overnight to stale and dry out a bit. Slice the muffins in half the next morning, and griddle, cut-size down in a small frying pan in butter until golden brown. Eat out of the pan with a sip of strong coffee while the rest of the morning madness swirls around you.",
      "For the plum compote: Combine all ingredients in a small saucepot and cook over low flame until the plums are soft and syrupy. Do this before starting the batter and allow to cool slightly before using.",

Cook for two minutes, allowing to sizzle slightly, before removing from heat and letting steep (I let mine sit overnight). When using for muffins, I did not strain the rosemary sprigs out, but it is an option that I leave up to you!"

      "Peel and chop the onion and garlic. In a heavy bottomed pan with a lid, pour the oil and add the onions. Cover and place on medium-low heat. You want the onions sweated, not fried. This brings on their natural sweetnes. It'll take about 10 minutes, but be patient and only stir once if you can-if you're worried about sticking, give the pan a shake every now and then. Once the bits of onion are translucent and soft, add a teaspoon of honey, a tablespoon of paprika (I used hot but don't feel compelled to; sweet will do but I do prefer a little bit of heat in this dish) and the garlic. Give the lot one more minute, increasing the heat a bit and leaving the lid off. Then, throw in the beans and about one teaspoon of fresh thyme leaves (yes, you can use dried!). You don't need to cook them, obviously, just heat them through. About...three-four minutes should do it. Take it off the heat, and mash the whole thing up, either by popping it in a food processor (if you want a really smooth mash) or using a normal potato-mash thinggie. I personally prefer the thinggie-method, because this way some of the chickpeas will escape untouched, and I love chickpeas, and also the mash will have a more rustic, chunky texture and look. Season it with salt and pepper, if possible freshly ground. Don't be afraid to season well, beans can be bland and there's nothing worst than bland food. At this point, if the mash looks a bit dry (and it tends to do so normally) add some more extra virgin olive oil, a squeeze of lemon and a few drops of sesame oil. Stir well...ta-daaa. Mash is done. Pretty tast stuff, if I say so myself :)"

Strain the sugar and put it back in the food processor, but save the hibiscus, you will use that later. Along with the sugar, add the flour and the salt, pulse it a few times to combine and add the pieces of cold butter, keep pulsing until it looks a bit like wet sand. Add the yolks (save one egg white) and pulse it until the dough becomes moist enough to hold together (you might wanna add about 1 tablespoon of cold water, if it seems too dry for you). Wrap the dough in some cling film e refrigerate it for a minimum of 3 hours, up to overnight.",
      "Preheat your oven to 205\u00b0C/400\u00b0F. In a small pot, add the dried hibiscus you saved earlier and the 240 ml of hot water, give it a bit of a mix and leave it for about 15 minutes to infuse. Meanwhile, cut out the tops of your strawberries and place them on a baking sheet. Once ready, add about 1/3 of the tea to the strawberries and bake them for around 20 minutes (just take them out a little earlier than your pie crust, since they're both going in the oven at the same time). Leave them to cool.",
      "Once the dough is chilled, place two pieces of cling film, or a piece of parchment paper, on your counter, dust it lightly with flour and roll the dough until it's a little bigger than your pan, about 0.5 cm/2 inches thick. Use the cling film to help you transfer it to a 22 cm/8 inches springform pan, and delicately arrange it inside, leaving sort of a border outside the edges of the pan, this will prevent the dough from shrinking too much in the oven. Don't worry if it tears apart a little bit, just pinch it back together with the scraps. Poke a few holes all over it, using a fork, freeze it for about 10 minutes, then bake it, along with the strawberries, for 25 to 30 minutes, or until it's a bit golden around the edges. Then take that one egg white you saved, brush it all over the crust while it's still hot and put it back in the oven for about 5 minutes (this will ensure a crispy crust after putting the filling). Let it cool slightly.",
      "In a large bowl, pour the condensed milk, yoghurt and orange zest, give it a good whisk to combine and pour it into your slightly cooled tart shell. Bake again for 20 to 25 minutes, or until it's set. If the edges of the tart are getting too brown too soon, just cover it with a bit of aluminum foil. Meanwhile, make the jelly. In a small bowl, add your gelatin and 1 1/2 tablespoons of the hibiscus tea, give it a mix and leave it hydrating for 5 minutes, then place it in the microwave for 10 to 15 seconds (according to the packaging instructions). Add the dissolved gelatin to the remaining hibiscus tea and mix well. Cut the cooled roasted strawberries in half and set them aside.",
      "Once the tart comes out of the oven, leave it to cool for 10 minutes or so, then arrange the strawberry halves on top of it, in whatever pattern you'd like, then, gently, pour the tea mixture on top of it, without disturbing the strawberries. Refrigerate it for a minimum of 8 hours, or overnight, until fully set. Carefully unmold it and serve."

During the rolling, you can incorporate dried spices and herbs, seeds, etc. Slap the dough onto the hot skillet, cook until browned (2 or 3 minutes) and flip. Store uneaten breads in the freezer and reheat on a dry skillet.",
      "Grilled pizza: have all your ingredients to top the pizza ready next to your grill. You'll work over a medium-hot grill (you should be able to keep a hand above the grate for 3-4 seconds). Make sure the grates are nice and clean. Dip the dough in a little olive oil and spread that with your hands as you deftly pull or stretch into a thin crust shape, working swiftly to lay this on the medium-hot grill. Don't try to move the dough for a few minutes. Let it cook and caramelize on the bottom, then it will release. Make sure the top side has a nice olive oil brushing. Flip, then quickly work to top the pizza with your at-hand sauce, cheese and anything that doesn't need through cooking (it won't get it in the grill). Close your grill and cook about 5 minutes (unless you smell burning). You can do these one at a time and re-heat the pizzas at once in the grill when they're all cooked. But if you're grilling, it's probably hot out and you don't need piping-hot pizza!"

This will ensure they are all balanced and seasoned just right. 2) If the kale is a little older or tougher, the earlier you massage in the dressing, the more tender the kale will become. This is a good leaf to take for lunch, as it doesn't become soggy over the day like other salads would. 3) Adding lemon to the apple straight away is important to stop it from oxidizing and turning brown."

I have done both. One where I put the blended stew in a large sort of shallow terrain and I pour the roasted vegetables right in the center so they look sort of like a mountain coming up from the middle and the red beet juices bleed into the soup and as you serve it it makes more and more ribbons even more beautiful the next day... And the I put the garnish of greens beside for each individual to garnish themselves or if I'm feeling micromanagy I'll garnish with the greens myself:) This stew will tantalize your tastebuds with all the sweet of the agave, sour and salty of the umeboshi, and savory creaminess of the pumpkin:) Enjoy every bite!"

      "To grind hazelnuts: Combine frozen hazelnuts with powdered sugar in bowl of food processor. Pulse -- stopping every few seconds -- until the hazelnuts are uniformly and finely ground, about 15 to 20 pulses.",
      "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.",
      "Prepare crust: Put flour, hazelnut - powdered sugar mixture, cocoa and salt in the bowl of a food processor and pulse a few times to combine. Add the butter and pulse until coarsely cut in, about the size of peas -- about 5 to 7 times. Stir the yolk to break it up, pour over the dry ingredients, and pulse (about 5 seconds each time) until the dough starts to clump and come together. If some of the dough is still dry and crumbly, that's okay, since it's a press-in crust. Divide the dough evenly among six 4-inch tart pans (or one 9-inch tart pan), pressing the dough evenly over the bottom and up the sides of the pans. Prick the dough all over with a fork, and freeze for 30 minutes or longer.",
      "Bake crust: Bake for about 25 minutes; the dough should be firm to the touch. Keep a close eye on the crust to make sure it doesn't burn -- you can always lay a sheet of foil across the top if it's browning too quickly. About half-way through the baking time, check the dough to see if it has puffed up; if so, press it down with the back of a spoon so you'll have a deep enough shell for the filling. Remove from the oven, and cool completely.",
      "Prepare filling: In a mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, combine mascarpone, Greek yogurt, powdered sugar, grapefruit zest, and grapefruit juice. Whisk until well combined. Chill until ready to assemble the tarts. (I like to place the filling in the freezer for about 5 to 10 minutes before assembling the tartlets so it's nice and cold.)",
      "Prepare caramel grapefruit sauce: Slice off the top and bottom of grapefruit, then with a curving cut, remove the peel, working in sections. Now the flesh should be completely exposed. Cut away the segments of fruit from the membranes that connect them.\r\n\r\nPlace 1/2 cup water in a small saucepan, and then add the sugar and corn syrup. Cook over medium-high heat until the sugar dissolves. Cook the caramel, swirling the pan occasionally, until it turns a deep amber -- about 7 to 10 minutes. Immediately take the pan off the heat.\r\n\r\nAdd 1/4 cup water to the pan -- stand back, the caramel may splatter! Set the pan over low heat and cook, stirring, until the caramel dissolves and is smooth, about 5 more minutes. \r\n\r\nTurn off the heat. Add the grapefruit segments and a pinch of fleur de sel and gently stir to combine. Let cool a few minutes before assembling tartlets. (The sauce can be prepared in advance and gently reheated before assembling tartlets.)",
      "Assemble the tartlets: Spread the mascarpone filling into the tartlet shells, smoothing the top. Spoon the caramel grapefruit segments over the top, taking care to not shortchange anyone on the caramel sauce."

    "title": "jasper white\u2019s world-famous lobster rolls",
    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "If using live lobsters, prepare to steam them. Note: There are lots of opinions on the most humane way to cook a lobster-choose the method you're most comfortable with. If you'd like to quickly kill the lobsters before cooking, Fine Cooking has a very clear video: https://www.finecooking... Alternatively, you can numb them in the freezer for 20 to 30 minutes (though you may need to add an extra minute of cook time) or stand the lobsters on their heads to calm them, like this: https://food52.com/blog...",
      "To steam the lobsters, fill a large, tall, lidded pot with 1 inch of salt water. If the lobsters do not fit comfortably in the pot and you cannot see the bottom of the pot, it's overcrowded and you should use more than one pot. Set up a steaming rack inside the pot (or improvise one with an upside-down colander)-there should be enough room that the lobsters will be suspended far enough above the water that when they release liquid during steaming, they do not end up sitting in it. Turn the heat to high and cover the pot. The water will boil quickly and fill the pot with steam. When it does, place the lobsters in the pot and cover tightly. 1-pound lobsters should take 10 minutes to cook; add 2 minutes for every additional 1/4 pound. Halfway through steaming, using long tongs, carefully rearrange the lobsters. Work quickly and cover the pot again as soon as possible. When the lobsters have cooked for the recommended time, remove one and break it open where the carapace meets the tail. The tail meat should be creamy white with no translucency. If not, allow the lobsters to steam for a few minutes more.",
      "Let the lobsters cool at room temperature. Use a cleaver to crack and remove the meat from the claws, knuckles, and tails. Remove the cartilage from the claws and the intestine from the tails of the cooked meat and discard. Cut the meat into 1/2-inch dice. You may pick all the meat from the carcass or freeze the carcass for soup or broth.",
      "Place the cucumber in a colander for at least 5 minutes to drain any excess liquid.",
      "Combine the lobster, cucumber, and mayonnaise. If the salad is to be served within the hour, add the scallions. If not, add them 30 minutes before serving. Season with salt if needed and pepper. Cover with plastic wrap and chill for at least 30 minutes before serving.",
      "When ready to serve, preheat a large heavy skillet (12 or 14 inches) over medium low heat. (A black cast-iron pan is perfect.)",
      "Lightly butter both sides of each bun. Place in the pan and cook for about 2 minutes or until golden brown. Turn the buns over and toast the other side. Or toast them under the broiler instead.",
      "When the buns are ready, stuff them with the chilled lobster salad. Place each roll on a small paper or china plate; garnish with pickles and potato chips. Serve at once, while the bun is still warm and salad cold.",
      "To make the mayonnaise by hand (alternatively, these steps can be done in a food processor): Place a stainless-steel mixing bowl on a damp cloth to keep the bowl from sliding around. Add the egg yolk, mustard, and tarragon to the bowl and whisk until blended.",
      "Drizzle the oil into the bowl while whisking constantly. Be sure that the mixture is smooth and well blended at all times. Stop adding the oil periodically to allow yourself time to catch up; when there is no oil visible, continue adding and whisking. When half the oil is added, add 1 teaspoon of lemon juice. Alternate between the remaining oil and lemon juice, whisking all the while, until both are incorporated.",
      "Whisk in the ice water. (The water stabilizes the mayonnaise, which prevents separating, a common flaw of homemade mayonnaise.) Season to taste with salt pepper and cayenne. Whisk. Store in a small container, covered and refrigerated, for up to 3 days. Makes 1 cup."

Put them on a non stick cookie sheet (use parchment paper), with a small brush, brush an egg wash very lightly so the pastry will come out a shiny golden brown.",
      "Bake for about 20 minutes or until the pastry has puffed up really nicely. Please don't overbake!",

You may now sprinkle about 1/3 of the cheese a little at a time and while stirring, allow it to melt into the sauce. Continue to cook for about 2 more minutes and then add the paprika, salt, and pepper. Mix well and then add your seafood and parsley. Taste for flavor. Stirring constantly, continue to cook for another 3 minutes. When finished, turn heat off.",

      "Set the bottom half in the center of each plate and pour a nice ladle of the seafood and sauce, sprinkle a bit of cheese and then cover that with the top half of the pastry shell. You may if you wish, add a bit more sauce over that or around the side. As a finishing touch, sprinkle a little more cheese over the pastry and around the edges of the plate. Serve hot and enjoy!"
