When top starts to look dry, turn crepe using a thin spatula and cook the other side for 20-30 seconds more. Remove the cooked crepe to a plate. Repeat the same process with all the remaining batter. Use some butter to coat the skillet each time. Make sure you don't stack hot crepes on top of each other.",

I would recommend pulsing the mix, not just turning the processor on and leaving it. Add water, 1 tablespoon at a time, pulsing in between until your dough comes together and pulls away from the sides. (You will need to continue pulsing for around 30 seconds after you've added the water.) I needed an additional tablespoon of water this time round, but have needed the listed amount in the past. It really depends! Alternately, you can place all of the crust ingredients except the water, into a large bowl and rub the butter into the flour mix with your fingers until you have breadcrumb consistency. Then add the water, 1 tablespoon at a time, mixing with a wooden spoon in between additions until it starts to come together. Then switch to your hands to bring the dough together fully.",
      "Tip dough into your greased and lined pan and push into a level layer. I find it easier to use my hands to push the pie crust into the pan. Prick the dough all over with a fork and then place a sheet of grease proof paper over the top of it. Tip in some ceramic baking beans, or rice, enough to cover the grease proof paper.",
      "Place crust in the oven for 15-20 minutes, until slightly puffy and the edges are lightly golden. Lightly lift a corner of the grease proof paper to check on the dough. When done, it will be slightly firm to the touch and not shiny and wet looking.",
      "Whilst the crust is baking, make the topping. Place condensed milk, zest, orange juice, sugar, vanilla extract and egg yolks into a large bowl and whisk until combined and smooth. Add the flour and whisk until well combined and there are no lumps. Leave to one side whilst the crust finishes baking.",
      "Once the crust is done, remove crust from oven. Turn the oven down to 350 F and lift out the grease proof paper covered in baking beans. Tip beans into a heat proof bowl to cool. (You might have to spoon a few off the pie crust yourself, because the beans run off everywhere!)",
      "Pour your orange topping all over the pie crust and give the pan a little shake to level the topping. Place in the oven for 17-23 minutes, until lightly golden, slightly darker around the edges, and the middle is set. Wobble it slightly to check. When done, the middle may move ever so slightly, but it should be set. Remove from oven.",
      "Leave to cool in the pan completely, before transferring to a cutting board to slice into 9-12 bars. Bars will keep in an airtight container, in the fridge for 4 days. Best served at room temperature."

      "Preheat oven to 350 F. Grease three 8-inch cake pans, and line bottoms with parchment paper. Set pans aside.",
      "In a large bowl, sift the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Set aside.",
      "Mix milk, melted butter and vanilla in another bowl. Set aside.",
      "Whip the eggs and sugar on medium-high speed in the bowl of a standing mixer until pale and thick. This will take about 5 minutes. Reduce the speed to low and beat in the flour mixture until just incorporated.",
      "Scoop 2 cups of the cake batter and add it into the bowl with the milk and butter mixture. Whisk until well combined. Then pour the mixture back into the remaining cake batter. Fold until well mixed.",
      "Evenly distribute the batter into the prepared cake pans and spread evenly. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes or until a wooden pick inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean. Remove pans from oven. Cool cakes in pans set on a wire rack for about 10 minutes before inverting them out of the pans onto a rack. Let them cool completely before frosting.",
      "To prepare the strawberry compote, cook 1 1/2 cups strawberries, cornstarch, sugar and water in a small saucepan until the berries start to break down, about 10 minutes. Lower the heat and simmer until the compote is thick, about 5 minutes. Remove pan from heat and let berries cool slightly before pushing the compote into a bowl through a fine sieve to remove the seeded pulp. Let compote cool completely. (Discard any solids that remain in the sieve.)",
      "To prepare buttercream, beat butter for a few minutes in the bowl of a standing mixer with the paddle attachment on medium speed. When butter is fluffy, add powdered sugar and turn your mixer on low. Beat until the sugar incorporates with the butter. Add vanilla, heavy cream and strawberry puree. Beat on medium speed for another 3 minutes, or until buttercream becomes light and fluffy. Add 1 or 2 drops of coloring paste and mix until you get to the preferred color.",
      "To assemble the cake, fill a pastry bag attached to a 1/2\" round tip with about 2 cups of buttercream. Place one cake layer on your serving plate and pipe a dam of frosting around the edge of the cake layer. Spoon 4 tablespoons of the compote inside the dam, along with a few of the fresh chopped strawberries and 2 tablespoons of the buttercream. Spread to cover the top of the cake. Then gently spread the buttercream to seal the compote in.",
      "Place another cake layer on top and repeat the same process. Place the last layer of cake on top. Smear a light coating of frosting on the top and sides of the cake.",
      "Transfer the remaining buttercream to a large piping bag fitted with a large petal tip. Holding the piping bag straight with tip pointing at the cake plate and the smaller part of the tip facing outward, pipe from the bottom in a back and forth motion until you reach the top of the cake. Pipe rows of ruffles along the cake edges.",
      "Garnish cake top with fresh strawberries. Cover and refrigerate. Remove from refrigerator an hour before serving."

      "Once cool, using a serrated knife or cake leveling wire, slice the tops off the cake to level, if necessary. Place a small amount of lemon curd into the centre of a plate and then take one cake and place it top side up onto the plate. Place 1/2 cup lemon curd into a small bowl and beat with a spoon until it becomes workable. Spoon onto the top of the cake on the plate and smooth with a small angle spatula until the top of the cake is covered and you have a level layer of curd.",

You will need a large bowl or the bowl of your stand mixer and a large heatproof bowl to make it. Take a piece of kitchen paper towel and dampen with lemon juice. Wipe the insides of the bowls, the whisks and beaters you will use with this damp cloth to get rid of any lingering grease.",
      "Place around 3 inches of water into a medium sized saucepan (check your heatproof bowl fits over the top without touching the water first) and place on a high heat. Bring the water to a boil and then turn heat down to a simmer.",
      "Place egg whites, sugar, water and salt into your heatproof bowl and beat briefly with a hand mixer until combined. Then place the bowl over the simmering pan of water, with a candy thermometer attached and beat continuously until the mixture reaches 160 F. It will be white, glossy and past the puffy cloud stage. This will take 5-10 minutes.",
      "Once the mixture reaches the desired temperature, remove from heat and transfer to a large bowl or the bowl of your stand mixer. Add cream of tartar. Switch to a whisk attachment and whisk continuously until the meringue is thick, glossy and holds its peak when you lift the whisk out. This will take 15-20 minutes. The bowl will also feel cooler to the touch.",
      "Cover the cake with the frosting as you wish, either using a piping or spooning the meringue on. We spooned meringue into the centre of the cake then smoothed it over with an angled spatula, then covered the sides with the spatula too. After this, we used the spatula to repeatedly \"dab\" at the cake to create a stippled effect.",
      "Now you can go to town with a cooks blow torch if you wish! We spun the cake on an icing turntable whilst applying constant heat (around 10cm away from the cake) to lightly brown parts of the cake.",
      "Garnish with lemon peel if desired.",
      "Cake will keep covered, in the fridge for 3 days, but is best served at room temperature."

      "To make the cupcakes:",
      "1. Preheat your oven to 350 degrees and line the muffin tins with paper cupcake liners (the recipe makes 18).",
      "2. In a stand mixer, cream the butter and sugar until pale and fluffy. Add the eggs, one at a time until incorporated, then add the buttermilk, oil, vanilla, and tequila and mix until fully combined.",
      "3. Sift the cake flour, baking soda, and salt together and stir into the batter until just combined.",
      "4. In a separate bowl, toss the strawberries with the flour and lime zest. Add more flour if it's not enough to coat the whole batch. Gently fold the strawberries into the batter.",
      "5. Fill the cupcake liners with the batter, leaving about 1/2 inch from the top. Bake for 18-20 minutes, or until a cake tester (i.e. toothpick) comes out clean. Cool completely.",
      "To make the lime curd:",
      "In a small saucepan whisk together the egg yolks, sugar, lime juice, and butter and cook over moderately low heat. Taste the mixture (if you're comfortable with the raw egg, which I know many people smarter than I are not) and add more sugar if it's not sweet enough (I don't like it too sweet). Stir constantly until the mixture is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, about 5 to 7 minutes (that means when you run your finger along the mixture on the back of the spoon, it should leave a line rather than running back together). Be sure not to let it boil or sit long enough to curdle. Strain curd through a fine mesh strainer and set aside to cool.",
      "To make the buttercream:",
      "1. Set a small pot over medium heat. Add the strawberries, 1/2 cup of sugar, tequila, lime juice, lime zest, and salt and simmer gently until a thickened syrup forms, about 15 minutes. Set aside to cool completely. Once cooled, you can either puree the mixture or leave it in chunks. I left mine chunky.",
      "2. Set a bowl over a pot of gently simmering water. Add the egg whites and the remaining 1/2 cup of sugar and whisk constantly over the heat until the sugar is fully dissolved and the mixture is warm when you stick your finger in it (about 160 degrees).",
      "3. Pour the egg mixture into the bowl of a stand mixer and using the whisk attachment, beat on high speed until stiff peaks form (not too dry though). Test this by removing the whisk attachment, swirling it around the mixture, and pulling it straight up and turning it rightside-up to face you. If they are properly whipped up, a small droopy peak should stick up on the very tip of the whisk.",
      "4. Switch to the paddle attachment on the stand mixer, and beat the butter into the egg mixture on a medium-low speed, a few tablespoons at a time. Make sure the butter is fully incorporated before adding the next batch. If mixture separates after all the butter is mixed in, beat at a medium-high speed for a few minutes until it comes back together. Add the vanilla, beating it at medium-low speed, then turn the speed all the way down to low and mix for a couple of minutes to remove any extra air.",
      "5. Gently fold in the strawberry jam mixture with a rubber spatula and stir until the buttercream is smooth.",
      "To assemble the cupcakes:",
      "1. Using a pairing knife inserted at an angle, cut out a small cone-shaped chunk, about a 1 inch circle from the top of each cupcake. Fill the hole with the lime curd, about 1 teaspoon worth. You can either replace the chunk you removed, or eat it!",
      "2. Fill a pastry bag (or Ziplock with the bottom corner cut off) with the frosting and go to town on your cupcakes. Or, you know, just use a spatula."

      "6) Spoon batter into prepared liners. Bake for 18-22 minutes, until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.",
      "For the buttercream:",
      "1) Combine the sugar, egg whites, cream of tartar and water in the stainless steel bowl of an electric mixer. Bring a large pan of water to simmer, making sure that the water is at the same height as the egg whites in your stainless bowl. We're looking for a double boiler setup. Set the bowl of sugar/egg mixture into the pan of simmering water and whisk constantly until the mixture reaches 140 degrees on an instant-read thermometer. Be careful to not curdle the egg whites- simply remove the bowl from the heat for a bit if it feels like that's happening. You'll know when it's getting close to 140 degrees; the mixture will be getting ultra foamy, like the top of a latte.",
      "2) Remove the bowl with the egg white mixture to your stand mixer and beat on high speed for 3-5 minutes, until the mixture holds glossy, marshmallowy peaks. Remove the meringue to another bowl.",
      "3) In the standing mixer, beat half of the butter and one-third of the meringue until well combined. Continue to add the remaining two-thirds of the meringue a dollop at a time. The mixture may look a bit curdled at this point - but don't worry; adding the remaining butter a tablespoon at a time will smooth things out. Keep adding a bit of butter at a time until the curdling corrects itself.",
      "4) With the mixer on low, add the lime zest and lime juice and mix until well combined. Begin to pour in powdered sugar in small increments and beat until the frosting reaches the desired consistency and sweetness.",
      "5) Then pipe or frost onto your cooled cupcakes. And devour!"

      "1. In a small bowl, combine the strawberries and 2 tablespoons granulated sugar. (This is separate from the 2 cups needed for the cookies themselves.) Stir until strawberries are well coated and set aside. Let the mixture sit for at least an hour, at room temperature, until strawberries have produced an obvious amount of syrupy liquid.",
      "2. While you wait, preheat oven to 375 F. In a large bowl, cream butter and remaining 2 cups of sugar. Add eggs, one at a time, stirring until fully incorporated. Add vanilla and salt and mix well. In a separate bowl, combine flour and baking soda. Add this into the butter mixture and stir to combine.",
      "3. Roll dough into golf ball-sized balls and place on an un-greased baking sheet, two inches apart. Bake 15-17 minutes, until cookies are set but not brown. You should get about twenty 4\" cookies from one batch of dough.",
      "4. While cookies cool, make the glaze. Put the powdered sugar in a medium sized bowl. Strain the liquid from the strawberries and add the liquid into the powdered sugar, along with the lemon juice and corn syrup. Stir until glaze is smooth and lump-free. The glaze should be thick but pourable. Mash about 1/4 cup of the strawberries and stir into the glaze. If mixture is too thick, or if the glaze starts to dry as you cover the cookies, add a tiny bit of water to thin.",
      "5. Spread the glaze over just the tops of the completely cooled cookies. Set on a wire cooling rack, arranged on top of a sheet tray to catch the drips. Allow glaze to dry and harden completely before serving. Cookies will be best a few hours after serving, but will keep well for a few days if stored in an airtight container."

Remove the syrup from the heat and set aside while beating the egg whites. Using a stand mixer with the whisk attachment, beat the egg whites with the cream of tartar and salt until soft peaks form. While the mixer is running, slowly pour the hot sugar syrup in, avoiding the beaters, and add the vanilla. Continue to beat the whites until the meringue has cooled and become very thick and shiny.",
      "Scoop the meringue on top of the chilled pie, making sure to bring it to the edges and cover the brownie base. Use a rubber spatula to make swirls and peaks all over the meringue. Bake for 6 minutes until the peaks are golden brown. Remove from oven. Allow to cool in the pan on a wire rack at room temperature. The pie is best served the same day.",

      "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Butter the bottom of an 8-inch round cake pan. Cut out a piece of parchment paper to fit the bottom of the cake pan perfectly. Place the parchment paper in the bottom of the pan and smother that with butter, too.",
      "Sprinkle a little bit of flour in the buttered and parchment-papered pan. Shake it all around and make sure that you cover the entire bottom and sides with a light dusting of flour. Tap out any excess. Now set this aside. We'll use it later, obviously.",
      "In a medium bowl, sift together flour and baking powder. Set aside.",
      "In your stand mixer, beat butter and 1/2 cup of sugar on high speed until light and fluffy. Now it's time to add the eggs. Add one whole egg and beat well. Add another whole egg and beat again. Now add one egg yolk and beat. And finally, add another egg yolk and beat. Add vanilla and mix well.",
      "At this point, we are ready to add our wet and dry ingredients alternately, beginning and ending with the dry ingredients, with the mixer at a low speed. Add some of the flour mixture first, and then some of the whole milk. Add some more of the flour mixture, then the wet again, and finally end with the flour mixture. Continue mixing until everything is just combined.",
      "Don't be alarmed! The batter is quite thick. It's supposed to be this way. Now pour it in your prepared pan. Spread the batter around in the pan so it's all lovely and even. Put that bad boy in your preheated oven and bake for 30 to 35 minutes. Or, until you poke a toothpick in the middle and it comes out clean.",
      "Cool the cake.",
      "Place sliced strawberries in a bowl and mix with 1/4 cup of sugar. Put the bowl aside and let the sugar do its magic and turn the strawberries into syrupy strawberry goodness.",
      "Place 2 tablespoons of cold water in a small saucepan. Sprinkle with 1 teaspoon of Knox gelatin powder. Let it soften up for a minute or two, and then place the saucepan over very, very low heat and stir until gelatin is dissolved. Remove from heat and let cool. Immediately, start whipping up some heavy cream. Slowly add the remaining 1/4 cup of sugar. Keep whipping until very soft peaks form. By this time, the gelatin will have cooled. Add the dissolved gelatin mixture (it should look like thick water) to the whipped cream and continue whipping until soft peaks form.",
      "Cut the cooled cake in half horizontally with a serrated knife. Place the cake, cut side up, on a pretty cake stand. Cover the cake with half of the strawberry syrupy goodness. Place a huge dollop of whipped cream on top of the strawberries. Leave about an inch around the edges. Place the top of the cake, cut side down, on top of the whipped cream and press gently. Top with the remaining half of the whipped cream.",
      "We're not quite done yet. No siree. Now cover the cake and place that bad boy in the fridge for a few hours. The gelatin allows the whipped cream to stay all dense-like, and not get watery and flop down. The refrigeration time allows all the layers of the cake to meld together and become all merry-like.",
      "After a few hours (or up to 24 hours), remove your cake from the fridge and top with the remaining strawberry syrupy goodness, right before you serve. See how the fridge time allows it to become all mellow and merry and droop a little, but in a good way?",
      "Slice and serve.",

You may need more or less time depending on the placement of your oven racks-mine was just in the middle. Immediately scrape the toasted marshmallows into the mixer and beat until fluffy.

Again, stir occasionally. In the last 30 - 60 seconds, add in the garlic, dried thyme, dried basil and red pepper flakes.",

Pour the batter into the middle of the hot pan, then gently roll the pan to let the batter completely coat the bottom while holding it just above the heat. Once the pan is coated, put the pan back on the heat and let the crepe cook and bubble for about 2 minutes, then carefully flip it and allow it to cook for another 2 minutes on the other side. Transfer it to a plate and repeat with the rest of the batter to get 4 crepes total.",

Add the assembled, folded crepes to the pan and let them gently sear for about 30 seconds on one side, then carefully flip them to heat up on the second side.

Turn the heat to medium and let the strawberries cook until they are broken down and a red syrup bubbles around the berries (about 5 minutes). Mash the berries with a fork to form a chunky puree. Set this mixture to the side in a small bowl and wipe out the saucepan you used.",
      "Next, heat the cream in the same saucepan until warm but not boiling. Meanwhile, beat together in a medium bowl the egg yolks, vanilla and remaining 1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons of sugar. At first this mixture will clump together, but keep beating air into it and it will turn into a pale yellow creamy sauce. When the cream is warm, pour it very slowly into the beaten egg yolks while whisking constantly. Once all the cream is incorporated, whisk in the milk very well. Pour this entire mixture back into the saucepan, adding the sliced banana and nutmeg. Cook over medium low heat, stirring occasionally, until a thick custard forms that coats the back of a metal spoon. You will also know when it's done if you drag your finger through the custard on the spoon and the line does not break. For me, this takes a good 5 minutes.",
      "Once thickened, place a strainer over a large glass bowl and pour the custard through. Discard the banana slices. Stir in the strawberry puree and lemon juice, and then cover the bowl with plastic wrap and thoroughly chill before adding it to your ice cream maker. I recommend at least 6 hours, but overnight works best for me. Churn the mixture in your ice cream maker for 15-20 minutes. Scrape it into a bowl that you can store in your freezer for 2-3 days."

Drizzle about 1/4 of the hot milk into the egg mixture, whisking constantly to warm the eggs slowly. Slowly add the rest of the milk in a steady stream, whisking constantly. Be careful not to let the eggs curdle.",
      "Place the saucepan with the egg and milk mixture over medium heat and bring the mixture to a boil, whisking constantly. Allow the mixture to boil, still whisking, for 1 minute and then remove from heat. The mixture should be thick and creamy.",
      "Whisk in the vanilla extract and then let stand for 5 minutes. Whisk in the butter, stirring constantly until the butter is incorporated. Transfer the custard to a bowl and cover it with plastic wrap, allowing the plastic wrap to touch the surface of the custard so a skin doesn't form on the top. Refrigerate until cold throughout, at least 1 hour but preferably overnight.",
      "To assemble the pie, layer the bananas and then the strawberries along the bottom of the graham cracker pie crust. Mash the leftover banana slices and stir into the custard. Pour the custard into the pie shell and smooth. Cover with plastic wrap and place in the refrigerator.",
      "To make the whipped topping, beat the whipping cream until it starts to thicken. Add powdered sugar and vanilla extract and continue to beat until stiff peaks form. Store in the refrigerator if not serving immediately.",
      "When ready to serve the pie, spread the whipped topping on the pie and top with any leftover sliced strawberries. Serve pie immediately or refrigerate. Pie will last 2-3 days.",
      "Note: this makes more whipped topping than you will need for the pie, but you can always use it as a topping for fruit, ice cream, pastries, etc. or store in the freezer for use later.",

      "Note: bananas that are very ripe are best for this. More ripe = more sweet. If you're on a time crunch and you can't wait a week for your bananas to turn brown, you can speed up the process by putting a couple of whole bananas in a bag with some apple slices and sealing it up overnight. By the next morning, your bananas will be browning and sweet!",
      "First, mash up the bananas and preheat your oven to 350 degrees.",

      "Next, add the remaining ingredients: flour, oats, baking soda, salt.",
      "Stir until just BARELY combined. You just want everything moistened. It's okay if there are a few dry looking spots. This will give you soft, fluffy muffins. Over-mixing makes your muffins dense and tough. Which is only good if you intend to use them as projectiles.",
      "Line a 12-cup muffin pan with cupcake wrappers. Fill each cup all the way to the top with your mixture. This will give you puffy muffintops. On your muffins. Not your pants.",

Once cool enough to handle, rub them together in a clean kitchen towel to remove the skins. Place in your food processor and grind to a medium fine meal. Set aside.",
      "2) In a stand mixer, cream your butter and sugar with the paddle. Sift together the flour, cinnamon and baking powder. Add in your ground hazelnuts. Stir to combine.",
      "3) Add eggs, one at a time to the butter/sugar mixture, scraping down the bowl between additions until well combined. Stir in the vanilla extract. Add the dry ingredients, 1/2 at a time, until just combined. Pat the finished dough into a disk (or two) and wrap tightly in plastic wrap. Store in the refrigerator at least 2 hours before using or overnight (ideal). Any extra dough can be frozen for up to 3 months.",
      "To assemble and finish the cookies:",
      "1) Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment. On a well floured board, working in batches, roll out your dough to 1/8\" thick. Use a 3\" heart shaped cutter to cut out the bottoms of the cookies. Use a 2\" fluted heart shaped cutter to cut out the windows in the tops of the cookies. Make sure that you cut out equal quantities of cookie tops and cookie bottoms.",
      "2) Place the cookie cutouts on your lined baking sheets and refrigerate the dough until chilled, about 15 minutes. Bake the chilled dough until just golden, about 12-15 minutes, taking care not to overbake.",
      "3) While the cookies are cooling, heat the raspberry jam & 2 teaspoons of sugar in the microwave. The jam should come to a full boil. Remove it and give it a quick stir. Sandwich the pairs of cookie tops and bottoms together. Pour the hot jam into a piping bag and flood the window of the cookies with the hot jam. Yes, it's hot and yes, it burns your hands while piping. Alternately, you can spoon the jam into each window, taking care not to get any on the sides of the cookies.",
      "4) Once the cookies are sandwiched together and filled with jam, and while the jam is still warm (that part is important!), sift the powdered sugar over the top of the cookies. If the jam is still warm, it will melt the powdered sugar and leave you with a clear, red raspberry window and will adhere to the outside of the cookies only.",
      "Let the jam and cookies cool completely and enjoy! These can be stored in airtight bags up to 3 days."

      "Turn the dough out onto a floured board and knead, adding as little flour as possible, until smooth and elastic, about 5-8 minutes. The dough will still be slightly sticky.",
      "Place the dough in a greased bowl, then turn the dough to grease the top. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a linen towel and allow the dough to rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour.

I then use the pizza chopper (or my chef's knife) to cut straight down through the bottom layer of dough. Don't drag the knife-that distorts each slice. Cutting straight down with a slight rocking motion gives the dough a nice clean cut.",

Immediately upon removing the pan of rolls from the oven, I like to brush each of them with a little melted butter. This gives them a nice shine and keeps the rolls soft.

I place the rolls on a baking sheet, cover it with foil and place the pan in the freezer for about 45-60 minutes. When the rolls are almost frozen through, I wrap each one in aluminum foil, place them in a resealable bag and pop them back in the freezer.",

Add the citrus peel strips, reduce the heat to a simmer and cook until the syrup has dissolved, stirring regularly. When it is close to done, a white sugary coating will appear on the peel.",
      "When the syrup has completely dissolved, remove the pan from the heat and dump the contents on a wire rack to cool, spreading it out as much as possible. Let it cool. As they harden, you will want to separate them several times to keep from developing large clumps of peel.",

      "1. I like to start with peel that has already been scraped and cut into strips. When I eat a piece of fruit I remove the pith right away and cut in into strips. Then it goes into the freezer until I get enough to make a batch.",
      "2. The peel is easiest to scrape when it is in larger sections. I always cut my fruit instead of peeling by hand. Oranges get cut into 4 sections and grapefruit in half to eat, and then into fourths to remove the pith. The peel will lay flatter on the cutting board and be easier to manage at this size.",
      "3. You want to use a knife with a long, thin blade that is comfortable in your hand to prevent hand fatigue and soreness.",

      "5. Dissolving the syrup can be a long process. It usually takes about 2 1/2 hours for the sides of the pan and the peel to start to develop its sugary coating.",
      "6. Put a cookie sheet or cutting mat underneath the wire rack when the peel is cooling. Stuff is going to fall through and this makes for easier clean up.",

      "6. Add crushed tomatoes and cooked sausage to pot and stir to combine, being sure to scrape up any browned bits from the bottom of the pot. Bring mixture to a simmer, taste, and add seasoning as necessary. Don't be afraid of salt-it helps cut the flavor of the tomato and brings all the flavors together!",

      "9. Cover pot and place in a 375 F oven for 10-12 minutes to cook the eggs. I like my eggs a tad on the runny side, but if you want yours more well-done add another 4-5 minutes to the cook time!",

When the dough has chilled and rested, turn it out onto a clean, floured surface. Roll it into a big circle about 1/4 an inch thick with a floured rolling pin. Gently roll the disc of dough around the rolling pin, pick it up, then roll it out over the tart pan.",

Then line the tart shell with aluminum foil and fill the foil with dry beans or pie weights to keep it from puffing up and help it retain its shape. Put the tart pan on a cookie sheet to stabilize it and make it easier to maneuver in and out of the oven. Blind bake the tart shell for 30 minutes, then take it out of the oven and remove the foil and beans. Brush the tart shell with the reserved egg white, then put it back in the oven for 8 minutes. Then take it out of the oven and set aside to cool. Reduce the oven heat to 325 F.",

Take it out of the oven and let it cool for 10 minutes. Then set it on top of a big can and release the outer ridged part of the tart pan by gently nudging it down. Gently slide the tart off of the bottom of the pan onto a tart plate and refrigerate it for at least 2 hours to let it completely set.",

      "4. In a large saucepan, bring the butter and the water just to a boil, stirring once or twice while waiting for this to happen.",

      "6. Pour the cake batter into the prepared pan, smooth the top, and bake for 15-20 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake emerges with moist crumbs clinging to it. Be careful not to over-bake this cake. You want the aforementioned moist crumbs-not wet batter, but not a totally clean pick, either.",
      "7. While your cake is baking, make the icing by melting the white sugar, butter, and milk in a medium-sized saucepan over medium heat. Bring the mixture to a boil, stirring constantly, then reduce the heat to medium-low and cook while stirring until the sugar is dissolved. Remove from heat and let it cool for 2-5 minutes while the cake finishes baking. If the icing base mixture starts to set before your cake comes out of the oven, put it back over medium heat and resume your stirring just long enough to liquefy it again.",
      "8. When your cake is done, remove it from the oven, poke the entire surface with a fork, and set it on top of the stove or on a wire rack while you finish off your icing. Add the confectioners' sugar and coconut extract into the cooked sugar mixture and beat with a wooden spoon until smooth. If the icing looks too thick to pour easily, add a little more milk, a few drops at a time, until you have a manageable but not runny consistency.",
      "9. Immediately pour the warm icing over your fork-poked cake and spread it evenly from edge to edge. Without delay, sprinkle the entire surface generously with flaked coconut.",
      "10. Enjoy warm or at room temperature. If you have any to store, be sure to cover your pan tightly with plastic wrap or foil so it doesn't dry out. Eating the entire cake the day it's made also solves this problem nicely."

Place in the refrigerator and allow to set for 30 minutes.",

Add pulsed strawberries, Greek yogurt and half of the powdered sugar. Beat until well combined. Add in remaining powdered sugar and again beat until combined. Add whipped cream and gently fold it in with a spoon until combined.",

Bake for about 9-11 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a cake comes out clean. Remove pans from oven and allow cakes to sit on the pan for a few minutes before moving them to a wire rack to completely cool.",

      "* Note regarding storage (if you aren't going to serve them immediately): Cakes should be stored in a covered container at room temperature in a cool, dry spot. Lemon cream and berries should be stored separately in covered containers and refrigerated. Frost cakes immediately before serving."
