    "ingredients": [],

      "Warm your olive oil (or bacon fat... or both together) slowly in your biggest skillet over medium heat. Add the diced onions and a big pinch of salt and let them cook, slowly, stirring occasionally, until really very soft and beginning to caramelize. This should take at least 25 minutes. If you have the time, let it take an hour over very low heat.",
      "While the onions cook, rinse and chiffonade your chard. No need to stem the chard, just cut off any grungy ends and slice the stems more closely than the leaves. When you've finished cutting, gather up the whole heap of ribbons and splash them down into a big bowl of cold water. Swirl them about to get off any remaining sand and let them sit until the onions are candy-sweet and very soft.",
      "Once the onions are done, turn up the heat. Then, moving quickly, gather up the greens and carry them, dripping all over your kitchen floor, to the pan. They should sizzle and spit as the water hits the fat. This is OK. Just be careful as you use tongs to carefully turn the whole mess, over and over, until every bit is covered in oil. The water will be steaming and should help wilt the whole giant pile down into something more manageable fairly quickly. Once it's all reduced to a soggy pile, turn the heat down to low and keep turning until the greens are very dark. I can't give you a specific time, I'm afraid, it's very variable. But if it's not dark and tender in about ten minutes, turn up the heat a bit. The whole skillet will fill with a deep red liquid as the chard cooks -- my grandmother used to call this \"pot liquor\" and it's very good.",
      "Using a garlic press, add as much garlic as you like. I've never found an upper limit for this recipe. A whole head is perfectly reasonable. Stir it in -- it will float in the liquid at the bottom. Let it simmer for about a minute, then add a generous splash of vinegar -- any sort will work here, but I favor cider vinegar in the fall and winter, red wine vinegar in the summer, and chive blossom vinegar in the spring. Taste and season with salt.",
      "OPTIONAL: To make this a one-skillet meal, create several divots in the greens and crack fresh eggs into them. Clamp your lid on and let the eggs poach in the pot liquor for 2-5 minutes, depending on your personal attitudes towards eggs. Served with whole-wheat toast, this is my 8 year old's favorite meal.",
      "If you're not going to add eggs, taste again and see if it needs more oil. It might. It needs a lot of oil You can also top with crumbled sausage or bacon, cooked crispy and diced."

The butter will melt, then simmer, then brown bits will start to appear. After the bottom of the pot seems to have a fair amount of browned bits, remove it from the heat. Browned butter goes from browned to burned (blackened bits instead of browned bits) in an instant, so be very careful. It should have a nutty, toasty aroma.",
      "Place the fruit in the pot with the butter and put it back on low heat. Stir frequently for about 10 minutes. The fruit should cook slightly but still maintain a bite/crunch. Strain the butter and liquids from the fruit and let the relish cool completely.",
      "Now for the latkes: Since we're only grating 2 potatoes here, I like to just use a box grater (the side with the large holes) for both the potatoes and onion. If more than doubling this recipe, I would use a food processor.",
      "If you're serving the latkes today, turn on your oven's warming drawer or your oven to 250\u00b0F to keep them warm after they are done cooking. I prefer to make mine in advance and freeze them.",
      "Place 1/3 of the grated potato in a cheese cloth or a clean, thin dish towel and squeeze very tightly to remove all liquid from the potatoes. Do this three times until liquid from all the potatoes is removed. Place potatoes into a large mixing bowl. Add the grated onion with liquids. Now add in the mochi flour, eggs and salt. Stir well to combine. You'll want to work quickly here so the potatoes don't oxidize and discolor too much.",
      "Heat a heavy-bottomed pan (I use a large stainless steel pan) with vegetable oil to about a 1/2\" depth over medium heat. Test to see if the oil is ready by putting a little potato grating into the pan. If it immediately bubbles, its ready. It should take about 10 minutes for your oil to heat. Keep a careful eye on it while it's heating up because you don't want it to be too hot or your latkes will burn. Conversely, if you start cooking your latkes before the oil is hot enough, they will end up greasy on the inside and give you a stomach ache!",

      "Add the latkes one at a time in the hot oil. Be careful not to overcrowd them. I cooked five at a time, max.",
      "The latkes are ready to eat when they are cool to the touch but still warm inside. Top with creme fraiche, then fruit relish, then a light sprinkling of cinnamon.",
      "If you are freezing your latkes, preheat your oven to 425\u00b0F an hour before you plan to serve them. Bake them for 10-15 minutes. If possible, bake them on a wire rack on top of a cookie sheet. This will help air circulate all around, ensuring they will be crispy on both sides. Cool on paper towels for about 5-10 minutes and garnish as indicated above."

Cook the beef and the pork, stirring it, for another 10-15 minutes after that you have added it all, so that it is all broken up and it is not pink anymore.",

If not, you can take them all out or do a mix of both.

      "Prepare fennel by removing greens and stem base and outer layers if they are bruised. Roughly chop and place in a bowl of cool water. Agitate the fennel and make sure any dirt hiding inside the layers of the fennel has been washed away. Rinse and strain.",

For a finer texture, use a mortar and pestle and grind the sage. Add the fine sage to the soup. Stir and let soup set for 15 minutes over very low heat.",

In the bowl of a KitchenAid or electric mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, beat eggs and 3/4 cup sugar until very thick, pale, and fluffy, about 5 to 7 minutes. Add almond extract. Sift flour, cornstarch, salt, and baking powder over bowl (or sift into a separate bowl first) and fold in with a spatula. Fold in the melted butter and stir just to combine.

Stir in the powdered sugar and knead for a few minutes on a clean surface, adding more powdered sugar if it sticks, adding a few drops of water if it's too dry, until smooth and pliable. Knead in red food coloring drop by drop until you have your desired shade of pink. Dust two small pieces of parchment or waxed paper with powdered sugar and one by one, place the balls of fondant between the sheets of greaseproof paper and flatten each ball out with your fingers, to a thin circle, approximately 2 cm/1 in in diameter, to form the petals. Roll the first petal up to form a center bud and wrap the remaining petals around the bud to make a rose. Leave to dry at room temperature for at least an hour.",

Divide the jam evenly between the first two layers, spreading a thin layer over the top. \r\n\r\nNext, add the remaining 2 tablespoons of sugar to the whipped cream and beat until it holds stiff peaks. Fold half of the whipped cream into the pastry cream, reserving the other half. Evenly divide the pastry-whipped cream mixture between the first two layers, spreading it carefully over the thin jam layer.",

Add two dots of green gel food coloring and knead until the color is uniform. If you like, add another dot or two of food coloring until it reaches a light lime color. Place the marzipan between two sheets of waxed paper and roll into a 16-inch diameter circle, large enough to generously cover the cake.",

Trim the edges and tuck them neatly under the cake. Fill a pastry bag fitted with a small star tip with the reserved cup of whipped cream, and pipe a row of stars around the edge of the cake to hide any imperfections.",

Make a skinny-tipped cone with parchment paper and fill it with the melted chocolate, then snip off the tip to create a makeshift pastry bag. Carefully pipe the chocolate over the top of the cake in a swirl or curlicue. Top with the pink rose in the center."

In a large bowl, with an electric beater, cream together the butter and the granulated and brown sugars until fluffy and light. Beat in the eggs, one at a time, until incorporated. Add the mashed banana, banana liqueur (or vanilla extract), and sour cream. Beat at low speed until combined. Drizzle in the walnut oil and beat until the mixture is smooth and the oil is absorbed.",

Before the flour is entirely incorporated, switch to a large spatula and gently stir in the walnuts. Scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl to mix in all the dry ingredients, then transfer the batter to the prepared loaf pan. Smooth the surface of the batter and place the pan in the oven.",
      "Bake the banana loaf for about 60 minutes, or until handsomely golden brown and firm to the touch. A tester inserted into the middle of the loaf should come out clean. If you find the bread browning too quickly, drape a sheet of foil over the top of the loaf. You don't want the edges to burn.",
      "When done, remove to a rack to cool, in the pan, for 15 minutes. Then turn the loaf out onto the rack and cool completely before cutting and serving. Store, tightly wrapped, at room temperature for up to 4 or 5 days. In fact, if you can wait, let the loaf rest overnight before serving."

You want the butter to just start to break up and incorporate into the flour. Add the cold water and mix for 15 seconds. At this point the \"dough\" will look shaggy, crumbly and quite dry. (If you don't have a stand mixer, you can do this by hand. Rub the cold pieces of butter between your thumb and forefinger to partially flatten it. This helps to encourage the butter layers.)",
      "Roughly shape the mess of \"dough\" into a rectangle. Fold the right third of the dough over to the center. Now fold the remaining left third over the center (kind of like you're folding a letter), so that you have a stack of three layers. Rotate the dough 90\u00b0. This was your first turn. (A bench scraper comes in handy during this process. The dough will likely fall apart at some point during the first 3 turns; when it does, simply use your hands to press the dough back together.)",
      "Using the palm of your hands, push the dough back into a flattened rectangle and repeat the process 2 more times for a total of 3 turns. If at any point the butter gets soft or the dough becomes too difficult to work with, just place it in the fridge to rest for at least 30 minutes.",
      "After 3 turns, wrap with plastic wrap, then let rest in the fridge for at least 30 minutes or up to 1 hour. If time is an issue, you can leave the dough overnight, well wrapped in the refrigerator-just let it rest on the counter for 10 minutes to remove the chill from the butter slightly before starting the turning process again.",
      "Once the dough has rested, the water will have hydrated much of the flour and it should resemble a dough. Continue with 3 more turns, this time using a rolling pin. Let the dough rest again in the refrigerator for 30 minutes. At this point, your dough is ready to use!",

Bake the cold dough in a hot oven (400\u00b0 F) for the first 15 to 20 minutes, then turn down the oven to 350\u00b0 F and continue to bake until the dough is set, about 15 to 20 minutes more.

Working quickly, spread 1/2 the meringue on the frozen loaf, making sure to cover it completely and seal the edges. Return it to the freezer and repeat with the second loaf. (The baked Alaskas can be made up to this point a day ahead. Keep frozen until ready to serve.)",

      "Note: In order to make individual baked Alaskas like shown in the pictures double the brownie and meringue recipes. Use 2.5-3 inch dessert rings to cut out circles in the brownie. Leave the brownie in the dessert ring and fill to the top with the raspberry filling. Once frozen remove the rings and carefully coat each dessert with the meringue. Makes approximately 12 (depending on the size of the dessert rings)."

      "Test your pasta dough. It should feel smooth in texture and soft to the touch when squeezed. You can sheet your pasta according to your preferred method. Hand rolling is fine, but can be harder to achieve uniformly thin results. I use my KitchenAid pasta rolling attachment. If you're doing the same, or using a hand cranked countertop roller, divide your dough into fist sized balls and shape them into rectangles. Feed one through the roller at the lowest setting, then again at 2, again at 3, and finally, again at 4.",
      "Again, use whatever method you're most comfortable with to form the ravioli. I prefer a ravioli press or a cutout rolling pin. If using a press, lay one sheet of pasta over the press and spoon filling into each ravioli divot. Brush around the filling with water. Lay the second sheet of pasta on top and firmly push a rolling pin over all the edges until the excess dough can be pulled away, allowing you pop out your formed ravioli. If using a rolling pin, spread some of your filling evenly across the surface of one sheet of pasta, leaving a half inch around all edges. Lay the second sheet on top and roll over the pasta with your cutout pin. Use a pastry scraper to cut out square ravioli, or use a pasta cutter with fluted edges for a fancier finish. As you finish each round of ravioli, store them on a lightly floured baking sheet.",
      "Bring a large (4-6 qt) pot of water to a rapid boil. Salt the water generously. Boil your ravioli to al dente. The cooking time will vary depending on how thin you rolled your dough as well as how large the ravioli are. Drain and transfer to a lightly oiled mixing bowl.",
      "If you're only cooking for one, feel free to freeze unused ravioli at this point. Once frozen, they can be reheated when needed. They are also much easier to bread once frozen, and can be refrozen after breading for fried ravioli.",
      "Pick a sautee pan that is appropriately sized for the number of portions you will be serving. Melt 2 T butter per serving over medium-high heat. Once the butter stops foaming, swirl the pan frequently over the heat until the color darkens and the aroma turns nutty. Throw a couple sage leaves per person into the butter and allow to fry for a few seconds, until the edges crisp. Pour the butter and sage leaves over the ravioli and toss to coat. Plate your ravioli, making sure each gets a couple of sage leaves. Using a vegetable peeler, scrape curls of parmesan off the block and mound at the center of each plate of ravioli."

      "Slice two bananas into small disks. Place in a freezer-safe container or a Ziploc freezer bag and freeze for at least 7 hours.",
      "In a mini food processor, blend your nuts, salt, cinnamon, and coconut (if using) until the nuts are in little bits. Set aside.",
      "Place frozen banana into your mini food processor (using a regular size food processor won't work unless you increase the number of bananas you are using). Holding on to the food processor firmly (its gonna get reeeeally shaky) turn it on and watch the magic!",
      "The banana will go through several stages: First crumbly, then thickish, then it will start to look like a whipped soft serve ice cream texture.",
      "Once the bananas get to be thickish, you will probably have to turn off (and unplug) your machine and mix the banana by hand to rearrange it in the mixer so that the blades can dig into the banana. Then continue to mix.",
      "Once the bananas have turned into \"ice cream\" (Whoa-A!), add in the nut mixture you made earlier.",
      "Blend again until all of the nuts are well incorporated. Turn the machine on and off in short bursts. Don't over mix or your \"ice cream\" will start to get very soft.",
      "Either eat immediately OR place in a freezer safe glass container or loaf pan and seal tightly with plastic wrap and/or place the whole container into a Ziploc freezer bag. The longer you leave it in the freezer, the harder it will get. I like it after an hour. If you let it set overnight it will be really hard. Leave it on the counter for a short while and it will soften up.",
      "To make the whipped cream, stir the vanilla into your thick Greek yogurt. This is not going to be a traditional sweet whipped cream, but it is the perfect pairing with the sweet banana.",
      "For toppings I used fresh picked strawberries and grated a bar of 86% Ghiradelli chocolate with a microplane."

Evenly spread the crumbs on top of the fruit. You may need to use your fingers to break up the crumbs a bit. If the crust has gotten soft or warm, put the whole pie into the freezer until the crust is firm and cold.",

      "Directions for the Panna Cotta:\r\nPrepare the second portion of gelatin with 1 tablespoon gelatin, and 1 cup of water using the same method as for the raspberry Jell-O.\r\n\tIn a medium bowl whisk sour cream with 1 cup of sugar, worm the mixture by lowering it to a large bowl with hot water; add the gelatin; wormed and dissolved to a clear stage.\r\nStir until homogenized, and divide in 2 equal portions.\r\n\tIn to 1 portion stir in lemon juice and lemon zest. \r\n\tTo the second portion stir in Instant Espresso powder and 1 tablespoon of coffee liquor (Kahlua) and vanilla extract.\r\n\tGet out the glasses with raspberry Jell-O from refrigerator, and pour the Espresso-sour cream mixture on top. Return to refrigerator to solidify.\r\n\tIn about 2 hours pour the lemon mixture on top of the Espresso one, return to refrigerator, and chill until ready to serve. I put also a few fresh raspberries in between layers.\r\n\tGarnish with fresh raspberries, and large curls of shaved chocolate."

Then stir the mushroom cooking liquid in to the gravy slowly. Now you should have a pretty thick, dark brown paste. Next, add warm water from the tap little by little, whisking all the way, until you have a gravy texture. It should taste amazing too!

      "Bring a pot of heavily salted water to a boil. Blanch your Brussels sprouts for 30 seconds, drain, and dry thoroughly.",
      "The key to getting a good char on your Brussels sprouts is making sure they don't crowd. If you're working with a large pan (e.g. a 10-inch cast iron skillet), cook them all at once. If your pan is smaller, fry in two batches. Heat oil over medium to medium-high heat. Add one sprout, cut-side down; if it begins to sizzle immediately, add the rest. You want most of them to land cut-side down, but don't drive yourself crazy.",
      "Let your sprouts cook, untouched, for a minute or so, and then check them. If they're white or light brown on the bottom, let them cook a bit more. You want to wait to flip them until they are charred and almost black. Once they are, flip to the other side, and wait for side two to cook until crispy. Add salt, toss a few times, then move them all to the edge of the pan.",
      "Add your onion (or half of the onion, if you're working in batches) to the pan. If it looks very dry, add a touch more oil. If you're worried about them burning, turn the heat down a bit. Let them cook for a minute or two, stirring lightly, until they soften slightly.",
      "Toss onions and sprouts together; let them cook for 30 more seconds. Add a squeeze of lemon juice, allow everything to steam for a moment, and then you're done! Taste for salt. Fry your second batch now, if it's still waiting for you.",

      "To toast hazelnuts: Place hazelnuts in single layer on rimmed cookie sheet. Toast for 8 to 10 minutes in a 350 degree F oven, shaking the pan once or twice to ensure even browning. Once cooled, put toasted hazelnuts in the freezer for 15 minutes or longer.",
      "To grind hazelnuts: Combine frozen hazelnuts with powdered sugar in bowl of food processor. Pulse -- stopping every few seconds -- until the hazelnuts are uniformly and finely ground, about 15 to 20 pulses.",
      "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.",
      "Prepare tart crust: Put flour, hazelnut/powdered sugar mixture, salt, and grapefruit zest in the bowl of a food processor and pulse a few times to combine. Add the butter and pulse until the butter is coarsely cut in, about the size of peas -- about 5 to 7 times. Stir the yolk to break it up, pour over the dry ingredients, and pulse (about 5 seconds each time) until the dough starts to clump and come together. If some of the dough is still dry and crumbly, that's okay, since it's a press-in crust. Put the dough into a 9-inch tart pan, pressing the dough evenly over the bottom and up the sides of the pan. Prick the dough all over with a fork, and freeze for 30 minutes or longer.",
      "Bake the tart crust: Bake the crust for about 25 to 30 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown. Keep a close eye on the crust to make sure it doesn't burn -- you can always lay a sheet of foil across the top if it's browning too quickly. About half-way through the baking time, check the dough to see if it has puffed up; if so, press it down with the back of a spoon so you'll have a deep enough shell for the filling. Remove from oven, and cool completely.",
      "Prepare grapefruit: Slice off the top and bottom, then with a curving cut, remove the peel, working in sections. Slice the grapefruit into 1/4-inch rounds and remove seeds. Dry the grapefruit rounds between several layers of paper towels -- blotting the fruit to remove excess moisture -- for at least 30 minutes but preferably longer.",
      "Prepare hazelnut cream: Put the butter and sugar in a mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and combine until the mixture is smooth. Add the hazelnut/powdered sugar mixture, flour, and grapefruit zest, and mix -- then add the egg and vanilla. (You can also do this step by hand with a rubber spatula.) Mix until well combined -- about 15 to 20 seconds.",
      "Prepare chocolate: Melt, using either double-boiler or microwave; stir until smooth.",
      "Assemble tart: Spread the melted chocolate in an even layer over bottom of tart shell. Freeze the tart shell for about 15 minutes until the chocolate has fully solidified. Next, pour the hazelnut cream over the chocolate layer, smoothing the top. Arrange grapefruit rounds over the top.",
      "Bake the tart: Bake for 50 to 60 minutes, or until the cream has turned golden brown. A knife slipped into the center of the cream should come out clean when it's done. Remove from oven and cool completely.",
      "Glaze the tart: Right before serving, heat the marmalade and 1 teaspoon water for about one minute in microwave, or until bubbling. Brush the glaze over the entire surface of the tart."

      "Divide the broiled mango between four serving dishes (or martini glasses, if you'd like to be fancy). Drizzle each with a spoonful of the champagne reduction (not too much - it packs a punch). Top each with a dollop of whipped cream and then a small spoonful of the cookie butter. To finish, drizzle a bit more champagne reduction over the top.",
      "Pulverize the cookies in a food processor until powdery and no large chunks remain. Sprinkle the cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, sugar and salt into the crumbled cookies and pulse several times to combine.",
      "Add the coconut oil. Note: you want the coconut oil liquified - if it is solid, warm it in the microwave for a few seconds at a time until it liquifies. Make sure it is not hot though when you add it to the cookie crumbs.\r\n\r\nPulse until the coconut oil is incorporated into the cookie crumbs. It should look like wet sand at this point.",
      "Remove the mixture from the food processor into a mixing bowl. Gently stir in the milk, one tablespoon at a time (don't do this step in the food processor - over processing can turn the mixture clumpy and gummy.) \r\n\r\nThe \"butter\" will look and feel like a very dense nut butter and it will hold together - wont be crumbly - this is what you want.",
      "Cover and leave at room temperature if you will be using shortly. If you make the day before, cover and refridgerate. It will harden up in the fridge, so allow it time to come to room temperature before using.\r\n\r\nNote: this recipe makes more than you need for the mango dessert, but in my opinion, that's great news for my breakfast toast! To store the leftovers, do as mentioned above - store in fridge and allow to warm up before using."

If at any point the cabbage looks dry or it looks like the bottom may burn, add a tablespoon of water to moisten. When cabbage is fully cooked, taste and adjust for salt, pepper, and vinegar.

When rice is hot to the touch, add 1 tablespoon red wine vinegar and 1 ladle of stock. Lower heat to medium-low and cook, stirring continuously, until stock evaporates. Add more stock and continue stirring. As you continue adding stock and stirring, the rice will emit some of its starch, which will thicken the risotto and make it silky. Around 10 minutes into cooking, add two ladles of cabbage. Stir to incorporate and continue stirring and adding stock as before. At around 13 minutes, begin tasting the risotto; adjust seasoning and add more cabbage if desired. Continue cooking, adding stock as necessary, until rice is done but ever so slightly al dente. Add some or all of remaining tablespoon red wine vinegar to add slight tang. Off the heat, add butter and parmesan cheese. Stir to incorporate and serve immediately."

      "Zabaglione: Place a pot with about an inch of water in it (or use a double boiler) on the stove over medium low heat. Place your bowl over your pot and cook the egg mixture over low heat, stirring constantly for 8 minutes. Using a rubber spatula and moving the thickness of the mixture from the bottom and sides, you will notice that at the 5 minute mark it will instantly change texture, going from a thin liquid to a much thicker custard that is suddenly slightly smaller in quantity. At 7 minutes you can turn off the heat and stir for a few more strokes. Let this mixture cool to room temperature. Cover and refrigerate at least 4 hours or overnight, until thoroughly chilled.",
      "Light whipped cream: Beat the light cream with 1 tablespoon of sugar until foamy and blended. Fold in the light cream into your mascarpone; the mixture should be smooth and light.",

      "Mix together the hot espresso with sugar and hazelnut liquor in a wide, shallow dish.",
      "Line an 8?x8? pan with saran wrap, getting the plastic squarely into the corners so your tiramisu can layer evenly. Saran lining makes it easier to take the tiramisu out and cut and serve individual servings. If you don't care about serving them individually feel free to skip over this step.",
      "Working quickly, dip the ladyfingers one at a time into your warm coffee. Nota bene- The key here is to dip them long enough to get them moistened but not so long as to get them soaked where they start disintegrating. If the coffee is hot or warm, this shouldn't take long. Depending on the thickness of your ladyfingers, you should start getting a feel for how long you need to soak yours. Soak the bottom layer for 3-4 seconds so that the mascarpone sticks to the fingers, but still take care to avoid disintegrating them. Soak the in-between layers for 1-3 seconds so they can retain a spongy instead of soggy texture in your assembled tiramisu. (If you've tasted a soggy tiramisu, you'll be familiar with the taste of mush and alcohol, which is what we're trying to avoid here.)",
      "Immediately start placing each ladyfinger side by side in a single row in your pan. You can also break a lady finger into pieces when necessary, to ensure the base of your dish is completely covered. Once your fingers are moistened, it will be easier to squeeze in 1 more than might fit if they were placed dry into the bottom layer.",
      "Spoon one-third of the cream mixture on top of the ladyfingers, then use a rubber spatula or frosting knife to spread the filling evenly, all the way to the edges.",
      "Repeat to create 2 more layers, ending with the mascarpone filling. In the 2nd and 3rd layers of ladyfingers, space them out further from one another. When you cut into a square piece, you'll see lovely diagonal layers of mascarpone. That comes from spacing the fingers out, which also keeps the tiramisu from becoming ladyfinger heavy....unless you like that!",
      "Cover the pan with plastic wrap and refrigerate the tiramisu overnight. If you assemble your tiramisu in the morning, it will be ready to serve the same evening (just let it come to room temperature for about 10 minutes before serving it so the flavors open up.) You can also freeze it to serve much later. I also find that cutting it when it's still slightly frozen produces cleaner cuts. Decorate with cocoa powder, chocolate shavings, and hazelnuts."

Stir occasionally to make sure the water hasn't boiled off; also, the lentils will sink and stick to the bottom as they break down, and the stirring prevents this tendency. If you find the lentils have not broken down and the water has evaporated off, add water. If you find it too soupy, turn up the heat slightly to evaporate the extra liquid and keep the lid askew as the ingredients boil down, stirring more often.",

Add the mustard and cumin seeds, the salt, and peppercorns, and stir, letting them heat until you hear the mustard seeds pop, and then add the chili peppers, turning each over after about a minute, so the skin darkens on each side.\r\nCarefully pour this mixture into the dal, as the oil might splatter. Stir together and the dal is done. If you like your food spicier, cook the spices in oil longer, and leave the chili peppers in the dal: after a couple of trial runs, you'll know how to adjust this step. Lastly, depending upon your preference for flavors, stir in 1-2 T lemon juice, at end."

    "title": "cranberry brie puff pastries",
    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "To make the cranberry jam, combine cranberries, sugar, lime zest, lime juice, salt, and cinnamon in a small pot over medium-high heat. (I know, it seemed crazy to me that there was so little liquid. But it's magic.) Stir the mixture continuously as it heats; after a few minutes, the sugar will become liquid, and after a few more, the cranberries will begin to pop.",
      "When the mixture is fully liquid, turn the heat down to low and let it simmer for around ten to fifteen more minutes. A few minutes before removing from the heat, you can add a sprinkle of cornstarch to aid in setting the jam, but it's not really necessary. (I also didn't find the need to create a slurry beforehand.) Pour into a clean jar and let cool before chilling in the refrigerator.",
      "To make the pastry, first whisk together flour, salt, and sugar in a large bowl. Add the butter pieces and mix again briefly, just to distribute throughout. Next, add 6 tablespoons water (best to try to sprinkle it over the entire mixture) and mix with a fork just until the dough comes together, as gently as possible. It's fine and preferable to keep chunks of butter intact - it will add to the flakiness. If you're seeing a lot of loose flour after mixing for awhile, add a little more water, one tablespoon at a time. (KAF also recommends spritzing with a water spray bottle if you have one.) But work with it a little and see if it doesn't come together first.",
      "When it's holding together, turn the mixture out onto a work surface and shape into a rectangle about the size of a piece of paper, with the short side facing you. Fold dough into thirds like a letter - bottom third up, then top third over the bottom third. Rotate the dough, so that the short side faces you again, and fold into a letter again. Lightly flour the surface as necessary, then rotate to the short side one more time and fold again. Wrap with plastic and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.",
      "After the dough has rested, fold into letters three more times, wrap, and refrigerate for at least one more hour. After this, you're ready to roll the dough out and cut it into rounds for use. I divided the dough into two balls and rolled each into squares that were about 12\" to 16\" across. Using a cookie cutter, biscuit cutter, or just a regular drinking glass, cut the dough into circles. My batch yielded about 48 rounds. The dough will likely have softened by this point - I placed them in a single layer onto saran wrap, place another piece of saran wrap over that, and refrigerated them again until firm.",
      "Finally, preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Whisk the egg yolk and a splash of water together to make the egg wash. For each puff, lay out one round and brush it with egg wash - this will help seal the puff shut. Place a slice of brie and a dollop of cranberry jam on the bottom round. Take another round and stretch it a bit between your fingers (it needs to be a bit bigger to fit over the filling) and place it on top. Crimp the edges shut with the tines of a fork, brush egg wash over the top, and prick the puff in the center to ventilate.",
      "Place the sealed rounds on a parchment-lined baking sheet - they can be as close together as you like, since they will not spread (just puff!) Bake at 375 degrees for 12-14 minutes or until golden brown on top. Let cool slightly, and serve! They're delicious warm or room temperature."

      "At this point, your pasta should be almost done and nearly ready to drain. Taste to make sure it is al dente. Add the crab to the thickening cream sauce, stir to combine. The goal is to heat the crab thoroughly without overcooking it, about 1-2 minutes.",

      "Salsa:\r\n Soak the corn, still inside of the husk, for about 30 minutes in a bowl full of water. After the corn has soaked, over a medium-high heat, place corn husks directly on grill. The corn will take longer to cook than the poblanos, about 20 minutes. When the corn husks are dried out starting to burn, remove them from the grill and once they've cooled, peel back the husks. At this point they should be steamed through, but for an extra char you can season with salt, pepper, and rub a little oil over them and place it back on the grill for a few minutes, turning occasionally. Using a sharp knife, slice the corn kernels off the cob lengthwise and place into a bowl.\r\nPoblanos: Place the Poblanos directly on the gill next to the corn. Let the poblanos start to roast and blacken, checking and turning every few minutes. Remove the poblanos to a cutting board once they are blackened all the way around and let it cool. Once they've cooled, you can start to peel off the blackened skin from the flesh and scrape off the seeds with a small knife. After fully removing the outer skin and seeds, chop the poblanos and add it to the bowl with the corn. Also add the chopped jalapenos, cilantro and garlic.\r\nIn a separate, small bowl, whisk together the juice of one lime, honey and the oil. Once the vinaigrette is emulsified, pour all but a few spoonfuls over the bowl of corn and poblanos. Mix the salsa together and set aside to serve. The reserved lime vinaigrette will be used to spoon over the romaine.",
      "Goose:\r\nOnce all your prep work for the salsa is done and set aside, mix the Spice mix and rub it into the goose breasts. If you chose to dry-brine your birds like I do overnight with salt, you will not need to add extra salt to the spice mix. If you did not dry brine the bird, than you should add one teaspoon of salt. If you have the skin on, or a particularly fatty bird, score the skin to allow fat to seep out. If you have a lean, skinless bird, than I like to rub a tiny bit of grapeseed/canola oil over the meat and then season with the spice rub.\r\nGrill the goose over high heat on each side for approximately 2-4 minutes each side. Your cook time will depend greatly on the size of the bird, I like all of my waterfowl to be between rare and medium rare. Remove and let it rest under foil for 10 minutes to soak up juices, keeping in mind that it will continue to cook a little under the foil. Thinly slice the goose breast for serving.",

Slice one onion. Pile slices in the middle of a large cast iron skillet, place the chicken on top, and sprinkle the chicken generously with kosher salt. Add a half glass of water. Roast for 30 minutes.",

Stir together in a small bowl a couple pinches of dried thyme, a good dash of ground allspice and a tiny pinch of cinnamon (the latter is optional - if you're not crazy about cinnamon, use cumin instead), and a heaping tablespoon of sumac. Grind some black pepper over it.",
      "After 30 minutes of roasting, lift the chicken, and pull the cooked onion slices out to the edge of the skillet. Throw into the center of the pan the sliced onion and garlic, preserved lemon, bay leaves, and the herb and spice blend, and give it all a good stir. Pour a glass of dry white wine over the chicken and roast for another 30 - 45 minutes depending on the size of the bird. Tent with foil midway through this period if the skin is darkening too much.

Pour it off into a Mason jar and refrigerate or freeze (wide-mouth jar only, leaving plenty of room at the top if freezing) to put in your next pot of soup or to flavor your next pilaf, or, use less - just enough to get the last of the luscious, flavorful bits -- drizzle on an omelet or frittata. Simply delicious. ;o)",
      "Variation 1: Sausage and herbs: Pile the onion slices in the middle of the pan; sprinkle on 1 tablespoon each of fresh marjoram and fresh thyme leaves, or a couple good pinches of dried, and 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg; sit the chicken on top; surround the bird with 2 or 3 brats, depending on their size. After 30 minutes, remove the sausages, and slice; pull the onions out to the side of the skillet, and pile the sausage slices on top. Continue as above. Add a teaspoon or two of stoneground or Dijon mustard to the sauce, if the spirit moves you. Remove the sausage slices before making the sauce and serve on the side.",

      "Variation 2. Celery stalks cut at an angle into 2\" lengths and added after the first 30-minute roasting period. Use the same herbs, but not the nutmeg. Remove the celery with the sausage slices when making the sauce.",
      "Variation 3. Fennel, sliced, and added after the first 30-minute roasting period, with thyme and parsley only. Add bay leaves and a teaspoon of well-crushed fennel with the onions. Remove the fennel slices before making the sauce. Chop any fennel fronds and add immediately before serving.",
      "Variation 4. Artichoke hearts (marinated, drained well), oregano, marjoram, parsley, all added after the first 30 minute roasting period; pile on top of the onion slices around the outside of the chicken. Remove the artichoke hearts and sausage before making the pan sauce.",
      "Variation 5. Mustard and rosemary: Chop a tablespoon or 2 of fresh rosemary leaves with a pinch of salt. Sprinkle on the onion slices after putting them in the skillet. Add a splash of soy sauce and a good-sized dollop of mustard to the pan when making the pan sauce. Add extra wine, stock or water if the mustard makes the sauce too thick; cook it down for at least a minute at a gentle simmer, if you add wine.",
      "If you're worried about pouring wine into your cast iron skillet, don't be. We don't add it until the pan has a fair bit of chicken fat and juices released by the onions, and we don't pour much in at a time. Your skillet and the sauce will both be just fine. ;o)"

But I've made them before swapping out some of the seeds for spices (fennel seeds, mustard seeds, cumin seeds, nigella seeds, etc.) and with different ratios of seeds. Just pull out a 2-cup measuring cup and fill it with whatever seeds you like. Keep in mind that spices should be used in moderation since they're so strong (maybe 1-3 tablespoons total). Other than that, the sky's the limit.",

If using a food processor, dump the contents into a bowl at this point. Stir the vanilla into the sour cream. Using a spoon, and then your hands when needed, knead the sour cream and vanilla into the flour mixture until it is well incorporated, and the dough holds together when you squeeze it. Stop as soon as this is possible -- do not over-mix. Shape the dough into four chubby disks, cover with plastic and allow to relax in the refrigerator for at least one hour (overnight is fine too).",

This dough is much softer than a traditional pastry crust, so you shouldn't need to let it warm up before rolling. Spread 1/3 cup apricot jam over the round of dough, and sprinkle with 1/3 cup nuts and 1 Tbsp cinnamon-sugar. Taking a chef's knife or pizza cutter, divide the dough evenly into 16 wedges. Starting from the wide base of each wedge, roll towards the center to form a crescent. Place on a cookie sheet lined with parchment or silicone liner, making sure that the tip of the crescent is pinned underneath to prevent the cookie from unrolling. Bake until the filling is bubbling and the crust is just beginning to color, about 30 minutes. Remove to a rack to cool, being careful of the hot jam. Best enjoyed the day they are made (any leftovers are best kept in the freezer)."

Sprinkle with half the sliced fresh berries.",

Sprinkle with the quartered strawberries and the cookie crumbs you reserved for garnish. (You may have a bit of the strawberry spread left over at this point; if so, store in a jar in the fridge up to 4 days. It's great as a jam or atop pancakes).",
      "At this point, you may serve the cake immediately, or store, covered, in the refrigerator for 6-24 hours. Serve cold, from the fridge. Makes 8-10 stupendous servings. It doesn't keep well, so should be made for an occasion with 8-10 eaters, if possible. . . the cake will absorb moisture from the spread and will seem more like a trifle by day two (not that there's anything wrong with that. . . . )."

      "UPDATE 2013/11/04: Forgot to mention that the persimmon should be the soft/mushy type (aka KAKI) , not the hard/crunchy type (aka FUYU). When using persimmons, you have to make sure it is completely ripen before consumption or it will present a bitter and unpleasant taste.",
      "Peel and remove the cores from the apples, then cut into smaller-than-bite-size cubes. Add the apples, unsalted butter, sugar, lemon juice, ground cinnamon, ground allspice and grated nutmeg in a skillet. Cook over medium-heat while stirring occasionally, until the apples are soft and the sauce is very thick, sticky and dark brown, approx 5 minutes. Meanwhile, remove the flesh from the persimmons and discard the skin. It can be a little tricky to do so with ripen persimmons and sometimes you have to \"squeeze\" the flesh off from the skin. You'll need 2 ~ 3 persimmons to get 185 grams/6.5 oz of flesh. Smash the persimmon flesh with a fork and set aside.",
      "Once the apples are ready, remove the skillet away from the heat and add the persimmons. Stir to mix up all the ingredients evenly, which at this point should be quite runny and \"saucy\". The persimmons should give out some juices and cool down the apple considerably. Add the cornstarch and vanilla extract, and mix until there's no visible clumps of cornstarch. Return the skillet back to medium-heat and cook until the mixture has thicken up completely. Continue to cook for 2 more minutes to reduce it even further. Transfer the fillings into a bowl and chill in the freezer for 1 ~ 2 hours until borderline frozen.",
      "MAKE THE PIE CRUST: In a food-processor (or you can do this inside a large bowl with a pastry blender), mix together all-purpose flour, baking powder and salt. Add the cubes of very very cold unsalted butter, then pulse until the mixture resembles a very COARSE meal, with the largest bit of butter about the size of a large pea. Add 4 tbsp of iced apple juice and pulse 2 ~ 3 times to incorporate, then another 4 tbsp and pulse 2 ~ 3 times again. Check the consistency of the dough by pinching a piece of it together and see if it stick easily. You'll most likely need to add another 2 tbsp of iced apple juice to bring the dough together. Now transfer the dough onto a working surface and knead JUST A COUPLE OF TIMES to bring it into a big ball.\r\n\r\nPress the dough into a flat disk, wrap with plastic wrap and chill in the fridge for at least 1 hour before using.",
      "MAKE THE PIES: Lightly dust the surface with flour and roll the pie dough out into a thin sheet, NO THICKER than 1/8? (3 mm). Use a round pastry-cutter (about 3 1/2? in diameter) to cut out as many wrapper as you can. Gather the scraps, roll it out again into a thin sheet and again, cut as many wrappers out as possible. You should get about 16 ~ 18 wrappers out of this dough. Take the filling out of the freezer, which should be relatively hardened but workable. Place about 2 tsp of fillings in the center of a wrapper (don't even think about stuffing more than 2 tsp... or good luck with closing that one), dab a little water on the edge then close the wrapper and pinch the seams together FIRMLY with your fingers. Use a fork to make DEEP impressions along the seam/edge to make sure it is securely closed. Repeat with the rest.",
      "If at any given point the fillings start to thaw and soften, return both the wrappers and the fillings back to the freezer for 15 min to firm up. Once you are done with making all the pies, keep them in one single layer on a sheet pan and keep in the fridge until needed.",
      "FRY THE PIES: Evenly mix 1/3 cup of sugar, 1/2 tsp of ground cinnamon and 1/2 tsp of ground cardamon in a large bowl then set aside.",
      "Add enough canola oil in any frying-pot until you have about 1 1/2? (4 cm) deep of oil. Heat the oil over medium-heat until when a wooden chopstick is inserted in, the oil bubbles up along the surface of the chopstick (supposedly the oil should reach 365\u00b0F/185\u00b0C, but I never measured). Without crowding the pot, slowly lower 2 ~ 3 pies into the oil to fry (keep the rest of the pies IN THE FRIDGE). Turning them occasionally until they are golden browned and crispy on both sides. Drain through a slotted spoon for a few seconds then roll them in the spiced sugar.\r\n\r\nRepeat with the rest.",
      "It would be tempting to eat them immediately but I warn you, it's piping hot inside. Wait a few minutes... if you can."

This way, when you open the sheet of aluminum foil and put it on top of the tart, the pastry is covered but not the filling.\r\nBake for 5 minutes on the top shelf of the oven, being careful so it doesn't burn.\r\nThen, place it on the bottom shelf, or on the bottom of the oven, for another 5 minutes, being careful so the base of the tart doesn't burn.\r\nRemove and let it cool on a wire rack.

Cut the chicken into 8 to 12 roughly equal-sized pieces. (Alternatively, you can kindly ask your butcher to do this-it does save a lot of cleanup.) Add those pieces plus the neck to the biggest pot you've got.",
      "Slowly pour the water on top of the chicken in the pot. (Doing this too quickly can cause a raw-chicken splash zone-not what we want.) Set the pot on the stove, partially cover with a lid (so there's a slight crack for steam to escape), and turn up the heat to high, until the liquid reaches a confident simmer. Adjust the heat as needed to simmer the chicken for about 25 minutes, or until the meat is cooked through. (Some scrum might rise to the top at this point. Just remove with a spoon and discard.)",
      "When the chicken has cooked, turn off the heat. Use metal tongs to remove all the pieces from the pot and set on a plate or platter. When it's cool enough to handle, use your hands to pull the meat from the bones. (No need to shred into bite-sized pieces now-we can do that later.) When all the meat has been removed, add all the bones and skin back to the pot of water.",
      "With the pot partially covered, simmer the stock for 3 to 4 hours, until golden and reduced to 8 cups of liquid or so. Check every so often to make sure it's simmering; depending on your stove, it may fluctuate from not simmering at all to downright boiling (neither of which is the goal), so adjust the heat as needed.",
      "When the stock is ready, carefully pour through a fine-mesh sieve into a big heatproof bowl, pot, or other vessel that can hold about 8 cups of liquid. Really press on those bones to get all liquid and flavor out of them. Let cool to room temperature, then refrigerate until completely chilled.",
      "When it's completely chilled, there should be a layer of fat on top (good!) and the stock's consistency should be ultra-gelatinous, like jelly (great!). Use a spoon to gingerly transfer the fat to a separate jar. You can refrigerate this fat for up to 5 days or freeze for months.",
      "When you're ready to eat soup: Set a large pot of water over high heat to come to a boil. When it does, generously salt (I estimate about 1 tablespoon salt per quart water), and add the egg noodles. Cook for about 5 minutes or until just al dente, since they'll continue to cook in the hot broth.",
      "While the water is coming to a boil, heat the stock over medium-high heat. And while the stock is heating up, shred the chicken. For the full amount of stock (8ish cups), you'll want about 1 pound of shredded chicken (for 4 bowls of soup). Psst: This means you'll probably have some leftover chicken; save for chicken-salad sandwiches later on!",
      "When the broth is hot, season it: Add 2 teaspoons kosher salt, stir. Add 1 tablespoon chicken fat, stir. Taste. At this point, I personally added another 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1 tablespoon chicken fat; maybe you will, maybe you won't. Just keeping tasting and seasoning, tasting and seasoning, until you love it. Yay!",

Rye dough will swell, and it may not seem as obvious a change in the first couple of hours.",
      "When the dough is almost ready, prepare two 9x4x4 loaf pans. Cut parchment paper to fit into the bottom of the pans, and oil the sides.",
      "Sprinkle the counter generously with rye flour. Turn dough out into the counter. You should see that the underside of the dough has lots of little holes from bubbles that formed during the rise, and the dough should smell pleasantly tangy and fruity.",
      "Using a pastry scraper or knife, split the dough into two equal portions. Use your hands to quickly shape each portion of dough to fit into the prepared loaf pans. Working quickly helps with sticky dough, but you can wet or oil your hands to decrease sticking.",
      "Spray the tops of the loaves with oil, or use your fingertips or a brush to lightly oil the tops of the loaves. Gently pat the dough so it fills the corners and smooth the top. The dough should fill the pans about 2/3 of the way.",
      "Cover pans in plastic wrap or foil, and place in the refrigerator overnight. You can also let the pans rest for another two hours at room temperature to rise a little after you shape the loaves, and bake on Day 2. However, having tried both ways, I find the last cold fermentation adds a lot of flavor.",
      "DAY 3\r\nTake pans out of the fridge, and let sit at room temperature for 3-4 hours to take off the chill. The dough will have risen a little more, and the pans will be about 3/4 full. The bread will not rise any more during baking.",
      "Preheat oven to 350F.",
      "Place loaf pans in the oven, uncovered, and bake until the inside reaches 200 F. This takes about 1 1/2 hours, but check the temperature after one hour. The bread will be a rich brown on top, and start to pull away from the sides of the pans.",
      "Once baked, turn the loaf pans upside down on a cooling rack. The bread should fall out easily, and sound hollow when tapped. Peel off the parchment paper if it stuck to the bottom of the loaves, turn right side up, and let cool completely before slicing. Ideally, the bread should sit at room temperature overnight before slicing. The bread can be stored at room temperature for a few days, and 1-2 weeks in the refrigerator, loosely wrapped."

Add the garlic to the curly kale and whiz until very finely chopped. Transfer to a large bowl.",
      "To the curly kale and garlic, add the onion, turkey, breadcrumbs, ricotta, 1/4 cup Pecorino, 1/4 cup vegetable or chicken broth, olive oil, thyme, nutmeg, salt, and pepper. Using clean hands, gently tossed until just combined. You are essentially making turkey, ricotta, and kale meatballs with which to stuff the Cavolo Nero leaves, so keep the mixture only lightly mixed to ensure it stays tender.",
      "Lightly grease a 9\" x 13\" baking dish with olive oil, and spread one small ladle of tomato sauce on the bottom. Cut out the toughest end of the stem out of each Cavolo Nero leaf. Then, as though you were making a burrito, or stuffed cabbage, add about 1/4 cup of the turkey filling in an oblong shape down the center of each leaf, leaving enough leaf around the edge to wrap the filling in. Place each stuffed leaf seam-side-down in the baking dish. Repeat until all leaves are filled. If you have any filling left, you can roll it into little meatballs and either bake them along with the Cavolo Nero packages, or bake them on a rimmed baking sheet at 350 degrees F for 30 minutes. If you have any Cavolo Nero leaves left, slice them and scatter them over the kale parcels.",

Top with extra stems of thyme (optional), the remaining 1/4 cup grated Pecorino, and a light drizzle of olive oil. Cover with foil, and bake for 30 minutes. Then uncover the baking dish, and broil just until the corners of the Cavolo Nero leaves char and the Pecorino turns slightly golden. Serve immediately."

Place fitted lid on & pulse until it all comes together & forms a sticky crumble. Take a fitted squarish plate with sides up or oven dish & smear it in with vegan butter. Now, line your baking paper all in it so that you can easily remove the bars later on, to cut them! Push baking paper all into the base & sides up. Put your base mix into the fitted lined dish. With clean hands, push your base all equally into the dish. You will end up with a thicker layer of this yummy mix. Place into the freezer to set. This will take about 10-15 minutes. You can do this while you prepare the middle layer. Clean your food processor & put the S-blade back in again.",
      "Now, you are ready to make the 2nd layer. Place all your ingredients for the 2nd layer in it. This is: your pitted dates, coconut oil, raw peanut butter, vanilla extract, maple syrup & chopped Brazil nuts. Process until nearly smooth. You still want small pieces in it, for an added crunch later on. See pictures above! Take your set bottom layer out of the freezer & smear this 2nd layer all over it, evenly divided. Place into the freezer to set. This took me about 15-20 minutes on -18\u00b0C! Wash your food processor & S-blade once again & now, finally, make the 3rd, last top layer.",
      "Take your food processor & place the S-blade in. Add ingredients for this layer & that will be the fresh blackberries, maple syrup & 2 pitted Medjool dates. Blitz until completely smooth. take your dessert out of the freezer & smear your top layer equally all over the 2nd layer. See that you have everything covered! Place into the freezer for about 1 hour to set. take out of the freezer & wait for about 5 minutes. Take your bars to be out of the oven dish with the help of your hands & the lined paper. Place it on a chopping board & with a sharp knife, cut into equal sized bars. I got 18 bars out of it! ;) Eat 2 of them & place the rest back into the freezer, into fitted food containers with fitted lids. Keep into the freezer! Remove from the freezer, 10 minutes before devouring! They won't last long, I assure you! :)"

      "Dissolve the 3 tablespoons of salt into a large bowl of water (your largest mixing bowl, or about 4 quarts water). Add the chickpeas and soak for 8 to 24 hours. Drain, and place in a pot with the onion, thyme, and remaining teaspoon of salt. Cover with water by three inches. Bring to a boil, then lower heat and cook at the gentlest simmer for about an hour or until the chickpeas are cooked through. Let chickpeas cool in their cooking liquid. Discard thyme sprigs, and onion. Store chickpeas in their cooking liquid. You need 4 cups of cooked chickpeas for the recipe.",
      "Meanwhile, cook the cauliflower: Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil. Meanwhile, cut out the core of the cauliflower and remove the leaves. Cut the cauliflower into florets about 2-inches in size - they'll break down further when they cook with the chickpeas. You should have about 6 cups. Add the 1 tablespoon of salt and the cauliflower to the boiling water, and cook for 5 minutes, until the cauliflower is tender but not mushy. Lift out the florets with a slotted spoon, and spread on a tray or plate to cool.",
      "Meanwhile, in a large pot over medium heat, warm the olive oil. Add the onion and curry powder and cook, stirring now and then, until the onions are softened and the curry is very fragrant, about 10 minutes.",
      "Add the coconut milk, then fill the empty can with water and add it to the saucepan. Add the remaining 2 teaspoons salt, the cooked cauliflower, 4 cups cooked chickpeas, raisins, and pine nuts, if using. Stir everything together, turn the heat to high, and bring the mixture to a boil. Turn the heat to low and let simmer, stirring now and then, for about 20 minutes, or until the liquid has reduced, the cauliflower has broken down a bit, and the chickpeas taste flavorful. Add the cilantro and stir to combine. Season to taste with salt. Serve with naan."

      "Place a foil-lined baking sheet in the oven and preheat to 375 F.",
      "Prepare your preferred steaming method, or create a makeshift steamer. To create the steamer, fill a large pot with the juice of half a lime, the juiced half lime itself, a few inches of water, and 2 tbsp. of Shaoxing. Place a heatproof jar inside the pot. Set aside a small heat-proof plate that can rest atop the jar, and ensure the pot/heatproof jar/plate can all still be covered with the pot's lid.",
      "Mix soy sauce, mirin, rice wine vinegar, juice from one lime, 3/4 tbsp. of sesame oil, and 1 tbsp. Shaoxing wine in a small bowl and set aside.",
      "Wash and thoroughly dry produce. Roughly chop mushrooms; don't be too concerned with making each piece a uniform size - a little textural diversity is really nice in the finished dish. Slice half of the dark-green portion of the scallions into 4-6-inch-long strips and the other half into quarter inch long slivers for use as a garnish. Roughly chop cilantro for use as a garnish. Peel and thinly julienne the ginger and remaining white and light-green portion of the scallions, and toss the aromatic scraps into the steaming liquid. Adding these scraps to the liquid will impart a subtle flavor to the finished fish.",
      "Toss the mushrooms with 2 tbsp. neutral oil, salt, and pepper until fully coated. When the oven is preheated, place the mushrooms on the baking sheet in an even layer and transfer to oven. Roast mushrooms for about 15 minutes until they have released a fair amount of liquid, drain the liquid - adding 2 tbsp. of the liquid to the bowl of soy sauce mixture - and then roast for an additional 30 minutes until mushrooms are well browned. Toss with a handful of sesame seeds and a 1 tbsp. of sesame oil.",
      "While the mushrooms are roasting, dry and season the fish with salt, pepper, and the remaining 1 tbsp. of Shaoxing wine. Heat the pot on medium-high until the steaming liquid is simmering. Line the small plate with several of the dark green scallion strips, and rest the seasoned fish on the strips -- doing this will help lift the cooked fish off the plate once it steams! Carefully place the plate inside the steaming pot and cover, letting the steam cook the fish for 8-10 minutes or until fork-tender and cooked through.",
      "While the fish steams, heat 1 tbsp. canola oil in a small pan over medium heat. Once the oil is shimmering, brown julienned ginger and scallions in the pot until fragrant. Remove from heat, and pour soy sauce mixture over the heated aromatics to halt the cooking and warm the sauce.",
      "To serve, divide cooked rice between two plates and top with the roasted mushrooms. Lift the steamed fish off the cooking plate, discarding the scallion strips, and place on the mushrooms and rice. Top the fish with the sauce, and ginger and scallion mixture, a sprinkle of sesame seeds, and the chopped cilantro. Cut the remaining half lime into wedges and serve while hot."

I've used the mini tins which are metal tins but you could try a rubber mould, just be aware this is a heavy bake, so you don't want a mould that will give way.
