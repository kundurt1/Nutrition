Add 3 cups flour (400g), 3 tablespoons sugar, 1 teaspoon salt, 2 tablespoons melted butter, and 3/4 cup cold water in a stand mixer bowl. Hand mix with dough hook till combined. Mix on medium-low in stand mixer with dough hook 6-10 minutes until dough is supple, soft, bounces back when pressed with finger and slightly tacky.",
      "2. Proof Dough Twice\nPlace dough in large bowl that has been sprayed with quality non-stick spray. Cover bowl with plastic wrap or damp towel, place in a warm, draft-free spot, and let dough rise until doubled in size, 1-1 1/2 hours. Punch down dough and knead lightly a few times inside bowl. Cover again with plastic wrap and chill in refrigerator until dough is again doubled in size, 45-60 minutes.",

Using a rolling pin roll out butter till it is flat and uniformly filling bag it should be between 1/4-1/2\" thick. Complete this step while dough is mixing so butter can chill in refrigerator till firm but still pliable 30-45 minutes.",
      "5. Roll Out Dough & Enclose Butter Block\nRoll out dough on a lightly floured surface into an 18x18\" square (Remove butter sheet from zip lock bag by cutting edges off with scissors and peeling bag off). Place butter sheet on rolled out dough 45 degrees in relations to the dough so that dough can be folded over like an envelope enclosing butter sheet. After folding press edges of dough to seal, enclosing butter.",

Fold rectangle into thirds like a letter (you are putting into an envelope), bringing lower third up, then upper third down (this completes the first turn). Repeat rolling out, dusting with sugar and folding to finish second turn. Dust dough lightly with flour, wrap in plastic, and chill in refrigerator about 1 1/2 hour.

Roll out dough, dusting with flour as needed, to a 12x18\" rectangle, about 3/8\" thick, sprinkle with sugar as before. Fold into thirds (same way as before), rotate 90\u00b0F counterclockwise so flap opening is on your right, and roll out again to a 12x18\" rectangle. Sprinkle surface of dough with sugar one last time; fold into thirds. Dust lightly with flour, wrap in plastic, and chill in refrigerator another hour.",
      "8. Roll Out & Cut Dough\nPlace dough on surface so flap opening is on your right. Roll out dough, dusting with flour as needed, to a rectangle slightly larger than 16x12\". Trim to 16x12\". Cut into 12 squares (you'll want a 4x3 grid). Brush excess flour from dough and surface.",

Turn over and repeat with another 1/4 cup sugar, pressing gently to adhere. Shake off excess. Lift corners of each square and press into the center. Place each in a muffin cup. Wrap pans with plastic and chill in refrigerator at least 8 hours and up to 12 hours (dough will be puffed with slightly separated layers).",
      "10. Bake Kouign-Amann\nPreheat oven to 375\u00b0F. Unwrap pans and sprinkle kouign-amann with 2 tablespoons sugar, and light sprinkling of Fleur de Sel salt or Kosher salt. Bake until pastry is golden brown all over and sugar is deeply caramelized, 30-45 minutes (make sure to bake pastries while dough is still cold). Immediately remove from pan and transfer to a wire rack; let cool.",
      "Notes: Kouign-amann are best the day they're baked, but if you have leftovers, store in an airtight container at room temperature. Reheat in a 300\u00b0F oven 5 minutes."

Discard seeds and stir raspberry mixture until gelatin is dissolved. Set aside, stirring occasionally, until curd is slightly thickened and reaches room temperature, at least 30 minutes or up to 1 hour 15 minutes.",

Leave clasp of ring slightly loose. Using sharp chef's knife, trim 1/8 inch off all edges of square cake. Spread square cake with 2 tablespoons jam mixture. Cut cake in half. Cut each half lengthwise into two pieces to make four equal-size long strips. Place cake strips vertically around round cake, jam side in, taking care to nestle ends together neatly.
