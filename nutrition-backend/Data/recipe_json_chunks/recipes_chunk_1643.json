      "Bake for 10 to 12 minutes or until the cake springs back when touched with a fingertip. Remove from oven and let cool for 2 minutes, then turn out the cake upside down onto a piece of parchment paper sprinkled lightly with powdered sugar. You can also use a clean dish towel.",

Don't make this layer too thick or you'll find yourself with a big old mess when you try to roll it up (you may not need all of the filling). Starting with the same short side as before, carefully roll up the cake, trying not to let the filling squish out too much. Set the seam side down, then refrigerate for at least 30 minutes to allow the filling to set up a bit (this will make it much easier to slice later).",

Warm cream in a small saucepan over medium-low heat until it just begins to bubble around the edges (do not let it boil). Pour evenly over chopped chocolate; let sit for 30 seconds, then gently whisk, in concentric circles starting in the very center, until chocolate is melted and mixture is smooth. Whisk in butter, one cube at a time, until melted and completely smooth.",

Flatten the dough into a disk, wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate until chilled, at least 1 hour.",

Heat the canola oil in a large skillet over high heat until it begins to shimmer. Add the chorizo and break it into smaller pieces with a wooden spoon; cook until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate using a slotted spoon and let cool slightly. Slice the frozen goat cheese into 1/2-inch-thick rounds.",

      "Skin your fish fillets, and chop into chunks. Season with black pepper but don't add salt; as we're adding canned anchovies to the Puttanesca sauce, this will add plenty of salt. Season the prawns with black pepper. Arrange the fish in the bottom of a deep oven-proof dish, making sure to spread the different types of fish around if you have used more than one type - as above, I used mackerel, haddock and salmon.",
      "For the Puttanesca sauce, drain the anchovies and dice them into tiny chunks. Do the same with the olives and the chillies, if necessary depending on the size, the capers. \n\nIf you have a fancy hand blender which will roughly chop ingredients without liquidising them, you can simply add all the ingredients to this and give it a couple of spins.\n\nIf your blender is a bit more zealous and liquidises food, then just give the tomatoes a brief spin and add the other ingredients after chopping them manually. Add the basil, oregano, and black pepper. Stir thoroughly and pour over the fish in the bottom of the oven-proof dish, ensuring even coverage..",
      "Add a second pan of boiling water to the hob, and wilt the spinach leaves for around five minutes, removing any long stalks beforehand.",
      "Remove the potatoes from the hob and drain - they should be soft enough to mash now. Add some butter and a dash of milk, and the soft Italian cheese. Take the wilted spinach from the hob and add to the potatoes. Mash or cream until the cheese and spinach is thoroughly mixed in and the potatoes have a smooth, creamy texture.",
      "Evenly spread the potatoes over the top of the fish / sauce mix using a spatula. This is why it's important to make sure the potatoes are creamy and smooth, or you're not going to be able to spread them. Make sure the potatoes go right to the edges of the dish to \"seal\" the fish and sauce inside. Grate your cheddar or Monterrey Jack over the top, and finish with another pinch of black pepper.",
      "Place the dish in the over, uncovered, and leave for 20-30 minutes, depending on how crispy you like the potatoes to be on top. After cooking, remove the dish and leave to stand for five minutes before serving. Serve with baby carrots, broccoli, peas or green beans and a glass of your favourite white wine."

      "Once the oven is preheated, dice tofu into 1/4 inch cubes and arrange on baking sheet. Bake for 26-30 minutes. You're looking for golden brown edges and a texture that's firm to the touch. The longer it bakes, the firmer`and crispier it will become, so if you're looking for softer tofu remove from the oven around 26-28 minute mark. Set aside.",
      "While the tofu bakes, prepare your rice by bringing 12 cups of water to a boil in a large pot. Once boiling, add rinsed rice and stir. Boil on high uncovered for 30 minutes, then strain for 10 seconds and return to pot removed from heat. cover with a lid and let steam for 10 minutes.",
      "While rice and tofu are cooking, prepare sauce by adding all ingredients to a medium-size mixing bowl and whisk to combine. Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more tamarin or soy sauce for saltiness, peanut butter for creaminess, brown sugar for sweetness, or chili garlic sauce for heat.",
      "Once the tofu is done baking, add directly to the sauce and marinate for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.",
      "Heat a large metal or cast iron skillet over medium heat. Once hot, use a slotted spoon to scoop the tofu into the pan leaving most of the sauce behind. Cook for 3-4 minutes, stirring occasionally, until deep golden brown on all sides. Lower heat if browning too quickly. Remove from pan and set aside.",
      "To the still hot pan, add garlic, green onion, peas, and carrots. Saute for 3-4 minutes, stirring occasionally, and season with 1 tbsp tamari or soy sauce.",
      "Add cooked rice, tofu, and remaining sauce and stir. Cook over medium-high heat for 3-4 minutes, stirring frequently.",
      "Crushed salted, roasted peanuts or cashews make a lovely additional garnish. Leftovers will keep in the refrigerator for 3-4 days, though best when fresh. Reheat in a skillet over medium heat, or in the microwave."

Add the eggs and milk to the mixture and work it together until you have a ball of dough. Flour it lightly, wrap it in clingfilm and put into the fridge to rest for about half an hour.When you have your ball of dough, wrap it in clingfilm and place it in the fridge to rest for about half an hour. Once the pastry has rested, remove it from the frdige and roll it out onto a floured surface. Line the tart dish with the rolled out pastry, pressing it gently into place. Put it in the freezer for an hour.",
      "Meanwhile, make the frangipane. Blitz the blanched whole almonds (to blanche the almonds yourself leave the almonds in a bowl of hot water for 15-20 minutes and then peel the skins off) in a food processor until you have a fine powder and transfer this to a bowl with the flour. Halve the vanilla pod lengthways and scrape out the seeds, using the back of a knife. (Mix the seeds with a little sugar to separate them if need be). Now blitz the butter, sugar and vanilla seeds until light and creamy. Put the almond mixture back into the food processor with the lightly beaten eggs and whiz until completely mixed and smooth. Place in the fridge to firm up for about half an hour.",

Spoon the warm plum jam into the pastry case, reserving a little for serving, and smooth it out across the bottom. Spread the frangipane over the plum jam. Arrange the plums on the surface of the frangipane, pressing them in lightly. Scatter the sliced/flaked almonds over the top. Bake the tart in the oven for about an hour. It's a good idea to place the tart dish on a piece of baking parchment as it has a tendency to bubble over - at least mine did! Once cooked through and golden on top, remove the tart from the oven and leave it to cool.",
