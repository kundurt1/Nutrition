      "Wine note: The delicacy of the fish, the citrusy flavors, and the lightly exotic touch of ginger all demand a wine that is itself light, delicate, dry, and fruity: riesling. It's also a boon that riesling is high in acidity--always a great counterpoint to the oils in fish (that's why we squeeze lemon on fish). Of all rieslings, German wines are the most delicate and fruity. There are many great German rieslings available in wineshops; be sure to buy one labeled \"Kabinett\" or \"Spatlese.\" A kabinett riesling is the lightest; spatlese is more full-bodied. Selbach-Oster, Dr. F. Weins-Prum, and Dr. Loosen are all terrific producers. Prices start at $ -Karen MacNeil"

This creates a little steam hole so the lid won't blow off a simmering pot. 7) Place the tip of the lid at the center point of the pot, then trim the far end so the lid will fit the pot exactly. 8) Unfold your lid. You'll know you folded it the wrong way if it ends up as two halves. 9) Place the lid in contact with the food you're cooking."

If you're grilling over a two-level fire, you can move the food around from hotter areas to cooler areas as needed. In fact, it's often a good idea to keep a small corner of your fuel grate free of coals, even when direct grilling. Invariably one steak or burger or sausage will cook faster than the others, and you'll want a small warming zone to stash it in while you finish the rest of the batch.",
      "While true barbecue is often cooked at temperatures as low as 175\u00b0, we found it more manageable to maintain a temperature between 250\u00b0 and 300\u00b0 on our home-style grills. Because it's hard to gauge such low temperatures with the hand test, we use an instant-read thermometer (choose a heatproof model that reads up to at least 400\u00b0) to monitor the temperature of the grill."
