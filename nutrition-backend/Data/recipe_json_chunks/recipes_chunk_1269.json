Don't worry, if they are a little too thick it just takes a few minutes longer to cook. I promise this one is easy. Now, peel the onion and chop finely. Heat the stock in a small saucepan while cutting the vegetables. Wash the potatoes and pat them dry. Butter the baking dish or Lasagne tray generously. Arrange a layer of potato slices, sprinkle with some chopped onion and salt and pepper. Continue layering in this way until all the potatoes are used. You should finish with a layer of potatoes on top. Season with salt and pepper. This dish should be a little salty. Now pour the stock and milk over. Place a few small knobs of butter on top and bake in the oven at 350F for about 45 minutes, until the top layer is golden brown. This dish goes well with roast chicken, roast lamb or roast beef. If serving with chicken use chicken stock if beef, beef stock. I like to serve this with a vegetable medley: peas, corn and carrots. For variations, try adding a few cloves of garlic, or using leeks instead of onions."

      "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Butter and flour cake pan. Set chocolate and rum or coffee in small pan, cover and place off heat in larger pan of almost simemring water; let melt while you proceed with recipe. Measure out rest of ingredients. Cream butter and sugar together for several minutes until they form a pale yellow fluffy mixture. Beat in egg yolks until well blended. Beat in egg whites and salt in separate bowl until soft peaks are formed; sprinkle on sugar and beat until stiff peaks are formed. With spatula, blend melted chocoalte into butter and sugar mixture, then stir in almonds, and almond extract. Immediately stir one fourth of egg whites to lighten the batter. Delicately fold in a third of remaining whites and when partially blended, sift on one third of flour and continue folding. Alternate rapidly with more egg whites and more flour until all egg whites and flour are incorporated. Turn batter into cake pan, pushing batter up to its rim with a spatula. Bake in middle level of oven for about 25 minutes. Cake is done when it has puffed, and 2-1/2 to 3 inches around the circumference are set so that a needle plunged into that area comes out clean; center should move slightly if pan is shaken, and a needle comes out oily. Allow cake to cool in pan for 10 minutes. Run knife around edge of pan, and reverse cake on rack. Allow it to cool for an hour or two; it must be thoroughly cold if it is to be iced.",
      "For the icing: Place chocolate and rum or coffee in small pan, cover, and set in larger pan of almost simmering water. Remove pans from heat and let chocolate melt for 5 minutes or so, until perfectly smooth. Lift chocolate pan out of hot water, and beat in butter a tablespoon at a time. Then beat over ice and water until chocolate mixture has cooled to spreading consistency. At once spread it over your cake with spatula or knife, and press a design of almonds over the icing."
