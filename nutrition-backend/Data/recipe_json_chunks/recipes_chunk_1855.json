      "This fruit leather has no preservatives aside from natural sugars so it only keeps for about a week in an airtight container at room temperature, but will keep indefinitely in the fridge."

      "Do not use aluminum or glass as the lye can pit your pan and ruin your soap.",

      "Warm them on low until they are at about 100F.",
      "When both pans are at 100F-110F, slowly pour the lye water into the fat, stirring constantly.",

      "As you stir, you will see the mixture go from a dark color to a light color.",
      "This is the visual proof that the oil and water are mixing.",
      "After you've mixed it by hand for a few minutes, you may use your electric mixer to continue mixing.",
      "Wear your safety goggles and gloves as the soap is very caustic and will burn skin.",
      "If your pan isn't that deep, you might need to cover it with plastic wrap and put a hole in the center for your mixer to prevent splatter.",

      "Fragrance oils, because they are artificial, often will change the appearance of your soap, causing you to lose control over the look of the finished product.",
      "Because of that, I highly recommend that, if you want a scent, you use essential oils.",
      "Yes, they are expensive.",

      "It will take experimentation for you to really perfect the scent in your soaps, but your family and friends will love to receive your experiments as gifts.",
      "A NOTE ABOUT COLOR: Do not try food coloring or clothing dye to tint your soap.",
      "At trace, you may pull out a portion of soap and add some cocoa powder to it for a tint.",
