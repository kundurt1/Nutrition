      "Buy the right meat. For juicy burgers, get ground chuck with a fat content of at least 18%. Lean and extra-lean meat make tough, dry burgers. Also, the more freshly ground the meat is, the more tender and flavorful the burger: If your store has butchers, ask them to grind the meat fresh for you. (Or just grind your own, following our no-fuss method, see below.)",
      "Mix in salt very, very gently. The more you handle the meat, the tougher your burger will be. In a large bowl, pull the meat apart into small chunks, add salt, and toss gently with fingers spread apart until loosely mixed.",
      "Use wet hands to form patties. This keeps your hands from getting sticky. It also allows the meat to come together faster and prevents overhandling.",
      "Make patties thinner in the center. Divide the meat into 8 equal portions and form into 1/4- to 1/2-inch-thick patties. Divide gorgonzola into 4 equal portions; shape each into a disk and put on a patty. Top gorgonzola disks with remaining 4 patties and seal edges of patties around cheese. Gently shape patties so that they are about 1/4 inch thinner in center than on edges. (They'll shrink and even out when cooking.)",
      "Keep meat cold until it goes on the grill. Put the patties in the fridge while the grill heats up. This helps more of the flavor-carrying fat stay in the meat.",
      "Use a clean, well-oiled, preheated grill. Bits of debris encourage sticking, as does an unoiled surface and too low a temperature; you want your burgers to quickly sizzle, firm up, and release from the grill.",
      "Keep grill at a steady high heat (you can hold your hand 1 to 2 inches above grill level for 2 to 3 seconds). If using charcoal, you want ash-covered coals to produce even heat. With a gas grill, keep the lid down while cooking; with a charcoal grill, leave the lid off.",
      "Flip burgers once and at the right time. Constant turning will toughen and dry out meat, and if you flip too soon, burgers will stick. Cook 2 minutes per side for rare, 3 for medium-rare, 4 for medium, and 5 for well-done.",
      "Don't press on the burgers while they're cooking. The juice that seeps out holds most of the flavor and moisture.",
      "Let burgers rest a few minutes before eating. This allows them to finish cooking and allows their juices, which have collected on the surface during grilling, to redistribute throughout patty.",
      "The real secret: Grind your own meat.",
      "Grinding meat at home is not only easier than most people think, but also makes the moistest and most flavorful burgers. And, given the periodic safety concerns about commercially ground meat, home-ground is the way to go if you like your burgers cooked rare or medium. Manual meat grinders (about $30) are available at kitchen supply stores, and grinder attachments (about $50) for standing mixers work very well.",
      "For four 6-ounce burgers, buy 1 1/2 pounds chuck roast or sirloin, keeping a thin layer of fat on the meat.",
      "For added safety, bring a large pot of water to a boil and boil the roast for 30 to 60 seconds. Remove meat and rinse with cold water.",
      "Cut the meat into 1-inch pieces. In a large bowl, toss meat pieces with 1 teaspoon salt. Cover and refrigerate overnight.",
      "Chill the grinder for 30 minutes before starting (a cold grinder grinds more efficiently).",
      "Set up grinder according to manufacturer's instructions, using the coarse plate or setting. Feed meat into funnel and grind, stopping to clear the grinder if necessary. Put ground meat through grinder once more and proceed with step 2 above.",

      "In a heatproof bowl, combine the prunes, vanilla bean and fennel seed bag. In a medium saucepan, bring the wine and Armagnac to a boil. Pour over the prunes; let cool. Cover with plastic and let the prunes macerate for 2 days.",
      "Preheat the oven to 375\u00b0. Butter a 10-inch springform pan and lightly dust it with sugar. In a medium saucepan, bring the prunes and their soaking liquid to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and simmer until a syrup forms, about 25 minutes. Strain the prunes over a bowl; remove the fennel seed bag and squeeze the syrup back into the pan. Remove the vanilla bean; scrape the seeds into the syrup and stir. Reserve 12 plump prunes in the syrup. Finely chop the remaining prunes.",

      "Make Ahead: The souffle can be prepared through Step 5 earlier in the day.",
      "Wine Recommendation: This airy dessert needs only the grace note of a concentrated wine with similar flavors. Look for a fortified Pinot Gris such as the 2000 Mendelson from Napa, or try the 2001 Rosenblum Viognier Late Harvest from Lodi, California.",
      "Notes: To total time, add 2 days soaking time."

    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "To prepare jam, grate tomatoes, flesh side down, over a large bowl to form 5 1/2 cups pulp; discard skins. Combine pulp, sugar, onion, 3 garlic cloves, and 2 jalapenos in a medium saucepan; bring to a boil. Reduce heat, and simmer until reduced to 2 1/4 cups (about 20 minutes), stirring occasionally. Cool to room temperature. Stir in cilantro, 3 tablespoons juice, and 1/4 teaspoon salt.",
      "To prepare steak, combine rind, 1/3 cup juice, oil, 2 jalapenos, and 2 garlic cloves in a large zip-top plastic bag. Add steak; seal. Marinate in refrigerator 8 hours or overnight, turning bag occasionally.",
      "Prepare grill.",
      "Remove steak from bag; discard marinade. Sprinkle both sides of steak evenly with 1/2 teaspoon salt. Place steak on a grill rack coated with cooking spray; grill 3 minutes on each side or until desired degree of doneness. Let stand 5 minutes. Cut steak diagonally across the grain into thin slices. Serve with jam. Garnish with lemon slices, if desired.",
      "Wine note: Tomato Jam captures the rich flavor of summer tomatoes, a classic partner for high-acid red wines. For a sure bet, reach for Chianti or an affordable barbera, like Michele Chiarlo Barbera d'Asti Le Orme 2004 ($13). This bright and fruity wine has tart cranberry flavors and the vibrant acidity that tomatoes demand. Earthy and smoky aromas resonate with the grilled steak. --Jeffery Lindenmuth"

Try the Gloria Ferrer form the Carneros region of California ($22) or, for a steal, the McPherson Chardonnay from South Eastern Australia ($8)."

In a fire ring, stack four large logs in a box shape (use six if you're planning a long cooking time). Add tinder inside the box and arrange kindling in a tipi over it. Light tinder with matches or a lighter in a couple of spots; when it starts smoking, blow gently until flames emerge. It takes 1 to 1 1/2 hours for a campfire to burn down to low flames and embers, the ideal stage for cooking. At that point, spread the fire evenly under the cooking grate, using grilling tongs. Move logs or add more of them as needed."

Meanwhile, whisk together the molasses, vinegar, mustard, sugar, pepper, and 2 tablespoons of water. Drain the beans. Place the onion in a 2-quart Dutch oven. Add the beans. Cover with the salt pork or bacon. Cover with the molasses mixture. Heat oven to 300\u00b0 F. Cover Dutch oven and bake, checking often, until the beans are tender, the meat is falling apart, and the liquid is thick and bubbly, about 6 hours. Add more water (or even a second batch of the molasses mixture) if the beans start to dry out. Serve with buttered bread."
