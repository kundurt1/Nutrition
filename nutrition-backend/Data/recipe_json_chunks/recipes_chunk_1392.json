Wet your finger and run it along one side of the one side of the inside of the circle of dough.

Then add remaining cake cubes in a tight layer (may have some leftover to snack on) and repeat with the same layers, ending with whipped cream (may have a little whipped cream leftover, too, to serve with the trifle if desired). Garnish with pecan halves and chill for at least 4 hours or overnight. I think it is better served the next day. Enjoy!"

The top should be browned bananas topped with a sticky caramel. if it is not brown and sticky pop it under the grill for a few minutes. Serve immediately or this is great served cold or made ahead and warmed in the oven for about 10 minutes before serving. The French would always serve their apple tatin with Chantilly or ice cream - thick cream here is fabulous but a good greek yoghurt is lovely too. Bon Appetite!"

Place the apples in a large microwave-safe bowl, sprinkle 1/2 c. sugar and cinnamon over the apples and stir to mix thoroughly. Heat the apples in the microwave 1 minute at a time, stirring and heating until just hot (don't cook the filling!). Pour the filling into the pie crust; there's only too much filling if the apple slices are falling on the counter or floor.\r\n\r\nFor the crumble crunch topping:\r\n\r\nCombine the flour, remaining 1/2 c. sugar, and salt in a small mixing bowl. Cut in the butter till the mixture looks crumbly (as opposed to chunky or fine), and pour it all over the top of the pie. If the pie is overly full (which is best), I usually set the whole pie pan on a large sheet of foil before baking. Juice will likely escape as the filling takes its finished form, so plan accordingly.\r\n\r\nBake the pie for 10 minutes at 450, then reduce heat to 350 and continue baking for at least 30 minutes. The pie is done when the topping takes on a golden hue; you'll likely glimpse the bubbling filling as well. Carefully remove the pie from the oven and cool completely on a wire rack. Chill, or serve warmed with ice cream."

Do not throw the giblets or neck away - save them for the gravy! You can spatchcock/butterfly your turkey before or after you do this - I did mine after for no particular reason at all. I put my turkey in a brine bag in the fridge overnight while it sat with the salt on it, lightly closed, but you can put it on a plate or in a roasting pan, lightly covered with foil, too. [As a side note, people like to brine turkey in some kind of salt water or apple juice mixture, which is fine, but this just water logs the turkey and makes it tastes like water or apple juice. \"Curing\" the turkey with salt, however, gives the same benefit of breaking down the muscle fibers in the turkey to make it moist and juicy without taking on the flavor of anything of than delicious turkey.]",
      "When you're ready to cook your turkey, chop your onions, carrots and celery. Line a baking tray with foil if you don't have a roasting pan, then toss the vegetables and rosemary together and spread them out on the baking tray or roasting pan. Top the vegetables with a cooling rack fitted into the baking sheet or the roasting tray itself.",
      "Preheat your oven to 450 degrees F. It's time to spatchcock your turkey if you haven't already. Place a wet paper towel under your cutting board so that it doesn't slip around, and using a pair of kitchen shears (highly recommended) or a very sharp knife, carefully cut the backbone out of your turkey, starting at the tail end. Cutting through gets a little tough in certain areas, but just follow the back bone and keep cutting. See the photos above if you're unsure, but I promise this is really easy and almost impossible to mess up. Do one side, then do the other. Be really careful not to slip or cut yourself - do not attempt this with a blunt knife.",
      "Once the back bone is out, set it aside to be used for the gravy, if you like. Flip the bird over so that it is breast side up. Using as much force as possible, press your palm into the \"sternum\" of the turkey, between the two breasts, and press down to flatten the bird as much as possible (again, see the photos above). Spread the legs out, away from the body, and tuck the wings in so that they don't burn in the oven. Rub the whole thing with a few tablespoons of olive oil. Place the turkey on top of your prepare sheet or roasting pan and place in the oven for 70-80 minutes, until the breast registers 150 degrees F and the thighs register 165 degrees F.",
      "When the turkey is done, let it rest for 20 minutes or so before carving. Save any juices from the bottom of the pan to add to the gravy, if you like."

      "Tie the pork butt with twine in several places so that it cooks evenly. Salt it generously all over and let it sit at room temperature for about an hour.",
      "In the meantime, combine the maple syrup, brown sugar, mustard, thyme, garlic and chipotle powder in a small bowl. Add a few pinches of salt and several grinds of pepper.",
      "Heat the oven to 475\u00b0 F. When the pork is at room temperature and the oven is hot, smear the sugar, mustard and garlic mixture all over the pork, concentrating a good amount of it on the top of the roast, where the fat is. Nestle the pork (fat-side-up) into a roasting pan or cast iron baking dish just big enough to hold it, and put it in the oven. When you start to smell garlic and sugar burning, and after no longer than 15 minutes, turn the heat down to 200 degrees. (Do not open the oven door to peek!)",
      "Leave the pork in the oven overnight, for at least 6 hours and up to 8. When you wake up in the morning your house will smell intoxicating, and the pork will be ready to shred and pack up for lunches for the whole family -- all you need is a soft roll and some coleslaw or pickled fennel, or a big pile of mashed potatoes."

To assess if the rise is good, lightly press a finger in the side of the loaf and it should barely spring back.",
      "30 minutes before anticipating placing the loaves in the oven, put a pizza stone in the oven and set for 475 degrees.",
      "Uncover loaves. Spray lightly with water. Cut shallow slits in the top of the loaves to avoid blowouts of air through the sides. Bake for 20 minutes then rotate the loaves and drop temp to 375. Bake for an additional 20 minutes. Bread should have a dark crust, tapping on the bottom produces a hollow sound and an instant read thermometer inserted through the side of the bread should read 210 degrees."

Bring the eggs to room temperature before whipping them, so you get a nice volume. \r\n4. Once the meringue is whipped, try to turn upside down the bowl, should not fall :)\r\n5.

The more alcohol, the slower the sorbet will freeze. After about 2 hours, check on the sorbet. It should be about half frozen. Use the immersion blender to break up any icy bits. Return the sorbet to the freezer and repeat this every hour or so. If you forget and throw the sorbet in the freezer overnight, no problem - it will just take a few extra whirs with the blender to break up the solid mass the next morning."

      "I made the crepes on a slightly thicker side, as I wanted the crepe layers to stay in place through the process, and afterwards. I had to make 3 batches of the crepes batter, as some of the crepes were stolen by the quality testers by some naughty elves.",
      "Combine all the dry ingredients in a large mixing bowl and mix well, specially the espresso powder before adding the eggs, followed by the Cognac or Marsala wine and the milk. You may or may not need some extra milk depending on how thick you want the batter to be for the crepes. I kept mine on the medium side, so not too thick. Add the butter in the end.",
      "Whisk well and let the batter sit for about 15 minutes before you start making the crepes. Whisk it one more time as it will turn out shiny and smooth, ready to be cooked.",
      "Heat a 10 inch non-stick frying pan on medium heat and once its nice and hot, spread about 3/4 cup of the crepe batter. I used a wooden crepe stick to help spread the batter on the pan evenly and to get rid of any bubbles and tiny bumps that appear from time to time.",
      "Cook the crepe until the ends start to curl up a little, and it separates from the pan. About 2 minutes. Flip the crepe over and cook for another 40 seconds or so, before taking it out on a large plate. Keep repeating the process until the batter has all finished.",
      "For the next batch of batter, use less espresso powder. It creates a beautiful ombre effect on the colour of the layers of the cake. The darkest ones will end up on the top as they are in the first batch.",
      "Let the crepes cool to room temperature. Cover with cling film and refrigerate overnight. You want them to harden up a little for the cake.",
      "I made the icing in small batches, using one 500gm tub of Mascarpone cheese at a time as I had to control the consistency of the icing from the bottom up.",
      "The bottom most layer must be stiffer than the rest of the layers, and does not need any whipping cream. It gives the cake a stronger foundation. For the first batch of whipping cream you make (for bottom layers of cake) Whisk the mascarpone until nice and soft, before stirring in 1/2 cup of icing sugar and a little glug of alcohol. If you want the icing sweeter, just add more sugar. Just taste a little to adjust as we did not want ours too sweet.",
      "For the second batch of icing, add 3-4 tbsp of whipping cream to the cheese as well as a slightly bigger glug of alcohol and 1/2 a cup of sugar (or more to taste). This version would be slightly softer than the first.",
      "For each batch of icing you make, add a tbsp extra whipping cream each time and alcohol (to taste) and sugar (to taste). The top most layer would be slightly softer.",
      "CAKE ASSEMBLY\r\nTaking one layer of crepe at a time, spread the icing evenly to the edges, before placing another layer on top. Continue till you finish the layers. Be gentle with the cake as you want the layers to stay straight and not move around. Don't put too much pressure when spreading the icing or the crepes will break. Once assembled, let it rest in the fridge for a couple of hours.",
      "Sprinkle the top of cake with cocoa powder generously and if using Ferrero Rocher chocolates to garnish, decorate them on top before serving. The cake tastes the best at room temperature and not straight out of the fridge as the icing needs to soften a little to enjoy the flavours.",
      "To make cake even boozier, sprinkle a little booze on each crepe before icing. Only a few drops will go a long way in terms of flavour. It is worth the hard work on this cake!"

      "Make the dough: Whisk the vanilla into the milk in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook. Use a fork or your fingers to lightly mix the yeast into the milk. Then, in this order, add the flours, eggs, sugar, salt, and finally the butter in small pinches.",
      "Mix on the lowest speed, stopping the mixer to scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl as needed, and to pull the dough off the hook as it accumulates there and break it apart so it mixes evenly, until the dough is well combined, about 2 minutes (it will not be smooth; see photo on page 29). If the dough is very dry, add more milk, 1 tablespoon at a time; if the dough looks wet, add more all-purpose flour, 1 tablespoon at a time, until the dough comes together. Increase the mixer speed to medium, and mix until the dough is smooth and has good elasticity, 4 minutes.",
      "Stretch and fold the dough: Lightly dust your work surface with flour and turn the dough out on top; lightly dust the top of the dough and the interior of a large bowl with flour. Grab the top portion of the dough and stretch it away from you, tearing the dough. Then fold it on top of the middle of the dough. Give the dough a quarter turn and repeat the stretch, tear, and fold. Continue to do this until you can stretch a small piece of dough very thin without it tearing, about 5 minutes. Then use your hands to push and pull the dough against the work surface and in a circular motion to create a nice round of dough. Set the ball in the floured bowl, cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and set it aside at room temperature for 30 minutes.",
      "Chill the dough: Set the dough on a piece of plastic wrap and press it into a 1-inch-thick rectangle. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate it for at least 1 hour or up to 24 hours before proceeding.",
      "Lightly coat 2 standard loaf pans with room-temperature unsalted butter.",
      "Roll the chilled dough: Lightly coat 2 standard loaf pans with room-temperature unsalted butter. Unwrap the cold babka dough and set it on a lightly floured work surface (or on a long dining table-you need at least 4 feet of work space). Roll the dough into a 9-by-24-inch rectangle (it should be just a little shy of 1/4-inch thick) with a long side facing you. Pull and shape the corners into a rectangle shape.",
      "Note: Only roll going along the length of the dough (left to right) and not up and down the dough. The height will naturally increase as you roll the dough, and by rolling the dough in just one direction, you're not going to stress the gluten. If the dough starts to spring back, that means it's tired. Let it rest for 5 minutes before trying again.",
      "Fill and roll the dough: Spread the Nutella in an even layer over the dough, all the way to the edges. Then sprinkle the chocolate chips in an even layer over the Nutella, across the entire surface of the dough. Working from the top edge, roll the dough into a tight cylinder. As you roll it, push and pull the cylinder a little to make it even tighter. Then, holding the cylinder at the ends, lift and stretch it slightly to make it even tighter and longer.",
      "Twist the strips into a babka: Use a bread knife to slice the cylinder in half lengthwise so you have 2 long pieces, and set them with the chocolate layers exposed. Divide the pieces crosswise in half, creating 4 equal-length strips. Overlap one strip on top of another to make an X, making sure the exposed chocolate part of the dough faces up; then twist the ends together like the threads on a screw so you have at least 2 twists on each side of the X. Repeat with the other two pieces. Place each shaped babka into a prepared loaf pan, exposed chocolate-side up. The dough should fill the pan by two-thirds and fit the length perfectly. Cover the pan with plastic wrap and repeat with the other pieces of dough.",
      "Note: Embrace the mess! Twisting the dough is a sticky process, but don't worry-after baking, even the messiest babka will still look beautiful and, more important, taste great.",
      "Let the dough rise: Set the loaf pans aside in a warm, draft-free spot until the dough rises 1 to 2 inches above the rim of the pan and is very soft and jiggly to the touch, 2 to 3 hours, depending on how warm your room is.",
      "Note: If your room is very cold, you can speed up the rising process: Set a large bowl of hot water on the bottom of the oven, place the loaf pans on the middle oven rack, close the oven door, and let the dough rise in the oven. Just remember that your babka is in there before preheating the oven!",
      "Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0 F. (If you are letting the dough rise in the oven, as described in the Note, be sure to remove the loaf pans and bowl of water before preheating.)",
      "Bake the babkas: Place the babkas in the oven and bake until they are dark brown and baked through, about 40 minutes; check them after 25 minutes, and if they are getting too dark, tent them loosely with a piece of parchment paper or aluminum foil.",
      "Meanwhile, make the simple syrup: Combine the sugar and water in a small saucepan and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally to dissolve the sugar. Turn off the heat and set aside the syrup to cool.",
      "Brush with simple syrup: Remove the babkas from the oven, and while they are still hot, brush the surface generously with the cooled sugar syrup (the syrup makes the top of the babkas shiny and beautiful and also locks in the moisture so the cake doesn't dry out; you may not need to use all the syrup-save any extra for sweetening iced coffee or tea). Use a paring knife to separate the babkas from the pan edges, and turn them out from the pan. Slice and serve warm, or cool completely in the pans before unmolding and slicing.",
      "Freezing and Defrosting Babka:\r\nBabka dough can be frozen so a fresh-from-the-oven babka can be had anytime. To freeze the shaped dough, double-wrap it in plastic wrap, then in aluminum foil (and then in a resealable freezer bag if it fits). To defrost the dough, unwrap it and let it sit out at room temperature, loosely covered with a kitchen towel or in a homemade proofing box, until it has proofed to about 1 inch above the lip of the loaf pan (the dough will take several hours to defrost, then extra time to proof depending on the warmth of your room). Then bake as instructed. \r\n\r\nBaked babkas also freeze beautifully, so don't hesitate to wrap one or two from your batch in a double layer of plastic wrap and then aluminum foil and freeze them for up to 1 month. Leave the wrapped frozen babka at room temperature for a few hours to thaw, and then remove the plastic wrap and rewrap in foil and place it in a preheated 325\u00b0F oven for 8 to 10 minutes to warm through. For the last 5 minutes in the oven, open the foil to expose the surface of the cake so it dries out just a bit."

Add in vegetable oil and water and whisk until mixture is thin and clump-free. Allow the batter to rest for 10 minutes.\r\n2. Heat a non-stick pan over medium heat. Once pan is hot, add 1 tablespoon of batter to center. You should bubbles form around the edges and then spread to the entire surface. If the bubbles don't spread, your batter is too thick. Add 2 tablespoons of water to the batter, whisk, and try again. If you add water and get the same result the second time, try adding 1/2 a teaspoon of baking powder, whisk, and try again. You should now see bubbles forming across your entire atayef.\r\n3. Your atayef is done cooking when it is no longer shiny and the bottom has browned evenly, about 1-2 minutes. Transfer atayef to a clean kitchen towel and cover to keep in moisture (and make it easy to seal). Continue to make remaining atayef until batter runs out. Layer atayef on kitchen towel with like sides facing each other (bubbly side touches bubbly side of next atayef, cooked sides touches cooked side, etc).",

To stuff, fold the atayef in a half circle and pinch along the sides, stopping halfway up. Use a small spoon to scoop ricotta mixture into the opening, then dip atayef into pistachios.\r\n6.

Slide them onto plates with a beautiful summer salad, top up your glasses of something sparkling, and sit down to a summer's brightly flavored dinner."

Cool the cake in the refrigerator. When you take it out, all the steam will have settled back into the cake leaving you with an incredibly moist cake. I do this with fruit breads as well. You end up with a very moist top which is not a problem at all if you are dusting the top with powdered sugar! Well worth it!"

      "To slow-roast the radish roots: Heat the oven to 425\u00b0 F (218\u00b0 C). Place the radishes in a heavy-bottomed nonstick roasting pan large enough to hold the slices in a single layer. Sprinkle with the fennel, salt, and pepper. Drizzle with the maple syrup and olive oil. Toss well, cover tightly with aluminum foil, and bake for 45 minutes, until very tender, tossing once halfway through the cooking.",
      "Remove foil and toss vegetables carefully so as not to break them. Return to oven, uncovered, and bake for 12 to 15 additional minutes, until golden. Remove from oven and serve with the soup.",
      "To make the soup: Put a large heavy-bottomed soup pot over medium-high heat. Add the olive oil, shallots, red pepper flakes, and garlic. Stir well and saute for 2 to 3 minutes until softened, stirring from time to time. Add the potatoes, stock, water, and salt and pepper to taste. Bring to a boil. Add the radish leaves, stir well, and continue to boil until wilted, about 1 to 2 minutes. Reduce heat to medium to medium-low, cover the pot, and simmer for 20 minutes, until the potatoes are tender.",
      "Add the creme fraiche and puree the soup with an immersion blender or a food processor until silky smooth. Taste and adjust the seasoning if needed and keep warm.",
      "Place a small mound of the roots on a plate. Ladle the soup in a small bowl and place next to the roots. Drizzle the infused oil on the soup and serve immediately.",
      "The soup will keep for about 3 days in the refrigerator, or 1 month in the freezer."

      "In a large pot, heat up your coconut oil over medium heat. Put the chicken pieces in, skin-side-down, to brown. You will probably need to do this in a couple batches. Give them plenty of time- if you try to turn them too soon, the skin will stick to the bottom. If they release easily, then they are probably ready to turn. Brown the other side, too. Remove the pieces from the pot when they're browned.",
      "Add your onions to the oil in the pan, and use a wooden spatula to scrape up the bits of chicken stuck to the bottom of the pan. Let them cook for about 4 minutes or so, then add the carrots and keep scraping for another minute or two. Salt a little as you go, to build flavor.",
      "Add the spices, ginger and garlic in, and stir them with the vegetables and let them toast in the oil for about a minute- you don't want them to burn, just to get really fragrant.",
      "Add the turnips, put the chicken pieces back into the pot, and pour in the coconut milk. Add a little hot water to the can to rinse and add that to the pot, as well- the liquid should be about to the chicken on top.",
      "Cover and cook for 45 minutes to an hour, moving things around in there a couple of times while it cooks. Check for seasoning, and add lemon juice or lime juice to taste- a nice little acid kick here is important for flavor balance. Add more salt or pepper, if needed. Top with chopped cilantro right before serving."

      "FOR THE BROWNED BUTTER PASTRY:\r\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees.\r\nIn a medium saucepan combine all ingredients except flour.\r\nCook over low heat for about 20 minutes until butter begins to brown and develops a nutty scent.\r\nRemove from heat and immediately add flour and stir with a wooden spoon until the mixture comes together\r\ninto a ball.\r\nIf the mixture seems too dry, add water by the teaspoonful as needed.\r\nPut dough into a 9-inch tart pan. \r\nLet cool 5-10 minutes until cool enough to handle.\r\nPress the mixture into the tart pan and up the sides.\r\nUse your fingers to press the dough evenly around the sides into all the crevices of the tart pan.\r\nPrick the bottom several times with a fork.\r\nPlace tart pan on a sheet pan and make a collar from aluminum foil and place it around the edge of the tart pan to protect the edges from getting too dark.\r\nBake in preheated oven for about 25 minutes.\r\nDo not over brown the crust as you will be baking it again when filled.\r\nWhen very lightly golden, remove from oven and let cool completely.\r\nLeave the tart pan on the sheet pan as you will be baking it when filled.",
      "FOR THE CHOCOLATE LINING: (This is an optional step that you can skip if you're pressed for time.)\r\nIn a double boiler over medium low heat, melt the chocolate.\r\nWhen it is fully melted add the Grand Mariner and mix vigorously until blended.\r\nRemove from heat and paint the bottom and sides of the cooled tart shell with the chocolate mixture.\r\n\r\nNOTE: The Grand Mariner can be omitted if you choose not to use alcohol.",
      "FOR THE BITTERSWEET CHOCOLATE FILLING:\r\nPreheat the oven to 325 degrees.\r\nWarm the half and half in a saucepan over medium-low heat until bubbles start to form around the edges of the pan.\r\nRemove pan from heat and whisk in chocolate until all the chocolate is melted and the mixture is smooth and shiny.\r\nAdd the sugar and salt and mix well.\r\nAdd the chipotle in tiny increments, stir well, and taste. Because the heat of the chipotle can vary greatly depending on freshness, brand, and storage of the spice, use caution, and taste after each addition. Keep in mind that the heat seems to intensify after baking.\r\nAdd the adobo chili in 1/8 teaspoon increments, as above always stopping to taste. (Adobo, made from poblano chilis, is much milder than chipotle which is made from smoked jalapenos.)\r\nWith the tart pan still on the sheet pan, pour the mixture into the cooled tart shell and use the aluminum foil collar you made earlier around the edge of the tart.\r\nPut in preheated oven and bake for approximately 40 minutes, checking every 5 minutes after the first 30 minutes.\r\nIf you see any bubbles or cracks in the chocolate, remove from oven immediately to avoid over baking.\r\nWhen done, remove from oven and let cool completely.",
      "FOR THE CHOCOLATE-DIPPED ORANGE RIND:\r\nUsing a channel knife, cut 16 slices of orange rind, each the length of half the orange. Boil the rinds for one minute in small pot of boiling water, drain, rinse in cold water, and repeat. Set rinds out on paper towels to dry.\r\nIn a double boiler over medium low heat, melt the chocolate. Dip each orange rind into the chocolate, leaving the top third undipped. Place on waxed paper until chocolate is hardened. Before serving, garnish each slice with a tablespoon of mascapone cheese topped with one or two slivers of rind."

    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "A note before starting: Make sure your pork is cold! Meat binding breaks down at 64\u00b0 F, so if the meat gets warm, it's going to be a lot harder to make it bind together, and your sausage will be a crumbly mess.",
      "TO MAKE THE SAUSAGE IN A STAND MIXER: Place the ground pork shoulder in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Turn the mixer to the lowest speed and add the salt, pepper, and sage. Mix for exactly 1 minute (set a timer!), then add the white wine and mix for another timed minute, then add the ice water (just the water, not the ice) and mix for one more timed minute.",
      "TO MAKE THE SAUSAGE BY HAND: Add the pork and spices to a large bowl and knead the meat like you would knead bread, for about 5 minutes, until the mixture is tacky. Add the wine and the water and continue to knead until the surface is no longer outwardly wet -- about 1 more minute. The sausage should resist slightly when you try to pull a chunk out. A good way to test if the sausage is done is to take a medium-sized piece of it and stick it to the palm of your hand. If the mixture stays stuck to your palm for 10 seconds when you hold your palm up in the air, you're good to go!",
      "Pre-heat oven to 350\u00b0 F and lay the bread cubes out in an even layer on two baking sheets. Bake until bread has dried out, rotating sheets halfway through-about 10 to 12 minutes.",
      "Melt butter in a large skillet and add onions, mushrooms, celery, bell peppers, garlic, and salt. Cook until onions are translucent and the mushrooms and peppers are soft. Set aside to cool.",
      "Once the vegetables have cooled enough to handle, transfer them to a very large bowl and add the toasted bread cubes and sausage to the bowl. Roll your sleeves up and mush the mixture together with clean hands, until everything is mixed evenly throughout (this was my favorite part as a kid).",
      "Reserve 5 cups of sausage for stuffing your turkey. Transfer the remaining stuffing to a large casserole dish (10 x 14 inch, or 2 quarts), cover with aluminum foil, and bake on the middle rack of the oven for 40 minutes, basting with chicken stock every 20 minutes or so.",
      "After 40 minutes, uncover the pan and roast until internal temperature reaches 140\u00b0 F, about 25 more minutes (if you aren't sure about the quality of your pork, cook it until the internal temperature is 160\u00b0 F).",
      "Stuff your turkey with the remaining 5 cups of sausage. Cook your stuffed bird until the thickest part of the inner-thigh reads 175\u00b0 F-the stuffing should reach at least 140\u00b0 F."

If using a blender, put the lighter ingredients, like cilantro, in first and the heavier ingredients on top. As you puree the ingredients, the shallots and garlic will release a lot of moisture, but the mixture will still be fairly dry. With this in mind, be sure to use your blender's tamper to help blend the ingredients evenly. If using a food processor, scrape down the bowl regularly to ensure a smooth paste.",
      "Blend until homogenous and fairly smooth. If desired, pack the paste into ice cube trays and freeze. Pop out the frozen cubes and store in a zipper-top bag. You may store some of the fresh paste in a container in the refrigerator, but be sure to use it within two weeks.",
      "When you use the curry paste, start with one frozen cube (or about 2 tablespoons fresh paste) for a curry that will generously feed two people. This will make a moderately spicy, deeply flavorful curry. If you like very spicy curries, you may want to use up to two frozen cubes (or about 1/4 cup fresh paste). Start small and work your way up. To get the best flavor from your homemade curry paste, fry it in a couple tablespoons of coconut milk before adding other ingredients."

Add them to the pot of vegetables and liquid, along with 1/4 cup water, and stir to submerge the noodles as much as you can (it's okay if they're sticking out a tiny bit at the top-they'll slump into the liquid as they cook).

Add a pinch of salt, and reduce the heat to low after 10 minutes. Cover and let cook for another 40 minutes, or until the onion is brown and drastically reduced in size. For the marinara, simply heat olive oil on low and the tomatoes, garlic, salt, and red pepper flakes. Cook for 6 minutes.",

Pour the mixture back into the large mason jar (or other container) and let it cool in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours. Once chilled, you can churn in your ice cream maker or freeze for popsicles. It's best when eaten right after churning, or if frozen hard, after defrosting on your counter twenty minutes before eating. And if you're really feeling frisky, freeze it in ice cube trays, and then puree with some rum!",

Have a taste of the broth. It should taste salty and sweet. Put in more salt if you feel the need. Set aside.",

When it's cool, remove the trays, turn the oven back on to 200 degrees and drizzle the maple syrup evenly across the granola. Stir gently. Bake for an additional 25 minutes, stirring once.

When the granola is cool, store it in covered jars. Enjoy!"

Open the oven and stir the granola on each tray around, taking care to pull the granola sitting along the edges of the trays into the center to avoid having some bits get darker than others. Put the trays back into the over for another 5 minutes. You are going for a nice golden, brown color. If it's not at that color point after to the total of 15 minutes, keep the trays in the oven but check each minute thereafter as this mixture -- with both the sugar and the syrup -- can go dark brown very quickly. When the right color is acheived, pull the trays out of the oven. Once again, give the granola a stir on the tray. This will help ensure it doesn't stick when you need to remove it from the trays. Cool completely. The mixture gets crunchier as it cools.",

Insert a slice of garlic into each of the slits. They should be just wide enough and deep enough to hold the slice of garlic. Sprinkle salt, pepper, and dry mustard over all surfaces of the roast. Rub seasoning in with hands.",

After those 15 minutes, lower oven temperature to 350 degrees F. Continue cooking roast for 15 minutes a pound, including the initial 15 minutes at 450. For a 6 pound roast, this will be 1 hour 30 minutes total. It is very important to include the 15 minutes at 450. Do not open the oven during the cooking process, as this will let heat out of the oven. You should be able to hear the roast sizzling throughout the cooking process.",
      "When the roast is finished cooking, remove it from the oven. Leave it in the pan to rest for about 15 minutes. During this time you may tent the roast, however, this will cause some of the crust to become soggy. The meat will stay quite hot even if not tented.",
      "Once the roast has rested, move it to a serving platter for slicing. Plan on getting three slices from each bone. Take off only the strings you need to in order to cut it, but do make sure to remove them before serving. If the roast is not done enough, place individual pieces back in the oven on a foil lined baking sheet or roasting pan or simply on foil for a few minutes. Be sure to check it often, as it will get done very quickly.",
      "Roast may be stored in the refrigerator for 3 days. It may be eaten cold, or reheated in a 350 degree F oven for about 15-20 minutes on a foil lined roasting pan. The outside will become brown, but when you cut into a piece, it should still be quite pink. Roast the bones for about 30 minutes at 350 degrees F so the meat and fat render and become crispy."

This may make a bit more than you need for the muffins, depending on how big your apple is. Set it aside while you get the rest of the muffin ingredients ready.",
      "Preheat your oven to 400F. Peel the squash and cut it into little pieces (1/2 inch or a bit bigger). Put it on a baking sheet and toss it with the olive oil. Roast the squash in the oven for 15 minutes or so, until it starts to get soft.",
      "In a large bowl, combine 2/3 of the roasted squash pieces, the mustard greens, the herbs, 2/3 of the feta cubes, and the still-warm applesauce (the heat will help collapse the greens into the batter a bit). Mix that all up, and don't worry if the feta crumbles-that's quite alright.",
      "In another bowl, beat together the eggs and the yogurt, and then pour that into the squash and greens and stir it in. Finally, throw in the flours, baking powder, salt, and pepper and mix, making sure to stir in all the dry ingredients (but, as with all baked goods, there's no need to over-mix).",
      "Grease your muffin tin with butter, and be sure to grease it well. Fill the cups all the way full, since the batter doesn't rise dramatically. Take the remaining thirds of the squash and feta pieces, and distribute them over the tops of the muffins, giving them a little poke to make sure they stay on. Bake the muffins for 20-25 minutes, or until a toothpick or knife inserted into the centers comes out clean. Cool them in the pans for a minute or two before transferring them to a rack. They're good when they're fresh, but I think they taste even better cold on the second day."

Stir only until all the dry ingredients are wet, not forgetting the flour at the bottom of the bowl. Pour into the two oiled/floured loaf pans, and place in the middle of the oven. NOTE: For parties I will sometimes pour 1/4 cup of Mrs. Butterworth syrup over the tops of each loaf before baking because most folks like sweeter breads, but for my family, I don't use it (we try to watch our sugar intake). My own oven will bake this in 35 minutes. so set your time for 35, then check the loaves--if the tops spring back when pressed with a finger, they're done. If they seem a little too soft, add 3 minutes at a time (should take no more than 9 minutes more) until done."
