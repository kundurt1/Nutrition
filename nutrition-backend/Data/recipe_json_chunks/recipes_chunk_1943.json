      "As the chocolate melts, you will see some elasticity if there is no fat separation.",
      "This means the chocolate still has an emulsion; the fat molecules are still holding together.",
      "If the ganache separates, it loses its elasticity, collapses, and becomes very liquid.",

      "Do not stir the ganache when you do this.",
      "Incorporating air by stirring will cause the ganache to harden.",
      "Pipe 1-inch-diameter mounds spaced 1 inch apart on a parchment paper-covered baking sheet.",
