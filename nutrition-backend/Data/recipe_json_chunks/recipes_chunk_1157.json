Now add the olive oil, honey, just TWO of the eggs, corn, chives and begin to mix with the dough hook attachment at low speed. As the dough is starting to come together mixing begin adding more of the flour/cornmeal mixture a bit at a time, letting it incorporate along the way - you might not need to use all of it. Keep adding until you achieve a dough that is tacky. It should clear the sides of the bowl but stick to the bottom of the bowl. If the dough is too wet and doesn't come off the sides of the bowl, sprinkle in some more flour just until it clears the sides. If it clears the bottom of the bowl, add a teaspoon or two of water.",

Turn the dough out onto a floured countertop, knead a few times, gather the dough into a ball and rub with a bit of olive oil. Place in a large, greased (olive oil) bowl, cover with a kitchen towl or plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about an hour.",
      "Once the dough has doubled, turn it out onto the countertop. To make the rolls you see in the photo up above, start by cutting the dough into thirds - three big wedges. Pat each third into a square shape and cut each into six pieces - you will end up with 18 equal size pieces. Without over-handling, shape each piece into a ball and place the muffin tins. Let the rolls rise in a warm spot until roughly doubled - another hour. Alternately, if you want to bake two loaves, cut the dough into two equal pieces, shape and place in prepared pans. I imagine, you can also bake this dough freeform if you like.",
      "Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Just before baking whisk the remaining egg and brush on the dough, sprinkle with cornmeal. Bake the rolls for 18-20 minutes on the middle rack, or until rolls are golden. If you are baking loaves it will take significantly longer. Turn out onto cooling racks.

Slowly whisk in 3/4 cup beer until just combined (some lumps will remain).

Whisk in sufficient flour to make a thick roux...do NOT brown the roux! Whisk in the wine and bring to boil whisking constantly. After the alcohol has had a chance to evaporate and as the sauce thickens, add sugar to taste but the sauce should remain slightly bitter as it will lose this bitterness in the oven. Once thickened, pour the sauce over the chicken breasts.",
      "Bake the whole thing, uncovered in a 350 degree oven until you want to eat. 1 hour is usually plenty but this meal is designed to be prepared at your convenience and lowering the temperature and allowing it to sit will not hurt it.",
      "Presentation: I recommend removing the breasts from the sauce onto a cutting board to cool slightly (if cut while too hot they will disintegrate -- I found this out the hard way). Then, slice them into about 1 cm slices so that each slice is a little circle of chicken surrounding the spinach. Press white rice into a small bowl and invert it in the centre of the plate, remove the bowl so a uniform hemispheric mound of rice remains. Arrange the chicken slices in a circle around the rice. Drizzle some sauce over the chicken and rice. Serve remaining sauce in a gravy boat or small pitcher. Remember to keep the sauce warm and don't dilly-dally while cutting -- get it to to the table hot!"

      "1. Preheat oven to 400*F.",
      "2. Season ribs with salt and pepper. Place in a shallow baking pan. Brown in oven 15 minutes. Turn over, and brown another 15 minutes; drain fat.",

      "4. Cover, and cook on Low 6 to 8 hours, or until ribs are tender.",
      "My Note: The genius of this recipe is the first step - roasting ribs in the oven. This removes fat and liquid that would otherwise cause soupy results in the crockpot. Use any sauce (I like 1 Cup ketchup, 1 Cup Stubb's barbecue sauce, 2 Tablespoons. brown sugar, 1 teaspoon Worcestershire, and Tabasco hot sauce to taste.) The original sauce recipe (which I've tried) isn't sharp or hot enough for our tastes. We use boneless beef chuck country ribs, 2 lbs. or more. Stir once during cooking time so ribs don't stick to sides and burn. To thicken sauce a bit, put the crockpot on High, with the lid ajar, during the last half hour.",
      "I didn't care for all the ingredients needed for the results. It tasted similar to what I tend to do for slow cooker ribs. I simplyt seasoned the ribs with garlic salt, onion powder, and black pepper; place in the crock pot and cover the ribs with a half a bottle of KC Masterpiece BBQ sauce. I let the ribs cook on low for about 8-10 hours. Then I place them in the oven on a baking sheet for a half hour so that the sauce caramelizes onto the meat. It works every time!",
      "The sauce tastes alot like ketchup. It is not horrible but it is below average to me. I substituted the 2 cup equivalent of my favorite BBQ sauce for the ketchup and they were delicious. I would also recommend rotating the ribs halfway through the cooking process if possible so that all the ribs are equally tender. This just became my favorite slow cooker recipe.",
      "These were the most incredible ribs I have ever tasted, in or out of a restaraunt! I followed other reviewers' advice and substituted bbq sauce for the ketchup, (2 cups) and ketchup for the chili sauce. (1 cup) I cut back on the vinegar to 2 1/2 tablespoons just because I thought 4 tablespoons was a lot. I also left out the hot sauce, simply because I didn't have any on hand. I used boneless Country Style Ribs. I couldn't get them out of the crock pot in one piece, they were soo tender!",
      "In My son Note's: He said for the crock pot suggestion. Best prep is simmering ribs in water bath (with minced garlic, seasoned salt & Emeril's southwestern spice), for 20 minutes; then prepare BBQ sauce of choice (approx 2 cups), add to drained ribs and cook in crock pot for 5-6 hours on low. Remove from crock pot and brown ribs on grill or under broiler."

Leave the cake in the pan, cover loosely with plastic wrap, and refridgerate until completely cold, at least 4 hours or preferably overnight.",
