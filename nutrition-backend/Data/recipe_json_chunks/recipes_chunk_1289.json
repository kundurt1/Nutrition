Pour 1/4 cup (60 ml) water in slowly until the dough just holds together when pinched. If necessary, add more water. Do not process more than 30 seconds. Turn the dough onto your work surface into a ball. Divide the dough in half, flattening each half into a disk, cover with plastic wrap, refrigerate for about one hour before using. After the dough has chilled sufficiently, remove one portion of the dough from the fridge and place it on a lightly floured surface. Roll the pastry into a 12 inch circle. Fold the dough in half and gently transfer to a 9 inch pie pan. Brush off any excess flour and trim the edges of the pastry to fit the pie pan. Cover and place in the refrigerator. Make the Apple Filling: Combine sliced apples, sugars, lemon juice, ground cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt. Let the apples stand at room temperature for 30 minutes to three hours. Place the apples and their juices in a strainer that is placed over a large bowl. Let the apples drain for about 15-30 minutes or until you have at least 1/2 cup of juice. Pour in the collected juices and butter in bowl in the microwave and boil until liquid has reduced to about 1/3 cup and is syrupy and lightly caramelized. Remove top pastry crust from fridge and let it sit at for about 10 minutes so it has time to soften and become pliable. Transfer the drained apples slices to a large bowl and mix them with the cornstarch. Pour reduced syrup over the apples and toss to combine. Pour apples into chilled pie crust. Moisten the edges of the pie shell with a little water and then place the top crust over the apples. Tuck any excess pastry under the bottom crust. Make five 2-inch slits from the center of the pie out towards the edge of the pie to allow the steam to escape. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Set the pie and bake for about 45 to 55 minutes."

If you're still enjoying the flavor, continue to reuse it. If it gets too watery to adhere well to the vegetables, drain off the excess liquid. Old pickling beds will eventually lose their salty and sweet flavor, but they can still be used as marinades or soup bases.",

Spread the cut vegetables in a single layer, and then place another layer of cloth with the remaining miso mixture spread on top. Once the vegetables are cured to your liking, simply lift off the top layer of fabric and remove the vegetables--no rinsing required.

Bake about 35 minutes or until golden brown. Prepare the syrup by combining the sugar, water, honey and lemon juice and bring to a boil. Simmer 15 minutes. Allow baklava and syrup to cool slightly. Carefully pour the syrup over the baklava and allow syrup to coat each slice of baklava for 30 seconds. Tilt baking pan and pour off excess syrup (which can make baklava sickening sweet). With a sharp knife, cut each serving through to the bottom of the pan. Place each serving of baklava into foil baking cups and prepare to decorate with chocolate: Melt chocolate in a sturdy zip lock bag and cut tip of one corner with a scissors. Decorate the tops of each baklava serving with a quick zig-zag pattern. Enjoy!"

      "Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F. Spray two baking sheets with nonstick cooking spray. Roll out the dough on a lightly floured board to 1/4-inch thickness. Cut out 3-inch circles (use a biscuit cutter). Place a generous spoonful of filling in the center of each circle, then fold up three sides so the cookie looks like a 3-cornered hat, pinching the dough edges together but leaving the center open as shown in the photo. Gather the dough scraps and reroll; cut and fill in the same way. Arrange the cookies on the prepared baking sheets and lightly brush with the egg wash, which will give them a nice color. Bake until the pastry is golden brown-20 to 25 minutes. Transfer the cookies from the baking sheets to wire racks to cool."

In a large nonstick saute pan set over medium heat, heat 2 tablespoons of oil and 1 tablespoon of butter. Add the onion and cook until soft, about 5 minutes. Add the quinoa and cook, stirring constantly, until quinoa smells toasty, about 4 minutes. Add 2 3/4 cups of water and 1 teaspoon of salt, increase the heat to high, and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer until the quinoa is just tender, about 12 minutes. Off heat, sprinkle the asparagus over the quinoa, replace the cover, and set pan aside until quinoa has absorbed all of the liquid and the asparagus is tendercrisp, about 12 minutes. Add the lemon zest and juice, season with black pepper and additional salt, if desired, and stir.

Quickly turn the shrimp and cook until fully opaque, about 45 seconds longer, and transfer to a bowl. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon of oil to the pan, and repeat the process to cook the remaining shrimp. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter to the pan, place over medium-low heat, and when the butter has melted, add the garlic and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 45 seconds. Add the wine and a pinch of cayenne and stir to blend. Return the shrimp and any accumulated juices to the pan, add the parsley, season with salt to taste, and stir to combine. Remove the serving dish from the oven, pour the shrimp and its juices over the bed of quinoa, and serve at once."

      "2 Divide the dough into 2 mounds. Wrap each mound in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 45 minutes to overnight. Let the dough stand for at least 15 minutes before rolling it out.",
      "3 Roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface or between 2 pieces of parchment or wax paper, then place the rolled-out dough in the pie pan and press into place.",
      "4 For pies with tops, brush a little water on the edges of the bottom crust before adding the top crust and crimp the edges of the top and bottom crusts together with your fingers to seal them all around the pie. You can use your fingers, thumb, fork, or the back of a teaspoon to add a design along the ridges. Also, gently lift the edges from the pan a bit (it helps make it easier to cut and serve slices of the baked pie later on). Make little slits in the top crust to allow steam to escape (and add a decorative charm!). Another fun flourish is to add to the top crust little pieces of scrap dough cut out in shapes such as flowers or leaves. Brush the top crust with an egg wash, place on the decorative bits, and sprinkle with sanding sugar (or regular sugar) for a sparkly top.",
      "You can use two butter knives or a fork, or pulse gently with your mixer, or use your fingers. If you want to get a fun and fancy tool, get a pastry blender, also called a pastry cutter. It's a handheld tool, kind of like a potato masher for pastry dough! Whatever you use, I recommend chilling the utensil in the freezer first, so it's nice and cold! It is important that the butter stays as cold as possible, so if you use your fingers, be careful not to warm the butter too much with your hands."

    "title": "small batch jam",
    "ingredients": [],

      "Here's how the technique goes: Cut up the fruit and weigh it. Add an equal weight of sugar. Bring it to a boil on top of the stove and then let it sit overnight to macerate. The next day, finish the jam a couple of cups at a time in a nonstick skillet. Cooked over medium-high heat, it'll set in less than five minutes.",
      "",
      "How do you know when the jam has set? First, you'll feel it. While stirring the jam, you'll feel the texture change from light and liquid to heavier and smoother.",
      "",
      "But the surest way is by watching the way the jam falls from the stirring spoon. When you first start cooking the jam, it will come off in one stream, like water. When it's almost ready, it'll fall off in multiple streams, but still slightly liquid. Cook it 30 seconds or so more and you'll notice that a sheet begins to form at the base of the spoon. That's the moment.",
      "",
      "Remove the jam immediately from the heat and pour it into the storage containers. If you taste now (Careful! It's blistering hot), you'll find that the texture will have a slight cooked-sugar stickiness and the jam will seem too loose. Chill it for a couple of hours and you'll see that it will have set up perfectly and the stickiness will be gone.",
      "",
      "Because different fruits contain different amounts of pectin, you may need to play around a bit. I've used this technique successfully for peaches, plums and nectarines and for strawberries.",
      "",
      "Furthermore, with almost all jams, you're better off using fruit that is slightly under-ripe rather than over (ignore those signs that proclaim \"ideal for canning\"). Under-ripe fruit is higher in pectin and, while it may be a little lower in sugar, that's not really a problem with jam, is it? When I'm sorting fruit to make jam, I usually set any truly ripe fruit aside to make pie."
