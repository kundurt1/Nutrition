Add the chopped up onion and let it cook on medium heat for about 5-10 minutes or until it starts getting soft and translucent. While the onion is cooking, start chopping up the yellow pepper into strips about a quarter of an inch thick and as long or short as you like.",
      "Once the onion is nice and soft, add the yellow pepper. Let that cook for about 10 minutes or more, until it becomes soft. Make sure not to let the veggies burn at all, they should just be nice and soft during the cooking process. You may need to add a little more oil if the 2 tablespoons isnt quite enough to keep everything nicely coated. I usually have enough oil in the pan to let the veggies sort of \"simmer\" in it. You may want to add a little water here and there as well to keep the sauce from getting thick and from burning on the pan. The sauce should be thin enough to spoon onto meat and potatoes but thick enough to keep it's consistency. I usually add the water around the time where the tomatoes are added.",
      "Once the pepper starts getting soft, cut the tomato up into quart inch thick slices, again the length is up to you, and add to the onion and pepper mixture. Let the juices from the tomato cook out into the pan to add some more liquid. I usually lower the temperature on the stove to a nice simmering temp at this point. You can keep the skin on the tomato and let it shrink as the tomato cooks. Once you notice the skin starting to shrink up and almost peel away from the tomato, add the paprika and let it cook a few minutes to let the flavor come out of the paprika. Then add vegeta to taste. I usually add about at least a teaspoon, just depends on how salty and flavorful you like it.",

    "ingredients": [],

      "SALSA:",
      "To make the salsa, rinse the beans in plenty of cold water, put them in a saucepan with enough water to cover, bring to the boil and boil rapidly for 10 minutes. Then reduce the heat and simmer the beans for 30 minutes until tender. Drain and allow them to cool completely before adding all the other ingredients. Then leave them covered for several hours to allow the flavours to develop.",
      "SALMON:",
      "A few hours before you want to cook the salmon, wipe each of the steaks with damp kitchen paper and remove any visible bones using tweezers. Place the salmon on a plate, then, with a pestle and mortar, crush the garlic cloves and rock salt together until you have a creamy puree. Now add the grated ginger, lime zest, cinnamon and cumin, 1 tbsp of olive oil and the chopped coriander, and a good grind of black pepper. Mix everything together and spread a little of this mixture on each salmon steak. Cover with clingfilm and set aside for the flavours to develop and permeate the salmon.",
      "When you're ready to cook the salmon, pre-heat the grill to its highest setting. Brush the baking sheet with olive oil and put it under the grill to heat up. When the grill is really hot, remove the baking sheet using an oven glove, and place the salmon pieces on it. They will sear and sizzle as they touch the hot metal. Position the tray 3 inches (7.5 cm) from the heat and grill them for 7 minutes exactly. Use a kitchen timer as the timing is vital.",
      "Remove them when the time is up and use a sharp knife to ease the skins off. Transfer to warm plates and garnish with sprigs of coriander. Serve immediately with the black bean salsa."

      "When Ready to Cook: Adjust oven rack to center position and preheat oven to 225\u00b0F (107\u00b0C). Place baking sheet with rack and tenderloin in oven and roast until internal temperature registers 120 to 125\u00b0F (49 to 52\u00b0C) on an instant-read thermometer, 2 to 3 hours. Remove from oven and set aside at room temperature for 10 minutes. Cut and remove twine.",
      "To Finish Under the Broiler: Adjust rack to 6 inches from broiler element and preheat broiler to high. Heat butter, swirling, in a medium skillet over high heat until foaming subsides and butter turns a light nutty brown. Add thyme and shallots and stir until crackling stops. Pour butter mixture over tenderloin and spread with a spoon until all surfaces are coated. Remove shallots from top surface of meat. Place pan with tenderloin under broiler and broil, turning every 30 seconds, until meat is well browned on all sides and internal temperature registers 125\u00b0F (52\u00b0C) for rare or 130\u00b0F (54\u00b0C) for medium-rare, about 2 minutes total. Proceed to step 5.",
      "To Finish on the Stovetop: Heat butter, swirling, in a medium skillet over high heat until foaming subsides and butter turns a light nutty brown. Add tenderloin, shallots, and thyme and cook, turning occasionally and spooning hot butter and aromatics over roast, until meat is well browned on all sides and internal temperature registers 125\u00b0F (52\u00b0C) for rare or 130\u00b0F (54\u00b0C) for medium-rare, about 1 1/2 minutes.",

A center-cut beef tenderloin is also called a chateaubriand. Ask your butcher for it, or buy a whole tenderloin and trim it yourself, reserving the ends for another use. Plan on 1/2 pound of meat per person."

Stirring continuously, cook over medium heat for 2 ro 3 minutes untl the paste begins to thin out. Add the warm milk in a steady stream while whisking the mixture, to make bechamel sauce. Add nutmeg to taste. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and let simmer about 10 minutes, strring every few minutes. The sauce should coat the back of a spoon, if it is too thick, add a little more milk. Remove from the heat and cover the surface with plastic wrap until assembling the lasagna to keep a skin from forming.",

Spread what remains of the bechamel evenly over the lasagna and sprinkle with the remaining mozzarella.",

As steaks begin to sizzle, adjust temperature to high heat, gently lift the steaks to prevent sticking and apply pressure to ensure steaks are browning. Repeat process and adjust heat as necessary until steaks are brown (roughly 2 to 3 minutes on each side).",

      "The following guidelines help to determine steak temperature without cutting into the steak and ruining the presentation according to Big Oven: very rare feels soft and squishy, rare is soft to the touch, medium-rare yields gently to the touch, while medium yields only slightly to the touch and is beginning to firm up, and medium-well is firm to the touch.",
      "Safety note per Big Oven: \"Doneness\" is an issue of personal preference. However, it is recommended that beef be cooked to medium-rare doneness, the internal temperature should reach 145 degrees F to ensure that harmful bacteria have been destroyed. A thick cut of beef that has been cooked to an internal temperature of 140 degrees F, may be removed from the oven, loosely covered, and allowed to rest a few minutes. The temperature will continue to rise about 5 degrees F, reaching proper doneness."

    "title": "nutcracker peppermint red velvet cake pops",
    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "Before you begin, you will need to gather the following tools: Nonstick baking spray, silicone popsicle mold, toothpicks, butter knife or fondant tools, wax paper, thin black food safe marker, food safe brushes, 2 piping bags, small round piping tips (I used Wilton #1 & 2), small open star piping tip (I used Wilton 16), any couplers necessary, and a lightweight or fondant rolling pin. *If you'd like to make the white icing from scratch please see the buttercream recipe with my mermaid cake pops. .",
      "To make the cake pops, preheat the oven to 350&deg;F Spray your silicone molds generously with nonstick baking spray, and place them on a baking sheet. In a large mixing bowl add the cake mix, eggs, buttermilk, and red food coloring, and whisk together for 2 minutes. Fold in the crushed peppermint candy. Transfer the batter to either a piping bag or large zip top bag, and cut a small corner off. Pipe the batter into each popsicle mold filling a little less than halfway, then insert the sticks. Bake for 12- 15 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Allow the cakes to cool for 15 minutes in the mold before gently removing and transferring to a cooling rack to cool completely. .",
      "Melt 1 bag of red candy melts at a time in a small heatproof jar (easier for dipping). Start with heating them for 1 minute, in the microwave, at 50% power, and then decrease the time to 30 second intervals, at 50% power, stirring between each interval until the melts are smooth. If they are still lumpy after completely melting you can stir in either paramount crystals (this is what I use) or vegetable oil 1 teaspoon at a time until you reach a smooth consistency. Stir in 1/8 teaspoon peppermint candy oil (per bag of candy melts). Carefully dip each cake pop into the candy shell allowing the excess to drip off, before placing them on a piece of wax paper to set. I like to dip each cake pop twice for an even and smooth coating (toothpicks work great to pop any air bubbles or smooth out any smudges while chocolate is setting).",
      "Time to turn them into nutcrackers! Roll your different shades of fondant out to 1/8 inch thick. Use either a fondant tool or butter knife to cut a rectangle out of the fondant so that it'll cover about half of the cake pop. Smooth it over the top half of your cake pop, using a little water, if needed, to help it to stick. Repeat with the rest of the skin tones and cake pops. .",
      "To make the decorations simpler I am breaking them up into as many little steps as possible, starting with the helmets. Use a toothpick as a guide to section off the rounded top of the fondant covered pop for the top of the helmut, and paint it with the edible gold paint. Roll out the rest of the light fondant, and cut an oval shape, almost like an eye with the pointed corners, for the front of each helmet. Attach below the section you just painted. Paint this piece gold as well. Attach 3 of the gold dragees while the paint is still tacky - 1 to the top middle of the front you just attached, and 1 on either side where the front of the helmet meets the side of the cake pop. (The paint will take a bit of time to air dry, so we will work carefully around it for the next steps). .",
      "Roll a tiny ball of the black fondant between your fingers to form a small log. Place it down on wax paper, and use 2 fingers to carefully squeeze the sides in to form the shape of the tassels (or plumes) for the tops of the hats. Attach to the top of every helmet (use a little water if needed). Attach a small round piping tip to the black decorating icing, and pipe a line following the curve above where you attached the fondant for the hat, and then another right below it. You can add sideways \"v\" designs on either side of the sprinkle in the middle to complete the helmets (please see my image for further explanation).",
      "Next, I like to use a toothpick to carefully outline the sleeves as well as the design in the middle of each jacket. My jacket and helmet designs were inspired by the Nutcracker's costume in The Nutcracker and the Four Realms, please see my images for guidance on replicating the look, or feel free to create your own design. .",
      "Now for my favorite part of all, the hair (it's super fun and easy thanks to that open star tip)! Fit your second piping bag with the open star tip, and add the white frosting. Beginning on either side of the rim of the hat, pipe and release 2-3 lines of frosting to look like the hair coming out from under the helmet. Then, pipe and swirl the frosting to create the curls, Repeat on both sides of the face.",
      "Use the black decorating icing and small round tip to add the eyes, noses, and mouths to each nutcracker. I like to change the faces for each cake pop to give them a bit more personality. You can add tiny highlights to any of the open eyes with the white frosting. For the nutcrackers with only a mustache I added noses and mouths, but I skipped this step if I was going to give them beards.",
      "Add mustaches to all of the characters by beginning right below the nose and piping one side of the mustache, then the other, with the white frosting. Wait until the jackets are complete to add the beards. You can also use the pink decorating icing, and a small round piping tip to create cheeks just under the eyes on each. .",
      "Paint the design in the middle of the jacket. Then use the black decorating icing to pipe around it, as well as to pipe the outline for each sleeve. Pipe the sleeve designs as I did, or get creative with your own. Wait at least 15 minutes for the black icing to set a little before using a thin brush to paint the gold over it. Add 2 gold dragees for buttons (you can use the white frosting, if needed, to attach them).",
      "Add the hands to each nutcracker using the same skin tone fondant as you did for the top of the cake pop. Just roll 2 little balls of the fondant and use a little water to attach them at the bottom of each sleeve. Now is the time to add your beards if you'd like. I created the cute nutcracker teeth using a little white fondant shaped like a semi circle, and I drew the teeth with the food marker before adding the mouth just below the mustache.",

      "Simmer for 40-50 minutes or until peas are tender and most of the liquid has been absorbed. (Check peas periodically - you may need to add more water during cooking if peas are absorbing the liquid too quickly). Garnish with chopped cilantro/coriander leaves before serving.",

      "Update 1/6/2010: Some people have reported issues with the peas taking longer to soften. I have never had an issue but try cooking the onions without salt and waiting until the last 10 minutes or so of cooking time to add the salt. I have heard salt interfers with lentils softening perhaps it is the same for split peas. Curry powder - I usually use a mild Indian yellow variety, the all-purpose kind found in most US supermarkets. But I have also made this with a hot Madras and it was also delicious (but spicy!)."

      "Scoop the egg roll filling out of the pan and place in a baking sheet. Tilt the baking sheet up on one side so all the excess moisture and oil runs to one end. Let cool and drain for 15 minutes. Discard the accumulated juices and blot the filling with paper towels to absorb the excess moisture. This will keep your egg rolls from being soggy.",

Fold the corner over, and roll tightly until just short of halfway up the wrapper. Fold over the left side, and then the right side towards the center. (It will look like an envelope.) Continue folding up with a tuck and roll motion. Dip your fingers into the cornstarch slurry and brush all over the final top corner. Finish up the roll, seal, and place seam side down. The tighter the egg roll the better -- it keeps excess oil from seeping in and keeps them from being greasy. (Keep rolled uncooked egg rolls covered with plastic wrap to keep them from drying out.) At this point, make your dipping sauce while the oil is heating -- it only takes a minute or two.",
