Next liberally coat the pork butts with Jack's Old South Hickory dry rub.Now sprinkle on a generous amount of Brown Sugar and rub it in good. Turn the butt's and repeat the seasoning steps above.",
      "Once the pork butt's are seasoned, wrap them in plastic wrap and refrigerate over night.",
      "Next morning -- Get an early start as this cook may take anywhere from 10 to 14 hours depending on the size of the butt's and the fat content. I started at 5 AM for this cook.",
      "Pre-heat your smoker to 225 degrees. Once the smokers going you can remove the pork butt's from the refrigerator and unwrap them. Pour some Tree Top Apple Juice into a cup. Using a sterile flavor injector, start injecting the the meat every 2\" to 3\" and slowly draw the needle back as you inject. This will evenly distribute the injection throughout the meat.",
      "Once your smoker has come up to temp and the pork is injected place them in your smoker evenly space apart. If your cooker has a hotter area place the largest piece of meats in that area. Now close the lid and let them slow cook for 2 to 3 hours.",
      "Place some apple juice in a clean misting bottle. Use this to mist the Pork butts every 2 to 3 hours. Slow cook the pork butt's until the internal temperature reaches 205 degrees. Then remove them from the cooker and place them in a aluminum pan and cover with foil. let stand 45 minutes to allow the juices to distribute and the meat to cool a bit. Using a fork begin pulling the meat apart. It should pull apart very easy. Pick out and toss any pieces of fat you wish not to consume. Most the fat should be mostly cooked down at this point.",
      "Serve with a pan of beans and you might want to put them in the smoker while the Butt's are cooling. A pan of Honey Cornbread is another great side. If you like your Pulled Pork Memphis style, well pile on some slaw on top of that mountain of pork then add the top bun!"

    "ingredients": [],

      "NOTES: 1) This recipe will make jerky in one day, but the jerky won't keep for very long because it wouldn't have adequate cure time. Refrigerate this jerky and eat it within a month. 2) The Red Savina Powder can be purchased at www.wildpepper.com and is an incredibly hot ground pepper powder. I use it in a ton of different recipes because I love spicy food, but Cayenne powder can be used as a much milder substitute.",
      "Combine the ground meat with all ingredients except the LAST THREE (Liq. Smoke, Whiskey, & Pepper).",
      "Mix the meat and the spices up very well. I use an electric mixer, but a bowl and a wooden spoon work too.",
      "Put the now seasoned meat on a large piece of wax paper. Put another piece of wax paper on top and use a rolling pin to flatten it out until it's about 1/4 inch thick. If little pieces come off the edges, just put them in the middle of your meat slab and roll it out until they're flat again.",
      "Put your liquid smoke and whiskey in an empty spray bottle and shake it up well.",
      "Take off the top piece of wax paper and spray the meat well with the whiskey/liquid smoke mixture.",
      "Sprinkle the coarse ground Black Pepper all over the meat.",
      "Replace the paper with a Fresh piece of Wax Paper.",
      "Flip the entire slab over and repeat the spray and sprinkle step on that side too.",
      "At this point, you're ready to cook. You can use either an outdoor grill, an Oven, a Smoker, or a Dehydrator. Whichever one you choose, you're going to want to transfer the meat slab to something that is slotted/ventilated. Wire jerky trays would be best, but there are many ways to to this.",
      "If you're using the oven or a grill, Try removing the Oven/Grill racks, cover them with aluminum foil, and then use a fork to poke tons of holes in the foil. Spray the foil with Cooking Spray, and put the meat on there.",
      "If you're using a Dehydrator, then you've already got good slotted racks.",
      "For any of these cooking methods, you should cook the jerky at between 150\u00b0 to 200\u00b0 for about 6 to 8 hours or whatever your preferred crispiness is.",
      "For a grill or an oven, if you can't set it for that low of a temperature, use a screw driver or a hammer to prop the door open slightly.",
      "Check the meat after 5 hours and every half hour after that. It will be ready to eat at about 5 hours, but you'll probably like the jerky better if it's more dry than that.",
      "Use a pizza cutter to cut into strips."

      "Drain and rinse beans, pour into a large stew pot.",
      "Add broth (see note 2) and rest of the ingredients, bring to a boil on high stirring every couple of minutes.",
      "As soon as it reaches a boil reduce heat to a very slow simmer, See note 3, Taste the juice and add salt if needed, about 1/2 to 3/4 teaspoon, Taste again, they do not need to be salty but just enough to enhance the flavors, You can always add salt at the table.",
      "Simmer slowly for about 4 hours, stir occasionally and keeping a check on the liquid, it should remain soup like, water is used for any liquid additions but you shouldn't need to thin it, Taste the juice often, Mmm, they just keep getting better, If you want spicier hot beans add more red pepper, or your favorite.",
      "About hour before serving, if the beans are not as soft as you like then turn up the heat to a slow boil with lid on unless you want to thicken the sauce, stir frequently until the beans are soft then return to the low simmer.",
      "Before you are ready to serve, remove the hock, allow it to cool and remove the meat, skin and gristle from the bone, chop the meat up and add it back to the beans, discard the bone, skin, etc, also remove the bay leaf. Taste again and re-season if you like.",
      "To serve, ladle beans into a bowl then ladle some bean juice into the bowl, I love these beans with warm buttered cornbread and skillet fried potatoes, Leftover beans are just as good if not better the next day.",
      "Note 1 - The quick soak method is used sometimes, even by me, Instead of a bowl use the pot you will cook them in, after picking through and rinsing add the water, bring to a full boil, remove from heat, cover and let sit for one hour, Drain and rinse beans and pot, continue with cooking directions, OK, the difference in overnight and quick soaking, The quick soak will leak some of the flavor from beans, I know this because when beans are soaked in cold water overnight the water will be slightly cloudy with very little taste, when quick soaked the water will be brown and taste like beans, The quick soak is accepted and used often though.",
      "Note 2 - I use my own chicken broth but canned may be used (I do that too), be sure to use a no or low salt broth, My chicken broth is also about twice the strength of canned so I dilute mine with half water, be sure to take that in consideration if using homemade, you want a mild chicken broth such as canned. 4 - 14 oz cans plus about 1/2 cup of water will be good.",
      "Note 3 - A very slow simmer is not boiling but you can see very slight movement at the surface, this may take a few adjustments. If you can get this with the lid on great, if not then adjust the lid until you can achieve this, sometimes I have to leave a slight opening in the lid, be sure to add water as necessary to keep it soup like.",
      "Tip - You can raise the heat to a slow boil if you need your beans to cook faster, be sure to stir often, this will cook the beans in about an hour or so and is OK to do, I just like to slow cook mine for hours to blend all the flavors well, when cooked my way there is little visual evidence of onions, peppers etc.",
      "Tip - I have mentioned a couple of times to keep the beans soup like, adding water if necessary, I like my beans to have a slightly thick sauce but thin enough to soak into the cornbread, If you like a thicker sauce then leave the lid off the last hour or so until you reach the desired thickness, remember to turn up the heat slightly because removing the lid will cool down the beans and remember this will intensify the flavors, I have also poured beer in to thin, about 1/2 can, that is good to. With this recipe you should not have to add any liquid.",
      "Tip - If you have found that some beans have stuck to the bottom and scorched, do not scrape or stir the beans now, instead carefully pour the beans into another pot without scraping and continue cooking, this could save the whole pot of beans.",
      "Tip on meat - I use different types of meat, depending on my mood, ham bone with some ham left on it, many types of sausage, pork loin, beef, venison, I have even used chicken with good results, Meat with the bone on such as hocks will produce a little meat in the beans, feel free to add meat if desired, such as for Red Beans and Rice*, when using raw meat I like to brown the meat in the pot with a little oil before adding the beans, then add the beans and liquid.",
      "*Red Beans and Rice is a favorite for me, instead of using pinto beans use small red kidneys, keep the ham hock and add 1/2 to 1 pound of good smoked pork sausage such as andouille or kielbasa, serve in a bowl over cooked rice.",
      "Hey, beans are simple and very versatile, don't let this recipe scare you, don't want onions, then leave them out (although that is against the law here in TX), you want jalapeno peppers instead of bell pepper go for it, leave out the tomato sauce if you like, water instead of broth, well that is your loss but they are still good, unless you over-do the flavors it is hard to go wrong, this recipe is really just a guide on how to cook them, use whatever you prefer in them and enjoy."

      "The Empanada.",
      "Now, if you have a tortilla press, you're sitting pretty for the next step. If you don't have one, two pieces of 1\" wood about 8\" square will do just fine. Lacking that, anything flat and a counter top will work. Or, if you feel adventurous, you can use your own two little hands!",
      "Roll the \"masa\" (dough) into little balls about 1\" in diameter. Place the masa ball on top of a piece of plastic wrap or wax paper. Cover with another piece of plastic or wax paper and press it into a flat circle (depending on the size of the original masa ball, the flat circle will turn out to be about 3 to 4 inches in diameter). Remove the top piece of plastic. Now add about one rounded tablespoon of the filling to the middle of the circle leaving about 1/2\" of space on the sides. Using the plastic, fold the circle in half and press the edges together so it forms a half-moon. Remove from the plastic and, using your fingers, press the edges firmly together so the empanada is sealed. I like to make them pretty so, after the empanada is sealed, I take the tip of my finger and fold the edges at small intervals so that the empanada has a \"scalloped\" look to the edges.",
      "Cook them in bunches but don't prepare too many at a time and let them sit while the others cook since this tends to dry out the masa too much. Also, as you are cooking, keep the bowl of masa covered with a humid towel to keep it from getting too dry.",
      "Cooking.",
      "The traditional method, of course, is to fry the empanadas in a large, iron cauldron (approximately 50 years old), on top of a wood fire, outdoors, in about twenty pounds of pork lard that was used to fry the empanadas for the last month and a half.",
      "However, tradition does not always mean that it is right. Most of the time tradition simply means \"lack of technology and alternate methods.\".",
      "I use a deep-fat fryer filled with Canola or Peanut oil. For even healthier empanadas, they can be baked in the oven at 350 degrees F on a greased cookie sheet. Baking them, of course, takes longer and you will have to turn the empanadas once. Bake or fry until golden brown.",
      "If you fry them (the best method because they turn out nice and crunchy), make sure you place the finished empanadas on a cookie sheet whose bottom you have lined with a thick layer of paper towels. This will allow the excess oil to drain.",
      "The tradition in Colombia is to have an empanada in one hand and a wedge of lemon in the other. As you take a bite, you squeeze a few drops of lemon juice inside. A bowl of your favorite salsa and a teaspoon will also do the job quite well. This recipe should yield approximately 4 to 5 dozen empanadas.",
      "Waste not, want not.",
      "I made a bunch of empanadas the other day and found that I had mad way too much masa for the amount of filling I had. I did not want to waste the masa nor did I want to put it in the refrigerator until the next time I made empanadas. So, I thought about it for a while. I had about two pounds of masa left so I added a large package of shredded Monterey Jack cheese, a whole lot more cumin, some more onion powder and garlic powder and a little more salt. I then browned one pound of ground sausage and added it to the mixture.",
      "I rolled the mixture into 1\" balls and deep fried them. They were great! I love it when my weird experiments turn into new recipes!"

      "Add the salt and flour. Lightly beat 2 of the eggs with the milk and add this mixture to the bowl. Melt 3 tablespoons of the butter and add this as well. Have the remaining 1/4 cup warm water ready. If you are mixing by hand, add some of the water and begin to mix, adding the water as needed. If using an electric mixer, attach the dough hook and jog the machine (turn it on and off) until the dough begins to form. This prevents the flour from jumping out of the mixing bowl. Add the remaining warm water as needed; the dough usually takes the full amount. When a soft dough has formed, knead for 5 minutes by machine or about 8 minutes by hand. This is a soft bread and does not require as much kneading as chewier types The finished dough should be soft but dense and should NOT be sticky.",
      "Shape the dough into a ball and lightly oil it with the salad oil. Place it in a large bowl. Cover with plastic wrap or a slightly damp towel and let rise in a warm place for about 1 hour until doubled in bulk.",
      "Punch the dough down and move to a work surface. Lightly dust the work surface with flour. Shape the dough into a square. Using a knife, cut the dough into 12 equal pieces.",
      "With the remaining 1 tablespoon butter, lightly grease a baking sheet that is at least 15 inches long. Shape the dough into uniform 7-inch-long tubular pieces. It is important that all the pieces be the same length. Place the tube in a line, side by side, down the center of the baking sheet, leaving a 1/2-inch gap between them. Put the pan in a warm place and let rise a second time.",
      "Prepare a thick egg wash by mixing the remaining egg with 2 tablespoons water. After 15 to 20 minutes, the tubes of dough will have risen enough that they will be touching.",
      "Generously brush the tubes with egg wash, return the pan to the warm spot and let the dough rise until almost doubled in size, 10 to 15 minutes. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.",
      "Place the buns in the oven and bake for about 30 minutes until deep golden brown.",
      "Let the buns cool on the baking sheet for at least 15 minutes, then run a spatula under them to make sure they are not sticking to the pan. Using 1 or 2 spatulas, carefully lift the baked dough in one piece onto a rack to cool. It is crucial that you not let the buns break or tear apart. After an hour, when the baked dough is completely cooled, move it in one piece to a cutting board. Using a serrated knife, slice down the center of each tube. You will lose half a tube on each end (which is why you need 13 tubes to make 12 buns). The place where the tubes met is now the center of each bun. They will open naturally when it comes time to stuff them, but you can make a small incision to ensure that this happens.",
      "Wrap the buns in plastic wrap until ready to use. If you do not intend to use all 12 buns, freeze the extras and defrost when needed.",
      "COOK'S NOTE: To infuse the dough with the delicate flavor of saffron, chop 1 teaspoon saffron threads and add to 1/4 cup water in a small pan. Bring the mixture to a boil over medium-high heat, then remove from the heat. Let cool to lukewarm and substitute for the 1/4 cup water added for mixing. Since the dough will be golden to start with, look for a dark brown top before removing from the oven."

      "My Note: Double the recipe because its going to go fast! I substituted Sierra Nevada Pale Ale for the water, and did not add liquid smoke since the pulled pork was naturally smoked. The sauce adds a tangy finish to the meat with balanced flavors of spice, pepper, vinegar and sweetness without overwhelming or hiding true natural flavors of smoked meats.",
      "I have used a beer mustard in one version, and this worked well on chicken breasts. We have even tried it on deep fried chicken wings and it makes for a tastey sauce.",
      "Sometime one of my thing I did different is vodka instead of water, it really helped bring out the spices. Make sure you have time to let it sit in the fridge overnight. That's where the real magic occurs. It helps thicken the ingredients and allows the spices to blend. It will also lessen the vinegar and mustard tones. Finally, when tasting, there are about 3 to 4 levels of flavors. WOW! It is spicy but not really hot. There is a pepper taste but not over bearing. Tangy but yet sweet. Excellent on everything! Pork, Chicken, Beef, add to a rice dish. It makes everything taste new and exciting. Make sure you double your recipe because this is truly addictive. Nothing store bought begins to compare, for taste.",
      "One of my kids did not have the liquid smoke, so she completely omitted that ingredient, and she did add some ketchup at the end of the cooking process to cut the mustard flavor a little bit. The family loved it and said it was the best bbq sauce they ever had! I will say it is a bit spicy, but that is A-OK with us!",
      "My grandson substituted the water with apple juice and added a little more cayenne pepper and garlic powder to spice up the flavor! Great sauce and easy to make!",
      "Last Note: Of course there are differences between marinades, mops, sops, finishing sauces, etc. Sauces are used throughout the barbecue and grilling process, but you need to be careful with sauces that contain a lot of sugar since they can burn at high temperatures."
