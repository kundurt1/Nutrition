      "Pour in the water, cover, and cook on low for about 6 hours, or until a fork easily pierces the stem end of the choke or a leaf can easily be pulled off.",
      "Meanwhile, prepare the stuffing or mayo.",
      "To make the stuffing, break up the bread slices and put them in the bowl of a food processor.",
      "Pulse until the bread is in large crumbs.",
      "Add the parsley, garlic, tomato, lemon juice, olive oil, and salt to taste and pulse until thoroughly mixed.",

      "(It is important to let the artichokes cool somewhat before attempting to remove the chokes so that you do not burn your fingers.)",
      "If you are using the stuffing, spoon some of the stuffing into each cavity.",
