IMPORTANT Let the pressure escape on it's own, do NOT release pressure quickly or the meat will seize up, get tough and lose moisture. Other methods work great, just make sure to deglaze the searing pan so you can use that flavor in the cooking process. Crock pot or slow cooker, 6 hours. Oven braise 325 for an hour and a half, covered, until meat reaches 160 and falls apart, not my favorite method. Grill it up, shred, dump the sauce over the top. Your choice, the pressure cooker works the best for us.",

      "RICE PUDDING: Rinse the Arborio rice several times until the water runs clear. This is very important, so that rice will be evenly overcooked and there will be no al dente grains.",
      "In a heavy saucepan, bring the 2 cups water, a pinch of salt and the cinnamon stick to a simmer over high heat. Add the rice and simmer until it has absorbed the water, about 10 minutes.",
      "Stir in the half and half and bring the mixture to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to a very gentle simmer and cook for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally (be sure to stir the bottom of the pan to prevent the rice from sticking; if it burns, you will need to start over). Depending on how quickly the rice absorbs the liquid, you may need to add a little more water or half and half as needed.",
      "Stir in the cream, brown sugar, condensed milk and vanilla extract. Continue to simmer gently, stirring frequently, until the rice is very thick and creamy (it should have no \"bite\" whatsoever), about 20 to 30 minutes. Remove from heat.",
      "While the mixture is still very hot, adjust the consistency as needed with additional cream (it should be rather thin, as it will thicken dramatically as it cools; it will be easier to finish the rice for service if it is not too thick). Taste the rice and adjust the flavor with more salt and/or sugar as desired.",
      "CARAMEL: In a medium saucepan, combine the sugar and water. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer until the mixture caramelizes to a light golden brown. (Do not stir the sugar once it begins to bubble, and brush the sides of the pan with water to keep the sugar from crystallizing - if it crystallizes, you will need to start over.)",
      "While the sugar is cooking, combine the orange peel and cream in a small saucepan over high heat. Scald the cream, then remove from heat.",
      "When the sugar has caramelized, add the butter and stir slowly with a wooden spoon, being careful not to seize the caramel. Slowly add in the hot cream, being careful of the hot steam. Season the caramel with a pinch of salt, and reserve in a warm place. This makes a scant 1 cup caramel.",
      "ALMOND BRITTLE: Heat the oven to 350\u00b0F Butter a rimmed sheet pan and set it aside. Toss the almonds with the olive oil and a sprinkling of fleur de sel. Place the almonds on a baking sheet (not the buttered pan) and toast until golden and aromatic, about 4 to 6 minutes. Set aside in a warm place.",
      "While the almonds are toasting, in a small heavy-bottom saucepan over medium-high heat, combine the sugar and water and cook until the mixture begins to boil. (Use a small brush dipped in cold water to brush down sugar crystals that cling to sides of pan.).",
      "Boil the sugar without stirring until a candy thermometer inserted reads 310 F (hard-crack stage); the sugar should be golden. Remove from heat and stir in the warm toasted almonds and baking soda, if using.",
      "Immediately pour the mixture onto the buttered sheet pan, spreading it into an even layer with a metal spatula. Sprinkle over a pinch of fleur de sel, then set the mixture aside until hardened, about 30 minutes. Break the brittle, crushing it to desired consistency.",
      "FINAL ASSEMBLY: Spoon the chilled rice pudding base into a large bowl and fold in whipped cream until the mixture has achieved a sufficiently fluffy and light consistency (this makes a generous 6 cups pudding). Spoon the pudding into bowls and garnish with the warm caramel and crushed almond brittle. Serve immediately."

      "5. Start at a high heat of 500 degrees for 15 minutes, turn the oven down to a lower temperature of 325 degrees for the remainder of the cooking time. As long as you have the thermometer in the meat, you will not over cook it. If your oven only goes to 450 degrees, that will work fine. Insert the thermometer from the side, it will be easier to find the center without hitting the ribs.",
      "Allow 13-15 minutes per pound for rare, 15-17 minutes per pound for medium rare. Use the guide below to set your thermometer, this is not a cut of meat to guess when it's done.",

Cook the roast in a 500 degree oven for 5 minutes per pound (for medium rare) and than shut the oven off and let it cook for 1 full hour. It's very important to not open the oven during this time. Let the meat rest before carving."

Depending on your preference, you can leave all of the remaining chorizo grease in your pot or drain some off to reduce the fat.",
      "Saute the celery, shallots, and garlic to the chorizo grease until the mixture begins to soften, about 5-10 minutes. Meanwhile, take your washed and stemmed kale and tear it into small, rough pieces and set aside.",
      "Add the soaked and rinsed beans to the vegetable mixture and the chicken stock. Set heat on high and bring to a boil. Boil for about 20 minutes, or until the beans begin to soften. Add the kale, potatoes, and chorizo to the pot, stir well, and let it return to a boil, continue to boil for another 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. If soup looks too thick, thin down with water or chicken stock and taste to see if more seasoning is needed. Remember, the beans and potatoes will soak up some of the liquid and soup will thicken during the canning process. At this point, I like to add 2 tablespoons of garlic chile hot sauce, since beans do tend to makes soups a little bland after canning. Ladle into prepared jars and pressure can for 1 hour and 20 minutes for pints and 1 hour and 30 minutes. This recipe will make about 8 pints, if not a little more.",
      "To serve soup, pour soup into a sauce pan and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Stir in 1/2 cup each of water and heavy cream or milk per pint, 1 cup each per quart, simmer to heat through and serve. Goes especially well with garlic bread for dipping.",
      "-Tip- Cut the celery and shallots fairly small, but cut the potatoes to a larger dice, appx a half to 3/4 inch, so they are not so likely to fall apart during the cooking process."

Sincere apologies to my loyal fans who depend on me for made-from-scratch recipes. Also, it's worth mentioning I made two cakes-one using a standard 9\" pie pan and the other using a 9\" cast iron skillet. The cake baked in the cast iron skillet turned out far better. To remove the cake from the pan *after it has cooled completely*, first take a knife and run along the edge of the pan to loosen. Place a wire cookie rack over the top of the pan, invert carefully and set aside. I used two spatulas and carefully moved the cake from the wire rack to the cake serving plate to frost it. This method worked best for this inexperienced cake baker. Two cakes were made in case of any mistakes. The second cake was cut in half then in half again and made into \"baby butterflies\".",

You could boil the milk for a short while, if you like, because this would caramelize the milk sugar a bit and actually enhance the flavor, since French Vanilla is actually a combination of vanilla with a caramel overtone. I just heated the milk and water in two batches in a 2 cup (1/2 liter) Pyrex cup in the microwave (1-2 minutes). Just make sure the liquid is not too hot, because powdered milk does not mix well with boiling liquid. If you boil the milk, let it cool considerably before using.",

      "If you want to use the light brown sugar but only have white, you can add up to 1 T of molasses, refiner's syrup or dark corn syrup. I suppose you could even use maple syrup, but that will obviously change the taste complex. Of course, you might like that!",
      "This could be made with all water and 2 1/3 times the milk powder. However, to enhance the creaminess, the butter or butter substitute should be doubled, as most milk powder is non-fat.",
      "I like a lot of milk in coffee, so these proportions work for me. If you use less milk or creamer in your coffee, but want it sweeter, you could add as much as 50% more sugar.",
      "Alternative flavors: Replace the Vanilla with Almond Extract; Almond and some Orange Extract; Rum Flavoring, Hazelnut or Black Walnut or whatever you desire. The cinnamon should not overpower the vanilla in this version, but feel free to double or triple the cinnamon if you like it. Try replacing the Vanilla with double that amount of Pumpkin Pie Spice mix. There are no rules here! Experiment with the flavors you enjoy, but within the flavoring quantities listed.",
      "Nutritional Considerations: Of course, the sugar is not the best thing for you. But, there doesn't seem to be any reason why you couldn't replace the sugar with one of the \"measure for measure\" sugar substitutes either, though I haven't tried it yet. The idea of using the milk powder is that it increases the creamy taste, and doubles the milk solids & proteins of the milk (known as \"Tiger's Milk\") without increasing the fat content. I used a butter substitute spray made from olive oil, so that helps. Lactose intolerant persons could add \"Lactaid\" enzyme, I suppose, though I assume few people would have a problem with an ounce, or so, of a lactose containing product."
