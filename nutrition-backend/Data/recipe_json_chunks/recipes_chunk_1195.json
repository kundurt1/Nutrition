Cover and refrigerate until using.",
      "I find it best of you put batter into a squeeze bottle for less mess. Heat pan over medium high heat and brush the wells generously with melted butter. When they begin to sizzle, fill each well 3/4 full of batter, starting with the middle, then going to the top and clockwise so that you can remember the order to flip them and they cook evenly.",
      "You can stuff these in all sorts of ways! Top the center of each well of batter with a dab of cream cheese, or a chunk of manchego cheese sprinkled with rosemary for savory ebelskivers. For sweet ebelskivers, try a slice of banana sprinkled with brown sugar, or 3-4 chocolate chips. Once they are stuffed, then cover stuffing with batter, taking care not to over-fill the well.",
      "Cook for 2-4 minutes, or until the bottoms of the ebelskiver are browned. Use two long wooden skewers or chopsticks to carefully flip them over. Cook for another 2-3 minutes until they are evenly browned.",
      "The ebleskivers are done when they are golden all over and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with only a few crumbs attached. Remove the puffs from the pan, wipe the wells with paper towel to remove crumbs, brush the wells with more butter and repeat with the remaining batter. This recipe should make about 3 pans of ebleskivers.",
      "Eat the sweet ebleskivers warm either sprinkled with confectioner's sugar or drizzled with chocolate sauce; the manchego/rosemary ones drizzled with honey, and you can go any direction with the cream cheese - get crazy and drizzle with warm jam! If you are making lots, you can keep the ebleskivers warm by placing them an oven preheated to 200\u00b0F and covered loosely with foil."

But I like chunky jam and I have found that the strawberries melt during the boiling time if I mash them first. So I prefer to do this after boiling. This way I have more control of the final fruit size B. In summer we freeze lots of strawberries for me to make jam in fall for xmas baskets. Once they are unfrozen there is juice already, so I skip the overnight process. C: Just an FYI, If you use store bought bagged frozen strawberries, since they are cut more then half and are not fresh they break down even faster during the boiling time. D. You can also make this with low sugar pectin or no sugar recipes, just follow the fruit/sugar qty's on the pectin boxes instructions."

Add the capers, stir to dis- tribute, and cook for another minute.",

Simmer gently until the cauliflower is tender enough to be easily pierced with the tip of a knife, 15 to 20 minutes. If the liquid threatens to dry up at any point, add a splash of water.",

Knead for 10-12 minutes. Dough should be a little sticky, but manageable.",
      "To prevent from sticking spread Butter-Flavored Crisco on the counter (I have used butter and regular Crisco as well) Do not use flour in place of the Crisco. More flour will make the cinnamon rolls too heavy. Roll out dough on the counter in a rectangle about 1/2 inch thick, 14 inches wide and 30 inches long. Spread with one cube (1/2 cup) butter, 1 cup sugar mixed with 3 tablespoons cinnamon, and 1-2 cups brown sugar crumbled. Carefully roll up into long roll trying not to stretch the dough. Cut the rolls about 3/4 thick with a sharp knife, using a gentle sawing motion ( I use a piece of dental floss to cut the rolls ). Place on a greased cookie sheet (bakers half sheet) one dozen per sheet. (Lorna bakes them on parchment paper sprayed with Pam. I bake them straight on the cookie sheet sprayed with Pam and no parchment, and they come out great.) The recipe fills 3 large cookie sheets (3 dozen rolls). Let them raise until they are touching on all sides. Bake at 375 degrees until golden brown on top. Approximately 15-18 minutes. (My oven takes 20-22 minutes.) Test doneness by gently pressing down on center of a roll. If it springs back without sinking, they are done."

You can use smaller patties, but you will need to adjust your cooking time accordingly. Burgers with fillers or lesser quality beef are not recommended. You'll be rewarded for spending a bit extra for quality hamburger patties.",
      "Spray your electric grill with garlic flavored cooking spray. Close and heat for 5 minutes.",
      "After 5 minutes, place your frozen patties on your grill. Close and cook for 3 minutes.",
      "While your burgers are cooking, cover the insides of each bun with butter and garlic. Place your buns buttered sides up in an un-greased non-stick baking pan and set them aside for the moment. If you prefer, you can use sliced Italian Bread instead of Hamburger Buns.",
      "When your burgers have cooked for 3 minutes, open your grill, season both sides of each pattie with Italian Seasoning. Close your grill and cook 3 more minutes.",
      "After the additional 3 minutes have passed, open your grill and place a whole onion slice over each burger. Sprinkle a bit more Italian seasoning over each onion slice. Close your burger and cook for a final 2 minutes.",

      "When your burgers are done and your sauce is heated, remove your patties from your grill and place them in your sauce. Top each pattie liberally with shredded Italian cheese. Spoon sauce over the patties until they are covered, then place the bowl in the microwave and heat on high for about 1 minute (until the cheese melts).",
      "When your cheese is melted, lift each burger from your sauce, allow excess sauce to drip off, then place each on the bottom portions of your buns and sprinkle with grated Parmesan Cheese. Lightly spoon about a teaspoon of sauce on the inside top portion of your bun. Serve your Sandwiches open-faced with a few celery sticks (no fries or potato chips), fresh spring onions, and/or Roma Tomato slices on the side. Your guests can put their sandwiches together as they marvel about the savory aroma and your artful presentation. Have extra patties available. Your guests will want more."

To freeze up to 2 months, wrap the cake pan tightly in several layers of plastic wrap and aluminum foil. Use a large piece of masking tape and an indelible marker to label and date the contents. If frozen, defrost overnight in the refrigerator and bring to room temperature at least 30 minutes before serving."

      "*NOTE* I used a mustard called Bone Suckin' Sweet Hot Mustard which I bought at a local kitchenware store (Lakeland Ltd.) here in the UK. It contains ingredients such as molasses, brown sugar and jalapeno peppers. You can use a similar type of mustard if you can find one or just use dijon. However, I think that a bold flavored mustard like the one I used is what really brought this dish together. If you try this recipe and review it, please let others know what type of mustard you used."

Remove from oven, sprinkle olive oil across seeds and toss in a bowl. Add more salt or spices according to your preference."

Ten minutes before turning heat off, pour off rest of shoyu mixture. Serve with chopped green onions and Chinese parsley. Bake 325 degrees for 1 hour or less depending on how well you like your meat. Medium is best. This is also a great for grilling on the BBQ. Makes about 6 servings.",

Set on cooling racks to cool. Let the cakes cool completely before attempting to stack.

      "Cut the butter into small cubes. In a small microwaveable bowl, combine the chocolate chips and butter. Melt in the microwave for 20-30 seconds at a time until smooth. Be careful not to boil he chocolate as it will change the consistency of the mousse and make a huge mess in the microwave.",

      "Remove metal bowl from freezer, combine chocolate/butter mixture and remaining heavy whipping cream using a hand mixer. Whip until smooth and firm peaks begin to form.

      "Putting the cake together:",
      "Put a small amount of mousse and spread it in the center of the pan or plate you are making the cake on, this will keep it from moving while you frost it.",
      "Place the first layer of cake on top of the mousse, cover the top of the cake with mousse mixture. Repeat by stacking the next layer on top of the mousse. Using a cake knife or smooth spatula, cover the outside of the cake with mousse (the same way you apply frosting to a cake). Using a decorating bag filled with remaining mousse mixture, decorate the edges and top of the cake. If the mousse starts to melt or if your work space is warm, you may need to move mousse back to the refrigerator between layers to prevent it from melting). You can also use shredded coconut, chocolate chips, or chocolate shavings if you prefer for decoration.",
      "Refrigerate until ready to serve and left overs. I refrigerated mine over night before serving and it was still delicious and moist for 3-4 days after cutting."
