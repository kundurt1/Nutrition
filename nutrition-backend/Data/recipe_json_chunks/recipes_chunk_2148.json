      "Do not move or flip the steak any more than necessary, as this will prevent it from searing.",

      "Rather than cutting into the steak, which causes all the flavorful juices to run out, learn to judge the steaks doneness based on the way it looks and feels when you touch it with your thumb.",
      "Rare steak is jiggly and fleshy; medium-rare is less fleshy but still a little jiggly, and well-done steak feels firm and muscular.",
      "If you arent yet confident in your ability to test doneness this way, insert an internal thermometer in the steak and remove the steak from the grill when it reads 110F to 115F for rare, 120F to 125F for medium-rare, and 130F to 135F for medium.",
      "Always let the steak rest for at least 5 minutes, loosely covered.",
      "This seals in the juices so they dont run out when you cut into it.",

    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "Arrange a rack in the middle of the oven with a baking stone on it, if you have one.",
      "Preheat the oven to 375.",
      "If the crostata dough is very cold, let it soften at room temperature for a few minutes while you make the filling.",
      "Rinse the plums and pat dry.",
      "Cut them in flat halves, following the natural line around the fruit through the stem end, and remove the pits.",
      "Toss the halves with the lemon zest, apricot jam, and butter bits in a mixing bowl.",
      "(If youre making the crostata with large plums or fruit like peaches or nectarines, cut in quarters or wedges.)",
      "Toss the bread crumbs, sugar, and cinnamon together.",
      "On a lightly floured board, start stretching the dough into a circle, rolling from the center in all directions.",
      "Turn the dough over as it stretches, and flour the work surface as needed.",
      "Cut a piece of parchment that will cover your baking sheet.",
      "Roll the circle of dough to a diameter of 15 inches, and lay it, centered, on the parchment.",
      "Now trim the outside edges of the dough, with a sharp knife or scissors, cutting away ragged or thin spots and making as perfect a round as you can, since this edge will be visible on the top of your crostata.",
      "Keep the circle at least 13 inches in diameter.",
      "Lift the parchment with the dough on it to the baking sheet.",
      "Sprinkle about 1/3 cup of the bread-crumb mix in a 7- to-9-inch-diameter circle in the center of the dough, as a base for the fruit.",
      "The bread crumbs will soak up the juices, so if you have very ripe and juicy fruit (like peaches) use more crumbs, to form a thicker layer; if using a drier fruit, like apricots, use less crumbs.",
      "Arrange the coated plum halves, cut side up, on top of the crumb base.",
      "I place them in concentric rings, starting from the outside, and lean each inner ring on the plums just outside.",
      "In this manner, with a larger, 8- or 9-inch base of crumbs, you should be able to fit all the plums in one layer, for a crostata with an even height.",
      "If the crumb base is smaller, youll need to pile up the fruit.",
      "This will give the crostata more of a dome shape (as in the photo).",
      "When youve assembled your fruit in the middle of the dough, fold the uncovered band of pastry on top of the fruit, as shown in the photo.",
      "The width of the band will vary with your arrangement of the plums, but you should have at least 2 1/2 inches of dough to form the pleated top crust.",
      "Finally, sprinkle 1 or more tablespoons of sugared bread crumbs over the visible fruit in the center.",
      "As before, use more crumbs on juicy fruit.",
      "If you have any left over, sprinkle them over the pleated dough.",
      "Put the baking sheet with the crostata in the oven, on the stone if using one, and bake for 25 minutes; rotate the pan back to front for even cooking.",
      "Continue baking, and check the browning of the crust after 40 minutes: it should be light gold.",
      "If it is getting quite dark, you may need to lay a piece of foil on top.",
      "Bake for another 15 minutes or more, until the fruit is bubbling and has caramelized on the edges.",
      "If youve filled the crostata with a mound of fruit, youll probably want to bake it more than an hourand cover the topto make sure all the fruit is cooked.",
      "Let the crostata cool on the baking sheet for about 15 minutes or more before lifting it, with the parchment, to a wire rack to continue cooling.",
      "When it has set, slide it off the parchment, supported by long patulas, onto a platter.",
      "Serve warm or at room temperature, cut into wedges, with whipped cream or vanilla ice cream, if you wish.",
      "Put the flour, sugar, and salt in the bowl of a food processor fitted with the metal blade, and process for a few seconds to mix the dry ingredients.",
      "Cut the butter into 1/2-inch pieces, drop them onto the flour, and pulse the machine ten or twelve times, in short bursts, 20 seconds in all.",
      "The mixture should be crumbly, with only a few larger bits of butter visible.",
      "Sprinkle 3 tablespoons of water on top of the dough; immediately pulse about six times, only a second or two each time.",
      "You want the crumbs to gather together in wet clusters, a bit like cottage-cheese curdsdont expect a mass of dough to form.",
      "If they havent gathered, sprinkle on more water, a teaspoon at a time, and pulse two or three times after each.",
      "When the clusters form, scrape them all out of the bowl, press them together, and knead just for a few seconds to form a smooth, tight dough.",
      "Flatten it into a disk, wrap well in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for 3 hours or up to a day before using.",
      "Freeze the dough for longer keeping.",
      "(If the crumbs havent clustered after youve added 4 tablespoons of water, open the top and press them with your fingers; if theyre wet and stick together, just empty the bowl and press them into a disk of dough.)",
      "For this crostata, as for many desserts, I encourage you to use ripe fruit.",
      "But it concerns me that it is difficult these daysunless you have your own orchardto get fruit that can truly ripen as nature intended.",
      "Much, perhaps most, of the fruit in our markets is engineered for commercial needs, for shipping and shelf life.",
      "It is bred to remain in a green, immature state for a prolonged period.",
      "This keeps the cellulose intact, so the fruit is firm when its shipped, when its on display, and when its in your kitchen.",
      "But fruit is not supposed to stay young.",
      "It has to ripen, to mature, and to dieand thats when it is at its best.",
      "Whether a pear, an apricot, a fig, or a berry, I want it precisely when its maturity has peaked and it begins to diethen the cells literally burst and release all their aroma and the flavor compounds of their mature development.",
      "The explosion in your mouth of a fruit at its moment of death, so to speak, is one of the great experiences we should have with food.",
      "I guess I learned this when I was six or seven and we were sent to find the ripest figs.",
      "I remember looking at every fruit on all the branches, searching for ones that were split, on the verge of overripeness and fermentation.",
      "Out of the cracks, I had learned, would come a drop of the figs essence, an elixir as sweet as honey.",
      "This made an impression on me Ive never forgotten.",
      "At my home today, right outside the kitchen window, is a fig tree.",
      "And whenever Im at the sink, I find myself automatically looking for figs ready to explode.",
      "And then I can tell my grandchildren what I learned when I was their agethat is, if I can get them to stop racing up and down the driveway on their tricycles!"

      "Catch the loose edge on the grill first and guide the remaining dough into place over the fire.",

      "NOTE: There are several traps and difficulties that with experience you will overcome.",

      "Don't despair however if small holes do appear.",
      "Though you cannot repair them, you can work around them.",

      "Work as close to the grill as possible so the dough is without support for a minimum amount of time.",
      "If after 8 minutes the cheese has not melted and the topping is not bubbling, either you have been too cautious in your approach to the coals, or you have used too much cheese and topping ingredients.",
      "A longer time on the grill will only dry out the pizza and toughen it.",
      "The ideal crust should be both chewy and crisp.",
      "Do not be timid about the preparation of this pizza.",
      "From start to finish, the bold act will reward you with a first rate pizza."
