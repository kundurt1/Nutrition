      "Soak peas overnight. Remove the husks by rubbing between hands until they are loose. Place peas in water again and the husks will rise to the top. Pour them off. Grind peas, garlic and peppers to a very fine paste. Save drippings from grinder and add along with the salt. Add a little water if necessary. Beat the mixture with electric beater until it becomes creamy. Drop by the spoonful into hot deep fat and fry until brown (just as you would hush puppies)."
