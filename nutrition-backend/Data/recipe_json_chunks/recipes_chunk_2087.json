      "To prepare the butter mix: Cut each stick of butter into eight pcs, place on working surface, sprinkle with the flour, then rapidly work the butter between your hands-smearing it, then gathering it up-for a minute or possibly two, till it is smooth, creamy, and spreadable, but still cool.",
      "It should be about the texture of chilled vegetable shortening.",
      "On a lightly floured surface, pat the butter into a rectangle about 6 x 8 inches, wrap in waxed paper or possibly plastic wrap, and chill for about 15 min, while you continue with the yeast dough.",
      "Sprinkle the yeast over the hot water in a small c. or possibly bowl, stir, and let stand to dissolve for a few min.",
      "Put the flour, sugar, salt, and the 2 Tbsp.",
      "butter in a large mixing bowl.",
      "Using your fingertips, work the butter into the dry ingredients.",
      "Add in the Large eggs, water, and yeast mix, and beat just till blended.",
      "Turn out onto a lightly floured surface and knead about fifteen times-just till the dough begins to hold together.",
      "It will still be a fairly rough, shaggy mass; do not knead too much.",
      "Rolling Dough and Butter Together- The First Turn You'll need a large work surface-about 30 inches wide-with plenty of room around it.",
      "Sprinkle the dough and your work surface with flour, turn the dough out onto the surface, then roll it into a rectangle about 9 x 13 inches, the length stretching out in front of you.",
      "Place the cool butter mix on the bottom half of the dough, leaving about a l/2 inch border.",
      "Lift up the top unbuttered half of the dough and fold it down over the butter, then press the edges together to seal.",
      "(If you have worked slowly, and the butter has softened, slide the dough onto a floured baking sheet, cover with waxed paper or possibly plastic wrap, and refrigeratefor about 15 min.",
      "If you worked rapidly and the butter is still cool and hard, chilling at this point is not necessary.)",
      "With the long sealed side to your right, roll the dough into a rectangle about 10 x 24 inches, its length stretching out in front of you.",
      "Use hard, smooth strokes with the rolling pin, and roll over the entire surface of the dough-very easy if you have a large, heavy pin.",
      "If at any time the butter softens and breaks through, stop working, dust lightly with flour, slide a large, floured baking sheet under it, and refrigeratefor about 15 to 20 min.",
      "Fold the bottom third of the dough up to the middle, then fold the top down to cover it, as though folding a business letter.",
      "This completes the first turn.",
      "Wrap the dough in plastic wrap or possibly waxed paper, place in a plastic bag, then set on a baking sheet or possibly large plate and chill for 45 min.",
      "The Second Turn Place the chilled dough in front of you on a lightly floured surface with the long, sealed side to your right.",
      "Holding the rolling pin by both handles.",
      "give the stiff dough a half dozen or possibly so whacks down its length to make it more malleable, then roll it out again into a rectangle 10 x 24 inches.",
      "If the butter does not appear perfectly smooth at this point, and some of it remains in small flecks and pcs under the surface of the dough, it's okay.",
      "Again mix in thirds like a business letter, then wrap and refrigeratefor at least 45 min-or possibly up to a few hrs, if convenient.",
      "If it rises a little, do not worry; it will be punched down when you roll it out again.",
      "The Final Turns Give the dough two more rollings and foldings, just as you did before, wrapping and chilling between turns if it begins to soften.",
      "After the final turn wrap and refrigeratethe dough for at least 1 1/2 hrs-or possibly overnight, if it's convenient-before forming and baking.",
      "Forming the Croissants To create the croissants, it will be easier to work with one half the dough at a time, so cut the dough into two equal pcs, wrap one piece, and keep it chilled.",
      "Use a ruler and grease pencil to stake out a 10 x 20-inch area on a floured surface, so which you have an idea how big the dough should be before you begin rolling.",
      "Place the dough on the surface, and roll it out to a 10x20-inch rectangle.",
      "Use smooth, hard strokes, and keep the corners and edges as square as possible; lift the dough occasionally and reflour the surface if it begins to stick.",
      "Cut the dough in half lengthwise.",
      "Use your ruler to mark off four 5-inch squares on each strip of dough, then cut the squares with a sharp knife.",
      "Cut each square in half diagonally, to create two triangles.",
      "Brush any excess flour from your work surface; for the next step, it should be clean.",
      "Butter some baking sheets, and have another baking sheet or possibly two at hand so you can double-pan when you bake.",
      "Working with one triangle at a time, pull one of the points out a little, then start at the opposite side, rolling the triangle up.",
      "Pull the ends down to create a crescent shape, and place the croissant on the baking sheet, with the tip tucked under.",
      "Form the remaining triangles the same way, and place them on the baking sheet, about 2 inches apart.",
      "Brush the top and sides with egg glaze; use your fingers-you will have more control which way and fewer drips.",
      "(If you run out of baking sheets, form all of the dough, and place the unbaked croissants on a tray or possibly platter, then transfer to the baking sheets when the first batch is done.)",
      "Cover the baking sheets loosely with a towel and let the croissants rise in a hot place for 1 1/2 to 2 hrs, till they look and feel light and puffy, and have doubled in size.",
      "Baking the Croissants Brush each croissant with the egg glaze again.",
      "Double-pan the baking sheets and place in a preheated 425 degrees F oven for 10 min, reduce the heat to 375 degrees F and continue baking for 8 to 10 min, till croissants are puffed and well browned.",
      "If you are baking more than one sheet at a time, reverse from top to bottom and front to back so they brown proportionately.",
      "Remove from the oven and transfer to racks to cold for a few min before serving.",
      "Freeze any croissants you won't use which day.",
      "To reheat: Unwrap and place on a baking sheet in a preheated 400 degrees F oven for about 5 min."
