Rub the seasoned flour mixture evenly over the pork loin. Toss together sweet potato chunks and the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil in a roasting pan. Spread out evenly over bottom of pan. Place the tied pork loin, fat side up, on top of potatoes in the roasting pan. Roast in a 450\u00b0 oven for about 10 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 350\u00b0. Continue to roast 55 to 60 minutes or until instant-read thermometer inserted into pork but not in stuffing, registers 150\u00b0 to 155\u00b0 and potatoes are fork-tender.
