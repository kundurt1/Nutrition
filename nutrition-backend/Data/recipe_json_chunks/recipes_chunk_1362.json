Crack and pick the meat from the claws, knuckles and body. Chop lobster meat into bite-sized pieces. Set aside. Split the tails lengthwise down the center with a sharp knife, being sure to keep the shell-side of the lobsters facing up. Make sure to keep the shells intact. Remove the tail meat from the shell and remove the intestinal track from the meat. Then carefully insert the whole tail meat back into the shell.",

      "For the stuffing, melt the butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add the chopped onion. Saute until soft. Stir in the parsley, Old Bay seasoning and lemon juice. Remove the skillet from heat and let cool. Stir in the chopped lobster claw and knuckle meat. Gently add in the cracker crumbs and stir. Using a spoon, add the the stuffing into the lobster tails. Refrigerate the lobster tails until ready to bake. When ready, preheat the oven to 425-degrees . Bake the tails until the stuffing is golden and crisp, about 15 - 20 minutes. Serve immediately with wedges of lemon and let the dinner party begin!",
      "* Instead of whole lobster, the dish may also be prepared with frozen Maine lobster tails. Boil water and just blanch the tails and carefully remove the meat, leaving the shell intact. Substitute 16 ounces of raw Maine crab meat or shrimp instead of the lobster knuckle and claw meat. Saute the crab meat or shrimp with the onion and finish preparing the stuffing and the lobster tails as directed."

Dust another work surface (or baking pan) with cornmeal, place the loaf on top, and let rise for 40 minutes (or until doubled in size). Repeat to make all 4 loafs, or store the remaining dough in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks. At this time, begin preheating your oven to 450 degrees F.",

Then, add 1/2 cup of water, whisk, and place in the microwave for approximately 1 minute. Brush the wash across the top of the loaf and sprinkle with the additional caraway seeds. Using a serrated knife, make 4 shallow, parallel slashes in the top of the loaf.",

Add 1 cup of hot water to the boiler tray, and close the door. The water will help create a crispy crust. Bake for about 30 minutes. (You will be able to tell when the bread is baked if your thumping on the bottom of the loaf makes a hollow sound. If it sounds dull, it likely needs a few more minutes in the oven. Or, you could use a thermometer and remove bread from the oven when the internal temperature is 200 degrees F.) Allow the bread to cool on wire rack before cutting or eating."

      "Add the ingredients to a 4-quart pot. Bring to a very gentle boil over medium heat. Meanwhile, line a sieve or fine mesh strainer with a few layers of cheesecloth and place it over a deep bowl or pot. Once the curds begin to separate from the whey (you'll see little specks of white bob to the surface), stir gently and set heat to the lowest setting (see NOTE). Cook for 2 more minutes, then remove pot from heat and set on an unlit back burner for at least 30 minutes, and up to one hour. (this will help the curds further develop). Gently ladle the curds into the cheesecloth-lined strainer (this helps produce a fluffier, creamier curd, than pouring it into the strainer). When all the curds have been spooned into the bowl, pull the cheesecloth up the sides to loosely cover the ricotta in the strainer. Let sit for 10 minutes to drain (this will yield a very moist ricotta. If using for a cake recipe, you may want to let it drain longer for a drier consistency). Store in a tightly covered container in the refrigerator for up to three days. NOTE: After making one to two pots of ricotta for a year, I've learned it likes to be left alone to produce the highest yield, so resist the temptation to stir it frequently once the curds begin to separate from the whey. One stir is enough, and if you're curious, you can dip the spoon in the pot once or twice to see how the curds are developing."

      "To make the crepes: Whisk the flours, salt, milk, buttermilk, butter, and eggs together in a large bowl until very smooth. To save arm power, you can blend the ingredients in a blender instead. Let the batter sit for at least 1 hour at room temperature and up to 1 day in the refrigerator.",
      "Rub a small dab of butter (1/2 tablespoon or so) onto the bottom of a 9- or 10-inch nonstick crepe pan or saute pan over medium heat and wait until it melts completely. (Too much butter will make for a soggy crepe.) Pour 1/4 cup of the batter into the hot pan and tilt it in a circular motion to ensure the batter spreads out into an even layer. Cook over low heat until the edges start to pull away from the pan, about 2 minutes. Using a nonstick spatula, carefully flip and cook the other side until golden brown, about 1 minute. Lay the crepe on a large plate and repeat until you've gone through all of the batter (it's okay to stack the crepes on the plate). If the crepe pan starts to get too dry, add another little dab of butter. I tend to cook these quickly while the plums are sauteing and assemble them right then, but if you're chatting with friends and taking your time, keep the finished, unfilled crepes warm in a 200\u00b0F oven until ready to assemble.",
      "To saute the plums: In a medium saucepan over medium heat, melt the coconut oil. Add the vanilla and honey, swirl the pan so they combine with the coconut oil, and then add the plums. Saute until juicy and warm, 2 to 3 minutes.",
      "To assemble: For each crepe, gently fold the crepe in fourths (fold in half, then in half again) and dollop 1 to 2 tablespoons of the Honeyed Ricotta and a few sauteed plums on top. Finish with a generous drizzle of honey.",
      "Make Ahead: You can cook the crepes and store them in the refrigerator, stacked between pieces of waxed or parchment paper, for up to 3 days. You can also freeze them for up to 3 months by allowing the crepes to cool completely, wrapping them well in plastic wrap, and placing them in an airtight container. To reheat, place them in a glass baking dish or a pie plate covered with aluminum foil. Heat in a 250\u00b0F oven until just warmed through."

Twelve hours later, whisk in 1/2 cup flour with 1/3 cup filtered water and continue adding 1/2 cup flour and 1/3 cup water every twelve hours for one week until your starter is brisk and bubbling. As you feed your starter, take care to whisk in the flour and water thoroughly into the established starter - aerating the starter will help to yield the best and most reliable results.",

      "To accomodate for expansion of the sourdough when it's fed, make sure that your jar is only half full after each feeding. If you've made too much sourdough starter for the capacity of your jar, pour some off and use it in sourdough biscuits, sourdough pancakes or sourdough crackers",
      "",
      "Maintaining the sourdough: After a week, your sourdough should be sturdy enough to withstand storage. If you bake infrequently (that is: if you bake less than once a week), you can store your sourdough in the refrigerator, bring it to room temperature and feed it well about twelve hours before you plan to bake. If you bake more frequently - every day or a few times a week - you can store your sourdough at room temperature and feed it with 1/2 cup flour and 1/3 cup filtered water once a day.",
      "",
      "Special considerations: If a brown liquid appears floating on top of your sourdough starter, simply pour it off. Sourdough bakers call this liquid \"hooch,\" and it is harmless; however, it often signifies that you've fed your starter too much water in relation to flour or have let your starter gotoo long between feedings. Sourdough starters are relatively resilient, and bounce back quickly once you resume proper care of them."

Add the brisket and brown well on both sides, about 10 minutes. Transfer the brisket to a platter and set aside. (Or brown the meat under the broiler: place the brisket, fat side up, on a foil-lined broiler pan under a preheated broiler. Broil for 5 to 6 minutes on each side, until browned.

(If you want a smooth gravy, puree all of the cooked garlic cloves.) Transfer the pureed mixture, the remaining braising liquid, and the rest of the cooked garlic to a skillet. Add the chopped rosemary, minced garlic, and lemon zest. Boil down the gravy over high heat, uncovered, to the desired consistency. Taste and adjust the seasoning. Rewarm the brisket in the gravy until heated through.",

If you want to make a large batch of this sauce (more than half a gallon) - and you certainly should since this sauce lasts a long time - the best thickener to use is pre-gelatinized or \"pre-gel\" starch which is both acid- and heat-stable (corn or potato starch is not). It's marketed under the brand name Clearjel(R). Your chilli sauce will remain viscous and maintain the nice suspension for the entire duration of its shelf life when thickened with pre-gelatinized starch.",

      "Traditionally, Thai sweet chilli sauce is not thickened with starch; the syrupy consistency is achieved through cooking the sauce containing lots of sugar down until it's thick enough to create a good suspension of the garlic-pepper bits. However, if you notice, bottled Thai sweet chilli sauce normally contained a starch thickener. You can go either way. I personally prefer the version that contains less sugar which is this one."

Reduce the speed to medium-low, add the flour and salt, and mix until everything is evenly combined. Mix in the milk, 1/3 cup at a time. Then, by hand, stir in the Key lime juice. The batter will be thin. Set aside while you whip the egg whites.",

      "1. If using the rub, combine the mild paprika, brown sugar, hot paprika, celery salt, garlic salt, dry mustard, pepper, onion powder, and salt in a bowl and toss with your fingers to mix. Wearing rubber or plastic gloves if desired, rub the spice mixture onto the pork shoulder on all sides, then cover it with plastic wrap and refrigerate it for at least 3 hours, preferably 8.",
      "If not using the rub, generously season the pork all over with coarse (kosher or sea) salt and freshly ground black pepper; you can start cooking immediately.",
      "2. Set up the grill for indirect grilling and place a drip pan in the center.",
      ", place all of the wood chips in the smoker box and preheat the grill to high; when smoke appears, reduce the heat to medium.",
      ", preheat the grill to medium-low and adjust the vents to obtain a temperature of 300\u00b0F.",
      "3. When ready to cook, if using charcoal, toss 1 cup of the wood chips on the coals. Place the pork shoulder, fat side up, on the hot grate over the drip pan. Cover the grill and smoke cook the pork shoulder until fall-off-the-bone tender and the internal temperature on an instant-read meat thermometer reaches 195\u00b0F, 4 to 6 hours (the cooking time will depend on the size of the pork roast and the heat of the grill). If using charcoal, you'll need to add 10 to 12 fresh coals to each side every hour and toss more wood chips on the fresh coals; add about 1/2 cup per side every time you replenish the coals. With gas, all you need to do is be sure that you start with a full tank of gas. If the pork begins to brown too much, drape a piece of aluminum foil loosely over it or lower the heat.",
      "4. Transfer the pork roast to a cutting board, loosely tent it with aluminum foil, and let rest for 15 minutes.",
      "5. Wearing heavy-duty rubber gloves if desired, pull off and discard any skin from the meat, then pull the pork into pieces, discarding any bones or fat. Using your fingertips or a fork, pull each piece of pork into shreds 1 to 2 inches long and 1/8 to 1/4 inch wide. This requires time and patience, but a human touch is needed to achieve the perfect texture. If patience isn't one of your virtues, you can finely chop the pork with a cleaver (many respected North Carolina barbecue joints serve chopped 'cue). Transfer the shredded pork to a nonreactive roasting pan. Stir in 1 to 1 1/2 cups of the vinegar sauce, enough to keep the pork moist, then cover the pan with aluminum foil and place it on the grill for up to 30 minutes to keep warm.",
      "6. To serve, mound the pulled pork on the hamburger buns and top with coleslaw. Let each person add more vinegar sauce to taste."
