      "Allow it to come to room temperature before serving.",
      "Browning butter:",
      "Brown butter adds depth of flavor to all sorts of sauces and baked goods.",
      "Brown butter is butter that is boiled until it reaches approximately 250F, at which point the milk proteins and sugar (lactose) brown through what are called maillard reactions, producing a complex, nutty, sweet flavor, with a caramel, hazelnut, brown sugar-like aroma.",
      "There are several visual and aromatic clues to watch out for while you are browning butter.",
      "As the butter boils, a white foam will accumulate on the surface.",
      "In order to control the rate at which the butter browns, I recommend turning the heat down to medium when you see the foam forming.",
      "Observe the butter very carefully.",
      "You will begin to notice brown freckles in the creamy white foam.",
      "It will then turn a universal beige-brown color and develop a nutty, butterscotch-like perfume.",
      "The boiled liquid butter under the foam will change color, from a clear yellow to a clear golden yellow.",
      "The best way to see this color change is by scooping up some of the butter with a dry ladle or spoon and then pouring the butter back into the pan, examining the color in the stream of hot butter.",
      "Once you have observed this color transformation and you have smelled the wonderful nutty aroma, remove the butter from the heat and set it aside.",
      "If the butter continues to cook and brown further it takes on a golden brown color with an even stronger nutty caramelized flavor.",
      "(This deeply flavored butter is desirable for some recipes) If the butter is heated a bit more it takes on a solid brown color; it then loses its nutty sweetness and becomes somewhat acrid.",
      "Also be aware that the browning milk solids, once caramelized, sink and collect at the bottom of the pan.",
      "When you pour off the brown butter you can strain the dark solids out; or, if desired, you can allow some to incorporate into your batter or sauce."
