Gather mixture into a ball, kneading gently until it holds together. Transfer to a cutting board; cut into six equal portions.

I use this recipe as a base also, with many variations , such as -- no meat at all , italian sausage & extra onion, (my favorite), diced chicken breast & (presteamed) broccoli (my grandkids' favorite !)and coming soon .garlic, chicken breast, baby carrots, frozen corn,green beans and coarsely chopped onion. Making the white sauce separately really added the right creaminess to the potato/ham & veggie mixture. I used a can of chicken broth for part of the liquid, as I didn't have any bullion. Also threw in some shredded carrots I had on hand, plus 1/2 cup shredded cheese to the white sauce after it had thickened. Also, (to disguise the carrots), added a sprinkle of cheese to each bowl upon serving. Very creamy and tasty. Maybe a possibly of adding corn next time."

      "Gingersnap Crust:",
      "In the bowl of a food processor fitted with the blade attachment, grind the gingersnap cookies to fine crumbs. Add the sugar, salt and melted butter and pulse just to incorporate.",
      "Pour the crumbs into an ungreased, preferably metal 9-inch pie pan. Spread evenly over the bottom, and then create a circle about 1 inch in to separate the crumb for the sides from the crumb for the bottom. Start pressing the outer ring of crumbs evenly up the sides and into the corner (where the side meets the bottom) of the pan. Press the remaining crumbs evenly over the bottom to meet the sides; use a flat-bottomed cup to smooth out bumps. Freeze until solid, about 10 minutes. Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F.",
      "Bake on the center oven rack for 12 to 14 minutes, until fragrant and darkened slightly. . If the crust slumps or cracks while baking, gently push the crumbs back into place, while hot, with a clean, folded kitchen towel. While hot from the oven, moistureproof the crust by brushing the bottom lightly with the egg white wash, if desired. Bake for an additional minute to set the egg white wash. Cool completely on a wire rack. Refrigerate the crust for 10 minutes prior to filling to set the crumbs in place to make filling easier.",
      "Making the Pie:",
      "Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 325\u00b0F. Place the prepared crumb shell on rimmed baking sheet.",
      "In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, blend the softened cream cheese with the sugar, salt, vanilla paste, nutmeg, allspice, cinnamon, and cloves until well mixed. Beat in the eggs one at a time, followed by the heavy cream, rum, and lemon juice. Stir until well combined.",
      "Carefully pour the filling into the pie shell; to avoid disturbing the crumb crust, slow the stream by pouring it over a rubber scraper and letting the filling dribble into the pan. Bake on the middle rack of the oven for 40 to 45 minutes, rotating 180 degrees when the edges start to set, about 25 minutes through baking. The pie is finished when the edges are set and the center is no longer liquid but still quite wobbly. Be careful not to overbake or the custard can separate; the filling will continue to cook and set after the pie is removed from the oven. Allow to cool completely on a wire rack, 2 to 3 hours. Serve slightly warm, at room temperature, or cool.",
      "The pie will keep refrigerated for 2 days or at room temperature for 1 day."

    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "Combine all ingredients in a non-reactive pot, bring mixture to a boil, lower heat and simmer for 15-20 minutes (partly covered). Allow brine to cool completely.",
      "Rinse turkey under cool running water, inside and out (remove giblets from body cavity). Pat turkey dry with paper towels, then immerse turkey in cooled brine.* Turkey should be completely submerged in liquid (place a plate on top of the bird if necessary to keep it covered with the liquid).",
      "Cover the pot and refrigerate* for 8-10 hours or up to 24 hours. Remove turkey, rinse, pat dry, and roast as usual.",
      "COOK'S NOTE: For a very crispy skin: after removing the turkey from the brine, rinsing it and patting it dry, allow the turkey to stand UNCOVERED in the refrigerator for 6-12 hours or overnight. This will dry the skin and result in its being crispy at serving time.",
      "This resting period has the added advantage of evening the degree of brininess throughout the meat (it will be less salty on the surface of the meat, more evenly brined throughout), and resting produces a slightly more tender result.",
      "*Be sure the container used for brining turkey is non-reactive: use enamel, glass or crockery or stainless steel - never cast iron or aluminum. The pot should be just large enough to contain the turkey (so the brine will be sufficient to cover the bird). Brining Bags are now available from many cookware stores, as well as giant-size Ziplock bags (food safe) that may be used alone, or use within a sturdy pot.",
      "*NOTE REGARDING THE CONTAINER (AND REFRIGERATION) FOR BRINING TURKEY:",
      "We have learned that many folks do not have sufficient room in their refrigerators - or sometimes a pot big enough - for the turkey in its brine. Our solution is suggest that the turkey be placed, along with the brine, in a food-safe plastic bag, such as a turkey roasting bag (available in most markets). Then, the bag, with turkey and brine inside, can be placed in an insulated cooler, a large stock pot or plastic crate, (or even a deep sink) and surrounded by ice, \"blue ice\" or empty plastic bottles that have been filled with water and frozen. [The latter suggestions are to keep ice from melting into water which can be messy.] Then the cooler is closed, or the sink covered, and the turkey can be brined there for the number of hours required - checking to be sure that the temperature of the brine is maintained at below 40 degrees, for safety. It is imperative that the temperature never be allowed to rise above 40 degrees - add more ice/blue/ice as needed.",
      "** NOTE REGARDING THE AMOUNT OF SALT IN BRINE: A milder brine may be made, which may have a less flavorful result - but if salt is a concern (the entire turkey will absorb only 10-15% of the brine) the amount of salt may be reduced. For the desired chemical effect to take place, however, the proportions cannot be less than 2/3 to 1 cup of salt per gallon (4 quarts) of water or other liquid.",
      "**TYPES OF SALT:",
      "Kosher salt is the ONLY type of salt to be used in making brine (it is sweeter and more pure than ordinary table salt). Kosher salt is available in two varieties. The most common is flaked salt (example: Morton Kosher Salt) which has been pressed into flakes by rollers. The other type is a four-sided crystal (example: Diamond Crystal Kosher Salt). The crystal-shaped salt measures differently because of its shape. Use about 25% (one quarter) MORE crystal salt than flaked salt when measuring for brine or other recipes. The formula is: 1 tablespoon of regular table salt is equivalent to 1 1/2 tablespoons flaked kosher salt, or 2 tablespoons, diamond crystal kosher salt.",
      "***NOTE REGARDING BRINING TURKEYS TO BE \"DEEP FRIED:\".",
      "When a turkey will be deep fried (Cajun style or otherwise), too much sugar will cause the bird to blacken on the outside. It is best, therefore to use water, rather than apple juice or cider, and to greatly reduce the amount of sugar called for in the above listing of brine ingredients.",
      "Variations:",
      "*A listener called last year to report that using beer instead of juice resulted in a wonderful flavor - she even used Guiness, a more bitter-tasting beer - and loved it!",
      "Along the same vein, another listener said that she made the brine as directed, then - after it had cooled - she added an equivalent (the same) amount of flat dark beer and another full one cup of brown sugar (packed measure). After stirring the mixture until the sugar dissolved, she proceded to brine her turkey in the mixture - and indicated that the result was just fabulous.",
      "**BRINING A GOOSE: This brine works exceptionally well for brining a goose before roasting. The meat of the goose benefits greatly from brining for 12 to 24 hours. Follow the same directions for goose as you would for brining a turkey."

      "There are two main options for glazing without a torch. The first is with the broiler and the second is with the stove top. The broiler method involves putting your oven on the broiler option WITH THE DOORS OPEN while you are taking the time to roll the ham or turkey breast in the sugar-mixture. It is important that you aren't heating the oven up because you don't want to cook the meat more - just caramelize the sugar. (best to make sure the rack is in place before turning on broiler). Once the coils are red hot, place the meat in the oven under that area where the coil goes back around and place it as close to the coils as possible without actually touching. Do not step away from the oven. Once you see the sugar bubbling, remove it. If you wait any longer it will start to burn.",
      "The stove top method is to carefully cook the sugar mixture in a pan and then pour a thin layer over the ham or turkey breast. To caramelize the sugar mixture, place the sugar mixture in a heavy skillet or saucepan. Heat and stir over low heat until the sugar melts and turns a golden brown. This one generally ends up with the thickest \"crust\" but is preferred by those who are afraid of experimenting directly on the ham or turkey. (if they wreck the sugar mixture, they throw it out and start over but it never touched the meat.)."

Mix the dry and wet chips up a bit and fold over the other end of the foil to meet the end the chips are near, crimp along the edges to seal all around and poke holes into both sides with a fork.

Set your timer for 15 more minutes. At the end of the 15 minutes both the rice and the quinoa should be tender and nicely cooked.",

Mix in the vinegar mixture, carefully folding it into the rice. I like to use a rice paddle (flat sort of spoon), fanning it out as you go to help the rice cool off. Adjust the seasoning if need be, adding more vinegar if you like. (I wouldn't add more salt because you generally serve with soy sauce).",

Another option is to sprinkle the rice with sesame seeds or Gomasio at this point. Place your fillings in a straight line across the middle of your rice. Lift the sushi mat and fold over and roll, to form a log. This might take practice if it's your first time, but basically connect the bottom of the sheet closest to you, to the top of the rice mixture, which should result in your filling being perfectly in the middle (or not! -- still tastes good!). Use the mat to help you tighten up the sushi log then release it.",
