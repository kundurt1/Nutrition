Add sugar gradually, whisking till you have the stiff peak stage (or you can try holding the bowl upside down above your head to make sure!)Also check at this point that all the sugar has dissolved by rubbing a small amount of mix between your fingers. continue whisking for a few minutes if it still feels grainy.

For 1:1 simple syrup, add equal parts sugar and hot water, seal, and shake until dissolved. Let cool before using and store for up to several weeks in the fridge. For 2:1 simple syrup, mix two parts sugar to one part hot water and proceed as above. Easy-peasy.",

Press the blade down against the garlic and pull the knife along the board towards you in very short strokes. Be careful to keep the sharp side of the blade against the board and away from you at all times. Be sure to pull the garlic back into a pile and toss it with the salt on occasion. Add salt if there isn't enough friction to crush the garlic. Continue this until you have achieved a paste like consistency.

      "Recipe says to cover with 2 layers of paper towels, top with foil, and crimp along edge of pan to seal. I have made other cheesecakes in the pressure cooker without covering them.

Bring to high pressure (15 psi), reduce heat to maintain pressure, and cook for 25 minutes. (At 25 minutes, my covered 8-inch cheesecake was completely raw in the middle, so I returned to the pressure cooker, brought back to pressure, and cooked uncovered for 10 more minutes. I would suggest 35 minutes cooking time).",

      "M'semmen: In a large bowl mix 2 1/2 cups of flour with 1 tsp salt & 1 tsp sugar. Add enough lukewarm water to the mixture to form a stiff dough. (Flours differ in their ability to absorb moisture so no precise amount can be given. Add a small amount at a time. If you have added too much the mixture will be extra sticky and it will be hard to get off your hands, add a little more flour. The right consistency should allow the dough to pull easily off your fingers).",
      "Knead the mixture for 5 minutes until it forms a smooth dough. Pull the dough apart into golf ball size balls, around 12-15. Pour 1 tablespoon of oil onto a large pizza pan. Lightly roll each ball in the oil then place back into the bowl (this helps insure the balls do not dry out).",

      "Person 1: Make sure your hands & the pizza pan are well oiled (you will have to keep adding more oil for each ball). Take one ball & gently spread it out with your oiled fingertips stretching the dough in all directions until it is very thin. (It should be thin like paper but you don't want it to pull apart).",
      "Person 2: Drizzle a small amount of oil in a large frying pan with your finger tips. Heat the pan over medium heat until it gets hot. Lay one sheet of m'semmen in the pan & cook on each side until it has golden spots.",

      "In a 8 or 10 quart pressure cooker place 4 cups of water, onion strips, parsley, spices (except the fenugreek), oil, & chicken. Simmer, uncovered, on medium heat for 10 minutes. After that time turn the chicken over & simmer, uncovered, for 10 minutes more. (You may use a regular pot if you don't have a pressure cooker. The cook times here are the same).",
      "While the chicken is simmering start your second batch of m'semmen, repeating all the steps for it. You should end up with around 25 sheets of m'semmen in all.",
      "After the chicken is done simmering add the lentils, smen, fenugreek & another cup of water to the bottom of the pressure cooker. Make sure the chicken is breast side down. Seal with the lid & cook for 10-15 minutes more, after it begins to hiss. It is ready when the chicken & lentils are tender. (If using a regular pot the cook time is longer, around 30-40 minutes).",
