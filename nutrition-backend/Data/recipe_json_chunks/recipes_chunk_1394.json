Turn heat low, give the cornstarch mixture a big stir, pour it into the broth, stirring in circular motions until it is thickened and smooth. Turn off the heat, cover, and keep it hot. John's note: I like to have a little extra cornstarch/water slurry at the ready in case it is needed to thicken the sauce properly (Sometimes the amount given in the recipe produces a sauce that needs extra thickening). Add only enough of the cornstarch slurry to do the job. Combine the chicken with all the vegetables and seasonings in a large bowl, adding the eggs last. Mix well.",
      "Heat a wok or deep heavy pot over high heat for 30 seconds; add the oil and heat until a cube of bread foams snappily, about 350 degrees. Ladle in a fourth of the egg mixture; when it forms an omelet, ladle in another one. Deep-fry until the bottoms are light brown, then turn and brown the other side. Sandwich each between 2 spatulas, pressing lightly to extract excess oil, and lift out to a hot serving platter. Do the other 2 omelets. Reheat the sauce until piping hot, stirring, and pour it over the omelets. John's note: a garnish of a little finely slivered scallion scattered over the sauced egg foo young at serving time will perk up the appearance of this dish.",
      "Note from John: I like to prepare the omelets in a 10-inch electric skillet; fry in 1/4 inch of oil heated to 350 as follows: either pour the egg mixture in free-form or do as I do and use a 4-inch round metal cookie/dough cutter set in the pan and pour in egg mixture and with a fork drag around the solid ingredients to distribute evenly; when the egg has partially set, remove the ring, and continue in the same way with the remaining mixture. You can do all four omelets in a single batch.",
      "Kuo's sauce is excellent, but I will offer one variation that I have found to be delicious as well (good egg foo young sauces are not easy to find!). This one is from the California Cooking Academy: 3/4 cup chicken stock (broth), 1 TB oyster sauce, 1/4 tsp sugar, pinch of white pepper, 2 tsp cornstarch mixed with 1 TB water, few drops Asian sesame oil. Bring the first four ingredients to a boil over high heat. Lower heat and add cornstarch mixture, stirring continuously until sauce thickens (about 30 seconds). Blend in sesame oil. Makes approximately 1 cup. Believe it or not, sometimes I will make a batch of this sauce and (don't laugh!) sip it out of a mug like soup. Very tasty!",
      "Variations: the filling may be varied with cooked turkey meat, roast pork, crab, lobster, cooked or raw small shrimp, or cubed fish fillet; A combination of 2 or 3 meats is NICE. Shredded celery and bamboo shoots may be added to or substituted for the vegetables, but don't omit the bean sprouts--they give the eggs the right amount of moisture and lend a light crunchiness that is essential.",
      "A final note: this recipe looks long, but it is really nothing more than (1) sauce and (2) the omelet mixture fried up into little cakes. Try this recipe--if you like the \"classic\" version you've had in restaurants, you will love this recipe."

      "To make the bechamel, fry the bacon until quite crisp in a stainless steel saucepan. I know, this will feel weird, but persevere; in the end, you'll clean up fewer pans. When done, remove to a plate lined with paper towels. You'll need a good 2 tablespoons of bacon fat. Eyeball it, you'll be fine. If not enough, add some butter; if too much, pour a bit off.",
      "Add the flour and cook to a pale golden color. Begin pouring in the warm milk in approximate half-cup (4-ounce) increments. After each addition, whisk vigorously until mixture smoothes out completely before adding more warm milk. You'll simultaneously be deglazing up all those lovely browned bits from the bottom of the pan. After the last addition, mixture will appear thin, but smooth. Switch to a flat-topped spatula at this point, as it will make continuous contact with the bottom of the pan, where a whisk will not. Over medium heat, stir constantly with the spatula until the sauce comes to a mild boil and thickens. Remove from heat and season to taste with salt and white pepper (because it's a white sauce, you know).",
      "If preparing in advance, cool to 70 degrees (I keep plastic water bottles of frozen water in the freezer for this) before refrigerating overnight with a sheet of plastic wrap in contact with the surface of the sauce to prevent a \"skin\" from forming.",
      "Now prepare the filling. Use a food processor or a bowl and a wooden spoon. If the former, break up the cream cheese with your fingers and drop chunks into the bowl of the food processor. Break up the strips of bacon and add them. Use the Pulse button to incorporate the ingredients. If using a bowl, also break up the cream cheese with your fingers, and add the bacon which you've chopped up on a cutting board. Work together using a wooden spoon. Whichever mixing method you're using, at the last add the snipped chives (as in with scissors because they are less bruising than using a knife), and pulse or stir them in. DON'T turn your filling green! Taste, and season as needed with salt and white pepper (because it's a white filling).",
      "Prepare your slices of Texas Toast for being filled. Lay each slice of bread flat. Using a paring knife, cut a slit along one side beginning 1/4\" from the corner, and cutting through the center in straight strokes to a 1/2\" perimeter along the side and opposing crusts. Pinch up opposing sides of each slice of bread so that the pocket opens. Use a teaspoon (such as you would use to stir coffee) to spoon up filling into the pocket. Plan on 2 or 3 scoops per slice. After filling, gently press each slice flat to distribute the filling throughout the pocket. If preparing in advance, lay each slice on a baking sheet lined with parchment and cover entire baking sheet with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight. Remove from refrigeration a good hour or so before planning to fry so that everything can come close to room temperature.",
      "If you've prepared everything in advance, when you start coffee before opening presents, also start a pot of water to simmer. Remove your bechamel from the fridge and take off the plastic wrap. Set its bowl over the warming water. Every 15 minutes or so, give it a whisk. By the time you are ready to prepare breakfast, the sauce should be beautifully warmed and the filled slices should have lost some of their cold edge.",
      "Prepare the French Toast as you traditionally would. Begin warming a cast iron pan/griddle or other type of skillet. Melt a couple of tablespoons of butter onto it. Whisk the eggs together. Pour them onto a flat surface (a plate, a baking sheet). Dip each side of the stuffed breads, as well as all four sides, into the eggs, then lay onto the hot surface. When nicely browned on one side, turn and fry until browned on the other side. Remove each slice to a plate, ladle some of the warmed bechamel over it, snip some fresh chives over, and serve to your lovely family."

Gradually beat the flour into the egg mixture to form a stiff dough. If the dough is dry and crumbly, add a little more water. If it is too wet, add more flour. Knead the dough for a few minutes, or until it is silky and smooth. Divide the dough into two discs and wrap it well in plastic wrap, and let it rest at room temperature for 20 minutes to 1 hour.\r\n\r\nNote: Kreplach dough is sturdier than that used for ravioli. Don't worry if it feels a bit heavy.",
      "For the filling, Heat the oven to 375 degrees F. Season the 3-pound pot roast with white pepper and a little sea salt. Roast in an open pan until a crust develops on the outside of the meat and the inside is well done (brown) throughout. Using a chopping bowl and mezzaluna, chop the meat into approximately 1/2-inch pieces (about the size of the chopped onion). Reserve the crusty edges for the noshers in your family.",
      "Saute the onion in olive oil in a large skillet. When the onion is browned and soft, stir in the chopped meat. Let the mixture cool, then stir in the eggs, salt and pepper.",
      "Divide one package of dough into 2 pieces, and keep the second one wrapped so it doesn't dry out. On a lightly floured surface, roll out the first piece to a very thin rectangle, about 9 x 15 inches. Cut the dough into about 15 3-inch squares. Put about 1 tablespoon of filling on each square and dab a little egg white along two perpendicular edges. Fold over the dough on the diagonal to form a triangle. Press the top and bottom together, and press on the edges with the tines of a fork to tightly seal them. Repeat with the remaining pieces of dough, making about 45 more kreplach.",
      "(At this point, you may freeze the kreplach. Put them on a baking sheet in a single layer, and freeze, uncovered, until firm. Put into a plastic bag for storage. Cook from frozen, just allow 5-10 minutes longer cooking time.)",
      "Cook the kreplach in a large pot of lightly salted boiling water, and simmer them for 15 to 20 minutes, or until they are JUST TENDER. Remove from the water with a slotted spoon.",
      "To serve, reheat the kreplach in the chicken soup you will serve them in. You will be lucky if they last long enough to do that!\r\n\r\nTeacher's Tip: It's important to make enough Kreplach that you have plenty to eat cold for breakfast the next day."

Kohlrabi is delicious, as well, cut into 1/4\" cubes (to use Kolhrabi you'll need to splash in 1/4 cup of water in step two and cover to cook until the Kohlrabi is tender, stirring frequently to keep it from burning). \r\n\r\nFor a completely different flavor profile, try using karela (Indian bitter gourd, which is very bitter, indeed). Halve it, scoop out the seeds and pith, slice it into 1/4-inch thick crescent moon pieces, soak them in salt water for 20 minutes, then rinse and squeeze them out before cooking them in the same way as the green beans. Traditional Indian vegetables like unripe jackfruit and drumstick leaves-recently on the American health scene as 'super foods'-are also common vegetables used to make a thoran."

During this time, bring out the slow cooker. You can do this with your dutch oven, or another large pot if you want to keep it on the stove all day, however, I love my slow cooker, and can be assured that when I place pieces of pork in there, and come back hours later, that I am guaranteed the fall apart, fork tender pork. Zest the oranges and place in the bottom of the slow cooker, along with the juice from both oranges. When the pork is browned, add them to the slow cooker. Top with the pieces of smashed garlic, the chopped chipotle peppers, and the adobo sauce. Place on low, cover, and forget about it for at least 6 hours. I let mine go at least 10-12 hours, which is perfect if you prep the night before, and let it cook while you go to work.",

I like doing this as it adds just the right texture to the pork.",
      "When you are ready to serve, add as much pork as you want to two corn tortillas, yes, two of them. That is how corn tortilla style tacos should be made, in my opinion. Add a bit of cilantro to the top, a bit of avocado, and some chopped onion. Fold and enjoy. The orange citrus note, and a bit of spice really made this taco fantastic and was well liked. So much that tacos, nachos, and burritos were made out of this delicious slow cooked pork for the next several days. Enjoy."

Bring the water to a boil again, add a dash of salt and pour over the couscous. Add 1 tablespoon of olive oil, mix with a fork, cover with plastic film and let sit for 10 minutes. After this time the couscous will have absorbed the water, fluff the couscous with a fork or your fingers so the granules are all well seperated.",

      "In a big serving bowl put the couscous. Add all the roasted vegetables with all their seasoning and mix all the ingredients together. Add the strained cranberries, the sliced dry figs, the roasted Pecans and the coriander leaves. Stir and fluff all the ingredients together with 2 forks, fluffing and avoiding crushing the roasted vegetables.",
      "Dress the salad: add the olive oil, lemon juice, check the seosoning of salt and pepper, add the safron powder and stir. Sprinkle the sumac, poppy seeds and linen seeds on top and serve immediately."

The filling recipe is straight forward but it's important you dry the silverbeet thoroughly (I used tea towels) after washing it; any moisture will make the pastry soggy.

You may or may not need the entire two cups. Knead your dough for a good 5-7 minutes and then set it aside to rise. Here's what your dough should look like.",
      "For rising I usually put a small swirl of olive oil in my bowl, throw my ball of dough in to cover the bottom and then turn the dough over so the other side gets a cover of oil as well. This way your dough won't stick when you go to pull it out after it's risen. Now cover your dough with a kitchen towel and let the yeast do it's thing.",
      "Once your dough has had a chance to rise; I usually let it sit for 50 minutes to an hour, bring it out and punch it back down, kneading the dough out for a couple minutes. Now, separate the dough into individual balls; about 3-4 tbsp worth of dough a piece, and place them in your greased muffin tin.\r\nFor making good balls, I roll the dough around in a circular motion on a lightly floured counter with my hands to get a basic ball shape and then I pull all the edges of the dough to the bottom and cinch it, almost like I'm trying to pull the dough around a super ball. This gives you a nice smooth roll top.",

Once you get going, you will conquer that little pumpkin and the peel will be off in a couple of minutes. Slice the pumpkin into half inch sections from top to bottom. The flesh will be easy to cut but still quite firm.",

Using a stick of frozen butter, unwrap one end and grate it on the largest holes of a box grater. The butter will curl off into small shavings. Keep unwrapping the butter and grating until you have grated the entire stick. Add the butter to the flour mixture, crack the egg on top, and lightly scramble it. Mix everything together with your hands, breaking up any large pieces of butter. Push the dough into the shape of a ball and smash the ball onto the counter. All of the flour may not incorporate at this point, or the ball may crumble apart, but stick with it. Smear the ball across the counter to evenly incorporate the butter. As you do this, work in any flour that didn't incorporate initially. Just do this for as long as it takes to get the dough to stick together; don't overwork it.",

Once you have finished the first layer, fit as many additional slices as you can in a second layer, filling in the gaps between the pumpkin pieces from the first layer.

      "Lift the dough with a spatula or a rolling pin and carefully drape it over the pan. Taking care not to burn your fingers, tuck the edge of the dough along the side of the pan. If you have measured accurately, the dough should just fit with a bit extra to slip down into the sides. If you do what I usually do and roll it a bit too big, just squeeze it into the pan. Don't worry if the dough is a bit lumpy because this will be the underside of the tart when you are done. Place the pan in the oven and let it cook until the crust is lightly browned, 25 to 30 minutes.",
      "Remove the pan from the oven and let the tart cool for 15 minutes or more. Place a large serving plate over the top of the pan. With oven mitts or pot holders, pick up the pan with the plate on top and quickly flip the pan over so that the tart inverts onto the plate. I recommend that you do this over a surface that is easy to clean (or the sink) because more than once a bit of caramel has oozed out of the side as I flip the pan.

      "Prep the Kale - cut across the bunch in 1\" - 2\" sections. No stems please. Wash and spin to dry. Set aside. Toast pine nuts in a saute pan or in the oven till a pale pale shade of brown. Set aside.",
      "Mince the garlic. Chop the capers. Heat 1T olive oil (medium heat) in a saute pan and briefly saute the garlic for about a minute till translucent. Add chopped capers and incorporate and heat through. Take off heat and scrape into a mixing bowl. Add the dijon, champagne vinegar and a squeeze of 1/2 a lemon. Whisk and set aside.",
      "Set up a steamer and get the heat on. When the water is hot take away the steamer and dunk the sun dried tomatoes in the water for 3-4 minutes to let them re-hydrate. Pull from the water, cool slightly and then slice into strips. Set aside.",
      "Finish the vinaigrette. Whisk in 1/4 C of evoo into the mixing bowl. The dijon should emulsify this vinaigrette nicely. Taste and adjust with lemon, salt, freshly ground pepper. \r\nThis is too much vinaigrette for this dish yet the excess could find its way onto some seared halibut, salmon, arugula - your call.",
      "With the steamer on high add the kale and steam for (3-4) minutes. this happens quickly and - of course - you want the toothsome quality of kale so keep an eye on it!",
      "Remove Kale from the steamer and dump into a large plate and spread out. chill in the fridge. \r\nConversely I could say shock in a cold water bath yet then you are adding a water element back to the tortured kale - there is only so much time in the day to deal with drying again.",
      "Room temp or chilled kale gets tossed with the tasty vinaigrette (to your taste), a good portion of pine nuts and the sun dried tomatoes. top with a sprinkling of pecorino. I feel pecorino stands up to robust kale.",
      "I can't tell you how to compose this salad to your taste however I love the play of leafy kale to a gutsy vinaigrette to oddly creamy pine nuts. Oh - and the forgotten sun dried tomato...",

      "MAKE THE PIZZA DOUGH: In the bowl of a large food processor, add the flour, yeast and salt; pulse a few times to blend. Add the oil and honey and start the processor. Add the water slowly through the feed tube. Continue processing until a ball forms; about 1 minute. After 30 seconds stop the processor and feel the dough. If it is sticky add a tablespoon or two of flour. If too dry add a tablespoon or two of water. Carefully remove the dough to a lightly floured surface. Knead the dough a few times into a ball. Lightly coat a large glass bowl with olive oil. Add the ball of\r\ndough and loosely cover with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place for about 45-60 minutes or until doubled in size. I like to use the microwave oven with the door slightly open as this makes a nice cozy place for the dough to rise. The dough is ready when there is NO resistance to an indentation poked into the dough. Remove the dough to a lightly floured surface. Cut the dough in half and press each into a flat disk. Lightly coat two 14\" pizza pans with olive oil. Press each piece of dough to the edge of the pan and then fold over the edge of the dough for the crust. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees and prebake each crust just until puffed and firm; do not brown.",
      "PUT IT ALL TOGETHER: Use a pastry brush to coat the pre-baked crust with olive oil. Spread a very thin layer of Caesar salad dressing over the dough. Sprinkle the fresh mozzarella cheese, then the baby spinach, fresh basil and shredded 5-cheese Italian. Sprinkle with garlic pepper and then a drizzle of olive oil. Bake for about 20-30 minutes or until nicely browned and bubbling. Let rest for about 10 minutes and then cut and serve. I like to sprinkle each pizza with freshly grated Parmigiano Reggiano cheese just before serving."

Saute for approximately 10 minutes, or until spinach is wilted and zucchini is soft. Let cool in the pot.",

Now it's time to assemble them all into one scrumptious lasagna.",

Spread half of the spinach mixture on top of the strips, as evenly as possible. Follow with half of the cheese mixture. Top that with the other half of the potatoes, then another layer of lasagna noodles, then the remaining spinach mixture, then the remaining cheese mixture, then the remaining lasagna noodles. At this point, I spread the slices of heirloom tomatoes evenly on the very top, sprinkle with the remainder of the herb mixture, and top with generous sprinkles of parmesan cheese.",

    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "If you choose to cut chops off a whole saddle of lamb/mutton yourself, instead of letting your butcher do it like a sane person, you'll need to get an inexpensive plastic cutting board. This is important, because it's likely you're going to do some damage to it. Also needed will be a boning knife and either a cleaver or a small handsaw. I prefer a saw to a cleaver here.",
      "To use a saw:\r\nStart by figuring out how big you want the chop to be and then, using a 5-inch boning knife, cut through the meat, across the saddle, down to the bone. Do this on both sides of the saddle, then grab your saw. Make sure that you hold on to the saddle tightly with the other hand, or get some help and have the other person hold one end of the saddle while you hold the other. Gently saw through the bone, using fluid, medium-long strokes. Don't try to take too much at once, or the saw will bind and pop out, possibly damaging the meat-be patient! You may need to rotate the loin to cut completely through the bone without gouging the board. When you've finished cutting, use a spoon or the back of a knife to scrape off the bone dust before you season and grill the chop.",
      "To use a cleaver:\r\nUsing a boning knife, cut through the meat as above. Then, instead of sawing, place the cleaver inside the cut and on the bone where you want to cut. Grab a mallet and gently whack the back of the cleaver squarely and rhythmically until you have cut through to the board. Be careful not to get aggressive here, as it's pretty easy to hurt yourself when you're tangled up with a mallet and a cleaver. If you were hoping to hack away at the saddle with a cleaver like a cartoon character, sorry to disappoint you, but that sort of action takes years of practice. I'm trying to help you to succeed, thus the mallet. OK?",
      "To cook the chop, begin by seasoning it liberally with salt and pepper and then let it loaf around for an hour where you can gaze upon it but hungry pets cannot reach it.",
      "Fire up your grill and preheat your oven to 325\u00b0F. Once your grill is hot as hell and your oven is ready, place the chop on the grill and give it a nice crusty sear on all sides, 2 to 3 minutes a side. Then place the chop in a medium cast-iron skillet and roast in the oven for 10 to 12 minutes, until it hits 120\u00b0 to 125\u00b0F on an instant-read thermometer. Rest the meat for 10 minutes.",
      "Debone the chop by following the X-shaped bone with a boning knife until all the meat is free, then slice the meat across the grain. Plate the chop by placing the sliced portions back on the bone roughly where they came from, in the most gruesome way you can figure out. Serve with a rustic red from the southern Rhone Valley."

(You can do this step in the Cuisinart, but be careful to pulse in very short bursts, as you don't want to over-process the dough. It should still have big slicks of butter showing.) Sprinkle about 1/2-cup ice water over the pastry and mix it in rapidly. Continue to add spoonfuls of water to the pastry and mix it in rapidly. Continue to add spoonfuls of water until the dough can be pulled together into a neat ball. Give one or 2 quick kneads (the butter needs to look unincorporated at this point), wrap the mass in foil and refrigerate for 20 minutes.",

Fold the dough over into thirds. Turn the dough on the table so its length is perpendicular to you and roll again into a large rectangle. Fold into thirds. You have now given the pastry two turns. Wrap in foil or plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.",

Fold the pastry into quarters, or roll it on your rolling pin to transfer it to a flat pizza pan (or large baking tin) and cut a 14-or 15-inch round. (Or, you can make a rectangular pizza.) Let the dough rest for 15 minutes before adding the toppings.",

      "If you have the time you will get better flavor if you can age your beef for 24 to 48 hours. Keep it on a rack over a pan uncovered in the refrigerator. When ready to cook trim off any dried, leathery meat. Allow roast to rest at room temperature for 30 to 60 minutes before cooking.",
      "Preheat your oven to 500\u00b0 F with a rack in the center.",
      "Remove the ends and papery skin from your onion. Cut the onion in half through the equator and separate each half into 2 sets of rings. Place the rings in the center of a 10- to 12-inch oven safe skillet. They are going to be the \"rack\" you will be roasting your beef on. Coarsely chop the celery and scatter it around the onion.",
      "If you have not aged your beef, blot it dry with paper towels. Rub the roast with the oil and sprinkle it generously with salt and pepper, trying to get seasoning on all surfaces. Place the roast on top of the onions making sure it is not in contact with the bottom of the pan. Add 1/4 to 1/2 cup water, enough to coat the bottom of the skillet to help prevent burning of the onion and celery.",
      "Place pan in pre-heated oven and set timer for 10 minutes. After 10 minutes reduce the heat to 250\u00b0 F, and cook until the interior temperature hits 125\u00b0 to 130\u00b0 F when checked in 2 to 3 places. This will take about 15 to 25 minutes per pound. Remove from oven and place meat on a rimmed plate or platter then tent with foil. Wait at least 15 to 20 minutes to carve (you can also cool and chill the meat at this point if you are doing it ahead.)",
      "While the meat is resting make your \"jus.\" Remove the onion and celery from the skillet and discard. If there is more than a teaspoon or two of accumulated fat, skim it off. Place the skillet on burner over medium heat. Add the wine or beer, and scrape the pan to deglaze and incorporate any juices and bits that have accumulated. Let the mixture reduce by about 1/3, then add the stock, Worchestershire, and bay leaf. Bring to a simmer and turn heat to low. Allow to simmer for several minutes. Add any accumulated juices from resting and carving the beef. Taste and adjust seasoning with additional Worchestershire, salt, pepper or stock - you want the \"jus\" to be pretty salty and strongly flavored. If not making the sandwiches immediately, remove from heat, cool and refrigerate.",
      "After beef has rested carve it into slices as thin as you can muster. There will be a \"vein\" of gristle running through the roast, trim this away as you are carving. I like to cut the roast in half with the grain, then slice the halves across the grain to make the task more manageable.",
      "Heat your \"jus\" to a simmer in the skillet. Remove the bay leaf. Add your sliced roast beef and toss it about with tongs to warm it for a minute or so. Remove from heat.",
      "Cut your roll in half lengthwise. If it is a chubby roll, tear out some bread from the inside to improve your filling to bread ratio.",
      "Pile a layer of the beef with as much \"jus\" as possible clinging to it onto the bottom of the roll. Drizzle with an additional 1 to 2 tablespoons \"jus.\" Distribute the arugula, roasted red pepper, and chevre over the beef. Place the top of the roll on the sandwich. Wrap sandwich in parchment paper, leaving top exposed, and tuck the wrapped sandwich into a 16- to 20-oz paper cup. Serve immediately."

The colors are pure and lovely, just like Monet's dining room. Add the mayonnaise, salt and pepper, and slice through the warm eggs. Don't mix the eggs too much - this is not egg salad.

      "Wash rhubarb and trim as little off the ends as possible. Cut rhubarb into 1-inch chunks. In a small saucepan, heat rhubarb, 1/4 sugar, and water on medium. Cook until rhubarb falls apart and there are no whole pieces left, adding water by the tablespoon if rhubarb sticks to the bottom of the pan. At this point, either use an immersion blender to puree the mixture, or (if you're like me and your blender is otherwise occupied) push the mixture through a strainer. The first method is definitely easier.",
      "Preheat oven to 350. Now, make the shortbread: blend all ingredients in a stand mixer or food processor until combined. Wrap in plastic and refrigerate about 1 hour. Then, either roll into 8x8 square and place square in 8-inch square baking pan, or dump dough into pan and use fingertips to press evenly into pan. Bake 30 minutes, until golden. Let cool on a rack or on the counter.",
      "Add a couple inches of water to the pot of a double boiler and set over medium heat. Put egg yolks, butter, remaining sugar, lemon zest, and lemon juice in the boil of the double boiler and whisk to combine. When sugar has dissolved completely, add the rhubarb puree by the spoonful, to temper the eggs. When all rhubarb has been added, set bowl over pot; the water should be simmering. Continue stirring the rhubarb mixture; after about 5 minutes, the mixture will be warm and slightly thickened. At this point, remove from heat. Press through a strainer -- this will give your curd that smooth, pudding-like texture.",
      "Use an offset spatula to spread curd evenly over shortbread. If you haven't eaten half the bowl right then and there, you should have enough curd to make a layer about the thickness of the shortbread; I didn't. Bake another 10 minutes, then remove from oven and cool on rack. Refrigerate about 20 minutes, and you'll find that they've firmed up enough to slice cleanly. Cut into 16 equal bars. Dust with powdered sugar before serving; do your best not to polish them all off in one sitting."

      "In a bowl, make your marinade. First, crush your dried lavender to release their oils. You can do as I do: Crush and roll the dried lavender back and forth in your hands, or you can use a mortar and pestle for this. (A wooden spoon, bottom of a cup, etc., also work fine.)",
      "Once the lavender is crushed in your bowl, add in the honey (both regular and lavender, if you have it), olive oil, lemon juice, smoked paprika, thyme, crushed garlic cloves, chopped onion, Kosher salt and black pepper. Give it a good stir until all are combined, and add then add in the bay leaves.",
      "TIME TO MARINATE: In a large Ziploc refrigerator storage bag or plastic tupperware, place in the spatchcocked chicken and pour in the marinade. Make sure the pieces are completely coated. (I like to best do this by sealing the Ziploc bag, and massaging the chicken with the marinade. Less mess!) The chicken will be best marinated overnight, or for at least 5 hours.",
      "When the chicken is done marinating, remove the bay leaves and discard. Remove the chicken and set aside; reserve the marinade. Preheat your oven to 425\u00b0 F.",
      "In a roasting pan, place in your chopped and colorful vegetable medley (potatoes, carrot, broccoli, and cauliflower). Douse them with a bit of olive oil and the reserved chicken marinade (garlic, onions, and all), a dash of both salt and pepper, and toss until all are coated. Spread out on the bottom of the pan.",
      "Lay the chicken flat, skin-side down (not up), on top of the vegetables. Season the chicken with a bit of Kosher salt & pepper, and put the entire roasting pan into the oven to cook for about 30-minutes.",
      "After the 30 minutes are done, take the roasting pan out of the oven and carefully flip the chicken over with tongs, so it is now skin-side up. Season the surface of the chicken skin with salt and pepper, and put the roasting pan back into the oven to cook for another 25-30 minutes, or until the meat on the chicken thigh reads 165\u00b0 on a meat thermometer (150\u00b0 F on the breast meat). Or, if you don't have a meat thermometer, pierce the thickest part of the meat with a fork and see if the juices run clear (and not bloody).",
      "Once the chicken is done, take the roasting pan out of the oven and carefully remove the chicken to rest on a plate for about 10-15 minutes.\r\nTake this time to stir around the pan-dripped roasted vegetables and season them to your liking. Remove from the roasting pan, and to a serving plate.",
      "Once the chicken is rested, carve up to your liking (half, quarter, however you want). Serve atop the roasted vegetables."

    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "Beef and Chicken (etc)Stocks: No way do I ever have room in my freezers to store stock. When I make any stock, after chilling and removing the fat layer, I significantly reduce/cook down the stock to a rather rubbery dark colored 'demi glace' (half ice). I pour the demi into a rectangular tub,to a depth of no more than 2 inches. Freeze it, flip it out onto a cutting board and cut it into cubes and then toss the cubes into a tub or ziploc bag. (Waste of saran to wrap each cube separately.)",
      "Soup and sauce storage: Black plastic rectangular take-out containers (the kind with the clear domed lids) are ideal for freezing soups and sauces, but I use them to hold/give shape to the food, not to store the food. I line my rectangles with saran that hangs over the sides. I fill the saran with a pre-measured amount of soup or sauce or stew (like 1 or 2 people's worth of soup.) Then I place the containers on a rimmed sheet pan and freeze them flat. Once frozen, i flip out the containers and tightly wrap the overhanging saran - around the product. I label the product and stack them in a ziploc bag.(This takes up much less space than stacked up containers with their raised lids.) Rectangles and squares fit much better than rounds into a packed freezer.",
      "I practice these techniques with liquids because I am a batch cook i.e. I always make and freeze multiple servings of each thing. For soups and stews, it's usually at least 10 servings. It hardly takes any more time to cook 10 servings of something than it does to cook 4 servings of something."

The cake batter should be smooth and scoopable (not pourable), similar to a muffin batter or maybe a little thicker.",

Avoid opening the oven door for the first 30 minutes of baking. The cake does not have much oven spring, and should only rise to the top of the pan.

Add the white rice along with the soy sauce and rice wine vinegar and stir to combine the flavors. Spread the rice around the wok and let cook for intervals without stirring so it browns in parts, about 7 minutes.

Admittedly, mine is a little long in the tooth. Yours might be more of a Ferrari and yield a higher amount of juice. The reason I am adding this note is because too much ginger can ruin a batch of anything, including this granita, and this is a mercurial ingredient whose use must be metered from rhizome to rhizome. I have found that about 4 tablespoons is a balanced amount for this amount of carrot juice. And remember that as the juice sits, the ginger will 'bloom', and grow stronger, so add with prudence. My advice on how to maneuver is as follows:",
      "Juice a 2 oz. knob of fresh ginger. This should yield 4 tablespoons of ginger juice. Stir the ginger juice into the carrot juice to amalgamate the flavors, and taste. You might like yours a little spicier, so adjust the spice by juicing small knobs, and adding 1 teaspoon at a time to the juicer if you want it spicier. Using prudence with your additions ensures a successfully balanced granita.",

Be sure to get into the corners of the pan, and squish any solidified chunks with the back of the fork. They should still be quite tender and not difficult to break up at this early stage.",

      "Once cold, peel the quince and remove the cores. Set the peels and cores aside for the jalea. Cut the fruit into small pieces. The size of the pieces will determine how smooth or 'chunky' the resulting paste is - we always chop ours quite small. Unlike other fruit, the quince won't totally disintegrate when cooked. (A note that this is a sticky sticky fruit, even before you add sugar, so be prepared.)",
      "Weigh the pulp.",
      "Return the pulp to your pot and add a little of the cooking water, just enough to cover the fruit. Add sugar. For each kilo of pulp, add 700 - 750 grams of sugar. It seems like a lot of sugar, yes, but quince is not particularly sweet and the sugar is important for color and caramelizing! We usually air on the 700g side, but not less.",
      "Cook on medium heat, stirring every few minutes, until the fruit begins to boil. Reduce to low heat and cook, stirring every few minutes, until a paste forms. (You might want to use an oven mitt when stirring - exploding quince burns!) If it the mixture starts to dry out, add a bit more of the original cooking water.",
      "Use the back of your spoon to smash large chunks of fruit during the cooking process. If you still have large pieces and would prefer a smoother membrillo, use a whisk to whip the fruit into a smoother paste about an hour into the cooking process (you'll definitely want oven mitts this time!)",
      "The membrillo is done when it's a beautiful, burgundy-wine red, and has a spreadable consistency. It will begin to hold its form and pull away from the sides of the pot when you stir it. This normally takes 1 hour and 20 minutes, depending on the amount of fruit, heat, and pot.",
      "Optional: if you have a bottle of excellent (Argentinean!) red wine on hand, add about a cup to the fruit 50 or so minutes into the process, and allow it to cook in/off. The wine will deepen the color and temper the sugar.",
      "Pour into a glass baking dish. Cool completely, seal tightly, and refrigerate. The membrillo will keep in the fridge for months.",
      "Sterilize your canning jars by boiling them in water for ten minutes. Place them mouth side down on paper towels until they're needed. Boil the canning rings just a moment or they will melt. Make sure you have new canning tops on hand.",
      "Put the peels and cores in what's left over of the original cooking water.",
      "Boil for a good while, at least an hour.",
      "Strain the water into a new pot, reserving the peels and cores once again. Allow the peels and cores to cool. Wrap them in cheesecloth and wring them out until you've extracted the pectin - a slippery, viscous liquid. Add this to the strained cooking water - it's what will enable your jelly to thicken.",
      "Measure the liquid.",
      "Bring to a boil, and add sugar. For each liter of liquid, add half a kilo of sugar. Again, don't cut out too much sugar here or the jelly won't set. Boil, stirring constantly, for about an hour (oven mitts!). When the jelly turns the same burgundy-wine red of the membrillo, and the foam along the edges of the pot is white and thick, test the jelly's consistency by putting a spoonful on a plate and letting it cool. Do so until it cools to the consistency you'd like, but don't overcook or the jelly will crystallize.",
      "Spoon the jelly into your sterilized cans and seal. If you're going to keep them for a long time, can them properly by then boiling the filled and sealed jars for another 10 minutes. We usually eat la jalea within the month, though, so we just pop it in the fridge and hope for the best!"

It is, what I call, when the collagen relaxes. When this happens the meat becomes succulent and tender and really cooking it any longer than is necessary is only detrimental to the beef itself leaving if void of precious fat which is why you are cooking this piece of meat in the first place (because you like the taste of the fat.) I have really come to like the taste of the rib cut itself as well and if you are going to spend the money on a free range organic grass feed cut then you really should want to taste it and not bury it under loads of strong tasting sauce.",
      "Using a sharp knife cut the ribs between the bones into square pieces. They should be about 2 1/2 inches square. Salt the ribs liberally on all sides and let them rest until it is dissolved. You can also let the ribs sit uncovered in the fridge overnight after salting them.",

      "Combine all the ingredients for the butter in a bowl and mix it well with a rubber spatula. Season it with salt and pepper and mix again.",

Using your cupped hands, roll the dough into smooth balls, then cover with a towel again to rest for another 10 minutes or so. Now is a good time to start to bring the water in the wok to the simmering point.",
      "Flatten each ball of dough with the palm of your hand and then poke a hole in the center with your thumb. Twirl the dough around your finger to widen the hole and smooth the dough a bit. Place the bagel-shaped dough on the work surface to rest again, flipping after about 10 minutes.",

This may take only 5 minutes, but depending on the temperature of your kitchen, it could take longer. Add the baking soda (1 teaspoon per liter) and honey (about 2 teaspoons per liter) to the water, and then simmer a few bagels at a time for one minute before flipping them to simmer the other side. If they do not float soon after hitting the water, they need more time to rise-if you're not sure of your dough, start this process with just one bagel.",

    "title": "smoky and sweet roasted red pepper with tuna",
    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "Roast bell peppers under a broiler or over the burner of a gas stove. I do not have gas so I broil, placing a piece of tin foil under peppers to catch any juices as they split and blister. Roast until charred and blackened on all sides - my nose usually tells me when it is time to turn them. Once roasted, carefully remove peppers from oven and place in a large shallow bowl. Lately I've been using the foil the peppers were roasted on to cover the bowl and allow pepper to steam for a few minutes. Remove foil, allow peppers to cool, and remove stem, skin and seeds. Transfer to a cutting board. With a sharp knife, slice peppers into thin strips lengthwise and then crosswise to end up with 1 inch long pieces. Note: I like using a bowl instead of a paper bag to steam peppers to catch all the smoky sweet juices that are released. If I am careful enough, I can keep the juices relatively seed free and then add it to the peppers before mixing with the tuna.",
      "Place roasted pepper pieces into a medium sized bowl. Add any juices from original bowl that you used to steam peppers in. Drain most of oil from tuna and add tuna to peppers. Top with finely chopped parsley and 3 T of Smoky and Sweet dressing. Using a fork to break up tuna, toss to combine well. Serve over lettuce and/or with olive oil toasted baguette.",
      "SMOKY AND SWEET DRESSING: In a small jar with a lid, combine 3T Rosemary-Garlic infused olive oil, sherry vinegar, almond butter and smoked paprika. Close jar and shake vigorously to emulsify. Add sea salt to taste.",
      "ROSEMARY-GARLIC INFUSED OLIVE OIL: Combine 8 garlic cloves, smashed flat with the side of a large knife, 1 6-8\" sprig fresh rosemary and 1 cup extra virgin olive oil in a small saucepan, making sure that garlic is submerged (even if only barely - you can further flatten any pieces that are not submerged). Cook over extremely low heat for 45 minutes. Oil will begin to separate if it boils. Transfer to a clean glass jar with lid and allow oil to cool, then refrigerate. Infused oil is extremely perishable so use within a week. Rosemary infused oil also makes a delicious simple vinaigrette - combine 1/2 cup rosemary infused oil, 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar, 2 t Dijon mustard, salt and pepper to taste."

      "To make the crust, first make the G.F.G.S. Break up 6 or 8 of them (depending on size) and drop into the bowl of a food processor. Add all the other ingredients except the butter and pulse until mixture resembles corn meal. Stop the machine and make a fist around a small handful of the mixture. If it holds together, you don't need to add any more butter - there's quite a bit in the cookies. If it doesn't, add the melted butter and pulse to blend in. Scatter crust mixture evenly around the bottom of your pan and with your flat palm, press evenly all over surface and around edges to pack the crust tightly.",
      "When I'm going to be making cheesecake, I set the cream cheese out overnight. Actually, I hide it in the oven so that none of the several 4-legged creatures for whom I work can take matters into their own paws and do something quite different with it. The point is that it will emulsify much better with the sugar and eggs if at room temp. So will the eggs if you rest them for 5 minutes in warm (not hot!) water.",
      "First peel the mangoes, remove the pulp, and puree it with 1 tablespoon of lime juice in a food processor or with an immersion blender.",
      "Begin by mixing the cream cheese and sugar together on lowest speed until no visible lumps remain. Stop mixer and thoroughly scrape sides and bottom of bowl, then raise bowl and mix in what you just scraped loose.",
      "Crack all eggs into a liquid measuring cup. Do not whisk them together! With mixer running on lowest speed, add them one at a time, allowing each to be fully incorporated before adding the next. When all have been added, again stop the mixer and thoroughly scrape the inside of the bowl, then mix again to incorporate everything. Last, mix in the lime juice.",
      "Pour all but about a cup (eyeball it) of filling into your pan. Add the mango puree to the filling remaining in the bowl. Return it to the mixer and mix on low speed to fully blend. Pour the mango filling right into the center of the first filling. Let it level out. To create the marbled effect, get a paring knife. Working in interconnected figure 8s, move the knife from the outer edge to the center, and back out again. Work in 1 continuous, fluid movement, gently rotating the pan all the while. Be careful not to scrape up filling from the bottom.",
      "Set your springform pan in the center of a baking sheet. Set it in the oven with the front edge of the baking sheet extending out over the front edge of the oven rack. Carefully pour your hot water into the baking sheet, filling it almost to the lip. You'll spill some, so do try to miss your feet ; ) Carefully slide the sheet the rest of the way into the oven. Bake for 45 - 60 minutes. When done, you will be able to gently nudge the edge of the springform pan, and the contents will \"jiggle like Jello, not wiggle like a wave,\" to quote the inimitable Chef Jake. Also, the top should be just slightly dry to a careful touch. It should by no means be cracked!",
      "Using oven mitts or potholders, carefully lift your pan out of the hot water. Leave the pan of hot water in the oven with door ajar until it is cool enough to tiptoe across the kitchen with it, trying not to spill any. Though by now, you won't have to watch out for your toes. Allow the cheesecake to cool at room temp until you can comfortably handle the pan with bare hands, then refrigerate uncovered overnight.",
      "The next day, run hot water into a sink to a depth of a couple of inches. Set your springform pan it, and count to 15. Remove and set on a towel. Run a paring knife or a small offset spatula all the way around the edge of the pan. Release the latch, and gently remove the ring. Use a longer spatula to carefully slide your cheesecake off the base and onto whatever you plan to serve it on.",
      "The easiest way to cut a cheesecake is with a hot, wet, flat-bladed knife. I use my long serrated slicer. Run it under hot water, give it a shake, and make your first cut. Rinse the knife, give it a shake, and make your next cut. Serve up a piece of this beauty, add a dollop of whipped cream, maybe a nasturtium blossom for its coordinating color, and enjoy."

What I like to do personally, is roll out all dough balls into the flaky parantha style and make them into buds, and leave them. Then, take them one by one and roll out and stuff them all at the same time. The rolled out and stuffed parantha can be freezed upto a month or so. So, if you want to make ahead few and freeze them , at the time of serving just need to heat them on griddle. \r\nTake the potato and scallions filling, place it in the middle and take edges of circle and seal the stuffing and it should look like a round dumpling. Slightly, flat out the pointed part of the dough and you will have exact round shaped filled dough. Roll this out again into round size of a pancake.",

Remember as we have filling inside , we should seal it in such a way that there is no air, or else it will break the while rolling. I understand if there is a little bit of filling popping out while rolling , its perfectly OK.",
