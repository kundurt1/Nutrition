      "Preheat oven to 350\u00b0. Lightly grease a 9 x 13-inch baking pan with butter or vegetable oil. Blend the flour, baking soda and salt in a small bowl with a wooden spoon. Set aside. Using an electric mixer on medium speed, cream the butter, sugar and vanilla in a medium-size bowl until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Stop the mixer once or twice to scrape the bowl with a rubber spatula. Add the eggs and mix on high speed for 3 seconds, then on medium speed until blended, about 5 seconds. Add the flour mixture and mix on low speed until almost blended, 8 to 10 seconds. Stop the mixer once to scrape the bowl. Add the chocolate chips and nuts and mix on low speed for 5 seconds. Finish the mixing by hand with a wooden spoon. Spread the batter evenly in the prepared pan. Bake the bars on center oven rack until the top has formed a rich, golden crust and dropped below the level of the darker golden outer edges, 30 minutes. These bars cannot be tested by inserting a tester because the inside remains gooey. Cool 30 minutes in the pan, placed on a rack before cutting."
