This takes a little time, and, yes, there is enough syrup. Using 1 level measuring tablespoon of coconut, shape into a ball by squeezing coconut firmly in palm of one hand, then rolling in both palms. (Hint: measure out all the coconut, then roll into balls.) Place 2 inches apart on wire rack. Let dry 10 minutes. Reroll coconut balls so there are no loose ends of coconut sticking out. Place milk chocolate and shortening in a 4 cup measure or 1 1/2 qt. microwave safe bowl. Microwave on high 1 to 2 minutes or until mixture can be stirred smooth and is glossy; stirring once or twice. Working quickly, spoon 1 level measuring tablespoon of the chocolate over each coconut ball, making sure chocolate coats and letting excess chocolate drip onto waxed paper. While chocolate coating is still soft, lightly press whole almond on top of each. Let stand to set; place in refrigerator. Store in a single layer in an airtight container.
