Attach the KitchenAid(R) Sifter + Scale Attachment to your mixer. With the ingredient valve in the closed position, weigh the sugar in the ingredient hopper. Turn the mixer to medium speed, open the ingredient valve, and sift the sugar into the mixing bowl. Beat the cream cheese mixture until the sugar is incorporated and the mixture is smooth and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Transfer the mixture to a small bowl and set aside. Wash and dry the mixer bowl, place back on the mixer, and fit the mixer with the whip attachment.",

      "With the mixer on medium-low, open the ingredient valve and sift the dry ingredients into the mixer bowl. Once all the dry ingredients are sifted in, slowly pour in the sour cream mixture, mixing just until the flour disappears. Now, pour the boiling water down the side of the bowl, mixing just until incorporated. Turn the mixer off. Remove the mixer bowl, and use a rubber spatula to blend in any flour remaining on the sides or bottom of the bowl.",
      "To fill the cupcakes, spoon 2 tablespoons of cupcake batter into each lined baking cup. Then spoon about 2 teaspoons of the cream cheese filling on top and in the center of the batter. Finish by adding another tablespoon of batter on top of each cupcake, covering the cream cheese filling. You should end up with 18 to 20 filled cupcakes. Bake the cupcakes in the center of the oven until the tops crown, and a toothpick inserted along the edge comes out clean, 16 to 20 minutes. (If you insert the toothpick in the center you'll hit the soft cream cheese, which won't be a good indicator of doneness.) For even baking, at the midpoint, rotate the pans from front to back. Cool the cupcakes in the pans set on wire racks for 10 minutes. Lift out the cupcakes and set them on wire racks to cool completely.",
      "While the cupcakes are baking, make the salted caramel glaze. In a 3-quart/3-liter deep, heavy bottomed pot, combine the sugar, water, and salt. Stir until well mixed. Cook over high heat, boiling the sugar mixture, without stirring, until the sugar starts to color around the edges of the pot. Swirl the pan to promote even caramelization, but do not stir. Continue to boil until the sugar syrup is a dark mahogany color and the sugar syrup is lightly smoking, about 10 to 12 minutes.",
      "Immediately remove the pan from the heat. Wear an oven mitt on the hand that will be doing the stirring. In a slow, steady stream, pour the warmed cream into the sugar syrup, stirring with a heatproof spatula or wooden spoon to incorporate. (Stand back a bit as you do this because the mixture will steam and bubble up furiously.) Once the cream is incorporated, stir in the vanilla. Transfer to a heatproof bowl and let cool to room temperature, stirring occasionally.",
      "To glaze the cupcakes, place a baking sheet under a wire rack to catch any excess glaze. Give the salted caramel glaze another stir, and then use a spoon to drizzle the glaze back and forth across the top of each cupcake. Set them aside until the glaze sets up, about 20 minutes. The cupcakes are best when served on the day they are baked. The cupcakes will keep at room temperature for 2 days in a covered container. (Note: The salted caramel glaze recipe makes at least a cupful more than you'll need to glaze these cupcakes. The extra can transferred to an airtight jar and refrigerated for up to one month. Spoon over ice cream, layer in milkshakes, or, eat with a spoon straight from the jar!)"

Move the pork chops to the cooler side of the grill and allow to cook for 5 minutes. Flip the pork chops and brush some of the glaze on the top side of the pork. Cook for 3 minutes and then flip the chops and brush more glaze on the other side. Cook another 2 minutes and then use a probe thermometer to check doneness. The pork chops are ready when the internal temperature is 145 degrees F. The National Pork Board recommends to cook pork chops, loin roasts, and pork tenderloin to an internal temperature between 145 F and 160 F, followed by a three minute rest. Remove pork chops from grill, brush over a little more glaze, and rest the chops for 3 minutes.",

Check for seasoning, you may need a little more lemon juice to make the flavors pop. If making ahead of time, don't add salt until right before you serve it otherwise it will make the cherries watery.",

      "Once cool, add beaten eggs and incorporate completely.",
      "Trim the pork and score the rind. Unroll the roast so the skin side is down. Examine the belly portion and determine whether you need to trim away any of the top layer of fat. If the roast came without skin, turn it over and also trim away some of the fat from the top side if need be. How much you leave in place is a matter of personal preference. Ideally you want a layer just under 1/2-inch thick. If you've got a separate pork loin and pork belly, check that the outermost fat layer of the pork belly is less than 1/2-inch thick. If needed, trim it down.",
      "Next, drape the belly (skin side up) around the pork loin (without tying it), just to get a sense of how it will fit. It doesn't have to be perfect, but if it extends more than 1 inch over the ends of the loin, trim it down and save the trimmings for another use. If there's a gap on the underside because the belly doesn't reach all the way around, that's fine.",
      "Arrange the belly so it is skin side up on a stable surface and, using a box cutter, utility knife, or other razor-sharp knife, carefully (but firmly) score the rind in parallel lines about 1/2-inch apart, cutting through the rind and just into the fat (about 1/4-inch deep) without cutting through to the meat. The lines can go in any direction that appeals to you.",

Continue to roast until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of the roast registers 140 to 145 degrees, another 3 hours or so, but it's a good idea to start checking the temperature after another 2 hours.",

      "Now on your kitchen surface pour a tablespoon olive oil and pop the dough over.\nTip- Olive oil will help in kneading and will improve the flavor and the best part is adding the oil will keep the kneading surface tidy.\nKneading technique- Use the palm of your hand to stretch the dough forward and use your fingers to bring the dough back towards you. Turn the dough vertical and repeat the folding. Keep kneading until you get a soft,springy elastic dough, It will take about 10 -20 minutes. Shape the kneaded dough into a ball and let it rest in a bowl which is greased with little olive oil. Do not forget to cover, and keep it in a warm place for about 1-2 hours, Or until the dough is double in size.",

Take the dough out from the bowl on to the kitchen surface and add the crushed garlic cloves and oregano seasoning. Knead a little more to mix well.\nPreheat your oven at 180*C and rub some butter on a baking sheet. keep aside.\nSprinkle some corn meal on your kitchen surface ( if you can not find corn meal, you can substitute with semolina ( suji).",

Now lift the one end to meet the other forming a semi circle.Seal the ends with your fingers gently.

Till the crust become slightly golden brown.\nServe hot with creamy cheesy dip."

Carefully pour/spread the cream cheese mixture around the center of the disc being sure to leave an edge of approximately 2\". Working from center, begin with the longest apple noodles and, starting with a tight spiral at the center, twirl the noodles into a larger and larger spiral as you work towards the edge of the filling. Continue to spiral the noodles around each other, being careful not to press the noodles too deep into the filling; and, extend the spiral pattern as close to the edge of the cheese filling as possible. Once your longest noodles are used, begin incorporating the shorter noodle strands into the spiral design to give depth and texture. Then, for the smallest apple shreds, spread them evenly along the edge of the spiral design/cheese mixture where they'll be covered by the dough when dough is folded up.",
      "Fold the 2\" border of the dough over the filling, gently overlapping each fold and pleating/pinching the edges as you move until the entire edge is 'wrapped' in dough. Pinch to seal any cracks at the edges. Brush all exposed dough with egg wash and sprinkle with 1 teaspoon of white sugar; then, sprinkle the apples with a few shakes of cinnamon. Return galette to freezer for at least 15 minutes before baking.",
      "Bake in preheated oven for 30-35 minutes, or until crust is golden brown. Allow to cool for 10 minutes prior to slicing."

      "3. Transfer the mixture to a mixing bowl and let it cool 3 to 4 minutes. The mixture does not have to be cold, just cool enough not to cook the eggs when added.",
      "4. Using a mixer beat the eggs one at a time into the flour mixture. Do not add the second egg until the first is fully incorporated.",
      "5. Transfer the mixture to a pastry bag equipped with a large straight tip and pipe 1-inch balls onto a sheet tray lined with parchment paper. When done, dip your finger in water and smooth the top of each ball where the pastry bag released the dough. Be sure to leave at least 1-inch between each of the balls.",
      "6. Bake in the preheated oven for 20 to 25 minutes, rotating the tray halfway though the cooking time to insure even cooking. When done, the puffs should be light, airy and dry inside.",
      "7. Cool on a rack.",
      "1. Preheat the oven to 200\u00b0F.",
      "2. Using an ovenproof pot that's slightly larger than the pork belly and has a lid (such as a 12-quart Dutch oven), place the pork in the pot and add enough lard to cover it by 1/2 to 3/4-inch. Attach thermometer to the side of the pot.",
      "3. Place the pot over low heat until the lard registers 190 degrees. Cover the pot, transfer it to the oven, and heat until the pork is melting tender. This will probably take five and a half to six hours, but start checking after four hours. As fat in the pork melts, the piece of pork will shrink, so it's best to transfer the pork and enough lard to cover it to a smaller pot about midway cooking.",

      "3. Stir the butter into the caramel until it is completely melted, about two to three minutes.",
      "4. Very slowly, drizzle in 1/2 cup of heavy cream while whisking. Since the heavy cream is colder then the caramel, the mixture will rapidly bubble and/or splatter when added.",
