When you want freshly baked muffins, simply pop the frozen batter-filled foil cups back into a muffin pan and bake as directed; adding 5-6 minutes to the total baking time.",

      "Start by adding your water, yeast, sugar, and honey into a large mixing bowl. Set it aside and let this become frothy for about 10 minutes. Take in the smell. It's wonderful.",
      "Once your yeast has activated, add in the salt, olive oil and flour. Mix everything together until it forms into a dough ball. You don't want it sticky, and you don't want it dry. So add additional flour if it's too sticky, or add a bit of additional water if it's too dry.",
      "Take the dough out of the bowl and knead it for a couple of minutes, before shaping it into a ball and transferring to another large bowl. Drizzle olive oil over the dough to lightly coat. Cover the bowl with a kitchen towel and set in a warm place to let it rise. The rising process will take a couple of hours, but I like to let mine rise throughout the day as we most often make the pizzas for dinner.",
      "About 3 hours into the rising process, take the towel off and make a fist, and punch it right in the center of the dough. This is called punching down the dough. Cover and let the dough rise another hour or so. Punch it down again before rolling out the dough.",
      "Next, add the butter, salt, and garlic to a sauce pan, and on low temperature, begin melting the butter. Once it's melted, set the pan aside off of the heat.",
      "Next, take some flour and shower your working surface with the flour. You will begin rolling out the dough until it's about 1/4 inch to 1/2 inch thick and about 15 inches across both sides.",
      "Take a pizza cutter and cut the dough in half, width wise. Next, cut in the opposite direction and slice the sections of dough into about one inch slices (see the related blog link for pictures).",
      "Preheat your oven to 375 F.",
      "Lightly oil a baking sheet with the olive oil, or use parchment paper if you have that. Take a slice of the dough, and make a knot out of it as pictured above. Set the knot onto the baking sheet, and repeat until finished. I made about 24 knots out of this recipe.",
      "Lightly brush some of the garlic butter onto each knot. Then place the pan in the preheated oven for about 12 minutes, or until the knots are a light, golden brown.",
      "Add the remaining garlic butter to a large enough bowl to hold all of the knots, then toss in the chopped parsley. Give that a stir.",
      "When the knots are cooked, add them into the bowl containing the butter and parsley, and give them a good toss, or three, allowing the remaining garlic butter and parsley to coat the rolls. Shower the rolls with the Parmesan cheese, and toss again. Take a smell, you deserve it. Actually, take one, eat it and enjoy. You'll want another one. And another.",
      "I simply served the bowl at the table. If you wanted to, you could present them on a nice platter. They will most likely disappear extremely fast-they are pretty amazing. Are you a fan of garlic knots or garlic bread?"

    "title": "gingerbread cookie dough reindeer pops",
    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "For the dough:",
      "In a medium-size bowl, add flour, salt, ground ginger, cinnamon, ground cloves, and ground nutmeg. Stir together and set aside. In a large mixing bowl, add butter and brown sugar. Cream together until light and fluffy. Add vanilla, molasses, and water. Mix together. Turn the mixer to low speed and slowly add in the dry ingredients to form the dough.",
      "For the reindeer pops:",
      "Roll the dough into balls that are about the size of a large gumball or jaw breaker (should make about 16). Carefully stick the lollipop sticks into the dough balls. Chill the lollipops for about 1 hour in the refrigerator. If the pops are put on a wax-paper-lined plate, stick-side up while in the fridge, you may need to slightly reshape the top of the dough balls after removing them from the fridge.",
      "In a small microwavable bowl, add 3 cubes of candy coating. Warm in the microwave for 45 seconds; remove and stir the part of coating that is melted. Warm again in the microwave for 40 seconds and stir. If needed, warm again in the microwave for 30 seconds (or the amount of time needed to completely melt the coating) and stir.",
      "Tilt the lollipop slightly over the melted coating and spoon the coating over the dough ball (don't dip the lollipop in the coating because the stick may come out of the dough). Be sure to spoon the coating in the area by where the stick is inserted into the dough (to strengthen the hold between the dough and the stick). Set the coated lollipops on a high standing cooling rack stick-side down to set (about 15 minutes). So that the wet coating on the dough ball doesn't rest on the rack, for the short time it takes the coating to set, slip a shallow dish under each lollipop stick so that the pop will stand up on its own without the dough ball touching the rack. Add more bars of candy coating to the melting bowl as needed. Repeat the warming process when additional bars are added to the bowl or when the coating starts to harden.",
      "For the antlers, with a small spoon, dab a little bit of coating on to the dough ball where the antlers will go. Then dip the bottom end of the pretzel (the narrow end) in the melted coating and attach the antlers to the dough ball.",
      "For the eyes, add a dab of melted coating to the back of each candy eyeball and attach them to the reindeer.",
      "For the red nose, add a dab of melted coating to the back side of the red candy and attach it to the reindeer.",
      "Decorate just the tip of the antlers by spooning on melted vanilla candy coating on the outside edges of the pretzels. Immediately sprinkle candy on top of the antlers (so it will stick). Let the coating set before serving (about 15 minutes). Store leftover pops in the refrigerator.",

      "For the topping: Combine the flour, oats, brown sugar and almonds in a large bowl until well-combined. Add in the pieces of butter and use your hands to squeeze and combine until the mixture becomes crumbly and resembles wet sand. Alternatively, you can cut in the butter with a pastry cutter, or place all of the topping ingredients in a food processor and pulse until just blended. My favorite method is to use my hands, as I believe you get the best crumbly topping that way. Once finished, place topping in the fridge and begin making the apple filling.",
      "For the filling: Place butter and seeds from the vanilla bean (just use a sharp knife and scrape the small seeds out of the pod halves) in a medium saucepan, and turn heat on medium. After a couple of minutes the butter will begin to crackle and foam-make sure you whisk consistently during this process! After another minute or two, you will notice the butter turning a slight brown (caramel) color on the bottom of the saucepan. Continue to whisk and remove pan from heat as soon as the butter begins to give off a nutty aroma. Immediately transfer the butter to a bowl to prevent it from burning. Set aside to cool for a few minutes.",
      "While the butter is cooling, place apples, 1/3 cup brown sugar, cinnamon and bourbon in a large bowl and toss to combine. Add the brown butter to this apple mixture and toss again to combine.",
      "Take a heaping 1/2 cup of the topping mixture and toss with the apple mixture. Place the apple mixture in the prepared pan and sprinkle evenly with the remaining topping. It may seem like a lot of topping, but the apples will cook down and the topping will provide an excellent crunchy exterior.",
      "Put the pan on a baking sheet (just in case the filling bubbles over!) and bake in the preheated oven for 55-60 minutes, or until topping is golden brown and filling is bubbling. Remove from oven and cool 10 minutes on wire rack. Serve warm with vanilla bean ice cream."

After 5 minutes or so of mixing, if the dough is still sticky, add the remaining bread flour and 1/2 cup all-purpose flour and mix until combined. Remove the dough from the bowl (it should be thick and stiffer than most yeast breads) and knead a few times with your hands, forming it into a ball. Add the remaining all-purpose flour if the dough is still sticky.",

Return the other half of the dough to the mixer and add the red food coloring. Kneed the dough until the red is mixed throughout and there are no streaks. Place it in the second greased bowl and cover. Allow both bowls of dough to rise in a warm place until they are double in size, about 1 hour.",
      "Once doubled, punch down both sections of dough and place them on your counter, using a little more flour if needed to prevent them from sticking. Divide each dough into 14-15 pieces that are about 1.3 ounces each. A kitchen scale is very helpful here. Roll both the red and white sections of dough into ropes (about 8 inches long per section). Take one white and one red rope and twist around each other. Shape the twist into a candy cane shape and place on an oiled baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining ropes. Do not over crowd you pans. The bagels will rise and you do not want them to be touching. So use another oiled sheet pan if needed. Cover the pan(s) and let the dough rise for 30 minutes.",

Remove bagels one at a time and place on the greased baking sheet. Repeat. You may need to reshape the bagels back into a candy cane shape after boiling. Once all the bagels are finished, brush each bagel with the melted butter and then sprinkle with salt. Place tray(s) in the oven and bake for 5 minutes at 500 F and then turn the oven down to 400 F and bake for another 20-30 minutes.",

    "title": "strawberry biscuits with homemade strawberry butter",
    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "For the biscuits:",
      "1. Preheat oven to 475 F. In a large bowl, sift together all of your dry ingredients (flour, salt, sugar, baking powder, baking soda).",
      "2. Cut in the cold stick of butter and with your hands or with a pastry blender, blend your butter and flour together. It will start to look like bigger grains of sand.",
      "3. Once the flour and butter is kneaded well, pour the buttermilk into the middle of the dough mixture. Also add your diced strawberries into the middle.",
      "4. Take one hand and begin to stir until it is all mixed well. Take your ball of dough and turn it onto a lightly floured surface and begin to knead but don't overdo it.",
      "5. Now there are a couple of ways you can do this next part (creating the biscuits).",
      "Method 1: Once you have kneaded your dough and rolled it out flat (anywhere between 1/2 to 3/4 inches thick) on the work surface, you can take a biscuit cutter and cut out rounds of dough.",
      "Method 2: You can lightly flour your hands and take pieces of the dough and roll them into a ball.",
      "Either way, once you have chosen your method, place them in a round pan or a cookie sheet close together and place them in the freezer for 20 minutes.",
      "6. Now that your dough has been frozen, place the pan in the oven and bake for 12-15 minutes. Once your biscuits are done baking, butter them immediately and drizzle with honey.",
      "For the butter:",
      "1. Use either a food processor or a stand mixer for this process. Pour the cream into your device along with the powdered sugar and strawberry preserves. I used a stand mixer, so turn on your mixer or device, and you want to keep whipping the cream past the stage where it turns into firm peaks. You will notice that the cream will begin to separate and release a liquid, which is buttermilk, and it will look like it is curdling. It will also begin to turn pale yellow. It's okay. But make sure that you keep beating the cream. Once you have a good amount of that buttermilk the cream will curdle. Next put the mixture into a sieve over a bowl and gently press it until a good amount of that milk is out of the butter. As you squeeze you will notice that you have butter in the sieve!",
      "Go to my website to see pictures of what this should look like!",
      "For the cream:",
      "1. With your handheld mixer or standing mixer, cream the butter. You want the butter to be as creamy as possible. Add the cream while you continue mixing. Begin to pour in the sugar and the extract. The cream will begin to stiffen. This should take anywhere from 7-10 minutes. Once you have stiff peaks, you are done! Spread some of that onto the biscuit and enjoy!"

Add chocolate chips, chopped nuts, golden raisins, dates, cranberries, blueberries, strawberries, snozberries, etc. You get the point!

The recipe is best if the bread is slightly stale, 2-3 days old, not fresh baked. For the apples, I used gala apples which are quite sweet. If you are using a more tart apple, you might want to add 1-2 tablespoons of brown sugar to them, but I typically don't add any sugar. The recipe makes quite a bit of cinnamon syrup, but it keeps in the fridge for several weeks.",

Bring the mixture to a low boil over medium heat, and then simmer for 5-10 minutes until it is slightly thickened. Keep warm until ready to serve.",
      "For the cinnamon apples, in a large non stick skillet, melt the butter and then stir in the chopped apples, cinnamon and nutmeg. Saute over medium heat, stirring often, until the apples are tender, about 5 minutes. Keep warm until ready to serve.",
      "For the French toast, preheat a non stick griddle or skillet to medium heat (for the Circulon electric griddle that I used, I cooked it at heat level #4). In a shallow dish, combine the eggs, milk, brown sugar and vanilla. For best results, use an immersion blender to combine it well, otherwise whisk everything together until smooth. Dip each slice of bread into the egg mixture, turning it to coat both sides, and lay it on the griddle. Let it cook for 2-3 minutes until browned, then flip to cook the other side. If you are making a large amount, the cooked French toast can be kept warm in the oven (about 200\u00b0F) until everything is cooked.",

    "title": "cranberry ice cream with cinnamon and brandy",
    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "For the custard:",
      "In a saucepan over medium-low heat, heat 2 cups of whole milk, 1/2 cup of cream and 2 teaspoons cinnamon. Heat slowly and do not let the milk boil.",
      "While this mixture is heating, cream together, in a large bowl, the egg yolks, 1/3 cup of sugar and 1 cup of cream. When the milk mixture is hot, with tiny bubbles popping on the top surface, remove it from the heat. Slowly pour the hot milk mixture into the egg mixture, stirring as you go. Transfer the combined mixture into the same pan and begin to heat the custard over medium heat.",
      "Heating the custard is of utmost importance. You want to heat the custard as much as possible without cooking the eggs. Stir constantly in a figure eight motion with a wooden spoon. You will be able to feel the custard thicken and press against the spoon as you stir. It is done when the custard coats the back of the spoon and when you run a finger along the surface you can see the trail left behind. This should take roughly 10 minutes over medium heat. Although it sometimes takes longer if the heat is irregular.",
      "Once the custard is finished, pour it into a chilled bowl through a fine mesh sieve. Don't forget to filter out any cooked egg within the mixture or your ice cream will taste very eggy! I usually pour the custard into a medium-sized bowl and have the bowl sitting in an ice bath (fill a larger bowl with ice and put the medium sized bowl inside). It is important to cool the custard immediately to stop the eggs from cooking.",
      "For the cranberry sauce:",
      "Fresh or frozen cranberries can be used, but fresh cranberries will enhance the flavor and aroma of the ice cream.",
      "Combine the cranberries and sugar in a medium pot over medium to high heat. Every 5 minutes add about an 1/8 of a cup of brandy. Stir and squish the cranberries until all the cranberries have burst. Then pour the cranberry mixture into a food processor or blender and pulse to turn the mixture to liquid.",
      "Stir the cranberry sauce into the custard as it continues to sit in the ice bath. Once the two mixtures are combined you can transfer it to an ice cream maker.",
      "There are a variety of methods to turn your cranberry custard into ice cream. I used a 2 quart Cuisinart ice cream maker which will turn the ice cream into custard within a half an hour. Follow the directions on your individual ice cream maker.",
      "This recipe yields 2 quarts of the final ice cream product. So you want to make sure your ice cream maker can hold the final quantity, not just the custard. The custard expands as it freezes.",
      "Place your ice cream in the freezer for several hours before serving if you wish to harden it. If you don't freeze it, the ice cream will be soft serve consistency.",
      "Note:",
      "Prep time is roughly 40 minutes and includes everything prior to placing your custard mixture into the ice cream maker. Cook time will depend on your method of turning the custard into ice cream. Follow the directions for your ice cream maker.",
      "This is an original homemade recipe."

Whisk in espresso powder, vanilla, and salt. Then sift the flour over the chocolate mixture and stir to blend well. Transfer batter to prepared pan and bake brownies until slightly puffed and dry-looking, and tester inserted into center comes out with some moist batter attached. This should take about 20 minutes. Let cool completely in pan on rack.",
      "Once cooled, run a knife around the inside edge of the brownie pan. Use the overhanging foil as an aid and gently lift the brownies from the pan. The pan I used produces a brownie that is 1/2\" thick. Be sure your cookie cutter is taller than 1/2\". Press small flower-shaped cookie cutters (the cookie cutter I used measures 1-1/2\" in diameter) firmly into the cooled brownie. Use a thin metal spatula to lift the cookie cutter filled with brownie from the foil. Gently press the brownie out of the cookie cutter. Repeat the cutting process until your brownie looks like a big piece of Swiss cheese, and you have a whole bunch of little brownie flowers.",

Set up a fine mesh strainer lined with 2 layers of cheese cloth. Pour the raspberry sauce over the cheese cloth to remove the seeds. I gather up the ends of the cheese cloth and gently press out all the raspberry juice. Pour the raspberry juice back in the pot. Simmer until the juice reduces to a 1/4 cup. It will be a very rich red and concentrated sauce. Set aside to cool completely.",
      "With a mixer, cream the butter with a paddle attachment on medium high speed about 2 minutes, until lightened in color and a bit fluffy. Add 2 cups of powdered sugar, the 1/4 cup of cooled raspberry sauce, lemon juice, and salt. Mix until smooth. Add another 1-1/2 cups of powdered sugar and mix until smooth. If you want the frosting less stiff, add some milk, 1 tablespoon at a time. I did not add any milk to mine, and thought it was perfect for piping.",

      "In a medium sized bowl whisk together the dry ingredients (flour through baking powder) and set aside.",
      "In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a beater blade or paddle attachment, cream the butter, sugar, and Biscoff spread together. Add the eggs, one at a time, making sure each is incorporated before adding the next. Scrape down the sides of the bowl if necessary. Add milk; mix until incorporated. Slowly add the reserved dry ingredients and mix until combined; scraping bowl if necessary.",
      "Pour batter into prepared pan and bake for 1 hour and 15 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.",
      "Remove pan from the oven. Cool cake in the pan for 5 minutes before removing it. Then allow it to rest on a cooling rack until completely cool. When cool, put it on a serving platter before pouring the ganache over the top.",
      "For the ganache:",
      "While the cake is cooling, make ganache by gently heating the heavy cream in a medium saucepan over medium heat. When cream is hot add the espresso powder and stir to dissolve. Add chocolate and continue heating slowly, stirring constantly, until the ingredients are fully combined and the mixture looks smooth and creamy.",
      "Remove from heat and pour it through a fine mesh sieve into a bowl to make sure it's nice and smooth. Allow ganache to cool until it thickens slightly, then pour over cake. Chill cake just long enough to set the ganache. Cover and store at room temperature for several days.",
