    "title": "sour dough bread",
    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "First thing you're going to do, is put your sourdough starter in an electric mixing bowl, and add the water to it. Mix it on low until most of the starter has broken up. This makes the starter happy and wakes the yeast up.",
      "Add the Yeast over the top and let it rest for about 5 minutes. Natural starters take a long time to proof. Adding a little extra yeast to it, helps it proof as well as helps to add to the beautiful air pockets we love in artisanal breads.",
      "Once the yeast has started to bloom, you're going to add your Bread Flour. Now here's the tricky part and when knowing what to look for is necessary. You may need to add a little more water or a little more flour...this is normal. What you're looking for is what's called the \"Window\" stage. You're going to mix the dough with the paddle until there are enough glutenous strands to allow it to stretch thin enough to almost see through. Once it reaches this stage, add the salt and continue to beat with paddle until salt is incorporated. It's important to add the salt last. This is the retardant for the bread that allows it to rise properly. If you add it too early, it will come in direct contact with the yeast and kill it.",
      "Now you're going to let it rise to double it's current size. This could take a while. LET IT!!! Since this is sourdough, you want it to ferment as much as possible as it rises. The slower the better! Approximately 3-4 hours.",
      "Once it's doubled in size, dump the dough out onto a well floured work surface. We're going to do what's known as \"Benching\". Cut the dough into 2 equal portions. The dough is going to be very wet. As we bench the dough, more flour is going to be worked into it.",
      "Take each piece and stretch it out about three times it's current length and fold it in on itself. Flip it over so it's seam side is down. Let the dough rest until it's flattened out again. When you press it lightly with your finger, it leaves an indent that slowly pushes back out.",
      "Once it's reached this point, you're going to bench the dough again, folding it in on itself again, and placing it seam side down again to rest. Once it's flattened out again and your finger indent pushes back out slowly, you're going to bench the dough again.",
      "This time, before you bench the dough, you're going to take a sheet tray, and lightly sprinkle a small amount of cornmeal on the bottom. This is what keeps your bread from sticking.",
      "When you bench the bread this time, place it seam side down on the cornmeal covered sheet tray. leave enough room between them to rise quite a bit while baking.",
      "Turn your oven up to 500 degrees Fahrenheit. Once your oven is preheated, take a small pan and place it on a burner getting it to the point of almost smoking. Place this pan in the bottom of the oven. Put your sheet tray of soon to be sourdough glory in the oven on the bottom rack. Add about a cup of ice to the hot pan on the bottom of the oven. This creates a large amount of humidity to allow the bread to rise and get that artisanal holey interior.",
      "Set a timer for about 20 minutes. After that 20 minutes, turn your pan. Set your timer for another 15 minutes, and keep an eye on the bread. Once the outside has become a deep golden brown, take the bread out and check it for doneness by just tapping the outside. It should sound hollow and the crust should be very solid. If it's not quite there, give it another 10 minutes.",
      "Once the bread is done, place it on a cooling rack and let it cool down at least 3/4 of the way before slicing. I know it's hard, but if you don't do this, you'll compress the beautiful interior making it slightly gummy."

Put a lid on and let it boil.",
      "In a large pan fry your chorizo on oil and add your diced onions later and fry to golden. Add your dried paprika powder and stir well (for less than a minute - it can burn fast and change taste to the much worse if burnt). Add 3 tablespoons of flour and a knob of butter and stir well. Fill your pot with 1000 ml of hot water (1 liter) or any homemade stock you have (I do not thin that the taste of maggi cube would suit the soup so water is perfectly fine if you do not have a homemade stock). Leave it to boil. \nAfter about 10 minutes add your potatoes and sauerkraut (kale) with all the ingredients and water.",

Stir well but gently.\n\nNow add the liquid from the sour kraut (kale) you did set aside in the beginning so the taste is perfectly balanced for your liking (add all, a little or nothing - just so it suits your taste). Add a little and taste first so it does not become too sour what might spoil the taste for you. Add 1 tablespoon of sugar. If you need any more seasoning add them now (black pepper, white pepper, sea salt, sugar).\n\nYour soup is ready. Serve with your favourite bread.",

      "Attach dough hook to mixer and knead dough for approximately 7-9 minutes. Remove dough to greased glass container; cover loosely with tea towel or plastic wrap.

Ensure that the outer edges of dough are slightly thicker so that toppings do not drip off during baking. Brush dough all over with olive oil.

These might include herbs such as basil, thyme, oregano, parsley, rosemary, and sage in the quantities that you like best. Alternately, you may wish to use an Italian herb mix which already contains various herbs. If the mix includes salt be sure to reduce the amount of salt you add in the recipe, perhaps cutting it in half.",
      "VARIATION #2:Pizza doesn't have to be round like many of the pies you see in restaurants! If you don't have a round pizza pan, just press the dough into a square jelly roll pan. For a deep-dish pizza, you may even want to use a 9x13 brownie pan. Using a square pan makes it easier to cut into even-sized squares when it's finished baking."

      "Place pan over medium heat and allow the mixture to come to a boil - do not stir! But do watch closely. At first you will see tiny bubbles forming around the edge of the pan, those will gradually move inward and then the mixture will come to a rapid boil.",
      "Once the mixture darkens and begins to smell like caramel, keep a very close eye on it. Pull it off the heat 30 seconds after it darkens into that deep amber color. If you're using a candy thermometer, you can/should remove from heat anywhere between 275 and 320 degrees (F).",

You should remove the pan from heat when the caramel reaches 245\u00b0F to 250\u00b0 (F). If you don't have a candy thermometer, you can just eyeball this and remove it when it reaches that deep color. Just be sure to never leave the pan unattended. Things move fast with caramel!",

      "Pour the caramel sauce into the prepared pan, being sure it covers all of the shortbread cookies, and spreading quickly if need be.",

      "When the caramel has set, lift them out of the pan by the parchment paper flaps and onto a cutting board. Flip the cookie/caramel combination over, so the cookies face up. This makes it easier to cut into perfect bars. Cut along the edges of each cookie with a very sharp knife. If the caramels stick to your knife, spray your knife with nonstick cooking spray. Place cut cookies onto a cooling wrack and set aside.",

Spread out the dough until it is transformed into a rectangular shape measuring to about 6 inches by 8 inches. Mist the top with spray oil. Cover with plastic wrap and place in the refrigerator overnight or at least for 4 hours.",
      "4. Remove the dough while it is still very cold. Lightly flour the surface and your hands. Remove the dough for the sheet and turn to the lightly floured surface. Knead the dough 6 to 8 times and mold into a big ball. Divide the ball of dough into halves.",
      "5. Take a 9 inch by 5 inch loaf pan and grease it or spray it with flour baking spray. Take one half of your dough and mold it into the loaf pan. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and allow to proof for 1 hour and 20 minutes. Take a heavy dish cloth and run underneath very hot water. Carefully ring out the water and place it on top of the plastic wrap with the loaf pan. This will add humidity to the dough to allow it to rise better.",
      "6. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Take the egg wash and brush it on top of the bread and allow to sit again for another 15-20 minutes. You can perform the hot dish rag trick I mentioned before if you would like.",
      "7. Place in the oven and bake for 30-35 minutes. The bread should be hollow if you thump it. Once finished baking, immediately take out of the pan and turn to a cooling rack and allow to cool for an hour."

      "First, you want to warm up your meat a little bit so it doesn't taste so much like lunch meat. To do this, just take your slices of ham, lay them down (not on top of each other) in your fry pan on the stove. The meat will start to sizzle a little bit. When this happens just turn the heat off on the burner, and leave them sit on the pan to maintain the heat in the meat. After warming it up, there may be some of the \"juices\" from the meat, you will want to take a paper towel or something and clean that off.",
      "Next, you want to start prepping your bread, by laying it down on a plate and lightly spreading butter on the face of the bread that will be on the pan when cooking. There should only be enough butter to cover it, not very much at all. Basically you should still be able to see bread under the butter. if you are using flatbread, only put it on one said of the long slice of bread. Afterwards cut the flatbread in half down a width ways in the middle and use those as your bread or just fold it over later on.",
      "Then, you want to start preparing the sandwich it's self. First, check your ham to make sure it is still kind of warm, room temp works. Remove your ham off your pan and clean the \"juices\" from the meat to prevent your bread form tasting weird. (personal experience, it tastes so strange) Afterwards, take one piece of bread and lay it down on the fry pan, buttered side down and put a piece of cheese on top of the bread. Then, layer on a piece of your meat on top of the cheese and then another cheese, and another piece of meat all layed on the one piece of bread. You may want to put another piece of cheese on top of your second piece of meat so it will stick to the bread. Finally put your 2nd piece of bread on top of the bread, meat, and cheese to create a sandwich.",
      "Now you are going to cook your sandwich just like you would a grilled cheese. Turn the burner on low to allow for a slower cook so the cheese melts. Check on it after a 2 or 3 minutes. if it is cooked/crisped to your liking, flip it and start to cook the other side. Repeat the same steps that you used to cook the other side. Checking on it until you decide it is cooked enough for you but make sure the cheese is completely melted for best results. Maintain the low heat throughout the entire cooking process.",
      "Once you feel your sandwich is crispy enough or cooked enough for you can your cheese is melted completely, turn off the burner, and take you sandwich off the fry pan and put it on your plate. Cut it up into pieces if you want and enjoy!",

    "title": "olive oil cake with harissa-candied citrus and harissa grapefruit glaze",
    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "For the candied Citrus:\n\n Use a sharp paring knife to slice off the ends of the grapefruits and oranges. Follow the curve of the fruit as you carefully cut away strips of the outermost peel (try to leave most of the white pith on the fruit). Slice the peels lengthwise into 1/4-inch strips. \n\nBring a medium pot of water to a boil and add peels. Cook until tender, about 10 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to transfer peel to a wire rack set over a rimmed baking sheet. Allow to dry slightly, about 15 to 20 minutes.\n\nWhile peels are drying, spoon harissa into a piece of cheesecloth that has been folded over numerous times to achieve a square. Use cooking twine to carefully tie up the ends of the cheesecloth so the harissa is entirely enclosed and won't leak. Simmer the harissa cheesecloth bundle in 1/2 cup of sugar and 1/2 cup of water for 8 to 10 minutes, until the syrup has achieved a strong spiciness (you can adjust your infusing time according to your spiciness preferences). Remove the harissa cheesecloth bundle and strain liquid into a bowl.\n\nAdd 1 cup of sugar and 1 cup of water to a medium saucepan and bring to a boil, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Add 5 tablespoons of the prepared harissa simple syrup. Add the citrus peels and boil for 8 to 10 minutes, until the syrup thickens. Use the slotted spoon to transfer the peel to a wire rack, separating clumped-together pieces as needed. Reserve the extra harissa syrup that the citrus peels were simmering in, to be added later to the glaze. \n\nLet the peel dry for 1 hour or more, until slightly less tacky.",
      "For cake:\n\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Lightly butter a bundt pan.\n\nWhisk flour, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl and set aside. Use an electric mixer fitted with the wire whip attachment to beat the sugar, eggs, and zests until pale and fluffy. Add in the milk and beat until combined. Then, with the mixer still running, gradually drizzle in the oil, continuing to beat until it's fully incorporated. Next, carefully add the flour mixture to the wet ingredients, adding a half-cup or so at a time until combined. Pour batter into the prepared bundt pan and bake for about 30 minutes, until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with some moist crumbs attached.",
      "While the cake is cooking, prepare the glaze: Whisk the grapefruit juice, harissa syrup, and powdered sugar together, adding more grapefruit juice if needed to achieve a smooth, pourable consistency.",
      "Remove the cake from the oven and allow it to cool for a few minutes before running a paring knife carefully around the edges to help detach the cake from the pan. Carefully invert the bundt pan onto a cake stand.",
      "Drizzle the glaze evenly over the cake and allow 15 minutes or so for the glaze to set. Top with candied citrus peels, some extra orange zest, and a dusting of powdered sugar.",
      "Enjoy!"

      "Combine yeast and milk in the bowl of a KitchenAid(R) Stand Mixer fit with the flat beater attachment and mix on low speed. Allow to rest for 10 minutes.",
      "Slowly add sugar, spices, vanilla extract, eggs, and apple cider. Mix well.",
      "Change from the flat beater attachment to the dough hook and add the salt with the flour, 1 cup at a time, increasing speed to medium as the flour is incorporated. Knead the dough for about 5 minutes, or until smooth. If dough is sticky, add a bit more flour. Transfer dough to a lightly floured baking sheet and cover tightly with plastic wrap. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes to one hour.",
      "To make the butter block",
      "Combine butter and flour in the bowl of a KitchenAid(R) Stand Mixer fit with a flat beater attachment and beat on medium speed for 1 minute. Scrape down the sides of the bowl and the flat beater and continue to beat for 1 minute more, or until very smooth. Set aside. Do not refrigerate.",
      "After the pastry dough has chilled at least 30 minutes, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface. Roll the dough into a rectangle approximately 18 x 14 inches and 1/4 inch thick. The dough may be sticky, so keep dusting it lightly with flour. Spread the butter block evenly over the center and right thirds of the dough. Fold the left edge of the dough to the right, covering half of the butter. Fold the right third of the rectangle over the center third. The first turn has now been completed. Mark the dough by poking it with your finger to keep track of your turns, or choose another way to keep track of your turns. Place the dough on a baking sheet, wrap tightly in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for 30 minutes.",
      "After chilling, place the dough lengthwise on a floured work surface. The open ends should be to your right and left. Roll the dough into another approximately 14 x 18 inch, 1/4-inch-thick rectangle. Again, fold the left third of the rectangle over the center third and the right third over the center third. The second turn has now been completed. Refrigerate the dough for another 30 minutes.",
      "Roll out, turn, and refrigerate the dough two more times, for a total of four single turns. Refrigerate the dough after the final turn for at least 5 hours or overnight. The dough is now ready to be used. If you will not be using the dough within 24 hours, freeze it. To do this, roll the dough out to about 1 inch in thickness, wrap tightly in plastic wrap, and freeze. Defrost the dough slowly in the refrigerator for easiest handling. Danish dough will keep in the freezer for up to 1 month.",
      "To make the cream cheese filling",
      "In a medium mixing bowl, beat cream cheese and butter until smooth. Add sugar and continue to beat for 2 minutes. Add egg and vanilla, once again beating until smooth. Set aside until ready for use.",
      "To prepare the Danish",
      "Line a baking sheet with a silicone mat or parchment paper. On a lightly floured surface, roll the Danish Dough into a 15 x 20-inch rectangle, 1/4 inch thick. If the dough seems elastic and shrinks back when rolled, let it rest for a few minutes, then roll again. Place the dough on the baking sheet.",
      "Along one long side of the pastry make parallel, 5-inch-long cuts with a knife or rolling pastry wheel, each about 1/2 inch apart. Repeat on the opposite side, making sure to line up the cuts with those you've already made.",
      "Spoon the filling down the center of the rectangle, then top with pears and figs. Starting with the top and bottom \"flaps\", fold the top flap down over the filling to cover. Next, fold the bottom \"flap\" up to cover filling. This helps keep the braid neat and helps to hold in the filling. Now begin folding the cut side strips of dough over the filling, alternating first left, then right, left, right, until finished. Trim any excess dough and tuck in the ends.Egg Wash/Whisk the egg white in a bowl and with a pastry brush, lightly coat the braid."
