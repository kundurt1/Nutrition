    "title": "pork shoulder barbecue",
    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "In a small bowl, mix the salt and sugar until combined. One to three days before you plan to grill, generously sprinkle the salt-sugar rub over the entire pork shoulder, covering every surface. You may not need the full 1/4 cup of rub. (A good rule of thumb is 2 teaspoons per pound of meat). If you're lucky enough to have a shoulder with skin on it, score the skin in a crosshatch pattern, leaving an inch or so between the lines. Try to work some of the rub into the scorings. Refrigerate the pork shoulder uncovered. Bring to room temperature before you put it on the grill.",
      "Prepare a gas grill for smoking. Soak the wood chips in water for about 30 minutes; set aside. On a section of the grill that won't receive direct heat, place a disposable pan or tray beneath the cooking grate and directly on the flavorizer bars or lava rocks (whichever your grill has). Fill the pan about halfway with water; this will catch drippings and keep the inside of the grill moist. Set the cooking grate back on the grill. Adjust the burners so the temperature in the grill is somewhere between 200\u00b0F and 300\u00b0F. Keep the burners under the drip pan off, and those not under it on. Drain the wood chips and place them in a smoker box. A few minutes before putting the meat on the grill, set the smoker box directly over the heat source. (Smoke works best early in the cooking process). Place the shoulder on the grill above the drip pan, skin or fat side up.",
      "Cover the grill and roast the pork shoulder for 4 to 6 hours. The time it takes will vary depending on your piece of meat, the grill, and the cooking temperature. Lower temperature is better but takes much longer to cook. Whichever temperature you choose, check occasionally to make sure it does not exceed 300\u00b0F or fall below 200\u00b0F. When the temperature of the interior of the meat is 195\u00b0F, it should be done. Don't be alarmed if the temperature of the pork shoulder rises quickly and then stays at 150\u00b0 for a long time (sometimes for several hours). This is called the \"stall.\" Be patient and wait for it to reach 195\u00b0F. Check to see if the meat feels relaxed to the touch or if you can pull it apart with a fork. If it resists, give it another 30 minutes.",
      "The meat should by now be a deep brown color. If the outside of the shoulder doesn't have some dark, crispy areas (i.e., bark or, if you started with the skin, crackling), crank up the temperature to 500\u00b0F for a few minutes. (Keep a close eye on it so it doesn't burn.) Remove the meat from the grill and let it rest for at least 20 to 30 minutes.",
      "Combine the vinegar, water, sugar, salt, hot pepper flakes, and black pepper in a medium-size bowl and stir until the sugar and salt have dissolved; set aside.",
      "Either pull the pork shoulder apart with a fork or roughly chop with a cleaver, incorporating crispy bits of crackling (if you have it) or bark. Mix in a generous splash of the vinegar BBQ sauce; adjust the seasoning, making sure there's enough acid (vinegar) and salt. Put the remainder of the sauce in a pitcher on the table. Serve with soft rolls. Coleslaw and beans and rice make good accompaniments."

Clean and slice up your shiitake mushrooms and set aside. Just use the caps as the roots are sometimes tough. To clean, just brush off lightly with a clean & slightly damp kitchn towel.",
      "Clean your ginger root (just brush any dirt off as I use the skin as well) & peel your garlic and onion. Wash ur Cilantro and put about a handful to the side for later and the rest you'll chop up with ur onions & garlic. In food processor on pulse chop up your ginger root, garlic, onions, and cilantro together to make the base of the sauce. I like it to be minced well but not too fine.(I like to get a little bite of ginger every now and again). In a non reactive pan or non-stick skillet, put in a little olive oil to sautee your mushrooms,ginger, garlic, onions and cilantro. As the mushrooms will make a natural broth be careful not to add too much chicken broth at this point. You're looking for a saucy consistency...a little thick not too thin)Add in ur sweet chili sauce following the same rule as the chicken broth (not too much but to taste depending on how hot you want it). Let everything marry together for a few, taste it and if you want add some fresh lemon and or lime juice. U can also add at this time some red pepper flakes if u want more of a kick. Taste it again and if the base meets your liking, you can now toss in the shrimp and let them cook in the sauce till they just turn pink (be sure not to over cook the shrimp as they'll become rubbery if you let them go too long. Once the shrimp are nice and pink remove pan from the heat and u can start plating up your dish. With the cilantro you put to the side...do a quick rough chop and sprinkle on top of the dish to make final presentation."

When onion starts to become translucent add the jalapeno peppers, stir in for about two minutes. Add the yellow squash and zucchini in small batches, stirring constantly, raise heat if necessary. As the squash heats it will release liquid and shrink, at that point add more squash. It should take about four additions. At this point you should have a pretty full pan. Add the Chili Sauce and the corn. Continue stirring over medium heat for about four to five minutes. You want the squash to be heated thru and hot but not mushy - do not overcook. It should be al dente. At this stage you can turn the mixture out into a very large serving bowl or keep it in the pan for the next step. Immediately add the shredded cheese of your choice. Toss thoroughly, let sit for five minutes. Enjoy. Excellent as a main dish or as a side dish with grilled chicken or steak."
