      "Remove seeds from pear halves with a large melon baller, and trim off 1/4 inch from the bottom of each pear half so it will stand upright on a plate. Place the water in a 12-inch nonstick skillet and pour the sugar into the center of the pan, taking care not to let the crystals adhere to the sides of the pan. bring to a boil over high heat, stirring occasionally, until the sugar is fully dissolved and the mixture is bubbling wildly. Add the pears to the skillet, cut-side down, cover, reduce the heat to medium-high, and cook until the pears are nearly tender (a paring knife inserted into the center of the pears feels slight resistance).",
      "Uncover, reduce the heat to medium, and cook until the sauce is golden brown and the cut sides of the pears are partly caramilzed, 3 to 5 minutes. Pour the heavy cream around the pears and cook, shaking the pan back and forth, until the sauce is a smooth, deep caramel color and the cut sides of the pears are beautifully golden 3 to 5 minutes.",
      "Remove the pan from the heat. Using tongs, carefully remove the pears from the pan and place cut-side up on a wire rack set over a trimmed baking sheet. Cool slightly. Season the sauce left in the pan with salt to taste and the crushed black pepper, then pour it into a liquid measuring cup.",
      "Carefully (the pears will still be hot) stand each pear half upright on an individual plate and arrange a wedge of the blue sheese beside it. Drizzle the plate and some of the pear with the caramel sauce. Serve immediately. (Alternatively, the pears can be stood upright on a large serving platter, and the warm caramel sauce and the blue cheese can be passed separately.).",
      "TECHNIQUE: Coring a Pear 1. Cut the fruit in half from stem to blossom end. Use a melon baller to cut around the central core with a circular motion. 2. Draw the melon baller from the central core to the top of the pear, removing the interior portion of the stem as you go."

Now if the chicken isn't pounded, put your chicken breasts between saran or plastic wrap and pound with a meat mallet, rolling pin or even a heavy skillet to flatten. Don't go too far, but you want a nice thin fillet. Then dredge the chicken breasts in the flour mixture. Then set to the side on a plate while you start the pasta.",

      "So as the pasta boils, heat up the butter and oil in a large pan, non stick preferred. Add the chicken and lemon slices and saute 3-4 minutes per side until the chicken is golden brown. It doesn't take long. Flip the lemon a couple of times to get golden brown. Once done, remove the chicken to a plate along with the lemons and cover with foil to keep warm.",

      "Sauce -- To the pan you cooked the chicken in, add the shallot and cook just a minute, then add the flour and whisk in, then add the wine, broth and lemon juice and cook until reduced by half, about 3-4 minutes on a medium heat. Reduce and add the cream, thyme, parsley, basil, salt and pepper and any juices from the chicken plate.",
      "Serving -- Toss the pasta with the garlic oil, lemon pepper, salt and lemon juice. Plate up some pasta on each plate. Top with one of the chicken breasts and then drizzle with the wine sauce. Garnish with a couple of the lemon slices and just enjoy!"

Since you will be growing bacteria, make sure it stays the good kind by remembering food safety cleanliness rules - boil all equipment or run it through your dishwasher if you can and always make sure to keep contaminated or unwashed items from touching any of the equipment, milk or cultures you are working with at all times.",
      "Mix the dry and liquid milk together and heat at least to 190\u00b0F Hold at that temperature for 10 minutes to give the proteins a chance to do their thing. Be careful not to ruin the batch by burning it on the bottom of the pot - you can use a double boiler if you have one.",
      "Cool the milk mix to at least 120\u00b0F but not below 100\u00b0F You can reheat the milk mix if it goes below 100\u00b0F.",
      "Put part or all of the cooked milk mix in a blender - depending on the size of your blender - with the tablespoon of Siggis (make sure you taste a bit of the Siggis if you haven't tasted it yet so you know what your results should taste like - and keep any extra in your freezer for your next batch) and blend well - 10 seconds should do it. Mix with any of the extra milk if your blender is not big enough to hold all the mixed cooked milk and Siggis.",
      "Pour the cooled, mixed and blended milk into 8 oz cups and place in your yogurt-maker (if you have one) and start it or put the cups in a cooler with a large bottle (quart or more) of hot water - at least 140\u00b0F Be sure the cups do not touch the water bottle. If the water is too hot, it will cook the yogurt rather than allow the yogurt culture to do it's thing.",
      "After 5 - 8 hours, check for firmness and if it is firm (will not jiggle if jostled), put in your fridge. Taste your new yogurt after it has had time to cool down in your fridge. (I have had yogurts firm up in as little as 3 hours and remember that the longer it continues in the yogurt maker or cooler, the more tangy your yogurt becomes.",
      "Please note that the \"cooking time\" shown here is really the culture time and it can vary from a couple-3 hours to 8 or more hours, with the temperature having the greatest effect on the length of time to complete. Too hot and it will cook - no yogurt; too cold and it will take forever/never - no yogurt. That is why we recommend a temperature controlled yogurt-maker of your own choosing.",
      "And the best news of all -- once you do this, you can make just about any kind of yogurt you want to - just buy either the active yogurt cultures (you can find them online) or buy a plain yogurt of the type you want with active cultures and make it according to the instructions in this recipe.",

Add artichoke heart pieces to the pan and turn to combine and heat through. Season vegetables with and remove from heat to a bowl. (NOTE -- I didn't not use the full amount of artichokes - since, I cut the recipe in half, I was only using one can of artichokes, but it seemed like a lot so I used about half the can. So use your own judgement when adding the artichokes.).",

Place a colander over ravioli as it cooks and add asparagus to it. Cut thin, trimmed asparagus into 2-inch pieces on an angle. Steam the chopped asparagus while pasta cooks, 2 to 3 minutes, until just fork-tender, but still green. Remove asparagus and add to bowl with spinach and artichokes. Place colander in your sink and drain ravioli.",

Brine chicken in 2 quarts of water with 1/2 cup of sugar and 1/2 cup of salt whisked inches Refrigerate for 30 to 60 minutes. Heat oil (about 4 cups) to 350 degrees Farenheit in a 4 quart pot. Dry chicken and dredge in 1/2 Celsius cornstarch, shaking off any excess. Coat with batter and carefully drop into the oil, cooking for 5 to 7 minutes. Chicken will be light in color, but remove to a cooling rack or paper bags/towels. When all chicken is par-fried, reheat oil to 350 degrees. Dip fried chicken pieces into batter again and fry for another 5 to 7 minutes, then drain again. In a medium bowl, microwave honey and hot sauce for one minute. Place chicken pieces, one at a time, into warm mix and roll around until completely coated. Remove to a cooling rack. Enjoy hot or cold. Even when chilled, the chicken will remain super crispy."

It's okay to stir it occasionally while melting it. Your wooden spoon will get a crusty layer that washes off easily. Xylitol isn't sticky even when hardened and clean up is a breeze! The xylitol when melted is very, very hot. Be careful and use something that can withstand the temperature - I've used ordinary glass mixing bowls and pyrex measuring bowls without problems. Plastic would probably melt. 2 cups of crystal Xylitol will be less than 2 cups of melted Xylitol - that's okay. It's sweeter than sugar!",

By the time the melted mixture returned to room temperature, the darn stuff would be rock hard and inedible. However, if you don't melt the Xylitol and try to use the crystals creamed with your butter/margarine, it stays too crystallized and gives the frosting an unpleasantly crunchy texture.",
      "I've finally come upon the perfect balance. It's still very sweet but stays creamy when spread and it's so much better for you!",

      "When cooled to room temperature, spread on your cooled pan of pumpkin bars. For me, if I start the frosting as soon as the bars start cooking, they're usually cooled and ready at the same time.",
