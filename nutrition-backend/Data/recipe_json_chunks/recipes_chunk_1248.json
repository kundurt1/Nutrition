With the machine running, slowly add the oil, then the water through the feed tube; continue to process until the dough forms a ball, about 15 seconds. Generously dust the work surface with flour. Using floured hands, transfer the dough to the work surface and knead lightly, shaping the dough into a ball. Lightly oil a 1-quart measuring cup with cooking spray, place the dough in the measuring cup and cover tightly with plastic wrap. Set aside in a draft free place until doubled in volume, 1 to 1 - 1/2 hours.",
      "PIZZA SAUCE: Mix this up while the dough is rising, giving the flavors some time to meld.",
      "Preheat the oven to 550 degrees F. This may take as long as 30 minutes, so allow enough time for the oven to get hot. Remove all racks except the one holding your baking stone, for easier positioning of pizza onto the stone.",
      "BUILDING: When the dough has doubled, grease hands with olive oil and remove it from the measuring cup, placing into the middle of a lightly floured board. (A silpat placed on the work surface makes cleaning up easier.) Being careful not to deflate all the air in the dough, roll dough into a ball and set aside. Cover with plastic wrap and let rest for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, cut parchment paper and set aside. Do NOT cut parchment larger than your pizza stone, to mimimize risk of the paper catching fire.",
      "Oiling hands again, gently stretch the dough, shaping it into a large rectangle on the parchment paper. With palms, stretch and flatten the dough until it takes the shape you want it to have, keeping a slightly thicker edge for the crust. Dock the surface of the dough with your fingers to \"texture\" the surface and hold the toppings. Oil the dough before building the pizza.",
      "Place finely cut (or dried) basil across the top of the dough. Add Mozzarella and Provolone cheese slices on top of the basil. Spread a thin, even layer of the pizza sauce, adding pork sausage, shredded Mozzarella and mild cheddar over the top of the dough. (You can really use any toppings you'd like.).",
      "BAKING: Position the baking stone on the bottom rack of your electric oven, or on the floor of your gas oven. Lift the parchment paper and slide onto the bottom of a sheet pan, then quickly slide pizza onto the baking stone. Shut the oven door, and reset your oven for 500 degrees. Bake for 10-12 minutes, until the edges of the crust are browned. Check the bottom of the pizza for doneness before removing from the oven. Using tongs, transfer pie onto oven rack and set aside to cool a few minutes. Cut with a pizza cutter and enjoy!"

The last 5-10 minutes add the blue cheese crumbles and cook until slightly melted. A very simple side dish full of flavor. You can garnish with fresh sage if you want."

      "Season all sides of the beef with salt and pepper. Make sure to season aggressively because the beef has a large surface area, so you need more seasoning to create a solid foundation of flavor.",
      "Take a medium sized pot (or a pot just large enough to fit the beef) and put it over high heat. Put around 1/4 cup of olive oil in the pot, and wait until you can see smoke from the oil. That means the oil is hot enough to start searing the beef. Put the beef in the pan, and sear on all sides (around 1 minute on each side).",
      "Once your beef is seared, pour in the curry paste. If the paste does not cover the beef, add water until the beef is covered. Turn the heat down to low and simmer for 1 hour, or until the beef is tender. You'll know when the beef is tender when you can pull it apart with a fork with ease.",
      "Once the beef is tender, take the beef out and shred the beef with 2 forks. Pull the beef apart to create these strands of beef, which is going to create a great texture to your beef. Once the beef is done, place back into the pot and simmer until your curry thickens a bit and darkens in color (around 30 minutes). This lets the meat and curry flavors really intensify and develop.",
