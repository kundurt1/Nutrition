Fortunately, a little saffron goes a long way. This spice is integral in many traditional dishes such as the Swedish saffron buns mentioned, risotto milanese, bouillabaisse, and paella. Powdered saffron loses its flavor and can often be adulterated with imitations. Buy a small quantity of high-quality threads, and crush or steep just before using. Store saffron airtight in a cool, dark place.",
      "This cake isn't overly sweet, but it is topped with pearl sugar, which you can sometimes find among the icing and cake decorating items in the grocery store. Regular granulated sugar would work in a pinch, but we highly recommend using either pearl or turbinado sugar. Make sure to use high-quality saffron threads."

You'll need regular, not competition-style, charcoal. For the Weber smoker, you'll also need 4 fist-size chunks of applewood.",

      "Hang ribs from rods in smoker, leaving space between slabs. Meat should sit at least a few in. above coals; if not, move hooks in ribs to three bones down. Set lid in place.",

      "Set firegrate in bottom section, top with charcoal ring, and fill ring halfway with regular charcoal briquets. Distribute 4 fist-size chunks applewood in charcoal.

As ribs cook, adjust vents if needed to keep temperature at 250\u00b0 to 275\u00b0, always leaving top vent and at least 1 of bottom vents partially open so fire doesn't go out.",

      "Casserole Basics: Glass and ceramic (earthenware) dishes work best for casserole cooking because they heat up quickly and evenly. If you substitute a metal baking pan, the casserole usually cooks more slowly, so you may have to increase the oven temperature by 25\u00b0 to compensate.",
      "Always start with the freshest seafood available and pat it dry. If you use individual steaks or fillets, select pieces that are at least 1 inch thick. If a single fillet from a large fish tapers to a thin end, fold the thin end under to help the fillet cook uniformly.",
      "If the fillet in the casserole is thick, let it sit at room temperature while you prepare the other ingredients for the dish. It will cook more quickly.",
      "Thick fillets or steaks, especially if covered with a sauce or topping, can take from 12 to 15 minutes of baking time per inch. To check for doneness, cut into the fillet at the thickest part to see if it's opaque inside and pulls apart with little resistance.",
      "Casserole recipes calling for fully or partially cooked seafood or fish need only enough time in the oven to get hot, so an instant-read thermometer comes in handy. If the middle of the casserole registers 160\u00b0, it's done.",

      "Don't cook fish until it flakes easily-- by that point, the fish has given up all of its juices, rendering it dry and leaving a lot of water in the dish. If this occurs, spoon the juices back over the fish when serving.",
      "Remember, the casserole will continue cooking once it's pulled from the oven, so it's better to take it out sooner rather than later."

Add the garlic slices and cook over low heat, shaking the skillet a few times, until golden brown, about 3 minutes.

Season with salt and pepper and stir well.",

Pour the pan juices into a medium saucepan; add the remaining 5 cups of stock. Whisk 1 cup of the stock mixture into the flour paste, then whisk the mixture into the saucepan. Bring to a boil over moderately high heat, whisking constantly until thickened. Simmer over low heat, whisking occasionally, until no floury taste remains, about 10 minutes. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon of Madeira. Season the gravy with salt and pepper. Transfer to a warmed gravy boat. Carve the turkey and serve with the stuffing and gravy.",
