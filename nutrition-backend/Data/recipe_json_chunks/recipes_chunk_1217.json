      "NOTE: Make sure that the shells fill up the pan you don't want them rolling around in the pan. You want a tight fit or where they are all snug. You can always use a smaller pan if necessary, but for me a 13x9 usually works out well.",
      "Bake -- 375 for about 40 minutes (note, I have made this in a couple of different ovens and one time it was bubbly and hot in 30 minutes, so just check after 30 minutes to be safe. It really has to do with you oven temperature, but I have found 375 seems to work best). I covered for 30 minutes and then uncovered for the last minutes of cooking time to get the cheese bubbly.",

The 1/4 of the nori without the rice will be the section that seals the roll.",
      "Along the centre of the rice place your fillings.",
      "Now start rolling. Lift the edge of the mat closest to you. I use the mat to just start the roll, but you can use the mat for the whole of the rolling process. Once the roll is started, I pull back the mat and finish rolling (reasonably firmly) by hand, keeping the fillings tucked in as I go. Then I wrap the mat around the roll, and, with firm, even pressure, I run my hands along the mat, thus creating an even and well sealed roll. If the roll doesn't seal completely, I use a finger dampened in the water and rice solution to help it.",
      "Using a very sharp knife damped in the water and vinegar solution cut the rolls into the size desired - in half for longer rolls like those sold at many take away shops, or into 6 or 8 pieces for the smaller servings as shown in the photograph.",

Cut up the chives into fours and add them to the cheese and chicken (about 1/4 cup if you had cut them up into small pieces or however much you like. Just eyeball it). Add some salt and pepper to taste. Put in the cottage cheese and turn the processor on until the mixture is smooth. Taste for seasoning. The filling should be seasoned very well and if you need to add more then do so now because you will not get a chance to do it until they are cooked. Add the egg and mix until smooth. Use a small mellon baller or two spoons to get about a teaspoon of the mixture onto the wonton wrapper. Use water and your index finger to wet two sides of the wanton and fold over the corner to make a triangle. Make sure you get all the air out of the wonton. Repeat until you make about 30 or so. Boil 2 quarts of water and season the water with salt. Cook the raviolis until they float. About 3-4 minutes. Strain and serve with whatever sauce you like. I used browned butter with lemon zest and basil but anything will do! Enjoy!"

Beat in molasses. Stir or beat in the flour mixture until evenly incorporated. If the dough seems very soft, stir in up to 3 tbls more flour. Divide the dough in half. Place each portion between large sheets of wax paper. Roll out each portion 1/4\" thick; check underside of the dough and smooth out any wrinkles that may form. Stack the rolled portions (paper still attached) on a baking sheet. Refrigerate for 1 1/2 hours, or until chilled and firm or freeze for 45 minutes to speed chilling.

Check the consistency of the glaze and thin it with a few drops of water, if necessary. Using a table knife, spread a smooth, even layer of glaze over the top of each cookie, spreading it all the way to the edges. Bake the cookies as soon as the glaze is on. Reroll any dough scraps and continue baking as directed above. Bake the cookies, one sheet at a time, in the middle of the oven for 11-13 minutes or until glaze is just tinged with brown. Reverse sheet halfway through baking to ensure even browning from front to back. Transfer the sheet to wire rack and let stand until the cookies firm up slightly. 1-2 minutes. Using a spatula, transfer the cookies to wire rack to cool completely. Store in a single layer or layered with wax paper in an airtight container for up to 2 weeks or freeze up to 1 month."

      "In a medium-sized bowl, beat the butter and sugar until light and fully. Add the egg, vanilla, baking powder, salt, lemon oil, and lemon powder, beating on medium speed until well blended. Add the flour and coconut, beating until thoroughly combined. Use food color to tint the cookies yellow. Gel-paste food color will give the most intense color; be aware that with paste colors, you only need to add the merest touch. Dip a toothpick in the color, and then dip it into the dough. Repeat a couple of times. Mix the dough, adding more color until it's as intense as you like.",
      "To shape the cookies: Place the coarse sugar in a small bowl. Drop the dough by tablespoonfuls into the bowl, one at a time, shaking the bowl to coat with sugar. Gently roll cookies into smooth balls with your hands, then transfer to the prepared baking sheets.",
      "To bake the cookies: Bake the cookies for 9 to 10 minutes, for soft cookies. For crunchier cookies, bake for 12 minutes, until they're barely beginning to brown around the edges. Remove from the oven, and after a few minutes transfer them to a rack to cool.",
      "Variation: You can make these cookies using fresh lemons instead of lemon powder and lemon oil (though they won't be nearly as intensely citrus-y). Substitute 1/4 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice (the juice of one medium-large lemon), and the grated rind from one lemon. You may also omit the coconut and/or food coloring, if you like. Bake the cookies for 12 minutes, until they feel barely set in the center (for softer cookies); or 14 minutes (for crisper cookies)."

Wrap the pumpkin puree with the paper towels; this will soak up the excess water in the pumpkin puree. Continue to remove excess water from the pumpkin puree for about 60 minutes before making cheesecake mixture. Bring the remaining ingredients for the filling to room temperature while the pumpkin puree is being drained. With a mixer, beat cream cheese until smooth; add eggs one at a time and then combine all ingredients for the filling in a mixer. Blend until very smooth. For best results, allow all ingredients to reach room temperature before mixing the filling. Remove crust from refrigerator, and pour in filling.",

      "When you remove the cheesecake from the oven, set aside and prepare the seasoned cream cheese layer. In a small bowl, combine sour cream, sugar, and spices. Blend well. Spread seasoned sour cream mixture over the baked cheesecake evenly. Place the cheesecake back into the 325 degree oven for about 8 minutes, until the sour cream layer is set.",
      "Whipped Cream:",
      "Allow the cheesecake to cool. When the cheesecake is completely cool, you can add the whipped cream. In a medium sized bowl, combine heavy whipping cream, vanilla, and sugar; mix well with a blender or a stand mixer. Whip the cream until it forms stiff peaks. Remove ring from the spring-form pan and either pipe the whipped cream over the pumpkin cheesecake or spread with a knife.",
