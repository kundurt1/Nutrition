After the flour mixture has warmed to tepid, add the dissolved yeast and beat vigorously for a minute or so until it has become a thick, smooth batter. Thicker than regular pancake batter, but not at all like conventional dough. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise for about 1 1/2 hours, preferably at 80\u00b0F (27\u00b0C) until batter has risen and large bubbles have appeared on the surface (the surface must be bubbly, however long it takes).",

Start filling your leaf by packing the rice mixture into it and thus packing it into the shape of the bamboo steamer.

Put the lid on the bamboo steamer.",

I then fill the pot with hot water up to the bottom of the bamboo steamer and turn the burner onto a higher setting to ensure the water boils quickly. Now put the lid on and let it steam for about 30minutes to an hour.the longer it boils the better the lotus leaf flavor sinks into the rice. You'll have to refill the water so check it every 20 minutes to make sure the pot isnt dry.",

      "Hint-If you choose to make this in a 9x13 cake pan instead of a bundt pan, you could reverse the layers & just bake the pretzel layer in the bottom of the cake pan for 10 minutes without stirring & cool slightly. You need to be very careful spreading the second layer over the pretzel layer. Then the jello layer goes on top & refrigerate overnight. This way you don't have to wait for the jello to set before completing the other 2 layers & you would not unmold. This way works best if bringing to a potluck."

      "Arrange the cantaloupe chunks in a large nonreactive shallow bowl. Cover the surgaces of the fruit completely with ice cubes. Over the ice, sprinkle a thin layer of salt, enough to cover it with the coarse granules. Set the bowl aside at room temperatuer while the ice begins to melt.",
      "When about half of the ice has melted and the remaining ice looks very brittle and crackled, like a shattered windshield, rinse and drain the cantaloupe. (The melting time will vary depending on the heat of the kitchen. Give it about 45 minutes to an hour.).",
      "Return the fruit to the bowl and add the sugar, vinegar and ginger. Stir to dissolve the sugar. Weight the fruit with a plate, cover the bowl with a clean tea towel, and let it stand for at least 12 hours or overnight.",
      "Pour the cantaloupe, syrup, and 1/2 cup of water inot a large saucepan. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat and simmer until liquid is reduced by half and the cantaloupe becomes transparent, about 1 hour.",
      "Meanwhile, wash eight half-pint canning jars that are free of any cracks or knicks and place them in a water-bath canner. Cover with water and bring to a boil. Do this about 25 minutes before the cantaloupe is done simmering. Place a tea kettle or two full of water on the stove and heat to boiling. Just before you are ready to put the cantaloupe in the jars, pour boiling water from the tea kettle over 8 canning lids to sanitize them and soften the rubber seals.",
      "Now ladle the cantaloupe into the prepared jars. Divide the ginger and cinnamon sticks among the jars. Pour syrup to cover the cantaloupe to within 1/2 inch of the rim of the jar (head space). Use a rubber spatula to scrape the sides of the jar and remove any air bubbles that might have accumulated. Clean the jar rims with clean, damp paper towels to remove any syrup or food that would prevent a proper seal. Center canning lids on jars and screw on bands with your finger tips--do not make them too tight!",
      "Place the jars in the canner full of hot water, and make sure the jars are covered by at least 1 1/2 inches of water. You might need to top off the water with some from the heated tea kettles.",
      "Process the jars in a boiling water bath for 10 minutes, counting from the time that the water returns to a boil.",
      "Store the jars in a cool, dark, dry place for several weeks before opening to improve the flavor. Refrigerate after opening."

Spoon dough into prepared pastry bag.",

Holding bag at an angle so tip is a few inches above surface of oil, squeeze out dough, moving the bag as you squeeze so dough is piped in a 6\" length into oil. Using a paring knife, cut off dough at the tip to release into oil. Repeat process to make 4 more dough lengths. Fry churros, turning once and adjusting heat as needed to maintain oil temperature, until golden brown on all sides, 2-3 minutes per side. Transfer to a paper towel-lined baking sheet. Repeat with remaining dough.",
