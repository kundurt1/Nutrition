      "1. For the cake: Preheat the oven to 350*. Grease and flour 2- 8-9\" round cake pans. Sift (or whisk) all dry ingredients in a bowl. Beat together the eggs, buttermilk, oil, and vanilla. Slowly mix in the dry ingredients, and beat for two minutes. Once well combined pour in the hot coffee and mix well. Pour into the cake pans and tap each pan on the counter a few times to remove any large bubbles. Bake for 30-35 minutes, until toothpick inserted comes out clean. Allow the cakes to cool for 10 minutes, then use the edge of the pan as a guide to cut of the round top. This makes a great mid-cake-baking snack! Run a knife around the edges and flip out onto a cooling rack. I like to \"slam\" the cakes out of pan to (hopefully) insure they come out in one piece! Once totally cooled, carefully slice through the middle to make 4 thin round disks. Stack with wax paper in between, then wrap in plastic wrap. Freeze, until ready to assemble. Frozen cakes are SO much easier to handle while frosting. It also helps to keep the frosting from getting crumby!",
      "2. For the ganache: Place the chocolate chips in a glass bowl. Heat the cream, butter and sugar in a small pan. Once the cream is just barely simmering, pour it over the chocolate and allow it to sit for 5 minutes. Then whisk until perfectly smooth. Allow the ganache to cool another 10-15 minutes before assembling layers.",
      "3. For the frosting: Heat the cream in the microwave until hot to the touch, then add the instant coffee to it and mix. Place the cream in the freezer for a few minutes to cool rapidly. Using an electric mixer, mix the melted butter, vanilla and cocoa powder until well combined. Alternate, adding the cooled coffee-cream and powdered sugar until smooth. Add a little more cream or powdered sugar until desired consistency is reached.",
      "4. To assemble: Take the cakes out of the freezer. Slather 1/3 of the ganache in between each layer, until all four layers are stacked. Press the top of the cake to level it. Using a large spreader, smooth the frosting around the sides. Then frost the top and re-smooth the edges. Use a damp paper towel to clean up the edges of the cake stand. Place the last bit of the frosting in a piping bag to \"fancy-up\" the edges, if you want!",
      "5. Leave the cake out, at room temperature so the insides can thaw. Cake taste better when the frosting and filling are room temperature and soft!"

Roll tablespoon size cookies into a ball and press onto sheet. (I use a baking stone so I am not sure if you will need to grease and ordinary sheet.) Cook for about 10 minutes or until they look set. They will not brown the same as ordinary cookies because they do not have white or brown sugar in them so don't wait for them to brown! I would recommend pressing lightly on the top of one to see if it is set. Enjoy! Makes 2 dozen cookies."

Place all ingredients, except the flour and oil into a food processor and puree until smooth. Into a large mixing bowl, pour the contents of the food processor. Slowly add the flour until a thicker consistency is formed. I originally started with 2 cups of flour, but ended up needing 3 1/2 to get the right consistency. Place the entire bowl in the fridge for 20-30 minutes to stiffen up and make it easier to handle when forming the patties. Form into to burger patties. Fry until golden brown on both sides. Freeze any uncooked patties between layers of wax paper. Makes about 16 patties."

If the dough is tacky after all of the flour has been added, add an additional one or 2 tablespoons of flour.",

If you use a dough hook, do give the dough a few last turns by hand. You want a consistency that is smooth elastic and somewhat soft.",

Place a baking sheet as close in size as possible to that of an oven rack on the middle rack. The sheet mimics an oven floor. Sprinkle a second, smaller baking sheet well with cornmeal.",

Lower the oven heat to 400, spritz the interior of the oven 3 or 4 times with the mister and immediately slide the bread in, on its baking sheet, across the baking sheet already in the oven. Bake the bread 40 to 60 minutes, opening the oven and spritzing the inside once more, halfway through the baking. The bread is done when it is golden brown and sounds hollow when thumped on its bottom. Cool the bread on a wire rack."

      "Meatballs -- Combine the pork, mushrooms, scallions, garlic, rice cooking wine, hoisin sauce, salt & pepper. Mix everything together and then form meatballs. I make mine about golf ball size. TIP: After making them, I like to put them on a sheet on parchment and then put in the freezer for just 10 minutes as I start the noodles. This just helps when I go to saute them. It is optional, but does help.",
      "Noodles -- As the meatballs cool off, make the oriental noodles. Now if your grocer doesn't have oriental noodles in the Asian or Oriental Section, use spaghetti. Cook accordingly to the directions. Drain and add to a serving bowl.",
      "Mix the soy sauce, scallions, garlic, red pepper flakes, sesame oil and vegetable and pour over the noodles and toss. Cover and refrigerate. Sometimes before serving, I like to garnish with just a little sesame oil and peanuts if you want, but sometimes I don't. I like the simple flavors. but go easy, the sesame oil is very strong.",
      "Dipping Sauce -- Meatballs are almost ready, but make a quick 1 minute dipping sauce for them. Mix the soy, hoisin and lime. That is it. Just set it in a bowl to the side.",
      "Now -- Dipping sauce is done -- sesame noodles are done and chilling, meatballs are chilled and ready to cook. As they cook we will put a 5 minute salad together and dinner is served.",
      "Meatballs -- In non stick pan heat up the oil to medium high and add the meatballs. Just a few seconds on each side to get a little golden, but remember, we aren't trying to cook them, just a light sear is all. Not too long, maybe 2 minutes total is all you need. Then add the chicken broth and cover and let them simmer and steam on medium low to low. Should take about 10 minutes. Don't over crowd the pan by stacking the meatballs, but a big enough pan should work just fine. DON'T peak either.",
      "Salad -- Now the easy part. As the meatballs steam. Do a quick salad on the side. Slice up some Napa cabbage and add to a serving bowl, add a can of sliced water chestnuts, a can of mandarine oranges and thin slice a small red onion, and about 1/2 of a seedless cucumber, skin on is fine. Just toss and then serve with a quality sesame dressing. I don't like many bottled dressing but there are a few out there that are really pretty good. Make it easy on yourself. You can always add mushrooms, red peppers, or any other vegetables you like but I like it really simple for this salad.",
      "Now 3 courses and just 30-40 minutes."

Poach the balance of the meatballs the same way and transfer to the bowl with a slotted spoon. Re-cover with foil and keep warm.",
      "FOR THE SAUCE: Boil poaching liquid hard until it has reduced to 2 cups-about 20 minutes. Meanwhile, melt the butter in a small heavy saucepan over moderately low heat; add shallots and stir fry about 5 minutes until limp and golden but not brown. Blend in flour and mellow 2 to 3 minutes over low heat. When poaching liquid has reduced sufficiently, whisk about half of it into the flour paste, stir this mixture back into pan of poaching liquid and cook, stirring constantly, until thickened and smooth-about 3 minutes. Stir in the capers, then return all meatballs to pan and warm them very slowly in the sauce for 10 to 15 minutes with the kettle lid set on askew.",
      "NOTE: If you turn burner heat to lowest point, you can hold the meatballs at this point for nearly an hour; just make certain that the sauce does not boil. (Use a flame tamer underneath the saucepan.) And if the sauce should thicken too much, thin with a little water.",
      "When ready to serve, smooth the sour cream into the sauce and warm, stirring ever so gently so as not to damage the fragile meatballs, for about 5 minutes longer. Serve with boiled new potatoes an assertive green vegetable such as Brussels sprouts or broccoli.",
      "Serves 4 to 6.",

(6) You have a flash of something vague involving the nearest plastic bag. (7) Suddenly you find yourself running faster than your kitty leaves her \"office of business\". (8) Racing thoughts of panic and doom pervade you, and you just know you are going to die. (9) You want to shout out words of distress, BUT --.(10) The beans cross the finish line first.
