Drain and rinse 2 (15 oz) cans aduki beans (I found them at the whole grocer; kidney beans work in a pinch, but they won't be exactly the same). Bring to a boil with enough water to cover by 1-inch and 1-2 cups of your favorite sweetener (I use 1 1/4 cups raw sugar). Reduce heat and simmer until the beans are soft (just starting to fall apart) and there is little water left (add more water if it cooks off before the beans are done - about 90 minutes). At this point you have Tsubu-an (red beans simmered with sugar).",

In a bowl, whisk together brown sugar, soy sauce, hoisin sauce, sweet chili sauce, ginger, red pepper flakes, garlic and lime juice. Set aside for now.",
      "When you are ready to cook, heat a large skillet over medium high heat and add 1 Tbsp of olive oil. Add the chicken, salt and pepper. Cook chicken about 3 minutes on each side until brown on each side. Set chicken aside on plate and cover (Note: we always cut one piece of chicken open before eating to make sure it's cooked. Alternatively, you could use a thermometer and check that it's reached a temperature of about 155 Fahrenheit-slightly underdone since you will be putting it back on the heat).",

I'd use a mild lard; it's flavor isn't obtrusive. A 4.5 lb. Long Island duck typically yields about 8 oz confit meat (equal parts leg and breast meat).",

This includes two 6\" sugar cookies with chocolate chips (double the recommended recipe), buttercream in two colors, raw cookie dough balls, a template of your choice and an Exacto knife for cutting out the template. In your prep, create the Totoro template.",
      "Making the cookies: Place a baking mat or parchment paper on a half sheet pan (a baking mat is easier because it's heavier. Spread the cookie dough across a half sheet pan and then place chocolate chips. Place a piece of parchment paper over this and then roll out the dough until desired thickness. (Pro tip: the cookie won't get any thinner than your thickest chocolate chips. If you'd like a thinner cake use mini chocolate chips.).",
      "Refrigerate for 1/2 hour until completely firm. Lightly outline the Totoro template and then peel the template away. Now make slices all the way around the cake to prep for removing. Next, you can cut by re-outlining the original template. Then remove all of the remaining pieces.",
      "Baking: Refrigerate the cookie for 15 minutes then bake directly. Bake until barely seeing brown around the edges. (Pro tip: because this cookie is larger it helped to have another baking sheet in the oven on the top level. Let completely cool.).",
      "Fill, crumb coat and frost the cake: Place the first layer of the cookie cake on a serving tray. Now pipe an outline of buttercream with a large star tip. Inside of that outline, place the chocolate chip cookie dough. Alternate to your liking.",

      "Final decorating: Place the second layer of the cake now. Create two outlines using an edible marker-one for Totoro's body and then the second for his belly. Pipe buttercream using star and round tips of your choice (try Wilton tip size 10 and 199). Now add his eyes (these were candies) and stomach arrows for a finishing touch! (Pro tip: for more color you could fill his belly with candy!)."

Stir in the spinach and 1 cup of the bechamel sauce. Taste for salt and pepper. If the sausage is highly seasoned, you may not need any. Remove from the heat and let cool slightly, then stir in the cheese. Bring a large pot of water to a boil and add salt to taste. Have ready a large bowl of cold water, and spread out some lint-free (not terry cloth) kitchen towels on a flat surface. Add the pasta squares to the pot a few at a time and cook less than 1 minute; they should be slightly underdone. Scoop the pasta out of the pot and place it in the cold water until cool enough to handle, then lay the pasta squares out flat on the towels. Continue cooking and cooling the remaining pasta in the same way. Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F Butter two 11 x 8 x 2-inch baking dishes.

      "Day One: For those making the starter from scratch: combine 1 cup milk, 1 cup sugar, and 1 cup flour in a large zip lock bag and mush to mix ingredients. For those receiving the fermented batter in a gallon zip lock bag: Do nothing. Leave it to sit on the counter.",
      "On days 2-4: Squeeze the bag several times during the day. (If air builds up in the bag, open the zip lock slightly and remove the air). I took mine to work, laid it on my desk, and to relieve stress squeezed the bag several times during the day. Ha ha ha!",
      "On day 5: add 1 cup milk, 1 cup sugar, and 1 cup self-rising flour to the bag. Squeeze the bag several times during the day.",
      "On days 6-8: Squeeze the bag several times during the day.(remove air).",
      "On day 9: Add 1 cup milk, 1 cup sugar, and 1 cup self-rising flour into the bag. Close zip lock. Squeeze the bag several times during the day.",
      "Day 10: Pour 1/2 cup \"starter\" in four (4) separate gallon zip lock bags. These starters replace the milk, flour, and sugar used to start the very first batch from scratch. Give the four bags to friends along with the steps on how to finish making their own starters and bread, or freeze the starters for future use if desired, just be sure that once you take a starter out of the freezer, you let it sit out one day before starting your steps.",
      "In a large glass bowl add 2 cups self-rising flour, 1 cup of sugar, 3 eggs, 1 cup oil, 2 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 cup milk, 1 tsp vanilla, 1 large box (or 2 small boxes) of instant vanilla pudding, 1/2 cup of either raisins, nuts, chocolate chips or fruit (optional) or 1/4 cup of any two of these ingredients; mix well.",
      "Spray well 2 large loaf pans with cooking spray.",
      "In a small bowl or cup, mix 1 tsp cinnamon and 2 tbsp sugar. Sprinkle about 1/2 to 2/3 in loaf pans, reserving about 1/3 to 1/2 of the mix.",
      "Pour batter into pans.",
      "Sprinkle remaining cinnamon and sugar mix across the tops of the batter.(You may choose to sprinkle the remaining mix after baking the bread).",
      "Bake at 325 degrees for 1 hour.",
      "IMPORTANT NOTES:",
      "You may also make small loaves. If you do, bake at the same temperature, but for 25-30 minutes.",
      "Do not use metal spoon or metal bowl for mixing.",
      "Do not refrigerate at any time during the process. Keep on the counter.",
      "If air builds up in the zip lock. Open the zipper slightly and squeeze the air out, being careful not to let any of the batter out. Quickly reseal.",
      "It is normal for the batter to thicken and bubble during the time it sits on the counter. This is called the fermentation process.",
      "You may replace the nuts or the raisins with chocolate chips or dried fruit (or fresh, not canned or frozen). Or you can eliminate them and just leave it plain. It's great any way you slice it. ;0).",
      "Also, the bread will yield more than four serving. If you do the two large loafs, it will yield how ever large a slice you want it to be. So if sliced about the size of a normal slice of bread, one loaf could yield about 16-18 slices. The serving size listed came off the paper I got with the recipe. I'm not sure why they say four servings. Each of four servings would be 1/2 a loaf."

Humidity will dramatically affect the amount of flour you need to make bread dough. Add a portion of what is called for, mix it in and then begin adding flour in 1/2 cup to 1/4 cup intervals, mixing and adding more when needed, until the dough in your machine just starts to pull away from the sides of the bowl and leaves the bowl sides clean. The dough will be very soft, but not sticky to the touch. That is perfect dough.).",

      "**The promised tip for baking with raisins** If your raisins are particularly dried, they can often scorch and have an almost burnt, bitter taste after further dehydrating in your oven. So, before I add them to mixtures I will be baking, I measure them into a microwave safe container, completely cover them in water and microwave on full power for 1 - 2 minutes. I leave them in that warm water while I mix the rest of my ingredients and then thoroughly drain them just before adding them to my dough or batter. They are plump, juicy and sweet even after the baking is complete."

      "in a non-aluminum, perfectly clean pot bring the milk to 55f. dissolve the citric acid in 1/2 cup water. if using buttermilk then omit the water and you may want it a bit warmer and let it sit an hour with the buttermilk culture to help it ripen better, then again that might be why some people let the drained curds ripen overnight. i say experiment. if using citric acid you don't need to let it ripen, go straight to the next step.",
      "bring the milk to 87-90f and gently stir in the rennet, dissolved in the 1/4 cup water. cover the pot, remove from heat, and let sit undisturbed for 5-10 min or until it looks like custard and you can see a clear separation between the curds and whey. if you poke a clean finger into it, it should separate cleanly, hence being called a \"clean break\".",
      "with a long knife, cut the curd into 1/2 inch cubes by making a grid across your pot of custard and then running the knife diagonally to break up horizontally as much as possible without the curds dissolving. be gentle with your curds, they're not cheese yet!",
      "stirring gently, bring the curds and whey to between 97 and 105f (instructions vary, i figure around 100 is good enough).",
      "remove from heat and continue stirring gently (just enough to keep the curds from matting together) for 2-5 minute.",
      "some instructions say to drain the whey (save to make ricotta!) through several layers of cheesecloth lining a strainer and let ripen at room temp overnight to develop flavors and acids. others say to use a slotted spoon to lift the curds out of the whey and proceed directly to the stretching stage:",
      "in the stretching stage we will slightly melt the curds and then stretch them to develop the texture. you can do this by microwaving the curds for 1 min, kneading with spoons and pressing out as much whey as you can, zap again for 30 seconds and kneed again, then 15 seconds until your curds are stretchy and resemble melty mozza. you're using spoons because it has to get to 145f to stretch, which is way too hot to touch. if you're more of a traditionalist or don't have a microwave you can heat water to just under boiling and lower some curds into the hot water (with your handy slotted spoon) for a few seconds to a min until it's getting a bit melty, then take out and knead (maybe with spoons or wearing thick rubber gloves) and repeat until it looks like mozza (smooth and shiny). either way work in manageable sections and form your cheese into balls of a size that please you.",
      "now make some cold brine and drop your cheese balls in it. this is just salt dissolved in water. the cold part helps solidify the cheese and makes the texture consistent throughout. the salt part adds flavor. the saltier your brine and the longer you soak it, the saltier it will be. i'm going to start with 1/2 cup of salt to 2 cups of water and taste after 15 min of soaking.",
      "this cheese is best eaten fresh but it can also be frozen. if you're keeping it in the fridge then leave it in water or brine to keep it from drying out. try with fresh tomatoes and basil from the garden! add a little pepper and oil and vinegar perhaps? do you feel like a brave homesteader yet? don't forget to make ricotta with your whey! i'll post that recipe soon."
