    "title": "carrot-date glazed fried cauliflower with roasted carrots and black rice",
    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "An hour prior to cooking, take half of your pitted dates (approximately 3-4 dates,) chop roughly, and soak in a ramekin with 1/4 cup of coconut milk and 1/4 teaspoon of Herbes de Provence.",
      "Preheat oven to 435\u00b0 Fahrenheit \r\n\r\nThe black rice simmers for 40 minutes. I do about 1 3/4 cups of water to every 1 cup of rinsed rice; bring the rice and water to a boil in a medium sized saucepan, reduce flame to low, cover, and allow to simmer.",
      "Peel your carrots and add them to a parchment-lined baking tray. Drizzle with 1 tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil and 1 tablespoon of fresh orange juice. Season carrots with freshly cracked black pepper, cayenne pepper, kosher salt (about 1/2 teaspoon of each,) a pinch of Herbes de Provence, massage everything together, and put them in the oven to roast for 35 minutes.",
      "While the carrots are roasting, stir your simmering rice gently, and begin to prepare your dandelion greens and vinaigrette.\r\n\r\nCut away any tough stems on the dandelion greens and chiffonade the remaining leaves. In a small bowl, mix together 1 tablespoon of white wine vinegar, 2 tablespoons of lemon juice, 1/2 teaspoon of lemon zest, 1 teaspoon of coconut nectar (alternately, you could use 1 teaspoon of date puree [2 dates and 1/4 cup of hot water and blend,]) 1 tablespoon of coconut milk, 1 tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil, 1 tablespoon of orange juice, and the slightest drop of sesame oil for its inherent smokiness. Set your dandelion greens and vinaigrette in the refrigerator separately until the vegetables are done.",
      "Get a large well-seasoned cast iron skillet ready by heating it at medium-high on your stovetop while you cut your cauliflower head lengthwise with the stems so the florets do not fall away. You're aiming for 3/4 of an inch thick cauliflower steaks. Add 1 cup of water to the cast iron, then your cauliflower, and cover for 10 minutes to lightly steam.",
      "While the cauliflower is steaming, prepare your dredge station. In the first of three bowls, add 1 cup of flour with 1 teaspoon of salt and 1 tablespoon of black pepper. In the second bowl, add 1 cup of coconut milk, 1/4 cup of water, 1 teaspoon of Herbes de Provence, and mix. In the third bowl, you'll be adding 1 cup of flour, 2 tablespoons of chickpea flour, 1 teaspoon of cayenne, 1 teaspoon of smoked paprika, and 1 teaspoon of mustard powder.",
      "Once the cauliflower is done steaming, remove the cauliflower onto a plate. The water in the skillet should be nearly evaporated; take care to drain any remaining water and dry the cast iron before filling it 2/3 of the way to the top with your neutral, high smoke-point oil (in my case, canola.) Heat the oil with a medium-high flame; we're aiming at 350 to 375 degrees Fahrenheit. While the oil is heating, begin the cauliflower dredge: flour, coconut milk, seasoned flour, and when going from the coconut milk to the seasoned flour, make sure to purposely bring a lot of the coconut milk with you to make more clumps in the flour for a crispier fry.",
      "Like clockwork, the oil should be at the proper temperature by the time you are done battering your cauliflower (I usually get about three good pieces per cauliflower head.) Add your cauliflower to the oil and fry for 4-5 minutes on each side (until golden and flip.) \r\n\r\nOnce both sides are golden, remove the cauliflower from the oil onto a drying rack with paper towels underneath for any residual oil to drain.",
      "Your roasted carrots should be just finishing up. Add 3 roasted carrots to your blender with the dates that are soaking in the coconut milk, the soaking liquid, 1 tablespoon of white wine vinegar, 1 tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil, 1 habanero pepper, 3 teaspoons of freshly cracked black pepper, 1 cup of hot water, and blend until smooth.\r\n* You may need to use the tamper on your blender or chop the carrots first if you don't have a high-powered blender.",
      "Take the remaining dates and slice thinly; you'll be using these to accent the dish.",
      "Grab your dandelion greens and vinaigrette and toss lightly to coat the greens.",
      "For plating, lay down a bed of rice on your plate with a pinch of salt. Place the cauliflower atop of the rice, drizzle over your carrot-date glaze sparingly, grab your dandelion greens, and add a handful to the plate. Top with your fresh dates, drizzle some more of your glaze liberally this time, add a squeeze of fresh lemon, and enjoy!"

      "For those of you who are wondering what a canoli is, it is an Italian dessert consisting of a light crispy cylindrical shaped pastry that is filled with mousse or whipped mascarpone cheese; the shell is usually deep fried and rolled in sugar. To make the canoli dough simply mix together all of the ingredients and need on a flowered surface for five minutes until you have a nice smooth dough, cover the dough and refrigerate for one hour.",
      "It is best to make the honey dew and pineapple salad 3 or four hours before serving so that it can have time to marinade. Chop the pineapple and honey dew into small 1 cm pieces and in a separate bowl mix together the honey, Dijon, and mustard, toss the fruit in with the marinade to coat it. Cover the marinating fruit with plastic wrap and refrigerate until you're ready to serve.",
      "The mascarpone cheese filling is as easy as mixing together all the ingredients adding the finely chopped basil and then cover and refrigerate until serving.",
      "By this point the canolli dough should be ready to roll out. Knead the dough a little to rework the dough, roll it out on a flowered surface to 1/2 a centimetre in thickness; let the dough relax for a few minutes before cutting the circles out. Heat up the vegetable oil in a sauce pot to 375 degrees Fahrenheit; make sure your oil is at least 3 inches deep so that you can fully submerge your taco shells. Use a 4 inch round cutter to cut out circles, or roughly cut out 4\" circles with a knife, you will need a flat ended spatula that is heat resistant close to the same width as your taco shell because you will use it to push the shell into the oil and form the fold in the taco shell (wooden cooking spatulas work well). Place the shells in the oil one at a time and immediately push it down with your flat spatula, keep it submerged until the shell is evenly golden brown; the shell will blister and bubble but that is how they are supposed to look.",
      "Fill the canoli shells with your mascarpone filling and fruit salad, top it off with some freshly cut basil and bing bang boom your done with plenty of time left to enjoy your evening."

Now add about 1/2 cup of the cold water and continue pulsing. Scrape down the sides of the food processor as needed. Add more water, 1 tablespoon at a time and pulsing in between each addition, so that the dough starts sticking together into a loose ball. I ended up adding an extra 3 tablespoons of cold water.",
      "Remove the dough from the food processor. Shape it into a ball and split it in two. Flatten each ball slightly into a disk shape and wrap tightly in plastic wrap. Each of these halves would be enough for a full 8-9 inch pie crust. I took one of the dough balls and squirreled it away into the freezer for later use. The second dough ball I stuck in the refrigerator, to be use for making the lattice for the strawberry-rhubarb tarts. The dough needs to rest in the refrigerator for at least an hour before using.\r\n\r\nMake the strawberry-rhubarb filling. Combine all the ingredients in a large bowl and mix. Let sit for 15 minutes at room temperature.",
      "During this time, pre-heat your oven to 375 degrees. Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Your definitely going to want the parchment paper - these will make a nice mess while baking! Spray the inside of your ramekins with cooking spray and place on the parchment paper-lined baking sheet. Divide the strawberry-rhubarb filling evenly between the ramekins. Dot each ramekin with a few small pieces of butter.",
      "On a well-floured surface, roll our your pastry dough to about 1/8 inch thickness. Cut into thin strips (somewhere between a 1/4 and a 1/2 inch wide works well). Place 4 parallel strips onto of your filled ramekins, leaving a little space between each one. Fold back every other strip, and place one strip of dough perpendicular to the original 4 strips. Unfold the strips. Now repeat, but this time fold back the two strips that did not get folded back the first time, place one strip of dough perpendicular to the original 4 strips. Unfold. Repeat this whole process one more time. Check out the tutorial on lattice making on Simply Recipes site - it's extremely helpful!",
      "Once you have finished the lattice work on all the ramekins, pat down the ends of the strips with your finger. You can trim off the excess dough if there is a lot of overhang. But I kind of like to leave it - it looks rustic and you end up with some nice crunchy dough pieces to eat! Using your finger, dot the top of the dough with a little milk. Sprinkle with sugar.",
      "Place the ramekins in the pre-heated oven for 25 minutes. Then rotate the pan and cover loosely with tin foil to prevent the crust for getting too browned. Continue baking for another 25 minutes. Remove form the oven and let cool. It's best to let the tarts rest for about 30 minutes for the filling to firm up a bit. Serve with ice cream, if you wish."

I make breadcrumbs by lightly toasting 3 - 4 pieces of whatever neutral artisanal or Pullman loaves I have on hand, typically using end pieces.

Remove the pork belly from the oven and let it cool enough to handle.",

      "Notes:\r\n1. This obviously goes much faster if the squash is roasted ahead of time. It also freezes well. To roast a butternut squash, preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Slice the squash in half, discarding seeds and gunk from the center. At this point you can either place it face-up on a baking sheet and drizzle with olive oil or face-down in a casserole dish and fill the dish with about 1/2-inch of water. Bake for about 40-70 minutes, depending on the size of your squash. When it's done, it should easily pierce with a fork. Allow it to cool, then scrape the flesh from the skin, discarding the skin. Mash, then proceed with recipe. This method works for just about any type of squash."

If you add too much egg/water add more flour in the processor- do not try to add by hand. The less you work the pastry the more tender and pliable it will be. I found that I only needed 1/2 and egg and no water but all flour is different.",
      "Once you have a soft dough, bring it together gently into a round disk on a flat surface- ideally with cold, dry hands! Wrap in cling film and chill in the fridge for at least 30 minutes.",
      "On a lightly floured surface roll the dough out into a 10-11 inch circle. The best way to do this is to bash the dough with the rolling pin evenly in one direction, turn it a quarter turn and bash it again the other way, repeat- this helps for a more evenly rolled dough, helps keep the circular shape, stops it from getting to warm and prevents you from over-working the dough.",
      "Place on a baking tray, cover and chill for 10 minutes or until you are ready to assemble the tart.",
      "Firstly, slow roast the tomatoes by setting your oven to 110C/225F/Gas 1. Lay your sliced tomatoes cut side up on a large tray, sprinkle with sea salt, freshly ground black pepper and strew with thyme leaves. Place in the oven until the tomatoes have shriveled up and are mostly dried-up in the centre. You still want them to have a bit of juice. Ideally you would leave the tomatoes in the oven for 5-8 hours (if its a convection/fan oven it will be faster) but you can get away with 2-3 hours if you are really pressed for time- just turn the oven up a notch and keep an eye on them.",
      "Meanwhile, prepare the onions, In a large frying pan (non-stick is fine) heat the oil over a medium-low heat and toss in the onions. Cover the pan and let the onions steam, stirring occasionally until soft (about 10 minutes).",
      "Remove the cover and turn the heat up to medium-high, stir with a wooden spoon every minute or so, scraping the bottom of the pan to release any areas that are sticking. Every so often add a tablespoon or so of water to help prevent too much sticking (which will cause the onions to burn). You want to cook the onions until they have gone a lovely golden colour and appear sticky. You can speed up the process by adding a teaspoon of sugar but it will still take about 20 minutes (longer if you have more onions in the pan). Add the garlic if you are using a minute before you take the onions off the heat. Season to taste with salt and pepper.",
      "Now for the assembly and cooking. Heat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6. Brush your tart tin with oil. Lay the tomatoes cut side down evenly in the bottom of the pan in one layer. Top with your caramelised onions in an even layer.",
      "Beat your goats cheese until soft (if you are using ricotta you will need to season it or add some grated parmesan for extra flavour). Carefully spread the cheese over the onions as evenly as possible.",
      "Lay your pastry over the top of the tart and tuck the edges into the tart tin- if you have more than a couple of centimeters (one inch) of dough around the sides, trim it off with a pairing knife before tucking in the edges. Brush with the lightly beaten egg, using a pastry brush and bake in the oven for about 30 minutes, or until the pastry is golden and appears crispy (it should feel sandy when you touch it). Remove from the oven and allow to stand for 10 minutes before turning it out upside down on a large plate. Garnish with the basil leaves and a drizzle of olive oil."

      "The success of the Pavlova dessert lies in the texture of the meringue. Just for this time, you will have to say \"no\" to the classic French hard meringue. If you squash Pavlova meringue lightly with your fingers, it will melt, not break. Ivory colour on the outside and white candy cotton texture inside. See below. To achieve this, you need to whip the eggs to total death and then be super patient and let the meringue cook very slowly in the oven.",
      "Put together egg whites with starch, vanilla, and half of your sugar. Whip for 2-3 minutes, then add the remaining sugar. I use my favourite kitchen robot (max. speed) and the whole process takes only 4 minutes. If you are using a hand mixer, it might take unto 8 minutes. When ready, your mixture will be so thick and silky, that you can make whatever shape you want and it will not deform.",
      "Now spit your mixture into three parts and put them on to the baking paper.",
      "Meringue does not grow in size in really - just a bit. So, you can leave little space between the three portion. Take a table spoon and form these three parts into similar circles, creating a small groove in the middle to fit in all your berries in the end. Preheat the oven 70-90C/158-194F/fan and cook for 1.5-2 hours. If you are baking the meringue for the fir time, just keep on opening the door of the oven and checking the substance with your finger. It should be crispy on the outside, but very fragile and squashy inside. Meringue should always stay soft and moist. You should be able to lift if from the baking paper quite easily; but be carful, do not break it. It can also catch some ivory tan :). When ready, switch off the oven and keep it inside for another hour. I kept it there overnight - it does not dry easily.",
      "Now take out the layers and create! Just remember: your meringue is so soft and delicate, that fruit and berries can damage it or even make it soggy; so, leave all the decorations for the last minute - right before serving. I used all fruit and berries, that I could find in my local supermarket.. some glossy powder and hard, decorative candies.",
      "My Pavlova does not contain cream, because ballerinas do not eat whipped cream (even on holidays, they do not have the right to be weak). I also do not think, that this dessert needs cream. The true pleasure of the Pavlova comes from the surprisingly soft and airy meringue; while ripe, juicy fruit and berries help to cut off its bitter sweetness."

      "Smear a thin layer of chocolate custard in the center of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Cover the bottom with a layer of graham crackers and spread 1/3 (about 1 1/4 cups) of the chocolate custard on top of the crackers. Sprinkle 1 cup of mini marshmallows over the custard, and torch them lightly with a kitchen torch, until soft and browned. (You can also put them under an oven broiler for 45 seconds.) Repeat two more times and top with a final layer of graham crackers. (There will be four full layers of crackers, and three of pudding).",
      "Warm the marshmallow creme in the microwave or in a saucepan. Spread over the top of the icebox cake and spread while still warm. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or until the crackers have softened to a cakelike texture (test by inserting a thin knife along the side and bringing up a few crumbs). (This can be made up to 24 hours ahead of time, but it is best consumed with a day or two as it will get soggy if it sits too long.)",
      "When ready to serve, brown the top of the cake until tan and toasty with a kitchen torch or under the broiler.",

(To be really sure, reach into the bowl and gently rub out any lumps between your fingers.) Whisk in the egg yolks.",
      "Warm the milk: In a 3-quart (2.8-L) saucepan over medium heat, whisk the sugar into the milk. Warm for 3 to 5 minutes, until the sugar dissolves, bubbles form around the edges, and the entire surface of the milk begins to quiver. Turn off the heat.",
      "Temper the slurry: Pour 1 cup (240 ml) of the hot milk into the bowl with the slurry, whisking constantly. The mixture should come together smoothly, with no lumps. If you see any, add a little more liquid and whisk them out. Pour it back into the pan, counting to 10 and whisking constantly as you pour.",
      "Thicken the pudding: Turn the heat back on to medium and bring the mixture to a simmer, whisking frequently and vigorously, working all the angles of the pot and scraping the bottom. Continue whisking for about 5 minutes, until the custard becomes very thick and starts to boil, with large bubbles that slowly pop up to the surface. Boil for 2 minutes, whisking constantly.",
      "Flavor the pudding: Turn off the heat and stir in the vanilla extract. Stir the chocolate into the pudding and let sit for 2 to 3 minutes. Whisk gently until the pudding is smooth and glossy and has fully absorbed the chocolate.",
      "Chill the pudding: Immediately pour the hot pudding into a shallow container. Place plastic wrap or buttered wax paper directly on the surface of the pudding (if you don't like pudding skin). Cover and refrigerate."

Let the tea leaves steep in the hot milk for 15 to 20 minutes, then strain out the tea leaves. When the milk tea is cool enough, transfer it into a jug or bottle, and keep it in the refrigerator until it's cold.",
      "Tapioca dough: Sift the tapioca starch and make sure no large lumps remain. Pour the water and sugar into a small pot or saucepan, and bring it to a boil. Stir and make sure all the sugar has melted, turn down the heat to low, and then dump the tapioca starch into the pot all at once. Using a firm spatula, stir the pot until everything is evenly mixed and a sticky brown dough forms. Cook this dough over very low heat for 3 to 5 minutes, stirring constantly to prevent the bottom from burning.",
      "Rolling out the pearls: Scrape the dough out onto a clean work surface, and split it into two or three roughly equal portions. This is just to make it easier to work with. The dough will be a little sticky to start with, but should get easier to handle as it cools slightly. (If it's still super sticky, knead in a tablespoon or two of fresh tapioca starch.) Take one of the dough portions, and cover the rest with a cloth or kitchen towel to prevent them from drying out. Then, roll out the piece you have into a long string, roughly 1/4-inch thick. Using a bench scraper, cut the string into 1/4-inch pieces. Roll each little piece of dough in between the palms of your hands and shape it into little spherical balls. After you roll each ball, dust it in some tapioca starch to prevent it from sticking. Repeat until you've rolled out all the dough.",
      "Cooking the pearls: Ready a large pot of water, and bring it to a boil. Add in the tapioca pearls, and keep the water on a rolling boil for 20 minutes until the pearls are cooked through. Stir vigorously in the beginning to prevent the pearls from sticking, but once they start to float, you only need to stir the pot once every few minutes. Once the pearls are cooked, transfer them into a bowl of ice water to stop the cooking process and firm up slightly.",
      "Braising the pearls: To make the braising syrup, add the water and muscovado sugar in a small pot, and bring to a boil. Add in the chilled tapioca pearls, and turn the heat down to a slow simmer. Let the pearls braise for 20 to 25 minutes, until the braising liquid turns thick and syrupy. Keep it warm after it's done cooking.",
      "Serving: To serve, tilt the glass or cup at a 45\u00b0 angle, and place the tapioca pearls close to the lip of the glass, letting them slide down to the base. Repeat this on all sides to get a trippy, tiger stripe-like ripple effect, then add the ice cubes and milk tea. It's best to drink it with a straw so you can get at the pearls as you drink the tea."

The dough should be a bit tough to work with but if the dough is too dry, soak your hands in a bit of water to help knead; if it is too soft, add a bit more flour;\r\nContinue to knead the dough with your hand for about 10 minutes or so and form a ball;\r\nPlace in bowl and cover with plastic wrap and leave to rest for an hour in a darker location (not under the light) or in the fridge;\r\nWhen ready to roll out your pasta, dust your cutting board with flour and semolina;\r\nCut your dough depending on the size of your pasta maker- mine is quite small so I cut the dough into an inch thick piece or so (came out to 5 slices);\r\nRoll out with rolling pin to make a longer piece with the width of the pasta machine size;\r\nPut the sheet through the pasta machine 2-3 times, continously making the setting smaller. This is how you get the right thickness you are looking for for your pasta. I usually end up on setting 4 or 5;\r\nFollow with the pasta machine addition to slice into tagliatelle;\r\nPlace pasta through the pasta machine addition and then place pasta on another cutting board dusted with semolina; and\r\nRepeat for remaining dough.",
      "In a large pot, prepare water for pasta to boil with some sea salt;\r\nWhen water starts to boil, add pasta, stir occassionally and cook for several minutes until it begins to float and is al dente when you taste it;\r\nPlace pasta in colander and let it sit while you prepare the sauce;\r\nPlace butter in pot over medium heat and add garlic once melted;\r\nCook garlic for several minutes to add flavor to the butter;\r\nAdd the spinach and saute in the garlic butter until almost weltering;\r\nLower heat and add mascarpone in and mix in will with wooden spoon;\r\nAdd straciatella di bufula and when it begin to melt well, re add the pasta along with the cream and 1/3 cup of parmigiano reggiano;\r\nMix all together until well combined gently using tongs;\r\nGrate nutmeg and black pepper and season with salt;\r\nTaste to make sure well spiced and add more cream if the pasta needs it ;and\r\nRemove and serve immediately with freshly grated parmigiano reggiano on top."

      "Preheat the oven to 375. Season the beef tenderloin liberally with salt all over. Set a large skillet over high heat and add enough canola oil to just barely cover the skillet in oil. When faint wisps of smoke just begin to appear, add the beef to the skillet. Sear the beef on all sides, so that the exterior looks brown and caramelized. Next, transfer the beef to the oven. After 10 minutes in the oven, use a digital thermometer to check the temperature of the beef. For pink steak, remove the beef from the oven when the thermometer is inserted into the center of the tenderloin and reads 130 degrees. Keep checking every 5 minutes or so until you have reached the desired temperature. When you are happy with the temperature of the beef, remove it from the oven and let it rest for 10 minutes before slicing it.",
      "While the beef rests, finish the sauce. Set the pot of sauce over low heat, and add the butter. Stir gently to incorporate the butter into the sauce. Taste the sauce and add salt as necessary. When your sauce is perfect, slice the beef tenderloin into medallions that are 1 inch thick. Spoon some sauce onto a plate, add a few slices of beef, and top with more sauce. Garnish with chives. Serve and enjoy."

      "(In case you only have access to the large fresh collard bunches, I am giving you the instructions here for preparation first--if you have the pre-washed bags of cut leaves, go to the next step now) Wash your collards thoroughly; take off the leaves, making sure you get any dirt or small rocks cleaned out. After washing, take each leaf by the end of the stem (where it was attached to the plant) and run a very sharp knife along both inside edges of the stem-throw the stem away; the leafy part is the ONLY part of the collards you'll be cooking. At this point you can put them in the pot whole, or slice them up beforehand--either way is fine, just according to your preference. If you don't want to waste the stems, chop'em up and toss'em in your mulch pile.",
      "Put half the greens in a large pot--half the smoked meats go here, then pile on the other half of the greens--the other half of the meat gets laid on top. Cover greens with cold water--stuff the leaves in there, mash them down a bit (there will be more room as they cook), then add your water until it covers the top of the greens.Add your pinch of sugar and vinegar and stir it into the water; next goes your salt, red pepper flakes and Tony Chachere's New Orlean's Seasoning.",
      "Turn the heat on high and cover the pot. When it starts to boil, turn down to medium and set your timer for 2 hours--you're cooking'em long and slow. About two thirds through your time, add thechopped onions and cover again. There are some people who will tell you greens will cook in 30 minutes, but those collards must be young and tender; most of what you will find at the grocery store is a bit older, and yes, more tough, but this cooking method works best for them. Anything less than 2 hours is going to give you chewy greens with a bitter aftertaste, even with that little dab of sugar! TWO HOURS minimum!

If you lowered the heat turn it back up to high, the oil temp will drop dramatically and you want it to recover its temp as quickly as possible for non-oily fries, so make sure the flame is on high, and add the zucchini. Fry the zucchini until golden brown and delicious. Remove to a rack or a brown paper bag lined sheet tray, season them with salt and serve immediately with the basil mayonnaise."

As tempting as it is don't lick! That is a naughty habit. \r\n\r\nPour and spoon the mix into your base and smooth it over with a spatular gently and evenly. As you go to the edges pull the cling film tightly so get a nice even finish. Transfer to the freezer for half an hour or until set. Remove from freezer and\r\nusing a sharp knife, heat the knife slightly over the gas hob and then slice into the cake, this will give you a nice sharp cut. Store in an air tight tin in the \r\nfridge and try not to eat too much at once, this is a very rich tart and only a thin slice is advised at one time."

Pour custard mixture over the bread being sure to fully soak the bread ( you can gently press down bread with a fork so milk custard rises above the bread) . Evenly add in the dried sweet cranberries & broken pieces of chocolate ( saving a small handful to garnish with). Place on middle rack of oven and cook for 15 minutes then add uniformly remaining cranberry ,chocolate pieces, & butter and put back into the oven for another 15 min or so until custard and bread have united and is fully cooked, cranberries have plumped, chocolate and butter have melted . The perfect consistancy is when custard is cooked but still soft and fuses with the bread so once cooled and cut holds a perfect shape.

      "To cook the fudge mixture, use a medium pan, such as a 2-quart saute pan. It's easier to evenly cook the ingredients in that kind of shallow pan. Pour in the sweetened condensed milk. Add the tofu and cashew mixture. Over medium heat, stir the ingredients together. Cook the mixture for about 15 minutes, stirring occasionally at the beginning as things heat up, and then frequently, and, eventually, constantly. Prevent scorching by scraping the bottom and sides as you stir. The mixture should not boil, but just thicken at a moderate speed. The mixture will transform into a rough mass resembling very thick, rough oatmeal. When stirring results in the mixture pulling away from the sides or slightly lifting off the bottom of the pan, it's done.",

Sprinkle on the pistachio nuts and gently press into the mixture. Set aside to completely cool. Because this fudge is on the soft side, cover and chill for a few hours or overnight to make it easier to cut; if you're in a hurry, freeze until cold, about 15 minutes. The resting time also develops flavor.",
      "Use the parchment paper on the side of the pan to help you remove the fudge. Place it on a cutting board and cut it into 36 small squares for bite-size portions. Or, aim for 16 to 20 large ones. Take liberties with shapes; triangles are easy to achieve, and diamonds are lovely and traditional. Serve at room temperature or chilled. This fudge keeps well, covered, for up to 5 days in the refrigerator. You can freeze it for up to 1 month, but it loses a touch of its oomph."

Use a pastry scraper to help roll the dough around the rolling pin and then unroll into ring mould. Press the pastry into the mould, ensuring that the pastry fits into the bottom right corner of the tin so that when it cooks it doesn't slide downwards. Use your fingers to push the dough down into the ring and use a thumb to gently press it against the side ensuring that the dough is an even thickness. Use the rolling pin to roll across the top of the tin to remove excess pastry that extends beyond the top of the tart tin. Use a knife to cut any excess dough from the top of the tart using small cutting motions no larger than 3 cm at a time. Place the tin in the refrigerator for 10 minutes as this will help it to keep its shape when you bake it. Prick the bottom of the tart all around to ensure it doesn't balloon while baking.

    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "Use a little of the butter to grease a large baking dish. Cut the bread into slices one inch thick. Cut the slices in half diagonally. Arrange the bread in the baking dish in two or three rows, overlapping the slices of bread as necessary to make them fit. Set aside.",
      "Place 1/2 cup of the brown sugar in a large bowl. Slice the vanilla bean in half lengthwise. Using a paring knife, scrape the seeds from the vanilla bean into the sugar. Use your fingers to rub the vanilla seeds into the sugar to distribute them evenly. Add the eggs, milk, ginger and 1/2 teaspoon of the salt. Whisk well to combine.",
      "Pour the custard evenly over the bread in the baking dish. Depending on the size of your dish, you may need to gently push the slices down into the custard with a spoon or flexible spatula so the bread can soak up as much custard as possible.",
      "Cover with plastic wrap and chill for at least 6 hours and up to 24 hours to allow the custard to soak into the bread. If you notice that there is custard pooling in the bottom of the baking dish, spoon some of the custard over the bread once or twice while it's chilling. You can also place another roasting pan or pie dish on top of the soaking bread to gently push it down into the custard if your bread is on the sturdy side. The extent to which the custard is absorbed will depend on the type of bread you use and how dry it is.",
      "When you are ready to cook the French toast, preheat the oven to 400\u00b0F. Remove the baking dish from the refrigerator. If there is still a bit of custard pooling at the bottom of the baking dish, tip out the excess. Set aside.",
      "If you are using pre-roasted and skinned hazelnuts, roughly chop them and set aside. If you have raw hazelnuts, place them on a rimmed sheet pan and toast until fragrant, about 7 minutes. Remove the nuts from the pan so they don't burn. Place them in the middle of a kitchen towel. Bring the four corners of the towel towards each other and twist them together until you have securely enclosed the nuts in the towel. Vigorously rub the hazelnuts together inside the towel for a minute or so. When you open the towel most of the skins should have fallen off. Roughly chop the toasted and skinned nuts and set aside.",
      "Peel and core the pears then slice them 1/8-inch thick. Heat 4 tablespoons of the butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. When the butter has melted, add the remaining 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Add the pears and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender and the caramel starts to thicken, about 5 minutes. If your pears are quite ripe, it will take a little longer for the moisture to cook off and the caramel to thicken. Remove the pears from the heat and add the chopped hazelnuts. Stir to coat the nuts in caramel.",
      "Spoon the pears and nuts over the prepared bread, tucking some of the caramelized pear in between the slices. Cut the remaining tablespoon of butter into small pieces and dot the top of the French toast with it. Place in the oven and bake for 30-35 minutes, until the custard has set and the French toast is golden brown.",
      "While the French toast is baking, make the syrup: Place the blackberries and syrup in a small saucepan and cook over medium heat until the berries are soft and starting to fall apart, about 5 minutes. Strain the syrup through a fine-mesh sieve into a small bowl, pushing on the berries with a spoon or spatula to extract as much berry pulp as possible. Stir the salt and cardamom into the warm syrup.",
      "Rest the French toast for 5-10 minutes before serving with warm Blackberry-Cardamom Syrup."

Cover bowl tightly with plastic wrap, lay a dish towel over it and place in a warm spot, like in the microwave. Sometimes, before putting the dough in, I heat a mug-full of water, to get the microwave nice and warm.",
      "Let rise for 1 hour. Punch dough down, and let rise for another hour.",
      "This step is totally optional, but worth it if you have all day. Punch dough down again and let rise for 2 - 3 more hours. Alternatively, you can stash the dough in the fridge overnight after the first rise. Bring refrigerated dough to room temperature about an hour before forming pizzas.",
      "Heat olive oil in a medium saucepan over medium/low heat. Add garlic clove and saute for a few minutes until very fragrant. Do not brown the garlic!",

      "Alternatively, use a good-quality store-bought pizza sauce.",
      "In a saute pan, heat 1/2 tablespoon unsalted butter and 1 teaspoon olive oil. Add chopped ramp bulbs and cook to just softened. Sprinkle with salt and remove to a bowl. Add another 1/2 tablespoon of butter and teaspoon of oil and saute the ramp leaves until just softened. Sprinkle with salt and place alongside the ramp bottoms. Alternatively, omit the ramp tops and just use the 1/2 cup of raw chopped ramp bulbs (or thin-sliced red onion), without sauteing.",

Dust dough lightly with flour and press down with your fingertips as you turn the pie and spread the dough evenly in all directions until you have a nice thin layer, about 1/4\" thick. It probably won't cover the entire pan; that's okay. If dough is not cooperating, it helps to let the dough rest for a few minutes.",

Or, if you've got a pizza peel and aren't afraid to use it, flour the peel lightly and pull the parchment and pizza onto the peel, then slide parchment and pizza directly onto pizza stone. Switch from BROIL to BAKE, 550 degrees F, and bake for 5 to 8 minutes, or until crust is nicely browned and crisp, and bottom of pizza has some nicely browned spots as well. Use a long-handled metal spatula, or the pizza peel, to lift up the pizza and take a peek underneath. Cheese should be bubbly, and the bottom crust should have some brown patches.",

If it's too thin to be able to form the dumplings with your hands, slowly add flour a half-cupful at a time until it's thick enough to do so (should take no more than a scant two cups); taste your dough for salt after adding extra flour and adjust accordingly. If you prefer not to shape the gnocchi with your hands, you can also spoon the batter into a gallon zip-top bag, snip off the bag's corner, and pipe batter directly into the water, using a sharp knife to slice off bite-sized pieces of dough as it comes out of the bag.] Be careful not to overcrowd the dumplings - only do 6-8 at a time to make sure they have space.

Use a wide spatula to flip crespelle over, and cook second side just until done, about 30 seconds. Remove to a large plate.",

Then taste and adjust for salt level.",
      "Remove ricotta from the fridge, and drain whey. Transfer warm pea mixture to that medium bowl, and add strained ricotta. Stir to incorporate -- again, you'll end up mashing some of the peas, and that's ok. Taste the mixture, and adjust seasoning as needed, maybe adding more salt, maybe a bit more pepper or nutmeg.",
      "When you're ready to bake assemble the dish, preheat the oven to 450. Butter a 9x13 inch baking dish generously. Put one of the crespelle on a large plate, and pile about 3 tablespoons of the mixture in a little log in the center. Fold the two edges of the crespelle over the filling, letter-style, and put the folded crespelle in the baking dish. Continue assembling in this manner, layering the folded crespelle slightly on top of each other in the dish. I layer the crespelle in two long rows of 8 or 9 each, overlapping as necessary. When all crespelle have been assembled and layered into the dish, pour the grated parmigiano cheese over top and dot with the remaining 4 tablespoons of butter. Bake about 12 minutes; cheese will have melted and crespelle will be warm all the way through. I prefer to serve this dish warm, but it can also be served at room temperature."

Close microwave (and unplug to prevent any accident). It took me about 4 hours for the dough to rise (that day it was about 30 degrees - January 2015). Punch down. At this point original recipe says to shape the dough into rolls (instructions in next paragraph). You can proceed to do that if you want. But what I myself like to do is to do a second rise in same bowl after dough has been punched down, in the refrigerator overnight. The following day when you are ready to bake, take bowl out and let the dough continue to rise until it has doubled. You can use the same microwave technique. After it has doubled, punch down.",

It took me a couple of hours. Bake at 375 degrees F for 16-18 minutes or until golden brown. Once out, brush rolls with melted (preferably salted) butter (1 tbsp melted butter should be enough). You can eat right away but I prefer to wait about 30 minutes. The rolls will stay soft even the day after. Store in same baking pan covered with plastic wrap.",

(To use less aluminium foil, you can also put them in a shallow baking dish and cover tightly with foil.)",

This is a trick I picked up from an Edward Behr book from the early 90s. The ratio is about 8:1. You don't taste the allspice; it just gives the pepper a wonderful brightness.

Dump the ball onto a heavily floured work surface, sprinkle the top with more flour, and use a rolling pin to roll out a rectangle that's roughly 10 x 15 inches (25 x 38cm), with the longer side closest to you, adding as much flour as you need along the way to keep it from sticking. (If your kitchen is very warm or, at any point, the butter gets melty and sticky, gather the dough onto a baking sheet and pop it into the fridge till it firms up a little, 15 minutes or so.)",
      "Slide an offset spatula under the dough to loosen it from the counter, then fold each 10-inch (25cm) side toward the middle so the edges meet, then close the packet like a book. Fold the book in half, top to bottom, then slice the dough in half horizontally, so you have two roughly equal-sized rectangles of dough. (If it's warmer than 72\u00b0F (22\u00b0C) in your kitchen, you might want to refrigerate the dough for 15 to 20 minutes before proceeding.)",
      "Wrap one portion of dough in plastic wrap and chill it while you get to work on the other one, or freeze for later it if you don't plan on using it right away. Roll the remaining portion out 1/8-inch (3mm) thick, into a 14-inch (36cm) round. Feel for sticky patches on top and underneath as you go, smoothing flour over them if needed. Brush off any excess flour, then drape the dough over your 9-inch (23cm) pie pan and lift the edges of the dough to drape the sides down into the corners without stretching the dough. Trim the excess to a 1 1/4-inch (3cm) overhang all around, then fold it under and press to seal it well, creating a 3/4-inch (2cm) border. If making a single-crust pie, crimp with your fingers or a fork into whatever decorative edge you like. Wrap in plastic and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or overnight. Alternatively, the crust can be frozen for up to 3 months and thawed overnight in the fridge before baking.",
      "To make a double-crust pie: Roll the remaining dough into a round as before to make your top crust, or, for a lattice-top pie, roll into an 1/8-inch (3mm) thick rectangle that's approximately 9 x 5 inches (23cm x 38cm). Transfer the entire sheet, uncut, to a baking sheet. Wrap both the bottom crust and top crust well in plastic and refrigerate at least 2 hours and up to overnight. Use as directed in your favorite recipe.",
      "To blind-bake for a single-crust pie (and have one portion of dough left over): Heat the oven to 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C) with a rack positioned in the lower-middle. Line the chilled crust with a 16-inch (40cm) square of foil (not parchment or wax paper), pressing it against the dough and letting the excess hang over the sides. Fill the crust to the brim with sugar, a no-waste alternative to traditional options like rice or dried beans (once cool, the roasted sugar can be stored and used in any recipe in place of granulated sugar).",
      "Set the pie pan on a rimmed baking sheet and bake until the crust is cooked through and lightly browned, about 1 hour (using a glass pan makes it easy to check the underside to make sure it's nicely browned). Remove the crust from oven and carefully lift out the foil with both hands and set aside on a plate until the sugar has fully cooled. Cool the crust to room temperature and use within 12 hours. Once cool, store the roasted sugar airtight at room temperature. To use the other half of the dough if frozen, thaw in the fridge overnight first."

To make vegetarian, use a strong mushroom broth rather than the beef broth. I wouldn't use water or a light broth, you need something robust. For a super quick stew, you can also substitute the giant lima beans for the baby ones, in which case, add the black eyed peas and giant limas at the same time and cook under pressure for 10 minutes then release naturally. If you are not a chile head and don't like spicy food, you can substitute smoked paprika for the chipotles. I would add to taste, starting with a teaspoon and also add in a tablespoon or so of tomato paste."

      "Preheat oven to 425. Settle racks in the top and bottom thirds of the oven.",
      "On two baking sheets, spread out a layer of parchment and then pour 2 tablespoons of olive oil (3 if you like things extra juicy) on each sheet. Chop the garlic, without attention to nicety, and sprinkle three cloves worth on each sheet and smear the oil and garlic over the entire base of the pans.",
      "After thickly slicing the tomatoes, about 1 inch thick, dredge each slice in the garlic oil mixture once and then flip over so that both sides are coated. Fill both baking sheets with tomato slices and give both pans a lusty casting of kosher salt.\r\n\r\nNote: the end piece of the tomatoes with all of the skin on them are fine here. Roast them skin side up and when they are done you can just skim off the tough skin, like unfashionable hats, and discard them so that your pie will be more silky. I don't bother with the skin on the sliced pieces.",
      "Slide each pan onto a rack and roast for 20 minutes. Then switch the pans from top to bottom as though you were baking cookies and roast a final 20 minutes (40 minutes total). The tomatoes should get very soft and wrinkly and the juices may get kind of dark on the parchment. You don't want them to be desiccated, though.",
      "Set aside pans of tomatoes on cooling racks. Lower oven to 375.",
      "Roll out pie crust and fit into a 9-inch pie plate. (If you want to do a deep dish version of this pie then you will need to add a few more tomatoes.) Cover with parchment and weight with whatever and bake 10 minutes. The crust will dry and start to color a bit. Remove and set near the tomatoes. I fill hot crusts all the time so it won't matter if you start right away or wait for a bit.",
      "Heap the tomatoes into the crust making sure the garlic comes along. There should be a good inch or so between the top of the tomatoes and the top of the crust.",
      "Prepare the topping. Whisk together the eggs, ricotta and milk with 1/2 teaspoon of salt. Add the finely sliced basil and stir to incorporate. Crumble in the goat cheese and Parmesan and mix well. Pour over the top of the tomatoes. Depending on how full your crust ended up, you may have extra. Alas! Don't flood the crusts on the edges.",

Grease your hands thoroughly with butter and pull the taffy: Stretch it into a long rope about 1 inch in diameter and fold the rope in half, onto itself like you're closing a book. Twist it completely together, then pull into a long rope again, and repeat. Continue this process until the taffy is firm and hard to pull, about 4 to 5 pulls. Stretch it into a long rope about 1-inch-thick and, using buttered kitchen shears, cut it into bite-size, 1-inch pieces.",
      "Wrap each piece of taffy in wax paper. You can either buy a candy wrapper or go the D.I.Y. route and cut squares out of wax paper.

      "Knead for about ten or twelve minutes, adding only as much flour as you need to keep the dough from sticking hard to your hands. You don't need to add the entire amount stated in the ingredients list. Remember, this dough has oatmeal in it, which will continue to soak up the liquids in the bread during the rise. (I put a small pile of flour - no more than a few tablespoons - off to the side, and use my bench scraper to pull over a teaspoon or two at a time, as needed.)",
      "Let the dough rest for a few minutes while you prepare the bowl and your rising area, if necessary. (See note below about the latter.)",
      "Wash in hot water the same bowl that you used for mixing the dough. Dry it and drizzle in the bottom a teaspoon or two of good, fruity olive oil. You can also use butter to coat the bowl, if you prefer.",
      "If proofing in your microwave or in your oven, prepare as suggested in Step 17.",
      "Gently form the dough into a ball, put into the bowl topside down, and then flip it over to coat with the oil.",

      "Punch down gently, knead a few times, and set aside on the parchment you used to cover the bowl.",
      "Allow to rise a second time about 45 minutes or until nearly doubled in size. (If you want to use this bread for sandwiches, you may find it beneficial not to let it rise quite as much. A loaf that's a bit more dense is easier to slice, and holds up better when constructing sandwiches.) See notes below about shaping, and about using a clay pot for loaf bread.",
      "Brush with olive oil, slash the dough a few times with a sharp knife, and bake at 350 Fahrenheit (for regular ovens) for about 55 minutes, or until the loaf sounds hollow when the bottom is gently tapped.",
      "Allow to cool on a rack for about an hour before slicing.",
      "Enjoy!!",
      "A Note about Rising: If your house is drafty and/or cold (like mine, most of the year) and you don't have all day or overnight to allow your dough to rise, put a small cup of water in your microwave, and turn it on high for two minutes. It should feel ever so slightly warm. (You don't want it too hot, because a quick rise can make the bread coarse.) Remove the cup and put your covered bowl of dough, or your shaped loaf on the parchment in the case of the second rise, in there and shut the door. Instruct all members of your household, in no uncertain terms, that if they need to use the microwave, they may do so only if they remove the dough, gently, and replace it, with the door shut, when done. Or, you can warm up your regular oven to no more than 100 degrees (turning it off immediately so it doesn't get any hotter), leave the door open for a minute or so, then put your dough in there.",
      "A Note about Clay Pots: This recipe works well either as a free-standing oval on a pizza stone, or in a loaf pan. If using a standard metal pan, lightly oil it before putting the dough into it for the second rise.\r\nIf you are using a clay pot, please remember that (i) it benefits from soaking in water before using; and (b) you can't put it, while cold, into a hot oven. So fill up the clay pot about 3/4 with water and put it into the oven; about twenty minutes before the time you expect to put the bread in the oven, turn it on (325 degrees Fahrenheit for a convection oven, or 350 for a regular oven). When the dough has completed its second rise, remove the hot pan from the oven, discard the hot water - I use it for cleaning the oily bowl- and then place the dough in the clay pot, using the parchment on which the dough rose. You can oil clay pots, but they don't absorb as much water during the soak. The absorbed water creates steam in the oven, which improves the crust.",
      "A Note about Browning: Check the loaf after about 25 minutes. Convection ovens tend to make the crust a bit dark - especially those with milk and butter in them -- so if the crust looks done after 25 or 30 minutes, cover it very lightly with a piece of foil.",
      "A Note about Kneading: This dough does not necessarily have to be kneaded by hand, if you have another method that you prefer, and are able to make adjustments accordingly. I happen to like stirring and kneading, because I rely on my hands to tell me when the correct amount of flour has been added. Plus, there's nothing quite like the satisfaction of using your own hands to turn a shaggy, floury mass of not-quite combined ingredients into the most glorious, smooth, shiny and supple ball of dough. I do some of my best thinking while kneading, too."

      "Finely dice your onion and add it to the large mixing bowl.",
      "Cranberries can either be added whole, or you can give them an extra run through with your knife or whirl in your food processor if you like smaller pieces. I make it both ways depending on how I'm feeling. Add the cranberries to the large mixing bowl.",

      "If you've decided to make an adorable egg salad bunny, get a medium sized round mixing bowl and a smaller bowl (I think I used a plain old cereal bowl for my small bowl). Fill both bowls with egg salad and then invert onto a plate to create the body (from the bigger bowl) and the head (from the smaller bowl). It should look a bit like an unadorned snowman on a platter.",

      "Wash your brussel sprout and place it on the back of the body as a tail.",
      "Use sprigs of cilantro and any leftover green onion to decorate the plate like Easter grass.",

Roll one rectangle of the dough out to a 1/4-inch thickness; it is prone to sticking, so be sure to rotate it every few rolls and keep the surface floured.

Use a small offset spatula to transfer the circles onto one of the prepared baking sheets-stagger the crackers, leaving about 1/2 inch between them. Reserve the dough scraps. Roll and cut the other rectangle of dough. Then gather the scraps together, roll the dough once more, and cut out more circles as needed to reach a total of 55. Prick the surface of each cracker a few times with a fork.",

Fit a disposable pastry bag with a #803 plain tip (you can just cut a 1/2-inch opening in the tip of the bag, but using the tip is a little easier and produces sexier curves). Lightly coat the inside of the bag and the tip as best you can with nonstick spray.",

Bring the mixture to a boil over medium-high heat; you can stir the mixture before it comes to a boil to help dissolve the sugar, but stop stirring the moment it starts to boil. Attach a candy thermometer to the side of the pan (or have an instant-read thermometer ready). Continue to boil until the sugar reaches 240 \u00b0F/115 \u00b0C on the thermometer.",

Working quickly and using a spiral motion, pipe a mound about 2 to 2 1/2 inches high onto each cookie, releasing the pressure and lifting up the bag to finish each with a point or even a little curlicue. It's important to work quickly so the gelatin doesn't firm up too much (it will begin to set as it cools). Let the marshmallow set at room temperature for 5 to 10 minutes.",

      "Make the fried coconut strips. Put the frozen coconut on a plate to thaw, then squeeze out any excess water and pat dry.",
      "Heat about 1/4 inch of oil in a wok or a small heavy skillet over medium heat. Add the thawed coconut and fry, stirring constantly to prevent burning, until golden brown in places. Lift out with a slotted spoon or tongs, allowing any excess oil to dry, then transfer to a paper towel-lined plate and set aside.",
      "Rinse the rice in cold water, drain, and place in a small pot with a tight fitting lid. Add ginger, peanuts, sugar, sesame seeds, salt, and water and stir to mix well.",
      "If using a pot, bring to a boil over high heat, then cover tightly, reduce heat to low, and cook for 30 minutes, until the rice is tender.",
      "Let the cooked rice stand, covered, for 10 minutes.",
      "Lightly oil an 8-inch square baking pan or 8-inch pie plate. Transfer the rice mixture to the pan, mixing and blending it gently to distribute the flavorings. Smooth the top gently, gently press in the fried coconut strips, and let stand for 30 minutes, until firm.",
      "Cut into squares or wedges and serve with a drizzle of condensed coconut milk. It keeps, covered, for 3 days. Do not refrigerate-it toughens the rice.",
      "Add the coconut milk and sugar to a small saucepan and heat over medium heat. Whisk constantly until the sugar dissolves and bring the mixture to a boil.",
      "Once boiling, reduce it to a gentle simmer and cook for 1 hour and 15 minutes until it thickens.",
      "Stir every 10 to 15 minutes so a film does not develop on top. You want the mixture to reduce by about half and be slightly thick, keeping in mind that it will thicken a lot more once it's in the fridge."

Put the kernels in enough water to just cover them, add a pinch of salt, and simmer them until they are very tender - 12 to 15 minutes.

      "Now to make the polenta - remove the cobs from the broth and slowly stream in the dried polenta, stirring all the while. Simmer until the polenta is thick and creamy. You may need to add a splash of water along the way. Now stir in the fresh corn polenta and the parmesan cheese. Taste for salt and pepper and adjust accordingly. Stir in the grilled kernels and the basil, and serve. FYI - excellent with grilled lamb chops. And wine."
