      "To Clean: Discard any wilted or yellowed leaves and pulpy stems. Tear into bite-size pieces. Washing is the most important part of preparing spinach. Fill both bowls of a double sink (or sink and a large pan) with lukewarm water. Wash spinach by plunging up and down in one sink; lift spinach out of the water and into the other container of water. Repeat procedure, rinsing sink or pan between washings until no trace of sand remains in final rinse water.",
      "Note: Spinach is not well washed unless lifted out of the water. Simply pulling the plug on the sink or pouring the water from the pan without first removing the spinach will not rinse away the sand.",
      "To Steam: Place spinach in a steaming rack; cover and steam over boiling water 10 minutes. Place spinach in a warm serving dish. Combine butter, lemon juice, and salt; pour over spinach.",
      "Other Cooking Methods: Boil; saute.",
      "Serving Suggestions: Spinach may be used raw in salads or cooked and served with any of the following: Basil Vinegar, Chive Blossom Vinegar, Chive Vinegar, Oil and Lemon Sauce, or Sweet-and-Sour Dressing."

Pour mixture evenly into small cups, tinting each with a few drops of liquid food coloring to create different colors. (We painted our leaves using four different colors of egg wash--red, yellow, orange, and green. For easy cleanup and to prevent the excess egg wash from burning on the baking sheet, paint leaves on pieces of parchment or wax paper.) Brush leaves evenly with egg wash, beginning with lighter colors first, and overlaying with areas of darker color. Use a small artist's brush to add accents of bolder color with undiluted liquid food coloring. Crumple 2 (14-inch long) pieces of aluminum foil into 1-inch-wide strips. Coat with vegetable cooking spray, and place on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Gently drape pastry leaves over the strips of aluminum foil to give them a natural-looking shape; place several leaves on the baking sheet. Bake at 400\u00b0 for 6 to 8 minutes or until golden.

Use an instant-read thermometer to double-check the temperature on the other side of breast, and measure temperature into the thigh joint (where thigh meets body) as well; here, it should be 170\u00b0.",

      "*Use wood chips or chunks to give your turkey a gently smoky flavor. Aidell's favorite woods for turkey are fruit woods like apple, cherry, or peach; find these at home-supply stores."

But in particular, both the acidity and the fruitiness of riesling make it a star pick when flavors go several directions--sweet (figs), spicy (cardamom), herbal (fennel), and exotic (ginger) all at the same time. Try the Hugel et Fils Riesling 2003 from Alsace ($20). -Karen MacNeil"
