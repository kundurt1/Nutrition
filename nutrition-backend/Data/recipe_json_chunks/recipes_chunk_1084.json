      "Pasta -- Bring a large pot of salted water up to a boil and cook the ravioli according to the package directions. Ravioli doesn't take too long, so make sure you have all your other ingredients ready.",
      "Walnuts -- In a large dry saute pan (we are using a large pan because we will make the sauce in this same pan, and then add the ravioli once cooked also to the pan, so we need something fairly large), heat to medium and add in the walnuts. Cook 2-3 minutes just until you start to smell the nuts and they start to get golden brown. Keep an eye on them, they go quickly. You just want to lightly toast them. Once they are done, just put on a small plate off to the side while you make the sauce.",
      "Sauce -- In that same pan, add 1/2 the olive oil and bring up to medium heat and add the pancetta and cook 2-3 minutes (it won't take long as it is thin sliced). Then add in the garlic and a pinch of salt and cook another minute. Toss in the cranberries, dates and cook until heated through.",
      "Finishing -- Drain the ravioli well and add right to the pan with the pancetta and fruit. Add a bit more oil if the pan is dry, and cook just until the ravioli is well coated with the sauce. Toss in the walnuts, goat cheese, chives and pepper. Salt is optional (go easy because the pancetta and the goat cheese are both salty).",
      "Serve -- Plate on a large family style platter and drizzle with the extra olive oil. Serve with a arugula salad and a honey balsamic vinaigrette and maybe a crunchy toasted baguette. ENJOY!"

      "For the crust: Preheat oven to 350. Tightly wrap the outside of a 9-inch springform pan with 2 3/4 inch sides with 3 layers of heavy-duty aluminum foil. Finely grind the toasted slivered almonds, graham cracker crumbs and sugar in a food processor. Slowly add melted butter. Press the mixture into the bottom (not up the sides) of the springform pan (using the back of a 1/4 cup metal measuring cup helps for an even crust). Bake 12 minutes, cool completely. Turn oven down to 325.",
      "For the filling: using an electric mixer (or stand mixer) beat the cream cheese, mascarpone and sugar until light and fluffy, being sure to scrape down the sides of the bowl. Beat in lemon juice, lemon oil, limoncello and vanilla. Taste test. Add more lemon oil/limoncello if desired. Be careful with the lemon oil -- too much and it's bitter.",
      "Here's where you can change up the flavor -- for orange cheesecake -- add 1 tablespoon orange juice concentrate, 1/4 teaspoons orange oil (optional) and 1 tablespoon Grand Marnier in place of all lemon ingredients. Again, taste test before adding eggs and adjust to suit your taste.",
      "Next, add eggs one at a time (must be room temperature), beating just until incorporated, you don't want to whip in the eggs. Pour cheesecake over crust and place in a roasting pan. Fill the pan with HOT water (like from a kettle simmering on the stove) halfway up the sides of the cheesecake pan. Bake for 1 hour and 5 minutes, until golden brown on top. Cheesecake will appear very wobbly. It will set when cool.",
      "Carefully take out of oven and cool on a rack for one hour. Cool completely in pan in refrigerator for at least 8 hours. Run a small knife around the edge of the cheesecake and release from pan.",
      "Here's where you can freeze it. After cooling completely in refrigerator, tightly wrap top of springform pan with aluminum foil. Transfer to freezer and freeze until solid. When solid, remove from freezer and run a small knife around the edge of the cheesecake and release from springform pan. Score cake into 8 perfect wedges and using your sharpest knife (dipping it in hot water will help this process), cut cheesecake into clean, sharp wedges. Wrap edge wedge in plastic wrap, thoroughly. Put slices in freezer bag and return to the freezer. To defrost, remove desired pieces from freezer, unwrap and place on a plate. Cover with plastic wrap and put in refrigerator until thawed (usually about 30 minutes). Can be left out at room temperature to speed along the process after 30 minutes in the refrigerator. Enjoy!"

Turn the bag a few times during that period. You can marinate the day of, or give it a couple days. 24 hours seems to work quite well.",
      "Heat your grill until it is as hot as possible. I have a Weber gas grill, and it takes a good 20 minutes to get that thing smoking hot. My Weber has a thermometer and I'm guessing the grill hits 700 degrees. Get the meat and toss it on the grill. I use a timer -- 3 minutes to sear side one, flip, sear side two for another 3 minutes. If your roast is over 2\" thick, go 4 minutes per side. You really do want to sear the meat -- black and smoke is not your enemy -- lots of flavor comes from that. After searing, shut the center burner off and set the others to medium (indirect cooking method for charcoal people). Grill temp should settle down to about 350. At this point I do stick a remote grilling thermometer in the roast/steak. I pull a roast or steak from the grill when it hits about 132 degrees for medium rare. So if the thermometer reads 82 after I sear it, there are 50 more degrees to go, or 25 per side. So I do flip it again when it hits 107 degrees. If you don't own a remote grilling thermometer, buy one.",
      "When it hits 132 degrees pull it off the grill, put it on a plate and put it in the microwave. I say put it in the microwave for 2 reasons -- 2 Labrador Retrievers who will steal a perfectly cooked piece of meat off the counter in the blink of an eye. At any rate, let the meat sit for 10-15 minutes, which gives you time to do the grilled asparagus, corn, garlic bread, etc.",
      "This recipe will never fail. Sometimes the cut of meat fails, but no matter what, it will have amazing flavor. For decades I have only used this with a chuck roast on the grill, but gave it a whirl with a thick cut ribeye. Wife said it was the best steak she ever had."

For food safety, the Pate must not be unrefrigerated for more than 2 hours in total time after cooking. This means if it is brought out of the fridge for use then returned, It is only safe for a total sum of two hours out of the fridge. If it's during hot weather or a very warm room {more than 90F}, then this time must be reduced to one hour. It is best to cut off a segment and place it on a serving dish returning the sealed unused portion immediately to the refrigerator to eliminated the doubt. The pate will keep in the fridge for five days. It may be stored frozen for 1 month. Make sure that the pate is covered if returned to the fridge after the butter seal has been cut.",
      "ONE MORE NOTE: After cooking, liver tends to turn a pasty gray and ashen color which is quite unappealing. Add a few drops of red food coloring for aesthetics, if desired."

      "When oil reaches 385 degrees, pour liquid mixture into bowl with flour mixture and whisk gently until just combined (it is OK if small lumps remain). Submerge half of shrimp in batter. Using tongs, remove shrimp from batter 1 at a time, allowing excess batter to drip off, and carefully place in oil (temperature should now be at 400 degrees). Fry, stirring with chopstick or wooden skewer to prevent sticking, until light brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer shrimp to paper towel-lined plate and sprinkle with salt. Once paper towels absorb excess oil, place shrimp on wire rack set in rimmed baking sheet and place in oven.",
      "Return oil to 400 degrees, about 4 minutes, and repeat with remaining shrimp. Serve immediately with Dipping Sauce.",
      "NOTE: Do not omit the vodka; it is critical for a crisp coating. For safety, use a Dutch oven with a capacity of at least 7 quarts. Be sure to begin mixing the batter when the oil reaches 385 degrees (the final temperature should reach 400 degrees). It is important to maintain a high oil temperature throughout cooking. If you are unable to find colossal shrimp (8-12 per pound), jumbo (16-20) or extra-large (21-25) may be substituted. Fry smaller shrimp in three batches, reducing the cooking time to 11/2 to 2 minutes per batch. See Straighten Out Your Shrimp below for tips on preventing the shrimp from curling.",

You can always finish with fresh herbs. Cook to 145F minimum temperature. Note, you can remove the meat at 5 degrees early as the temperature will rise during the rest. https://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsis/topics/food-safety-education/get-answers/food-safety-fact-sheets/meat-preparation/focus-on-lambfrom-farm-to-table/CT_Index.",

      "1. Prepare grill for indirect grilling with a large dripping pan under where the roast will be. Aim for a grill temperature around 375*F. Periodically add water to the pan to keep the drippings from burning away if you want to make gravy. Make sure you know the weight of your prime rib. Plan on grilling indirectly for 12 to 14 minutes per pound. If you are using a smaller roast, adjust the ingredients and cooking times accordingly.",
      "2. With a sharp paring knife make a series of 1/2 inch deep holes every 2 inches all over the roast. Insert the garlic slivers in every other hole and a leaf from the rosemary in the rest. Combine black pepper, dried rosemary, salt and paprika and rub over the surface of the meat. When the grill is ready, place the roast on the well oiled grate directly over the dripping pan. Cook for about 12 to 14 minutes per pound. An 18 pound roast will take about 3 1/2 to 4 hours. It is very important to use an accurate meat thermometer to check for doneness. You do not want to over cook this roast.",
      "3. When the meat reaches an internal temperature of 115 to 125*F. remove it from the grill. Place it on a platter and cover loosely with foil. The meat will continue cooking and the internal temperature will continue to rise. Let rest for at least 15 minutes, but no more than 30. If you want the roast rare to medium rare, remove from the grill when the temperature is 115*F. and let it rest for 15 minutes. If you want it more well done, remove from the grill at 125*F. and let it rest for 30 minutes.",
      "My Note: I made a 7 rib, 12.21 lb prime rib with this receipe for Easter and to day that it was wonderful is a understatement. I did not use the dried rosemary on the rub since I but extra garlic and fresh rosemary in the slits and I am glad that I used the fresh instead. everyone raved aboutit and this 24 people. I could not make copies fast enough for all the people who wanted the recipe. The best thing is once it was on the grill, I didn't need to think about it at all. UPDATE: I used fresh rosemary and garlic as suggested. Only change - I used cayenne ILO of paprika in my rub. Cooked faster than recipe said, but turned out medium to medium rare with internal temp of 140 when I pulled it off the grill. I used a Brinkman four flame gas grill and tried to keep the temp at 325*F. My roast was 14.5 pounds and total cooking time was just under 3 hours. Everyone love it - so that is my measure."
