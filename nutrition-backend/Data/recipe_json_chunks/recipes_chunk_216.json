Mix the garlic, bread crumbs and walnuts into the cheese mix, stirring just enough to blend them together. DO NOT OVERMIX. Take each spinach leaf in turn and lay it out flat on a board. With a tablespoon, place a spoonful of the cheese mix on to the spinach leaves. Fold the sides of the spinach leaf in toward the center first, then roll up the spinach leaf into a roll, keeping it reasonably taut. Place the 6 rolls of spinach and cheese into a shallow dish that has been greased with butter or oil; add about 1/2 cup of vegetable stock or enough to just cover the bottom of the dish. Cover with a tight fitting lid and shallow poach for a few minutes over a medium-high heat on the range until the stock is absorbed. Yield: 4 portions."
