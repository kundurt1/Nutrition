    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "Masa harina: This is cornmeal that has been prepared with lime or wood-ash lye water. It's different from ordinary cornmeal, cooks up softer, absorbs lots of fat during its cooking, holds together better in tortillas, etc. It's available from Mexican food stores.",
      "To roast the fresh corn: just put them (in their husks) in a 400 degree oven for 5 minutes. Husks and silk will peel off easily. Then scrape off kernels, standing cob in a big frypan to catch them. Depending on the ears, it will take 2-4 ears to make 1 1/2 cups of kernels.",
      "Cornhusk tamale wrappers: The ones you just prepared are probably dried out and frizzeled. If you've saved and dried husks, steep them in boiling water to cover (poured over them, not cooked) while roasting and scraping the corn. Otherwise, you'll have to use foil wrappers.",
      "Simmer milk and corn for about 10 minutes. Strain the corn, reserve the milk, and puree 1/2 cup of the kernels with this milk, reserving the rest for putting in the tamale dough. Add the puree to the masa, mix vigorously with spoon and whisk. In a separate large bowl, whip the soft butter, baking powder, and salt together until very fluffy. Start adding the masa mixture about 1/4 cup (guesstimated) at a time whisking and beating vigorously after each dough addition. Spend 15 minuts at least beating the masa mix into the butter. Fold in the green chile, the remaining cup of corn kernels, and grated cheese.",
      "Divide the dough into 8 equal pieces, about 4 Tbsp each. Pat each piece into a rectangle on a trimmed cornhusk to form a square or rectangle, leaving a husk border at the edges of the tamale at least 1 inch. Now fold up the rectangle along the length of the cornhusks and pinch it into a roll, loosely. Roll the husk up completely around the dough roll. Tie the ends with strips of cornhusk (traditional), or string (easier). The wrapping shouldn't be totally tight, so steam can get inches Place the wrapped tamales seam-side down on the rack of any kind of steamer (wok with a rack and tight cover will do, I use big enameled cast-iron frypan with tight lid). Tamales shouldn't touch the boiling water. Steam for 30 minutes. Let cool slightly and serve (diners unwrap their own) with any kind of hot tomato or other type of sauce. Those celebrating New Corn eat it without sauce, but fat or butter is sometimes available."

Taste and add salt as needed. When seasoning is correct, add chicken and cover. Refrigerate overnight. If you're in a hurry (i.e. you're not doing this the night before), let the mixture marinate on the counter for at least 30 minutes before cooking.",
      "Also the day before you plan to cook these, make the sauce. Place yogurt in the center of a clean piece of cheesecloth (I use a kitchen towel--it works just as well). Bring up the sides and twist so that yogurt is all wrapped up in a nice little bundle. Secure towel and hang yogurt over your sink (I do this at night and just tie the towel around the arm of my faucet). Let yogurt drain overnight (12-24 hours). The longer it drains, the thicker your sauce will be. When yogurt has drained to your liking, scrape it off the towel/cheesecloth and into a small bowl. Add lemon juice, diced cuke, and garlic; mix well. Taste and adjust seasoning with salt if needed (some yogurt brands are saltier than others, so you may not need any salt at all). Let sit for at least 15 minutes before serving so flavors can blend. This gets better and better the longer it sits! (Again, if you're in a hurry and not doing this the night before, just stir everything together for the sauce--it'll be runnier, but you'll live!).",
      "When you're ready to make the gyros, preheat your grill (charcoal is best); meanwhile, prep your tomatoes and onion. Thread chicken onto soaked skewers, leaving a little space between each piece. Cook skewers for a couple minutes on each side, turning once, till done.",
      "When chicken is all cooked, throw your pitas on the grill to heat up (and get that smoky/grillly taste!), turning once. When your pitas are hot (and nice and flexible), take them of the grill. Working with one pita at a time, place pita on foil in your hand. Lay a skewer down the middle of the pita, and curl the pita around the meat with your hand while you pull out the skewer. Open the pita back up and top with tomato wedges and onion, dollop with the sauce, then wrap foil around the bottom half of the pita securely (so it won't leak and/or lose any of the filling!). Eat!",
      "These are great fresh, but I usually cook extra to have for other meals during the week--keep all the ingredients separate till you're ready to eat, then just reheat the chicken and pitas in the microwave before assembling. I also often take these as camping food--freeze the chicken in the marinade and let it marinate as it thaws (usually takes 2-3 hours)--cooks the same from that point (and no messy dishes to wash!)."

      "Start by heating your oven to 425 degrees. Once the oven is up to temperature, place both eggplants (whole) on a baking sheet. Roast for 30-40 minutes, or until VERY soft. The skin may actually look a little burned, but this is perfectly normal. Allow the eggplant to cool for about 30 minutes before handling. Once cool, remove the skin from the eggplant and discard. You will use the gooey insides as a base for your dip. Trust me, this will get a little bit slippery and messy, but it's all going to be good eats in the end. Place the eggplant into a food processor along with all of the other ingredients. Process until very smooth stopping every 10 seconds or so to scrape down the sides of the food processor. Season well with a good amount of salt and black pepper, and serve with chips. I chose to use little mini pretzel chips, and they tasted great. Baba Ganoush is traditionally served with pita chips, but hey no one says you have to be authentic every time. Enjoy!"

In a med. to large pot put the roast and green beans (any other veggies you want except potatoes -- add those later) in along with both cans of french onion soup, fill with water until it's about 3 inches above meat. Bring to a boil, boil for about 30 minutes then reduce heat to simmer, you want the liquid to evaperate but not too fast. Now cook for 3 to 4 hours or until meat is falling off of fork (if water gets too low just keep adding a cup or two at a time, you want the liquid to cook down and allow the soup to thicken but not until it has been cooking for about 3 to 4 hours).",
      "3. After the roast and green beans have been cooking for about 3 hours or so when meat is tender, then you can add your potatoes. Keep cooking until potatoes are done and the liquid in the pot has thickened and evaperated down to where you can see the meat and veggies.",

A small bit spooned onto a chilled (in the freezer) plate will be thick, not runny.

You can place them in a large pot (12 quart) of water on top of a steaming rack (so they don't touch the bottom of the pan), and bring the water to a boil for 10 minutes.
