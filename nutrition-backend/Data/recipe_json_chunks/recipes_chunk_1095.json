      "In a 6-quart cooking pot, add 4 quarts of the water and dissolve 1 teaspoon of the salt in it. Bring to a boil, uncovered, over high heat, and carefully add the unpeeled potatoes into the boiling water.",
      "Boil the potatoes until a steak knife will slide into one fairly easily (about 12 - 15 minutes) -- do not overcook! Remove from the heat, carefully pour off the hot water right away, then allow cold tap water to run over the potatoes in the pot for 3-4 minutes. Pour off the cool water and allow the potatoes to dry on paper towels. Set aside.",
      "Boil 8 of the eggs. (You might wish to boil a couple of extra ones in case some crack early in the process.) Here's how to perfectly boil the eggs: In a 6-quart cooking pot (not an aluminum one) add a gallon of hot tap water -- do NOT add any salt. Carefully place the eggs into the water right away. Bring the water to a boil over high heat. As soon as the water boils, lower the heat to medium (or lower), set your timer for 13 minutes and continue at a low boil, uncovered, until the timer goes off. (Carefully move the eggs about with a wooden spoon occassionally during this process so that the yolks will remain centered.) As soon as the 13 minutes have elapsed, pour off the hot water and allow cold tap water to run over the eggs in the cooking pot for at least 3 minutes prior to peeling them.",
      "If you have a stainless steel or porcelain sink, you can easily peel the eggs by giving each a light smack against the sink wall and then roll the egg along the sink wall for a few inches -- it should crunch the shell a little as you do so. Then carefully peel the eggs under cold running tap water. Allow the eggs to dry on paper towels and set aside.",
      "Peel the potatoes over your sink by holding a paring knife blade perpindicular to the potato skin as you scrape the skin off -- the skins can be easily removed by this method. (I sometimes run a little cold tap water over the potato as I'm doing this with the more troublesome ones.) Cut away any imperfections with the paring knife and set the peeled and dried (with paper towels if necessary) potatoes aside in the refrigerator for a few minutes. After they are cooled, dice the potatoes into roughly 1/2-inch squares, (or whatever size you prefer.) Set aside.",
      "Make the dressing: Beat two eggs in a medium mixing bowl. Add the sugar, cornstarch, vinegar, and milk. Hand whisk this for a few seconds and pour the blend into a 2-quart saucepan. Cook over medium heat until the dressing thickens (which it will do just as it begins a low boil) and then immediately add the soft or melted butter, mustard, and mayonaise. Remove from heat right away and whisk by hand until the dressing is well-blended. Allow the dressing to cool.",
      "Place the diced potatoes in a large mixing bowl. Dice four of the boiled eggs and add them to the potatoes. Add in the diced celery, diced onion, the remaining teaspoon of salt, and the dressing. Carefully mix the potato salad with a large wooden spoon.",
      "Transfer the potato salad to a large serving bowl. Slice the four remaining boiled eggs and garnish the top of the potato salad with the egg slices. Then sprinkle on the paprika. Cover the bowl with cling wrap and refrigerate for at least 4 hours prior to serving."

      "Add the onion and cook for 2 - 3 minutes. Add 5 crushed garlic cloves and cook for 2 minutes more. Add the tomatoes and chicken stock (refer to note # 1 below). Add drained beans and add to the pot.",
      "Let it come to a boil. Reduce heat to simmer and cook approximately 1 1/2 hours or until beans are tender and cooked through.",
      "Meanwhile cook pasta shells as instructed per package directions; set aside.",
      "Once the beans are tender, add the Essence Seasoning, more or less to taste (refer to note # 2 below) and correct seasoning with salt and pepper. Remove bacon from the pot.",
      "Also remove and reserve half of the cooked beans for garnish (or remove about 3/4 if you like more whole beans in your soup).",
      "Ladle the remaining beans and liquid into a blender or food processor, puree until smooth. Or if you own a hand-held-blender, puree the beans right in the pot, (If too thick, add more hot chicken stock until you reach the consistency of your choice). Check for seasoning.",
      "Mix in the reserved cooked pasta shells.",
      "In a small saute pan, heat the remaining 1/3 c olive oil over medium-low heat. Add the remaining 6 crushed cloves or garlic and cook for 2 minutes, being careful not to burn (if it browns, the garlic will impart a bitter taste).",
      "Add the oregano and rosemary and saute for 1 - 2 minutes. Let stand (You can make this oil 1 - 2 days ahead of time).",
      "Strain and reserved the flavored oil. Ladle the soup into serving bowls. Sprinkle in some of the reserved beans. Drizzle with a spoonful of the oregano-rosemary oil and serve. If you desire, serve with grated parmesan and crusty bread.",
      "NOTE # 1: When cooking beans, never add salt before they are cooked through. It will toughen the beans. Always add the salt only when beans are tender. Keeping this in mind, if you use chicken bouillon or a stock that already contains salt, make sure you add bouillon cubes after beans are tender because bouillon contains salt. Substitute the chicken stock for water at the beginning of the recipe if bouillion is what you are using.",
      "Essence: Combine all ingredients thoroughly. Yield: 2/3 cup.",
      "NOTE # 2: Only use enough Essence to flavor soup as noted. Please DO NOT use the full measure. Store the rest for future use. This seasoning is terrific on many other dishes."

Older eggs have a different pH from new eggs, which researchers say affects peeling. We also find that cooling eggs immediately after cooking in an ice bath makes them easier to peel.",
      "But really, what good is an easy-to-peel egg if it is going to have that ugly green center? The green is made by the iron in the yolk combining with the sulfur in the white. Heat is a big foe of this chemical reaction. The longer you cook eggs, the more likely you are to end up with that green ring. The trick is to cook eggs just until the yolk is set without overcooking them. Removing the eggs from the hot water to an ice bath immediately after cooking will also help prevent the green from forming.",
      "The best way to make easy-to-peel hard-boiled eggs with pure yellow centers is to place the eggs in a pot of cold water and add a teaspoon of salt. Place the pot on the stove and bring to a boil. Cover the pot and remove from heat and let sit for 13 minutes. Drain the eggs and immediately place in an ice bath until completely cooled. Drain and enjoy your perfectly cooked hard-boiled eggs.",

      "After 10 minutes, remove the pan, drain the water, and rinse in cold water until the heat is gone from the eggs. This will take a couple of times. Then put them in cool water for about half an hour. Yeah, you can ice them, but it's a pain and the results are the same.",
      "After you've cooled the eggs, drain and dry the eggs. Soft kitchen towel works best.",
      "To peel the eggs, start by gently cracking the large end of the egg. That is where there will be a small air pocket and makes it easier to get you started. But before you do that -- gently roll the egg along a surface to get it cracked all over. Now you can remove the shell and eat your egg.",
      "I do appreciate the advice for making eggs easier to peel, but for Easter weekend that's not going to work if you plan to color your eggs. They have to be left uncracked!",

      "4. place eggs in ice water after the 12 min for 2 minutes and keep water in pan boiling or bring back to a boil.",
      "5. Gently drop eggs back in boiling water for 30 seconds to 1 minute.",
      "6. they are ready to peel I put them back in the ice cold water agian just to cool off for a minute.",
      "7. So easy and I do it every time now!",
      "8. The best way to ensure your eggs are easy to peel is to always use older eggs - not bad, of course, just not fresh. There is a membrane between the shell and the albumin, and as the egg ages, an air pocket develops between this membrane and the shell. So when you boil your eggs and go to peel them, the membrane around the white is no longer so strongly attached to the shell and it peels more easily. I always leave fresher eggs to be boiled out at room temp for a day or so before boiling them, which hastens the aging process."

Then, prepare the chicken.Bring enough water to boil in a large pot.Once boil, add in the salt, ginger,garlic and chicken. Lower the heat and cook chicken for about 20 - 25 minutes, uncovered. It is very important to boil the chicken very slowly over low flame.Turn of flame and cover the pot. Allow the chicken to steep inside for another 20-25 minutes. Remove chicken and immerse it into a basin of cold water for 5-6 minutes.Take chicken out and drain in a colander to drip dry before cutting it into serving pieces.",
      "While the chicken is drip drying, prepare the rice.Heat up wok and add in the chicken fat and water.Bring to a low simmering boil until oil is released from the fat. Add in the ginger and garlic and fry well (without burning the garlic) Remove and discard the chicken fat and skin. Add in the rice that has been dried and salt and stir fry briskly about 1 - 2 minutes.Transfer rice into an electric rice cooker or pot. Add in the chicken broth from the boiled chicken together with the screwpine leaves if using.If cooking in a pot, cook over low flame stirring occasionally so as not to let the bottom of the rice burn.Boil until rice is cook.",
      "While the rice is cooking, you can prepare the chilli garlic sauce. Just add all ingredients into a blender or food processor, and give it a good whizz, until ingredients are well blended. Adjust the seasoning with more salt or sugar to taste.The chili garlic sauce can be kept in the refrigerator for about 2-3 days only.",
      "To prepare the ginger sauce is the same.give the ingredients a good whiz in the blender.What gives the extra oomph for the sauces is the stock from the chicken broth -- so, do not omit this ingredient.",
      "Lastly combine all the ingredients for the chicken sauce and pour it all over the cut up chicken. You can add more soya sauce and chicken broth to the chicken if you prefer. Just adjust the taste of the sauce with soya sauce and chicken broth.If you do not have garlic oil,you can fry a few cloves of garlic in oil for few minutes then take out oil and garlic pour it into a jar, and let the garlic steep inside the oil.",
      "Finally, garnish the chicken with the coriander leaves, spring onions and cucumbers.",

      "Make the pastry dough in the food processor a day or two in advance-or at least 4 hours-for the best texture. Put the flour, sugar and salt in the bowl and process just to mix. Mix the olive oil, vinegar and the wine together and, with the machine running, pour all but 1 tablespoon in and process for 20 seconds or so until a dough gathers on the blade. If it feels hard and dry, sprinkle in the remaining liquid and process briefly. It should be moist and malleable-incorporate more wine if needed. Turn the dough out of the bowl, scraping any bits from the sides and blade, and knead by hand into a soft, smooth ball. Flatten to a disk, wrap very tightly in plastic, and refrigerate for up to 2 days.",
      "Put the fresh ricotta in a fine-meshed sieve and set inside a bowl to drain for at least 12 hours or a whole day in advance. Cover the ricotta with plastic wrap and refrigerate.",
      "To make the cannoli cream, whip the ricotta with the whisk attachment of an electric mixer until smooth. Whip in the 2/3 cup powdered sugar and the Grand Marnier. Chop the chocolate (or chips) into coarse bits-big enough to bite into and to be visible. Coarsely chop the candied peel and almonds to the same size. Fold the chopped pieces into the cream; refrigerate until you assemble the cannoli.",
      "Cut the pastry dough in half. On a lightly floured surface, roll out one piece of dough to a rectangle, 14 inches by 11 inches (or as close as possible). With a sharp knife and ruler, trim the edges and divide the rectangle into a dozen squares, about 3-1/2 inches on a side. (If you can only get 9 squares of that size or slightly larger, that's fine!). Set the squares aside, on a lightly floured tray, to rest for 15 minutes before frying. Meanwhile, roll out and divide the remaining half of dough the same way.",
      "To fry the pastry, pour oil into the skillet to a depth of 1/4-inch and set over medium heat. With the point of a small sharp knife, pierce each pastry square about 10 times all over its surface, as though you were making pin pricks through the dough. (These tiny holes will prevent the pastry from ballooning when fried.).",
      "Heat the oil until the edge of a square sizzles gently when dipped into it, then lay in as many squares as you can, 2 inches apart. Raise the heat to keep the oil temperature up (but lower it as soon as the sizzling gets too fast). Fry the squares for about 3 minutes on the first side, pushing them under the oil occasionally to heat the top surface. As the tops begin to bubble, press with tongs to prevent big bubbles from ballooning-small bubbles are OK. When the bottom is golden brown, flip the squares over and fry until evenly colored and crisp on both sides, about 2 minutes.",
      "As soon as they're done, lift the squares with tongs, let excess oil drip off, and lay them to drain on folded paper towels; flip them over to blot the oil from both sides. Fry all the squares this way, adding oil as needed and heating it between batches.",
      "Assemble your cannoli Napoleons shortly before serving, with 3 nice squares for each. Set one square on the plate, drop about 1-1/2 tablespoons of cannoli cream in the center, lay another square on top-sides aligned-and press gently to spread the cream. Drop on another layer of cream, cover with the third square and press. Finally, shower the top of each Napoleon with powdered sugar (and embellish with drizzles of honey or a sprinkle of finely grated chocolate) and serve."

      "Cucumbers and Onions -- In a small bowl, add the cucumbers, onions and the rice wine vinegar. NOTE: Some like the onions and cucumbers a bit sweeter so just add a bit of sugar. Also, if you use white wine vinegar vs rice wine vinegar, it isn't as sweet, so you may want to add a bit more sugar to sweeten it. Just let them set at room temperature as the salmon marinates. These also can be done ahead of time. They would be fine made the day before.",
      "Grilling -- First, make sure to take the salmon out of refrigerator to take the chill off. As I mentioned, this is really best made on the outside grill, but even a inside grill pan would be fine. If you don't have either, just use a saute pan. Season your grill or pan with a little nonstick spray and bring to medium high to high heat. Make sure to also season your salmon with a little pepper and grill on each side 4-5 minutes. I prefer to put the flesh side down first and then flip it over, brush with some of the marinade and continue to cook another 4-5 minutes. You want the salmon to be fork tender. Remove from the grill and set to the side as you put your sandwiches together. Simply use a fork and pull the fillet off the skin.",
      "Rolls -- As the sandwich is grilling, I like to lightly toast the rolls. No need for butter or oil.",
      "Sandwich -- Spread a little of the wasabi mayo on each of the rolls (top and bottom), then add the arugula, salmon and finish with the cucumber onion salad.",
      "Serve -- Serve with some Asian slaw or a nice fresh citrus salad. This is a hearty sandwich and it is a great lunch sandwich or even a great light dinner. ENJOY!",
      "Note: If you have any of the cucumbers left over. They will stay a few days in your fridge just fine and they are great on roast beef, ham, chicken sandwiches or are wonderful over grilled fish. Or toss with some romaine and some other fresh ingredients for a nice kick to your salad."

      "We're going to start with mixing together the yeast and WARM water for these delicious rolls.",
      "While the WARM water and yeast are dissolving, we're going to mix together the milk and butter in a glass measuring cup and pop it in the microwave for one minute to WARM the milk and melt the butter. In the meantime we're going to throw in (to the yeast mixture): the beaten egg, the sugar, the salt, and 1 cup of flour.",
      "Now add the WARM milk / butter mixture into the yeast mixture. It can't be piping hot, so let it cool to warm before adding, otherwise you will kill the yeast. Give that a mix, and then add the second cup of flour (Switch to using a spatula to mix the dough now) Give that a mix, and add the third cup of flour and that will form a wet, sticky dough, but it should be dry enough to scrap out on to the cutting board to begin to knead.",
      "On a floured board, we're going to plop down the dough and we're going to work that for about 6-7 minutes. We're only going to add flour in when the dough gets too sticky to knead. So make sure your hands are floured, and work that using the old kneading method - half turns and push it with your palm.",
      "Knead that until you have a smooth and elastic, but still soft and slightly sticky dough. Don't work too much flour into the dough, only add it if it gets to sticky to work with. So knead it until it gets to this point - this is what I mean by elastic, see how it springs back. Form that into a nice smooth ball.",
      "In a mixing bowl, add the vegetable oil, throw in the dough and make sure it's coated with oil so it doesn't dry out. Cover with a towel and let it rise, in a warn spot, until double in size. It should take about an hour to an hour and a half.",
      "After it doubles, throw it on a lightly floured cutting board, and pat it down with your hands. Form it into a square shape. Then take a knife and cut it into 12 pieces (or how ever many dinner rolls you have scaled the recipe for). Then we're going to shape the rolls, which is very simple. Just take a piece of dough and roll it into a round shape in your palm.",
      "Now, we're going to put them on the pan, kind of close, about 1 1/2\" apart. As they rise and double in size, which will take about 30-45 minutes, they will sort of touch each other and that's what going to give them that great dinner roll shape.",
      "We're going to bake these at 350 degrees F. for 20-25 minutes, until golden brown. And that is one beautiful set of dinner rolls. They even have that traditional touching \"pull-apart\" quality which I think is pretty cool. And, since these are so easy, I don't buy these at the store anymore. It's just not how I \"roll.\" Anyway, give these a try. Enjoy!",

Continue to cook (swirling occasionally) until caramel is light amber and registers about 360 degrees on candy or instant-read thermometer, 1 to 3 minutes longer. Remove saucepan from heat and carefully add cream to center of pan; stir with whisk or spatula (mixture will bubble and steam vigorously) until cream is fully incorporated and bubbling subsides.
