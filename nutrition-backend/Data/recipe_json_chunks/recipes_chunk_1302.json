The lid being on the pan during the long cooking portion of the program is key. By keeping the lid on, enough water stays in the pan to keep the onions from drying out and burning.

Switch to the dough hook and mix on medium speed for 5 to 7 minutes, or as long as it takes to create a smooth, sticky dough.

The finished dough will be springy, elastic, and sticky, not just tacky.",

You can place the bags into the freezer for up to 3 months. Transfer them to the refrigerator the day before you plan to make pizza.)",

Sprinkle the dough with flour, mist it again with spray oil, and cover the dough loosely with plastic wrap or a food-grade plastic bag. Now let rest for 2 hours."

Fry 4-5 minutes on the first side and about 2 minutes on the second side in canola oil on medium heat in batches, gently in one layer at a time until done, turning once. Do not crowd pan. Do not overheat the oil, it should be hot enough as soon as pinch of bread crumbs sizzles. Remove each batch onto cooling rack set over paper towels. Salt each batch immediately after frying. Add more oil a little at a time if pan seems dry. Hold salted batches in warm oven until frying is done. Makes a nice pile and they are also good in sandwiches the next day."

Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. With a long chef's knife, cut a slit into the middle of the eye of the veal and use your fingers to stuff the kidney into the flesh. Season the rack of veal with salt and pepper. Heat the remaining olive oil in a medium saute pan or skillet. Add the veal and sear over high heat until well-browned on all sides, about 3 mins. Transfer to a small, lightly oiled roasting pan. Add the garlic, onion, and carrot to the pan. Place in preheated oven and roast until veal is cooked through and kidneys are pink, 30-45 mins. A meat thermometer inserted in its thickest point should read 160-170 degrees F. Remove the rack to a platter and keep warm. De-glaze by placing the roasting pan on top of the stove, add 1 cup water to the juices and bring to a boil over high heat. Strain and season to taste with salt and pepper. Cut the rack into 4 pieces and serve with the juices."

Add the red wine, juniper berries and bay leaves. Reduce by half. Return the duck legs to the pan, skin side up, along with enough chicken stock to cover three quarters of the duck. Bring to a simmer, cover and place in the middle of the preheated oven. After one hour remove the lid and add the peeled chestnuts. Cook for an additional half hour, until duck is tender and starting to pull away from the bone. Remove the duck from the pan and return to the top of the stove. Add the huckleberries and reduce to a light sauce consistency. Using a ladle, skim off any fat that may have accumulated on top. Return the duck legs to the pan and warm through. Serve over wide ribbon noodles."

      "1. Warm the Water Slightly. It should feel just a bit warmer than body temperature, about 100 degrees Fahrenheit. Using warm water will allow the dough to rise to the right point for storage in about 2 hours. You can use cold tap water and get a great final result, but the initial rise will take longer. (Some people prefer the flavor of slow-risen dough.)",

      "3. Measure and Mix In the Flour. Use the \"scoop and sweep\" method: Reach into the flour bin with your cup and scoop up a full measure all at once, then sweep it level with a knife. Mix in the flour with a wooden spoon, food processor with a dough attachment, stand mixer with a paddle, or a dough whisk. (See Pizza-Making Supplies: Build Your Arsenal for our favorite pizza-making products.) You may need to use wet hands to get the last bit of flour to incorporate, but do not knead the dough. You're finished with this step when everything is uniformly moistened and the dough is loose enough to conform to the container.",
      "4. Allow the Dough to Rise. Cover the dough with a lid (not airtight). Allow the dough to rise at room temperature until it begins to flatten on the top (approximately 2 hours, depending on the room's temperature and the initial water temperature). Do not punch down the dough. With our method, you're trying to retain as much gas in the dough as possible, and punching it down knocks out gas and will make your pizza dense.",
      "",
      "5. Refrigerate. After the dough has risen, refrigerate and use it over the next 2 weeks. The dough will develop tangy sourdough characteristics over that time. Fully refrigerated wet dough is less sticky and is easier to work with than dough at room temperature, so the first time you try our method, it's best to refrigerate the dough overnight"

When shimmering, add meat and cook until well browned on all sides. (You may need to do this in batches- avoid overcrowding the meat.) Once all of the meat is browned, set it aside in a bowl. Add a little bit more oil if needed and cook onions 3-5 min until tender. Scrape any bits left from the meat browning into the onions. Add garlic, stir for 1-2 min until very fragrant. Add tomato paste, paprika, and generous pinch of red pepper flakes.. Stirring constantly, cook for approx 5 minutes or until tomato paste no longer has totally raw smell. Return beef and any accumulated juices to pot, add broth and wine. Cover and put in the oven. Let it go until meat is fork tender and sauce has come together... this time, I cooked it at 325F for 1.5 hours, then turned the oven down to 300F when I left the house and let it cook for another 2.5 hours. Remove from the oven and finish at a low simmer on the stovetop. At this point, you are just keeping warm and adjusting seasoning (salt/pepper/crished red pepper). Anytime you add crushed red pepper, let it simmer for awhile and taste again- builds sneakily.

      "First things first; get your salsa on the go. Put a little olive oil into a pan, add the onion and sliced garlic, throw in the cinnamon stick and a good crumbling of chili, and fry on a gentle heat for 10 minutes, until the onions are soft and sweet. Now turn the heat up and add your red wine vinegar - it will steam and might even make you cough but this is a normal reaction! Then turn the heat down to low and add your canned tomatoes, chopped up. Simmer slowly for half an hour while you get on with your lentils.",
      "Preheat the oven to 400\u00b0F. Put the lentils into a pot, cover them with water, and add the 2 whole cloves of garlic, the bay leaf, and some tied-up stems from the parsley. Simmer for around 20 minutes, making sure that you've got enough liquid covering the lentils. Toss your sausages in a little olive oil and put them in a roasting pan in the preheated oven for 25 minutes or until golden and crisp. Drop your broccoli into a pot of boiling water for a few minutes when the sausages come out of the oven. When done, drain in a colander and toss in a bowl with a squeeze of lemon juice and some extra virgin olive oil.",
      "Once the lentils are cooked, remove the parsley stems and bay leaf and pour away most of the water from the pot. Mash the garlic cloves up with a spoon, mix in with the lentils, and dress them using 4 tablespoons of good extra virgin olive oil and 1 or 2 tablespoons of good vinegar. Throw in all your finely chopped parsley leaves, mix, and season.",
      "Remove the sausages from the roasting pan and pour away any fat. Tip the lentils into your serving bowls. Remove the cinnamon stick from the salsa rossa and discard it, then season well to taste and spoon it over your lentils. Place 2 sausages, either sliced or whole, on top. Sprinkle with the thyme and serve with a big bowl of steaming broccoli."

Melt the butter in the pan, quickly saut raviolis, remove from pan and set aside. Add the shallots and figs to the pan. Saut for a minute. Add the pomegranate juice and port. Saut for another minute or two. Place three raviolis onto each plate along with two fig halves and three strips of prosciutto between the raviolis. Crumble goat cheese equally onto each plate. Drizzle peppered-pomegranate sauce over raviolis as desired. Garnish each plate with Italian parsley and fresh pomegranate arils."
