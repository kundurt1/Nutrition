With a metal skewer, fasten neck skin to back, threading skewer in and out several times through neck and back skin. Turn turkey over and loosely pack body cavity with dressing. If turkey has tail attached, tuck tail into cavity. If there's enough skin to overlap at opening, thread a metal skewer in and out several times to close. Lightly tie ends of drumsticks loosely together with cotton string to keep them from spreading apart or leave untied to allow heat to reach thigh joints more easily. Place any leftover dressing in a baking dish. When turkey is about 30 minutes from being done, bake extra dressing, covered, in a 325\u00b0 or 350\u00b0 oven until hot (at least 150\u00b0 in center), about 40 minutes for 8 cups.",

To each mound of coals, add 5 briquets now and every 30 minutes while cooking.",

With spatula, transfer fillets to an ovenproof platter, laying pieces side by side, and keep warm in a 200\u00b0 oven.

Garnish with lemon slices and remaining parsley and sprinkle generously with pepper. With spatula, transfer fillets to plates. Season to taste with more salt."
