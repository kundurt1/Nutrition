      "Note: If measuring flour rather than weighing, don't press down into the flour as you scoop it in with dry-ingredient measuring cups, By gently scooping up flour, then sweeping the top level with a knife or spatula.you willl get a more accurate measurement.",
      "In large plastic storage container (with lid) mix together the flour, yeast and salt.",
      "Add all the liquid at once and mix with a wooden spoon.",
      "If mixing becomes too difficult to incorporate all the flour with the spoon, reach into the mixing bowl with very wet hands and press the mixture together. Note: kneading isn't necessary.",
      "When everything is uniformly moist without dry patches your mixing is complete. This should take only a few minutes.",
      "The dough will be wet and loose enough to conform to the shape of its container.",
      "Cover with a lid (not airtight) that fits well on the container. Allow the mixture to rise at room temperature until it begins to collapse, or at least flattens on the top, about 2 hours, depending on the room's temperature and the initial water temperature. Longer rising times, up to about 5 hours, will not harm the result.",
      "You can use a portion of the dough anytime after this period. Fully refrigerated wet dough is less sticky and easier to work with than dough at room temperature. So the first time you try this method, it's best to refrigerate the dough overnight, or at least 3 hours, before shaping a loaf.",
      "The breads flavor improves with the retardation, so suggest you wait at least 24 hours before baking the first loaf! Dough may be stored in the refrigerator for up to 10 days.",
      "To bake Boule (Round Loaf):",
      "First, prepare a pizza peel by sprinkling it liberally with cornmeal to prevent the loaf from sticking (or use parchment paper).",
      "With wet hands, pull up one end of the refrigerated dough. Using a serrated knife, cut off a 1-pound, or grapefruit-size, piece of dough. Hold the mass of dough in your hands; if it sticks, add a little flour until the dough no longer sticks to your hand. Gently stretch the surface of the dough on all four sides, rotating the ball a quarter-turn as you go. Most of the dusting flour will fall off. The bottom of the loaf may appear to be a collection of bunched ends, but they will flatten out during resting and baking. The dough ball should be smooth and cohesive and take no more than 30 to 60 seconds to shape.",
      "Now it's decision time, which method to use for baking.",
      "COVERED POT METHOD:",
      "Cover loosely with plastic wrap and let rise at room temperature until dough has doubled in size and does not readily spring back when poked with finger, about 60 - 90 minutes.",
      "About 30 minutes before baking, adjust oven rack to lowest position, place 6- to 8-quart heavy-bottomed Dutch oven (with lid) on rack, and heat oven to 450 degrees. Lightly flour top of dough and, using razor blade or sharp knife, make one 6-inch-long, 1/2-inch-deep slit along top of dough.",
      "Carefully remove pot from oven and remove lid.",
      "Pick up dough by lifting parchment overhang and lower into pot (let any excess parchment hang over pot edge).",
      "Cover pot and place in oven.",
      "Reduce oven temperature to 425 degrees and bake covered for 20 minutes.",
      "Remove lid and continue to bake until loaf is deep brown and instant-read thermometer inserted into center registers 200 degrees, 10 to 15 minutes longer.",
      "Carefully remove bread from pot; transfer to wire rack and cool to room temperature, about 2 hours.",
      "BAKING ON GRILL:",
      "First make a 'pillow' of aluminum foil and place in the bottom of the pot. This prevent the bottom from burning. To assure that the bottom does not burn, I also place the pot on a heat diffuser. Preheat the grill and pan to 450 degrees . . . from here follow the oven directions above.",
      "BAKING ON STONE::",
      "Place the shaped ball on the prepared pizza peel (or parchment paper), cover and allow to rest 60 - 90 minutes.",
      "Place a baking stone on the lowest rack of the oven.",
      "Place an empty broiler tray (I use my cast-iron skillet) on an oven shelf, making sure it will not interfere with the rising bread as it bakes.",
      "Preheat oven to 450 degrees 20 minutes before baking.",
      "Spray top of dough with cold water (which allows a knife to slash through the dough without sticking). Use a serrated bread knife to slash a 1/4-inch-deep cross or tic-tac-toe pattern onto the top.",
      "Slide the loaf off the pizza peel onto the preheated baking stone using a quick, forward jerking motion. If using parchment just lift off peel and place on stone.",
      "Pour 1 cup hot water into the broiler tray and close oven door to trap steam.",
      "Bake about 30-35 minutes, or until the crust is nicely browned and sounds hollow when tapped.",

      "Place the roast in a rack set over a roasting pan or shallow sheet pan and place in oven.",
      "Here's the trick to the whole process. Roast the meat until the center of the roast reaches 115\u00b0F for medium rare or 125\u00b0F for medium. Don't exceed 125\u00b0F for best results. This took about 1 hour for a 2-1/2 lb roast and about 1 hr and 45 minutes for a 4 pound roast. Don't rely entirely on times to judge doneness. Temperature is very important here.",
      "Once temperature is reached, turn off the oven, leaving roast undisturbed, until internal temperature reaches 130\u00b0F for medium-rare and 140\u00b0F for medium. Depending on roast size, this could be anywhere from 15 minutes to and hour longer. If the roast doesn't reach the desired temperature in a reasonable time, reheat the oven to 225\u00b0F for a few minutes, turn oven off again and finish the process.",
      "Remove roast from oven; let rest for the usual 15 minutes and slice thinly to serve.",
      "Notes: If your roast size varies from the 4 pounds mentioned, adjust the salt and pepper accordingly. Also, don't open the oven door any more than absolutely necessary. A thermometer with remote sensor, that can remain in the center of the roast while it is in the oven, is a great help. Remember, it's temperature, not time that makes this work. Seasonings are up to you but don't neglect the initial salt as it contributes to the tenderizing process. Because it is enzymes in the meat that help tenderize the tissues up to about 122\u00b0F, keeping the temperature below this point for as long a possible improves tenderness."

Carefully add to hot oil being sure not to overcrowd the pot. Let each be for a minute or two until browned, the flip and wait. Repeat until all sides are browned. Using a slotted spoon, remove the nicely browned meat chunks and pile up in a large bowl or plate. Repeat this process until all meat has been nicely browned.",
      "While your pot of oil is still hot, add in the onions (if it's looking a little dry, you can add in a bit more oil) and turn the heat down to medium. Give a sprinkle of salt and pepper to them now and grab a spoon and stir them a bit. Let the onions cook, while stirring every now and then until they start to turn translucent.",

Again, give a nice sprinkle of salt and pepper to the pot. Let it all cook down, stirring when you're not having a taste of your margarita (by the way, you should be drinking a margarita) until the peppers begin to soften (they don't need to be soft and mush because it's going to simmer away on the stove top for a bit).",
      "In between cooking down the vegetables and enjoying a margarita, mix together your spices. Grab a small bowl and combine the chili powder through the red pepper flakes. Mix them together.",
      "Once your peppers have softened, pour in that beautiful spice blend and stir. Give a big ol' stir to everything to make sure you've got every bit of onion and pepper and garlic coated with those fragrant spices. You want to keep it moving so you don't burn any spices. Heating the spices for a couple minutes like this will help to bloom them and bring out lots of great flavor.",
      "After a couple minutes, pour in some of your brewed coffee (about a 1/2 cup) and it will sizzle and steam. Take this opportunity to go in and scrape the bottom of the pot with your spoon. Get every last bit up off the bottom and mixed into the coffee and vegetables. Then, go ahead and add in almost the rest of the coffee, saving about a 1/4 cup (you'll see why next).",
      "Carefully pour the can of tomatoes in (especially if you've got white countertops). Before disposing of your can, rinse it out with the reserved coffee. Add the caffeine water to your empty can, swirl it about to clean off any tomato residue and then add to the soon to be simmering pot.",
      "Finally, add in the beans and the chipotle peppers. Grab your plate of browned beef and add them to the pot along with any liquid that has seeped out. Combine it all nicely with your spoon and crank the heat to high. When it begins to boil, put the lid on and turn the heat down low. Let it simmer away for 2 hours, giving it a stir every now and then (if you forget, it won't be the end of the world). This will make all the delicious fat in the steak melt into the chili, the flavors will meld and your meat will turn very tender. Use this two hour window to clean up, make a pitcher of margaritas, prep any condiments you want to serve it with and chop your chocolate.",
      "After the 2 hours are up, if you're still standing, turn off the heat and remove the lid. Sprinkle over the dark chocolate and let it melt in as you slowly stir the giant pot of chili. Taste and season with salt and pepper to your liking.",

Add in a little more salt to taste if needed.",
      "If you wish to substitute fresh tomatoes for the canned ones - go for it! If you can't find the Wick Fowler's spice kit, just use chili powder, oregano, cumin, salt, paprika, masa, and salt to taste. Wick Fowler also makes spicier versions of this kit. I get mine at Big Lots for $1.00/ea. Regarding the corn, it is best to use freshly roasted corn-on-the cob, but you can use canned or frozen corn instead. Also, Trader Joe's sells a roasted corn in the frozen section, which works well too - just don't use much, as this adds calories and carbs. As far as the turkey, I use either Jennie-O's or Foster Farmsand this is the standard \"LEAN\" type of ground turkey. They also make a ground turkey breast version which is fat free, but will provide a result which is a bit dry for my taste, thus the standard LEAN type seems to work best."

But don't cook this too long as it will make the meat tough and the cheese will melt and leak out all over the place. Just heat until meat is slightly brown on top and bottom and the cheese has mostly melted.",

Top with grilled onions, lettuce, tomato, pickle, and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Add top piece of toast, slice sandwich on the diagonal, throw on a plate with some potato chips and get busy (all the while wondering why you didn't go ahead and make that second one while you were at it!) -- back to the kitchen.

    "title": "sausage and cabbage casserole",
    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "First of all, prepare the cabbage. Put a big pot with water to boil. Do it first, this way it will get to the boiling point by the time you're done with the cabbage. Cut the cabbage head in half, then again in half, and then cut the core out by cutting the corner diagonally. Then cut it in inches wide strips, and separate them a little.",
      "Once the water boils, salt WELL, and put all the cabbage inches It will look like a lot, but don't worry, it will wilt down a lot too. Cover. As soon as the water returns to a boil, count 10 to 15 minutes, and drain. Reserve.",
      "As the cabbage is cooking, you can get started on the other vegetables. First the carrots. Peel them and cut them in 1/3 of an inch slices. Reserve.",
      "Wash the leeks. Leeks need to be really washed thoroughly (nothing worse than having your teeth grind on dirt when you eat). First remove the first couple of peels, cut the dark green hard part of and trim the roots. Then cut them in half, almost all the way, but leaving the bottom inch still attached.",
      "Wash them really well, check each leaf on both sides for dirt. Then chop them 2/3 of an inch thick chunks.",
      "TIP : when you prepare and wash leeks, remember to always do it the root side UP, so that the dirt washes out of the leeks instead of flowing further inches.",
      "Put them in a colander, and separate them, under running water to be safe for dirt . Reserve.",
      "Now chop some bacon in half inch thick chunks. I use about 6-7 slices of bacon, but you can use more if you like. Just don't use less, we need both the fat the bacon is going to release, and the flavor as a base for the cabbage.",
      "Just before you actually start cooking the dish, rinse the pot you cooked the cabbage in, put your potatoes in (skin on), lukewarm water, cover and put to boil. When it boils, add 2 cubes of Knorr vegetable bouillon cube, and salt liberally. Once it comes to a boil, pre-cook them for 20 minutes, then remove from the heat and leave in the scalding water untill you're ready for them.",
      "Now we are actually ready to start cooking.",
      "Start the bacon it in the braisier with a little olive oil on medium heat to get it started. Once its starting to become golden, remove it from the pan with a slotted spoon and reserve.",
      "In the same fat, add half a Tbsp of lard and saute the carrots on medium heat with a little salt. Cover for 5-10 minutes, toss, cover again, for another 5-10 minutes, until they are starting to become golden. Remove from the pan with a slotted spoon and reserve.",
      "In the same fat, lower the heat to medium low, toss in the leeks, with a Tbsp of butter (gotta have butter with leeks), salt and pepper, and cover it until it begins to melt, about 10 minutes.",
      "Add the cabbage and the bacon back in the pan and toss everything together until its mixed well.",
      "Push it a little to make room for the 2 sausages, and hide the carrots behind the barrier made by the sausages. I use Hillshire Farm. (NOTE : Always rinse the sausages under cold water when you take it out of the package). Taste the cabbage for salt. Then cover with 2 cups of beef stock. When I don't have time to make my own, I use Kitchen Basics beef stock, because as its low in sodium, it allows me to control the salt.",
      "Now peel the potatoes, and nest them well in the cabbage so they can suck up all the flavors. If you have extra potatoes you can put the extra ones on top of the sausages too.",
      "Turn the heat to low, now its simmer time. Put a nob of butter on top of each potato, and sprinkle them generously with paprika (paprika+cabbage+any kind of polish sausage = great together). Cover.",
      "Flipp them once after 30 minutes. Baste them with the juices and sprinkle them with Paprika on the other side. Cover for half an hour. After half an hour, spoon the juice over the potatoes and the cabbage to have them absorb the flavors. Do it again every half hour for the next 2 hours, keeping it covered. Check the cabbage for salt and rectify if necessary.",
      "NOTE : If you were making the dish a day in advance, this is where you would pause it.",
      "Uncover, turn the heat up to medium/medium low (you want it to reduce, but not burn the cabbage), and let the beef stock reduce almost all the way through.",
      "Slice the sausage and put it back in the braisier.",
      "Serve with Dijon Mustard.",
      "Enjoy !",
      "NOTE : never be afraid to cook cabbage for a long time (preferably braising it, like above). It's one of these vegetables that need a long cooking time to develop their sweetness and be good. The entire dish would be \"cooked\" per-se, an hour and a half earlier, but it needs that extra hour and a half, basting every 30 minutes, for the cabbage to taste right and the potatoes to absorb all the flavors of the dish. The more you cook this dish, the better it will get.",
      "It's also a great dish to make a day in advance and reheat covered on very low heat. In this case, stop it at the \"pause\" stage, when you uncover it and let the beef stock reduce for half an hour. It will finish reducing as you re-heat it, only, you would keep it covered first until it starts to simmer."
