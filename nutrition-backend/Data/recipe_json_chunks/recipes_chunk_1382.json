I use a pestle and mortar as I like to use my hands, but a blender will do the trick with far less effort! Set the rub to one side.",

Bring to a boil, then turn down to a simmer and cook gently for about 2 hours. (Because you are going to puree this, you want the beans to be very soft).

After the butter has melted, keep heating it-it will start to bubble and sizzle furiously, and then start to recede. You'll see brown solids begin to fall and collect at the bottom of the skillet while the butter turns caramel in color. Around this time you'll catch the butter's nutty aroma rising from the skillet. Add the sage leaves, stir, and remove to a bowl.",

Just be sure to give it a good stir now and then so that the butter doesn't burn. Once it's gorgeous and fragrant, remove the pan from the heat and transfer the butter to a heat-proof bowl. Cool till lukewarm. [Note: while the butter is cooling, give it a stir now and then, just to prevent it from solidifying. You just want to butter to be cool enough so that it won't scramble the eggs when they're added.]",
      "In a large bowl, combine the cooled brown butter, 3/4 cup of sugar, and salt. Stir till well blended. Add the yolks and the almond extract, whisk until smooth. Using a large rubber spatula or wooden spoon, stir in the flour until you have a stiff dough. [It will have a very odd, dense texture for shortbread, but it will bake up beautifully, so don't worry.] Transfer about 2 cups of the dough to the foil-lined pan and press it evenly onto the bottom.\r\n\r\n Refrigerate pan for about 40 minutes.",
      "Topping: Add remaining 1/4 cup of sugar and hazelnuts to leftover dough, and using your fingertips, work the sugar & nuts into the dough until becomes crumbly; set aside.",
      "Divide the oven, placing one rack second from the bottom, and the other second from the top. Heat the oven to 325 F.",
      "Remove the pan from the refrigerator and prick the crust several times with a fork. [Chilling and pricking the dough will keep it from puffing up too much in the oven.] Place the pan on the lowest oven rack and bake the dough for about 15 minutes, just until the crust begins to set. Don't worry if the center still looks doughy, it's better to under-bake it at this stage.",

      "Pre-heat oven to 300 degrees F.",
      "Start the tomato sauce. Pour the olive oil in a large Dutch oven pot over medium flame. Add the onions, then the garlic, then the carrots, and then the celery and saute until the onion is translucent.",
      "Add the tomato paste and stir in fully to blend. Then, add the diced tomatoes, and again stir until blended. Then, add the wine and cook for a few minutes. Then, add the stock or water. Add fresh herbs of your choice, and cook the sauce over low heat. After a while, add the sugar. Let the sauce simmer while you prepare the filling for the red bell peppers. Please note that fire roasted tomatoes will give the sauce a mildly spicy favor, which some people prefer.",
      "Begin the meat filling. Place all the filling ingredients (note: about 3/4 cup parmesan) EXCEPT the mozzarella balls into a glass bowl, and carefully mix the ingredients so they are well blended.",
      "Slice the tops off the peppers, and remove all seeds. Place the filling in the peppers, but make a hole in the filling you have put in the pepper with your finger so you can insert a mozzarella ball in the center of the pepper as you stuff it.",
      "If the tomato sauce looks like it is somewhat firm and reduced, place the stuffed peppers in the Dutch oven. You may fit them in snugly. Liberally spoon some tomato sauce on and over each stuffed pepper. NOTE: it is going to look like there is not much sauce, but as the stuffed peppers bake in the oven, the peppers and all the vegetables in the meat filling will give off lots of liquid, so in the end there will be plenty of sauce.",
      "Bring to a low boil, cover, and then place the Dutch oven into the oven to bake for at least an hour, and more likely two. Baste the peppers by spooning sauce into the peppers so the arborio rice absorbs liquid. Repeat the basting occasionally.",
      "Test for doneness by taking a tiny taste of rice in one pepper. If the rice is done, you have a few choices. 1) Place a little parmesan cheese over each pepper, and return to the oven until the cheese is melted. Serve. 2) Pull the peppers from the oven, allow them to cool, and refrigerate. If you want to serve them the next day (they will taste even better) take the peppers out of the fridge and allow them to come to room temperature. You can heat them on top of the stove, covered. Test the sauce for desired thickness - adding more tomato paste to stir if necessary.",
      "Serve by slicing each pepper in half, topped with some sauce. Note: One pepper is a very hearty serving."

      "Pizza dough: \r\nIn a small saucepan, bring milk, rosemary, salt and oil to a simmer. While it's simmering, measure out your flour into a large mixing bowl and make a hollow in the center of the flour. Once simmered, pour milk into the hollow in the flour, and slowly begin incorporating the flour. The mixture will look curdled - you keep mixing it until the ingredients are completely combined and look like a ready-to-go dough. \r\n\r\nNow add the eggs. It will be harder to incorporate the eggs - keep working the dough (usually I combine folding with a spatula and mixing with a wisk). It will look very wet and very curdled after a little while. No worries. Now add the cheese. Mix, mix, mix!\r\n\r\nOnce the cheese is incorporated, you should have a sticky-looking, stretchy dough. You may want to add up to 1/2 cup more flour throughout the process, to make the dough a little easier to work with. \r\n\r\nNow, with wet hands, divide the dough into sections. I usually have enough for 3 pizzas. The leftover dough can be floured, wrapped in parchment, and put in the freezer (or if you wan pizza again tomorrow, the refrigerator).\r\n\r\nLet the dough sit out while you prep the toppings.",

Mixing occasionally, cook your apples and onions until they start to look golden brown and the apples are soft - but not so soft that they mush when you mix them. When they're done, turn off the heat but leave them in the pan for now.",

It should be about 1/2 inch thick when you're done.",

      "3. To the Dutch oven, add the onion, garlic, cumin, and ancho chile, sauteing until the onion is translucent - about 1 to 2 minutes. Turn off the heat, and add the red wine vinegar and the Dr Pepper, scrapping up any cooked bits at the bottom of the pan. Add the brisket fat side up back to the Dutch oven. Cover and cook in the oven for 3 to 4 hours or until the meat is fork tender. Check the brisket after about 2 hours, if the liquids at the bottom of the pan have dried up or are beginning to caramelize, add a little bit of water. Cover and continue to cook.",
      "4. When the brisket is done, remove the Dutch oven from the oven and place on the stove to cool uncovered for about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, prep the taco fixings.",
      "5. To remove the skin from the poblanos, rub the peppers in oil and hold over the flame of a gas range, turning the pepper every few seconds to blacken and blister evenly. Carefully place the pepper into a brown paper bag and let it cool - the bag will help trap steam and make the blistered skin easier to remove. Once the pepper is cool enough to handle, rub the skin with a paper towel to remove. Remove the stem, ribs, and seeds and slice into thin strips.",
      "6. In a skillet set over medium-high heat, add a bit more oil and the onions, cooking for a minute or two. Add the poblano strips and cook for another minute. Add a few whole stalks of cilantro and a lime wedge or two, letting them char slightly. Turn off the heat and squeeze a lime wedge over the pan, tossing to combine.",
      "7. After the brisket has set for about 30 minutes, transfer the meat to a bowl. Using two forks, peel off and discard the remaining fat layer and shred the rest of the meat.",
      "8. Pour the remaining drippings from the Dutch oven into another small bowl, straining out any remaining fat. Thin the drippings using a bit more Dr Pepper. Pour a bit of this liquid over the shredded brisket and set the rest aside for serving.",
      "9. To assemble a taco: take a warm tortilla, top with brisket, a spoonful or two of the sauteed onions and peppers, a few cilantro leaves, and another squeeze of lime. Serve with rice, beans, salsa, chips, beer, or wherever else your tacos cravings take you."

      "A day or two before you plan to serve this, cut the greens off the beets, leaving about an inch of their stems attached. Thoroughly scrub the beets; put in a medium saucepan, and cover with at least two inches of water. Bring to a boil, reduce to a brisk simmer and cook until knife-tender, but not too soft, 20 to 30 minutes, depending on their size and age. Remove from the pan and let cool.",
      "Meanwhile, make the pickling brine: Tie up the whole spices into a small piece of cheesecloth, or put them in a small spice bag or tea ball. Put them in a small heavy saucepan with the vinegar, sugar, ginger and a pinch of salt. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer for a minute -- no more. Remove from the heat.",
      "When the beets are cool enough to handle, remove the skins and pare away any discolored spots (not uncommon with organic beets, I've found). Cut into a small dice. Put half the dice into a glass storage container or wide-mouth pint Mason jar; pour over the brining solution, dropping the spice bag on top. Cover and refrigerate until ready to use the next day. Refrigerate separately the remaining diced beets.",
      "If you have time while waiting for the beets to cool, prepare the greens. (You can do this the next day, if you want). Cut away the stems and wash off any visible dirt. Fill a basin (or your sink) with cold water and soak the leaves for a few minutes, swishing every so often. Let them sit there undisturbed for at least a minute to let the dirt settle. Gently lift out and drain. If not using until the next day, dry carefully with a clean tea towel and store in a plastic bag until ready to cook. Reserve the stems for another use. On the day you plan to cook the greens, coarsely chop into pieces no larger than the palm of your hand.",
      "When you're ready to wilt the greens -- do this up to a few hours before the meal, but no more -- get out a large skillet with a well-fitting lid. Over medium heat, toast the walnuts dry, stirring occasionally, lest they burn. When they just start to darken and begin to smell fragrant, turn the heat way down, add the butter, stirring while it melts. Continue to cook the nuts in the butter for about a minute, stirring. Sprinkle generously with salt and toss well. Remove from the pan right away and set aside.",
      "Without wiping the skillet, turn the heat up to medium high and add the greens. Sprinkle with salt and give them a good stir. If they are dry, add a tablespoon of cold water and immediately cover the skillet. Count to ten and then turn the heat off. Do not lift the lid. Let the greens steam for about a minute. Remove the lid and give the greens a good stir. Remove from the pan and set aside. If the greens were wet when you put them in the skillet, use a large spoon to remove, pressing gently against the side of the skillet to remove the water on the leaves. Use a wide, shallow dish for serving.",
      "When ready to serve, test for salt and sprinkle on more if necessary. Drizzle on the walnut oil and sprinkle on black pepper; toss lightly. Top with the drained, pickled beets and toasted walnuts.",
      "Enjoy!! ;o)",
      "I don't usually add the stems when making this, for aesthetic reasons. I do, however, save them and then chop them into dice once I've used the pickled beets. After lightly steaming the chopped stems in a hot covered skillet with a few tablespoons of water, I heat the pickling solution in the Mason jar (in a microwave) and then add the chard and beet stems. After a day or two, I stir them into lentil salads, fresh green salads or use them with other wilted seasonal greens. ;o)",
      "You can also roast the beets if you prefer, but I find that the golden beets retain their bright color much better when boiled in their skins. Also, with fresh local seasonal beets, I don't find the extra sweetness from roasting to be worth the effort or extra time."

Taste the dressing first....if you want the salad a little more tart this is where to add the extra lemon juice. and reshake . Drizzle generously over the kale and Brussels sprouts and toss to coat.

Bring to a simmer, then turn heat down to medium high. Set a timer for 25 minutes. After about five minutes, the tomatoes and peppers will begin to release their juices, and the whole mixture should be bubbling. Adjust the heat if necessary so that the mixture stays at a constant bubble-medium to medium-high should do it. Stir every five minutes or so to make sure the tomatoes and peppers are not sticking to the bottom of the pan. If they are, add water by the 1/4 cup.",

Blend until smooth. Taste. Adjust seasoning with more salt and pepper as necessary.",
      "To assemble the gratin: Preheat the oven to 450\u00b0F. Arrange the sliced summer squash in single layers on rimmed sheet pans-you may need as many as three or more pans. Season with salt and pepper, drizzle each pan with at least 1 tablespoon olive oil (add more as needed), toss to coat, then spread into an even layer. Roast for 10 minutes or longer-you want to see some nice, dark coloring on the slices. Remove pans from oven and set aside. Note: If you roast three sheet pans at once, you may need to do some rearranging or to simply remove sheets as they are done - they all likely will not cook evenly. They may need as long as 15 to 20 minutes, too. \r\n\r\nReduce oven to 400\u00b0F.",
      "Meanwhile, make the breadcrumb topping: toss the breadcrumbs with the 1 cup grated parmesan cheese, 1/4 cup olive oil, 1/2 teaspoon salt and pepper to taste. Taste. If necessary, season with more salt or add more oil if crumbs seem dry. Set aside.",
      "Into a 9x13-inch baking pan, spoon in a small amount of sauce (about a heaping 1/2 cup or more), then add a single layer of squash, then a thin scattering of parmigiana (about 1/4 cup or so). Repeat until all ingredients are used, ending with a little sauce and cheese-you should have about 3 layers of squash. Top with the breadcrumb mixture.",

      "To make rosemary sugar: In a food processor, combine raw sugar and chopped rosemary (make sure the rosemary is completely dry if you've just rinsed it). Process for about 30 seconds, or until well integrated. (You won't need the full amount of rosemary sugar for one recipe, but it keeps well tightly covered, and it can be used in countless ways: to sweeten iced tea, to sprinkle over fresh fruit, etc.)",
      "To pan-roast peaches: Preheat oven to 425\u00b0 F. Liberally sprinkle cut sides of halved peaches with the rosemary sugar, and follow with a pinch of salt.",
      "Meanwhile, melt butter in a cast iron skillet over medium-high heat. Arrange the peaches in the skillet, cut side-down. Cook for 3 to 5 minutes without disturbing, until the cut sides begin to brown. (Note: The peaches will throw off juice while they're browning, but it will eventually thicken in the oven.)",
      "Transfer the skillet to the oven and roast for about 10 minutes. Flip the peaches, drizzle with butter, and continue roasting another 5 to 10 minutes, or until tender. (The total cooking time will depend on the size and ripeness of your peaches.)",
      "To make salted caramel sauce: Combine sugar, corn syrup (or golden syrup), and 1/4 cup water in a deep saucepan. Cook over medium-high heat, stirring once or twice, until the sugar has dissolved. Continue cooking without stirring (stirring can cause the sugar to crystallize), swirling the pan occasionally while the sugar cooks. If you notice any sugar on the sides of your sauce pan, brush it down with a wet pastry brush to dissolve the sugar crystals.",
      "Cook until the sugar has reached a deep amber color, about 7 to 10 minutes total. Then, immediately take the saucepan off the burner. (Keep a close eye: Your caramel can go from perfect to burnt in a matter of seconds. If using a candy thermometer, cook the sugar until it reaches 350\u00b0 F.)",
      "Once the pan is off the heat, add the heavy cream (stand back because it will sputter upon hitting the caramel), and then whisk in the butter until smooth. If the caramel develops any lumps, place it back over low heat and whisk until smooth. Let stand for 3 minutes, then add the vanilla extract. Season the finished caramel with fleur de sel to taste. Tightly covered and refrigerated, the caramel sauce should keep for several weeks in the fridge; gently rewarm it before serving.",
      "Note: When making caramel, I prefer the taste of golden syrup to that of corn syrup. If using golden syrup, I highly recommend the use of a candy thermometer. The golden syrup makes the sugar solution an amber color from the get-go, making it much, much harder to judge the stopping point by eye."

Thinly slice the pepper.",

Layer the eggplant and squash over the bottom half of the sandwich, distributing each in an even layer. Scatter an even layer of red pepper and onion over the other vegetables. Place the \"lid\" on the sandwich. Wrap the sandwich as tightly as you can with plastic wrap. You want the filling components to smoosh together and get really friendly. It's even okay if the sandwich gets a bit crushed in the picnic basket - the batard is quite sturdy and can take it! Allow to rest at room temperature for 1 to 2 hours or overnight in the fridge before slicing with a serrated knife and serving."

      "First, light your charcoal barbecue or fire. Wash the beets and snip off the greens, reserving them. Fold a large piece of foil -- about 12-18\" (24-36\" unfolded), depending on the size of your beets -- in half to form a double layer. Lay the greens, then the beets, then the rosemary on top of the foil. (Note: if you don't have greens with your beets -- or want to save them to cook separately -- that's okay, just make sure the coals are at medium heat, not flaming, when you add your packet of beets.)",
      "Roll up the foil, folding in the edges and twisting the ends together. Stab the foil a few times all over with a knife to allow the smoke to get inside and flavor the beets. Lift the rack of your barbecue with tongs and carefully insert your foil package among the coals, making sure you place some coals on top too.",
      "Leave it to cook for 30 to 40 minutes, or until the beets are tender, then remove the package and allow it to cool down. Unwrap it and remove the beets, discarding the greens and rosemary sprigs.",
      "Once cooled slightly, peel the beets and discard the charred skin. The skins should slip right off, but if they don't, gently scrape them away with the back of a paring knife. Cut the beets into irregular chunks and place in a bowl. Add the vinegar, 3 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil, plenty of salt and pepper and half the parsley and tarragon. Toss, have a taste and adjust the seasoning if necessary.",
      "Put the cottage cheese into a bowl and add the juice and finely grated zest from half your lemon. Stir in 2 glugs of extra virgin olive oil, the thyme leaves and some salt and pepper and gently fold it all together, so the oil and lemon marble through the cottage cheese. Taste the dressing and squeeze in a bit more lemon juice if you like.",
      "To serve, divide the dressed beets between four salad plates. Top each plate with a spoonful of cottage cheese dressing. Scatter over the remaining herbs and enjoy!"

      "Start by making the brioche dough. In a mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, 25 grams of the sugar, yeast, and a pinch of salt. In a small saucepan, melt the butter. Set aside to cool a little bit before whisking the 3 eggs into the butter. Pour these liquid ingredients into the dry ingredients. Knead the dough until it passes the window pane test. This is easiest done in a stand-mixer, but I just do it with the dough hooks of my handheld mixer (a bit of an arm workout but doable with such a small quantity of dough), which takes about 7 to 10 minutes.",
      "If you want to bake the brioche on the same day, cover the bowl and set aside somewhere warm to proof for 3 hours. Alternatively, cover the dough and place it in the fridge overnight. I have tried both methods for this and prefer the overnight method. Not only does it mean I can enjoy the pain suisse warm from the oven for breakfast-but, given the high butter content, the cold dough is also easier to handle when it comes to filling and dividing the pain suisse.",
      "Make the miso banana pastry cream. Heat the milk in a small saucepan until it starts to steam. In a mixing bowl, whisk together the egg and yolks with the cornstarch and sugar. Pour 1/3 of the steaming milk over the eggs, whisking constantly, to temper the eggs. Return the mixture to the saucepan with the milk. Whisking constantly, cook the pastry cream on a low to medium heat until very thick, 5 to 10 minutes. Set aside to cool.",
      "When you are ready to fill the pain suisse, add the miso and banana and blend into the pastry cream using an immersion blender (or a food processor). Cover and set aside to cool. Waiting to add the miso and banana at the very last moment prevents the pastry cream from discolouring.",
      "Preheat the oven to 180\u00b0 C (350\u00b0 F).",
      "Knock the brioche dough back and briefly knead before rolling out into a 45 by 25 centimeter rectangle, with one of the shorter sides of the rectangle facing you.",
      "Spread the pastry cream evenly over the bottom half of the dough, leaving a 2-centimeter border. Scatter the chocolate chips over the pastry cream and gently press into the pastry cream with the palm of your hand. Fold the border over the filling, then fold the top half of the dough over the bottom half. If they are uneven, cut off the edges of the rectangle, so you end up with a rectangle with straight sides all around.",

Note that these will require you to get started a day in advance. You can also use store-bought dough.",
      "On the day that you're making your pizza, pull out a 10 inch cast iron skillet, and pour a couple glugs of olive oil in to it. Plop in your half batch of pizza dough and flip it over to coat in olive oil. Then let it sit for 2 hours, until it's relaxed and spread out closer to the edges of the pan.",
      "While you're waiting for your dough, prep the toppings by chopping the beet greens (you should end up with ~2 cups) and very thinly slicing the mushrooms. Tear apart the mozzarella in to small pieces. Heat oven to 550 degrees F, or as hot as it will go.",
      "When your dough's done resting/rising (or when you're tired of waiting), use your fingers to push the dough the rest of the way to the sides of the pan. Pop any super big bubbles while you're at it. You can also pick up an edge of the dough to stretch it out before setting it back in the pan, and work your way around the sides that way. Because the dough's gonna be pretty thick all around, I don't bother leaving a lip around the edge.",
      "Now you're ready to top. Take the tomatoes, crush it in your hands (try not to squirt juices everywhere), and spread the flesh and juices around on top of the pizza, all the way to the edge. Sprinkle with salt and black pepper, and some more olive oil if you feel like it. \r\nPlace down a layer of mozz, using up about 2/3 of prepped cheese. \r\nDump the beet greens on top in an even layer, and sprinkle with salt. Add the mushroom slices, if using. Top with the remaining mozzarella. Add one last drizzle of olive oil, making sure each mushroom gets a bit.",

      "Preheat your oven to 375? and place top rack in the middle. Grease an 8 1/2 to 9 inch pie pan with butter (I used a metal pie pan which worked great). Make the filling first. In a medium bowl, whisk together the sugar, cornstarch, cinnamon, and sea salt. Add the berries and using your hands, toss until coated. Add the lemon juice and stir it in. Pour the filling into the prepared pie pan and set aside.",
      "For the crust: combine the flour, cornmeal, sugar, baking powder, and sea salt in a medium bowl and whisk together. Cup up the butter and add it to the mixture. Then, using a pastry blender, a fork, or your fingers, cut the butter into the mix working until the butter cubes are mixed in and broken down into a pea size. Pour in the cream and stir until it's absorbed into the dough and the dough is sticking together.",
      "It's easier to work with this sticky dough in small amounts. Pick up hand-fulls of the dough and flatten them into a biscuit or patty shape and lay them on top of the berry filling in the pie pan. As you lay each disk of dough onto the berries, spread it out a bit. The idea is to top the filling with the dough and spread it around so there are no gaps. You don't need the biscuit shapes to remain after you've laid them on. Once your dough is covering all the berries, sprinkle with the extra 2 tsp. of sugar.",
      "Place the pie pan onto the top rack in the oven with a baking sheet on the rack below to catch the drips. Bake for about 45 min, but start checking it when there are about 5 min. to go. The crust should be golden brown and the juice from the filling is going to be bubbling up from below. When it's ready, take it out and set on a rack to cool for about 10 minutes.",
      "I like to top it with fresh whipped cream, so I would use this time as it's cooling to make the cream or you could serve it with vanilla ice cream. After about 10 min. have gone by, find a serving platter bigger than the pie pan for turning the cobbler upside down. Place the platter upside down over the cobbler and center it. With both hands securely holding the two together, flip them around so the pie pan is now upside down on top of your serving platter. Using a large serving spoon, tap the bottom of the pie pan to help loosen the pan from the cobbler and also run the spoon along the crust edge sticking out from under the pie pan. Ease the pie pan off of the cobbler which has now been transformed into a beautiful blueberry crow's nest! Serve warm with the whipping cream or ice cream and sprinkle with a little cinnamon-sugar."

Stream in about another 1/2 cup, whisking constantly - this will temper the eggs so they won't scramble. Pour the warm, tempered, egg mixture into hot cream. Whisking constantly, simmer until thick and sluggishly bubbly; then cook for about 1 minute more - just to make certain the cornstarch is completely cooked out.",
      "Remove pan from heat and transfer mixture to stand mixer bowl. {note: if your eggs scrambled up a bit, no worries. Use a strainer to catch any mishaps.} Using the whisk attachment, set the mixer to low-medium speed until the bowl is room temperature and mixture is completely cool to the touch. This can take up to 20 minutes. Do not rush the process; mixture must be cool before continuing. If you have extra time, cover the surface of the cream with plastic wrap and refrigerate until ready to proceed - the stand mixer method is much faster.",
      "When pastry cream is completely cool, begin adding the room temp. butter cubes; about 1 Tablespoon at a time, with the mixer set on med-high. Once the butter has been added, repeat process with mascarpone cheese, adding about 1 Tablespoon at a time. {note: the mixture may appear to curdle halfway through adding butter, don't fret, keep mixing + adding...it will smooth out eventually.}",
      "Once all the butter and cheese has been incorporated, add the salt and whip until thoroughly combined. {note: at this point I added about 1/4 cup of blueberry preserves for colour.} You may use the frosting immediately or cover the bowl and refrigerate until needed. If you refrigerate the frosting, bring it to room temperature, then re-whip in stand mixer (using whisk attachment). If frosting is too cold, it will curdle - make sure it's completely reached room temp. before whipping.",
      "Don't be shy when frosting the cake layers; this recipe makes a lot of buttercream! You will more than likely have leftover frosting - which is fabulous on cookies, waffles, and toast! Please note: the frosting is temperature sensitive. If your house is humid, keep the cake in fridge until ready to serve."

      "Combining the dry ingredients. Sift together the buckwheat flour, gluten-free all-purpose flour mix, brown sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl. Set aside the bowl.",
      "Working the butter into the dry ingredients. Add the cold butter pieces to the dry ingredients. Use your hands to work the butter into the flour, slowly, until the butter is the size of lima beans. Move as quickly as you can without becoming frantic.",
      "Finishing the dough. In a small bowl, whisk together the buttermilk and egg. Dribble them into the buttery dough. Stir with a rubber spatula until the dough comes together fairly well. It might still be dry in places and it should not look like a coherent dough ball. However, if you can pinch some of it between your thumb and fingers, and it holds together, you're ready. (If the dough is still too dry, dribble a tablespoon of buttermilk at a time and stir until the dough feels right.)",
      "Shaping the dough into discs. Sprinkle a little extra gluten-free all-purpose flour mix onto the counter. Carefully, plop the dough onto the floured counter. Move the dough between your hands, folding and twisting it around, until it's a ball of dough. Cut the ball in half. Pat each ball of dough into a disc about 3/4-inch thick and 7 inches across.",
      "Preparing the scones. Put one disc of dough onto the baking sheet. Spread the rhubarb jam onto the disc of dough carefully, leaving about 1 inch of space on the edges. If you are using the sugared rhubarb pieces, sprinkle them onto the jam now. Put the other disc of dough on top.",
      "Using a sharp knife, cut the scone dough into 8 wedges. Spread them out a bit on the baking sheet.",
      "Baking the scones. Bake the scones for 10 to 12 minutes, then rotate the baking sheet. Bake until the scones are golden-brown on top and the jam and rhubarb have bubbled onto the baking sheet, about another 10 to 12 minutes. Remove the baking sheet from the oven.",
      "Allow the scones to sit for 10 minutes, then move them to a cooling rack.",
      "Scones really do taste best the day they are baked.",
      "Baking note: Most buckwheat flour sold in this country is the buckwheat grain toasted before being ground into a flour. Sometimes that makes for a slightly burnt taste in the buckwheat. (Also, the Bob's Red Mill flour is made in the gluten-containing facility, making it not safe for celiacs.) I prefer raw buckwheat flour. It's hard to find in stores but easier online. However, if you have a strong blender, you can grind the raw buckwheat groats into flour easily.",
      "Whisk the flours together until they are one color. Put them in a big container and shake them up. Now you have flour.",
      "For the best results, blend the flours in a strong blender to ensure the flours all have the same grind."

Combine salt and sugar in a bowl and mix together...2. Wash/scrub skin of each citrus fruit and towel dry...3. Microplane citrus rind from each fruit...4. Mix citrus rind into salt/sugar thoroughly (salt/sugar mixture should start to take on the color of the citrus rind)...5. Lay one sheet of saran wrap horizontally and one vertically on the counter...6. Spread 1/3 of salt mixture in middle of saran as a base for fish (should be in shape of fish and slightly bigger than the fish)...7. Rinse fish and dry thoroughly...8. Place fish on salt mixture base...9. Cover fish with remaining salt mixture and pack tightly...10. Wrap fish/salt mixture in saran wrap and place in ziploc bag...11. Put fish in refrigerator for required time (based on fish cure recipe)...12. When done curing, unwrap fish and rinse under cold water...13.

      "Ok, when the chicken is at or near done, you can start making your gorditas. In a large bowl, mix the masa harina, water, and 1/4 cup of oil. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and roll into a thick log. How thick? Well that just depends on how big you want your gorditas to be. Mine were about 3-4 inches in diameter (after flattening, so about 2-3 inch thick log). Divide the log into 1 inch slices. I got about 12 gorditas with this, and this was plenty for 3 people.",
      "Flatten each gordita either with a rolling pin, or you could be more rustic and use your hands like I did. Be careful though, the dough will be VERY fragile so you kind of have to be gentle and loving with it.",
      "Heat a large skillet or griddle under high heat and cook gorditas in batches (I found that 3 at a time fit in the pan nicely) for about 2 minutes per side. Set aside on plate as each one is done. When all gorditas are cooked, either wait until skillet gets cool or get out new skillet if you can't wait. Place enough oil in the skillet to bring it about 1/4 inch up the pan. If you do this with the hot skillet, you'll probably burn yourself, so that's why I said to either get a new skillet or wait until the other one cools. It's all about safety first, right? Right.",
      "When oil is hot enough for frying, add the gorditas, in batches again, and fry for about 2 minutes per side, when they're nice and golden. When each is done, press the center with a spoon to kind of make a little indentation. Dry on paper towel-lined plate.",
      "Top the indentations with the shredded chicken, sour cream, salsa, cheese, and whatever else you'd like to top it with. The toppings are really endless."

      "*FYI cutting the tomatoes into 1-inch chunks is meant only to help get the right cup measurement regardless of the size of your tomatoes. If you weigh the tomatoes instead, all you have to do is cut them into a few rough pieces as you add them to the processor. Just one more reason to use a scale! \r\n\r\nYou will also need the following for this recipe:\r\nInstant read thermometer\r\nMedium fine strainer\r\nFood processor fitted with the steel blade\r\nAnd ice pop mold with multiple cavities, or individual cups or containers\r\nIce cream sticks",
      "To make the ice cream base:\r\nSet the strainer over a 6- to 8-cup bowl and set it aside for the finished ice cream base. Find a larger bowl for an ice bath and locate ice cubes in the freezer.",
      "Put the sugar, milk powder, salt, golden syrup, egg, and 1/4 cup of the milk in a 2- to 3-quart saucepan. Whisk until thoroughly blended. Whisk in the remaining milk and the cream (but NOT the sour cream).",
      "Retire the whisk and continue with a heatproof silicon spatula.",
      "Cook the mixture over medium-low heat, stirring with the spatula, and sweeping the bottom, corners, and sides of the pan constantly to avoid scorching, until the mixture registers 178 to 180\u00b0 F on an instant read thermometer. Immediately scrape the mixture into the strainer set over the bowl. Stir in the vanilla extract. Set the bowl in the larger bowl and add water and ice to the larger bowl. Set the whole business in the fridge until the base is cold. Remove the bowl from the ice bath, whisk in the sour cream, and cover airtight. Refrigerate several hours, preferably overnight.",
      "To make the sorbet base:\r\nPuree the tomatoes in the food processor. The mixture will be soupy.",
      "Transfer a generous 1/2 cup of the puree to a saucepan or small skillet. Cook over medium heat, scraping the pan constantly with a silicon spatula to avoid scorching the mixture, until it is reduced and thickened to the consistency of ketchup. Scrape the cooked puree into the processor and pulse to blend. (Anyone who objects to nice textural bits of tomato skin and seeds in the finished sorbet should press the mixture through a medium-fine sieve now, or forever hold your peace).",
      "Taste and add drops of lime or lemon juice to taste and then the tiniest pinch or so of salt. Citrus and salt are just to wake up the tomato flavor, not to make it salty or citrusy. Correct the sugar, too, if necessary, since your tomatoes might not be the same as mine. If you like, grate the zest of half of the orange over the mixture and stir it in. Refrigerate until needed.",
      "Twenty minutes before freezing the ice cream, set the ice cream base in the freezer for an extra-cold start. (If your machine is electric, turn it on to pre-chill for 5 minutes before adding the ice cream base.) Churn according to the instruction with your machine. When the ice cream is ready, you can either work very quickly to fill the molds before the cream melts, or transfer the ice cream to the freezer for 30 minutes so it's a bit more stable to handle before you start filling your molds.",
      "To fill the molds, whisk the tomato mixture (in case it has separated). Starting with the tomato mixture, either alternate several layers of tomato and ice cream or just make two thick layers. Either way, the tomato mixture will ooze up around the spoonfuls of ice cream to make gorgeously variegated Creamsicles. Leave about 1/8 inch at the top of the molds so that the lid will not be hard to remove later. If your mold has a cover with openings for sticks, put it in place and insert sticks. Otherwise, freeze until the mixture is thick enough to hold a stick upright and then insert sticks. Scrape leftover ice cream and tomato into a container. Freeze several hours until hard.",
      "To unmold the pops, cut wax paper pieces large enough to wrap pops individually and spread them on the counter (or a tray). Fill a container with warm (not hot!) water deep enough to dip the full height of your molds. Dip the mold long enough to release a pop when you pull hard on the stick. Pull each pop quickly from the mold and set it on a piece of wax paper. Wrap the pops and put them in a resealable plastic freezer bag. Keep frozen until serving."

Grab an electric mixer and whip the coconut milk fat with about 1 tbsp of agave or honey for about 4-5 minutes or until you see stiff peaks form! It's like magic, you will enjoy it, promise!",

Place the halves on parchment-lined baking sheets - I used two trays so as not to crowd the berries - and bake for ~15 minutes. The berries will exude some juice and soften slightly but maintain their shape (the photo above shows what 1 tray looks like post-roast). Take out of the oven and set aside, and reset the oven temperature to 425F.",
      "While the berries are in the oven, you can start on the crust. In a medium-sized bowl, mix together the all-purpose flour, 1/2 c of the hazelnut meal, 1/2 tsp of the salt, and the tsp of sugar, breaking up any lumps with a spoon or fingers. Melt and brown 1/2 c of the butter over medium-low heat - that is, cook the butter until the milk solids settle out and start to turn golden brown. When the butter is nicely golden (but before it burns), take the pan off the heat and immediately add the cold milk. Pour the butter and milk mixture into the dry ingredients, making sure to scrape all the tasty brown bits out of the pan. Mix until the dry ingredients are no longer dry and you have a homogeneous clumpy mass of tart dough. Set aside.",
      "To make the topping, combine the brown sugar, remaining 1/4 c of hazelnut meal, and 1/4 tsp of salt in a small bowl. Add the last 1 T of butter and work it in with your fingers until the mixture looks like wet sand. Stir in the chopped hazelnuts.",
      "Assemble the tart! Pat the crust into an 11 inch tart pan. It should cover the bottom fully and extend at least most of the way up the sides (in the photo above, I got lazy and didn't stretch it all the way to the top). Try to make it an even thickness. Put the strawberries in the crust (you can arrange them nicely, but they lose definition in the oven so there's not much of a point) and sprinkle the topping over the top. It may look like a lot of topping but I promise it's not too much.",

If using Active Dry Yeast, add it at this time with the other wet ingredients. Using the hook attachment, mix for 5-7 minutes at the lowest speed. The dough should be wet and sticky to the touch. If it is too wet, add a little bread flour; if too dry, add a little more beer. It should be a fairly smooth dough at this stage.",
      "Sprinkle the minced rosemary over the dough and increase the mixer speed to the next highest level and mix for 2 minutes. When you're finished, there are two ways to check and see if the dough is ready for it's first rising: (1) detach the dough hook and pull up on the dough with the hook to see if the dough is very elastic and moves with the hook or if the dough breaks/tears; (2) take a piece of dough the size of 2 large marbles and with your fingers carefully stretch it out pulling on 4 corners of the dough to see if it stretches or tears as you pull on the it. If the dough tears fairly easily in either test, more kneading is necessary. What you're doing in this stage is to develop the gluten, or elasticity of the dough.",
      "Put the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover it and place it someplace warm for the first rising until it doubles in size. This can take 3 to 3 1/2 hours. During this stage of rising, uncover the dough each hour and pull up one side of the dough and fold it over on itself to essentially fold the dough in half. This is done to help build structure in the bread. Tips if you can't find a warm place for the dough to rise: heat a cup of water in the microwave oven to really hot, turn the microwave off and put the bowl of covered dough in the microwave with the cup of water. Or place the covered bowl near the stove if you're cooking, (being careful that it doesn't get too hot!).",

I place a pizza stone in the oven on the rack I plan to use and an empty metal pan in the bottom of the oven. If using the pizza stone, allow time for the oven to be at 450F for about an hour so that the stone is completely preheated.",
      "Score the boules or loaves with an oiled razor blade, spray lightly with water, sprinkle with the fleur de sel and place the baking sheet on top of the pizza stone. The pizza stone will help keep the baking sheet at a constant temperature while the bread bakes. Just before closing the oven door, throw a bunch of ice cubes or cold water into the hot metal pan at the bottom of the oven to create a little steam.",
      "Bake the bread for about 30 minutes. In the first 10 minutes of baking, open the oven door just long enough to squirt some water on the sides of the oven with a squirt bottle. If you don't have one, just get your hands wet and fling the water at the sides of the oven to create steam. Do this 3 times, but not after the first 10 minutes of baking. During the last 5 minutes of baking, open the oven door. A crisper crust is encouraged by shots of steam in the beginning of baking, and by a dry oven at the end.",
      "The bread is ready when it's internal temperature reaches 200F. To check, I pull the boule from the oven and stick a probe into the bottom.",

If necessary, warm the chocolate glaze in a pan of barely simmering water until it is fluid and pourable but not too thin to coat the cake luxuriously. Set the cake on a baking sheet or directly on a serving platter. Pour the sauce over the cake letting it drip over the sides where it may.

Then cut them off completely by following the natural seam under the foreleg. Reserve the forelegs for another use. Starting at the neck end, working with your boning knife against the rib cage, remove the meat from the bone. When you reach the loin area, curve the tip of your knife around the loin until you hit the backbone. Repeat this process down the length of the rib cage until you reach the back legs. Remove the backbone by severing the tip of each vertebra while simultaneously pulling the rib cage away from the rabbit. Take care not to pierce through the meat.

Then, I sort of do a back and forth hand-to-hand motion for a few tosses (kind of like how you'd make a tortilla by hand), then I pat-pat-pat the meat into a flat disc while corralling the edges with my thumb to keep them smooth and uniform. Finally, make a small thumb-sized indentation in the middle of the patty. That way you get a nice patty without over-handling the meat. That is, if you don't drop it.",
      "Prepare the barbecue cheese: Mix the barbecue sauce, cheese, and onions and set it aside. Do not refrigerate (you will be using it shortly and you don't want it to be really cold).",
      "Place the patties on the grill rack and cook, turning once, until they're cooked to your preference, 5 to 7 minutes on each side for medium. In the last 3 minutes of grilling, carefully place equal amounts of the barbecue cheese on each patty. During the last 2 minutes of grilling, place the buns cut side-down, on the outer edges of the rack to toast lightly.",
      "To assemble the burgers, place an equal layer of barbecue kettle chips on each bottom bun. Add a cheese-covered patty on top, followed by a layer of pickles and an equal amount of lettuce. Add the bun tops and serve with an ice-cold beer or a big ol' pitcher of tea.",
      "If you are so inclined, here's my BBQ sauce recipe. Simply mix all of the ingredients together:\r\n1/2 cup ketchup; 2 tablespoons Dijon mustard; 2 to 3 dashes hot sauce (Louisiana style or Tabasco); 4 to 5 drops liquid smoke; 1 tablespoon; chili powder; 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce; 1 tablespoon blackstrap molasses."

      "Once you've piped your circles, you can start on the petals. For this, you'll hold the pastry bag almost straight up and down, with the rounded portion of the tip facing down. Apply gentle pressure to the bag while you bring the tip upward slightly-these petals stand almost straight up. Start the first petal in the center of the circles you piped. Start the next petal right next to the first, and continue all the way around the circle until you've completed a full circle of petals.",
      "Now continue the process by working inward. Continue to pipe petals in the same fashion, working in a circle, until the center of the pie is fully covered.",
      "Next, pipe the outer petals. For this, you'll want to bring the angle of bag a little lower and more parallel to the surface of the pie. Instead of pulling the bag straight up when you pipe, pull it towards the outer edge of the pie a bit. This gives the effect that real flowers often have - they're tighter toward the center, and more open around the outer edge. Continue until the whole pie is covered in petals. If you like, you can torch the tips of the petals to add a little dimension and toasty flavor to your meringue."

      "Saute the onions over a medium flame, stirring very infrequently. Once they soften and begin to brown, return the flame to low and allow to slowly caramelize. During this time, it is important to make sure the onions are spread as evenly as possible across the pan. Every few minutes, scrape the bottom and redistribute the onions so each gains the maximum amount of surface area. The intention is to slowly crisp the onions by enticing the remaining liquids to sweat out, and for the onions to sweeten by condensing in their own juices. If you stir too often, the onions will turn to mush. This process takes about 40 minutes.",
      "In the meantime, place the sweet potatoes in a large pot of salted water and bring to a boil over high heat. Cook until tender and drain.",
      "When the onions are dark brown, but not burnt, add the cumin, paprika, chili powder, cayenne, and season with salt to taste. Set aside.",
      "When it comes to the mashing, use whatever technique your kitchen affords you. I find that the best texture is achieved by using a food mill. A ricer would work as well, or a masher for a coarser result. Once you've mashed your potato mixture, season with 1/2 to 1 tablespoon of salt, adding a dash of cayenne to give it some heat.",
      "Pour into a large baking or casserole dish and spread the onions evenly over the top. of the pan.\r\n\r\nTIP: the dish can be stored in the refrigerator for up to two days before serving. To reheat, set the oven to 250 degrees and place the casserole dish inside 30 minutes or so before the meal."

Stack the pieces of rind in a pile and slice them into the thinnest strips you can manage. If the finished strips are on the long side, cut them in half or thirds (you want them to fit nicely into a spoon for the finished marmalade, not to be pomelo noodles). Set the finished pomelo rind aside in a mixing bowl. Now, cut off the layer of white pith to reveal the colored fruit. Use your knife to remove individual segments from the fruit, leaving behind the bitter membranes. Roughly chop the fruit segments into bite size pieces. Set the prepared fruit pieces aside in the mixing bowl.\r\n\r\nTo prepare the grapefruit:\r\n\r\nUse the same method as described above, using only the outer part of the rind and the segments of fruit. Combine the finished fruit segments and sliced strips of peel with the prepared pomelo in your mixing bowl.\r\n\r\nTo prepare the kumquats:\r\n\r\nSlice off the tip where the stem was attached. Next, slice the kumquat in half. Remove any little seeds. Next, each half of the kumquat into very thin strips. Combine the prepared kumquat with the prepared grapefruit and pomelo.\r\n\r\nTo prepare the lemons and oranges:\r\n\r\nSlice off the blossom and stem end of the fruit. Slice the fruit into quarters. Slice off the pithy center of each quarter, where the membranes join together and the seeds are hiding. Lay out the pieces of fruit so that the skin side is facing you and slice the oranges and lemons into the thinnest pieces you can manage. \r\n\r\nNext:\r\n\r\nCombine the fruit and the water in a nonreactive container and let it sit for 24 hours.",
      "Day 2 (the easy part):\r\n\r\nBring boiling water canner to a boil. Wash jars and lids in hot, soapy water.\r\n\r\nPut the fruit mixture into a large, nonreactive pot. Turn the heat on medium and bring to a simmer. Simmer the fruit for 20 minutes to soften the rinds. Pour in the sugar and stir to combine everything. Turn the heat to high, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the marmalade reads 220 on a candy thermometer or passes whatever gel test you like.\r\n\r\nLadle the hot marmalade into hot jars, leaving 1/4\" headspace.

Start by placing the flour, salt, and sugar in the bowl of a food processor fitted with the S blade. Pulse to combine. Add your solid coconut oil and pulse until mixture is crumbly and will stick together when you squeeze it. Pulse in 1/3 cup water, or until the dough holds together well when you make a handful of it and is visibly starting to come together in the food processor. It's fine to have a lot of crumbs still-that'll make a good, flaky crust-but it should be easy to shape into a large ball, too. If necessary, add a little more water until the texture is right.\r\n\r\nAlternately, you can cut the oil into very small pieces and work them into the flour with bare, dry hands. Add the water and knead the whole mixture together until it has the texture described a moment ago.",

Gingerly lift it onto your pie crust (little tears are fine, and you can fix them later). Squeeze the edges to make a pretty, puckered pattern.

      "Once the garlic and red pepper flakes are married together, add your clam sauce ( I use canned- it is a cheap dinner, right?) and white wine and raise the heat to medium-high.. At this time, you can also add your whole clams ( from a can).Cook it off for about 4-5 minutes. Lower the heat again and add parmesan cheese, parsley and heavy cream (optional). Add your cooked pasta and be sure to add some of the reserved starchy water, it will marry all the ingredients together perfectly. Sprinkle with some additional parsley and parmesan cheese and serve with crostini! Bon apetit!"

      "Start by bringing water to a boil in a smaller saucepan, stir in the rice, and simmer covered until the liquid is absorbed, as you would when making rice regularly, about 15 minutes.",
      "Then, use a heavier pan to dissolve sugar in milk-keep the heat low, and stir often. Add the cooked rice to the milk mixture in the heavier pan and raise the heat to a boil. In another bowl, dissolve the rice flour in 1/4 cup of water, stir in some of the hot milk, and pour this mixture into the simmering milk in a steady stream, constantly stirring. Lower the heat and gently cook the pudding for about 30 minutes, again, stirring constantly. If yours is still looking a little soupy after half an hour, give it as much time as it needs, but resist the urge to turn the heat up. The mixture will slowly thicken to the consistency of a porridge or thick bisque.",
      "After removing the heavy pan from heat, add in the rosewater and stir thoroughly. Your pudding shouldn't be terribly pink, but the rosewater will leave a slight tinge and a beautiful fragrance. Fill your ramekins and dust with cinnamon (or, let guests decide how much cinnamon they want). Refrigerate for at least 2 hours before serving. The mixture will thicken and will become the ideal thick consistency only after being refrigerated."

Using your largest, heaviest knife, hack the bones so all of the pieces can fit into your largest stockpot and some of the bone marrow is exposed. If you have chicken gizzards you want to add, you can; although they may not add a lot, so you could save them for another use too.",
      "In order to remove impurities, you'll first need to parboil the chicken bones. Fill a large stockpot with chicken carcasses and water and bring to a boil. Allow carcasses to boil for 10 minutes and drain. Wash out the pot and add the chicken carcasses back in, fill with water, and add spices, fish sauce, and rock sugar.\r\n\r\nBring to a boil, add chicken breasts, and reduce heat to medium. Allow everything to simmer for 15-20 minutes and remove chicken breasts. Set them aside until you're ready to start assembling, and let the broth simmer, covered for three hours.\r\n\r\nEvery once in a while, skim the surface of the broth with a spoon to remove excess fat. If too much liquid is evaporating, you can add more water, just remember that you'll need to adjust the seasoning in the end.",
      "While your broth is simmering away, check out the directions for preparing your rice noodles, if you can read them. Prepare according to the directions on the package; cooking times can vary greatly. I've used noodles you soak for an hour and others that you soak for five minutes. If you're unsure what to do, the safest bet is to bring a pot of water to a boil, turn the heat off, add the dry noodles and allow to soak. Stir them every now and then, taste for doneness, drain and set aside once they're cooked.",
      "Assemble your accoutrement plate and sauces.",
      "When the broth has simmered for about three hours, strain the broth through a colander or mesh sieve positioned over a large pot. If you want, you can pick over the carcasses for tender pieces of dark meat and put them aside until you're ready to assemble your soup. Otherwise, discard everything but the broth. Skim off any additional fat and taste for seasoning. For more salt, add fish sauce. For more sweetness, a small chunk of rock sugar.",
