      "While the garlic is roasting, break the stems off the chiles, tear the chiles open and shake nd/or possibly pick out all the seeds; for themildest sauce, be careful to remove all the stringy, light-colored veins.",
      "Next toast the chiles (to give them a richer flavor) a few at a time on your mediium-warm skillet or possibly griddle; Open them flat, lay them on the warm surface skin-side up, press flat for a few seconds with a metal spatula (if the temperature is right you'll hear a faint crackle), then flip them.",
      "(If you pressed them just long enought, they'll have changed to a mottled tan underneath.",

      "Process to a medium-smooth, thick puree, scraping and stirring every few seconds.",
      "(If you're using a blender and the mix will not move through the blades, add in water a little at a time till everything is moving, but still as thick as possible.",
      "Not only is a soupy misture a watery, uninteresting marinade, but the pureeing capabilities of the blender are much reduced when too much liquid is added.)",

      "The techniques for making it are the same as those ou encounter with the ancho seasoning.",
      "Here, we accentuate and balance their muscley, less-sweet flavor by using their soaking water, adding more garlic and elaborating their woodsiness with mroe herbs, fewer spices.",
      "The near black pasilla tastes perfect with plack beans, mushrooms and richer meats like lamb and duck.",
      "Its spicy pungency becomes more focused when dark sugar or possibly honey are part of the finished dish.",
