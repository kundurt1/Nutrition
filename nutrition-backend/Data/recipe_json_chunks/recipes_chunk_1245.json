I learned to cook this in a much larger pot than you need so you don't have to use a lid. Covering the sauce/gravy makes it too thin since the condensation can't escape.

As you expand the well, keep pushing the flour up to retain the well shape. Do not worry that this initial phase looks messy. The dough will come together when 1/2 of the flour is incorporated.",

Lightly flour the board and continue kneading for 3 more minutes. The dough should be elastic and a little sticky. Continue to knead for another 3 minutes, remembering to dust your board when necessary. Wrap the dough in plastic and allow to rest for 30 minutes at room temperature.

      "Now we wait should take about 4 hours on high or 8 hours on low in the crockpot. In the oven should take about 5 hours you could shave that time down by raising the heat but I wouldn't it's worth the wait, if you decide to up the heat don't go past 325 degrees Fahrenheit.",
      "Trick time the thing that makes for getting this right isn't waiting a certain amount of time. You will know it is done when you can grab the bone in the center of the pork butt and when you give it a twist I comes right out of the meat easy and clean. That's all you need to know not to every under or over cook a pork but again.",
      "When the bone comes out clean remove the meat from the crock pot/ Dutch oven/ roaster and wrap up tight in foil to rest for at least half an hour and you can comfortably handle the pork bare handed. This is the time to shred the pork.",

Throw this on a good roll and skip the BBQ sauce instead throw some Pico De Gallo and some avocado on top."

      "Bring a medium pan of water to a rolling boil over medium-high heat. Lower the eggs into the water -- I use my handy wire egg sieve for this maneuver -- and simmer for exactly 8 minutes (7 and a half for golden yellow yolkeyness, and 9 if you don't want a soft center in your yolk).",
      "When the timer goes off, lift the eggs out of the water with a slotted spoon (again, I use my wire egg sieve) and put them in the bowl of ice water; this will halt the cooking.",
      "When the eggs are cold -- this will take just a couple of minutes -- tap them gently on the counter to crack their shell all around, and return to the bowl a few more minutes: the water will infiltrate the eggs beneath the shell and make them easier to peel. (Also, when peeling the eggs, notice that there is a thin skin between the white and the shell; once found and ruptured, that skin provides good leverage to peel off the shell.).",
      "Keep the eggs in the fridge and eat within a day or two."

In a small mixing bowl, or personally -- I like a small tupperware container, just add everything and shake, but a mixing bowl works good. Add the marmalade, vinegar, garlic, olive oil, chives, thyme, salt and pepper. Mix well and set to the side. It is even better made a few hours ahead, but it isn't necessary.",
      "Beets -- I make the beets all in one pan, but if you prefer to roast them in the oven first and then saute, that will work fine. I find it just as easy to fill a small sauce pan with water and add the beets. Make sure the water covers the beets. Cover and cook on medium low heat for approximately 20-30 minutes until tender but still firm. Remember, these will be peeled, diced and finished in a saute pan, so make sure they are tender, but a bit underdone - you don't want them falling apart.",
      "Relish -- As the beets cook, make the relish. To a small bowl, add the chopped oranges, fennel, onion, mandarin orange juice, olive oil, red pepper flakes, thyme, salt and pepper. Slightly chill before serving.",
      "Beets -- Once the beets are done, remove from the pan and let cool until you can handle them. The peel will slide right off. Don't run them under water, just slide the peel off with your hands. I do use gloves as your hands will turn red. You can also put the beet in a small baggie and rub the outside of the baggie and that also works pretty good or use the back of a spoon, that is another trick. Then cut the beets in bite size wedges, not too small.",
      "Saute -- In the same pan, dump out any remaining water, add the olive oil and butter and bring to medium high heat. Add the beets and saute, 3-5 minutes until fork tender. That is why you didn't cook them all the way in the water. You don't want them falling apart. The last minute add in the vinaigrette and heat until warm. I usually use about 1/2 of the vinaigrette, but use as much as you want too. I start slow as the beets will absorb some of the sauce. The leftover vinaigrette is great on other salads or vegetables.",
      "Serve -- Serve over a bed of your favorite greens, or you can just serve as is. Top with the onion, fennel and orange relish. Garnish with some of the orange segments if you want and ENJOY!",

      "On a flat surface, douse some whole wheat flour on the area to keep the dough from sticking. Douse the rolling pin with flour as well.",
      "Take one dough ball from the bowl and using the rolling pin, roll out the dough into a round shape, doing it as flat as possible. The round roti dough should be rolled out as thin as possible but without any holes. If you mess up, add a few drops of water and re-roll and start over again. The shape is not as important as is making it as thin and even as possible in consistency.",
      "After rolling out all of the dough balls begin the step of cooking the bread. Turn the gas oven on at HIGH. Let the skillet get nice and hot.",
      "Place one flat and round roti on the skillet. Let it heat up until the edges start to rise over the surface. Quickly flip the roti using a tong to prevent finger burns.",
      "When the other side appears to have small bubbles or bumps, then quickly lift it with the tong. Moving the skillet or using a second burner on HIGH, place the roti directly on the fire. It will puff up into a ball.",
      "After a few seconds, flip the roti over the flame to cook the other side. Try to avoid it from catching on fire and apply it evenly. This part goes very quickly.",
      "Place the hot roti in a warming plate or tortilla basket. Put a lid over it to keep it hot.",
      "Repeat the above steps to make the remaining rotis.",
      "When re-heating rotis be sure to add a splash of water on both sides before microwaving. It will keep the bread from becoming hard. Roti is best served when hot and before serving they should be covered at all times as they are very delicate breads.",
      "Finally, always remember to add a splash of water to your dough if it seems to be drying out or not shaping as it should. When the bread is rolled thinnest, it tastes best. Practice is key and caution should be used with open flames. Opening windows and turning on the oven fan at high will help circulate the air and keep out a burning smell."

      "3) Make the brine in a large non-reactive pot (stainless, ceramic, porcelain, or glass). You can make it days in advance and keep it chilled if you wish. Add the hot water to a one cup measuring cup. Then pour in salt, any salt, until the water line reaches 3/4 cup. The water will swallow up almost exactly 1/4 pound regardless of whether you use table salt, kosher salt, pickling salt, or sea salt. The volume of these salts may differ, but their water displacement will be the same! Pour the slurry into a very clean non-reactive container large enough to hold the meat and 1/2 gallon of water. Then add the sugar, garlic, and black pepper. Stir until most of the sugar is dissolved. The garlic and pepper will not dissolve much at first. Then add the cold water.",
      "4) Chose your brining container carefully. It needs to be food grade, large enough to hold the meat and the brine with the meat submerged, and it cannot be made of aluminum, copper, or cast iron, all of which can react with the salt. Do not use garbage bags or a garbage can or a bucket from Home Depot. They are not food grade. Do not use a styrofoam cooler. It might give the meat an off flavor and you'll never get the cooler clean when you're done.",
      "Zipper bags work fine. For large cuts get Reynolds Brining Bags, Ziploc XL, and XXL bags. If you brine in a zipper bag, periodically grab the bag and squish things around and flip the meat so the brine can get in from all sides. Place the bag in a roasting pan to catch leaks. You can also use bowls, pots, and Tupperware.",
      "Submerge the fish skin side up in the brine and refrigerate. Make sure the meat part is thoroughly submerged. If you need to, hold it under with a plate with a weight on top. Cover with plastic wrap not aluminum foil. Gently stir the container occasionally to make sure all parts of the fish come into contact with the brine.",
      "5) The length of brining will vary depending on how thick the filets are. Brine 2\" thick filets for about 2 hours in the fridge, 1\" filets for 1 hour. Drain the fish and discard the brine. Then rinse the fish to remove surface salt, and soak them in clear water for about an hour. This helps get rid of excess salt. Pat dry with paper towels. Some folks like to put the filets in the fridge for an up to 3 hours under the theory that a desirable shiny tacky film or pellicle will form on the surface. It is said to help retain moisture and smoke. I have tried it with and without pellicle and see no quality difference. But a few hours of resting will help the brine to distribute itself evenly through the flesh.",
      "6) Cut pieces of paper bag or plain white paper about the same size as each hunk of fish and place the fish on the paper, skin side down. Don't use foil or parchment paper. We want the fish to stick to the paper to help us remove the skin, and it will not stick to foil or parchment. If you are glazing, sprinkle some brown sugar on top of the fillets or paint them with maple syrup. Place the fish on a rack on your grill or smoker so they are not touching each other. Insert a digital thermometer temperature probe into the thickest part of the thickest fillet.",
      "7) Put the fish into a preheated smoker at about 225\u00b0F and place the fillet with the probe in the coolest part of the smoker. Add the wood.",
      "8) As the meat approaches doneness, bubbles of milky liquid will often come to the surface. This is a natural protein liquid from within the muscle fibers and it's fine. It just looks ugly. You can wipe it off or brush it off with a wet brush. Remove the meat when it is at about 140\u00b0F internal. No more than 150\u00b0F. Total cooking time will be about 60 minutes depending on the actual temperature of your oven and the thickness of the meat.",
      "9) Remove the fillets and let them cool for about 15 minutes, until you can handle them. Then peel off the paper and the skins should come right off with it. While you are looking at the skin side, if there is any dark brown flesh, scrape it off with a serrated steak knife and discard it. It can taste muddy."

      "Your chili paste will use whatever kinds and heat-scale of chiles that you like. The paste I make, my own self, uses mostly ancho chiles, a large, juicy, dark purple pod that came from in New Mexico on Earth That Was. I like the mild heat and smoky flavor. The guajillo peppers are good for that, too. Sometimes I add some chipotle or cascabel , or for extra heat. Other folks who like Earth That Was Chinese often use tien tsin peppers, or for Indian use sanaam or dundicuts. Of course, the fun part is coming up with your own combination that's perfect for you.",
      "Okay, first off, remember that you're going to be handling chile peppers. They're hot. It's up to you whether or not you get some gloves from the medic to do the job of keeping your hands covered, but I can tell you from experience that without them... forgetting about having made chili paste and rubbing your eyes or other sensitive nether parts later on can be painful. My own self, I wear the gloves.",
      "Let's do this thing! Go ahead and weigh out 6 ounces of your choice of dried chiles. Remove the stems and all the seeds and discard them.",
      "Put the cleaned chiles into a galley bowl and pour boiling water over them until they're covered. Let 'em soak for 30 minutes.",
      "Drain the water from the chiles (you can keep the water and use it with your noodles, iffen you like).",
      "Find the food processor or food mill in the galley and put the soaked chiles in there, then puree them thoroughly. If you use a processor, press the resulting puree through a sieve to get a totally smooth paste. If you use a mill, it'll come out as a smooth paste from that. You'll have about 1 1/2 cups of chili paste.",
      "Get yourself a clean jar with a tight lid that's large enough and put the paste into it, then pour some vegetable oil over so that there's a couple of centimeters oil on top of the paste. The oil helps preserve the paste and it'll keep several months in the fridge this way. Without the oil, it'll keep for about 14 days.",
      "There, now you've got yourself your own Heat. Experiment with different kinds of dried chiles you find in port, and enjoy!",

Pick all the meat up out of the bowl and throw it down -with force- back into the bowl about 20 times, kneading it after each throw.

      "If you are using dry shiitake, soak them at least 30 minutes in water to return them to fresh state. Boil the bamboo shoots for 1 minute, then drain to get rid of the smell. Chop the meat, shiitake, bamboo shoots and leek thinly.Add a little oil to the pan and fry the meat until it changes colour. Then add the chopped ingredients from step one, stirring, add a pinch of salt and pepper and the sugar. Add the soy sauce and sesame oil. In a separate bowl, add 2tbs potato starch to 2tbs water (make sure it's cold water!) and mix. Then add to the frying pan, mix and heat through until sticky. Leave to cool - if you have time, place in the fridge. When you deep fry the rolls, they's less chance of them exploding if the insides are cold.Mix 1tbs flour and 1tbs water well to create a glue. Then add a small portion of the meat mix to a sheet of the spring roll paper, which should be lying at an angle, like a diamond. Then follow the folding steps as above, using the glue on the tip of your finger to seal it at the final stage.Heat oil to roughly 180 degrees and start frying the rolls carefully until golden. Then lay out on kitchen paper to let the oil soak up before serving. If you have spring rolls sheets left over, you can add tuna, ham, cheese or any other filling. Another idea is to cut up the sheets thinly, then deep fry them and put in salads to give some crunch.",

Set the saucepan over low heat and continue to stir gently until the sugar dissolves. Clip a candy thermometer to the side of the pan, making sure the bulb of the thermometer is immersed in the syrup.

Spray a sharp knife with nonstick cooking spray and cut the bars into twenty-four 3-by-1 1/2-inch rectangles and place on the prepared baking sheet. Refrigerate until ready to assemble.",
      "Assemble the bars: Melt both chocolates together in the bowl of a double boiler over medium heat or in the microwave (in a microwave-safe bowl, cook the chocolate at 50% power (medium) for 15-seconds bursts, stirring between each blast, until melted).",

Once set, squeeze the chocolate into one corner of the zippered plastic bag and twist the other end of the bag a few times to form a makeshift pastry bag. Use a kitchen scissor to snip off the small corner of the bag where the chocolate has collected (you don't want too large a snip or the chocolate will ooze out).",
      "Working quickly, drizzle the chocolate in a zigzag pattern across all of the bars. Place the pan of bars back into the refrigerator for 15 minutes to let the chocolate set up. Serve immediately. The bars can be stored in the refrigerator, tightly covered, for up to 4 days. They taste really good directly from the refrigerator as well as at room temperature-entirely up to you."
