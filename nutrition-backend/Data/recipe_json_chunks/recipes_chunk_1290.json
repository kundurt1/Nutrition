THE SECRET: cover with upside down disposable aluminum cake pans, pie plates or another shallow pan that you can toss or use over but will not be pretty again. (this keeps the moisture from the fish circulating around it and the mayo or butter adds flavor and drips onto the grates/coals and creates the FLAVOR, which rises up back under the pan and into the fish. Depending on thickness of fish, cook 3-5 minutes. Turn over, more lemon, butter or mayo again, seasoning (barely) . Cover again with pan(s) and cook another 2-4 minutes, until flaky or center is no longer pink or raw when you cut into it. Serve immediately - with rice and veggies of your choice.

      "Put the milk and butter for the dough into a small pan and heat over medium until the butter has melted, then turn up and bring to the boil and scald. Pour into a bowl and pop into the fridge to cool, which may take some time. Crush the cardamon pods with the side of a knife and remove the seeds, then finely grind the seeds. Combine the flour, sugar, salt, cardamon in a mixer bowl and stir. Add the yeast and stir to combine. Beat the egg lightly in a bowl. Then, once the milk in the refrigerator has cooled to body temperature, add it to the bowl along with the egg. Stir until you have a shaggy dough. Put the bowl on a stand mixer and knead with the dough hook for 4 to 5 minutes, until the dough comes away from the sides and passes the windowpane test. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and leave to rise for roughly 45 to 75 minutes, until the dough has doubled in size. (You can also leave it in the fridge overnight.) Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and roll out into a 16 x 12-inch (30 x 40-centimeter) rectangle. Beat the soft butter, sugar, cinnamon and salt together with a spoon. Spread the mixture all over the dough. Roll the dough up from the long side, then use a serrated knife to split it in half lengthways. Transfer to a sheet of baking parchment. Weave the two strands together with the cut side up. Bring the ends together, then weave together to make a ring and press the two loose ends together. Cover with cling film and leave to rise for about 30 minutes until puffy -- if you press it with a finger, it should make a dent. (You can also place into the fridge overnight to rise slowly -- take out to warm up ten minutes before baking.) While it rises, preheat the oven to 350\u00b0 F (180 \u00b0C). Use the parchment to shift the ring onto a tray. Put into the oven and bake for ten minutes, then reduce the temperature to 320\u00b0 F (160\u00b0 C). Bake for 30 to 40 minutes more until the ring has risen, turned a deep brown, and sounds hollow when knocked."

Cook for 7 hours on low or until meat easily sperates with a fork and pulls off of the bone. Pour juice from roast in a container and set aside. Shread the meat with two forks. Once shreaded, add a full bottle of BBQ sauce, cover, and turn slow cooker back on low for 30 minutes. Heat rolls as directed on package and make into sandwhiches with pork.

      "Mix olive oil, soy sauce, herbs, and salt together. Place in a zipper bag or a marinator (I use the vacuum marinator by Vacu-Vin) Put in salmon and marinate for several hours in refrigerator, (1 hour if using frozen thawed fish). Approxiamtely one hour before serving time, turn on oven to 375 degrees F. When oven is heated, put in Cedar plank (oven style, I got mine at gillandfin.com) and heat for 20 minutes. Place marinated salmon in the recessed trough on the plank, drain the marinade through a strainer, discarding liquid, and spread the herbs over the top of the fish. Cooking time will be from 15 to 30 minutes or more, depending on the thickness of the salmon. This is best cooked medium rare to medium."

Simmer the noodles for 1 1/2 to 2 minutes, until they bunch up to one side of the pot. With a spider or tongs, carefully transfer the noodles to the ice-water bath. Once cool, transfer to a colander and let drain. Repeat with the remaining dough, replacing the ice water as needed. When all the noodles have been cooked and cooled, rinse the noodles under cold running water to remove excess starch. Drain the noodles. The noodles are best used the same day they are made, but they can be covered and refrigerated for up to 1 day."

Stir another couple of minutes and reduce heat if necessary to prevent any burning. Now begin adding broth. Start with 2 ladle fulls and stir constantly until all liquid is absorbed. Repeat this process of slowly adding liquid and stirring until rice is tender (about 20 minutes). Add the blue cheese and stir till melted. In a separate pan, melt the 2nd Tbsp of butter over medium heat and add the almonds. Stir almonds around to coat and toast for 4-5 minutes just until fragrant. Add almonds to Risotto. Check your seasoning and consistency. Feel free to add more liquid if it's not creamy enough for you or if the rice is a little more al dente than you prefer.
