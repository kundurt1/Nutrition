    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "Day 1, Morning: Take the 1/2 pound of lemons and cut them into eighths. Place these in a non-reactive saucepan where they will fit snugly in a single layer. Add enough cold water for the fruit to bob freely. Cover tightly and let rest for 8 hours at room temperature.",
      "Day 1, Afternoon: After 8 hours have passed, bring the pan with the lemon eighths and water to a boil over high heat, then decrease the heat to medium-low. Cook the fruit at a lively simmer, covered, for 2 hours - the lemons will become very soft and the liquid will become slightly syrupy. As the lemons cook, press down on them gently with a spoon every 30 minutes or so, adding a little more water if necessary. The water level should remain consistently high enough for the fruit to remain fully submerged as it cooks.",
      "When the lemons are finished cooking, strain their juice by pouring the hot fruit and liquid into a fine mesh strainer or jelly bag set over a medium bowl. Cover the whole setup with plastic wrap and let drip overnight at room temperature.",
      "Meanwhile, prepare the Meyer lemon slices.",
      "To prepare the Meyer lemon slices: take the pound of Meyer lemons and halve them lengthwise, then cut each half into quarters (each lemon will be cut into 8 pieces at this point). Take each lemon slice and pry out any seeds from it. You can place these seeds in the pot with the lemon eighths and water which is currently simmering - this will add more pectin.",
      "Slice each Meyer lemon slice thinly crosswise - how thick you slice is a personal preference. I prefer to slice very thinly, making each slice 1/8th of an inch or less. But if you like you could make your slices thicker. I wouldn't recommend going much thicker than 1/4 of an inch.",
      "Place these Meyer lemon slices (they will look like a lot of little triangles) in a stainless steel pot and cover with water, covering the slices by 1 inch. Bring to a boil over high heat, then decrease the heat to medium and simmer for 5 minutes. Drain, discarding the liquid. Return the lemon slices to the pot and cover with 1 inch of cold water. Bring to a boil over high heat, decrease the heat to medium-low, and cook at a lively simmer, covered, for 20 minutes. As the fruit cooks, stir it gently every 10 minutes or so, adding a little more water if necessary. The water level should stay consistently high enough for the fruit to remain submerged as it cooks. After 20 minutes, remove the pan from the heat, cover tightly, and let rest overnight at room temperature.",
      "Day 2, Morning: Remove the plastic wrap from the lemon eighths and their liquid and discard the lemons remaining in the strainer or jelly bag. Do not squeeze the bag or press down on the lemons if you want a clear jelly in your marmalade. Set this liquid aside.",
      "Pour the Meyer lemon slices and their liquid through a fine mesh strainer (or a jelly bag), and let this mixture drip for about 15 minutes. Remove the Meyer lemon slices from the strainer - DO NOT DISCARD - set them aside. Mix the cooked liquid you have strained from the lemon eighths and the Meyer lemons, mixing well, and set aside. You will need 4 1/2 cups of this liquid. If you do not have 4 1/2 cups, add water to the mixture until it equals 4 1/2 cups.",
      "In a large preserving pan, combine the blueberries with 1 1/2 cups of sugar. I use a potato masher to mash up some of the blueberries, about a third of them, but you don't have to do this. I just feel that it gets the juices flowing quicker. Bring the blueberries and sugar to a simmer, stirring frequently, and then continue to cook until the juices are just deep enough to cover the berries, about 5 minutes.",
      "Pour the berries into a colander set over a large bowl, and stir the berries gently to drain off the juice. Set the colander of berries on a plate (to catch any remaining juice) and set them aside.",
      "In a large preserving pan, combine the 4 1/2 cups of mixed liquid from the lemons, the juice from the blueberries, and the Meyer lemon slices. If you do not have a preserving pan, use the widest pan you have. The wider the pan, the more quickly moisture will evaporate from the mixture, and this is what you want when you are making jelly, jam, or marmalade.",
      "Place 4 saucers or small plates in the freezer. You will use these later to check the set of the marmalade.",
      "Bring the mixture to a boil over high heat, and cook at a rapid boil over high heat until the mixture is reduced by half, stirring occasionally. It will take about 35 minutes for the mixture to reduce by half.",
      "Once the mixture is reduced by half, add in the blueberries and any accumulated juice, the strained lemon juice, and the remaining 4 cups sugar, stirring well over high heat to help dissolve the sugar.",
      "Cook at a boil over high heat, stirring every 2 minutes or so, until the set point is reached. Check the set after 5 minutes of cooking.",
      "To check the set: take the pot of marmalade off the heat (if you don't remove the marmalade from the heat while you check the set it could over-cook and become rubbery or hard, if the marmalade is indeed already set).",
      "Place a drop of the marmalade mixture (try to get the \"jelly\" part of the mixture, avoiding the rind and the berries; I use a 1/4 teaspoon measure to dip out the drop) on one of the saucers you've kept in the freezer, & place the saucer back in the freezer for 1 minute. After 1 minute, take the saucer out of the freezer and nudge the drop of jelly with your finger. If it \"wrinkles\" when you nudge it with your finger it is done. If the jelly is not set, continue cooking over medium-high heat, checking the set again every 5 minutes.",
      "I make this marmalade using an 11 quart copper preserving pan, over highest heat on my second largest burner. After the sugar has been added and has dissolved, it usually takes 10 minutes of cooking for the marmalade to reach the set point for me.",
      "When the marmalade is set, ladle it into sterilized canning jars, leaving 1/4\" headspace. Wipe the rims of the jars with damp paper towels to remove any marmalade which got on the rims or the threads. Place the lids and the bands on the jars, just tightening the bands fingertip tight.",
      "Process in a boiling water bath for 5 minutes, then remove and let sit, undisturbed, for at least 12 hours before checking seals. It is important to let them sit undisturbed for 12 hours because the sealing compound on the lids is still cooling and hardening, completing the seal. While the jars cool, you will hear a \"plink\" type sound from each jar - this is the jars completing the vacuum seal as the final air escapes the jar. After 12 hours have passed, remove the bands and check the lids - press down in the center of the lid. If you cannot push the lid down any further, the jar is sealed. If the lid \"gives\" a bit, and you can push it down, the jar did not seal. You can either put the band back on the jar, and reprocess it for another 5 minutes, or you can just put it in the fridge and use it within 3 months."

(For the wood chips - I recommend apple, oak, or hickory.). Close the lid and wait until the wood chis are smoking. Put the \"rib cage\" spit on the rotisserie of your grill. Half close the lid, I use a wrench as a spacer). Turn off the bottom burners, turn on the rotisserie motor. Try to regulate the temperature to about 230F, by adjusting the lid's opening, and the back burner's temperature (low to medium low). Let it spin for 4-5 hours, until the meat has shrunken away from the bone a bit and they are drop-dead tender and mouthwatering, then cut them free from the cage and enjoy.",

      "3. Drop into hot chicken broth. Boil for 15 minutes.",
      "My Note: I usually add 2 tablespoons of milk along with the lightly beaten egg.",
      "I grew up with. My family is a homemade noodle family from at least 4 generations I am aware of. To make this recipe for a family of 4, I use 5 eggs, mix in enough flour to form a dough. Then I put the dough on a well floured counter, mix in enough flour to keep the dough from being sticky. I roll it out paper thin, in a circle. I cut the circle in half, put the right half on the left half, then cut it again. I then have a pie shaped piece of dough that is 4 layers thick, I roll it up jelly roll fashion, cut the noodles in thin strips. I shake the flour out of the little pinwheels, and place them on a cookie sheet. I set them aside to dry a little. (I never let them dry all the way, because generally they are made when I need them) Boil your broth, place a few noodles in the broth at a time, stir to keep them from sticking together. Pick the meat off the chickena, add at the very end. We serve this over mashed potatoes. This is a tradition that is almost religious in my family. Thank you for trying to put a recipe out here. It is not easy for people that have not seen the process. I am afraid it might be a dying tradition. We just spent a weekend with my nieces teaching them all to make noodles, the youngest was 6, she rolled and cut and did a fine job. Keep practicing if you have trouble, it is well worth the effort. There is really nothing wrong with this recipe. I never add any liquid to my noodles, I am 81 and have been making them. At home or my mom home town local cooks are judged by the quality of their noodles. The only problem I see with my recipe here is that there is not enough liquid. Try this: 3 egg yolks 1 egg beat until light 1 teaspoons salt 3 tblsp. half and half (or milk) beat again 2 cups flour This is a perfect dough for noodles. If you need more liquid, add egg yolks or half and half until it is the desired consistency. Noodles are weather sensitive, so don't be afraid to add more liquid or flour if needed. Hope this helps. Some time one thing I do differently is add a few drops of yellow food coloring to the beaten egg for a little more yellow color and then after they are dried I use a pizza cutter to cut the noodles - I think it is much easier than a knife! Will that it, now it is my nap time."

So, you can take a shortcut by using the dough blade in your food processor and putting the WARM dough (do while dough ball from pan is still luke warm but not hot), place dough ball into the processor bowl and using your dough blade beat each egg into the dough in your food processor until the dough loses its glossiness from the egg.

The cookies and pie filling can be made the day before baking the pies for best results.",
      "Place 1/4 cup of the all purpose flour and the crystallized ginger in either a food processor or blender, and process until the ginger is finely chopped. Transfer the flour/ginger mixture to a medium size mixing bowl, and whisk together with the rest of the flour, salt, baking soda, and spices. Set aside.",

Use the cookie stamps to cut out as many shapes as you can. You may need to dip the stamps into a little flour every so often to keep them from sticking to the dough. Transfer the cutouts to a parchment lined baking sheet, placing them about 2 inches apart. Transfer the baking sheet to the freezer for 10 minutes.",

You can continue to roll out the extra dough scraps, between the parchment paper, and cut them out until all of the first disk of dough is used up. Just make sure to chill and sprinkle with sugar before baking, as you did with the first batch.",
      "Roll out the second disk of dough just like the first. Cut two elongated triangles, for ears, out of the card stock paper, and place them on top of the dough. Use the knife to carefully cut 5 sets of ears out of the dough. Transfer to a parchment lined baking sheet. Cut shapes out of the rest of the dough. Chill and bake as you did previously.",
      "To make the pie filling, in a medium mixing bowl whisk together the spices, salt, and sugar. In a small mixing bowl beat tougher the pumpkin, eggs, and cream. Stir the wet ingredients into the dry. Cover and refrigerate.",
      "Once the cookies are fully cooled it's time to make the crust! Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Transfer about 35-40 cookies to a food processor, and process until you have a sand like texture. Place the crumbs in a medium bow, and stir them together with the melted butter.",
      "Divide the crust evenly among the pie tins (about 4-5 tablespoons each), and firmly press the crust into the bottom and up the sides of each. Transfer the pie tins to a baking sheet, and bake for 5-8 minutes or just until they begin to brown.",
      "Allow the pie crusts to cool for at least 15 minutes before adding the filling. Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until the sides of the pie are set and the filling is still slightly jiggly.",

      "To make the chocolate details, place the chocolate chips and coconut oil in a heatproof bowl and microwave in 30 second intervals (at 50% power), stirring between each interval, until smooth and melted.",
      "Use a toothpick dipped into the melted chocolate to draw the sleepy eyes and oval noses onto wax paper. You can also draw the face design first and place the drawing under the wax paper as a guide. Allow to set.",
      "Decorate just before serving. Transfer the whipped cream to a piping bag fitted with your larger round tip (I used the #10 for this). Use a toothpick to draw where you want to pipe the whipped cream onto each pie. Fill in the areas, and use the back of a spoon to slightly smooth out the whipped cream. Change out the piping tip to the smaller size (I used #2), and press and release on the sides of each cheek to create the whiskers.",
      "Add the chocolate pieces, cookies ears, and any other cookies for decorations that you would like to each pie. I used a star tip to create some whipped cream swirls, and then topped with the leaf and pumpkin cookies. Enjoy! The pies will keep for 3-4 days covered and refrigerated, and for 1 month frozen. There will be extra cookies, I like to serve the pies along with a plate full of the cookies to enjoy with coffee. You can also freeze them to eat later."

      "2. In a medium bowl, stir together the cake mix, vanilla pudding mix, and butterscotch pudding mix. Add the eggs, oil and water, mix until well blended. In another bowl, stir together the brown sugar, cinnamon and nuts. Pour half of the batter into the pan, spread evenly. Sprinkle with half of the nut mixture. Cover with the rest of the batter, and sprinkle with the rest of the nut mixture.",
      "3. Bake for 20 minutes in the preheated oven, then turn the oven down to 325*F. and bake for an additional 35 to 40 minutes.",
      "My Note: The cake batter takes only five or ten minutes to whip up and seems pretty forgiving. Though the recipe calls for one vanilla pudding mix and one butterscotch pudding mix, I've never used the butterscotch (since I never have any in the cupboard!). Instead, I've used two vanilla mixes or one vanilla and one chocolate mix. Either way, the cake has always turned out great. Also, for a little extra flavor dimension, I've added a couple tablespoons of espresso or instant coffee to the water. The addition of coffee gives the cake a nice, subtle bite--and makes it into a true 'coffee cake.' Overall, this is a moist, yummy recipe that my family members always ask for. And because it's so easy to make, this would be a great cake for beginning bakers.",
      "For optional icing/toping, I put 1/2C powdered sugar and 1T of milk in a ziplock bag, cut off corner, and pour over. Looks real pretty and it's only enough to zig zag over. DEFINITELY take the advice of using Duncan Hines cake mix (white or yellow) or one that doesn't already have pudding in it. My oven is fast, and I still had to bake for 45 min at 325*F., so definitely check with toothpick! Also, you can use 2 pkgs of vanilla INSTANT pudding or 1 of cream cheese if you don't have butterstotch. I think putting 1/3 off batter, 1/3 off brown sugar mix, 1/3 batter, 1/3 brown sugar mix, then last of batter, last of brown sugar mix is the best. It VISUALLY looks prettier when you cut it (again, see pic), and it also isn't too overwhelming. Plus, any more layers then you don't get to taste the brown sugar mix and that's the best part right? I never put nuts b/c the kids don't like it, but if I did -- I'd use pecans.",
      "To made this recipe LOW-FAT and it was INCREDIBLE! Seriously, it is the best coffee cake and SO moist! Instead of oil I use half a cup of apple sauce, and half a cup of apple butter. I sware you'll never know it's low-fat. I made it in a bundt pan, and layered it as follows: 1. batter 2. cinnamon mixture 3. semi-sweet chocolate chips 4. batter 5. cinnamon mixture 6. semi-sweet chocolate chips 7. batter 8. cinnamon mixture. I promise you will not be disappointed!",
      "Since this cake adds 2 pkgs of pudding, use a cake mix that does not already have pudding in the mix. Duncan Hines is the only one I know of that doesn't have pudding added.",
      "I substituted a box of instant cheesecake pudding for the butterscotch pudding and 3/4 Cup of apple butter for the oil. I also skip the nuts, as some of us can't have them."
