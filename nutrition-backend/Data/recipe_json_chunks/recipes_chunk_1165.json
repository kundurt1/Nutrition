      "Put the two cups of berries in the mason jar and cover with water, rinse to remove any dust.",

      "Put the jar on a 45 degree angle making sure that the berries are still covered with the filtered water, but don't let the water or berries touch the lid of the jar.",
      "Let them soak over night. In the morning, repeat the rinsing process.",
      "Do this until you see little white tails appear at the end of the berries. This means they have sprouted. Usually the second day is when they appear.",
      "Pour the water off your seeds you've soaked and set aside.",

      "You don't want these things to get chopped up too fine. If you add dried fruit it might be good to put them in the mixer fairly big before pulsing, that way they will chop a little smaller but still be recognizable.",
      "Form the essene into a loaf, no more then 1 1/2 inches high. Put the essene on a flat plate on a piece of oiled parchment paper and dehydrate. Then, for the last few hours, flip the bread over and dry the other side.",

      "You can set it in your oven on low as well. Make sure you leave the oven door ajar for about 8-10 hours.",

      "I put all of the Spanish Rice ingredients in my rice cooker and press the button - that's it. For anybody who hasn't discovered the absolute glory of rice cookers - you can do the same thing on a stovetop - and in either case you may need to add extra water - make sure to check after about 30 minutes. Keep in mind that whole grain rice can take nearly an hour to cook.",
      "The Orange Puree seems like a pain but is not hard. I do it about once a week - cut up the carrots into 1 or 1/2 inch pieces, and slice up the yam - then stick that in a steamer for 20 minutes or so. If you don't have any steamer, you can boil them for a similar amount of time - maybe less - but I haven't tried boiling.",
      "Make sure the carrots and yam are plenty softened, then put them in your food processor (better than a blender, although it can get the job done) - put at least 5 or 6 tablespoons of water - and puree until smooth. The Sneaky Chef lady says you only need 2 or 3 tablespoons - but I think it's better with a bit more.",
      "This gets you maybe 2 cups of puree - which I freeze in 1/2 cup containers. I take 1 out every few days or so, and it's good for 2 to 3 days once you put it in the fridge. One day I forgot to thaw some out - and my son wanted his rice - so I chipped away at the frozen stuff and put it in the stovetop rice mix, and it worked out fine.",
      "Then for the final product! Put around 1 cup of the Spanish Rice into a pan with 1 tablespoon of butter, and 2 or 3 tablespoons of the Orange Puree (tablespoons can be heaping or not depending on how much of that sweet/carrot flavor you want). Add the cheese - I put around 3 oz or so - and heat up on medium-low - until the butter, puree, and cheese are all nicely melted and mixed.",
      "Now serve to a hungry kid! With the above recipe you'll have plenty of Spanish Rice and Orange Puree left over - freeze the extra puree and refrigerate the rice, which will be good for 4 or 5 days."

Reserve 2 tablespoons of the rub for the sauce. (If only using enough rub for fewer than 4 racks of ribs, separate amount of rub you will need so as not to contaminate what is left over. You may store additional rub mixture in a sealed container or zip top bag for further use - it works very well on pork chops or chicken.).",
      "Remove membrane from the underside of ribs. This can be easily done by using a paring knife to loosen one edge of the membrane and then, using paper towel to grab the membrane, pull it off. Rinse off ribs and pat dry with paper towels. Apply remaining rub on both sides of ribs. Wrap the ribs plastic or use an extra large food grade zip top bag. Refrigerate for up to 24 hours or at least 3 hours.",
      "30 minutes before being ready to put ribs on grill, remove them from refrigerator and allow them to come closer to room temperature. On a gas grill set flame so that the temperature with the grill lid closed is 200-250\u00b0F Place water in a small aluminum pan (I use a loaf pan) on one side of the grill. This will allow a moist heat to penetrate the meat and allow for more moistness. Don't allow the water to evaporate completely. If you can use wood chips to smoke the meat with your grill, this is the time to get the chips smoking.",
      "Place ribs on the grill bone side down and leave them on the grill for 11/2 to 3 hours at this temperature (depending upon how much time you have and how tender you want the meat). I try to turn the ribs about every 30-40 minutes. It will be necessary to turn the ribs at least once. This is actually something that you need to see when it's time to do. Check your ribs periodically to be sure that they are not getting charred and that your grill is not too hot. Depending upon your grill, you may have to turn the ribs more often to avoid hot spots or flame ups. If you haven't already done so, at about the 2 hour point, you'll need to turn the ribs over. Allow them an additional 1 1/2 - 2 hours on the grill depending upon your time schedule. The more time they are done low and slow, the more tender they will become.",
      "(If you can't or don't want to grill the ribs, heat oven to 250\u00b0F Place ribs on a wire rack on top of a jelly roll pan. Place water in the bottom of the pan so that it does not come up to the rack. Use foil to tightly wrap the entire pan. Bake in oven for 3-4 hours.).",
      "While grilling the ribs, mix all ingredients for the sauce in a heavy-bottomed sauce pan. Add 2 tablespoons of reserved spices and add to the sauce mixture. Bring to a simmer and allow to simmer for 5 minutes. Remove from heat.",
      "If you prefer, mop the some of the sauce onto the ribs in the last 10 minutes of grilling. Leave the rest of the sauce so that guests can add their own sauce according to their tastes.",
      "Upon removing ribs from the grill, cut them into smaller sections or individual ribs (usually they're ready to fall apart). Serve immediately to a very happy crowd."

      "Grind the cinnamon, cloves, peppercorns and allspice to a powder in an electric spice mill or mortar and pestle.",
      "In a large saute pan, heat the oil and cook the onion until it begins to brown, about 7 minutes. Add the garlic, spices, wine, tomatoes, and artichokes and continue to simmer until the pan is nearly dry. Add salt to taste.",
      "Pour the tomato-artichoke sauce carefully over the eggplant and potatoes (this dish can be assembled to this point a day ahead of time and stored in the refrigerator overnight). Cover and cook on low for about 4 hours, or until a skewer inserted into the stew easily penetrates all the layers.",
      "While the vegetables are cooking, make the custard topping. Combine the milk and flour in a blender and blend until smooth. Pour the mixture into a saucepan and cook over medium-high heat, stirring constantly, until the sauce thickens enough to thickly coat the back of a spoon. Gradually stir in the cheese, then turn off the heat and rapidly whisk in the egg yolks one at a time. Stir in a dash of nutmeg.",
      "Carefully pour the custard over the vegetables, trying not to dislodge them. Cover and continue cooking for about 1 hour longer, or until the custard is set.",
      "Turn off the slow cooker and let the moussaka sit for 15-20 minutes, then carefully spoon up individual portions into a pasta bowl. Tip: The recipe suggests slicing up the dish into 4-6 portions right in the slow cooker insert with a sharp knife before removing the portions with a spoon."

Don't press them as they bake, it will make them stick. This takes less than a minute on each side, don't leave them too long as they will dry out. Stack them in middle of a large folded cloth to keep warm. Place a fish stick on each tortilla, dollop with sauce, a sprinkle of chopped onion, some sliced radishes, and pile on the shredded cabbage and serve. As of 4/09 these are less than a dollar per taco and will fill up four pretty well."
