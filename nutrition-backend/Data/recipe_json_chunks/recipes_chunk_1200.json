I'm sure other families have their own recipes, but for a reason unknown to me, whenever my mum made it, she reported on her return from the butcher's who else was making it the same day (usually 5 or 6 other families using the same butcher).

    "title": "the best homemade vanilla bean frozen custard",
    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "1. Heat the half + half, sugar, and vanilla beans and pod in a medium saucepan over low heat, whisking constantly to avoid a skin forming on the top of the mixture. Turn off the heat when the mixture is just about ready to start simmering - the mixture should coat the back of a metal spoon.",
      "2. Beat the egg yolks by hand or in a stand mixer until slightly thick. Slowly drizzle in about half of the half + half mixture into the eggs, whisking constantly. This is tempering the eggs - if you pour it in too fast, your eggs will scramble... and no one wants Scrambled Egg Ice Cream.",
      "3. Pour the egg mixture back into the pan with the remaining half + half mixture and heat on low or medium-low heat until thick, stirring constantly. It will start to get really thick and custard-like, which is what we are going for! Remove from heat when it begins to simmer.",
      "4. Pour the now custard into a bowl with the heavy whipping cream and stir to combine. Take a piece of plastic wrap and gently press it on to the top of the custard so the entire top surface is covered. This will help prevent it from forming a skin on top. Chill in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours or overnight. (After 2 hours, mine was not nearly cold enough, so I let it sit until the next day. Just gently touch the top to feel how cold the custard is.).",
      "5. Following the manufacturers directions, freeze in an ice cream maker until it reaches your desired consistency, about 20-30 minutes. Place mixture in an air tight container and place in freezer to harden for at least 8 hours.",
      "7. Before cleaning the blade, lick off every last inch and moan in ecstasy. 8 hours is entirely too long to wait for something this delicious!",
      "8. Top with your favorite toppings, or just eat it plain. IT IS THAT GOOD!"

Add yolks and vanilla and mix on medium speed until thoroughly combined, about 30 seconds. Scrape sides of bowl. With mixer running on low, add flour in 3 additions, waiting until each addition is incorporated before adding net and scraping bowl after each addition. Continue to mix until dough forms cohesive ball, about 5 seconds. Turn dough onto work surface; divide into 3 4-inch disks. Wrap each disk in plastic wrap and refrigerate until dough is firm yet malleable, 45 to 60 minutes.",

(If dough becomes soft and sticky, slide rolled dough on parchment onto baking sheet and rechill until firm, about 10 minutes.) Peel parchment from one side of dough and cut into desired shapes using cookie cutter(s) Use a thin metal spatula to transfer the cookie shapes to the prepared baking sheet, spacing them about 1 inch apart. Gather dough scraps and chill to use again.",
      "Bake about 10-12 minutes. The cookies will offer slight resistance to the touch when done. If they yield too easily, they are underdone. If they begin to darken on edges they have overbaked. Rotate the baking sheet halfway through baking time. Cool for 5 minutes, then, using the spatula, transfer them to wire rack and cool completely,.",

      "Cookies may be served plain or dusted with sifted powdered sugar. The logs of dough may be rolled in sanding sugar or chopped nuts just before slicing.",
      "Make a glaze by melting 4 ounces bittersweet chocolate with 4 tablespoons unsalted butter and whisk until smooth. Add 2 tablespoons corn syrup and 1 teaspoon vanilla land mix until smooth and shiny. Use back of spoon to spread scant teaspoon glaze to edge of each cookies. It may be necessary to reheat glaze to keep it spreadable. Allow glazed cookie s to dry at least 20 minutes.",

Follow recipe above for Chocolate Butter Cookies, whisking nut mixture into flour before adding flour to dough in step 2. Proceed with recipe. Roll dough into log and roll the log in 1/2 cup sanding sugar.",

Place them on a sheet of aluminum foil, drizzle with olive oil 1-2 teaspoons and salt and pepper. Wrap up in the foil and bake at 375 for 50 minutes for medium sized beets. 45 for small 60 for large. Just let cool before peeling the skin. Just use a small plain knife and pull off the skin. If you don't want red fingers use gloves. Or after peeling them (and you will have red fingers -- just use a light mix of bleach and water and the red will come off your hands). Just store in a baggie or ziplock/plastic container. Don't slice until you need them.",
      "Salad -- Now prepare the salad. In a medium size bowl add the arugula, red onion and pecans reserving some for a garnish. Now I don't add the apples or pears until right at the end. Just drizzle with lemon so they will not brown and set on a plate covered in saran wrap to the side.",
      "Duck -- First score the skin. With a knife cut cross marks on the skin side in order to release all the duck fat as it cooks. Just salt and pepper well. Then in a heavy pan such as cast iron, cold not heated -- add 1 teaspoon olive oil and add the duck skin side down which is important. Turn the heat to to medium high heat, saute the duck. Starting from cold lets the duck render all the duck fat and give it a crispy crust. After about 10 minutes, flip and cover with a lid. Cook until 135 for medium rare. About 5-7 more minutes. Half way through you can drain some of the duck fat off if you want. Once done to medium rare, remove from the heat and cover with foil and let rest before slicing.",
      "Vinaigrette -- Remove most of the duck fat and just keep a little of the bits on the bottom of the pan for flavor, add the olive oil, mashed pear, garlic and shallot to the pan and cook until well combined 2-3 minutes. Add the white wine to deglaze the pan and cook another minute. Add the mustard, rice wine vinegar, apple juice, fresh thyme, salt and pepper and cook just a minute.",
      "Put it all together -- Add a couple of tablespoons of the vinaigrette to the lettuce and toss lightly. Make sure to add in the pears and apples at this point. Now slice your beets and duck. On each plate add your salad mix, then fan out the sliced beets (1 beet per person), and top with the duck thin sliced (1 breast per person).

      "If you do not have a preserving pan, use the widest pan you have. The wider the pan, the more quickly moisture will evaporate from the mixture, and this is what you want when you are making jelly, jam, or marmalade.",
      "Bring the berries and sugar to a simmer over medium heat, stirring frequently, then continue to cook until the juices are just deep enough to cover the blueberries, about 5 minutes. Pour the berries into a colander set over a large bowl and stir the berries gently to drain off the juice. Return the juice to the pan, along with the diced apples and the bag with the trimmings, and bring to a boil over high heat.",
      "Boil, stirring occasionally, until the syrup is reduced and thick. This usually takes about 15 to 20 minutes. Take the pan off the heat and remove the bag containing the apple trimmings from the syrup and place it between two plates. Hold these plates over the preserving pan, and squeeze the plates together to squeeze out any juice which is in the bag. You don't have to try to get every last bit of juice out, just as much as you can get reasonably, and then set the bag aside.",
      "Return the blueberries and any accumulated juice, along with the lemon juice and zest, to the pan and bring to a simmer. Simmer, stirring frequently, for 5 minutes, and then check the set.",
      "Use the cold plate test to check set: take the pan of jam off the heat (if you don't remove the jam from the heat while you check the set, it could over-cook and become rubbery or hard, if the jam is indeed already set) place a drop of the jam mixture on one of the saucers you've kept in the freezer, & place the plate back in the freezer for 1 minute. After 1 minute, take the saucer out of the freezer and nudge the drop of jam with your finger. If it \"wrinkles\" when you nudge it with your finger it is done. If the jam is not set, continue cooking over medium-high heat, checking the set again every 5 minutes.",
      "Once the jam is set, remove it from the heat and stir gently for a few seconds to distribute the fruit in the liquid.",
      "Ladle the jam into sterilized canning jars, leaving 1/4\" headspace. Wipe the rims of the jars with damp paper towels to remove any jam which got on the rims or the threads. Place the lids and the bands on the jars, just tightening the bands fingertip tight.",
      "Process in a boiling water bath for 5 minutes, then remove and let sit, undisturbed, for at least 12 hours before checking seals. It is important to let them sit undisturbed for 12 hours because the sealing compound on the lids is still cooling and hardening, completing the seal. While the jars cool, you will hear a \"plink\" type sound from each jar - this is the jars completing the vacuum seal as the final air escapes the jar. After 12 hours have passed, remove the bands and check the lids - press down in the center of the lid. If you cannot push the lid down any further, the jar is sealed. If the lid \"gives\" a bit, and you can push it down, the jar did not seal. You can either put the band back on the jar, and reprocess it for another 5 minutes, or you can just put it in the fridge and use it within 3 months."

      "Cut nori in half; lengthwise or widthwise -- whichever will wrap it around the musubi. You can also make them in narrow strips (like in the picture); a lot of nori come perforated now for easy separation. Place in a resealable plastic bag. Set aside.",

      "In a large non-stick pan over medium heat, fry slices until lightly browned and slightly crispy. Place on a plate lined with paper towels. Set aside. (You shouldn't need oil.).",
      "Combine the soy sauce, mirin and sugar in a saucepan; bring to a slow boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to low; add the spam, turning to coat. Simmer until mixture has thickened, about 5 minutes; remove pan from heat. Let Spam slices sit in marinade until ready to use.",
      "Instructions below are for 1 musubi. Repeat with the other 7 Spam slices, making sure to rinse off musubi maker after each use to prevent if from getting too sticky -- keeping in a bowl of warm water will help to keep it clean and moist.",
      "MUSUBI 1. Place a piece of nori on a clean surface. Moisten (but not dripping wet) lower half of musubi maker and position on top of the nori so the length of the press is in the middle of the nori (widthwise). The press and the width of the nori should fit exactly the length of a slice of Spam. Fill the musubi maker with 1/2 cup of the rice, press rice until 3/4-inch high. Top with 1 slice of Spam. Remove the musubi from the press by pushing the whole stack down (with the flat part of the press) while lifting off the press. Fold nori end closest to you over the Spam and rice stack; roll until completely wrapped in the nori. Slightly dampen the end of the nori to seal it. Repeat with remaining Spam slices.",
      "MUSUBI 2. Spread approximately 1/4 cup cooked rice across the bottom of the musubi maker, on top of the nori. Press rice down to compact the rice until it is 1/4-inch thick. Place a slice of Spam on top of the rice. Cover with an additional 1/4 cup cooked rice; press until 1/4-inch thick. Remove the musubi from the press by pushing the whole stack down (with the flat part of the press) while lifting off the press. Fold nori end closest to you over Spam and rice stack; roll until completely wrapped in the nori. Slightly dampen the end of the nori to seal it. Repeat with remaining Spam slices.",
      "OTHER IDEAS: 1. Sprinkle rice with furikake, mixed in with the rice or sprinkled on before placing Spam on rice. 2. Add a thin layer of scrambled egg (place under the Spam. 3. Add furukake and the scrambled egg. 3. Slice each musubi in half diagonally after making; 4. Musubi #1 without the sauce; 5. You can also use hotdog (sliced to flatten, not completely through), leftover chicken, etc. There is no wrong way to make a musubi. All that matters is that you enjoy it!",
      "SOME NOTES I PICKED UP OVER THE INTERNET:",
      "NOTE1: Only use medium-grain 'sticky' rice such as Calrose Diamond G brand.",
      "NOTE2: 1 rice cooker cup = 180 ml (1 regular cup = 240 ml) 3 rice cooker cups of uncooked rice should give you the 5 cups of rice you will need for this.",
      "NOTE3. the NORI sheets (thin roasted seaweed). As a general rule of thumb ? good Nori is very dark green, almost black in color.",
      "NOTE4. Spam musubi are best eaten while still warm but if you have to refrigerate your musubi, wrap each in plastic wrap or press n' seal and refrigerate. Just pop it into the microwave for about 10 seconds or so to soften the rice."

    "title": "sweet ricotta dumplings with strawberry sauce - canederli",
    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "Put the cut strawberries in the saucepan (or cut them right into it), pour the sugar and lemon juice over, and toss together. Set the pan over medium-low heat; stir occasionally as the berries release juice and it gradually starts to bubble. Adjust the heat to keep the juice simmering, and cook for about 8 minutes, until the berries are soft and the juice is slightly syrupy. Turn off the heat, and cover the pot to keep the sauce warm.",
      "Meanwhile, fill the big pot with about 6 quarts water, add 1 tablespoon salt, and heat it to a boil. Put the butter in the big skillet and melt it over very low heat; turn off the flame, but leave the skillet on the warm burner.",
      "For the dough: Dump the ricotta into a large bowl, and stir to loosen it and break up lumps, then blend in the eggs and 1/4 teaspoon salt. Sprinkle all the flour on top, and fold it in gently, just until it is all incorporated, with no small clumps of dry flour. The dough will be stiff and somewhat sticky.",
      "Adjust the heat so the cooking water is bubbling gently. Fill a glass or jar with cold water to moisten the scoop, so the dough doesn't stick. Dip the ice-cream scoop into the water glass, scoop up a round of dough, level it off (scraping excess back in the bowl), and dispense the dumpling into the cooking pot. Scoop up all the dough in the same way, and get the dumplings cooked as quickly as possible. If you don't have an ice-cream scoop, use a 1/4-cup measure. Empty each portion into your hand (both hands must be lightly floured!), and quickly roll it into a ball, then drop the dumpling into the pot.",
      "As you form the canederli, keep the scoop moistened (or your hands floured) and the water at a gentle simmer: don't let it boil vigorously, which can break apart the canederli.",
      "After all are in the pot, let the dumplings cook, without stirring, until all have risen to the surface of the water. Simmer them another 5 minutes, and then scoop one out and test it for doneness. First, press it gently: it should feel solid and spring back to the touch. If it feels soft at the center, return it to the pot and cook the batch a minute or two longer. Scoop out another dumpling, and cut into it to check that the center is not wet and oozing and that the dough looks uniformly cooked through.",
      "Meanwhile, have the big skillet with melted butter warming over very low heat. Lift out the cooked dumplings with a spider, let them drain over the pot for a few seconds, then gently drop them in the skillet. Roll the dumplings gently so they're coated all over with butter, then turn off the heat and leave them in the warm pan for a few minutes to firm up.",
      "Serve the canederli on warm dessert plates, spooning a pool of strawberry sauce in the center of each plate and setting two or three canederli on top. For family-style serving, arrange the canederli in a large, rimmed platter and drizzle some of the strawberry sauce around them in a colorful border. Pass the remaining sauce at the table."

With reduced fat baking recipes, smaller sizes muffins, biscuits and pancakes will give better results. Fat may be reduced in most baking recipes by one-third. Fat makes baked goods tender and crisp, so lowering the amount of fat will change the texture as well as the flavor. With pie crusts, the fat may be decreased to one part fat to four parts flour. Some have had success also with replacing some of the fat in quick bread recipes with the same amount of applesauce. I have found it does work but the texture is tougher than the original recipe."
