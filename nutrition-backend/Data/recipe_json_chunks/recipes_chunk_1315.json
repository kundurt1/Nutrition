Using a rolling pin or a flat-bottomed saucepan or pot, crush the vanilla wafers until they're coarsely ground. Transfer them to a small bowl and stir in the sugar, cinnamon, and salt. Use a spoon to evenly stir in the melted butter, transfer to the prepared baking sheet, and toast in the oven until brown and fragrant, 12 to 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and set aside to cool.

Slice the banana quarters crosswise into 1/2-inch pieces and divide between 6 custard cups or martini glasses (sprinkle with a squeeze of lemon juice if you like-this helps prevent browning). Whisk the pudding until it is soft and smooth, about 30 seconds, and then divide it between the custard cups. Top with the vanilla wafer mixture and serve. (If not served immediately, the pudding will keep in the refrigerator for up to 3 days, with plastic wrap intact. Sprinkle the crumbs on just before serving.)"

Decrease the heat to maintain a light boil and cook, uncovered, for 3 minutes.",

Cook, undisturbed, until the shrimp turn golden, 1 to 2 minutes, and then flip them with a spatula and cook until they are just opaque throughout, 1 to 2 more minutes, depending on the size. Add the ouzo and cook until syrupy, about 30 seconds. Using a spatula, briskly remove the shrimp from the pan and arrange on top of the millet. Sprinkle with the parsley and serve at once."

      "For our Marmalade-Glazed Pork Roast with Parsnips and Onions recipe, we prefer a well-marbled pork loin roast from the blade. Glossing the roast with a bittersweet marmalade and rosemary glaze adds plenty of flavor to the rather mild pork. By roasting the parsnips and red onions in the skillet alongside the roast, we created a complete meal from one pan. Tossing the vegetables in the same glaze--enriched with olive oil and thinned with orange juice--gave them a glossy look and sweet taste. Allowing the roast to rest at least 10 minutes before slicing allowed the juices to redistribute through the meat.",
      "",
      "For best results, avoid using enhanced pork (pork injected with a solution of water, salt, and chemicals); it causes the pork to exude excess liquid as it cooks, inhibiting the caramelization of the vegetables.",

      "Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Lightly grease the bottom your baking cloche. Combine buttermilk, stevia, and egg, beating until thoroughly combined. Cover and set aside. Combine the rest of the ingredients in a large bowl using a whisk to simulate the effects of sifting. Make a well in the center, and pour the wet ingredients into the dry. Stir with a wooden spoon until a relatively soft dough is formed (very much like biscuit dough; in my dry climate, I often need to add a bit of water). Lightly knead on a floured surface until the dough has a uniform surface. Shape as desired to fit your cloche (loaf should be apx 3\" high). Slash the top of the dough for interesting effect. Place dough in cloche and set the lid over it. (You crust junkies can sprinkle the inside of the lid with a bit of water to increase crustiness.) Place cloche in oven and bake for 40 to 45 minutes, until crust is lightly golden brown and very crisp, and a skewer inserted into the center comes out clean. Allow to cool for at least 10 minutes for best slicing. Bread will only keep for a couple of days, but since it makes wonderful french toast and bread pudding, this usually isn't a problem."

Caswell ends the green debate by using Swiss chard, enriches the sauce with mascarpone (a soft, rich Italian cheese), and replaces the anise flavor of Pernod with the tangy heat of Indian-influenced lime pickle."

Drain the potatoes into a colander and then tip back into the empty saucepan, sprinkling over the semolina. Shake the potatoes around to coat them well and, with the lid clamped on, give the pan a good rotation and the potatoes a proper bashing so that their edges disintegrate or fuzz and blur a little: this facilitates the crunch effect later.",
      "Meanwhile, empty the goose fat into a large roasting pan and heat in the oven until seriously hot. (I often parboil the potatoes a few hours in advance, so the \"meanwhile\" doesn't always hold. And you can start heating up the fat in the oven that the turkey's in, turning it up to really hot once the bird comes out.) Then tip the semolina-coated potatoes carefully into the hot fat and roast in the oven for an hour or until they are darkly golden and crispy, turning them over halfway through cooking. If the oven's hot enough they probably won't need more than about 25 minutes a side; and it's better to let them sit in the oven (you can always pour off most of the fat and leave them in the pan) till the very last minute.",

I find that a meat thermometer is essential in cooking because it allows me to check for doneness without cutting into the meat and losing its precious juices. Let the chicken rest for 5 minutes before serving. Plate the chicken, making sure to spoon some extra sauce over the top. Sprinkle over some fresh rosemary. If there is ever a time to use fresh herbs, THIS IS IT! The flavors are just so good together. Enjoy the savory goodness of this meal!"

      "Put a strainer over a bowl. Working over a second bowl, lift a tomato, pinch off the head (stem end) and any unripe areas, and let those pieces drop into the bowl. Some tomatoes may not be deep red. I prefer not to use those, but it's your call. Open up the tomato, remove any skins, seeds, or tough sections and add them to your discard bowl. Break the cleaned tomato into small pieces or strips and put them in the strainer. Keep in mind that these will not be blended, so if they look too coarse for your taste, run them through your fingers to make smaller pieces.",
      "Continue cleaning and crushing tomatoes until you have the amount called for in your recipe. Press gently on the tomatoes to strain as much liquid as possible. Discard the contents of the discard bowl and the bowl below the strainer. One 28-ounce can of tomatoes should yield 1 generous cup (250 grams) crushed tomatoes. The glaze can be stored in a covered container at room temperature for several months."

Cover and cook for 30 minutes. After 30 minutes, if beans have plumped up and started to soften, add about a teaspoon of salt, make sure a thin layer of water is still covering the beans and recover the pot. Beginning at about 45 minutes, start checking for doneness - they should still be firm, not mushy or falling apart, but not hard or crunchy on the inside either. Usually it takes 45 minutes to an hour to reach the right doneness for cannellii beans. Once they're done, turn off the heat, remove the rosemary and bay leaves and let the beans cool down a bit. At this point, if you want to refrigerate or freeze the beans with some of the liquid (enought to cover them) they will keep well.",
      "",
      "To finish them, put olive oil, 2 garlic cloves and a few broken chiles in a saute pan over high heat for 1-2 minutes (slighly brown the garlic cloves) and then add enough cannellini beans with a very small amount of liquid to have a single layer of beans covering the bottom of the pan. Stir or toss occasionally over medium to high heat until liquid evaporates and beans begin to crisp a little, about 7 minutes. Salt to taste and finish with a little extra virgin olive oil. Excellent accompanyment to grilled chicken, steak or lamb, or roasted fish."
