Add the butter and pulse until the butter pieces are no bigger than the size of a pea (about 16 1-second pulses). If mixing by hand, toss the butter pieces with the flour and use a pastry cutter to smash the butter into the flour until the pieces are no bigger than small peas. Add the dried fruit and then the cream. Pulse a few times or mix with a spoon, just until the mixture is combined. Don't mix too much or the scones won't be tender.",

You can cut each triangle in half to make 16 small scones if you like.",
      "Arrange the scones on the prepared baking sheet, evenly spaced apart. If you're not planning on topping them with glaze, sprinkle each with a little sugar. Place the baking sheet on the center rack of the oven and bake until the tops are golden brown, 12 to 15 minutes.",
      "To make the glaze: In a small bowl combine powdered sugar, coconut cream, vanilla and a pinch of salt. Stir until smooth. Drizzle or spoon over the cooled scones.\r\n\r\nServe scones with lemon curd, jam or clotted cream.",
      "Notes: Unsweetened coconut cream can be found at Trader Joe's and stores with a robust selection of Asian ingredients. It's much thicker than coconut milk, and makes these scones incredibly rich and tender. The cream will have likely solidified in the can. Just transfer it to a bowl and briefly melt it in the microwave at 50% power (or warm it in a pan on the stove) just until it's liquid again. Be sure it has cooled to room temperature before using. If you can't find a can of unsweetened coconut cream you can scrape the cream off the top of canned coconut milk, adding enough of the coconut milk to measure 3/4 cup. The result just won't be quite as decadent.\r\n\r\nUnbaked scones freeze beautifully so don't be afraid to store a few in the freezer. To bake from frozen decrease heat to 375 and bake about 10 minutes longer."

They'll get smaller with cooking, so don't be afraid to cut them into really large chunks (even 2\" or more). It will be so tender that even if the meat ends up being larger than bite-sized, it can easily be cut with a fork. Also, use a good, marbled cut of beef, for the juiciest, tastiest stew..",

No need to add water but just watch the apricots carefully and give them the occasional stir so they don't stick and brown on the bottom of the pan. As the pan heats, they will release their own juices and the fruit will begin to simmer. You can help them along by squashing them a little with a wooden spoon as you do your occasional stir. Simmer for approximately 30 minutes.",
      "At this point, the fruit will be completely soft and fallen apart. Pass it through a very fine sieve over a bowl to remove the skins. Weigh your smooth apricot puree, then place back in the pot over low heat and add the sugar-Artusi calculates that you'll need 800 grams of sugar for every kilo of apricot puree (so 4/5 of the weight of the apricots), which for this amount is usually about 500 grams (17 1/2 ounces).",
      "Heat until the sugar dissolves, stirring often. Continue simmering on low until you reach the consistency desired. If you let this go quite a while, you will get a harder set jam, but even just a short 10 minutes or so will give you a very soft, lovely jam, perfect for this crostata, which has additional cooking time in the oven.",

Cut the cold butter into the flour and sugar by pulsing the processor or, if using hands, rub the butter into the flour until you get a crumbly mixture and there are no more visible butter pieces. Mix in the beaten egg and the yolk along with the lemon zest until the pastry comes together into a smooth, elastic ball. Let it rest in the fridge for at least 30 minutes. Artusi says if you do this the day before, even better.",
      "After the dough has rested, preheat the oven to 350\u00b0 F. Divide the dough into two pieces, one slightly larger than the other. Roll this larger one out to about 3-millimeter thickness to cover your pie dish. Roll out the rest of the pastry and with a pastry cutter or sharp knife, cut long strips about 2 centimeters wide. Fill the pie with jam and criss-cross your lattice strips over the top. If you like, use the leftover egg white to brush gently over the top of the pastry. Bake at 350\u00b0 F (180\u00b0 C) for about 25 minutes, or until the pastry is golden brown and the jam bubbling."

Cover with a damp cloth and leave the loaves in a warm place to rise until doubled, about 1 hour. Twenty minutes before baking, heat the oven to 400 degrees.",

Add the fine sugar and both types of zest to a small bowl and combine, using fingers of one hand, until the zest is well distributed and the mixture looks like wet sand.

Add the citrus-infused sugar and beat for 1 minute to blend, scraping sides as needed (sugar will not be dissolved). Add the egg and the yolk and beat until well incorporated, about 1 minute. Add the ricotta, and beat 1 more minute, scraping the sides again. Reduce the speed to low and add the flour mixture in four additions (about 2/3 cup each), alternating with the boozy dried fruit (https://food52.com/recipes/78284-boozy-dried-fruit), starting and ending with flour, and scraping the bowl as needed.",

Use the bench scraper to place into a medium bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and allow to rest at room temperature for at least 1 hour (or chill for up to 24 hours). This allows the bran to absorb moisture for a more appealing texture.",

You might have to clean and flour the work surface a few times, depending on the moistness of your dough. Loosen the dough and allow it to gently drop onto the work surface. Cut in half with the bench scraper, and work with one piece (500g each) at a time, keeping the other one covered with the turned-over bowl.",

With a lightly floured rolling pin, gently roll the piece to about 8 x 5 inches (3/4-inch thick), loosening it with the bench scraper as needed. If small cracks appear around the edges, press together gently.",
      "Use the bench scraper to rotate the dough 90 degrees so the long side is facing you. Lightly brush with water across the lower third. With the help of the bench scraper, fold the far edge of the dough towards you but not all the way, leaving an uncovered edge of about 1 inch. Use the side of your palm to gently seal the edge, thus creating the characteristic stollen shape. Finally, gently press in both sides to reshape the loaf and place crosswise onto the baking sheet. Repeat with the second piece of dough and place it crosswise as well, leaving at least 4 inches of space in between.",
      "BAKE: Bake for 15 minutes, rotate the baking sheet, and lower the temperature to 350\u00b0F. Bake until the loaves turn deep golden brown around the edges and lightly brown on top with cracks across the whole length, 20 to 25 more minutes. Loosely place a piece of aluminum foil on top if loaves brown too fast. A cake tester, inserted into the center, should come out clean.",
      "When the stollen is almost ready, melt the remaining 30 g butter in a small saucepan over low heat; set aside. Slide the baked loaves with the parchment paper onto a wire rack. Immediately brush each loaf with some of the rum. Repeat, then generously brush each loaf with melted butter and sift a thick layer of confectioners' sugar across.",
      "STORE: Allow to cool completely, at least 2 hours, before carefully wrapping each loaf in aluminum foil. Store in a container at cool room temperature for at least 1 day for flavors to meld. Stollen will last for up to 7 days. Just before serving, dust once more generously with confectioners' sugar. Cut into thin slices, using a long sharp knife."

Add the pork to the bowl, and give another good mix, making sure you marinate all of the pork. Set this aside and let it rest for about 45 minutes. During this time, make the sauce that you will pour over the noodles.\r\n\r\nMake the sauce. Add two cloves of minced garlic, one chopped Thai bird chili, four tablespoons of white vinegar, one tablespoon of fish sauce, four tablespoons of sugar, and six tablespoons of water to a sauce pan. Bring to a boil, stirring from time to time. You want all of the sugar to dissolve. Once dissolved, remove it from the burner, and set it aside to cool. The sauce will have reduced a bit as well.\r\n\r\nNow boil your noodles until they are cooked al dente. Once cooked, drain, and set them aside.\r\n\r\nMake your pickled carrots by adding the vinegar, sugar, salt and water to a skillet. Bring to a boil, making sure you dissolve all of the sugar. Add the carrots to a jar, and pour the pickling liquid over the carrots. Set these to the side until you are ready to plate.\r\n\r\nOK, now fire up your grill. I'm a big believer in grilling over coal, but if you have a gas grill, go ahead and use that. No big deal.",
      "Once your coals are hot, begin laying down the pork onto the grates. You will probably need to do these in batches, and you will not want to walk away from it as pork shoulder has some fat on it and well, the sugar in the marinate... you get it.\r\n\r\nCooking the pork will go rather quickly, and probably only take a few minutes per side. You will see how the pork caramelizes.\r\n\r\nONE THING. Resist eating the cooked pork at this time. Remember, this pork is the star of the dish and it will have to make it into the bowls. It's hard to resist, trust me.\r\n\r\nOnce the pork is grilled, it is ready to plate.\r\n\r\nAdd a bit of the noodles to a bowl. Drizzle some of the chili sauce over the noodles. Add pork, bean sprouts, cilantro, mint, green onions, cucumber, pickled carrots, and crushed peanuts to the bowl. Drizzle more of the chili sauce. Give it a good mix, and dig in.",
      "The dish is huge in flavortown. The sweetness of the mixture, along with the pickled carrots, and a mild heat from the chili sauce, this dish has everything you would ever want in a great Vietnamese dish. Let's just say my oldest, and somewhat pickiest of eaters, had three servings."

      "Once the veggies are in the pot pour the dry peas into a container and pick them over looking for bad peas and stones. The yellow peas are not bad; they are just yellow so leave them in to cook. On the package of peas there will be directions to soak/soften the peas, don't do it. The starch in the peas will be lost and your soup will never thicken, trust me I have tried it and my mother laughed at me when I couldn't get my soup to thicken.",

      "Adjusting the heat is an art especially on an electric range where the perfect setting seems to be half way between the simmer and low. A gas stove with its infinite heat adjustment is a nice thing to have for this recipe. Once you have decided on the right setting leave the pot to boil stirring ever 45 minutes allowing the boiling water to remove all the meat and marrow from the ham bone. After about 2 hours you can pull the bone out and peel off the loosened meat before returning all the meat and bones to the pot. Be careful the bone will be hot.",
      "Now just leave the soup to boil softly stirring about every 30 minutes, be sure when you stir you are scraping the bottom of the pot to keep everything from sticking. The soup should take most of the day, 6 to 8 hours, to thicken.",
      "The longer it cooks and thicker it becomes the better. The peas and veggies will dissolve; the bone will be cleaned of meat and marrow, and your kitchen will smell heavenly. When the soup is almost done start tasting the soup to adjust the seasonings. If your ham had a lot of salt you may not need to add any if it was lightly salted you may need 2 teaspoons or more salt. Trust your palate, increase the other spices accordingly. Remove the large bones and any fat/gristle you see. Serve with crackers, enjoy."

    "ingredients": [],

      "Add the 1/4 c. vegetable oil to a large heavy-bottomed dutch oven and scatter in the sliced portobellos. Turn the heat to medium and cook the mushrooms, slowly, turning often, until they are evenly crisp around the edges. Transfer the mushrooms to a paper towel-lined plate and set aside. Pour out all of the oil in the pan, leaving any brown bits in the bottom.",
      "Preheat your oven's broiler, or a grill, to high heat. Place the corn cobs on a plate or in a bowl and drizzle on enough oil to evenly coat each ear. Place under your broiler or on the preheated grill, and cook, turning the ears with tongs to char each side. This could take up to 10 minutes, depending on your preference and the strength of your appliance. Allow the cobs to cool enough to handle. Cut the stems off each corn cob to make a flat base, stand upright in the middle of a large plate or bowl and, using a sharp, serrated knife, slice the kernels from the cob. Its important, for flavor and texture, to only cut the yellow kernels (not the white pith) from the cob. Season the kernels with a pinch of salt and set aside. Break or cut the cobs in half and place in a large saucepan. Cover them with 6 c. water and set the pan over medium-high heat. Once the water reaches a simmer, decrease the heat enough to maintain a gentle bubble.",
      "Heat the pan you used to crisp the mushrooms over medium heat and add 3 T. butter. Once the butter has melted (I like to let it brown just slightly), add the shallot, season with a healthy pinch of salt and saute until just softened, using a wooden spoon to scrape up all of the bits from the mushrooms. Add the garlic and a pinch (or more) of red chile flake and cook for 30 seconds, until fragrant.",
      "Dump in the rice and toss frequently, cooking until lightly toasted, 2 - 3 minutes. Pour in the white wine and stir constantly, allowing the rice to absorb the wine almost completely. Using a ladle, add about 2 c. of the corn stock to the rice, stirring constantly until it too has absorbed almost completely. Maintain a gentle, but constant simmer on the rice, To test whether risotto needs more liquid, I drag the spoon through the rice to the very bottom of the pan. If the line holds for a couple seconds, I add another 1/2 c. or so of the liquid. Continue adding the liquid, stirring frequently, until the rice is al dente. If you run out of liquid in the pot, or you notice you're running low and your rice isn't close to proper doneness, add more water to the stock pan, trying to keep it as warm as you can.",
      "When the rice has a pleasant toothsome bite, fold in the reserved corn kernels to heat through for 30 seconds or so. Remove the pan from heat and check for seasoning and consistency. If the rice is done, but the dish is stiff and thick, add another 1/4 - ? c. liquid, to form a nice, stew-like consistency (risotto should puddle when spooned onto a plate, not plop). Add the remaining 3 T. butter and the cheese all at once and, with all the confidence in the world, stir the rice vigorously with the spoon, shaking the pan back and forth a bit. This is what the Italian call the \"mantecatura\", and it will leave you with a risotto of unrivaled silkiness.",
      "Fold in the fresh tarragon, top with the crispy mushrooms and check for seasoning one last time and serve immediately, risotto waits for nobody. Pass more Parmigiano and tarragon and enjoy."

Once the oil is hot enough, use a 1.5 inch cookie scoop to scoop perfect portions of dough right into the oil in batches.

At that point, remove immediately from the heat by pouring into another container. The solids go from brown to black quickly, so it's important to stop the cooking process as soon as the hazelnut stage is achieved.

Lay pear slices in the caramel sauce to just heat, turned each carefully to keep from breaking apart. They will begin to exude their juices. You can do the pear cooking in batches to keep slices pristine, or you can fling them in willy nilly and stir to coat and heat. Don't cook too long or they will be mushy.",

Rub in the flour, vanilla caviar, kumquat strips and egg yolks. When it looks like coarse breadcrumbs, add cold milk or water and pat gently. Form into a ball and flour lightly. Do not over work the pastry or it will become elastic and chewy, not crisp and flaky. Wrap the dough in clingfilm and refrigerate for at least an hour (I did for 3 hours!)\r\n\r\nRemove from the fridge and roll it out as thinly as you can on a lightly floured surface. Then line the tart tin....as best as you can (mine seemed a tad small for the tin but I managed to stretch it...to fit!) and freeze for an hour.\r\n\r\nWhen the hour's up, preheat the oven to 180 degrees centigrade (350 degrees fahrenheit) and bake the pastry shell for 12 minutes or until lightly golden. Remove from oven and set aside.",
      "ASSEMBLE THE TART: \r\nPreheat the oven to 200 degrees centigrade (400 degrees fahrenheit), Once the tart shell is cool, fill it with the rice mixture and sprinkle with icing sugar. \r\n\r\nBake for 20-25 minutes until the pastry is golden. Serve with a quenelle of creme fraiche and some kumquat strips."

Carefully add two cups of vegetable stock or water and salt to taste. Bring to a boil. Cover and reduce the heat to low. Simmer for about 15-20 minutes or until the quinoa is done. Turn off the heat, let stand for 5 minutes in the covered pot. Put the all of the cooked quinoa in a large bowl and set aside.\r\n\r\nPut the frozen hash brown potatoes in a microwave safe bowl. Microwave them for 2-3 minutes, until they're starting to soften. Place them in the bowl with the quinoa.",
      "Meanwhile, heat some oil in a nonstick skillet and saute the diced red bell pepper until tender crisp. Once the bell peppers have softened, put them in a bowl along with the cooked quinoa and potatoes. Add the rinsed and drained black beans, salsa, diced scallions, chili seasoning, dried oregano and corn. Add a couple of good squeezes of lime juice. Stir in 1/2 cup of the shredded cheese and salt to taste. Put the mixture into the prepared baking pan and sprinkle the rest of the cheese on top. Cover with aluminum foil. Bake for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and continue baking for another 20-25 minutes or until the cheese has melted.\r\n\r\nIf you're going to finish this casserole with crumbled cooked bacon then fry a few pieces of diced bacon in a skillet as the casserole bakes. When the casserole is done, sprinkle it over the top. I like to serve sour cream, hot sauce, diced scallions, lime wedges and diced avocado on the side. Enjoy!"

      "THE NIGHT BEFORE (or at least 12 hours before): Add the flours to a bread machine or to a bowl with the dough hook attachment. Dilute the yeast and the malt in some of the water, then add it to the flour, along with the 2 tbsps of olive oil and the rest of the water. Depending on the flour you're using, you might need more or less water: I suggest starting with 240ml, then adding a bit more if the dough seems too stiff. Knead everything until incorporated, then add the salt, and knead until the dough is well mixed. it should be very loose and sticky, but not really liquid. \r\nIF KNEADING BY HAND: This can be totally kneaded by hand! The dough is quite loose, but work it well with your hands, collecting it from the bottom and slamming it in the bowl for several times. You'll see how the dough will start to look smoother and more elastic after 5 to 10 minutes of this collect-and-slam process. Proceed just like with the machine, adding water, yeast, malt and oil to the flours, then the salt when everything is already incorporated.\r\nOil a glass bowl and put the dough in it, cover with plastic wrap and leave it in a place where there are not going to be temperature changes, like the oven. The dough should stay at a temperature of about 25 C? (77 F?). \r\nIF MAKING 24 Hrs BEFORE: the dough can also be assembled 24 hours before, but you should keep it in the lower part of your fridge for the whole time.\r\n\r\nCut the potatoes into thin rounds - make them slightly thicker than a potato chip, and soak them in water overnight.",
      "AFTER 12 HOURS: At this point, your dough should have noticeably risen and should be very bubbly on top. \r\nPrepare a pan that can fit your dough in an even layer, about a half inch thick. Oil the bottom, and scrape your dough into the pan. Add a little oil on top, and spread it out with your oiled hands, then fold it over itself a couple times. Spread it out again in an even layer, and leave it to rest, covered with plastic or with a cloth, for about 1 hour. Again, make sure is stays in a current-free environment at about 25C? (77F?).",
      "30 minutes before the dough is ready, preheat the oven to 240C? (465F?). Make sure it is set to static.\r\nAlso, cook the onions: add a bit of olive oil to a pan and add your thinly sliced onions, add salt, a bit of water and cook until they start to color, but are not browned. It should take around 15 minutes. Keep adding tablespoons of water to prevent them from burning, but make sure there's no water left when they're ready.",
      "After 1 hour, you Focaccia should have puffed up a bit. Mix 1 tbsp of water with 1 more tablespoon of olive oil and a pinch of salt, and spread on top of the focaccia. Spread the potato slices evenly, then put your focaccia in the lowest part of your oven for 15 minutes. After this time, transfer the pan to the medium rack of the oven, bake for a further 5 minutes, then spread the onions evenly on top. Finish baking for 5 more minutes. \r\nThe focaccia should be a golden color. If the edges start turning brown, remove immediately from the oven. The total time of cooking here is 25 minutes, but it could take more or less depending on your oven.",
      "Cut the focaccia into bite-size cubes and enjoy warm! If it gets cold, I suggest reheating it in the oven.",
      "MORE TOPPING AND FILLING SUGGESTIONS: This focaccia is also great cut lenghtwise and stuffed with cold cuts, grilled vegetables or cheeses (or all three). \r\nA tasty addition to the topping are zucchini sauteed in olive oil, salt, pepper and parsley. \r\nTo make a simple focaccia, skip the onion and potato and top with rosemary and coarse salt instead."

I used my salad spinner, which seemed to do the trick.",
      "Combine the heavy cream, the whole milk, and the petals in a medium sized saucepan over medium heat. Stir the petals into the cream until the cream is at a bare simmer. Turn off the heat and allow the petals to steep. After 30 minutes strain the petals with a fine strainer and repeat the process with the other six blossoms using the same cream. You are double infusing the cream to get a strong peony flavor.",
      "While you are infusing the cream for a second time whisk the eggs in a mixing bowl until they are light and fluffy. I used a hand mixer for 2 minutes. Once the eggs are fluffy, whisk in the sugar a little at a time until it is fully Incorporated.",
      "Pour about a cup of the hot, strained, peony cream into the egg mixture, whisking the whole time (you are tempering the eggs here). Then pour the egg mixture into the saucepan with the rest of the peony cream. Cook the ice cream base over medium-low heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture coats the back of a spoon (so that when you run your finger down the back of the spoon it leaves a line through the ice cream base). This won't take more than a few minutes so don't go anywhere, just keep stirring.",
      "Once the ice cream base coats the back of a spoon lick the spoon, and remove the ice cream base from the heat. Transfer the base to a container and set it in the refrigerator until it is cooled completely. I suggest letting it chill overnight. Impatience is your enemy here.",
      "Next make the blackberry syrup. Place the blackberries into a small saucepan over medium heat. Stir them and smoosh them with a spoon until they are a pulpy mess. At this point add in the honey. I used about 1 1/2 Tbs of honey. I didn't put in a measurement under the ingredients because you may want it sweeter or not so sweet. I add in the honey and taste it until it is where I like it. Also some blackberries are sweeter than others, so you really have to keep an open mind about the amount of honey you plan on using. Once the mixture has come to a simmer remove it from the heat. Strain it to remove the pulp and the seeds. Store it until it is completely cooled in the refrigerator.",
      "The next day freeze your ice cream base in your ice cream maker according to the manufacturers instructions.",
      "When the ice cream is at a soft serve consistency turn off the ice cream maker and place 1/3 of the ice cream into a container. Drizzle a tablespoon or two of the blackberry syrup onto the ice cream. Layer another 1/3 of the ice cream into the container and repeat with the blackberry syrup. Then put the last 1/3 of the ice cream on top of that. Take a knife and swirl the blackberry syrup into the peony ice cream gently. Don't over-do it or it will combine too much.",
      "Once swirled to satisfaction place the container of peony ice cream into the freezer to harden. This will take 3-4 hours."

Place lid on cooker and vent slightly to reduce moisture (I used a chop stick under the lid to create a 1/4 inch gap) Heat on high for 3 hours stirring occasionally. The granola will crispen after cooling. Carefully pour your cooked granola out onto a large sheet pan and spread out to one layer thick. Cool and store in a sealed container.

    "ingredients": [],

      "Preheat the oven to 425\u00b0 F. Wash the sweet potatoes, and cut them in half lengthwise so that they are easier to work with. To make \"oblique cuts,\" cut into the sweet potatoes at acute angles. Each bite-size piece of sweet potato should look angular and unique. Toss the sweet potatoes in enough olive oil to lightly coat them, season with salt and the espelette pepper, and roast until they are beginning to caramelize and crisp around the edges, approximately 20 minutes. Let the sweet potatoes cool to room temperature.",
      "Remove the sausage from its casing (you can squeeze it out like toothpaste). Set a large skillet over high heat and add enough grapeseed oil to thinly coat the skillet. Heat the oil until it begins to lightly smoke. Add the sausage. Using a wooden spoon, press the sausage into flat pancake shapes. Let the sausage cook undisturbed until the bottom side of the sausage is deeply caramelized. Once you've got nice caramelization on one side of your sausage, break up the sausage in the pan using the wooden spoon so that there are no large pieces. If you've overcrowded the skillet, or if your skillet didn't initially get hot enough, then your sausage will be less beautiful. Set your cooked sausage aside and let it cool to room temperature.",
      "In a medium-sized mixing bowl, mix the yogurt with the za'atar and lemon juice. Add a tablespoon of olive oil. Season with salt. Taste and adjust as necessary.",
      "To serve: Dollop yogurt onto the plate, and use the back of a spoon to gently flatten and spread these dollops. Sprinkle roasted sweet potatoes over the yogurt. Sprinkle some of the sausage onto the plate. Add the sliced persimmon. Let these ingredients fall randomly onto the plate. Do not use a heavy hand. Garnish the plate with the chopped parsley. If you happen to have some olive oil nearby, drizzle some oil over the finished plate. Enjoy.",
      "When plating this dish, use what you feel are appropriate amounts of each ingredient. Do not feel like you have to use every piece of sweet potato or every slice of persimmon. If you happen to have some yogurt left over at the end, or some extra sausage, that's okay."

As soon as lines start to appear in the mixture when stirred, remove from heat and allow to cool to room temperature.",

Make a well in the flour mixture and pour in the wet ingredients. Stir until the mixture forms a loose, shaggy dough, then use the dough hook of the stand mixer to knead until the dough forms a semi-smooth ball. Add the butter to the dough, one tablespoon at a time, kneading after each addition. Knead until the butter is fully incorporated and the dough becomes smooth and elastic.",
      "Place the dough in a large bowl with plenty of room and cover loosely with plastic wrap or a damp towel. Let rise for 1-2 hours in a warm, draft-free area, or until doubled in size. Alternatively, let the dough rise overnight in the refrigerator; the dough should be fine for up to 24 hours. Line a round cake pan or square brownie pan with parchment paper.",
      "Once the dough has doubled, punch it down and divide into 24 even pieces. You can either use a food scale or divide the dough in half three times and then into thirds (2 * 2 * 2 * 3 = 24). Working one a a time, roll out the dough into a flat circle about 3 inches in diameter. If you can, try to make the edges thinner than the middle, but it's not super critical.",

      "Arrange the stuffed dough balls seam side-down in the prepared pan just so they touch each other. You may run out of room in the pan (I could only fit 19 balls, so I set the remaining in a smaller baking dish). Brush the top of the rolls with olive oil and let the dough proof again until they are almost doubled, about another hour or so. Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F.",
      "Bake the rolls for about 25-35 minutes, until golden brown. Serve warm with butter and any leftover cranberry sauce and/or gravy."

Finally, shut down the stove, remove the pot from heat and let sit so it can cool down a bit.",

After 1 minute, toss the carrot in and keep stirring for 2 more minutes before tossing onion in at last.\r\n\r\nStir until fragrant (but make sure the onion slices don't turn brown), then add ground pork. Sprinkle some pinches of pepper and salt, and continue to stir for 3 - 5 minutes based on your usual habit of having meat done to a turn or a bit underdone.\r\n\r\nRemove the pan from the stove and let chill.",
      "Make balls\r\n\r\nFor each ball, get 3-4 tablespoons of cooked sticky rice and use your palm to roll it into a ball. Press to flatten the rice ball, then stuff the filling that has been done at step 3, together with 1-2 cubes of Cheddar cheese right in the center. Finally, roll up to enclose them.\r\n\r\nCoat each ball with flour, roll in the milk and egg mixture, then a final coat of flour as a finish.\r\n\r\nGet your rice balls to a large saucepan with plenty of oil and deep fry them. As the oil starts to shimmer, scoop the balls out on paper to drain, then serve immediately while they're still hot.",
      "Notes\r\nAny batch of Arancini can be stored in the fridge overnight. Next day you take them out, just heat them in the microwave without defrosting first.\r\nBut, simultaneously, for each batch of Arancini, you should only stick them in and out within 3 days of use for best quality and flavor. So please remember to consider on the yield, as well as the number of your table's mates to prevent overfeeding.\r\nSince Arancini is already a sizzling serving, getting a sweet cinch to side is definitely a legit step. A tomato-spearmint cocktail would be wonderful, I suppose."

For smaller batches, ratio the ingredients and broil in a toaster oven.",
      "Prepare the chicken wings: Wash wings and pat dry with a paper towel. Using your hands and a small paring knife, carefully separate the skin from the chicken meat by rolling the skin down like a sock as you trim the meat off the bone of the first and second joints. Remove the bones from the first and second joints, leaving only the wing tip intact. Unroll the chicken skin; this will serve as the casing for the filling. Move the trimmed chicken meat aside onto a chopping board and mince to be added to the filling. Move the prepared chicken wings to the side and pat dry, then sprinkle with kosher salt-the secret to crispy skin on roasted chicken is a dry bird and plenty of salt, then cooked under high heat.",
      "Prepare the cilantro pesto: Grind the cilantro, garlic, and ground black pepper briefly in a mortar with a pestle; or use a blender. Set aside to add to the filling.",
      "Prepare the filling: Soak the glass noodles in a bowl of warm water for 10 to 30 minutes, following the instructions on the package. Make sure the noodles are made with mung bean starch, not rice, or the noodles will not be transparent when cooked. Boil 2 quarts of water in a medium-sized pot and, when bubbling, quickly add the pre-soaked glass noodles. Cook for 1 to 2 seconds only, and remove noodles with a fine-mesh sieve. Drain completely-wet, overcooked noodles will turn the filling mushy. Set aside in a large mixing bowl, and use kitchen shears to trim the noodles into approximately 1/2-inch long segments. If using dried wood ear mushrooms, soak the mushrooms per instructions on the package prior to preparation. Wood ear mushrooms have a jellyfish-like texture when cooked: slightly rubbery with a crisp and crunchy bite, and hints of earthiness. When the glass noodles have cooled to room temperature, add the minced chicken, ground pork, scallions, cabbage, wood ear mushrooms, carrots, cilantro pesto, oyster sauce, soy sauce, fish sauce, sugar, and raw eggs. Use your hands to mix thoroughly.",
      "Prepare the fish-sauce caramel: Heat a small saucepan over medium heat. Add the brown sugar, and cook until the sugar begins to melt and caramelize. Turn the heat down to medium-low and slowly stir the sugar until it begins to bubble, about 4 minutes. Remove saucepan from heat, and slowly pour in the fish sauce while stirring slowly with a spatula. Add the sliced chile pepper. Stir until the caramel is thoroughly dissolved. The sauce should be glossy and slightly thin, not thick and hard. Pour into a small bowl.",
      "To cook the chicken, heat the oven to 400\u00b0F. Line a sheet pan with aluminum foil and use a knife to cut slits into the chicken so excess fat and juices can render out.",
      "Stuff each chicken wing using your fingers. Scoop a generous amount of the filling and gently press down into the empty skin casing of each wing until filled to the top. Resist the urge to use chopsticks or metal utensils, which can tear the delicate wing skin. Leave a bit of skin on top of each wing to pull over; this will prevent the filling from spilling out during cooking. A toothpick can also be used to pin the skin together at the top of each wing.",
      "Lay the wings flat onto the sheet pan. If all 20 wings don't fit, cook in batches. Baste the stuffed chicken wings with fish sauce caramel and bake for 20 minutes. Turn the stuffed chicken wings over, and baste with the remainder fish sauce caramel. Bake for another 20 minutes.",
      "Remove from oven. Garnish with cilantro leaves and stems, chopped roasted salted peanuts, and thinly sliced Thai bird chiles (optional). Serve hot with sweet chili sauce as an appetizer, or add sticky rice and sliced cucumbers for a complete meal. Try to resist eating all 20 wings yourself (!)."

      "If you have \"winter\" snails, put them in a -covered, so not to leave- basket and feed them with raw broken spaghetti (and flour, but avoid it because it gets muddy when mixed with their secretions and stuff and cleaning them is... + with herbs, avoid oregano - it embitters them). In about a week they will be ready, with a clean intestine to go on. The best, however, are the \"summer\" sleeping ones, which are fed, clean from their poop and with a membrane at the edge of the shell.",
      "With a damp cloth clean the snails' shells from dried saliva and potential poop.",
      "To avoid boiling them, but to ensure that they are all alive -duh-, scratch with your nail, the membrane that is formed outside of the shell. If it moves, well the snail is more than alive. You can also identify by smell any dead one. It's rather an acute smell.",
      "In the end of frying, never ever add wine. Only vinegar.",
      "Having your snails' shells clear, there you go. Cover the pan's bottom with fine salt and array your living snails face down. As snails sit like this and because they don't like salt they will flip in their shells and they will take in a pinch of salt too. And right here resides the whole recipe's taste and success. Boiling doesn't give you that, see? Put the pan on the hot cook and leave them for 3-4 minutes only with the salt.",
      "Add olive oil and cover halfway all snails. When the oil starts sizzling, decrease the stove's temperature and cook for approximately 10 minutes. Try a snail. Their meat will be ready when tight and crisp.",
      "Turn up the heat; add 1/2 of wineglass vinegar (not wine) and a pinch of dried rosemary.",
      "Mix them while the vinegar sizzles, allow one more minute and when the vinegar evaporates, the snails are ready.",
      "Serve along with the oil and the ingredients of the pan (a.k.a. where the whole flavor is hidden).",
      "P.S. The shrilling sounds that you hear during frying, are not the snails' screamings, 'cause simply snails don't make sounds from their mouths. So don't freak up. It's hot air, which tries to get out of the shell. Stay, cool!",

      "Creme brulee is an even more extraordinary dessert if the custard is cold and firm when you crack into the warm caramelized sugar topping. Here's the secret: Place the custards in a roasting pan filled with ice, and then broil them. The ice keeps the custards cold while the sugar melts.",
      "You can bake the creme brulees ahead of time, but wait until just a few minutes before serving to caramelize the sugar. The caramelized sugar will begin to liquefy if the custards sit for more than an hour.",
