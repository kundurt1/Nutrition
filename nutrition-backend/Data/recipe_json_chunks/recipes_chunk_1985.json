      "Do not overprocess or the potato will become gummy.",
      "Add the olive oil and vinegar in a thin stream while the machine is running, then transfer the mixture to a bowl.",
      "Just before serving, heat the reduced wine slightly and beat it into the rouille, drop by drop, to loosen it.",
      "Bring a medium saucepan of lightly salted water to a boil.",
      "Add the whole potatoes and simmer for 10 minutes.",
      "Drain well, cut in half, and set aside.",
      "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.",
      "Heat a heavy 12 inch skillet, preferably castiron, over medium high heat and add half the olive oil.",
      "Sear the onion slices until almost charred, pressing them down with the back of a spatula and turning to the other side when blackened.",
      "Separate the onions into rings and add the garlic and rosemary.",
      "Cook, stirring frequently, for 1 minute.",
      "Transfer the vegetables to a plate and wipe the pan with a paper towel.",
      "Add the remaining olive oil and, again over medium high heat, lightly season and then sear the monkfish tails, turning with tongs to be sure all sides brown evenly.",
      "Return the onion mixture to the skillet around the fish and add the potatoes.",
      "Season generously with salt and pepper.",
      "The fish should not be crowded or it will steam rather than roast.",
      "Transfer the skillet to the oven and roast for about 15 minutes, or until the fish is cooked through and the potatoes are tender.",
      "Serve the rouille on the side.",
      "Note: Bell peppers can be roasted over a gas flame or on a tray under the broiler.",
      "Keep turning so the skin is evenly charred, without burning and drying out the flesh.",
      "Transfer the charred peppers to a plastic bag, tie the top closed and let steam until cool to the touch, about 15 minutes.",
      "(If you are rushed, you can place the bag in a bowl of iced water to speed things up.)",
      "The best way to peel is just to pull off the charred skin by hand and then dip the peppers briefly in water to remove any blackened bits.",
      "Do not peel the pepper under running water since that will wash away flavorful juices."

      "Roll up and secure the rollatini with toothpicks, and place them all in a baking dish, close together in one layer.",
      "Drizzle over them 2 tablespoons of the garlic oil, scatter in a spoonful of the oily garlic slices, drop in the thyme branches, and turn the rollatini to coat with oil on all sides.",

      "The crumbs should be toasted but not burned.",
      "If the fish and crumbs are darkening much faster, lower the heat, raise the rack, or spread the coals out.",
      "Using tongs, rotate the rollatini 180 degrees, so the first marks are on top; grill and mark the opposite side for about 2 minutes.",
      "Turn 90 degrees and grill about 1 1/2 minutes on a third side.",
      "Finally, rotate them all top to bottom again, so the remaining unmarked side of each roll is on the grill.",

      "Drizzle garlic oil in tiny amounts on the rollatini, if you wish, after each turn.",
      "After being grilled on all sides, about 6 to 7 minutes total, the rollatini should be cooked through but moist in the middle (you can cut one open if you are concerned about doneness).",

      "Serve at room temperature, one or two per person, with sauce on top.",
      "For longer marinating, refrigerate the sauced rollatini after 3 hours at room temperature and serve the next dayleftovers will keep and taste fine for about 4 days, properly sealed.",

      "It is also simple to figure out how much tuna to buy: just multiply 3 ounces by the number of rollatini you need and ask the fishmonger for a single piece of tuna that total weight.",
      "Then mark off equal pieces and slice the chunk crosswise.",
      "For example, the chunk in the photo on page 306 is 1 1/2 pounds, or 24 ounces, and I cut it in eight equal scallops.",
      "To make twelve rollatini (to serve six or more), Id start with a 36-ounce, or 2 1/4-pound, section of tuna loin.",
      "If pre-cut tuna steaks are all you can find, make your 3-ounce scallops by laying each steak flat and slicing it in layers as you would a cake.",
      "You could also have the fishmonger slice the scallops.",
      "However, uncut tuna stays fresher longer, so I recommend that you buy one solid piece and cut it yourself.",
      "For rollatinias for marinated Tonno sottOlio (page 10)I prefer loin pieces with the belly flap, or ventresca, attached.",
      "The flesh has more fat and flavor and is easier to grill without drying it out.",
      "If its a small tuna, you should be able to cut the loin and ventresca as one slice; if the tuna is big, then separate the ventresca and cut it separately.",
      "The ventresca is a bit flatter, so cut on a bias.",
      "When grilling is not possible, baked rollatini can be almost as delicious.",
      "Follow the same preparation as for grilling.",
      "Arrange the rolls an inch or so apart in a shallow baking pan (lightly filmed with garlic oil) and bake in a preheated 400 oven for about 10 minutes, or until the crumbs are crusty and nicely colored and the fish is just cooked through but still moist.",
      "Serve any way you like: marinated under tomato-lemon salsa or hot from the oven."

      "Because the dumplings can leak if they sit uncooked, assemble and cook them in small batches.",
      "For each batch, use one piece of dough.",
      "Roll the dough into a 6-inch-long log, then cut it into 6 even-size pieces.",
      "To make a dumpling, hold a piece of dough, with one of the cut ends up, near your fingertips.",
      "Use the thumb or an index finger to make a shallow well in the dough.",
      "Put a ball of palm sugar in the well, gently pressing it down to sink it into the dough.",
      "Push and press the dough to fully enclose the sugar and seal well.",
      "Roll the ball between your hands to even out the surface.",
      "Repeat with the remaining dough pieces to make five more dumplings.",
      "When the batch is assembled, add the dumplings, one at a time, to the boiling water.",
      "To make sure the dumplings do not stick, jiggle the saucepan or gently stir with a spoon.",
      "After about 2 minutes, the dumplings should float to the surface.",
      "When this happens, let them cook for 1 more minute.",
      "Then use a slotted spoon to lift the dumplings, either individually or in pairs, from the water, pausing above the pan to shake off excess water.",
      "Deposit the dumplings in the coconut.",
      "Dredge each one in coconut, then transfer to a plate.",
      "Repeat with the remaining dumplings before assembling the next batch.",
      "If you are not serving them right away, cover the dumplings with plastic wrap to prevent them from drying.",
      "They are best on the day they are prepared.",
      "However, left over dumplings should be kept at room temperature for no more than 2 days.",
      "They will harden and become inedible if chilled."
