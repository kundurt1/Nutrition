Spread the apple mixture into a thin layer in the bottom of the prepared cake pan and bake in the oven for 10 minutes; The sugar and butter should be melted and the apples should start to soften. There may be a little liquid that has seeped out of the apples, that is fine.",
      "Let the pan cool while you make the cake.",
      "Make the Spice Cake:",
      "Put the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and spices in a medium bowl and whisk until blended together. In a large mixing bowl whisk the oil and sugar together, it's actually easier to do this by hand than with an electric mixer. If you really like the mixer, use it. Add both of the eggs and whisk until smooth, you don't have to spend a lot of time on this, just whisk it together. Add the buttermilk and vanilla and whisk until incorporated. Add the dry ingredients in two installments, whisking until blended.",
      "Carefully pour the batter over the apple layer. If you dump it on top, you run the risk of displacing the apples and ruining the pretty apple design! (it will still taste good).",
      "Return the pan to the oven and bake at 350 degrees for 20 to 30 minutes until the center of the cake is fully cooked. Once the cake has cooled for 20 minutes, flip it out of the cake pan and onto a cooling rack. Remove the parchment. Let cool fully while you make the frosting.",
      "Make the Cinnamon Buttercream Frosting:",
      "Find a pot that will fit the bottom of the bowl of a KitchenAid, fill it with three inches of water and bring to a simmer. Place the egg whites and the sugar in the mixer bowl and place over the simmering pot of water. Stir the mixture until the sugar has dissolved and the mixture is warm, about 4 minutes.",
      "Place the bowl on the mixer fitted with the whisk attachment and beat on medium high until cool (about 8 to 10 minutes). Cut the butter into 1 inch cubes and gradually add to the mixer. Mix until the butter has incorporated and the frosting is light and fluffy (about 5 minutes). Add the salt, vanilla and cinnamon and whisk until combined.",
      "Assemble the PieCaken:",
      "It is easier to assemble the PieCaken if the pies are chilled.",
      "With a small knife, cut the outer crust off the pies, leaving only the filling and the bottom crust. With a serrated knife, cut off what was the top of the cake, which is now on the bottom. Do this by cutting straight through the cake horizontally about a half inch up the side of the cake. Reserve the scraps for snacking.",
      "On an 8 inch cake board or serving plate, place the pecan pie. Spread a 1/2 inch layer of frosting over the top of the pie. Place the pumpkin pie on top and spread a 1/2 inch of frosting on top. Place the cake, apple side up, on top of the frosting. With a serrated knife, trim the sides of the cake to be flush with the pies.",
      "Eat the scraps.",
      "Using an offset spatula, spread a 1/2 inch layer of frosting around the cake, covering the sides. Using a piping bag with whatever tip you want, pipe a pretty border around the top of the cake. I like to leave the top of the cake unfrosted so you can see the apples.",
      "Refrigerate the PieCaken for at least an hour or tightly wrapped for up to 5 days.",
      "Let sit at room temperature for an hour before serving so the buttercream softens.",
      "Cut the PieCaken into 8 to 12 slices using a sharp knife dipped in hot water.",
      "Serve with whipped cream or ice cream!"

      "Butter a 7 1/2 cup steamed pudding mold and set aside. In a medium saucepan combine the cranberries, sugar, orange juice and cinnamon. Set over medium-high heat, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium, and simmer uncovered, stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes, or until cranberries break down and mixture thickens. Remove from heat and cool completely.",
      "Evenly spread 1/2 cup of the cooled cranberry mixture onto the bottom of the pudding mold, and set aside. Reserve remaining cooked cranberry mixture for batter. Meanwhile, prepare the hot-water bath: Fill a large, 11-by-5 1/4-inch pot one-third full with water. Set over high heat, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, and keep at a simmer until pudding is ready to cook.",
      "In a large bowl beat together the butter and brown sugar with an electric mixer until creamy and smooth, about 3 minutes. Add the eggs and vanilla and beat well. Add the remaining cooked cranberry mixture and beat well. Stir together the flour, baking powder and salt. Alternate adding the flour mixture and the milk to the batter, beating well after each addition. By hand stir in the dried cranberries, dried cherries and pecans.",

Put cover on mold or if there is no cover, cover with a round of parchment paper and then aluminum foil, and secure with a rubber band. Carefully place mold in water bath on towel. Water should come about half way up the sides of the mold. Cover the water bath and keep water at a simmer for 2 hours 20 minutes or until a cake tester inserted into pudding comes out clean. Watch water levels and add more hot water to water bath as needed to keep water level half way up the sides of the mold.",
      "Remove mold from water and cool on a wire rack. Run a knife around edge of pudding in mold to loosen. Invert onto a platter and serve warm. Alternately, pudding may be unmolded, covered with plastic and chilled overnight. Serve cold or reheat cut slices lightly in microwave before serving."

(visually you are looking for a mixture that comes together when you stir and push it around with the spatula). This will take about 10-15 minutes. Add in the corn syrup and cook again until mixture appears sticky and dry. This will take about another 10 minutes. Add in the flour, stir and cook for about 7 more minutes.

Place the flattened piece of dough in our hand, and place the ball of filling on top and fold over and bring the dough together to encase the filling. Roll the filled cake ball in your hands, to even out any seams. Shape the filled cake into an equal square. Place on a parchment lined baking sheet at least one inch apart, and bake at 350\u00b0 F for 15 minutes on one side, then using a small offset spatula, carefully flip over and bake on the other side for 15 minutes more.

A slow cooker will get hotter and start to cook the ingredients, thus resulting in an inferior product. Please be aware of what kind of appliance you have. It seems the older \"crockpot\" works best. There have been some who have burned their ingredients because their appliance is too hot. The makers and manufacturers of these appliances seem to interchange the description of their appliances calling slow cookers crockpots. It seems that Rival owns the name crockpot, therefore, others can't use the name crockpot, they are slow cookers. It's very confusing, but slow cookers, indeed, cook hotter, which could result in burning of this recipe."

Continue stirring until the polenta is thick and tender, about half an hour. Remove from the heat, then stir in the pureed pumpkin and the butter, and add a little salt and pepper. Remember that you will be layering it with salty feta, so use a light hand. Pour the polenta onto a large baking sheet and smooth it into a 1/2 inch layer. Allow it to stiffen (30 minutes or more), then cut into rectangles about 2x3 inches in size.",

Saute for a minute or two, then add the spinach. Put the lid on the pan, and cook for several minutes, turning the leaves with tongs every couple of minutes to stop them sticking. When the leaves are wilted and tender, remove them from the heat and tip them out into a large colander to drain any liquid.",

Spoon a little of the vegetable mixture into one end of the dish, then start overlapping layers of the polenta slices with layers of the vegetable mixture, leaving some of the filling showing between layers of polenta. You'll have to judge how upright to layer the slices based on the size of your dish. Once you have used up all the filling and polenta, sprinkle the remaining cheese over the top. Bake at 350F for about 30 minutes. It should be bubbling hot, and the cheese on top will be golden brown in spots. Let it sit for 5 minutes, then serve."

Brown the chops on both sides in a little bit of oil in a skillet large enough for the chops to nestle together in a single layer. If you choose a pan you can also serve in, life is even easier. Once they're browned and \"nestled\", slice the two onions and spread them over the chops; add 1/3 cup of water, cover the pan and simmer over low heat for 25 minutes. Remove the cover and add the zucchini, sliced (I slice it 1/2\" to 3/4\" thick). Now go back to that bag of ingredients that you've saved; add the additional 3 Tb Parmesan cheese, the 1/2 tsp paprika and the 1/2 tsp dill weed. Shake it up to mix it all together and sprinkle the concoction over everything in the pan. DON'T STIR. Just let it sit there on top of the zucchini.

      "For the steaks: Measure the flour, 5 teaspoons salt, 1 teaspoon black pepper, and cayenne into a large shallow dish. In a second large shallow dish, beat the egg, baking powder, and baking soda; stir in the buttermilk (the mixture will bubble and foam).",
      "Set a wire rack over a rimmed baking sheet. Pat the steaks dry with paper towels and sprinkle each side with salt and pepper to taste. Drop the steaks into the flour and shake the pan to coat. Shake excess flour from each steak, then, using tongs, dip the steaks into the egg mixture, turning to coat well and allowing the excess to drip off. Coat the steaks with flour again, shake off the excess, and place them on the wire rack.",
      "Adjust an oven rack to the middle position, set a second wire rack over a second rimmed baking sheet, and place the sheet on the oven rack; heat the oven to 200 degrees. Line a large plate with a double layer of paper towels. Meanwhile, heat 1 inch of oil in a large (11-inch diameter) Dutch oven over medium-high heat to 375 degrees. Place three steaks in the oil and fry, turning once, until deep golden brown on each side, about 5 minutes (oil temperature will drop to around 335 degrees). Transfer the steaks to the paper towel-lined plate to drain, then transfer them to the wire rack in the oven. Bring the oil back to 375 degrees and repeat the cooking and draining process (use fresh paper towels) with the three remaining steaks.",
      "For the gravy: Carefully pour the hot oil through a fine-mesh strainer into a clean pot. Return the browned bits from the strainer along with 2 tablespoons of frying oil back to the Dutch oven. Turn the heat to medium, add the onion and thyme, and cook until the onion has softened and is beginning to brown, 4 to 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook until aromatic, about 30 seconds. Add the flour to the pan and stir until well combined and starting to dissolve, about 1 minute. Whisk in the broth, scraping any browned bits off the bottom of the pan. Whisk in the milk, salt, pepper, and cayenne; bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Cook until thickened (gravy should have a loose consistency-it will thicken as it cools), about 5 minutes.",
      "Transfer the chicken-fried steaks to individual plates. Spoon a generous amount of gravy over each steak. Serve immediately, placing any remaining gravy in a small bowl. **I serve this with no gravy on the steak, I put the gravy in a bowl on the side for each plate. This way the crust stays crispy and the person eating can pour it or dip their steak into it."

      "Set a large soup pot over medium-high heat. Add the chicken thighs, skin side down, and season with salt. Cook for 3 to 4 minutes on each side, until golden, stirring them around a little so the meat won't stick to the bottom. (Be careful not to burn yourself with the sizzling chicken fat.).",
      "Remove the chicken from the pot and set aside on a plate. Pour out and discard the excess fat from the pot. Lower the heat to medium-low. Melt the butter in the pot, add the garlic and onions, season with salt, and stir. Cover and cook for 25 minutes, stirring from time to time to avoid colouring, until the onions are very soft.",
      "While the onions are cooking, remove the skin from the chicken thighs- don't worry if you can't remove all of it. When the onions are soft, add the flour, if using, and stir to blend. Add the chicken, bay leaves, wine, and stock. Grind the peppercorns with a mortar and pestle or spice grinder, or by crushing them on a cutting board with a rolling pin. Reserve 1 teaspoon for garnish, and add the rest to the pot. Bring the soup to a simmer, cover, and cook for 30 to 35 minutes, until the chicken is cooked through. Let it simmer for 20 more minutes, uncovered. (The recipe can be made a day ahead up to this point. Let cool, cover, and refrigerate. The next day, skim the chicken fat from the surface.).",
      "Preheat the oven on the broiler setting. Remove the chicken thighs from the pot and bone them with a fork and knife. Discard the bones and any remaining strips of skin, and cut the meat into bite-size chunks. Return the meat to the pot, stir, taste the broth, and adjust the seasoning. Ladle the soup into ovenproof bowls or soup plates, top each with a slice of bread, and sprinkle with grated cheese.",
      "Put the bowls under the broiler for a few minutes, watching them closely, until the cheese is melted, bubbly in places, and lightly golden. (If your oven isn't large enough to accommodate all the bowls, work in batches: the first bowls will be a bit less hot than the last, but still hot enough.) Sprinkle with the reserved peppercorns and serve: set each bowl on a folded napkin if your table needs to be protected from heat, and warn your guests that the bowls and soup will be very hot."

      "How ironic my introductory words: \"looks after itself\". True, but it seems crock pots sometimes have minds of their own and produce something other than what we had planned for them to make! From reading many reviews on Zaar, I've come to the conclusion that the results from crock pot recipes are sometimes more unpredictable than recipes made in other ways. I've not had anything like Rita's experience on this occasion, but rather the opposite, which is of course easier to deal with: I've several times had to continue cooking on low or to raise the setting to high with other crock pot recipes. And I've at times cooked crock pot recipes for hours longer than was specified, which has left me wondering how similar or different the low setting is on different brands of crock pot. Rita's experience suggests that the cooking time needs to be seriously adjusted so until I have a chance to check out this recipe and report back, which I will do VERY soon, I'm changing the cooking time from the four to six hours suggested in the original recipe to TWO to three hours, or until the apples are tender. I thank Rita for so graciously accepting the unforeseen fate of her beautiful apples. Such an enticing before picture! And when she looked into her crock pot - her second picture - after three hours cooking: what a shock! I'm just so glad that she hadn't gone off for six hours and left her apples and the crock pot to do their own thing - and I'm so pleased that at least the cooked apple sauce was delicious."
