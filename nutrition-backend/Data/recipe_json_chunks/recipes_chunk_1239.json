As you work, cover the open \"seam\" at the side by pressing the bacon strips over it, and tucking them in slightly.",

      "Drain off fat. The roll should wait a little before you slice it, but keep warm. Serve with side veggies and salad, and gravy if you like."

Ideally, you will time this to coincide with the sugar syrup reaching 248\u00b0-250\u00b0 F, the Firm Ball Stage. If your whites reach stiff peaks before the sugar syrup reaches the correct temperature, reduce the mixer speed to the lowest setting and leave running until the syrup is ready.",
      "When the syrup reaches 248\u00b0-250\u00b0 F, increase the mixer speed to the highest setting. Remove the saucepan from the heat and slowly pour the hot syrup down the side of the bowl into the egg whites, being very careful to avoid allowing the stream to hit the whisk and spatter. Pour slowly and steadily until all the syrup has been added, and continue beating the meringue until it becomes light and fluffy and holds its shape exactly when the beater is removed, roughly 3-5 minutes.",
      "After this time, the meringue may still be hot-if so, place the bowl in the refrigerator (or freezer) for 10-15 minutes until it has cooled all the way through.",
      "When the meringue has cooled, place the bowl back on the mixer, replacing the whisk with the paddle attachment. Begin mixing on low, and add the butter 1/4 cup (half a stick) at a time, beating well after each addition. Once the butter is added, increase the speed to medium and beat the buttercream until it becomes light and fluffy. It may look soupy or curdled shortly after all the butter is added-this is okay! Just keep on beating it and it will whip up into a light, fluffy cloud.",
      "Add the pinch of salt and vanilla, if including, and beat on low speed until incorporated. You may now add any other flavorings, gel or liquid food colorings, shaved chocolate, chopped nuts, fruit purees, or any other goodies you like to add to your buttercream.

Mix the potatoes into the sauce after transferring the fillets to the dinner plates. A can of white beans makes a great replacement for the peas; drain and rinse them before adding them to the sauce. This dish is also wonderful made with boneless, skinless chicken breasts or semi-boneless quail; poach the birds in the sauce as described or, for added flavor, brown them in oil in the large skillet, then remove them and, without washing the skillet, cook down the pureed salsa. Tahini is an easy addition because it's smoothly ground, but you can use the very traditional pumpkin seeds or almonds or peanuts; puree them with the salsa, but stir carefully as you cook the mixture down to a paste (it will stick more easily than the salsa alone) After the sauce has simmered 10 minutes, it will likely be quite coarse looking; reblend the hot sauce in a loosely covered blender to smooth it out."

Add flour a little at a time until dough is soft but easy to handle, kneading it in with your hands.

As you roll, lift edges and check periodically to make sure dough is not sticking to the board. Add flour to the top or bottom as needed to keep dough from sticking. Use as little flour as possible. Too much flour worked into the dough will make it hard.",

If pan gets too hot during cooking, remove from burner for a few minutes to cool slightly, but pan should be hot when you place the tortilla on the surface.",

      "PREPARE POTATOES: Add whole peeled potatoes to boiling lightly salted water. Boil about 20-25 minutes or until fully cooked but still firm (overcooking will cause slicing thin to be more difficult). Put potatoes in the fridge to cool (this can be done the day before).",
      "PREPARE RICE: Cook rice as directed (this can be done the day before). Dice a 1/2 red pepper and 1/4 cup red onion. Put in a container and add 1 tbsp fresh chopped cilantro or 1 tsp dried cilantro. Store container in fridge until ready to fry rice (this can be done the day before).",
      "PREPARE MEAT: Lightly dust both sides of meat with Adobo Seasoning Con Cumin (just tap it out, don't shake on).",
      "Pour some of the bread crumbs onto a plate. Lay one slice of meat over the crumbs, sprinkle more bread crumbs on top and pound into meat using a meat mallet (or make a fist and pound with the side of your hand). Flip the meat over and sprinkle more bread crumbs on the other side if needed and pound again so that both sides are well covered in crumbs and meat is flattened out. Repeat on each slice of meat. Store in fridge until ready to cook (this can be done the day before).",
      "PREPARE SALSA: Dice tomatoes, onions and jalapenos and mix together. Store in the fridge until ready to serve (this can be done the day before). (Time Saver: Use a food processor to chop onions and jalapeno and then stir hand diced tomatoes).",
      "DAY OF COOKING:",
      "FRY RICE: Heat 2-3 tablespoons vegetable oil over medium heat in a large non-stick skillet. Add cooked rice and prepared red pepper, red onion & cilantro. Toss well. Add 1/2 tsp salt (or to taste) and Cook 10-15 minutes tossing frequently. Remove and keep warm in covered serving dish.",
      "FRY POTATOES: While the rice is cooking, heat another skillet over moderately high heat and pour oil so that it covers the entire bottom and is about 1/8 deep. Slice cooled potatoes about 1/2\" thick. Add slices one at a time until you have 1 layer on the bottom of the pan and there is space between each one. Cook for about 2 minutes on each side or until golden brown. Remove from skillet and place on a paper towel lined plate to soak up excess oil. Repeat with remaining potatoes. Cover and keep warm.",
      "FRY MEAT: When rice is done, add about oil to emptied skillet so that it is about 1/4-1/2\" deep and heat so that it is hot, but not smoking. Place a few slices of meat in skillet and cook about 1.5 minutes or until edges become golden brown and meat actually lifts up in the center. Flip and cook on other side about 1 minute or until cooked through. Remove from skillet and place on a paper towel lined plate to soak up excess oil. Repeat with remaining meat. Cover and keep warm.",
      "FRY EGGS: (Begin this just before serving your meal) When the potatoes are done, use the same skillet for the eggs reducing heat to medium low. (TIP: Make sure skillet has cooled before adding eggs - you don't want them to cook too fast or the egg whites will become hard before the yolks are cooked). Add eggs individually so they remain separate and fry just until yolks are cooked, flipping once. Serve immediately.",
      "PLATING THE FOOD: On each plate, serve about 2-3 pieces of meat topped with prepared salsa, about a cup of rice, 5 potato slices and 2 eggs (salted if desired)."

    "title": "frank's stuffed creole tomatoes",
    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "The first thing you want to do is trim the tops off the tomatoes, scrape out all the inside pulp with a melon baller, and set the tomatoes onto a cookie sheet in the refrigerator to chill.",
      "Next, in a 12-inch non-stick skillet, melt the margarine, drop in the onions and garlic, and saute them over high heat until the onions begin to wilt (it isn't necessary to caramelize them-and besides, you don't want to burn the garlic). When you're feel as though the onions have softened sufficiently, pour into the skillet all the pulp you removed from inside the tomatoes and cook it down until the majority of the liquid evaporates (which should take about 10 minutes over a medium-high heat).",
      "Now once the tomato pulp has reduced, add to the skillet the crawfish tails (along with any crawfish fat left inside the package), stir everything together well, and cook the mixture just until the crawfish come up to heat-don't overcook them or they'll become tough and rubbery. When they're ready, turn off the fire, remove the skillet from the burner, and allow them to cool to room temperature.",
      "Then, when you're ready to stuff the tomatoes, take a large mixing bowl and a rubber spatula and add all the egg salad ingredients to the bowl-the eggs, mayo, soup base, red onion, celery, parsley, Dijon mustard, hot sauce, and lemon juice. Now very gently and for a very short time, fold the ingredients together-do not stir...fold! You don't want to mash the egg yolks. When the ingredients are thoroughly blended, add the contents of the crawfish skillet to the mixture and fold everything together again-this time until the mix is totally uniform.",
      "All that's left to do is season the stuffing to taste with salt and black pepper and mound the mixture by heaping spoonfuls into the chilled tomato hulls. Sprinkle the tomatoes lightly with a little paprika and serve each stuffed tomato on top crispy lettuce leaf with buttered crackers.",
      "Chef's Notes:",
      "(Personally, this not the chef speaking, Frank, this is the guy who posted this recipe, I would stuff the tomatoes as directed and bake them at 350 degrees for 20 to 30 minutes).",
      "Instead of crawfish tails, you can also use fresh shrimp sauteed down in the onions and garlic. Simply fold in the shrimp just as you would the crawfish tails.",
      "The stuffing turns out best if you finely chop up the pieces of the tomato pulp before cooking it down with the crawfish. I suggest you do the chopping by hand with a chef's knife-a food processor purees the tomatoes too finely.",
      "This recipe uses the minimum amount of mayonnaise. If you'd prefer your stuffing to be slightly more moist and creamy, you can stir in as much as twice the amount of mayo without changing the taste and texture of the recipe.",
      "The tomatoes may be served freshly made, but they seem to have a richer taste and flavor once they have been chilled, especially overnight. Just make sure you cover them well with plastic wrap.",
      "Oh-and I emphasize once again, fold the mixture gently. If you stir or mix it together the egg salad will turn pasty and lose it's palatability.",

Once chopped up fine, I add what I'm estimating as 1 to 2 teaspoons of jalapenos. For those of you who don't measure like me, it seems to be about 6 or 7 medium sized rings from the jar. However, I'm sure size differs from brand to brand. I also like to add a little bit of the juice from the jar, b/c I think that's what helps give it that restaurant flavor. Just a few dribbles.",
      "My suggestion is to go light on the jalapenos for your first try. Don't trust the first taste of the salsa -- wait until the next day and taste it. It gets hotter after it has had time to sit. So if the next day it isn't hot enough for you, add more chopped jalapenos or just add a little of the jalapeno juice from the jar.",
      "When it comes to salt be careful not to over salt -- though I've found if I go too light then it doesn't taste right (taste more like store bought). So again, go light and then add small amounts till it tastes right. Same thing with the garlic powder.",
      "Remember you can always add but ya can't take out. Course, my first batch was so hot that I had to add another 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes before we could eat it (I think that was about 2 tablespoons of jalapenos and some of the juice!).",
