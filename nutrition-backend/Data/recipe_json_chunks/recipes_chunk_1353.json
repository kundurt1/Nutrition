Pour about a tablespoon of flour into each of the pans and roll it around, tapping as you go, until the sides and bottom are covered completely with a thin layer of flour. Tip the pans, and tap out excess flour.",

Add the sugar in 1/2-cup measures, beating about 15 seconds after each addition and scraping down the sides of the bowl if necessary, until the mixture has lightened in color and become fluffy, about 2 minutes. Add the eggs and egg yolks, one at a time, and the vanilla, beating for 15 seconds after each addition.",
      "Add the flour mixture to the butter mixture in thirds, alternating with additions of the milk. To avoid overmixing the batter, mix gently with a wooden spoon or rubber spatula after each addition, until the ingredient is just incorporated. Beat until all the ingredients have been incorporated, and then just a few strokes beyond. Divide the batter between the cake pans and spread the tops evenly.",
      "Bake until a cake tester or toothpick emerges clean, about 30 minutes. Remove from the oven and let the cakes cool in their pans on a rack for 10 minutes, then slide a thin paring knife around the edge of the pans, and invert the cakes. Turn each cake again so its rounded top is facing up, and cool the cakes completely on the rack.",
      "Make the icing: Pour the milk and 3 cups of the sugar into a large, deep, heavy-bottomed pot over medium-high heat, mixing with a whisk. Add the butter and the salt, whisking occasionally until the butter melts. When mixture just simmers, cut the heat, but keep over the warm burner.",
      "Pour the remaining 1 cup sugar into a saucepan. Cook the sugar over medium-high heat until it becomes a syrup, stirring every so often with a wooden spoon as it begins to brown, until the sugar syrup is evenly amber colored, 5 to 8 minutes. Pour the syrup into the warm milk mixture, being very careful, as the caramel will bubble and sputter when it hits the hot milk. Turn the heat beneath the pot to high and, whisking gently until all the syrup has completely dissolved into the roiling milk mixture, continue to cook to the soft-ball stage, about 238\u00b0F; this may take 8 to 12 minutes.",
      "Cut the heat beneath the caramel and gently whisk in the vanilla and the baking soda. Dip a spoon into the caramel, and let it cool to taste it. Season the caramel to taste with salt, and pour it into the bowl of a standing mixer (or use an electric hand-mixer and a large bowl). Beat on low speed as it cools, 15 to 20 minutes depending on the temperature of your kitchen, until the icing is creamy and thick (between 100\u00b0F and 105\u00b0F). Remove the bowl from the mixer stand and let cool 5 to 10 minutes more, until the icing is between 95\u00b0F and 98\u00b0F-it should fall off your spatula in a ribbon that remains discernible on the surface of the icing for 10 seconds.",
      "Set the first cake layer on a rack set over a sheet plan lined with waxed paper. Have an electric hand-mixer and the hot water nearby to blend a teaspoon or two into the icing if it becomes too thick to spread. Pour enough of the icing over the cake to cover the top in a layer about 1/4 inch thick (if it drips over the edge in places, that's fine; this is an early test of whether it's going to set in place or not). Top the first cake with the second cake layer and pour the rest of the icing in stages over the top of the cake, letting it run down the sides and using an icing spatula to guide the icing around the cake as it drips, until the entire cake is covered, for a traditional, classic look. (If you prefer the dramatic look of cake layers peeking out from behind a curtain of icing drips, by all means choose that route!) If you need to reuse any icing that overflows into the pan, simply move the cake on its rack temporarily, scrape up the icing from the waxed paper with a spatula and return it to the bowl, replace the rack over the pan, and continue to ice the cake.",
      "Once the icing has set, using two spatulas carefully transfer the cake from the rack to a cake stand and let stand at room temperature beneath a cake dome until ready to serve. Only refrigerate if you plan to store the cake for more than 2 days."

(If the chiles float, puncture each with a small knife to let the water inside.) Steep the chiles until soft and pliable, about 30 minutes. Drain and let cool. Once the chiles are cool enough to handle, remove the stems and most of the seeds and transfer to a blender or the bowl of a food processor.",

Arrange the tomatoes on the broiler pan or a baking sheet and broil, flipping several times to expose all sides, until the entire surface is charred, 5 to 6 minutes. Let the tomatoes cool slightly then remove and discard the charred skin. Add the tomato flesh to the chiles in the blender or food processor. Add the garlic, oregano, cumin, cloves, and 1 cup water and process until smooth.",

Cover the pot with a lid and transfer to the oven. Cook until the meat is very tender and falling apart, about 3 hours. Discard the parchment then transfer the meat to a cutting board and use two forks to shred it into small pieces, discarding any excess fat. Skim any excess fat from the braising liquid then return the meat to the pot and stir to combine. Season with salt and pepper. DO AHEAD:",

When all the liquid has been added, use a rubber spatula to scrape any elusive bits of flour from around the edge into the centre, then whisk once more until the batter is smooth, with the consistency of thin cream. Now melt the 50g/2oz of butter in a pan. Spoon 2 tbsp of it into the batter and whisk it in, then pour the rest into a bowl and use it to lubricate the pan, using a wodge of kitchen paper to smear it round before you make each pancake.",

I find 2 tbsp is about right for an 18cm/7in pan. It's also helpful if you spoon the batter into a ladle so it can be poured into the hot pan in one go. As soon as the batter hits the hot pan, tip it around from side to side to get the base evenly coated with batter. It should take only half a minute or so to cook; you can lift the edge with a palette knife to see if it's tinged gold as it should be. Flip the pancake over with a pan slice or palette knife - the other side will need a few seconds only - then simply slide it out of the pan onto a plate.",

Brush dough with 3 tablespoons melted butter. Sprinkle cinnamon filling lengthwise over half of dough to within 1/2 in of long edge. Fold rectangle in half lengthwise to cover filling. Seal dough edges with the edge of a plate. With a pizza cutter, cut dough into 24 strips, about 3/4 inch wide. Twist each strip twice and place strips 1 inch apart on prepared baking sheets. Cover and let rise until doubled in bulk, about 30-40 minutes. Preheat oven to 375 deg. Bake 10-12 minutes, until golden brown. Brush on Powdered Sugar Glaze while rolls are still warm.

Using your hands, rub butter over entire chicken, including underneath the skin if you wish. Sprinkle the entire thing with salt and pepper. Set chicken in a roasting pan breast-side up, or roast it over a beer can like I did: I set a beer can with a few sips of beer left in my pan, shoved it up the chicken's you know and then roasted it. If desired you can layer some slices onions under the chicken, but I did not do this. The butter and sugar really caramelizes and I'm not sure any veggies would hold up underneath it. Roast for about 1 hour and 20 minutes. I use Ina Garten's tip of slicing the leg and if the juices run clear it's done! Let rest for about 15-20 minutes before cutting.",

If the cake still feels soft around the edge, let it bake for 10 minutes more (the cooking time will be about the same for both the 8- and 9-inch cheesecakes). Remove the cheesecake from the water bath, transfer to a wire rack, and let cool for 2 hours (just walk away-don't move it).

Refrigerate any leftover cake, tightly covered, and enjoy within 2 days, or wrap and freeze for up to 1 month."

Add 1/3 cup of vegetable oil to the water to total 1 cup of liquid. Mix the wet ingredients with the flour mixture to form a dough. Knead well and divide into 2 equal parts. On a clean, dry surface (good for rolling), sprinkle a generous amount of cornstarch. Roll out 1 part of the dough to form a large rectangle. Sprinkle the dough with cornstarch and fold in half. Sprinkle the folded dough with cornstarch again, and fold in half again. With a roling pin, roll the dough out to it's original rectangular size, keeping the layers intact. Repeat the cornstarch and rolling process. (For extra flaky dough, do this process 3 times for each part of the dough.) Lay 1 part of the rolled dough in a clean oblong baking dish, allowing the dough to come up the sides of the dish. It is important that the top crust be especially flaky, so make sure to repeat the cornstarch-rolling process at least 3 times. Set the top crust aside. Place the ham and cheese in alternating layers on the bottom crust. Beat the eggs together in a bowl and pour over the ham and cheese. (If you do not like eggs, you can skip them.)",

      "3. When the coals are ready, dump them into the bottom of your grill, and spread them evenly across half. Scatter the wood chips on the hot coals. Place the butt on the indirect side of the grill across from the coals. Increase the temperature to 350\u00b0F by opening the bottom vents on your grill. When the smoke starts to rise, close the lid. Place a candy thermometer in the lid vent. Smoke for 30 to 45 minutes to get the bark started.",
      "4. Reduce the temperature by closing the vents until you're at 225\u00b0F to 250\u00b0F. Smoke the pork for 4 hours. Place the butt in a brown paper grocery bag large enough to hold it, fold the ends over to close it, and return it to the same place in the smoker, opposite the fire. Add more briquets if necessary, and close the lid. Continue smoking for 2 to 4 more hours or until tender. Check for tenderness by pulling a piece of meat off and tasting it. The mark of a shoulder done to perfection is when you can remove the blade bone by pulling it out with your hand.",
      "5. When the shoulder is done, set it aside in a pan to rest for 30 minutes, then move it to a cutting board. Serve it Southern-style pulled (stringy portions torn off by hand), Kansas City-style thick sliced, or the-hell-with-it chopped. Some barbecuers like to mix in a little tangy barbecue sauce as they're chopping and combining the meat on a platter, especially if the pork is still a little fatty."

On the other hand, overcook them and they will eventually turn to mush. Two hours seems about right, although this might give nutritionists pause. Taste for salt.",
