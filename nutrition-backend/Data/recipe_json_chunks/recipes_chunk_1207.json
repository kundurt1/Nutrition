      "In a bowl mix together the refried beans, half of the package of taco seasoning, the salsa, and 3 tablespoons of the sour cream.",
      "(Reason for adding salsa/sourcream: layered dips can be too thick for dipping if you don't add something to thin them down a bit - the salsa and sour cream add both flavor and the thinning aspect, so you don't want to skip them. Also, you can add cayenne and/or ancho powder to taste. I usually add ancho because I love the smokey flavor.).",
      "Spread the mixture into a large rectangular glass lasagna dish.",
      "(If you used two cans of beans and not all of the dip will fit in the dish, spread the remaining on a dinner plate and you can make your *own* dip to keep at home while you take the rest to the party!).",
      "In a separate bowl mix the rest of the sour cream with the remaining taco seasoning.",
      "Spread the sour cream mixture on top of the refried beans.",
      "Taking your guacamole, spread it carefully on top of the sour cream mixture. Take care not to mix the two together. (Some people swap these layers around - it's up to you -- I just prefer the guac on top.).",
      "Toss the two types of grated cheese together, then spread them on top of the guacamole.",
      "Sprinkle with the tomatoes, olives, and green onions. Chill in refrigerator for at least an hour before serving.",
      "You can make this recipe a day ahead and let it sit in the fridge overnight - let it come to room temperature before serving with round, restaurant-style tortilla chips. (The reason to serve it at room temp is so that when you attempt to dip your chips in they don't break!) Some folks like to serve this hot instead of cold: bake at 350 degrees F for 30 minutes, if you'd like to do that.",
      "Notes: The above is my basic recipe. When I make it these days, I usually fiddle with it a bit, by: using 1 can of black bean refried beans instead of regular, adding ancho powder into the beans and sour cream, and adding a small can of chopped mild green chiles into the refried beans. When I'm lucky enough to bring home any of this from a party as leftovers, I fill flour tortillas with the dip and fry them up as burritos. They're wonderful both warm and cold, and taste great for lunch!"

      "To make the simple vanilla buttercream:",
      "In the bowl of a stand mixer with a paddle attachment, beat the butter on high speed until it is light and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Scrape down the sides of the bowl with a spatula. Add the sifted confectioners' sugar, vanilla extract, and milk, if using. Mix on low speed to combine the ingredients. Once the sugar is incorporated, crank the mixer to high speed and beat the mixture for another 2 minutes, until it has more than doubled in volume, for a fluffy whipped frosting.",
      "Leftover buttercream can be stored in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 2 weeks or in the freezer for 1 month; bring it back to room temperature and rewhip in a stand mixer before using. This recipe can easily be halved or doubled.",
      "To make the vanilla swiss meringue buttercream:",
      "To ensure that the metal bowl of your stand mixer is completely clean, dry, and free of grease, give it a quick wipe out with a halved lemon, then rinse and dry it thoroughly.",
      "In the bowl of the stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, mix the egg whites and the sugar on low to combine into a sugary slurry. Fill a medium saucepan with a few inches of water and place it on the stovetop over medium-high heat. Set the mixer bowl on top of the saucepan to create a kind of double boiler, making sure the mixer bowl doesn't touch the water.",
      "Heat the egg and sugar mixture until it reaches 160\u00b0F on a thermometer or is hot to the touch, whisking occasionally. This usually takes me about 5 to 7 minutes.",
      "Carefully return the metal mixing bowl to the stand mixer, with the whisk attachment in place. Now, bring the mixer up to high speed and beat the mixture for 8 to 10 minutes, until you've created medium-stiff peaks and it's a billowy, sticky, cloudy meringue. Whipping the meringue will also help cool down the bowl.",
      "Swap out the whisk for the paddle attachment. Make sure your meringue has cooled sufficiently before adding the butter-the bowl shouldn't be hot, just slightly warm, if that. With the mixer on low speed, add the butter a few pieces at a time, until all the butter is incorporated-it will look like a thick soup at this point. Add the vanilla extract, if using, the vanilla bean seeds, along with the pinch of salt (and any small amount of gel color if so desired), then bring the speed up to medium-high and beat until a fluffy, silky, magical buttercream has formed, about 2 to 3 minutes.",
      "If your Swiss meringue buttercream turns into a soupy disaster, try placing the whole bowl in the fridge for about 5 to 10 minutes to cool it down a bit, then bring it out and try whipping it again, first on low speed, then bringing it up to high speed. Or try adding a few more chunks of butter to the mix.",
      "If your Swiss meringue buttercream becomes a gross-looking, curdled mess, try lightly heating the whole bowl over a low-boiling pot of water for 1 minute, just to get some heat back in there. Once it's warmed up a teensy bit, try mixing it again. You will be amazed at how a bowl of seemingly awful-looking buttercream can actually be saved and whipped back into a gorgeous, fluffy, satiny, creamy frosting.",
      "Vanilla Swiss Meringue Buttercream will keep in an airtight container for up to 1 week in the fridge or up to 1 month in the freezer. Bring it back to room temperature and gently rewhip before using.",
      "Prepare the cake. Bake the three layers of cake according to the recipe instructions. Level, fill, and frost your cake using the uncolored buttercream.",
      "Fill a piping bag fitted with a multi-opening tip with about half of the uncolored buttercream.",
      "Pipe the fur. Starting at the bottom edge of the cake, hold the piping bag at a 90-degree angle against the cake and squeeze in short spurts to create a line of frosting dots from bottom to top. Continue piping lines all the way around the cake, nestling the lines closely together. Pipe the top of the cake in the same manner until the entire exterior is covered in fur.",
      "Place 1/2 cup of the remaining buttercream into a medium-sized bowl and tint it green. Fill the leaf-tipped piping bag with this buttercream.",
      "Divide the rest of the buttercream evenly between two medium-sized bowls, tinting one pink and the other, blue. Fill one of the star-tipped piping bags with the pink buttercream and the other with the blue.",
      "Make the fondant features. Clean and dry your hands completely. First we will make the ears. Pull off two 11/2-inch balls of white fondant; shape them into triangles about 1/2 inch thick. Using a 1-inch ball of pink fondant, form two flat triangles for the inner ears. Adhere these to the white triangles with a tiny amount of water. Insert wooden skewers into the bottoms of the ears and set aside.",
      "To make the unicorn horn, pull apart 11/2 inches of white fondant and roll it into a thick snake about 4 inches long. Do the same with the remaining pink fondant. Twist the white and pink fondant together, then roll the twist between your hands to compress it. Shape the tip of the horn into a point, then insert the additional skewer through the bottom center of the horn.",
      "Reserve two tiny bits of white fondant for the eye highlights. To make the snout, use the remaining white fondant and roll out a half circle 61/2 inches wide by 11/2 inches high by about ? inch thick. Using a sharp paring knife or pizza roller, trim to shape. With the trimmings, make three little 1/2-inch-long U shapes; attach to the half circle with a tiny amount of water to make two nostrils and a smile.",
      "Divide the black fondant into two equal balls, flattening them gently with your fingers to make ?-inch-thick circles. Use the two bits of reserved white fondant to create two tiny dots. Adhere the dots onto the black eyes using a toothpick and a teensy amount of water.",
      "Place the ears and horn on the top of the cake. Place the eyes and snout on the front of the cake. Gently press all the pieces into the buttercream.",
      "Using your two piping bags fitted with the open star tips and filled with colored buttercream, begin piping rosettes and drop stars on the unicorn head, alternating colors as you see fit and adding a cascade of swirls and drop stars to the center front, like a tendril of hair. Continue the curls and swirls all the way down the back of the unicorn's head-create a power mane full of magic! Finish by adding piped leaves using the piping bag fitted with the leaf tip for more texture and color.",
      "Tip: For an extra flowery feel, add a few edible flower petals or whole organic flowers, such as roses or carnations. This is also a great time to use any extra buttercream roses you might have stored in your freezer.",

      "Prepare Shredded Savory Pork and Chile Colorado as directed. Soak the corn husks in hot water about 30 minutes to soften.",
      "Meanwhile, for dough, in a large bowl, stir together masa harina and the water. Cover and let stand for 20 minutes (mixture will appear dry). In a mixing bowl, beat shortening and 1/2 teaspoon salt with an electric mixer on medium speed for 1 minute. Gradually beat in flour mixture until combined (mixture should resemble a thick, creamy paste).",
      "For filling, in a medium saucepan, combine Shredded Savory Pork and Chile Colorado; heat through.",
      "Drain corn husks well; pat dry with paper towels. For each tamale, spread about 2 tablespoons of the dough into a 5 x 4-inch rectangle on each corn husk so one of the long sides of the dough is at the long edge of the husk. (If husks are small, overlap two small husks.) Spoon about 1 tablespoon of the filing lengthwise down the center of the dough. Fold the long edge of husk over the filling so dough edges meet. Roll husk around outside of filled masa mixture. Tie ends securely with strips of cornhusk or 100-percent-cotton kitchen string.",
      "To prepare steamer, if desired, place a cone-shape ball of foil in the center of a steamer basket. Stand tamales upright in basket (don't pack tamales too tightly, but fill the space). Place about 1-1/2 inches of water in bottom of steamer or Dutch oven. Place baskets over water. Bring water to boiling; reduce heat. Cover and steam for 40 to 45 minutes or until tamales pull away from corn husks, adding water to pan as necessary. Makes 16 tamales.",
      "Make-Ahead Directions: Wrap and freeze the cooked tamales in the corn husks. To serve, thaw overnight in the refrigerator. Place the tamales in a steamer basket over gently boiling water for 15 to 20 minutes or until heated through."

Use a spatula to stir the mixture, making sure the bottom does not burn or become lumpy. When thickened, remove the pan from the heat and transfer the mixture to a large bowl. If there are any lumps, pass the mixture through a sieve into a bowl.",
      "Stir the sesame seed paste into the ice cream mixture until combined. Place parchment paper onto the surface to prevent a skin from forming and leave to cool completely. Refrigerate for 1-2 hours until well chilled. (You can speed this process up by placing the bowl into an ice bath.).",

After 40 minutes, use a fork to mix and break down the ice crystals. Repeat this process twice more, at 40-minute intervals. You can blitz it all in a food processor at the final stage to make it really smooth. Return it to the pan and leave in the freezer to set fully. Remove 15 minutes before serving to give the ice cream a chance to soften.",
