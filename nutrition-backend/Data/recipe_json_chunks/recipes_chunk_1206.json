      "While you are waiting on the coals to grey, you can prepare the smoked ribs by coating them them mustard on both sides. Use a lot. This will be messy so do it near the kitchen sink. Don't worry about ruining your barbequed ribs because the mustard will cook off during the process. Use a large cookie sheet to prepare them on. Next, sprinkle the ribs with whatever rub you like. If you do not have a rib rub, then just use your favorite combination of spices. Set aside or refrigerate if your fire is going to be a while. There is a myth that you need to peel away the fatty film from the underside of the rack of ribs but I don't see the point of this as there isn't any meat on that side.",
      "Make sure that you have the necessary wood for good smoked ribs. It takes several hours for the ribs to smoke so you may need several pieces of wood. I prefer the natural kind, but you can buy wood chunks at most grocery stores if you do not have access to wood.",
      ".if you are using a normal charcoal grill : Build your fire to one far side of the grill and cut it off from the rest of the grill with a stack of bricks or foil.",
      "Remember we are not wanting to cook the ribs yet, but rather smoke them. So, try to rig it so that as little heat gets to the meat as possible (the meat is going to go on the other side of the grill; as far as possible from the flame). I use a stack of bricks to separate the fire from the meat. I have the bricks with the holes in them so it works well to let the smoke through without so much heat. I then rig a double-piece of aluminum to use above the rack level to cut off the heat from the fire section to the meat section.",
      "Okay, slap those ribs on the racks and feed the fire some of those twigs or sticks. Close most air valves in your smoker. leaving only a crack. just enough to keep the fire alive (ideally only as smoke). Obviously, keep the lid down. Let those smoke for about 3 to 6 hours, depending on how much meat you have on. Add wood as necessary and turn ribs half way through. If you have multiple levels of racks then it helps to switch the slabs from one to the other so you get an even smoke distribution.",
      "Remember, try to NOT let the ribs cook. They may brown a bit but we don't want them bone-dry. Shield them with foil if necessary.",
      "Next step: bring inside and allow to cool. Double wrap each whole slab in foil. Refrigerate overnight to allow the smoke to set into the meat.",

    "ingredients": [],

      "For the shortcake:.",
      "Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.",
      "Combine the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt in a medium bowl.",
      "Cut the butter into the dry ingredients with a pastry blender.",
      "Whisk the egg into the cream. Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients and pour the cream mixture into the well. Mix with a fork until the ingredients just stick together.",
      "(Three Ways to Make Shortcakes. 1-Make them as drop biscuits. The dough must be moist enough to drop from a spoon and pat into a flat disc. Add more milk as needed to get the desired consistency. 2-Make them as cut-out biscuits. The dough must be slightly firm to cut into shapes on the counter. Sprinkle a little flour on the counter or add flour to the dough if needed. Don't add so much flour that the dough is firm like sugar cookie dough. Pat the soft dough out on the counter and cut into three-inch discs. If the dough is wet and the shape is a little ragged, it's perfect. 3-Make one large shortcake. Spread the dough into an eight-inch cake pan or nine-inch pie pan. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes until golden on top and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.).",
      "Brush the tops with the melted butter or cream. Sprinkle the tops with sugar. Bake for about fifteen minutes or until golden brown. Remove to a wire rack. Serve while still fresh and warm.",
      "Note: For the best results, always serve shortcake fresh. The dough can sit in the refrigerator for up to two hours while waiting to bake.",
      "For the strawberries: Wash and slice the strawberries. Sprinkle the strawberries with sugar and toss to coat.",
      "For the whipped cream: Combine the whipped cream, two tablespoons sugar, and the vanilla in a chilled bowl. Whip on medium speed until soft peaks form. Sweeten with the additional sugar if desired.",
      "To serve: Split the warm biscuits open. Fill with berries and whipped cream. Top with additional whipped cream and berries."

That should have cleaned out the measuring cup and the funnel. Remove the funnel and screw the cap on tightly. Shake the bottle vigorously to mix.

If you find pulp and small bits of ginger objectionable, strain the soda over your ice.",

      "Brown / sear the meatballs while continually rolling them with the utensils of your choice. I use two wooden spoons, but I've also used tongs to do this. The key is to get them browned enough to be \"medium rare\", not raw, as the cooking time is not long in the lasagna. However, they need to be done well enough to stick mostly together for slicing. I think next time I may chill them in the refrigerator. I put layers of paper towels down on a platter to hold the meatballs while they are cooling off.",

      "Note about the sauce: I am Italian American, and make my own marinara sauce from scratch several times a year. It takes all day, so I freeze it in storage containers for later use. However, when I use store bought sauce, I prefer the sauce made by Del Grosso, a small company in Tipton, Pennsylvania. Their products include both inexpensive sauces, and a line of specialty ones called \"La Famiglia Del Grosso that are roughly twice the price of Ragu or Prego ($6-$7 a for a 26 ounce jar). This recipe is about shortcuts, not making things from scratch. The company's \"Aunt Mary Ann's Sunday Marinara\" tastes very, very much like the sauce I make from scratch, so that is what I used for this recipe.",

What worked for me as a guess was one minute shorter than the lowest recommended time - this was 9 minutes for the Mueller brand noodles that were on sale for 2:1 the day I was shopping for supplies for this project. The noodle layers will also soften while the lasagna is cooking, so do not worry if they are a little stiff.",
      "If using meat, remove the meatballs from the sauce and slice into roughly 1/4 inch slices. Don't worry if the crumble (as some will). These will form the meat layer of the lasagna.",

      "Layer the lasagna noodles with slight overlapping in the pan. If you need to, don't be afraid to use small \"band aid\" sections or cross sections to make the layer. You should have plenty of noodles.",
      "Using a spatula, or spoon of your choice, make a layer of sauce covering the noodles. Add a layer of the ricotta mixture covering the sauce. If adding meat, arrange slices or crumbles of the meatballs next. If not, use the steamed spinach to create a veggie layer. Now sprinkle a later of mozzarella cheese, and top with a light to moderate dusting of parmesan cheese.",

      "Cover with aluminum foil.",

      "Hope this works out for you, but it has become a family favorite in our house, and only takes a short while to prepare when compared to the time investment in a day-long \"from scratch\" lasagna recipe."

If the peel separates from the potato, discard it. If the peel gets grated in with the potatoes, it's fine and just incorporate it into the mixture. I like the hand grater best. When I use the processor, I use two thirds shredded then pulverized potatoes and one third shredded for a mixture than is bulky but still has shreds. Worth the trouble.",

Drop potato batter by teaspoons (for small ones) or soup spoonfuls in small dollops, flattening slightly with a metal spatula if desired. I use large metal tongs for dropping and turning.

      "In a medium skillet over a medium-high heat, saute the onion, tomatoes, artichoke hearts, sage, thyme, and garlic in a 2 tablespoons of coconut oil. Saute everything for about 3 to 4 minutes, just until the onions become slightly translucent and the tomatoes and artichokes begin to become tender. Remove the skillet from the heat and set aside for later use.",
      "Place the pork tenderloin in a 9x13 baking dish, rub some coconut oil all over and sprinkle with salt and pepper to taste. In order to stuff the loin, create a seam in the meat by cutting it down the center lengthwise, essentially, you want to be able to unfold the meat. Set the meat aside until the stuffing has been prepared.",
      "Preheat your oven to 450\u00b0F.",
      "Turn your attention back to the stuffing. Once the ingredients from the skillet have completely cooled, whisk in an egg. The egg is essential to the stuffing, as this is what replaces the usual \"breadcrumbs\" and works to hold everything together. However, to make this work best, tomato/artichoke mixture must be cool, otherwise it will cook the egg before it is even stuffed in the meat and the egg will no longer act as a glue, since it cannot be cooked twice.",
      "Take the stuffing and begin spreading it across the seam of the meat. Avoid filling the meat too much, as you will not be able to fold the pork closed. Use some toothpicks to ensure the tenderloin does not pop open while cooking.",
      "Cook, uncovered, at 450 F for 30 minutes. Once the first 30 minutes have passed, reduce the heat to 300 F and cook for another 20 minutes. When the time is up, turn off the oven, but allow the meat to remain in it for at least 15 minutes. This cooking method is perfect for keeping the meat from overcooking and becoming dry. Bon apetit!"

Allow it to soak up the flavor of the liquids. Use a quality wine in your sangria, and make sure to put it in the glass or pitcher before you start mixing in the other ingredients. Since fruit is a great expression of the seasons, use those types that are fresh and in season. For example, during the summer, mix a white wine with peaches, nectarines and blueberries. In the winter, use citrus fruits like oranges and tangerines. In the fall, choose apples and berries. Be sure you use fruit juices that are consistent with the fruits in your sangria. In the summer, use peach nectar. If you're using citrus fruits, use orange juice. If you're using berries, use cranberry juice."

      "Bring a tea kettle of water to a boil.",
      "Make the caramel: Have ready a 9-inch glass pie plate and a pair of potholders or oven mitts.",
      "Pour the sugar into a small, heavy saucepan. Set it over medium-low heat until the sugar starts to liquefy and form clumps.",
      "Stir slowly and constantly; the sugar will eventually liquefy completely, then begin to color. Pay careful attention to the caramel at this point; once it starts to color it will darken quickly.",
      "Pull the pan from the heat when the caramel is the color of a bright, shiny penny. Scrape all the caramel into the pie plate, put on the mitts and grab the pie plate firmly. Carefully but quickly rotate so the bottom and halfway up the sides of the plate are coated with caramel.",
      "Set the prepared pan into a shallow roasting pan.",
      "Make the filling: Combine the evaporated milk, condensed milk, milk, eggs, yolks, and vanilla in a blender jar. Blend on very low speed just until the eggs are blended, a few seconds.",
      "Add the Media Crema and blend a few seconds until smooth. Let stand for a minute then scoop off any foam that rises to the surface.",
      "Put the roasting pan with the caramel-lined pie plate in the oven. Pour the custard mix into the pie plate.",
      "Carefully pour enough water from the tea kettle into the roasting pan to come halfway up the side of the pie plate.",
      "Bake until the center of the flan is set, about 35 minutes. Remove from the oven and cool to room temperature in the water bath.Refrigerate until completely chilled, at least 2 hours or up to 1 day.",
      "To serve, center a large plate over the flan and, with one quick flip invert the flan over the plate. Give it a few seconds-the flan will slip right out of the mold and onto the plate. Scrape any caramel left in the mold over the flan. Serve chilled.",
      "Be extremely careful when working with caramel: By the time the caramel is brown enough to pour into the mold it will be very hot-much hotter than boiling water. Handle the pot and pie plate carefully and, when tilting the pan, keep it at arm's length from you."
