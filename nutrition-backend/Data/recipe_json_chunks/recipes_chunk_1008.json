However any combination of dried herbs would be good - but NOT Rosemary as it is too pungent & will overpower the other flavours. One herb which is ALWAYS a must no matter what combination you use, is Sage - it has a wonderful affinity with pork & pork sausages in particular! I also use fresh herbs when they are available in my herb garden. Use at least double the quantity of fresh herbs as they are not as strong as dried herbs. Chop or mince very finely.

      "Pound the chicken breast until it is flat- about 1/4\" thick- don't be afraid to make it too thin. The point is that you want cook the chicken quickly before it drys out. On a plate mix some flour- maybe about 1/4 cup or so- enough to coat the chicken. Salt and pepper the flour. Coat the chicken with the flour mixture.",
      "Use a skillet big enough for all the chicken to lay flat. Heat the skillet to med-high and lightly coat the bottom of the pan with olive oil.",
      "Cook the chicken for about 2 minutes a side(use your judgement here!) You will know when it is done- it is white, slightly golden- do not overcook or it will be dry. Since it is thin it should be fairly easy to tell if it is still pink.",
      "Take the chicken out of the pan and put on a plate- cover with foil.",
      "Pour enough white wine (I like a nice dry Sauvignon Blanc or Chardonnay, or Pinot Grigio) so there is about 1/4\" or more of liquid in the bottom of the pan. The goal here is to make enough sauce to generously to pour over each piece of chicken and you have to start with enough because you want to reduce it to burn off the alcohol. Make sure the pan is hot enough so that the liquid boils. This will only take a minute or so, keep and eye on it- you don't want to evaporate all of your liquid. Taste it- when it tastes good- the harsh alcohol has burned off, reduce heat to low, add the juice of one whole large juicy lemon that you have already squeezed. Add about 2 tablespoons of capers. Put the chicken back in pan to coat in sauce and to reheat. Serve immediately. Put a piece of chicken on each plate and pour lots of sauce on each piece. Yummy."

      "Soak the beans in three times as much water for 8 hours or overnight.",
      "Preheat your oven to 325\u00b0F with your racks near the bottom.",

      "In a medium-large mixing bowl, pour the tomatoes, mustard, molasses, red wine vinegar, maple syrup and worcestershire sauce. Measure in the brown sugar, cumin and allspice.",
      "Finely mince (or grate) the cloves of garlic and add them to the mix. Take your chipotle out of their deliciously spicy adobo sauce and chop very, very finely. Add the chipotle and dollop in your adobo sauce. Season with salt (1-2 tsp for the regular amount, and up to 1 tbsp, depending on taste, for the potluck size).",
      "Give the sauce a good whisk to make sure that everything is combined, and pour it over the beans. Stir until the beans are evenly coated. The pork hock gets in the way a little bit, but just work around it. Believe me, it's much easier than lifting the pork hock out and then trying to sandwich it back in and even things out.",
      "Pour 2 cups of chicken stock over top. It should look rather soupy at this point.",
      "Cover the Dutch oven and tuck it in to bake for at least 4 hours before checking to see the condition of your beans. They will have absorbed quite a bit of the flavorful sauce at this point, and started to thicken up.",
      "The beans should be very tender and soft, but not falling apart into mush. Remove the pork hock from the pot.",
      "Add more stock to the pot until it starts to look thin and saucy but not overly soupy. Does that make sense? Tuck the beans back in the oven to continue cooking while you let the pork hock cool until it's easy to handle. At that point, separate the meat from the skin/fat and bones. Discard the gristle and bones before tearing the meat into relatively small chunks. Reserve the big fatty skin chunk (appetizing? No. Delicious flavor inducing? Yes) that was on the exterior of your pork hock.",
      "Mix about half of the chopped pork back in with the beans (or all of it if you were making the larger amount, or if you just happen to have a fondness for smoked pork...which is entirely understandable), and add more stock if they aren't looking loose enough. Casually drape the skin/fat on top of the beans like a first date at a movie theater. Try to lay it fat side up if you can. Put the lid back on and tuck the beans back, yet again, in your oven for another 1 - 1.5 hours. The texture of the beans should be saucy but not soupy. You know, fairly thick but not goopy. Sloppy? Can I describe them as sloppily thick beans? Because that's how I like them. It's up to you, though. If you like a saucier bean, add more stock. If you like a thicker bean, let it cook for the last half hour uncovered. There are ways to give you what you want, the beans say so.",

      "Place the chocolate candy melts in a small microwave-safe bowl. Microwave on high in increments of 30 seconds, stirring in between, until the chocolate is completely melted. Allow the chocolate to cool for a few minutes before using as it is easier to work with chocolate that is slightly thickened.",
      "Cut off the tops of the strawberries and reserve the tops (these will be used for the wattles). Place a strawberry in the bowl of melted chocolate and stir it around with a spoon until it is completely coated. Lift the strawberry up out of the chocolate and allow some of the excess to fall off. Place the strawberry onto wax paper. Repeat with the remaining strawberries.",
      "Assemble the \"eyes\". Place two pearl candies side-by-side on the top part of the \"face\" of the turkey and hold them there for a few seconds, until they stay on their own. Dip the tip of a toothpick in the melted chocolate and dot the center of the pearl candies with the chocolate to complete the eyes. Repeat with the remaining strawberries.",
      "Make the \"feet\". Place two orange candy hearts at the bottom where feet would go and hold them there for a few seconds, until they stay on their own. Repeat with the remaining strawberries.",
      "Make the \"beak\". Take 6 pieces of the candy corn and cut the yellow and white parts off, so you have just the orange portion remaining. Cut each orange piece into a triangular shape. Dip the tip of a toothpick in the melted chocolate and apply some of the melted chocolate to the backside of a \"beak\". Place the beak onto the strawberry under the eyes and hold it there for a few seconds, until it stays on its own. Repeat with the remaining \"beaks\".",
      "Make the \"wattle\". Using a sharp paring knife, cut very thin slivers off of the reserved strawberry tops. Drape the strawberry sliver over the beak and gently press it into the chocolate. Repeat with the remaining \"wattles\".",
      "Place the turkeys in the freezer for 5 minutes, to allow the chocolate to slightly set. Allowing the chocolate to slightly set at this point helps the candy corn (feathers) stick to the chocolate and strawberry easier.",
      "Make the \"feathers\". This is the hardest part but after a little practice, it really is easy. 6 total pieces of candy corn go into the top of each strawberry to make the \"feathers\", 4 on the top and 1 on each side. With your toothpick, poke four small holes in the very top edge of the strawberry where the 4 top candy corn would go. Gently and carefully press the pieces of candy corn into the holes. I find that this is easiest if you steady the strawberry with your other hand by placing the toothpick in the backside of it as you press the candy corn pieces inches For the remaining 2 side \"feathers\", you must cut the candy corn at an angle to make them fit more easily into the sides. Make small holes with the toothpick for the side \"feathers\" and press the candy pieces in as you did with the others. Roll your toothpick around into the melted chocolate and spread a thin layer of the chocolate at the base of the \"feathers\". This will give some extra support for the candy corn. Hold the candy corn in place for a few moments, until they stay on their own.",
      "Return the turkeys to the freezer for 15 to 20 minutes, to allow the chocolate to completely set.",

      "Crust: Mix until thoroughly combined - Dough will be very stiff. makes enough for two (2) 12\" pizza pies. The dough is ready to use \"as-is\" No need to rise or kneed. Divide the dough in half, shape into a round ball and roll out paper thin.",
      "In order to move the crusts around a pizza peel sprinkled with cornmeal works well.",
      "After the crust, it's the sauce that begins the first real steps towards forming the total Imo's pizza experience. Imos uses a tomato sauce mixture that has a sweet taste, but it's not so overly sweet to hide the rich tomato flavor or spices.",
      "Sauce:Combine together and it's ready to use - do not pre-cook the sauce! This Makes enough sauce for about four (4) 12\" pizza pies, so that should give you some idea of how much to use on each pizza.",
      "On top of the sweet sauce Imo's uses Provel Cheese, which is simply a blend of Cheddar, Swiss and Provolone cheeses with some liquid smoke flavoring. If you can't find Provel in your local market, it can be easily created.",
      "Cheese:Toss until cheeses and smoke flavoring are completely incorporated. Typically it's enough cheese for two (2) 12\" pizza pies, but if you like extra-cheese you'll want to make more.",
      "Authentic Imo's pizza toppings include: Extra-Cheese, Onion, Green Pepper, Sausage, Hamburger, Pepperoni, Anchovy, Bacon, Black Olive, Mushroom, Canadian Bacon, Jalapenos, Pineapple, Banana Peppers, and Tomatoes.",
      "In a professional pizza oven the meat toppings (Hamburger, Sausage, Bacon, etc.) can usually be put on raw, but at home you'll want to fully precook the meat before assembling the pizza.",
      "Now you have the correct style crust, sweet sauce, smoky cheese, generous toppings, it's now ready to be lightly sprinkled with some Italian seasonings.",
      "Seasonings: Combine all the ingredients in a small mixing bowl and blend well.",
      "While in the restaurant the pizza is baked in a pizza pan, at home you'll have the best results using a pizza stone and an oven temperature around 450 degrees. If you don't have a pizza stone, use the thinnest baking sheet you have and the lowest over rack position. The pizza is done when the underside of the crust is a dark golden brown, and the cheese is has a slight golden tint to it. Underbaking the crust will result in a limp crust, overbaking will result in a hard, tough, burnt-tasting crust, getting the right baking time to produce a crisp crust will require a bit of experimentation. The amount and type of toppings you use will also affect the total baking time. A rule-of-thumb is to check the pizza after about 10-12 minutes and adjust baking time from there accordingly.",
      "And, as a final touch to truly replicate Imo's Pizza at home, is to cut the pizza into tile-like squares instead of the traditional triangle slices."

      "Adjust your oven rack to the lowest position. Preheat oven to 250\u00b0F.",
      "Rinse and dry the turkey breast. Even when I purchase a brined turkey breast, I still like to lightly salt the turkey breast under the skin. You, of course, do not have to. If the turkey breast that you purchase has NOT been brined or koshered, liberally salt the breast under the skin.",
      "Heat a large pot over medium-high heat with the oil. When hot, add the turkey, breast-side down. Add the onion around the edges of the bird. Add the garlic on top of the onions. Cook several minutes or until the skin has browned. Flip the bird over so that the breast is facing upward. Stir the onions and garlic. Cook a couple minutes longer. If you have a probe thermometer, insert it into the thickest part of the breast - making sure the probe is not sticking up in the air in a way that would impede your covering the turkey breast with a lid. Cover the pot with aluminum foil and top with a tight-fitting lid. Crimp the foil around the seam of the pot to ensure steam does not escape. Cook until the internal temperature reaches 160F - roughly 2 1/2 hours.",
      "When the turkey is done, remove it from the oven and flip the bird over so that the breast is submerged in the accumulated juices. Cover and let rest 15 minutes. During this time, the internal temperature will increase to at least 170\u00b0F.",
      "Remove the turkey from the pot and place it on a large platter. Keep it tented so it stays warm. Strain the liquid and solids from the pot into a large bowl. Use the back of a ladle to make sure you smash the onion/garlic to extract all of the juices. Discard the vegetable solids. Skim some or most of the fat that settles on top of the broth and discard any unwanted fat. Measure how much turkey broth you have. If you do not have at least 4 cups, add some chicken stock to come up to a total of 4 cups of liquid. If you like particularly thin gravy, you can add an extra 1/4 to 1/2 cups of turkey/chicken broth. If you like thicker gravy, reduce the liquid by 1/4 to 1/2 cup.",
      "To make the gravy, heat a saucepan over medium heat with three tablespoons of butter. After the butter has melted, add the flour and whisk to combine. Cook the butter/flour mixture for about 5 minutes or until it is brown in color. Add the turkey broth and whisk to make sure there are no lumps. Bring to a boil then simmer about 5 minutes. Too thin? Simmer another few minutes or until the gravy is your desired thickness. Too thick? Add more turkey broth, chicken broth, or even water. When the gravy is your desired level of thickness, taste it and add some salt and pepper, if needed. You'll probably need at least some salt.",

Rather than just using 1 packet, use 2 packets of the beef flavor ramen noodles. When cooking the noodles, cook them without the flavoring. During this time, (after you drain the ground beef) add the veggies to the meat and continue to cook. As the veggies become cooked, add the two packets of flavoring to the beef-veggie mixture. The ramen noodles don't take long to cook, so be sure to watch them. When they are done, drain them, and add them to the beef-veggie mixture. The completed dish will have more flavor, and more noodles for the noodle lovers! Enjoy!"

Place the bowl over a saucepan filled with 2 inches of barely simmering water. Using a hand beater or handheld electric mixer, continue beating the egg white mixture for 4 minutes. Add 1/2 cup mini marshmallows in 2 increments while continuing to beat. Wait until the first batch of marshmallows has melted before adding the second. Continue beating for 2 to 3 minutes more, until stiff peaks form. Remove from the heat, stir in the vanilla and continue beating until the frosting is thick enough to spread.",
      "NOTE:It's challenging to press coconut into the sides of the cake. When pressing the coconut in, the icing invariably sticks to my fingers and mars the frosting's finish. I've discovered that throwing small handfuls of coconut toward the side of the cake makes it adhere quite well - a messy but effective technique for creating a gorgeous cake."

Take all the vegetable and mince or chop in a food processor. Sautee the minced peppers, onion, garlic and cumin until everything is nice and tender, then add the canned tomato. Add salt and pepper to taste. Mix in the chicken, stirring well to mix evenly with the veggies. Add one cup of broth and simmer for about ten minutes to let the flavors mix. If it gets too dry, add the second cup of broth. Once it is heated, add the chili powder, stir in well, remove from heat and you are ready to serve in whatever way you choose.",

I still marinaded everything the same way, rubbing the seasonings into the meat is more difficult but still doable. Instead of grilling the meat however, after everything marinaded I put the whole mixture, marinade and all in a slow cooker. I wouldn't use lime slices in the marinade for this though so you won't have to pick them out."
