      "Before we cook lobster we take it out of its shell.",
      "Most people cook lobster in its shell, and once it's cooked there's nothing you can do to it anymore.",
      "By cooking raw lobster out of its shell you can influence its taste and texture.",
      "We cook the exterior layer of the flesh, just enough so that it will pull cleanly away from the shell, leaving the interior raw.",
      "This allows us to treat the lobster as we would raw fish.",
      "When Thomas Keller got to the French Laundry, he came up with the technique of butter poaching, which loads the flavor of butter into the lobster and cooks it so slowly and gently that the flesh remains exquisitely tender, so tender some people think it's not completely cooked.",
      "When you cook lobster violently, the meat seizes up and becomes tough, and you can't get anything into it.",
      "Gentle heating is the key to tender, flavorful lobster.",
      "After the initial pairing of lobster with butter in the cooking methodwhat's the point of lobster without butter''it is then very versatile.",
      "Once you make the initial lobster-butter connection, which takes you back to your very first experience with lobster, you can put it with so many different garnishes: beets and leeks, peas and carrots, figs, foie gras.",
      "All lobster dishes at the French Laundry begin with this initial preparation, after which they may be poached in butter, roasted or chopped for a filling.",
      "It's crucial to work with the lobsters while they are hot, or the fat in the meat will congeal and make it difficult to remove the lobster from its shell.",
      "Place the lobsters into a tight fitting container.",
      "Cover with cold water to determine how much you will need.",
      "Drain off the water, measure it and place the water in a large pot.",
      "Bring the water to a boil and add 1/2 cup of white distilled vinegar to every 8 quarts of water you are using.",
      "After the vinegar is added, pour the boiling liquid over the lobsters and let them steep for 2 to 3 minutes (3 minutes for 2 pound lobsters).",
      "Reserving the water, use a pair of tongs to remove the lobsters from the water.",
      "Place them on a sheet pan with sides or a board placed over the sink; it is messy to disassemble the lobsters.",
      "Using a towel or rubber gloves to help hold the hot lobster, grasp the lobster's tail, twist and pull the tail, to detach it from the body.",
      "Twist and pull the arms to detach them and return the arms to the hot water for an additional 5 minutes.",
      "Reserve the bodies.",
      "For the tail, hold the tail flat and twist the tail fan to one side; pull off and discard.",
      "Use your fingers to gently push the meat through the tail end, and pull the meat out through the large opening.",
      "Discard the tail shell.",
      "Lay the tail meat on its back and cut lengthwise through the middle.",
      "Remove the vein running through the top of the meat.",
      "Lay the finished pieces on a sheet pan lined with paper towels.",

      "Crack it to each side and pull it straight off.",

      "You may not always succeed in keeping the claw meat in one piece, but with practice your success rate will increase.",
      "Still holding the claw, crack the top of the shell with the back of a heavy knife blade, about 3/4-inch from the joint where the knuckle was attached.",
      "You want to go through the shell but not damage the meat.",
      "Turn the claw over and repeat the procedure a second time.",
      "Wiggle your knife to loosen and crack the shell.",
      "Pull off the lower section of the shell.",

      "Add the claws to the tail meat.",
      "For the knuckles, cut off the top joint of the knuckle that was attached to the lobster's body.",
