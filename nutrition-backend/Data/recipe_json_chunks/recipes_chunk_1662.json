      "Place about 1-ounce of filling into the center of a wrapper using a tablespoon.",

      "Make 3 or 4 pleats.",
      "Put the assembled wrappers on a parchment-lined pan, but make sure that they do not touch each other.",

      "It sounds odd but is quite nice.",
      "To cut and serve a cake soft: Cut the cake into 8 equal triangular wedges (think of an asterisk).",

      "(You may have to pause midway to pull on other strands as you make the cuts.)",
      "When all the strands are removed, the cake will be cut into perfect wedges.",
      "To fry and serve a cake: Nicely cut wedges are not necessary if you are frying the cake.",
      "Use a knife to quarter the cake and then cut each quarter into 1/2-inch-thick slices.",
      "In a 10-inch nonstick skillet, heat 1 tablespoon oil over medium heat.",
      "Add half of the slices and fry, undisturbed, for about 6 minutes, or until the rice has softened.",
      "Use a spatula to press and mash the chunks to form a pancake and continue to fry for 5 to 6 minutes, or until the underside is crispy and golden.",
      "Flip the pancake with a quick and confident jerk of the skillet handle (or slide the pancake onto a plate and then invert it into the skillet).",
      "Increase the heat to medium-high and fry the second side for about 4 minutes, or until crispy and golden.",
      "Slide the pancake onto a plate, cut into wedges, and serve.",
      "Repeat with the remaining slices to make a second pancake.",
      "The wooden mold for these cakes is not commercially produced because people typically make the molds themselves.",
      "If you are not good at woodworking, do as I did and ask someone for help.",
      "The mold should have a 5-inch-square opening and stand 1 1/2 inches high.",

      "My friend Mike Crane cut the wood into 4 pieces, 2 pieces that were 5 inches long and 1 1/2 inches wide and 2 pieces that were 6 1/2 inches long and 1 1/2 inches wide.",
      "Although nails would have held the pieces together, he used screws, drilling 2 holes at the end of each of the longer pieces.",
      "When he screwed the pieces together, he added a little glue for extra security.",
      "To finish the mold, he lightly sanded the edges.",
      "To refresh a thawed banh chung, bring it to room temperature.",
      "Rewrap it in foil and tie it with cotton string as you originally did.",
      "Boil the cake in a large pot of water for 1 hour, adding water as needed to keep the cake submerged.",
