You can even leave out the herbs for a delicious plain bread (the bread in the photo is actually the plain version). When you chop the herbs, try to make them all about the size of a rosemary leaf cut into quarters. My knives aren't very sharp, so I like to use kitchen shears (scissors) for this part.",
      "In a large mixing bowl, mix warm water (about 100 degrees F) with kosher salt until dissolved. Sprinkle yeast over the top of the water. You'll be using 2 packets, which is about 1.5 tablespoons of yeast. Let the yeast sit for 2-4 minutes.",
      "Mix your herbs thoroughly into your flour. I prefer to use bread flour, but in this recipe all purpose flour will work if it's what you have. I've even used All-Purpose and Bread flour combined, just to use the last of my flour. This recipe is nothing if not versatile.",
      "Using a wooden spoon, stir the flour into the yeast/water until there are no more wet or dry spots. Cover the bowl with a damp towel and let it rise until doubled. (The damp cloth prevents the top of your dough from drying out. If it dries, the dry surface will prevent the dough from rising).",
      "Doubling should take 2-5 hours. This will depend largely on how warm your kitchen is.",
      "When the dough has doubled in size, turn your oven to 450 degrees. Put one rack on the lowest shelf and the other rack on the middle of the oven. On the lower rack place a broiler pan, on the middle rack place a pizza or baking stone. The stone needs to be heated for at least 20 minutes after the oven reaches temp, so don't forget this important step of placing these in the oven when you turn it on!",
      "Take a large cookie sheet and spread cornmeal over it. Sprinkle a dusting of flour over your dough. Using a serrated knife, cut the dough in half while it is still in the bowl. Cut one of those halves in half again. Take one quarter of the dough and turn it in your hands, stretching the surface lightly, to form a smooth top and lumpy bottom. Place this on the cornmeal and repeat with the other quarter. We're letting the newly formed loaves of dough rise a second time.",
      "Cover the dough with a damp towel again.",
      "After 40 minutes, the first loaf is risen and ready for the oven. Sprinkle some flour on the top of it, then using a serrated or very sharp knife slice the top of the bread 3 times, about 1/4 inch deep. Alternately, you can cut an X into the top of the bread, also 1/4 inch deep.",
      "Get 1 cup of very hot water. Open the oven and place your dough on the pizza stone. Then pour the cup of very hot water into the broiler pan at the bottom of the oven and quickly shut the door, trapping the steam. This will allow the surface of the dough to stay moist for long enough that it will rise before it forms a hard crust.",
      "When you put that first loaf into the oven, remove the half of the dough that is remaining in the bowl, cut it in half, turn it in your hands to form a stretched smooth top and lumpy bottom, and place it onto the cornmeal to rise.",
      "Bake the first loaf of bread (and each subsequent loaf) for 20-25 minutes, until it gets a nice golden brown crust.",
      "When you remove the first loaf from the oven, place it onto a cooling rack and put the second loaf into the oven. Remember to make the cuts on the top of the loaf and also to pour in the cup of hot water into your roaster pan each time you put a loaf into the oven.",
      "When you put the second loaf in, prep the third and fourth pieces of dough the same way, turning it in your hands to create a smooth top and lumpy bottom.",
      "Once cooked, allow the bread to cool completely, unless you plan to eat the whole loaf at once. Otherwise it will lose its moisture.",
      "Once the bread is cooled (2-3 hours) you can store it in a plastic bag. It freezes well, so you can save loaves for quite some time.",
      "When you remove it from a plastic bag the crust will be softer than when you put it in. If you want a nice crispy crust simply place the loaf in a warm oven for 10 minutes or so.",
      "It makes wonderful stuffing, if you're making a turkey. It's good with just about anything, really. This bread is fantastic, easy, and it just might inspire you to make more breads! Even if you have never baked bread before, you will succeed at making this bread."

Then I gently lift up the dough (you can use a thin metal spatula if necessary) and very gently stretch it while rotating it, as if I was stretching pizza dough. Then I put it back onto the countertop and roll it out again, this time into a circle about 8 inches in diameter. After that it's ready to cook.

Cook until lightly browned in spots on the second side, then turn it back over onto the first side and cook a few seconds more until the bubbles puff up.

      "Put flour, flax (if you are using it), salt, sugar and rosemary in a food processor. Pulse to blend. Add oil, pulse 3-4 times. Turn machine to 'on' and add water in stream till dough comes together. Run for about 20 seconds. Turn dough out and knead to a smooth ball. Divide into four pieces and cover with a towel. Let rest for 5 minutes.",
      "Begin with one of the four dough pieces. Using a pasta roller, start on the widest setting and finish on the thinnest, just as you would for rolling pasta dough. It helps to divide the dough one more time about midway through the rolling process, so that one piece of dough results in two long (approximately 4\" x 15\") strips of rolled dough. I also dust the dough with flour on both sides before rolling at the thinnest setting (which is #7 on my inexpensive manual pasta roller). The two strips get baked at the same time, for a total of four batches of two strips from one cracker bread recipe. I do not begin rolling the second piece of dough until the first batch is cooked. Multitasking for this recipe always results in burned crackers for me!",
      "Spritz dough with water from a spray bottle and sprinkle with sea salt (or kosher) and freshly ground pepper. Slide parchment paper directly into the oven onto the baking stone. Flip crackers over, and move from the front to the back of the oven after about 1 minute. Watch closely. Your oven my vary. You want to flip them after the dough bubbles, but is still pliable. I do this quickly by reaching in with tongs. Watch closely after that. Take them out after no more than a minute-sometimes less. You don't want them browned. There will be light brown spots or speckles and maybe an edge or two will be darkening, but that's it. The strips will still be flexible. You can cut them into 6\" lengths at this point with a pizza cutter for uniform sizes, or wait until they are crisp and break them for a more haphazard look.",
      "Cool completely on a rack, then package and store in festive cellophane bags to impress your friends.",
      "If you don't have a pizza stone large enough to bake the strips on, you can use a large cookie sheet. You will need to dramatically increase the cooking time. Watch for the dough to begin to bubble, give it another 30 seconds to a minute and then flip it. You want to take them out when they are beginning to stiffen. So if you grab one out of the oven it will bend into an arc slightly when held in the middle, but won't bend in half.",
      "My directions make it sound much more complicated than it is. I just wanted to be as helpful as I could be, having made many, many batches of these crackers and coming up with helpful tips along the way."

Do not spread the cheese all the way to the edge as you have to fold the dough over itself. Therefore, leave a border of about 5 centimeters.",
      "Add the apples to the top of the cheese, drizzling any leftover juice over the apples.",
      "Fold the sides of the dough over the fruit filling, and again don't worry if the dough tears, just patch it up. Once the filling is safely folded inside the dough, bake for 10 - 20 minutes. I say this because it really does depend on how baked you want your fruit to be. I baked mine for approximately 15 minutes, maybe a little less. At that point, my crust was very brown and the apples slightly crispy.",
      "Serve warm or cold.",
      "Inspired by: Scarletta Bakes and Sugar Laws (I mixed both recipes together to create this one)."

      "4. A small strainer if you intend to sprinkle the baked desserts with cocoa and powdered sugar",
      "5. A double boiler or a homemade bain-marie: the bain-marie is made out of a pot partially filled with water and a heatproof bowl that will fit in the rim of the pot without touching its bottom. Ideally, the water in the pot should not touch the bottom of the bowl, but for this recipe, if it does, it will still be alright.",
      "1. Preheat the oven to 400\u00b0F.",
      "2. Butter the ramekins and put them in the refrigerator. (Putting them in the freezer for 5 or 10 minutes just before filling them with batter is ideal, but timing everything to include doing it is not always possible when you are making other parts of a meal as well.)",
      "3. Bring the water in the bottom of the double boiler or bain-marie to a simmer. Chop up the chocolate and melt it in the top part of the double boiler (or bowl of the homemade version).",

      "5. Beat the eggs and sugar in the mixer until they form a pale yellow mixture that drops slowly from a spoon in a ribbon.",
      "6. Continue beating and slowly add the flour in a stream.",
      "7. Stir in the melted chocolate mixture. (The batter may be made in advance up to this point, covered, and left at room temperature until you are ready to bake the mi-cuit.)",
      "8. Bake exactly 12 minutes.",

      "10. Sprinkle the cakes with cocoa powder and powdered sugar, and, if you want, decorate each with a strawberry flower: Cut down through the middle of each berry from stem to tip. Cut from stem to tip again so that the berry is divided into quarters, but is still attached to the stem. Then stretch the quarters out with your fingers to resemble the open petals of a flower.",

    "ingredients": [],

      "In a large bowl combine milk, yeast, salt and 1/2 teaspoon sugar in a large bowl. You have to mix this together well-I prefer to use a wooden spoon. Make sure the yeast is well mixed in. Cover loosely with plastic and leave bowl in a warm spot for 10 minutes or until the mixture is slightly bubbled on top. Mine was not very frothy/bubbly, but I left it for around 12 minutes and there were bubbles on the top of the mixture.",
      "In another large bowl, sift flour, cocoa and cinnamon together. Add 2 tablespoons of sugar, the frothy yeast mixture, butter and egg. Stir until the mixture comes together. It will be a thick, shaggy dough and very sticky. Turn the mixture out onto a well-floured bench. Make sure your hands are well floured. Knead the dough until it is smooth. I had to knead mine for 10-15 minutes. It actually wasn't working for a while, so if this happens for you, just do what I did: leave the dough for a minute or two and let it breathe. Then, retry. My dough wasn't perfectly smooth; it was still a little sticky but it stuck together.",
      "Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl (I simply sprayed mine heavily with coconut oil). Cover the bowl with a plastic wrap. Leave the dough in a warm place so the dough will rise. I left mine for about 1 hour 10 minutes, but leave for up to 1 hour 30 minutes if the dough has not doubled in size. Mine doubled very quickly-in fact it rose over the bowl and stuck to the plastic. There is nothing wrong with this, it means you've done a good job. I went for a run while my dough was rising.",
      "Once the dough has doubled in size, punch it down to its original size with your fist. This is the best bit of the recipe; it's so much fun.",
      "Turn down on to a floured surface and add the chocolate chips slowly, kneading the bread until the chips are evenly spread throughout the mixture.",
      "On a tray or in a large, deep pan, divide the mixture into 12 equal portions to make 12 balls of dough. Mine were not perfectly circular, not at all. But it doesn't really matter, it still looks good. Make sure you place the balls about 1 centimeter apart, as the dough has to rise one more time.",
      "Cover the balls with plastic wrap and leave the pan in a warm place until the dough has doubled in size. This takes about 30 minutes. I left mine for a good 30 minutes.",
      "Preheat oven to 200\u00b0C (about 390\u00b0F). Bake the buns for 15-20 minutes. The top of the buns will be a golden brown and when a skewer is inserted into the dough, it should come out clean. This may take less time depending on your oven. Keep a good eye on it.",
      "If you want to glaze the muffins, simply boil the water with the sugar for about 3 minutes. Then brush the sugar mixture over the warm muffins.",
      "After this, while the muffins are warm, make the crosses. I used a knife to simply spread the Nutella over the buns to make a cross.",
      "Serve warm. You can serve them at warm temperature, but warm, when the chocolate chips melt out into your mouth, is so much better. These buns can be reheated easily. I don't know how long they last in the fridge because we ate them all.",

      "1. Preheat the oven to 170 C/325 F/Gas Mark 3. Line a 12-count cupcake/muffin tin with paper cupcake cases. Now the reason I have said cupcake cases there is because there is such a huge array of paper cases out there and they all come in different sizes. Muffin cases are a little bit too big and bun cases are just a little bit too small so if you can get cupcake ones they are perfect. I can't give you a specific size because even within those 3 main categories they all seem to vary ever so slightly.",
      "2. Break the eggs into a large mixing bowl and add the brown sugar. Using a handheld electric whisk/standalone electric mixer beat them for around about 5 minutes until the colour is paler and they have grown in size.",
      "3. Add in the oil and the vanilla extract and beat for a further minute or so until the mixture has thickened up slightly.",
      "4. Sift in the flour, cornflour, cocoa powder and baking powder. Add a pinch of salt and fold the lot through gently, so as not to knock out all of the lovely air you have added.",
      "5. Finally add in the buttermilk or milk and again gently fold this through.",
      "6. Divide the mixture evenly between the paper cases, approximately 2 tablespoons per case. Place in the preheated oven and bake for 20 minutes. A clean skewer inserted into the middle of the cakes should come out clean when they are done. Remove from the oven and leave in the tin to cool slightly, about 5 minutes, before removing them from the tin and placing on a wire rack to cool completely.",
      "To make the buttercream:",
      "1. Put the icing sugar in a large bowl and add the butter and beat together using a handheld electric mixer/standalone mixer. I highly recommend covering the bowl and top of the mixer with a tea towel if it doesn't have a shield as the icing sugar will go everywhere for the first couple of minutes. Once the mixture has come together and is smooth add in the milk and vanilla and then beat it for at least 5 minutes. It is very important to beat it for a good few minutes to give a nice light buttercream.",
      "2. Remove half of the mixture and place in a separate bowl. To one half of the mixture add the cocoa powder and gently mix through. To the other half add the green food colouring drop by drop and gently mix through until you have a colour you are happy with. The type of colouring you use will determine how much you need. I used gel colourant and needed 3 drops.",
      "3. Insert the nozzle of your choice into a piping bag. I used a very wide star-shaped one. Fill the bag with the chocolate buttercream. Starting at the centre of each cupcake pipe a spiral shape (see photo). Leave a gap of at least 1cm around the edge. Now pipe one circle on top of the edge of the spiral to form the sides of the nest, leaving a hollow in the centre for the eggs to sit. Repeat until all 12 cupcakes are done. And don't worry if they aren't perfect. They look more nest-like if they are a bit wonky.",
      "4. Insert the nozzle of your choice into another piping bag. I thought I had a nozzle for grass but I didn't so instead I used a flower shaped nozzle. Pipe grass/flowers around the edge of the nest using the green frosting.",
      "5. Pop 2 or 3 mini eggs into each nest and press them down slightly to secure them.",
      "6. Alternately, if you do not have any piping nozzles you could just make all of the icing chocolate buttercream, spoon it onto each cupcake and create a little hollow in each for the eggs to sit."

Then I add a cup of flour to the oil. From then on I am constantly stirring the roux for 30-40 minutes until it turns into a dark brown color. Make sure you constantly stir over the whole surface of the sauce pan. If there is a spot that doesn't get stirred, then the flour will burn to that spot. Once the roux is the dark brown (the longer you stir over heat the darker it gets), I turn the heat to low and add the bowl of onions, green peppers, jalapenos, and garlic to the roux (careful it wants to kinda explode, you might even turn off the burner for this part). and then stir for another 5 minutes to get the vegetables cooked.",

Once the stock and roux are mixed well, I add the 2 cans of diced totmatoes, the worcestershire sauce, bay leaves, salt, pepper, red pepper flakes and whatever other seasonings (maybe go wild with some Tony Chachere's!). Once that comes to a boil, then I add the celery and okra and meat. Bring that back to a boil, and then turn the heat down to a nice simmer. Cover and let it simmer for an hour or two (stirring occasionally). Add the raw seafood at the very end, and cook until done. I throw in shrimp that only takes 5-10 minutes to cook. So I put the shrimp in 5-10 minutes before I serve the gumbo.",

But some will say that it doesn't matter how dark the roux is, it all tastes the same. But I don't know this. I just like the tradition of a dark roux.

      "Just a few notes before we get into the recipe:",
      "1. Weigh your bowl before you add anything to it and jot the number down. I'm not crazy, you'll understand why when we get to it. Use the largest bowl that you have.",
      "2. This cake is easy to make in terms of technique, it's just a bit of mixing and rolling, but it is a big mixture and it has a few ingredients so give yourself about 1 hour for the prep before it gets to the oven.",
      "3. Be organised. Have your tin lined and ready, and all of your ingredients weighed and prepped before you start mixing.",
      "4. In the ingredients list I say \"dried fruit.\" I used sultanas and raisins but feel free to add currants, dried cranberries, some chopped up dried apricots to the mix. As long as all of your dried fruit together weighs 900 grams, you can use whatever you like.",
      "5. This cake is a little bit boozy so might not be to the tastes of smaller people.",
      "Additional equipment needed:",
      "10\"/25cm round cake tin",
      "baking sheet",
      "brown Paper or newspaper",
      "string",
      "1. Weigh your bowl. Place the dried fruit in the bowl and pour over the warm tea, followed by the whiskey/brandy. Give it all a good stir to make sure all of the fruit has some nice boozy liquid on it. Cover the bowl with a clean tea towel and leave the fruit to soak for at least 1 hour, but ideally 24 to 48 hours. Stir the contents every now and then so that the fruit soaks up the liquid evenly.",
      "2. Preheat the oven to 150\u00b0C/300\u00b0F/Gas Mark 2. Line the base and sides of the baking tin with a double layer of parchment paper. Cut a strip of brown paper long enough to wrap around the outside of the tin. Fold this in half lengthways twice so that you have a strip that is 4 layers of paper (I hope that makes sense). Finally, cut a circle of parchment or brown paper the same size as the tin, to use as a template for cutting the layers of marzipan.",
      "3. Add the butter, eggs, treacle and sugar to the fruit mixture and give it a really good stir. Don't worry if it looks a little bit lumpy as the lumps will work themselves out once you add the dry ingredients. This is a very big mixture so I just find it easier to add and mix the ingredients in 2 stages.",
      "4. Sift the flour and spices into the wet mix and add the ginger and lemon zest. Now it's time to really flex your muscles. You will need to stir this for 3-5 minutes to get it nice and smooth. Just when you think it's perfect, scoop the spoon right down to the bottom of the bowl and I'll bet you'll find some liquid lurking down there, so give it another good stir to incorporate all of that.",
      "5. Weigh your bowl again, this time with all of the contents in it. Subtract the weight of the empty bowl from the weight of the full bowl, and divide the answer by 4. This is the weight of mixture that you want to add to the tin for each layer of cake. For me, each layer worked out at approximately 722 grams.",
      "6. Add a quarter of the mixture, whatever weight you calculated that to be, to the bowl and smooth it out. On a work surface dusted with flour, roll out 250 grams of marzipan to a thickness of about 5mm, cut it into a circle using the paper template that you made earlier, and place this on top of the cake mixture. Follow this with a quarter of the cake mixture, 250 grams of marzipan rolled out, a quarter of the cake mixture, 250 grams of marzipan rolled out, and finally the last of the cake mixture. It might come very close to the top of your cake tin, but don't worry, it won't rise (much) when baking so it's fine. Wrap any leftover marzipan in clingfilm to stop it from drying out, you will need it to decorate the cake.",
      "7. Place the cake tin onto a baking sheet, wrap the brown paper around it and secure it in place with some string. The baking tray will make it easier to lift in and out of the oven all wrapped up. Place it into the preheated oven, on the bottom rack, and bake for at least 3 1/2 hours. Check on it after 90 minutes and pop a circle of brown paper with a hole cut out of the middle on top of it to stop the top from browning too much. To check that the cake is done, insert a clean skewer into the centre; if it comes out clean but just smeared with some marzipan, it is done. If there is still some brown cake mixture coming out on the skewer, return it to the oven and check on it at regular intervals. Remove from the oven, place on a wire rack and allow to cool completely in the tin. This will take a few hours.",
      "8. Once the cake has cooled completely, remove it from the tin and carefully peel away the parchment paper. Pop an upturned plate on top of the cake and then flip the whole thing over. Remove the parchment paper from the base of the cake; the bottom will now be the top as it is a nice smooth surface to work on. On a surface dusted with icing sugar, roll out 500 grams of marzipan to a thickness of 10mm. Using the paper template that you made, cut it into a circle for the top of the cake. Warm the apricot jam a little and spread a thin even layer on top of the cake. Place the marzipan disc on top and gently pat down to secure. If you like, you can crimp the edges for a scalloped look. With the remnants of marzipan, make 11 balls to decorate the top of the cake. Make a 12th slightly bigger ball to sit in the centre. Place the whole cake under the grill (broiler) for a couple of minutes to brown the top. Keep a very close eye on it as you don't want it to burn. Once you see the tops of the marzipan balls starting to wrinkle, it's almost done. Allow it to brown just a little before removing it."

      "To avoid a smoky burned sugar mess, stare at your sugar for a good15 minutes (don't rush it by turning up the heat). The water is going to boil away concentrating the syrup and then the sugars will begin to caramelize. This last step occurs quickly, so don't be tempted to step away from the stove.

      "Once the oven is preheated, place the pan inside and reduce the heat to 350\u00b0F. Bake for 30-35 minutes. When a light golden brown, remove from the oven and transfer the Pate a Choux to a wire rack immediately to cool.",

      "When the milk and butter mixture comes to a boil, remove from heat immediately and pour a third of the hot milk into the bowl with the eggs and cornstarch while mixing with the whisk (this will temper the mixture).

Then place 8 wide mouth half-pint mason jars on top of the paper towels. Fill a tea kettle with water and put it on to boil. When the water boils, turn off the heat.",

As soon as the sugar melts and starts to caramelize, stir it. When the color is uniform, stir in another 2 tablespoons of sugar and continue to stir until it is melted and colored. Continue with the remaining 1/4 cup sugar, adding it 2 tablespoons at a time. When all the sugar is deep amber, almost mahogany-colored, stand away from the pan so you don't get splattered, and stir in the warm liquid. The mixture will bubble furiously and probably seize up, but don't panic. Just keep stirring patiently and it will smooth out. Pull the pan from the heat.",
      "Put the eggs, yolks, and reserved 1/4 cup sugar in a large glass measuring cup or a small bowl and whisk until pale and slightly thickened. Still whisking, drizzle in a little of the warm caramel liquid. This will gently warm the eggs so they won't curdle. Whisking constantly, slowly pour in the remaining liquid. If there is foam at the top of the custard, skim it off with a spoon. If you leave the foam, it will form little craters on top of the baked custards. It's not a crime, but the custards are definitely prettier without the little foam craters. Divide the custard evenly between the mason jars.",

Allow the custards to rest in their warm bath for 10 minutes, then peel off the foil and transfer the mason jars from the hot water (careful!) to the cooling rack. Refrigerate when they reach room temperature. When the custards are cool, cover them tightly with their mason jar lids.",

Increase heat to medium-high and bring to a boil, occasionally swirling pan and brushing down sides with a wet pastry brush. It will thicken and turn deeper in color. After about 5 to 6 minutes, it should be deep amber in color. Don't let it get too dark. If it starts to smell a bit burnt, immediately remove pan from heat. Gradually add vanilla cream. The mixture will bubble vigorously. Whisk over medium heat until smooth and thick, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat and whisk in butter and salt. Strain into a heatproof bowl. Let cool slightly.",
      "To serve the caramel custard pots:",
      "I prefer to eat the caramel custard pots chilled. Spoon some of the salted caramel sauce over each custard and top with some lightly sweetened whipped cream and crushed cookie wafers.",
      "It is best to prepare this dessert the day before you want to eat it. The custards should chill for a few hours or overnight to set properly. Just prepare the custards, caramel sauce, and cookie crumbles the day prior. And make the sweetened whipped cream on the day you want to serve. The pots can be completely assembled a few hours before serving.",

      "1. The photographed pie was made using a round of packaged, refrigerated puff pastry, 12-inches (about 31 cm) in diameter. If you have a choice, refrigerated, packaged puff pastry is of better quality than most frozen varieties. Thaw frozen pastry in the refrigerator before rolling it out.",
      "2. It is more likely that the pie will cut into slices without falling apart if it is made a day in advance. When it has completely cooled, cover the top with a cotton napkin, then with plastic wrap and refrigerate it overnight. The next day, bring the pie to room temperature before cutting and serving.",
      "Making the pie:",
      "1. Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F.",
      "2. Roll out the puff pastry into a circle big enough to line the tart pan with a bit of overhand and fit the pastry into the shell.",
      "3. Place the pastry-lined pan in the freezer for a few minutes to stiffen the pastry a little. Fold and tuck the overhand into the space between the tart pan and the pastry shell so that the line of the fold is now the border of the tart shell. (The photo in Step 5 of the related link illustrates the formed shell.) Crimp the border all around between your fingers. Refrigerate the shell while making the filling.",
      "4. Mix together the eggs and sugar. Add the vanilla and salt.",
      "5. Mix in the corn syrup and butter. Then stir in the chopped pecans.",
      "6. Take the pastry shell from the refrigerator and pour the filling into it.",
      "7. Arrange pecan halves in concentric circles on top of the filling and bake the pie for 50 minutes. Cool it completely on a rack."

      "4. In a separate bowl lightly whisk the eggs with the vanilla extract and melted butter. Add this to the sugar mixture until well combined. Set aside.",
      "Rolling Out the Crust:",

      "3. Take 1/2 cup of those pecans and chop them up. Gently stir them into the top of the filling. Spread the other 1 cup of pecan halves over the pie so the outer (pretty) part of the pecan halves face up until the pie is completely covered.",
      "4. Place the pie in the centre of the oven at 375F for 30 minutes. Then lower the heat to 350F and leave the pie in for another 30 minutes. Lowering the heat halfway through prevents the edges of the pie from browning too much.",

I use a Dutch oven on the stove top to do this as I want to have enough room for everything inside the pot.",

After they are done, push them around to the outer rim of the pot and place the egg in the middle and let cook for a minute before incorporating. Once it has cooked a little, mix the carrots, pork, and egg together well. Turn the heat to low and add salt and pepper (this is to taste); stir well to combine. Add the rice in batches to get everything evenly incorporated. Add around a tablespoon of the sesame oil or more depending on how dry your rice looks (usually, with the fat from the bacon, not much is needed in the rice). Add soy sauce (this is to taste; I don't add a lot to mine), around 2 to 3 tablespoons. Now add in the bacon. This will help it to stay crisp in the rice. Mix well. Taste and add more salt if needed."

Using a small paring knife, trim the edges of the dough to make straight, even lines.",

      "1. In the bowl of your stand mixer, pour in 1 cup of hot water. Make sure the water is hot but not boiling! If it boils, it will kill the yeast. Also add 1/2 cup of honey and the yeast. Let it sit in the bowl for at least 5 minutes to allow the yeast to proof.",
      "2. In a separate bowl, mix together 4 cups of all-purpose flour and 1 1/2 teaspoons of salt and set aside.",
      "3. In another bowl or measuring cup, mix together 2 eggs and 1/4 cup of vegetable oil and set aside.",
      "4. After the yeast has proofed for 5 minutes, slowly stir in the egg and oil mixture. Then, with the mixer on low speed, stir in the dry ingredients, one cup at a time. Give the dry ingredients time to mix in before adding the next cup. If you still feel the dough is too sticky or wet, add in another 1/2 cup of flour. If you feel it is too dry, pour in another tablespoon of hot water.",
      "5. Once the dough is mixed together and has formed a nice smooth dough ball in the mixer, turn the speed up one setting and allow the mixer to do the kneading for you for 3 minutes.",
      "6. Once the dough is kneaded, take it out of the bowl with your hands, take the bowl off the mixer and spray the bowl with some cooking spray. Smooth the dough by turning it down on itself and then toss it in the cooking spray coated bowl and leave the smooth side up. Put the bowl in a warm place (I put mine on the stove underneath the stove light) and cover lightly with a clean tea towel.",
      "7. Let the dough sit and rise for 1 hour. After an hour, punch it down lightly with your fingertips. Cover it again with the towel and let it rise for another hour.",
      "8. Once the second hour has passed, preheat your oven to 350\u00b0F.",
      "9. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured board. Here is where you can go two different ways.",
      "10. For 2 regular sized loaves: If you want to make 2 loaves, split the dough in half. Split each half into thirds so you can braid it into a traditional challah. Stretch the thirds into long snakes (about 10-12 inches long). Lay the three \"snakes\" next to each other and pinch the top of the 3 strips tightly together. Then just braid the challahs like you would braid hair, simply by crossing the \"snakes\" over one another. Once it is braided, pinch the bottom end together tightly and then tuck both ends under themselves. That will just keep them from coming apart as they bake. Repeat with the other loaf. Carefully transfer the loaves onto a parchment paper lined baking sheet and then let them rest and rise for another 30 minutes.",
      "11. For 6 individual sized loaves: If you want to make 6 individual challah loaves, cut the dough into sixths. Then cut each sixth into thirds if you want to braid them like I did. See the instructions above about braiding. You can also just roll each sixth into a long snake and roll it up like a spiral. Transfer the loaves onto 2 parchment paper lined baking sheets and let them rest for 30 minutes.",
      "12. As they are resting, mix together 2 eggs with 2 tablespoons of water to make an egg wash. Lightly brush the challah loaves with the egg wash and then place them in the preheated oven. Bake the loaves for 10 minutes and then brush again with the egg wash. Bake for another 10 minutes and brush again. Why all the egg wash brushing, you ask? Simply because it gives them a beautiful shine and brown color! Bake for another 5 minutes. At this point, the little loaves should be finished. If not, then bake for 2 minute periods until they are cooked. The larger loaves will probably need a total of 30-35 minutes. When done remove them from the oven and you are ready to go."

      "Lay the fries out on a paper or flour sack towel. Sprinkle evenly with salt and let sit for 30 minutes. This helps the squash to \"sweat\" and pull some of the water out.",
      "When they are finished sweating, pat dry any remaining moisture. Coat the fries VERY lightly with olive oil. I usually wet my hands with oil and rub it on the fries. You can even skip the oil if you put the fries on a nonstick sheet (that can handle high temperatures).",
      "Broil the fries for a few minutes on one side or until the outside looks a little dry and slightly crispy. Take the pan out of the oven and using a spatula, flip the fries over. Do the same for all sides. If your fries are thin, you can keep broiling and flipping till they reach the desired outcome. If your fries are thick, you can turn the oven down to 425\u00b0F after broiling and continue to roast the fries till they are finished.",
      "Broiling the fries first helps to make the fries crispy and not soggy. However, butternut squash can burn easily, so toward the end of cooking, keep a close eye on them or you will end up with a heap of charred squash.",
      "Cool the fries slightly on a paper/flour sack towel, spreading them out so they are not laying on top of each other. This will make them get soggy.",
      "Hopefully you have a great oven. If so, this will be a breeze. If you have an oven like mine however, you may need to remove some fries earlier than others and turn the pan a few times during cooking.",

If you want to be able to retain the soft, fluffy texture and use it for sandwich bread (and really anything other than fresh eating) let it sit in the pan for 10-15 minutes after you have removed it from the oven. This is where making 2 loaves comes in handy, especially if you're like me and have very little self control when it comes to fresh baked bread. Sacrifice one loaf to save the other (lol).",
      "After the bread has sat in the pan for 10-15 minutes, remove it from the loaf pan and set it on a cooling rack. Cover with a plastic grocery bag or tea towel and let it sit for 20-30 minutes undisturbed. After 30 minutes remove the covering and let it cool completely. When it it is completely cool, wrap it in plastic wrap or place in an air tight container - don't use it until the next day! This not only will help it retain a soft, fluffy, almost \"store-bought bread\" like texture, but will make it easier to slice thinly for sandwiches, toast etc."

      "Wrap the beets tightly in aluminum foil. Make sure all the ends are sealed. Use more than one sheet of foil and line your baking pan with some foil as well. Beets tend to leak sticky juice when they roast and you don't want to have to clean that off every surface of your oven.",
      "Place the pan into a 400\u00b0F oven and roast for anywhere from 1 to 1 1/2 hours depending on the size of your beets. To check for doneness, carefully unwrap the foil (watch out for hot steam) and insert the tip of a sharp knife into the largest beet. It should penetrate easily. If done, remove them from the oven, open the foil wrap and leave them to cool enough to be handled.",
      "Once cool, use a paring knife to peel the beets. The peel will come off very easily.",
      "Now you have delicious roasted beets waiting to be sliced and incorporated into any number of preparations. Sometimes, for a quick snack, I slice them, pour some sherry vinegar over them, add some thinly sliced red onions and toss on some crumbled goat or feta cheese. The tang of sharp cheese and the bite of the onion and vinegar go so well with the naturally sweet beets.",

Or if you are feeling really adventurous, why not skip the nutritional flakes and spinach, and stuff them instead with cinnamon, margarine, and brown sugar. Yum!"
