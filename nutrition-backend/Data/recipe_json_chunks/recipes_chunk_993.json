      "I start with chopping up the Onion, Peppers, and Celery fairly fine, 1/4 inch pieces at most, and set aside together in a bowl. Then chop up the Green Onion and Garlic, set aside seperately. Mix the spices into a bowl, set aside. With the 2 double batches I've made so far the veggies have filled a 10 cup size tupperware container.",
      "Peel the Shrimp and set aside. With the Clam Juice simmer all the Shrimp shells in a pan to add flavor to the Clam Juice. When done strain the shells out of the juice and set aside. Toss the shells.",
      "Next its usually a good idea to start the rice. Preheat oven to 350. For this recipe its nice to bake it, more flavorful. I use the bread loaf baking pans for this and find that I can fit 2 Cups of Rice with 4 Cups of Chicken Stock in the pan. For a double batch party I bake 3 pans. Add a little bit of the spice mixture and some Garlic Powder. Its up to you how much spice to add but Jim has found through many batchs that just mildly seasonning the rice is better so you can use the rice to moderate how spicey the meal is when you sit to eat. Cover with foil and seal. Bake for 1 hours - 1 hours 10 min - 20 minutes.",
      "All the above steps can be done the day before to help spread out the work.",

      "Now you can start making the Roux. Have all the ingredients that you prepared handy because once you begin you won't be able to leave the Roux or stop stirring it.",
      "The 2 double batches that I've made up to this point filled to the brim a 6 quart stock pot so use something at least that size or larger. For the best results use a wooden spoon and cast iron pot. We have designated gear just for this stage of the cookin. After you eat this you won't think we're so fanatical hehe. But we are, about our Ettoufe' anyway.",
      "Take a cup of Olive Oil and heat over a med-high flame until just a pinch of flour bubbles, at which point add the 1 cup of Flour. Stir continuously (but very carefully, will give ya a good burn if you splatter yourself, mainly your fingers). If any brown flecks appear remove from the heat immediately and continue to stir until the flecks disappear. Return to the heat. Continue this process until the Roux is a peanut butter colored or darker. NOTE: If you see black specs in the Roux then it has burned and must be discarded. The Roux process requires constant attention and viligance. Helps to have a beer to sample during this stage too.",
      "After reaching your desired color reduce the heat to low and add the Onion, Peppers, and Celery with approximately a TBS of the spice mixture. Mix well until the veggies have cooked some, translucent (about 5 minutes). Add the Clam Juice and mix well. Raise the heat to med-high and stir continuosly watching for sticking on the bottom of the pan. Add the butter, garlic, and remaining spices. At this point you can also add the Bay Leaf for added flavor. Bring to a full boil for a least 1 minute while stirring. This is important as it removes any flour taste form the Roux. NOTE: If the butter later seperates and sits on the surface shake the pot to remusify for 5 minutes, stirring won't do the trick.",
      "Reduce the heat and add the Shrimp and Green Onions, stir until the shrimp is cooked, serve over the rice. When I made Ettoufe' last weekend if took me about 1 hour 10 minutes from the start of the Roux till ready to serve. Left overs seem to take on better flavor as it ages and it also freezes well too.",
      "We've had lots of parties centered around just this dish. After you've made it and created some Ettoufe' fiends it's not to hard to get them to help make it the next time. So then you can have some folks work on the shrimp while others work on the veggies. This will of course free you up to concentrate on the key piece of the Ettoufe', the Roux. And of course with a good batch you still get all the credit too! Enjoy!"

      "Add the tomato paste, ketchup, chili powder, Worcestershire sauce, vinegar, salt, and pepper, if using. Stir well until the tomato paste has dissolved and the meat is mostly broken up.",
      "Continue to cook the chili at a slow boil, stirring about every 5 minutes or so, until the mixture is thick, about 15 minutes. As the mixture thickens, you may need to reduce the heat to medium-low or low to prevent sticking.",
      "Many Southerners prefer chili that is finely ground (roughly the consistency of cooked oatmeal) because it's easier to spread on a hot dog and easier to eat as well. To try it this way, place the chili (cooled at least 20 minutes) in a blender or food processor and blend on high until finely ground, 30 to 45 seconds.",
      "While the chili simmers and about 12 to 15 minutes before you plan to serve the chili dogs, turn on a gas grill to medium-high.",
      "Place the hot dogs on the hot grill and cook until heated through and just beginning to brown all over, about 5 minutes. Heat the buns on the grill, if desired. To serve, place each hot dog in a bun and smother with chili.",
      "Make-ahead: The chili can be refrigerated, covered, for up to 2 days or it can be frozen for up to 2 months. * If the chili has been frozen, thaw it in a microwave oven on the defrost setting, following the manufacturer's directions and stirring after each 1-minute interval, then reheat. * To reheat, place the chili in a microwave-safe container, cover with a paper towel, and microwave on high until heated through, 2 to 3 minutes for 1 cup, stopping once halfway through."

      "While you're waiting for the cream to infuse, make sure your truffle candy molds are clean and completely dry. This recipe yields about 30 deep 1-inch truffles, so either have 30 cavities ready, or be prepared to clean and re-use the same mold multiple times.",
      "Melt the white candy coating in the microwave until it's melted and smooth. Fill the molds entirely with the coating, then turn them upside down to let most of the coating drip out, so you will be left with a thin layer of coating on the inside of the molds.",
      "Turn the molds right side up, and use a bench scraper or a metal spatula to scrape excess coating from the top of the mold. Place the molds in the refrigerator to set the coating while you prepare the filling.",
      "Place the chopped white chocolate or white chocolate chips in a heatsafe bowl. Return the cream to the heat, and bring it to a simmer. Pour the hot cream through a strainer over the chopped chocolate, so that the lemon zest is removed. Gently whisk the cream and chocolate together until the mixture is shiny and smooth and the chocolate is entirely melted. This is your \"ganache.\" Whisk in a few drops of green food coloring, until you get a green you like that seems appropriately slime-like. Allow the ganache to cool to room temperature, whisking occasionally. You do not want it the least bit hot when it is time to fill the truffles.",
      "Once the ganache is room temperature, and the coating that lines the insides of the molds is set, spoon some of the ganache into each cavity. Leave a 1/8\" space at the top, so that the bottom can be sealed properly to the rest of the truffle and there won't be any leakage. Refrigerate the truffles until the ganache is cold. It will never \"set\" and get hard, but it should reach a stage where it flows very slowly when you tilt the molds. About 2 hours in the refrigerator should do it.",
      "Once the ganache is cold, re-warm the remaining white candy coating and spoon a little bit on top of each truffle. Spread it with a knife or spatula so that the bottom of every truffle is covered with chocolate, then scrape off the excess from the top of the mold. Refrigerate the truffles to set the coating, about 15 minutes.",
      "Once the coating is set, turn the molds upside-down and gently pop the truffles out of the molds. If you're re-using the molds, wipe the insides to remove any lingering coating shards, then repeat the whole process. If you'd like, decorate the tops of the truffles with green food coloring or luster dust.",

      "1. FOR THE FILLING: Heat 2 teaspoons oil in Dutch oven over medium-high heat until just smoking. Add beef, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1 teaspoon pepper and cook, breaking up pieces with spoon, until liquid evaporates and meat begins to sizzle, 10 to 15 minutes. Drain meat in colander and set aside.",
      "2. Add remaining 2 teaspoons oil to now-empty Dutch oven and heat over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until just beginning to brown, about 2 minutes. Stir in drained beef, cabbage, and chicken broth. Bring to simmer, cover, and cook until cabbage is tender, about 5 minutes. Uncover and continue to cook until liquid evaporates and mixture begins to sizzle, 5 to 7 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Transfer to bowl and let cool 15 minutes. Stir in Colby Jack and let cool to room temperature. Refrigerate until ready to assemble bierocks.",
      "3. FOR THE DOUGH: Meanwhile, grease large bowl. Combine milk, water, butter, and sugar in 2-cup liquid measuring cup. Microwave until temperature registers 110 degrees, 1 to 2 minutes. Using stand mixer fitted with dough hook, mix 31/2 cups flour, yeast, and salt on low speed until combined, about 30 seconds. With mixer running, slowly add milk mixture and single beaten egg until incorporated and dough comes together, about 3 minutes. Increase speed to medium-low and continue to mix until dough is smooth and pulls away from sides of bowl, about 8 minutes. If after 4 minutes dough looks wet, add remaining 1/4 cup flour, 1 tablespoon at a time, until dough clears sides of bowl but sticks to bottom. Transfer dough to greased bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and let rise in warm place until doubled in size, 50 to 60 minutes.",
      "4. Adjust oven racks to upper-middle and lower-middle positions and heat oven to 375 degrees. Line 2 rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper. Transfer dough to lightly floured counter and divide into 12 equal (23/4-ounce) portions. Form dough pieces into balls, cover with plastic, and let rest for 5 minutes.",
      "5. Working with 1 dough ball at a time (keep remaining balls covered with plastic), roll out into 51/2-inch round with rolling pin. Transfer 1/2 cup lightly packed filling (3 ounces) to center of round. Use hands to press filling into compact mound. Stretch edges of dough over filling and pinch together to form bun. Arrange 6 bierocks, seam side down, on each prepared baking sheet, 2 inches apart. Cover with plastic and let rise until doubled in size, 45 to 60 minutes.",
      "6. Discard plastic, brush bierocks with egg wash, and bake until golden brown, 22 to 25 minutes, switching and rotating sheets halfway through baking. Transfer sheets to wire rack and let cool for 15 minutes. Serve.",
      "TO MAKE AHEAD: Baked, cooled bierocks can be tightly wrapped in aluminum foil, placed in zipper-lock bag, and refrigerated for up to 3 days or frozen for up to 1 month. To reheat, adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350 degrees. Place foil-wrapped bierocks directly on oven rack until heated through, about 10 minutes if refrigerated or 60 minutes if frozen."

Cover the dough and allow to rest for 30 minutes.",
      "At the end of 30 minutes, briefly knead the dough for an additional minute or two. Then, roll the dough into a sausage shape, about 1 1/2-inches in diameter. Measure the cylinder into 16 equal size pieces. Cut and roll each piece into a smooth ball. Moisten fingers with a bit of sesame oil. Flatten each ball out to make a round, biscuit shaped disc. Place the disc on a flat surface and brush top with sesame oil. Similarly, flatten out another ball into a disc of similar diameter and place it atop the first. Roll out this double biscuit into a circle about 6 or 7 inches in diameter. Complete this procedure using the rest of the dough.",
      "Heat a skillet, brushing the inside bottom with sesame oil. Add one of the double pancakes and cook 30 seconds. Flip and cook another half minute, taking care that they do not brown. Quickly lift the pancake away from the hot surface and slap it down on the work surface. While the pancake is still warm, peel the double cake apart into two pancakes. Reserve. Repeat until all of the cakes have been completed. Stack in a sheet of foil. Carefully seal the foil with pancakes into a packet and steam 20-30 minutes before use. Serve warm."
