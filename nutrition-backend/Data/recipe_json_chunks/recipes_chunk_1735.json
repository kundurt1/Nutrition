      "Another way to temper chocolate is called seeding.",
      "In this method, add small pieces of unmelted chocolate to melted chocolate.",
      "The amount of unmelted chocolate to be added depends on the temperature of the melted chocolate, but is usually 1/4 of the total amount.",
      "It is easiest to use an immersion blender for this, or a whisk.",
      "The classic way to temper chocolate is called tabliering.",
      "Two thirds of the melted chocolate is poured onto a marble or another cold work surface.",
      "The chocolate is spread out and worked with a spatula until its temperature is approximately 81 degrees F. At this stage, it is thick and begins to set.",
      "This tempered chocolate is then added to the remaining non-tempered chocolate and mixed thoroughly until the mass has a completely uniform temperature.",
      "If the temperature is still too high, part of the chocolate is worked further on the cold surface until the correct temperature is reached.",
      "This is a lot of work, requires a lot of room, and makes a big mess.",
      "A simple method of checking tempering, is to apply a small quantity of chocolate to a piece of paper or to the point of a knife.",

      "The stuffing: in a small bowl, combine the parsley, mixed herbs, shallot, garlic, and allspice.",

      "Press the stuffing into the meat with your hands to make it adhere, and spread it around so that it covers the entire inside surface.",
      "Roll the lamb up into a cylinder, and tie it neatly and snugly with kitchen string.",

      "(The lamb can be prepared to this point and refrigate for up to 18 hours before braising.",

      "Heat the oven to 325 degrees.",

      "Lower the lamb into the pot with tongs, and brown it evenly, turning to brown all sides, until mahogany in spots but not at all burnt, 10 to 12 minutes total.",
      "Transfer the lamb to a platter.",
      "Add the bones to the pot if you have them, and brown them as best you can without charring, turning them ever 4 minutes, for about 12 minutes.",
      "Set aside with the lamb.",

      "If the bottom is at all blackened, wipe those bits out with a damp paper towel, doing your best to leave behind the caramelized juices.",

      "Add the tomato paste and stir it in with a wooden spoon so it coats the carrots and onions.",
      "Add the teaspoon of herbs, the bay leaves, and parsley stems.",

      "Boil to reduce the wine by about half, about 2 minutes.",
      "Pour in the stock and bring to a boil.",
      "Continue to boil, stirring occasionally, for about 4 minutes allowing the flavors to meld.",
      "The braise: return the lamb to the pot, along with any juices that have seeped from the meat, and tuck the bones, if using, around the meat.",
      "Cover with a piece of parchment paper, pressing down so the paper nearly touched the meat and the edges extend over the sides of the pot by about an inch.",
      "Then put the lid in place, and slide the pot onto a rack in the lower third of the oven.",

      "Continue to braise, turning the lamb with tongs and basting once or twice, until the meat is fork-tender and cooked through, 2 to 2 1/2 hours.",
