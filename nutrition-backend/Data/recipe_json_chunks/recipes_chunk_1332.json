Turn off the mixer and add 1 cup of flour, along with the sugar and salt. Mix on medium until the dough starts to come together, about 30 seconds. Add the butter and mix on medium until it's incorporated, about 30 seconds.",

Start adding the remaining flour, 1/4 cup at a time (turning the mixer off for each addition) and knead the dough on medium until it completely pulls away from the side of the bowl and is smooth and not too sticky, about 1 minute. The dough will be very soft and moist but not so sticky that you can't roll it out. (For this step, you may only need to use as little as 1/4 cup flour, so there may be flour leftover.)

Using doughnut or cookie cutters, cut out 3-inch-diameter rounds with 1-inch-diameter holes. (For filled doughnuts, don't cut out the holes.) Arrange the doughnuts on the prepared baking sheet, leaving at least 1 inch between doughnuts. Cover the doughnuts loosely with plastic wrap and let them proof in a warm place until almost doubled in size, 30 to 40 minutes. Check to see if the doughnuts are ready every 5 to 10 minutes. To test, use a fingertip to lightly touch one of the doughnuts. If the dough springs back immediately, it needs more time; if it springs back slowly, it's ready; and if the dough doesn't spring back at all, it's over-proofed. You can punch down and reroll over-proofed dough once.",

In a heavy-bottomed large pot or deep fryer, heat at least 2 inches of oil until a deep-fry thermometer registers 360\u00b0F. Working in batches, use a slotted metal spoon or spatula to carefully place the doughnuts in the hot oil. Fry, flipping once, until light golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Transfer as done to the wire rack and return the oil to 360\u00b0F between batches. Let the doughnuts cool slightly before glazing with the",

Not like ragers where everyone gets drunk and blah blah, those parties are not the parties IAAAm talking about. Even though, some of you might think that those are the only kinds of parties you should have. My MomAAAs parties are always dinner parties or lunch parties, basically meal parties. Parties where tons of food is served and numerous dishes are prepared. Why do Iranian hosts prepare so many dishes for their guests? Basically itAAAs a confidence thing, theyAAAre worried that their guests might not like a certain dish, so they make so many dishes that your guest would have to find something they like. Because remember people, upsetting your guests is basically a Persian host or hostessAAAs worst nightmare, so a Persian hostess will most likely always choose making sure her guests are happy."

    "title": "red summer fruit pudding",
    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "Prepare fruit by removing any bad berries, etc. Remove crusts from bread. Butter the inside of a 3-pt. pudding basin then line the basin with the bread slices - do not leave any gaps (overlap if necessary.) Press the edges together so the bread forms a complete mold inside the bowl. Reserve about 1/2 lb. raspberries for decoration at end. Place remaining berries with sugar and lemon zest into saucepan. Bring the mixture to a gentle simmer until the sugar is dissolved and the fruits are releasing their juices - takes about 5 minutes - don't overcook as you want the fruits to keep their shapes. Reserve about 3/4 C. of the juice, then cool and refrigerate. Pour the remainder of the fruit into the pudding basin - seal the top completely with slices of bread. Cover the bread with a flat plate/saucer that fits snugly inside the basin, then weigh down the plate with a 3-lb. weight (very heavy can or jar will do.)Leave in fridge overnight, the weight will cause the juice to bleed through the bread, staining it red. Gently slide a flexible spatula between the bread and the basin to loosen. Invert the bowl onto a serving dish - it should slide easily into place. Add a few drops of red coloring to the 3/4 C. set aside fruit juice, and use this to gently coat any areas that still have a white tinge - pour remainder of juice over entire pudding. Put the reserved raspberries all around the bottom of the pudding. Serve with real whipped cream and a sprig of mint or vanilla ice cream (optional.)."

Leave it alone, without turning it, so the meat browns and caramelizes. Meanwhile, add the lard. The meat has a lot of moisture in it, so a good amount of steam will come from the pan before it is caramelized. As it browns, slowly turn each piece with tongs. Once all sides are caramelized, remove the meat from the pan with a slotted spoon and place on a cookie sheet to cool, leaving juices in the Dutch oven to saute vegetables. Add the onions and garlic and saute for 5 minutes over medium heat until they start to caramelize and get soft. Add the jalapenos and allow to cook for 2 more minutes until soft. Add the tomato paste. Some of the same spices as were used on the meat will be used in the sauce. Add the remaining 2 teaspoons of the cumin, 1 teaspoon of the cinnamon, the oregano, and 2 heaping tablespoons of the chili powder. Add beer. Stir to incorporate everything. Add diced tomatoes, and stir. Then add the reserved meat. Add chicken stock. Simmer for 1 1/2 hours until meat is wonderfully tender. Strain juice from the black beans, add the beans to the chili pot and bring up to simmer. Then add chunks of bittersweet chocolate. Stir until it melts. Serve immediately or store in the refrigerator for 2 to 3 days."

      "Drop your pasta into salted, boiling water. In a large fry pan start cooking the 1/2 of a chopped medium onion, the sliced sausage, the minced garlic and 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Cook on medium-high heat until everything in the pan begins to brown (be careful, garlic goes from brown to black very quickly). Add 1 1/2 cups of water to the pan and return to a high simmer. Add all of the seasonings, cook until the pasta finishes. Once I drained the pasta I thickened my sauce with a tablespoon of corn starch in half a cup of water. It's not entirely necessary to thicken this sauce, so it's up to you. Drop your shrimp and your sliced green onion into the pan and cook until the shrimp is done. If your shrimp are raw, it's going to take longer (obviously). Do not cook the shrimp until they curl up, this is way over done, aim for sometime before this (the shrimp in my pic are overcooked, I didn't account for the amount of time they would sit there waiting for me to get my shot set up . . .) Add the pasta and fold everything together over low heat until it incorporates. Note: this pasta can be rather spicy depending on what kind of sausage you use. To be honest, this isn't spicy enough for me (I like stuff cranky hot) but make sure and test the sauce before you add Creole seasoning to be certain it's not already spicy enough for you."

Whether to shred the meat like pulled pork or leave it in cubes I think is determined by what you're used to eating. Texas isn't a pulled-pork state so the texture isn't as familiar as nicely done chunks. Likewise, I think the brilliance of this recipe lies in its simplicity. You can add as many different spices, herbs and aromatics as you like-but if you have good-tasting, happy pork why not let its flavor shine with just a bit of salt? Ultimately, however, making carnitas is a highly personal affair and so make them as they best suit you!"
