To test baking soda, put a few tablespoons of white vinegar into a small bowl and add a teaspoon of baking soda. It should bubble up furiously, and the foaming should take several moments to subside. The more bubbles, the more potent the baking soda. If there is no reaction, or you only end up with a handful of small bubbles, you need to replace your baking soda.To test baking powder, baking powder, pour a teaspoonful of baking powder into a bowl or small glass.Fill the bowl with hot water to cover the baking powder (about 1/4 cup should do it).If the baking powder begins to bubble furiously, it's fine to use in your recipes.Tip: For best results, do not dip a wet spoon into the can of baking powder when measuring what you need. The moisture will activate the baking powder left behind in the can and it won't be as good to use next time. If you see lumps in your baking powder, that's usually a sign moisture has found its way inches."

    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "FOR SQUASH:",
      "1. Preheat the oven to 375 and set two oven racks evenly apart. Cut each squash in -half lengthwise and scoop out and discard the seeds and stringy pulp. Place 1 1/2 teaspoons of butter inside each squash half and season with salt and pepper. Place the squash halves cut-side down in a baking dish large enough to hold all four (divide them among two baking dishes if they do not fit in one). Add enough water to go 1/2 inch up each squash half. Bake the squash until the skins start to brown and the flesh is tender, about 45 minutes. Remove from the oven (leaving the oven on), flip over so the flesh is exposed, and set aside to cool. When the squash halves are cool enough to handle, scoop out the flesh and discard the skins, reserving the flesh and baking liquid.",
      "2. Toss the pumpkin seeds with the vegetable oil, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and the thyme, then spread them out on a baking sheet. Bake until just lightly browned, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove and let cool.",
      "3. Set a large soup pot over medium-low heat and add the olive oil. Add the onion and garlic and sweat by cooking them until the onions are translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the apple and fennel, season with salt and pepper, and sweat until the fennel is translucent, about 15 minutes more.",
      "4. Add the wine and simmer to reduce almost all of the liquid. Add the broth, cider, reserved squash liquid, and the squash flesh. Bring them to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer until the squash is very tender, about 1 1/2 hours.",
      "5. Meanwhile, slowly melt the remaining 1/4 cup butter in a heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat. Continue heating until the milk solids begin to fall to the bottom of the pot and start to brown. Take care not to let the solids blacken, removing the butter from the heat when it is dark after 10 to 15 minutes. Strain the brown butter through a fine-mesh sleeve and discard the solids.",
      "6. Working with a blender, puree the soup until smooth. Add the brown butter slowly, stopping to loosen the ingredients with a wooden spoon if necessary. Add additional broth to thin the soup if it's too thick. Adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper.",
      "7. Ladle the soup into bowls, drizzle with sherry gastrique (recipe below), and sprinkle with the toasted pumpkin seeds.",
      "FOR SHERRY GASTRIQUE:",
      "1. Combine the vinegar, sugar, thyme, and peppercorns in a small heavy-bottomed nonreactive pot. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium-low. Summer the liquid to reduce until syrupy, 8 to 10 minutes.",
      "2. Cool the liquid and strain out the thyme and peppercorns. You can store in a tightly sealed container (no need to refrigerate) for up to 1 month."

      "The most important part of cooking with an iron skillet is to heat the pan first without any fat inside. When it is really hot, add your chicken fat ) shmaltz. Turn down the heat to simmer. I play with the gas burner while cooking, up and down according to the heat in the pan. If you notice the oil burning, turn down the heat. I immediately add the chopped onions after I added the oil. Keep stirring with a wooden spoon. The onions will turn translucent. If there is not enough shmaltz oil in the pan add a little vegtable oil and continue cooking the onions. Try not to overcook the onions. Take them out before they turn brown. While this is going on, rinse the livers under cold water and drain. After the onions are removed from the pan clean the pan with a slotted spoon of any dark pieces of onion. Then add a little more shmalltz to the pan and some livers. Do not crowd the pan. Cook livers one pan at a time. I constantly keep turning the livers. I cut into the liver to see if it is done. It should be cooked all the way thru just not burned. Next, combine the livers and the onions in a bowl. In the cuisinart fitted with the blade on the bottom place a small amount of the ingredients and pulse until you like the consistancy. I like it soft like a pate. Do this until all of the liver and onions are finely mashed. I then combine the pate with the hand chopped onions. Add salt and pepper to taste. I like the pate to be slightly more peppery. It looks nice to garnish with the extra chopped raw onions and if you like, some chopped hard boiled eggs. During passover, you can eat this with matzah or serve with crackers. Place in refrigerator immediately after preparation for at least a few hours in a sealed container. I enjoy the liver after it is removed from the frig for 20 minute Happy Cooking!"

Set up the smoker using the wood chips and smoke the beef over medium heat with the lid cracked until the first wisps of smoke rise and close lid; then reduce the heat to medium-low once the lid of the smoker is closed, for 30 minutes.",
      "While the beef is smoking, set the oven to 'Warm' or 200\u00b0F.",

      "Note: When buying beef to make jerky, choose a piece that is about 3 inches long and fairly thin. It will be easier to make strips of the right size. First, cut with the grain into 1/4-inch strips. Lay the strips flat and cut them lengthwise intl 1/2-inch or so widths. Finally, if necessary, cut the strips to about 3 inches in length. Don't worry if the pieces are irregular, that's part of the fun of making your own jerky. Do make sure they are no thicker than 1/4-inch or they won't dry properly."

      "My Notes: Some time I didn't have a box mix so I made a yellow cake from scratch! It was wonderful! Using one cup of milk in pudding is CRUICIAL! As is letting the pudding and cake cool completely. The pudding turns stiff, kinda like Mousse or Flan. That makes it PERFECT for spreading between layers.",
      "I used less milk in the pudding (1cup) might try 1&1/2c. next time. Chilled the pudding first and the cakes before putting together. I also sliced the rounded top off the bottom cake so pudding would sit nicely. French vanilla instant pudding gives it the custard effect. Extremely easy.",
      "I used French Vanilla cake mix and pudding because that's what I had. I also used only 1Cup milk - I think I could have used 1 1/4 and had a little more pudding, but it worked out fine. The key is to make sure EVERYTHING is cool. I put the cake and pudding in the fridge before assembling. With the cake cold the icing cooled quickly and set easily on the cake instead of just drizzling off the cake and onto the pan."

Once the oil is starting to get good and hot, toss in the pre-cooked rice. Let this sizzle and stir for a moment, and then make a well in the bottom for the onions, garlic, and eggs. Add a little oil if needed. Brown the onions, garlic, and eggs and then stir the rice back in on top of it. Keep stirring and mixing until the eggs are thoroughly cooked. Add in the soy sauce, and mix it some more. Keep stirring and don't let any rice stick on the bottom too long. When it smells really good and has a nice golden color to it, its time to eat! Get ready to serve it up with your main dish and prepare to hear plenty of ohhs and ahhs."

Tip: I actually rinse my aluminum foil with all the browned bits (called fond in cooking terms) in a large bowl with my water to get all the amazing flavor this brown stuff provides and use that water in the stock. You don't have to do this, but it will make your stock all the richer!",

You can tell if the shrimp and scallops are fresh by making sure that they have a nice aroma that is not overpowering. Mussels and clams are fresh if their shells are closed. Once you cook them, they will open up. This paella dish reheats well. If you make it the night before, put it in the oven at 350-400 degrees F for approximately 30-40 minutes covered (to keep the dish moist, add either more chicken stock or clam juice before putting it in the oven)."

      "Avocado Creme -- just a dash of salt if needed, I don't add more than just a pinch, sour cream and avocado. I just mash wish a fork. Honestly guys and gals -- just add to a baggie and squeeze. Save the bowl and fork. Why not. I like to add it to a small bowl when I serve it but for a quick make -- it works just fine.",
      "Take a couple of cups of the cabbage -- right out of the bag. Just hit it with salt and pepper. Nothing more. Like a pinch. It just reduces the juice. Put in a serving bowl and set to the side. Cover with plastic wrap. Nothing more.",
      "The garnish -- open can, drain and put in bowl -- I think we can all handle that. I will never be offended if someone doesn't like them. Black olives to me just work well with mango and avocado and fish, so. I like them as a topping.",
      "Now -- the salsa is made and all the flavors are mixing together. The avocado cream is chilling, And now the fish -- We are all done. Five (5) minutes and taco time.",
      "Fish -- in a large baggie mix the salt, pepper and flour. Then just lightly toss fish fish to coat lightly. Now in a large frying pan non stick I prefer for this, add the oil and heat to medium heat. Just pan saute the fish until lightly brown on each side. It only takes 2 or so minutes per side. Once done -- just remove the fish and drain on a paper towel.",
      "Beans -- just heat up in a measuring cup in the microwave. Nothing more for this -- ok some time a squirt some lime in it if if had some left. not a big deal. Enough big flavors for this dish.",
      "Tortillas -- I wrap my tortillas in foil and just warm up in the oven as I cook the fish. They just take 10 minutes. is all. Nothing much. They can also be heated up on a grill too.",
      "Dinner -- Just serve all the ingredients so everyone can put them together them selves. Taco Bar Style. A bowl of the fresh fish, just broken up, the cabbage, beans, the sauce, olives and the salsa. Now, if you want to add some salsa, tomato based you can. To me NO WAY.",
      "Ok - Tortilla warm, then -- Cabbage chilled, then -- Warm beans, then -- Fish warm, then -- Sauce chilled, then -- Salsa chilled, -- Now -- everyone has the best fish taco around trust me. I have a taco party every year. I make this and also make the traditional and then a chicken one. This is by far the requested one.",
      "If you want cheese, I prefer a provolone or monterey jack, bland, but I don't for this dish.",
      "That taco bar is worthy or any party. If I add the beans to the dish I don't add as a side. but a nice green salad and some rice is such a easy thing to add. This is one of my OH SO INEXPENSIVE MEALS. with summer prices for fruit and Tilapia so cheap. This easily feeds 6-8 and is worth entertaining with.",
      "Remember to make in steps. There are a lot, but nothing is hard."

When that's incorporated, gradually add the remaining 1/2 cup of flour; you will need most of it, but you may not need it all. Stop adding flour as soon as the roux begins to clump up and is on the verge of turning solid; it should remain a very thick, but runny, paste. Continue to cook the roux over medium-low heat, stirring often and monitoring its color, for about an hour. It will darken as it cooks, finally reaching a color like dark mahogany or rich fudge. Don't let the roux get too dark (as dark as black coffee, say), because it can burn.",

Fill a small teacup with hot white rice and invert it into a wide, shallow soup bowl; the rice should sit in a mound in the center of the bowl. Ladle the hot gumbo with chunks of pork and slices of andouille around the rice, garnish with a little chopped scallion, and serve immediately. Keep plating until 12 bowls altogether are served."

Wash 7 quart jars thoroughly with soap and hot water, place them in the canner and apply the lid, creating a sterilizing steam bath for the jars. (Be sure to check the rims of the jars for chips and cracks before going any farther!) If you're not almost ready to fill the jars, then once steam has been achieved, turn the burner off. The heat will keep and steam will be achieved easily again when you're almost ready.",

      "Start the canner steaming again to keep the jars hot. In a large saucepan, get your rings boiling. If there's not room to do all this (with 2 skillets, a saucepan and a huge canner) all at once, then do this in place of one of the skillets, while you're cooking the first set of venison. Once it starts to boil, set it aside with the lid on it. It will be nearly ready when you need it. Then you can reintroduce the other skillet to continue cooking the venison faster.",
      "Cook the venison chunks in those two skillets, applying roughly 1 tsp of salt and pepper to each skillet (I find that one filled skillet equals one filled jar, more or less). I usually only cook them to medium before I start filling jars.",
      "Turn the heat up to at least medium under the canner and remove the lid.",
      "Using a funnel, start with one skillet and fill one jar, while it's still within the hot canner. I use tongs and place them carefully for maximum use of space. When it's about 1-1/2 inches from the top rim, pour the liquid from the skillet into the jar as well. Then I add about 2/3 c onion-pepper mixture, or as much as you can fit and stuff in there to bring the level of food to the 1-inch mark. Do not overfill beyond 1 inch from the top.",
      "Repeat until you've filled all the jars.",
      "If you didn't have room on your stove for the saucepan with the rings, then get that back on the stove when you only have 1 or 2 jars left to fill. The rings will therefore be ready when you're ready to cap the jars.",
      "When the jars are filled, wipe the rims thoroughly with a paper towel. Turn the heat off of the saucepan with the rings. Working quickly, dip one lid into the water, introducing it to its ring just long enough to warm it up. Then grab the ring with your tongs (with the lid nested in it), tip the water out of it and apply it to the jar. I just twist it enough to know that the rings are seated on the grooves properly.",
      "Once all the rings and lids have been applied, I remove each jar from the canner and tighten each ring on each jar. I place a potholder in my left hand, lift the jar with my right, place the bottom of the jar on the potholder. Hold and twist finger-tight. Yes, it's hot. Yes, I usually have to change to another potholder at least once. But I want the food, the jars, the rings and the lids to stay hot and BE hot and sterile when I close up that canner. I've had great success with this technique.",
      "Finally, close up the canner, shut the valve, turn up the heat (it it's not already up to at least medium), and wait for the pressure to reach the appropriate level for your altitude (consult your canning guide, or the internet). Once it has reached this level (about 10 pounds of pressure or more), start your timer for 90 minutes. Turn the heat down, keep monitoring and adjusting.",
      "With the meat that's left, you can add the beef broth and onion/pepper mix, cover and cook for about a half-hour on low heat, while you clean up the kitchen, or prepare a side. Watch the pressure on the canner. This cooked meat may not be as tender as the canned meat, but it's what's for dinner, after all that work!",
      "After 90 minutes, turn the heat off. I usually allow the pressure to stabilize naturally. Release the valve, remove the lid, remove the jars with jar holders. Allow them to sit, undisturbed for about 24 hours or until completely cooled. Label the lids, remove the rings, and store properly. Be sure to consult an official canning guide.",

Peel off the tender outer leaves and choose the 10 largest ones. (Save the remaining cabbage for another use, such as stir-frying.) Trim out the thick rib in the center of each leaf. In a medium saucepan of lightly salted boiling water, cook the rice for 5 minutes. Drain, rinse under cold, running water, and drain again. In a medium skillet, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring often, until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Transfer to a medium bowl, and mix in the parcooked rice, the ground beef, egg, savory, salt and pepper. Place about 1/3 cup of the filling in the center of a cabbage leaf, fold over the sides, and roll up into a cylinder. Place the roll on a plate, seam side down, and repeat with remaining leaves and filling. In a blender, process the tomatoes with their juice, the brown sugar, and lemon juice to a puree. Pour the sauce into a 3 1/2 quart slow cooker, and layer the cabbage rolls in the sauce. Cover and cook until the cabbage rolls are tender, 6-7 hours on low. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the rolls to a serving platter. Pour the sauce into a sauceboat and serve with the cabbage rolls."
