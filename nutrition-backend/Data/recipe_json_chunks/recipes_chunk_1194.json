The cheese gets nice and golden brown and lovely and the cabbage in the meat mixture is just sublime.",
      "3.I have made the meat mixture by making instant rice. 1 cup of uncooked instant rice is far more than 1 cup after you cook it. If you do this, it just makes more of the mixture and after 10 rolls I had enough mixture to set aside and freeze for another glorious Polish day in my household."

Also, Cooking Under Pressure is a nice reference book with a number of modern/gourmet- type recipes such as this one.",
      "For better taste and texture, it's essential to use an Italian short-grain white rice such as Arborio, Carnaroli, or Maratelli. Traditionally the rice is not rinsed before cooking since the water would wash away starches that contribute to the velvety sauce enveloping each grain. The perfect risotto should be slightly soupy and properly chewy, with the rice offering just a pleasant resistance to the bite. For this reason, the pressure is always quick-released and the risotto must be served as soon as it is finished -- Leftover risotto can also be shaped into pancakes and warmed or pan-fried in a little butter, or heated in the microwave.",
