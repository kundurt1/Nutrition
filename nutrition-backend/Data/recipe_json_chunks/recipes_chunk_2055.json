      "I make these and place a roast in a gift bag with two loaves of bread and my husband and I deliver these to his partners the week of Christmas every year.",
      "Its a big hit.",

      "It will be perfect every time.",
      "Now, to calculate your cooking time.",
      "Medium rare is what I recommend: To get this result, cook for 5 minutes per pound.",
      "6 minutes a pound would result in a medium roast.",
      "Example, if the roast weighs 5 pounds and you like beef medium rare, then the oven will be on for 25 minutes because 5 minutes per pound times 5 pounds equals 25 minutes.",
      "Youll then turn the oven off and leave in for another hour and 35 minutes (for a total of 2 hours).",
      "Lets try another.",
      "Say you want it medium and your roast is 3.5 pounds.",
      "So, 3.5 pounds times 6 minutes per pound equals 21 so the oven will be on for 21 minutes then off for the remaining 1 hour and 39 minutes.",
      "I recommend that you set 2 timers.",
      "One for 2 hours and the other for your calculated cooking time.",
      "Just push start on both timers at the same time.",
      "Place the roast on a roasting pan and place the pan uncovered into the pre-heated oven.",
      "Start both timers!",
      "When the timer set to the cooking time expires, turn the oven off but do NOT open the door (not even a crack).",
      "Leave roast in the turned off oven for the remainder of time left on the 2 hour timer.",
      "When the second timer goes off, remove pan from the oven and you are ready to slice it.",
      "Slice it very thin and have on your favorite bread.",
      "If you make it to take somewhere, wrap it in foil after its done and place it in a large Ziplock bag.",
      "The high heat sears the outside, so the inside is very juicy and the juice will leak out of the foil!",
      "So make sure to put it inside of a bag.",
      "This will last refrigerated for several days and is great cold.",
      "I love it on toasted rye bread with mayo and mustard.",

      "I tried both recipes and can verify which they turned out just the way the magazine said they would.",
      "Both were deceptively simple and quick.",
      "The only thing which was time-consuming was which both required 1-2 ours marinating time for the Tofu, however, if you are warned ahead of time, it's easy to make the adjustment timewise.",
      "Both recipes called for o*l, and I used Pam instead or possibly left it out entirely.",
      "Heat oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.",
      "Add in onion and next 8 ingredients (onion through garlic); saute/fry' 3 min or possibly more till onion is tender.",
      "Add in beans; saute/fry' 1 minute.",
      "Combine bean mix, breadcrumbs, cornmeal, cilantro, and lime juice in a large bowl; stir well.",
      "Place 1-2 c. bean mix in a food processor and process till smooth.",
      "Add in pureed bean mix and cheese to remaining bean mix; stir well.",
      "Divide mix into 10 equal portions, shaping into a 3-inch patty.",
      "Wipe skillet clean with paper towels.",
      "Coat skillet with cooking spray and place over medium-high heat till warm.",
      "Add in patties, and cook 3 min or possibly till browned, turning patties carefully after 1 1/2 min.",
      "Repeat procedure with remaining patties.",
      "Serve with salsa.",
      "Yield: 5 servings",
      "(serving size: 2 patties and 2 Tbsp.",

      "Cooks notes:This recipe worked extremely well and was very quick.",
      "I wet my hands with water before forming every patty and had no problem with the",
      "\"dough\" sticking to my hands.",
      "I had to add in some water to the mix as my canned beans had very thick liquid and the \"dough\" was too stiff.",
      "These patties browned extremely well and held together excellently.",
      "In fact, I have a couple in a sandwich bag to eat cool for lunch.",
      "In addition, I'll bet they would be excellent in a hamburger bun, or possibly even baked into a sort of m**tloaf and sliced for sandwiches.",
      "Finally, I froze half of the browned patties and plan on microwaving them like store-bought ones when I'm ready for them."
