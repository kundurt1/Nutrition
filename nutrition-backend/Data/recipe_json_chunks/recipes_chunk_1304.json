      "Set the loin on a cutting board with one of the short, cut ends facing you. With a sharp knife, make a lengthwise horizontal cut, about a third of the way up one of the long sides, like asymmetrically splitting open a hot dog bun. Don't cut all the way through, but nearly-far enough so that you can open up the roast like a book. If you started on the right, the left side will now be twice as thick as the right. At the hinge where they meet, make another horizontal cut midway up the left (thicker) side, so that you can open the roast again, like a magazine gatefold. Sprinkle the pork all over with the salt and pepper and set it aside.",
      "Heat the oven to 425\u00b0F and make the stuffing by mixing all the remaining ingredients together (except the cooking oil). Spread the stuffing over the cut side of the pork loin, then roll it up and back into shape. Using cotton string, bind the roast with six little string belts.",
      "Heat a skillet to high, add the cooking oil, and then carefully lay in the pork roast. Brown the roast on all sides and then put the skillet in the oven. Roast until it is just cooked through, about 20 minutes, then remove it from the pan and let it rest on a platter in a warm place for 10 minutes. Remove the strings, slice, and serve."

In a separate bowl beat eggs and then add oil and combine well with a wooden spoon,pour into almond mixture and add grated orange, lemon and lime zest. Beat everything together until a thick batter. Pour into tin lined with paper. Place cake tin on a sturdy cookie tray or similar (one that doesn't warp when hot) and place on middle shelf of a COLD oven. Set oven temp to 375F / 190 C / gas 5. (Bake setting not convection) or adjust temp accordingly. After 20 mins scrunch up spare baking parchment and run under cold tap to wet. Shake off excess and spread out on top of still slightly runny cake (this will stop top from burning). Then bake for a further 30 - 35 mins. during this second part of cooking make the syrup: put sugar, citrus juices and whole spices together in a pan and warm over low heat until sugar has dissolved, bring to the boil, then reduce heat to simmer for about 7 or 8 mins. It should be a runny syrup. Strain syrup reserving spices. When cake is done (test with skewer, it should come out clean when poked). Let cake cool for 5 mins, leave top baking paper in place and gently turn cake out (upside down) and gently peel off the paper that was in bottom of tin. Poke the cake all over with a wooden skewer/tooth pick and with a dessert spoon, spoon syrup evenly over cake letting it absorb the syrup each time. This may take 1/2 an hour. To serve, I like to arrange the strained whole spices on top of the cake for decoration (not to eat of course). Serve with a little pouring cream or soft icecream."

If you use orzo which takes about 9 minutes you must then drop in the orzo after the carrots are in for 6 minutes so they are done at the same time. About the same for any pasta. Rice takes a bit longer so maybe put it in when the carrots are only 3 minutes cooked.",

      "For Shortbread: Line a 8 inch by 8 inch pan with parchment paper. Preheat oven to 300F degrees. With paddle attachment to standing mixer, beat together the butter, sugar, vanilla extract and almond extract. Once well combined, add in flour. After flour is mixed with the butter and sugar mixture, add in the heavy cream and mix together. Place dough in pan and spread the dough to cover the entire pan and evenly spread around the pan. Bake in oven for about 30 minutes. Allow to cool completely.",
      "For Salted Caramel Sauce: Cook sugar in the heavy saucepan at medium-high heat with candy thermometer. Stir as the sugar begins to melt down to a thick liquid and brown in color as the temperature continues to rise to an amber color. Once the sugar reaches 300-325 degrees, remove from heat. Stir in the butter until completely melted. Stir in the heavy cream. Place the saucepan back on the stove at slow heat and stir in salt. Continue to stir until the mixture is smooth. Continue to cook the sauce down on low heat until desired thickness, 5-10 minutes. Cool down sauce for about one hour and pour 2/3 cup to 3/4 of caramel sauce on the middle of shortbread. Spread the caramel evenly on top of the shortbread, but leave a half-inch perimeter along the edge.",
      "For Chocolate Chip Cookie: Sift together the flour, salt, espresso powder, baking soda and baking powder and set on side. Use a saucepan to brown the butter. Turn the stove heat to medium and allow the butter to crackle and start forming little brown bits. When the butter starts to brown, make sure to remove from heat quickly to avoid burning the butter. Pour the melted butter in the bowl to standing mixer with paddle attachment and add the sugars into the bowl. On medium speed, cream together the butter and sugars. It may take 2-3 minutes for the mixture to come together. Add the egg and egg yolk and mix until well combined. Add vanilla extract and then the heavy cream. Slowly incorporate the flour mixture into the bowl. Stir in chocolate chips and mix well. Use the dough to first line the perimeter of the pan. This way the cookie dough prevents losing too much salted caramel from leaking down the side of the shortbread. Then use the cookie dough to cover the rest of the surface area. I didn't use about 3/4 to 1 cup of cookie dough, so the top layer doesn't get thicker than the shortbread. For the rest of the cookie dough, I rolled them up into balls and made about 6 cookies for myself. Place pan into freezer for at least 30 minutes. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Bake for 13-15 minutes until golden brown. If the cookie dough in the center still appears raw, keep the pan in the oven for another minute. Allow the cookie layer to cool completely.",
      "For Chocolate Brownie: Preheat oven to 350F degrees. In separate bowl, whisk together dry ingredients - flour, cocoa powder, salt and baking powder. In a saucepan, melt the butter or microwave butter until melted. Transfer butter to a mixing bowl to standing mixer with paddle attachment. On low speed, mix in sugar and once fully incorporated, add eggs one at a time until mixed together, and then add in vanilla extract. Once all wet ingredients are mixed together, slowly add in the dry ingredients until just combined. Pour brownie batter over the chocolate chip cookie and spread evenly.",
      "Optional addition, sprinkle chocolate chips over the batter. Bake in oven for approximately 25 minutes and should still be a little gooey. Once ready, let it sit until the cookie bar is completely cool."

Heat oil in a large wide Dutch oven or other heavy pot over medium and cook leeks, stirring occasionally, until softened and browned around edges, 8-10 minutes. Add thyme sprigs, garlic, and bay leaves and cook, stirring occasionally, until fragrant and garlic is slightly softened, about 2 minutes. Add wine, bring to a boil, and simmer until reduced by half, about 5 minutes.",
      "Remove pot from heat and slip duck legs, skin side down, into liquid (depending on size of pan, they may overlap quite a bit-this is okay!). Pour in water to come three-quarters of the way up legs. Cover pot and braise duck legs in oven until submerged in their own fat, 1 1/2-2 hours.",

Turn duck over, increase heat to medium, and cook on other side 2 minutes. Transfer to a cutting board. Wipe out skillet and let cool down, then repeat with remaining 2 breasts.

Stir in butter and enough milk (approx. 2 cups) to the potatoes to get it to the consistency that you like. Season with salt & pepper. I like to add more milk up front, as the potatoes will soak up all the excess moisture as they sit and will stay super creamy. Using an electric hand beater, beat the potatoes on medium for about 10-15 seconds to get out most of the lumps - DO NOT overbeat, or your mash potatoes will get gummy. Set aside.",

If using optional onions, cook them 3-5 minutes in olive oil, then add garlic and cook 1 minute. Add the juice from the canned tomatoes to stop the garlic cooking. Crush tomatoes with your hands or chop well on a cutting board and add to the pan. Add basil, parsley, and 1/4 teaspoon each of the salt and pepper and glass of wine. Bring to a boil, stir thoroughly once, then reduce heat to a low simmer. As the acid from the tomatoes flows to the top, skim it off every 10-15 minutes.

My mom would put one of the empty tomato cans next to the stove to catch the skimmed-off part-something I still do today.",

Add the carrot early enough in the process so it gets completely soft. If you crush the tomatoes with your hands, watch they don't squirt you. Or your clothes. My mom taught me a way to slice garlic so thin it liquefies in the pan: with a razor."
