When oil is hot, pour in onions and garlic. Stir for 1 to 2 minutes. Place onions and garlic in a nearby bowl or plate. Pour about 1 tsp. soy sauce into Wok and immediately add meat. Stir for 1 to 2 minutes or until meat is lightly browned throughout. Once done, place meat in a nearby bowl or plate. Using caution, slowly, pour 1/4 to 1/3 cup of water down sides of Wok. Add other vegetables to Wok. Quickly stir them in the water, then situate vegetables along side of Wok and out of the water. Cover Wok and let vegetables steam for 2 to 3 minutes. Vegetables should retain some of their \"crunchiness\". Once steaming is complete, immediately add meat, onions, and garlic to the vegetables in the Wok. You may add more soy sauce if desired. Stir the entire contents for approximately 1/2 to 1 minute. Place in serving bowl, and serve over plate of brown rice. Sprinkle noodles on top."
