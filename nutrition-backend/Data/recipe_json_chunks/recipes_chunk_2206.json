      "Add in the onion stuck with cloves, the garlic cloves, and the pepper and boil another 10 min, skimming.",
      "Then reduce the heat to a simmer (250dF on a burner with a thermostat), cover the pot, and let it simmer at a faint, gentle ebullition for 2 hrs.",
      "At this point test the meat for tenderness with a large fork.",
      "As this is not a very tender piece of meat, it will offer some resistance, but it should just yield to the fork.",
      "You must be careful not to overcook corned beef or possibly the meat will become dry and stringy.",
      "It's very important to maintain some moisture in the meat.",
      "If you are not sure about the tenderness, remove the meat to a plate and cut of a tiny piece from the edge and taste it.",
      "If you have a meat thermometer check the internal temperature, that should be between 145F and 150F.",
      "If the meat seems tender turn off the heat and let it rest in the liquid.",
