Then, LOWER TEMP of oven to 325 degrees and cook for approximately one more hour OR until temperature taken from probe reads 155 degrees. When done, take roast out and allow to rest for 10-15 minutes loosely covered with foil. Resist the urge to cut into it at least for the first 5 minutes to allow the juices to redistribute. You wont be sorry, because this is one juicy hunk o' meat!",
      "While the roast is cooking at 500 degrees, coat the baby carrots, potatoes and onion with the Kosher salt and olive oil and cook them in the oven with the roast AFTER lowering the temp to 325. When you remove the roast from the oven, crank the heat on the veggies back up to 415 degrees and by the time the juices in the roast have redistributed, your veggies should be crisp-tender and ready to be enjoyed with the roast. Perfecto! I love multi-tasking.",
      "By the way, all ovens are calibrated differently. My cooking times are based, of course, upon my oven.so be sure and check the temp of your roast with an internal thermometer inserted into a fleshy part of the meat (avoid taking temp near bone where temperatures will register higher). If covered properly with foil while standing, the pork roast will raise in temperature to the proper and recommended safe temp for pork. I did have some burned looking juice on the bottom of the pan, but the roast was excellent."

      "Mix oats, hot water, molasses and together, allow to sit and cool a bit (if hot to your wrist, it's too hot). Somewhere between baby bath water and lukewarm is good. Add flour, salt, and yeast. Mix together, place in oiled bowl, flip to coat in oil, cover with lid or plastic wrap. Let sit 1 hour, or until doubled in bulk. Separate into balls. Somewhere between a golf and tennis ball, depending on how big you want the runzas to be, I guess. Let those rest at least 15 minutes.",
      "Preheat oven to 350*. Lightly flour a work surface, and roll a bit of dough out to as thin a circle as you can manage without tearing it. It's ready for filling!",
      "While the water-oat mix is cooling, get started with your filling. First, get the cabbage shredding out of the way. Then dice your onions, sing \"I'm NOT crying!\" Flight of the Conchords style as you go wink ~ This will probably take you as long as the water to cool, if you are doing the shredding by hand. When the bread dough is rising and has about 30 minutes left to rise, start with making the filling.",
      "Saute the onions until translucent (10-12m), and crumble in the \"beef\". I had to use a bread dough scraper to chop it up small enough to really work with, so it didn't stick to the pan. If sticking does occur, add a little more oil. When those are mixed together and heated through, add your cabbage. (I promise it cooks down!).",
      "Stir those around a bit and let flavors meld. When the cabbage is getting lighter in color and is softening, add your seasonings. Let this simmer on a low temp as you work with the bread dough, and let the dough balls rest. Roll out dough ball when it has rested, and fill with 1/3c to 2/3c (1/3 is about right for an 8 or 9\" circle, so more if you made yours bigger) Add additional Worcestershire and soy sauce as needed, filling should be moist but not WET.",
      "To fold the dough around the filling and make it look nice, I flipped one long corner over, flipped the short ones down. Wet the last dough flap with water, flip up and press it inches Wetting it will help it stick and not open up. It should look something like a burrito now. Dust with flour on all sides so it won't stick to your pan and break open. Place, seam side down, on a greased pan and start over. Continue until you run out of dough or you run out of filling."

Dice all the lettuce wrap ingredients into small pieces. Pour sesame oil into a hot skillet and start by cooking the chicken over medium high heat. When chicken turns white, add the onions until they turn translucent. Finally add the mushrooms and water chestnuts. Mix all ingredients together and cook until it turns golden. Once ingredients are almost fully cooked, add the minced garlic and the sauce mixture you made in the beginning. This last part is optional, but really adds a nice texture to the lettuce wraps. You can use a deep fryer or a pan of hot oil to fry off some rice noodles until they puff up. They will cook and burn extremely fast so you need to be careful with this! Take the lettuce cups and add the chicken mixture, top with crispy rice noodles and drizzle as little or as much topping sauce as you would like.",

Add the water, 1 tablespoon at a time, until the pastry comes together to form a ball, about 10 tablespoons. Knead the dough lightly and then form into a disk, wrap in plastic wrap and transfer to the refrigerator to rest for at least 1 hour.",
      "While the dough is resting, make the filling. Heat the remaining ghee in a medium skillet and add 3/4 cup of the onion. Cook until the onion is lightly caramelized, about 6 minutes. Add 1 tablespoon of the ginger, 1 tablespoon of the garlic, 1 of the chiles, coriander, garam masala, cumin seeds, turmeric, and cinnamon and cook until the spices are fragrant, about 2 minutes. Add the meat, 1 1/4 teaspoons of the remaining salt, 1/8 teaspoon of pepper and 1/4 cup hot water, cover and cook, stirring occasionally, until the meat is very tender and the water has been absorbed, about 25 minutes. Add 3 tablespoons of the cilantro and set aside to cool completely.",
      "While the filling is cooking, make the dipping sauce by combining the mint, remaining cilantro, remaining chopped onion, remaining ginger, remaining 1/4 teaspoon garlic, remaining green chiles, remaining 1/4 teaspoon of salt, sugar, lemon juice, and 3 to 4 tablespoons water in the bowl of a processor and process until a fine, smooth puree is formed. (Stop to scrape down the sides of the bowl as necessary.) Set aside, refrigerated, until ready to serve the samosas. (Taste and season with additional salt and sugar, to taste, if necessary.)",
      "Divide the samosa dough into 10 portions and roll each piece of dough into a ball. On a lightly floured surface, use a rolling pin to roll each ball of dough into a circle about 5 inches in diameter (use a small bowl or the rim of a saucer and a sharp paring knife to trim the edges of the dough to form neat circles.) Cut each circle in half. Lightly moisten half of the straight edge of each half circle then bring the edges together to form a cone shape and press together to seal. Carefully spoon about 2 heaping tablespoons of the filling into the dough cone and push downward to compress the filling. Moisten the top edges with a bit of water and press together to seal. Repeat with the remaining portions of dough and filling.",
      "When you are ready to fry the samosas, heat a deep-fryer or a large saucepan filled with at least 2 inches of oil to about 340\u00b0F Fry the samosas, a few at a time and stirring to promote even cooking, until golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes. (Note: these will float to the surface of the oil long before they are ready to be removed - make certain to cook them until the pastry is crispy and golden brown.) Remove using a slotted spoon and transfer to a paper-lined plate to drain. Repeat until all samosas have been fried. Serve immediately, with the fresh mint dipping sauce and/or your favorite chutney."
