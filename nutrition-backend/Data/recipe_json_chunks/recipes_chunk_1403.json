      "First, toast the nuts and rub them in a towel to get rid of the skins. You can add the nuts to an oven preheated to 390F? (200C?), arrange them in one layer and check them often, until fragrant and golden.",
      "If using a blender:\r\nJust add all the ingredients but the oil to a food processor, and blitz to chop everything up. The garlic is a little too strong for the delicate pistachio flavor, and that is why many recipes do not include it. I suggest you only add it if you are a fan of garlic.\r\nAs for the herbs, add them a little at a time and check if you're satisfied with the results. Start with a small bunch, and build up the pesto to your liking.\r\n Add the oil a little at a time, until you get to a rough pesto consistency, until everything gets creamy. You might need more or less oil. Check for salt.",
      "If using a mortar and pestle:\r\nI you're using the garlic, pound it first with a pinch of salt. If not, add the herbs at this point (if using any - see step above), and salt, and start pouning in a circular motion to release the essential oils in the herbs. Then add the nuts and cheese, followed by the oil, which you should add a little at a time. Once everything is nice and creamy, stop adding the oil - You might not need it all, or you might need more.",
      "The pesto will keep well in the fridge for quite a while. To store properly, make sure it is completely covered in oil. To extend its shelf life even further, only add the cheese the moment you are planning to use it. This way it will probably keep for about 3 months.",
      "POSSIBLE USES:\r\n- Dress pasta, of course! This is enough for about 6 people.\r\n- Use as a pizza or baked flat bread topping,\r\n- Use as a sandwich, bruschetta or wrap spread, \r\n- Add to dressings,\r\n- Add to soups, frittatas, or any food, really. It is delicious with everthing."

      "Pulse together the flour, sugar, and salt in food processor about five times until combined. Add the chilled butter cubes and continue to pulse in one-second intervals until combined with the dough in pea-sized crumbs. Then add the egg mixture and continue to pulse until just combined. If the dough looks a bit loose in the bowl but easily comes together when squeezed in your hand, it's ready.",
      "Gather the dough into a disk, wrap in plastic, and chill for at least an hour in the refrigerator. You can also store it for a few days in the fridge until you're ready.",
      "When ready to par-bake the crust, preheat the oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit. Remove the dough from the fridge and let it slightly soften for about 10-20 minutes depending on the temperature of your kitchen. The dough should still be cold and JUST soft enough to roll out when applying firm pressure.",
      "Dust some flour on a work surface and your rolling pin, then roll out the dough to until it's 1/4 inch thick (it should be at least 12 inches in diameter). Working quickly yet gently, fold the dough circle in half, then again in quarters and set it into a 9 inch, ungreased tart pan so that the point of the dough wedge is in the center of the pan. Gently unfold the dough package so that it covers the entire pan, and press together any cracks that may have formed. Without stretching the dough, carefully press it into the corners and fluted edges of the tart pan allowing the excess to hang over the edge. If any holes or cracks appear, you can press them together or fill them in with some of the excess dough. Be sure to apply even pressure to the dough, otherwise the thickness may vary inside the pan.",
      "Place the pan in the freezer for 20 minutes to chill before baking. As with pies and some cookies, the fat must be cold when it enters the oven. Once chilled, dock the crust all over using a fork or toothpick. Then gently place a large sheet of aluminum foil or parchment paper over it, and fill the covered pan with pie weights or dried beans in order to weigh the crust down while baking. Otherwise, it will puff up too much.",
      "Transfer the pan to a cookie sheet and par-bake on the center oven rack for about 15 minutes, until the edge of the parchment/foil can be lifted without pulling up any of the crust with it. Don't try to remove the parchment/foil beforehand - it could tear your crust! Remove the pan from the oven and gently remove the parchment/foil and weights. The center of the crust will still look undercooked and glossy. Return the pan to the oven and continue to bake for an additional 10 minutes or so, until the surface just begins to dry out but before the crust takes on too much color. Remember, you'll be baking the crust once more with filling added, so it shouldn't already have turned golden brown.",
      "Set the crust (in the pan) on a wire rack to cool. It will likely have puffed up a little after you removed the pie weights, but it should deflate as it cools.",
      "You can par bake the crust up to one day in advance. If you leave it out overnight, just lay some plastic wrap on top to protect it (only once it has fully cooled).",
      "Preheat the oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit. On an parchment or foil-lined baking sheet, drizzle the strawberries and tomatoes with honey and toss to coat. Roast for 40 minutes or so, stirring occasionally, until the fruits have caramelized and broken down into a thick, chunky compote. Set aside to cool in a bowl.\r\nThis can be made the day before if stored overnight in the fridge.",
      "Reduce the oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit.",
      "Using a food processor, process together the almond meal, sugar, and salt on low speed until combined. And the butter, and continue to process until combined. Add the eggs and process until combined. Repeat with the almond paste and extract, 1 tsp of the elderflower syrup, and finally the flour, processing until just combined. If you're not squeamish about raw eggs, taste the mixture and decide whether or not it needs the additional 1/2 teaspoon of elderflower syrup (to each his own). If so, add and pulse until combined. Then, pour the mixture into a bowl and set aside.\r\nThis can be made the day before if stored overnight in the fridge.",
      "In a small bowl, microwave the apricot jam for a few seconds until the consistency has thinned, then brush half of the mixture over the base of the cooled tart shell. Use just enough to cover the crust so that the jam provides a seal between the crust and the wet compote.",
      "Using a spatula, spread the room temperature strawberry-tomato compote over the crust in an even layer. Then cover the compote with the room temperature frangipane mixture, adding just enough to fill the shell. There may be a little left over - that's okay. Just don't overfill the shell, and remember that the filling will puff up a bit while baking.",
      "Optional - Gently press the sliced strawberries into the frangipane mixture forming a ring and allowing them to overlap slightly. This isn't necessary, but it adds a bright pop of color to the finished tart.",
      "Place the tart pan on top of a cookie sheet and bake on your oven's center rack until the crust is golden brown and the frangipane is puffed and golden, about 40 minutes. Since the crust was par-baked, the edges may start to brown too soon. If this happens, remove the pan from the oven and cover the edges with a crust protector (like a silicone ring) or aluminum foil. Then return to the oven and continue to bake until the frangipane is golden.",
      "Place the tart (still in the pan) on a wire rack to cool. Meanwhile, add the water to the remaining apricot jam and microwave for a few seconds until thinned. Stir and gently brush onto the top of the warm tart. Optional: sprinkle with the coarse sugar for added texture.",
      "Allow the tart to cool completely before removing it from the pan. To remove, gently place the pan on top of a narrower object (e.g. a large can of tomatoes or a cereal bowl). Allow the pan's outer ring to fall away from the base, then bring your serving plate or cake stand close. Using a cake lifter or a large, thin spatula, lift the tart from the metal base and carefully slide it onto the cake stand or plate. But if it looks like the tart has stuck to the metal base of the tart pan, just leave it! If you try to pry it off, the tart will likely break apart. If you do leave the metal base underneath the tart, just be careful when slicing it so as not to scratch the pan.\r\nEnjoy!"

Place the dough in a warm place and let it rise until it about doubles in bulk The rising time will vary considerably depending on the season. (In the summer, it might take just 20 minutes; in winter, it can take an hour or more.) When the dough is ready, it should be room temperature, spread out on the sheet, and fluffy feeling.",

      "Blanch the meat: Pour a few quarts of cold water -- enough to cover the short ribs -- into a deep 6- to 10-quart stockpot. Set over high heat. When the water is warm to the touch, add the short ribs, a teaspoon or so of salt, and bring to a simmer. Simmer for 2 minutes. Drain, rinse the meat in cold water, and wash out the pot.",
      "Assemble and simmer the pot-au-feu: Replace the short ribs in the clean pot and add enough stock so that the meat rises about an inch above the surface. Add cold water to cover by a few inches, bring to a simmer, and skim any last bits of foam that pop up. Taste for seasoning. Add the onions, bay leaves, cloves, peppercorns, star anise, and the thyme, and stir. Cook uncovered at a gentle but very steady simmer, skimming occasionally, for about 1 hour. Skim, then add the carrots, leeks, turnips, and potatoes. Add more stock or water as needed, so everything stays covered. Stir once. Bring to a simmer then taste for seasoning. Simmer until the meat is yielding but not soft, about another hour. The vegetables should be just tender (if they're done before the meat, pull them out so they don't get too waterlogged). Let everything cool in the broth, and refrigerate overnight.",
      "The next day, skim the fat from the top of the broth, then gently reheat the broth with the meat and vegetables. Transfer the meat and vegetables to a shallower pot (with a few ladlefuls of the broth to keep everything moist) and keep warm over gentle heat. Taste the broth and adjust seasoning as needed.",

      "To serve: For the first course, ladle the broth into bowls and serve. For the main course, lift the meat from the pot and slide off the bones. Thickly slice across the grain. Arrange on individual deep plates, surrounding with the vegetables, whole, chunked, or wedged. Skim the rich broth and serve a splash of it with each plate. Serve vinaigrette alongside."

      "Note: The quality of ingredients used is very important for the outcome of any recipe. With regards to pasta in particular, I would suggest artisanal pasta such as Faella or Martelli versus a more industrial brand. In fact, artisanal pasta has rough and porous texture which sauces can cling to better, and it usually \"mantiene bene la cottura\" (keeps its \"al dente\" texture longer). If you can't find artisanal pasta, then I would recommend buying commercially available durum wheat semolina pasta - rigorously made in Italy, though! Saffron threads versus saffron powder: Saffron exists in two forms: threads and powder. The threads are the whole stigma while the powder consists of ground stigma. The threads are tastier and more genuine while the saffron powder loses its flavor rapidly and is very easy to contaminate with other, less-expensive powders of similar color such as turmeric. If you prefer to use the powder, you have to trust the brand you are buying. In case you are using threads, soak the saffron threads for 15 minutes in 5 teaspoons of liquid (hot -not boiling- water, broth or your cooking liquid) for every teaspoon of saffron. Then add the solution to the your dish. Generally speaking 1/2 teaspoon of saffron threads = 1/4 teaspoon of saffron powder, so as a rule use one half the amount of powder as you would threads"

      "In a small bowl, whisk together cream and water. Set aside. Cut cold butter into approximately 1/2-inch by 1/2-inch cubes. Place in fridge until you need them.",
      "In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt. Cut the butter in with two knives, a pastry cutter, or your fingers. I prefer to use my fingers because it's very satisfying and easier to be more precise. Keep squeezing the flour and butter between your fingers as if you're trying to snap. Wipe off any buildup on your fingers. This takes a few minutes. It's done when it resembles coarse cornmeal with a scattering of pea-sized chunks of butter.",
      "Pour in cream and water mixture. Toss with your hands (messy) or a spoon (less messy but not as fun). I found it took about 12 to 15 tosses to incorporate the liquid. Don't overmix. It will not come together into a shiny smooth dough. It will look dry in patches. That's what you want. Scatter a bit of flour over your counter. Scoop biscuit dough on to the counter and press into 8-inch x 12-inch rectangle that's 1 inch tall. Cut with a knife or pizza cutter into 8 equal rectangles (feel free to do 16 small ones instead; just know they will cook faster). Carefully slide them on to the sheet pans. Make sure to leave about 2 inches in between them because they expand a bit.",
      "For the egg wash, whisk together egg and heaven cream. Paint the tops of each biscuit with this mixture. Generously sprinkle turbinado sugar all over the egg washed tops (about 1 teaspoon per biscuit). Sometimes I add a lot because I'm craving that sugary crunch. Up to you. Place sheet pans into the preheated oven.",
      "You can swap the sheet pans halfway through for even cooking. Or you can cook the biscuits one sheet pan at a time. They cook very fast at this high temperature so stay close by. Check them after about 8 minutes, but the full cooking time will probably be between 10 and 12 minutes. They are done when the tops are caramel brown but the inside are still moist and just past doughy. Remove from the oven. They are a bit fragile so it's fine to let them cool on the baking sheet. Sacrifice one of them by cutting it in half, slathering it with butter and honey, and shoving it into your mouth. Cool completely. Don't assemble until you're ready to eat dessert because the whipped cream and fruit will makes the biscuits soggy if they sit.",
      "About 30 minutes before you're going to eat dessert, place berries in a bowl and toss with sugar, vanilla extract, salt, and lemon juice. Mush a bit with the back of the spoon. The juices will start to release. Set aside. Stir once or twice over the next 30 minutes.",
      "When you're ready for dessert, in a large mixing bowl, combine heavy cream, vanilla, and sugar. I whip the cream by hand because you have more control and, as I tell my daughter, every time you whisk your arm muscles get stronger. Whisk vigorously until it starts to thicken, using large circular scooping motions to incorporate air. Be careful. It can flip into butter in a flash. I whisk until it's the thickness of a pourable milkshake. I like it loose but it's up to you.",
      "Using a serrated knife, carefully cut the biscuits in half (like you would a sandwich roll). One might fall apart. Don't stress. You can artfully stack the pieces back together. Place a heaping spoonful of whipped cream on each bottom half. Top with a generous spoonful of the macerated berries. Drizzle over a bit of the extra berry juice. Place the crunchy sugary hats back on. Eat right away. Serve with extra berries and cream on the side."

Clip a candy thermometer onto the pot. Without stirring, bring the syrup to a boil and let it cook gently until the temperature reaches 240\u00b0F. Meanwhile, place the egg whites and cream of tartar in a clean bowl of a stand mixer. With the whisk attachment, begin whisking the egg whites when the syrup just begin to bubble on the stove. Start whisking on medium low until the whites begin to foam all over, then increase speed to medium high. Whisk until medium stiff peaks form and stop the mixer.",
      "Once the syrup has reached 115\u00b0C/240\u00b0F (soft ball stage) and the whites have been whipped to soft peaks, restart the mixer and gradually pour the syrup in a small stream into the egg whites, whisking on medium high continuously. Be careful not to allow the sugar syrup to fall on the beaters. Continue whisking until the bowl of the mixer is at body temperature and not warm to the touch anymore. (This took me a good 15 minutes.) Meringue keeps well in a sealed piping bag at room temperature for at least a few hours.",
      "Assemble the tarts: If you have the time flexibility, do this as close to serving as possible. This keeps everything fresh and the tart pastry shells crispy. Line each tart shell with about 8 pieces of raspberry halves, if using. Spoon over lime curd to fill the tarts. Fill the meringue into a piping bag attached with the nozzle of your choice. Pipe meringue over the tarts to cover partially or completely. Brown the meringue with a blow torch (if you're using the broiler, cover the tarts completely to avoid toasting the filling). If covering partially (like I did), sprinkle the uncovered half of the tarts with lime zest and top with small sprigs of red currants or any other garnish(es) of your choice.",
      "Do ahead: While the recipe reads pretty long, two of the components can be made ahead. I used leftover lime curd from about a week ago. Just bring it to room temperature from the fridge and give it a good stir (folding in method) with a spatula to soften and smoothen. The tart shells were made the day before. Only the meringue has to be prepared the day of, which really it possible for me to show up calm and collected for that fantastic dinner."

Just rinse it and then it's good to go.) The coconut cream will have settled at the top so whisk the mixture until it is smooth. Process the mixture in your ice cream maker according to the directions that came with it. During the last few minutes of churning, sprinkle in about 2/3 of the crumble. When the ice cream is ready (it will be very soft like soft serve), get out the container you will keep it in. I tend to use my smaller ovenex loaf pan as it's easy to scoop from, but any relatively flat vessel will work. Working quickly, spread roughly 1/3 of the ice cream mixture on the bottom of your container, then dollop a few spoonfuls of the fruit swirl on it and drag your spoon around so that the fruit swirls into the ice cream. Continue this process with the rest of the ice cream. When finished, sprinkle the remaining crumble on top. Cover and freeze at least 4 hours to allow it to firm up. At this point you can enjoy it anytime! I find it's easiest to let it soften 10-15 minutes at room temperature before scooping. Makes roughly 1 quart of ice cream with a bit of leftover fruit swirl."

      "Next, add butter on top of dry mixture and work the butter into the flour by using your fingers or a pastry blender, so the dough forms pea-sized crumbs. Add the cider vinegar and the ice water to the center of your mixture. Working from the sides, gather the dough to center so it forms a ball. Transfer the dough to a piece of plastic wrap, shape and flatten it slightly into a disc, wrap tightly, and refrigerate for at least an hour.",
      "Get out a rolling pin and lay out a piece of parchment paper or plastic wrap. Sprinkle it with flour, lay the dough disc on top, and sprinkle it with flour very lightly. Place plastic or parchment on top of the dough, if desired, and roll it into a rectangle.\r\nNow, fold the dough like a letter, putting the left side in and then the right on top of it. Wrap again and chill for 15 minutes.",
      "Roll the dough out again into a rectangle, rotate clockwise, and fold like a letter again. (You are creating layers.) Do this whole process twice more (it will be four times total), then roll into a rectangle again.\r\nWrap in plastic and refrigerate again for at least an hour and up to three days, or freeze the dough for a few weeks and thaw in fridge for a day.",
      "When you're ready to bake, remove the dough and roll it out between parchment, flouring if needed, making a rustic rectangular circle (I don't obsess!). Roll gently, with strokes from the center, so that your rectangle is about 12 inches long or 1/8-inch thick. Carefully transfer the rolled pastry to a baking sheet and place it in the fridge to chill.",
      "Make the filling: In a bowl, mix the cornstarch, lemon juice, zest, sugar, and vanilla, then toss the fruit in, mixing gently to coat. Let it sit for a few minutes. Take the sheet pan from the fridge and using a slotted spoon, mound the berries into the center of the dough, leaving a 2-inch border. Leave the juices in the bowl. Fold up the edges of the pastry and place the pie pan in the freezer. \r\nPour the juices into a saucepan and heat for a few minutes, just so that they reduce and are slightly thick.",
      "Bake the galette: Heat the oven to 400\u00b0 F.

Bake, rotating the sheet pan halfway through, for 45 to 60 minutes, until the pastry is golden and the fruit juices are bubbling. Allow to cool on a wire rack for at least 20 minutes before slicing.",
      "**Note: You can also divide the rectangle of dough in half before rolling it out, and split the filling in half, to create two smaller tarts. In that case, bake them 30 to 40 minutes, rotating the trays halfway."

      "NOTES: Let's talk yogurt for a little bit. It's important to use a sharp and tangy yogurt for this recipe for the \"sourdough\" effect, but how do we control that? I'm not, by any means, a yogurt or live culture specialist. But I do know the \"older\" a live yogurt is (meaning the longer it cultivates at room-temperature), the more tart it tastes and thicker in consistency. If you already make your own yogurt at home, you'd have no problem controlling the desired tartness and thickness of the yogurt. But if you're using store-bought like I do, choose a plain, unsweetened yogurt that contains pro-biotic/active live culture, with a nice tang to it. If you find your store-bought yogurt not tangy enough, let it sit in your fridge for a few days as the bacterias will continue to grow, and makes the yogurt more tart and thick.",
      "In a stand-mixer with dough-hook, or in a large bowl by hands, mix bread flour, instant dry yeast, salt and plain yogurt on medium-low speed for 2 min until a dough forms. If the dough is too dry and has difficulty coming together, add 1 tbsp more plain yogurt. If you'd like, continue to knead the dough on medium-low speed, or with your hands, for a few more minutes until springy. The dough should be very sticky, but able to retain shapes.",
      "Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let ferment at room-temperature for 18 hours (NO MORE than 20 hours or the yogurt may spoil and become bitter!), or 6 hours depending on your schedule (note that the amount of yeast varies). The dough should almost doubled when finished.",
      "After fermentation, dust the counter with flour then transfer the dough on top. Use just enough flour to prevent the dough from sticking, fold the dough gently (without crushing all the air bubbles inside) over itself like folding a letter. Turn 90 degrees and fold again. Then shape the dough into a ball-shape. Transfer to a piece of floured parchment paper, then cover a large bowl on top and let proof again for 1 ~ 2 hours. The dough is ready when it almost double in size again, and should not spring back when you press it with a finger.",
      "45 minutes before the dough's ready, preheat the oven on 450F/225C with a large dutch oven, or a heavy-bottom pot (both should come with lid) inside. To bake the bread, lift the parchment paper to transfer the dough into the preheated pot, cover the lid and bake for 30 min. Then remove the lid, and bake until the crust is golden browned.\r\nLet cool on a rack for 20 min."

      "To a small nonstick saute pan (5- to 6-inch), add the oil and bring up to medium heat. Season the chicken with salt, and once the oil is barely shimmering, add the chicken, stirring to coat with oil, cooking almost all the way through, about 2 to 3 minutes. Try not to brown the chicken at all so your meat stays tender. Add the carrots and onions and cook the mixture for 1 minute more.",
      "Add the rice, stirring to evenly disperse all of the ingredients. Make a well in the middle of the pan, clearing away the rice mixture so there's a hole and you can see the bottom of the pan. Add the ketchup to the center and let cook undisturbed for about 20 to 30 seconds, or until it stops bubbling. Mix the reduced ketchup into the rice. Remove the pan from the heat and add black pepper and salt to taste.",
      "Fresh ketchup rice tastes best, but it will keep for a few days, and reheats well too. If you're going to eat right away, I suggest plating the rice while it's still warm and then making the omelet. Pile the rice on a plate, and with a rubber spatula, form an omelet-shaped ovular mound about 1-inch high. Tip: Cover the rice with saran wrap and mold it using your hands (it's easier, and cleaner).",
      "Wipe out the saute pan with a paper towel (you'll use it for the omelet too).",
      "For the omelet: Crack eggs into a small bowl, adding milk and salt, and whisk together until well combined.",
      "To the nonstick pan, over medium-high heat, add the butter and let melt until it starts to bubble, swirling the pan to coat all the way to the edges. Working quickly, add the eggs, and stir them in the pan with wooden saibashi (Japanese cooking chopsticks) to form long curds, pulling the more cooked egg from the edges into the center, while still scrambling the eggs in the center of the pan as well. If you don't have saibashi, a small wooden spatula works in a pinch.",
      "When the eggs are just about half way cooked, or after about 60 to 90 seconds, there will be a nest of nearly cooked eggs on the bottom, with a combination of large curds and undercooked eggs on top. While the egg on the bottom of the pan starts to set, turn off the burner, and let the pan sit for about 1 minute. This will firm up the bottom and edges, enabling you to loosen and fold the egg omelet. (I'll warn you, this may take a few attempts-I went through a full dozen eggs in an effort to get this right.)",
      "Next, you're going to attempt to fold the omelet onto itself, sealing an edge while keeping a portion of the half-cooked eggs inside. Working toward the furthest edge of the pan, tilt the pan at a 30-degree angle away from you, and from the side closest to the handle, slowly fold up the edges of the omelet toward the center, by quarters, if not thirds, eventually working your way all the way to the outer edge. You can also slide the omelet onto itself about 3/4 of the way, and then knock the handle of the pan lightly with the heel of your wrist on your non-dominant hand. This will cause the omelet to jump a little, while sliding onto itself. I suggest watching a few videos on this technique before giving it a go. Finally, you'll have a rolled omelet curled up at the furthest edge of your pan. You'll need a little more heat to really seal that edge, so put only that far edge of the pan over medium-high heat for a few seconds.",
      "Plate immediately. To do so, you're going to invert the omelet on top of the rice mound. Sounds harder than it is, but what you'll do is reverse your hand position on the pan, taking an under-hand grip on handle with your thumb now furthest away from the pan, so you can more easily slide the omelet onto the plate. Gently slide, almost flipping the omelet on top of the rice, guiding it with the saibashi, so it doesn't fall off the rice mound, making sure it's stable before you take the pan away. Once you have it balanced on top of the rice, bring it to the table, and with a sharp knife, using only the tip, slice the omelet from end to end, lengthwise, unfurling the omelet as if it were a flower blooming.",

Pour melting coconut milk int a 3 qt sauce pan--it should still have soft solids in it. Whisk until mostly smooth.",

Keep scraping the filling off the bottom of the pan, lifting and stirring and continuously blending. The custard will thicken slowly. This may take as long as 10 or more minutes. Do not be tempted to increase the temperature beyond medium-low. This will cook it too fast and it will burn.

This gets it out of the hot pot. It will cool faster. But take the time over then next 5-10 minutes to keep stirring, even if you have poured it into another vessel. The more steam that is released while cooling, the more velvety the texture of the custard. ( Stop here if you want a nice rich pudding--put in individual ramekins and garnish as desired. Saves a few calories and effort as well.)",
      "When almost completely cool, poor into cold pastry shell. Cover closely with plastic wrap laying across custard surface and cool for at least 2 hours up to overnight.",

Or Whipped cream or whipped coconut cream and chocolate curls if you have made a chocolate pie. Or how about Mulberries, if you have used mulberry syrup as your complement liquid? So many options."

Tease out any seeds you encounter as you go, and don't worry if some of the sections break. Squeeze the remaining juice from the grapefruit \"carcasses\" into the bowl.",
      "Warm the butter in a 4-quart saucepan or another medium pot over medium-low heat. Add the onions and a few pinches of salt. Cook, stirring regularly, until the onions are tender and translucent, about 6 minutes. Add the rice and stir until the grains are warm and coated with fat. Add about 2 cups of the stock, adjusting the heat to maintain a gentle simmer, then stir as needed until it has been mostly absorbed. Add another cup of stock and repeat. The risotto should look like a shiny porridge of pearls. Taste: The rice will still be hard and a little raw tasting. Correct the satiny liquid for salt. Add another 1/2 cup or so of stock and stir as needed until just absorbed. Taste again, checking flavor and doneness.",
      "Break the citrus sections into irregular pieces as you add them, and the grapefruit juice, to the risotto. Continue to cook as described above. Taste again. If the rice is still quite firm, add more stock about a tablespoon at a time and cook until it is al dente, with a little firmness still in the center. If your grapefruit was very juicy, you may use little of the remaining stock. Turn off the heat and, with a little vigor, stir in the mascarpone. The citrus will be reduced to pretty flecks in the creamy rice. Serve promptly."

      "Roasted pepper and tomato sauce\r\nStart by preparing your roasted bell pepper salad and, once you have it, pour about 1 cup in a cooking pot together with the tomato paste or pasatta. Bring it to a boil and let it simmer for about 5 minutes while you add the sugar to the mix. After 5 minutes, make it into a fine puree with a blender and leave it to simmer at a low heat for another 15 minutes, or until it acquires a thick consistency. Set it aside.",
      "Caramelised onions\r\nPeel and julienne all the onions\r\n\r\nToss them into a cooking pot with a bit of oil at a medium heat and let them start cooking for 2 or 3 minutes.\r\n\r\nAdd the salt and let the onions release their water and start reducing. Now you can lower the heat to medium-low.\r\n\r\nThere's really no trick here. If you don't use sugar, let them reduce, stirring them every minute or so, for around 30 minutes or until they have a dark, caramel-like color. If you want to use sugar, them add it after 20 minutes and move constantly in order to avoid the sugar caramelising.\r\nOnce the onions have the desired color, add the balsamic vinegar and crank up the heat to maximum, moving constantly for about 3 or 4 minutes. Reserve.",
      "Blood sausage pudding\r\nRemove the casings from the sausages and let them warm up a bit at room temperature.\r\nIn the meantime, toast the pine nuts in a hot pan with drop of olive oil and reserve them.\r\n\r\nOnce the sausages are at room temperature, toss them on a skillet and heat up the oil to a medium heat. Move them constantly. The fat they have -although blood sausages actually don't have much fat compared to other sausages-, will start melting and it will enable for the paste-like texture to form and at the same time, the meat will start acquiring a darker color that it's just beautiful.\r\n\r\nAdd the thyme and keep mixing the sausage together until the fat is rendered and they have the right consistency, about 5 minutes.",
      "Building our delicious tapa\r\nToast some bread in the oven or toaster. Don't make them too dark or hard, as we want to be able to bite the tapa without the bread crumbling.\r\n\r\nSpread some of the pepper-tomato sauce over the bread. Just a little bit, because we don't want the bread to get soggy.\r\n\r\nAdd a couple of spoonfuls of the blood sausage pudding and flatten it over the bread.\r\n\r\nAdd a couple of spoonfuls of the pepper-tomato sauce.\r\n\r\nAdd some of the caramelised onion, about 2 tsp, over the sauce.\r\n\r\nFor a garnish and decoration, add some of the thyme leaves and some flakes of sea salt or Maldon on top of the tapa and, there you go!"

If you are good with timing in the kitchen (a function I completely lack), then you can go ahead to preparing the sauce while cooking the pasta. I, on the other hand, refrain from cooking the pasta until I feel I am confident to combine the components of this dish without overcooking my pasta or undercooking the sauce. Just remember to cook the pasta 1 to 2 minutes less than the instructions because it will continue to cook when you are tossing it in the sauce -- and I hate pasta that is not al dente, don't you?",
      "While water boiling (or pasta is cooking), in a pan over medium heat, melt butter with olive oil and anchovy oil.",

In my head, I revert to iconic scene of the movie \"Goodfellas\" where Pauli slices the garlic using a razor blade and the garlic just melts in the sauce. That is what I aim for when I do this. I want the garlic to melt. -- but minced garlic will do just fine.",

If your pasta still is nowhere near done, then do what I do and take the pan off the heat until you think pasta is almost done. If you are a professional at the whole kitchen-timing thing and the stars in universe are aligned, then by all means, take the pasta and toss it in the sauce while the sauce continues to cook down. If you find that the pasta is too dry then add pasta water as needed. For those like me, bring the pan back to the heat once you think your pasta is almost done. Toss pasta in the sauce for 2 to 3 minutes. Salt to taste. The pasta should be perfectly al dente. If more cooking is required, just remember to ladle more pasta water if needed.

Cover pan with either a lid or tightly seal with aluminum foil. Bake for 90 minutes undisturbed.

Remove pan from oven, increase the oven temp to 425 and take off the lid or remove the foil, baste or spoon some of the pan juices on the chicken and put it back in the oven for 20-30 minutes or until skin is golden brown, You can baste one more time before its completely done, not necessary but it is good if you can. You should have an abundance of pan juices which you can make into a gravy or spoon over the chicken as a thin jus.",
      "You want a finished internal temperature of 170-175. Remove from oven,lift the chicken onto serving platter and tent with foil and let rest for 30 minutes so that the juices can re-distribute. You may have to adjust the steaming time depending on the size of your chicken, the 4 lb bird I made was done in 90 minutes with 20 minutes additional to brown the skin. I included the ideal temperatures if you use a thermometer, truth be told I don't use a thermometer with this method and have never had an under or over cooked chicken, using a thermometer will ensure that the chicken is done to the optimal temperature though."

(WARNING: if it doesn't, your yeast is dead! try again. I often have to use bottled water because in some places tap water has enough add-ins to kill yeast)",
      "Stir in olive oil & beaten egg. Add 1/2 Cup of flour and stir then add in the salt and the cinnamon (if you're using it). Continue to add the flour 1/2 Cup at a time until the dough comes together and cleans the side of the bowl as you stir.\r\nAdd in enough flour so that it's not wet to the touch, but it should still be a bit sticky/tacky. \r\n(you'll probably have a little under a cup left, which is fine, and you'll add that in as you knead)\r\nPlace a towel over the bowl and let rest for 15 minutes for the flour to hydrate.",
      "Turn dough onto a floured surface, sprinkle flour on the mass of dough and onto your hands, begin to knead until smooth and elastic --- about 7-10 minutes. As you're kneading, sprinkle more of the remaining flour onto the mass & cutting board if it's really sticky. (I tend to use only about 2 cups out of the 2.5, but I live in a dryer area). The final dough should be tacky, and not sticky -- if you touch it with a dry finger, you shouldn't have dough on your finger when you remove it.",
      "Lightly oil a bowl, place dough mass in bowl. Let rise in a warm place for about 90 minutes (or until it doubles in bulk). I like to place mine in my oven (not turned on) and I put a pot of boiling water next to it for steam and humidity (and warmth).",
      "Turn the dough out onto a VERY lightly floured surface (just a few sprinkles of flour). Punch dough down, let rest for 10 minutes in order to let the gluten relax -- otherwise it's WAY too elastic and hard to get the long pieces you'll need for braiding.",
      "Cut the dough in half, and cut each half in half, leaving you with 4 pieces. Roll out each of the pieces (by hand) until they are about 14\" in length (a little less than elbow to fingertip). Line them up vertically to you and parallel to each other, pinch the top ends together, and tuck that pinch under itself. (I usually do this RIGHT on the baking sheet + silpad (or parchment) on which I'll be baking the loaf - it just allows me to transfer it fewer times)",
      "Braiding: (Don't braid TOO tightly - try to make the tightness as even as possible)\r\nTake the 3 strands on the right, and go through one cycle of a normal (3 strand) braid.\r\nThen take the fourth strand (the one you haven't touched all the way on the left) and tuck it under the strand immediately to its right.\r\nTake the 3 strands on the right, and go through another cycle of a normal braid.\r\nAgain, take the leftmost strand and tuck it under the one just to its right\r\nTo illustrate, Starting with: ABCD \r\nOne Braid: ADBC \r\nTuck A under D: DABC \r\nOne Braid: DCAB \r\nTuck D under C: CDAB\r\nSo the process is: braid the right, and switch the left strand in for the next cycle.\r\nWhen you can't braid anymore, pinch the ends together and tuck the pinched part underneath itself as you did with the top.",
      "Preheat oven to 350. If you haven't done the braid on top of the baking sheet, line a baking sheet with parchment or tinfoil or a silicone mat and sprinkle a little flour down. Transfer the braided loaf to the baking sheet and let it rise for about 50 minutes. (I let it rise on top of the stove, which is now nice and warm due to the oven's being on)",
      "Make the Glaze while the dough is rising:\r\nJust whisk all glaze ingredients together",
      "Right before you put the loaf in the oven brush (generously) with this glaze. If you like poppy seeds, sprinkle the top with poppy seeds after you glaze it. \r\n\r\n(I keep meaning to get one of those $1 travel spray bottles because I think that would work almost better than a brush).",
      "Pop the loaf in the oven, set a timer for 15 minutes. DO NOT OPEN THE OVEN IN THE MEANTIME! After 15 minutes, rotate the baking sheet 180 degrees. Set timer for another 15 minutes. DO NOT OPEN THE OVEN IN THE MEANTIME! Now check the loaf. Bake until the loaf is a light golden brown. I find this takes about 33-35 minutes in a gas oven, but 28-30 in an electric oven.",
      "Let it cool for about 15 minutes before you dig in - this will undoubtedly be the hardest part of this recipe. But trust me, bread tastes better if you wait a few minutes. It keeps REALLY well on the counter for a few days wrapped in tin foil. \r\nIf you want to make french toast out of it (say, 2 or 3 days later), cut a few slices, and leave them out for 12 hours to stale up a bit."

Add remaining ingredients and toss with the oil and vinegar. Super healthy and hard to believe it's all raw. The spiral cut is key to this gorgeous dish."

      "When ready to roast, drizzle each loin with olive oil and sprinkle thyme leaves over them. Roast on the middle rack in the hot oven for 12 minutes until the fish is almost cooked through. Turn on the broiler. Broil for 2 minutes to fully crisp up the pancetta.",

      "Transfer the baking sheet with the pie on it to the oven and bake for 45 minutes to 1 hour, until the edges are puffed and the center jiggles only slightly when shaken. It will continue to set as it cools.",

      "Store leftover pie, well wrapped in plastic wrap or under a pie dome, at room temperature for up to 3 days.",
      "In a large stainless steel bowl, combine the flour, sugar, and salt and stir to mix well. Place the sticks of butter in the bowl and coat on all sides with the flour mixture. Using a bench scraper, cut the butter into 1/2-inch cubes. Work quickly to separate the cubes with your hands until they are all lightly coated in flour. Grab that bench scraper once again and cut each cube in half. I always tell my pie dough students that it's unnecessary to actually cut each cube perfectly in half, but it's a good idea to break up the butter enough so that you can be super-efficient when it's pastry blender time.",
      "It's pastry blender time! Switch to the pastry blender and begin to cut in the butter with one hand while turning the bowl with the other. It's important not to aim for the same spot at the bottom of the bowl with each stroke of the pastry blender, but to actually slice through butter every time to maximize efficiency. When the pastry blender clogs up, carefully clean it out with your fingers (watch out, it bites!) or a butter knife and use your hands to toss the ingredients a bit. Continue to blend and turn until the largest pieces are the size and shape of peas and the rest of the mixture feels and looks freakishly similar to canned Parmesan cheese.",
      "At this point, add the water-vinegar mixture all at once, and switch back to the bench scraper. Scrape as much of the mixture as you can from one side of the bowl to the other, until you can't see visible pools of liquid anymore. Now it's hand time. Scoop up as much of the mixture as you can, and use the tips of your fingers (and a whole lot of pressure) to press it back down onto the rest of the ingredients. Rotate the bowl a quarter-turn and repeat. Scoop, press, and turn. With each fold, your intention is to be quickly forming the mixture into one cohesive mass. Remember to incorporate any dry, floury bits that have congregated at the bottom of the bowl, and once those are completely gone and the dough is formed, it's time to stop.",
      "Remove the dough from the bowl, place it on a lightly floured counter, and use your bench scraper to divide it into two equal pieces. Gently pat each into a 2-inch-thick disc, working quickly to seal any broken edges before wrapping them tightly in a double layer of plastic wrap. If you're portioning for a lattice-topped pie, shape one half into a 2-inch-thick disc and the other half into a 6 by 3-inch rectangle. Refrigerate the dough for at least 2 hours or, ideally, overnight. When you go to roll out the crust, you want the discs to feel as hard and cold as the butter did when you removed it from the fridge to make the dough. This will make the roll-out way easier.",
      "You can keep the pie dough in the fridge for a few days or in the freezer for up to 1 year. If frozen, remove the dough and place it in the refrigerator to thaw one full day before you intend to use it. If you're planning to make only one single-crust pie, wrap the discs separately and place one in the freezer.",
      "NOTE: Icy water, now improved and with tang: While working at Brooklyn's Four & Twenty Blackbirds for a summer, I learned a number of good tricks that considerably changed my pie dough-making experience. Here's one of my favorites: Fill a 1-cup liquid measuring cup with about 1 inch of water and freeze until completely frozen. Just after you mix your dry ingredients, grab it from the freezer and fill with water plus 2 tablespoons or so of apple cider vinegar. The ice-cold water-vinegar mixture should look just like apple juice. Let it chill on your counter while you mix the other ingredients for the dough.",
      "NOTE 2: The addition of vinegar to pie dough was originally thought to tenderize the gluten (thus avoiding a tough crust), but there isn't any good scientific evidence proving that it makes a difference. We keep it in our recipe for its tangy flavor and our respect for tradition.",
      "NOTE 3: Not the pie-baking plan-ahead type? That's okay! When you're ready to make the dough, simply fill a 1-cup liquid measuring cup about halfway with ice, then add water and 2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar."

Take 1 piece of dough (keep the rest of the dough covered with a tea towel or plastic wrap so it doesn't dry out) and roll it out using a pasta machine, working down to the second most narrow setting. The dough should be thin enough so that you can begin to see your hand through it but not too thin that it can't support the ricotta filling.",
      "Working on a floured surface and with strips of pasta about 4 inches (10 centimeters) wide and as long as you like, place 1 level teaspoon of filling onto the pasta sheet no more than 1 inch (2.5 centimeters) apart. Beat the reserved egg white and brush it around the filling. Fold the pasta in half lengthways, and press down gently around each spoonful of filling. Be careful not to trap too much air, as the ravioli can burst when cooking. It helps to work from one side to the other, pushing the air out as you work your way around the filling. With a fluted pastry wheel cutter or a sharp knife, trim the length of the whole sheet of pasta on the open side (not the folded side), then separate each ravioli by trimming evenly so that you have about a 1/3-inch border around the filling. (You can save the trimmed pieces, knead them together, and continue using them; cover when not in use to avoid drying.) Continue until you finish the pasta and filling-or whichever comes first.",
      "Place the finished ravioli on a baking sheet or flat surface lined with parchment paper, and keep them covered with a tea towel while make the others. They will dry out somewhat the longer you leave them, and this is perfectly fine, but if you are leaving them for a significant amount of time, keep them in the fridge. Once you've made all the ravioli, cook in a saucepan of salted, boiling water over a medium heat until al dente, about 5 minutes.",

Also, you could use slivers of smoked salmon in place of the chicken.\r\n\r\nTo make a vegetable caprese millefeuile, grill or fry slices of aubergines or courgettes and then layer. You could also try the traditional tomato and my thoughts are that roasted/pan fried pumpkin slices would be delish!"

If tastes for spicy heat vary in your group, simply omit cayenne & hold hot sauce for addition at the table. \r\n-\tTo make vegetarian, increase the onions & peppers a bit & use a small amount of canned chipotle, instead of meat, for a bit of smoky flavor. I like the bacon/ham sauce a lot. So, if I have vegetarian guests, I split the sauce into two pots one with & one without.",

But, the family seems to enjoy if all the toppings are added to individual taste at the table."

      "In a large bowl, combine the flour, sugar, salt, butter, and eggs with about a quarter of the milk and whisk until smooth. Whisk in the remaining milk and the water. Set the batter aside for at an hour (to let the flour hydrate) or cover and refrigerate for longer (up to 2 days). Stir the batter well before and frequently as you use it, as the heavier ingredients tend to settle to the bottom of the bowl. (Buckwheat flour makes a crepe batter with the slightly unusual \"stretchy\" texture-the best method for coating the crepe pan is to pour a little more batter into the hot pan than you really need, swirl the pan to coat and pour excess batter immediately back into the remaining batter. It sounds wrong, but it works perfectly.)",
      "Set two plates near the stove for the finished crepes. Heat the pan over medium to medium-high heat and brush lightly with butter (a silicon brush is terrific for this). When a drop of water sizzles on the pan, lift the pan off the burner and pour a scant 1/4 cup of batter into the pan, off center at about 2 o'clock. Immediately tilt and rotate the pan counter clockwise, shaking as necessary, to coat the pan entirely (in one pass if possible), and immediately pour excess batter back into the bowl. Set the pan back on the burner and cook the crepe until the surface no longer looks wet and the edges and parts of the underside are browned, 45-60 seconds. Loosen the edges of the crepe with a spatula and flip it over with the spatula or (carefully) with your fingers. Cook 30 to 60 seconds longer. Slide or flip the crepe onto one of the plates. You can trim the edge of the crepe to remove the lip caused by pouring off excess batter at any time-while you are cooking or when the crepe is cooked. As you get the hang of the batter, and how to tilt the pan, you can decrease the amount of batter you pour in the pan and thus the amount of excess.",
      "Repeat, setting the second crepe on the second plate. Crepe can be stacked hot-but they are easier to separate if you let each one cool just long enough to cook the next one. Stack the first two crepes in time to put the next hot one on the empty plate, and so forth. If the crepes seem too thick, adjust the batter with a little extra water. You want thin crepes with lacy edges. Repeat to make the remaining crepes, buttering the pan only as necessary. Make about 25 crepes. Set aside,",
      "Toss the walnuts and cinnamon in a bowl and grate the zest of the orange over them. Toss to mix.",
      "Place one crepe on a plate. Leave a 1/2 inch margin bare around the edges of each crepe as you fill. The filling will melt towards the edges to some extent anyway, and naked edges will be lacy and slightly crisped. Smear a scant tablespoon of goat cheese somewhat evenly over the crepe-a small offset spatula is your best friend here. (If the cheese is not soft enough to spread easily, microwave it on low for a few seconds.) Drizzle the crepe with about 1 1/2 teaspoons of honey. Sprinkle with a heaping tablespoon of the nut mixture. Spread the second crepe with cheese and then set it on top of the first. Drizzle with honey and sprinkle with nuts. Repeat-always spreading cheese on the next crepe before stacking it. In the end, top with a bare crepe. Press down gently on the stack to level the cake. (If you are a superb crepe maker you will have gotten more than 25 crepes from the batter, you can continue to stack and fill them, or wrap and refrigerate or freeze left over crepes for another use).",
      "The cake can be wrapped airtight and refrigerated for a day or two. To serve, set the cake on a baking sheet, brush the top with a little melted butter. Bake in a preheated 350 F oven for 25-30 minutes (assuming the cake was refrigerated-a little less if not) until heated throughly. Transfer to a serving platter. Sieve a little powdered sugar over the top. Serve hot. Cut with serrated knife."

You can use all your saved vegetable ends to make this broth. Do include one fire roasted pepper into this broth as well as one uncooked sweet red pepper for depth of flavor. Give the broth at least an hour to simmer. Strain the broth and save any good pepper bits from which you can make your puree. Have about 4 cups of strained great broth in the end. From this, salvage about 1/2-3/4 cup of cooked red pepper (and a few other choice vegetables with a bit of tomato, carrot and onion)and puree. You can add a few tablespoons of broth into the mix to facilitate the puree if helpful. I used a blender.",

Then add this tempered mix to the soup, whisk in, and continue to simmer for another 5 minutes or so. Add wine and or vodka at this point if desired in the final cooking minutes. If you have stirred continuously this soup should be very smooth. However, if you find a few clumps of the semolina along the way, they just add a bit more texture, not to worry.",
      "To serve this soup, ladle into the dishes. Arrange a cut fire roasted pepper on top with bell pepper threads, if you like. Drizzle EVOO on top. Garnish with fresh herb or capers and paprika.

Your cake is done when a butter knife slides in and out of the middle without leaving any gooey batter on the blade. (Hey! Don't lick that knife- you're going to use it later and you might cut you tongue!) Remove cake from oven and let cool in pans for about 10 minutes. Then remove the cakes from their respective pans and place onto wire racks to cool completely.\r\n\r\nHINT: If your cakes seem to be cooking crookedly, your oven is emitting heat unevenly. If your cake has a pointy little middle (like a Devo hat), the oven temperature is too hot regardless of what it is set at; reduce by 25 degrees. I the edges seem to be cooking faster than the middle; reduce temperature by 25 degrees and move cake to different rack. Most ovens have a \"hot spot\"- avoid it.)",

      "This is not difficult, but it is putzy. So take your time and have fun. There is always the baker's canard of reading recipes all the way through before starting...because here's the part where I tell you that your butter should be room temperature. Which means you should have taken it out of the fridge a few hours ago. If you haven't read through and are swearing- put the butter into a bowl and pop into the microwave for about 10 to 20 seconds. Stir thoroughly. That should give you the \"room temperature\" consistency you need.",
      "Cream the butter with electric mixer or gullible helper. Add 1/2 teaspoon salt. Beat until fully creamed. Add 1/3 cup Heavy Cream and beat until fully creamed. Add in 2 teaspoons of vanilla. Beat again. Add 2 cups of sifted powdered sugar. Beat until completely creamed. (Many professional bakers have Popeye arms- this is why.) Set creamed butter aside.",
      "Into your sauce pan pour you Jack Daniels and heat under medium flame until you can smell a \"peaty\" scent. Add the 1/2 cup of Baker's Sugar. Stir vigorously with whisk. Keep stirring until the sugar is completely dissolved. Really, you need to stand over it and stir. Take it off the heat as soon as it is dissolved into syrup stage. Too much time over the heat and it will burn or caramelize. That's bad. Keep stirring, even as you take it off the heat. You want to aerate the mixture. It's fragile. Keep stirring it until it cools down. When Jack Daniels syrup is cooled to the touch, pour into the butter mixture. Beat some more.

      "The first step in assembly is prepping your cakes. Use the knife to trim the rounded tops of your cakes. Flat surfaces are easier to layer and frost. Scoop out a generous spoonful of frosting into a small bowl. Use this to dip your cake scraps into and snack away; don't tell anyone.)",
      "Your goal is to make the cakes as level as possible. Now take your level cakes and carefully cut them in half. (Not across; but through the circumference.) You can use your knife. An old trick is to take dental floss (unwaxed), circle it around the cake evenly, and then carefully pull the ends. Kind of like a baking garrote- you essential \"strangle\" the cake.",
      "Lay two pieces of parchment on your cake plate, abutted. Put your bottom layer on top of the parchment. (When you're done frosting; carefully pull out the parchment and voila! Perfecto!)",
      "Take your big bowl of frosting and using a large tablespoon and your spatula, lay an even layer of frosting down. Not too thick, not too thin. We'll be building up to 4 or 6 layers- depends on how far your frosting goes and how ambitious you are.",
      "Repeat this build/layering process until you have a tower of cakes.",
      "Butter cream is a heavy frosting. It works best in steps. First we apply a \"crumb coat\". This is the thin coat of frosting that you use to absorb your crumbs and develop a base. Work from the bottom to the top.",
      "Again, working from the bottom. Apply your second coat. This one should be thicker and smoother. This is where we make it pretty. Smooth the sides first, then the top. If you don't have a frosting blade, use a spatula.",
      "Place cake into fridge to \"firm up\" and settle. Serve to astonished friends with high-tea."

      "Combine the gelatin and 1/3 cup cold water in a small bowl and let the gelatin soften for 5 minutes.",
      "Place the sugar, 1/4 cup corn syrup, 1/4 cup water and pinch of salt in a medium saucepan and stir gently. Clip a candy thermometer onto the pan, and place it over medium-high heat. Bring it to a boil, checking it occasionally--you are looking for it to eventually hit a temperature of 235-240 degrees (soft ball stage).",
      "Meanwhile, pour the remaining 1/4 cup corn syrup into the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. Microwave the gelatin on high until it is completely melted, about 30 seconds. Turn the mixer on low, and very slowly pour the melted gelatin into the corn syrup. Keep the mixer running while you check the sugar syrup.",
      "Once the syrup reaches 235-240 degrees, pull it from the heat. Carefully transfer the syrup to a large, heatproof measuring cup or a similar vessel with a spout for easy pouring. Turn the mixer up to medium speed and slowly pour the sugar syrup into the gelatin mixture. When all the syrup has been added, crank the speed up to medium-high and let it go for about 6 to 7 minutes--the candy will turn white and fluffy during this time. Beat in the vanilla. Beat in the bubble gum flavoring, just a couple drops at a time, stopping the mixer to taste the marshmallow, adding more drops until you reach the desired intensity of bubble gum flavor. Beat in the food coloring, drop by drop, until you get the color you're looking for.",
      "Pour the marshmallow into the prepared pan and use an offset spatula spritzed with a bit of cooking spray to nudge it into the corners and smooth the top. Sift confectioners' sugar evenly and generously over the top. Let sit for about 6 hours.",
      "Use a knife to loosen the marshmallow from the edges of the pan and invert it onto a confectioners' sugar-dusted work surface. Dust the marshmallow slab with more confectioners' sugar and cut into whatever size pieces you wish (a pizza cutter works great here for squares). Dip the sticky edges of the marshmallows in more confectioners' sugar, patting off the excess. Store in an airtight container for up to 1 week."

      "Three hours before you plan to heat the oven, Fold the dough again, and set it out to proof in at room temperature for 20 minutes. Flour the bannetons and breadboard generously with the whole-wheat flour. Turn the dough out onto the board, and use a dough scraper to make sure the bottom isn't sticking and the dough is evenly distributed. Sprinkle a line of flour down the middle of the dough, and cut it into two pieces along the line with the scraper. Fold each loaf one more time, sprinkle the seam with flour and gather the seam up into you fist, and round the loaf to make a good skin to hold the dough while it does it's final proof. Put the loaf seam-side down into the banneton. Your skin will eventually become the bottom crust, and the floured-seam crust will crack to provide room for oven expansion. Tent plastic bags over the bread (I use produce bags from the grocery store,) and let them proof at least an hour; if it's cooler, even longer. When the top of the loaves are just beginning to reach the tops of the basket, preheat the oven and two cast-iron 4 or 5 qt. dutch ovens to 450F for an hour.",

Cover, return to the oven, and repeat with the second loaf. Bake for 40 min., remove the covers, lower the temperature to 425F, and bake an additional 20 min. Turn loaves out onto a rack and let cool completely before slicing. Make sure to take time and listen to the sound of the crust cooling and admire the little explosions of flour as the crust crackles."

If this happens remove your chicken to the other side until it subsides.\r\n\r\nCook until skin has good charring (controlled burn) and temperature in the thigh bone reaches 155/160F.

      "EDIT No.1: Feel free to reduce the sugar amount to 1 and 1/2 cups if you want your cookies less sweet. I think they are better the way they are.",
      "EDIT No.2: Since I wrote this recipe, I have tweaked it to make an even better version. Try the original, or make the following adjustments for the \"Suped Up\" version: Substitute light for dark brown sugar. Add 1 tsp \"espresso powder\" or very finely ground coffee to the dry mixture. Cut the rolled oats amount to 1 cup and add another 1 cup of oat bran (if you do not have access to oat bran, add 1 cup of rolled oats in a food processor, and pulse about 10 to 12 times). Overall, the changes will result in a cookie with deeper flavor, chewier texture, and ultimately, better cookie. Hint: They will also pair excellently with coffee.",
      "Preheat your oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Line two baking sheet with parchment paper.",
      "To make the raisin paste: Toss raisins with 1/4 cup of the flour. Grind in a food processor with a blade attachment for 20-30 seconds until the raisins form a very thick paste and come together in a ball. If you don't have a food processor, you can use a blender or meat grinder to form the raisin paste.",
      "Brown the butter in a saute pan, making sure it does not burn. It is better to take the time and stay with the butter, than walk away from the pan. When you begin to see the bottom of the pan becoming browned, remove from heat. \r\n\r\nAdd sugar, vanilla extract, and browned butter to a bowl and mix using a hand mixer or in a stand mixer; on medium speed. If it looks separated, it's okay. Mix for about 5 minutes to incorporate some air into the batter.\r\n\r\nAdd eggs, and continue to mix on a medium speed. At this time the mixture should almost immediately come together. When the mixture appears homogeneous, add raisin paste and mix until thoroughly combined.",
      "In a separate bowl, combine the remaining 1 3/4 cups of flour, oatmeal, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon. Mix the dry ingredients into the wet mixture in 2 additions, until there is no flour visible.",
      "Roll small pieces of dough into balls slightly smaller than a ping pong ball, about 38mm. If using, roll the balls in a dish of sugar, this will make them extra crunchy when baked. Place balls on the lined baking sheet, making sure they are about 2 inches apart. Using a the buttery side of the butter wrapper, flatten each dough ball slightly to allow for even baking.",
      "Bake for 12-15 minutes, until the cookies are crinkly on top and just begin to turn golden brown. Another good way of testing is to lift a corner of the cookie, if it bends slightly and reforms when let go, they are ready. \r\n\r\nAllow to cool for 5 minutes on the baking sheet, before transferring cookies to a cooling rack. Store in a airtight container for up to 1 and a half weeks."

Boil, uncovered, stirring frequently, until the rhubarb has mostly broken down, the raisins are fat, and most of the liquid has absorbed. This can take anywhere from 15 to 30 minutes (or more) depending on heat of your burner and your impatience. If your mixture starts to get dry, add a small amount of water. When the compote is finished, set it aside and make the cake batter.",
      "A note about the rhubarb compote: When I first made this at home, I cut the rhubarb stalks into 1/4- to 1/2-inch chunks and cooked the compote for 15 to 20 minutes, uncovered, so that most of the liquid evaporated. The texture was more jammy than soupy-it was thick and I had to rap the spoon with some force to transfer it onto the cake batter. If your compote looks liquidy but has been cooking forever, put it through a fine mesh strainer to separate any excess liquid.\r\n\r\nAnd if your compote is still very liquidy, you might not want to use all of it on the cake-the excess moisture might make your cake gooey on the inside (which is delicious, but not to everyone's taste). In this case, use half of it.",

I brought 2 heaping cups of water to a boil, then turned off the heat and added my couscous. Secure the lid on top of the pot, and let the grain sit for 8-10 minutes. Lift off the lid-- the water should be dissolved and the couscous ready. Stir in 1-2 tablespoons of good quality olive oil (for flavor, and so the grains won't stick), and salt to taste. You can leave the couscous on the stovetop, covered, until you're ready to serve.",

    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "STEP 1: Combine the flour and the salt in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. If you don't have a stand mixer you can do this by hand, which is the method I used for a long time until I realized how much quicker it is when using the mixer. My favorite tool when I make this by hand is a bench scraper. It's how I keep the dough together and how I cut up the cubes of cold butter.\r\nAdd all the butter to the bowl at once and mix for 30 seconds on low speed. You want the butter to just start to break up and incorporate into the flour. Add the cold water and mix for 15 seconds. \r\nThis mix will not look like much of a dough and you may be cursing me for having got you into this mess but I assure you when you pull the puffed piece of dough out of the oven I will be your best friend.",
      "STEP 2: Roughly shape the crumbly \"dough\" into a rectangle. Fold over the right third of the dough to the center. It will likely fall apart through the first three turns, when it does simply use your hands to press the dough back together. Fold the left two-thirds over the dough and turn 90* so the dough. This was your first turn.",
      "STEP 3: Using the palm of your hands push the dough back to a flattened rectangle and repeat the process two more times for a total of three turns. If at any point you feel the butter getting soft or the dough becomes too tough to work with just place it in the fridge to rest for at least 30 minutes.\r\n\r\nAfter three turns, place in the fridge to rest for at least 30 minutes or up to 1 hour. You can leave the dough at this state overnight if time is an issue, just let rest on the counter for 10 minutes to remove the chill from the butter slightly before starting the turning process again.",
      "STEP 4: Once rested continue with three more turns. After this first rest the water will have hydrated much of the flour and it should resemble a dough. This is when I start to use the rolling pin rather than my hands to work with the dough.\r\n\r\nLet rest again for 30 minutes.\r\n \r\nAt this point your dough is ready to use.\r\n\r\nMost often recipes call for a sheet of puff pastry. Roll out your dough to 1/4 inch thickness and cut to any size that the recipe calls for."

Place one round of dough on a baking sheet and spread the jam evenly over top of it, leaving a 3/4' border around the perimeter of the dough. Place the second round on top and pinch the edges together to seal the jam inside. Brush the scones with a thin layer of cream and sprinkle with coarse sugar, if desired. Bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until the tops and sides are golden brown. Allow to cool slightly before cutting to let the jam set. Cut into 8 equal slices and serve warm.",

Cup a small amount (less than 1/4 cup) of the mixture with your hands. Mixture will feel wet and will loosely hold together. Form into a ball, packing and cupping with your hands. When the oil shimmers, immediately lower the heat to medium and gently place the ball into the pan. Flatten with your hand or spatula to form a patty. Season with a pinch of salt. Let cook undisturbed for 2 to 3 minutes, or until evenly golden. Flip, and brown the other side for another 2 minutes or until evenly golden. Remove patty from pan and let cool briefly. Taste. If necessary, adjust mixture with more salt and pepper to taste. If the patty fell apart in the pan, crack in another egg to the bowl of quinoa/greens and mix to combine. When the mixture is tasting and holding together to your liking, use a 1/4-cup measure to portion out the remaining mixture into balls - you should get 10 to 12.",

Use a spatula to flip the patties and cook for another 2 minutes or until golden. Pile onto a platter and serve with lemon, cilantro, naan, and sauce, if you wish."

      "First make the breadcrumbs. Place pieces of bread on a baking sheet and put baking sheet in a 400 degree oven for about 15 minutes, or until golden and toasty. Let bread cool slightly, then pulse in food processor until large crumbs have formed. Crumbs do not need to be uniform size. A mix of large and small breadcrumbs is fine. Set aside.",

      "Cook the eggs: Bring a small saucepan of water to a boil over medium-low heat. When water is at a simmer, carefully lower two eggs into the pan. Let simmer for eight minutes, then remove eggs from water and rinse with cold water. When eggs have cooled, peel eggs and chop inito small pieces. Set aside.",
      "Cook the asparagus: Heat large skillet over medium heat. Add butter and 3/4 tablespooon olive oil to pan. When butter has melted, add asparagus to pan. Cook asparagus for about five minutes or so or until tender, turning occasionally with tongs. Remove from pan and put on serving plate.",
      "Finishing the dish: Add 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons olive oil and green garlic to small skillet. Gently heat oil over low heat. When garlic starts to bubble, add 1/3 cup breadcrumbs to pan. Stir with wooden spoon and let toast for about two minutes. Add almonds and toast for another minute or so or until mixture smells fragrantly nutty and garlicky. Remove from heat. Spoon garlic-breadcrumb-almond mixture on top of asparagus, being sure to spoon some of the olive oil onto the asparagus. Add chopped egg and a shower of herbs on top. Serve with some crusty bread to sop up some of the leftover crumbs and garlic infused oil. Enjoy with a nice glass of white wine!"
