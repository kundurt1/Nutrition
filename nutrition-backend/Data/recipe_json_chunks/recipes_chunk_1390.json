A metal bread pan would be perfect. Cover with cling wrap to keep air off (and frost) and freeze. Push the cling wrap into the pan so it is just barely touching the surface of the sorbet mixture.

You leave on the microplane too much of the flavorful liquid from the zest. If you chop larger pieces of zest with sugar, you can better capture the oils and juice from the zest. To do this, take a tablespoon or so of the white sugar you've measured, and put it on your cutting surface. Zest your citrus over the sugar, sprinkle a bit more sugar on top, then chop the zest with the sugar. This makes it easier to chop, too, as the zest doesn't cling as tightly to the knife blade. Using bench scraper, scrape all of the sugar, chopped zest and juice into the mixing bowl when you add the rest of the sugar."

      "First, the marmalade. Juice the lemons and take out the seeds, and make sure you save the juice.",
      "I started to cut the peels into thin strips, and then got fed up and threw them into my food processor because I'm lazy. If you have one, I suggest you do it my way. If not, slice the lemon peels nice and thin.",
      "Either way you slice it (see, see what I did there? This is why I'm a writer, folks. Comedy gold.), throw the peels into a large pot and cover them with cold water. Bring it to a boil and boil for a minute, then drain them and rinse under more cold water. Do it a couple more times, but don't rinse on the last pass.",
      "Throw the peels back into the pot along with the lemon juice and sugar, bring it up to a simmer on medium, and let it cook for around 30 minutes, giving it the occasional stir. To test if it's ready, put a ceramic plate in the freezer, put a little bit of the marmalade on it, and stick it back in for a couple minutes. If you can push the stuff on the plate with your finger and it wrinkles up, you're ready to go. If not, give it some more love on the stove.",
      "While that's happening, you can get to work on the cupcakes.",
      "Start by preheating the oven to 350.",
      "Get a bowl and whisk together the dry stuff: flour, salt, baking soda, and baking powder.",
      "Get another bowl and do the same thing with the yogurt, milk, vanilla, and lemon juice.",
      "Put the butter and sugar in your stand mixer and cream them together on medium for 2-3 minutes, until they're light and fluffy.",
      "Mix in the eggs one at a time, then the lemon zest.",
      "Next, mix in the dry stuff and the wet stuff, alternating until it's all in there.",
      "Stir in the poppy seeds, put the batter in a cupcake tin, then throw it into the oven for about 30 minutes. Let them cool for 5, then let them cool some more on a cooling rack while you make the frosting.",
      "This part's easy: cream together the butter and cream cheese in your stand mixer until they're...well, creamy. Then add the other frosting ingredients and mix. Even a monkey could do it.",
      "Once the cupcakes are at room temperature, scoop out a tablespoon from the tops of each and fill them with that sweet, tangy marmalade.",
      "Frost the cupcakes, top with the toasted coconut, and stick a cookie in the top of each. Unfortunately, due to the limitations of pastry-physics the cookies get all soggy and gross if you keep them in the cupcakes for long, so you gotta put them in the day you eat them."

When the oil is shimmery and hot, use a cookie scoop (figure about 1 1/2 tablespoons) to dollop the meatball mixture into the hot oil. If you don't have a scoop, you can use two spoons. The mixture is too wet to roll in your hands (because we don't want dry meatballs!). And you'll need to do this in batches-don't overcrowd.

      "After 7-minutes, switch on the broiler and watch carefully until the tops are golden brown and the middle has the faintest jiggle. If it is fully set, then the yolks will probably be firm instead of runny and oozing--and that would be sad.",

      "Make the genoise (uses ingredients 1-7): Butter a 8\"cake pans (with 2+\" sides) and line it with parchment. Preheat the oven to 350.\r\n\r\nFill a large saucepan halfway with water and bring to a simmer. Put the eggs, egg yolks, sugar, honey and a pinch of salt in the bowl of a stand mixer. Place the bowl over the simmering water and whip with a whisk until hot (about 115 degrees), foamy and thickened. \r\n\r\nPlace the mixer bowl onto the stand mixer and whip for about 10 minutes until the mixture is cool and very thick. \r\n\r\nSift the flour and cocoa together well - there should be no lumps. Fold the flour/cocoa mixture together with the egg foam. I do this by transferring the foam to a large bowl and then folding in the flour mixture. This makes it easier to fold gently and it gives you room to work, especially if the foam has filled up your mixer bowl. \r\n\r\nGently pour/scrape the batter into the prepared cake pan. Bake for 30 minutes or until the surface of the cake is dry to the touch and the edges of the cake are pulling away from the sides of the pan.\r\n\r\nLet the cake cool for about 10 minutes on a rack. Loosen the sides of the cake from the pan and then unmold to finish cooling.\r\n\r\nTightly wrapped, cake will freeze well for about a month. Defrost in its wrapping before using it.",
      "Make the pudding (uses ingredients 8-15): In a large saucepan, whisk the sugar, cocoa, salt and flour together. Whisk in the cream until the mixture is smooth. Whisk in the yolks until smooth. Heat saucepan over medium-low heat, whisking frequently, until the mixture comes to a gentle boil (bubbles just breaking the surface). The sauce will be thickened enough to coat the back of a spoon. Remove from heat and whisk in butter. Set in refrigerator to chill and thicken.",
      "Make the meringues (uses ingredients 16-22): Preheat the oven to 275. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and trace two 7\" circles on the paper. \r\n\r\nMix 2.5 oz of sugar, the pecans and cornstarch together. Set aside.\r\n\r\nIn a stand mixer, whip the egg whites on medium speed until they start to turn frothy, then increase the speed to medium-high. Add the pinch of salt, and slowly add in the remaining 4 oz of sugar and finally, the vanilla. Beat whites to stiff peaks.\r\n\r\nUsing a spatula or your hand, fold the nut mixture into the whites.\r\n\r\nUse a piping big or spoon to fill the traced circles with meringue. Make sure the circles are level. You will have extra meringue. Use a spoon or piping bag to make little meringue cookies to use to decorate the finished cake (or to just snack on!).\r\n\r\nBake at 275 for 20 minutes and check the meringues. If they are browning too quickly, reduce the heat to 250. Bake until dried through and crunchy - about 90 minutes total.",

Continue layering: cake, pudding, meringue, cream, cake. Top the cake with pudding, billows of cream and little meringue cookies. Sprinkle chopped nuts and grated chocolate over the top of the cake."

It will thicken up, become syrupy, and boil a little slower as it reduces. Watch out that it does not over-boil or burn; you may need to decrease the heat as it thickens. To check to see if it is reduced enough, every now and then pour the juice into a measuring cup to measure it; if it is not 3/4 cup (180 milliliters), pour it back into the saucepan to continue to simmer and reduce until it measures the correct amount. Remove from the heat, transfer from the pan into a bowl, and cool in the refrigerator until cold to the touch.",
      "Using a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment (or an electric hand mixer), whip the cream cheese and 1/2 cup (120 milliliters) of the reduced apple juice concentrate on medium speed for 2 to 3 minutes, or until it is light and fluffy, scraping the bowl occasionally with a rubber spatula to get all of the cream cheese whipped up. (Reserve the rest of the apple juice for another use, such as adding it to oatmeal or drizzling on ice cream, or discard.) Slowly drizzle in the cream and beat on medium speed for 1 to 2 minutes, or until the cream thickens and combines with the cream cheese mixture. Add the cinnamon, vanilla, and salt and mix until well combined. Scrape the frosting into an airtight container and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or up to 3 days. The frosting needs to firm up before you can use it. You will have about 4 cups (960 milliliters) of frosting.",
      "Place a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 350\u00b0 F (175\u00b0 C). Butter and flour two 8-inch (20-centimeter) round cake pans, or butter the pans and line the bottoms with parchment paper.",

Bring the juices to a boil over medium-high heat, decrease the heat to medium-low, and simmer for 20 to 25 minutes, or until the liquid reduces to 3/4 cup (180 milliliters). (See step 1 under the frosting instructions for more details.) Remove from the heat, transfer to a bowl, and cool in the refrigerator until cold to the touch.",
      "In a large bowl, whisk together the apple juice concentrate, eggs, creme fraiche, milk, vegetable oil, vanilla, and reserved chopped pineapple until well combined. In a medium bowl, stir together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, carrots, raisins, sultanas, and walnuts. Add to the egg mixture and fold together with a rubber spatula until well combined.",
      "Scrape the batter into the prepared pans, dividing equally. Bake for 35 to 45 minutes, or until the cakes are light brown (they won't color as much as a full-sugar cake) and spring back when you touch them in the center with your finger. They will not dome very much, if at all.",
      "Remove the cakes from the oven and let cool on a wire rack until you can pop them out of the pans. When the cakes are completely, totally cool (if they are at all warm, the frosting will melt off and it will be a mess), remove them from the pans. Using a long serrated knife, trim the tops of the cakes so they are level (they don't usually round too much, but it's nice to level them off if they do). Place one cake on a plate or cake pedestal (use a cake turner if you have one), and spoon about 1 cup (240 milliliters) of chilled frosting on top; using an offset spatula, spread the frosting evenly all the way to the edges of the cake.",
      "Carefully place the second cake on top of the first cake (place it upside down so the even, sharp edges will be on the top of your finished cake), and spoon about 1 cup (240 milliliters) frosting on top. Spread the frosting thinly to the edges and down the sides of the cake, smoothing it as well as you can and covering the entire cake with a thin layer of frosting. This layer of frosting is called a crumb coat; it keeps loose crumbs from migrating to the surface of the finished cake. (At this point, it helps to refrigerate the cake for about 15 minutes to help set the crumb coat; it's not crucial but if you have time, it makes frosting a little easier.)",
      "When you are done with the crumb coat, spoon a heaping 1 cup (240 milliliters) frosting on the cake and spread it evenly across the top and sides again. This is the final finishing layer of frosting. Fill a piping bag fitted with a small round tip with the remaining frosting, and pipe a border around the bottom of the cake, if you wish, or pile it on top of the cake.",
      "The cake can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 2 days. Any longer than that and the frosting will get softer and may slide off of the cake. Remove the cake from the refrigerator 2 to 3 hours before serving, garnish with fresh fruit or chopped nuts, and serve the cake at cool room temperature."

Let the liquid reduce by 1/2.\r\n\r\nGrab your artichokes and dump them in the pan and let a bit more of the liquid cook off. Pop your chicken back in for a few moments to warm and swim in the sauce. \r\n\r\nI like to serve this right in the pan. The sauce is like catching a glimpse of heaven. Remember to serve with lots of crusty bread!"

In a large pot, bring 6 cups of water plus the clam juice, the reserved shrimp shells, saffron, salt, parsley, thyme, and dried peppers to boil over medium-high heat. Cut 2 tomatoes in half and grate them on a cheese grater all the way down to the skin. Add the grated tomatoes to the clam broth including their juices and discard the skin. When the clam broth comes to a boil add 2 pounds of clams. Cover the pot for 5-10 minutes until all the shells open up. Remove with tongs, remove the meat from the shells, and set aside discarding the shells (unless you want them for decoration in the final dish).",
      "Once the clams are removed, add the wine and lemon juice. (Cooking clams in wine can sometimes cause a slightly metallic flavor, so I add the wine after the clams are removed.) Bring back to a boil and simmer for 1 hour to completely meld flavors. Broth can be made a day ahead but should be reheated to a simmer before adding to the paella.",
      "In a blender or mini-food processor, finely chop the garlic, parsley, salt and Spanish paprika to form a thick paste. Add a little olive oil if necessary. This will be very spicy, but will be added to a large amount of broth and rice so the final effect will be very muted. This step can also be done the day ahead.",
      "Preheat the oven to 400F. In a paella pan or other large pan you will use to cook the paella, heat the oil and cook the sausage. If the sausage is already cooked, cut into slices and brown. Add the peppers and onions and saute until soft and very fragrant. Add the dried red pepper flakes.",

Add the shrimp, 2 pounds of uncooked clams, and scallops to the paella and fold into the rice mixture well. Essentially steaming the seafood in the rice in the oven has been a very effective way for me to prevent overcooking the seafood.

Add the ground turkey, the egg, the shredded cheese of your choice, the ground cumin, dried oregano and some salt. Mix to combine. Wet your hands with water or lightly oil them with some olive oil. Form the mixture into small, walnut-size balls. Add some oil to a large nonstick fry pan and heat it on medium to medium high heat. Place the meatballs in the pan and brown on both sides. Fry the meatballs in batches if needed. You don't want to crowd the pan. As the meatballs are browning, take them out of the pan and reserve on a plate.

Keep the pan on medium to medium high heat and quickly pour the reserved raspberry chipotle sauce over the meatballs. Stir everything around and coat the meatballs with the sauce. Keep stirring. Once the meatballs are cooked, transfer them to a plate. Turn up the heat and cook the sauce a minute or so longer to thicken it, stirring the entire time. It should reduce a little bit and become syrupy. Be careful not to burn the sauce. Put the meatballs back in the pan and coat with the sauce. Serve with fresh lime wedges and any of the suggestions.

Remove the stems then add the chilis to a blender with garlic, chives, mayo, lime juice, salt, sugar and ground black pepper. Blend until smoothly pureed (you might have to stop the machine several times to press down the ingredients). Set aside.",

Mix ground pork or beef with worcestershire sauce, black pepper, salt and tabaso sauce evenly together. Using a round cutter, with a diameter slighter LARGER than the buns you are using (because patties shrink during cooking), measure and shape out 6 ~ 7 patties. Add about 1? thick of meat into the cutter and press down lightly to form flat edges, then release the patty from the cutter. Set aside.",
      "To make the sliders: Heat up a non-stick pan over medium-high heat and add the unsalted butter and olive oil. Once the butter starts to foam, add the smashed garlic and thyme and give it a little swirl (thyme will start to pop). Brush the garlic and thyme to the side to make space for 2 patties (max 3 if using a larger pan)(do not crowd the pan with more than 3). Crack more freshly ground black pepper on the patties and carefully lower it onto the pan without breaking. Then DO NOT move it. Use a large spoon to base the top of the patties with the garlic/thyme oil, then keep the pan partially covered with a lid and cook the patties until you see the bottom crust starts to form and become nice and golden brown. Flip the patties and cook the other side the same way (at this point you can remove the garlic to prevent burning). You should have browned cheese-crust on both sides of the patties. If you want to finish cooking the rest of the patties, add fresh garlic and thyme to the pan (and more oil if needed) and repeat.\r\n\r\nCut the sweet potato and browned butter rolls open (recipe follows). Apply with generous amount of whole grain mustard on the bottom, then top it with one patty and about 1 tbsp of the green chili mayo for each slider. Top it with paper-thinly sliced shallots and the top bun. Serve immediately.\r\n\r\nIf you are anticipating re-heating of the sliders, only add the green chili mayo at the last min before serving otherwise mayo would break if microwaved.",
      "Melt the unsalted butter in a sauce pan and keep heating/swirling over medium heat. The butter will foam and sizzle for a few min, then the sizzling will gradually reside and the browned milk solids will start to form. Turn off the heat completely. Add the browned butter to the cold milk and stir slightly to bring the temperature down a little. The mixture should be warm to the touch but NOT HOT (when in doubt, measure with a thermometer for 110\u00b0F/43\u00b0C). Add the instant dry yeast and let it dissolve for 10 min.",
      "In a stand-mixer with a dough-hook attachment (or by hand), mix the mashed sweet potato, bread flour, sugar and salt. Then add the browned butter/milk/yeast mixture and knead on medium-high speed until the dough is smooth and elastic, approx 6 ~ 7 min. The sweet potato should be completely broken down into the dough. If not, break it with your finger tips until there's no visible pieces. The dough should be soft but not overly sticky. If it seems dry and tough, add 1 tsp of milk at a time to adjust. Knead for another 2 ~ 3 min after adjustment.",

Leave at a warm place in the kitchen for 1:30 ~ 2 hours to proof until doubled in size.\r\n\r\nScrape the dough out of the bowl and punch the air out.

Place the basil into a blender or a small bullet blender. Add in the olive oil and kosher salt and blend until the basil has been finely pureed.\r\nAllow the mixture to sit for 10 minutes. With a bowl underneath, pour the basil oil into a fine mesh sieve lined with cheese cloth or a paper towel. Use a rubber spatula to press the mixture through the liner and sieve. When most of the oil has been pressed out, take the cheese cloth or paper towel out of the sieve. Bundle the cloth together and then squeeze out any of leftover oil.",

Bring the vinegar to a boil over medium-high heat.\r\nOnce the vinegar had boiled, reduce the heat to low so that the vinegar is simmering or lightly bubbling.\r\nAllow the vinegar to simmer for 15-20 minutes. Use a rubber spatula to gently stir the vinegar every 5 minutes. Pay close attention to the vinegar when it reaches the final minutes, as it can burn very quickly.\r\nTo know when the vinegar has reduced enough, dip a metal spoon into the vinegar. Blow on the spoon until the vinegar has cooled slightly. The vinegar should be tacky and viscous enough to coat the spoon. You should be able to run a finger through the vinegar and have it maintain its form. Transfer the vinegar into a bowl and set aside to cool.",

      "To assemble the burgers: spread a little of the mayo on the bottom, then top with the burger and bacon and then top with a scant T. of the slaw. Don't go overboard with the slaw--you want to be able to eat this without falling apart. I put the slaw on top (while most would put it on the bottom...) because the top bun is uaually bigger and it can \"absorb\" more of the liquid. Spread a little of the mayo on the top bun as well. For picture taking purposes, i put the slaw on the bottom so you could see the bacon.",
      "Mouth waters, drool, wipe chin, repeat.\r\n\r\nTo get a true \"one bite\" size, you can cut each slider into quarters and secure with a toothpick. If you do this, break each bacon strip into large one- bite sized pieces so that each quarter has a decent sized piece of bacon."

Serve the sauce over the chicken or, for crisp skin, in a sauceboat.",
      "Genius Tip from Cook's Illustrated, via the Food52 community: The single complaint about this recipe is that there can be too much sputtering or smoke-Kafka would say this is because you've used too big a pan, your oven was already dirty, or the bird was too close to the top of the oven. Regardless, an ingenious way to prevent sputtering is to add potatoes or other hardy vegetables in large chunks to the pan-they'll absorb the delicious juices from the chicken and keep them from spluttering. Stir the vegetables once or twice during roasting and, if they aren't as evenly browned as you'd like when the chicken is done, simply return the pan to the oven (sans chicken) until they are, decreasing the temperature as needed."

Place the turkey legs onto a roasting pan, and cook for one hour, turning after 30 minutes.\r\n\r\nWhile the turkey legs are roasting in the oven, make the glazing sauce.\r\n\r\nTo a sauce pan, add in the honey, whiskey, ketchup, salt, pepper, ketchup, and brown sugar. Bring to a low boil, then reduce the heat, stirring frequently. Turn off the heat, and set aside.",
      "After the turkey has cooked in the oven, turn up the heat to 400 degrees. Begin brushing on the glaze, cooking for the first 10 minutes.

On the final turn, glaze once again and cook for another ten minutes.",

      "To serve, just grab those legs, using the bone as your handle. Dig in, get messy, and take on the delicious whiskey flavor. You get tender, smokey meat, with a subtle hit of the whiskey glaze. My kids could not stop eating it, and I could not have been happier watching them eat their very first turkey leg."

Put the fruit in a noncorrosive container, cover with four cups of water and let it stand covered for 24 hours.",

Test for readiness by putting a teaspoon of jam on a small plate that has been in the freezer. If it gels, the marmalade is done. The mixture should be a soft gel. If it runs, it is not ready.",
      "Meanwhile, in a large pot put the clean jars and bands in boiling water and boil for 10 minutes. Turn off the heat, add the lids and leave everything in the water until the marmalade is ready. I often run my jars through a cycle in the dishwasher and keep them warm in the dishwasher, so I don't have to put them in boiling water. However, it is important to be safe and follow the guidelines given by the US Department of Agriculture.",
      "Ladle the jam into jars, leaving some space at the top. Wipe the top of the jar clean with a moist paper towel and add the lid. Screw the ring onto the jar. I turn the hot jars upside down for 20-30 minutes. After that, I check to make sure that they are sealed. If they are not, I put them in a water bath for 10-15 minutes and boil them until the tops pop. Place a jar rack, or metal mush basket in the pot to prevent the jars from touching the bottom. I use an old pie tin turned upside down. Fill the pot with water (halfway up the jars ). You know your jars are sealed when the lid doesn't move or pop when you press on it. To be totally safe, follow the manufacturer's instructions that comes with the jars."

Uncover the pan and saute the rabe until it is tender but still retains some of its bright green color, 2 to 3 more minutes. Set the pan aside.",
      "Warm about 3 cups of milk in a microwave or in a small pan. Put the harina into a large pot over medium heat. While stirring with a wooden spoon, add the milk in a slow steady stream. Continue to stir vigorously as you add the milk so that the cornmeal does not clump. (Note: if you stop stirring to take pictures of what you are doing, you will get lots of lumps. If you keep stirring, though, eventually most of these will come out.) Once you have added the 3 cups of milk, add the garlic-salt mixture and continue to stir.",
      "Keep the milk jar handy. As the mixture thickens, continue to add milk a cup at a time (this milk need not be warm). This process is not an exact science. You are aiming for a smooth, creamy texture that is about the consistency of grits or thin oatmeal. It took me about 30 minutes and 5 additional cups of milk to get to this point.",
      "Gabe knows the harina is ready when it starts to produce large bubbles -- mini volcanoes, really -- when he stops stirring. The harina should be thick enough to stick to the spoon when you pull it out of the mixture. The easiest way for me to tell when the harina is done is to taste it. If the harina is not fully cooked, the individual grains of cornmeal will still be hard when you bite into them. Once the harina is finished cooking, it will still retain a bit of graniness, but when you bite into an individual grain, you will not get any resistance.",
      "When the harina is finished, taste it and add more salt if you like. Stir and cover it while you fry the eggs. Heat a large skillet or griddle over medium high heat. Depending on the size of your cooking surface, you may be able to cook multiple eggs at once. Be sure to give each egg lots of room so that you can flip it without breaking the yolk.",
      "Add about a teaspoon each of butter and olive oil to the pan for each egg. When the butter has melted and begins to sizzle, add the eggs one at a time. Cook until the edges are brown and crispy and the egg white begins to firm up. Flip and cook the other side for about 15 seconds. To plate the dish, ladel a couple of scoops of harina into a shallow bowl, add the broccoli rabe, and top with an egg.",
      "Note that as the harina sits, it will thicken. If you want to thin it again, heat it, add more milk, and stir vigorously until it is smooth again. Leftovers will solidify. You can cut them into pieces and fry them or heat them and eat them with a bit of sugar sprinkled on it, as Gabe's grandfather used to do."

      "Cut the top of each tomato to create a 2-inch cap. With a small spoon, carefully scoop out and discard the seeds and pulp, leaving the shell intact. Place the tomato shells upside down on the prepared baking sheet with their caps on the side and refrigerate.",
      "Heat up one tablespoon of olive oil in a medium saute pan. Add the mushrooms, onions, and shallots then cook until they are tender. Transfer the vegetables to a plate and let them cool to room temperature",
      "Combine the bread crumbs and cream together. Mix together the ground pork, soaked bread crumbs, sauteed mushroom mixture, parsley, basil, oregano, rosemary, thyme, garlic, and egg. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Season the inside of each tomato with salt and pepper, then stuff each tomato with enough pork filling to makes a slight mount above the rim of the tomato shell. Wrap each tomato with a piece of aluminum foil folded into the same height as the tomatoes. This helps the tomato to maintain their shape in the oven.",
      "Scatter the roasting herbs, garlic, and water over the bottom of a baking pan. Place the tomato farci on top of the herbs and bake for 45 to 50 minutes. After 25 minutes rotate the pan and if the pan is too dry a small amount of additional water to the bottom of the pan. When finished, remove the pan from the oven and transfer the tomatoes to a warm serving platter. Top the tomatoes with their caps, strain the pan juices through a fine mesh sieve and then drizzle the tomatoes with the pan juices. Serve with rice, or summer beans."

      "NOTES:\r\n- I always double grind the meat for my meatballs. I think it makes them extra tender and moist. I either ask the butcher to do it for me or just throw regular ground meat in my food processor for about 20 seconds to get a finer texture and more even distribution of fat. Of course, it's not the end of the world if you don't double-grind the meat (and Mehdi didn't for this recipe) but think it makes a mighty fine meatball. \r\n\r\n- I think these kefta would be beautiful with lamb instead of beef or a mix of half-lamb, half-beef.",
      "First, make the kefta (meatballs): combine the beef, 1/4 cup of the chopped cilantro, 2 1/2 teaspoons of the kefta rub, 1 teaspoon salt and the onion in a medium bowl. Mix well to combine. (I think it's easiest to mix with your hands.) Using your hands or a small scoop, shape the mixture into walnut-sized balls. Place on a parchment-lined sheet pan and chill for at least 20 minutes.",
      "While the kefta are chilling, heat the olive oil in a large skillet or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the tomato, tomato paste, remaining 1/4 cup chopped cilantro, harissa, the remaining 2 teaspoons kefta rub, a generous pinch of salt and pepper and the water. Cook until the tomato has broken down and the mixture has thickened to a sauce-like consistency. Add the kefta. Cover and cook until the meatballs are almost cooked through, about 10 minutes. Use a spoon to make an egg-sized hole in the shakshuka. Crack one of the eggs into the hole. Repeat with the remaining 3 eggs. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook until the eggs reach desired doneness, about 10 minutes for medium-soft. Sprinkle the eggs with a little salt. Scatter the whole cilantro leaves over the shakshuka and serve hot.",

Use a pizza cutter and straightedge to make vertical and horizontal cuts all the way across the dough. Don't trim the excess. Use a fork to make holes in the crackers in whatever pattern you'd like. Don't separate the crackers yet.",

Chop the chocolate into small chunks and place half of them in a large metal or glass bowl. Place the bowl over the simmering water, making sure that the water doesn't touch the bowl. Using a spatula or wooden spoon, mix the chocolate until it's almost completely melted. Take the bowl off the pot and wipe away any moisture from the bottom. Slowly add the remaining chocolate pieces, continuing to stir until each addition melts, and then add another few chunks. The chocolate will start to get glossy. The more you stir, the glossier your chocolate will be. If you have a candy thermometer, keep stirring until the chocolate reaches 90\u00b0 F. No thermometer? No problem. Keep stirring and after about 10 minutes, dip a metal spoon in the chocolate, and then stick it in the refrigerator for 2 minutes for dark, 5 for milk. If it comes out set and glossy and not tacky to the touch, it's perfect. If it's still sticky, it's not cool enough, and not tempered, so keep mixing and add any remaining chocolate pieces.",
      "To drizzle, lay the cooled crackers on a rack placed over parchment paper. Use a fork to drizzle the chocolate in a criss-cross pattern over the crackers. Let the chocolate harden. To coat, dip each cracker halfway (or all the way!) into the chocolate. Lay the dipped crackers directly on the parchment and wait for the chocolate to harden.",
      "Store in an airtight container for up to two weeks. If you want to bake in advance, freeze the plain crackers and then add the chocolate before you want to serve."

      "1. Snip the stems from the figs and, in a small sauce pan, simmer them in the red red wine, turning occasionally, for about ten minutes, until much of the wine reduces and is absorbed by the figs. Remove from the heat and leave the softened figs in the wine until ready to use.",
      "2. Prepare the fig stuffing. Chill the chocolate chips in the freezer so that they won't melt when chopped. Lightly toast the hazelnuts in a dry skillet, then allow to cool. Chop the chocolate chips and hazel nuts in a small electric chopper or food processor until they form a coarse meal.",
      "3. Stuff the softened figs by cutting a slit down the length, then using your fingers to press in the fig flesh to make a cavity, and filling this with a small spoonful of the minced hazelnut and chocolate mixture. Set aside. Reserve the remaining fig-flavored red wine for creme fraiche topping.",
      "Prepare the batter by combining the dry ingredients in one bowl and whisking together the buttermilk, egg yoke and melted butter in another bowl. Beat the egg white until stiff. Combine the dry ingredients into the wet. The batter should be runny like a thickish pancake batter. Add a little more buttermilk if necessary to achieve the right consistency. Then fold in the egg white.",
      "Heat an aebelskiver pan and butter well. Fill each of the cavities to about 1/2 the height with batter. Then place a stuffed fig into each well and top with a little more batter to cover the fig and fill the well. Cook for about a minute. With a skewer tip the dumpling to one side so that the cooked half dome is perpendicular to the pan and cook for another minute. Now catch each dumpling on the corner between the first half dome and the second half dome and rotate this to the top, so that the least cooked face of the dumpling points downwards. Keep rotating the dumplings for a few more minutes until they are golden brown on all sides and cooked through.",
      "Prepare a topping to serve with the dumplings by mixing in a few tablespoons of the reduced figgy red wine with creme fraiche to taste. Serve the dumplings warm with a dollop of the flavored creme fraiche, and if you like, a sprinkle of powdered sugar."

      "Note to cooks: while it might be hard to believe now, in the olden days (like 1960) they used to mix salads in wooden bowls. Some of the Caesar recipes I've looked at were explicit in that direction. Of course that was before God invented Pyrex. In those days people weren't so afraid of salad borne microbes. But then, they didn't have to be. Somehow the combination of salad green and e-coli hadn't yet become an issue worth thinking about, let alone salmonella in chickens and eggs.",
      "Additional note to cooks: with our oceans getting fished out and BP destroying what's left pretty soon the only seafood that can survive sustainably will be anchovy and squid. So it's good to know how to prepare a Caesar salad or a fritto misto. This is not a joke. The lives of millions of people on the Gulf Coast have been changed in the worst way for perhaps half of a century to come."

    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "Make certain all your tools are very clean, either by pouring boiling water over them, or rubbing them with sake or vodka. Miso is very susceptible to outside influences at the early stage of fermentation, so if you have any other fermented foods on the go, like sourdough starter, or sauerkraut vat, then take extra care with this cleaning stage. Please do not use antibacterial anything as this will kill the beautiful invisible beasties that we rely on to make miso delicious.",
      "Sort through and give the chickpeas a good wash in cool water, removing anything that isn't a chickpea. Soak chickpeas overnight in plenty of water.",
      "Drain the chickpeas and give them another rinse. Put the chickpeas in a large pot (they will probably double in size, so you might have to do this in two pots) and cover with at least two inches of water. Bring to a boil and simmer until the chickpeas are very soft and easy to mush (more than regular chickpea cooking). You may need to add more water during the cooking so keep an eye on it. This can take one to six hours depending on the quality and age of your chickpeas. (feel free to use a pressure cooker for this stage, following the instructions that came with the cooker)",
      "While the chickpeas cooking, combine your koji rice and salt. Massage the salt into the rice with your clean hands. This helps wake up the koji. Place to one side",
      "Remove the chickpeas from the cooking liquid, keeping the cooking liquid to one side for later. When it's cool enough to handle; using the method of your choice, mash approximately one third of the chickpeas. I use to take one third of the chickpeas and put them in the blitzer, then return them to their friends, but now I use the back of a wooden spoon to mash the beans against the side of a bowl until roughly one third look mashed up.",
      "Leave the chickpeas to one side to cool (you can stir them occasionally to speed up cooling). When they are cool enough to handle (less than 120 degrees F) then mix the chickpeas, koji rice and salt together. Add small amounts of cooking liquid into the mix until everything has the consistency of soggy playdough.",
      "(optional: moisten and sprinkle the inside of the vat with sea salt first) A little bit at a time, put the mix into your fermentation vat (a one gallon size vessel made from non-reactive substance like pottery, glass, or even plastic). Be careful not to leave any air bubbles as you fill up the vat. Press it down well and smooth over the top. You can sprinkle about 1/2 to 1 teaspoon of sea salt on top to encourage friendly fermentation - optional but recommended if you are going to be fermenting warmer than 72 degrees F",
      "Cover the top of the miso with plastic wrap, or the more traditional method of kombu seaweed that has been soaking in water for about half an hour. Find a plate or inner lid that is just a little bit smaller than the inside of your vat (about 1/4 inch is best, but miso is forgiving if it's a bit smaller). Place this inner lid on top of the miso and weigh it down with a cleaned stone, jug of water, or other food-safe weight. My rock weighs about 5 pounds, but again, miso is forgiving if you want a heavier or lighter weight. Cover the whole thing with a clean cotton or linen cloth to prevent dust and flies getting in.",
      "Tuck your miso vat away somewhere where it can stay at room temperature (roughly 68 to 72 degrees F is ideal, but it can easily tolerate hotter or colder temperatures). Leave it alone for at least three weeks, preferably a month, and up to six weeks. Check on it every few days if you like. After a few days, there should be a layer of liquid on top, if not, add some boiled and cooled water so it only just covers the top of the paste.",
      "When you open up your vat, there will be mold. If there isn't, it's unusual. It should still be alright if it has a sweet smell to it. Koji, the ingredient that does most of the hard work in miso making, is a mold. The mold will probably be white with blue, green or yellow patches. Although koji mold is good for us, it can also impart a musty, unpleasant flavour to the miso. So we will scrape the mold off the top (perhaps first draining the liquid into a bowl). If you have to scrape off some of the miso, that's fine too. (Here's the scary bit which is standard for just about all fermentations: If the mold is black coloured, then things are wrong and should be discarded, likewise if there is a horrible (non-miso) odor permeating from the ferment. It is highly unlikely that something will go wrong, especially with this time honoured technique; however, it's your miso, I can't be there to smell it for you, so you're going to have to rely on your own judgement.)",
      "Once the liquid is removed from the top and the mold is scraped from the surface mix up all the remaining miso paste together. It should be quite lumpy. If you want a smooth miso paste, puree it at this stage, but personally I take great joy in the traditional texture of chunky homemade miso. Besides, I can always pure a tiny bit if a recipe demands a smooth paste.",
      "Place the miso in clean jars (or other non-reactive containers) being careful to avoid air pockets. This should keep in the fridge for about a year.",
      "The liquid from the top of the vat is Tamari - a very potent sauce, something like soy sauce (only without soy because we used chickpeas!). Strain the tamari through a clean (I boil mine), tightly woven cloth to remove any spare bits of mold. Label and and use as you would soy sauce (only use less as it's super-potent)."

Once sugar is dissolved and mixture is boiling you will need to keep a pretty close eye on the pan. If you are using a candy thermometer you will notice the mixture hovers near the boiling point for a while then starts to climb fairly rapidly. As the mixture approaches 310\u00b0F, you will want to start swirling it fairly frequently as caramelization is imminent. Once caramel color is to your liking, remove pan from heat. The pan will retain some heat so I like to remove the caramelized sugar mixture from the heat at about 325-330\u00b0F, or when it is a golden brown color.",
      "Slowly pour the warm cream mixture through a mesh strainer into the the sugar mixture. It will boil violently and create hot steam, so use caution. Stir with a wooden spoon until sugar has all dissolved into the cream.",

Stir often, scraping the bottom of the pan. As you get close to your target temperature you may want to turn the heat down to low if you are using a gas stove, or off if you are using electric to slow things down. Your caramels can go from too soft to tooth breaking within a short time frame. You will also want to stir close to continuously as you get close to your target temp to prevent burning.",
      "Remove from heat and quickly stir in the vanilla and liquid smoke.\r\n (Note: I like to put the drops of liquid smoke into a tablespoon measure, and add the vanilla to it. You don't want to add the liquid smoke directly from the bottle to the caramel mixture as it would be easy to add more than you want.) Pour caramel mixture into prepared 9- by 13-inch pan. After 10 to 15 minutes sprinkle with fleur de sel or chocolate finishing salt if desired, ideally getting several grains per piece of caramel. Allow to cool to room temperature. Use parchment paper to remove from the pan, then cut caramel into 1-inch squares, or whatever size pieces you prefer. Wrap individually with waxed paper, and store in an airtight container.",
      "Note: Caramel making is a bit trial-and-error based on humidity and other factors. If your caramels come out too soft, modify the final temperature up 1-4 degrees. If they come out too hard, modify down. This recipe scales down by half to an 8-inch square pan if you want to make a smaller amount or feel like experimenting!"

      "First, before you ask, marbles? Yes, marbles. You place them in your heavy cast iron enamled pot even before pouring in the milk. The name of the game when making dulce de leche is slooow cooking, and the marbles, gently moblized by the rising steam in the milk, not only make a pleasant, soft rustle (which, if you are less distracted than I am should serve to remind you to occasionally check your simmering milk) but constantly move the milk at the bottom of the pan, closest to the heat source, thus preventing any scorching.",
      "Place the marbles in a wide, heavy cast iron pot, pour milk over them and gently heat until steam begins to rise. Add the sugar, baking powder and whole vanilla bean. Whisk until sugar is completely absorbed. (This is an important step in order to achieve desired smoothness of dulce de leche.)",
      "Now you almost leave this alone, like a child having a nap, for 2 to 3 hours. But like a napping child, you will want to check in every once in a while. Make sure you can hear the marbles tapping against the pot and that the milk is never at more than a bare simmer. You are done when it has become a soft caramel coloured mass with a pudding-like consistency. Remember that ducle de leche firms up as it cools, but that in this case you want a pretty firm dulce de leche, not so gooey it won't stand up between those two cookies. Remove marbles, cool and set aside.",
      "While it is bubbling away, you can make your disks. Preheat your over to 350F. In a large bowl, whisk together the cornstarch, flour, sugar and baking powder. Make a well at the center, and fill it with the egg yolks, butter, grated lemon rind, vanilla and cognac. (The original recipe I have, from the 1964 edition of the legendary Cocine con Sal y Pimienta, calls for an unspecified amount of vanilla and a demitasse cup of cognac. I found this created too wet a dough.)",
      "Using a dough blender and then your hands, bring the dough together into a solid mass. Allow ten mnutes to overnight to rest. On a well-conrstarched surface, roll out your dough into a thin layer, about 3 or 4 mm, and cut into small rounds. (Average is 5 cm but I like these small and went for 4 cm.) Make for about 12 minutes, keeping a sharp eye out for the moment they disks are fully baked but have not yet started to colour.",
      "Cool the disks on a rack, then form your cookies by sandwiching a nice amount of sulce de leche between two disks and lightly pressing them together. This is key because the effect you are after is of two cookies containing the jam, not a tightly packed amalgamation.",

It's important to not disturb the jars during this process-and it's ideal to leave them at least 10 to 12 hours before moving them. Once they're cooled, check the seals by pressing your finger on the top of the lid. It shouldn't move at all: If it does, the jar hasn't sealed properly. If it doesn't move, you're ready to open or store your jars! Store for up to 1 year in a cool, dark place. Once opened, the marmalade should be refrigerated and it will keep up to 3 months.\r\n\r\nIf you don't want to can your marmalade, just let your marmalade cool to room temperature, then transfer the jars to the refrigerator. They'll keep in there for up to 3 months (the same shelf life as any opened jam/jelly/marmalade)."

In a cup lightly beat the egg, add olive oil, orange juice, sugar and vanilla extract and mix well. Pour the liquid in a well in the flour and start mixing it with a fork, then with your hads until you get rather soft elastic dough.\r\n\r\nIf you use a food processor simply add all the ingredients to the bowl and mix them until the dough forms.",

Cut the dough into 5-6 cm diameter circles, then cut smaller holes in the center of every circle. Roll out the scraps and cut more doughnuts. Repeat until you use all of your dough.",
      "Set the donuts aside to rise in a warm place and prepare the glaze. Simply combine cocoa powder and caster sugar in a small pan, add water and bring it to the boil over medium low heat stirring constantly. When it starts to boil remove immediately from the heat, add the oil and mix it thoroughly until emulsified. Set aside to cool.",
      "Heat a heavy-bottomed pot with about 3 cm of corn oil to 180 C. Carefully place 2-3 donuts in the oil and fry each side until golden. Remove from the pot and drain on a plate lined with paper towels. Cover your donuts with chocolate glaze and powdered sugar and enjoy in the family circle telling about Hanukkah miracle!

      "Sprinkle some water drops on the tray, not on the dough.\r\nBake for 15 minutes, then *without opening the oven door*, reduce temp to 300F and bake another 14 minutes.\r\nIt is critical to bake enough that the dough rises by steam power, then stiffens to hold its shape.\r\nIf you open the oven door too soon, the dough will collapse.\r\nNote: we can still end up with a nice eclair as the filling will puff them up!\r\nSet aside to cool.",

      "Combine the raspberries and sugar in a sauce pan and heat on medium, stirring occasionally. Let it boil and thicken. It will become a syrup in about 12 min of boiling time.",
      "Pour through a strainer to remove seeds! A wooden spoon pressed around the inside of the strainer will help the raspberry jam to go through!",
      "Place the gelatin in a teacup and add 2 tbs of cold water, stirring immediately. As soon as wetted, spoon into the raspberry. Stir vigorously to spread the gelatin.",
      "Now watch the mixture cool gradually. As it cools it will stiffen. When getting a bit stiff, spoon over the eclairs. Some will run off. If too runny, wait for further cooling.\r\nIt is fine to pour additional layers!"

Add in the small can of evaporated milk, tomato paste, worchestershire sauce, 4 eggs (which were lightly beaten with a wisk first), season salt, mixed dried italian herbs, salt and very finely ground black pepper.

For each food processor small section of meat processed, add a couple of Tab of coconut milk and a big ladle full of minced veg/oil mixture. Pulse all three together on and off until meat is finer and coconut milk and veg mix are incorporated evenly, but no more. Meat should be smoother and less grainy, and lighter in color due to coconut milk. Put each batch of meat mixture into a single big mixing bowl each time a batch is finished, until all 4 lb of ground meat is processed and coconut milk is gone. If there's any minced veg mix left, and it seems right to you, add as much more as you think appropriate. Preheat oven to 350F while finishing loaf.",

Place meatloaf mixture into a very large rectangular 10\" X 15\" (4 qt) Pyrex dish which has been lighted greased with coconut oil. Shape with hands into one large loaf, while forming a 1\" trough around all edges of meat, more or less. Put Pyrex baking dish onto a large jellyroll pan just in case there's any liquid that comes out. Put on a tent of foil attached only on two short handle ends of glass Pyrex dish (ie leaving the two long sides down but unattached).",

(not saving this grease, but very hot so take care!). Cover with foil again and put dish back in oven for 20 minutes. Peek after 20 minutes to see if need to drain again. I didn't. Cook covered in foil for another 20 minutes approximately--until internal temperature reaches 170F on an instant-read thermometer. Note that the meat may still look pink because of the tomato paste in the mixture, so go by temperature and not time or appearance. When done, dip off any final liquid exuded and let loaf cool in its dish awhile. Then put in refrigerator to chill overnight, tightly covered. Next day, cut into 8 dinner-sized pieces (or 12-16 lunch-sized pieces) and freeze individually.",

Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a damp tea towel and set aside for an hour so the flour can fully hydrate.",

Cut the portion into 4 equal lengths, then roll each length into a \"rope\" about 1/2-inch in diameter and 5 to 6 inches long. Try to taper the ends slightly, as they will overlap when you form the taralli, but don't fret about making them perfect.",

Flip the ring over onto your thumb, while maintaining the pinch. Place the shaped taralli on a baking sheet, continuing to twist the pinch as needed to help get a good union. Repeat the process until all the taralli are formed.",
      "Make sure the water is gently boiling before proceeding. If the water is boiling too vigorously it is likely the taralli will come apart at the pinched seam. Gently add 6 to 8 of the taralli to the water (you may want to start with fewer to test your boil level). Don't worry if an occasional one comes apart, just use it for a taste test when they're done. Cook until they float to the surface (a few may stick to the bottom, gently dislodge them as needed), and look like an inner tube floating in the water. They will start out perpendicular to the surface, but wait to remove them until they're parallel. Use a spider or slotted spoon to scoop them out of the water, several at a time. Drain briefly over the pot, then transfer to the prepared baking sheet. Arrange them on the baking sheet so that all 32 fit. They will only puff slightly during baking, so they can be close to each other, but shouldn't be touching. They are going to look a little grey and sad on the baking sheet, so don't be dismayed-all will be well once they bake. Boil the remaining taralli, allowing the water to return to a gentle boil between batches if necessary.",
      "Bake 45 to 50 minutes, rotating the sheet midway. They will be lightly browned and crisp when they are done. Transfer the taralli to a wire rack, and allow to cool completely before serving or storing. They will keep several days in an airtight container."

      "Rinse the potato strips in a bowl filled with cold water, changing the water several times. Lay them out on paper towels and pat dry, doing your best to get as much moisture out of them as possible.",
      "Fill a fryer or a Dutch oven with canola oil, at least 2 to 3 inches high. Heat over medium heat until oil reaches 300 to 325\u00b0 F. Add 1 to 2 heaping handfuls of the potatoes and cook until you notice them just beginning to turn lightly golden on the edges and the texture starts to look slightly more puffy, about 5 to 7 minutes. It's important to make sure the oil temperature is right-too low and the fries will absorb too much oil; too high and they'll cook unevenly. Also, the potatoes will bubble and pop roughly in the hot oil, so be careful while handling. Work in batches while you fry so that the potatoes aren't overcrowded. If you add too many at a time, the temperature of the oil will drop too quickly and your frites will turn out too oily. After each batch is finished, remove the potatoes with a slotted spoon and set aside on paper towels to drain.",
      "Preheat oven to 200\u00b0 F.",
      "Once you're ready for the second fry, increase the heat to medium-high until it reaches approximately 350 to 375\u00b0 F. Add the first-fried potatoes back into the now very hot oil, one to two handfuls at a time, and fry until golden brown, about 2 to 3 minutes. (Again, work in batches here and be sure not to overcrowd the pan.) Remove with a slotted spoon and rest either on paper towels or a wire rack to drain. Sprinkle with salt to taste.",
      "If you're too engrossed in cooking the frites to worry about the mussels, spread the finished frites out onto a wire wrack and place in the preheated oven for up to 30 minutes while you prepare the mussels.",
      "In a large pot or saucepan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the shallots and cook until they begin to turn translucent, about 2 minutes. Add the garlic and continue cooking until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Add the saffron threads, cinnamon, cumin, coriander, ginger, paprika, and salt, then increase the heat to medium-high and cook for about 30 seconds.",
      "Add the sherry to the pan and continue to cook over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally. Once nearly all of the sherry liquid has cooked down, add the seafood stock, harissa, butter, and stir. Reduce the heat to medium, add the mussels, and cover he pot or pan with a tight fitting lid. Continue simmering the liquid until all of the mussels have opened, about 4 to 5 minutes.",
      "Spoon the mussels and broth into bowls, discarding any unopened mussels. Garnish with mint and additional harissa, if desired, and serve with a crusty baguette or fresh frites."

      "Prepare a two stage system on your gas or charcoal grill by focusing high heat on one side (such as the back or left side) and low heat on the opposite side. Allow to heat while you prepare your vegetables.",
      "Slice the eggplant into 1\" thick slices and place in a large bowl with the tomatoes, peppers, onion, fennel, garlic and jalapeno. Drizzle ? c. olive oil over the vegetables (or more if you have a particularly thirsty eggplant) and toss to coat evenly. Dose a few heavy pinches of salt onto the vegetables and toss again, trying not to break up the delicate vegetables.",
      "Clean the grates of the hot grill with a sturdy, bristled brush and rub them liberally with oil. Have a large, clean sheet/roasting pan handy with some aluminum foil. Wrap the head of garlic in foil and place it in a hot, corner spot. Begin placing your vegetables, cut side down, on the hot side of the grates (in batches if you must). I like to begin with the veggies that are going to take the longest such as the tomatoes, onion and fennel.",
      "Now begins the juggling act. Depending on your grill's tendencies, the veggies you have and your preferences, they will all take different amounts of time to reach doneness. Keep the lid on the grill closed, sit and enjoy a beverage (but do not walk away from your precious veggies), and as they become soft and delightfully charred, remove them to the waiting pan, tenting them with foil. As a basic guide, the veggies should take anywhere from 30 minutes for the garlic, 20 minutes for the tomatoes, onion and peppers, 15 - 20 for the fennel, 10 - 15 minutes for the eggplant, and 5 - 10 for the jalapeno. As the veggies take on color, flip them to evenly distribute the char and move them onto the cooler side to finish their cooking. Don't be afraid to move the veggies as needed, but keep in mind that they become increasingly delicate as they cook",
      "As the veggies cook, whisk together the vinegar, remaining ? c. olive oil, another generous pinch of salt, capers and a few good grinds of black pepper, in a bowl and set aside. After all of the veggies have cooked to your desired doneness (don't be afraid to taste them!), allow them to cool long enough to handle them. Roughly chop the eggplant, tomatoes, onion, fennel and jalapeno, peel some of the char from the peppers by hand and roughly chop as well. Squeeze the soft, sweet garlic cloves into the red wine vinaigrette and mash with a fork. Place the chopped veggies in a bowl or on a plate (if desired, the chopped veggies can be reheated in the tented roasting pan for 5 - 10 minutes on the grill before dressing) and drizzle with the vinaigrette. Taste for seasoning before scattering the pine nuts and torn basil over and serving as a starter with toasted, country bread, a vegetable side to meats, poultry and fish, or anything else you can possibly imagine."

      "MAKE THE CAKE LAYERS: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Butter and lightly flour two 9: cake pans. Line the bottoms with parchment paper. Sift the flour with the baking powder, baking soda and salt; set aside. With an electric stand mixer on medium speed, cream the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. On low speed, beat in the eggs, one at a time. Beat in the vanilla. Scrape down the sides of the bowl a few times. Add the flour mixture alternately with the buttermilk in 5 increments. Scrape the batter into the prepared pans, smoothing the tops evenly; tap down on the counter to release the air from the batter. Bake for 30-35 minutes or until lightly golden brown and a tester comes out clean. Cool in the pan 15 minutes; peel off the parchment paper and finish cooling on a rack before frosting.",
      "MAKE THE STRAWBERRY TOPPING & FILLING: In a microwave safe glass bowl, melt the white chocolate just until softened. White chocolate burns easily! Remove from the microwave and continue to stir until smooth. Cool slightly on the counter. Rinse and dry the strawberries. Pick 8 nice looking strawberries for your topping. Dip halfway into the melted white chocolate. Cool on a waxed paper lined 1/4 sheet pan in the refrigerator so the chocolate hardens. Remove the green tops, hull and slice the remaining strawberries; place in a medium mixing bowl. Stir in a few tablespoons of raspberry preserves. Refrigerate until ready to use.",
      "MAKE THE WHIPPED CREAM: Chill the mixing bowl and wire whisk beaters. To the chilled mixing bowl, add the cream, confectioner's sugar and vanilla extract. Whip the cream on high speed until soft peaks form. Do not over whip or the mixture will become too stiff. Refrigerate in the bowl until ready to use.",
      "PUT IT ALL TOGETHER: Line the edges of a 12\" cake dish with 3\" waxed paper pieces. This will keep the dish clean and will be easily removed when you finish frosting the cake. Place 1 cake layer in the middle of the dish on top of the waxed paper. Brush off any stray crumbs. Brush a few tablespoons of raspberry jam evenly over the top of the cake layer. Spread an even layer of whipped cream (about 1 inch) and then an even layer of prepared strawberry filling over the whipped cream. Top with the remaining cake layer (brush excess crumbs off beforehand). Brush a few tablespoons of raspberry jam evenly over the top of the cake layer. Frost the top and sides with the remaining whipped cream using your own artistic pattern. I like swirls and dips. Arrange 8 white chocolate dipped strawberries on top of the cake. HELLO GORGEOUS!

      "Meanwhile, bring a large pot of heavily salted water to a boil. Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat and cook until nutty and lightly browned, about 7 to 8 minutes. Stir in smoked paprika and pecans. Continue to cook until nuts are lightly toasted and fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes more.",
      "Add gnocchi to water, stirring once to prevent sticking, and cook until all the gnocchi have floated to the surface, about 3 minutes. Using a mesh spider or slotted spoon, transfer gnocchi directly to the skillet and toss to coat in the butter. Add lemon juice, swirling pan to incorporate into a creamy sauce. If the butter mixture appears thin, add several tablespoons of the cooking water, swirling to emulsify. Season to taste and transfer to serving bowls; top with additional parmesan, if desired."
