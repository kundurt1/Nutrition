Chop 4 hard-cooked eggs and add to the potatoes, along with the red onion, green pepper, and celery. Sprinkle with the celery seed. Gradually stir in the mayonnaise, mustard, and relish (wear rubber or plastic gloves and use your hands, if you wish), being careful not to smash the potatoes. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Transfer to a large serving bowl. Slice the 2 remaining hard-cooked eggs. Arrange the slices on top of the salad and sprinkle with paprika. Serve immediately, or cool, cover tightly with plastic wrap, and refrigerate until chilled, at least 2 hours. (Note: For a potato salad with a kick, add 2 seeded and minced jalapeno peppers.)."

If your family is not so keen on mushrooms then leave out the canned and dried mushrooms. The sauce will still have a strong cream-gravy, especially if you fried the chops to a golden colour and scraped the bottom of the pan to rescue those flavours. This recipe holds up well to experimentation with dried spices and other add-ins. Try adding dried pakprika (sweet), chives, thyme, sage, applewood smoke seasoning, a few spoonfuls of sour cream or a handful of homemade bacon bits for variation."

      "HOLLANDAISE SAUCE: In a blender or food processor, put the egg yolks, mustard, cayenne, and water. Blend this together and then slowly start pouring in the warm butter with the blender running to incorporate. Add the lemon juice, salt, and pepper. Thin with a little water if it's too thick. Keep warm.",
      "HASH: Heat the oil in a nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add the potatoes, and carrots. Cook until soft, about 10 minutes. Add the onion, corned beef, and chives, and cook 5-10 minutes, turning occasionally. If desired for crispiness, during the last few minutes, don't turn the hash in order to create a searing or browning on the bottom.",
      "EGGS: ln a large skillet filled with 2\" of water, bring it to a boil, and add the vinegar. Reduce the heat to a simmer and crack the eggs carefully into the water. Using a spoon, spoon water up over the top of the eggs several times while they cook. Simmer until the eggs are set, about 3-4 minutes. Remove the eggs with a slotted spoon and place them on paper towels to dry them off.",
      "SERVE: Place the hash evenly onto warm serving plates. Using the back of a spoon, make a hollow in the center of the hash. Place a poached egg into the hollows and then top with hollandaise; garnish with chives."

Stir in flour, baking soda, and salt. Then add the chocolate chips . Mix until combined. For smaller cookies use a rounded tablespoon to dish out round dough balls. For larger cookies, an ice cream scoop works well. Before you cook your cookies, freeze them first. Doing this will ensure that the flour and butter cook at the same time, which leaves you with plump rounded cookies (the reason most homemade cookies turn out flat and greasy is because the butter cooks out first). Once frozen, on an ungreased cookie pan cook for 10 minutes. Finally, take the cookies out of the oven and place on a cooling rack. Allow your easy chocolate chip cookies to cool and then enjoy!"

      "Flip the meringue over, seasoned side down, onto a clean tea towel and remove the baking paper carefully; if it sticks, place a wet towel which has been heated in a microwave (or soaked with really hot water) on to the baking paper for 30 seconds; try peeling the paper away again and it should come away cleanly. Spread the wattleseed cream evenly over the meringue to a thickness of around 1cm or 1/2 an inch. Roll up the pavlova using the long edge of the towel; cut the ends on an angle. Before removing the towel completely, lift the pavlova onto a platter and roll the pavlova off the towel.",

      "**By hand or mixer: Place 2 cups of flour, dry milk, yeast and salt in the mixing bowl. Pour in the hot water and add the shortening. With the mixer, beat for 2 minutes, medium speed, or beat 150 strong strokes by hand with a wooden spoon. Stir in remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time, until a rough mass is formed.",
      "**By processor: Attach plastic dough blade, place 3 cups flour in the work bowl, and add dry milk, yeast, salt and shortening. our in hot water. Pulse 3 or 4 times, until well blended. Add additional flour 1/4 cup at a time, until dough is no longer wet, but still soft and slightly sticky. Process until dough forms a ball, and cleans sides of bowl. Let the dough knead for an additional 50 seconds.",

Flatten dough, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup of the sugar mixture, fold dough over, and continue kneading. hen cubes have disappeared into the dough, add another 1/4 cup. Again work sugar in with a kneading motion. Repeat with remaining cubes. Knead for 8 minutes. The dough will take on the cinnamon color; that's fine. If the cubes poke out, push them back in, and lightly flour if the dough becomes sticky from sugar.",

      "**Shaping: Turn the dough onto the work surface and divide with a sharp knife. Cut edges will expose sugar pockets. Carefully close these pockets, pinching seams tightly. Shape the pieces into balls, and let them rest for 3-4 minutes. Form a loaf by pressing or rolling each into an oval, about the length of the pan. Fold oval in half, pinch seam to seal, tuck under the ends, and place in the pan, seam down. Repeat with second loaf.",

Reduce heat to 350 degrees, and bake for an additional 40 minutes. Midway through baking, shift the bread to expose the loaves evenly to oven shifts. Carefully turn pans on their sides on a cooling rack. Tug gently on the paper lining, loosening the breads and pull them out. Allow to cool before serving."

      "To Make The Dough (The following directions are for those of you who don't have a bread maker) (If you do have a bread maker follow its directions using the ingredients listed):",
      "Preheat the oven to the lowest setting possible- only warm. Dissolve the yeast in the water and set aside for approx 5 minutes. Do not use water that is hotter than 120 degrees F because it will kill your yeast. Use hot sink water. In about five minutes there will be a little froth on the bowl of yeast. This shows that it is working. (Note: Check the expiration date on your yeast before you use it).",
      "Get out a big mixing bowl, and add your flour, salt, and sugar. Mix well and make a little well in the center. Slowly add your yeast water mix in the well and mix in the flour with a spoon. Mix well. The dough will be sticky. Do not over mix- this will ruin your dough. Make a dough ball and leave in the bowl.",
      "Get out 2 sheets of foil and lay them out on your counter. Sprinkle a little flour on the foil, and then place your dough ball in the center. Lightly oil your hands and then start kneading for a couple minutes.",
      "Get out another bowl and lightly oil the bowl just to coat. Place your dough ball in the bowl and turn once to coat the dough with the oil. Secure airtight with plastic wrap. Place in the oven just to warm.",
      "Let sit for 2 hours in the oven to rise. A warm oven is extremely important. Room temperature will not rise your dough properly.",
      "After 2 hours punch the dough down and separate it into two pieces. Form 2 nice balls. (If you are not making the pizza this same day than you can stick it in the refrigerator covered and sealed for only 1 day. ) (Then let it rise when you are ready to make it in a warm oven for 2 hours).",
      "If you are making it the same day than place one ball back in the same bowl, and get out another bowl and lightly coat it with olive oil. Seal both very well with plastic wrap- air tight. Place back in the oven to warm for another 1 1/2 hours.",
      "After your time has passed- than you take your dough balls and roll them one by one into a 9 inch pizza. 1/2 inch thick.",
      "Heat your oven to 350.",
      "At this point you are ready to dress your pizza. The original recipe calls for you to bake your pizza on a pizza stone. If you decide to use a pizza stone you need to heat it in the oven for one hour to get nice and hot before use.",
      "Roasted Garlic Paste.",
      "First preheat the oven to 325 degrees F.",
      "In a small bowl add the garlic with the olive oil and mix well. Spread on the bottom of a baking pan and roast approx 30 minutes until browned. After the time has passed stir the garlic well and cook another 12 minutes. Let this cool to the touch and add it to a food processor along with the water and mix till it looks like a fine peanut butter. This makes about 1/4 cup.",
      "Garlic Shallot Butter with Lemon.",
      "Turn your burner on medium and add your 1 Tablespoon of butter to the pan. Next add the minced garlic, thyme, and minced shallots. Continue to cook till the onions start to turn brown. Turn your burner to high heat, and add the sprinkle of white pepper, fresh lemon juice, chicken cube, and wine. Continue to stir , and cook until the mixture is reduced. Once it is reduced add your remainder 2 Tablespoons of butter, and keep on low until your pizza is ready. If you are making this pizza later- than place in an airtight container and keep refrigerated until ready to use.",
      "Assembling your pizza.",
      "Now is the easy part. All we do is assemble the pizza.",
      "Your oven needs to be preheating now if it is not already. Your dough should be rolled out and ready for the topping.",
      "First place a thin layer of the garlic paste on your 9 inch pizza. Sprinkle your mozzarella cheese on the pizza. Then with a slotted spoon, scoop your onions on the pizza.",
      "Next you want to add your shredded chicken to the pizza, Romano cheese, and sprinkle parsley on the pizza. Place your pizza in the middle rack of the oven.( If you are using the pizza stone, you want to transfer the pizza over to the warm stone to bake).",
      "You want to bake the pizza till the crust is crisp and the cheese is melted. This takes approx 8 minutes.",
      "Repeat the same steps for the second pizza.",
      "Variations of Pizza.",
      "With your Homemade pizza crust- you can make many different pizza's.",
      "The recipe for the California Garlic paste is above. Any other pizza that you decide to make whether it be the pepperoni and cheese, or the sausage and mushroom- spread a layer of this paste over the bottom of the crust before you put on your pizza sauce. It gives the pizza a phenomenal taste.",
      "I will note- we do make several pizza's and freeze them. You want to bake the prepared pizza just for a couple minutes to pre-cook it, not all the way. This way when you do cook it later- it will taste just like the original day you made them. If you make 9 inch pizza's a large freezer bag fits the pizza perfect."
