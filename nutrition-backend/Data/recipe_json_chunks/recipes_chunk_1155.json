      "3 Too salty: Try adding a pinch or brown sugar or a 1/4 teaspoon vinegar.",
      "4 Use flours that are low in protein and high in starch, such as cake flour, pastry flour or all-purpose flour. This will help prevent any \"skin\" from forming on gravy as it sits.",

      "9 Liquid gravy browner can be added to gravy to improve color.",
      "10 When adding liquid to the roux, add it slowly and whisk constantly to avoid lumping.",
      "11 Whisking in a tablespoon of butter of heavy cream just before serving will give gravy a rich, satiny texture.",
      "12 Adding a teaspoon of instant coffee granules or cocoa per two cups gravy enriches the flavor as well as adds color.",

Spray wire grill rack with vegetable oil and place in drip pan.",
      "Remove chicken from marinade and place skin-side up on grill rack in smoker. Sprinkle with additional kosher salt and paprika.",
      "Place smoker over stove-top burners as evenly as possible and offset lid so it is not tightly closed. Turn burner heat to high. When wisps of smoke begin to come through the opening, re-position the lid so it is tightly closed and turn heat to medium-low. Cook about 45 minutes to 1 hour, depending on the thickness of the chicken breasts, until center tests 180\u00b0F with an instant-read thermometer.",
      "If you are serving the chicken with the skin on, you may wish to place the chicken under the broiler for browning.

Let rest up to 10 minutes before serving.",

      "Notes: This recipe is designed to be used with an indoor smoker. Adapt at will. The wood chips are specially designed for indoor cookers. They are like roughly-ground sawdust, not the large The wood chips used on traditional outdoor smokers. Seldom are more than 1-1/2 tablespoons of chips used. Follow manufacturer's recommendations.",

      "If you are following a low-fat diet, simply remove the skin from the chicken after cooking, but do leave them on during the smoking process to help retain moisture."

Use a knife to cut slits of the top side(fat side) of the meat. Make the cuts just big enough to stuff the garlic cloves all around. Ideally, let the roast marinate uncovered overnight in the fridge.

      "**I used Bosina Robiola, which is a lightly aged sheep's milk cheese from the south Piedmont region of Italy, that comes in about 3/4\"x4\"x4\" squares.",
      "Other varieties, all from northern Italy, may be made from cow, sheep or goat milk and may have a thicker round shape like a small Brie or a cube shape.",
      "All of the aged Robiola cheeses tend to have a creamy yellow interior and have a white, yellowish, or pinkish rind.",
      "If you can't find Robiola, feel free to use an aged Brie or Camembert cheese, including part of the crust, or Stracchino (ripened version of Taleggio) or Bel Paese or Fontina.",
      "The flavors are fairly similar.",
      "The main thing is that you want a fairly pungent cheese.",
      "Pound each pieces of meat between pieces of plastic wrap until about 1/8\" thick, being careful not to tear it any more than necessary.",
      "It helps to sprinkle the meat with a little water before placing between plastic sheets.",

      "Sprinkle generously with balsamic vinegar, rub in spice, and marinate at room temperature for 1/2 hour or in the refrigerator for several hours.",
      "When ready to stuff meat rolls, cut chilled cheese into batons about 3/4\" square and 3\" long, making sure you get some of the rind with each piece, reserving any leftover cheese for the sauce.",
      "Wrap each piece of cheese with sage leaves, and with optional prosciuto, if desired, to minimize leaks later on.",
      "Place a wrapped piece of cheese on each piece of meat, and roll the meat around the cheese bundles, folding in the ends as you go.",

      "Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer for about 20 minutes to infuse flavors.",
      "Add remaining Robiola cheese scraps, including rind, and simmer about 5 minutes longer or until cheese has melted, strain cream mixture, pressing on solids to get out as much liquid and soft solids as possible, and set aside.",
      "Heat about 1/4 cup of olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat, saute meat rolls until well browned on all sides, and set them aside.",
      "Discard oil, except for about 2 Tbsp, and saute remaining onions and garlic until onions are just beginning to brown around the edges.",
      "Add mushrooms, increase heat to high, and season to taste with salt and pepper.",

      "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.",
      "In a pot, boil some water; blanch the slices of salt pork by immersing them in the boiling water for 2 to 3 minutes, then rinse them in cold water to halt the cooking and pat them dry.",

      "Take 3/4 of the cooked onions and set aside for stuffing; take the remaining cooked onions and set them aside for the sauce.",
      "Using 1 tablespoon of olive oil, in a small pan over medium heat lightly brown the carrot and thinly sliced onion, about 5 minutes.",
      "In a mixing bowl, combine the ground cooked turkey, sausage, eggs, cloves, salt, pepper, thyme, allspice, and the cooked onions reserved for the stuffing, and mix well; add 5 tablespoons (or more, to moisten enough so that the stuffing will adhere to cabbage leaves- see steps below) of the stock and mix.",
      "Take the large oven-safe round-bottomed bowl and line the bottom of it with half of the blanched salt pork strips, then lay half of the sliced carrots and onions on top.",

      "Spread a layer of the stuffing mixture, about 1/2-inch thick, on the bottom and sides of the bowl (which are now covered with the cabbage leaves), then press some smaller cabbage leaves on top of the stuffing.",
      "Repeat the process until the bowl is filled to within 1/2-inch of the top, occasionally slipping a large green leaf down the sides of the bowl, if necessary, to be sure that no gaps appear between the leaves.",
      "Cover with a final layer of cabbage leaves and the remaining pork and carrot/onion mixture, then pour in enough beef stock to come within 1 inch of the bowl rim.",
      "Place the bowl on a pan (to catch drippings) and place in the lower-middle section of the preheated oven; cook for 30 minutes- the cabbage should simmer.",
      "Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F and continue to bake for 1 1/2 to 2 hours; it is done when you place a thermometer into the thickest part of the bowl and the temperature reads 165 degrees F.",
      "Check it occasionally as it bakes- you want to keep the cabbage at a slow simmer, and you might need to add additional stock if too much evaporates.",
      "When the cabbage is almost done and there's only about 15 minutes left for it to bake, prepare the sauce: over medium heat in a saucepan, stir together the tomato and the remaining cooked minced onion, and simmer for 10 minutes.",
      "Remove the cabbage from the oven, remove the pork, carrot, and onion from the top layer, and drain off 1 cup of the liquid from the bowl; add the liquid to the tomato mixture and simmer an additional 5 minutes.",
