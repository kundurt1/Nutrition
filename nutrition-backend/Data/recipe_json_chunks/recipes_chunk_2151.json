      "On the grate above, I load up with chiles, with the exception of the area right over the fire.",
      "I let these smoke as long as my patience holds out (maybe 4-5 hrs), occasionally turning the chiles and tossing a little water on the glowing wood (want it to keep the works smoking).",

      "Slowly simmer this mix for about 3 hrs, stirring occasionally.",
      "Somewhere in the middle of this stewing process, put in the chipotles to rehydrate.",
      "By the end, they should be nice and plump, with their smoky flavor well mixed with the sauce.",
