    "directions": [
      "Preparation will take at least one hour. Start by shucking the shrimp and placing rinsing them. Place in separate bowl and put into refrigerator. In a separate bowl pick through premium crab meat with fingers, removing any shells or cartilage. One medium heat, add tomato juice, crab stock, diced tomatoes, onion, green peppers, carrots, celery, garlic, basil, black pepper, oregano, and dry sherry to a large stew pot and cover for at least 45 minutes, until vegetables are tender. Stir occasionally. Add Old Bay. Add 2 dashes of pepper sauce at a time to desired bite. Remember that the soup will have a \"hot heat\" taste to it before you add the rest of the ingredients. You may add more Old Bay for your desired consistency. Continuing on this medium heat and add the shrimp and almost all of the crabmeat, remembering to leave at least 6 pinches for the garnish. In a blender, use a low setting (chop, stir) to blend all of the ingredients into a smooth texture. I prefer hitting the setting just below puree, but this can make the simmer time on the vegetables a little longer. Place the bisque into a smaller saucepan, and place on low heat. Add the heavy cream. When the bisque begins to boil, remove from heat and serve immediately. Place bowls on serving plates after ladling soup. Crumble crab directly into the center of the bisque and sprinkle with flaked basil leaves. Garnish with a single fresh basil leaf. Serve with warm French bread, or long rolls to dip with. Enjoy!"

Continue to simmer until mushrooms are just turning pale yellow. Add 2 cups of canned diced tomatoes. Raise temp to medium and simmer until most of the liquid evaporates. Take care in this part so as not to dry out mixture or burn mushrooms. Toss in 1/2 medium size yellow squash, sliced, 1/2 orange bell pepper, sliced, one bunch of asparagus cut in 1 inch length pieces using only the top 2/3 of the stalks, approximately 12-16 broccoli florettes, nickle size, 12-16 snap peas with just the little ends cut off. Reduce heat to simmer for no more than 10 minutes. At this point put the linguini into the boiling water and cook until al dente. When all is ready, put a serving of pasta in each pasta bowl and top with the simmered vege mix. Season with salt and pepper at table as desired by each person and serve shredded parmesan cheese to top the presentation. French bread and butter and wine completes this meal.

Remove from the fridge, and beat at high speed with an electric mixer until it lightens in color and thickens slightly. If the filling doesn't lighten and thicken after several minutes of beating, chill for another 15 minutes, then beat again. Spread a generous amount of filling on one of the flat sides of the cookies; sandwich another half on top to form your pie. Repeat with the remaining pies. Store in an airtight container--it's better not to freeze these. Because the tops of the whoopie pies can be sticky, I'd suggest individually wrapping in waxed paper rather than plastic wrap."
