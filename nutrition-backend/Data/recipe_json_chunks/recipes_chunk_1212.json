      "\tUse the cooking time indicated on the package as a guideline, but taste it to determine if it is \"al dente\". A whitish lining on the inside of the pasta means that it has not cooked enough. After the white lining disappears, it is the right texture and is ready to serve. Drain immediately, but do not rinse, pour pasta into the sauce and mix thoroughly over the heat.",
      "\tSprinkle with good quality, freshly grated cheese.",

      "Note -- The difficulty of cutting through the shoulder bones will depend on the age of the chicken. Fryers are easy, stew hens more difficult. If you're cutting a turkey you'll need to break the joint.",
      "Use the knife to divide the breast lengthwise into thirds. Cut the meat down to but not through the bones.",
      "Cut the breast bones with the shears.",
      "Note -- for a large roaster, or stew hen you may wish to halve each of these pieces crosswise to yield a total of 6 pieces of white meat.",
      "Alternately, if you want the breast divided in half you can use the knife to cut the skin exactly down the center then slide it down on one side of the breastbone. Complete the cut with the shears. Sometimes, depending upon the intended use, its even desirable to slide the knife along both sides of the breastbone and then use the shears to cut it out completely.",
      "The chicken is now ready to use for whatever purpose you wanted chicken parts.",
      "If you wish to bone the breasts, its now easy to see where you need to slide a thin, razor-sharp knife to free the meat.",
      "Note -- gather the trimmings, including the fat, and save in the freezer until you have enough for chicken stock. (Recipe #219819 requires trimmings from only 2-3 chickens).",
      "Tip -- It's easier to skin the chicken if you grab the slippery skin with a damp dishcloth.",
      "Tip -- If there are pinfeathers I find that a grill lighter makes the best tool to singe them off.",
      "Tip -- If there are broken feathers too large to singe, a pair of washed, needlenose pliers gets a better grip than tweezers. They are inexpensive so you can keep a pair in your utensil drawer just for this purpose."

      "When you've got your lamb off the bone and are faced with a large slab of meat, you'll want to do a little more trimming to get it ready for the grill. Go ahead and remove the excess fat and any remaining membranes that you see.",
      "Cut the lamb up so that each chunk you cut off is uniform in size. Some pieces will be thicker than others, but that's perfectly fine. This way you can just pull each piece off the grill individually as they reach your desired doneness.",
      "Now that your meat is trimmed and ready to go it's time to mix up the marinade.",
      "Start by adding the olive oil, lemon juice, red wine vinegar, rosemary, oregano, salt, pepper, and garlic to a mixing bowl and whisk together.",
      "When it's thoroughly mixed, add it to a large zip top bag or shallow baking dish and add the lamb.",
      "Make sure you toss the meat around so the marinade covers everything and then let it sit in the refrigerator for at least an hour. Longer is better in this case, so if you can prepare this three or four hours in advance, that's great. Even overnight is fine if you're pressed for time. If you do marinade it for a longer period of time just be sure to occasionally toss or turn the pieces of meat to make sure they are staying well-covered by the marinade.",
      "After the meat has marinaded for your desired time, pull it out of the fridge at least 30 minutes prior to cooking to allow it to come up closer to room temperature.",
      "While your meat is resting you can go ahead and get the grill started. Gas or charcoal, doesn't matter. Use what you're comfortable with and what you have.",
      "Bring the grill up to a medium heat and begin cooking the lamb. If you have a few pieces that are much thicker than the rest, add those first and let them cook for a couple of minutes before adding the rest so that way most of the meat should get done at around the same time. Turn frequently. Continue cooking until the meat reaches around 120-125 degrees for medium-rare, or about 130 degrees for medium. When you pull the meat from the grill at these temperatures and let it rest, the meat will continue to cook and increase at least another five degrees.",
      "This is where having a good meat thermometer comes in handy, but if you don't have one and you're familiar with cooking steaks and testing their doneness, you can use the same method here.",
      "Once the meat has rested for about 10 minutes, slice bite-sized pieces, against the grain where possible and dump all of the meat into a large serving bowl. If you'd like, you can add a drizzle of olive oil and a little salt and pepper to the bowl and toss to coat to give it a little finishing touch.",
      "Finally, take your pieces of pita bread and throw them on the grill, still at medium heat, and let them warm up. We're not looking to get the bread crunchy or anything, but just want to toast it lightly and warm it throughout. It should take just 30-60 seconds.",
      "Instructions for Tzatziki Sauce:",
      "Start by peeling two medium cucumbers and cut in half lengthwise.",
      "Take a spoon and scoop out the seeds, then give them a rough chop. Once chopped, put the cucumber into a colander or strainer in the sink and sprinkle the kosher salt on top and toss to coat. This step is important because the salt will draw out some of the excess moisture that would otherwise make your tzatziki very thin in consistency. Let the salted cucumber sit for 30-60 minutes.",
      "For making the sauce a food processor can come in handy, but you can just use a grater to grate the cucumber into small pieces and then chop the herbs and garlic very fine by hand.",
      "If you have a food processor, add the cucumber, garlic, and dill to the processor and pulse to puree.",
      "Add the mixture to a bowl and then add the yogurt and lemon juice and fold to incorporate everything. Let it sit in the refrigerator for at least a few hours, but overnight is best. Enjoy!"

You can buy the hunk of rib eye and freeze and slice it yourself, but the butcher generally does a better job than I do. I can only get it about 1/8\" thick and he does about.",

Squishy sub rolls will NOT do. They do not hold together under pressure. Refrain from buying those \"hero\" rolls too. A good hoagie roll is almost rubbery in texture, but quite soft. The best substitute I have found is a loaf of French bread. Not as good as the real thing, but hey, beggars can't be choosers.",

I double the recipe in order to have enough to feed my bunch. If you don't have self rising flour you can make it by adding 1 teaspoon baking powder & 1/4 teaspoons salt to every cup of all purpose flour used in your recipe.

      "Increase the heat to high and add the meat a third at a time, stirring and breaking lumps with a spoon between each addition. Adding the meat gradually allows the water to evaporate - which is key if you want to brown your meat and not boil it. After the last addition, when no pink can be spotted in the meat and no lumps remain, set a timer to 15 minutes. You want your meat to caramelize and even become crispy in spots. More water will evaporate and flavors will concentrate. You want golden bits of meat to stick to the bottom of your pan - this flavorful crust will then be deglazed with white wine. Watch over your pan as you don't want your meat to burn. When you see some serious caramelization action happening, lower heat to medium to reach the end of your 15-minute sauteing time (on my stove, that's after about 8-9 minutes).",
      "Over medium heat, pour the white wine into the sauce pan. With a wooden spoon, scrape all the brown bits stuck to the bottom of your pan. Push the meat all around to make sure you scrape it all off. By the time you're finished, the wine will be evaporated (2-3 minutes). Be careful not to let the meat stick again (lower the heat if necessary).",
      "Add milk, diced tomatoes (with liquid), beef stock, 1 teaspoon salt and a good grinding of pepper. Bring to a boil and then lower to the lowest heat and let simmer very slowly, half-covered, for 4 hours. Stir once in a while. If your sauce starts sticking before the end of your cooking time, lower the heat (if possible) and/or add a bit of stock or water. In the end, the sauce should be thick, more oil- than water-based and thick like oatmeal. Adjust the seasoning one last time - don't be afraid of adding more salt (tasting each time you add some), it is this recipe's key seasoning.",
      "To serve: Reheat the sauce. Mix in a knob or two of butter and about two generous tablespoons of freshly grated parmigiano-reggiano per serving - these last additions will produce an incredibly creamy flavor. Drain your pasta very well and return to the pot. Spoon some sauce, just enough to coat the pasta. Serve in bowls with a few leaves of basil sprinkled on top and more freshly grated parmigiano-reggiano, to taste."
