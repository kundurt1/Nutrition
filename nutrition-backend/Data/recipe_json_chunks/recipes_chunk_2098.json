      "Keeping your right hand steady, slowly rotate the artichoke with your left hand so the bottom moves in a clockwise direction, and cut upward in a spiral.",

      "Peel the green layer off the bottom and stem, and then drop the trimmed artichoke into the lemon juice until you are ready to cook.",
      "This operation requires some practice; you will know if you have mastered this technique when the artichoke thus cleaned looks more or less like the one you started with, only smaller and whiter.",
      "If you are not ready to use the artichokes immediately after you have cleaned them, try to keep them completely submerged in lemon water.",
      "This is not easy.",
      "Artichokes are very buoyant and float to the surface making it difficult to keep them covered.",
      "An inverted plate, just a bit smaller in diameter than the bowl, place over the artichokes, will keep them below the surface.",
      "Another way is to crowd them inside a glass jar and cover them with the lemon water.",
      "If you plan to leave them at this stage for more than a hour or so, you must refrigerate them, but it is not advisable to keep artichokes this way for more than a few hours.",
      "Lemon is used to prevent discoloration; on the other hand, the lemon will cause the artichokes to spoil very quickly."

      "Heat over medium heat until the shallot sizzles.",
      "Continue to fry for 4 to 5 minutes, frequently swirling the pan to evenly cook, until most of the shallot is golden brown.",

      "If the dough sticks to your hand, work in glutinous rice flour, 1 teaspoon at a time.",
      "Now, use the Glutinous Rice Dough: Mother Dough Method instructions (below) to create malleable, elastic dough.",
      "Cut the finished dough into 2 pieces.",

      "Cut it into 6 even-size pieces, taking care to make the tapered end pieces a little longer than the others.",

      "Pinch and twist off excess dough.",
      "Roll the dumpling between your hands to create a smooth ball.",

      "Set on your work surface and repeat with the remaining pieces of dough and filling.",
      "Once a batch of dumplings is assembled, add it to the boiling water.",
      "Gently shake the pan or nudge the dumplings to prevent them from sticking.",
      "When a dumpling floats to the surface, after about 3 minutes, use a slotted spoon to transfer it to the bowl of cold water to cool and set; the dumplings will lose their fuzzy appearance once they are in the water.",

      "(With the dough left over from pinching off the excess, you can make 1/4-inch balls and poach those as an unfilled addition, if you like.)",
      "Return the broth to a simmer.",
      "Remove the dumplings from the water and add to the ginger broth.",
      "Let the dumplings sit in the broth for 5 to 7 minutes, turning them midway, to reheat and allow the dumplings to absorb the flavors.",
      "Avoid boiling, as that forms little bubbles on the dough surface.",
      "Turn off the heat and set aside for about 10 minutes to cool.",

      "Doughs made from glutinous (sweet) rice flour are notoriously hard to manage because they can be dry, fall apart, and sag.",
      "They do not yield easily to your will.",
      "I have tried a number of techniques over the years, including combining flours and using just-boiled water, but this one, which I call the mother dough method, works very well for dumplings that are poached.",
      "This method calls for precooking a small portion of dough and then kneading it back into the raw dough to introduce enough elasticity to tame the dough.",
      "The instructions below take off from where you have made the dough from combining the rice flour and water.",
      "Remember to return the saucepan of water to a boil before proceeding.",
      "To make the mother dough, pinch off a bit of the prepared dough, about 3/4 inch in diameter.",
      "Roll it into a ball, then flatten it into a 1/4-inch-thick disk.",
      "Drop the disk into the boiling water.",
      "After the dough rises to the top and floats horizontally, 1 to 2 minutes, let the dough cook for a further 15 seconds.",
      "Meanwhile, dust your work surface with 1 tablespoon of glutinous rice flour.",
      "Take the raw dough and flatten it into a 4-inch disk, about 3/4 inch thick.",
      "When the mother dough is done, use a slotted spoon to lift the dough from the water, giving it a gentle shake to remove excess water.",
      "Set the spoon aside for about 15 seconds to slightly cool the dough.",
      "Center the small cooked mother dough atop the big raw disk.",
      "Fold in the sides of the dough to enclose and start kneading, using the heel of your hand to push the raw and cooked dough together.",
      "Add extra glutinous rice flour as needed to prevent sticking; use a dough scraper if the dough is unwieldy.",
      "After kneading for about 2 minutes, both doughs should be well combined.",
      "What was initially stiff dough should now be supple, malleable, and slightly tacky like Play-Doh.",
      "Cut the finished dough into the number of pieces required by the recipe and cover with plastic wrap to prevent drying.",
      "The dough may sit at room temperature for up to 2 hours.",
      "If you are assembling the dumplings soon, lower the heat on the boiling water and cover to keep hot.",
      "Otherwise, turn off the heat on the water."
