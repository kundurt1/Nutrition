Cover bowl tightly with lightly oiled plastic wrap and let dough rise in a warm, draft-free place until tripled in size and bubbly, about 6-8 hours. (You can leave it sitting out for up to 12 hours). After rising, punch it down, then cover it and place it in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Or you can make it now.",
      "Remove the biga from the refrigerator about 1 hour before you mix together the dough.",
      "For the dough:",
      "In the bowl of a stand mixer, whisk together flour and yeast. Whisk in the salt. Add water and biga. Using the paddle attachment, mix everything together on low speed (#2 on the stand mixer) just until the flour is moistened. Then, increase speed to medium-high (#6 on the stand mixer) and beat 3 minutes until dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl. Decrease speed to medium (#4 on the stand mixer) and beat another 2 minutes. The dough should be fairly wet but hold together in one long strand when you pull it with the paddle attachment.",
      "Using an oiled spatula, transfer the dough into a large, lightly oiled bowl. Cover with lightly oiled plastic wrap and let it rise in a warm, draft-free place until tripled, about 1 1/2 to 2 hours.",
      "When dough is risen, generously sprinkle a countertop with flour. Using an oiled spatula, transfer the dough to the floured surface and sprinkle top of dough with flour. Use your palms to pat the sides of the dough inward to push it together slightly. Using four of your fingertips, make deep dimples in the top of the dough about 1 inch apart. Push the sides together again slightly.",
      "Carefully transfer and invert the dough onto a parchment paper or Silpat-lined baking sheet. Use your palms again to shape the dough so that it is approximately 4 1/2 inches wide, 10 to 11 inches long and 1 inch tall. Sprinkle top with more flour, then cover it lightly with plastic wrap or a tea towel and let it rise in a warm, draft-free place until about 1 1/2 inches tall, about 1 1/2 to 2 hours.",
      "About 30 minutes before baking, prep oven. Place an oven rack on the lowest level and another one just above it. Place a cast-iron skillet on the lower rack and a baking sheet on the upper rack. Heat oven to 475 F.",
      "When dough is risen, remove plastic wrap or tea towel and gently place the baking sheet on top of the baking sheet in the oven. Pour 1/2 cup of ice cubes into the cast-iron skillet and close the door quickly. Bake loaf at 475 F for 5 minutes, then decrease oven temperature to 450 F and bake another 20 minutes, or until loaf is a deep golden brown. When loaf is done, turn off oven and prop door open slightly, leaving the loaf in the oven for 5 more minutes.",
      "Remove the loaf from the oven and transfer to a cooling rack to cool completely before slicing.",

      "For the cookies:",
      "In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, combine the ground nuts, rice flour, butter, salt, and sugar until it forms into a dough. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and put it into the refrigerator to chill for about an hour.",
      "Roll marble-size balls of dough about 3/4-inch wide (5 grams for those of us who have \"Baking OCD\") and place on a parchment or silicone lined sheet pan about an inch and a half apart. Return pan to the refrigerator to keep the dough chilled until it's time to bake.",
      "Preheat oven to 325 F. Bake chilled dough for 8-12 minutes; until the cookies are crisp but tender (they won't chance color, but a few tiny cracks will be visible around the edges). Remove pan from oven and set it on a rack and allow cookies to cool completely on sheet pan.",
      "To assemble the cookies:",
      "Gently melt the chocolate in a microwave or in the top of a double boiler. Place a small dollop of chocolate between two cookie halves; set aside until chocolate sets. Cookies can be stored in an airtight container for up to a week.",
      "Notes:",
      "- To make rice flour: Pulse uncooked white rice in a spice mill or coffee grinder until very finely ground.",
      "- To blanch and peel hazelnuts: Bring 2 cups of water to a boil in a 4-quart sauce pan (you need a large pan because the water and baking soda will bubble up a lot). Add baking soda to boiling water; add hazelnuts and boil for 3 full minutes (don't be alarmed when the water turns black; this is to be expected). In the meantime, have ready a bowl of iced water. After 3 minutes, remove hazelnuts from boiling water and plunge them into the iced water to stop the cooking process. Slip hazelnuts out of their skins and allow to dry. Toast hazelnuts in a 350 F oven for 10-15 minutes. Cool completely and pulse in a food processor until finely ground (should resemble dry cornmeal or polenta).",

There was some serious wailing and gnashing of teeth in my kitchen once. It was only because I had really talked this pie up to my Mom and was trying to pull off this fabulous dessert and showcase my grand culinary skills and it ended up being the ugliest pie I ever made. My mother was very gracious in trying to repair my damaged ego and told me how good it was despite the way it looked. So you HAVE to let the chocolate cool.",

On medium speed, add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Add the vanilla and mix to combine.

When done, the cake will be golden brown and a thin knife or skewer inserted in center will be clean.",

    "ingredients": [],

      "Preheat oven to 350 F.",
      "For the crust:",
      "1. In a food processor pulse the graham crackers, butter and a 1/4 cup of sugar.",
      "2. Blitz until the consistency is of wet sand.",
      "3. Empty the crumbs into a 9 or 10 inch springform pan and compact it down until it evenly coats the pan. The crust should only coat the bottom of the pan and not rise up the side. This allows for a separation of layers in the cheesecake and a much better presentation.",
      "4. Put in oven to bake for 20 minutes.",
      "5. When done remove it from the oven and let it cool separately.",
      "For the filling:",
      "1. In the bowl of a stand mixer, add the following ingredients: cream cheese, eggs, flour, sour cream, sugar, Irish cream, vanilla extract, lemon zest and salt.",
      "2. Mix for about a minute or so or until the mixture is rich and creamy. (Careful not to mix too much as that will incorporate air into the batter and cause cracks).",
      "3. Once mixed, empty the mixture into the crust and smooth out the top of the cake.",
      "4. Put the pan into the oven for about 1 hour and 20 minutes to cook. (Tip: Toward the last 10 minutes of the cooking period, keep the oven door open and let it cook naturally in the oven).",
      "5. Remove the pan from the oven and set it on a rack to cool for 30 minutes and then put it in the fridge for about 3-4 hours to set completely.",
      "For the compote:",
      "1. Heat a saute pan over medium heat and add 1/2 cup sugar in it and allow it to melt until it's clear. If it starts to burn, take it off the heat and stir.",
      "2. Add 3/4 cups of fresh raspberries, a tablespoon of raspberry preserves and a tablespoon of a deep red wine. A Merlot or red Moscato is preferred.",
      "3. Cook until the wine has evaporated and the raspberries are crushed down to a smooth consistency. Add corn flour to the mix and take it off the heat when it reaches your desired consistency. If you want to run it through a strainer to get the seeds out, you can; but I like the seeds in my compote.",
      "(If the compote gets too think, simply add more preserve and wine and cook again)",
      "To serve:",
      "Make a pool of the compote on a dessert dish and serve a slice of the cake on top. Enjoy!"

Spread filling evenly across the dough, leaving a half-inch border on all sides. Carefully roll up the dough along the one of the long sides to form a long, narrow log. Cut the log into 3/4\" segments using a sharp serrated knife, which should yield 32-36 pieces.",

Place the saucepan on the stove and bring to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring until the sugar has dissolved. As soon as it comes to a boil, lower the heat to medium-low and allow it to simmer for about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside to cool completely.",
      "For the filling:",
      "In a large bowl, combine the walnuts, almonds, pistachios and cinnamon. Mix with a heavy wooden spoon until all is combined. Set aside.",

      "Preheat your oven to 350 F and spray a 9x13 inch oven safe baking dish with non-stick baking spray.",
      "Unroll your phyllo dough out onto a cutting board and trim the dough to 9x13in sheets (so that it fits snugly into the baking dish). Discard the scraps. Lay one sheet of phyllo dough into the baking dish, and brush the top with melted butter. Lay another sheet on top of the other buttered sheet and butter the top of that one as well. Continue this process for 6 more sheets, continuously buttering each individual sheet.",
      "Take about half of your nut mixture and spread gently on top of the 8 sheets of buttered phyllo dough. Place another phyllo sheet on top of the nut mixture and again brush with butter. Continue this phyllo buttering process, again, for 7 more sheets. Now, spread the rest of the nut mixture gently on top of the second set of phyllo sheets.",
      "Place yet another phyllo sheet on top of the second layer of nut mixture and butter the top. Continue this step for the rest of the phyllo sheets (should be roughly 7 more). You will have used 24 sheets of phyllo dough by this stage. Press down gently on the final sheet so that the baklava compresses just a tad, then generously slather the remaining sheet with butter. Place the dish in the fridge for about 5-10 minutes.",
      "Once the 5-10 minutes has passed, remove the dish from the fridge and gently score the top of the baklava to create a diamond shape with a very sharp paring knife. To do this, score the pastry parallel to the 9 inch side of the baking sheet in 11/2 inch sections. Then create another series of score lines at a 45 degrees angle to the parallel lines. You will have created a diamond shape by doing this.",
      "Bake the baklava, uncovered at 350 F for 40 minutes or until the top has browned slightly. Remove from oven and immediately gently drizzle your syrup on top, using all of it. Let it rest for about 11/2 hours and then serve. Drizzle with melted chocolate (optional). Store at room temperature, covered for about a week. Enjoy!"

Place cut-side down on a baking sheet and bake at 400\u00b0F for 30-45 minutes or until squash is easily pierced with a fork. Let cool, then scrape roasted squash into the bowl of a food processor and give it a good whirl to blend it into a puree.

      "While it may seem labor intensive, in order to achieve the perfect texture it really is best to puree the roasted squash separately from the soup base. I usually roast and puree the squash the day before. Trust me when I say, it's worth washing the extra dishes!",
      "For the roasted squash:",
      "Preheat oven to 400\u00b0F. Cut squash into a large dice (approximately 3/4 inch cubes). Toss together with olive oil, salt and pepper. Roast in a shallow baking dish in a single layer for 20 to 30 minutes (uncovered). Roast until the squash is very soft, stirring once. The squash should start getting nice and brown around the edges.",
      "In a blender, or using an immersion blender, combine chicken/vegetable stock with the roasted squash, pureeing on high until smooth. It will resemble baby food. (This mix will seem bland; do not adjust any seasonings until the entire soup is assembled.) Set aside or refrigerate until you are ready to prepare your soup.",
      "For the soup:",

When the bacon is starting to brown and get crispy, add the olive oil and butter (extra fat is needed, we're going to be sauteing a lot of veggies). Add the onions and leeks. When the onions get translucent, add the carrots, celery, apple and bell pepper. Saute for 5 minutes then add the parsley and sage, garlic, and Herbes de Provence. Let the mixture cook for 2 minutes. Then add the white wine and stir to deglaze the pan. Add the chicken/vegetable stock and cover the pot. Allow it to simmer for 15 to 20 minutes, until the carrots are soft.",
      "For the assembly:",
      "If you have an immersion blender, take the soup off of the heat and use the immersion blender to blend the base as smoothly as possible. Add the squash puree and blend well to combine. Be careful-this is hot and an immersion blender can cause a little bit of splatter.",
      "If you're using a regular blender, blend the soup in your blender in small batches. Be careful, this is a very hot liquid. When everything is blended, add the puree back to the pot and combine with the squash puree, stirring well.",
      "Put the pot back on the stove and bring the whole mixture up to a simmer. Add the balsamic vinegar (it sounds weird, but trust me, it works). If you like spicy, add Sriracha or another hot sauce-start with 1/4 teaspoon and add more depending on your preferences. Add salt and pepper to taste.",
      "As you serve, you can swirl a drizzle of heavy cream over the top of the soup in each bowl and sprinkle with chopped chives.",
      "Easily serves 6 with sandwiches or a salad.",
      "Notes:",
      "- This can be turned vegetarian/vegan by using vegetable stock, omitting the bacon and butter, and omitting the cream garnish.",

If you have a cute little cookie cutter (about 1-inch in size) I say go for it. I've included two methods below; one if you're feeling fancy and using a cutter, and another if you just want some cinnamon sugar cookies right away and can't be bothered with cuteness (typically the latter is me)!",
      "If you're using a cookie cutter, first preheat your oven to 375 F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a Silpat and set aside.",
      "Unroll the dough on a lightly floured work surface; the great thing about this is it's already rolled into a perfectly thin piece and so these first cutouts will be really pretty. Using the cookie cutter, cut out as many cookies as you can from the first roll. Place them on the baking sheet. They won't expand too much so you can place them pretty close together. Smush (technical term) the rest of the dough together, roll it out to a similar thinness, and repeat until you don't have any dough left.",
      "In a bowl whisk together the sugar and cinnamon. Brush the cookies with milk and sprinkle evenly with the cinnamon sugar. Bake at 375 F for 10 minutes until they're golden brown. Remove pan from oven and set it on a rack. Let cookies cool slightly before devouring!",
      "If you're using the easy method, first preheat your oven to 375 F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a Silpat and set aside. Unroll the dough and brush the entire surface with the milk. In a bowl whisk together the sugar and cinnamon, then sprinkle evenly with the cinnamon sugar. Using a pizza cutter or a sharp knife cut the dough into 1-inch pieces and place on the baking sheet about an inch apart. Bake at 375 F for 10 minutes until they're golden brown. Let them cool slightly before devouring!"

      "(Makes 3 loaves)",
      "1. First, measure all your dry ingredients into a large mixing bowl. Mix them around so they're well blended. Then add the water (which really does need to be ice cold). Stir it with a spoon until it's fairly uniform. The dough will be very sticky, so I tend to add a little less than the maximum 3 cup amount of water, and if it's too dry, add a little more. Use your KitchenAid paddle mixer to combine it, or your hands-though you will get messy!",
      "2. Once mixed, put a generous quantity of bread flour on the countertop and plop the squishy dough onto it. Then, begin to knead. You'll probably find yourself using quite a bit more flour so that 90% of it doesn't end up on your hands, but try to keep the excess flour to a minimum. Once the dough is smooth and elastic, and still quite sticky (or after 6-8 minutes of hand-kneading), lightly grease another clean mixing bowl and put the dough into it. Cover your bowl with plastic wrap and pop it all into the fridge. Leave it there overnight, but no longer than two days.",
      "3. When you take it out of the fridge, you'll notice that big, beautiful bubbles have formed in the dough. Yum!! Don't do anything to it yet, just set it in a warm place (like a warm oven) and let it rise. Since the dough is cold, it will take quite a bit longer than your average rising time since it first has to warm up. Mine usually rises for a good 3 hours.",
      "4. Once your dough has doubled in size and is smelling all yeasty and glorious, resist your instincts and don't punch it down! Instead, fill a cast iron or sturdy metal baking pan with water, and put it in your oven. We'll put the bread on the lower rack, so it's ok to put the rack with the water on it fairly high in the oven. We want the steam from the evaporating water, as this will make the crust crunchy and beautiful. Preheat to about 475 Fahrenheit, and while the oven preheats, we'll prep the loaves.",
      "5. Personally, I like generously sized wider loaves rather than baguettes with this bread. You can do whatever you like, though. If doing baguettes, you can get about 5 shorter loaves from this recipe; otherwise, divide the dough into three lumps. It will be quite squishy and floppy, and won't hold its shape too well. What we REALLY DON'T want is to squeeze or squash the dough too much. We want to keep those big air bubbles that have formed overnight, so be gentle with it. If you have a holey pizza pan, this is the time to use it. Otherwise a cookie sheet with some cornmeal sprinkled on it will do just fine. I bet a pizza stone would be great too, so use yours if you have one- just put the pizza stone in the oven with a light dusting of cornmeal when you put the water in, and slip the loaves onto it when the oven is ready. Otherwise, gently place the loaves onto your cornmeal sprinkled pan and pop it in the oven.",
      "6. A word about the baking: These loaves will rise a lot, and expand slightly sideways too. I always have to bake them in several rounds- they don't usually fit on a single pan. As the loaves bake (judge the doneness by color), usually 20-30 minutes depending on the size of the loaf, you'll need to use a water spritzer to spray the loaves 4-5 times throughout the baking time. You can find one in the laundry aisle of most stores, near the ironing stuff. The steam from the pan is great, but we need a little extra. Plus, it's fun. Don't be afraid to aim directly at the bread. A word of caution: it is very hot, so be careful as the steam might cloud up on you when you spray. The loaves will become a lovely deep golden or light brown color when they are done. At this point, let them cool slightly if you can- a true test of your self-control- and then....devour!"

    "title": "ricotta pancakes with strawberry maple syrup",
    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "For the pancakes:",
      "Heat a griddle or frying pan over medium heat Note: for pancakes I always like to use an un-greased non-stick pan, for that consistent all-over browning on the cakes as you see in the pictures. If using a pan that is not non-stick, be sure to butter it, but your pancakes will not look the same as pictured.",
      "In a bowl, stir together the flour, baking powder, and salt. In another bowl, gently whisk together the ricotta, milk, eggs, and lemon zest. Add the wet ingredients to the dry and whisk until smooth and combined.",
      "Using a 1/3 measuring cup, pour batter onto the hot griddle. You can fit multiples onto the griddle but make sure not to crowd it-you'll need to do this in batches. Cook until golden brown underneath, then flip and continue cooking until golden on the other side and cooked through. Remove the cooked pancakes to a plate. Repeat until all the batter is used.",
      "Serve with butter, strawberry maple syrup, and fresh strawberries.",
      "For the syrup:",
      "Add the syrup and strawberries to a small saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a simmer and cook until the strawberries begin to break down and release their juices, about 3 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in the vanilla. At this point you can strain the syrup into a bowl through a fine mesh sieve as I did and serve with fresh strawberry slices, or you can leave the cooked strawberries in the syrup and serve that way, more like a syrup-compote. Serve syrup hot.",
      "Notes:",
      "For even fluffier, lighter-than-air pancakes, separate the eggs and beat the egg whites until stiff, then fold them into the batter at the end.",

      "This is the homemade loaf bread that I make each week for my family. Once you start doing this, it really is nothing to keep it up every week. In fact, it makes things easier at mealtimes and all. Truly.",
      "In your mixer's bowl, pour in the 2.5 cups of warm water. Make it not too hot, but certainly not cold. If it's too hot, then it will kill the yeast, which goes in next. Pour that in. Give it 5 minutes or so to activate and look alive. You will notice it start to change in texture and you may even see some bubbles!",
      "Next pour in just 2 cups of your wheat flour. Turn your mixer on to Speed 2 (this is what my KitchenAid says to make breads at). As it's going, add in the rest of your ingredients, starting with the remaining 4 cups of flour.",
      "Your dough will be looking quite sticky. You want to keep the machine going until it begins to be smooth in appearance and pulls away from the sides of the bowl.",
      "Then you can have fun and get messy. Remember: if you don't make messes in your kitchen, then you're just not having enough fun baking stuff! So...the more messy you get, the better you'll cook. That motto has always worked for me anyway.",
      "Turn your dough onto a slightly floured surface. Please don't add in tons of flour. Honest-to-goodness, you will make the bread WAY too dry that way! A little bit of flour goes a long way. When you first start baking your own breads, you will think that you're not doing this part right and that you need to get the dough as un-sticky as possible. That's just not true. The dough should always be a little sticky...but not TOO sticky. You will learn how to balance this better with practice.",
      "When you knead it for a little while, it will start to smooth out. After you work out a smooth dough, you are ready to pan it. Tuck the ends under and put it 'seam' side down.",
      "Move it to your fancy loaf pan. Now, I have tried a few different types of pans, and my hands-down favorite is this stoneware pan made by Pampered Chef. This is one that my mom let me \"borrow\" years ago and I've had it ever since. The bread simply does not stick to it at all like it does with different metal loaf pans I've used. Plus, it's super easy to clean.",
      "Pat down your dough to try and get it even across the top if you're interested in a more perfect-looking loaf of bread. This makes your sandwiches nicer.",
      "Now it's time to proof! That simply means that you are leaving your dough alone now so it can think about what it needs to do next. Set your timer for 30 minutes and give it some space. You will want to let it rise in a draft-free warm-ish place. I have a double oven and I let mine rise in the top oven and then allow the bottom oven to preheat during that time. Or you could simply put it in the corner of your kitchen somewhere with a flour sack towel draped over it.",
      "Your oven that you are cooking it in should be 350 degrees F.",
      "Pop it in! Set the timer for 45 minutes and walk away.",
      "When the buzzer goes off, check your bread. It's should be a beautiful golden brown color on top and should sound hollow when tapped.",
      "I allow mine to cool in the pan somewhat before attempting removal. If you try to take it out too soon, then it will be so crazy hot that it will rip and fall apart. Been there - done that! It's not a bad thing, per se, but it does make crafting sandwiches a little more tricky.",

This might seem like it's too hard or impossible to do at first, but for me personally - it took me lots of tries until I got the bread the way I liked it (you know, NOT ugly and SUPER tasty!). The more that you practice, the better you will get. So don't give up if your first breads are not what you expected. It gets better each time, I promise!"

Try to keep them close to the same size, but they don't have to be perfect! Place a damp towel over pan and allow to rise about an hour or until it has about doubled in size.",

Stir the mixture occasionally while it bakes, and add more water the the bottom pan if it evaporates during the process. You want the mixture to have a nice brown color.

    "title": "loaded baked potato soup",
    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "* WARNING - please only use Wondra quick-mixing flour for this recipe. If you try to use all-purpose flour for this particular technique then you will get a very lumpy soup! You can find Wondra in a blue container usually in the baking/flour aisle of your grocery store.",
      "Place a large Dutch oven on medium heat. Cut bacon into small pieces and throw in pot and cook until crispy.",
      "Take bacon out of pot and drain on paper towels. Reserve 1 Tablespoon bacon drippings and discard or save the rest for use at another time. Throw in your finely chopped onion and celery and saute for several minutes until onions are clear. Now add garlic and saute for another minute, being careful not to burn garlic. (You may need to turn heat down if it seems to be running too hot).",
      "Stir in 3 Tablespoons of the Wondra flour until the liquid has all been absorbed (for about a minute or two). Add a bit of salt and pepper at this point as well. Gradually add chicken stock. Stir well and bring to a boil.",
      "Now at this point, if you have an immersion blender, I recommend blending all the liquid so you don't have lots of little pieces of onion and celery. Unless, that is how you prefer your soup. I like to make sure my soup is as creamy as possible with the only chunks being the potatoes themselves.",
      "Once thoroughly blended, begin adding milk, heavy cream and cubed potatoes. You can leave the skin on your potatoes if you prefer. At this point, the soup will seem very thin. This is where the magic of Wondra flour comes in. You can create the thickness of soup you prefer without the soup becoming lumpy and pasty. Start adding a bit of Wondra flour to your soup one tablespoon at a time and stir after each addition. (Once again, you may need to adjust your heat settings so you aren't boiling over or running too cold). We like a very thick and hearty soup so I end up adding about 1/2 cup more Wondra flour to my soup. If you end up putting more flour in than you wanted - do not panic. This soup is very forgiving. Just add a little more chicken stock or milk to the pot. Remember, the soup will thicken slightly the longer it simmers. You want the soup to simmer for about 25 minutes until the potatoes are fork tender. Take one out to taste for tenderness before serving.",
      "Once the soup is to your desired consistency. Add 1 cup of cheese to the pot. Let it melt into the soup and stir until combined. Taste for seasoning at this point as well. You may need to add more salt and/or pepper.",
      "Serve. It's great with some crusty French bread. Add toppings such as additional cheese, the crispy bacon you set aside earlier and some diced green onions.",
      "Cook's Note: If your potatoes are on the small side, you may need about 3 or 4 for this recipe. Also, if you have leftover baked potatoes you can certainly cube those up instead and throw them in just before the soup is finished and let them heat through for about 5 minutes or so. I also really enjoying using chicken base to make my chicken broth. I use about 2 teaspoons of chicken base and stir it into 2 cups of warm water."

      "1.\tMeasure the shortening and chill in the refrigerator for at least one hour, or freeze for 20 minutes to get very cold.",

      "5.\tCut the cold butter into pieces, and sprinkle it across the flour. Toss the butter pieces to coat with flour.",
      "6.\tAdd the chilled shortening to the butter bits in the flour. Cut both fats into the flour with a pastry blender, or by criss-crossing two knives until it resembles a coarse cornmeal, with a few larger pieces no bigger than the size of peas.",
      "7.\tMake a well in the center of the flour mixture. Sprinkle the vodka into the well, and toss flour around it with a fork to mix it in evenly. Sprinkle in ice water, 1 tablespoon at a time, tossing with the flour mixture to mix it in. Dough will start to come together, but still appear crumbly. I usually end up needing 2 tablespoons of water, but you can add another tablespoon or two if necessary. You don't want the dough to become too wet, so don't use more than 4 tablespoons of water.",
      "8.\tCover the bowl with a clean towel, and allow it to rest for 10 minutes. The flour will absorb the wet ingredients while it rests.",
      "9.\tTurn dough onto a lightly floured surface. Divide in half, and knead it a bit with your hands to form a ball. Flatten the dough balls into 5-6 inch disks.",
      "10.\tWrap the disks in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes, or up to a week. This allows the butter and shortening to get cold again, and the flour to absorb more of the moisture-both will contribute to the flakiness factor of your pie dough.",
      "11.\tRoll out dough for use in your favorite pie recipes.",
      "NOTE: I've made this dough up to a week in advance, and just let it hang out in the fridge until I needed it. You can also freeze it by putting the wrapped disks into a freezer bag-just take it out of the freezer and let it warm up a bit on the counter-about 30 minutes, before rolling out.",
      "To blind bake (for single crust, un-baked pies): Roll out dough and line a 9-inch pie plate. Fold extra dough under the edge of the plate, and leave as is, or apply a decorative edge with your fingers or a fork. Poke the bottom and sides of the dough with a fork. Line the bottom of the pie shell with foil, and cover foil with dried beans or pie chain. Bake at 400 degrees (F) for 10 minutes. Remove the foil and beans. Return to oven and continue baking until golden brown, about another 20 minutes. Cool and fill with desired filling."

Once cool enough to handle, peel the beets by sliding the skin off with the back of a knife. It should come off quite easily. Roughly chop the beets then puree them in a food processor until smooth.

Bring to a boil and allow to simmer for 10-15 minutes, until the raspberries have broken down. Pour through a mesh strainer into a small bowl and cool completely. This should yield between 3/4 and 1 cup raspberry sauce.",

Most peanut butter ball recipes call for peanut butter, confectioner's sugar, butter, and either Rice Krispies or graham cracker crumbs. I prefer graham cracker crumbs, but both are tasty.",
      "These balls are super-easy! The longest time commitment is waiting for them to firm up in the freezer but I think the results are well worth it. The balls turned out rich and creamy, not too sweet, definitely decadent. The graham crackers add a nice little crunchy change of texture to the fresh Nutella balls as you eat them, although the crunchiness will go away as the graham cracker crumbs have a chance to be moistened by the rest of the filling.",
      "These don't have to be stored in the fridge, although you might want to consider it (or at least chilling them before serving them) to keep the filling firmer. I haven't tried this with peanut butter yet, but I think it should work fine, especially if you are using a typical peanut butter (i.e. not a natural peanut butter) that already has sugar, such as Skippy. There is a second recipe listed in my blog post, my \"original\" recipe that I used to use, which definitely works great for peanut butter, and would probably be the best one to use if you are using any natural nut butters that don't have a lot of added sugar. But for Nutella, I like this recipe best!",

      "4. Add in flour and mix/beat with the dough hook of your mixer for about 10 minutes. The dough should be soft and pull cleanly away from the sides of the bowl. It should not be sticky, nor dry.",

Alas, a Croatian grandmother, I am not.",

      "1. Line 2 half sheet pans with parchment paper or Silpat liners. Set aside.",
      "2. Fill a bowl with hot water from the faucet (it should be about 105 F). Put the eggs (in the shell) in the water and let them sit until they come to room temperature. Check them and turn them over every few minutes so they can come up to temperature on both sides. They're ready when they don't feel hot or cold to the touch. You may need to add more hot water into the bowl if they're not warming up fast enough. Once the eggs are the right temperature, remove them from the water and dry them off. Crack the eggs and separate the yolks from the whites, measuring 2 1/2 ounces of egg whites for this recipe (you don't need the yolks for this recipe). Put the egg whites in a medium bowl and set aside.",
      "3. In a medium bowl, whisk or sift together the powdered sugar, almond meal, cocoa powder and salt (or you can pulse it together a few times in a food processor). Set aside.",
      "4. Use a handheld electric mixer to whip the egg whites. When the egg whites are foamy (this should only take a few seconds), gradually add the superfine sugar while still beating. When you have stiff, glossy peaks, beat in the vanilla extract and red food color.",
      "5. Use a rubber spatula to gently fold the almond meal mixture into the egg whites. Only fold the batter in one direction by sliding the spatula into the center of the batter, then lifting it up and letting the batter fall back onto itself. It generally takes about 50 strokes to work the batter, but this number isn't as important as how the batter looks. The batter is ready to pipe when it has a smooth, shiny surface and flows like lava in one large ribbon off the spatula. Here is an easy way to see if the batter is ready: Use a rubber spatula to lift and drop the batter onto itself. If the ribbon gradually disappears into the batter within 30 seconds, it's ready to go. If not, keep folding a bit longer.",
      "6. Pour the batter into a pastry bag fitted with a round tip (1/2 inch in diameter). Hold the piping bag straight (i.e. at a 90 degree angle) above the prepared baking sheet and pipe 1-inch circles onto the prepared sheet. You should get about 40 macarons. Leave about 1 inch between each macaron. Tap each tray a couple times on the countertop to help flatten out the macarons and get rid of any air bubbles. The macarons should not have points on top.",
      "7. Let the macarons sit at room temperature until they form a shell that's dry to the touch (this could take anywhere from 30 minutes to 2 hours or more, depending on the weather).",
      "8. Once the macarons are dry to the touch, preheat oven to 300 F. Once the oven is preheated, bake both trays at the same time for 10 to 20 minutes, rotating trays once. Bake time will vary based on your oven. Macarons should be firm when done. When done, remove the pans from the oven. Let the macarons cool completely on the pans before removing them.",
      "9. To fill the macarons, pair up similar sized cookies. Pipe the buttercream onto the bottom of one macaron, then place the matching macaron on top.",
      "10. Line an airtight lidded container with parchment paper and carefully arrange the macarons inside. Let them sit in the fridge for a day or two (or up to a couple weeks) before eating. Let the cookies sit at room temperature for about 45 minutes before serving.",
      "For the buttercream:",
      "Use a handheld electric mixer to beat together the butter, cream cheese, and vanilla Once it's light and combined, add the powdered sugar and beat until smooth."

      "5. Cooling racks or smooth (not terrycloth) cotton dish towels on which to lay the rolled-out circles of dough before frying them, plus some cotton dish towels to cover them so they don't dry out before they are fried.",
      "6. A deep pot: I use a deep enameled canning pot.",
      "7. A deep-fry thermometer is useful for maintaining the oil at the best temperature for frying.",
      "8. 2 slotted spoons.",
      "9. Baking sheets lined with brown paper: Brown paper grocery bags are excellent for draining deep-fried foods. Cut the bags down one side and across the bottom, turn them inside out and lay them out flat on the baking sheets.",

      "11. A small strainer.",

      "To make the Fastnachtkuchli:",
      "1. In a large bowl using a mixer, beat together the eggs and cream and salt.",
      "2. Stir in the flour (the equivalent to 1 1/2 cups plus 1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon of flour is 200 grams) and then knead the mixture by hand (right in the bowl) until it is no longer sticky and the sides of the bowl are clean. The dough will still be very soft and pliable. When you squeeze it between your fingers, it will not longer stick to them but it will still feel moist.",
      "3. Let the dough rest, covered with a towel, for 20 minutes.",
      "4. Cut the dough into pieces a little larger than the size of a walnut (around 30-32 grams each, if you weigh them) and roll them into balls. Set them on a platter or tray and cover them with a towel.",
      "5. Place a ball on a lightly floured pastry board and roll it into a very thin circle-about 8-inches (21 cm) in diameter. Pay particular attention to rolling out the edges, where the dough tends to be thickest. The edges will begin to crinkle as they thin out under the pressure of the rolling pin.",
      "6. Pick up the circle and stretch it out by hand to a diameter of about 9-inches (23 cm). Place the thin dough circle on a cooling rack or a smooth cotton towel and cover it with another towel. Continue making thin rounds of dough in the same way with the rest of the dough balls, arranging them side-by-side on cooling racks or on towels as you finish stretching them by hand.",
      "7. Put enough oil in a deep pot so that a round will float freely as it fries. Heat the oil to 350 F (176 C).",
      "8. The rounds are fried one at a time. Pick up a round and stretch it out a little by hand one last time. Place it in the hot oil. The middle of the dough will puff up. Press it down with the back of one of the slotted spoons. Bubbles will quickly form all over the surface of the round as it fries. When the first faint traces of color appear around its edges, turn the round over with the help of two slotted spoons. Fry it a little longer until the edges of the second side just begin to color. The second side will already be partially fried and will take an even shorter time to fry. A finished round is a very pale golden yellow, spotted here and there with deeper spots of gold.",
      "9. Transfer the round to a baking sheet lined with brown paper. Fry the rest of the thin rounds of dough in the same way. Pick up a second round, stretch it out again by hand a little more as you wait for the oil to return to 350 F (176 C). Ideally the oil should hover as closely as possible at this temperature during frying.",
      "10. After all the rounds have been fried, place one of them on a large plate and sift powdered sugar very liberally through a small strainer all over the cookie's surface. Transfer it to a platter.",
      "11. Powder the rest of the fried rounds in the same way and stack them on the serving platter. Fastnachtkuchli are good warm or at room temperature.",
      "An acknowledgement: This version of Fastnachtkuchli comes from 'Kochbuch'-a cookbook published in 1954 by the city of Bern's Department of Education and passed on to me by my mother-in-law Ann. They are a small taste of a celebration rich in history, tradition and very, very good times."

Allow glaze to set or eat immediately. Glaze will take a while to fully dry.**",
