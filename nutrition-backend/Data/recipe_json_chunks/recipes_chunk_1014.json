    "directions": [
      "CAKE:",
      "1. Preheat oven to 350&deg;F.",
      "2. In large mixing bowl, combine cake mix, chocolate pudding mix, sour cream, oil, eggs, and water. Mix well. Add mini chocolate chips, stir.",
      "3. Butter 2 8-inch round cake pans and divide batter equally. Bake for 30-40 minutes, until cakes test done. (Stick a toothpick in near the middle and see if it comes out clean. Watch out, if you hit a chocolate chip you may think it's not finished baking when it is!).",
      "4. Allow cakes to cool about 15 minutes before turning out of pans to cool completely (at least 1 hour).",
      "GANACHE:",
      "1. Once cakes are in oven, begin ganache. (This give it enough time to set.) Dump the Ghirardelli milk chocolate chips, 2 tbsp butter, and 1 tsp vanilla into a blender or food processor.",
      "2. In a small saucepan, heat 1 cup of the heavy cream and granulated sugar until boiling. Stir constantly, being careful not to burn it.",
      "3. Once it begins boiling, pour cream mixture over chocolate chips in blender or food processor. Mix until smooth.",
      "4. Place ganache in a covered container and refrigerate until cool and desired consistency.",
      "MOUSSE:",
      "1. In mixing bowl, combine 2 tbsp softened butter, 8 oz softened cream cheese, 3/4 c of the powdered sugar, 1/2 tsp vanilla extract, and 1/8 tsp salt. Mix at medium speed until smooth.",
      "2. Melt 2/3 c chocolate chips in the microwave, about 20 seconds at a time, stirring between each time. They are done when you can stir them completely smooth.",
      "3. Add melted chocolate to cream cheese mixture, mixing until fluffy and incorporated, about 1 minute.",
      "4. In a separate mixing bowl, combine 1/4 c powdered sugar and 1 tbsp vanilla pudding mix. The pudding mix stabilizes your whipped cream and keeps it from falling or weeping! Add remaining 1 c heavy whipping cream and beat until stiff peaks form. (It should look like whipped cream.).",
      "5. Scrape whipped cream into chocolate cream cheese mixture and fold gently to incorporate, stirring gently as needed to combine all ingredients.",
      "ASSEMBLY:",
      "1. Split cake layers horizontally so that you have 4 layers. Place first layer on cake tray or stand. Divide your mousse into three equal parts.",
      "2. Place one third of your mousse in the center of the cake layer. Gently spread it out to the edges to cover.",
      "3. Slice some raspberries in half (from top to tip) and cover the mousse with halved raspberries.",
      "4. Place next cake layer on top of raspberries.",
      "5. Repeat steps 2-4 until you have placed the top layer on the cake.",
      "6. Check on your ganache. You want it to have a soft frosting consistency. If it has not set firm enough yet, you can set your container in a bowl of ice water (be careful not to get water in the ganache!) to set faster. If it has set too firm, microwave for 5-10 seconds at a time and stir before microwaving any more.",
      "7. Scoop ganache a little at at time on the center of your top layer and spread outwards and down to cover top and sides of cake.",
      "8. Place whole raspberries in a ring around top of cake to decorate.",
      "9. You may wish to refrigerate your cake a short time before serving to help set ganache and stabilize mousse, or serve immediately. This is a cake to slice THIN. Enjoy!"

      "3. Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat, and lightly oil grate.",
      "4. Place meat on the prepared grill. Cook for 3 to 7 minutes per side, or to desired doneness.",
      "My Note: Since the title uses \"London Broil\" and the recipe uses \"Flank Steak\" I can see where there would be some confusion. I decided to use London Broil because it was on sale. This is definitely a thicker, tougher cut of meat and needs a longer marinating time 48 hours. I know that seems like a bit much but trust me it will pay off in the end. I used this marinade for 1 & 1/2 pounds of steak. I used kosher salt, low sodium soy sauce, olive oil vs. veg., chili sauce vs. ketchup, and added a splash of white wine vinegar. I put everything into a ziploc bag and let it go, turning it every so often and rubbing the marinade into the meat. After it's grilled to your liking cut against the grain and serve with a baked potato and fresh garden salad!",
      "Now, when London Broils are on sale, I buy several, make a big batch of this marinade, let them sit a day or two, then put them in individual freezer ziploc bags, with the marinade. Then, on a busy day, I can just pull out the pre-marinated steaks, defrost, grill, and enjoy! Great time and money saver, and so yummy!",
      "One time the meat didn't come out very tender so I added about 3 Tbls of lemon juice to act as a tenderizer. I also added about 2 tsp of worchestershire sauce.(we call it rooster sauce), 2 tsp of fish sauce, 1 tsp of ground ginger, chili sauce instead of ketchup and a tsp of garlic powder. I broiled this instead of grilling (due to the nasty weather) and it turned out really good.",
      "Using a london broil vs flank steak (as the recipe indicates) I added 2 tsp of lemon juice to assist in the tenderizing process, then marinated the meat for three days. Definitely more tender than a regular london broil using the marinade -- Next time I'll up the garlic and omit the oregano which overpowered the other flavors in the marinade. Will make again with modifications."

      "Lay out (not overlapping) on baking sheets and bake at 200F until they get crispy. Rotate racks and flip the chips once they start to get a bit crispy. Make sure to keep an eye on them to make sure they don`t burn, and if you notice certain chips ready much sooner than others, take them out in advance. Baking the chips will take about 40-60 minutes - It will be quicker at a higher temperature, but then you run the chance of burning them, and more nutrients are lost during the cooking.",
      "EXTRA TIPS: The best way to bake these is by using a food dehydrator, where you just lay them on the sheets and wait until they are nice and crispy, and they are raw, meaning that none of the nutrients are lost. This method will take several hours for them to be ready, but the taste will be superior. *****Nutritional yeast is deactivated yeast, it`s not alive, and it has a slightly cheesy flavor which many vegans like to use as a cheese substitute. It can be found at most health food stores and some big-chain grocery stores."

Increase the speed to medium-high and slowly stream in the 1/2 cup sugar. Once it is all mixed in, continue to whip on medium-high speed until soft peaks form (if you lift the whisk out of the whites, they will form a point that flops over onto its side), 3 to 5 minutes. Set this mixture-it's now meringue-aside, but keep it in the mixer bowl, with the mixer ready to go.",

Once all the syrup is incorporated, increase the mixer speed to high and whip until the meringue gets very stiff and sticky, 3 to 5 minutes.

Pour the nougat onto the prepared baking sheet and either cover it with a layer of wafer paper or sift a generous amount of confectioners' sugar on top.

Allow the nougat to cool to room temperature, about 1 hour.",

Using the chef's knife, trim the edges of the nougat and then slice it into bars or little bites.",

      "When coals are covered with gray ash and fire is still quite high (you can hold your hand 5 inches above coals for only a couple of seconds), place the skewers of meat directly over the flames. Allow the meat to cook, undisturbed, for approximately 3 to 4 minutes, then use kitchen tongs to turn them over and repeat on the other side. Continue turning the skewers every couple of minutes until the meat is deeply crisp at its edges, and cooked entirely through, approximately another 5 to 7 minutes. (Remove them to the cool side of the grill if they begin to burn, and cover the grill to allow them to smoke-roast until finished; this is much less likely to happen on a gas grill.).",
      "Allow the spiedies to rest on a cutting board for a few minutes, then remove the meat from the skewers onto cut hero rolls or a plate. Serve with hot sauce on the side."
