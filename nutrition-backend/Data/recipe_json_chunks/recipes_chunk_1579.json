      "The shortbread crust is exactly as it should be...buttery, with a hint of almond and just the right amount of sugar. The same dough is used for the tart base and the crumble topping. The jam layer is thin and lovely, more an accent than a filling, offering a fruity, tart contrast to the shortbread. Throw in a few nuts for crunch and balance, and you've got a state of pure bliss on your hands.",
      "Adapted from Desserts: Mediterranean Flavors, California Style, by Cindy Mushet.",
      "Preheat oven to 350F. You'll need a 9-inch tart pan with removable sides .",
      "Cream butter and sugar together until light, then mix in almond extract. In a separate bowl, whisk together the the flour and the salt, then stir this into the butter mixture using a wooden spoon. Mix just until dough begins to come together, and is stiff and crumbly.",
      "Reserve 1/2 cup of the dough - spread it in small crumbles and chunks on a plate, and put the plate into the freezer.",
      "Press remaining dough into the bottom and up the sides of your pan. The edges will be a little thicker than they would be for a standard tart, but that's fine.",
      "Spread the jam evenly over the dough. Take the plate with the remaining dough out of the freezer, and crumble it on top of the jam. Sprinkle with nuts, to taste.",
      "Bake in the preheated oven for 40 minutes, or until edges and topping are light golden brown. Cool, and dust with powdered sugar just before serving, if desired."

It will be almost to a simmer when this occurs. Rub a tiny bit between two fingers to see if you feel any sugar crystals. If so, continue to cook until smooth.",

They may seem small, but they'll spread to about 6-8 inches during baking. Bake 1 sheet at a time on the middle rack, until they're golden brown and bubbling, about 8 minutes.",
      "5. Cool cookies on the sheet for a minute or two. Flip a jumbo muffin pan upside down and have it beside the cookie sheet. Cut parchment around each cookie with kitchen shears, and place cookie side down, pressing lightly on the sides to mold them into a basket shape. Continue with remaining cookies. If the cookies are too soft, wait a little longer and try again. If they become too brittle to mold, simply pop the cookie sheet back in the oven a minute and they'll soften.",
      "6. Bake second sheet of cookies and repeat process. The baked cookie baskets will be firm enough to remove from your muffin pan while the others are baking. I like using the muffin pan because you can pop it in the oven a minute to soften the cookies if they become too brittle to remove.",
      "7. These cookies are very versatile. You can leave them flat and dip them halfway in chocolate before serving. Or spread melted chocolate, ganache, or buttercream filling on one cookie and top it with another to make a sandwich. Or use a wooden spoon or homemade foil mold to shape them into cylinders or cones and fill if desired. Oh, the possibilities are endless.",

Then add the yeast, mix gently, cover and set aside for 10 minutes or until foamy.",

Roll it into a long rope (about 6 to 8 inches long). Then attach the two ends together. At this point you can determine how big you want your donuts to be and how wide. Keep in mind that the dough will rise again to double its size. Once you place the donut on the tray, adjust the hole to make sure it does not close shut during baking. Place it on the cookie sheet. Repeat until all the dough is used. Cover and set aside for another 30 minutes to rise again.",
      "Preheat oven to 350 F. Once oven is preheated, bake donuts for 12 to 15 minutes. Once they come out of the oven they will have this puffy texture and might look like bread rolls but the consistency will turn into a donut-like dough once it cools. Remove them from the pan onto a cooling rack as soon as they come out of the oven.",

      "In a mixing bowl, gradually add the boiling water to the cornmeal. Mix until water is absorbed and mixture is stiff enough to hold together when you make it into a patty. Let the mixture sit for a minute to cool enough to handle. In a deep cast iron skillet, pour oil to about 1 inch deep and heat over medium-high heat. Shape patties out of the mixture, in an oval shape and about the size of your palm. Dip your hands in a bowl of cool water as you do this to prevent the dough from sticking to your hands. You can adjust the thickness of the patty to suit your taste, keeping in mind that the thinner it is, the crisper it will get and the thicker it is, the longer it will take to cook through. Mama always made hers thin, about 1/2 inch or so, because Daddy like them crisp. Place in the hot grease and fry on each side 3-4 minutes until golden brown. Drain on a plate with paper towels and serve up! You will probably have to cook these in batches, so keep an eye on your grease that it doesn't get too hot."

      "Fill a large pot with water and set over high heat (this is for the corn. I just do this on the indoor grill since I don't have an outdoor grill and it's pretty easy.) Shuck the corn and drop it into the pot. Get that boiling and add some salt.",

      "Let that cook until the onions are translucent and the celery is soft. About 10 minutes or so. Add your garlic and chili powder and let that cook for another minute or so.",
      "Once the corn is tender, about 8 - 10 minutes (prick it with a fork, it should easily penetrate the kernel), remove it to a paper towel and let it dry completely.",
      "If you have an indoor grill, get that screaming hot. Brush the corn with a little olive oil and get that on the grill. Give it a few turns every few minutes.",
      "Drain the can of beans a little. You can keep some liquid, but just get about half the liquid out.",

If you have a potato masher, this is a good time to use it, if not, the back of a wooden spoon will do. I give the whole mixture a good mash. I don't care if it's too smooth, but a good mashing is nice.",
      "Kick the heat on the soup up to high and let that cook together for about 10 - 15 minutes. If you have a food mill get it out. If not, use a food processor or blender.",
      "I put my food mill over a large bowl. Spoon about 3/4 of the soup mixture into the mill and get going. I leave about a 1/4 of the soup in the soup pot for a little texture and I process the rest. I personally don't want all of it to be smooth, I like some chunks. If you're using a blender or processor, use the same technique.",
      "Once you're done, pour the soup back into the pot and bring it down to a simmer.",

If you can't find unsweetened, flaked coconut (I use Bob's Red Mill brand), using sweetened is fine, but I would decrease the sugar by a 1/2 tablespoon (or more/less, depending on tastes). You can also sub in milk, cream or half and half for the coconut milk if you wish. However, the coconut milk does NOT add a coconut flavor to the casserole. This serves about 6-8 as long as it is an accompanying side dish, but it is easily multiplied."

      "This recipe is equivalent to about 3 regular batches of cookie dough. You'll only need 1/3 of the dough to make one giant cookie (12\" size). Since it was my first time making this recipe (and I was adapting it to boot), I didn't cut it down. I split the dough into three equal portions. You can make the giant cookie out of 1/3 of the dough, and scoop the remainder into balls once the dough is chilled, then store the dough in the freezer, sealed in a Ziploc bag for up to 1 month (be sure to squeeze the air out before sealing the bag). So when that cookie craving strikes, you can pull out just as many cookies as you want and enjoy them freshly baked.",
      "For 5 inch size cookies use a 4 ounce sized scoop and bake for about 20 minutes at 350 F; for 1 1/4\" cookies use a 1 ounce scoop and bake at 350 F for about 15 minutes.",
      "For the chocolate chips, wafers or chunks: I recommend that you use a high quality chocolate such As Scharffen Berger, Valrhona, or Callebaut.",
      "1. Prepare vanilla bean brown butter. Cut each stick of unsalted butter into quarters. Add butter, 1 vanilla bean and the seeds to a medium saucepan. Heat on medium, stirring occasionally, until the butter turns golden and smells nutty. It will foam and then begin to clear when it is almost ready. Remove butter from the heat and cool it slightly. Remove the vanilla bean, then cover the pan and place the butter in the refrigerator for 20-30 minutes, until it's the consistency of softened butter.",
      "2. Preheat oven to 350 F. Lightly grease a 12\" cast iron skillet with canola oil.",
      "3. To make the monster cookie: In the bowl of your stand mixer, using the paddle attachment, cream the vanilla bean brown butter and sugars on medium speed. Add the eggs, one at a time, mixing well before adding each one.",
      "4. Add vanilla to the egg mixture and beat until well blended. Set aside.",
      "5. In a separate bowl, whisk all of the flours, baking powder, baking soda, and salt until well blended.",
      "6. Add 1/3 of the flour mixture at a time to the batter, using an on/off pulsing motion to mix until just about incorporated. After you add the last 1/3 of the flour, stop mixing just before it's all incorporated. Now add the chocolate, a little at a time, mixing on low speed just until it is incorporated.",
      "7. Spread 1/3 of the dough into the prepared cast iron skillet. Bake for about 25-30 minutes on the center rack, just until golden on the edges but still soft in the center. Don't over bake! It will continue to bake in the skillet when you remove it from the oven.",
      "8. Cool on a baking rack for about 10 minutes, then drizzle with chocolate and caramel toppings if desired. For the topping: Place chopped semisweet chocolate in a loosely closed Ziploc bag, and microwave on medium power for about 1 1/2 minutes, just until melted. Snip a tiny piece off of one corner of the bag, and drizzle chocolate over the top of the cookie. Next, prepare the caramel by placing the unwrapped caramels and evaporated milk into a microwaveable bowl. Heat on high in the microwave for about 1 1/2 minutes, stopping every 30 seconds to stir, until the caramel is smooth. Drizzle the caramel over the top of the chocolate drizzles with a fork or spoon.",
      "9. Enjoy the cookie warm, or once it's cool, cover it with plastic wrap and keep it for up to 2 days at room temperature. You can also flip the cookie out of the skillet after it's cooled about 20 minutes. To do this: place a plate upside down on top of the skillet, then turn the skillet over. The cookie should pop right out. Place another plate over the upside down cookie, and flip it over so it's right side up again.",

I live at about 5,000 feet above sea level in a very dry climate and I ended up using about 7 cups of flour at this point in the recipe. Add enough to make a soft dough that pulls away from the sides of the bowl - when you mix, it will be slightly sticky.",
      "Lightly mist a large bowl with cooking spray and place the dough into it, cover with a lid or a clean cloth or plastic wrap. Place in a warm area and allow to rise until doubled. Punch down dough and cover it again and allow it to rise until doubled a second time.",
      "After the second rise, punch down the dough and then turn it out onto a floured surface. Gently roll it out until about 1/2 inch thick. Cut out your donut shapes, place them on lightly floured cookie sheets, cover with a clean cloth, place somewhere warm and allow to rise again until at least doubled in size.",
      "In a large stock pot or fryer, heat your oil to 375F. Place a section of newspaper on your counter and cover it in paper towels.",
      "Carefully add 2 or 3 donuts into the hot oil and all to fry for about 30 seconds on each side or until they are golden brown. You can use a chopstick or the end of a wooden spoon handle to flip them over and remove them from the oil. Place donuts on the paper towels to drain. Continue until all donuts and holes are fried. Clean the cookie sheets off and place the donuts on them.",
      "In a clean bowl mix the powdered sugar, cider, and cinnamon until you get a nice even glaze. Dip the top half of the donuts in the glaze and place them back on the cookie sheets and allow the glaze to set.",
      "Serve immediately. They can be stored in an airtight container for up to 3 days. To freshen older spudnuts just place them on a paper towel and microwave them for about 7 or 8 seconds before eating.",
      "Tips and tricks:",
      "- You can substitute 1 cup of instant mashed potatoes if you want, just make sure to add about an extra Tablespoon of butter when you prepare them.",
      "- Strongly flavored apples work best in this recipe. I tend to like tart old fashioned varieties like Jonathan, Cortland, Winesap, or Granny Smith.",
      "- Keeping the mashed potatoes warm until they are added will help make the spudnuts fluffy. I don't know why this works but it does.",
      "- If your house is like mine (cold and very dry) and yeast products don't seem to want to rise, try this: Fill your dryer a little more than half full of towels, run it on high for 5 minutes and then turn it off, place your bowl of dough on top of the towels in the dryer and allow the dough to rise in there. I learned this from my friend Patience and it has worked really well. I even added my sweater drying rack to the dryer and could put 2 cookies sheets on it, side by side."

      "Other Tools: a large heavy bottomed Dutch oven or stockpot with lid and an instant read thermometer.",
      "To begin, take your 1/3 cup of Greek yogurt (either store bought or from a previous batch) and allow it to set out at room temperature.",
      "Next we're going to heat the milk to 185 degrees. It MUST reach 185. Use a thermometer to keep it accurate. Do this over medium heat and whisk often, so that it doesn't scorch.",
      "Remove from the heat and allow the pot of the milk to drop to around 110-120 degrees.",
      "Once you reach this temperature, take your 1/3 cup of yogurt \"starter\" and whisk it into the warm milk. Whisk away folks! Make sure it's well combined.",
      "At this point, you're going to cover the pot of milk with a lid. You now want to allow the yogurt starter to \"work\"...so you want a warm (not hot) draft free place to set the mixture. I have found that placing the covered pot in the oven, with the oven light on, provides an ideal environment. Another option that I have used successfully is to put the pot on an insulated casserole carrier, place warming pads around it, and then cover it with a blanket. However, the oven light wins for me as far as convenience.",
      "Now all we have to do is....wait.",
      "Yup, stick that baby in the oven or under the blanket and let the yogurt bacteria do their thing. I usually let my milk sit, undisturbed for about 10-12 hours.",
      "I have found it works well to heat your milk in the evening, \"put it to bed\" in the oven, and by the next morning....your yogurt is nearly ready to go.",
      "As soon as you uncover the yogurt, you'll notice a light watery substance on the top of it.",
      "This is the whey. I usually pour off the whey that is on the top. After that I take a large strainer and place it atop a large bowl.",
      "Then line the strainer with a muslin towel or several layers of cheesecloth. Pour the yogurt into the cloth, then twist the ends up around it so that the cloth is tight around the blog of sloppy yogurt.",
      "Stick the whole mess in the refrigerator, so it can cool as it strains. I usually let it drain 1-2 hours, depending how thick you like your finished yogurt to be (and once or twice I'll take it from the fridge and dump out the whey collected in the bottom). And then...all that's left is scraping it into clean jars and refrigerating it. A gallon of milk should net you close to 4 pint jars of yogurt.",

Add the whole wheat flour plus 1/4 cup of the bread flour, sugar, and salt and stir on medium-high until the dough starts to come together. Add the butter and continue to stir, adding additional bread flour about 1/8 cup at a time, until the dough starts to form into a ball. Attach your dough hook and knead in the remaining bread flour a little at a time until the dough is somewhat smooth and only slightly sticky.",
      "Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let dough rest in a warm place for 30 minutes. Then remove the plastic wrap, push down the dough and let it recover. And then put the plastic back over the bowl and refrigerate for 1 hour or up to 12 hours.",

Use a 2-inch biscuit cutter and cut out the dough and place on the dusted towel, about 1-inch apart. You can re-roll the scraps of dough to make additional doughnuts.",
      "Cover the sheet of doughnuts with plastic wrap and let them rise for 30 to 45 minutes or until doubled in size. If you had let them chill for longer in the above step they may take longer to rise. Keep an eye on them to avoid over-proofing and check every 5 minutes. To test, use your fingertip and gently press down on the center of the doughnut. If it rises quickly, it needs more time. If it doesn't rise, it has over-proofed and you will need to re-roll the dough and try again. If it rises slowly, it's just right and ready for frying!",
      "Just before the doughnuts have finished proofing, fill a heavy pot with oil about 2-inches high. Heat until the oil reaches 365 F. Carefully, place a few of the doughnuts into the hot oil and fry for about 1 to 2 minutes on each side or until golden brown. Be careful not to overcrowd the pot as this will drop the temperature down. Remove the cooked doughnuts with a slotted spoon and place on a wire rack with paper towels underneath. Repeat frying the rest of the doughnuts. Allow the doughnuts to cool before frosting.",
      "For the maple meringue frosting:",
      "In a small pot, add maple syrup and heat to 235 F using a candy thermometer. Be careful not to overheat! When the syrup reaches 220 F, add the egg whites, cream of tartar, and salt into your stand mixer bowl. Stir until frothy and then increase the speed to medium until stiff peaks are achieved. When the syrup has come to temperature, slowly pour it into the egg whites, with the mixer still at medium speed. Allow to mix until the meringue is thick and shiny, about 2 minutes. Frost donuts as desired.",

I wrap one half of the dough in plastic wrap and then place it in a baggie to go in the fridge or freezer for a future day of fresh galette baking.",
      "In a mixing bowl or in the bowl of a food processor, mix just 2 cups of the flour with the salt and sugar. Add the cold chunks of butter and cut them into the flour mixture using a rigid pastry cutter or by pulsing the mixture in the food processor. Once the mixture looks like large crumbs clinging together in clumps, add the remaining 1/2 cup of flour. Mix lightly or pulse the food processor a few times to combine. Do not over mix. The flour should coat the clumps. Sprinkle the ice water over the dough. With your hands or a wooden spoon, mix until the dough holds together. Divide dough in half and form into two discs. (This is the point where I freeze one of the discs for later use, since the filling is only enough for one galette).",

Continue rolling from center to outer edge until you have a circle shape between 11\" and 12\" in diameter.",

Then spoon the prepared apple filling over the marzipan, leaving a 2\" apple-free border around the entire circle of dough. Dot the apple mixture with the 2 tablespoons of butter. Gently fold the 2\" dough border up and over the apple mixture, pressing gently to seal. Your aim is for a rustic look, with nothing perfectly even (see photo). The dough border will only partially cover the apple mixture, leaving exposed apples in the center. If you have any trouble lifting the dough border from the parchment paper, simply slide a very thin spatula dipped in flour between the dough and parchment to loosen it.",
      "Beat the egg with the 1 tablespoon of water and brush some of the mixture on the dough for a beautiful golden baked pastry. Mix together the cinnamon and sugar, and sprinkle on the dough to your liking. Bake for about 30 minutes, or until the crust is beautifully browned and the apples are bubbling a bit. Remove from oven to cool.",
      "For the finishing touch, prepare the almond drizzle. Place the remaining 1/4 cup of sugar in a small heavy saucepan over medium-high heat. Cook until the sugar dissolves, stirring as needed to dissolve the sugar evenly. This should take about 4 minutes or so. Cook for 1 minute longer, or until the sugar is golden in color. Remove from heat and carefully stir in 1/4 teaspoon almond extract. Drizzle over galette. The drizzle hardens rather quickly, so don't dilly-dally with this step. Once the almond drizzle has set, slice the galette.",

I decided that my son misses so many birthdays that we would celebrate all of them during the weekend. One request that I had was for Red Velvet Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting. Oh boy was all I could think. How was I going to make those be low fat and still be delicious. I have tried with cream cheese frosting before and didn't have the best of luck. Just not happy with consistency or taste. So it was off to the test kitchen and internet! Problem was, we are having a huge heat wave (like the rest of the nation) and I had that to contend with also.",

It is not totally fat free but is a great deal lower in fat than my original by a great deal. I used 1/3 less fat cream cheese so that I could still get the cream cheese flavor (let's face it the no fat has very little flavor), so we were are still looking at 48 grams in the batch but you can limit the amount you have on your cupcake!",
      "Beat cream cheese and cornstarch together in bowl. Add sugar and mix well. If you are making your own whipped topping, do so in another bowl. Take your whipped topping and gently fold it into the cream cheese mixture. Be sure it's all incorporated together. Place in the refrigerator for 30 - 40 minutes before frosting your cake/cupcakes. Once you have frosted your cake/cupcakes be sure to store in the fridge. So yummy!"

Then remove pan from heat and pour liquid mixture into flour mixture. Add eggs and egg white. Using a wooden spoon or spatula, beat mixture together until combined thoroughly. Stir in 2 more cups of all-purpose flour.",
      "3. Knead the dough in the bowl until mixture is partially-combined. Turn it onto a lightly floured surface and knead completely (about 3 minutes - keep in mind, the dough will be slightly sticky. If this is the case, add remaining flour to dough). Place dough in a lightly oiled bowl and turn once over, coating the other side. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place until doubled in bulk (about 1 hour).",
      "Now on to the delectable filling:",
      "1. Combine brown sugar, corn syrup, and cinnamon in saucepan. Heat over medium heat and stir until smooth. Set aside to cool.",
      "2. Once dough has risen, spread it out on a floured surface. Spread dough out and roll the dough thin, maintaining a long, rectangular shape. Let dough rest for 10 minutes.",
      "3. Drizzle the brown-sugar mixture over the dough. Sprinkle on some raisins or nuts if desired.",
      "4. Roll up the dough into a long log, pinching the edges together along the length of the roll.",
      "5. Slice the roll into 12 pieces with a sharp knife.",
      "6. Coat a 9x13-inch baking dish with spray and place cinnamon rolls, cut-side up and slightly apart, in the dish (rolls will rise and expand). Cover with plastic wrap or paper towel and let rise until nearly doubled (about 30-45 minutes).",
      "To bake:",
      "1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Bake rolls until light brown (about 20-25 minutes). Transfer to rack and let cool slightly in pan.",
      "Lastly, the maple glaze to coat the rolls:",
      "1. Stir together 2 cups confectioners' sugar, 4 Tablespoons milk, cinnamon, and 1/2 cup maple syrup in bowl. Refrigerate mixture while rolls bake. Once ready, drizzle the glaze over the rolls and serve them warm."

      "For the salad:",
      "In a large heavy pot, cover quinoa with water. Add 1 teaspoon salt and bring to a boil. Cover and simmer over medium-low heat until quinoa is tender and the water is absorbed, 18-20 minutes. Uncover the pot, top with a clean kitchen towel, and close the pot again; let stand 5 minutes. (This will help ensure the quinoa is dry and fluffy). Spread the hot quinoa on a platter or baking sheet and let cool to room temperature. (This sounds like a fussy step, but it helps the quinoa cool without overcooking and getting mushy.)",
      "In a very large clear plastic serving bowl, spread lettuce in a single layer and season lightly with salt and pepper. Arrange herbs on top, followed by the quinoa. Spread the radishes on top, followed by the cucumbers, pushing them toward the edge of the bowl if you don't have enough of each vegetable to form a complete layer.",
      "For the dressing:",
      "In a dry skillet, toast the spices over moderate heat until fragrant, about 1 minute. Transfer to a mortar or bowl. Use a pestle or an ice cream scoop to lightly crush the spices.",
      "In a medium mixing bowl, whisk yogurt with mayonnaise, garlic, lemon juice and vinegar. Season with salt. Spread the dressing over the salad, sprinkle with the spices, and refrigerate for at least 1 hour before serving.",
      "Notes:",
      "1. To make this salad in a jar, simply follow the instructions above. The recipe will yield 4 quart jars. This is a large portion and will allow you to leave some room in the top so you can easily mix it up when you're ready to eat. Unfortunately, I only had 4 pint jars, so I halved the recipe. The portions were perfect for four lunch-sized portions for the week, but required that you compress the lettuce as much as possible to make room for all 7 layers. I found a whisk helpful for pushing down each layer.",
      "2. Shredded rotisserie chicken would be an amazing additional layer if you want more protein!"

If the bowl does not cool and meringue has formed, you can put an ice bath under the mixing bowl while it is mixing.",
      "Once the meringue is ready, replace whisk attachment with paddle attachment and add cubes of butter one at a time mixing on low speed until the mixture is light and creamy. If mixture gets lumpy, keep mixing for several minutes; if it gets runny, place bowl in the fridge for 10 minutes before continuing to mix. Make sure that you stop the mixer to scrape sides of bowl, then continue to beat on low speed for another minute.",

The goal is to still have the marshmallows intact, so don't stir too much as it will break them up and cause them to melt into the peanut butter mixture. Spread this over the peanuts. Then sprinkle the other half of the peanuts over the top and press in with the flat side of a spatula or large spoon.",
      "If you like the Salted Nut Roll candy bar, without chocolate, eat these just like they are. Just refrigerate to set, then cut into bars. If you want to try the caramel and chocolate dipped version, read on. (And I highly recommend that you do!)",
      "Once the bars have set up in the refrigerator, prepare the caramel dip. In a medium bowl, microwave the caramels, butter, and milk. Heat for 30 seconds at a time. Check and stir the mixture regularly and don't allow the mixture to scorch. Transfer caramel to a small bowl that will allow the salted nut roll to be dipped into it sufficiently. I used a 1-cup ramekin with sides 2\" tall.",
      "After they are chilled, cut the pan of salted nut roll into your desired size and shape pieces. Mine were about 3\" x 1-1/2\" each, mimicking the elongated candy bar shape. From a short edge of the pan, cut 1-1/2\" rows, and then cut each row into 3 pieces.",
      "Lay a piece of parchment paper (don't use wax paper!) on each of 2 cookie sheets or jelly roll pans.",
      "Dip the cut bars halfway into the caramel. Use a spoon to aid your caramel covering, if needed. Let excess caramel run back into the bowl and lightly slide the bottom of the caramel dipped bar along the edge of the bowl, to help remove excess caramel. Set it on parchment paper and repeat until you are done dipping in caramel. Place pan in the refrigerator to set up the caramel. Once set, if the caramel has pooled around the base of the bar, you can easily trim the caramel with a knife, if desired.",
      "Now make the chocolate dip. In a small bowl, microwave the chocolate chips and shortening on low heat. Heat for 30 seconds at a time. Check and stir the mixture regularly, taking care to not let it scorch. Once the chocolate chips are a little more than halfway melted, just stir until they melt all the way. Let cool until just barely warm and transfer to another small diameter bowl or ramekin for dipping. Then dip your caramel dipped salted nut roll bars into the chocolate, leaving a bit of the caramel showing. Gently shake off any excess chocolate and lightly slide the bottom of the fully dipped bar along the edge of the bowl, to help remove excess chocolate. Set on parchment paper and repeat until you are done dipping in chocolate. Place in the refrigerator to set.",
      "Cheater Version: If you want the added caramel and chocolate, but don't want to go through the dipping/cooling/dipping/cooling process, I offer you this... Make a half recipe each of both the caramel dip and the chocolate dip. Then drizzle each one over the top of the pan of bars. I did this for a pan of bars and it's an easy compromise, with considerably less work."
