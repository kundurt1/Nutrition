      "FOR GLAZED CHOCOLATE BROWNIE CUPCAKES: Once the brownies are done, remove from pan onto a plate and place into the freezer for quicker cooling. If your glaze has been done for a little while you should re-heat it so its warm. After about 10 minutes check your brownies (they should be cool now.) Now take your warm glaze and thoroughly drizzle each cupcake. Serve still drippy or wait about 15 minutes for glaze to harden up .For best results take a tablespoon or so of glaze and pour right on top. If its warm enough it should trickle along the sides of the cupcake, covering the whole thing. Add more if necessary."

Remember that the thinner the clump, the crispier it'll turn out during frying. Fry the rice clump until it is a nice golden brown on the outside, then remove it from the oil.

      "First prepare the filling:",
      "Preheat a large pan, preferably cast iron, over medium heat. Saute the mushrooms and leeks in oil until soft, about 10 minutes. Add salt, pepper, garlic and thyme. Cook for about 2 more minutes, stirring often.",
      "Sprinkle in the breadcrumbs and toss to coat. Cook the mixture, stirring very often, until the breadcrumbs are toasty and the mixture is relatively dry. This should take about 5 minutes, and the breadcrumbs should turn a few shades darker.",
      "Drizzle in the broth and lemon juice and toss to coat until moist. If it still seems dry drizzle in a little extra olive oil. Set aside until ready to use.",
      "Prepare the roast:",
      "Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F In a food processor, pulse the garlic until well chopped. Add the beans, broth, olive oil and soy sauce and puree until mostly smooth (a few pieces of bean are okay, but they should be no bigger than a pea.).",
      "In a large mixing bowl, mix together the wheat gluten, nutritional yeast, herbs and spices. Make a well in the center and add the bean mixture. Stir with a wooden spoon until the mixture starts coming together to form a ball of dough. Knead until everything is well incorporated.",
      "Now we're going to roll out the seitan and form the roast. Place two pieces of tin foil (about 18 inches long) horizontally in front of you. The sheet further from you should overlap the closer sheet by about 6 inches. This way you have enough foil to wrap around the whole roast.",
      "On a separate surface, use your hands or a rolling pin to flatten the seitan into a roughly 12 x 10 rectangle. If any pieces rip, don't worry about it, just use a pinch of dough from the ends to repair any holes.",
      "Place the filling in the lower 1/3 of the seitan rectangle, leaving about 2 inches of space at both ends. Make sure the filling is compact, use your hands to form it into a nice, tight bundle.",
      "Now roll! Roll the bottom part of the seitan up and over the filling. Keep rolling until in it's in a log shape. Now pinch together the seam and pinch together the sides to seal. It doesn't have to be perfect, it will snap into shape when baking.",
      "Place the roll in the center of the tinfoil and roll up like a tootsie roll, making sure the ends are tightly wrapped. Transfer to a baking sheet and bake for an hour*. Rotate the roll every 20 minutes for even cooking.",
      "* I may update the time in this recipe because I've gotten a few comments that said it took up to 90 minutes to cook completely! So for now I would say just do a test my poking the roll with tongs. It should feel very very firm. If it doesn't, then bake further.",
      "Remove from oven and let cool. Unwrap, slice and serve! (See recipe notes for keeping moist and reheating.).",
      "NOTES FROM ISA:",
      "~For best results, use a salty homemade vegetable broth. Salt is integral to the flavor of the seitan, so if your broth isn't seasoned then add a teaspoon or so of salt to it.",
      "~You'll also want to spoon broth over the roast before serving, to keep it from being dry. Of course you're going to be coating it in gravy, too. But the broth is a nice touch. If you're slicing and serving, ladle on spoonfuls of broth on each individual slice, too. You can't have too much juice, here!",
      "~This roast reheats perfectly. Refrigerate in its wrapper for up to 3 days before hand. When ready to serve, preheat an oven to 350 F and cook for 20 minutes. This will dry it out a bit, so use the broth hints above for sure!",
      "~Use a steak knife for the easiest slicing.",
      "~I used storebought breadcrumbs but if you use homemade, use 3/4 cup.",
      "~This makes enough for 6 hungry people. If it's not Thanksgiving or another holiday, and people are not totally stuffing their faces, it serves at least 8."

      "Put 1cm/just under 1/2 inch of sunflower oil into a baking tin, then place this on the middle shelf of your oven at its highest setting (240i1/2250\u00b0C/475\u00b0F/gas 9). Place a larger tray underneath it to catch any oil that overflows from the tin while cooking. When the oil is very hot, add your sausages. Keep your eye on them and allow them to colour until lightly golden.",
      "At this point, take the tin out of the oven, being very careful, and pour your batter over the sausages. Throw a couple of sprigs of rosemary into the batter. It will bubble and possibly even spit a little, so carefully put the tin back in the oven, and close the door. Don't open it for at least 20 minutes, as Yorkshire puddings can be a bit temperamental when rising. Remove from the oven when golden and crisp.",
      "For the onion gravy, simply fry off your onions and garlic in the butter on a medium heat for about 5 minutes until they go sweet and translucent. You could add a little thyme or rosemary if you like. Add the balsamic vinegar and allow it to cook down by half. At this point, I do cheat a little and add a stock cube or powder. You can get some good ones in the supermarkets now that aren't full of rubbish. Sprinkle this in and add a little water. Allow to simmer and you'll have a really tasty onion gravy. Serve at the table with your Toad in the Hole, mashed potatoes, greens and baked beans or maybe a green salad if you're feeling a little guilty!"

When I buy my seafood, I also make sure the fish guy cleans my mussels and clams so I don't have to worry about that when I get home, but I do rinse them just to be safe but I don't have to clean them, just a quick rinse is all they need. The rest you can just throw inches.",

      "If you need more water, add another 3 quarts and 2/3 cup Old Bay and turn to high and bring to a boil, covered, and then reduce back to medium. Just keep an eye on the clams and mussels. When they start to open is when you want to add the shrimp.",
      "Add the shrimp and the remaining lemon wedges, squeeze a couple on top of the shrimp, cover, and cook until the shrimp are pink and they begin to curl.",
      "Turn off the heat. DONE! Just lift up the strainer, or drain if just using a pot on the stove or grill and pour everything on the table.",
      "It is the best meal ever, and fun. Now, I make a spicy cocktail sauce and a garlic herb butter, but use what you like. Grill or just bake some bread to soak up the butter sauce and enjoy with the seafood. I served some roasted tomato soup with this once which was really good and then just a fresh tomato bread salad another time, so please serve what you like, but it is so much fun. And I say this serves 6 possible 8-10 depending of your guests, so have fun what you add."

Stir in the tomatoes, rice, 1/2 cup water and Worcestershire sauce. Cover, and simmer for 15 minutes, or until rice is tender. Remove from heat, and stir in the cheese.",
      "3. Preheat the oven to 350*F. Stuff each pepper with the beef and rice mixture, and place peppers open side up in a baking dish. In a medium bowl, combine tomato soup with just enough water to make the soup a gravy consistency. Pour over the peppers.",
      "4. Bake covered for 25 to 35 minutes, until heated through and cheese is melted and bubbly.",
      "My Note: I play with the recipe some. I halved the peppers (lengthwise), sauted onions separately along with 2 minced garlic pieces, cooked the rice separately, used 1 can of DICED tomatoes* (why would you ever buy a can of tomatoes and THEN dice them?), and mixed the ingredients together after browning the beef**, allowing them to warm slightly in the skillet before stuffing into the peppers. You can use the extra juice from the can of tomatoes to keep the rice from burning. I also added quite a bit of basil, oregano, and Italian seasoning, as well as extra Worcestershire sauce. Putting just a little cheese in the bottom of each pepper helped as well. Lastly, I only used one can of tomato soup. Even cut in half, 25 min was needed to get them nice & hot. Next time, I'll try adding some pepper as well. * Using a can of diced tomatoes with jalepeno peppers adds just the right amount of kick to these! **You can also use 1/2 beef & 1/2 3-7% lean ground turkey to reduce fat content -- tastes the same!",
      "I'll definitely make this again. I used ground turkey instead of beef, and a can of petite diced tomatoes w/ liquid instead of whole toms. Used Arborio rice as that's what I had in the pantry. Added minced garlic to the meat mixture. I substituted 1/2\u00b0C of beef broth instead of plain water. Used 1 can of tomato soup & 1 sm. can of tomato sauce w/ a TBS or two of Spaghetti Sauce Seasoning. Excellent, healthy, and much better than the stuffed peppers. I think that par-boiling the peppers before stuffing them was key to the texture and flavor."

But, it's all got to fit in your pot! LOL!). You do not have to cut it up. I see so many recipes where they are cutting the meat off the bone in neat little cubes and adding them to the pot. That is craziness! Firstly, the bone has a LOT of flavor and secondly, why work when the steam causes it to fall off the bone? I like to just toss in the entire ham, with whatever is leftover from our meal. When the dish is ready it will literally just fall off the bone at the time of serving. That is the beauty of this dish -- easy peasy!",

      "A crock pot is perhaps the best way to make this meal the first time around, however I have made it on the stove top with the heat set to the lowest setting for the past 30 years. I like to use the stove because I have a pot far larger than the crock. It's up to you. If using a crock pot, use the medium setting all day long (depending -- if you have a crappy crock, you may need to set it on high -- you know what you have). On stove, cook at lowest possible setting all day. This is the perfect meal to set up before going to work -- when you get home dinner is ready!",
      "I just want to make a point of saying that NO water is required. You may have a hard time believing this. My mother certainly does and has ruined many pots as she will dump a tall glass (or 2) of water in when I'm not looking. Unfortunately you then wind up with a pot of water with ham, cabbage and potatoes swimming around begging to be rescued--and you lose a ton of flavor. DO NOT ADD WATER. Please trust me. There will be plenty of juice from the cabbage. So much so that you will most likely throw it out (though I like to use it as broth to pour over the dogs' dry food).",

Pour this in to the well, little by little, stirring and gradually bringing more flour in to the centre with a fork. Do this until all the flour is mixed in to the dough.",
      "Next you want to knead the dough for 5-10 minutes so that it is of a smooth elastic consistency and does not stick. If you don't know how to knead dough check out www.youtube.com there are some great video's. Do this on a lightly floured surface with floured hands, applying a dusting of flour when needed. Hint: Use latex gloves to prevent dough from sticking to your hands.",
      "Put the dough back in a lightly oiled bowl with a damp cloth to cover it. Let this sit in a warm place ideally about 40C or 100F until it has doubled in size this should take about an hour to an hour and a half. Remove the dough from the bowl and 'knock it back' punch the air out of it, do this for 1-2 minutes. Set this aside for later.",
      "The secret of great dough is using ice cold ingredients (milk, and water). If you have time, let the dough sit in the refrigerator overnight when you reach this stage, you will need to knock it back once more before you roll it out. This will make approximately 2 largish pizzas.",
      "For the tomato sauce i find using fresh tomatoes gives a better taste, plum tomatoes give a nice sweet taste or you can use canned ones here. Take the plum tomatoes and pierce the skin with a fork then blanch in boiling water for a few seconds, you should be able to remove the skin now. Put these in a saucepan and mash them up. Add all the other ingredients, apart from the basil, you can garnish with that on the finished pizza. Gently warm the ingredients for 5-10 minutes, don't burn it. There should be enough here for 2 fairly large pizza's.",
      "Roll out the dough with a rolling pin on a well floured surface, apply the tomato sauce and then add your cheese. The amount of cheese in the recipe is per pizza, and should be enough for 1 fairly large pizza.",
      "Grate the Mozzarella and apply evenly over pizza, sprinkle with Parmigiano-Reggiano and the grated provolone. The secret here is not to smother the pizza in cheese you want to be able to taste the full flavours in the pizza. A selection of Italian cheeses really makes a difference too.",
      "Add your favourite topping, My favourite topping is some portobello mushrooms sauteed in garlic butter and bell peppers, but you can add whatever you want. Again try not to smother it with toppings, the Italians tend to take the less is sometimes more approach here.",
      "Cook in a preheated oven on your maximum setting, probably about 250\u00b0C Watch it doesn't burn it will only need about 10 minutes. A great tip is use a pizza stone, if you cook a lot of pizza and don't have one then buy one. It transfers the heat very fast in to the dough and creates a great crispy base that is unmatched to any other methods of cooking it, apart from using an authentic pizza oven."

      "* About the chicken: it's hard to get a chicken larger than 3 lbs. Buy a nice chubby chicken, and make up the shortfall with a pack of chicken pieces. We prefer the brown meat, which is more flavourful than breasts).",
      "Defrost the pastry in the fridge or at room temperature, but make sure it stays cool. If you made My Gran's Sour Cream Pastry, keep in plastic wrap in fridge until needed.",
      "Use a large pot, like a soup pot. Add the water, and then the whole chicken, any extra fat removed. Add giblets as well, if available.",
      "Sprinkle over the stock powder or granules: please note that you use the stock powder itself, not a mix made with water!",
      "Put on lid. Bring to boil, turn down heat, keep lid on, and boil chicken gently until almost tender, about 45 minutes.",
      "Then soak the sago granules in a little warm water -- they swell a little -- and add, stirring it into the water around the chicken.",
      "Simmer with lid on until chicken flesh almost falls from bones, and the sago has turned into translucent little pearls.",
      "Take chicken out of the sauce and leave in a dish to cool down. Leave the sauce in the pot, but give the bottom a good scrape to loosen the bits that stick. Bits of meat can stay in the sauce, just lift out any bones with a slotted spoon: the wing tips often fall off into the sauce.",
      "When the chicken and sauce have both cooled down enough, take all the bones from the chicken, and cut up the meat. This is a messy job, but be careful to remove all small bones. Use ALL meat and skin. Don't cut up meat too finely -- bite-sized. Rub soft meat and skin off carcass and wings so you use it all.",
      "Then, with a slotted spoon, remove remaining meaty bits from the sauce in the pot, and add all edibles to the chicken meat, discarding small bones. Don't worry about the sauce in the pot: it will still have bits in it.",
      "Add the flour to the sauce, and whisk in smoothly. A wire whisk usually does the job with no lumps remaining. Add all the flavourings to the sauce, and taste the result -- chickens differ, flavourings differ. Adjust to your taste. Be especially careful not to oversalt, so taste before you add the salt. (Some chicken stock powders are salty, others not).",
      "Beat the eggs in a bowl, and add to the sauce.",
      "Now add the chopped chicken to the pot again. Stir through with wooden spoon. Taste again: you might want more seasoning at this stage, and you can also add a touch of chilli, if you like.",
      "Set oven at 220 deg C (425 deg F).",
      "On a floured board, roll pastry out thinner (if necessary) and to fit the top of your dish. Beat an extra egg in a small bowl.",
      "Using a suitable oven dish, scrape the chicken with its sauce into the dish.",
      "Slice up the ham, and scatter over the top. This filling should come up to within 1 1/2 inch, or 3 cm from the top of the dish.",
      "Paint the edges of the dish with beaten egg to help the pastry stick, then cover loosely with the puff pastry. Do NOT stretch: leave a bit of slack, as the pastry will shrink as it bakes. Press the edges neatly with your fingers all around the dish, then cut off excess pastry with scissors or a sharp knife.",
      "Brush the pastry with the extra beaten egg. Put into the hot oven. After 15 minutes, turn heat down to 180 deg C (350 deg F) and bake for about 1 hour or until pastry is puffed up and golden, and you can see the filling sizzling underneath (if using a glass dish).",
      "Suggested side dishes: South African Yellow Rice or roast potatoes, steamed green beans, sweet potatoes, and a tomato salad.",
      "Although the recipe sounds long, it's really worth making and it's a favourite with every age group."

      "Note: The original recipe doesn't call for seasoning the chicken prior to browning, but I prefer the way the salt and pepper penetrates at this level. Also, I cut the breasts in half. Proceede by putting the oil in a wide, heavy pan over medium-high heat. When the oil is hot, put in as many chicken pieces as the pan will hold in a single layer and brown on both sides. It's not necessary to deeply brown because of the additional cook time later and they may become dry. Remove the chicken pieces with a slotted spoon and put them in a bowl. Sear all the chicken pieces this way.",
      "Add the garlic to the hot oil. As soon as the pieces turn a medium-brown color, turn heat to medium and pour in the ginger paste. Stir-fry it for a minute. Add the fresh coriander, jalapeno, cayenne, cumin, coriander, turmeric and salt. Stir and cook for a minute.",
      "Put in all the chicken pieces as well as any liquid that might have accumulated in the chicken bowl. Add 2/3 cup water and the lemon juice. Stir and bring to a boil. Cover tightly, turn heat to low and cook for 15 minutes.",
      "Turn the chicken pieces over. Cover again and cook another 10 to 15 minutes or until the chicken is tender. If the sauce is too thin, uncover the pan and boil some of it away over a slightly higher heat.",
      "Serve with basmati rice."
