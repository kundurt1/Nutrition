      "I started by sauteing the onions until soft then added the mince, half the curry powder, half the garlic and the bell pepper I then cooked until all the mince was cooked.",

      "There should also be enough pastry left to make two small cups and two small rolls which you should shape like below.",
      "Place the pies in the oven at around 200'c for around 25 minutes, they will be done when they are crispy and browned slightly.",
      "Remove from oven and trays and allow to cool for 5 minutes.",
      "When serving fill the small pastry bowls with the Hot sauce and decorate with parsley.",
      "When serving the cooler of the pies the hot sauce makes for a nice flavour contrast on the plate.",
