      "Process for a few more secondsand add more flour if necessaryuntil a fairly firm ball of dough forms.",
      "Turn the dough out on a lightly floured surface, and knead by hand for a minute or more, until it is smooth and firm.",

      "Press the dough into a disk, wrap tightly in plastic wrap, and let rest at room temperature for at least 1/2 hour.",
      "(You can refrigerate the dough for up to a day, or freeze for a month or more.",
      "Defrost in the refrigerator, and return to room temperature before rolling.)",
      "Cut the dough in four equal pieces.",
      "If using a pasta machine: Roll each piece through the machine at progressively thinner settings, to form long wide strips, about 1/8 inch thick (no thinner) and as wide as your machine allows.",
      "If the strip grows longer than the strings of your chitarra, cut it crosswise into two shorter strips.",
      "To roll by hand: Lightly flour the work surface and your rolling pin.",
      "Flatten each piece of dough into a rectangle with your palm, and roll it from the center, gradually lengthening it into a broad strip about 1/8 inch thick.",
      "Dont roll the dough too thin or longer or wider than the strings of your chitarra.",
      "To cut maccheroni: Lay a strip of dough over the strings of the chitarra (on a two-sided chitarra, use the more widely spaced strings).",
      "Using gentle but constant pressure, roll your pin lengthwise up and down the pasta, so the strings cut it cleanly into strands of maccheroni that fall onto the tray of the chitarra.",
      "Dust the freshly cut strands with flour, and gather them into a loose nest on a floured tray.",
      "Cut all the strips into maccheroni, and collect them in floured nests.",
      "Leave the tray uncovered at room temperature until you are ready to cook the pasta.",
      "To cook a whole batch of maccheroni: Bring to boiling a large pot of well-salted water (at least 6 quarts with a tablespoon or more of salt).",
      "Using your hand or a colander, shake excess flour off the nests of maccheroni, and drop them into the pot.",
      "Stir and separate the strands as the water returns to a rolling boil, then cook the pasta for 4 to 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until al dente.",
      "(See the many sauce recipes that follow for instructions on dressing maccheroni alla chitarra.)",
      "To freeze the cut maccheroni: Set the whole tray in the freezer.",
      "When the nests are solid, seal them in airtight plastic bags and pack in a container, so they dont get crushed.",
      "(Frozen maccheroni can be dropped right into the pasta cooking pot; stir gently to separate the strands as they soften.)",
      "Some of you are probably wondering, Do I really need an imported chitarra to make this maccheroni?",
      "I say yes.",
      "You and your family will find it great fun to cut pasta dough through a chitarra and then enjoy the pleasures that only fresh homemade maccheronis distinctive textural character can give.",
      "Fortunately, it is now easy to find and purchase a sturdy chitarra (some made in Abruzzo) for under $50 in the United States.",
      "I recommend a traditional chitarra, with two sets of strings on the frame, which allows you to cut very thin pasta strands (especially nice for cooking in soups) as well as perfect thick, four-sided maccheroni.",
      "Make them once, and I am certain you will use your chitarra often!",
      "(And remember that, just as a guitar needs to be tuned before playing, so does the maccheroni chitarra.",
      "Before each use, pluck on the strings and make sure they are taut and properly set in their notches on the chitarra frame.",
      "Most chitarre have instructions for tightening the strings, usually a simple matter of turning the knobs that hold them.)",
      "If you dont yet have a chitarra, though, you can make the pasta dough, roll it, and cut strands with the cutting attachment of your pasta machine or by hand.",
      "And if you only have dry pasta, you can certainly use what you have in place of fresh maccheroni with any of my sauce recipes.",
      "Spaghetti or linguine will always work well, and recently Ive noticed that many top pasta manufacturers now make long dry spaghetti alla chitarra, with thick, square-cut strands that resemble maccheroni cut on a chitarra.",
      "Although they will never replace homemade maccheroni in my kitchen, they are a fine pasta to use in any of the recipes here.",
      "The resourceful cooks of Abruzzo are never at a loss for quick and delicious ways to dress maccheroni alla chitarra or the excellent dry pastas made in the region.",
      "As these recipes for uncooked dressings show, they can take whatevers on handlocally pressed olive oil, a few cloves of garlic, their beloved hot pepper, a cluster of fresh herbs, a pinch of saffron, a handful of nuts, or other native ingredientsand produce a wonderful sauce in minutes.",
      "The foundation for these simple saucesand the endless variations you might enjoy in Abruzzois the distinctive fruity olive oils of the region.",
      "Extra-virgin oils from the provinces of Teramo, Pescara, and Chieti have achieved DOP (name-protected) status and are available here (see Sources, page 387).",
      "Certainly these superb oils will give your maccheroni (or other pasta) a truly authentic Abruzzese flavor, but any top-quality Italian extra-virgin olive oil will make a delicious sauce, too.",
      "Please dont limit your enjoyment of these sauces to pasta, because they are marvelously versatile condiments for meats, fish, poultry, and vegetables, too.",
      "They need only a whirl in the food processor and they will keep for weeks.",
