(It reminds me of making dough.) You will need to work fast while the potato is still warm so that the powdered sugar will mix with the potato. Put the mixture on a piece of wax paper and flatten (just like rolling dough to make biscuits). You will then spread peanut butter on the flattened mixture and then roll it like a pen wheel.
