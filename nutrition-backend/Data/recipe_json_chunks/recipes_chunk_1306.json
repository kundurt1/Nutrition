Once you have done that you will then cut the stem and seeds out of each jalapeno. When finished, you can rinse them off the make sure there is no seeds sticking to the pepper. Then take your package of cream cheese and begin to fill the jalapenos, you may use a spoon, but I've found it easier just to use your fingers to pinch off a decent size of cream cheese and press it down in the jalapeno to fill it up. You may have some cream cheese left over, so refrigerate the remaining cream cheese. Then you will need to take your package of bacon and pull out 6 pieces of bacon and cut them in half. Once cut in half, wrap the bacon around the jalapenos. You may stick tooth picks in them to hold the bacon together on the jalapenos. (optional) Place them on a baking sheet. Once your oven is pre-heated to 425 degrees, place them in the oven and let them cook for about 20 mins, or until you think the bacon is cooked. Remove from oven and let them cool for about 5 minutes. This will serve 4 people, with each person getting 3 Jalapeno poppers. Hope you enjoy!"

Use a large dinner plate or two to help submerge the floating peanuts. Allow to soak for 8 hours or overnight. (This step saves a little time boiling, and thus fuel, but if you don't have the luxury of time, skip this step. Skip it also if you're using green peanuts.)",

Bring to a boil, reduce the heat to low, and simmer, covered, for 6 to 8 hours (or 2 to 3 hours for green peanuts), keeping the water in the pot within an inch or so of its original level with regular additions of water, until the peanuts are soft as a roasted chestnut or softer.",
      "When the peanuts have boiled for 3 hours (or 1 hour for green peanuts), sample them to check their texture and salinity. Remove a peanut, and when it is cool enough to handle, crack open the shell and give the kernel a chew, slurping some brine with it. If the peanut crunches, it should be cooked further. If the brine lacks enough salt, add by 1/4-cup amounts; if it is too salty, remove a portion of the water and replace with the same volume of fresh water. Allow an hour for the salinity to equalize before testing again. Sample every hour until the peanuts are pleasantly yielding and as salty and appetizing as a good pickle.",
      "When the peanuts are cooked to your satisfaction, turn off the heat and allow them to cool in the pot for an hour (or 30 minutes for green peanuts). When cool enough to handle, drain and eat immediately or store in the shell, in a sealed container, in the refrigerator or freezer. (Boiled peanuts will keep for 7 to 10 days in the refrigerator and for several months in the freezer.)"
