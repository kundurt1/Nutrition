      "Stuffing -- Add the orange, onion, butter and herb mix to the cavity of the hens.",
      "Skin -- Brush each of the hens with 1/4 cup of butter (not melted) and season with salt and pepper.",
      "Bake -- Place each of the hens on a couple of the onions slices in a small oven proof pan. The onion slices just make a natural baking rack so they don't sit directly on the pan itself. Bake at 425 for 10 minute and then reduce to 350 for about 20-30 minutes uncovered. NOTE: One reviewer wrote they were swimming in butter, but if you bake the hens on the onions used as a rack as suggested, they are not sitting in butter. The butter flavors the inside and outside, and remember, it is for 2 nice size birds. Also, the onions will absorb most of the butter and the natural juices will end up in the sauce at the end.",
      "NOTE: I used around a 1 3/4 - 2 1/2 lb hen, and then can take anywhere from 30-45 minutes. So just check and have your meat thermometer handy. This is one time when it really helps. I take mine out at 160, as it continues to cook once removed. The last time I cooked 4 for dinner they took 40 minutes. But just check to be sure.",
      "Glaze -- As the hens back, in a small measuring cup add the garlic, brandy and jelly and just heat until melted. You can also do this on the stove, but the microwave is easier, quicker and just a small cup to clean out vs another pot. Baste frequently with the glaze as the chicken cook.",
      "Sauce -- No I love the sauce for this but it is optional. Remove the chickens to a plate and cover with foil to let them rest. Bring the pan to the stove on medium heat and add the wine to deglaze. Get all the good dripping off the bottom of the pan. Add the broth and cook 3-4 minutes. Right before serving, just add the butter to thicken the sauce and serve with the chicken. This isn't a thick gravy, just a nice light sauce over the chicken."

      "Place sausage casings in bowl of warm water to soak at this time, also make sure to have some twine on hand to tie the open ends off.",
      "Pour in all dry seasonings, cure, garlic powder, and peppers over the ground meat. Then top with cold water. Mix thoroughly by hand for at least 15 minutes and make sure all seasoning is mixed in and the three meats are now homogeneous. The venison will be a dark red, the bacon a light pink, and the chicken all white starting out. When it is a uniform medium red the mixing is complete. I've found that the 2 lbs of bacon and chicken add just the right amount of fat content to the deer that it will still preserve well, but it doesn't get dried out after opening a roll and putting it back in the fridge.",
      "(I make my own homemade chipotle powder as well. I smoke assorted hot peppers out of my garden in the summer and then dehydrate them for a couple days. Then I grind them into pepper flakes with a food processor. They keep for a couple years if dried out all the way and then placed in an air tight container.)",
      "Stuffing the sausage in casings is a 2 person job no mater how you do it, so make sure you have a friend handy. Add the sausage tube to the grinder and slide the casing over to fill while the 2nd person feeds the meat mixture into the machine. Make sure to use a firm grip as the casings are filled, this makes the meat pack in nicely and keeps out air bubbles. When a casing is about an inch and a half from the end, stop, twist, and tie off the end of the casing with the twine. Once all the casings are filled, place in the refrigerator for about 24 hours to cure.",
      "On the next day remove the sausages from the fridge and allow to warm up while you are making your smoker fire. I use a combination of charcoal and oak for the main fire and then add some hickory to add flavor to it. Apple wood works great for this too if you can find it available. Fill the water pan 3/4 full and then add a beer to top it off. Make sure any lighter fluid is burned off and that it is smoking cleaning before adding the sausages. Hang them from the top rack and make sure there is clearance between them and the water pan. Leave in the smoker for about 4 hours and check the temperature. My little smoker doesn't burn very hot, so I always end up pulling them and finishing them off in the oven at 325 for 30 to 40 minutes at the end. They are done when they reach an internal temp of 155 to 160.",
      "Allow to cool, and then wipe each sausage down with a paper towel and wrap in plastic wrap. Once cured and cooked they will keep in the fridge for 2 to 3 weeks if they last that long. 15 lbs of meat at one time sounds like a lot, but some how all my friends and neighbors find out every time I make this and then it is gone before I know it."

      "In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the butter and sugar on high speed until light and fluffy. Scrape down the sides of the bowl.",
      "In a large bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda and sea salt and set aside.",
      "With the mixer on low speed, add the eggs one at a time until fully incorporated; add vanilla extract.",
      "With the mixer on low speed, add one third of the flour mixture, then half of the buttermilk. Add a third of the flour, the remainder of the milk and finally the last third of flour mixture; mix until a smooth creamy batter forms, no longer than one minute. Fold in any remaining bits of flour by hand if need be.",
      "Divide the batter evenly between the prepared cake pans. Bake in the center rack of the oven for 22-25 minutes, checking at 22 minutes for doneness. Cakes will be done when a toothpick inserted in the middle comes out with moist crumbs. Set on wire racks to cool completely.",
      "Vanilla Buttercream:",
      "This can be tinted any shade of skin tone you wish. You could also use chocolate buttercream! I used a tiny bit of \"warm brown gel colour\" by Americolor to emulate a tanned California lady.",
      "Gel color in \"skin tone\" (whichever skin tone that might be) and gel color in pink, turquoise, purple, green and whatever colors you might like for your buttercream flower crown.",
      "In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter, icing sugar, vanilla and pinch of salt on high speed until light and fluffy and doubled in volume, about two minutes. Cover the mixer bowl with a damp paper towel to keep the icing sugar from tornado-ing your kitchen.",
      "Divide the buttercream in half. One half stays in the mixer; the other half can be divided amongst smaller bowls to be tinted for the buttercream flowers.",
      "Add the skin tone color to the buttercream in the stand mixer and beat on high to combine.",
      "Level your cooled cake layers, fill and frost the entire cake to the crumb coat stage - chill in freezer for 10 minutes.",
      "Remove the cake from the freezer and apply a smooth coat to finish. Set cake aside.",
      "Decorating supplies and equipment:",
      "White and black fondant for eyes, purple fondant for eyeshadow (optional), pink fondant for lips; lemon cookie cutter, piping tips used as cutters, or sharp paring knife to make the face shapes.",
      "Piping bags fitted with a large petal tip such as Wilton 125, open star tip 1M, French open star multi-pronged tips and a leaf tip. A flower nail and parchment paper squares for making the buttercream roses.",
      "Create Your Fondant Face:",
      "On a nonstick work surface or piece of parchment paper, roll out the white fondant to 1/8 inch thick and punch out an eye shape using the lemon cookie cutter. Roll out the pink fondant to 1/2 inch thick and punch out the same shape using the same cutter; this time use a paring knife to cut out the divot on the top of the lips and gently indent a line across for mouth opening. Use the black or purple fondant for eyeshadow and eyelashes - roll out out to 1/8 inch thickness and use paring knife to cut shapes. Punch out a circle for the eye iris. Adhere fondant pieces together with a tiny amount of water as glue.",
      "Place the eyes and lips on the cake by gently pressing into the buttercream. Set cake aside.",
      "Tint the smaller bowls of buttercream with your favourite colours by adding gel colour to the bowls and mixing with small spatula or spoon. Fill piping bags fitted with various piping tips! Now we're going to make a buttercream rose.",
      "Using your piping bag fitted with a Wilton 125 petal tip, hold the piping bag in your dominant hand and the flower nail in your other hand. Add a tiny bit of buttercream to the nail then place a piece of parchment paper square on top. Now, look at the piping tip opening - it is like a teardrop shape. The bottom of the teardrop will be against the nail. Start piping in a tight circle while turning the nail, forming a rosette-like center. Now, pipe in an up-and-down motion to create the petals, going around the rosette, overlapping each petal. Add another row of petals if you like. Remove the rose and parchment paper from the nail and set on a plate; fill the plate with roses then freeze the plate until the roses are firm and easy to handle, about ten minutes.",
      "Artistic license time! Start by placing some of the roses you made on the cake where the flower crown would go. Use your other piping bags to make drop stars, rosettes and any other designs you like in alternating colours. Fill in any gaps with the leaf piping tip and little drop stars until you are happy with your gorgeous buttercream flower crown. Now light up a fat one and get ready to boogie with some holograms!"

Finally add the evaporated milk (condensed milk is too thick and sweet) - stir, then turn the heat up to a medium heat and simmer for two minutes - we want the mixture to bubble but not boil or burn, stir frequently.",

After two minutes turn off the heat and allow to completely cool. The butterscotch syrup should still be runny and not taste too 'sweet' and this is how we want it, the added sugar from the ginger beer and cream soda will balance things out nicely. It will thicken as it cools, but a good stir will loosen it up before use. This can be made up a few days in advance, if it has thickened in the meantime stir in a drop of milk to loosen it.

      "To make chocolate cases: melt 200g ( 7 oz) chocolate over a pan of warm water, do not overheat, when three quarters of it is melted, remove from heat and stir vigorously, this should distribute the heat and melt the remaining chocolate without it getting too hot and going \"grainy\".",
      "Take a small teaspoon of melted chocolate and \" paint\" the inside of your mini muffin paper or the insides of your silicone ice block forms. If coverage is a bit skimpy don't panic. these set in the fridge in minutes and a second coat is easier and works better than trying to get one very thick coat. Put them in the fridge to harden. Reserve enough of your chocolate to cover the bottom of your forms once they have been filled with the ganache filling.",

      "This does thicken up over time, and good chocolate is never refrigerated, just kept in a cool dry place. If these are refrigerated the filling gets very firm over time.",
      "By now your ganache filling mixture should be cool enough to put into the chocolate cases, using a piping bag or a teaspoon, fill them with the ganache, (but not quite to the very top of the chocolate case) Then put them back into the fridge for a while, and once set a little solid, put a \"top\" of melted chocolate on them to seal them closed and refrigerate until the top too is solid. I like to keep these in the fridge for a least a few hours or somewhere nice and cool overnight before I try and get them out of the forms.",
      "If using mini muffin papers, peel away the papers from the chocolates (this can be fiddly, don't press too hard as you peel them or your chocolate will break), If using the silicone ice cube forms, GENTLY easy the chocolates out of the forms, they will just pop out -- plate up and amaze your guests with these divine triumphs !"

      "You can also make these ahead and freeze them: Make the filling and seal the wontons. Place them (unbaked) on a baking sheet and stick the sheet in the freezer, until the wontons are frozen. Take the wontons off the baking sheet and put them in a Ziploc freezer bag (this way they won't stick together). When ready to bake, take as many as you need from the freezer, lightly grease a baking sheet, and bake as directed."
