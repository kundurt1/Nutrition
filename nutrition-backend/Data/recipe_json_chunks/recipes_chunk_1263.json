Wearing thick rubber gloves, dip the pudding cloth in the boiling water and boil for 1 min, then remove and carefully squeeze the excess water from the cloth. Working quickly, spread the hot cloth on the workbench and rub the flour into the center of the cloth to cover an area about 16 inches in diameter, leaving the flour a little thicker in the center of the cloth where the \"skin\" on the pudding needs to be thickest.",

Twist the ends of the cloth around the string to avoid them touching pudding. If pudding has been cooked correctly, the cloth will dry in patches within a few minutes. Leave it to hang for 10 mins.",
