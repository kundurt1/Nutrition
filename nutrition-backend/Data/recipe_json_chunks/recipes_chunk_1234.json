      "TIPS AND TRICKS:",
      "To avoid a soggy crust, try brushing the bottom of the crust with egg white before adding fruit; filling the shell *just* before baking also helps prevent sogginess; sogginess can also be caused from the oven temperature being too low or the time too short.",
      "For a flakier upper crust, brush lightly with cold water before popping in the oven; also keep ingredients and dough cold until baked.",
      "To prevent the crust from shrinking, avoid stretching the dough as you roll it and avoid stretching it when placed in the pie plate; allowing the pie shell to rest about 30 minutes before baking will also help prevent shrinking.",
      "Never shake the flour while placing in the measuring cup; instead, level it with the back of a knife.",
      "Toss ingredients with a fork, lightly and quickly, rather than stirring.",
      "Don't use too much water; about 1/2 c of iced water to 2 cups of flour.",
      "To prevent burning of the crust, try baking the pie in a large paper bag stapled closed, being sure that it doesn't touch any part of the oven; or use an oven- roasting bag.",
      "Try rolling some grated cheese into the dough when making an apple pie.",
      "Try adding toasted slivered almonds to piecrust that you intend to fill with a cream filling or cherry filling."

Then, eat 1/2 pint (6 ounce package) of blueberries in one sitting each following day for as long as needed for up to 10 days. If diarrhea persists after 10 days of treatment, see a health care provider. Note: A one pint (12 ounce package) of blueberries equals about 2 1/2 cups in a measuring cup.",
      "NUTMEG TEA REMEDY: Do not use if pregnant or breastfeeding. Do not give to toddlers or infants. DO NOT CONSUME MORE THAN 8 OUNCES OF NUTMEG TEA OR 1/2 TEASPOON NUTMEG PER 12 HOURS. On the first day of treatment, put a level 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg into a mug. Heat water to boiling and pour into mug. Cover top of mug with a saucer to keep therapeutic oils from evaporating. Steep for 15 minutes or longer. Stir in honey if using. Stir before drinking to incorporate nutmeg granules. Ground nutmeg will sink to bottom of mug so use a spoon to eat all the nutmeg granules after drinking the tea. Another 8 ounces of nutmeg tea can be consumed 12 hours later. Then, drink 8 ounces of nutmeg tea each following day for as long as needed for up to 10 days. If diarrhea persists after 10 days of treatment, see a health care provider. DO NOT CONSUME MORE THAN 8 OUNCES OF NUTMEG TEA OR 1/2 TEASPOON NUTMEG PER 12 HOURS. ALSO, DO NOT CONSUME MORE THAN 16 OUNCES TOTAL OF NUTMEG TEA OR 1 TEASPOON TOTAL OF NUTMEG PER DAY.",

CHILDREN ARE NOT TO CONSUME MORE THAN 1/8 TEASPOON TOTAL OF NUTMEG PER DAY. DO NOT GIVE TO CHILDREN THREE YEARS OLD AND UNDER.",
      "HINTS: Taking these remedies at breakfast is best because they will stop diarrhea for the rest of the day. The Banana and Blueberry Remedies usually work within 3 hours and last for 24 hours. Nutmeg Tea Remedy usually works with 30 minutes and lasts for 24 hours. You can use all three remedies per day or use only one remedy per day.",
      "EXAMPLE #1: For breakfast, I will drink 1 cup of nutmeg tea and eat 1 pint blueberries.",

Blueberry skins are high in antioxidants and fiber and contain anti-inflammatory and antiviral compounds that fight infections and boosts the immune system.

Let the loaf rise for about 90 minutes or until puffy. PREFERRED 2nd RISE METHOD: For the second rise, let rise for 1 hour then put into the refrigerator and bake the next day or so. The bread gets better texture and taste from a slow cool rise. (The prep time follows the Preferred Method.).",
      "Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F Bake the bread for about 50 to 55 minutes (tenting it lightly for the final 15 minutes), until its interior registers 190\u00b0F to 195\u00b0F on an instant-read thermometer. Remove the bread from the oven and cool it on rack."

The actual Kauai pancakes could be ordered with any combination of bananas, pineapple, and macadamia nuts. I left the mac nuts out of my recipe in order to keep it accessible to all, but do feel free to add some fairly fine chopped macadamia nuts to your pancakes for a real taste of the islands.",
      "At TipTop the yummy pancakes are served with vanilla syrup and guava preserves. Their coffee was also great while mine is pretty bad. In order to really duplicate the Hawaiian breakfast experience, something would have to be done about that!"

After kneading, on the board, apply pressure to roll your dough into a smooth oblong bread shape a little shorter than the loaf pan. Place in greased loaf pan.

Note: the actual length of time may vary according to individual slow cooker. Drain well. Stir in barbecue sauce. Serve over hamburger buns.",
      "My Note: Here's the deal folks! Most would agree that using a pork tenderloin for pulled pork is not a good idea. Cheaper cuts of pork work just the same and have tons of flavor! I used a 4 pound shoulder cut (also called Boston butt). It was only $5, whereas a 2 pound cut of tenderloin was $10! I cooked in the slow cooker for 7 hours, pulled it apart and mixed with Sweet Baby Ray's Hot and Spicy sauce, and then cooked for another hour. I served them on Kaiser rolls with coleslaw and homemade fries.",
      "I followed the recipe only adding a couple of things. Before placing the tenderloin in the slow cooker, I rubber salt, pepper, and garlic salt on it. I then used a fork to poke holes in the tenderloin so the juices could be soaked up. I added the root beer and let it cook on low for 5 1/2-6 hours. I then drained and pulled the pork apart easily with a fork. I returned the pork to the slow cooker and added the BBQ sauce and let it continue to cook on low for another 1-1 1/2 hours.",
      "I tweaked this reciped just a bit and the result was really good! I knew a 2 lb tenderloin would never be enough for my family of 6, so on the advice of the butcher at my grocery store, I used a 4 lb shoulder (it had a small bone in it, but it slid out easily after cooking on low for 10 hours. I mixed 1/2 cup of Bull's Eye Original Barbeque sauce with 2 cups of root beer then poured it over the roast, sprinkled it with a generous amount of dried minced onion, then drizzled some additional barbeque sauce over the roast. Halfway through cooking, I turned the roast over, added more minced onions and another drizzle of sauce. After 10 hours in the crock, I removed the roast, let cool slightly and then shredded it. I mixed in the rest of the barbeque sauce, some salt and a little water to moisten it and served it on a bun. The result was a restuarant quality pulled pork sandwich that my whole family enjoyed!",
      "Sometime I used a 6 pound pork shoulder and filled up my slow cooker with root beer to cover the meat. Left it in for about 10 hours. It was so tender and juicy, I could barely take it out of the slow cooker! The best thing is--7 pounds of pork shoulder was only about $10! The means you can make enough pulled pork sandwiches to feed about 30 people for about $15-20! And they will be raving about it and ask for the recipe too!"

Add the garlic, stir well, and cook just until fragrant - about 30 seconds to 1 minute. Add artichokes, spinach, and vermouth. Cook until liquid is absorbed, stirring occasionally, about 10 minutes.

Spread 1/3 of the artichoke mixture over the noodles, then top with 1 1/3 cups of bechamel sauce, and cover the bechamel with 1/3 of the mozzarella slices.

      "Mix 4 tablespoons fresh cilantro, chopped garlic and 1 1/4 teaspoons cumin in bowl. Rub mixture all over hens. Wash your hands well with soap and hot water.",
      "Whisk together port, sherry, oil, vinegar, and honey in small bowl. Taste it to see if the mixture is to your taste, then if it is, pour over hens. (There is quite a difference between the taste of balsamic vinegar - which is sweet - and red wine vinegar, so if you use wine vinegar you'll definitely want to taste the mixture and adjust the amount of honey to your preference before pouring it over the hens.).",
      "Tuck dates and olives between hens and season with salt and pepper.",
      "Cover and refrigerate at least 12 hours or overnight, turning hens once. (I've made this recipe beginning in the morning and marinated it 6-8 hrs during the day, too, and it was still delicious.).",
      "Remove hens from refrigerator and place on counter, covered, for at least 30 minutes. (You don't want to put a chilled baking dish straight into a preheated oven.) Preheat oven to 375 degrees.",
      "Turn the hens skin side up, then bake hens with marinade, dates and olives until hens are cooked through, basting occasionally, about 40 minutes.",
      "Transfer hens, dates and olives to serving platter. Discard orange slices. Pour the pan juices into a heavy small saucepan.",
      "Add remaining 1/4 teaspoon cumin and 1 tsp butter and simmer until reduced to about half, whisking frequently, about 5 minutes.",
      "Season to taste with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Spoon some sauce over hens. Sprinkle with remaining 2 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro.",
      "Serve, passing remaining sauce separately in a gravy or sauce bowl.",
      "Note: when I first made this recipe, I didn't have fresh cilantro on hand, and couldn't even find dried in our herb stash, which surprised me. Mike collects herbs and spices, and we have a huge collection in the pantry. (I call him Condiment Man.) I had a bunch of a nice Italian dried herb mix (basil, oregano, marjoram, thyme, rosemary, savory, sage), so used that instead. I know it's not really an equivalent to cilantro, but it smelled wonderful anyhow and it tasted great, too. I also add lots more green olives and dates, which the recipe reflects :)",
      "Note #2: if you want/need to serve more than two people, you can use the above marinade for up to 6 hens, then you'll need to begin adding more ingredients."
