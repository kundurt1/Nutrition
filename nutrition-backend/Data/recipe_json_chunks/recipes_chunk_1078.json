      "Place the muslin parcel of pips in the bowl with the sliced lemons in their juice and add 2.8 litres of fresh water. Give the mixture a bit of a stir-about, and leave covered in a clean t-towel overnight so that the acidity of the liquid will soften the skins.",

Place them on a baking tray (open top ends up) with the lids (top sides up) on a separate tray in an oven pre-heated to 150 degrees Celsius for about 20 minutes to half an hour.",
      "You should also 'warm' your sugar. With about half an hour to go before the lemons are ready, weigh it out and put it in the oven at about 150 degrees Celsius in a large flat dish.",
      "After the lemons in the saucepan have been boiled to the point where they are soft and translucent, add the sugar, citric acid and the lavender seeds with a knob of butter (this helps to stop it burning, according to my mum) and bring to a rolling boil, which is a gentle boil that isn't too violent - think of gently churning rapids downstream from a large waterfall. Stir occasionally and let everything boil for another fifteen to twenty minutes or so until it starts to set. You should use your thermometer for this stage to check the temperature. The marmalade will start to set at around 106 degrees Celsius.",
      "When it reaches this stage, and you see it starting to thicken, you need to do the frozen saucer test.",
      "Take your saucer from the freezer and drip a little drop of the marmalade onto it. Leave it for a few seconds and then gently push it with your fingertip. If the marmalade is ready it should have formed a thin skin on top and you should be getting wrinkles when you apply pressure. It may still seem to be too liquid for spreading on your toast, but if there is a very thin skin with wrinkles you are good to go. The mixture will thicken/ solidify a bit more once it cools. This is the trickiest stage of the process, so do keep your eyes peeled.",
      "Anyway if you haven't reached this point let the mixture boil on for another three or four minutes and test again. Keep going until you get that skin-and-wrinkle-thing happening on your saucer, but be really careful as it can easily burn if it overheats (and, believe me, cleaning the bottom of the saucepan when it does is a nightmare job).",
      "When the magic point arrives (skin and wrinkles on the saucer) take the saucepan straight off the heat, and let everything sit for about 10 minutes before starting to bottle it into the jars. This slight cooling should result in the optimum amount of peel being dispersed through the mix rather than all settling at the bottom of the jars.",
      "Remove your little parcel of pips and fill each jar to the neck. I use my oven gloves and a soup ladle that I've washed down with boiling water for this part of the operation. Then place a disk of waxed paper on top, and put on the lids.",
      "When the jars have cooled down label and store."

      "(Although Mrs. Salander does not do this, you can also make the dough in a food processor, pulsing it until it is as smooth as possible.) On a table or other flat surface that is at least 3 feet by 5 feet, spread a clean sheet or old tablecloth so that the edges hang slightly over the sides.",
      "Sprinkle the sheet with flour and roll out the dough to form a 9 X 11 inch rectangle.",
      "Then with your fingers press the dough out as thin as possible, trying not to make any tears in the dough.",
      "Then, using your hands, start stretching from the center, drawing your fingers over the entire length of the dough, manipulating it from underneath, and gently lifting the dough with your fingertips until you can read a newspaper through it.",
      "The novice may want to ask a friend to help stretch the dough.",
      "When you are finished, the dough will cover the entire table's surface.",
      "Try to minimize the number of holes, but a few won't matter.",
      "Pull off any thickened edge of unstretched dough.",

      "Sprinkle the apples with the sugar and cinnamon.",
      "Drop dollops of jam over the apples.",
      "Sprinkle the cake crumbs over the rest of the dough-- this will keep the layers separate-- and drizzle the oil over the same stretched dough.",
      "Taking hold of the sheet on the 5-foot side, lift the sheet up and over the apples to start rolling up the dough jelly-roll style.",
      "When completely rolled, roll the strudel back and forth to gently seal.",
      "It will be about 3 inches in diameter.",
      "Take a little oil in your hands and rub on the tob and sides of the strudel.",

      "Using your hands, gently lift one half of the strudel on the sheet or pan and then carefully transfer the rest onto the cookie sheet.",

      "In you break it in half make sure to seal the ends.",
      "If desired, you can freeze the strudel at this point.",
      "Bake in a preheated 375 degree oven on the top rack of the oven for 45 minutes or until golden.",
