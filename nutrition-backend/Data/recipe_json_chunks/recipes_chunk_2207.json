      "Resume mixing on the lowest speed or by hand, gradually adding the sugar in 1/2-tablespoon increments; wait until each addition of sugar has been thoroughly incorporated before adding the next.",
      "The dough should now be smoother, though still very soft and sticky.",
      "Increase the mixer speed to medium-low or stir by hand more vigorously and mix for 5 minutes to develop the gluten, stopping a few times to scrape down the sides of the bowl and the paddle or spoon.",
      "Switch to the dough hook and mix on medium-low speed or continue mixing by hand, gradually adding the butter in 1-tablespoon (0.5 oz / 14 g) increments; again, waiting until each addition is thoroughly incorporated before adding the next piece.",
      "Scrape down the sides of the bowl and the hook or spoon as needed.",
      "If using a mixer, you can increase the speed to medium-high to incorporate the butter more quickly.",
      "It should take about 5 minutes to work in all of the butter, and at the end the dough should be shiny, soft, sticky if squeezed, and very supple, with a nice pillowlike feel to it when formed into a ball.",
      "Scrape the bowl down and mix on medium speed or by hand for 5 minutes more to fully develop the gluten; you should be able to pull out long, taffylike strands of dough.",
      "Add the dried fruit, then mix on the lowest speed with the dough hook, or by hand, for 1 or 2 minutes to evenly distribute the fruit.",
      "If the fruit was soaked overnight, drain off any excess liquid and fold the fruit in by hand.",
      "In this case, you may need to add about 3 1/2 tablespoons (1 oz / 28.5 g) of bread flour to compensate for the moisture in the fruit.",
      "Use a wet bowl scraper or spatula to transfer the dough to a lightly floured work surface, then dust the top of the dough with flour.",

      "Weigh out the desired size of pieces, form them into balls, and place in oiled molds or pans.",
      "Depending on the type of bread youre making, the dough will either double or triple in size as it rises.",
      "If using a full-size pandoro pan or panettone mold, youll need about 24 ounces (680 g) of dough, which will fill the mold one-third full.",
      "If using smaller molds, including popover molds, use however much dough is required to fill each mold one-third full.",
      "Let the panettone rise for 12 hours.",
      "You can also refrigerate the dough and bake it anytime during the next 4 days, but the rising time will be quite long, closer to 14 hours.",
      "About 15 minutes before baking, preheat the oven to 350F (177C).",
      "For loaves weighing more than 1 1/2 pounds, preheat the oven to 325F (163C).",
      "The baking time will vary depending on the size of the panettone, ranging from 30 minutes for smaller shapes to 45 minutes or longer for large loaves.",
      "The panettone is done when it is a golden brown on all sides, when the loaf sounds hollow when thumped on the bottom, and when the internal temperature is about 185F (85C) in the center.",
      "It should still feel slightly soft and tender if squeezed but will firm up as it cools.",
      "Cool in the pan for at least 5 minutes before removing; if baked in paper panettone molds, it isnt necessary to remove the paper.",
      "Large panettone should be cooled upside down on a wire rack, and any form of panettone should be cooled thoroughly before serving.",
      "Many bakers insist that panettone needs at least 8 to 14 hours of cooling, but 3 hours should be sufficient.",
      "If using dried fruit, such as raisins, dried cranberries, or dried cherries, you can simply add them to the dough as directed, or soak them overnight in rum, brandy, or liqueur, using 1 tablespoon (0.5 oz / 14 g) of liqueur for every 3 tablespoons (1 oz / 28.5 g) of fruit.",
      "You can also make your own soaking syrup by bringing 1/2 cup (4 oz / 113 g) of sugar and 1/2 cup (4 oz / 113 g) of water to a boil to make a simple syrup.",
      "When it cools, add 1 teaspoon (0.16 oz / 4.5 g) of orange or lemon extract, and 1 teaspoon (0.16 oz / 4.5 g) of vanilla and 1 teaspoon (0.16 oz / 4.5 g) of almond extract (optional).",
      "Add the fruit to the syrup and let it soak overnight.",
      "Another excellent option for flavoring the fruit is Fiori di Sicilia.",
      "This wonderfully aromatic and delicious essence that combines vanilla and citrus is available from King Arthur Flour and other suppliers of specialty ingredients.",
      "If you soak the fruit using either of these methods, strain off the the excess liquid, then fold the fruit into the dough by hand, along with about 3 1/2 tablespoons (1 oz / 28.5 g) of extra bread flour.",
      "You can decorate the top of the baked panettone with white fondant glaze (see page 144), or any other glaze that you like.",
      "This recipe makes exquisite brioche as well as holiday bread.",
      "For brioche, simply omit the fruit.",
      "(See below for instructions on shaping brioche a tete.)",
      "For an extra treat, top the brioche with streusel (see page 154) before baking.",
      "Another option is to use the dough as a tartlet shell and fill it with clafouti, a fruit-filled custard.",
      "To shape brioche a tete, roll one end of a small ball of dough (typically 1 1/2 to 2 ounces or 42.5 to 56.5 grams) into a cylindrical cone.",
