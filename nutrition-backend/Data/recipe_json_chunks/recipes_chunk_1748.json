      "This recipe is only a general guideline; specific measures are of no importance with crepes -- most important is the consistency, which should be that of fluid cream.",
      "Batters that contain relatively little flour in relation to the eggs will make more tender crepes; the substitution of cream for part of the milk will make them even more tender, moist and delicate but will also make them so fragile that they are difficult to work with, often tearing when being turned.",
