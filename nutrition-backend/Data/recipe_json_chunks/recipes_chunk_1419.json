Brian's wish to demystify wine for the consumer results in the restaurant's creative, approachable list of 50 wines by the glass and almost 400 by the bottle. Working closely with California winemakers, Brian created BIN 36 Brian's Blends--a collection of 12 (and counting) wine blends--to pair with food or enjoy on their own. Here, Brian selects wines to accompany this Asian-inspired dish.",

Transfer to a bowl and cover with plastic wrap for a few minutes. Remove and discard the skins. Slice the poblanos into long, thin strips and place in a medium bowl. In a blender, pulse the jalapeno, cilantro, lime juice, honey, and 3/4 teaspoon of the salt to combine. With the motor running, slowly add 1/4 cup of the oil and mix until a smooth vinaigrette forms. Heat the remaining oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Season the fish with the remaining salt and the pepper. Cook until the fish is opaque throughout, about 5 minutes per side. Add the poblanos and chips to the lettuce, drizzle with the vinaigrette, and toss. Serve alongside the fish.",
