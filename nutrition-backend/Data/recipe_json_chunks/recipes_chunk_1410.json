      "Heat up the heavy pot in which you will cook your ragu over medium flame. Place the skin pieces fat side down in the pot. Remain vigilant. Render as much fat as you can from the skin, working vigilantly. Duck fat has a low smoke point so don't let the skin pieces burn or you will have to discard the oil and start over, because your ragu will be very bitter if you fail to pay attention. When you think you have rendered as much fat as possible remove the skins and set aside. There should be a lot of fat here. Off heat ladle out all but about 2 tbs of that fat. But ladle that stuff into a jar or something and refrigerate. It's like holding a little bit of gold in your fridge. Great for frying potatoes in, so don't waste it.",
      "Return the pot to heat and add your mise. Season with salt and pepper as you go. Give it some color and push to the back of the pot.

Also, I kind of like to toss at least one piece of that skin into the ragu as it simmers down, just amping up the duck flavor. You don't have to serve it, you can discard it like a bay leaf after, but you might want to consider the technique.",
      "....the recommended pasta, \"Rustichella d'Abruzzo\" is the best dried pasta in all of Italy. Their extruded shapes are still made using bronze (as opposed to Teflon) dies. It's more expensive than Ronzoni or Barilla of course but worth it. If you are an able hand at making pappardelle from scratch, by all means go at it. I do from time to time. But this is one of those cases where the pasta is so good that you shouldn't have to bother. Probably 90% of the ristoranti, trattorie, osterie in Italy use commercial pasta. I can name some that don't."

      "Wash the asparagus, and then peel or cut off the tough bottoms; discard. Blanche the asparagus in simmering water for 2 minutes, just until they turn bright green and become a little tender. Immediately move them to an ice bath, to arrest cooking. Dry the asparagus, chop it up, and move it to the bowl of a food processor. Similarly, wash the spinach, and then blanche that too (you can use the same water). Try to squeeze as much moisture out of the spinach as possible. Move the drained spinach to the food processor, also. Chop the chives, and add them to the food processor as well.",
      "Add the pine nuts, the cheese, the black pepper, the salt, and the lemon juice and zest to the food processor. Turn on the machine, and pour in the olive oil in one steady stream. When the pesto is blended to a fairly smooth consistency, give it a taste; adjust the seasoning as necessary.",
      "Halve, and then thinly slice, the onion. Peel the potatoes. Slice them in half, lengthwise, and then cut all four halves crosswise, quite thinly. (You want thick-ish, half moon potato chips.)",
      "Pour the olive oil into an 8-inch pan; warm the oil over low heat. Add the onion, and saute for 1-2 minutes. Add the potato, and stir gently to coat with the olive oil. Cook for about 15-20 minutes, until the potatoes are soft but not browned. (Since I cut the potatoes quite thinly, some pieces fell apart as I stirred occasionally; it's not the end of the world.)",
      "Crack the eggs into a large bowl, and scramble them with a fork or whisk. Add the salt and pepper, along with the cooked potatoes and onion. Tent the bowl with plastic wrap, and let it sit for a while; the warm potatoes will release starch into the egg mix, everything will marry together, and the resulting omelette texture will be soft and lovely. (I left the bowl on the countertop for 1 hour, but any longer than that, move the bowl to the fridge.)",
      "---------------------------------------",
      "In the same pan you used to cook the potatoes, heat 1 more tablespoon of olive oil over low heat. Stir another 1/4 cup of minced chives into the reserved egg mixture, and then pour that into the pan. Use a spatula to swirl in 1/4-1/2 cup of the pesto. Cook the omelette on medium-low heat for about 20 minutes, or until the oil is bubbling gently around the edges of the pan, and the egg looks almost set.",
      "Now comes the tricky part: you need to flip the tortilla. Turn off the range, and put on some oven mitts. Lay a large plate (it has to be larger than the pan) face down across the pan. Carefully, flip the pan upside down, so that the omelette falls onto the plate. Place the pan back onto the range, and turn the heat back on. Using a spatula to aid you, slide the omelette back into the pan. Cook the tortilla for another 5-7 minutes. Finish with a sprinkle of Maldon sea salt."

    "title": "tender pork loin with herb sauce",
    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "1. Preheat your oven to 350\u00b0F. Heat 1 1/2 tsp olive oil over medium-high heat in a dutch oven for 1 minute, and then add your pork loin, browning on each side for about a minute each.",
      "2. Push your pork loin off to the side of the dutch oven and add 1 Tbsp flour and all of your dried spices to the pot, and cook for 1 minute while stirring frequently. In the summer months, when there are fresh herbs available at my CSA, I use fresh for the recipe by just doubling the amounts for the garlic and all of the herbs.",
      "3. Add 1 C of white wine to the dutch oven, while scraping the bottom of the pot with a wooden spoon. This will pull delicious flavor off the bottom of the pot that was left behind from browning the pork loin and cooking the herbs. Allow the wine to simmer for 1 minute, cooking off the alcohol, and then add 2 C of chicken broth to the pot. Cover and continue to cook on the stove until the contents of your dutch oven come to a simmer.",
      "4. Place the covered dutch oven in a preheated oven and cook your pork loin for 1 hour, checking every 15 minutes to make sure the liquid at the bottom of your dutch oven isn't drying out (You should have 1 cup of liquid remaining at the end of the cooking process). If the liquid level is getting low, simply add more chicken broth 1/2 C at a time. Your need to do this will very much depend on how well your dutch oven seals.",
      "5. After one hour remove your dutch oven from the oven, and place your pork loin on a cutting board to rest while you finish your herb sauce. Once the contents of your dutch oven have stopped simmering, add 1/4 C of heavy cream to the sauce and mix well. It's important that the sauce isn't simmering or boiling at this point because the high heat will cause the cream to curdle.",
      "6. Cut your pork loin width-wise into medallions, then plate and drizzle with sauce. Garnish with 1/4 C fresh asiago and fresh cracked pepper to taste, and now you're ready to serve."

If there is a lot of liquid in the pan, cook it off on the stovetop so that all that's left in the roasting pan is lovely, gooey, sticky fond with clear turkey fat oozing over and through it. Add this fat to the fat in the measuring cup. If you have less that one cup of fat, add enough butter to bring it up to that level. Pour it back into the roasting pan. Stir in 3/4 cup flour and allow it to absorb the fat. Place the roasting pan over a low flame and let this roux cook for a full minute. Ladle in all the stock and half of the cornstarch slurry; turn the heat to medium and bring the gravy to a gentle boil, stirring constantly and scraping up the fond, for about three minutes. Adjust the consistency of the gravy by adding more of the cornstarch slurry if it's too thin or water if it's too thick, and keep in mind that the gravy will thicken as it cools. Taste; add salt a quarter-teaspoon at a time if needed, and pepper."

      "Crush cardamom pods, either with a mortar and pestle, a rolling pin, or by pulsing very briefly in a food processor. The idea is not to pulverize them, but to break up the pods and release the seeds. In a heavy-bottomed pot that will be just large enough to hold the milk and cream, place the cardamom and 2 Tablespoons sugar, and heat over medium-high while stirring occasionally. Watch carefully until sugar begins to melt. Turn down the heat if caramel seems to be bubbling rapidly. As soon as sugar begins to darken a little bit, pour in milk and cream-the sugar will seize and harden, but that's OK. Heat the milk mixture slowly, stirring to loosen caramel, until liquid begins to simmer. Throw in your pinch of salt.",
      "# Meanwhile, have the chocolate ready in a large bowl with a fine mesh strainer set over it (line with cheesecloth if need be). Whisk the remaining 1/3 cup sugar into the egg yolks. Once milk has begun to simmer, lower heat and begin whisking milk, one spoonful at a time, into yolks. Do this until about half of the milk mixture is incorporated. Next, transfer yolk mixture into the pot with the milk, and whisk to combine. Over low heat cook this mixture, not even simmering, whisking the whole time-for about 5 minutes. You want the mixture to thicken slightly and the cardamom to steep for a bit longer.",
      "# When mixture has thickened enough to coat a spoon, carefully pour it into the strainer, over chocolate, and let that sit for a few minutes (discard solids in strainer). Then, with a clean whisk, stir until smooth. Chill the ice cream mixture in the fridge several hours, until quite cold. You can place the bowl over a larger bowl with ice in the bottom, to speed up chilling and get to your ice cream sooner. Whisk it occasionally so a skin doesn't form on top. Follow the instructions specified by the manufacturer of your ice cream maker; it generally takes about 20-25 minutes of spinning for my ice cream to thicken, plus a bit longer in the freezer to firm it up."

Do not overmix or your crust will become tough.\r\nScrape down the mixer and gather the dough.Allow the dough to chill in the refrigerator for half an hour. \r\nPreheat your oven to 350 degrees F.\r\nPress about 3/4 of the dough into a 10\" tart pan with your fingers, working it into the corners and up the side of the pan. Trim off any excess dough at the top of the pan with a sharp knife and reserve it for cookies.\r\nPrick the bottom of the crust with a fork.\r\nPlace a sheet of parchment paper into the tart and fill it with dried beans or lentils or rice or pie weights.\r\nBake the pastry for 15 minutes.\r\nRemove it from the oven and carefully pour out whatever you used to fill it onto a sheet of aluminum foil or parchment. The beans or lentils or rice may be used again for this purpose.\r\nCarefully peel away the parchment and discard it.\r\nReturn the tart shell to the oven and bake for 10 minutes more, or until is it pale golden brown.\r\nAllow the pastry to cool to room temperature before filling it.",

If you have made the custard ahead of time, chill the tart after adding the layer of chocolate until it is set.\r\nPour in a layer of the vanilla custard and smooth the top.\r\nChill the tart in the refrigerator while you candy the citrus slices. If you have made them ahead, you may place them on top immediately.\r\nArrange the candied citrus slices in a pretty pattern on top of the custard.\r\nScatter a few flakes of salt on top of the tart.\r\n\r\nThis tart is best served the day it is made.

Cool 20 minutes on a wire rack, then using your finger, push up through the hole in the bottom of each cheesecake and remove each one.

The edges will normally color first, and you can swirl the pan ever so gently to distribute the color so the mixture doesn't burn. When the caramel is a golden amber color, remove it from heat. Slowly whisk in the cream a bit at a time, as the mixture will bubble over if you add too much, then whisk in the butter and finishing salt. If the caramel has hardened, place it back over medium low heat and whisk until it's smooth. Remove from heat and allow to cool.",

Sprinkle some cinnamon over the top, and drizzle the caramel sauce over that. Sprinkle with a bit more finishing salt, if desired, and enjoy! Store leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge."

Blend soup, starting at low speed and gradually increasing to high (be careful starting up, it can shoot out the top of the blender-open the vent and hold a kitchen towel over the lid to prevent blowout).

      "When buying pork belly, pay attention to the balance between layers of fat and lean meats. Fat is important in this recipe so avoid parts that are overly lean with very little fat marblings in between, but you also wouldn't want a giant fat-slab either. The size of the pork belly also matters. Make sure the length of the pork belly is long enough (at least 7?/18cm) that when cut into slices, it can cover the entire circumference of the roll. If not, the roll will \"unravel\" during cooking.",
      "Wrap the pork belly with plastic wrap and leave in the freezer to harden for at least 3 hours. Wash and clean the shiso leaves, and dry gently between two clean kitchen towels.",
      "Lay an area approx 17? x 17?/43 cm x 43 cm with plastic wrap. Remove the pork belly from the freezer and, with a VERY SHARP knife, slice the pork belly length-wise AS THINLY AS YOU HUMANLY CAN. Don't even bother doing this with a room-temperature, or even cold pork belly. The entire piece of meat needs to be borderline FROZEN, because I'm talking about slices that's no thicker than 1/16? (2 mm). You may be able to find butchers who can do this for you with an electric slicer, or purchase pork belly from Korean grocery stores that is already sliced for hot pot/BBQ. If you do, just make sure the slices are of the right size, at least 7?/18cm long, and thickness. Lay the slices on top of the plastic wrap in 3 repeated rows, only overlapping slightly on the edges. Then arrange the shiso leaves (should be completely dry, not damp) on top, again, overlapping on the edges.",
      "Start pulling up the plastic wrap from underneath and roll the entire thing like rolling a sushi, squeeze and tighten it up as TIGHTLY AS POSSIBLE as you go. Once you reach the end of it, wrap the entire roll in plastic wrap and twist one end of the it tightly, then tie up the plastic wrap in a knot. Then twist the other end, forcing the roll to be as compact as you can and tie another knot. Leave the roll in the freezer to harden for approx 2 hours. Meanwhile, soak the wooden skewer in water.",
      "Preheat the broiler on high (or you can do this on an outdoor grill). Unwrap the roll from the plastic wrap, and cut it with a SERRATED KNIFE in zig-zag motion, into 1/4? (0.5 cm) thick slices. To skewer them, make sure the point goes through near where the slices ends so it doesn't unravel during cooking. Arrange 4 slices on a skewer and repeat until done. Season them liberally with fine sea salt and freshly ground black pepper, and space them evenly on a baking rack with a sheet underneath to catch dripping. Set the rack on the upper level in the oven, only about 2?/4 cm underneath the broiler. Once the first side is nicely browned, flip them and brown the other side as well. It will only take approx 2 min on each side. If you oven tends to heat unevenly, you may need to switch positions of the skewers during cooking. Or a blow-torch comes very handy at finishing the job.\r\n\r\nSprinkle with more sea salt if needed and serve immediately."

In the middle of the rice, form a horizontal bar of 1 ounce of salmon, reaching from the left to the right edge. Sprinkle 1/4 of the sesame seeds over the rice and press down lightly. Lift up bottom edge of nori and tuck tightly over salmon,tightly rolling up maki . Spread a little water on the bare nori to help it seal.Set aside.

Using a wooden spoon or a plastic spatula work the flour into the beaten butter. At first the mixture will seem impossibly dry and as though the dough will never absorb all the flour, but just persevere, sooner or later almost all of the butter will have been absorbed into the dough. To mix the last remaining bits of flour into the dough, I like using a silicone spatula in a cutting motion.",

Pulse until the mixture is completely smooth (this should take no more than ca. 1 minute). Taste and maybe add a pinch or more of salt. Set aside.",
      "Once the shortbread base has come to room temperature, spread the date 'caramel' in an even layer all over its base. Next, pour the tahini ganache over the date 'caramel'. Set aside to allow the ganache to firm up a little bit then scatter the toasted sesame seeds and the sea salt over the chocolate ganache (if you do this while the ganache is still very liquid, the sesame seeds and the sea salt will simply sink and disappear into the ganache). Set aside until completely firm before cutting the shortbread into square bars."

Take the bowl off the pot and place it on a tea towel on the countertop.",

When it is cool enough to handle, carefully turn the cake out (top down) onto a piece of plastic wrap. Remove the parchment paper. Wrap the cake in plastic wrap and let it cool at room temperature.",
      "When the cake has cooled completely, place a 6-inch round pan in the middle of the cake. Using a serrated knife, trace the bottom of the pan to cut out a circle. You should have a 15 cm x 1.60 cm (6\" x 0.6\") sponge cake layer. Place the sponge layer in the bottom of the 6-inch cake pan, flat side up. Gently press it down, so that you'll have a smooth surface for the mousse layers.",

      "Slowly drizzle the hot sesame milk mixture into the egg in a thin stream while whisking continuously.",
      "Take out the 50 grams of whipped cream you have chilled in the fridge. Fold the sesame-egg mixture into the chilled whipped cream to combine. Pour this on top of the sponge cake layer and let chill in the fridge.",
      "For the white chocolate mousse:\r\n\r\nHeat the rest of the milk over low heat, once it starts to boil, turn off the heat and stir in the white chocolate chunks. Keep stirring until chocolate melts completely. Add the rest of soaked gelatin, stir to dissolve. If the gelatin does not dissolve, warm the mixture up a little bit. Be careful not burn the chocolate.",
      "Whip egg white until stiff peaks form.",

      "Take the chilled mousse out from the fridge and pour the white chocolate mouse directly on top. Return the mousse cake to the fridge again, let it chill for at least 2 hours.",
      "When the mousse cake has set, dust a little bit of black sesame powder on top if you want. \r\nWrap a warm wet towel around the pan sides and hold for 20 seconds. Carefully remove the cake; smooth the mousse with a spatula if necessary. Cut and serve!"

      "The recipe begins with a smarty pants tip from my sister in law and because of that I am able to re-create the same flavor in US where the weather is different.Thankyou Saumya!\r\nIf you are making Kadi for lunch ,say at 12 o'clock at noon on a Sunday,take the yoghurt out of the fridge and keep it on the countertop ,somewhere near the stove (half covered) on Saturday noon. This helps yoghurt get the right fermentation and brings a much better flavor.",
      "Whisk the yoghurt and pour it in a mixing bowl(mine is a 9 inch diameter/3 quart bowl and avoids spillage) ,add water followed by Besan. Start stirring immediately so that no lumps are formed.",
      "Take a medium strainer (mine is 7 inch) and pour the mix through it into another mixing bowl. If there are any big lumps formed,they will separate out. I usually press the lumps,thin them out and make them pass through the strainer to avoid wastage.You shall have a light yellowish mixture ready.",
      "Take a stock pot and put it over the flame.Once the pan is hot,add the oil for cooking.",
      "Once the oil is hot (but not burning) ,add the cloves ,fenugreek seeds and the dried whole chillis.\r\nSmarty pants tip from my mother- Remember to cut the ends of the chilli with kitchen shears. The flavor is maximized once you do that.",
      "Once they are cooked(after a few seconds),add turmeric,red chilli powder and asafoetida.The dry spices will cook very fast.",
      "Quickly pour the mixture into the pot and stir. Lower the flame and add the salt.",
      "Let it cook for about 45 minutes on low heat. Keep on stirring occasionally. Be careful that the soup does not boil and spill out of the pot. Besan tends to thicken while cooking,so add some water if necessary.Adjust the salt if needed.Once the soup is done,turn off the stove and cover it.You will have a yellow coloured soup.",
      "Let's prepare the dumplings (the next few steps to prepare the dumplings are optional though my husband would say otherwise).\r\nTake a mixing bowl.\r\nAdd the onions,cilantro,green chillis,salt and besan.\r\nTip from my husband that added a whole new flavour to the recipe with his smarty pants idea - the addition of ginger to the dumpling mix.",
      "Slowly add water to the dumpling mix to make batter.Please note that the batter should not be too watery or too thick.We have to deep fry chunks of this batter so it should be able to bind the contents.If you feel its watery,add more Besan.",
      "Take a deep frying pan and heat some oil. Once its hot for deep frying(but not burning),take a spoon and drop spoonfuls of the batter in the oil to deep fry. Wait for the dumplings to turn crisp and golden brown.Use a slotted spatula to take out the dumplings and place them on a paper towel.Do this multiple times till all the batter has been used.\r\nAdd all the dumplings to the soup.",
      "Take a small pan .Heat oil(for tempering).Add cumin , wait till they crackle.Then add red chillies,fenugreek seeds,cloves and at the end - asafoetida and red chilli powder. (Don't let the dry powders burn.)",
      "Quickly pour this over the soup and stir.Cover with lid.\r\nWe are almost there.",
      "Last step is a tip from my mother in law - garnish the soup with caramalized onions when you pour the soup in small bowls.Small things that take the flavour to the next level!",
      "Serve the hot kadhi with rice . You can have it like a soup too.\r\n\r\n(The spices used in the recipe are common Indian spices and are easily available in US. These spices are not hot but mostly fragrant except red chilli powder which is used in a small quantity).\r\nMany variations of this recipe are available online as its a popular dish in many parts of India. At the same time,its one of the dishes where every household has their own way of making it and my recipe is the version of how it is made at my home."

Add the garlic to the oil along with the chili and cumin seeds and cook for a couple of minutes until the garlic is starting to turn gently golden. You don't want the garlic to brown. Add the beans to the pan of garlic and spice, stir and keep on a low heat to warm the beans through.",

When the oil is hot, place the marinaded salmon in, you want a decent amount of the marinade to still be on the salmon as this will form a gorgeous crust. You want a decent sizzle when you put the salmon in so be brave and don't turn the heat down. The sizzle will make the crust. Don't be temped to try and turn the salmon until it has been cooking for 5 minutes as it will fall apart. As the yoghurt cooks it will form a crust which will hold the salmon together and make it easier to turn.",

You will see the salmon turning opaque as it cooks and this line of opaque pink will rise as the salmon cooks through. I like my salmon pretty rare so I like to see a decent amount of orange left in the middle before I turn, you may like to leave it to cook for more like 8 minutes. Of course, this all depends on the size of your fillet and the heat of your pan. Essentially, you want the salmon to be almost ready before you turn it. Once you have flipped it, cook for a couple of minutes before lifting it out on top of your beans",
      "To serve, spoon some yoghurt on top of the fish and top that with a generous spoonful of mango chutney. To make yummy wraps, spread some yoghurt and chutney on your flatbread, top with some of the greens, beans and a wedge of salmon then wrap up and enjoy."

Bake in the center of your oven for 10 to 12 minutes, rotating halfway through, until the edges are lightly browned. Remove the cookies from oven and let cool completely. (If making ahead, the finished cookies can be stored in a lidded container in the refrigerator for up to 2 days.)",
      "Make the marshmallow creme: In a large mixing bowl, beat the egg whites and cream of tartar on medium with a hand mixer until soft peaks form, about 1 minute. (If you own a stand mixer, use it here; it makes it all a lot easier later on when you drizzle in the sugary syrup.) Set aside.",
      "In a medium saucepan, over medium heat, combine the sugar, maple syrup, water, and pinch of salt; whisk until the sugar and salt have dissolved, then cook the syrup on medium-high heat until your candy thermometer reaches 240\u00b0 F. (Each time I make this, my thermometer plateaus around the 200\u00b0 mark, no need to worry if this happens to you -- it'll reach 240\u00b0 eventually, just be patient.)",
      "Remove the sugar syrup from heat. With your mixer on medium, slowly drizzle the syrup down the side of your mixing bowl so that you're beating the egg whites and sugar syrup together. When all the syrup has been mixed in, increase the speed of your mixer to high (medium, if you're using a stand mixer) and beat for 5 to 7 minutes, until the creme is stiff and glossy. Transfer it to a container with a fitted lid and let it rest in the refrigerator until cool. (This step can also be done ahead of time if need be.)",
      "Assemble the moon pies. Arrange half the cookies face-down on a large tray. Then spoon marshmallow creme into a pastry bag (or a large plastic bag with the corner snipped) and distribute an even layer of creme on each one. Gently place another cookie on top of the creme, and allow the sandwiches to rest in the fridge while you prepare the chocolate shell.",
      "Place the chocolate in a medium heat-proof bowl over simmering water. Allow the chocolate to melt, stirring every so often with a rubber spatula until it's completely melted. Add the coconut oil and mix until combined. Set aside for a few moments to allow the chocolate to cool a bit.",
      "Prepare a work surface with parchment paper and remove the sandwiches from refrigerator. Using a large spoon, drop one half of the sandwich into the chocolate, turn it over so it's completely coated, and place it on the prepared parchment. Repeat with remaining sandwiches. Allow chocolate to harden.",
      "To store, line a lidded container with parchment paper and layer paper between each layer of cookies. Store Moon Pies in the refrigerator for up to 4 days."

Slice the cucumber and add half of the slices to the pitcher. Stir to combine. Taste and adjust if needed: it will be very strong (you'll dilute it later), but it should be balanced. Since ginger juice and ginger syrup can have different levels of pungency and sweetness, add a bit more of either if you want more of a kick or more sweetness. It's up to you! I like it barely sweet, with a ginger flavor that is present but not overpowering.",

Smear some mustard on the bottom half and top with ham, capicola, provolone, and a generous amount of olive salad. Cover with the top portion of the roll and divide into halves or quarters. Bring napkins.",
      "Notes to the cook: For the garlic, I use a \"garlic confit\" that I learned from Thomas Keller's Bouchon cookbook. What that consists of is about 40 peeled cloves of garlic covered in canola oil and poached for about forty minutes -- a flame tamer is advised. Store the garlic and oil in a sealed container in the refrigerator. After a few days the oil will be highly perfumed. I think the little Corsican would like that touch. It's handy to have on hand and you can add a little of the oil to the salad. Otherwise, use fresh garlic cloves.",
      "The cornichon included in the olive salad is untraditional but one of my New Orleans friends really liked it, so I think it really works. Don't be stingy with the olive salad."

Put the dolma with the rolled side where it's 'sealed' down and continue with the rest of the leaves, placing them side by side in the casserole dish. As you place the rolled dolma in the casserole, don't be afraid to pack them somewhat tightly but remember they'll expand a bit as they cook. It's more important though that there aren't any major open spaces when you're done, otherwise the dolma may open during cooking.",

Place an bake-proof plate on top of the dolmadakia that covers them completely leaving about 1 inch at the edges. The idea here is to gently weigh down the dolmadakia so they don't open up while cooking. If you don't have a plate, do the double-foil trick, i.e. gently place a piece of foil on top of the dolmadakia and crush/wrap the edges inwards so it sits inside the casserole and gently presses down on the dolmadakia. Then (for both plate and foil-method) take another piece of foil and wrap to seal the top of the casserole dish. Bake for ~20 minutes and then remove the top foil layer. Bake for another ~15 minutes until the liquid is mostly absorbed.",

    "ingredients": [],

      "In a cold medium skillet, cook the bacon over medium low heat, until the fat renders out and the bacon becomes crisp in its own grease. Be patient - it will take a while. If you find that your bacon is starting to burn on the outside, you can add a splash of water to help facilitate the rendering process.",
      "Remove the bacon (keep the fat!) and add the leeks and shallots and two tablespoons of the butter. Season with salt and a pinch of red pepper flakes. Sweat them over medium-low heat until they are soft and translucent, approximately 10-15 minutes. There should be a soft, melodic sizzle versus the loud hiss of a saute.",
      "Now it's time to toast the rice: boost your heat to medium, and add the arborio rice. Let it toast for 5-6 minutes (feel free to add more butter or olive oil if it looks dry). They should have a shiny slick from the fat, and begin to become gold around the edges. Add the white wine : you'll see it hit the pan in a big puff of steam as it sizzles from the heat. This is when you start stirring - You don't necessarily have to be stirring it every second risotto is on the stove, but it should be given a mix frequently.",
      "Once the wine has been absorbed (it's pretty obvious, but a good indicator is that you'll be able to see the bottom of the pan as you stir), it's time to start adding stock in stages. Add enough of the warm stock to the point where you can see it bubbling around the rice (you don't want to drown it - no more than a cup at a time should be perfect), and repeat the process of stirring until it's been absorbed. Repeat this process over the next 15-20 minutes, until the rice is just shy of al dente - there really should be a considerable bite to each grain (but not enough for it to feel chalky). You should just barely be able to see the small core of opaque white. At this point add the remaining 3 tablespoons of butter, parmesan, peas, arugula, and the white miso. Once added, stir the pan vigorously to emulsify the risotto and to make it creamy. You may need to add a touch more stock to make it flow slowly like lava.",
      "When your risotto is five minutes out from being plated, heat a heavy bottomed pan (I like cast iron, but stainless steel also works) on high heat until you can begin to see it smoke. Pat your scallops dry and season with salt. Add enough oil to create a thin layer in the pan, and gently place in the scallops- I like to slowly lay the scallop down from one edge to the other to make sure the entire surface is in proper contact with the hot oil. Let it sit there for 2-3 minutes without moving it. If you start to see the golden crust start to creep up the sides of the scallop, it's a good time to start checking your sear. If it looks good, flip your scallop and \"kiss\" the other side for 20-30 seconds (if we tried to sear both sides, the scallop would overcook - better to have an awesome sear and a perfectly cooked scallop versus a dried piece of tire). Blot the scallop of any excess oil before placing it on top of the risotto.",
      "Serve in warm bowls - you spent all this time making risotto, so don't do a disservice to yourself by putting it a cold bowl. Top with a seared scallop and extra virgin olive oil and serve immediately, as the texture stiffens as it cools.\r\n\r\nEat, and give yourself a high five."

Alternatively, you can knead this by hand on a lightly floured surface. If the dough does not pull away from the sides of the bowl, add an additional 1/4 cup of flour.

Fold the perimeter of the dough over the cheese and pinch the edges together to close the dough around the filling.

Cover the pan and allow to rise a second time for about 25-30 minutes while the oven preheats to 375.",

      "April 23, 2016 condiments, easy, mains, sides, spring, summer\r\ngrilled hanger steak with asparagus, spring onions and preserved lemon relish via millys-kitchen.com\r\ngrilled hanger steak with asparagus, spring onions and preserved lemon relish via millys-kitchen.com\r\nIf you've been following along here for a while, you know I'm someone who loves to make unrealistically grandiose plans. I've got list upon list brimming with big ideas for improving the house, the yard, this blog, my photography skills, my wardrobe and my general person (among other projects).\r\n\r\nI'm itching to completely tear up the yard of our new house and transform it into the just-unkempt-enough cottage garden I've been dreaming of for over a decade. I want to rip out the kitchen floor, teach myself to lay tile and put down handmade hex tile from Morocco. I want to browse Pinterest from top to bottom until I finally find THE haircut for my unruly curls. I want to get up at dawn every morning to catch the day's first rays with my film camera. I want to string lights from the trees in our backyard and host large, raucous dinner parties every weekend.\r\ngrilled hanger steak with asparagus, spring onions and preserved lemon relish via millys-kitchen.com\r\ngrilled hanger steak with asparagus, spring onions and preserved lemon relish via millys-kitchen.com\r\ngrilled hanger steak with asparagus, spring onions and preserved lemon relish via millys-kitchen.com\r\nA past version of me would be spending the evening mapping out my plan of attack for all these summer projects rather than writing this blog post. There would be lots of lists and diagrams. Maybe even a full-on crazy wall like the ones you see in the movies with maps and mysterious photos and lots of zig-zagging red string.\r\n\r\nBut I've got a different plan this year. My plan is something called Operation Summer Simplicity. It involves letting the yard and garden do their thing for a season to see what's what. It involves living with the perfectly fine kitchen floor I have until I decide what I really want. It involves occasionally getting up early to shoot with my film camera. Operation Summer Simplicity is all about leaving enough space in my days that I can actually enjoy the one truly phenomenal season we get here in Seattle. \r\ngrilled hanger steak with asparagus, spring onions and preserved lemon relish via millys-kitchen.com\r\ngrilled hanger steak with asparagus, spring onions and preserved lemon relish via millys-kitchen.com\r\nWhile I'm pretty sure there won't be a weekly dinner club happening in my back yard, having friends over for an al fresco meal is one of the highlights of summer for me. To that end, I've decided I need an uncomplicated approach to hosting dinners here at the house. That's where my trusty Weber grill comes into play. Fire it up, throw on a beautiful cut of meat and some seasonal vegetables, uncork a bottle of wine and you're doing summer right. \r\n\r\nSo know this, friends: if the weather is warm and you come to my house for dinner, you will very likely be eating something from the grill. Something like this Hanger Steak with Asparagus, Spring Onions and Preserved Lemon Relish, for example.\r\ngrilled hanger steak with asparagus, spring onions and preserved lemon relish via millys-kitchen.com\r\nI had a chance to test this recipe out a couple weeks ago when our friends Alex, Kelsey, Carlos and Susanna came over for dinner on an unseasonably warm evening and I have to say it was perhaps the easiest, breeziest dinner party I've ever thrown. Of course that's partly because we had invited some of our chillest friends. But I'm going to give the Weber credit for the rest. Score victory number one for Operation Summer Simplicity. \r\nGrilled Hanger Steaks with Asparagus, Spring Onions and Preserved Lemon Relish\r\n\r\n\r\n2 hanger steaks, about one lb. each, patted dry with paper towels\r\nCoarse sea salt\r\n1 1/2 lbs asparagus (buy the fatests stalks you can find so they don't fall through the grill grate)\r\n6-8 thin spring onions\r\nExtra virgin olive oil\r\n1 recipe Preserved Lemon Relish (see below)\r\nSpecial equipment: a corded instant-read thermometer\r\n*Notes: Ideally you want to salt the steaks at least 4 hours before you intend to grill them. If you forget or don't have enough time, it's not the end of the world, but salting the steaks in advance helps to season and tenderize them, so it's worth the extra step. The steaks can be salted up to 24 hours in advance. \r\n\r\n- A corded instant-read thermometer may seem fussy, but unless you're a professional, it's really the only way to cook your steak perfectly every time. Bonus: you won't have to open the oven door or grill lid a gazillion times and let all the heat escape while you're cooking.\r\n\r\n- Here's a great list of tips for grilling. Here's another.\r\ngrilled hanger steak with asparagus, spring onions and preserved lemon relish via millys-kitchen.com\r\n\r\nAt least 4 hours before you intend to grill the steaks, sprinkle them very generously with about 2 teaspoons of salt each. Lay the steaks on a plate and place them, uncovered, in the refrigerator. If you think of it, turn them over once or twice while they're hanging out in the fridge. This allows the surface to dry out more, which leads to better browning on the grill. Remove the steaks from the refrigerator about an hour before you intend to grill them and let them sit at room temperature.",
      "Snap the woody ends off the asparagus and place them on a rimmed sheet pan. Trim any wilted ends from the onion greens. If they're long cut the green tops off the onions along with a bit of the pale green or white part to hold them together. Cut the hairs from the root-end of the onions, but leave enough of the root to hold the onions together. Cut the bulb end in half lengthwise if it's thick. Place the onion tops and bulbs on the sheet pan with the asparagus, keeping them separate. Pour enough olive oil on the asparagus and onions to coat them well and use your hands to rub the oil onto the vegetables, especially the tips of the asparagus. Generously sprinkle with salt.",
      "Use your hands or a silicone pastry brush to generously coat the steaks with oil. Insert the thermometer into the center of one of the steaks. Take care not to angle it up or down or you'll get a false reading.",
      "IF YOU ARE USING A GAS GRILL: Light your grill. Turn all the burners to high and preheat the grill with the lid down until it is very hot, 10-15 minutes.",
      "Place your onions on the grill and cook without turning until they have nice char marks on one side and are starting to soften, 3-5 minutes depending on how hot your grill is. Turn the onions over then place your steaks and asparagus on the grill. Cook the asparagus, turning as needed until they are lightly charred and cooked through. The cook time for your asparagus will vary depending on their thickness. Check them often and take care not to let them get soggy, the goal is bright green, crisp-tender stalks. Remove the asparagus to the sheet pan when they're done. Continue to cook the onions, turning as needed until they are soft and cooked through then place them on the sheet pan with the asparagus.",
      "Cook your steaks until they are nicely browned and char marks appear on one side, about 2-4 minutes. Turn the steaks and cook until char marks appear on the other side, about 2-4 minutes more. Turn all the burners to medium-low, close the lid on the grill and continue to cook until the steaks reach 115\u00b0 for rare, 120-125\u00b0 for medium-rare or 130\u00b0-135\u00b0 for medium. (The steaks will continue to rise in temperature as they rest.) Remove the steaks from the grill and rest for 5 minutes. Slice steaks and serve with grilled vegetables and Preserved Lemon Relish.",
      "IF YOU ARE USING A CHARCOAL GRILL: Build a 2-level fire in your grill like this (scroll down to number 5). Once your coals are hot and covered in ash, set the grill rack in place, cover the grill and let the rack heat for about 5 minutes.",
      "When the grill rack is hot, grill your veggies as above. When they are almost done, move them to the cooler side of the grill to finish cooking, then place your steaks on the hotter side of the grill. Remove the vegetables to the sheet pan when done. Cook the steaks, uncovered, until they are nicely browned and char marks appear on one side, about 2-3 minutes. Turn the steaks and cook until char marks appear on the other side, about 2-3 minutes more. Move the steaks to the cooler half of the grill and continue to cook to desired doneness (see temperatures above). Remove the steaks from the grill and rest for 5 minutes. Slice steaks and serve with grilled vegetables and Preserved Lemon Relish.",
      "Run the lemons under cold water to remove excess brine then quarter them. Scoop out the flesh with a spoon and discard. Finely chop the preserved lemon skin and place in a small bowl. Add the rest of the ingredients except the salt and stir well to combine. Taste and add salt if necessary. (Some preserved lemons are salty enough you won't need to add salt.)",
      "Makes about 1-1/2 cups."

Don't forget to throw in some garlic, chile peppers, and yuzu peel before you start each new layer. Make sure the cabbage is snugly packed and flatten the excess portion of the plastic bag across the surface of the cabbage, pressing out the air to create a seal. Set the pickle tub's drop lid on top (or find a suitable substitute), weight with a rock or other heavy object (about the equivalent weight of the cabbage), and cover. Let sit outside in a cold shady spot, out of direct sunlight, for a couple of weeks. (Check after a few days to make sure enough brine has been exuded to cover the cabbage. If not, sprinkle in a little more salt.) If mold forms, lift it off the pickles gently and wipe any mold spots on the plastic bag or wooden tub with a neutral alcohol such as shochu or vodka.",
      "The pickles can be eaten any time, but perhaps better to wait at least 2 weeks. They reach optimum flavor after 1 or 2 months, and stay good while the cold weather holds (store in the refrigerator if the days turn warm)."

In bowl of electric mixer, first add the yeast, then the flour (making sure it covers the yeast), followed by the sugar, salt, vanilla extract, egg and milk mixture. Beat using the dough hook attachment until dough passes the windowpane test (may take more than 5 minutes). The dough will have pulled away from the sides of the bowl and will become elastic. It will not be sticky. You can take a walnut size piece of the dough and stretch it with your hands. Your goal is to be able to stretch it into a thin (almost transparent) film that does not break easily. If you have not achieved this, continue beating. You can also google windowpane test to have a better visual idea of what I mean.",

Note that I have many times let the dough rise to about 3 times rather than 2 times the original size. Should not be a problem.",

Put 1 teaspoon of apricot jam in the center of every circle, and again carefully fold the edges into the middle as many times as needed to make sure the dough is wrapped around the filling. Pinch and seal tightly. Be careful. You want to avoid getting jam on the edges of the dough because it will make it harder to seal.",

    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "If you are making the Tomato Butter and Blackberry Peach Quick Jam, it's best to make them before the skillet bread. Please see the instructions for both after their ingredient list below the Skillet Bread recipe.\r\n\r\nTo begin the Skillet Bread: first, line a colander with a double layer of paper towels and place in a clean sink. Wash the zucchini and trim the ends. Coarsely shred the zucchini into the colander. Place a medium bowl over the shredded zucchini. Place heavy cans or a large jar in the bowl to help drain the zucchini. Let drain for at least a half hour and up to two hours.",
      "While the zucchini drains, shuck and wash the sweet corn. With a sharp knife carefully remove the kernels and reserve them. Do not throw away the cob. \r\n\r\nWash and stem the hot pepper(s) (if the peppers are very hot, you may want to use gloves). If the peppers are greater than two inches in length then cut them in half width-wise. To reduce the heat, you may remove some of all of the pepper seeds if you wish, but this is not necessary (I removed half of the seeds).",
      "Next, place eight tablespoons of butter into a medium saucepan. Add the cream. Using the back side of a knife, \"milk\" the corncob into the cream mixture by carefully applying pressure with the knife in an up and down motion. Discard the cob. Add the hot peppers to the mixture. \r\n\r\nHeat on the stove's lowest setting, stirring frequently, until the butter is melted and incorporated into the cream (do not allow to boil). Remove from heat and let cool completely.\r\n\r\nAfter the mixture cools, remove peppers with a slotted spoon. Rinse the peppers gently, dice, and add the diced peppers to the reserved corn kernels.",
      "Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Remove the bowl and cans from the zucchini. Carefully ring out the zucchini with the paper towels. Place the zucchini in an oven safe 13\" x 9\" roasting pan (Pyrex or similar). Add the remaining two tablespoons of butter and the 1/3 cup honey to the zucchini. Season the mixture with salt and pepper to taste. Give mixture a brief stir and place in the pre-heated oven. \r\n\r\nCook for 30 minutes, stirring the mixture every 10 minutes. At the 30 minute mark, add the reserved corn kernels and the diced hot peppers. Roast 15 minutes more, stirring every few minutes, until the honey butter has reduced completely and the vegetables are slightly caramelized. Remove from the oven and allow to cool until no longer hot. Do not turn off the oven.",
      "Begin the dough: In a large bowl whisk together the flour and the cornmeal. Add the baking soda, baking powder and salt and whisk again. Add the brown sugar and once more. Using clean fingers, break up any clumps of brown sugar.",
      "Next, add the yogurt to the cooled cream mixture, whisking to incorporate. Add beaten egg and whisk to incorporate again.\r\n\r\nAdd the wet cream/yogurt mixture to the dry flour/cornmeal mixture all at once, stirring gently with a wooden spoon until just combined. Add most of the cooled zucchini mixture (reserve a scant 1/4 cup) and mix briefly and gently. The dough will be quite thick.\r\n\r\nButter a 10 inch cast iron skillet. Spoon dough into skillet and smooth to the edges. Scatter remaining zucchini mixture over top.\r\n\r\nBake in still heated (375 degrees) oven for 23-27 minutes, or until the edges are nicely browned and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Remove from oven carefully and allow to cool for at least 20 minutes before cutting. Serve with Tomato Butter and Blackberry Peach Quick Jam if desired. Store the bread and its fixings in the refrigerator.",
      "For the Tomato Butter: Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Rinse cherry tomatoes. If any tomatoes are larger than 1\" in diameter, cut them in half. Place cherry tomatoes in an 8\" x 8\" baking dish. Drizzle with olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Give the tomatoes a gentle stir to combine.\r\n\r\nPlace in preheated oven and roast for 20-25 minutes, or until softened, but not browned. Remove from oven and allow to cool completely.",
      "After the tomato mixture has cooled, carefully drain off as much residual liquid as possible.\r\n\r\nPlace the tomatoes in a food processor. Add the softened butter and 1/2 teaspoon salt (or to taste) and process until combined. The mixture will not look very appetizing at this point - but do not fear. Scrape the mixture into a small bowl, cover and place in the fridge for two hours.\r\n\r\nAfter two hours, return the mixture to a clean food processor. Process until thoroughly combined (this should take two to three minutes). The mixture should now look like like a lovely, soft, orange butter. Place the mixture in a clean bowl, cover and refrigerate for several hours before using. Makes approximately 1 1/2 cups.",
      "For the Blackberry Peach Quick Jam: Rinse fruit. Pit and coarsely chop peach (it is not necessary to peel the peach). Add blackberries, peach, and both sugars to a medium saucepan. Heat the mixture to a gentle boil over medium heat, stirring frequently to prevent burning.\r\n\r\nOnce mixture boils, reduce heat to low. Continue cooking 10-15 minutes, until the fruit is broken down and mixture reduces and thickens. Remove from heat and allow to cool.",
      "Place a thin mesh sieve over a medium bowl. Carefully pour the cooled blackberry/peach mixture into the sieve. With a spoon, press as much of the jam through the sieve as possible (it helps to scrape the spoon over the bottom of the sieve from time to time). Discard remaining seeds and peach skin in the sieve.\r\n\r\nPour the jam into a glass jar (or small bowl), cover and refrigerate for several hours before using. Mixture will thicken as it cools, but the jam will be relatively thin (between a sauce and a jam in thickness). Makes approximately 1 scant cup."

Once all the red meat colour is gone, leave the meat in the pot and keep cooking until it is unmistakably BROWN. Trust me.)",

      "NOTE: The amount of oil and cognac will vary on how large your pot is and how many batches you have to work in. These are the amounts I used for about 4 batches (1 for the onions and 3 batches of meat). It is important to work in batches if your pot is not large enough for all of the meat so that the meat can evenly brown, instead of browning only on the bottom and steaming on top. You will need to add a little more oil to the pot for each batch, and then deglaze after each batch with the cognac."

Add in some of the mixers described above in the last few minutes of churning and enjoy immediately (soft serve) or let ripen in the freezer for an hour or two. Because of the bourbon, the icecream will not get super-hard - not even after a day in the freezer! However, it probably won't last that long."

      "Put the pan on the bottom rack of your oven for 18 minutes, then cover with foil and bake for another 17; 35 minutes total. If it still isn't golden brown and delicious-looking, take the foil off and keep baking at 5 minute intervals until it gets that way.",
      "While the shortbread cools, start the sherbet.",
      "Put the water and 2/3 cup sugar in a small saucepan, and bring it up to a boil while stirring. Keep stirring until it's clear, then take it off heat and let it cool completely.",
      "Beat together the creme fraiche, 1 1/2 teaspoons lemon juice, lemon zest, and vanilla in a stand mixer, then slowly pour in the sugar/water syrup and mix on low until everything's combined.",

      "When the shortbread's fully cooled, layer the jam over it with a spatula and freeze for about half an hour.",
      "Mix the sherbet liquid in an ice cream maker until it becomes sherbet, layer that over the jam, then top with the pecans. You might not need the whole cup, but you want enough to get a solid layer of nuts for that old-school strawberry shortbread bar goodness.",
      "Freeze the whole thing for a couple hours more (I promise this is the last time), let it thaw for 7 minutes, then cut yourself a square and enjoy."

      "Heat the oven to 300\u00b0F. Line a rimmed sheet pan completely with foil. Now lay another extra-long piece of foil, dull side facing up, down the middle (this is what we'll use to bundle the ribs, so make sure it's big enough to envelope them completely).",
      "Make the spice rub: Combine the paprika, mustard, brown sugar, garlic powder, and salt in a small bowl. Mix until completely smooth, with no remaining lumps. Transfer 3 tablespoons of this mixture to a another small bowl for later.",
      "Place the ribs, meaty side down, on the big piece of foil. You'll notice a thin, transparent membrane covering the bones. Use a pair of kitchen shears to snip open the membrane, then use your hands to ease your way under it, then pull it completely off the ribs.",
      "Grab the larger bowl of spice mixture and rub it all over the ribs-top, bottom, and sides. With the meaty side facing up, bundle the ribs in the larger piece of foil. (Double wrap if you need-just make sure there are no gaps for the juices to escape from, since you'll be flipping the ribs halfway through.) Start roasting with the meaty side facing up.",
      "Roast the ribs in the foil package for 2 hours, carefully flipping halfway through, until the meat is fork or toothpick tender.",
      "Once they're tender, remove the ribs from the oven and crank up the heat to 500\u00b0F. While the oven is coming up to temperature, open the ribs' package (watch out for steam!), and transfer the ribs, meaty side facing up, to a cutting board. Now carefully pour all the juices from the sheet pan into a heatproof cup or bowl (we'll use these soon). Throw away the foil from the ribs' package and the foil covering the pan; carefully line the pan with a fresh sheet of foil (or not, but I prefer an easier cleanup). Return the ribs to the newly lined sheet pan, meaty side facing up, and sprinkle the remaining 3 tablespoons of spice mixture evenly on top. Use a spoon to gently pat the spice mixture down, encouraging it to dissolve.",
      "When the oven is at 500\u00b0F, get the ribs back in-this time completely uncovered. Roast for 10 minutes until the top is starting to crisp up and dry out. Remove the ribs from the oven and lightly brush the top with the reserved juices (you won't use them all). Get the ribs back in the oven and continue to bake for another 10 to 15 minutes, until the top is crispy.",
      "Transfer to a cutting board and let cool for a few minutes. To cut, flip the rack upside-down, so the bony side is facing up. This makes it a lot easier to cut neatly cut between each bone. Serve hot, with the extra pan juices alongside if you want."

    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "Day 1\r\nOk now that I have made the obscure comparison between donuts and human kind lets actually make the donuts. Heat the milk to a boil and cool it down in the freezer to around 45 degrees Celsius, once cool dissolve the yeast in the milk. Mix together the flour, sugar, and salt in a bowl and add the milk, knead until a smooth dough is formed, transfer it to a floured surface and add the softened butter and continue to knead until a smooth elastic dough is formed. Shape the dough into a ball and place it in a covered bowl to proof until doubled. Punch and give the dough one turn which means to literally punch the dough and fold the dough over once, there by releasing some of the co2. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight, make sure that the bowl has lots of room for the dough to expand.",
      "The ice cream base is a less thick creme anglaise recipe, which is a stirred custard that is thickened by the coagulation of egg protein. Put half of your cream and all of your sugar into a sauce pan. Cut the vanilla bean in half and scrape the seeds out using the end of your knife, place the seeds and the pod into your pot. Bring the mixture just to a simmer ( you do not want to boil the mixture). Separate your eggs and temper the egg yolks into the cream return the pot to the heat and stir using a spatula being sure to scrape the bottom of the pot slowly (do not whisk it or you will form a frothy rather than smooth custard) cook the mixture until it thickens slightly and will coat the back of a spoon. Remove from the heat and add the other half of the cream, this will help to stop the cooking process, refrigerate it in a shallow container over night with the vanilla pod before turning it off.",
      "The citrus honey which will be drizzled over the donuts is simple just add the zest of one lemon and one lime and a slice of each (without the rind, the rind will give the honey a very tart flavor) to a jar of honey. Place the honey in a hot water bath, turn off the heat, cover the pot and leave the honey for an hour or so to infuse with the citrus.",
      "To make the pineapple chips pre heat the oven to 200 degrees Fahrenheit and skin a fresh pineapple and slice 10 1/4cm slices off, cut the core out of these slices. Put the pineapple chips on a baking sheet lined with parchment put them in the oven for half an hour and then turn the oven off and allow the chips to dry overnight.",
      "For the compote chop up the pineapple into small bite sized pieces and finely chop the fresh basil, sprinkle with a little coarse salt and toss them together and refrigerate overnight to allow the flavours to infuse.",
      "Day 2\r\nScale the dough into 8, 60g pieces place one ball of the cocktail boccocini in the centre of each doughnut and envelope the cheese into the centre of the doughnut; round each doughnut and place on to a fryer rack or a greased baking sheet. Put the baking sheet into a small garbage bag and tie it up so the bag is full of air, proof the doughnuts at room temp until doubled if you need to speed up the proofing place them in a slightly warmed oven or on a stove top near the oven vent. Heat the oil to 350 degrees Fahrenheit and hold it there until the donuts are proofed.",
      "Once the ice cream base has had time to sit allowing the flavours to concentrate and infuse with one another we can now turn it into ice cream. I will explain how to do so using an ice cream machine but if you do not have one you can find plans on the internet of how to make a simplified one. Place the ice cream base into the ice cream machine and turn it on and that's all there is to it. It could take anywhere from ten minutes to fourty five depending on the machine, turn the cream until it is thick and there is no remaining liquid it should have the viscosity of whipped cream and should form stiff peaks. The ice cream will still be to runny to scoop but you do not want to overturn it into butter, place the ice cream in the freezer for an hour or two and it should be ready to go",
      "Heat up the citrus honey made earlier in a pot until liquid, keep the mixture warm until the donuts are done. Once the oil is heated submerge the fry rack in the oil or if you do not have one carefully place the doughnut on a slotted metal spoon and submerge it into the oil. Use a metal sieve, or strainer to push the doughnuts into the oil and fully submerge them. Once the doughnuts are nice and evenly browned remove them from the oil and place them on paper towel to cool and then place them in the pot of honey and roll them around until completely coated. \r\nThe doughnuts need to be served warm so that the bocconcini is nice and soft, serve them on top of a scoop of ice cream garnished with a basil leaf and a side of pineapple compote."

Transfer to a thin baking sheet with at least 1 inch edges or longer pyrex dish and place in refrigerator for around 1 hr or more until solidified. Natural instinct would be to freeze the broth but we want the soup to be hot and cook quickly. Freezing it would make the broth too cold and risk too much incorporation of the liquid into the filling. Furthermore, if you scraped frozen filling to a room temperature filling, the dough would become too liquidy when forming the dumplings.",

Melt the butter and slowly incorporate the flour on medium to low heat. Once incorporated, add the milk in 1/2 cup increments. Heat on medium heat and stir until thickened. Reduce heat and and stir in the Gruyere and Swiss cheeses. Add salt and lots of cracked black pepper.",

      "After 20 minutes, add the vegetables. (See my note below as to why you shouldn't put everything in together.) Turn over the turkey parts and stir the ham bits, to loosen them from the pan, if they are stuck to it. If the pan seems dry, add a few more tablespoons of water and tilt the pan as you did before.",
      "Cook for another 20 minutes. Meanwhile, put 2 1/2 quarts of cold or room temperature water in a large stockpot.",
      "When the turkey parts and vegetables have finished roasting, remove the wings from the pan with a slotted spoon and put them in the stock pot. Remove the vegetables and set aside. Get all the bits of ham up, or as many as you can, and add them to the stock pot, along with the wine.",
      "Deglaze the roasting pan with the Cognac and a tablespoon or two of water. Pour the pan drippings and whatever liquid remains into a small container. Scrape as many of the little bits as you can get off the bottom. I use a firm spatula for this. Cover and refrigerate until you make the gravy.",
      "Pour a cup or so of hot water into the pan, scrape it well, one last time, and pour that liquid into the stock pot.",
      "Add the thyme branches (or other herbs) and another tiny pinch of salt.",
      "Bring just to a boil, then turn down immediately, and simmer for at least an hour. Two hours is better. Either way, about 45 minutes -- and no more -- before you plan to strain the stock, add the roasted vegetables. Don't add them before because, according to Michael Ruhlman, vegetables break down in cooking in such a way that causes them to absorb the liquid. You'll leave too much stock in the vegetables that are eventually strained and discarded.",
      "Strain and then return the stock to the pot. Reduce it to about one quart by boiling it hard for as long as necessary. Cool the stock to room temperature. (I do this by putting it into a glass Mason jar, then setting it into a pan of cold water in my sink, stirring and refreshing the water periodically.) Then refrigerate until ready to begin making the gravy. It will be very thick and probably gelatinous once it cools. Scrape off any fat that's risen to the top before using the stock for your gravy.",
      "N.B. Please resist the temptation to include the vegetables with the turkey or chicken parts when you first put the pan in the oven. If you add the vegetables at the beginning, with the meat, the moisture in them creates steam, and releases liquid into the pan. That steam and liquid prevent the turkey or chicken parts from browning properly and from creating thick, flavorful pan juices.",
      "Remove and reserve or discard the fat from the cooled stock, and then gently warm the stock. Keep it warm and close by as you do the next step. (I typically warm it in the microwave in a heat-proof glass measuring cup that has a pouring spout.)",
      "In a small pan over medium heat (or in an appropriate vessel, in your microwave), reduce the wine by 1/2 of its volume.",
      "Cook the butter over medium flame until the butter is melted. Whisk it well to combine. Add the flour, continuing to whisk all the while. (See note below about toasting the flour -- a step that I highly recommend, but which is optional.) The butter and flour mixture (a \"roux\") will soon look like a somewhat thick paste. This happens quickly.",
      "If you plan to add pan drippings from your roasted turkey, pour them into a metal bowl, scraping up all the hard bits, and put in the freezer to separate as much fat as possible. (See note below about brining, however.)",
      "As soon as the paste is thick and golden, slowly and continuously pour in the warmed stock over medium heat, whisking vigorously the whole time. It will look lumpy and thick, but don't worry. It will smooth itself out as you add the rest of the stock, provided that the stock is warm, you stream it in constantly, and whisk without stopping.",
      "Add the reserved pan drippings from when you roasted the wings and/or back and neck. Then add the Worcestershire sauce, a quarter teaspoon at a time, tasting before adding more, and the reduced wine. Stir well over medium-low heat for about a minute. See note below about using the drippings from your roast turkey, which is optional.",
      "Check for salt and correct. Add freshly ground pepper to taste.",
      "Enjoy!! ;o)",
      "N.B. If you have brined your turkey, consider using just a few spoonfuls of drippings, added one at a time and tested after doing so, before you check for salt. This allows you to use at least some of the roasted juices. I add salt very sparingly under these circumstances, to allow me to do this. But with the rich stock made from roasted wings and necks, the pan drippings really shouldn't be necessary. (See the next note, please.)",
      "If, on the day your roast the turkey, you (a) have pan drippings you can use, and (b) are inclined to use them in the gravy, do the following: Pour off all of the pan drippings from your turkey into a metal bowl, scraping all of the hard bits from the pan. Put in the freezer, to allow the fat to separate. Remove the hardened fat and add to the gravy while heating, before serving.",
      "Toasting your flour makes any sauce or gravy taste really good. You can do this in a dry heavy skillet on the stove. Toast it stirring constantly, lest it burn, until it's a light brown shade and starts to smell somewhat nutty; then, remove it immediately to a small bowl, to prevent further cooking and over browning."

Then mix in the 2 tablespoons of salt, curing salt, and pepper and rub it evenly into the meat (like a relaxing, porcine spa treatment), spreading it evenly around the sides as well as the top and the bottom. Tuck the meat carefully inside a sealable plastic bag (gallon sized will work, but oversized are better if you can find them) and lay it flat in the refrigerator for 7 days, massaging the liquids that will amass through the bag and flipping it daily.",
      "After 7 days, inspect your bacon. It should be firm to the touch all over, like touching a cooked steak-a sign that it has been cured. If the flesh still feels spongy and soft in spots, massage the meat again with an additional 2 tablespoons salt and check it again after 1 or 2 days.",
      "Once the bacon is fully cured, discard the solids, rinse the meat well, and pat it dry. The next step to giving bacon that familiar flavor is the addition of smoke.",
      "Fastest: Roasting and Liquid Smoke \r\nPreheat the oven to 200\u00b0F. Place the belly, fat side up, on a rack over a roasting pan and roast for 2 to 21/2 hours, until the interior temperature of the meat reaches 150\u00b0F. Gently brush the liquid smoke over the entirety of the bacon, covering both sides evenly.",
      "Slowest: Smoking on the Grill \r\nSmoke the meat, fat side up, on the cool side of a low-heat grill, using a 3-cup packet of hickory sawdust, for 3 to 5 hours, until it reaches an internal temperature of 150\u00b0F.",
      "Best of Both Worlds: Smoking and Roasting \r\nThis is my preferred methodology, because I love the flavor of the smoke but often lack the patience for a full grill session.\r\nStart smoking your meat, and do so as long as you're able-at least 2 hours is really ideal. Smoke it until you get sick of babysitting the grill and tending to the coals. Finish the meat on a rack over a roasting pan in a 200\u00b0F oven until it reaches 150\u00b0F inside at its thickest point. Fry a slice of the bacon and taste. If it needs more smoke flavor, brush a thin layer of liquid smoke on both sides of the slab.",
      "Whichever method you use, when your bacon is ready, slice it as thin (or as thick) as you like it and fry, over medium heat, until browned on both sides. Drain on paper towels and enjoy.",
      "How to Store It\r\nBacon can be stored in large slabs, in precut hunks for flavoring beans or other dishes, or in slices, in layers between pieces of parchment paper, and sealed tightly in a freezer storage bag. Refrigerate up to 10 days or keep frozen up to 3 months."

      "For the Pate a Choux: Preheat oven to 425\u00b0 F.",
      "Combine the water, butter, sugar, and salt in a saucepan. Heat over medium until the butter has melted completely.",

      "Add in the eggs one at a time, stirring to incorporate each egg completely before adding the next one.",
      "In a small bowl, beat the additional egg with one tablespoon of water.",

Smooth any peaks or rough edges with a wet finger and brush the strips with an egg wash. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes or until golden brown. Cool completely before filling.",
      "For the Glaze: Whisk the juice, zest, and sugar together until smooth. You want a fairly thick glaze that will not run down the sides of the eclairs",
      "To Assemble: Fill a pastry bag fitted with a bismark tip with the chilled lemon cream mixture. Fill each eclair with a few tablespoons of the cream then dip the top in the meyer lemon glaze. Garnish with candied citrus peel (I used kumquats). Alternately, slice the top third off of each eclair, fill the bottom with a few tablespoons of lemon cream, replace the tops, and drizzle with glaze. Enjoy immediately -- these treats are best the day they are made. Store extra lemon cream in the refrigerator for up to five days."

      "Season the roast all over with salt and pepper, including the bones, making sure to get the seasoning in the spaces between the bones. Don't neglect the bone side!",
      "Set the roast, rib side down, on baking sheet or tray, and refrigerate, uncovered for 1 to 3 days. This will allow the roast to dry, so you'll get a nice crust when it roasts.",
      "Prepare to roast:\r\nRemove the roast from the refrigerator and let it sit at room temperature about 3 hours before you plan to roast it.",
      "Heat the oven to 425\u00b0F convection. (If you don't have convection, heat to 450\u00b0F). Be sure to let the oven preheat fully (this often means waiting longer than when the oven tells you it's ready). The only real test is to rely on an oven thermometer.",
      "Position a rack in the bottom third of the oven, adjusting it so the middle of the roast will be as near to the middle of the oven as you can manage.",
      "Arrange the roast in the pan. Choose a sturdy roasting pan that will hold the roast without crowding but without leaving too much empty space - which will cause the drippings to burn. The lower the sides of the pan, the better, but make sure it's sturdy-in other words, a rimmed baking sheet is NOT sturdy enough. If the sides are high, you will want a roasting rack so the sides of the pan don't shield the roast from the oven heat.",
      "Roast:\r\nSlide the roast into the oven with the bone ends facing the oven door (this places the thicker side of the roast towards the back of the oven where the heat is the highest). Roast until you hear the meat begin to sizzle, 20 minutes-this is a sign that the outside is browning.",
      "Without opening the oven door, lower the oven heat to 300\u00b0F convection (or 325\u00b0F non-convection). The lower temperature insures that the large roast will cook though evenly without overcooking the outer layer. Continue to roast; the time to start checking the internal temperature will depend on the size of the roast: For a 3- or 4-rib roast (about 8 pounds), start checking after about 45 minutes at the lower temperature. For 5-rib roast (10 to 12 pounds), start checking after 1 1/4 hours.",
      "Once the internal temperature reaches about 95\u00b0F, expect it to rise 8\u00b0 to 10\u00b0 degrees for every 10 minutes more in the oven. Try to wait 10 to 15 minutes between checking the temperature of the roast, so you don't lose too much of the oven's heat.",
      "Take the roast out when it reaches 110\u00b0F to 115\u00b0F for rare; for medium-rare, 120\u00b0F, and for medium, 125\u00b0F. (Because of the size of this roast, the internal temperature will rise as much as 10\u00b0 to 15\u00b0 as it rests).",
      "Rest:\r\nTransfer the roast to a carving board (one with a trough to catch any drippings). Depending on the size of the roast, this can be a two-person job. Have one person hold the roasting pan (or rack) so when you lift the roast, it doesn't pick up the pan/rack. The best tools for lifting a roast are either: sturdy meat forks, those multi-prong roast lifters, or (my go-to) double thickness of kitchen towels that go directly to the laundry.",
      "Let the roast rest-ideally uncovered-for 25 to 40 minutes. If the kitchen is cool or drafty, you can tent loosely with foil, but do not wrap tightly or you will cause the crust to steam and soften."

If you're like me, here are a couple of tips:\r\n\r\nGreat short video on crust preparation and how to crimp edges:\r\nhttp://www.food52.com/blog/1181_himalayan_blackberry_pie\r\n\r\nYou want your dough firm coming out of the freezer, but not frozen. If it's too hard it will crack the edges and if it's too soft it will stick to everything. \r\n\r\nPlace a piece of plastic wrap on your surface, dust with flour, place your dough, dust with flour again and place another piece of plastic wrap on top.\r\n\r\nAlways start from the middle of the dough and work your way out, rolling evenly from the middle of the dough out - in a radius and not too hard. When you think the dough is about the right size, place your pan above it to gauge whether it is big enough to cover the pan.\r\n\r\nRoll one (bottom crust) slightly larger than the top crust.\r\n\r\nFold it in half and in half again. Gently lay crust in your pan so the edge of the pan is covered (you don't want to have to move the dough around once it's placed in the pan so do your best to judge it right the first time).\r\n\r\nI hope this helps!"

Take it home and cook it immediately as the meat deteriorates quickly. Of course, you can always buy pre-cooked and cleaned crab from the store, but it's never as delicious as freshly-cooked. \r\n\r\n-- Some people serve whole crab and have their guests clean them at the table. I find this a little off-putting (read: gross) for those who are not die-hard crab lovers and seafood aficionados. I prefer to clean the crab and remove the innards before serving.\r\n\r\n-- The crab can be cooked up to 6 hours in advance. Store in the refrigerator until you're ready to serve it.",
      "Heat a large pot of generously salted water over high heat. If you do not have an extremely large pot, you will need to cook the crab in batches.",
      "While the water is heating, fill a large bowl or pot (or a clean sink) with ice. If you are cooking the crab in batches, be sure to save some of the ice for the rest of the crab.",
      "When the water comes to the boil, place as many crab as will fit in the pot. Be sure they are completely submerged. Bring back to the boil and cook for 15 minutes. Transfer the crab to the ice and cover with cold water. This will stop the cooking. Once completely cold, remove the crab from the ice water. Clean the crabs if you didn't have your fishmonger do it. Dry thoroughly and store in the refrigerator if not serving immediately.",
      "If you want to eat your crab cold (like we do), just take it out of the fridge about 20-30 minutes before you plan to serve it to let it warm up a bit.",
      "If you want to eat it hot, steam the crab for 5-10 minutes just before serving. The time will vary depending on how large your crabs are and how cold they are when they go in the pot. Taste the meat often as you steam the crab to be sure you don't overcook it.",

I use both the leaves and the stems of the herbs as the stems have a lot of flavor and it reduces food waste! You can use any sort of herb of your preference, rosemary is another great option. Once the butter has melted, give the mixture a stir and remove from the heat.\r\n\r\nNext, with your fingers or a spoon, carefully loosen the skin the of chicken to create pockets. Fill the pockets with the herb & butter mixture, reserving about 2 tbsp. Massage in the mixture so that it coats as much of the chicken meat as possible. Spoon the remaining mixture over the chicken and massage it into the skin. Sprinkle the top of the chicken with some more salt & pepper.\r\n\r\nPlace the chicken into an oven-safe skillet (get yourself a cast iron skillet now if you don't already have one!) and place into the preheated oven. The chicken will roast low and slow for 1 hour and 30 minutes but set a timer for 30 minutes first.",

Carefully pull the rack out a bit and spoon the juices over the chicken to keep it moist. Add the baking sheet with the roasted vegetables at this time as well. Set a timer for another 20 minutes.\r\n\r\nAfter 20 minutes, baste the chicken again and toss the vegetables so they roast evenly. Set another timer for 20 minutes to baste the chicken once again and check on the vegetables. If the vegetables are tender, remove from the oven. Set another timer for another 20 minutes then baste the chicken again. Do this a couple more times until the chicken has been in the oven for 1 hour and 30 minutes.\r\n\r\nOnce the chicken is done, remove the skillet from the oven and move the chicken from the skillet onto a cutting board. Allow the chicken to rest for 10-15 minutes.",

Beat on medium speed with a hand mixer for 1-2 minutes, until well combined. Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan and secure with the cake pan lid or tent loosely with tin foil vented with small slits. Place the crock pot lid on the crock pot and \"bake\" for 2 1/2-3 1/2 hours until cake tester comes out clean. Cool to room temperature on a cake rack, then turn cake out onto a plate to frost.",
      "In a large bowl, combine the cream cheese and butter. Mix on medium high speed with a hand mixer until well combined. Add the peppermint and vanilla extracts and powdered sugar, 1 cup at a time beating until smooth.",
      "Use a long serrated knife to slice the cake in half making two equal rounds. Add a few tablespoons of icing to the bottom round and using an offset spatula, spread it evenly over the cake. Place the other half of the cake on top of the first tier. Set aside.",
      "Divide the remaining frosting equally into 3 small bowls. Set aside one bowl of frosting with no food coloring added. Add 1 drop of food coloring to the second bowl. Add three drops of food coloring to the third bowl. Mix each bowl well so that you have gradually darkening colors.",
      "Start with the white frosting Put several spoonfuls on top of the cake and use your offset spatula to evenly cover only the top surface. Transfer the rest of the white frosting to a pastry bag fitted with a large round tip. Pipe the white frosting over the top third of the sides of the cake. When you've used all of the white frosting, add the lighter pink frosting to the bag and pipe it around the next third of the cake. Then add the dark pink frosting and pipe it around the lower third of the cake. Note - when piping, depending on the size of your piping tip, you may have to make serpentine lines to loosely cover each third of the cake.",
      "Use your offset spatula to create the ombre effect. Hold the spatula vertically from top to bottom firmly against the cake and gently turn the cake plate around. This will smush the icing flat against the cake and the different tones will naturally run into each other creating the effect. Continue to spin the cake until the sides are completely coated.",
      "Switch the round tip to a star tip and pipe any remaining frosting around the base of the cake . Sprinkle crushed peppermint candies around the top rim.",
      "Notes\r\nMy grandmother gave me her crock-pot cake pan which is essentially a tall round pan with a vented lid -- It fit her crock pot from the 1960s which was more vertical than today's modern crock pots. To jury-rig one for your crock pot, find a cake pan that will fit comfortably inside your crock pot. After filling the pan with batter, loosely tent aluminum foil over the pan and cut several vents in the top -- being careful that the foil isn't too close to the batter - you don't want it to stick to the foil as it rises. Bake covered in the crock pot for 2 1/2 - 3 1/2 hours. After the first 2 1/2 hours, use a cake tester to check doneness. If it comes out dry, it's done, if batter is wet and sticks to the tester, give it an extra 1/2 hour to an hour."

Do not do as I did and resist checking under the lid until the smell of burnt apple becomes palpable.) When you can pierce the celery root with a fork, remove the pot from the heat.

Meanwhile, use a paring knife to gently peel the casings off each sausage. When the oil is heated, add the sausage meat to the pan. Cook, stirring occasionally to break the sausage into pieces, until no longer pink. You should have time to slice up the onion while the sausage is cooking.",

Try to seal in the other ingredients with the celery root mash. I sprinkled the top with freshly grated Parmesan and black pepper.",

      "Cream the butter and sugar. Add egg and citrus juices; beat well.",
      "Add 2 Tablespoons (combined and firmly packed) of lemon and orange zest to the dough and using a spoon, stir well. I recommend that you do it at this point, and that you use a spoon, to minimize the amount of zest wasted on your mixer beaters.",
      "Whisk together the flour, baking powder and salt and add them to the creamed mixture of butter, sugar, etc. The dough should be easy to handle. If it isn't, chill it for an hour or so.",
      "Preheat your oven to 375 degrees Farenheit for a regular oven, or 350 degrees for a convection oven.",
      "Roll out the dough on a very lightly floured surface and cut with cookie cutters. Place the cut shapes of dough on a cookie sheet covered with parchment (or lightly oiled, if you don't have parchment).",
      "Bake for 12-15 minutes, depending on your oven, your cookie sheets, etc. The cookies are done when the edges are very light brown.",
      "While the cookies are baking, if you are going to ice the cookies, mix 1 teaspoon lemon juice (or other liquid) with 1/3 cup sifted confectioners' sugar. Add more sugar or liquid to get it to the consistency you want. I prefer a very thin layer of icing -- a glaze, actually -- so mine tends to be somewhat runny. You can also put some more lemon zest in the icing, if you want a more lemony taste, or make the icing using Cointreau or any other liqueur that you like, instead of lemon or orange juice.",
      "Once the cookies have cooled, paint the icing on them and sprinkle them lightly with a pinch or two of the zested sugar mixture, or not, depending on your preference. (If the sugar mixture if fairly dry, I use the end of a dinner knife to pick the sugar up out of the shallow dish where I've mixed it, then gently tap the dull side of the blade with my index finger to drop the sugar mixture onto the cookies, as one would do when using a salt dish at the table. Otherwise, just take a pinch of the mixture and rub your fingers together gently as you drop it onto the cookie.)",
      "If you prefer just to sprinkle on the zested sugar, paint the cookies lightly with Cointreau and/or orange juice that has been strained (if you're using both, combine in a 1 to 1 ratio) and then sprinkle on the sugar mixture.",
      "You could also put plain white sugar on, or sugar mixed with a spice such as allspice, cardamom or coriander, if you don't want to use zest. Of course, you can also sprinkle on purchased decorating products, if you like.",
      "These don't have to be cut-out cookies, by the way. To make a round cookie, simply roll a piece of dough about the size of a large walnut into a ball, roll the ball in white granulated sugar to coat (this is optional), flatten with the bottom of a glass or jar, and bake in the oven as noted above.",
      "Enjoy!! ;o)",
      "Note: If you choose to use the Orange and Lemon Zest Sugar to decorate, make it before you start the cookie dough. The mixture is much easier to handle, and tastes stronger, if it's had some time to sit, which allows the sugar to absorb the juices from the zest and then to dry slightly.",
      "Also, you can make these with just lemons, or just oranges, if you prefer. I really like the two different flavors together, so I recommend using both."

    "directions": [
      "Mix 3 tablespoons (30 grams) lukewarm water (about 80 to 90 F) with 1 teaspoon raw honey. Add 3 tablespoons (20 grams) rye flour and let this sit in a covered container for 1 to 2 days. The amount of time depends on the ambient temperature. If your kitchen is cool, the organisms will be less active and you'll need more time. Ideally keep it at around 75 F (24 C). An oven with the lights or pilot light on works well.",
      "If you can maintain an ambient temperature of 75\u00b0F (24 C), this first phase will probably take a day, which would be the case on your kitchen counter in the summer. If you simply ferment it in a cold kitchen in winter, it will likely take two days. \r\n\r\nWhen you pass by the starter, give it a mix with a spoon every now and again: your animals like oxygen in the initial stages. If they are happy, you will begin to see tiny bubbles forming on the surface of the starter as the organisms belch out carbon dioxide. This should occur after one or two days.",
      "At this point, add 3 tablespoons of rye flour, 3 tablespoon of water around 75 F (24 C), and 1 teaspoon honey. Let it sit for 24 hours. Stir occasionally.",
      "Discard half the starter. Add 3 tablespoons of rye, 3 tablespoons of water, and 1 teaspoon honey.",
      "Repeat this last step every 24 hours until the starter is bubbly and begins to rise noticeably. Once that happens, usually by day 5 or 6, you can stop adding the honey. The starter may weaken at that point (you've removed its sugar fix, after all) but proceed anyway. It will come alive again. When the mixture doubles in volume within 12 hours, you can think about making bread.",
      "Here's the test to see if the starter is ready, after it has risen: carefully remove a bit of it (a tablespoon will do) and place it in bowl of warm water. If it floats to the surface within a couple of minutes, you've got an active starter.",
      "This whole process may take a week or more, especially in the winter. With my kitchen hovering around 65 F (18 C), it took me two weeks to achieve a predictable starter, with feedings every one to two days. Once the starter is bubbly and active, you can switch to whole wheat flour, or a mixture of equal parts white and whole wheat flour, in place of the rye. You can also increase the volume by using, say, 20 grams of the mature starter and then feeding it with 100 grams flour and 100 grams water.",
      "TROUBLESHOOTING: You may start out and get bubbles, but by day two or three it just looks dead. You have a few options:",
      "First, keep going, and eventually the yeast and bacteria will re-appear and the starter will rise. An active, robust culture is nearly impossible to kill, even if you do leave it around on the kitchen counter for a few days. So if you forget it feed it for a couple of days, don't throw it out-just soldier on and see what happens.",
      "Second, you can replace the water with pineapple or apple juice to raise the acidity level, which creates a favorable environment for wild yeast.",
      "Third, start over. If you do decide to start over, try to acidify the starter by using juice in place of water or a pinch of vitamin C powder with the water for the first three days.",
      "Fourth, use a pinch of commercial yeast (really, just a pinch between your thumb and forefinger) to jump start your sourdough. Although it may feel like \"cheating,\" there's really nothing wrong with this method. Once your starter becomes sufficiently acidic over time, the wild yeast and bacteria will outcompete the store-bought yeast and your starter will be much the same as if you started out without it.",
      "If all else fails, here is a guaranteed method: Ask for a knob of starter from a friend or local artisan baker (it helps to mention how wonderful their breads are). You may also get a few tips along the way. Feed it once or twice daily by taking 20 grams of the starter and adding 100 grams flour and 100 grams water and leaving it, ideally, at around 75 F (24 C) for about 6 to 8 hours. Refrigerate it an hour or two after feeding if you're not going to use it within the next day. If kept in the refrigerator for a week or longer, refresh it at least once before using it to rise bread. I often refresh it twice, just to ensure it's sufficiently strong.",
      "VARIATIONS: I tend to reuse a very small portion of my existing starter when it's feeding time. I use 20 grams existing starter, 100 grams flour, and 75 grams water. This makes a stiff starter which rises slowly, especially in the winter. After eight hours it can be used, and will tend to have a very mild lactic acid taste."

      "Combine the flours, yeast, sugar, salt, eggs, and 120 ml (1/2 cup) of room temp. water in the bowl of a standing mixer with a dough hook and mix until combined, scraping down the sides of the bowl as necessary. Once the ingredients have come together, mix on low speed for about 3 more minutes. The dough will seem very dry, it has to be because you're going to be adding a whole lot of butter!",
      "Still mixing on low speed, add the butter one piece at a time, adding each new piece only after the previous piece has gotten fully mixed in and has disappeared into the dough. This will take a while and as you add more butter, the dough will start to smell marvelously like cake batter. Once all the butter has been added, scrape the sides of the bowl down then mix for 10 more minutes.",
      "At this point, give your mixer a 5 minute break to let its motor cool down just a little. Then, turn it up to medium speed and beat the dough until it becomes soft and a bit shiny, about 10 or 15 minutes. At first as you start to beat it it will look like there's no hope for the dough, like it's just a shaggy mess, but give it time and it will become smooth and silky as the mixer does its work. Once the dough starts to look smooth and silky, turn the mixer to medium-high and beat for 1 more minute (the dough should make a slightly uncomfortable thwapping and slapping sound as it hits the sides of the bowl). Turn the mixer off and test the dough by pinching a little of it between your fingers and pulling it gently outward. It should stretch a bit towards you. If it breaks immediately, mix the dough for 2-3 more minutes.",
      "Transfer the dough in a big ball to a large bowl and cover it with plastic wrap, gently laying the plastic directly atop the surface of the dough. Put the dough into the refrigerator to proof overnight, or at least 6 hours. During this time it will only rise a little bit.",
      "Remove from the fridge when ready to use. The brioche circles require only half of this dough. The remaining half can be frozen for a week then thawed overnight in the fridge to make more goodies next week! You can also bake the second half into a brioche loaf (good for sandwiches) by shaping it and placing it in a loaf pan to rise for 4 hours, then baking at 350F until deeply golden, about 35 minutes.",
      "To prepare the cherries, combine the whole pitted cherries with the honey in a heavy bottomed saucepan. Cook over medium-high heat until they start to bubble, then turn the heat to low and cook, covered, for 10 minutes, until the cherries are soft and soupy. Allow to cool completely. (This can be done the night before baking when you have to make the brioche dough anyway.)",
      "To make the brioche circles, divide the half-batch of brioche dough into 8 equal pieces. Flatten each piece and stretch each into a circle about 4 or 5 inches across. They should be very thin in the middle with a thicker rim, like making tiny pizzas.",
      "Line two rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper and put 4 of the circles on each. Let the brioche circles rest at room temperature for 30 minutes to soften and puff just slightly. In the meantime, heat your oven to 350F.",
      "Put a piece of brie in the center of each of the circles, then top the brie with a large spoonful of cherries and just a very small amount of the cherry juices. Each circle should get about 5 or 6 cherries. (Save the leftover cherry juice to mix into drinks - think a splash of cherry juice, a splash of bourbon, a squirt of lemon juice, and soda...)",
      "Bake the brioches in the oven until they are golden brown and the filling is bubbling, about 25-30 minutes, being sure to switch the positions of the pans and rotate them halfway through the baking time.",
      "Allow the brioches to cool on the baking sheets for 10 minutes before transferring to a wire rack. Serve at least a few of them still warm (but not hot or, trust me, you will burn the heck out of your mouth) from the oven accompanied by cups of strong coffee, since they are definitely the most magical while fresh. Wrap any leftovers tightly and keep them in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Rewarm them gently in the oven or a toaster oven (about 8 minutes at 325F) before eating."

      "Once the filled shell has rested, spread some amount of compote over the top to form an even layer, and sprinkle the remaining hazelnuts on top. Serve immediately with the remaining compote, and a dollop of creme fraiche."

Then, add the pod to the sugar, put it all into an airtight container, and let it hang out until you're ready to bake. Remove the pod before baking (you can add it to some other sugar though to make that sugar vanilla-y for future use).",
      "Preheat your oven to 350\u00b0F. If your dried figs are quite plump, you can use them as they are. Otherwise, combine the chopped figs with the bourbon in a small bowl and allow the figs to rehydrate for 10 minutes, then drain. (You may want to do this even if your figs are plump. Who doesn't want their figs to be a bit bourbon-infused?)",
      "Combine the flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt, and 1/3 cup sugar in a large bowl. Working quickly, use your fingers (I prefer fingers because then I can get a better feel for how the dough is doing) or a pastry cutter to work in the butter until the dough resembles coarse meal or sand with a few larger pea-sized butter chunks still left as well.",
      "Make a well in the middle of the dry ingredients. Whisk together the eggs, cream, and creme fraiche, and add this mixture along with the (drained) chopped figs to the well. Stir until everything is just combined. Then, use your hands to gather the whole mess together.",
      "Dump the dough onto the counter, and pull it all together into a rough ball, and pat it into a big circle about 3/4-1 inch thick. There may be stray bits of dry flour mixture left over that won't stick to the rest of the dough. Pat on what you easily can, otherwise just leave it, it's OK.",
      "Use a dough scraper to cut the circle into 8 huge wedges (or if you are capable of more moderation in your scones than I, you can divide it into more smaller wedges and adjust the baking time accordingly). Separate the scones from each other and transfer them to a parchment lined baking sheet. (At this point you can freeze the scones instead of baking them, and once they're hard, store them in an airtight container in the freezer to be baked at a future point.)",
      "Lightly brush the scones with the milk and sprinkle with the remaining sugar. Bake the scones in the middle rack of the oven until they are golden brown and crisped on their craggy edges, 20-30 minutes. (It took only 20 minutes in my oven, but it seems to be running hot these days.)",
      "Remove from the oven and transfer to a cooling rack to cool as much as desired. I think scones are the best served while still warm (but not hot) from the oven. But, they are also lovely at room temperature, and will keep for a day, especially if you gently warm them back up before serving."
