      "Use a larger portion of flours such as sorghum, teff, millet, amaranth and oat flour to boost the protein content of your bakes",
      "Measure correctly.",
      "Invest in a set of digital kitchen scales as gluten-free flours don't weigh the same as wheat flours do, especially when you're using them in a blend.",
      "You can't substitute them all cup for cup.",
      "For extra help, see my tips on converting gluten-free flours from cups to grams listed in my profile",

      "It replaces the gluten and binds the ingredients together.",
      "Without it everything you bake will to too crumbly to slice.",

      "Any more than 30g is trouble.",
      "Almond meal and tapioca starch are both good for adding a soft texture too but too much tapioca will result in chewy bakes",
      "Don't fill your tins more than 2/3 full, especially bread tins.",
      "The weight of the batter rising will probably make your bakes collapse",
