I tested at least a dozen recipes and after adding and subtracting various ingredients this is the one I like the best. I hope you'll like it as much as I do.",

So gather your ingredients, pour a cerveza and start cooking. In about an hour you'll think you're in a little cafe overlooking the white sand beach in Sayulita as you enjoy your delicious bowl of Albondigas Soup.",

      "Prep the oven. Set the rack in your oven about 2/3 of the way down, so the rack will be just a little bit below the middle. Preheat the oven to 425 F.",
      "Prepare the pastries. Cut the butter up into 1 tablespoon-sized chunks. In a large, heavy saucepan, bring the cup of water, butter, salt, pepper and nutmeg to a slow boil (set it over medium or medium low heat). While that's going, measure out your flour into a bowl. Turn the heat off the saucepan as soon as it's reached a boil, then dump in all of the flour into the pan at once. Beat vigorously with a wooden spatula or spoon for several seconds to blend thoroughly. Turn on the heat again to medium high heat. Then beat it with your spoon for another 1-2 minutes until the mixture leaves the sides of the pan and the spoon and forms a mass. Turn off the heat. Take a minute, breathe! You're halfway there!",
      "Seriously though, take a minute for the dough to cool down. This was a big mistake I made in the beginning, because I put in the eggs when the dough was too hot, and the dough scrambled the eggs! So just let the dough rest for about 5 minutes, or until it's about lukewarm.",
      "Make a well in the center of the dough-just push it down gently with a wooden spoon or your hand. Immediately break an egg into the center of the well. Beat it into the paste for several seconds until it has absorbed into the dough. Continue with the remaining 3 eggs, beating them in one by one. The third and fourth eggs will be absorbed more slowly, so will require a bit more time to mix in.",

      "Put the dough in a pastry bag, or if you're a MacGyver cook like me, into a large Ziplock bag, and place the sealed bag in the fridge. Because of the cheese, these puffs don't puff up quite as high as their dessert counterparts (eclairs/profiteroles) but they are still light and fluffy nonetheless.",

      "Get a large baking sheet ready (you might need 2) and either place parchment paper on the sheet or grease it really well.",
      "Take your bag of dough from the fridge and if you're using a Ziplock bag, cut about a 3/4 inch opening in one corner. Squeeze 3 inch oval mounds onto the prepared baking sheet(s). Make sure they're about 2 inches apart. Brush each pastry lightly with the egg wash. Sprinkle each puff with some more grated cheese if you wish.",
      "Set the baking sheet(s) in the oven on the prepared rack and bake for 20 minutes or until the puffs have doubled in size and are light brown. Then reduce the heat to 375 F and bake for 10-15 minutes more, or until the puffs are golden brown and firm and crusty to the touch. Turn off the oven. Remove baking sheet(s) from the oven and make a 1 inch slit in the side of each puff (to let the air out and have the inside cook a bit more). Return the puffs to the turned off oven, and leave the oven door ajar for 10 minutes.",
      "Then remove the pan from the oven and open one puff as a test. If the center is still damp or doughy, put the sheet back into the (turned off) oven to crisp for a bit longer. If they are not damp or doughy just set the pan aside.",
      "While the pastries are in the oven, prep the filling.",
      "Chop up the green onions and the mushrooms, and saute them in a skillet over medium heat with the tablespoon of butter. Season to taste. I added a few pinches of pepper. The veggies should be ready after about 5 minutes. When done remove pan from the heat.",
      "Take your puffs out of the oven (if they are still in there) and slice them horizontally, like a sandwich. Spoon your desired amount of mushroom filling over the bottom slice, and then top with the top slice!",

Once you are happy with your spreading, bake the crust for 15 minutes. Then remove it from the oven and allow it to cool completely.

      "4. While the food processor is running on high, slowly add the ice water through the feed tube, one tablespoon at a time, until the dough comes together and a stiff dough forms. (This process usually takes 15-20 seconds total in my '80's era food processor.)",
      "5. Dump dough onto a clean, floured surface. Divide dough in half. Lightly shape each half into a ball, and then pat the ball into a 1/2 inch tall disk. Wrap the disks snugly in plastic wrap. Refrigerate dough for 30 minutes before rolling out. (Makes enough for a generous 9-inch, deep dish pie.)Prepare pie filling while dough is chilling.",

      "1. The classic presentation for Green Goddess dressing is a salad of romaine lettuce, tomatoes, and cucumbers. A large portion of fresh crab meat is mounded in the center and the dressing is served on the side.",
      "2. Variations of the salad include substituting cubed or chopped chicken or turkey for the crab. Salad greens can be romaine, curly endive, escarole, and chicory. Other green vegetables like garden peas and asparagus can be added to the greens.",
      "3. Green Goddess Dressing is best when made the day before serving it. This gives the flavors time to \"marry.\"",
      "4. This dressing is very thick. If a pourable dressing is desired, add half-and-half or whole milk to the dressing until the desired thickness is achieved. Be sure to check the seasoning and adjust as needed.",
      "5. Store in refrigerator for up to 5 days."

      "I make these in my Kitchen Aid mixer. Here's the problem with this: the amount of egg white isn't enough to catch onto the bottom of the whisk. KitchenAids are kind of notorious for this. It's their only flaw. But I've had mine for 20 years and I love, love, LOVE it! My solution: I put my egg whites in and hand whisk them until they are bubbly and frothy. They probably are double in volume before I put the bowl back on the mixer and continue using the machine. Now the whisk can reach the whites. So add the cream of tartar and put the mixer on medium speed and whip away!",
      "You want to get to a soft peak. You can tell this has been reached when you life the whisk up out of the egg whites and the peak droops over at the tip. Now you want to increase the speed of the mixture to high. As the egg whites continue to beat, slowly pour the sugar into the bowl. Beat until firm peaks form. The egg white foam will become smooth, moist, and shiny. Stop the beaters and lift them. Straight peaks should form.",
      "Now continue beating on high until stiff peaks are formed. Whites will be very stiff and glossy. Make sure they are complete to this stage if you want defined peaks at the top of your cookies.",
      "Add the crushed candy canes. Fold them in gently until well mixed.",

Just use it as a guide. Place a mini kiss in the center of the circles and pipe up and around the kisses. Try to make sure the whole mini kiss is covered. Pull up at the end to make the peak. They should look like big, pink chocolate kisses. Just practice to get the shape. The not-perfect ones still taste delicious!",
      "When all meringue is used, or pans are filled, place into the preheated 225\u00b0F oven for an hour and 30 minutes (90 minutes!) Don't peek! Remove from the oven and let set on pans a few hours after they are done baking. They are a little fragile, especially at the tip, but so yummy!"
