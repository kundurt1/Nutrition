      "This is easier for larger quantities of corn tortillas, especially if you need to hold them hot for a little while.",
      "Pour 1/2 inch water into the bottom of the steamer, then line the steaming basket with a clean, heavy kitchen towel.",
      "Lay the tortillas in the basket in stacks of 12 (a small vegetable steamer will accommodate only one stack; a large Asian steamer will hold three or four stacks).",
      "Fold the edges of the towel over the tortillas to cover them, set the lid in place, bring the water to a boil and let boil only for 1 minute, then turn off the fire and let stand, covered, for 15 minutes.",
      "If you wish to keep the tortillas hot for up to an hour, slip the steamer into a low oven or reheat the water periodically.",
      "This easy method works best with no more than a dozen tortillas.",
      "Drizzle a clean kitchen towel with 3 tablespoons water and wring the towel to even distribute the moisture.",
      "Use the towel to line a microwave-safe casserole dish (8 or 9 inches in diameter is best).",
      "Lay in a dozen tortillas, cover with the towel and the lid, then microwave at 50 percent power for 4 minutes.",

      "The tortillas will stay warm for 20 minutes.",
      "Though it's not much a part of home cooking, street vendors of seared-meat tacos reheat fresh tortillas with the heat of a slightly oily griddle they're not so much frying the tortillas (which would mean completely submerging the tortillas in oil) as griddle-heating them with a tiny bit of oil.",
      "When just-baked tortillas come off the griddle or when they've been reheated, they're traditionally kept warm in a tightly woven basket (chiquihuite) lined with a cloth; some have lids, others don't.",
