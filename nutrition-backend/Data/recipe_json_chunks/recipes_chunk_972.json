Divide dough into 3-4 pieces, When you cup your hands together like you are holding something you don't want to get away that is the amount of dough you want. Then pat it out to just a little bigger then your whole hand and put into the oil. Fry on one side until nice and golden brown, it can be a couple minutes to 5 minutes depending on what you are using, a frying pan will take less time and a deep fryer will take longer but is more safe way of frying. When golden using tongs flip over and fry on the other side until nice and golden.",

      "Add the mixture to a \"prepared\" baking dish. You can prepare any baking dish by coating it with cooking spray or - as I like to do - use a paper towel to collect some Crisco and simply rub the dish until it's coated.",
      "Bake at 425\u00b0F for about 40-45 minutes. To see if the corn bread is ready, insert a table knife into the center and pull it out. If it's dry, you're dish is done. If it's still got some wet batter on it - let it cook for another 5 minutes - checking in intervals. Be careful not to overcook. You want the top of the corn bread to be delicately browned, but not so browned that you now have a hardened crust, so just keep an eye on it during the last leg of baking.",
      "Now -- to use the butter!",
      "Immediately after you remove the corn bread from the oven, drag as much as 2 tbsp of butter over the top slowly, allowing it to melt as you brush the top of the corn bread. The 2 tbsp (especially if you're using slices of butter from a stick of butter) should be enough to adequately coat the entire loaf. This is an important step. You might think it's just for flavor, but the butter actually softens the top of the corn bread and keeps the texture from becoming too firm or stale. As the butter melts and seeps down into the body of the corn bread, it adds further moisture to the dish, without turning the corn bread into a soft mush like it sometimes can if you slap a spoonful onto an open slice.",

      "My Note: You don't care for bell pepper and onions in our slaw, so I left them out and it was still scrumptious. Here is a little tip I heard about from a chef on the cable food network. As you know all veggies have quite a bit of water so if you but the cabbage in a colander and sprinkle a little salt over it. It will remove the excess water from the cabbage. This process takes about 30 minutes to an hour but it gives you a very crisp cabbage and the slaw is not watery. I did differently was to put a tablespoon of lemon juice on the apples while I chopped up the rest of the ingriedients, I did this the first time I made the salad, I didn't do it the second time and the apples turned brown after 2 days. I still added the lemon juice that the recipe calls for.",
      "For a change of pace, I occasionally throw in pecans or sunflower seeds for a little something different -- This has joined a list of favorites in our household! I only used 1/4 cup of brown sugar and added a couple Tbl. of cider vinegar in addition to the lemon juice.",
      "I always buy a pre-shredded cabbage/carrot mixture to make prep easier and also change up the apples from time to time (try Fuji or Gala, you must keep the granny smith though for the tartness). I skip the red pepper and sometimes add a little extra dressing. This is WONDERFUL and keeps for several days."

      "WHICH GAMMON or HAM?.",
      "I used a cooked boneless ham joint throughout this recipe. If you use an uncooked ham, you will need to cook it (see instructions below) which will leave you with homemade stock for the soup.",
      "Sometimes ham or gammon can be very salty, especially gammon from supermarkets. To remove most of the salt, soak the gammon in water for two hours before cooking and pour away the water. Then simmer it for 15 minutes, pour away the water and add new water for the remaining cooking time.",
      "If the ham or gammon joint you buy is too large, put what is left in the fridge and use it for sandwiches,or as a main meal another time.",
      "As a very easy alternative, use pre-cooked ham which saves all the bother of cooking your own ham / gammon joint. If you decide to use pre-cooked ham, just ignore the first step of the recipe, OR you might have cooked my Celebration Spiced Ham with Orange and Marmalade glaze already - so the stock base and ham will be done!",
      "Whatever ham or gammon is used, it's fine if it is smoked or un-smoked - I used un-smoked.",
      "Cooking the Ham or Gammon:",
      "Pour 3 pints of water into a largish pan and bring to the boil. Turn the heat down until the water is simmering (barely boiling). Place the uncooked gammon in the pan. If the gammon is covered half way to all the way by the water you're OK. Chop the gammon into smaller pieces if it's not at least half covered. The cooking method is the same whatever ham or gammon joint you use. Cook for around 50 minutes.",
      "Turn the ham over about half way through cooking.",
      "Immediately after the ham is put on to cook, start on the vegetables.",
      "Cooking the Soup:",
      "Chop up the onions and carrots into small cubes, and place all the vegetables, split peas and chopped parsley into a pan, pour in the stock and bring to the boil. Then lower the heat so that the mixture is just simmering (just below boiling).",
      "This will need to be cooked for around one hour, maybe one and a quarter hours if you want your vegetables soft.",
      "The ham or gammon should be cooked after about 50 minutes, just enough time to prepare it before the vegetables are cooked.",
      "Remove the ham from the pan, and chop it into small cubes. Chop up the smoked sausage to the same size.",
      "The final step is to add the ham and smoked sausage to the soup and heat gently for about 5 to 10 minutes. Stir well and have a quick taste. More salt and pepper can added if the soup needs more seasoning.",
      "Serve the soup into bowls and add some extra chopped parsley if you have any available. Serve with crusty bread rolls or French bread/baguette.",
      "This soup freezes well and will keep in the freezer for a month."

I also reduced the cooking temperature to 150c & it turned out perfectly. It was sooo delicious, light & fruity! I really am the cheesecake master mmm -- ."

      "4. Cover, and bake 45 to 60 minutes. Uncover, and reduce temperature to 325*F. (165*C). Bake for an additional 30 minutes, or until set.",
      "My Note: This is a good basic recipe but I think it needs a little revamp. Here is the revamping I did -- I used 1 cup of Half and Half instead of 2 cups of milk (too soggy with that much milk) I used 6 eggs instead of 4 for a richer egg texture. I added 3 tbsns green onions to the milk/egg mixture. I used 6 slices of THICK texas toast and covered the bottom of the pan with it. I then put the cooked sausage over that. (Bob Evans Spicy Hot Sausage from Kroger) I then put 1 cup of shredded sharp cheddar cheese over that. Then I pour the egg/half and half/green onion mixture over that. I bake after letting it sit in the fridge for 8-12 hours at 350*F. for 25 minutes. I guess I should post a new recipe!",
      "My daughters UPDAT on this: Thay did do a few changes that I have picked up on here. Thay use the Jimmy Dean Maple Sausage, 6 eggs (I think I am going to try 8 next time), 1 1/2 Cups milk (I think I am going to try the full 2 Cups next time), I don't think I am going to use additional salt next time b/c I feel it is salty enough from the sausage and cheese. I use the mild cheddar, but I use 1 box of Marie Callendar Cheddar/Garlic croutons instead of the bread and that adds to the cheesy flavor. And I add a little bit more of the dried mustard. It is an excellent breakfast casserole!",
      "This dish is absolutely delicious! I doubled the recipe using 3 bags of Marie Callendar's Cheese & Garlic Croutons instead of plain bread, 20 eggs, 1/2 cup sliced scallions, 1/2 cup chopped onion, 6 cups of milk, 2 teaspoons mustard powder, 1 teaspoon black pepper, 2 teaspoons of salt and 1 pound each of Monterrey Jack and Mild Cheddar Cheese. I put shredded cheese on the top of it in the last 15 minutes of baking. I made this recipe for a Holiday Brunch at my place of employment and it won a prize for \"Best Breakfast Casserole\"! Thank you For the $1.oo Boss! Ha,Ha,Ha."
