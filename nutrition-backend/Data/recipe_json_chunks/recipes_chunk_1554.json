      "1. A creme brulee torch is a classic method of caramelizing the topping. It can be used for other things like caramelizing meringue and marshmallows, crisping meat, charring vegetables, skinning tomatoes and melting cheese on gratins.",
      "2. A blow torch works well for creme brulee and can be used for lighting the grill, gardening or fixing copper pipes.",
      "3. The broiler or grill can be a good option, too. You have to let your creme brulee cool completely before using it. Set it on very hot and put your creme brulee underneath for a couple of minutes until the crust is golden brown.",
      "4. The oven can be used if you make your creme brulee ahead. Take a piece of parchment paper and turn an empty ramekin over. Use a pencil to circle it around. Repeat as many times as you need. Spray your circles with a nonstick cooking spray. Then sprinkle a rather thick layer of brown sugar in your circles, trying not to go beyond the shape. Broil them in the top shelf of the hot oven for some minutes, until golden brown. I recommend you to use this method if you prepare your creme brulee one or two days ahead because this way the sugar doesn't get soggy, as it doesn't touch the moist custard surface. The crust should be put on the creme brulee directly before serving. Also, you can make different shapes (using cookie cutters is a good idea, too!) and use them for the variety of desserts.",
      "5. Using a mixture of alcohol and sugar is a spectacular way to serve your creme brulee. Sprinkle the custard with brown sugar and pour a bit of hard liquor of your choice. It can be vodka, gin, rum, brandy or whisky. One tablespoon will be more than enough. Use a normal lighter or matches to burn it and enjoy the show."

      "Throw a stick of salted butter (it's what I had on hand) in a stock pot. Begin to melt that in the pot. Add a package of frozen onions. I keep these on hand especially during the winter for stew and other kinds of soups or chowder. Next, chop up three stalks of celery and add to the mix. While you are letting the onion and celery saute together, chop up the sausage into bite-sized pieces and toss them in.",
      "I let this cook for about 15 to 20 minutes, starting on medium-high heat and then turning the heat down to almost low.",
      "Because I didn't have fresh potatoes on hand, I used the next best thing, and once again turned to my freezer and found a bag of frozen potatoes-the kind you use for hash browns, except they are cubed. I threw the whole bag in (it was small and we like potatoes!).",
      "Then add 1 cup of cream (I know, I know-but gosh, Paula Deen says \"I'm your Chef not your doctor!\") and the box of chicken stock along with a bottle of beer. Any old bottle will do.",
      "Bring this all to a boil and reduce to simmer for about 5 to 10 minutes.",
      "Now for the fun part. I wanted something cheesy and decided to try Velveeta Cheese. I know it sounds icky, but let me tell you, it's amazing stuff! Cubed half of a large block of Velveeta and add it to the mix. Stir constantly until the cheese is melted. Once the Velveeta is melted, add 2 cups of the sharpest cheese you can find. The sharper the better.",
      "Add three tablespoons of flour or Wondra (whatever you have on hand to thicken the soup) to the 2 cups of half-and-half, and mix until the mixture is smooth. Pour gently into the stock pot. Bring to a boil once again, and then return to a simmer, stirring constantly for about ten minutes.",
      "If the mixture is too thick for your liking, you can thin it down using whole milk or half-and-half. I purposely didn't add salt, as so many of the ingredients already have salt in them, but I did use pepper in the end. Lots of it.",

Test the oil after 25 minutes by flicking some flour into the oil. If it sizzles, it's ready to go. If not, wait five minutes and test it again.",
      "2. When your oil is hot, line up your onion rings (still in the buttermilk), the plate of flour, and the tequila batter to make a little battering/frying station. I also like to have a plate ready with a few paper towels on top, to drain the onion rings once they're fried.",
      "3. Pull onion rings a few at a time from the buttermilk, shake off the excess, and dredge them in flour. When the rings are covered in flour, transfer them to the tequila batter and turn to coat them completely. Shake off any excess batter and gently place the battered rings in the hot oil. Put rings in oil one at a time, to allow the oil to come back up to temperature for a few seconds in between each addition. I like to fry 4-5 large rings at a time (6 or 7 if they're small).",

Make a well in the center, and then add buttermilk, orange juice, vanilla, and egg. Stir just until combined, taking care to not over mix. Gently fold in cranberries, just until barely combined. Try to work rather quickly, so the butter in the dough stays as cold as possible.

      "8. Transfer the gingerbread pieces to the foil and bake them on the center oven rack until golden brown, about 15 to 17 minutes. Be careful not to overcook the gingerbread, or it will darken and shrink. Lift the foil to transfer the baked cookies to a rack. Allow the pieces to cool completely before taking them off the foil. Repeat with the remaining section of dough.",
      "9. Let the gingerbread firm up at room temperature for at least 2 hours before attempting to assemble a house or train. You can also store it in an airtight container if you're planning to assemble it another day."

Put the lemon slices in a non-reactive bowl (stainless steel or glass) and, using a spoon or your hands, toss with the sugar. Cover and let them sit at room temperature for at least 3 hours or up to overnight. If any seeds are still left, they will usually float to the top, where they are easily fished out. If you are using the more tender-skinned Meyer lemons, you can proceed to the next step without letting them sit, as the skins don't need to sit in the sugar to tenderize them.",
      "Use 1 pastry round, rolled out to 1/8 inch thick, to line a 10-inch tart pan with a removable bottom, easing the dough into the bottom and up the sides and leaving a 1-inch overhang. Set aside.",
      "In a small bowl, whisk the eggs and salt together until blended. Add the eggs mixture into the lemon mixture, mixing thoroughly. Pour the mixture into the pastry-lined tart pan. The mixture will be very liquid, so you must evenly distribute the lemon pieces in the pan.",
      "To make the egg wash, in a small bowl, whisk together the egg yolk and cream. Brush the rim of the pastry with the egg wash to help the top pastry round adhere. Lay the second pastry round over the filling and trim the overhang for both rounds to 1/4 inch. Crimp the edges together as you would for a pie, making sure you have a good seal. Brush the top of the pie with the egg wash and then sprinkle the sugar evenly over the top. Chill for about 30 minutes. While the pie is chilling, position a rack in the lower third of the oven and preheat the oven to 350 F.",

Bake the pie until it is deep gold on top and the filling is bubbling (visible through the vents), about 40 minutes. If the top is coloring too quickly, place a piece of foil or parchment loosely over the top.",
      "When done remove the pan from the oven and set it on a rack. Let the pie cool completely before slicing to allow the filling to set properly. Serve at room temperature or slightly warmed with lightly whipped unsweetened cream (though the pie needs to cool completely for the filling to set up, it can be warmed up a little in the oven before serving). The pie will keep in the refrigerator for up to 4 days.",

Instead, find your local family farmer and ask them for rendered leaf lard. If you can't find rendered leaf lard from a family farmer, a great tip is to ask the meat counter at your Mexican grocer for Manteca de Cerdo. It's not as clean but it's natural, healthier and hasn't been processed!",
      "Step 3: assembly",
      "(For photo illustrations, please visit my blog.)",
      "1. You can fill the tamale with as much masa as you personally like. I prefer mine thinner, so I use about a heaping tablespoon and a half of masa for each tamale. Fill the corn husk with masa, starting on one edge, leaving about 1 1/2 inch of space on the opposite side. Add as much or as little filling as you would like and carefully fold the corn husk over, sealing the masa from one end to the other. Make a second roll, bring the bottom flap up and tie with a long piece of corn husk. It takes some getting used to, but once you get going, it's easy peasy!",
      "2. Once your tamales are all filled and rolled, you will need a steamer, or tamalera, which can also be purchased at a Mexican grocer. You will need to fill the bottom with water and bring to a boil. Once it's boiling, add the tamales. I stand them up and usually fill the entire bottom area.",
      "3. Cover with a damp towel and lid. Steam for 1 hour or until the masa easily pulls away from the husk.",

      "Optional: I also like to throw in a few juniper berries, a couple chunks of fresh peeled ginger and a few whole cardamom seeds (or some ground cardamom).",
      "In a small-to-medium sized stockpot, add all the ingredients and bring to a boil. Then turn on low (I set my burner to \"2\") so that it is still boiling very lightly. Keep uncovered, and boil for 1 hour. Every 15 minutes or so, skim off the fat from the top, making sure that you're careful not to take too much of the spices, onions or other \"good stuff.\"",
      "After an hour and a half, take the chicken breasts out and let them cool on a plate for about 15 minutes. Keep the soup stock at the same temperature, still simmering while the chicken is cooling. When chicken is cool enough to handle, pull off the good breast meat and shred into small pieces. Put the good breast meat back on the plate, cover and put in the fridge. Put the bones of the chicken back into the stock pot, and simmer for another hour. After the hour is up, take the bones out, and try to fish around and pull out the apple chunks and garlic chunks (if you're not able to get the garlic, no worries). Add the noodles and shredded chicken. Turn on medium to bring to a strong boil, and then turn on low again for another half-hour. Total cook time should be about 3 hours. Season to taste (meaning add more salt if you think you need it). Serve hot with fresh, crusty bread or crackers.",
      "Another optional step: I also sometimes like to make this into a creamy chicken noodle soup. In that case, before adding the shredded chicken and noodles, I'll take 1/2 cup of heavy cream and three eggs and put that into a small bowl. Beat the cream into the eggs until it's well mixed. Then taking a ladle, pour a little bit of the hot soup/stock into the bowl, and whisk. Then take a little bit more, pour it in, and whisk. Keep doing that until you've poured about a cup of the soup in with the egg mixture (this is to ensure that you don't actually cook the eggs when the egg mixture comes in contact with the hot liquid). Once you've got a cup or so of hot soup whisked with the eggs and cream in the bowl, pour the whole egg mixture into the soup pot. Stir thoroughly."

(This is what we do as everyone here likes their salad a bit different-and then any leftovers can be kept for the next day without going soggy.) Serve with one or two asiago crisps on top. Enjoy!"

Fry shallots in batches until golden brown and lightly crispy. Take care to not let them get too dark, as they will also bake for a bit in the oven on top of the casserole. This should take about 3-5 minutes per batch. Transfer to a paper towel lined baking sheet. Sprinkle lightly with kosher salt and set aside.",
      "For the green beans, bacon, and homemade gravy:",
      "Preheat oven to 375\u00b0 F.",

      "Discard all but 2 tablespoons of the bacon fat from the skillet. Return skillet to stove top over medium heat. Add 2 tablespoons of the butter to the skillet. Once butter is melted, add the mushrooms and stir to incorporate. Cook, stirring regularly, until mushrooms are softened. Add chopped shallots and garlic, stirring to incorporate. Cook for another 2-3 minutes, until garlic is fragrant.",
      "Now slide everything in the skillet to one side. Add remaining 4 tablespoons of butter to other side of skillet. When the butter is melted, sprinkle the flour over the butter, whisking all the while. A flat whisk works awesome here. Draw in as much liquid as you can, into the flour. The mixture will be very thick. Let it cook for one minute, until slightly browned and fragrant. Slowly whisk in chicken stock until flour mixture is smooth. Then whisk in the half and half. Now bring the entire contents of the skillet together, scraping the bottom of the skillet, and folding to incorporate. Turn heat up to medium-high and cook until thickened and bubbly, about 4-5 minutes, stirring periodically.",
      "Remove skillet from heat. Stir in soy sauce and Worcestershire sauce. Then sprinkle Parmesan, rosemary, and thyme over the top and stir to combine. Now is the time to taste test and add more salt and pepper, if desired. I usually add about 1/2 teaspoon of salt and 1/4 teaspoon of black pepper at this point. Fold in blanched green beans. Transfer mixture to a baking dish and place in oven to bake for 30 minutes. Remove casserole from oven and arrange fried shallots and chopped bacon over the top, leaving green beans exposed around the perimeter of the dish. Place in oven and bake for another 5 to 10 minutes, or until edges of casserole are bubbling and the top is golden. Remove from oven and let rest for a few minutes before serving.",
      "Note: This is a more time intensive version of green bean casserole than the classic recipe. To save time on Thanksgiving day, this could mostly be prepared the day prior. Simply fry the bacon, chop, place in a container, and refrigerate. Fry the shallots, place in a container, and refrigerate. And prepare the casserole all the way up to placing it in a baking dish. Cover and refrigerate. When baking on Thanksgiving day, remove casserole, bacon, and shallots from refrigerator 30 minutes prior to baking. Place foil over the dish and bake for 30 minutes at 375\u00b0F. Then remove foil and bake for another 5 or 10 minutes, or until center is hot (dip a spoon into the center to test) and edges are just starting to bubble. Then top with bacon and fried shallots and bake for another 5-10 minutes, or until casserole edges are bubbling. To crisp up the shallots, place under broiler for a minute or two."

Push your fingers into the dough; the dough should feel like it's going to stick to your fingers as you pull them away, but doesn't. That's how you know the consistency is just right.",
      "Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 10 to 20 minutes. Place in a lightly greased bowl, turning once to grease the top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour.",
      "Punch dough down. Using a 1/3 cup measuring cup, measure out the dough for 12 rolls. Shape each into a ball. You may have a little bit of dough left over, so make whatever you want with that. Place the rolls into a greased 9\"x13\" pan. Cover and let rise until they are at least double in size, about 30 to 45 minutes. You can let them rise longer to get even larger rolls, but you need to watch them carefully so they don't over-rise and then deflate when they bake. I always let them rise to their maximum capacity. Also, note if you are using regular yeast or rapid rise yeast; this will change the rising times, as will the temperature in your house.",
      "Bake at 375 degrees for 20 to 25 minutes or until golden brown. After I take them out of the oven, I always spread butter over the tops of the rolls.",
      "Note: the dough can also be done in a bread machine on the dough cycle if you have that, but just be sure to still test the dough midway through the kneading cycle to make sure the consistency is correct. After the dough is done rising, proceed with the recipe as directed."

      "1. Oil 2 baking sheets and sprinkle them with flour or streak them with oil and line them with parchment paper.",
      "2. The steps are described using a standing mixer with flat beater and dough hook attachments, but mixing by hand is also an alternative. If using a standing mixer, measure all the dry ingredients, except for the salt, into the mixer's bowl. Using the flat beater attachment, mix everything together well.",
      "3. Add the salt and mix again.",
      "4. With the mixer set on a low speed, add the eggs, one at a time.",
      "5. Slowly add a little over half of the water.",
      "6. Increase the mixing speed and add the softened butter.",
      "7. Increase the mixing speed again and continue adding the remaining water slowly.",
      "8. Replace the flat beater attachment with the dough hook and knead the dough until it is elastic and pulls away from the sides of the bowl.",
      "9. Shape the dough into rolls. (The one in the photo is formed from a piece of dough weighing about 50 grams and this is a good average size for these rolls.) To shape, roll each piece into a ball, pinching the dough together at the bottom to tighten the surface of the ball.",
      "10. Place the balls on the baking sheets, either oiled and floured or lined with parchment paper. With scissors, cut a cross in the top of each of them.",
      "11. If you want to complete the rolls right after making the dough and forming it into balls, spray the balls with water and let them rise until they have about doubled in size. They do not have to be covered. (Rising times vary. A good estimate is about 1 and 1/2 hours.)",
      "12. While the rolls are rising, preheat the oven to 500\u00b0F. When the rolls have risen, spray them with water again and sieve some flour over them.",
      "13. Place a pan of water on the bottom rack of the oven, and a tray of rolls on the middle rack. Turn the oven temperature down to 400\u00b0F and bake the rolls for 5 minutes. Open the oven door and spray the rolls. Bake another 5 minutes and spray the rolls again. Bake for a final 5 minutes. (Bake 1 sheet of rolls at a time if 2 trays will not fit together on the same oven rack. Standing at room temperature won't harm the rolls that wait.) Remove the rolls to racks. Total baking time is 15 minutes.",
      "Note: The rolls may be formed, and the crosses cut in them and then, instead of leaving them to rise and then baking them, they may be placed in the freezer on the prepared baking sheets. When the rolls are frozen hard, cover them with plastic wrap, and leave them in the freezer until the day you want to bake them. The rolls will thaw and rise in approximately 4 hours, but once risen and ready to bake, can wait at room temperature longer than that before going into the oven. (This dough isn't delicate.) Just before putting them into the oven, spray the rolls with water and sieve flour over them. Then, bake according to the instructions above."

It will take about 8 minutes. When it's done, remove it with a slotted spoon to a plate lined with paper towel. While the pancetta cooks, pour the chicken stock into a saucepan and get it on the stove either right next to or right behind the skillet. Let it warm up gently over medium low heat.",

Add the rice to the skillet and let it lightly toast up in the pancetta fat for less than a minute. Pour in the white wine and let the rice almost completely absorb it.",

When it's absorbed, repeat with another couple of scoops of the warm stock. Keep up the process until the stock is all completely absorbed into the rice and the rice is perfectly tender. The whole process will take about 20 minutes. Take the pan off of the heat.",

That can be a great snack for later! Stir the butternut squash, pancetta and smoked gouda into the rice and the risotto is done! Scoop it into bowls and serve with extra chopped sage on top. Enjoy!"

      "It is a simple process that starts with your tea kettle. Get it full to the fill line and put it on a small burner on your stove on HIGH.",
      "While your water heats to boiling, pour some sugar in the bottom of your pitcher. Make sure your container is room temperature. I broke a glass pitcher once thinking I could pour boiling water into it minutes after it came out of the fridge. It shattered.",
      "Keep pouring sugar in, this IS sweet tea. Use the entire amount, or more or less depending on your taste. Just skip this part for unsweetened tea.",
      "It is important to get the sugar in the pitcher before the water and tea because you want to make a simple syrup",
      "so the sugar completely dissolves and spreads throughout your entire batch of tea instead of settling on the bottom.",
      "Once your sugar is ready, it's time to get your teabags prepared. My mom taught me to rip off the paper tops and tie all the teabags in a knot at the top.",
      "So, your sugar is in the pitcher, the bags are tied, but NOT in the pitcher and your teakettle is boiling. Get a wooden spoon, pour the boiling water into the pitcher and stir, stir, stir! You want the sugar to dissolve and mix while the water is still hot.",
      "Here is the little trick: get the water and sugar mix spinning, pull the spoon out and drop your teabags in. They will spin enough to dunk under the water and start brewing without the force of water breaking open the bags and spilling tea.",
      "Let it brew 15-20 minutes for a light tea and longer for a stronger tea. Pull the tea out and toss those teabags in the compost!",
      "The last step is to add a little bit of cold water to dilute the tea and cool it down before going into the fridge. You just want to add a couple cups or your tea will get too weak. Alternatively, you can just fill glasses with ice, pour the warm tea over and serve immediately.",
      "Enjoy!"

When they float to the top and have a nice golden brown color, about 3 minutes, remove them with a slotted spoon and transfer them to a paper-towel-lined sheet tray. Sprinkle lightly with kosher salt and bring oil temperature back to 400\u00b0F. Add remaining half of the sprouts to the oil and repeat the process, adding the chilis in the last minute of frying the second batch.",

      "Note: The temperature of the oil is very important. If the temperature is low or the Brussels sprouts are cold or damp, it will bring the temperature down too low and the sprouts will be soggy, not crispy!"

Then tuck the top layer of dough underneath the bottom layer and press together with your fingers or a spoon. Brush the top crust with remaining egg white and sprinkle the top with large crystal sugar. Cut 4 slits into the top of the pie.",

Bake in a foil-lined pan until very soft when gently squeezed or pierced, 50 to 55 minutes. Remove from oven. Halve it lengthwise and, when cool enough to handle, scrape flesh into a bowl. Mash thoroughly with a fork to break up the fibers and remove any dark spots left from the eyes or ends of the potato (they'll create imperfections in the roll, which are completely edible but a little visually off putting). Measure 1/2 cup of potato puree for the rolls and save leftovers.",
      "In the bowl of a stand mixer, stir together yeast, 1 tablespoon sugar, and warm water with a spoon. Let it stand for 5 minutes (see notes), or until the yeast looks noticeably bubbly. Meanwhile, fit the mixer with the whisk attachment.",
      "To the yeast mixture, add 3 tablespoons sugar, 1/2 cup mashed sweet potato, 3 tablespoons butter, salt, 1/4 cup flour and eggs. Whisk on low speed until combined with butter broken up into small pieces. Add 31/4 cups flour and mix with the dough hook on low speed until all the dough is wrapped around the hook in a smooth mass (about 1 to 2 minutes). If some flour settles in the bottom of the bowl, stop mixing, stir, and continue mixing so it incorporates. Pinch the dough with your thumb and a couple fingers. If it's very sticky and stays on your finger (or if it won't form a mass around the hook on low speed), add 1/4 cup flour and mix again until the dough is smooth. Gently scrape the dough off the hook.",
      "Pour the vegetable oil down the side of the bowl near the bottom, then quickly turn dough with your hands or a rubber spatula to coat the ball. Cover bowl tightly with plastic wrap and let it rise in a warm place for 1 hour (up to 90 minutes).",
      "Punch the dough down once (firmly, with a fist, but not like you're trying to knock it out). Let it rest for 2 minutes while you lightly grease a 9 by 13 inch pan with 1/2 tablespoon butter. Turn dough onto a lightly floured cutting board or counter top. Cut into 12 approximately equal pieces and form each into a ball-barely rolling and just pushing in the corners and shaping gently between your palms. Arrange balls in rows in the prepared pan, cover with a dish towel, and let them rise again in a warm place until doubled, about 30 minutes. Preheat oven to 375 F.",
      "Melt remaining 1/2 tablespoon butter and brush a thin coat over the risen, unbaked rolls. Sprinkle with sesame seeds and sea salt, then bake until light golden and crusty on the outside, about 16 to 18 minutes.",
      "Serve warm or at room temperature. If sealed in a plastic bag, rolls keep for a day at room temperature and another 2 to 3 days in the refrigerator. (Although don't plan to pass them off as fresh! They become slightly more dry and chewy, which can be disguised if toasted.)",

If it doesn't do this, it's too dry and needs more stock. If it's overly runny, it needs a bit more cooking to allow the extra stock to evaporate.",

    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "For the biscuits:",
      "Cut cold butter into 1/2-inch cubes. Beat buttermilk and one egg lightly in a small bowl. Toss grated cheese and chives with 1 tablespoon of extra flour to coat. Refrigerate butter, egg mixture, and cheese until needed. Preheat oven to 425\u00b0F with rack in middle and line a half sheet pan with parchment. Set up a stand mixer with whisk and have paddle attachment ready. Clean and lightly flour your workspace and a rolling pin. Beat remaining egg with a tablespoon of water and set aside.",
      "In mixer, whisk flour, baking powder, and salt on low to combine. Add cold butter and whisk on medium-low until butter is in pea size chunks, 1-2 minutes. Switch to paddle attachment and add buttermilk mixture all at once and mix on low until barely combined. With mixer running, add cheese and chives and mix briefly until a cohesive dough has just formed. If there are some loose crumbs or flour in the bottom of the bowl, they can be incorporated while kneading.",
      "Turn mixture out onto prepared surface and press it all into a single mass. Knead mixture about 6 to 10 times, each time pressing it down with the heel of your hand then folding the farthest edge back toward you, until combined well but still cold. Resist the temptation to keep kneading. Press dough into a short log, then roll out to a thick, 10 by 5 inch rectangle. Using a knife or board scraper, cut straight down to divide dough in half lengthwise, then crosswise into quarters. Place biscuits gently on prepared baking sheet, brush liberally with reserved egg wash, and bake 20-25 minutes, rotating the pan once. Biscuits are done when risen, fluffy, and just golden. Cool a minute or two on pan then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.",
      "For the garlic chive butter:",
      "Using a fork, or in a food processor or electric mixer, mix garlic salt into softened butter, and the chives. Taste and add more garlic salt as desired. Refrigerate butter in a small air tight container until firm.",
      "To assemble the sandwiches:",
      "Whisk egg well with a splash of milk plus pepper and set aside. Have all other ingredients out and ready to go. While heating a dry nonstick or cast iron skillet over medium, halve biscuit(s) and spread each half generously with mayonnaise. Toast cut side down in hot pan until browned and warm, about 3-5 minutes. Set biscuits face up on plates or a cutting board and spread with a little garlic chive butter.",
      "Turn heat down slightly and cook prosciutto slices for a minute or two on each side in a single layer, until slightly rendered and warm, but still pliable. Arrange 1 slice on each biscuit half (2 slices per sandwich). Add remaining garlic chive butter to skillet. Once melted, pour in eggs and cook until beginning to set. Use a spatula to divide roughly into 4 rectangles, then flip pieces over and cook until done. Salt lightly if desired, keeping in mind the garlic salt in the butter. Place fried eggs on each biscuit bottom, stacking remaining prosciutto and biscuit tops to form sandwiches. Serve immediately (keep warm on a covered tray or plate in a low oven if you're making a lot of sandwiches).",
      "Notes:",
      "1. Prep and cook times INCLUDE biscuit preparation. If you've never made biscuits before, allow a little extra time to work slowly.",
      "2. Biscuit recipe yields 8 biscuits, twice as many as needed. Freeze or eat the extras, or buy more sandwich ingredients to serve a crowd!"

      "Prepare the frosting next. Combine the chocolate and milk in a microwave safe bowl. Microwave the mixture for a minute to a minute and thirty second, until the chocolate is melted completely. Stir it together to become a shiny, easy ganache. Add the butter to the bowl of a stand mixer and whip it up with the paddle attachment until it is fluffy. Pour the ganache in and let it get completely beaten into the butter. Slowly pour in the powdered sugar with the mixer on low speed until the gorgeous frosting forms. Set the frosting aside.",
      "It's now time to make the crepes! Take the batter out and whisk the melted butter into it. Heat the canola oil in a 10 inch, shallow non-stick skillet or crepe pan over medium high heat. Pour 3/4 of a cup of the batter into the center of the pan and swirl it around to completely coat the bottom of the pan. Let the crepe cook on the first side for about 2 minutes, then flip it to do the same on the other side. Repeat this process with the rest of the batter until you have 6 crepes. This recipe can actually yield 7, but I made an insurance policy of one possibly tearing, falling apart, burning, and all other manner of crepe catastrophes. Fill the extra with nutella for a treat! Set the crepes aside and let them cool completely for a few minutes.",
      "Once they are cooled, it's time to assemble the cake! Put the first crepe on a cake stand and scoop three or four huge spoonfuls of the cannoli cream onto it. Spread it out evenly and add the next crepe on top of it. Press it down to make the layers really adhere to each other. Repeat until all of the layers are formed, finishing with the sixth crepe on top. Gently frost the cake with an offset spatula on top and around the sides. Sprinkle the shaved chocolate and lots of extra mini chocolate chips on top. Slice and serve immediately! It will also keep in the refrigerator for a day, so it's great for making ahead."

    "title": "creamy chickpea soup",
    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "Starting the night before, place the dried beans in a bowl and cover with water. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let rest until needed. Drain the beans and place in a pot and cover with fresh water. Bring the water to a boil, then decrease to a simmer and cook until the beans are tender. This may take 30 to 45 minutes depending on the beans. Drain and let sit in a colander while you prepare the soup flavor base.",
      "In a large soup pot, heat the oil and then add the pancetta, carrots, onion, celery and garlic. Cook until the vegetables are tender and the pancetta pieces are lightly browned. Remove about 1 1/2 cups of the chickpeas and set aside until later. Return the rest of the chickpeas to the pot with the vegetables and cover everything with broth by at least 1 inch. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and slowly simmer for another 20 to 30 minutes or so to develop and meld the flavors. Season with salt and pepper. Puree the soup until thick and smooth, adding additional broth as needed. Return the soup to the heat and stir in the chickpeas you had set aside early.",
      "Serve in individual bowls topped with some cracked black pepper and a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil. Sprinkle top of soup with the crispy pancetta bits and serve.",
      "Note: this soup, called Zuppa di Ceci here in Italy, is typical of the \"cucina povera\" style of cooking when you could create a filling warm dish for your family with a handful of dried beans and a few additional readily available ingredients to flavor the dish . To serve this soup, all it really needs is some cracked black pepper and a drizzle of really good extra virgin olive oil, but it is also great with some crisp pancetta bits as shown in the photo too. This soup freezes well, and actually improves in flavor the next day, so is yet another great soup that can be made ahead of time. Like all soups of this type, serve the soup very warm but not steaming hot so you can really enjoy the rich flavor."

Fill up one to two empty cans of water and add to the chili, more or less depending on your preference.",

I always end up adding more spices at the end so never know exactly how much seasoning I use. For this, I was very generous with the cinnamon, chili powder and cocoa. Everyone was pleased.",

      "* Ingredient note: 'vanilla sugar' is vanilla-infused sugar sold for baking in little packages in The Netherlands, and probably other places. If you can't get this where you are, you can substitute 1 teaspoon vanilla essence per package specified in the recipe, or make your own by scraping the seeds from two vanilla pods and adding both seeds and pods to a pound of caster sugar and keeping it in a well sealed jar. After about a week, the sugar will be wonderfully vanilla scented, and remain so for years. You'd want about 8-10 grams of the homemade to substitute a commercially sold sachet.",
      "Preheat your oven 200 degrees Celsius/ 390 degrees Fahrenheit. Grease a shallow, round baking tin with 9-inch diameter.",
      "Weigh the flour, caster sugar, vanilla sugar and pinch of salt and add them into a bowl. Mix to combine. Cut the butter into it with two knives until you have something that resembles the consistency of breadcrumbs, then knead by hand, preferably with cool hands, until you have a dough that holds together well and easily comes away from the bowl into a ball.",
      "Press the ball of dough into the tin, smoothing out the top; there should be a little room between the top of the tin and the dough. Brush the milk over the top with a pastry brush, then use a fork to draw a pretty pattern in the top.",

      "Cool in the pan until the boterkoek is solid to the touch, then turn out onto a cooling rack and leave until fully cool. Cut into small pieces - it will be very rich - and serve with a good cup of coffee. Boterkoek keeps very well in an airtight container, and the flavour will actually be better if it is prepared a day in advance."

Once the first half of phyllo dough is layered in the pan, evenly layer the walnut mixture on top of it. Then repeat the process of layering the phyllo with the second half of the dough to top off the baklava.",

Get the baking dish into the oven to bake at 350\u00b0F for 15 minutes. Reduce the heat to 300 and let it continue to bake for another 40-45 minutes.",
      "When there is about 20 minutes left of baking time, prepare the syrup. Combine the sugar, water and lemon slices in a sauce pan and heat it up over medium high heat. Let it gently boil for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. Once the 15 minutes is up, remove the lemon slices and stir in the honey. Take the pot off of the heat and let it cool for around 5 minutes. It needs to cool enough so that it doesn't wilt the baklava but it also shouldn't cool so much that it hardens. Stir occasionally while it cools.",
