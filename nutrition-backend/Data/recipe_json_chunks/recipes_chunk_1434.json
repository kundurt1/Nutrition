      "Without overworking the meat, loosely form it into 4 balls and place them on the griddle. Cook the meatballs over moderately high heat for 30 seconds. Using a sturdy large spatula, flatten each ball into a 5-inch round patty. Season the patties with salt and pepper and cook for 2 minutes, until well seared. Press a handful of sliced onions onto each patty. Using the spatula, carefully flip each burger so the onions are on the bottom. Top with the cheese and cook for 2 minutes. Cover with a roasting pan and cook just until the cheese is melted, 1 minute more. Transfer the burgers with the onions to the buns and sprinkle with umami dust. Top with the buns and serve.",
      "The Secret Seasoning To make simplified umami dust, use a spice grinder to pulse 3 tablespoons bonito flakes, 1/2 ounce crumbled dried kombu, and 1/2 ounce dried shitake mushrooms into a powder. Umami dust will soon be available at umamiburger.com."

Allow the mixer to beat these liquids into the dry ingredients on low speed. Pour in the club soda in a slow drizzle. Pour in only as much as is needed to wet all the ingredients completely. The dough should feel soft and firm, like a baby's bottom. Turn off the oven.",
      "Attach the dough hook to the mixer and stir the dough on medium speed for 5 minutes. This will give the dough a chance to cohere more evenly. It will also whip air into the dough, which will cut the usual density of gluten-free bread. After 5 minutes, turn off the mixer and transfer the dough to an oiled bowl. (If you do not have a stand mixer, knead the bread by hand on a gluten-free-floured surface for at least 10 minutes.)",
      "Put the bowl into the oven, with a damp towel over the top of it. Leave the bowl there for 90 minutes. The dough will not have risen much at this point. There is no gluten to stimulate rising. Accept that.",
      "Take the bowl out of the oven and turn the oven up to 450 degrees F. Sprinkle a handful of cornmeal onto a pizza tray or a baking sheet. Place the pizza dough onto the tray and start to slowly spread the dough to the outer edges of the tray with your hands. Work gently, with the heel of your hands. When the dough has reached the edges of the tray, smooth the edges with your fingers. Let the dough rest for 20 minutes. Then, sprinkle the remaining olive oil on the surface of the dough. Slide the tray into the oven and bake for 7 minutes, or until the top is browning and the olive oil has been absorbed.",
      "Top the pizza with your favorite sauce or vegetables, meats, and cheeses. Slide the tray into the oven again and bake for 10 minutes or so, until the cheese has melted and the sauce is bubbling.",
      "There are, of course, a hundred different ways to top pizza. I'm especially fond of fresh mozzarella, basil, goat cheese, artichoke hearts, and prosciutto. Feel free to play with the flour combinations in this recipe, which is only a guide. I rarely make the same one twice."

After opening, it can be stored in a cool, dry place for up to two years and used as an egg-white substitute in cakes and candies as well as royal icings and frostings (2 teaspoons of meringue powder whisked with 2 tablespoons of water equals 1 egg white). Meringue powder also contains small amounts of cornstarch and cream of tartar that work as stabilizers, creating exceptionally crisp baked meringues and pie shells.

Let the lamb rest for 10 minutes before carving.",

Two good possibilities: the 2000 Columbia Crest Reserve Syrah from Washington State and the more expensive 1999 Rosemount Estates Balmoral Syrah from Australia."

Arrange the carrots and leeks in the roasting pan to create a \"rack\" and place the turkey on it; rub with oil. (The turkey can be prepared to this point up to 1 day ahead. Cover the pan with plastic wrap and refrigerate.) Heat oven to 350\u00b0F. Roast for 1 hour. Place a foil tent over the turkey and continue roasting for 2 1/2 to 3 hours more or until an instant-read thermometer registers 180\u00b0F when inserted in the breast.",
      "Remove the roasting pan from the oven. Carefully move the turkey to a platter, pouring any cavity juice back into the pan. Cover with foil to keep warm. Set oven to 500\u00b0F. Cut the remaining 6 oranges into quarters and arrange in a shallow baking pan. Roast for 10 to 15 minutes or until brown.",
      "Meanwhile, discard the vegetables from the roasting pan. Pour the pan drippings into a 4-cup measure. When the fat separates and rises to the surface, spoon 1/3 cup of it into a medium saucepan; discard any remaining fat. Squeeze the juice from 12 of the orange wedges into the defatted broth; if necessary, add water or chicken broth to make 4 cups. Whisk the flour into the fat in the saucepan and cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, for 3 minutes. Add the broth mixture and cook, stirring constantly, until the gravy thickens and boils, 5 to 7 minutes.",
      "Arrange the remaining baked oranges with the sage on the platter around the turkey. Serve with the gravy.",

Spread garlic-herb cheese under the turkey skin instead of the traditional mixture of butter and herbs. It adds flavor to the turkey and eliminates extra chopping and dirty mixing bowls. Roasting the turkey unstuffed shaves about 30 minutes off the cooking time."
