Working in batches of 6 to 8 holes and then 3 or 4 doughnuts, fry doughnuts until golden brown, turning once, about 1 minute each side.

Also, if they take much more or less than 1 minute per side to cook, adjust oil temperature.) As doughnuts brown, transfer with a slotted spoon to racks. After the first batch, test a doughnut hole by breaking it open. It should be light and cakelike inside, not greasy. If it's greasy, either the oil wasn't hot enough or it cooked too long. Be sure to fry the doughnuts only until golden brown.",
