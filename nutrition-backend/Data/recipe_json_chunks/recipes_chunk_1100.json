      "Stuff as directed in stuffing recipe, and brush with melted butter. Place on rack in large roasting pan. Cover with 2 sheets of foil arranged to form a loose tent over bird. Roast in 325\u00b0F oven, calculating 25 minutes per pound. To cook in advance, deduct 1 hour from cooking time and remove from oven.",
      "Remove stuffing and unmould from cheesecloth into casserole. Let cool and chill.",
      "Leave foil on turkey; transfer to large platter. (Save pan drippings to make gravy.) Soak two large towels in cold water; wring and wrap around turkey and platter. Store in refrigerator overnight, keeping towels moist.",
