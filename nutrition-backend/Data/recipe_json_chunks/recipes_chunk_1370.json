    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "NOTE: Even though I called this the \"Taipei oyster po'boy\", it's really a Taiwanese-style fried oyster. It's hard to say exactly how many oysters you'll need because they often differ in size, but as sandwich-purpose goes, the only sensible/economical choice would the small/medium shucked oysters that aren't meant to be eaten raw. 30 small oysters will make one jam-packed sandwich that will be lunch-size for 2 people. Of course if your budget allows it, bigger oysters requires less work to fry and of course will be meatier. Since we're talking about size, I gotta mention the breading as well. I hate fried oysters with super thick breading. Especially small oysters which don't require something thick like buttermilk for the breading to stick. A little dip in whole milk will do the trick. But if you're using bigger oysters, as ratio goes, you may want the thickness of buttermilk for a thicker coating.",
      "NOTE 2: Then speaking of breading, the most ideal flour to use would be Taiwanese tapioca flour which has peculiar tiny granules that give the unique crunch and texture of almost all Taiwanese fried foods. It's scarce to find outside of Taiwan, perhaps only in Asian specialty food stores. So to mimic that texture, I use a combination of common tapioca flour, fine cornmeal and coarse cornmeal which isn't the same, but delicious nonetheless.\r\n\r\nThe ground white pepper and Thai basil in the recipe is so important for that \"Taiwanese street-style fried oyster\" taste. Both are irreplaceable.",
      "TO MAKE THE HOUSE-SPECIAL TARTAR SAUCE: Mix together all the ingredients evenly, then let sit in the fridge for at least 1 hour for flavours to combine.",
      "TO MAKE THE OYSTER PO'BOY: Whisk evenly all the ingredients under \"Breading\", except for whole milk, and set aside. Rinse the Thai basil leaves clean then dab-dry with a clean towel, set aside. Very gently without breaking, clean off any dirt/impurity on the oysters under a large bowl of clean water, then set aside in another bowl lined with clean towel to absorb excess moisture. The oysters should look white and pearly. Place the minced garlic in another large bowl for tossing together later with the fried oysters. Slice the Italian hero open, and remove some excess breads inside to make room for the oysters.",
      "To prep for frying, since the oysters and basil leaves will splatter, have 2 mittens plus a large pot-lid ready. Heat up 2? of vegetable oil in a pot over medium-high heat (if it starts bubbling up quickly around a wooden chopstick that's inserted into the middle, the oil is ready). Dip the oysters inside the whole milk, then coat them evenly with the breading. You can do several at a time, and leave the coated oysters inside the breading-bowl. Bring the bowl by the stove, then gently lower each oysters, one at a time, into the oil. If you don't like splatters, hold the large pot-lid with your other hand to block off any potential attacks. While is oysters are frying, do the breading for the next batch (keep the pot partially cover if need be). Once the oysters are golden-browned on all sides, remove with a slotted spoon and place inside the bowl with the minced garlic. Fry the next batch. Gently toss the fried oysters and minced garlic together.",
      "To fry the Thai basil leaves, grab all the leaves with one hand and drop them into the oil all at once, then immediate cover the pot with the lid, with only a slight opening for steam to escape. The splatter will quickly subside in a few seconds, then you can remove the lid. Fry the leaves for another few seconds until all the moistures have evaporated (no sizzling sounds), then remove with a slotted spoon, gently shake off excess oil, and place inside the bowl with the fried oysters and minced garlic. Sprinkle 1/2 tsp of ground white pepper and 1/4 tsp of ground black pepper, and toss to coat evenly. Re-season with sea salt.",
      "Lightly toast the Italian hero under broiler. Apply a generous amount of house-special tartar sauce on both sides, and I mean like almost 1/2 of the tartar sauce because we mean business. Pile those garlicky and crispy basil fried oysters on top, close the deal, and serve with a wedge of lime and tabasco sauce."

      "Make the filling: Melt 3 tablespoons butter in a large saute pan (with high, straight sides) over medium heat. Add the onion, carrot, celery, salt, and pepper. Stir to combine, then cook for about 12 minutes, stirring occasionally and lowering the heat as needed, until the vegetables are soft and beginning to brown. Add the garlic and stir-fry for about 1 minute until fragrant. With the heat now at medium to medium-low, add the remaining tablespoon butter and mix. Once it's completely melted, add the flour and stir-fry for 1 minute to get rid of the raw flour taste. Add a splash (figure 1/4 cup or so) of milk. Stir until smooth (it will be very thick and pasty at that point-that's okay). Add another, slightly larger splash and stir. Repeat this until you've added all the milk. Stir in the chicken bouillon. Cook this mixture over medium heat, stirring slowly but constantly, for about 5 minutes, or until thick enough that dragging a spoon along the bottom of the pot leaves a trail; toward the end of this time, it should reach a gentle simmer. When the gravy is thick, stir in the chicken and frozen peas. Cook another few minutes, stirring occasionally, to thaw and cook the peas. Cut the heat, then stir in the herbs. Taste and adjust the salt, pepper, and chicken bouillon as needed.",
      "Let the chicken pot pie filling cool, uncovered, until barely warm, then get in the fridge, in an airtight container, to cool completely. Adding a chilled filling to the pie encourages a flaky, crispy, browned crust. The filling will keep in the fridge for a few days.",
      "Make the pie dough: Chop the butter sticks into tablespoons. Put these on a plate in the fridge while you assemble the rest of the ingredients. Add the flours, salt, sugar, and pepper to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Stir on low for a few seconds just to combine. Add the butter and pulse on low (to prevent the flour from flying everywhere!), for 15 to 30 seconds of active mixing, until none of the butter pieces are bigger than a plump chickpea. If there are any oversized stragglers, you can squash them between your fingers (just turn off the mixer first). Once the butter is broken down, turn on the mixer again to low and slowly pour in the water. As soon as a dough begins form clumps and curds, and the sides of the bowl no longer look dusty, stop the mixer. It should not be in a cohesive ball at this point, but it should hold together when squeezed. It's better to undermix than overmix here (you can also mix more by hand). (If you don't have a stand mixer, you can make this dough by hand. Simply combine the dry ingredients in a mixing bowl, add the butter cubes, and incorporate with your fingertips. Stir with a fork while you pour in the water. Refer to the same visual cues mentioned above.) Dump the dough onto a lightly floured work surface and divide into two portions. One should be slightly larger than the other (if you have a scale, you can estimate about 350 grams for one ball, 284 grams for the other). The larger one will be our bottom crust (which needs to cover more ground), while the smaller one will be the top crust. Wrap both of these blobs in plastic, then press down to form a well-sealed disc. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours before rolling and assembling the pie.",
      "Heat the oven to 425\u00b0F. Take the pie dough discs out of the fridge, unwrap, and let hang out on a lightly floured surface for a few minutes. Roll out the larger disc into a 12-inch circle and set into a 9-inch glass pie pan. Use your fingers to gently press the dough into the corners of the pan, so it's as snug as can be. Roll out the smaller disc into a 10- to 11-inch circle. Fill the dough-lined pie pan with the cold chicken pot pie filling and use a spoon to smooth out to fill the pan completely. Top with the smaller round of pie dough. Trim any excess so you have an even 3/4-inch overhang. Use your fingers to squeeze the two layers together, then fold the overhang under itself, so the edge is tucked into the pie pan and a ridge is formed. Use your fingers to reinforce this ridge, so it's distinctly shaped, then crimp the edge of the pie crust into ruffles. The easiest way to crimp is by creating a guide with the thumb and pointer finger of your left hand, then pushing the dough outward with the pointer finger of your right hand. (If you're a lefty, flip accordingly.) Use a paring knife to cut four slits in the center of the top crust. Place the pie pan on a rimmed sheet pan (this makes getting in and out of the oven a lot simpler).",
      "Bake for 65 to 70 minutes (rotating halfway through), until the crusty is deeply golden brown. Let sit on a cooling rack for at least 30 minutes-the filling will still be very warm, but not too liquidy.",

You can refer to one of the pictures that I have uploaded to see how I arranged them. A 15x10 baking sheet will hold exactly 11 sleeves (44 small crackers).",

Take out of heat and and stir vanilla; then immediately pour caramel mixture over graham crackers to coat. You may have to use an offset spatula or knife, if this is what you have, in order to evenly spread caramel over entire surface of graham crackers base.",
      "Place in oven and bake for 12 minutes. Remove from the oven and immediately top it with the chocolate morsels. Let stand 5 minutes to allow them to melt a bit and then use an offset spatula or knife to more evenly spread the chocolate across the brickle. Scatter the cranberries,walnuts and salt evenly over the surface. You may want to try to carefully and gently press as many cranberries as you can into the dark chocolate. I somehow think that if you do that, you may have less cranberries that tend to fall off the brickle as you attempt to break it into small individual pieces.",
      "Let stand until completely cool and set, about 2 hours; but you can too, like me, place in refrigerator to hasten the cooling period. Store brickle between layers of wax paper in an airtight container in a cool, dry place, or in the fridge.",
      "Note: You may choose to use dark chocolate bars that are less sweet than the chips or morsels found in baking aisle; in this case break them into several small pieces so that you can more easily scatter them all over the graham cracker base."

The edges should end up really thin so that they don't get clumpy when you pleat them at the top of the dumpling.\r\n\r\n(5) Place 1 tablespoon of filling in the center of the wrapper.\r\n\r\n(6) Dab a little water around the edges of the wrapper.\r\n\r\n(7) Pick up the four \"corners\" of the wrapper and pull them in toward the center so the filling can settle into the base.\r\n\r\n(8) Pleat the wrapper between the corners to enclose the filling, then pinch the dough together right above the filling, where all the pleats meet.\r\n\r\n(9) This is the hard part, so concentrate now! Press the dough above the pinched center to flatten the edges to resemble a tiny flower.\r\n\r\n(10) Place on a parchment-lined half-sheet pan. Repeat with the remaining dough and filling.",

Turn the heat to low and continue to simmer until the tomato mixture gets thick and most of the moisture has evaporated. Remove from heat and allow to cool. Divide into 8 portions.",
      "Place flour, salt, and a tablespoon of vegetable oil in a bowl. Use your fingers to rub oil into the flour. Sprinkle water evenly over the flour. Use your fingers, or a wooden spoon, to combine it. After all the water is added, the flour will start coming together into a dough.",
      "Turn the dough onto the counter and knead it for about five minutes, or until a smooth, pliable dough forms. If necessary, add a little more water or flour as needed to achieve a workable consistency. Cover with plastic wrap or a wet tea towel, and allow to rest for 15 minutes or more to allow the gluten to relax.",
      "When you are ready to make the paratha, knead the dough again for a minute to warm it up and soften it further. Shape dough into a log, and use a knife to divide it into 8 equal portions. Cover portions until needed.",
      "Prepare to cook the paratha by placing about a cup of flour onto an 8-inch plate. You will need this to dust your paratha with flour as you roll. Heat ghee in a small glass dish or jar so it becomes liquid, and keep it ready, along with a pastry brush. (A teaspoon would also work to spread the ghee if you do not have a brush.)",
      "To fold the paratha, take the first portion of dough and press it with your fingers into a flat disk about 3 1/2 inches in diameter, leaving the middle a little thicker. Spoon a portion of tomato filling into the middle and use your fingers to seal up the paratha dough around the filling. Smush it down gently back into a flat disk and dust liberally with flour from the plate on both sides. Using a rolling pin, gently roll out the paratha to 6-7 inches in diameter. Do not worry about the shape. Paratha's are traditionally triangular. And if the filling escapes from the sides, it isn't a problem. Simple reign it in and re-roll, or you can smear filling onto the outside of the paratha and it will cook up wonderfully and taste just as yummy.",
      "To cook the paratha, preheat a large skillet or tava on medium heat for a few minutes. Brush with ghee and place your first paratha on the hot pan. Brush the top side with ghee.",
      "Cook for about a minute, until bubbles begin to appear all over the paratha. Flip the flatbread over and cook for 1-2 minutes. The paratha should have golden brown spots on both sides.",
      "Place the hot paratha on a plate, or in a dish, and cover it with a clean dish towel. The dish towel keeps the paratha warm, but allows moisture to escape so that it does not become soggy.",
      "Proceed the same way with the remaining portions of the paratha dough. As you get faster, you will be able to roll out a new paratha as the previous one is cooking. Enjoy your tomato paratha with whole milk yogurt or cucumber raita, and an Indian chutney. To make it a complete meal, serve with an Indian curry, a cooked vegetable side, and a green salad."

      "In a large skillet, heat the shortening. When hot, adjust flame to medium-low (you want to keep the pan hot enough to brown your flour, but you don't want to burn it). Stir flour into shortening gradually, adding small amounts at a time and stirring constantly to mix in. Use enough flour to take up the grease (mixture should be thick-not runny-but easy to stir). Continue to brown the flour until it is a deep dark brown color. A roux can burn easily, so keep a close eye on it and make sure the flame isn't too high. Browning the roux is a time-intensive process, so be patient and never stop stirring. If you see black specks or the roux smells burnt, it probably is. Throw out the burned roux and start again-a bad roux ruins the whole pot of gumbo. Just before the roux reaches the ideal color, add in the sugar, cook and stir until the mixture becomes hard and hangs together when you lift spoon. Let cool slightly.",

Pour the chocolate mix into the cooled crust and gently spread it evenly.",

If the top has cracked a bit, don't worry - the coconut will hide it! Place the tart on a serving dish, shower the toasted coconut flakes on top and slice. The crust may remain a bit soft, so use a pie server to gently lift out each piece. I like the tart's texture and flavor after sitting out for about 15 minutes, as it softens just a bit and tastes richer."

Add dried beans to weight down the crust and refrigerate for 15 minutes while you start on the filling.\r\n\r\nPlace in the oven and bake for 20 minutes. Take the crust out of the oven, remove the weights, and brush with the egg wash. Put back in the oven for another 5 minutes until golden. Set aside until ready to fill and leave the oven on.",

In a small bowl, whisk together the heavy cream with the cornstarch making sure there aren't any lumps. Add this to the milk mixture along with the butter and stir until the mixture thickens. Remove from the heat.\r\n\r\nMake sure the egg yolks are in a larger-sized bowl because you'll be adding the milk mixture to them. Add a little bit of the milk mixture and stirring or whisking to incorporate. Continue to do this a little at a time until the milk mixture is completely incorporated . Let this mixture cool slightly.\r\n\r\nIn another bowl, beat the egg whites with the 1/2 cup of confectioner's sugar until soft peaks form - should be light and fluffy. Add a spoonful or two of the milk custard to the egg whites and incorporate. Carefully, fold the egg whites into the milk custard to lighten it up. Be careful not to overmix or you will deflate it significantly.\r\n\r\nAdd this filling to the tart shell. Dust with cinnamon\r\n\r\nBake for 10 minutes, and then lower the temperature 25 degrees and bake another 15 minutes. Don't be surprised if it puffs up during cooking - it will reduce down as it cools. Cool on a rack and serve."

Dust the loaf generously with flour, from about a foot above, for a nice rustic touch.",

As long as you have whole or low-fat milk on hand, you can make it on the spot: Add 20 g (1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon) white vinegar to a liquid cup measure and top with milk until the total weight is 300 g (1 1/4 cup). It will start to curdle within minutes-voila, your buttermilk is ready to bake with.",

      "Knead the dough a few times and check the consistency. It should be smooth and dry to the touch, but soft and pliable. If it is too wet and sticky, it will incorporate some of the flour from your work surface as you knead it. You may need to add more flour, but go slow. If it is too dry, it will be hard to knead, get crackly on the outside, and be slow to spring back. In that case, add a few drops of water.",
      "Once the consistency feels right, shape the dough into a disk shape and begin to roll it out with a rolling pin (I think the plain old wooden broom handle types are the easiest for this). Rotate the dough as you roll. Sometimes it may seem as though you aren't getting anywhere because the dough will keep springing back, but after a certain point it will start to behave and keep its shape.",
      "Roll the dough as thinly and evenly as you can. It should be a very large and thin circle. Patch the holes with torn off pieces from the edge.",
      "Pour the oil onto the dough's surface. Use the back of a spoon to smooth it out evenly, taking care not to tear the dough. Make sure the edges are covered too.",
      "Generously sprinkle the chopped green onions all over the dough. Again, get all the way out to the edge.",
      "Generously salt and season the pancake. Most often heard complaint over three generations has been, \"It's not salty enough!\"",

Heat 2 tablespoons of butter and the oil together in a large cast-iron skillet over medium heat (I use a 12 inch Lodge cast-iron skillet). Add the onions, celery root, and fennel seeds and cook until soft, stirring occasionally, about 8 minutes. If the vegetables begin to burn, turn down the heat and continue to stir. Add the sunchokes, and continue to saute for about 3 minutes. Lightly season with salt and pepper (about a teaspoon of salt, and 4 grinds of a pepper mill, but this will depend on your tastes and the saltiness of your stock).",

Toss in with the bread mixture, combining until all of the ingredients are moistened with the stock mixture. Wipe out any burned bits from the skillet, and transfer everything back in. Dot the top with the remaining butter, and cover the skillet with foil. Bake for about 25 to 30 minutes, then remove the foil and bake for another 10 minutes, or until the top is golden.

      "Spread 3/4 cup of the frosting on the cake and spread it out evenly. Sprinkle all but 2 tablespoons of the crushed pistachios onto the frosting.",
      "Place the second cake, cut side down, on top of the frosted layer. Spread about 1/2 cup of frosting on top and spread it out in a very thin layer along the top and sides of the cake, using more if necessary, to form a crumb coat.",
      "Refrigerate the cake until the frosting is hard, about 30-40 minutes. Spread the remaining frosting on the top and sides of the cake to form a smooth, even layer.",

Make dent in the middle and pour in 1/4 cup of the water. Mix in. Add more water a spoonful at a time until you have a firm smooth dough; do not let this get sticky by adding too much water. Some days you might need a little more water, other days less. Knead this and create a ball shape. Cover with a kitchen towel and let this rest for 30 minutes.",

Fold in half, then fold and pleat the edges, sealing with your fingers using just a little water to seal the edges; create the pleated or fluted pattern with your fingers.",

My toaster is in storage so I buttered my sliced bread then toasted them, on a cookie sheet, under the oven's broiler for roughly 3 minutes per side. Once the bread is toasted, set it aside, you'll add the burrata cheese later.",

Once the greens are wilted you can use an immersion blender to blend the soup until it reaches the thickness you desire. You can also ladle the soup, in batches, into a blender if you don't own an immersion blender. If the soup is too thick, you can add additional water or broth to thin.",

I added approx 1 teaspoon of the following seasonings: turmeric, ground cumin, red pepper flakes, celery salt, and smoked paprika.\r\n\r\nRemember if you make the burrata cheese croutons they will add additional salt to the recipe. Taste the soup WITH the croutons before adding additional salt at the end of the recipe.\r\n\r\nYou can omit the jalapeno peppers if you're not into spicy food. However, even with two jalapeno peppers, I didn't consider this soup to be hot, at all."

      "To make the garlic mayonnaise: Combine the vinegar and lemon juice into a small bowl. Combine the neutral oil and olive oil in a measuring cup with a spout. Put the 2 egg yolks in a mini food processor. (Alternatively, you can do this by whisking vigorously by hand.) Using a fine Microplane, grate the garlic into the bowl of the food processor with the yolks, add 1 teaspoon kosher salt, and blend for about 30 seconds, until the yolk is pale yellow. (If blade is spinning without catching the yolk, you can add some of the vinegar-lemon juice mixture, bit by bit, until it does.) Add a few drops of the combined oil and pulse to incorporate the oil into the egg mixture. With the machine running and the hole in the lid open, add 2 or 3 tablespoons of the remaining oil a few drops at a time until the egg and oil are emulsified.",
      "Turn off the food processor, take off the lid, scrape down the sides with a rubber spatula, and add a teaspoon of the vinegar-lemon juice mixture. Return the lid and pulse to combine. Continue adding the oil a few drops at a time with the machine running until you've added about half the oil. Stop the machine again and add another teaspoon of the vinegar-lemon juice mixture. Add the remaining oil in a slow steady stream with the machine running constantly, stopping when the mayonnaise thickens to add the remaining vinegar-lemon juice mixture and pulse to combine. If at any point the mixture gets too thick, you can thin with a bit of water. If you run into any trouble with mayonnaise breaking, don't stress! See the video linked in the note above for how to salvage it.",
      "Use the mayonnaise in the egg salad or refrigerate, covered, for up to 3 days. This recipe makes about twice the mayonnaise you'll need for the egg salad-use the other half as a dip or spread (even on egg salad sandwiches).",
      "To make perfect hard-cooked eggs: Bring a large saucepan of water to a boil over high heat. Add 1 tablespoon kosher salt. (The salt is to help the whites solidify quickly if there's a crack in an egg-it doesn't penetrate the shell to season the egg.) Carefully add the 13 whole eggs, lower the heat, and simmer the eggs for 5 minutes. Meanwhile, make an ice bath in a medium bowl and create a bed of paper towels on a plate.",
      "Turn off the heat and let the eggs sit in the hot water for 5 minutes. Remove one tester egg and crack it open. The yolk should be bright yellow and firm but slightly wet in the center. If the yolk is not yet set, leave the rest of the eggs in the hot water for another minute. (Either way, if the tester egg is done to your liking, salt it and eat it as a snack.)",
      "Transfer the eggs to the ice bath to cool completely. Once cool, carefully peel them under running water, and place the peeled eggs on the paper towels to dry.",
      "To make the egg salad: Break the eggs in half to separate the whites from the yolks. Break the yolks in half and drop them into a large bowl. Break the whites into small pieces (about 8 pieces per egg) and drop them into the bowl with the yolks. Sprinkle the eggs with kosher salt, to taste. Add 1/2 cup of the mayonnaise, and aggressively stir the ingredients together using a rubber spatula until combined. (This breaks down the egg yolks, which thickens the mayonnaise and ultimately makes for a creamier egg salad.) Taste and adjust the seasoning. Serve the egg salad or cover and refrigerate for up to 2 days. To serve, transfer the egg salad to a deep serving bowl, piling it in a high mound. Sprinkle generously with the chives.",
      "To make the bagna cauda: Combine the butter, 1/2 cup olive oil, and anchovies in a small saucepan. Using a fine microplane, grate 10 to 12 cloves of the garlic into the pan and cook over medium heat until the anchovies dissolve and the garlic is soft and fragrant, 5 to 6 minutes, stirring constantly so the garlic doesn't brown. Reduce the heat to low and cook the bagna cauda for another 2 to 3 minutes to meld the flavors.",

      "To make the toast: With the oven rack in the middle position, heat the oven to 350\u00b0 F. Lay the bread slices on a baking sheet, brush the tops with olive oil, and bake for 15 to 20 minutes, until the bread is golden brown and crispy. Remove the toast from the oven and rub the oiled side of each toast with the remaining garlic clove.",
      "To serve: Give the bagna cauda a stir and spoon 1 tablespoon on each piece of toast. Put the remaining bagna cauda in a tiny saucepan or bowl with a small spoon. Sprinkle a pinch of parsley and a pinch of sea salt on each piece of toast, artfully stack the toast on a small platter or cutting board, and serve alongside the bowl of egg salad."

Transfer to a bowl, then drizzle over some olive oil -- a generous 1/4 cup, maybe, or enough to make this feel like more of a sauce and less of a salad. Add a good splash of sherry vinegar and some pepper, then taste and add whatever you need. Make it nice and acidic. Remember the potatoes will be salty, so don't over-salt it.",

Grab the plastic folded over the rim and straighten, then twist/tighten so there is little air in the bag and snip a small but of the corner. Pipe!

If you did decide to make the Barberi bread, after following the directions at the bottom of the page, place the baking sheet with the proofed dough into a 450-degree oven and set a timer for 20/25-minutes. If you decided to use storebought bread I would toast it at this point. Omit bread entirely for an amazing gluten free/low-carb brunch.",
      "I usually get the Aleppo Butter Sauce going next, as it's a set-it-and-forget-it step that will make your life easier when it's time to plate up, and it couldn't be simpler. \r\n\r\nAdd unsalted butter to a cold saucepan, along with 1 tablespoon of olive oil (to keep the butter from browning), crushed Aleppo pepper, and a good pinch of salt and fresh cracked black pepper. Turn heat on low. By the time your butter has completely melted, the Aleppo Pepper will have bloomed beautifully, adding great depth of flavor. Turn off heat and let sit while you prep the yogurt and poach your eggs. Then turn the heat back on once you start plating, and the sauce will be the perfect temperature when you're ready to eat.",
      "For the yogurt base: add yogurt to a large mixing bowl. Add fresh cracked pepper, crushed fennel seeds, garlic, shallot, and chopped tarragon, as well as the zest and juice of half a lemon. Drizzle in 1 tablespoon of olive oil, whisking until smooth and fully combined. Add salt to taste. I usually serve this at room temp, but you can throw it in the fridge no problem; it's great cold.",
      "To poach the perfect eggs, grab your room temperature eggs and crack them into a ramekin or short edged mug. If you prefer to discard excess whites, you can crack your eggs individually into a tea strainer and let them sit for a few seconds before transferring them into your ramekin/mug, but this is totally optional, and I never do it at home. I don't put anything like vinegar or lemon juice in my water - just straight up normal water goes into a medium saucepan, enough to fill it up halfway. Heat until the water is at a rolling boil, and then turn off the heat. When the water is calm, slowly lower your eggs into the water, and let sit still for exactly six minutes. Voila! Perfect poached eggs. Drain over a paper towel, and start heating up the Aleppo sauce.",
      "In small bowls, distribute the spiced yogurt and lay one of your perfect poached eggs on top. Generously drizzle warm Aleppo Pepper butter sauce over the top, and garnish with your choice of herbs. I use chives or cilantro/parsley stems. Enjoy with bread or with a spoon for a gluten-free alternative",
      "(Very Optional) To make the Easiest Mediterranean-style Barbari Bread, maybe ever, wind the clock back one or two days. If you don't want to do this, just grab some interesting country-style bread from your favorite bakery. When you have five minutes (it's so quick!) start by whisking the active dry yeast into lukewarm water and stirring to combine. Then combine the dry ingredients above in a large mixing bowl, and whisk until homogenous. Add the yogurt, olive oil, and water + yeast mixture, and stir vigorously with a fork until a shaggy dough ball forms. Then massage with your hands, until a wet but cohesive dough ball has formed. Turn out onto a counter or cutting board lightly coated in olive oil or water, and knead for two or three minutes. The dough should be pliable, but wet. Drizzle some olive oil into the mixing bowl, drop in the dough ball, and cover. Let rise in the fridge for at least 24 hours. Once this time has elapsed, turn the dough out into a half baking sheet coated lightly in olive oil and stretch to form. Cover with a damp towel and let proof at room temperature for at least one hour or up to 6 hours. You can totally proof it for longer than 6 hours, but you should return it to the fridge to slow things down. Once ready to bake, uncover and coat with sesame and nigella seeds. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until golden brown."

I used a squat mason jar, lined with plastic wrap (helps get it out in one piece) and turned it upside-down to unmold it, so I worked in reverse, packing the salmon in first, then the olives, ending with the avocado. Once you've filled your mold, refrigerate for 15 minutes or longer to help it firm up and hold together.",

If the macarons darken too quickly, put a wooden spoon in the door of the oven to prop it slightly open. Overcooked is better than undercooked -- undercooking leads to sunken tops.

The shell should be bright red, though the meat will finish cooking in the risotto. Remove the lobster from the pot, rinse, and allow to cool.",

Most cookbooks will tell to stir continuously; I don't, and you don't have to either. You can stir occasionally; just make sure the risotto absorbs the liquid before adding more. It will become tender and creamy as it cooks. Season will some salt about halfway through so it blends well, and add the white wine. Add the tomatoes with their juices. 4 cups of broth works for this recipe, but use more or less as desired. I prefer a soupier risotto for this recipe since it makes the lobster that much more tender. Add the lobster meat to the risotto, and cook 4-5 minutes.",

For Confetti Cake, stir 1/2 cup rainbow sprinkles into the batter just before pouring it into the pans. Divide the batter between the prepared pans.",
      "Bake until the layers are domed and golden brown, and a few moist crumbs cling to a skewer inserted in the center of the cake, 35 to 40 minutes (40 to 50 minutes for a Bundt, 25 to 30 minutes for a 13 by 9-inch cake, and 20 to 25 minutes for cupcakes).",
      "At this point, coat the layers with syrup (https://food52.com/recipes/60584-vanilla-syrup-mixed-berry-syrup-sweet-cream-syrup-variations). After removing the hot cake layers from the oven, pierce them, still in their pans, at one-inch intervals with a skewer or paring knife. This creates channels for the syrup to seep into the cakes. Then, pour or generously brush the syrup over the surface of the hot layers, dividing it between them as evenly as you can. Transfer the soaked layers (still in their pans) to a wire rack to cool completely.",
      "When they are cooled and no longer wet to the touch, one to two hours, carefully turn them out of their pans and assemble and frost."

      "Day four: Place the fruit and its syrup in a saucepan and bring to the boil. Turn the heat down to a simmer and let cook, turning the fruit with a wooden spoon to cook it evenly, for about 10 minutes (if there is not enough liquid left to cook the fruit through, add a splash of water to help it along). The fruit should still have some bite to it, it should keep its shape, but be evenly cooked. It should all be held together with a light syrup.",
      "Let it cool completely, then, weigh the fruit (you do need scales for this! In my experience with this recipe, it produces about 750 grams of cooked fruit, so 3/4 of a kilogram). In a well-ventilated area, open the bottle of mustard essence (do not put your face close to it or try to sniff it directly and do not try to taste it or get it on your skin!) and carefully add 10-20 drops of mustard essence per kilogram of fruit or to taste-10 drops will produce a mildy spiced mostarda, 20 is not for the faint hearted! I would recommend 10-12 drops per kilogram (so 8-9 drops for 3/4 of a kilogram of cooked fruit). Bottle in sterilised jars and, if not planning on eating within the month, process the cans to seal. This is best consumed within six months as the mustard essence begins to weaken significantly after this time, even if unopened. As the essence diminishes with heat, it is best to keep the mostarda somewhere cool."

Heat the olive oil in a large, heavy pot (a big Dutch oven, perhaps?) over medium-high heat. Dry the chicken parts thoroughly with paper towels and sprinkle generously with salt and pepper on all sides. Dredge the chicken in the seasoned flour and then place in your pot in batches. Allow the chicken to thoroughly brown, about 5 minutes per side. Don't crowd the pan! Remove the chicken to a plate and repeat until all of your chicken pieces are golden and crispy-looking.",
      "Quarter the lemons, but zest one of them first; reserve the zest. (If your lemons have a thick pith, you'll want to zest all 3 and then juice them, discarding the pith; this will help you avoid a bitter sauce.) Add the onion, quartered lemons (or zest of 2 lemons and the juice of all 3), fennel, garlic, green olives, the remaining 2 teaspoons of smoked paprika, and cinnamon to the pot; cook until softened, golden, and overall mushy-looking, about 10 minutes. Taste for salt. Sprinkle the mixture with the remaining tablespoon of flour and stir over the heat for two minutes. Add the tomatoes and the wine and bring to a boil -- let bubble away for a minute or two. Add the lemon zest.",
      "Place the chicken pieces back into the pot, skin side up, along with any drippings from the plate. Poke the onion/fennel/garlic/olive mixture so it surrounds the chicken on all sides. Place in the oven, uncovered, and bake for 30 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through.",

Divide into 3 equal pieces (each is 3 inches) and cut each third into 12 equal pieces that are about 1/4 inch thick. Place on baking sheet with either parchment or silpat and bake for 10 to 12 minutes turning baking sheet around halfway through baking (5 minutes). BE CAREFUL NOT TO OVERBAKE! Remove from oven when edges start to turn a light brown. If you leave them in longer than the prescribed baking time they become overdone and are really crunchy. I took out my batch of cookies at 11 minutes. They were just right. It's almost counterintuitive, but it's important for this recipe to adhere to the bake time."

The bread has to be at least a day old and depending on the type of bread and how humid the dough is, you may need more or less milk. The bread should soak up the milk completely and neither be floating in milk or have any dry parts.",
      "Remove the pork and gizzards from the pan and put in a food processor. Discard the vegetables. Pulse 7 or 8 times, you want the meat to be grainy and not pureed. Add the liver with the onions and the sausage and pulse 4 or 5 more times. Don't over do it. Take the meats out of the food processor and put in a big bowl.",
      "In the food processor (no need to wash it) add the soaked bread, squeezing out any excess milk, add the 2 egg yolks, 2/3 of the boiled chestnuts and puree well. If the mixture is too dry add a little extra milk.",
      "Add the bread and chestnut puree to the bowl with all the meats, add the parsley, nuts and remaining chestnuts and mix with your hands very well to combine all the ingredients together. Season with salt and Sechuan pepper (it adds a little lemon taste) and some lemon juice. Taste and rectify the seasoning to your liking.",
      "Make a ball with the stuffing and on a countertop roll it into a log form on breadcrumbs. As the meats are crumbly and not pureed, keep pressing the mixture together. Put the meat on an aluminium foil and roll the foil around, pressing together the mixture. Chill 6 hours or overnight",
      "Take the stuffing out to room temperature at least 1 hour and then cook it in a pre-heated oven at 350 degrees F in the turkey juices, basting the stuffing while it browns. Remember the stuffing is already cooked, it needs to warm up and get some flavour from the turkey.",

If you don't want it to be that spicy, leave the flakes whole and feel free to reduce the amount to 1/4 cup. Toast the flakes in a dry skillet over medium heat until they are dark brown, but not black. This usually takes 4-5 minutes. Add the ground flakes, if using, for just the last 2 minutes. Add tomato sauce and water. Let simmer 5-10 minutes. Add salt and sugar and let simmer another 2-4 minutes. Taste for seasoning. Especially salt. It will taste very bland and too tomatoey without enough salt. Cool and refrigerate. This salsa tastes better when cool or cold. Enjoy!!"

Reduce the heat to medium and, stirring every so often so that the tomatoes don't burn, cook for 1 hour 30 minutes or so, until the tomatoes have thickened completely. Remove the tomatoes from the heat, taste, and adjust seasonings as needed. Allow the jam to cool. Remember that it will thicken up as it cools, so don't overcook the jam.",

Beat together your brown sugar and butter until well combined, at least 3 minutes, then add in your eggs, one at a time, adding the next only after the last one has been fully incorporated. Scrape down the bowl as needed throughout this process. Add in your sour cream, and once it has been fully mixed in, add in the olive oil and mix until incorporated.",

Add 1/3 of the flour mixture to the batter, then add 1/2 cup of your milk, allowing it to fully incorporate before adding another 1/3 of your flour. Mix, add the remaining 1/2 cup of milk, and finally add in the last of your flour. Scrape down the bowl and be sure that the batter is evenly mixed. Fold in your corn kernels and your chopped basil.",

      "For assembly, cut out a small hole in the top of your muffins using a paring knife or a cupcake corer. Fill each hole with your tomato jam, then use a piping bag or plastic bag with the tip cut off to pipe a small dollop of ricotta on top of each hole. Top with a few pieces of basil chiffonade. These will keep well in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 24 hours, but they are best served the same day."

Line the bottom and sides of an 8x8-inch square baking pan (I used an11 x 7 x 2 inch Rectangular Pan, which worked, but the brownies are a touch thin) with parchment paper or foil, leaving an overhang on two opposite sides.\r\n\r\nIn a large heat-proof bowl, add the butter, sugar and cocoa powder. Place the bowl over a barely simmering pot of water on the stove (the bottom of the bowl shouldn't touch the boiling water so try to use a smaller pot + bigger bowl combo). Let the butter melt and stir the cocoa and sugar into it slowly. Once everything is melted, remove from the heat and give it a good stir with a wooden spoon. It'll still be quite gritty at this point. Let it cool until just warm (not hot - don't want to cook the eggs!)\r\n\r\n(make the topping)\r\n\r\nAdd the vanilla and salt and one egg. Mix well with a spatula or wooden spoon. Add the second egg and mix well. \r\n\r\nAdd the flour to the bowl and stir until no flour-pockets can be seen. Beat with a wooden spoon/spatula for another minute to get everything really smooth and uniform. \r\n\r\nPour batter into prepared pan and top with salty mixture. Bake for 25-30 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the brownies comes out clean. \r\n\r\nLet cool completely before cutting into 2\" squares.",

Leave some larger pieces of pretzel as they give a nice texture to the finished product. Pour into a medium sized bowl and add the peanut butter.

Cover the pears with a lid that's one size too small for the pot, so it helps keep them submerged (depending on the size of your pot, they'll probably slouch and lean over-that's totally fine). Adjust the heat to maintain a gentle simmer (boiling is too brash for the fragile fruit).",
      "Simmer the pears, covered, for 10 to 25 minutes. \"That's a big range!\" you say. And you're correct. But the only person who can say when your pear is perfectly done is you. Turn them every so often so they cook evenly. After 10 minutes, start checking them often so they don't overcook. To check: Pierce the bottom of the pear with a cake tester or toothpick; it should meet little resistance. Since the pears will continue to cook off the heat (thanks to carry-over cooking), you want them slightly less tender than you'd like to serve them. When they're your desired softness, remove the pears from the pot and add to a 2.5-quart baking dish. There's a good chance that some will be ready before others; totally fine-just remove them first.",
      "After you've removed the pears, raise the heat under the pot and bring to a boil. Boil for about 20 minutes, or until the poaching liquid has thickened into a syrupy consistency and measures about 1 to 1 1/4 cups, depending on how thick you'd like it.",

Add the cream cheese and mix on low until them cream cheese is mostly broken-down. Add the butter and mix on low until mostly incorporated and none of the pieces are bigger than a chickpea; this should take 30 seconds to 1 minute (if there are any stragglers, just stop the machine and smush the piece with your fingertips-don't overmix). Combine the water and vinegar in a small glass and, with the machine running, pour in. As soon as the sides of the bowl are no longer dusty and clumps and curds begin to form (it should not form a cohesive ball-that's too far), turn the mixer off; better to undermix versus overmix at this point. Remove the bowl and bring the dough into a ball with your hands. Wrap well in plastic wrap and form into a flat disc. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour or up to a couple days.

Use scissors to trim the dough to an even 1-inch overhang. Fold the edge under itself. Use your fingers to press and even out the sides, making sure the bottom corners are tightly pressed against the pan. Crimp the edges however you'd like (I like using my left hand's thumb and pointer finger as a guide, then crimping with my right hand's pointer finger, to form ruffles).

Bake on the lower rack for about 40 minutes, rotating halfway through, until the crust is starting to brown along the edges and the bottom no longer looks raw and doughy. While the crust is baking, use a fork to whisk the egg white with a pinch of salt until it's very loose. When the crust is done, remove the parchment and beans and prick the bottom and sides of the crust a few times with a fork.

Sprinkle the mix-ins on top, spreading them out as much as possible (even scooching up the sides is fine), so that you can see the cheese and crust below. There should not be a packed-solid layer of mix-ins; the custard filling needs to be able to get through. Sprinkle the remaining cheese on top. Slowly and evenly pour in the custard, taking it as high to the brim as possible. It should be on the verge of overflowing. If you have any leftover custard, bake it in a ramekin or microwave it as a snack.",

      "BAKED POLENTA\r\n\r\nLightly oil the tops and sides of a shallow 9x13 inch baking dish. Using the back of a spoon spread about 1/2 of the polenta all over the bottom. Crumble and dollop about 5 ounces Gorgonzola and 5 ounces of Taleggio evenly across the surface of the polenta layer.\r\n\r\nAdd the rest of the polenta spreading it over the cheese with the back of a spoon or an off set spatula. Work carefully to assure that the cheese is completely covered. Lay a piece of plastic wrap over the top layer of polenta, using the palms of your hands compact the polenta as evenly and firmly as possible.\r\n\r\nThe polenta may be made ahead up to 24 hours in advance to this point, left covered and refrigerated. In fact it makes the polenta firmer and is easier to cut after baking. \r\n\r\nWhen you are ready to bake the polenta. Pre-heat the oven to 350 degrees F. Remove the plastic wrap. Pour the prepared tomato sauce over the top of the polenta and sprinkle 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese over the top.\r\n\r\nBake the polenta for 30 minutes until it is browned and bubbly.\r\n\r\nRemove the polenta to cool on a wire rack for about 1/2 hour. It should firm up as it cools.\r\n\r\nTo serve slice the baked polenta into serving-sized portions and serve alongside an arugula salad. The first piece may be difficult to remove from the tray neatly. You may want to set it aside as a post party treat for the cook. But the other slices should come out easier.\r\n\r\nA perfect baked polenta will hold its shape, but oh so barely. It may sag a bit under it's own weight and it will ooze plenty of cheese all over the plate."

    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "Make the pea burgers. Add a thin film of olive oil to a skillet and set over medium heat. Add the onion. Saute, stirring occasionally, for about 20 minutes, until amber. Deglaze with water and lower heat as needed if they start to stick. Transfer the sauteed onions to a food processor. Add the bread crumbs, mint, garlic, Asiago, and egg. Pulse until smooth. Add the peas and salt and pulse until just cohesive-sort of chunky is good! Stir in the scallions by hand. Form into 4 patties. Chill in the fridge for at least 1 hour, preferably longer.",
      "Make the mushroom \"bacon.\" Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0 F. Combine the mushrooms and the 3 tablespoons olive oil on a sheet pan. Season with salt, black pepper, and red pepper flakes and toss. Bake for 50 minutes to 1 hour, until deeply browned and crisp. (They'll continue to crisp as they cool.) Spread onto a paper towel-lined plate. (These can be made a couple hours in advance.)",
      "When you're ready to eat, add a 1/8- to 1/4-inch-thick layer of canola oil to a large skillet, preferably nonstick. Set over medium heat. When the oil is shimmery, gingerly add the patties. Fry for about 3 minutes per side, until deeply browned. Transfer the patties to a plate and let rest for about 10 minutes-this helps them gather themselves before being eaten. Top with a big smear of ricotta, some mushrooms, and a few mint leaves. Sandwich between a bun."
