Saute onion. Make sure heat is low and add garlic to taste. (I use about 1 1/2 tablespoons of the minced garlic in a jar.) Add mushrooms. You may need to add more oil or some margarine as you do this. Add about a tablespoon of cumin and either the Mrs. Dash, the jalapenos or just some of the adobo sauce and maybe part of a pepper or two, depending on how spicy you like it. Add the flour and stir with a wisk, then add the whipping cream. Let it cook for a while on medium high heat, reducing temp if it boils too much. Stir with a wisk frequently. Test the taste and add more of any spice that you like. When cooked several minutes, serve by placing pasta in bowl, spooning sauce on top and then adding chicken, or add chicken to sauce, then spoon over pasta. I like to add olive oil to the water when cooking the pasta, and do not cook it too much, just until done. Also, if the sauce is too thick or too spicy, add some of the pasta water to it. You can change this recipe to your liking by adding or leaving out ingredients. You may like to add bell pepper when you add the onion, or cook some broccoli or asparagus and spoon on top."

Go surf the interweb or something until the rice is done. Allow the rice to cool for a few minutes so it doesn't wilt the lettuce, and mix in the black olives. Spoon rice and olives mixture into the center of the plate atop the lettuce. Arrange chunked pineapple and cherry tomatoes around plate. Sear the tuna (do not overcook - should still be pink inside) on grill or in a pan, and place on top of the rice. Sprinkle bleu cheese over plate, and drizzle dressing over all. Serve."

Cook, swirling the pan, until the butter turns a nutty brown, about 30 seconds. Pour into a small bowl and let cool. Stir in oil. Using a fork, slowly stir the butter-oil mixture into the flour until the mixture is crumbly. Gradually stir in enough ice water (1 to 2 tablespoons) so that the dough will hold together. Press the dough into a flattened disk.",

Fold the edges under at the rim and crimp. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and refrigerate while you prepare the filling.",

In a small bowl combine sour cream, honey, and ginger and mix until blended and smooth (reserve in the refrigerator for garnish). Scoop out the flesh of the squash with a spoon and add to the boiling stock. When all squash flesh is added turn off the heat and add heavy cream and butter. Blend with a stick blender or in small batches with a regular blender until really smooth (being careful of hot liquids in the blender). Adjust seasoning and let soup stand for 10 minutes Before serving. Garnish with your ginger cream (I put mine in a plastic squeeze bottle but a dollop from a spoon is always nice as well.)"

      "First in a 16 qt pot put the cans of tomato juice, tomato paste, diced tomatoes and chili beans. Add water in the cans the tomato paste came in, about 2 cans full rinsing all the tomato paste out of them. It won't hurt to use hot water. Stir well so that the tomato paste starts to dissolve and bring the pot to a slow boil. Once this happens reduce heat to medium and let it simmer adding one pkg of the chili seasoning mix, sugar, boullion cubes or soup base, and garlic powder. Stir often so the beans don't stick or burn. While this is simmerinig, in a large skillet, sautee' the onions and green peppers in the oil until tender. Then add the ground beef and brown while using a fork to break the meat up. Add the other pkg of chili seasoning mix, salt, pepper and chili powder to the meat while it browns. This flavors it as well. Once done add it to the pot of simmering liquid. Taste test and add additional chili powder, salt and pepper if needed to suit your taste and let cook for another 15 min. Turn the pot off and stir well. Serve with whatever chili acessories you like. Personally, I like Fritos corn chips with mine, but the skies the limit. Use your imagination and go for it."
