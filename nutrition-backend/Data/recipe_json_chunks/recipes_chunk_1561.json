      "4. When the butter and sugar are creamed together (looks like frosting) scrape down the bowl and add in the remaining crust ingredients and mix until combined.",

      "6. Bake for 20-25 minutes, until the edges just start to brown.",
      "7. While the crust is in the oven, make the lemon curd. Whisk together the eggs, egg yolks, and sugar in a medium sized saucepan.",
      "8. Stir in the reserved lemon juice and lemon zest (from step 2), and the salt.",
      "9. Heat over medium heat, stirring constantly. Watch for the mixture to thicken. This will take under 10 minutes.",
      "10. Immediately when the mixture thickens, remove the saucepan from the heat. Turn off the burner. Strain the mixture into a bowl through a fine strainerto remove any clumps. This takes me a few minutes, and some stirring to get the liquid to keep moving through the strainer.",
      "11. Return the strained lemon mixture to the saucepan and put it back on the burner (which will still be warm, but off at this point) and add in the butter, stirring until it melts.",
      "12. Pour the lemon curd over the finished crust, spreading it out if needed.",
      "13. Place the baking dish back in the oven for another 10-15 minutes or however long it takes for the edges of the lemon curd to set. Remove dish from oven and set it on a rack.",
      "14. Let the lemon bars cool, and then place them in the refrigerator for a few hours before cutting and serving.",

If you want it a little stronger, I leave that decision to your taste buds.",

However, it would probably be just as great with light brown sugar, so feel free to use that if you want a slightly stronger and sweeter crumb! I added the almond slices whole, and used a fork to combine the crumbs, breaking up the almond slices as I mixed. The almond breakage wasn't uniform, so it gave a nice variation in texture and taste. Don't worry about getting to every last little almond slice.",

Once all of the powdered sugar has been added, scrape the sides of the bowl and increase the speed to medium-high and whip until fluffy, about a minute or two. Add the espresso and vanilla mixture and continue to mix at medium-high until it is completely incorporated, scraping the sides as necessary. Pipe or spread frosting onto cooled cupcakes.",

      "2. Your oil should be ready now. When the oil is ready place teaspoon sized scoops of the doughnut hole batter into the hot oil and fry for about 2 minutes on both sides or until golden brown on both sides. Remove from oil when finished and place on paper towels to absorb all the excess oil. Repeat this process until all the batter is gone.",
      "Note about the salted caramel: You can buy salted caramel sauce already made, or you can make your own sauce, or you can buy regular caramel sauce and add 2 teaspoons of salt to the 3/4 cup of caramel that is required for this glaze. You can add more salt if that isn't enough balance of salt and sweet for you.",
      "3. Preparing the glaze: In a small bowl, add the powdered sugar, salted caramel sauce, and milk and stir until smooth. As your doughnut holes cool off, place them in the glaze and then on a cooling rack. I dipped my doughnut holes in the glaze twice. If you have enough feel free to do the same thing. Repeat this process until the holes are completely covered."

Add egg whites and sugar into that mixing bowl and continually whisk until sugar granules are no longer felt when rubbed between fingertips, about 5 minutes.",
      "2. Remove the bowl and set it into your stand mixer. With the whisk attachment, whisk your egg/sugar mixture on medium-high until egg whites form stiff peaks and are completely cool. This should take 10-15 minutes. You're essentially making Swiss meringue here. You'll want to make sure your meringue is absolutely COMPLETELY cool before proceeding.",

This can take up to 10-15 minutes. It will come together, believe me. I usually place ice packs or bags of frozen veggies/fruit under the bowl while mixer is on and stand there until butter starts to harden thus bringing buttercream back together.",

Scrape down sides of the bowl and whip for another couple of seconds until everything is combined. If using it that day, keep it at room temp. Taste. If it's not salty enough for you, add more sea salt a little at a time until your desired saltiness is achieved!",

If frozen, defrost overnight in fridge, then follow refrigerated instructions for bringing back to room temp!",

Bake it for 15 minutes, then let it cool.",

      "Continue to cook stirring infrequently until the caramel starts smoking and begins to smell like it's just about to burn. It won't take long. (I stopped when it became a dark auburn color).",
      "3. Without hesitation, sprinkle in the 3/4 teaspoon salt without stirring (don't even pause to scratch your nose), then pour the caramel onto the prepared baking sheet and lift up the baking sheet immediately, tilting and swirling it almost vertically to encourage the caramel to form as thin a layer as possible. Set aside to harden and cool.",
      "4. To make the ice cream, make an ice bath by filling a large bowl about a third full with ice cubes and adding a cup or so of water so the cubes are floating. Nest a smaller metal bowl (at least 2 quarts/liters) over the ice, pour 1 cup (250 ml) of the milk into the inner bowl, and rest a mesh strainer on top of it. Remove tofu from container and drain out liquid. Add tofu to a blender with 1/4 cup of milk and blend until completely smooth.",
      "5. Spread the 1 1/2 cups (300 grams) sugar in the saucepan in an even layer. Cook over moderate heat, until caramelized, using the same method described in Step #2.",
      "6. Once caramelized, remove from heat and stir in the butter and salt, until butter is melted, then gradually whisk in all of the tofu mixture, stirring as you go.",
      "The caramel may harden and seize, but return it to the heat and continue to stir over low heat until any hard caramel is melted. Stir in the remaining 3/4 cup (250 ml) of the milk.",
      "7. Whisk the egg yolks in a small bowl and gradually pour some of the warm caramel mixture over the yolks, stirring constantly. Scrape the warmed yolks back into the saucepan and cook the custard using a heatproof utensil, stirring constantly (scraping the bottom as you stir) until the mixture thickens. If using an instant-read thermometer, it should read 160-170 F (71-77 C).",
      "8. Pour the custard through the strainer into the milk set over the ice bath, add the vanilla extract, then stir frequently until the mixture is cooled down. Refrigerate the mixture at least 8 hours or until thoroughly chilled.",
      "9. Freeze the mixture in your ice cream maker according to the manufacturer's instructions.",
      "10. While the ice cream is churning, crumble the hardened caramel praline into very little bits, about the size of very large confetti (about 1/2-inch, or 1 cm).",
      "11. Once your caramel ice cream is churned, quickly stir in the crushed caramel, then chill in the freezer until firm. (I churned my ice cream for 25 minutes then added the caramel pieces and churned for an additional 5 minutes)",
      "*If you don't have salted butter, you can add 1/8 teaspoon of kosher salt to 4 Tablespoons of unsalted butter to make salted butter.",
      "Note: As the ice cream sits, the little bits of caramel may liquify and get runny and gooey, which is what they're intended to do.",
      "Variations:",
      "Add some strong liquid espresso (or instant espresso powder) to the custard to taste, prior to churning the ice cream to make Coffee-Caramel Ice Cream.",
      "Other options might be some of the mix-ins in The Perfect Scoop, like gooey Dark Chocolate Truffles, crackly chocolate Straciatella, or Oatmeal Praline folded in at the last minute.",
      "This is also excellent served with warm Mocha Sauce although it's also excellent melting over sauteed apples or alongside a wedge of apple pie or tarte Tatin for a caramel double-whammy."

We are all so different when it comes to how much alcohol we like in our drinks as well as how sweet, etc. There is no right or wrong here, just preference. For parties, I always make extra blackberry simple syrup to have on hand for those that like it sweeter. I make the blackberry syrup because I have never been a fan of the berry pieces floating around in my drinks, clogging up the straw, etc. If you enjoy that then make sure and add some additional berries into your pitcher or glass and include them in your muddling process.

    "title": "mango pie",
    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "One of my favorite fruit pies in the summer is mango, and conveniently enough, it is also one of the easiest pies to make. This is a no-bake pie, requiring only a handful of ingredients, most of which are easily attainable. Mango pulp, unflavored gelatin, cream cheese, sour cream, water, and graham cracker crusts. I say \"crusts\" plural because this recipe will make multiple pies at once. The only unusual ingredient is the mango pulp, which comes in 30 ounce cans. I use Alphonse mango pulp, which I get from my local Indian store. This kind of pulp is already sweetened, so the pie does not require any additional sugar. If you are not fortunate enough to live within easy striking distance of an Asian supermarket, the pulp can also be found at Amazon.com. Alternatively, you can make fresh mango pulp, which defeats the ease of assembling the pie, in my opinion.",
      "In essence, the workflow is very simple. First, you dissolve 3 packets of unflavored gelatin in boiling water (you can use the microwave to boil the water). You then combine the gelatin-water with cream cheese and sour cream, and mix until combined. The heat will in effect melt the cheese and cream, and you will be left with a milk-ish looking liquid. Then you add in the mango pulp from the can, pour into your crusts, top with plastic wrap, and pop into the fridge for several hours or overnight.",
      "Note: If you want, you can pre-bake your crusts as per the directions on the package (usually this entails brushing it with an egg wash and baking it at 375F for about 5 minutes). This is optional however, and most of the time I don't bother pre-baking.",
      "The only other thing to keep in mind is that the recipe, as written, makes more than one pie. This is convenient and uses up the entire can of mango pulp. However if you can think of another use for a half can of pulp, then feel free to halve the recipe and make one pie. However, the excess pies never seem to go to waste, everyone loves them. If you're not sure what to do with multiple pies, time it so you can make them and bring a pie to a special occasion function, and the other to work or something like that. This recipe is also perfect for when you have multiple functions in the same weekend, it is a great take-along recipe (although keep in mind it has to be stored in the fridge).",
      "The sizes and number of pies I make depends on the crusts I have on hand. For this particular iteration, I used one 9 ounce crust and one 6 ounce crust and filled them to the rims. I suspect that if you use all 6 ounce crusts, you'd probably be able to get 3 pies out of it. There are also mini-graham cracker crusts available, so as long as you have multiple crusts on-hand, you can make any combination of sizes that you wish.",
      "Using a whipped cream or Cool Whip topping is a definite option with this pie. Because I lay plastic wrap on it while it is solidifying (to prevent the formation of a skin), the surface isn't smooth. Whipped cream would \"pretty up\" the surface of the pie. You can smear it right on top after the pie solidifies and make a mango cream pie. I personally just like to offer it on the side, since I prefer my mango pie slice au natural. You can also fold in the whipped cream or Cool Whip prior to solidifying the pie, but I have a feeling this would mute the mango taste too much for my taste buds.",
      "Directions",
      "1. Pre-bake the graham crusts if desired, and let cool.",
      "2. Melt the gelatin in boiling water until dissolved (can use microwave to boil the water, mine took about 3 minutes)",
      "3. Combine the cream cheese and sour cream in a bowl, and mix until combined (you can use a stand or hand mixer).",
      "4. Add the gelatin-water mixture to the cream mixture and mix until combined, using your mixer. There will be froth...don't worry about it.",
      "5. Add in the mango pulp and mix until combined. At this point, it is easy to do by hand, which will also take care of some of the froth.",
      "6. Pour filling into the crusts, and lay plastic wrap over the top, touching the liquid. This is to prevent a skin. I'm not really sure if there is enough dairy in this pie to form a skin, but I am taking no chances!",
      "7. Place filled crusts in refrigerator for at least several hours or overnight.",
      "When the pie has solidified and chilled, slice it up and serve it! This pie is light, fresh, and delicious. I frequently bring it to places and get dubious looks when I tell people that it is a mango pie, but those suspicious looks always disappear when they taste it. People always request the recipe which, by my standards, is the surest way to know something is really being enjoyed!!"

      "First, preheat the oven to 350\u00b0. Lightly grease a 4 1/2\" Springform pan with a non-flavored oil (such as canola). In a food processor, pulverize all crust ingredients. Press the mixture into the Springform pan. Use the bottom of a small shot glass to pack the crumbs into the bottom and up the sides of the pan. Pack firmly for best slicing results. Bake for 7-8 minutes, until fragrant and lightly browned. Remove the crust from the oven and reduce oven temperature to 300\u00b0.",
      "With an electric mixer, beat the cream cheese, vanilla and sugar until combined. Add the flour and continue to beat. Next, add the egg, lemon zest and salt. Beat this mixture well, but do not purposefully over beat or you will add too much air to your cheesecake batter, causing it to crack as it cools. Pour the cheesecake mixture into the crust and bake for 38-40 minutes, until the center is slightly jiggly but not wet when you lightly touch it. At this point, leave the cheesecake in the oven, but turn the oven off and prop open the door. Let sit for 30 minutes. After 30 minutes, move the cheesecake to a wire rack to cool another 30 minutes. Finally, run a knife around the edge of the pan, and then cover with plastic wrap before refrigerating the cake. All of these steps ensure that your cheesecake will not crack or deflate. Let the cheesecake chill 5 hours or overnight.",
      "About 30 minutes before you plan to serve it, make the honey-ed peaches. Toss the peaches with the honey and whiskey. Let marinate for 30 minutes before pouring this mixture over the cheesecake. Unmold the cheesecake from the pan and serve with two forks."

Once simmering, turn heat to medium low or low and allow to gently simmer and cook 5 minutes while stirring occasionally. Be sure to watch your pot-if it begins to boil your cream may boil over.",
      "2. While this is cooking, set up an ice bath: a large bowl filled with ice and water, with another bowl (preferably glass or metal) inside. My ice bath consisted of a large plastic bowl filled with ice water and ice, and then a large glass bowl set inside.",
      "3. Remove the pot with the corn mixture from heat, set it on a rack and allow corn mixture to cool in the pot for 5 minutes.",
      "4. Carefully add corn mixture into a blender or food processor and add in your sweetened condensed milk. Process and blend together until mixture is relatively smooth, about 1-2 minutes. You will still have very small pieces of corn.",
      "5. Now you can do 1 of 2 things:",

      "b. You can pour the corn mixture through a sieve or fine mesh strainer (catching any corn kernels) into your ice bath (into the top bowl, that is sitting in the bigger bowl of ice) and allow it to chill, stirring occasionally, for about 20 minutes.",
      "This step is completely up to you. Like I stated earlier, we opted to not strain out the kernels because we like a little texture in our ice cream. If you're not a fan, and would prefer a completely smooth ice cream, strain the kernels out while pouring your ice cream base into your ice bath. Whatever you choose, make sure you completely cool your ice cream base, while stirring occasionally. This should take 20-25 minutes.",
      "6. When your mixture is completely chilled, set up your ice cream maker according to your manufacturer's instructions. Always turn the ice cream maker on before you pour the ice cream base in! Pour chilled corn ice cream base into your ice cream maker and allow to churn until you reach a soft-serve/ice cream consistency! For my Cuisinart ice cream maker, this took about 25 minutes.",

      "In a large bowl or in the bowl of a stand mixer, combine flour, oil, yeast, sugar, salt, warm water and egg yolk until a dough forms. Knead by hand on a lightly floured surface until smooth and elastic. This will take about 10 minutes. Or you can knead it in the bowl of a stand mixer with dough hook attachment on medium speed until smooth and elastic for about 5 minutes.",
      "Shape dough into a ball and place in a lightly greased bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and let it rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1 1/2 to 2 hours.",
      "When dough is doubled, punch it down and divide it into 10 pieces. Roll each piece into a 3-inch long log. For each piece, flatten the dough with your palm, then fold it over lengthwise, pinching the seam to seal. Flatten again and fold over lengthwise, pinching the seam to seal. Gently shape the dough into a 6-inch long oval and place it seam-side down on a lightly greased or parchment paper/silicone mat-lined baking sheet. Flatten again lightly.",
      "Repeat with remaining pieces of dough, placing them about an inch apart on the baking sheet(s). Cover with a sheet of lightly greased plastic wrap and let the rolls rise until puffy but not doubled, about 1 hour.",
      "Meanwhile, heat oven to 350 F. Mix together the egg white and 2 teaspoons cold water in a small bowl, then brush the tops of the buns with the egg wash. Sprinkle liberally with poppy seeds. Bake buns until golden brown, about 18 to 20 minutes. Remove from oven and cool the buns completely on a cooling rack before slicing.",
      "To assemble hot dogs: Cut hot dog buns halfway open lengthwise, then add a hot dog and your favorite fixings. I top my hot dog with yellow mustard, relish, chopped onion, tomato wedges, a dill pickle spear, sport peppers and a dash or two of celery salt.",

      "Okay, so this makes a lot of frozen yogurt. Probably more than your ice cream maker can handle at one time. It was about twice the amount my Cuisinart could handle. So, I poured half of the prepared ingredients mixture into the ice cream maker and reserved the other half in the fridge until the first half was done. I didn't even have to refreeze the bowl, it had enough oomph to freeze it all. Snazzy, eh? I love Cuisinart.",

      "It took about 25-30 minutes for it to freeze in the ice cream maker.",
      "Once all your yogurt is frozen, resist the temptation to eat it all and freeze it for several hours to let it ripen and finish freezing. I just ended up leaving mine overnight. The next day it was utter frozen yogurt perfection.",
      "It's rich, it's creamy, it's tangy . . . like the kind of yummy that makes you question why you ever thought it wasn't as good as ice cream.",
      "Feel free to use this as a base for other flavor extracts or additions. I think it would be awesome with a cup of fruit added to emphasize that tanginess - like peaches or berries or mangoes or chocolate."

Bake for 10 minutes, then reduce heat to 350\u00b0F and bake for 35 to 40 minutes, until the pie is browned, puffed and set. Check on the pie after 30 minutes and if necessary, cover the crust rim with foil strips (or a pie crust shield) to prevent it from over-browning during the final minutes of baking. When the pie is done, set it on a baking rack to cool for about two hours before serving. Top with whipped cream if desired."

Using your fingers fold the crust in around the pie, pinching the seams together but leaving the center part of the filling exposed. Wetting your fingers a bit helps get a better seal on the crust.

      "5. A little olive oil to oil both the bowl in which the dough rises and the pizza pans (if they aren't lined with parchment paper).",
      "For the dough (recipe is for 2 folded breads-each divides into 8 wedges):",
      "1. In a small bowl, mix the yeast with 3/4 cup of the warm water and the sugar. Set it aside until the top is covered in a foamy froth, the color of Crayola crayon taupe. Add the 4 Tablespoons of olive oil.",
      "2. Scrape the foamy yeast mixture into a larger bowl. Add the salt, the remaining 3/4 cup of warm water and the flour.",
      "3. Stir the mixture until it begins to form a dough. Then, flour your hands and finish forming the dough by hand, pressing it together and kneading it. Once the mixture forms a coherent ball, turn it out onto a floured pastry board and continue to knead it until it is soft and elastic.",
      "4. Oil a bowl with a little olive oil, place the dough in it and cover it with a piece of plastic wrap. Let it rise for about an hour (or longer, if the room temperature at which the dough rises is very cool). The dough is ready when it has doubled in size-and it is not of the high rising sort.",
      "For assembling the folded breads and baking them:",
      "1. Preheat the oven to 450 F. Oil the pizza pans or line them with parchment paper.",
      "2. Divide the dough in half. Roll the first half into a 12-inch circle.",
      "3. Place the round of dough on one of the pizza pans, drizzle it with 1 tablespoon of olive oil, sprinkle it with half the garlic, parsley and oregano, and fold it in half. If the dough tears a little, pinch it back together-or not. Either way is fine.",
      "4. Bake the first folded bread on the middle rack of the 450 F oven for 15 minutes, or until the top turns a splotchy brown.",
      "5. While the first folded round bakes, form the second half of the dough in the same manner and put it in the oven when the first one comes out.",
      "6. Transfer the loaves to a rack. Cover them with a cotton towel if they are not being served right away. The bread reheats very well and is better warm. It cuts naturally into wedges for serving and is a fine accompaniment to soup or salad.",
      "Note: If another herb combination sounds good to you, probably it will be good sprinkled on this dough. Adding a grated cheese, such as Taleggio or fresh mozzarella, is an option too. And ... this bread travels well. With a salami and a round of cheese, it's a good addition to a picnic."

      "In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle (or you can use a large mixing bowl and an electric hand mixer) combine flour, sugar, baking soda, cinnamon, nutmeg and salt until just incorporated. Add eggs and oil, and mix until just combined. Add carrots, pecans and the raisins mixture and use a rubber spatula to fold them into the batter until just incorporated. Spread the batter into the prepared pans.",
      "Bake on the middle oven rack for approximately 30 minutes, or until cake pulls away from the sides of the pan and just springs back when touched.",
      "While cakes are baking, prepare the brown sugar syrup.",
      "In a small saucepan over low heat or in microwave safe bowl using the microwave, melt butter. Remove butter from heat and allow it to cool. Once cooled, whisk in brown sugar and milk until fully incorporated.",
      "While cakes are still warm, poke several small holes (I used a chopstick, skewers also work well) in the top of the cakes and slowly pour brown sugar syrup over them a little at a time. Then, using the back of a spoon or small rubber spatula, push any lingering syrup into the holes. Note: Be mindful; you don't want globs of syrup remaining on top of the cake. If this happens spoon off excess or poke holes where the extra syrup rests on the cake(s). Also, depending on the number/size of your holes, you may or may not use all of the syrup.",
      "Allow cakes to cool to room temperature, or until warm, but not too hot to handle. Remove cakes from pans and place them, hole-poked sides up on plates/wax paper/cooling racks, etc. (I recommend plates.) Cover with plastic wrap and let cakes set in the refrigerator for at least 3 hours to overnight (overnight is best).",
      "For the caramelized pecan coating:",
      "Place butter, brown sugar, honey and cinnamon in a large skillet over medium-low heat. Heat until majority of the butter is melted. Add chopped pecans and stir to coat. Cook over medium-low heat until sticky, fragrant and lightly toasted. Set aside to cool completely. Note: I put mine directly in the freezer for approximately 5-10 minutes. They cooled quickly and were easier to work with, as they were less sticky to the touch. I was also pressed for time.",
      "For the frosting:",
      "Using a stand mixer fitted with a whisk (or a handheld mixer), beat cream cheese and butter until fluffy and well incorporated. Add sour cream, salt, vanilla extract, and the seeds that you scraped from the vanilla beans at medium-high speed until well combined, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed. Add confectioners' sugar and mix until frosting is very light and fluffy(approximately 1 minute).",
      "Set aside.",
      "Note: Frosting can be made ahead of time and stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator until ready to use. When ready, let it sit out for approximately 15-20 minutes and give it a quick whipping with the mixer to lighten it up again.",
      "To assemble:",
      "Place one of the cakes, poked-hole side up, on a serving plate lined with strips of parchment (to catch frosting/pecan spills). Spread the top of it with a layer of frosting 1/4-1/2 inch thick. Place second layer on top and apply a crumb coat. For the crumb coat, start on the sides of the cake, applying a layer of frosting 1/8-1/4 inch thick, moving your frosting knife or offset spatula in a full circle around the sides. Make sure it's thin and do not aim for beauty. The point is to catch cake crumbs and lock them into the frosting. Do the same along the top of the cake, being sure to remove any excess frosting.",
      "Be careful not to backtrack, as this may cause larger bits of the cake to crumble away, too large for the frosting to hold. Place cake in the refrigerator and let crumb coat set (approximately 15-20 minutes).",
      "Once set, remove the cake and, beginning with the sides and ending with the top of the cake, apply a thicker layer of frosting, smoothing as you go. If you have frosting leftover, you may do some piping around the edges (I simply used a clean finger to create a swirl pattern on top).",
      "To finish, take handfuls at a time of caramelized pecans and gently press them into the sides of the cake.",
      "Pull parchment strips from beneath the finished cake and store cake in the refrigerator, loosely covered, until ready to serve."

Take the icing scraper again and take off excess coating until you get a smooth finish on the sides and top of the cake. This is the base coating. Refrigerate for an hour until the frosting sets. Your cake is now ready to be decorated.",

Also, if you're making these muffins outside of blueberry season and frozen berries are all that's available, frozen berries that have been thawed have a tendency to bleed, turning the baked goods blue (which doesn't really matter so much in these muffins since their color is brown, but it can be a bit off-putting in lighter colored baked goods). If fresh blueberries are in season, you can use them; however, just be sure to gently toss them with a small spoonful of flour before adding them to the batter. Alternatively, you can flash-freeze fresh blueberries and not worry about tossing them with a little flour."

Place the naked ears (teehee!) back on the grill and turn every 1-2 minutes, or until as many kernels as possible have browned and caramelized. Brown equals sweet flavor!",

      "First of all, chicken stock is made from the bones and broth is made from the meat. Stock congeals when it cools due to the high levels of collagen from the bones but becomes liquid when reheated. It also has A LOT more flavor when done right. The cheapest way to do this is to save your chicken bones after dinner and put them in a gallon-sized plastic bag in the freezer. You can also save raw trimmings of skin, backbone, etc. I figure that two full bags equals about three pounds, or the bones from two chickens. Remember, you don't need to thaw the bones and trimmings out before using.",
      "Cut carrots, celery, and onions into large chunks...just small enough to fit in a stock pot. Use the skins, leaves, everything. They all add more flavor. Don't peel the garlic, but just smash them to release some flavor. Add all ingredients except salt and pepper to a large stock pot and then add enough water to just cover everything. Bring to a boil over high heat and then reduce to a simmer. Now just leave it alone and let simmer until reduced by half (at least 3-4 hours). Stir about once an hour.",
      "When reduced to half, remove from heat and allow to cool a bit. Remove as much of the bones and vegetables as you can with tongs or a slotted spoon. Then strain the rest of the liquid into a large bowl through the finest mesh strainer or colander you have. Add salt and pepper to taste. Let sit in refrigerator for 24 hours so all the fat solidifies on top. Then, skim off fat, portion into freezer bags, and freeze. Makes about 8 cups of stock.",
      "Since this is so cheap and it yields so much, it's easy to use it to improve the flavor of many everyday foods. Use it when making rice, simmering canned green beans, or just use it for some quick and awesome homemade chicken soup."

      "3. Next, remove the paddle attachment, switch to the dough hook and knead the dough in the mixer on low speed for about 5-6 minutes. Sprinkle dough with more flour (tablespoon at a time) if necessary, to keep dough from sticking to the sides. Knead until dough stops sticking to the sides of bowl, is smooth, and springs back when pressed with your finger.",
      "4. Remove dough from mixer bowl and add it into another lightly greased bowl. Cover top with a hand towel and allow to rest and proof in a warm area for about 45 minutes to an hour. It will have almost doubled in size!",
      "For the pan sauce:",
      "1. In an 8\"x8\" glass or metal baking dish, spread the butter along the bottom and up the sides. Keep butter heavy along the bottom and lighter up the sides. Combine cinnamon and vanilla bean sugar, and sprinkle over the bottom of the dish, over the butter. Set aside.",
      "For the cinnamon rolls and filling:",
      "1. Transfer dough to a lightly floured surface and roll out into a rectangle that is about 1'x2.",
      "2. In another bowl, combine your brown sugar and 3 tablespoons of ground cinnamon. Spread your 6 tablespoons of softened butter over the surface of your rolled out dough and then top with your brown sugar/cinnamon mix. Smooth sugar out so it is covering the butter evenly and press gently so sugar mix is really adhered.",
      "3. Roll up the dough as tightly as you can, starting from one of the shorter ends, and form into a fat foot-long cylinder. With a serrated knife, cut your log into 8 slices. If your log's length is shorter than a foot, cut into less slices. Arrange each piece, spiral side up, in your buttered/sugared pan and then cover the top with your hand towel. Place pan back in a warm area and again, allow to rise for about 45 minutes to an hour more.",
      "4. Once rolls have risen and puffed, preheat oven to 350\u00b0F. When oven is preheated put the dish into the oven and bake, uncovered, for about 25 minutes or until risen and golden brown.",
      "For cinnamon roll frosting:",
      "1. For the frosting, simply whisk together your powdered sugar (unsifted is fine), butter, salt, Greek yogurt, and vanilla extract until totally combined. Pour and spread over the hot, fresh out of the oven rolls.",
      "Let them sit 5 minutes to cool just slightly.",
