Add the reserved morel soaking liquid, cover and simmer over low heat until the morels are tender, about 10 minutes.",

Simmer over low heat, whisking often and vigorously, until the grits are thick, creamy and tender but still slightly chewy, about 1 hour. Stir in the milk and butter and season with salt and pepper. Add the cheese and stir until melted. Serve the grits in individual bowls, spoon the ragout on top and garnish with the remaining chopped scallion and the crumbled bacon.",

      "Chill smoked bacon, uncovered, 4 hours, then wrap well in plastic wrap and chill overnight. \"You want it to be not so pliable when you cut it.\"",
      "If the bacon's sides are uneven, \"whack them off and use them in soup or beans. At the restaurant, we dice them up and make bacon jam too. I put that on everything!\" Set a metal rack in a rimmed baking pan; repeat with a second pan and rack. Slice bacon with the grain about 1/2 in. thick, then lay slices on racks.",
      "Put pans in oven and turn to 425\u00b0 (do not preheat oven). Roast bacon just until edges are crisp, about 30 minutes, rotating pans halfway through if necessary for even browning. \"I like to render it first so some of the fat drips out, but not so much that you get shrinkage.\" Bacon can be cooled at this point, then wrapped in plastic wrap and chilled for up to 2 days.",
      "To finish cooking, either grill it (as Lettau does at the restaurant), pan-fry it, or keep roasting until it's as crisp as you like. Lettau suggests not overcooking. \"I like the edges to be crisp but the rest juicy.\"",
      "*Diamond Crystal is more voluminous than Morton's, so you need to use more of it for equivalent saltiness.",
      "Make ahead: Smoked bacon (through step 9), up to 1 day, wrapped in plastic wrap and chilled; or up to 2 months, frozen. Rendered bacon slices (through step 12), up to 2 days, wrapped in plastic wrap and chilled.",
      "What about nitrite?",
      "Brad Lettau cures his bacon without sodium nitrite, a salt used commercially to ward off bacteria. (Sodium nitrate, also sometimes used, converts to nitrite in the body.) Bacon made without nitrite tastes porkier and is browner; nitrite is what adds that familiar \"bacon-y\" taste and rosy hue.",
      "Lettau's bacon is absolutely safe to make at home because it's roasted well. But if you're considering using sodium nitrite, here's what to know. In the 1970s, studies suggested it could be carcinogenic; however, the National Academy of Sciences and the American Medical Association have since concluded that, in the small amounts typically added to food, it isn't harmful. In fact, we get nitrite from vegetables (especially celery and spinach).",
      "If you opt to add sodium nitrite to Lettau's recipe, all that's required is 1 teaspoon of pink curing salt (a mix of 25 percent sodium nitrite and 75 percent salt) for every 5 pounds of meat, mixed in with the dry rub in step The bright pink color means you won't mistake it for table salt. Find it on amazon.com."
