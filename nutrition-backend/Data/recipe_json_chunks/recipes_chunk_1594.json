Add the bell peppers, zucchini, and carrots and cook for another 5 minutes. Add the garlic, chili powder, cumin, oregano, paprika, and salt and cook for another minute. By now, your whole place should start smelling good enough to make the fucking neighbors jealous. Add the beer, tomato paste, diced tomatoes, and broth then scrap any spice shit that started sticking to the bottom of the pot. Let that all simmer together for 5 minutes. There should be some beer left in the can, sip that shit while you're waiting.\"",
      "\"Now add the beans (and the hominy if you opted for this dopeness). Stir everything and turn down the heat to medium low. Slap on a lid and let that simmer for about 30 minutes. Set a timer if your ass is easily distracted like me. After the 30 minutes, stir it around and if you still want a thicker chili take off the lid and let it simmer for another 10-15 minutes. When the chili looks legit by your standards, add the lemon juice then taste that motherfucker. Depending on the brand of tomatoes you got, you might need to add some brown sugar to balance the taste out. Taste again and see if it needs more chili powder or salt. Throw in some cayenne pepper if you like that shit hot. Serve warm and lay out some fresh toppings like red onion, jalapenos, and cilantro.\"",

      "Make the pastry: Place the cut up butter pieces in the freezer for 15 minutes to chill. Meanwhile, in the work bowl of a food processor combine flour, sugar, dry mustard, salt and cayenne pepper. Pulse to combine. After the butter has chilled, scatter the pieces over the flour mixture (still in the food processor), along with the cheddar. Pulse about 10 times. Sprinkle half the ice water over the dough, pulse about 3 times, repeat with remaining water, pulsing 3 more times. Pinch the dough to check if it sticks together, if not add a tablespoon or two more ice water, until it comes together. Dump the mix in a large bowl and press it together to form the dough. Divide dough in half, shaping each into a 4-inch disk. Wrap each piece in plastic wrap and refrigerate at least an hour.",
      "Begin the filling: Pat the meat dry with paper towels and season with salt & pepper. Heat 2 t. oil in a large skillet over medium high heat until just smoking. Add the meat in a single layer and cook, without stirring, until the meat browns well on the underside, anywhere between 5-10 minutes (the meat will give off liquid, just let it evaporate - leave it alone!) Stir the meat and cook another couple minutes, until it looses the raw color. Remove to a plate and set aside.",
      "Reduce heat to medium, add the remaining 2 t. oil and the onions and carrots. Saute until softened and starting to brown, stirring occasionally, around 5 minutes. Add the garlic, thyme and marjoram, cook until very fragrant, about a minute. Stir in flour, cook and stir about a minute. Slowly add in the beef broth and water, then the meat, along with any juices left on the plate. Bring to a simmer, then reduce the heat to low, to med-low. Cover and cook, (adjusting the heat as necessary to maintain a simmer) stirring occasionally until the meat is just becoming tender, around 45 minutes. Remove from heat, add in the Dijon and parsley. Adjust seasoning with salt & pepper. Set aside to cool.",
      "Rolling out the crust, filling & baking the pot pies: Remove the dough from the refrigerator 10 minutes before rolling it out. Roll the dough out on a well-floured surface, large enough to cut out 3, 7-inch circles out of each half (save the scraps). Line each cup of a large-sized muffin tin with the dough. (It won't look very pretty, you just kind of have your way with it to get it pressed in there.) Refrigerate the filled tins as well as the dough scraps 15 minutes to firm back up.",
      "Meanwhile, preheat oven to 400 degrees. After 15 minutes and the filling has cooled down quite a bit. Divide the mixture evenly between crusts. Divide the remaining dough into 6 balls. Roll out each piece wide enough to cover the pot pies. Pinch the top and bottom crust edges together to seal, and finish the edges in whatever decorative way you like. Brush the tops with the beaten egg. Bake 35-40 minutes, rotating the pan after 20 minutes. Remove from oven & let sit 5 minutes before (carefully) removing the pot pies from the tin."

Fold one side of the omelet over to the other side with your spatula. Let cook for another couple minutes and then slide the 2 omelets onto a plate. Cut each in half, so you have 4 servings. Top each omelet with taco sauce, sour cream, the remaining avocado, green onions and olives. Enjoy!"

Add seasoned pork to the pan and brown for about two minutes per side until golden brown. Once browned, remove meat from pan and place on parchment-lined sheet tray with a rack and set aside. Reserve fat and pan for the next step",
      "3. For the Braising Liquid: In the existing 18-inch pan over medium heat, add smashed garlic cloves, star anise, bay leaves, chili flakes, cinnamon sticks, lemon zest, sage, salt and pepper. Saute until fragrant and sage is fully wilted, about two minutes",
      "4. Add milk, lemon juice, and vanilla paste to the pan and bring to a simmer. Place pork into a 4-inch half hotel pan and pour braising liquid over the top. The liquid will be broken from the lemon juice. Braise pork for 11/2 hours or until fork-tender. When pork is cooked, remove from the pan and set aside. Strain braising liquid through a fine-meshed strainer, reserving 3 cups for the next recipe",

      "6. Using a blender, add the 3 cups of reserved braising liquid and demi-glace and blend on low for 30-45 seconds until well combined. Set aside",
      "7. Place a high-sided saucepan over medium-high heat. Add butter and brown evenly by whisking to remove any solids that form at bottom of pan. Add pearl onions cut-side down and 1/2 cup of water. Cover and let onions braise for five minutes. Add garlic to pan and saute for one minute over medium-high heat until golden brown. Add chanterelles, fresh thyme, and lemon zest; stir to combine. Cook until chanterelles begin to release their liquid, about three minutes. Deglaze with brandy and let flame burn down",

      "9. While noodle mixture is cooking, place braised pork portions in a medium saucepan, add remaining blended braising liquid to the pan and place pan over medium heat. Baste pork with sauce as it reduces to a glaze. Once reduced and at nappe consistency, turn heat off",
      "To serve: Plate portions in 12-inch entree-sized bowls. Using tongs, twist and place noodles in center of bowl. Place the glazed pork on top of noodles and nappe sauce over to coat pork. Serve hot"

    "title": "double apricot jello with whipped coconut cream (gf, df, egg, soy, peanut/tree nut free, top 8 free)",
    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "Puree, either in a blender or food processor, the can of apricots (including the liquid in the can). Boil 1 cup of water, and add the jello powder. Mix well. Next, add one cup of the apricot puree and stir. Pour into individual cups and allow to cool 2-3 hours, or until set. While they cool, take the cold coconut cream and dump out the water, only keeping the thick cream that has settled at the top. Beat the cream with the vanilla and powdered sugar (more or less to taste) until it has a thick consistency and holds stiff peaks. Once jello is set up, either pipe or spread the cream on top of the jello and enjoy!",
      "NOTES: You'll notice this is exactly how you make regular jello, only instead of adding cold water, you're adding the apricot puree. Super simple! Also, I always keep a can of coconut cream in my fridge, because I never know when I'll want a dollop of fresh coconut cream, that way I'm not having to wait 24 hours. I'd highly recommend this! You can try to do it sooner than 24 hours, but I wouldn't recommend it as the fat/cream needs time to separate from the water so it can easily be divided. If it has too much water it won't hold its shape (but will still taste yummy if you're desperate). Lastly, you find the canned coconut milk (not the cartons) in the Asian isle, and I often have a hard time finding apricot jello, so peach can do in a pinch."

Kefir does need a regular supply of minerals to keep healthy so the unrefined sugars are often best as they have a higher mineral content.

      "When your happy with the flavour strain into the plastic bottle for the second fermentation. The Kefir can be enjoyed after the first fermentation. In the second stage however, you can add some more flavours. The brew also gets fizzier with the increase in Carbon Dioxide, which results in a very refreshing drink. You can now discard the used lemons and set aside the water kefir grains for the next brew. The grains can be stored in water in the fridge for up to 1 week.",
      "Bottling for the second fermentation\n\nYou can either add 1 more tablespoon of sugar or add 1 litre of fruit juice to 1 litre of kefir for different flavours. Some great juices to use are Red Grapefruit, Lemon and Ginger, Mandarin, Orange, Pineapple or Apple and mint. Make sure you don't fill all the way to the top of the bottle to allow for gas build up. Cap the bottles, and leave in a warm spot for around18 to 24 hours before moving to the fridge to set the bubbles for another three days. Then your ready to pop the top! Watch out because it might go everywhere before you get a chance to fill your glass. But enjoy nonetheless!",

Some things to avoid in your Kefir are:\n\nChlorine in tap water can damage the grains\nPreservatives added to dried fruit or sprayed on conventional fruits\nDistilled water for long periods of time as it is void of minerals.

      "Now we take our peanuts and and our Rice Krispies Cereal and add it to our melted marshmallow butter mixture, we need to work fairly quickly, so the melted marshmallow mixture doesn't cool down. Stir these ingredients all together very well. As if we were making rice krispies treats.",
      "Now we add that mixture to a aluminum foil lined bread loaf pan and spread it out as best as we can. The reason why I use a bread loaf pan is it makes it much easier to manage, but you can use whatever pan you like. Make sure to spray the foil with non-stick kitchen spray first. Next take a sheet of parchment paper and push down the mixture to make it nice and compact. You can press fairly firmly, slide your hand across smoothing out the top and leveling it out. Once you are done, place it in the refrigerator to set for about 30 minutes or so.",
      "Now we take out the pan from the fridge. Then gently remove the parchment paper. It may or may not stick a little bit. Next we add our milk to our Caramels. Now melt them in the microwave on high in bursts of 30 seconds then 10 to 15 seconds, stirring in between until completely melted and it is nice and runny. We add milk to the caramel to make it nice and soft when it sets. Even after getting really cold in the fridge it will still be nice and soft. If you don't add milk, it will harden up, and be more crunchy, and we don't want that. Now pour the caramel over the top of the rice krispie and peanut base. Make sure to spread it out evenly with a spoon or spatula. You can spray the spoon or spatula with your cooking spray if you like.",
      "Now we melt our Light Cocoa Candy Melts or our 7 oz chocolate bar. I melt them in the microwave on bursts of 30 seconds stirring in between then once it is almost completely melted, microwave it for about 10 seconds to finish it off. Alternatively you can melt it on your stove top using the double boiler method. Now take out the candy bar base from the fridge and remove it from the pan and the foil. It should come out very easily.",
      "Now using a sharp knife that we have sprayed with kitchen spray we cut the bar into squares, or rectangles or whatever shape you want. :)",
      "Now we just dip the bars into our chocolate. Drop it in, using a spoon, spoon chocolate on top, then with a fork lift it out, and jiggle it a bit to allow access chocolate to drip off. Next place it on a parchment paper lined cooking sheet or sheet ban, or plate. Once you are done, place the candy bars in the fridge for 30 minutes to set up completely.",

Nankatai are usually made with all purpose flour but I tried baking them with wheat flour which gives them a crumbly and melt in mouth texture. The combination with wheat flour and semolina is a healthier option too. These should be baked only until the edges begin to brown. This will keep the outside crisp with a soft interior. These are delicious warm or at room temperature. They will keep very well so they make an ideal cookie for holiday gift giving."

Depending on how big your chicken breasts are, it should take about 4 - 5 minutes on each side. They should be golden brown. If you notice they are getting too brown, turn your heat down a little.

Drain and rinse well, then flake the cod into a bowl with your hands, removing any little bits of skin and bone.",
      "While the cod is cooking, pour 1-inch of water in a large pot fitted with a steamer insert. Add the potatoes and simmer on medium heat for 20 to 25 minutes until very tender.

Beat the mixture firmly with a wooden spoon so that it well combined and firm - a spoon should stand up in it. (If you find it too dry, add 1 or 2 tablespoons of milk.) Season with a pinch of pepper and taste for salt - you may not need to add any, as the cod itself retains enough saltiness, in spite of being soaked and boiled. With lightly moistened hands or using 2 tablespoons, shape the cod mixture into egg-shaped balls - you should get about 25. (The cod balls can be covered and refrigerated for up to 1 day before cooking or frozen in a container.)",
