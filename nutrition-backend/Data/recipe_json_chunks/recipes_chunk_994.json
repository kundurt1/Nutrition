A further test is to stick a skewer into the thickest part of the thigh; if the juices run clear the chicken is done. The interior temperature of the thickest part of the thigh should register 190\u00b0F (88 C). Transfer to a heated platter and let stand 10 minutes, to allow the juices to be absorbed back into the flesh.",

Add the drippings to the gooseberry sauce, heat through and stir in the cream. Taste. It might be necessary to add more honey, but the sauce should be tart to contrast with the crisp rich skin and juicy meat. Heat the sauce until it bubbles, pour it into a warmed sauceboat and serve over the carved chicken. Yields 6 generous servings."

You need to saute the mushrooms separately because each type has a different cooking time, but, once cooked, all the mushrooms should be mixed together in the bowl, along with the garlic and thyme. Set aside at room temperature until needed. (The mushrooms can be sauteed up to 2 hours ahead and kept covered with plastic wrap at room temperature).",

One at a time, peel the potatoes and slice them into 1/8-inch-thick rounds. The best way to get rounds this thin is to use a mandolin. Lacking that, use the thinnest slicing blade on the food processor or a sharp knife. Toss the potatoes into the cream as you slice them.",

Spread the mushrooms (minus what ever liquid they may have accumulated in the bowl) over the potatoes and pour in more cream, again using your hands to press down on the ingredients and bring the cream to the top.",

      "-Make Your Pie Dough-.",
      "Put the butter in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Beat on medium speed until creaming, then add the confectioners' sugar and beat on low until incorporated.",
      "In a separate bowl, combine the flour, ground almonds, salt, and spices and whisk to mix thoroughly. Add the flour mixture to the butter all at once, and mix on low. Mix only until the flour is just incorporated, because over-mixing could lead to tough crusts that shrink down in the oven. A little shrinking is fine, but too much and you'll have differently-sized pie layers, which could make stacking difficult.",
      "Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and let rest in the refrigerator for 20-30 minutes, then split the dough into quarters. Split each quarter into three for a total of 12 pieces of dough. Wrap each piece in plastic wrap and place back in the refrigerator.",
      "-Form & Bake Your Pie Shells-.",
      "Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F. Line two half-sheet pans with baking paper and place two (or if you can fit them comfortably, three) of your tart molds on each.",
      "Dust your counter surface with a light sprinkling of flour. Using a rolling pin, roll your first piece of dough into as round a shape as possible, with a thickness of about 1/8th of an inch. Carefully pick it up (I use a large flat spatula that I also use for moving delicate cake layers around) and rest the dough on the form, gently using your fingers to nudge and nestle it into place.",
      "Cut away the excess dough from the top of the form using a small, sharp paring knife.",
      "Continue until you've prepped all the tart forms on your two sheet pans. Place the sheets in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes to let the dough rest. Then prick the base of the dough all over with a fork to keep bubbles from misshaping the dough in the oven.",
      "Place a square of parchment paper over each tart and weigh down the dough with beans or baking beads. Bake for 10 minutes, then remove the parchment papers and weights and bake the shells for another 2-3 minutes until the tarts are a nice very light, toasty brown.",
      "Take the crusts out of the oven and allow to come to room temperature. Remove the baked shells from the molds and set aside, then repeat with your remaining dough until you have all twelve shells baked.",
      "Now you're ready to make your fillings!",
      "-Prep for All Fillings-.",
      "Divide the water into three small bowls, each with 1/4 cup cold water in it. Sprinkle 2 1/2 teaspoons gelatin over each and set aside to bloom.",
      "-Prep for the Cherry Filling-.",
      "Place your cherry jam in a small saucepan and heat until bubbling. Mix in one bowl of bloomed gelatin, stirring for 1-2 minutes until it melts completely. Place the jam in a small bowl and set in the refrigerator to cool.",
      "-Prep for the Pumpkin Filling-.",
      "Technically you don't have to cook canned pumpkin, but since we're adding some sugar it's best to heat it until it starts to bubble, add in the brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, and one bowl of gelatin, and cook down for about 5 minutes. Place in a medium bowl in the refrigerator to cool.",
      "-Prep for the Apple Filling-.",
      "Peel your apples, and then chop the flesh into small chunks. Add them to a saucepan with your sugar and cinnamon, and cook over medium for about 10-15 minutes, until the apples have released their water and start to fall apart in the pan. Squeeze in the lemon and add the last bowl of gelatin, and mix to combine. Place in a medium bowl in the refrigerator to cool.",
      "-Prepare the Cheesecake Base-.",
      "Place the cream cheese in the bowl of your stand mixer and beat on medium speed with the paddle attachment until smooth. Add the condensed milk and continue beating another 20 seconds or so, until the mixture is homogenous. Pour into a medium bowl and set aside.",
      "Pour your cold cream into the bowl of your stand mixer and fit it with the whisk attachment. Whip at medium-high speed until soft peaks form.",
      "-Finish the Fillings-.",
      "Make sure the fillings are at room temperature at the very warmest. If any have started to set up in the refrigerator, pop it in the microwave for a few seconds to loosen it without making it warm. Fold the cherry jam into 1/3 of the cheesecake base, the sweetened pumpkin into 1/3, and the apple compote into 1/3. Using a large spoon, dollop each filling into 4 tarts and use an offset spatula to smooth the filling out. You will have some of each filling left over!",
      "With your leftover filling, set each flavor aside in its own Tupperware or bowl covered in plastic wrap.",
      "-Layer the Pies-.",
      "Begin by placing a cake board or plate on a turntable, and spreading a dab of any type of filling in the middle to secure the base. Place one of your filled, set pies on top of the board, making sure it's centered.",
      "This next step is a little nerve-wracking the first time, but because of the sturdiness of this crust and the gelatin in the filling, these \"pie-scraper\" towers are actually surprisingly stable! To stack for ultimate stability, use an offset spatula to spread a little of whichever flavor of filling you're stacking on top of to add some fresh mousse to the top. Place the next pie layer directly on top of that fresh mousse, which will stick to the bottom. Make sure the layers are lined up as perfectly as possible before moving on to stack the next layer! When you reach the final layer, no need to add any more filling to it unless it really started to dip down as it.",
      "I stacked in the following order: pumpkin-apple-cherry-pumpkin-apple-cherry etc. However, you can and should stack however you like. You will have filling left over, but rejoice! It is super delicious served on its own as a yummy cheesecake mousse.",
      "Wrap the layered pie in plastic and put it in the refrigerator at least overnight, at most for 48 hours. It's okay if some of the pie layers crack a little on the sides overnight-as the filling sets, it contracts, which can cause the weight to shift and these fractures can appear. It's alright though, the structural integrity is sound as long as you slice and eat the layered pie within two days.",
      "-Make the Leaf Decorations-.",

If you don't want to use a natural vegetable rack you can use just of baking rack but I just love the flavor the vegetables give the gravy. I do not like to truss or tie my legs together. To me they get done more evenly when not tied.",
      "Time to bake -- Now I like to add 1 cup chicken broth or you can just use water in the bottom of the pan. It gives a little moisture along with the dripping from the chicken. Heat the oven to 450 degrees and cook the chicken uncovered for about 20 minutes. Reduce to 375 and cook for another 40-60 minutes depending on the size of your chicken. I always remove when the internal temperature reaches 170-175 and the juices will run clear when you stick a knife or fork in the thigh.",
      "Resting -- Make sure you remove from the pan to a plate and cover with foil. Let rest at least 15 minutes. Temperature will rise to 180 easily.",
      "Gravy -- First remove most of the grease from the drippings, just use a tablespoon, there shouldn't be too much. Then put the pan on the stove top and on medium heat, deglaze the pan with white wine about 1 cup and scrape up all the drippings. At this point, I still keep all the vegetables I used as the rack still in the pan. Then I add 2 cups of chicken broth and let it reduce 5 or so minutes as the chicken continues to rest.",
      "I finish by adding a teaspoon of butter and then thickening just a bit with corn starch mixed with just a little water (a slurry) just lightly, I don't want it too thick, and then strain the gravy. I then add a little parsley right at the end (optional). And drizzle over the cut up roasted chicken. It is perfection."
