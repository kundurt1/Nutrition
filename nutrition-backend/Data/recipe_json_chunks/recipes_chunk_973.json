The dough should be sticky to the touch, but not stick to you. And of course add more flour if the dough is not stiff enough. Mix until a cohesive ball forms.",
      "For those of you with hand mixers, good luck. Find those dough hooks and get to work. Mix dough until a cohesive ball forms. Turn over onto a floured surface and kneed into a ball if you must.",
      "Lastly if you have neither a hand mixer or stand mixer, but do have a wooden spoon. try mixing your dough adding half a cup to your mixture at a time.",
      "After your dough is mixed form a ball with it and place it in an olive-oiled (1 tsp) circular container such as a bowl for it to rise. Make sure that said container is at least twice as large as your dough ball will grow. Cover your container with foil or a plate or towel or t shirt or seran wrap. Let your dough rise until it doubles in size (45 minutes - 1 hour). If you have the time put your dough in the refidgerator over night as it will gain flavor and texture.",
      "When you're ready to prepare your pizza pre heat your oven to 450 F and flop your dough ball onto your floured counter and pat it slap it spread it into a shape that you like. Try kind of working on the dough circularly working around an axis and expanding from there. Consider the fact that your dough will expand in the oven and adjust the thickness accordingly. Use a rolling pin if you want to. I've used a wine bottle as a rolling pin to get the dough to spread out evenly.",
      "After sprinkling surface with cornmeal or flour, put your crust onto a pizza pan, cookie sheet, or (preheated) pizza stone and then take liberty to dress your pizza in sauce and cheese and all of your dreams.

      "Cook your pizza at 450 F for 12-15 minutes or until crust is golden brown.",
      "I like to brush the crust with melted butter and minced garlic when i take it out of the oven. After that i sprinkle parmesan all over the pizza.",
      "Go crazy with your pizza. Try substituting white flour with potato flour, semolina flour, hemp flour, rye flour, or wheat flour. Try substituting sugar with honey or malt instead of sugar. Try not using sugar at all! Try using beer instead of water. Get freaky with your toppings. Try halibut, potatoes, carrots, mangoes, or corn! Zucchini, squash, and sweet potatoes! Mix gorganzola with mozzarella and provolone with piccarino. Crack eggs on your pizza when it's half-cooked for a breakfast pizza!",

Cook the legs over medium heat until the temperature of the fat reaches 190 degrees Fahrenheit on a candy/ frying thermometer, then cover the pot and carefully move it into the oven. Bake at 200 degrees until the legs are fork-tender, about 3 hours.",

Using a fine-mesh strainer, strain the fat over the duck legs, leaving behind any debris or juices from the duck legs, which will have sunk to the bottom of the pot. Make sure that the legs are completely covered, and tap the containers lightly on the counter to help remove any air bubbles. Reserve any remaining clear strained duck fat and store in the refrigerator.",
      "Refrigerate the confit until the fat hardens fully. When the fat is hard, add another 1/2 inch layer of melted fat (which you saved from earlier, in the fridge. If you did not have enough to save, you could use fresh pork lard or peanut oil) to ensure that the legs are completely sealed in fat. Refrigerate the confit to allow the legs to \"mellow\" and develop flavor for at least a few days and up to 1 month before using.",
      "To use the confit, let the fat in the container soften at room temperature. Or set the container in a pan of warm water. Take out as many pieces as you plan to use. Cover the remaining pieces with more fat or peanut oil (the confit becomes more perishable once the seal is broken, so use the rest within a week or so). Scrape away the fat clinging to the confit and use as you like or as directed in a recipe. If you are using the confit on its own in a salad, heat it under a broiler until the skin is crispy.",
