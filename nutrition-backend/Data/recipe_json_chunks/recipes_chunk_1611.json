      "Start by adding the Parmesan cheese, rosemary, and thyme into the food processor. Blend until fully chopped.",

      "Knead the ingredients into the ground turkey until fully mixed. Roll the meat in your hands and shape into 1inch balls. Place the meatballs on a cutting board or parchment paper and set aside (yields approximately 21 meatballs).",
      "Heat a medium skillet with olive oil- enough to coat the bottom of the skillet.",
      "While heating your olive oil, bring the remaining 4 cups of turkey broth and 3 cups of water to a boil in a large stockpot. Add 1 tbsp. of pepper, 3 hearty pinches of salt (I used all 5 fingertips lol), 5 more sprigs of thyme, 2 more sprigs of rosemary, 1/4 a cup of Parsley and boil while you cook your meatballs. Allow the herbs to wilt. The sprigs will become duller in color. Stir periodically.",
      "Once the olive oil is hot, add 5-6 meatballs to the skillet and cover.",
      "**The oil will sizzle a bit, but should not pop. If it begins to pop uncontrollably, reduce your heat and continue cooking.",
      "Check the meatballs as you go. You want them to have a golden brown sear on each side. I let the meatballs cook on each side for approximately 45 seconds to 1 minute.",
      "**For every 6 meatballs in the skillet, it took roughly 7-8 minutes to cook completely through (turning on all sides). The timing is not a perfect science. Make sure to watch the meatballs as they cook and reduce your heat to medium/high halfway through. The oil will get extremely hot- making the meatballs cook faster.",
      "Once cooked through, put the meatballs on a paper towel covered plate. Continue cooking the meatballs- 6 at a time.",
      "**Let them rest. Do not cut into the balls for a few minutes so the juices can settle back into the meat.",
      "Using a slotted spoon, remove the rosemary and thyme from the stockpot before adding your remaining ingredients. Stir.",

      "Add 1.5 cups of butternut squash to your broth and stir well mixing all the ingredients together.",
      "Reduce the heat to medium and let the kale, squash, and orzo marry together. Simmer for 5 minutes.",

      "2. Cut the potatoes into eighths or smaller wedges, and spread out on the center of your two sheets of foil. Slice mushrooms and onions, and halve carrots lengthwise. Slice the uncooked corn on the cob into 3/4\" thick slices. Add all other vegetables to the potatoes.",
      "3. Fold up the sides of the foil, to create a \"boat\" for the vegetables to sit in, and add half a stick of butter to each pack. Salt lightly, and pepper liberally. Add half of the cheese to each pack as well, and fold the long sides of the foil together, rolling them tight down to the tops of the vegetables.",
      "4. Turn the packs to roll one end, making sure to keep the roll in the same direction as the first roll to prevent dripping butter into the grill. Pick up the pack, and bump on it's end to pack all the vegetables in tight, finishing up by folding the last side and rolling it up tight to the pack.",
      "5. Set the grill packs on the grill, but NOT directly over the hot coals on your grill, seam side UP. Cook for about 20-30 minutes, until the seams of the foil turn black with burned butter boiling out of them. Don't worry, the butter burns when it comes OUT, not on the inside of the grill pack. Keeping the packs OFF the coals will prevent everything from sticking to the foil.",
      "6. Remove from the grill and poke with a fork to release the steam inside, then open the foil by hand or with a knife.",
      "7. Serve in a large serving bowl, so everyone can pick what they want. Serves 4 easily, can serve up to 8 with 1/2 cup portions."
