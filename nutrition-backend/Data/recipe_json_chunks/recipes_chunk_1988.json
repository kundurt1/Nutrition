      "Put the extra virgin olive oil and garlic in a cold pot and heat over low heat.",
      "Gradually, you will see small bubbles coming up from the garlic and it'll start to smell nice.",
      "At the same time, prepare a cold wrung-out kitchen towel.",
      "Once the garlic starts changing color, scoop out the ones that have turned light brown with a mesh ladle.",
      "[Helpful Hints] The garlic aroma of the oil will differ depending on how dark the garlic has been browned.",
      "I normally brown garlic like the ones shown in this photo.",
      "However, once the garlic browned like in Step 4, they will get dark very quickly.",
      "So if you don't scoop them out from the oil promptly, they will get burnt and spoil the aroma.",
      "Until you get used to making this oil, it may be a good idea to scoop the garlic out when the color is little lighter than the photo in Step 4.",
      "When you've scooped out all the garlic, turn off the heat.",
      "Add the anchovy fillets and red chili peppers to the oil, then stir lightly.",
      "As soon as you finished stirring the oil, place the pan from Step 7 on the cold wrung out kitchen towel from Step 2.",
      "The anchovy oil is ready.",
      "Let it cool naturally.",
      "Once the anchovy oil has cooled completely, transfer to a sterilized jar to store.",
      "Transfer all the anchovy bits from the pan as well.",
      "The anchovy bits tend to sink to the bottom of the jar.",
      "Use only the oil, or use the oil with the other ingredients depending on the dish.",
      "Not only for pasta or ajillo, you can make a salad dressing by adding white wine vinegar, salt and pepper to this oil.",
      "It is so versatile!",
      "This is roasted asparagus with anchovy oil.",
      "I put asparagus in a heat resistant dish, added this anchovy oil, seasoned with salt and pepper, and roasted in the oven.",
      "Use the oil with the anchovy settled at the bottom and roast in the oven for 10 minutes at 250C.",
      "You can make a delicious dish like this very easily using the anchovy oil.",
      "This is a variation of this oil, \"Sundried Tomatoes Marinated in Oil\".",

      "These are both my favorites!",
      "\"Authentic Peperoncino With Anchovies\".",
      "It's very nice if you drizzle a little anchovy oil over this kind of oil-based pasta.",
      "[Note] The spiciness of the oil differs depending on when you add the red chili peppers to the oil.",
      "I add the red chili peppers between Step 2 and Step 3, but I think adding them in Step 7 is better for most people.",
      "The amount of anchovy fillets in this recipe suits various dishes.",
      "I tend to change up how I make the anchovy oil depending on what I'm making.",
      "Like adding an extra anchovy fillet, for example.",
      "I uploaded \"Very Useful Garlic Chips and Garlic Oil\".",
      "This oil is also very convenient, and I always have it stocked all year round."
