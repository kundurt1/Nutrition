      "Chicken -- Time to stir fry! This is quick so make sure you have the sauce nearby, the cashews and the rice is done. Heat that large pan up one more time. Now a wok is great if you have one, but not necessary. Add 1 tablespoon each peanut (or whatever you have) and sesame oil (don't leave out the sesame oil (it gives this dish great flavor) and bring to medium/high heat - high heat. Scoop the chicken out of the marinade, but use a slotted spoon, you don't want to get extra marinade in the pan. You can also strain it in a colander if you want. A slotted spoon works great and much easier. Add it to the hot oil and stir fry on each side until golden brown. It won't take more than 4-5 min tops. They cook very quick and you don't want to over cook them.",
      "Right before they are done, add in the scallions, red pepper strips and cashews. Stir to combine and then add in the sauce. Cook just a minute or two until the sauce is bubbly and thick. The pepper will still be a bit crunchy but tender and the chicken will be tender and done.",
      "NOTE: If you like the sauce a bit thicker, mix 1 teaspoon cold water with 1 teaspoon corn starch and add to the dish. And cook just a minute -- this will thicken it up quickly.",
      "Serve -- Just top this wonderful chicken and sauce over the water chestnut rice. As I mentioned, I love a Napa cabbage salad with carrots and a sesame dressing for a side, but add your favorites. This really may look like a lot, but they are all simple steps. Just follow the steps for a quick nice dinner. ENJOY!",
      "Note: Time to make includes marinating."

Sprinkle a bit more flour on the top of that ball and with the entire length of the sides of your thumbs, gently stretch the top surface around to the under part of the ball. Gently! You're not actually tearing the dough, but think of it as lengthening the fibers on the very top surface of the ball by stretching it just a bit. Then go ahead and roll out the dough for your pizza.",

      "Bread Crumbs -- In a small pie plate or bowl, soak the bread slices in the milk for just 10-20 seconds and then squeeze out the liquid. Break up the bread in the bowl to add to the meatloaf mix. Stir well to combine.",
      "Chicken -- Add the ground chicken to the bowl and mix to combine once again. Don't over mix, it can become tough. It's done.",
      "Loafs -- First is to divide your meatloaf mix into 4 portions, for 4 loafs. Then layout a piece of wax paper or parchment paper and spray with non-stick spray (it will keep the meat from sticking), and then top it with enough mix for 1 of the loafs. Press down flat (like a small rectangle), it doesn't have to be perfect. Just not too thin because you are going to add the stuffing and then roll it.",
      "Once the meat it flat, spread 1/4 cup of the mustard/honey sauce on top of the meat. Make sure to leave a 1/2\" border around the edges. Then top with 1/4 cup swiss cheese, followed by 1 ham slice, 1/3 cup of the parmesan, and 1/4 cup more swiss cheese. Stuffing is done.",
      "Form the Loaf -- Just roll up. I start at one of the long sides, and roll (just like rolling a buritto or sandwich roll). Once it is rolled, squeeze the ends together, so nothing leaks out, and slightly squeeze the whole roll so it is tightly sealed and form like a small loaf.",
      "Topping -- Place all the loafs on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, or you could use foil. Both work great for easy clean up. Brush each loaf, the top and sides with 1/8 cup mustard sauce per each loaf. Top with the bacon slices, going horizontally across the loaf (not lengthwise). Four slices should fit nicely going across the top, and make sure the bacon hangs over the sides going down to the bottom, this will give it great flavor. Done.",
      "Bake -- 375 degree oven, middle shelf for about 45 minutes until golden brown and the bacon is crispy.",
      "Serve -- As I said, I love to put them on a big serving tray because they are so pretty, The bacon forms natural slices, so I cut 1 or 2 slices off of a couple of loafs as needed to show off the pretty rolled filling.",
      "Some mashed \"spuds,\" or just a good baked potato, and some roasted asparagus in a foil pouch so NO extra pots or pans. ENJOY!"

      "FOR THE BEANS AND SAUCE: Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 425 degrees. Fill large bowl with ice water. Bring 4 quarts water to boil in large Dutch oven. Add 2 tablespoons salt and beans. Cook beans until bright green and crisp-tender, about 6 minutes. Drain beans in colander and plunge immediately into ice water to stop cooking. Spread beans on paper-towel-lined baking sheet to drain.",
      "Add butter to now-empty Dutch oven and melt over medium-high heat until foaming subsides. Add mushrooms, garlic, 3/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/8 teaspoon pepper; cook until mushrooms release moisture and liquid evaporates, about 6 minutes. Add flour and cook for 1 minute, stirring constantly. Stir in broth and bring to simmer, stirring constantly. Add cream, reduce heat to medium, and simmer until sauce is thickened and reduced to 3 1/2 cups, about 12 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste.",
      "Add green beans to sauce and stir until evenly coated. Arrange in even layer in 3-quart (or 13 by 9-inch) baking dish. Sprinkle with topping and bake until top is golden brown and sauce is bubbling around edges, about 15 minutes. Serve immediately.",

      "The components of the casserole can be prepared ahead of time. Store the bread-crumb topping in an airtight container in the refrigerator and combine with the onions just before cooking. Combine the beans and cooled sauce in a baking dish, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for up to 24 hours. To serve, remove the plastic wrap and heat the casserole in a 425-degree oven for 10 minutes, then add the topping and bake as directed. This recipe can be halved and baked in a 2-quart (or 8-inch-square) baking dish. If making a half batch, reduce the cooking time of the sauce in step 3 to about 6 minutes (1 3/4 cups) and the baking time in step 4 to 10 minutes."

Add 1 Tbl vinegar; use apple cider if its on hand) to egg yolk, stir both into crumbs. Add ice water 1 Tbl/ time until dough is firm.",

I cooked it per the recipe, except I doubled the recipe and used a package of six leg quarters. I separated the legs and thighs and had to use two pans. (Quite reasonable at $.69/lb.) The coating was as if it was fried and had a beautiful golden/brownish color. My octogenarian family raved about it as soon as it hit the table. My wife made excellent gravy.The kid's are good with gravy only out of a jar. The flavor was great! This is now my new staple.",

      "DAY 1.",
      "Roll whole beef round on all sides in Worcestershire sauce until it's brown. Roll in garlic powder until it's white. Roll in basil until it's green. Sprinkle lightly with red pepper flakes.",
      "Put in baking pan without rack and bake in oven at 250 dg. for 20 minutes per lb. (Roast will be extremely rare, but don't worry because it will be tender and juicy after recipe is completed) Do not remove roast from pan or drain off drippings. Wrap it all in foil and chill in refrigerator overnight to firm up for easy slicing and to meld seasonings.",
      "DAY 2.",
      "Remove from pan and save all drippings including any browned bits from baking pan. Refrigerate until needed.",
      "Slice chilled roast as close to paper thin as possible (I bring it to butcher where purchased and he slices it for me on his electric slicer.) Put beef slices (saving any juice that dripped off) in plastic bags and chill until ready to assemble.",
      "Add 1 1/2 cups of water per lb. of beef in saucepan, adding drippings that had been saved earlier. Stir over low heat to make an au jus. If more flavor is needed, add more of the above spices and beef bouillon cubes until flavor seems right. The last few years I've used au jus gravy envelope(s) to speed things up or to stretch out more sauce, adjusting seasonings above to keep the \"Italian\" flavor If wanted, at this point you can add a bit of garlic powder, oregano, or pepper to taste.",
      "Bring au jus mixture to a boil.",
      "TO SERVE:",
      "Immediately pour boiling au jus to cover beef slices in a roaster, electric frypan, or large crockpot that will keep sandwiches warm but not hot. DO NOT heat up beef first! The boiling jus will warm up the beef and finish the cooking process. If beef is actually cooked in sauce it will get tough.",
      "Serve immediately by having guests prepare their own sandwiches on small french sandwich loaves or hoagie buns. If Gonella- brand rolls are available, that was the bread of choice for Sid the stand man.",
      "Serve with green pepper slices that have been sauteed to soften as well as with yellow pepperoncini peppers for those who want more of a kick!",
      "NOTE: Sid also made Stromboli Sandwiches, which are a French roll stuffed with Italian beef, a link of cooked hot Italian sausage.",
      "and mozzarella cheese. He wrapped the sandwiches in foil and heated in oven until the cheese was melted, then poured a drizzle of warm marinara sauce on filling and added a few sauteed green pepper slices (or pepperoncini peppers). I make these with frozen leftover Italian beef after the party by making broiled garlic bread rolls and assembling them as Sid did."
