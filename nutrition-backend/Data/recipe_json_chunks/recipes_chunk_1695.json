      "(For more information see Releasing Pressure below.)",
      "11.",
      "Pressure is completely reduced when the air vent, pressure indicator or possibly cover lock has dropped.",
      "Don't try to force the lid open before the pressure drops.",
      "12.",
      "Remove the pressure regulator, remove pressure cooker cover and serve food.",
      "SAFETY INFORMATION",
      "It's true, the newer pressure cookers have a lot more safety features than the older designs of our mother's and grandmother's time.",
      "A lot of people were scared away from pressure cooking because of childhood memories or possibly stories from relatives about kitchen explosions.",
      "In the years just before and shortly after WW II pressure cookers were very popular and in widespread use, and a few of those 60 year old diehards are still in use.",
      "Old pressure cookers were not manufactured the same as today's new generation cookers, and they lacked any safety features and which's where the tales from urban legends come from.",
      "Read and understand your owners manual, as you become more familiar with pressure cooking experience will be your best teacher.",
      "Always do a visual inspection before cooking to be sure the lid is clean and in proper working order.",
      "To test your pressure cooker take it for a test drive before using it.",
      "If the only reason you bought a pressure cooker was to make chicken like KFC, read the warnings and see if it's worth the risks.",
      "PRESSURE SETTINGS",
      "Most pressure cooker recipes are made to cook at a standard of 15psi.",
      "This setting is the standard as determined by the USDA way back in 1917, and till the arrival of the new and improved 2nd generation pressure cooker with multiple pressure settings, all pressure cookers had just which one 15psi setting.",
      "Which pressure setting still remains as the standard today.",
      "Many pressure cookers will provide only one pressure setting, this is especially true of older pressure cookers with the jiggle top regulator weights.",
      "Generally this single pressure setting is HIGH or possibly 15psi, that is just fine because the majority of recipes call for cooking at which setting.",
      "Almost all recipes designed for the pressure cooker are made to be cooked at 15psi for a specific time, in fact this setting is so common which most recipes do not even need to mention it.",
      "If no pressure setting is stated cook at high, or possibly 15psi pressure for the stated time.",
      "If a recipe calls for a lower pressure setting, which will be stated in the recipes.",
      "Recipes which are designed for the new cookers may have recipes which require LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH pressure, or possibly on the first or possibly second red ring, that corresponds to the medium and high pressure settings.",
      "Some pressure cookers may have more rings and a wider range of pressure setting, others come with a selection switch and canners have a pressure gauge.",
      "Some pressure cookers offer variations of the original 'jiggle-top' weights and use a stationary weight which doesn't rock, it just hisses, others have a dual or possibly triple weighted pressure regulator allowing you to set different pressure.",
      "REALEASING PRESSURE",
      "o Cool Water Release Method: (Fastest method, used to immediately stop the cooking process by lowering the heat AND the temperature.)",
      "If a quicker release of pressure is desired, the pot is carried to the sink and cool water run over the lid (but not the valve).",
      "This method is mainly used for food with very short cooking times where it is essential to stop the cooking process as fast as possible.",
      "For example risotto, polenta, or possibly fresh vegetables where you not only want to reduce the pressure AND stop all cooking so which veggies are still tender-crisp.",
      "If you plan on returning the P/C to the stove it will take longer to come back to pressure.",
      "o Quick or possibly Touch Release Method: (Quick, but not as fast as the cool water release, this vents the pressure but does not lower the heat of the food.)",
      "People often confuse the quick release with the cool water release.",
      "The valve on some new pressure cookers releases the pressure quickly with just the push of a button.",
      "This method is suggested if you wish to interrupt the cooking process in order to add in some further ingredients or possibly check food for doneness.",
      "By releasing the steam this way you can quickly open the pressure cooker without cooling off the pot and stopping the cooking process.",
      "Don't use this method for food which foams and is cooked on the first red ring!",
      "o Natural Release Method: (Slowest method to gradually drop the pressure and the temperature to finish the cooking process.)",
      "A third method of releasing the pressure is to remove the pressure cooker from the heat source and to allow the pressure to subside naturally.",
      "If you are cooking beans, potatoes, or possibly other foods that have a skin which you wish to remain intact, this is the preferred method.",
      "Many meats and other longer cooking recipes are finished this way.",
      "ACCESSORIES AND STORAGE",
      "One of the most important accessories you will need is a timer.",
      "A couple of extra min of cooking probably will not harm a pot roast, but it could ruin a more delicate dish or possibly any accompanying veggies.",
      "A rack or possibly trivot is a common requirement and often comes with the cooker.",
      "A steamer basket to keep foods above the liquid is also desirable for cooking some vegetables.",
      "For cooking desserts, you will need a 5-c. heatproof souffle dish (which fits in side your pressure cooker); 1/2-c. heatproof ramekins for puddings, custards and timbales; and a 7- or possibly 8-inch springform pan (to fit in your cooker) for cheesecakes.",
      "You should also have a heat-diffuser, that prevents direct contact between the heat source and the bottom of the cooker.",
      "It will be needed when preparing rice, pasta or possibly bean dishes to prevent sticking and scorching.",
      "When storing your pressure cooker, be sure to store it with the lid completely detached and to the side of the pot.",
      "If you store it closed, you will trap smells and odors inside the pot to greet you on your next usage.",
      "Thoroughly wash the rubber seal and rub it with mineral oil after each use to preserve it.",
      "The rubber seal should last through about 150 meals.",
      "Store the valve and rubber seal (if not attached) inside the cooker.",
      "GETTING THE MOST OUT OF YOUR COOKER",
      "Usage: Pressure cookers adapt best to recipes which normally use a moist cooking method such as soups, stews, tough cuts of meats, artichokes, steamed puddings, etc.",
      "Add in vegetables at the very end to avoid a mushy result.",
      "Generally, cooks in high altitudes over 3,500 feet should increase cooking times by about ten percent.",
      "Liquid is an important part of pressure-cooking.",
      "The amount of liquid necessary will vary depending on the manufacturer.",
      "Some will require as little as one-half c. of liquid and others up to two c..",
      "Tips and Hints: Pressure-cooking is really fairly simple, but here are a few important tips to remember.",
      "o Most importantly, be familiar with the owner's manual for your particular cooker.",
      "Read it thoroughly and follow all manufacturer's recommendations.",
      "o You can use more liquid than recommended, but never use less.",
      "o Read and understand the recipe before you begin.",
      "o Be sure the lid is properly closed and locked into position before developing pressure.",
      "o Use which timer!",
      "Timing is as important as developing pressure.",
      "o Once you have reduced pressure according to directions, shake the pot before opening the seal to readjust the inner temperature.",
      "o Cut same foods into pcs of uniform size to promote even cooking.",
      "When mixing foods, cut those which cook more quickly into larger pcs and those which cook more slowly into smaller pcs.",
      "o If your recipe calls for browning or possibly searing as a preliminary step, be sure to scrape up the brown bits clinging to the bottom so they are loose when you add in the liquid.",
      "This will discourage scorching.",
      "o Since flavors are more concentrated with this cooking method, you may want to reduce herbs and seasonings when converting conventional recipes.",
      "Choose fresh herbs over dry herbs.",
      "o If you end up with too much liquid, simply cook in the uncovered pot till the liquids are reduced to your satisfaction.",
      "o If you desire the flavors of foods to mix, let them come into contact with the liquid that transmits flavors.",
      "If you don't wish flavors to mix, place individual foods on a rack above the liquid.",
      "Steam does not transmit or possibly mix flavors.",
      "o When cooking dry beans, cereal grains, lentils, split peas, rice or possibly other foods which"

      "NOTES: White Lily flour is de rigueur for biscuit making in the South - it is made from soft red winter wheat, which is a variety of wheat that has a low protein content and low gluten content, which makes for a flaky, more tender crumb.",
      "If you can't get White Lily flour you can use a mix of Swan's Down Cake Flour and all purpose flour - 1 cup of each.",
      "Swan's Down Cake Flour is also made with soft winter wheat.",
      "If you can't find either of these, you can use regular all-purpose flour, but the biscuits won't be as light because of the higher protein and gluten content of all-purpose flour.",
      "If you really want to make these right, you should use lard instead of Crisco.",
      "Lard has a different chemical reaction with the flour than Crisco, and gives you a more flaky biscuit.",
      "Lard freaks a lot of people out, but it actually has less saturated fat than butter, and less cholesterol.",
      "The old Crisco was full of trans fats; the new Crisco is trans-fat free.",
      "PLEASE NOTE: when I say \"lard\", I mean rendered leaf lard, NOT the bricks of lard you find on grocery store shelves, which are hydrogenated and contain BHA and BHT.",
      "You need to find a reputable butcher, and ask him for some rendered leaf lard.",
      "If you cannot find any rendered leaf lard, you can use Crisco or butter, but be aware that butter has much more water content than lard or Crisco and will result in a less flaky biscuit.",
      "When you cut the lard and the butter into the flour, you want them to be very cold.",
      "If you like, you can put them in the freezer for about 30 minutes before cutting them into the dough, so they can really firm up.",
      "Also, the key to light biscuits is minimal handling of the dough.",
      "After you cut the shortening into the flour, gently mix in the buttermilk, just until the liquid is incorporated and the dough comes together.",
      "Do not over mix.",
      "Other enemies of light biscuits include kneading dough and rolling dough - do not roll the dough out; place the dough on a floured surface, and gently pat it out until it is 1/2\" thick, then cut the biscuits out.",
      "I like to use square biscuit cutters, they minimize scraps, which then have to be gathered together and re-cut - when you have to do this, the resulting biscuits will be heavier and won't rise as high.",
      "Lastly, make sure your baking powder and baking soda are fresh (less than 6 months old).",
      "This applies to all baking.",
      "Old baking powder and baking soda will not leaven properly, and the biscuits will not rise.",
      "If you don't know how long you've had your baking powder or baking soda, throw them out and buy new supplies.",
      "Preheat oven to 425 degrees.",
      "Sift together flour, baking powder, baking soda, sugar & salt.",
      "Cut in the butter and lard with a pastry blade until all the bits of shortening are pea - sized and well combined with the flour.",
      "You can also use a food processor, fitted with the pastry blade, to do this.",
      "If you have used a food processor to cut the shortening into the flour, pour the mixture into a bowl before adding the buttermilk.",
      "Gently stir in the buttermilk - start with just 3/4 of a cup.",
      "Using a fork, stir the buttermilk into the flour mixture, just till the dough holds together and is still sticky.",
      "If there is still a lot of flour which has not been incorporated into the dough, add some of the remaining 1/4 cup of buttermilk.",
      "Biscuit dough should be fairly wet and sticky - chilling the dough for 15 minutes before patting it out will help it to become more easy to handle.",
      "Resist the urge to add more flour!",
      "This will make the biscuits heavy and tough.",
      "On a floured surface, pat out the dough and fold it over on itself.",
      "Pat it out again and fold it over on itself again.",
      "Pat out one more time to 1/2\" thick and cut with a 2\" biscuit cutter.",
