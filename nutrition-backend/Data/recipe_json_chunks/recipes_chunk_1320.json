      "Place fennel, spices, sugar, vinegar, and water into a small saucepot and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Meanwhile, as your saucepot is heating, zest the navel orange. It should yield about 1 teaspoon, but if you get less, that is fine. Set zest aside. Peel the orange as if you were supreming or segmenting it, but instead of segmenting, cut the orange into 4 pieces and remove the middle pithy part, seeds, and hard rind (if any). The membrane between the orange segments is fine. Dice what you have, which should yield about 1 cup. Add to the saucepot, which should have come up to a rapid simmer/boil about now. If the pot started boiling while you were cutting up the orange, that is fine. Once the oranges are in, bring to a boil for about 5 minutes, skimming any foam that appears, then turn down to medium. Simmer until liquid is reduced to the consistency of maple syrup (nearly all of the liquid will be gone by then) and the mustard seeds have plumped up and softened, about 20-25 minutes. Set aside and cool, then stir in reserved orange zest. Note: At this point, there will still be pieces of fresh orange in the mostarda. If you want a more cooked-down, marmalade-ish consistency, bring the orange to a boil with the fennel, and simmer on medium-low heat for 30 minute"

Roast or BBQ as usual. Amazing results. Your meat will be both tender and delicious not gamey while preserving the high flavour. Enjoy."

      "Get yourself a large bowl and place the ground beef, garlic powder, rice, green onions thinly sliced, cilantro finely chopped and your three eggs. Mix well with your hands. After well mixed you want to get another bowl or plates to place your finished meatballs. Just before finishing your meatballs get a large pot and place your two and 3/4 quarts of water and boil on high. When your meatballs are done gently drop the meatballs into the pot with boiling water. Once you've dropped all your meatballs get 2 large scoops of beef bullion and place it in the water. I but the leanest ground beef so you don't get alot of fat. After putting your 2 scoops of beef bullion and six cubes of cilantro dried cubes. You'll probably find the cilantro dried cubes in your local store or where there's a Hispanic store. Cover your meat balls and let your meatballs cook over medium high for about 30 minutes. Place carrots sliced, I use baby carrots because it saves me alot of time and cutting. Place the carrots into the pot and stir. If your adding corn you can add your cuttlets of corn into the pot the same time you add your carrots. Get your potatoes and quarter them and about ten minutes after the corn and carrots are placed in the pot you can add your quartered potatoes. Mix and taste a teaspof your soup and see if it needs anymore seasoning according to your taste. While waiting for about 20 minutes more slice your zuchhini and add them to the pot. Once you see your zuchhini done you'll be ready to eat!",

While potatoes are roasting in a small pan add your 2 tbsp olive oil and thinly sliced cippolini. Turn heat to medium and begin to caramelize your onions, stirring every 3 minutes or so (as you don't want onions to burn, lower heat if necessary). This can take anywhere from 30-45 minutes. Once onions have reached desired caramelization remove from heat and set aside. 6. Assemble potato pizza with onions, goat cheese crumbles & romano cheese. 7.

If you'd like, give the turkey a quick rinse under cool water. Dry the turkey thoroughly then let it sit for an hour or so at room temperature before roasting according to your favorite recipe."

Add raisins and stir until well incorporated. Use teaspoons (or dinner spoons) to drop teaspoon size batter onto sprayed cookie sheet. Mash cookies down with the back of a serving spoon (sprayed lightly with cooking spray so it won't stick). I formed mine a little when I mashed them down so they would be somewhat round (not perfect of course). Cook for 6-9 minutes at 350 degrees until golden brown. I'm planning on freezing some of these for later use. They are WONDERFUL and easy to make!!! Bonus - you only dirty one bowl while making these :)"

      "Line the bottom and sides of a 9-inch or 8-inch square baking pan with parchment paper or aluminum foil, smoothing out any wrinkles. Set aside. There are two ways you can melt the chocolate. You may use a double boiler over just barely simmering water or you may use the microwave. The double boiler is easier, but the microwave is a little more convenient for most people, so my directions are for a microwave. If you have a double boiler, you probably know how to use it! And you can use it for this chocolate melting. So, the KEY to melting chocolate in the microwave is to do it in small bursts and stir frequently. Chocolate seizes so fast, so easily. Melt 1/2 teaspoon of oil with 6 ounces of the white chocolate in a small glass bowl. I recommend a glass bowl because you can see if there is any seizing on the sides. Melt in 15 second increments, stirring vigorously with a rubber spatula after each increment, until completely melted and smooth. Make sure you scrape down the sides of the bowl with the spatula to avoid scorching. Once melted, stir in 1/4 teaspoon peppermint extract. Pour melted white chocolate into the prepared baking pan, spreading with an offset spatula into a thin smooth layer. Place the baking pan in the refrigerator for 20 minutes or the freezer for 15 minutes; or until completely set-- this could take longer than 20 minutes. Place the semi-sweet chocolate and 1/2 teaspoon of oil into a smaller glass bowl (or the double boiler if using that). Melt in 15 second increments, stirring vigorously with a rubber spatula after each increment, until completely melted and smooth. Make sure you scrape down the sides of the bowl with the spatula to avoid scorching. Once melted, stir in remaining 1/4 teaspoon peppermint extract. Pour all of the semi-sweet chocolate over the hardened white chocolate layer. Spread into a smooth layer. Place the baking pan back in the refrigerator for 20 minutes or the freezer for 15 minutes; or until completely set-- this could"

    "title": "deep dish pizza",
    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "FOR DOUGH",
      "1. In a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, combine 1/2 cup of the warm water, 1/2 teaspoon of the sugar, and the yeast and stir to just combine. Let stand for 3 to 5 minutes, until it bubbles and foams.",
      "2. Add the butter to the dough, about 1 tablespoon at a time, mixing for about 20 to 30 seconds after each addition for a total of 2 to 3 minutes, or until the butter is incorporated; scrape down the sides and bottom of the mixer bowl and the dough hook before the last addition. You will have a soft, tacky, not-sticky, loose dough (avoid kneading heavily in order to maintain the light texture that defines most Chicago-style crusts). Transfer to a large mixing bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and a kitchen towel and refrigerate overnight. (Note: You can let this dough rise at room temperature in the kitchen for about 2 hours or until it has expanded to about 1 1/2 times its size, but the taste, texture, and ease of handling are far better when it has a slow, chilly overnight rise.)",
      "SAUCE",
      "1. Heat the oil in a large saucepan set over medium-high until it shimmers. Add the onions and cook, stirring occasionally, for 7 to 8 minutes, or until lightly browned. Add the garlic, stir, and cook for 30 seconds. Turn off the heat. Add the basil, oregano, thyme, rosemary, sugar, salt, white pepper, hot pepper flakes, and tomatoes. Stir and let stand while you put the pizza together.",
      "MAKING SUASAGE TOPPING",
      "1. Heat the oil and butter in a saucepan set over medium-high until the butter foams and is fully melted. Add the onions and stir well. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 4 to 5 minutes, until the onions are translucent with browned edges. Add the sausage and cook, stirring with a sturdy, heat-resistant spatula to break it up. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes, add the mushrooms, and stir well. Reduce the heat to medium and cook for 10 to 12 minutes, until the mushrooms have softened and released their liquid. Remove from the heat and set aside while you make the sauce.",
      "MAKE THE PIZZA",
      "1. When you are ready to assemble the pizza, preheat the oven to 425\u00b0F.",
      "2. Flatten the dough with water-moistened fingertips, and gently stretch to about 16 inches. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and allow to rest for 10 minutes. Using a pastry brush, liberally spread the canola or vegetable oil around the bottom and sides of a 12- to 14-inch cast-iron skillet. Fit the dough into the skillet, tucking it in and pressing it up the edges of the pan to the very top. It should be about 1/2- to 3/4-inch thick (don't go crazy rolling or yanking, and don't fold it; remember, if you handle it too roughly, you will lose its lovely tenderness).",
      "3. Slice the mozzarella into 1/8-inch slices, patting each slice well with a paper towel.",
      "4. Completely cover the bottom of the crust with the mozzarella, making more than one layer if necessary to use all the cheese.",
      "5. Spoon the sausage and mushroom mixture evenly over the mozzarella and then scatter the ricotta salata and romano cheeses evenly over the surface. Spoon the sauce over it, spreading it evenly. Bake for 30 to 35 minutes, until heated through and the cheese is completely melted. (The dough should register at least 200\u00b0F on an instant-read thermometer, but be careful to insert it into the dough, not the filling, to get an accurate reading.) Let the pizza cool for 10 minutes, cut it into wedges, and serve (when you cut it, the liquids of the fillings and sauce will moisten the bottom of the dough). If you wish, pass additional fresh basil and hot pepper flakes at the table.",
      "NOTES: Yeast is a little living creature, and it needs special handling. You need warm water to activate it - between 85\u00b0F and 100\u00b0F - but if the water is too warm, you'll kill it and it simply won't work at all.",
      "Ricotta salata is ricotta cheese that has been salted, pressed, and dried. It has a pleasantly salty, nutty flavor"

Use a fork to hold them. Chill them until cold and when cold slice them. chop onion very fine and put them to potatoe slices. Add vinegar and oil, salt and pepper and beef bouillon and mix with big spoon carefully so that potatoe slices won't be mashed too much. Then add mayo, mix under. Chop bacon I prefer a very good smoked one, big slices or one piece if available, cut it into small quarters, put in pan and fry until almost crisp. Seperate the greece, (I keep greece and use it to cook roasts, chops, schnitzel or other meet instead of oil) Add the bacon bits to the salad, stir again and let rest in fridge until serving. Before serving stir and taste, you might need to add some salt and beef bouillon"
