Stir in cheese all at once, and continue stirring until melted, about 30 to 60 seconds. Pour cheese over the potatoes, and cover the dish with aluminum foil.",

      "My Note: Which I'm sure many people are already aware of, is to spray the foil with a bit of cooking spray before putting it on the dish to keep the potatoes and cheese from sticking to it. Finally, we like our potatoes to be golden brown on top, therefore I removed the foil for the last 15 - 20 minutes of cooking time.",
      "12/26 02: I just made this as a side dish to my Christmas ham. I doubled the recipe -- used a lot more pepper than expected -- used Cracker Barrel's Vermont extra sharp white cheddar -- sauteed the onions with some garlic and butter before adding to layers -- and slow cooked in crock pot (oven was full of ham). WOW! This recipe rocked. I loved that it was so user friendly and easy to cook in the crock pot. It is a must have to choose side dishes that can cook in a crock at the holidays.",
      "Update 2/8/05: I do differently that I think makes it better. 1. No onions. (I think they just get in the way of the potato and cheese flavor) 2. Make extra cheese sauce (I think an extra half recipe of sauce will do it) 3. Put extra cheese in the sauce. (at least an extra half cup, but to your taste) 4. Layer cheese sauce between layers of potatoes. (make sure to grease the pan well or it's hard to get off after baked) 5. Sprinkle bread crumbs on top for extra crispiness. I made two huge pans of this for a party with 30+ people and it all went. Definitely a favorite of mine.",
      "I usually make mine by just adding shredded cheese, onion, flour and milk and bake which is delicious but these beat it! Also a great tip, this is the same cheese sauce my family uses for homemade mac n cheese, if you use this recipe and pour it over cooked elbow macaroni and add extra shredded cheese on top then bake just a bit to melt, it's the best mac n cheese you've ever had! You could make a double batch and have the mac the next night with baked chicken.",
      "Modified slightly by sauteeing onions 1st w/a bit of fresh/minced garlic for 4 min to reduce \"raw\" onion taste B4 adding to layers. Also agree to remove cover 15 min B4 serving to get a little crust or add a little buttered breadcrumbs to get a light topping. Convert this side dish recipe to a \"one meal\" casserole by adding left over chunks of ham (from a previous meal). This casserole is then yummy as brunch, lunch or supper.",
      "To me This one was ok but not great using low fat cheese. For some reason the cheese burned on the bottom. I baked it in a glass dish. If I had used full fat cheese I'm sure it would've been fabulous. I save this recipe for special occasions and use the right cheese."

Cover with another piece of plastic or wax paper, then roll the dough into a circle just a little larger than 8 inches in diameter. As you're rolling, turn the dough over and lift the plastic or paper frequently, so that you don't roll it into the dough and form creases. Repeat with the other half of the dough.",

If it breaks, just press the pieces together. If there's a little extra dough running up the sides of the pan, you can either fold it over the bottom layer or cut it so that it's even. Spoon some of the jam or pastry cream onto the dough, starting in the center of the cake and leaving one inch of dough bare around the border. Add more filling if you don't think it will squish out the sides when you press down on it with the top layer of dough. (I find that 3/4 cup is usually just the right amount, but if you're using a very thick jam, you might want a bit more.).",
      "Moisten the bare ring of dough with a little water and then top with the second piece of dough, pressing down around the edges to seal it. If you'd like, you can work your finger between the top dough and the edge of the pan, so that you tuck the dough under a little. Because of the softness of the dough and the baking powder, even if you only press the layers together very lightly, they'll fuse as they bake. And, no matter how well you press them together, it seems inevitable that a little of the filling will escape.",

Transfer the cake to a cooling rack and let it rest for 5 minutes before carefully running a blunt knife around the edges of the cake.

Stop the machine and scrape down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula. Increase the mixer speed to medium and beat for 2 minutes more, scraping the sides down again if needed. The strawberries should be well blended into the batter. Fold in the coconut and pecans. Divide the batter among the prepared pans and place them in the oven; if your oven is not large enough, place two pans on the center rack and place the third pan in the center of the highest rack.",

Run a dinner knife around the edge of each layer and invert each onto a rack, then invert again onto another rack so that the cakes are right side up. Allow them to cool completely, 30 minutes more.",

Then raise the speed to medium and mix the frosting another minute or until the frosting lightens and is well combined. Fold in the coconut and pecans.",

Repeat this process with the third layer and frost the top. Use the remaining frosting to frost the sides, working with clean, smooth strokes. Serve at once or chill the cake for later serving.",
      "Place this cake uncovered, in the refrigerator until the frosting sets, 20 minutes. Cover the cake with waxed paper and store, in the refrigerator, for up to 1 week. Or freeze it, wrapped in aluminum foil, for up to 6 months. Thaw the cake overnight in the refrigerator before serving."

When rice is tender, taste and add salt and pepper to taste--keep in mind you will add feta later which will add some saltiness. Remove from heat and stir in dill and zest.",

Allow to cool to roughly room temperature Add 2 beaten eggs and heavy cream. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour.",

Lightly cover the sheets with plastic wrap and set in a warm place until almost doubled, 60 to 90 minutes.",
      "Line a rimmed baking sheet with a few layers of paper towels. Add the oil to a medium, heavy-bottomed pot. Attach a candy thermometer to the side of the pot and heat the oil to 350\u00b0F. Carefully add 2 to 3 doughnuts to the oil and fry them until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the doughnuts to the paper towels. Repeat with the remaining dough.",
      "Toss the warm doughnuts in the powdered sugar. Use a chopstick to poke a hole into one side of each doughnut. Twist the chopstick around to make some room in the center of the doughnut. Be careful not to poke through the other side. Transfer the jam to a pastry bag fitted with a small round tip. For each doughnut, insert the tip of the pastry bag into the hole and gently squeeze to fill.",
      "Alternatively, instead of powdered sugar, make a glaze by whisking the powdered sugar together with the cream and some food coloring. Top each filled doughnut with some glaze and top with sprinkles. Let the glazed doughnuts stand at room temperature for a few minutes to set."

    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "Begin by culturing your cream (this is an overnight process, so plan accordingly). In a clean glass or ceramic container (bowl, jar, etc) combine the cream and yogurt, creme fraiche or buttermilk. Cover loosely and place it in a warmish part of the house - the ideal temperature is around 75F (23C), but anywhere in the range from 70-80F (20-26C) is okay.",
      "After 12-18 hours, the cream should be noticeably thicker and should taste slightly tangy, i.e. like creme fraiche. If it's bubbling and gassy, some unwanted bacteria have gotten in there so discard your cream and start again (note that this has never happened to me). If it hasn't thickened yet, leave it alone for another few hours and eventually it will. When your cream has thickened, if you are not ready to make your butter right away, transfer the container to the fridge where you can leave it for up to another 24 hours.",
      "In order to churn properly, the cream needs to be at about 60F (15C). If you're taking it out of the fridge just let it warm up until it reaches this temperature; if you're making it from room temperature you'll need to place the bowl in a bath of ice water for a few minutes to cool it down. Also, fill a large bowl with water and ice cubes and keep it handy.",
      "You can use any method you want to beat the cream; handheld electric beater, stand mixer, etc - even whisking by hand. Basically, just put the thickened cream in a clean, deep bowl and start beating as if you're making whipped cream. When the cream starts to form stiff peaks, reduce the speed to low. At this point watch carefully; first the peaks will start to look grainy, and a few seconds later the cream will break. When it does you'll know it - globules of yellow butterfat will be swimming in a sea of buttermilk, and if you're beating too fast you'll have buttermilk everywhere. Stop beating and carefully tilt the bowl over a cup, holding back the butter clumps as best you can, and drain away as much buttermilk as possible. You can use this just like commercial buttermilk, by the way, and it's delicious.",
      "Now you have to wash the butter to get rid of all the residual buttermilk, which would cause it to spoil prematurely. Using a fork (my preferred implement) or a stiff rubber spatula, pour some of your reserved icewater over the butter, kneading and stirring it around vigorously. The water will turn whitish and the butter will firm up, making it cohere and knead more easily. Pour out the liquid and repeat as many times as needed until the water sloshing around in your bowl is completely clear. After you've poured off the last of the liquid, continue kneading for a few more minutes to get as much water as possible out of the butter. If you want salted butter, add your favorite salt now, to taste.",
      "You've now got a generous supply of your very own cultured butter. Pack it into ramekins, roll it in waxed paper, or fill cute little molds with it before refrigerating; I recommend freezing some if you won't be able to finish what you've made within a week or so. Whether storing it in the fridge or freezer, though, keep it tightly covered, as butter is a sponge for other aromas."

Continue mixing until the dough looks smooth, about 5 minutes.",

You will lose half a tube on each end, hence yielding only 12 buns and 2 awesome slices of rye bread that you will eat immediately. The place where the tubes meet is now the center of the bun. They should split naturally but you can use a serrated knife to help them, if you choose. Note:Alternatively, I've found it works very well if you place tubes in a pan with higher sides and Slice between the natural separation. As long as the buns were touching each other while baking, you should still get the \"bread wall effect\" and the buns will be more even.",
