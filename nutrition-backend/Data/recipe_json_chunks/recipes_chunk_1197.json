    "ingredients": [],

      "NOTE: This is NOT a \"tidy\" dish to make, so create it in an area that corn kernels can safely \"fly away\" and not mess up anything. When the Amish make it, they have every item to be added, at the ready, so when the corn is cut from the cob in the deep bowl, the rest of the ingredients are dumped in, stirred and served within one minute of processing. The corn needs to be served HOT so the butter melts and the cheese becomes soft.",
      "Determine pot size to boil corn in, based on volume of corn cobs. I use a 6 quart Dutch oven to boil 4 ears in, a large canning kettle to boil up to 12 ears.",
      "Heat the water in your kettle to boiling. I do NOT salt my water for this, as I want the corn to be as sweet as possible and also, the Amish I learned it from do not salt their water for this recipe, either.",
      "While the water is coming to a boil, shuck your corn but leave on at least 2\" of the stalk end, so you have a handle to grab when you are cutting the corn kernels off off of the cob. The Amish use a pot holder or kitchen towel to hold the hot corn but I use a handful of sturdy paper towels to save my hand from the heat.",
      "Dice the Swiss cheese into the same size as the corn kernels. Place the diced cheese, the soft butter and the dash of cayenne pepper into a small serving bowl. Set aside; this will be added to the corn bowl immediately after shucking.",
      "Before placing corn cobs into the water, have the following items ready: a pair of tongs to remove the corn cobs; a pot holder/paper towels to hold the hot corn; a kitchen towel or paper towels to blot the water off of the corn cob and keep them warm; a super sharp knife to cut off the kernels, and a WIDE and DEEP heat-proof bowl to cut the corn kernels into. This deep bowl is where the cut corn and Swiss cheese will be mixed and served.",
      "When the water has reached boiling, add corn cobs. Heat for ONLY 1-2 minutes, only until corn is almost just blanched. The kernels should be crisp and *pop* in your mouth when eaten.",
      "With the tongs, remove the hot corn cobs and place onto the kitchen towel, to blot the water and stay covered, to keep in their heat while processing each ear of corn.",
      "Using the pot holder or paper towels, grab the handle of the corn and using the sharp knife, cut the kernels off the cob into the deep bowl, starting at the top and working down. The faster you work, the hotter the corn kernels will be. It's okay if they come off as \"strips\" of corn; they will break up when you stir them with the other ingredients.",
      "After the corn has been cut from the cooked ears, immediately add the diced Swiss cheese, butter and cayenne pepper to the hot corn kernels and stir until the butter is melted, about 30 seconds. The cheese should still be in chunks, not melted. Taste to see if a wee dash of more cayenne should be added.",
      "Serve immediately. Since this dish is to be served very hot, what the Amish do is make multiple batches if more is desired. So, they'll make the 1st batch, eat it and enjoy it, make another batch, eat and enjoy that one, equally. As with many agricultural families, when a first crop comes in of anything: corn, tomatoes, potatoes, the farm family will make their first meal nothing but the featured food. So, with the first harvest of corn, the Amish make this corn dish the entire meal, nothing else is served except a dessert. This is also the way that I grew up, so I found nothing odd about this celebration of the first season's harvest."

      "First, prepare the filling. Put the onion in a medium frying pan, and without adding the oil, \"sweat\" it over medium heat, stirring often, just until slightly softened. Add the oil and when it is heated up, add the tomato paste and pepper paste. Stir to mix. Toss in the rice and sugar, and cook over low heat, stirring frequently to prevent the rice from sticking to the bottom of the pan, for 10-15 minutes. To check for doneness of the filling - take a bite on a rice grain: if it is soft on the outside and only slightly grainy inside, the filling is ready. Take care not to overcook. The rice will cook further inside the peppers. Remove the filling from the heat. Add the mint. Season with salt. Stir to mix and allow to cool.",
      "Meanwhile, wash the peppers and pat dry. Cut a circle around the pepper stalk, leaving the circle attached. It will serve as a lid later. With your fingers, push the core of the peppers to the sides (because their core is tiny and the seeds are minimal, there is no need to remove them). Rub the inside of the shells with some salt.",
      "Fill the peppers with the rice filling half full (do not overfill - the rice will expand while cooking). Put the pepper \"lids\" on. If you like, you could place a small grape tomato under each lid. Arrange the peppers in a saute pan (large enough to fit all the peppers) in a slightly overlapping manner. Pour in the water.",
      "Cover and cook over medium heat, until liquid is reduced to oil and the rice is fully cooked, about 1 hour. Note that the cooked peppers should not be mushy and should hold their shape nicely. Remove from the heat. If you wish, drizzle some olive oil on top of the peppers. Cover and allow to cool completely (yes, covered). Serve cold. This dolma stores well in the refrigerator for up to 3 days."

Using a fork, scramble the egg and slowly incorporated the flour until you have mixed all the egg with all the flour and have a very stiff dough. It needs to be very firm, don't worry if it feels tough. Knead the pasta dough until even on a lightly floured surface, adding more flour until the dough no longer sticks to the surface. Set aside and make you filling.",

Divide dough into smaller balls and begin rolling on a lightly floured surface. Roll until the pasta is very thin, and no longer contracts back into itself. This is called \"Breaking\" the dough. When you have reached this point, you can cut the pasta into the shapes you would like, place the filling inside (a spoonful for ravioli) Close and seal the pasta. Set aside on a lightly floured surface until all are ready to cook. Cook in boiling salted water for 2 minutes (or less) when the filled pasta shapes float. Remove to a buttered dish and when all shapes have been cooked, pour over the sauce, and serve.",

(The frosting needs to go on the cake as soon as it comes out of the oven, because it is a quick-setting frosting) In a medium saucepan, add 1/2 butter and brown sugar and bring it to a boil. Once it starts bubbling, add in the 1/4 cup of milk and bring up to a boil, stirring frequently to create an even mixture.",
      "As soon as it starts boiling again, remove the pot from heat and add in the powdered sugar and maple flavoring. Beat with a wooden spoon until it is smooth. If you've timed it right, you should finish with this around the same time as the cake is being pulled from the oven. If it has already set, I stir it rapidly again.",
