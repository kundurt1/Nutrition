      "Tip: It's so important to let the beef rest before slicing it. This allows the juices to redistribute from the outside of the roast throughout the whole roast, making this lean cut very juicy."

Perhaps recruit family members to help. Make sure all the skin is removed from the pistachios and the walnuts, no exception!",
      "Add the dried fruit and the nuts to the container along with the rosewater and 5 cups of cold water. Stir well. The water should be at lead 1 inch above the ingredients. Refrigerate for 2-4 days. The longer you leave it the sweeter it gets. It will keep in the fridge for up to 7 days.",

      "Add rice, water, corn, green onion, bullion and roughly half of the diced tomatoes to a rice cooker. Cook as you normally would. (Or, bring to a boil in a saucepan, reduce heat and simmer until done, about 12-15 minutes.) Cool thoroughly.",
      "Meanwhile, brown beef and onion in skillet. Drain off the fat (I usually rinse it off under hot water in a mesh colander.) Add the seasoning mix and remaining tomatoes (including the juice,) stir well. Set aside to cool.",
      "Meanwhile, if you are using block cheese, shred it. Toss with as little cornstarch as is possible (this will help keep the pieces from forming a single glob in the freezer.) If you buy pre-shredded cheese, you don't need it.",
      "TO ASSEMBLE: Make sure that all food is cooled enough that it won't melt a ziplock bag. The ground meat should fit into a quart sized bag. The rice should also fit into a quart sized bag. The cheese will probably fit into a sandwich size bag. The tortillas may need a gallon size, depending on what kind you use. If you made beans, I'd put them in a quart bag. After all of the food is in bags, smooth it out so that you have nice flat bags, being careful not the break the seals. Freeze on something flat, such as a cookie sheet. The next day, or several hours later, place all ingredients in one gallon or 1 1/2 gallon bag and seal.",
      "TO REHEAT: First off, smash the bag of cheese to separate the pieces, and pour in to a serving dish to defrost on the counter. Microwave the beans, rice, and meat together in their bags on high for 3 minutes. Remove them each to a serving bowl, and microwave 3-10 minutes more, depending on how many bowls fit into your microwave at once. (You may need to smash the bags to separate the food, and break it up with a fork. I like to stir it once in the middle of reheating because microwaves don't heat evenly.) The tortillas should separate easily, and only need 30-40 seconds to warm them by the time everything else is warmed. The rice may need a tablespoon of water or broth added so it doesn't taste dry.",
      "It sounds complicated, but really you get a nice meal, and few dishes, in 10-15 minutes or reheating / set the table time."

Since this dish contains no meat, you can safely allow it to cool to room temperature, cover tightly and leave on your counter top over night. So, this dish can be made the day before an event, as I have done so many, many times. The KEY is let it reach room temperature BEFORE covering it."

Cover the peppers with foil and leave to cool; once cool, peel and tear into strips.",

Line with baking parchment and fill with baking beans. Bake blind for 30 minutes, lift out the paper and beans, and bake for 10-15 minutes more, until golden brown. Remove and allow to cool a little. Spread the onions over the bottom, then top with roasted veg. Scatter over half the thyme, dot first with small chunks of both cheeses and then the tomato halves, cut-side up. Whisk the eggs and cream with some salt and pepper, and pour into the tart; the tomatoes and cheese should remain exposed. Scatter the remaining thyme on top. Bake for 35-45 minutes, until the filling sets and turns golden. Rest for at least 10 minutes, then trim off the excess pastry, remove the tart from its tin and serve."
