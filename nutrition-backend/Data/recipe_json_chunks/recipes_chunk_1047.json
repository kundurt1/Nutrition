Plunge whole tomatoes into the boiling water (carefully so you don't splash! I use the slotted spoon and roll them in) for approximately 1 minute. Remove with slotted spoon and place in the ice water bath. Let the tomatoes rest in the water until cool enough to handle, then remove peel and squeeze out seeds. Puree the tomatoes in a blender or food processor. If you would like your sauce to be \"chunky\", chop two or three of the tomatoes and set aside.",
      "In a large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat, cook onion, bell pepper, carrot and garlic in oil and butter until onion starts to soften, about 5 minutes. Pour in pureed tomatoes. Stir in chopped tomato, basil, Italian seasoning, oregano and wine. Place bay leaf and whole celery stalks in pot. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low, cover and simmer for 2 hours. Stir in the tomato paste and simmer an additional 2 hours (depending on many factors, each batch of sauce may vary in consistency. You can adjust the simmering time up or down according to your taste in thickness). Discard bay leaf and celery.",
      "At this point, I normally cool the sauce and then run it through the blender or food processor once more because I like my sauce to be smooth. This allows me to use it in all types of recipes and, if needed, I can always make it chunky again by adding some more chopped veggies.",
      "Storage: You can store the sauce in the refrigerator for a couple of weeks but this makes a large batch so you may want to look for alternate, long-term storage methods. I have found that this sauce freezes rather well in zipper bags or plastic containers. I have used glass jars before but they have a tendency to crack in the extreme cold. Plastic containers are more pliable and don't crack as easily. If they do crack, you don't have to worry about little bits of glass becoming imbedded in your sauce.",
      "I also can my tomato sauce by processing it in canning jars and a hot water bath. The Internet is full of canning instructions if you decide to can. However, once you open a jar of the canned sauce, refrigerate the remains immediately. I use 1 pint jars.",
      "Variation: Some people really like a sweet tomato sauce (my wife included). If this is your taste, then you can add 1 tablespoon of white sugar and 1 tablespoon of brown sugar when you first start simmering the sauce and adjust from there if you want it sweeter. As an alternative, you could also use a sweet red wine such a port or Marsala."

Gradually whisk in chicken broth and wine; increase heat to medium-high and bring to boil, whisking occasionally, then reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until thickened, about 2 minutes. Whisk liquid from mushrooms and beef into sauce and simmer to incorporate. Stir about 1/2 cup of hot sauce into sour cream, then stir mixture back into sauce.

I bake at 400 for about 12-15 minutes depending on the thickness of the chicken. They should be golden brown.",

Now add the chickpeas, lentils, barley/farro, and bulgur - stirring between each addition. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and simmer. Take a taste of the broth a few minutes into the simmer - you can make adjustments for salt here - if you're using water in place of broth, you can add a teaspoon of salt for starters and add more later if needed.",

      "Add 2 cups tomato puree (or in a bind you can use tomato sauce). Cook for about 5 minutes. If using fresh pureed tomatoes, you should cook the sauce about 10 minutes.",
      "Stir in the sugar, salt, turmeric, garam masala and cayenne powder. Reduce heat to low and cook 3 more minutes.",
      "Remove the pan from the heat and quickly stir in the 1 cup cream. Put the sauce back on the heat and cook another minute or two to just heat the sauce, but do not let it boil. Check for salt. Garnish with fresh minced cilantro.",
      "This sauce can be made earlier in the day or even the day before if it is refrigerated. The sauce will thicken, so will need to be thinned out when reheating.",
      "Make the kofta. To begin, put 4 cups mashed potatoes into a large mixing bowl. The potatoes need to be somewhat dry. You can also use instant mashed potatoes that you have made up on the dry side.",
      "Stir 1 Table. butter or ghee into the potatoes.",
      "Meanwhile, steam the small cauliflower florets and the 1/2 grated carrot until the cauliflower is soft. Drain and roughly mash up the cauliflower until it is in little pieces. Add to the potatoes. Add 1/4 cup frozen peas, 1/4 cup cooked corn kernals (optional, but tastes good), 1 teaspoon baking powder, 2 teaspoons ground cumin, 1 teaspoon ginger paste, 1/2 teaspoon cayenne powder, 1/2 teaspoon turmeric and salt to taste. Stir gently, but until everything is well mixed.",
      "Take 12 cashews and roughly break them into pieces with your hands and add to the vegetable mixture. Add fresh minced cilantro and 3-4 Table. chickpea flour or all-purpose flour to bind. Mix. Check for salt. If the mixture isn't dry enough, add more flour.",
      "Form the potato mixture into golf-size balls. Set aside for a while, if desired, covered with plastic, or make up right away.",
      "When ready to fry the vegetable balls, in a medium-size saucepan put oil for deep frying and heat the oil over medium-high heat for about 10-12 minutes. When the oil is hot, carefully add 4-5 of the balls and quickly brown them. The inside of the balls are already cooked, so you are just browning the outside. Cook quickly. Don't add too many balls, or the temperature of the oil will reduce too much and the balls might start dissolving. Drain on paper towel. Repeat with the rest of the balls.",
      "To serve: put a few of the balls on the plate and spoon the sauce (gravy) over the top.",
      "Many people like to eat vegetarian kofta balls with just potatoes and grated paneer cheese. I like the texture when using the vegetables. If you want to add some paneer cheese to the mixture, reduce the amount of potatoes by one cup, and replace it with one cup of grated paneer cheese. The word kofta usually means ball shaped, and can be either vegetables, meat or even ball shaped sweet desserts.",
      "If the kofta balls start breaking apart while frying, you can try several tricks: 1. Increase the heat of the oil; 2. Add more chickpea flour to the balls to make them more dry; 3. Dip the balls in a batter of chickpea flour, water, salt, a dash of cayenne and a dash of ground cumin (optional) and then fry; 4. Put the kofta under the broiler to lightly brown instead of frying."

Add the tomato paste, let this bubble until slightly browned 2-3 minutes; this will give us a nice earthy smoke flavored sauce. Next, add the Cola and Beer (there will be extra beer you know what to do) add the Ketchup and the soy sauce and bring to a simmer until it thickens up, around 3-5 minutes.",
