      "In a large bowl, whisk together egg, mayonnaise, mustard, pimento, parsley, Old Bay Seasoning, worcestershire sauce, Tabasco, pepper and salt. Add crab meat and 1/4 c. saltines. Toss the mixture gently. Spread remaining 1/2 c. saltines on a plate. Form crab mixture with a 1/3 c. measuring cup, gently into eight 3/4 inch thick patties. Coat the top & bottom of each patty carefully with the saltines, transferring the crab cakes to a sheet of waxed paper. In a large skillet, heat oil and butter over moderately high heat until the foam subsides. Saute crab cakes, in batches if necessary, 1-2 minutes on each side, or until they are golden. Transfer them as they are cooked to a heated platter. Serve crab cakes with lemon wedges."
