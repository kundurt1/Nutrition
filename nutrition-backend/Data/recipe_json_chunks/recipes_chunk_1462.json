Allow the mixer to beat them into the dry ingredients, on low speed. Pour in the club soda in a slow drizzle. Pour in only as much as is needed to wet all the ingredients completely. The dough should feel soft and firm, like a baby's bottom.",
      "Attach the dough hook to the mixer and stir the dough on medium speed for 5 minutes. This will give the dough a chance to cohere more evenly. It will also whip air into the dough, which will cut the usual density of gluten-free bread. After 5 minutes, turn off the mixer and transfer the dough to an oiled bowl. (If you do not have a stand mixer, knead the bread by hand on a gluten-free-floured surface, for at least 10 minutes.)",
      "Turn off the oven. Put the bowl into the oven, with a damp towel over the top of it. Leave the bowl in the oven for 90 minutes. The dough will not have risen much, at this point. There is no gluten to stimulate that rising. Accept that.",
      "After 1 hour, take the bowl out of the oven and put it on the stovetop to continue rising. Turn the oven on to 500 degrees F. Put a cast-iron pot, large enough to hold the bread, into the oven. (A cast-iron Dutch oven with an enamel surface is ideal, but any large pot or pan will do, as long as it has a lid.) Leave the Dutch oven in the oven for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, the dough will continue to rise on the stove.",
      "After 30 minutes, carefully take the Dutch oven out of the oven. Without worrying too much about a perfect shape, transfer the wet dough into the hot Dutch oven. Put the lid on and immediately push the Dutch oven back into the hot oven. Do not turn down the heat. Allow the bread to cook for the entire 30 minutes. By the end, it will smell like freshly baked bread. Take the Dutch oven out of the oven, remove the lid, and voila -- a wonderfully crusted loaf of gluten-free bread. Allow the bread to cool for 10 minutes, then cut right into it.",
      "For olive bread, add 1/2 cup of chopped kalamata olives into the dough. For rosemary bread, add 1 tablespoon of chopped fresh rosemary into the dough, then sprinkle thick crystals of sea salt on the top of the bread before baking. Be creative. At the end of the evening, slice up any remaining bread and put it into the freezer. Gluten-free bread usually turns rock hard the next day."

Dip a paper towel into about 2 tablespoons of melted butter and rub the bottom and side of the crepe pan generously with the butter. Set the pan over moderately high heat. Pour in 3 tablespoons of the batter and tilt the pan to distribute it evenly; pour any excess batter back into the bowl. Cook the crespella until browned on the bottom, about 1 minute. Turn the crespella and cook the second side for about 10 seconds, then slide it out onto a baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining batter to make 12 crespelle, overlapping them slightly on the baking sheet. Just before serving, cover the crespelle loosely with foil and rewarm them in the oven for about 3 minutes.",

      "Wine Recommendation: The delicate flavors and buttery-creamy texture of the mascarpone and the sweetness of the corn-based crespelle call for a round and rich-flavored sparkling wine with a mouth-filling texture. The wine also needs enough acidity to stand up to the pungent capers. The superlative Nonvintage Bellavista Franciacorta Brut fills the bill admirably.",

Try not to stretch the bacon when wrapping the sausages. Place the bacon-wrapped smokies onto the foil-lined sheet pan, seam side down. Continue with the rest of the bacon and smokies. Using a spoon, put a little bit of the thick glaze on top of each bacon-wrapped smokie, trying to coat each one evenly. You should have just enough glaze to do the entire batch.",
      "Bake the smokies for about 35 minutes or until they are lightly brown on top. Immediately transfer the smokies to a serving plate or a slow cooker set on low to keep warm."
