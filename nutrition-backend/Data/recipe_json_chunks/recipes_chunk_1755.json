      "Another way to temper chocolate is called seeding.",
      "In this method, add small pieces of unmelted chocolate to melted chocolate.",
      "The amount of unmelted chocolate to be added depends on the temperature of the melted chocolate, but is usually 1/4 of the total amount.",

      "The classic way to temper chocolate is called tabliering.",
      "Two thirds of the melted chocolate is poured onto a marble or another cold work surface.",
      "The chocolate is spread out and worked with a spatula until its temperature is approximately 81 degrees F. At this stage, it is thick and begins to set.",
      "This tempered chocolate is then added to the remaining non-tempered chocolate and mixed thoroughly until the mass has a completely uniform temperature.",
      "If the temperature is still too high, part of the chocolate is worked further on the cold surface until the correct temperature is reached.",
      "This is a lot of work, requires a lot of room, and makes a big mess.",
      "A simple method of checking tempering, is to apply a small quantity of chocolate to a piece of paper or to the point of a knife.",
      "If the chocolate has been correctly tempered, it will harden evenly and show a good gloss within a few minutes."
