    "title": "chocolate-almond giant cinnamon bun cake",
    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "In a small bowl, heat the milk until it's warm but not hot, then stir in the yeast and a pinch of sugar and let stand until foamy, about 5 minutes.",
      "In the bowl of a standing electric mixer fitted with the paddle, beat the butter with the 1/2 cup of granulated sugar and the teaspoon of salt at medium speed until light and fluffy.",
      "Beat in the eggs, one at a time, until blended. Whisk together the flour and the cocoa powder, then beat in about 2 cups into the butter mixture at low speed until incorporated. Beat in the warm milk mixture, scraping in any yeast that has settled in the bottom of the bowl.",
      "Switch to a dough hook. Gradually add the remaining flour and beat at medium speed until a soft, sticky dough forms, about 5 minutes. Add the chopped chocolate and pulse the machine to incorporate it.",
      "Scrape the dough into a large, lightly oiled bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Let the dough stand in a warm place until it is doubled in size, about 1 hour.",
      "Make the filling by mixing together the butter, brown sugar, cinnamon, and 1 teaspoon almond extract. Stir in the chopped chocolate and almond paste and set aside.",
      "When the dough has risen, turn it out onto a lightly-floured surface and divide in half. Roll each half into a rectangular about 1/4-inch thick, then transfer to a parchment-lined baking sheet (use a rolling pin to help you) and freeze for 15 minutes, until thoroughly chilled. Butter a 10-inch cake pan or springform pan.",
      "Next, spread the filling over the chilled dough rectangles. (You might want to use your hands to evenly distribute the filling, as there are chunks of chocolate and almond paste that make smooth spreading difficult.)",
      "Slicing from one short end to the other, cut the rectangles into long 1 1/2-inch wide strips. Roll one strip up as you would a normal cinnamon roll and place it in the center of the prepared baking dish. For the rest of the strips, you'll wrap them around this central roll to form a giant spiraling bun.",
      "Cover with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place until puffy, about 1 hour. (You can also put the cake pan in the fridge, covered, and let it rise overnight. But be sure to allow the dough to come to room temperature before you bake it.) When it's almost finished rising, preheat the oven to 350\u00b0 F. Bake for 35 to 40 minutes, until an instant-read thermometer inserted in the center registers 180\u00b0 F.",
      "Let the cake stand for at least 5 minutes before turning out, then inverting onto a serving platter, or releasing the springform pan.",
      "For the icing, in the bowl of an electric mixer, beat the cream cheese on medium-high for 4 to 5 minutes, until light and fluffy. Add the confectioners' sugar and remaining 1/4 teaspoon almond extract and beat until combined, about 1 minute. Add the salt and milk and mix on low speed until smooth. If the glaze is too thick, add more milk, one tablespoon at a time, until it's drizzle-able. Drizzle over the still-warm cake.",
      "If you want, top the cake with sugared almonds. In a small skillet over medium-high heat, combine the almonds and sugar. Cook and stir until sugar is melted and almonds are toasted, about 3 minutes. Transfer almonds to another dish to cool."

      "In a small bowl or measuring cup, whisk together the olive oil, shallot, salt, lemon juice, vinegar, and mustard until evenly blended.",
      "In a large bowl, stir together the lentils, arugula, radishes, endive, cucumber, and dill. Drizzle evenly with the dressing, then toss or stir until all the ingredients are evenly coated. Stir in the walnuts and season with black pepper to taste. Dot the top of the salad with small bits of the cashew cheese (about 1/2 teaspoon each).",
      "Serve salad right away, or store in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days.",
      "Put the cashews in a food processor or blender (preferably a high-speed blender). Add the nutritional yeast, salt, herbes de Provence, pepper, lemon juice, and garlic. Pulse a few times to break the cashews down until they have a wet, coarse, mealy texture.",
      "With the motor running, drizzle in 2 tablespoons of the water. Now it's time for some kitchen intuition: Keep adding water, stopping\r\noccasionally to scrape down the sides of the work bowl, until the mixture has a good consistency. It should be similar to a thick hummus-a little coarse, but smooth and spreadable. You may not need all of the remaining 2 tablespoons of water. (If using a blender, start on a low speed and gradually increase to high speed as you add the water, using a plunger attachment the entire time to keep the mixture blending.)",
      "Taste and adjust the seasonings as desired. Stored in a covered container in the fridge, the cheese will keep for about 5 days"

      "We are going to sous vide the pork chops (a fancy way of saying we are cooking in a controlled temperature water bath for a long period of time). Grab your immersion circulator and set it to 151 degrees for 4 hours. This will allow for the meat to cook evenly and remain moist. Here's the SECOND TRICK...",
      "Contrary to popular belief you don't need to buy a vacuum sealer to cook sous vide. Dip the ziploc bag in the water slowly, leaving one corner at the top exposed to the air. You will see the bag suction around the meat. Close the corner and you're done. I like to secure the bag to the water bath tub with a clip.",
      "After the 4 hours, the chops will have a soft, somewhat unappetizing look to them. Not to worry. Let rest for 10 minutes (you can save the bag liquids to baste on the chops when you finish them on the grill). Here's where the THIRD TRICK comes in to properly finish your chops....",
      "Remove the grates from your grill, leaving only the flavor pans underneath. Skewer the chops with a two rods (easily found at your nearest home store). Your grill should have rests on the sides to allow the rods to rest on them, as most grills come capable with that in the case of basket grilling. Rub the last tablespoon of butter on the chops. Coarsely chop the 2nd sprig of rosemary and coat the chops on both sides. Place over the grill on high heat for roughly 5 minutes per side uncovered (as we arent really looking to cook the chops internally) and once the flame starts kicking up onto the underside of the chops. Indirect heat is the key here. As the fat drips from the chops it will flare up onto the chops, crusting them nicely but not overcooking them on the inside. Initially, the chops won't appear to be causing much of a flame but as the butter and fat melts off the chop, you will see the flame increase.",
      "Here's the FOURTH TRICK...I usually know the chops are done when the fat from each handle is nicely crusted (hence why I don't french the bones). Plus, in my opinion, it's the most delicious part."

Let them cool down completely; one by one pulse them in food processor or spice grinder. Just make sure not to over process as it will then start removing the oils and convert into butter. We do not want that. Leave it aside.",

Let them bake for about 15- 20 minutes until a toothpick inserted comes out clean. Also, the doughnuts might leave the edges as they are baked. Another way to find out if they are done or not.Let them cool completely on a cooling rack.",
      "Icing- Meanwhile the doughnuts are cooling, make the icing. Sift the sugar into a bowl , add in the lemon / orange juice along with milk. \r\nOnce the doughtnuts cool off, pick them one by one by hands and dip them into the icing.

      "Transfer bones and vegetables to a large stockpot. Add 14 cups water, reserving the last 1/2 cup to deglaze the roasting sheet, using a metal spatula to scrape up all the browned bits before adding mixture to stockpot. Water should be covering bones by about an inch.",

One at a time, carefully take out bones and put them on a plate near your stockpot. Using small tongs and a fork (or two forks) remove the meat. Transfer meat (should have between 3-4 cups depending on how meaty your bones were) to a container with a tight fitting lid and refrigerate. Return bones, including cartilage and fat, and any liquid that may have accumulated on the plate, to stockpot. Continue simmering for 1 hour. At this point, you can allow mixture to cool slightly before refrigerating overnight.

The next day, remove congealed fat layer from surface of stock before simmering for a final hour, adding the smoked ham hock, whole cilantro plants and scallions.

      "When almost all of the sesame seeds are mashed, add in 1 T of gojuchang. If you know you love heat, add 2 T. As you turn the pestle around the mortar, the gojuchang will ball up around the sesame seed mixture. Whisk this into the stock and allow soup to simmer for 20 minutes. If there is still a lot of sesame-gojuchang paste stuck in the mortar, add a little bit of stock to the bowl, stir, and pour mixture into the pot.",

Place a heavy roasting pan or Dutch oven over 2 burners and add olive oil. Heat the oil over MEDIUM HIGH to HIGH heat. When hot, add the brisket, fat side down to the pan.

Turn the heat to medium-high and boil the mixture about 3 minutes, stirring constantly with a high temperature silicone spatula to prevent burning. Add sugar and continue to stir constantly until sugar is completely dissolved. You'll notice that the mixture will thicken and begin to boil. Keep stirring while also monitoring the heat. If the mixture boils too close to the top of the pan lower the heat just enough, but no more than necessary, to prevent a boil over. Keep stirring and monitoring until the temperature reaches the hard crack stage (300 degrees F.) Be patient and keep stirring, this could take as much as 20 minutes depending on the temperature of your burner. Do not leave the candy unattended.",

Pour onto the center of the prepared baking sheet. Sprinkle sea salt and as much of the remaining 2 teaspoons minced rosemary as you like evenly across the surface of the hot candy.",
      "Allow to cool completely, then crack into various sized pieces.",
      "This candy is at its best if eaten within a few days. Keep covered and refrigerated to keep the pieces from sticking together."

      "To make brown butter: In a small skillet or saucepan over medium heat, melt the butter completely; cook until it turns brown and smells nutty, about 4 to 6 minutes. Be sure to stir frequently, scraping up any bits from the bottom so they don't burn. Take the pan off heat and transfer the brown butter to a glass measuring cup with a spout. Let cool to just above room temperature.",
      "To make mayonnaise: \r\nCombine egg yolk, lemon juice, cold water, and salt in a medium mixing bowl. Whisk until well integrated and bright yellow, about 30 seconds.",
      "Whisking constantly, add about half of the brown butter to yolk mixture, a few small drops at a time, over the span of about 4 minutes. Resist the urge to add the brown butter too quickly; you want a nice emulsion to form. Gradually add remaining brown butter in a very slow, thin stream, whisking constantly, until mayonnaise is thick and spreadable, about 4 additional minutes. Taste for seasoning and balance. (Compared to mayonnaise made with oil, the brown butter version will be slightly less thick. I'm presuming this is due to the water content in the butter.)",
      "Note 1: you can use a mini food processor or hand blender to make mayo (and I assume that this brown butter version is no different). Generally, I find the old fashioned whisk-by-hand method to be the most reliable and satisfying - and it yields a silkier-textured mayonnaise in my opinion.",
      "Note 2: if your mayonnaise breaks or doesn't thicken enough, you can save it! Empty your mayonnaise into a glass measuring cup with a spout. Whisk 1 yolk (at room temperature) and another drop or two of lemon juice in your mixing bowl. Whisking constantly, add the broken mayonnaise drip by drip to the yolk mixture until it starts to thicken, then add the remainder in a slow, thin stream.",
      "Cover and chill. It should keep 2 to 3 days. It'll thicken considerably once cold due to the butter; take out of the refrigerator and let warm to cool room temperature, stirring well to restore your smooth, spreadable consistency, before you plan to use. Get ready to use it on everything."

As you should do with anything you leave near fire for that long, check it once and a while. You're gonna want to stir it and mash up the prunes a bit when you check the pot, that way the prunes will dissolve, and you'll forget you're eating prunes. Prunes are gross, and that's why we have to use a crap-ton of fire and meat to make them worthwhile.",

      "Take a couple of forks and shred those babies up (hooray for phrases that sound awful out of context!). You want the pieces to be a bit bigger than your standard pulled pork shred, so you'll have nice big pieces in the bibimbap. Just don't go too nuts with the forks and you'll be fine.",
      "After the ribs have been chunkified, add them back to the liquid and leave it on the lowest setting your burners have until the rest of the bibimbap's ready.

If you don't have room for all of it, do it in two batches. You want this all to come out at roughly the same time so they're all hot out of the pan. The bean sprouts and mushrooms should take about 5 or 6 minutes, all you need to do is keep them on the heat until they're tender. The chard might take a bit longer, just keep cooking until it's wilted.",

But the beauty of bibimbap is the ingredients, so do it right, and do it in the right order. And wash your damn hands. Jesus, that's disgusting.",
      "1. Put some rice in the bowl.",

Remove from heat.",
      "Pour into heatproof bowl or measuring cup add the vanilla and corn syrup and stir. Cover in plastic and refrigerate until cold must be 40 degrees or less.

      "When the custard is cold add to your ice cream maker and when it looks like soft serve ice cream add the chopped pistachios. To make the raspberry swirl you will need to do it in 3 stages. Place a third of the ice cream in your freezer container,generously drizzle raspberry syrup. Repeat for the other two layers. With a butter knife or a bamboo skewer carefully swirl around a couple of times careful not to over do it you don't want it blended in with the custard. Place in freezer for approximately 4 hours so its scoopable."

Once cooked and still hot brake the shells from the tails and claws to recuperate and the flesh (try to keep the flesh intact). Save the flesh for later on.",
      "Basil infusion\r\nGet the head of the lobster and the shells from the tail and claws and put in a pot with olive oil. Cook them in a medium heat for about 10 min. pour now the cognac/ bourbon and flambe. Let it reduce for about 3-5 min. This will evaporate the alcohol. Now add the white wine and let it reduce the same way as the cognac/bourbon. Add the cream and bring it to a boil. Once boiled put the basil and a lid on and let it rest for about 30 minutes. This will permit the basil to infuse with the cream just like making tea. \r\nNow save for later on.",
      "Chorizo\r\nPeel the chorizo (good quality chorizos have a skin, always better to take them off). Cut them into fine juliennes and roast them in a high heat saute pan. No need for olive oil since chorizo has a lot of fat.\r\nOnce with a nice coloration save them on a absorbent paper tower. This will dry the chorizo\r\nSave for platting later on.",
      "Macadamias\r\nIn a cooking tray season the macadamias with kosher salt (preference) and cook them in an oven at 350 F for about 5 - 10 min. They need to be brown but not too much or else they will taste like burned.",
      "Beets and Turnips\r\nWash and peel the vegetables and cut them the same size. Small rectangles would be best but the shape is up to your choice. Cook them separately in a pot with olive salt.",
      "Plating \r\nPlatting is a suggestion, you can serve the way you prefer but he is how we pictured this recipe. On a rould plat open the burrata cheese and season on top of it with salt olive oil and pepper. Lay the cooked chorizos on top of it.\r\nThe pieces of lobster should be reheated in the basil infusion and then placed on top of the chorizos.\r\nThe beets, turnips and macadamias would be placed around the Burrata. Drizzle the rest of the sauce around the plate for decoration.\r\nServe it while is still hot\r\nEnjoy!"

Fold the edge on the right one-quarter of the way across the dough. Make sure the edges meet.)

Fold the edges from the longer side inward, meeting each other exactly in the center of the dough. Fold one half over onto the other half. The resulting shape looks a bit like a heart and is also often referred to as an \"elephant ear.\"",

At this point, you can freeze the palmiers for baking later (you might have to bake the cookies for an extra 5 minutes).",

      "Next, place the paella pan in the oven and bake, uncovered for 16 minutes. After 16 minutes, the rice should be tender and the liquid should be mostly absorbed. If the rice is too dry, add a couple tablespoons of water and bake 1 minute longer. If the rice is too wet, place the pan back on the stovetop and cook it for a few minutes until the liquid has evaporated. Once the rice is the right consistency, remove it from heat and cover with foil for 10 minutes. This will allow the rice to finish cooking and become beautifully fluffy.",

Next, add the remaining 1/2 cup of white wine. Bring the mixture to a simmer and add the mussels. Place the lid on tightly and allow the mussels to steam for 3 minutes. After that, add the shrimp and cook for an additional 4 minutes. Once the shellfish are done, place them in the rice mixture. Sprinkle with parsley and serve!"

      "NOTE: Good quality Southeastern curry paste is very important. I'm using \"panang\" curry paste but by all means, red curry paste would work wonderfully as well. Nowadays I can easily find packaged curry pastes of all sorts in a lot of supermarket (or amazon).",
      "PREPARE THE WINGS: Wash the wings really clean under cold water. Use a paring knife and split the two connecting bones in the wings on the back side (the side with a much thinner skin). This step will do 3 things:\r\n\r\n1). It allows the skin and muscle to contract when they're cooking resulting in a much firmer texture in both the meat and the skin.\r\n2). No need to flip the wings to the other side anymore (saves a lot of work), because the under-layer-skin will \"shrink and contract\" to the top layer and by the time it gets crispy, the meat underneath would be fully cooked.\r\n3). It will be really appreciated when it comes to the eating part.",
      "Lay the wings out skin-side up on a baking rack, with a baking sheet underneath to catch the dripping. IMPORTANT: scatter a few pieces of celery stalks underneath to avoid the grease getting too hot and smoking up. Use a paper towel to dab the skins to soak up any excess moisture and let them air-dry, uncovered, for 30 min.",
      "MAKE THE SAUCE: Melt the butter in a sauce pot, then add the curry paste and stir fry until fragrant. Add the coconut milk, sugar, fish sauce and a few turns of black pepper. The proportion of fish sauce (for saltiness) and sugar (for sweetness) is what I did for the panang curry paste, but adjust the seasoning based on the curry paste you are using. Let the mixture simmer and reduce by 60% until thick and saucy.",
      "COOK THE WINGS: Preheat the top broiler on medium high (475\u00b0C/240\u00b0C), then put the baking sheet on the second highest level, leaving 3 ~ 4? space between the heat and the wings (remember the celery stalks underneath...). Rotate the positions of the wings periodically if your oven is known to heat unevenly. Let the skin crisp up, about 15 ~ 20 min. There's no need to turn them. When they come out of the oven, spoon the curry hot sauce over the wings and toss. ONLY use enough sauce to lightly coat the wings (may have extra sauce left), and squeeze fresh lime juice over the top. Eat when they are hot.\r\n\r\nIt's gonna be messy and dirty. It's gonna be awesome."

      "After three to four hours, your stock should be sufficiently reduced. It will look kinda gnarly, but who cares because it smells delicious.",
      "Next, strain the liquid through a colander into a large bowl. Sometimes one strain isn't enough to form a clear liquid, so toss out the solids and strain it once more.",
      "Put the stock in a few containers- maybe one to freeze and one to refrigerate, and you're done! Stock in the freezer should last ages, and stock in the fridge will last up to 5-7 days (I would plan on using it sooner rather than later- see any of the risotto or soup recipes on this blog for inspiration!). A simple and delicious day time task that is so rewarding- expect a recipe up on the blog soon that highlights our wonderful homemade stock!"

Press dough into a disk and wrap completely in the plastic. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours.\r\n3. Remove dough from refrigerator. Divide dough into 6 pieces. Roll each piece between a lightly-floured sheet of waxed paper and plastic wrap to a 1/8-inch thickness. Transfer rolled dough to a 3 3/4-inch tart pan and trim edges. Place in freezer. Repeat with remaining dough. You will get 6 individual tart shells from this recipe. You can use one large tart pan instead (9 1/2-inch to 10 1/4-inch).\r\n4. Preheat oven to 400?F. Line tart shells with foil and fill with dried beans or rice. Place tart pans on a rimmed baking sheet and bake on middle rack of oven for 18 minutes. remove foil and beans/or rice and return tart shells to oven. Continue to bake until shells are a light golden brown. Remove from oven. Reduce oven temperature to 375?F.",
      "1. Brown the bacon in a large skillet. Transfer to paper towels to drain when done. Pour off the bacon fat, leaving a film of fat in the skillet. Add the corn kernels and cook over medium-low heat until just beginning to brown. Remove from heat and reserve. \r\n2. Break the goat cheese into small pieces and sprinkle with fresh thyme leaves.\r\n3. In a medium-size bowl, whisk together the eggs, heavy cream, milk, and green onions. Season with salt and pepper. \r\n4. Divide the goat cheese evenly between the 6 tart shells, followed by the corn kernels. Slowly pour the egg mixture over the tarts, filling to just below the rims. Place the tomato wedges in a spoke pattern in the center of each tart.\r\n5. Place the filled tart shells on a rimmed baking sheet in the center of the 375?F oven and bake for approximately 25 minutes, until the custard has set and the tomatoes are starting to shrivel.\r\n6. Remove from oven and garnish each tart with a sprig of fresh thyme. Eat either warm from the oven, or at room temperature."

Last time I did it, I used candied limes, strawberries, and cocoa powder to make it look like the Mexican flag.

Remove the seeds while keeping the integrity of each apple's flesh.\r\n\r\nIf you don't have a corer, there is actually a pretty easy alternative which I use. You slice each peeled apple horizontally, into 4-5 relatively thick slices. Then take each slice, firmly place it flat on the cutting board, and with the tip of the knife cut out a circle around the seed heart. Make sure that the end point of the knife goes all the way through the height of the slice. If you do this well, once you press gently that small circle in the middle, it will pop out immediately. If you don't do it so well, as you might not on the first 1-2 slices, you will have some nice peeled apple pieces to snack on. Cut, pop and repeat until all the rings are ready. The apple will start browning a bit probably, but this does nothing to the taste and in this case you don't need to worry about appearances, since the apple rings will be covered in batter.",
      "Mix all the wet ingredients (first 3 on the list)\r\n\r\nMix all the dry ingredients (the remaining 4).\r\n\r\nStir the dry mix into the wet mix and beat (using a fork is enough; no need for an electric mixer) until the batter is smooth. It should be pretty thick.",
      "At this point, place a deep skillet with a sufficient amount of vegetable oil (same note as above applies - you don't want your apple fritters to taste like olive oil) on the stove and heat it up. Instructions will often call for 375F (medium-high). I don't know anybody who actually measures this with a thermometer, but from long practice I know how the oil starts looking when it gets hot enough - something like surface \"waves\" start to appear. If you are really uncertain, you can always drip a small drop of the batter and see if it will start frying immediately. If so, you're ready to deep-fry the rings.",
      "Dip each slice into the batter and place carefully (to avoid potentially very painful splatters) into the hot oil. Fry a few at a time, but make sure they are not touching each other too closely. Your heat should not be too high, so you can afford to cover the pot and prevent a messy stove-top. Flip them over if necessary to brown evenly on both sides. They are done when they are golden brown all over.",
      "At this point you can sprinkle with a mix of crystal (granulated) sugar and cinnamon, although it is more for decoration than flavor, because the rings are wonderful as they are. You can serve warm, cold (but don't put in the fridge), or heated over. They can also be served with ice cream or maple syrup/molasses for dipping."

Combine the pulp with about a quarter of the chopped onion, 8 cups water, the red pepper flakes, and a generous amount of salt. Simmer for about half an hour. Then pass through a strainer to collect all of the solids. You should have about 7 cups of stock. Taste and adjust seasonings.",

Now add the pumpkin cubes, the dried beans, and the remaining stock. Cook on low for about 6 hours until the pumpkin and beans are both soft. Alternatively you could cook this from the start in a Dutch oven on the stovetop over very low heat, which will require less time but more supervision and a little more liquid. I'm a fan of cooking beans in a slow cooker because I like the way the slow, low heat allows them to plump up and infuse with flavor.",

Add remaining coconut milk to blood orange and maple syrup mixture, raising heat to bring mixture to a slow simmer. In a steady stream, slowly pour slurry into heated orange maple mixture, whisking vigorously and constantly to prevent lumps. When the slurry is fully incorporated, increase heat, bringing mixture to a boil, stirring constantly the entire time. Boil and whisk for approximately 1-2 minutes until mixture is thick and you can no longer taste the starch. Pour custard into pre-baked tart shells and chill until well set (4 hours or so).

Add peas and cook until warmed through, another minute or so. Add cooked vegetables, chopped spinach, and mint to the cooked polenta and stir well. Add plenty of salt and pepper, to taste. Serve immediately with a poached egg on top, if desired."

If you like things to be perfect you can use a ruler as a guide, they should be about 8 inches long.",
      "Cover each layer with parchment paper to keep them from drying out too much.",

      "Slice the eggplant thinly into 1/4? rounds. Cutting them at no thicker than this ensures they'll cook through in the sauce. Set up a bowl with flour and season it with a dash of salt and pepper. Set up another bowl with eggs, seasoning it with salt and pepper, as well. Dredge each eggplant slice first in the flour, shaking off any excess, then the egg. Lightly fry the eggplant on both sides until golden brown. Reserve the fried slices on a plate while you work on the next step.",
      "In a large bowl, mix the tomato sauce with all the herbs, salt, vinegar if you're adding it, and water.",
      "In a cast iron wide pot, saute the garlic, onions and carrots until the onions are slightly translucent. Ladle some of the tomato sauce over the onion mixture. (The onion layer prevents the eggplants from sticking or burning to the pan, while flavoring the sauce, too.) Start layering the eggplant slices in the pot, pouring a bit of tomato sauce between each eggplant layer. At the very end, pour enough sauce to just cover the eggplants. Depending on how big of a pot you're using or how many slices you get if your sauce doesn't cover the eggplants a bit, it's ok to press down the eggplants slightly below the sauce line or add a mix of tomato paste, water and salt to just cover the eggplants. (I love having a tube of tomato paste on hand for just these kinds of emergencies!)",
      "Over a very low flame, cover the pot and cook for 40-45 minutes. Check on the liquid every so often, adding more of the sauce so the eggplants stay submerged in the sauce. Once you remove the eggplants from your pot, the sauce can be whizzed up smooth or served as a textured sauce along with the slices.",
      "Serve about 3-4 slices per person with a dollop of sour cream and fresh chopped parsley.",
      "Notes: Cooking them over the stove top rather than in the oven is traditional and also prevents the sauce from drying out. The tomato sauce should be tangy and though you may want to skip the frying step, you really shouldn't. The minimal frying called for in this recipe preserves the shape of the eggplants while they cook in the sauce. If you want to \"health it up\" by removing the batter or battering them and then baking them instead of frying them, I can't guarantee that the texture or flavor will remain as Grandma made it. I did experiment with a panko bread crumb instead of flour once and the crumbs disintegrated into the sauce, making it thicker and making the eggplants an unappealing departure from the truth. The bonus to this eggplant recipe? You don't need to presalt them to take the bitterness out. They come out perfectly without this typical traditional step."

Take care to ensure that you don't tear the karela open.\r\nRub salt into the cavity and all over the exterior and set aside to drain for about 15-20 minutes.

      "Spicy-Sweet Nuts for topping. \r\n\r\nPreheat oven to 375. Rub a baking sheet with butter if you don't want it to be caked with maple syrup crystallization.\r\n\r\n2) Place 2 cups nuts, 1/2tsp cayenne, 1 tsp sea salt, 1/2 tsp black pepper, 1 tsp sage and/or rosemary in a dish. Drizzle with 1/8 cup maple syrup. \r\n\r\n3) Spread mixture evenly on the cookie sheet.\r\n\r\n4) Bake for approximately 10 minutes; do not walk away like I always do or else you will have black nuts and have to start over...\r\n\r\n5) Watch them like a hawk, they are ready when they begin to smell delicious. Remove from oven and cool. \r\n\r\n6) Try not to eat all of them before your gelato is ready",
      "Gelato\r\n\r\n1) Pour 1 c. maple syrup into a small saucepan and heat over medium at a simmer for about 5-7 mins, until it reduces slightly. Add the 2 c. milk and 2 c. cream to the pan and continue heating over low-medium heat, stirring constantly, for about 7 mins. Remove from the heat.\r\n\r\n2) Separate your 4 eggs and place the whites in a jar in the fridge for later use... (Im thinking meringue for a springy key-lime tart...) Place the yolks in the bowl of a stand mixer or in a medium-size bowl if you have a hand-held beaters. \r\n\r\n3) Beat the 4 egg yolks with the whisk attachment (or by hand) until they are light yellow and frothy. Very gradually pour your hot milk into the yolk mixture while the machine is running.",
      "4) Pour the whole shibang back into the saucepan and stir constantly over medium-low heat until the mixture lightly coats the back of a wooden spoon (about 10 mins). If you over do it and the eggs scramble, as I said above, just buzz with the immersion blender for about 2 seconds until it is a uniform liquid again.\r\n\r\n5) Chill for a long time... if you are short on time start it in the freezer for the initial cool-down and then move to the fridge before ice crystals start to form. You want it to be cold before you put it in the ice cream maker.\r\n\r\n7) Retrieve cold custard from refrigerator (it won't be really thick like an American idea of custard) and pour into your ice cream machine. I have the one that attaches to the kitchenaid. I turn it on and pour in the mixture while it is running or else it will freeze up! (Or follow the directions for your machine)."

    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "Grease a 9 1/2-inch fluted tart pan with a removable bottom lightly but thoroughly with butter or vegetable oil spray.",
      "To make the crust, put the oat flour, rice flour, sugar, salt, and baking soda in a medium bowl and whisk until thoroughly blended. Add the butter, cream cheese, and vanilla. Use a fork or the back of a large spoon (or your hands) to mash and mix the ingredients together until all are blended into a smooth, soft dough.",
      "Transfer the dough to the tart pan. The dough may seem much softer than other tart doughs. Use the heel of your hand and then your fingers and/or a small offset spatula to spread the dough all over the bottom of the pan. Press it squarely into the corner with the sides of your index finger to prevent extra thickness at the bottom edge, and press it as evenly as possible up the sides of the pan, squaring off along the top edge. Have patience: There is just enough dough (although you may not think so at first). If there is too much dough in one place (or hiding in the corners of the pan), pinch or scrape it off and move it elsewhere. Spread or smear the dough smooth with the spatula.",
      "Here's a final trick for a perfectly even crust: Press a sheet of plastic wrap against the bottom and up the sides of the pan and lay a paper towel on top. Set a straight-sided, flat-bottomed cup on the towel; press and slide the cup all over the bottom and into the corners to smooth and even the surface.",
      "Remove the paper towel but leave the plastic wrap in place. Refrigerate the pan for at least 2 hours, but preferably overnight and up to 3 days.",
      "Position a rack in the lower third of the oven and preheat the oven to 325\u00b0 F. Peel the plastic wrap from the crust. Set the pan on the baking sheet and bake the crust for 35 to 40 minutes, checking after about 15 or 20 minutes. If the crust has puffed up on the bottom, press it back down carefully with the back of a fork. Continue baking until the crust is decidedly golden brown (undercooked crusts are neither crunchy nor flavorful) and has slightly pulled away from the sides of the pan. Set the pan on a rack to cool completely before filling.",
      "To assemble the tart, leave the tart shell in the pan for support. If you will not be serving the tart within a couple of hours, moisture-proof the crust by spreading the bottom with the thinnest possible layer of soft butter; use a flexible plastic spreader or even your fingers to smear the butter over the bottom and sides of the crust. Chill the crust to set the butter before adding the pastry cream. (If you will be serving within 2 hours, skip this moisture-proofing step.)",
      "Spread the pastry cream evenly in the crust. If the berries are large, cut them in half. Start arranging the strawberries around the edges of the tart and work toward the middle. Arrange whole berries as close together as possible, or arrange halved berries cut side-up and overlapping. Refrigerate unless serving within 2 hours."

      "Transfer flour mixture to bowl, then sprinkle with water mixture. Use a rubber spatula to fold together, pressing down until mixture sticks together. Use cool, clean hands to fold several times into a homogenous mass. Transfer to plastic wrap, then press into a 1/2-inch thick disk. Cover completely and refrigerate at least 1 hour (up to 2 days).",
      "Moderately flour a work surface and roll dough into a 12- to 13-inch circle. Very lightly dust the surface with flour, then roll the dough around the rolling pin to transfer it to a pie plate. Trim the dough edges so they extend about 1/2-inch beyond the edge of the pan. Fold the edges under then flute the dough* or finish the dough by pushing the tines of a fork into the edge of the dough to flatten it against the lip of the pie pan. Lightly dock the bottom and sides of the dough with a fork.",
      "Chill the dough in the refrigerator for 40 to 45 minutes, then freeze for 20 to 25 minutes. This trick will help to minimize crust shrinkage.",
      "While crust is chilling, place an over rack in the lower middle position and heat the oven to 375\u00b0 F.",
      "Remove the crust from the freezer, then line with heavy-duty foil and add 2 cups of pennies or other pie weights. Bake for 30 minutes, then carefully remove the foil and weights. Continue baking the crust until light golden another 5 to 6 minutes.",
      "*To flute the dough: use the thumb and index finger of your dominant hand on the outer surface with the index finger of your other hand on the inner surface (or vice versa, whichever seems more comfortable to you). Hold your thumb and index finger about the width of your index finger apart. Push the dough with the index finger of your non-dominant hand into the space between the thumb and index finger of your dominant hand. Your fingers should be held approximately perpendicular to the edge of the dough. Repeat the process around the dough, keeping the thumb or index finger of your dominant hand in the last flute you made so the spacing stays consistent.",
      "Start making the filling when the crust has been in the oven for about 15 minutes. Melt the butter in a medium heatproof bowl set in a skillet of simmering water. One the butter is melted, remove the bowl from the skillet and add the brown sugar and salt. Stir until the brown sugar has all been moistened and the butter is absorbed. Beat in the eggs until mixture is homogenous. Beat in the marmalade and bourbon. Return the bowl to the skillet of water. Heat stirring continuously until the sugar has dissolved and the mixture is glossy and hot to the touch, about 130\u00b0 on an instant read thermometer. Remove from the heat and stir in the vanilla, orange blossom water, and orange zest. Stir in the nuts.",
      "Once the crust is done, remove it from the oven and decrease the oven temperature to 275\u00b0 F. Pour the filling into the crust (having hot filling in hot crust helps prevent crust sogginess). Scatter the chopped chocolate evenly over the top. Bake until the pie is set but still soft, when jostled it should jiggle a little like gelatin in the center, about 45 to 55 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool fully before slicing. If desired, warm for about 15 minutes in a 250\u00b0 F oven before slicing (highly recommended, especially if serving with a scoop of ice cream)."

      "Preheat your oven to 400 degrees. Slice your winter squash in half and scoop out the seeds and pulp. Cut off a very thin, level slice in the back of each half so that it can stand upright without rocking on its round edge. Grease or line a baking sheet with parchment and place the squash halves cut side up next to each other. Fill each \"bowl\" left behind by the seeds and pulp you scooped out with enough water so it's almost at the top of the \"bowl.\" This helps the squash cook faster, and will become the liquid used to bind the roux together for cheese sauce later. Bake until soft and a fork can easily pierce the squash all the way to the bottom, probably around 30 minutes but depends on the size of the squash.",
      "When the squash comes out of the oven, leave to cool somewhere out of the way. Then, fill your pasta pot with water and set it to boil.",
      "As you're waiting for the pasta water to boil, grate the cheese. Reserve a quarter cup to sprinkle on top before baking the mac.",
      "Whenever the water comes to a boil, salt and add your pasta to cook. You should cook it for one minute more than half of the suggested cooking time for your pasta shape on the box. Then, drain and rinse with cold water and set aside. Don't bother to wash the pasta pot, just put it back on the stove.",
      "Use a spoon to \"stir\" the \"bowl\" of each half of squash, as though you were mixing up a puree that you were going to serve inside the squash itself. Scrape the sides in to the water in the middle until you get a pretty loose puree mix. You'll add this to the roux in the next step.",
      "In the now empty pasta pot, melt all of the butter. Once melted, turn the heat to your stove's lowest setting and add all of the flour and stir with a fork or whisk until the mixture looks smooth and no lumps of flour are visible, about two minutes. Add the paprika or nutmeg if using. Grate the clove of garlic into the pot and stir to mix.",
      "Keeping the heat on low, add in all of the squash puree you just mixed, stirring as you drop spoonfuls in to the roux. Your goal is to add all of the water and scrape off all of the flesh from cooking the squash without getting squash skin in the mix, so if you have to leave a little bit behind on the squash \"walls\" that's OK. The mix should be a fun yellow or orange color. Stir with a fork or whisk until the whole mix is the same color and looks smooth.",
      "Add all of the grated cheese to the mix, in a couple of additions letting most of the cheese melt before adding in more. You can bump up the heat a little bit here to get this going. If the mixture is exceedingly thick, like difficult to stir, add a little bit of warm tap water and stir. You want this mix to be fairly thick, coating the back of a spoon, but just loose enough to be able to be poured in a single stream. It's not essential to get this perfectly one way, so whatever you come out with will definitely work.",
      "Taste and adjust seasoning; this is really important, because every squash's sweetness level is a little different, and every cheese's saltiness level is different too. Season for a balance you really like, and then add just a little bit more salt remembering that you're about to add a full pound of pasta to the mix.",
      "Add in all of the pasta, stir until the cheese sauce is coating all of the pasta, and then pour in to whatever casserole or baking dish you have that will fit this monstrous amount of mac and cheese, or split in to separate baking dishes. Literally any shape dish will work.",
      "Reduce oven temperature to 375, sprinkle the top of your dish with the reserved cheese, and bake until bubbling and crisp on top, about 35 minutes in my oven. Great right out of the oven and even better the next day! Enjoy :)"

      "Mix in 2 beaten eggs then add in the grated cheese and salt and pepper. (I sometimes also use a splash of Worcestershire sauce and a tablespoon of Dijon mustard.) Once mixed together, mix in the ground meat. (If using turkey or a lighter meat, I start with that meat first, fully incorporate the breadcrumbs, and then add in the second meat: I find I get a better distribution.)",
      "Form the meatballs. I like them slightly bigger than a golf ball. You'll have a less shaggy surface on the meatballs if your hands are damp, so I leave a little dribble of water running at the sink so I can rewet my hands and keep shaping the meatballs. Lay them out in a single layer on a tray or plate.",
      "To fry the meatballs, place an 8-quart saucepan (sometimes I prefer a nonstick or cast-iron skillet) on the stove and cover the bottom with a thin layer of olive oil. Set the heat to medium-high. Bring the oil up to temperature: It should sizzle a bit when you drop in a breadcrumb or drop of water. Fry the meatballs in batches so as not to overcrowd the pan. Alternatively, you could bake them in a 375\u00b0F oven on a sheet pan, evenly spaced, for 25 to 30 minutes until they brown.",
      "Once the meatballs are done, in the same pan, lightly brown the sausages on all sides and set aside.",
      "Make the tomato sauce: Lower heat to medium and add the onions and garlic. Once the onions start to become translucent, add 1 cup of dry white wine to deglaze (Mom would use red). At this point, remove the garlic cloves or leave them in, minced, if no one objects.",
      "Nudge the onions and garlic to the side and add the tomato paste. Saute it over medium-high heat for 2 minutes to caramelize it slightly until it deepens in color and flavor. Add the tomato puree (or crushed tomatoes). Stir to make certain nothing is sticking to the bottom of the pan. Add the bay leaves, oregano, basil, pinch of sugar, and salt and pepper. Gently, add back in the\r\ncooked meatballs and sausages.",
      "Bring to a boil, stir gently to make sure no meat is sticking to the bottom, and set to the lowest possible simmer. Leave it bubbling, occasionally giving it a gentle stir, for 2 to 3 or even 4 hours (depending on how soon you want to eat and how it tastes). This is best tested with a fresh, crusty loaf of bread nearby that can be dipped into the sauce at several inspections to see how the flavor is developing and to reward the chef.",
      "Meanwhile, prepare the pasta: Add 2 large pinches of kosher salt to 6 quarts of boiling water per pound of pasta. Add the pasta. Give a good stir so nothing sticks, and a few times while cooking. You need to pull the pasta before it is fully cooked. It will continue cooking and will absorb the sauce later. (Before draining, I always grab a coffee mug and carefully dip it into the pasta water, and set it aside in case I need to loosen up the sauce. This is almost never the case with a big pot of sauce nearby, but it is a good practice to get into.) Drain the pasta. Put it back in the pot. Add two or three ladles of the cooked tomato sauce and gently stir. You want all of the pasta to be coated, but not swimming in sauce.",

    "title": "panfried pork steamed buns (shengjian bao)",
    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "Warm the milk and oil in a pot over low heat until lukewarm but not hot. It should feel comfortable to the touch. Remove from heat and pour into a bowl. Sprinkle the yeast over top the liquid and let sit for 8-10 minutes.",
      "Sift together flour, salt, and sugar. Trickle the yeast liquid slowly into the flour, mixing with a spatula or chopsticks as you go. (You can also just alternate between pouring and stirring.) Once all the liquid has been poured in, knead for 10-15 seconds until dough comes together.",
      "Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead again until smooth, at least 4-5 minutes. Place the dough in a large, greased bowl, cover, and let sit for 1-2 hours, or until doubled in size. I prefer a slower, cooler rise, but you can do whatever you're used to",
      "When the dough is almost done with its rise, mix together the ingredients for the filling (pork, vegetable, sugar, soy sauce, sesame oil, rice wine, ginger, green onion, garlic, and cornstarch) until well-incorporated. (Note: Regular cabbage or Brussels sprouts are fine to add as is; if using Napa cabbage, you'll need to extract the water first. Sprinkle about a teaspoon of salt over the cabbage and let sit for 10 minutes beforehand, then drain the water that is released and squeeze out any more moisture. This will prevent the bun from getting soggy.)",
      "Next, punch down the risen dough. Turn onto a floured surface again and knead for just a few strokes. If the dough is too sticky, add more flour. Pinch or cut off a ping-pong ball size piece of dough and roll into a flat circle of dough about 3 inches in diameter. Place about a tablespoon of the pork mixture into the circle and fold the dough up around the filling, pinching and pleating in a concentric circle until the top is sealed. It doesn't have to be perfect -- you can always place it seam-side down for a smooth and uniform top. As you can see, I'm far from a pleating expert! For easier pleating, you can try rolling the edges of the dough circle thinner, leaving the center thicker.",
      "Place the finished buns on a baking sheet and cover with a damp towel to avoid drying out as you fold the others. You can let the buns proof again at this point if you like, but I find that the second rise is somewhat built into the process -- since pleating the buns takes some time, the buns I prepare first have usually had time to rise again by the time I've finished pleating the last ones. On top of that, you'll likely have to steam these in several batches, so that the buns you prepare last will have proofed by the time the first ones have steamed.",
      "When you're ready to steam the buns, line your basket or steaming tray with a circle of parchment paper. Place the folded buns at least two to three inches apart inside the tray. They will expand significantly, so give them room. I only steamed about three or four per tray.",
      "Fill a wok (or pot, or rice cooker, depending on what you're using) with about an inch or two of water and bring the water to a simmer over medium heat.",
      "After",
      "the water has begun to simmer, set the basket over the water, covered, and steam for about 15 minutes, or until buns are resilient when touched and filling inside is cooked. Make sure to refill the water between batches, as it will likely boil dry. You may also need to adjust the heat to low as the water boils -- a low simmer is all you need.",
      "To fry:",
      "Pour a generous amount of oil into a large wok or saucepan -- enough for at least a quarter-inch layer of oil in the bottom. Turn the heat to medium and wait a few minutes to let the oil heat up. Turning the heat down to medium-low or low, place the buns in a single layer in the wok and let sizzle for 2-3 minutes, or until golden brown. If it's sizzling too violently, turn the heat down or off for a minute or two until it calms down, and keep a close eye on the bottoms of the buns. I like to keep the heat lower because it doesn't matter if the buns take a bit longer to fry up, but it's a bummer if they burn! Remove from the pan when browned on the bottom and drain on paper towels. Let cool slightly, then eat while still crisp and warm.",
      "Optional:",
      "Serve with extra chopped scallions sprinkled over top and dipping sauce on the side. My favorite is a simple sauce made from 1 part soy sauce 1 part chili garlic sauce, but you can use whatever you like best. I sometimes add Chinese black vinegar and a touch of sugar, too."

The next day, drain the soaked chickpeas and place them in a saucepan, cover with fresh water, add a bay leaf and simmer for a couple of hours or until the chickpeas are soft. Add salt to taste at the end. Don't throw away the cooking liquid - this is gold and you'll need it for the sauce. If using canned chickpeas, skip to next step.",

When the garlic begins to get fragrant and soften, perhaps even slightly colour, add the tomato and let sizzle for a few minutes.",

Ladle into shallow bowls, pour over your very best extra virgin olive oil, more freshly ground pepper and then let it sit for a moment or two before serving as it will be piping hot and it needs to cool a little to be best enjoyed. Grated Parmesan or Pecorino cheese is entirely optional. Serve this pasta dish with a spoon."

      "Nestle the pieces of pork back into the pan. Add the soy sauce, wine, vinegar, water/stock, and sesame oil, and stir to distribute. Add in additional water or chicken stock as necessary to bring the liquid level to about halfway up the pieces of pork (it's fine if there's a bit more than that). Bring the liquid to a boil, then reduce heat to a gentle-to-moderate simmer and cover the pot.",
      "Braise the pork until very tender, about 2 hours.",
      "While the pork is braising, make the kale slaw. In a large bowl, combine the miso, lemon juice, vinegar, olive and sesame oils, and pepper to make a thick dressing. Toss in the kale, apple, and carrots, and mix continuously for a couple of minutes to coat the kale very well. Make it at least an hour or two before serving. Store in the refrigerator.",
      "When the pork is fork-tender and falling apart, remove it from the pan and onto a large plate. Remove any unwanted hunks of fat still remaining, and shred the meat with two forks (or your fingers if the meat is cool enough). Skim the fat from the pan and discard. Also discard the star anise pod. Reduce the sauce over medium-low heat to about 1/2 cup (if there is more than that).",

      "Sorry, don't really have pictures of food. If I get a chance, I'll take one this week.\r\n\r\nThe idea of brining beans comes from Cook's Illustrated and is a good one. Put the beans in the water, add the first measure of salt and let sit at least 8 hours and up to 24. Drain them in a colander. The rest of this recipe works best in a cast iron Dutch oven but you can use pretty much anything large enough and it will be fine. You do need a lid for it.",
      "In a bit of oil, brown your favorite meat. I prefer salt pork but the others are good too. Use as much as you like but saltier or more strongly flavored meats err toward the low end of the range your first time.",
      "Remove the meat with a slotted spoon and in the fat cook the onions and peppers until translucent. Then add the garlic for about 30 seconds.",
      "Return the meat, add the beans, cover the beans with water. About 6 cups should do but use your judgment or you can use half water and half chicken broth. You can always add more if it gets too low. Don't let the beans be uncovered or they'll explode.",
      "Slap on a lid and reduce heat to a simmer. Now you're gonna pilot by eye. The beans are done when they look like beans and that varies considerably depending on the time of year, your altitude and the hardness of your water. Count on at least one hour, maybe more than two. They are done when (a) you taste one and it offers no resistance to your bite; and (b) they have exuded much of their protein into the surrounding liquid so that it is basically the same color as the beans, has the viscosity of gravy, and has acquired a rich, creamy taste. Somewhere along in here you can grind in black pepper and add salt until it tastes ok.",
      "You can mess with this recipe a lot. Bell peppers are good. So are diced tomatoes. But always remember two things. (1) Paul's Iron Law of Garlic: if it said two cloves, it probably meant three (I already corrected upward here). And (2), the old Southern truism: beans are always better on the second day. So make enough for leftovers. You can add a teaspoon of oregano or summer savory with the garlic if you want. You can substitute some of the water for an equal quantity of beer (that seems to make mine take longer to cook). I like Guinness but your mileage may vary. Negra Modelo is good too. You could add some cumin if you had to but I wouldn't. Then you're half way to chili and you might as well go the rest of the way. This is beans, not chili. If you take it to all the way to chili, some Texas dimwit is bound to show up and yell at you about beans.\r\n\r\nThis recipe works beautifully in a slow cooker. After all, a slow cooker is just a bean crock on a hot plate.",
      "Yes, no sugar. Sugar is an abomination in the eyes of the Lord. Corn is plenty sweet, why you want to go add sugar to it? Trust me on this. This is CORN bread people! You don't need sugar. You sure don't need any flour. Then what you'd have is a giant corn flavored biscuit and that's nasty. Yellow corn meal is sweeter and cornier than white, that's why.",
      "Before you do anything else, put the oil in the skillet and the skillet in the oven and preheat to 400. You want your skillet blazing hot. The old country way would be lard rather than oil but I won't force you to do that. DO NOT use olive oil, it will set fire to your oven and, as we say around here, burn slap up.",
      "Mix the first four (dry) ingredients in a medium size bowl with a whisk. Beat the tar out of the egg and add it to the buttermilk.",
      "When your skillet is hot, add the buttermilk/egg mixture to the corn meal and stir until combined.",
      "From here on out, you're flying by eye again. How much liquid you add depends on the humidity but 1 3/4 cups is a bare minimum. You have to judge if it looks like cornbread. In the mixing bowl, it looks like cornbread if it looks like quicksand. Basically, you want something that will be pretty much self leveling when you put it in the skillet. Use your judgment and don't stress if it isn't exactly right. Cornbread forgives everything except sugar.",
      "Add the batter to the skillet and admire the sizzle. This is why cast iron. You're frying the bottom! Put it back in the oven and cook until it looks like cornbread. This will take 25 minutes or more. It looks like cornbread when (a) it is no longer damp in the middle, and (b) it has pulled away from the sides of the skillet.",
      "Invert your skillet onto a serving platter. Cornbread should fall right out if your skillet is well seasoned and the cornbread is done. Slice it into 8 wedges. Now your crunchy crust is on the top!",
      "Crumble a wedge into a bowl, spoon beans on the top, and put it in your mouth. You can also slice a wedge down the middle and have it with butter. Ok, you can garnish with chopped onions, sour cream, or grated cheddar if you must.",
      "My grandmother never used an egg but mine won't hang together without one. On the other hand, she always mixed a tablespoon of hot oil into the batter before putting it in the skillet. I can't tell that does anything but you can try and see if you like it. For a little extra crunch in the crust, you can sprinkle some loose cornmeal into the hot skillet just before dumping the batter in. Sometimes I do that, sometimes not. Lots of people mix in corn kernels or creamed corn. To me that just gets in the way of the bread and screws up my liquid measurements. My dad always liked it crumbled in a glass with buttermilk poured over, and he'd eat it with a spoon.",
      "Make two of these and you have arrived at the starting point for cornbread dressing, which is the only thing that makes Christmas worth fooling with any more. But that's another story."

      "Tempering chocolate is a process of heating, cooling, and stirring chocolate. The heating melts the chocolate and breaks down its crystal structure. The cooling and stirring makes sure that the right crystals (the beta crystals) become dominant so that your chocolate for this recipe will harden and remain hard, have a nice shine, and will not develop gray streaks when left out at room temperature. \r\n\r\nThere are specific temperature marks you need to work within. You want to melt the dark chocolate at 100? - 115?. Then you want to cool the dark chocolate to 88? - 91?.",
      "STEP 1 - Break the chocolate into small pieces and place 3/4 of the chocolate into a microwave safe plastic bowl. Place the remaining 1/4 of the chocolate aside in a separate bowl.",
      "STEP 2 - Heat the chocolate for 1 minute.",
      "STEP 3 - Remove the chocolate and stir. You will notice that when you first remove the chocolate from the microwave it retains its shape. Once you start stirring you will discover that the chocolate has indeed started to melt.",
      "STEP 4 - If the chocolate is not completely melted, return the chocolate to the microwave and heat for 20 seconds. Remove and stir.\r\n\r\nOnce all the chocolate is melted, take the temperature of the chocolate. It should be somewhere around 100? - 115?. Don't be alarmed if it is a bit higher or lower.",
      "STEP 5 - You are now going to cool the chocolate. To do this you will add the small bowl of chocolate pieces you put aside to the melted chocolate in three batches. This is called \"seeding.\" After you add each batch stir the chocolate until all the chocolate is melted. Be patient. The chocolate will melt if you continue stirring the chocolate.",
      "STEP 6 - After you add each batch, take the temperature of the chocolate. The chocolate is ready when it is between 88? - 91?. \r\n\r\nBecause chocolate is impacted by ambient room temperature, your chocolate can cool faster one day than another. Some days you will need to add all four batches to cool the chocolate. Other times the chocolate will be cool by the second or third batch of seeding. If it is a really warm day, the chocolate may not be cool enough even after you add the fourth batch. If this should happen, place the bowl of chocolate in the refrigerator for 3 minutes. After 3 minutes remove the bowl and stir. Then take the temperature again. Repeat this process until the temperature is down to between 88? - 91?.",
      "Now that the chocolate is tempered you are ready to make the chocolates. Pour the nuts and dried fruit into the bowl of tempered chocolate. Mix with a spoon.",
      "Spoon small amounts of the mixture onto a tray or cookie sheet covered in baking paper. You should have enough to make 15 rocks.",
      "Place the tray of chocolate in the refrigerator for 30 minutes. You can leave the chocolate in the refrigerator for up to 24 hours.",
      "AVOID ODORS IN THE REFRIGERATOR: Chocolate is notorious for absorbing odors. Make sure your refrigerator is odor free before you use it to cool your chocolate. You don't want your chocolate to smell like last night's dinner.",
      "SHELF LIFE: Your chocolates should stay good for 2 months. However good chocolate does best when stored in a cool and dry place. Extreme variations in temperature will cause gray streaks to form."

Uncover and continue to cook for another 6 to 7minutes, or until the mixture begins to vigorously bubble and rise in the pan. (If you have a candy thermometer, clip it to the side when you uncover the pan and cook the mixture to 240\u00b0 F.) Immediately remove from heat.",
      "Attach the whisk attachment to your mixer and turn on low speed. Slowly pour the hot sugar syrup down the side of the mixing bowl into the gelatin mixture. Once you've added all the syrup, increase the speed to high and whip until the mixture is lukewarm, approximately 12 to 15 minutes. (If you haven't cooked the sugar to exactly 240\u00b0 F this may take a few minutes longer. You can tell that it's cool enough of the fluff doesn't easily slip away from the whisk when the mixer head is lifted.) Add the vanilla extract in the last minute of whipping.",
      "While the mixture is whipping, combine the confectioners sugar and cornstarch in a bowl. Lightly grease a 9- x 13-inch baking pan, add the sugar-cornstarch mixture to the pan, and shake it all around to coat the pan, then return the excess to the bowl.",

Transfer squares to the baking sheet, leaving and inch of space between each. Poke several holes in each one to keep them from puffing up too much during baking. Place the crackers in the fridge to chill for at least 30 minutes.",
      "Once the crackers are chilled, preheat the oven to 350\u00b0 F. Bake for 12 to 14 minutes, or until the crackers are mostly bake, but still a tiny bit soft (they will firm up as they cool).",
      "Remove the pans from the oven and set on cooling racks. Immediately place a marshmallow on top of each cracker. (The heat from the crackers will melt the marshmallow slightly and bind the two together.) Let cool completely.",

Use a fork to remove the mallomar, allowing any excess chocolate to drip off, and place cracker side-down on a piece of wax paper. Let cool until chocolate has set.",

      "Preheat oven to 375\u00b0 Fahrenheit ( 200 degree Celsius).\r\n\r\nTo make the dough by hand, put the flour on a flat surface and make a bowl in the middle for the egg, sugar, vanilla, lemon zest, and salt. Cut the butter into 1/2 inch small pieces and place on top of the mound of flour. Think of a volcano with some butter on the ridge and a hole in the middle. Starting from the outside, mix the ingredients into a ball. Use the palm of your hand to smear some of the butter. DO NOT OVER MIX. It is okay to have some pieces of butter left in the dough. Flatten the dough and make two disks, one a little bit larger than the other, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1/2 hour or overnight. The bottom piece needs more dough to build up the sides of the pan.",
      "In the meantime , peel and core the apples and thinly slice them. Sprinkle the lemon juice over the apples.",
      "To roll out the dough, cut out four 14-inch square pieces of plastic wrap or parchment paper. Put two pieces of plastic wrap on baking surface, sprinkle flour on the plastic wrap . Put the dough in the center and cover with the two other plastic wrap pieces and roll the disk into a 9-inch circle about 1/8-inch thick. Roll from the center. If the dough starts to stick, peel off the plastic wrap and put it back on, continuing to roll out the disk. Roll from both sides by flipping the dough over. This will prevent the dough from sticking to the wrap. Remove one sheet of plastic wrap and invert the dough into a 9 inch cake pan with a removable bottom Then remove the remaining plastic wrap. Press the dough into the pan and up on the sides, cutting off any dough overhang. Use the dough scraps to patch any cracks.",
      "Mix the sugar and the cinnamon in a bowl and set aside. \r\nSprinkle the bottom of the dough with breadcrumbs, mix the apples with the raisins and the almonds, add to the cake, don't add the juices that have accumulated in the bowl. Sprinkle with the sugar cinnamon mixture. Roll out the second disk of dough and cover the apple filling with it. Make a cross slit in the center of the cake and put the cake on a cookie sheet (to catch any drippings).",
      "Bake in the middle of the oven for about 45 minutes until the dough is lightly colored.",
      "To make the glaze, mix the powdered sugar and lemon juice to make a smooth glaze. Add some more powdered sugar if the glaze is too thin.",
      "As soon as you take the cake out of the oven, remove the outer ring of the tart form. Cool slightly and spread the glaze evenly over the cake."

      "For the lamb: Heat your oven to full whack (450 to 500 degrees F). Slash the fat side of the lamb all over with a sharp knife. Lay half the sprigs of rosemary and half the garlic cloves on the bottom of a high-sided roasting pan, rub the lamb all over with olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Place it in the pan on top of the rosemary and garlic, and put the rest of the rosemary and garlic on top of the lamb. Tightly cover the tray with aluminum foil and place in the oven. Turn the oven down immediately to 325 degrees F and cook for about 4 hours - it's done if you can pull the meat apart easily with 2 forks. If it's tender but not brown as you'd like, uncover and briefly turn up the heat again at the end, till it has a nice brown crust.",
      "For the smashed veg: When the lamb is nearly cooked, put the potatoes, carrots and rutabaga into a large pot of boiling salted water and boil hard for 20 minutes or so until you can slide a knife into the rutabaga easily. Drain and allow to steam dry, then smash them up in the pan with most of the butter. If you prefer a smooth texture, add some cooking water. Spoon into a bowl, cover with foil and keep warm over a pan of simmering water.",
      "For the sauce and greens: Remove the lamb from the oven and place it on a chopping board. Cover it with foil, then a kitchen towel, and leave it to rest. Put a large pan of salted water on to boil for the greens. Pour away most of the fat from the roasting pan, discarding any bits of rosemary. Put the pan on the stovetop over medium heat and mix in the flour. Add the stock, stirring and scraping all the sticky goodness off the bottom of the pan. You won't need gallons of gravy, just a couple of flavorsome spoonfuls for each serving. Add the capers, turn the heat down and simmer for a few minutes. Finely chop the mint and add it to the sauce with the red wine vinegar at the last minute then pour into a pitcher.",
      "Add the greens and stalks to the pan of fast-boiling salted water and cook for 4 to 5 minutes to just soften them. Drain and toss with a knob of butter and a pinch of salt and pepper.",

Over medium heat, cook the oil and flour till golden, add two cups of chicken stock, bring to a boil, and you have gravy! My mom always called this \"crackling\" gravy, as it utilized the cracklins from frying your chicken. I served ours with Yukon gold mashers and fresh, local, steamed green beans. Since the chicken is skinless and semi-fried, it's a healthier option when you have that craving. All things in moderation my friends."

Go ahead and arrange the melon slices on a platter or 4 plates. Set the melon plates aside. Thinly slice the cucumber into round discs. Place the cucumber slices in a bowl. Toss the cucumbers with a splash of olive oil a pinch of salt. Set the bowl aside. Have your hearts of palm ready. Slice the scallions.",

Place the shrimp on the grill and cook, turning once, for about 4 minutes. The shrimp should be firm and pink when cooked through.",

Cook until the beans are soft to the bite, which will happen when their colors mellow, with the brown lightening and the white turning more beige. The cooking time will depend on the dryness of the beans. In my slow cooker, my beans were tender after 4 hours. When they are soft, salt them generously.",

When you are done, create a ball and let the dough rest for at least 30 minutes, covered.",
