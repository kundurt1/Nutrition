      "Reduce the heat to moderately low and add the paprika, flour, and cayenne to the pan. Cook, stirring, for 30 seconds. Stir in the broth, tomatoes, the remaining 1 1/4 teaspoons salt, the thyme, and the bay leaf. Add the chicken and bring to a simmer. Reduce the heat and simmer, partially covered, until the chicken is done, about 20 minutes. Remove the bay leaf and add the parsley and black pepper.",
      "Menu Suggestions: Serve the goulash with spaetzle, buttered noodles, or boiled or mashed potatoes.",
      "Wine Recommendation: With this dish, it's natural to experiment with one of the increasing number of reds imported from Hungary. Try Egri Bikaver or a varietal such as a merlot or a cabernet sauvignon."

Discard lumps of fat from butterflied turkey. Rinse turkey and set breast-down in pot. If needed, add more cold water so turkey is just covered. Chill, covered, 12 to 16 hours.",

      "Meanwhile, prepare grill for indirect medium-high heat (400\u00b0 to 450\u00b0). You'll cook the turkey over a cooler area, and over a pan of water, to cook the turkey very evenly--and so its dripping juices won't cause flare-ups. If using gas: Remove cooking grates. Turn all burners to high, close lid, and heat 10 minutes. Turn off center burner(s) and reduce heat for others to medium-high. Set a 12- by 18-in. foil roasting pan on turned-off burner and add 1 qt. hot tap water. Oil cooking grates and set in place (if drip pan sticks up, push down on grates to flatten pan a bit). If using charcoal: Ignite a full chimney of briquets (about 90) on firegrate. When coals are dotted with ash, in 20 minutes, bank evenly on opposite sides of firegrate and if needed, let burn to medium-high. (Be ready to add turkey as soon as fire is 450\u00b0 to 475\u00b0.) Set a 12- by 18-in. foil roasting pan between coals and add 1 qt. hot tap water. Oil cooking grate and set in place.",

Insert a digital wand-style thermometer (such as Polder) through thickest part of breast to the bone (testing the temperature at the bone, where it's coolest, gives the most consistent reading). Position the readout near the grill. If using charcoal: Beginning 15 minutes into cooking, add 5 briquets to each mound of coals every 30 minutes. Also occasionally clear ash with metal sweeper beneath grill. If temp drops to 375\u00b0, increase briquets to 8 to 10 on each side and leave grill uncovered a minute or two to ignite.",

Ask a butcher to butterfly turkey, or see How to Butterfly a Turkey, below; save backbone, neck, tail, and giblets (except liver) for gravy. After grilling, turkey temperature will rise 5 to 8 degrees as it rests.",

      "A butterflied turkey (meaning, one with the backbone removed and the turkey flattened like an open book) cooks evenly and quickly. For grilling, choose a 12- to 14-lb. turkey, which is small enough to fit within the indirect heat area and will serve 10 to 12 people.",
      "Set turkey breast down in a clean sink (you have more leverage at this level rather than on a counter). Remove any plastic or metal turkey truss and discard. With poultry shears**, cut along both sides of backbone and remove it; save for gravy. Cut off tail and loose skin and save for gravy.",

      "Equipment Notes: For brining, you'll need a 12-qt. or larger stockpot (or a smaller pot and a brining bag). You'll also need a 12- by 18-in. foil roasting pan. Lastly, consider getting an inexpensive cable-style thermometer (such as Polder); it will let you track the bird's temperature without uncovering the grill and losing heat. We went for classic Thanksgiving flavors here in the rub, but feel free to try a variation,",

Using a sharp knife, cut down the length of the ear to the base; cut through the kernels, being careful not to cut into the tough cob. Rotate ear, and repeat procedure until all kernels are removed from ear. Scrape cob to remove any remaining pulp.",

Porterhouse steaks have more tenderloin and T-bones have a larger strip loin section. Choose according to your preference.",

Made from the nebbiolo grape, these wines develop fabulously complex dried cherry, eucalyptus, floral, and truffle flavors along with a silky texture. Both have power to spare, but Barbaresco is more elegant."

The heat cooks the thin layer of white just inside the shell, separating it from the thick white around the yolk. Don't worry if the shells crack. You can poach the eggs at once, or chill them up to two days. Best of all, when you poach these eggs side by side, they don't stick together.",
      "To poach fill pan with enough water to cover an egg out of the shell by at least 1 inch. A 12-inch frying pan holds as many as 10 large eggs. Set pan over high heat just until one or two bubbles break the surface of the water. Then reduce heat so bubbles that form on pan bottom only pop to the surface occasionally. An active boil toughens and breaks up the eggs.",

As the eggs are cooked, lift them from the water with a slotted spoon. Serve, or if making ahead, immerse in ice water, cover, and chill up to two days.",
