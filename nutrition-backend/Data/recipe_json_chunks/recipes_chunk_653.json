Add the green peppers and saut, stirring occasionally until soft, about 5 minutes more. Stir in white wine, scraping up any browned bits on the bottom of the pan. Return the shanks to the pan. Add the tomatoes, rosemary, salt, pepper and stock. Cover, reduce heat to low and simmer, turning and basting the shanks occasionally with pan juices, until tender, 1 1/2 hours. Skim excess fat. Add the orzo; cover and simmer until tender, 10 minutes. Stir in all but 2 tablespoons of the parsley and sprinkle the remainder on top. Serves 4."
