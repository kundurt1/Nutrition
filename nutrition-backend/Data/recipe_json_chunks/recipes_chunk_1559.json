      "5. With a few minutes left in the baking time, melt the chocolate. Put the chocolate chips in a microwave-safe bowl and microwave it for 60 seconds. Check the progress of the chocolate. If you can still see whole morsels, continue microwaving at 15-second increments. Keep microwaving until most of the chips are partially melted and soft. Stir the chocolate together until it turns into a fairly runny sauce.",

      "7. Spoon the batter into the prepared muffin tin, filling each well only about 1/2 of the way full.",

A good quality red wine vinegar will also work well in this dish.",

Pat the mixture evenly into the bottom of the pan and up the sides. As you continue to press the crumbs, the mixture will become almost like a dough. Press evenly around the pan, using a squared off mixing cup to get a nice even crust. Bake for 5-8 minutes in the middle of preheated oven, just until lightly brown. The crust will darken slightly as it cools. Remove carefully to a wire rack. Cool completely.",

Remove the sausage with a slotted spoon and set aside.",

Once you smell the garlic, add the sausage back in, along with the marinara sauce. Keep in mind that you could used crushed tomatoes if you want, but I did not have that on hand. So I used marinara which worked out just as well.",
      "Give a good stir, let the sauce come to a simmer, then crack in the eggs. Cover, and cook until the egg whites have set but you still have a warm yolk, about 8 minutes.",

But then you have this great warmth from the Moroccan spice and harissa paste. All that paired with the creaminess of the egg yolks, and texture of the cooked sausage, well, I say no more.

Make sure the dry ingredients are completely dissolved. Have the beaten egg yolk ready to go in a small bowl next to the stove before proceeding. Pour the milk mixture into a small sauce pan, and turn the heat to medium. Stir the mixture constantly with a wooden spoon. When the mixture thickens and starts to bubble a bit, turn off the heat. Add a few spoonfuls of the hot custard to the beaten egg yolk, whisking vigorously. Add a few more spoonfuls and continue to stir. Now, pour the egg and custard mixture back into the saucepan. Turn the heat back on to medium and whisk for about 3 minutes, until thickened. Turn off the heat, then whisk in the peanut butter and vanilla. Whisk this mixture very well, or else the oil in the peanut butter will separate when the pie cools. Pour the mixture into the crust. You will probably have a few spoonfuls of extra filling, but this is due to the fact that I do not like to scrape the bottom of the pan after making pudding or custard because that's where the lumps (if any) can be found. Press plastic wrap directly on the surface, then chill the pie for at least 4 hours before serving. Top with whipped cream and extra chopped peanuts if desired."

The favorite ones I've made so far were made with all dark chocolate. If you want a super glossy and smooth finish, feel free to temper your chocolate, but tempering isn't necessary for flavor-it's purely aesthetic.",
      "- For the peppermint extract: Make sure you have peppermint extract, not \"mint\" extract which is actually a combo of peppermint and spearmint. \"Mint\" extract is what I had on hand originally, and while still delicious, the cookies had a slight toothpaste flavor due to the spearmint. Curbed my Thin Mint craving, but we ended up tossing the last few.",

Then using the foil or paper as handles, carefully lift the cake out of the tin, place it on a rack and peel back the paper from the sides. Let the cake cool completely before icing.",
      "For the icing:",
      "Sift the icing sugar into a small bowl to get rid of any lumps. Whisk in the lemon juice and vanilla extract and keep whisking until it has all been absorbed. If resulting paste is too thick, add the milk and whisk it in. The icing should be thick enough stay put yet spreadable. Pour onto the middle of the cake and spread it out as evenly as possible. Sprinkle the zest over the top and leave it to set for at least 10 minutes before slicing.",
      "I find that the best way to slice these sort of bakes is as follows: Using a long sharp knife slice the bake in half. Then slice each half into two equal slices so you now have 4 long equal slices. Spin the paper a quarter turn and do the same again-slice in half and then slice each half in two. You should have 16 fairly equal squares.",
      "Note: You can substitute oranges or limes for the lemons. You can double up the recipe to make in a larger 9x13 pan.",

      "3. In a small bowl, microwave the Greek yogurt for 10-15 seconds, just until slightly warmed. If you add cold Greek yogurt right into the mixture, the coconut oil solidifies, leaving you with a chunky cake.",
      "4. In a large bowl, using an electric hand mixer, beat together the eggs, coconut oil, Greek yogurt, vanilla extract and brown sugar until light and fluffy.",
      "5. Stir in the coconut flour mixture, and then beat it to make sure that the lumps are completely gone.",
      "6. Stir in the grated carrots until all the carrots are mixed in and coated in the batter.",
      "7. Pour the batter into the prepared pan and let it stand for 5 minutes before baking.",
      "8. Bake for 20-30 minutes or until the top is lightly golden and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Remove pan from oven and set it on a rack.",
      "9. Let it cool completely.",
      "10. Spray a 10 inch pie plate with cooking spray and set aside.",
      "11. In a large bowl, beat together the softened cream cheese, sugar, lemon juice and vanilla until soft and fluffy.",
      "12. Beat in the whipped topping.",
      "13. Cut the edges off the carrot cake and set them aside. Break up the remaining cake into large chunks**.",
      "14. Drop the cake chunks all over the bottom of the prepared 10-inch pie plate, leaving gaps between each piece.",
      "15. Pour the cheesecake filling over the top and gently smooth over to cover the carrot cake pieces.",
      "16. Sprinkle with the coconut flakes and place the toasted pecans along the outside edge.",
      "17. Cover the top with tin foil and place in the freezer for at least 4 hours.",
      "18. To serve: Remove it from the freezer. Let it thaw for about 5 minutes and then cut. It is easiest to cut and get out of the pan when the cheesecake is still quite frozen.",
      "19. Let the slices thaw an additional 5 minutes once cut and plated, then devour.",
      "Notes:",
      "- I also had success using coconut sugar instead of brown sugar, although most people slightly preferred the taste of the brown sugar version. Note that coconut sugar makes baked goods turn very dark brown, and it is wise to cover the top of the cake with parchment paper for the last 10 minutes of baking.",
      "- I only used about 3/4 of the remaining carrot cake, after the edges were cut off. It's up to you depending on the ratio of carrot cake to cheesecake that you want! If you have leftover chunks, they make a great snack!",

      "2. Cut the top off the heads of garlic to expose the top of the cloves. Place each head individually on a square of aluminum foil, drizzle with a little olive oil, and pinch the foil closed so it encases the head of garlic. Place these on a cooler part of the grill and forget about them, or alternatively, place in a 400 degree oven for about an hour.",
      "3. Grill the potato slices over medium heat until both sides have nice and dark grill marks, and a deep golden color. The longer these grill, the stronger grill flavor the final dish will have. I even let some of my slices get a little charred because I'm into that sort of thing.",
      "4. Once the slices are grilled, get a big sheet of aluminum foil, dump all the potatoes in the center, pour in 1/4 cup of the red wine, and pinch up the ends so you have a big enclosed bundle. Let this sit on the grill on low heat with the cover down. This will let the potatoes cook until they reach mashability and infuse them with a rich wine flavor.",
      "5. Don't forget to check on your garlic! It's ready to come off the grill when it's soft to the touch. This for me happened to be the same amount of time it took to cook the potatoes.",
      "6. When the potatoes are fork tender, place them in a bowl, and while still warm, add 2 Tablespoons of butter, and the yogurt and buttermilk. With a potato masher, pulverize the mixture! The potatoes may have developed a bit of a crispy crust from the grilling, so initially it takes a little muscle to get the ball rolling, but don't worry, it gets easier once you break that crust down. Mash until it's the consistency you like. It'll need more liquid than regular mashed potatoes because so much has cooked out during the grilling process. I just kept adding buttermilk until it was creamy enough for my liking. Add a little more salt and pepper to taste, as well as the roasted garlic. You can either tediously peel each clove, or just squeeze at the bottom until it squirts out like a tube of toothpaste.",
      "For the sauce:",
      "1. Heat a large skillet over low heat with 1 Tablespoon of olive oil. Add the onions and cook low and slow until they fully caramelize and reach a rich, golden brown color, about 45 minutes to an hour.",
      "2. Once the onions are to your liking, increase the heat to medium and add the mushrooms and a pinch of salt and pepper. Cook the mixture until the mushrooms give off their water and cook down, about 10 minutes.",
      "3. Clear a little spot in the pan and add the remaining 2 Tablespoons of butter. When it has melted add the flour, and stir to combine into a paste. Let this cook for a minute or two to cook off the raw flour taste, then deglaze the pan with the remaining 1 cup of red wine and stir into the mushroom/onion side of the pan. After a couple of minutes when most of the wine has cooked down, add the chicken stock and balsamic vinegar, and let the mixture simmer until a nice, thick sauce forms.",
      "4. Serve this over your grilled mashed potatoes, top with some fresh parsley, and enjoy!"

Then slice each half into two equal slices so you now have 4 long equal slices. Spin the paper a quarter turn and do the same again-slice in half and then slice each half in two. You should have 16 fairly equal squares.",

      "10. Pop the tray into the oven and let the cookies bake for about 8-10 minutes. The time will vary depending on the thickness of the cookies so check in between while baking the first batch. The cookies will turn a little brownish on the bottom and a light brown on the top.",
      "11. Remove from the oven and transfer cookies to a cooling tray. Repeat the process with the entire batch of cookie dough. Let the cookies cool down completely. The cookies will appear soft and fragile when they just come out of the oven but as they cool down, they will get crunchy and firm up nicely."

    "title": "brownie-bottomed ice cream cake with fudge sauce",
    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "I made my cake with an 8 1/2\" springform pan, but anything from 8\"-10\" should work fine, the larger pans will just yield a slightly thinner cake, and have shorter cooking time for the brownies. I chose an 8X8\" Ghirardelli brownie mix in the \"caramel turtle\" flavor, meaning that it already contained walnuts, and came with a caramel topping packet. I threw in a few handfuls of chocolate chips (as the optional add-in).",
      "**Keep in mind that an 8\" square pan (which any 8X8\" mix is intended for) has a larger capacity than an 8\" round pan, so the brownies will be thicker using an 8\" springform pan, and thus will take longer to cook than the time stated on the box. The best way to tell if they are done is to watch, and insert a toothpick in when you think it's done (it's done when the toothpick comes out clean).",
      "BROWNIE BOTTOM BAKING:",
      "1. Make the mix according to the instructions on the box, using the required ingredients specified with your mix (typically water, eggs and oil). Add additional mix-ins to your batter as desired. This depends on the brownie variety you choose to buy. I added about 6 ounces of semi-sweet chips to mine, and swirled the caramel packet on top.",
      "2. Bake the brownies according to your package instructions, keeping in mind the size of your pan. Mine took about 40 minutes to bake in an 8 1/2\" springform. Personally, I never mind undercooked brownies, because they are fudge-like. When in doubt, pull them out - you don't want to over-bake. Besides, the brownies are going to be frozen, which will firm them up even if they are slightly underdone. It's all good.",
      "3. When the brownies come out, cool them completely. For me, this meant 30 minutes at room temperature, 30 minutes in the fridge, and about an hour in the freezer.",
      "ICE CREAM LAYER ASSEMBLY:",
      "4. When the brownies have been in the freezer for about 30 minutes, this is a good time to start thinking about thawing the ice cream. If it isn't soft enough by the time the brownies have been in the freezer an hour, that's fine. The brownies can stay in the freezer longer until the ice cream is spreadable (but not melted).",
      "5. As an option (although I can't really see anyone opting out of this unless your ice cream flavor just does not go with Oreos), sprinkle a layer of Oreo crumbs on top of the brownies before you layer on the ice cream. If you have an ice cream flavor that you don't think will pair well with Oreos, just leave the cookies out - or use the vanilla Oreos! Or ginger snaps! You get the idea...you could also use fruit sauce and/or puree if you want.",
      "6. When the ice cream is ready, spread it out evenly over the brownie layer (and cookie layer if using cookies). Freeze the whole thing for at least an hour before putting on a topping, if not longer.",
      "7. Top with a topping of your choice. I went with a nice fudge sauce (directions below) and then Cool Whip, but there are tons of possibilities: caramel sauce, peanut butter sauce, fruit sauce, just whipped cream, etc etc.",
      "FUDGE SAUCE DIRECTIONS:",
      "8. Place evaporated milk, butter, sugar and chocolate (not the vanilla) in a saucepan.",
      "9. Bring to a low boil and cook over medium heat until thickened, about 5-10 minutes, stirring constantly. It will have an almost pudding-like consistency when it is done.",
      "10. Take off heat, add vanilla, and let cool",
      "It might seem, during cooking, that this separates a bit, but it will gel when it cools. Just make sure to give it an occasional stir while cooling.",
      "When the fudge sauce is cooled, pull your cake out of the freezer and spread it on top of your ice cream layer, and pop the whole thing in the freezer for several hours or, better yet, overnight. When you are ready to serve, you can remove it from the springform pan. You might have to fidget for a minute or two opening the latch, to loosen the cake from the sides.",
      "At this point, you can garnish with whipped cream or Cool Whip, cut, and serve! I'd recommend letting the cake come to room temperature for about 5-10 minutes to make it easier to cut.",
      "__________________________________________",
      "VARIATIONS:",
      "Don't want a brownie-bottomed ice cream cake (what's wrong with you - haha)? What about a blondie or congo bar-bottomed one? Or sugar cookie? Shortbread? Cake would work wonderfully as well - just split the batter between a 9\" springform and a 9\" round pan (or even a cupcake pan). Use the cake in the springform as the base for the ice cream cake, and you get the added bonus of some leftover cupcakes!",
      "Don't want Oreos? Any kind of cookie should work!",
      "You want to make this with a fruity ice cream like peach? Use yellow cake/sugar cookie/shortbread for the crust, Golden Oreos for the crushed cookies, peach reduction sauce and whipped cream on top.",
      "Have someone with special dietary requirements? The bottom can be made using Betty Crocker's Gluten-Free Mixes, and you can crush up some gluten-free cookies. Use lactose-free or sugar-free ice cream if need be (Breyers is an excellent brand, and their All-Natural line is also gluten-free). I'm not sure if the sauce I made can be classified as gluten-free, but there are definitely gluten- and dairy-free fudge sauce recipes online. Cool Whip is already gluten-free, and a list of whipped toppings that do not contain casein can be found online as well.",
      "This recipe is highly adaptable. So have fun with it!"

Either way, after it has doubled you can either put it into the refrigerator to use within the next two weeks or you can use part of it immediately.",

Place on a clean, lightly floured counter top. Use your hands or a rolling pin to spread the dough out as thin as you can get it. If the dough is fighting you a lot (i.e. springing back to its original form) you can let it rest for a couple minutes and tackle it again. It will stretch eventually! For the naanwiches, I stretched the naan to about the shape of a single chicken breast. That is totally unnecessary, but it made the sandwiches prettier and (I think!) easier to eat.",

Cover again and cook for an additional two minutes or until the second side is also a deep golden brown. Remove naan to a rack and repeat until you have the desired number of naans.

    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "1) Brown the pound of pork in a pan until brown on all sides. We use any kind of pork we happen to find on sale.",
      "2) Place the pork in a crockpot with 1 cup of water, and season with the teriyaki, hoisin sauce, salt, and pepper. Cook on low for about 8 hours, or on high for about 5 - 6 hours.",
      "3) While the pork is cooking, place the 1 cup of warm water in a large mixing bowl and add the package of active yeast. Add one cup of flour, then cover it with a tea towel and let stand until bubbles appear on the surface (15 - 20 minutes).",
      "4) Add the sugar and the vegetable oil to the 1/2 cup of boiling water, and mix to dissolve the sugar. Let cool until warm to the touch. Then mix the yeast mixture, the sugar/oil mixture, and the remaining flour all in a large mixing bowl.",
      "5) Mix the dough until it becomes stiff, and then place on a floured surface and knead it until it becomes nice and smooth (this takes me about 15 minutes, but I am no expert 'kneader'!)",
      "6) Coat a large bowl with the 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil and put the smooth ball of dough into the bowl. Coat the dough with the vegetable oil and then cover the bowl with a slightly damp tea towel. Allow the dough to rise for about 1 hour, or until it has doubled in size.",
      "7) When the pork is cooked through, remove from the juices in the crockpot and pull the pork apart. It should come apart very easily at this point. you can use two forks or whatever method works for you. Then add to the shredded pork about 1/4 cup of the juice from the crockpot (if pork is dry). Season with the remaining 2/3 cups of hoisin sauce until the taste is wonderful. I find I just keep seasoning and tasting the pork, without using a specific amount of the hoisin sauce. It is all about personal preference.",
      "8.) Roll the ball of dough into a large log, and then slice off pieces that are approximately 1 inch thick. Flatten each piece into a 2.5 - 3.5 inch circle, and place 1 to 2 tablespoons of the seasoned pork in the middle.",
      "9) Pinch all of the edges together over the filling to seal, and then place pinched-side down on aluminum foil. Cover with a tea towel and allow them to rise for about 1 hour. I get anywhere from 20 to 24 buns out of this recipe.",
      "10) Fill a pot with about 2 inches of water, and place a vegetable steamer on top. If you line the vegetable steamer with parchment paper, and then use a pencil to poke out the holes of the steamer, this will allow the buns to come out nicely and not stick to the pot.",
      "11) When water is boiling, place 3 or 4 buns in the steamer (do not layer them or they will stick together), and cover with a lid. Allow them to cook for 10 minutes, then remove and enjoy! Repeat with the remaining buns.",
      "Note: These freeze extremely well in a bag or a container, as long as the layers are separated by parchment paper (so they don't stick together)."
