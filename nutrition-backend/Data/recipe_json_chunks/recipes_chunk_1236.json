QUICK OPTION: In a 1.5 cup or larger microwave safe container, combine oats, milk and vanilla and microwave on high for 1 minute to soften the oats.",
      "Combine dry ingredients in a small bowl and blend together with a wire whisk.",
      "Mash the overripe banana (more brown than yellow) in a medium bowl with a fork until it is almost like a liquid with very few small clumps and make sure it measures at least a 1/2 cup (a little more is okay). Add 2 egg whites (or 1 egg) and the softened oats mixture and whisk with the fork until well blended. (If the oats are hot from the microwave, stir quickly so they don't cook the eggs).",
      "Pour the dry mix on top of the banana mixture and stir with a fork until powder is mixed in completely.",
      "Divide the batter evenly into three 8 oz ramekins or large coffee mugs so each has about a 1/2 cup of batter. (Batter should never fill its container more than half full or it will bubble over while cooking). Check below for optional toppings and mix-ins you can add here.",
      "Put all 3 containers in the microwave together with at 1-2\" space in between them and microwave on high for 3 to 4 minutes or just until center is dry to the touch (see microwave tips below to determine cook time).",
      "Carefully remove containers from microwave using oven mitts. Flip over with the serving plate or your hand underneath (ready to catch) and shake muffins lightly side to side and up and down and the muffin should drop right out! Flip so it is right side up and let cool on a paper towel on top of a cooling rack (to prevent soggy bottoms).",
      "Serve warm, or store in covered containers in the fridge for up to a week (cool muffin completely before storing to prevent soggy bottoms).",
      "OPTIONAL TOPPINGS: Sprinkle uncooked muffin top with dry rolled oats, flaked coconut, sliced almonds or your favorite chopped nuts. (Since the batter has already been separated you can experiment with a different mix-in or topping for each one!).",
      "OPTIONAL MIX-INS (add a little sin back in!): Chocolate Whey Coconut - stir in 1 tsp vanilla whey protein powder and 1 tbsp of coconut per muffin and then sprinkle a little more coconut on top. Chocolate Chocolate Chip: Stir in an additional tsp of cocoa powder and 1 packet truvia (omit truvia if you already added sweetener to the main mix) and then sprinkle a rounded tsp of chocolate chips on top of the batter of each muffin (do not stir in chips, they will sink into the muffin while it bakes).",
      "ALSO TRY: A great treat is to pour about a 1/4 cup (or more) of milk over a leftover muffin from the fridge, heat in the microwave for 45 seconds and eat it with a fork like a bread pudding.",
      "MICROWAVING TIPS: After 3 minutes of baking in the microwave, the muffins should have doubled in height and should be bubbling at the center and possibly the edges. When bubbling stops and centers look dry, stop the microwave and quickly tap the center with your finger. If the batter sticks to your finger, put them back in microwave for another 15-30 seconds and then check again. Repeat until the batter is dry and doesn't stick. NOTE: Cook time will be reduced if the oats and milk were already hot from the microwave when you mixed the batter.",
      "OTHER COOKING OPTIONS: ONE AT A TIME - If you prefer to cook them 1 at a time, try 2 minutes in the microwave watching after 1.5 minutes and checking for a dry center like recommended above. BAKING IN THE OVEN - If you prefer to bake in the oven, pour batter into greased muffin pan (they will stick to paper cups) so each muffin only fills the pan 1/2-2/3 of the way so it has room to rise up while baking. Bake in a preheated oven at 350 degrees for 25-35 minutes until the center is dry to the touch."

      "Starting on the left side (the side where the Masa dough goes all the way to the edge), roll the tamale all the way to the right edge. Now, fold the top of the shuck over like an envelope and lay tamale on the counter with the fold on the under side.",
      "Repeat until all the masa dough mix and meat mix are gone.",
      "You should have about 4 dozen or more tamales.",
      "Cooking The Tamales:",
      "To cook the tamales, You need a very large pot that has something in the bottom to keep the tamales out of the water while they steam. Add about 3 pints of water to the pot, then start stacking the tamales upright until full. The envelope end of the tamale will be on the bottom, the open end of the tamale should be on top, as pictured at left. Continue to fill the pot. The tamales need to pack tight enough that they do not fall over and begin to unfold. Cover the pot, and bring the water to a boil and then reduce heat to medium low and cook for at least 2 hours. Check water several times and add more if it is getting low, you DON'T want to boil it dry. Add more water as you need to. When done, take one tamale out and leave it on the counter for about 5 minutes to test. Unwrap it and it should be firm, with no raw masa. When done, remove all the tamales and let them cool on the counter, then put in bags for the freezer, 6 to a bag. If you have one of those Vacuum sealers, those are ideal. You can save the tamales in the freezer indefinitely if they are vacuum sealed. If you use zip lock bags, they will stay for up to a year in the freezer."

In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, salt, baking powder, and baking soda. In a large bowl, cream butter and sugar together until light and fluffy. Add eggs, one at a time, beating after each addition. Beat in vanilla. Add sour cream, and beat for 30 seconds. Add flour mixture in three additions, beating to blend after each addition.

Close Panini maker and grill for about 8 minutes, or until golden brown. If you are able, grill 2 Panini's at a time. Keep Paninis in a warm in a 200 degree oven until all sandwiches are complete. Note: If you do not have a Panini maker, no worries, just toast sandwiches in a skillet over medium low heat, for about 4-5 minutes each side, or until bread is golden brown."

      "Note that the proportion of lemon segments to water to sugar is 1:1:1. So if you don't have a kitchen scale and don't weigh your lemons to begin with, as you proceed through this recipe keep in mind these proportions. Your 2 1/2 lbs of lemons should yield 6 cups of chopped lemon. 6 cups of chopped lemon will be cooked first with 6 cups of water, and then later 6 cups of sugar are added. You can also do this recipe with 4 cups of chopped lemons, 4 cups of water, and 4 cups of sugar. Do not double the recipe. Do not reduce the sugar (if you want a reduced sugar recipe, use a different recipe); the sugar is needed for the jelly to set.",
      "PREPARING THE FRUIT.",
      "Scrub the lemons clean. Discard any that are moldy or damaged.",
      "Prepare the lemons. Cut 1/4 inch off from the ends of the lemons. Working one at a time, stand a lemon on end. Cut the lemon in half lengthwise. Cut each lemon half into several segments, lengthwise. As you cut the lemons into segments, if you can, pull off any exposed membranes. Just get the ones that are easy to get to, ignore the rest. When you've cut down to the final segment, cut away the pithy core. Remove all seeds from the segments. Reserve the seeds and any removed membrane or pith. You will need them to make pectin. Cut each lemon segment crosswise into even pieces to make little triangles of lemon peel and pulp.",
      "Put all of the seeds, membranes and pith you removed from the lemons into a bag fashioned out of two layers of cheesecloth or a muslin jelly bag.",
      "FIRST STAGE OF COOKING.",
      "Place the lemon segments and water into a large, wide pot.",
      "Place the pectin bag in the pot with the fruit pulp and secure to the pot handle.",
      "Bring mixture to a medium boil on medium high heat. Let boil, uncovered, for about 25-35 minutes, until the peels are soft and cooked through. Test one of the lemon peel pieces by eating it. It should be soft. If it is still chewy, keep cooking until soft.",
      "Remove from heat.",
      "Remove the pectin bag, place the pectin bag in a bowl and let cool until it is comfortable to touch.",
      "ADD THE PECTIN AND SUGAR.",
      "Once your pectin bag has cooled to the point you can handle it, if you want, squeeze it like play-doh to extract any extra pectin. This is not necessary but will help ensure a good set. (I like to wear latex-type gloves for this part.) You should be able to get a tablespoon or two more from the bag. It has the consistency of sour cream. Return this pectin to the pan with the lemon mixture.",
      "Measure out your sugar and add it to the pan with the lemon mixture.",
      "SECOND STAGE OF COOKING.",
      "Heat the jelly mixture on medium high and bring it to a rapid boil. Secure a candy thermometer to the side of the pan. The marmalade may take anywhere from 20 to 35 minutes or so to be ready to pour out. After about 15 minutes, start checking it frequently.",
      "There are two ways to test that the marmalade is ready to pour out into jars - the mixture reaching a temperature of 220-222\u00b0F (8-10\u00b0F above the boiling point at your altitude) and a bit of it put on a chilled plate \"wrinkling up\" when you push it with your finger tip. I do both.",
      "For the wrinkle test, put several small plates into the freezer. As the jelly temperature reaches 218\u00b0F, start testing it by placing a small amount of the hot jelly on a chilled plate. If the jelly spreads out and thins immediately, it isn't ready. If it holds its shape a bit, like an egg yolk, that's a good sign. Push up against it with your finger tip. If the jelly sample wrinkles at all, it is time to take the jelly off the heat and pour it out into jars.",
      "When you use a candy thermometer to test the temperature of your mixture, make sure the probe is NOT touching the bottom of the pan. Make sure that the indentation on the probe (with modern candy thermometers this is about an inch and a half from the bottom of the probe) is actually surrounded by the mixture. This may mean that you have to tilt the pan to one side, to cover the probe sufficiently to get a good reading.",
      "CANNING.",
      "While the marmalade is in its second cooking stage, rinse out your canning jars, dry them, and place them, without lids, in a 200\u00b0F oven. They should be in the oven at least 10 minutes before using them.",
      "As the time approaches for the marmalade to be done, boil some water in a tea pot. Put the jar lids in a glass or ceramic bowl and pour the boiling water over them to sterilize.",
      "Once the jelly has reached 220\u00b0F or its \"wrinkly\" stage, remove the jelly pot from the heat. Carefully ladle the jelly into the jars, one at a time, leaving 1/4 inch head space at the top of the jars for a vacuum seal. Wipe the rim clean with a clean, wet paper towel. Place the lid on the jar, securing with a jar ring. Work quickly.",
      "Allow the jars to sit overnight. You will hear them make a popping sound as a vacuum seal is created.",
      "Even if the jelly is not firm as it goes into the jar (it shouldn't be), it should firm up as it cools."

Mix equal parts soy sauce and brown sugar to make a sweet \"slurry\", adding a pinch or two of cornstarch. While fish bakes, heat up a teaspoon of sesame oil in a large frying pan or wok, add ginger and garlic and fry 30 seconds, then add broccoli. Stirfry for 1 minute, then add snap peas, beans, and bamboo shoots. Stirfry another couple minutes until veggies are still \"al dente\". Add bok choy and soya sauce mix and stirfry one more minute.
