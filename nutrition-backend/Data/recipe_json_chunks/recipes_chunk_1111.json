Finish with the top slice of bread also slathered with the mustard mayonnaise sauce.",

Yukon gold are a good substitute in the United States. If you can find blue potatoes, give those a try too. Instead of lime or lemon juice, some cooks use bitter orange juice.",

      "Sauces: Sauces are often drizzled over a finished causa. Try mixing mayonnaise a little lemon juice, ketchup or avocado puree and drizzle it decoratively over and around the causa with a squeeze bottle. Or make Salsa Huancaina: 12 ounces feta or ricotta cheese; 5 fresh, chopped aji amarillo peppers; 1/2 cup milk; 2 cloves garlic; 1/2 cup oil; salt and pepper. Put the cheese, peppers, milk and garlic into a blender and puree. With the blender still running, drizzle in the oil until the sauce has a creamy consistency. Season with salt and pepper.",

Spread the filling over the potatoes. Lift the plastic wrap from one end of the potatoes and roll the potatoes up over the filling. Place seam-side down on a serving platter, garnish and serve in slices. Causa rellena can also be formed in a springform pan or as individual portions.",

      "Knead for 10 minutes adding a teaspoon of flour at a time to work surface until dough is soft but not sticking to hands. Resist temptation to add too much flour. The dough should be slightly sticky and soft when finished.",
      "Place saucepan of water on stove to boil.",
      "Meanwhile, remove the dough from mixing bowl. Wash bowl and dry with the towel that you will use to cover the rising dough. Pour 1 tsp of oil in bowl. Place dough in bowl and turn dough to coat it with oil.",
      "Cover bowl with the damp towel. Place the bowl of dough on the middle rack of oven. Place saucepan of boiling water below the rack where your dough sits. Close the oven, but do not turn it on. The pan of hot water will create a warm, moist environment for your dough to rise. Let the dough rise for 1 hour.",

The pumpkin was then easy to scoop out, and I chopped it roughly with a large spoon after I'd put it in the crockpot. I used three onions, roughly chopped, and two leeks, and instead of apple sauce, I used 4 Granny Smith apples, peeled, cored and roughly chopped. I also did the blending with an immersion blender. I simply removed half of the soup into a bowl, and blended each half, then returned what I'd removed to the crockpot. It smelt delicious while it was cooking, and tasted great."

If there are some pieces of unmoistened dough, drizzle more ice water, about 1 teaspoon at a time, over the dough, and toss lightly to mix.

Spoon the preserves in an even layer over the dough. Roll out the remaining dough to a circle about 10 inches in diameter. Cut the dough into 1/2-inch strips.

The paper liner allow the melted butter to bleed a little, and with chilling, the butter can tend to stick to the pan. If this happens, set the whole pan in a larger pan (or sink) of warm water for a few minutes to warm that butter up again. Another alternative would be to use an outer, foil liner. I didn't want to bake the cheesecake in foil liners, as I have heard they impart a metallic taste (yuck). But if you use an inner paper liner and an outer foil liner, this may help."

      "Onion Rings -- Now I cheat - I admit. I hate making them, but if you want to make your own, GO FOR IT! If not, I use frozen Ore Ida rings, just set on the cookie sheet in the oven (follow pkg directions) and bake. Mine took approximately 15 minutes. I started the burgers about half way through cooking the onions so they all came out about the same time. I planned on 3 rings per burger which was about right.",
      "Grilling -- I use a outdoor grill, but an indoor grill pan would also work great. If not, a large saute pan will be fine. I heat the grill or pan to medium heat drizzled or brushed with the olive oil.",
      "With your thumb, push in the center of the burger to make an indentation, not all the way through, but a nice indentation. This will prevent the burger from \"puffing\" up. Grill on side one until golden brown with good grill marks and flip. Finish grilling the burger until medium well or the desired doneness you prefer. I like medium well for burgers. The last minute, add the cheese, cover and remove from the heat. One minute later - the cheese will be melted and you will have the perfect burger.",
      "Rolls -- The last few seconds I put the rolls on the grill for a light toast. Just a few seconds.",
      "Burgers -- Slather a little of the BBQ mayo of each side of the rolls, top with a burger, cheese, onion rings, lettuce and the top roll.",

      "FIRST - Let me explain the Feta. We have an Italian Market that sells fresh fruits and veggies etc. and they have a fresh cheese section. I always buy a block of French Feta Cheese. I use half for this recipe and the rest for omelets etc. You can use the prepacked Feta but if you want the full experience you'll need a lot. Also, you may use other variety of Feta (there's Hungarian, Bulgarian even a salt free one) The French is very salty which is why I add cottage cheese. It kind of balances out the saltiness abit. YOU JUST NEED 1 PACKAGE OF PHYLLO. Mine says 32 oz, buy the long box not the country (it's too thick).",
      "Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F.",
      "In large mixing bowl beat eggs, add 2 cups milk and mix well. Take your block of Feta and cut in half. Use one 1/2 and refrigerate the other. Crumble the Feta into the egg mix and add cottage cheese. Make sure you have nice chunks. Mix well, the mixture should be thick and very lumpy. If too thick add more milk (hence the extra milk).",
      "Take a large deep baking dish. Sprinkle oil on bottom only (dip your spoon into oil, take out and just drizzle slightly). Lay one sheet phyllo and drizzle with oil, continue until you have 4 sheets. When you add the last sheet place your hand flat on the phyllo sheets and GENTLY gather, without tearing by pulling the sides slightly toward center. (It should resemble a crumpled bed) :).",
      "Use 1 full Ladle of the egg/feta mixture onto the layer, you don't need to cover all the phyllo (TRUST ME) just don't leave the feta in one spot distribute.",
      "Layer another phyllo sheet and sprinkle with oil. Layer another sheet of phyllo and again crumple the center then sprinkle the oil (just a little). One Ladle of the egg/feta mix. Continue in this pattern (Don't forget to gather the center each time). If you see that you have alot of the egg/feta mix left you can start to add more than the 1 ladle. Your last layer should be 3-4 layers of phyllo. Don't sprinkle with oil yet. Take a soup spoon and with the handle, tuck in the sides. Now sprinkle with oil.",
      "Bake for about 30-40 minutes or until the top is puffed and nicely browned.",
      "Your kitchen with smell wonderful. The Burek will puff high off the top of the pan but once cooled will drop. You must cool completely or you will nto be able to cut with out it falling apart.",

Continue to pulse for a few seconds, then transfer to a work surface. Shape into a ball and flatten into a disk, cover in plastic wrap and set aside in the fridge for 1 hour (or up to 3 days).",

Roll out the dough to about 1/8 inch/3 mm thick and cut out eight circles, 5 1/2 inches/14 cm wide. Reroll the dough, if necessary, to get eight circles.",
      "Transfer one circle at a time to the 3 1/2-inch/9-cm-wide and 1-inch/3-cm-deep fluted tart pans and gently press the pastry into the corners of the pan; you want it to fit snugly and for there to be a decent amount of pastry hanging over the edge of the pan, as the pastry can shrink a little when baked. Place in the fridge for 30 minutes to rest.",
      "Line the pastry shells in the pans with parchment paper or paper liners and fill with rice or dried beans. Bake for 18 minutes, until the pastry is golden brown at the edges. Remove the rice and paper and bake for another 8 minutes, or until the shell is golden brown. Remove from the oven and set aside to cool completely on the baking sheet. Once cool, trim the shell (so that it can be removed from the pans) and set aside until ready to fill.",

      "To make the candied pecans:",
      "Combine the maple syrup, corn syrup and granulated sugar in a small saucepan and place over a low heat. Stir gently until the sugar has melted, then add the pecans and salt. Stir so that the nuts are coated in the syrup, then tip the nuts onto the lined baking sheet. Place in the oven for about 8 minutes, or until the syrup is bubbling around the nuts. Remove the baking sheet from the oven and set aside until completely cooled. When the nuts are cooled, the glaze should be completely crisp; if not, return them to the oven for a few minutes more. Once cooled, break or roughly chop the nuts into 1/4 -inch/0.5-cm pieces and set aside until ready to use.",
      "To make the filling:",
      "Place the chocolate in a heatproof bowl over a pan of simmering water, making sure that the base of the bowl is not touching the water. Stir occasionally until melted, then use a pastry brush to coat the inside of each tart shell with the chocolate. Set aside for about 30 minutes, to set, then fill with enough chestnut spread so that it rises about halfway up the sides of the tart shells.",
      "To make the vanilla whipped cream:",
      "Pour the cream into the bowl of an electric mixer with the whisk attachment in place. Add the confectioners' sugar, vanilla extract and brandy and beat on high speed for 1 minute, or until medium-soft peaks form.",
      "Divide the whipped cream among the tarts, so that it is slightly domed on top of the chestnut spread. Sprinkle the candied pecans generously on top-you might have a tablespoon or two left over, but these can be saved to munch on, to sprinkle over your next bowl of breakfast granola or porridge, or to use in the Knickerbocker Glory-and serve.",
      "Equipment:",
      "You will need eight mini fluted tart pans, about 3 1/2 inch/9 cm wide and 1 inch/3 cm deep. Alternatively, you can make this in one large fluted tart pan, around 10 inches/25 cm wide and 1 inch/3 cm deep.",
      "Make Ahead:",
      "The pastry can be made up to 3 days ahead and kept in the fridge (covered in plastic wrap) until ready to roll. It can also be frozen for up to 2 months. The candied pecans can be made up to 5 days in advance and kept in an airtight container.",
