Saute for 3-4 minutes until softened, then add the chopped spinach with the remaining pepper and saute until wilted, approximately 2-3 minutes.",
      "Turn heat down to medium low and add the cream cheese, brie and half of the parmesan (save half to top the stuffed caps), yogurt, and chipotle sauce (to taste, we like a bit of spice). Stir to incorporate, cover and allow cheeses to melt for about 5-6 minutes. Check to see if they're melted - if they are, stir again and then add the cheddar. Stir to incorporate, turn off the heat and cover. The cheddar is the binding cheese, which is why you add it last.",
      "After 2 minutes, stir in the pine nuts. Fill the mushroom caps with the spinach/cheese mixture and top with remaining parmesan cheese. Bake for 25 minutes or until the parmesan is lightly browned. Enjoy!"

Dry beans, especially dry red kidney beans, contain a toxin called Phytohaemagglutinin, which can cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pain. Soaking and boiling dry beans helps remove this toxin to make beans safe to eat -- in a slow cooker, the temperature never gets hot enough to heat up dry beans sufficiently [source: U.S. Food and Drug Administration]. They recommend that you first soak them for a minimum of 12 hours, rinse them, and then boil them for 10 minutes. Singla has said that the long cooking here has the same effect, but if you have any concerns, please use these instructions, and expect the beans to finish cooking more quickly. Use less water if you start with soaked beans.",

(Several people have mentioned that it seems watery, so you might want to try less water - definitely less water if beans were pre-soaked).",
      "If you can find them, remove the cloves and the cinnamon stick. If the beans are not as creamy as you want them, stick your immersion blender in there and whir a bit. (Or remove about one cup of the beans and process in blender or food processor). Most of the beans should remain whole.",

      "1. Whisk water, yeast, and honey in bowl of stand mixer until well combined, making sure no honey sticks to bottom of bowl. Add flours and mix on low speed with dough hook until cohesive dough is formed, about 3 minutes. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and let sit at room temperature 30 minutes.",
      "2. Remove plastic wrap and evenly sprinkle salt over dough. Knead on low speed (speed 2 on KitchenAid) 5 minutes. (If dough creeps up attachment, stop mixer and scrape down using well-floured hands or greased spatula.) Increase speed to medium and continue to knead until dough is smooth and slightly tacky, about 1 minute. If dough is very sticky, add 1 to 2 tablespoons flour and continue mixing 1 minute. Lightly spray 2-quart bowl with nonstick cooking spray; transfer dough to bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Let dough rise in warm, draft-free place until doubled in size, about 1 hour.",
      "3. Fold dough over itself; rotate bowl quarter turn and fold again. Rotate bowl again and fold once more. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise 30 minutes. Repeat folding, replace plastic wrap, and let dough rise until doubled in volume, about 30 minutes. Spray two 9-inch round cake pans with nonstick cooking spray and set aside.",
      "4. Transfer dough to floured work surface, sprinkle top with more flour. Using bench scraper, cut dough in half and gently stretch each half into 16-inch cylinders. Divide each cylinder into quarters, then each quarter into 2 pieces (you should have 16 pieces total), and dust top of each piece with more flour. With floured hands, gently pick up each piece and roll in palms to coat with flour, shaking off excess, and place in prepared cake pan. Arrange 8 dough pieces in each cake pan, placing one piece in middle and others around it, with long side of each piece running from center of pan to edge and making sure cut-side faces up. Loosely cover cake pans with plastic wrap and let rolls rise until doubled in size, about 30 minutes (dough is ready when it springs back slowly when pressed lightly with finger). Thirty minutes before baking, adjust rack to middle position and heat oven to 500 degrees.",
      "5. Remove plastic wrap from cake pans, spray rolls lightly with water, and place in oven. Bake 10 minutes until tops of rolls are brown; remove from oven. Reduce oven temperature to 400 degrees; using kitchen towels or oven mitts, invert rolls from both cake pans onto rimmed baking sheet. When rolls are cool enough to handle, turn right-side up, pull apart, and space evenly on baking sheet. Continue to bake until rolls develop deep golden brown crust and sound hollow when tapped on bottom, 10 to 15 minutes; rotating baking sheet halfway through baking time. Transfer rolls to wire rack and cool to room temperature, about 1 hour."

As this recipe has already been reviewed as is, I don't want to alter it too much. But as an alternative, I'd like to give you a recipe from Epicurious.com, whom I've found to be a reliable source. Watermelon Jelly, courtesy of Epicurious.com: 4 cups seeded, diced watermelon, 3 1/2 cups sugar, 2 Tbs lemon juice, 1/2 of a 6 ounce pkg of liquid fruit pectin (1 foil pouch). Instructions: Place diced watermelon in a blender container or food processor bowl. Cover and blend or process until smooth (should have 2 cups watermelon puree). In a 6 to 8 quart kettle combine the watermelon puree, sugar and lemon juice. Bring the mixture to a full rolling boil (a boil that cannot be stirred down) over high heat, stirring constantly with a long handled wooden spoon. Stir in the pectin all at once. Return mixture to a full rolling boil; boil hard for 1 minute, stirring constantly. Remove kettle from heat; skim off foam. Ladle jelly into clean, hot half-pint jars, leaving 1/4-inch head space. Wipe jar rims; adjust lids. Allow to cool completely away from drafts, then store in cool, dark place. Makes 4 half pints.",
      "Note #3: from RecipeZaar user Foggy Kitchen come these helpful comments. \"Mine did not gel and I had to research why not. Follow directions! Detail on the Pectin box distinctly separates fruit w/pectin -vs- bowl of sugar on side to be added LATER, then briefly fast boiled (the one minute reference).\"."

      "Stir in yeast and set aside for 10-15 minutes for yeast to work. When ready, there should be at least a 1\" topping of foam on the mixture.",
      "While yeast is working, put a cup of whole wheat grain (i.e., the whole kernels or berries) in the VitaMix blender and grind for ONE MINUTE. Make sure the blender container is completely dry when this is begun. Put the wheat flour in a large mixing bowl. Repeat this process three more times. Note: I only have the \"wet-blade\" container, and is seems to do a marvelous job of making flour from grain but works best with smaller quantities of grain. This is why I grind one cup at a time. I have found that 4+ cups of whole wheat berries yields about five cups of whole-wheat flour.",
      "Add gluten and salt to the whole-wheat flour and stir briefly to blend the dry ingredients.",
      "Add yeast mixture and stir with a wooden spoon or spatula. When ingredients are lightly mixed, dump everything out onto the kitchen counter, in a spot that has been cleaned and lightly oiled. Note: I hand-knead dough, so I use rubber or light plastic gloves to keep the dough off my hands -- and out of my rings!. If you have a mixer with dough hooks, so much the better.",
      "Knead the dough for five minutes, adding small amounts of water to keep the dough just barely on the sticky/gooey side. Put the dough back in the mixing bowl. It's hard to explain exactly what the consistency should be, but I try to keep the mixture sticky and quite moist. To add water, I make a depression in the dough and put in the water, then fold the dough over on itself. Kneading is fun! At least I think so. I flatten the dough with the heals of my hands, fold it end-for-end, repeat.",
      "Put about two inches of hot water (110-120\u00b0F, decidedly warm to the touch, but not uncomfortably warm) in the sink and \"float\" the mixing bowl with dough in the sink. (It won't float with that little water, but you get the idea.) Cover the dough with a light cloth. The warm water will keep the dough warm and moist while it raises. Let dough raise about 30 minutes, or until it doubles in size.",
      "Dump the dough back onto the counter top and knead again for two or three minutes. This will reduce the size of the dough as the air pockets are pressed out. Divide dough into two equal lumps, and form into the shape of loaves to fit bread pans. (Note: If you want to freeze half the dough for later use, now is the time to do it.) Oil and lightly flour the pans if they do not have a non-stick surface. Place each lump into a warmed bread pan, put these on the counter, and cover with a dry cloth. Note: I generally warm the pans by floating them in the sink, after I've removed the bowl in step 7. Allow the dough to rise a second time, which usually takes about a half-hour. The bread is ready when it has raised to about a half-inch above the height of the bread pan.",
      "Cook at 360\u00b0F for about 35 to 40 minutes. When done, remove the bread from the bread pans and let cool (if you can stand the wait!) for about 10 to fifteen minutes before cutting and eating. Nothing is better smelling and tasting than fresh, hot, whole-wheat bread!",
      "One final note: We live at an altitude of 4000 feet. The lower air pressure makes yeast work a little more quickly, and generally more liquid and a higher cooking temperature is required. However, this recipe was originally used in Texas, so it's probable no modifications are necessary."

Now I happen to use the quick cooking, but you can use any Jasmine brand, quick cooking or not that you want. Just follow the directions for cooking the rice. But these are my changes. For the liquid, I use vegetable broth instead of water and I replace some of the broth with the juice of 1 orange, however much that will be depends on the size of the orange. Just make sure if it calls for 3 cups of liquid, use the orange juice and the rest should be the vegetable broth. This will just really help to flavor the rice as it cooks. I also add the zest of 1entire orange to the liquid as the rice cooks. Just cover and let cook as you sear the scallops.",
      "Scallops -- As the rice cooks, time to make the scallops. In a cast iron if you have one or a stainless pan (NO NON STICK) for this dish heat up 2 tablespoons of the the butter and 1 teaspoon olive oil to medium high heat and sear the scallops. Once you place them in the pan DO NOT move. They take about 2-3 minutes per side and when you can easily lift them, then it is time to turn. They don't take long and don't over cook. When they become opaque and firm to the touch they are done. They will also continue to cook once removed. They should be golden brown per side. Once done, remove to a plate and cover with foil.",

Keep the sheets that you're not working with covered with some waxed paper and a damp cloth (the waxed paper goes directly on top of the dough, the wet towel on top. If you have a helper, they can lift the paper/cloth as needed, makes it easier). Place 2 sheets of dough in the pan, and using a pastry brush, coat the top sheet completely with margarine. Spread a thin layer of the nut mixture, add 2 more sheets of phyllo. Repeat with the butter, nut mixture, and 2 phyllo sheets until you have a total of 8 layered sheets. For the top layer, place 2-4 phyllo sheets, but this time brush margarine between each individual sheet.",

      "Place the urad dhal in a large bowl and rinse with many changes of water until the water no longer appears cloudy. Drain.",
      "In a large bowl, combine the drained urad dhal with the rice, fenugreek seeds, and 2 1/2 cups water. Soak the ingredients together for 4 hours at room temperature, until the dhal and rice expand and soften. When a grain of rice just breaks under the pressure of your fingernail, the ingredients have soaked long enough.",
      "Drain the urad dhal and rice, reserving the liquid. Place roughly half of the solids and half of the liquid in a blender and grind them long enough to get a smooth consistency with some graininess remaining, about 1 1/2 to 2 minutes. Test by rubbing a little batter between your fingers. The largest grains should be the size of granulated sugar. Pour the mixture into a large bowl. Repeat the process with the remaining solids and liquid, and add the mixture to the bowl. Stir in the salt. The mixture should be very thick, so it will be necessary to thin it with approximately 1/4 cup water to get the consistency of pancake batter.",
      "Cover the bowl loosely with plastic wrap and place in an oven, kept warm to a temperature of 90 degrees for 12 to 15 hours. This can be achieved with the help of a trouble light or floodlight fitted with a 25-watt bulb. Plug the power cord into an outlet close enough to the oven so that the bulb can rest on a rack in the oven. Turn on the light and prop the oven door open about 1 inch with the handle of a wooden spoon. Check the temperature periodically to be sure it stays at 90 degrees. During warm summer months it may not be necessary to use the lightbulb. The batter should nearly double in volume and smell a little sour.",
      "Remove the bowl from the oven and stir the contents. The batter will be thick and foamy. If you choose not to fry the crepes immediately, refrigerate the batter at this point. Remove it from refrigerator 1/2 hour before frying.",
      "When ready to fry the crepes, check the consistency of the batter: it should pour smoothly like pancake batter. Add the baking soda and a little more water if needed.",
      "Heat a nonstick griddle or frying pan over medium low heat (2 pans will speed up the process). Spread about 1/4 teaspoon oil evenly over the griddle. Ladle 1/4 cup of the batter into the center of the hot griddle, and immediately, using the back of the ladle, gently but steadily spread the batter in a circular motion from the center out, creating a thin pancake. If the batter does not spread easily into a thin layer, thin it with a little more water.",
      "As the crepe cooks, small holes will form on the surface. Sprinkle a few drops of oil on top, to help make it crisp. When the bottom turns a golden color (about 1 minute) turn it over and fry the other side 30 seconds or until lightly browned. Fold the crepe in half, golden side out, and place it on a platter. Keep the fried crepes warm as you repeat the process, oiling the griddle each time. Serve immediately."

      "Measure the Oatmeal into pan. ('Porridge Oats' here in the UK). Personally I find 'quick oats' a real disappointment as I like the texture of the rolled oats, but if you must -- :).",
      "Add ground ginger, vanilla flavouring (and caraway seeds if using them).",
      "Add dried milk if using it - or fresh milk/ buttermilk plus water to make total 1 1/2 cups (345ml) of liquids.",
      "Either squish a quarter of an orange, including pulp (but not rind or pips!) into the pan or add the orange juice.",
      "Bring to a gentle boil on a moderate heat and reduce heat to simmer once boiling point reached, stirring occasionally.",
      "Once it has thickened (to personal taste) almost to the point of being ready to eat (about 2 or 3 minutes), if using it, add the wheat bran. Please bear in mind the bran will soak up quite a bit of water and thicken the mixture. I just added it because I like a chewier texture and the 'seriously good for you, wholesome' flavour, but absolutely a matter of personal taste!",
      "Whether adding bran or not, when nearly thick enough, add the rhubarb and about 3 teaspoons Splenda or sugar. Canned rhubarb is fine - probably better actually. I can buy unsweetened canned rhubarb but if using sweetened rhubarb then you'll probably want to decrease the total sugar a bit.",
      "Add the Cream of Tartar and gently stir it in well.",
      "Add the good 1/2 tsp or so of baking soda and immediately stir it in gently but very quickly - it rises a lot immediately.",
      "Increase the heat a bit, stirring continuously to mix well. Bring to desired thickness stirring as necessary then pour into serving bowl.",
      "Top with the yoghurt. Sprinkle a couple of teaspoons of artificial sweetener / sugar across the top. (I expect brown sugar would be especially nice!) I sprinkled a bit more ground ginger across the top as well as I really like ginger! Pour the prepared marmalade sauce across the yoghurt.",
      "SERVE AND DEVOUR!",
      "A passing thought about a slight oversight of mine -- I weighed the uncooked rhubarb to be 70g and forgot to weigh it once cooked and before adding it. The 130g cooked rhubarb is a guess - but the volume measure (about 3 tablespoons) was about what the 70g uncooked rhubarb became after cooking.",
      "VARIATIONS:",
      "A couple of delicious ideas that I've not tried yet but probably will --.",
      "A baked dessert could be made by preparing with either rhubarb, large chunks of drained canned peach slices/pineapple, large chunks of peeled apple and/or sultanas into a suitable baking dish with perhaps 1/2 cup of flour (wholemeal would probably be really good for this) plus a bit more sweetness, baking in a medium oven for 1/2 to 3/4 hour or so. Also you could change the vanilla for almond essence (but surely not with rhubarb!) Then either eating, topped with toasted oats or chopped nuts and brown sugar (and maybe fine-chopped candied ginger, or maybe a couple of tablespoons orange marmalade / canned peach slices pulped though your fingers, a pineapple ring or whatever depending on what's in the middle). Served warm with custard and maybe strawberry/apricot jam/preserve, or set firm and cold with ice-cream or sweetened greek-style (nonfat) yoghurt.",
      "Or the baked dessert could be left to cool somewhat and then topped with (maybe a layer of strawberry/apricot jam/preserve, then) a nice vanilla egg-custard, left to set, then topped as before with toasted oats, candied ginger or whatever.",
      "With acknowledgments to Toni Gifford's excellent Ginger Peach Oatmeal #112474 which I spotted the other day which must have been there at the back of my mind for the idea about peaches!",

      "***Please note: Based on Sheepie87's review, I want to clarify that you are not putting the blanching water in the blender, just the blanched pieces of zest(putting the hot water into the blender will certainly result in way too much liquid being present and the poor little custards will never ever set!) Also, you do not need to temper the eggs because they are blended in a cool/room temp liquid(the juices, milk and sugar mixture) and then baked(you only need to temper eggs that are going into a HOT liquid -- again, I need to emphasize that you are NOT using the hot water for anything other than blanching the zest.) Good luck and sorry for any confusion that the original wording may have caused. These really are nice light citrus custards that can be served warm or cool --- a little whipped cream and a sprig of mint and you're over the top! See the pics I posted to get an idea of the texture on the spoon and the look both cooked in the ramekin and plated. Thanks! (6/16/07)."

      "2. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, salt, and sugar. Cut in the butter until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Gradually stir in milk until dough pulls away from the side of the bowl.",
      "3. Turn out onto a floured surface, and knead 15 to 20 times. Pat or roll dough out to 1 inch thick. Cut biscuits with a large cutter or juice glass dipped in flour. Repeat until all dough is used. Brush off the excess flour, and place biscuits onto an ungreased baking sheet.",
      "4. Bake for 13 to 15 minutes in the preheated oven, or until edges begin to brown.",
      "My Note: I do not substitute shortning for the butter or margarine, better flavor. For those who didn't get the desired results -- Try these tips: The instructions say to knead 14-15 TIMES, NOT 14-15 minutes! The object is to handle the dough as little as possible. 1.Don't overmix the dough once you add the milk and only pat together (no real \"kneading\" or they will be tough). 2.only add the amount of milk you need, some days i have to use it all and then others I have a little left in the cup. 3. make sure the butter is cold 4.can brush with melted butter before and/or after baking for added softness and flavor and 5. can place closer together if yours still aren't soft. If you're new to biscuits, remember - any time you make biscuits (or scones or anything else that uses baking powder or soda to rise) you want to gently mix the dough JUST until the ingredients are all mixed-- don't maul it or knead it. The more you handle your dough the more the gluten develops and the tougher your biscuits (or pie crust, etc.) will be.",
      "The only drawback was that they were bland and definitely had a slight baking powder taste. I made them a second time and substituted cultured buttermilk powder (4 TBS Saco brand) + 1 Celsius water in place of the milk; dropped the baking powder back to 2 tsp; and added 1/2 tsp baking soda. Oh my goodness -- perfection -- so flavorful and soft and fluffy! Absolutely the best I've ever made or eaten - Hope these tip's help and thank you so much doing.",
      "I do know that the barometer affects how your biscuits turn out, (works the same with anything with yeast, such as bread) so, if it's raining or very humid, they won't rise as well. If it's hot and dry, they should rise beautifully. So I kind of go by that when I am adding the liquid and flour (amounts). After you've made enough biscuits, you can tell how their going to turn out by how the (uncooked) dough looks and feels. I was thinking about the post that said they turned out dry on the outside and moist inside, if they seem very hard, then I would think possibly, they were cooked at too high a temperature and/or were left in too long. Because my oven is very hot, I always turn it down by 25 degrees, and never assume that the time stated is going to be \"perfect\" for my oven, so I checked these after 10 minutes, and then watched them 2 to 3 minutes after. Anyway, you should enjoy these."

      "In a 5 or 6 quart bowl or lidded food storage container, dump in the water and add the yeast and salt (herbs as well, if using). Because we are mixing in the flour so quickly it doesn't matter that the salt and yeast are thrown in together. If you are using the fresh cake yeast break it up.",

      "Stir it until all of the flour is incorporated into the dough. It will be a wet rough dough.",
      "Put the lid on the container, but do not snap it shut. You want the gases from the yeast to escape. (You could put a little hole in the top of the lids so that you could close the lids and still allow the gases to get out.).",
      "Allow the dough to sit at room temperature for about 2 hours to rise. When you first mix the dough it will not occupy much of the container. But, after the initial 2 hour rise it will pretty much fill it. (If you have decreased the yeast you will have to let it go longer than 2 hours.) DO NOT PUNCH DOWN THE DOUGH! Just let it settle by itself.",
      "The dough will be flat on the top and some of the bubbles may even appear to be popping. (If you intend to refrigerate the dough after this stage it can be placed in the refrigerator even if the dough is not perfectly flat. The yeast will continue to work even in the refrigerator.) The dough can be used right after the initial 2 hour rise, but it is much easier to handle when it is chilled. It is intended for refrigeration and use over the next two weeks, ready for you anytime. The flavor will deepen over that time, developing sourdough characteristics.",
      "The next day when you pull the dough out of the refrigerator you will notice that it has collapsed and this is totally normal for this type of dough. It will never rise up again in the container.",
      "Dust the surface of the dough with a little flour, just enough to prevent it from sticking to your hands when you reach in to pull a piece out.",
      "You should notice that the dough has a lot of stretch once it has rested. (If your dough breaks off instead of stretching your dough is probably too dry and you can just add a few tablespoons of water and let it sit again until the dough absorbs the additional water.).",
      "At this point, you can divide the dough into 4 one pound balls and freeze them in airtight containers for up to three weeks. Allow 24 hours in refrigerator to thaw before use. You can also leave the dough in its container in the refrigerator for up to 14 days, cutting off pieces as needed.",
      "When ready to bake, cut off a 1-pound piece of dough using kitchen shears and hold in your hands. Add a little more flour so it will not stick to your hands. Gently stretch the surface of the dough around to the bottom on all four sides, rotating the ball a quarter turn as you go. Most of the dusting flour will fall off; it's not intended to be incorporated into the dough. The correctly shaped final product will be smooth and cohesive.",
      "Rest the loaf on a generous layer of corn meal or a sheet of parchment paper on top of a pizza peel. Let the dough rest for at least 40 minutes, (although letting it go 60 or even 90 minutes will give you a more open hole structure in the interior of the loaf. This may also improve the look of your loaf and prevent it from splitting on the bottom. ) You will notice that the loaf does not rise much during this rest, in fact it may just spread sideways, this is normal for this type of dough.",
      "Twenty minutes before baking, preheat the oven to 450 degrees F with a baking stone on the center rack, with a metal broiler tray on the bottom (never use a glass vessel for this or it will shatter), which will be used to produce steam. (The tray needs to be at least 4 or 5 inches away from your stone to prevent it from cracking.).",
      "Dust the top of the loaf with more flour so the knife will not stick. Cut the loaf with 1/4-inch slashes using a serrated knife. If your slashes are too shallow you will end up with an oddly shaped loaf and also prevent it from splitting on the bottom.",
      "Slide the loaf into the oven onto the preheated stone and add a cup of hot water to the broiler tray. Quickly close the oven door. Bake the bread for 30-35 minutes or until a deep brown color. To insure that you get the best results it is crucial to have an Oven Thermometer to make sure your oven is accurate.",
      "If you used parchment paper, you will want to remove it after about 20-25 minutes to crisp up the bottom crust. Continue baking the loaf directly on the stone for the last 5-10 minutes.",
      "Allow the loaf to cool on a rack until it is room temperature. If you cut into a loaf before it is cooled you will have a tough crust and a gummy interior. It is hard to wait, but you will be happy you did! Make sure you have a nice sharp Bread Knife that will not crush the bread as you cut. Or you can tear it apart as they do in most of Europe.",
      "If you have any leftover bread just let it sit, uncovered on the cutting board or counter with the cut side down. If you cover a bread that has a crust it will get soggy."
