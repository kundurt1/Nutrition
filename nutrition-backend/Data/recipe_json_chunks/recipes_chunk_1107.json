      "1. In a large bowl, mix together 1/3 cup condensed French onion soup with ground beef, bread crumbs, egg, salt and black pepper. Shape into 6 oval patties.",

      "3. In a small bowl, blend flour and remaining soup until smooth. Mix in ketchup, water, Worcestershire sauce and mustard powder. Pour over meat in skillet. Cover, and cook for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally.",
      "My Note: Here are the changes I made to what is now my favorite dish. In the gravy, I used a can of French Onion soup as well as a can of Cream of Mushroom and a packet of Dry Onion Soup or sauteed onions. I omitted the salt due to the high sodium content in the soups. I'm glad I did. I doubled the gravy except for the ketchup -- kept it at 1/4 cup while doubling the rest. I also added a jar of mushrooms to the gravy. After browning each side of the patties (and yes, having them fall apart slightly), I transferred the patties to a foil-lined casserole dish, put the gravy on top, covered the dish, and cooked it at 375*F. for 45 minutes. I was worried the patties wouldn't get all the way done because they were pretty thick, but they turned out perfect! so simple to make. So, if you're craving an old cafeteria food favorite - don't waste your time with the recipe for the sauce - buy a box of Lipton Mushroom Onion soup mix and make the gravy with it - you won't regret it! We had it with brown rice (and had just enough wonderful gravy to go along with it!) and steamed broccoli. This is a new favorite recipe for my wife and me. For those who had trouble keeping the patties together, try this it was suggested to me. Instead of cooking in a skillet, place browned patties in a foil-lined casserole dish, pour gravy over top, and bake at 400 for 30 minutes Your patties will stay together nicely! I do like to play with my food. I would love to hear any improvements and/or variations you make to this simple recipe. Enjoy!"

      "Scallops -- Bring the scallops to room temperature while you start the other side dishes.",
      "Rice -- I used Jasmine, just the boil in bag rice. Now you can use any rice you want or have on hand. But I was in a hurry and this in the cabinet, and it works just fine. Five minutes in the microwave in a bowl of water and it is so quick and easy, why not? Just follow the directions on the box or bag. This recipe serves 4 so I like about 1/2 cup per serving. I actually used 2 bags. But again, use anything you want.",
      "After the rice is done, add butter, thyme, scallions, salt and pepper to taste, lemon zest, lemon juice. Mix well and cover and set to the side. It is done. You can reheat for 30 seconds in the micro if necessary. But it should stay warm covered.",
      "Kale -- In a large saute pan (non stick is NOT preferred). Add butter and olive oil. Bring to medium high heat and add the garlic and shallot and saute until slightly soft, 1-2 minutes. Add the kale and chicken broth and cook until slightly wilted it only takes a couple of minutes. Then add the vinegar, salt and pepper and remove to a bowl, cover and set to the side.",
      "Scallops -- In the same pan you cooked the kale in after lightly wiping clean, melt olive oil and butter. Pat your scallops dry and salt and pepper well. Cook on medium high heat until nice and golden brown on one side and then flip. Don't move them around, just let them get a cut crust on the first side before flipping. At least 2-3 minutes. Once flipped the other side doesn't take that long. Remove and cover with foil.",
      "Sauce -- In that same pan (we are saving pots and pans with this dish) add the white wine to deglaze the pan, reduce the heat to medium / medium low and add the chicken broth, thyme, lemon zest, salt, pepper and cream. Cook 2-3 minutes still on medium heat. Remove from the heat and add in the lemon juice. Heat just a minute and check seasoning. Adjust if necessary.",
      "Serving -- Add a spoon of the rice on each plate about 1/2 cup, then top with the kale, and top it off with the seared scallops. Drizzle with the creamy lemon sauce and enjoy! That is just perfect.",
      "It may seem like a lot -- but each part is very quick and very easy. When I make this I just get everything ready as it goes so quick."
