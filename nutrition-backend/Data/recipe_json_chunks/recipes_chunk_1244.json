Add the sweet potatoes, and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium, and boil until cooked through, just softer than fork tender. Using an immersion blender, puree the ingredients until they are thoroughly blended. Add the grated ginger, and test for consistency. If too thick, add a bit more water. Taste for seasoning, adding more salt or pepper, as needed. Ladle the soup into warm bowls, and garnish with a mound of hot crispy matchstick potatoes and frizzled leeks.",

(If you don't have a thermometer, a cube of bread will brown in about 3 minutes.) To make matchstick fries: Peel and cut potatoes into matchstick slices. Rinse them under cold water in a strainer to remove the excess starch. Let drain well, and pat dry. Fry for 3 to 5 minutes submerged in canola oil, until they are a nice deep golden brown. Drain the potatoes on a paper towel or absorbent cloth. Sprinkle with salt and pepper while hot. To make 'frizzled leeks': Cut the 3-inch piece of leek into matchstick slices similar to the potato. Place the potato starch in a small bowl, lightly dust the leek pieces in it to help prevent them from burning. Fry the strips of leek in the same hot oil used for the potatoes, until they are just golden, about 1 minute Add to the bowl of matchstick fries. Mix them together. Garnish in a little mound on top of the soup."

      "While the oysters are smoking and cooling prepare the filling. Heat the butter in a medium skillet over medium heat until foaming. Stir in the shallot, season lightly with salt and pepper, and cook, stirring often, until tender, about 4 minutes. Stir in the fresh spinach and cook until wilted and bright green, about 2 minutes. (if using frozen spinach, squeeze out as much water as possible before adding to the pan and cook just until heated through).",
      "Sprinkle the vermouth over the spinach and cook until evaporated. Pour in the heavy cream, adding the nutmeg, and bring to a boil. boil until the cream is reduced by about half and thickened. While the spinach mixture is still warm, taste it and add salt and pepper as necessary. Cool to room temperature.",

      "Using rock salt to steady clams or oysters on the half shell during broiling is an old restaurant trick. You can duplicate the steadying effect of rock salt with aluminum foil. Tear off a sheet of foil about 2inches longer than your broiling pan. Crumble it lightly. then fix it into the bottom of the broiler pan. Press the oysters and clams into the wrinkles of the crumpled foil to keep them from tipping during broiling."

Add the butter, flavoring, egg and milk, then mix until a shaggy dough forms. Let the dough rest for 30 minutes; this resting period allows the flour to absorb the liquid fully, making it easier to knead.",

Place the dough in a greased bowl, turning to coat. Cover the bowl, and let the dough rise until it's almost doubled in bulk, about 1 1/2 to 2 hours. The amount of time this takes will depend on the temperature of your kitchen; yeast works the fastest at about 85\u00b0F.",
      "Bread Machine Method:",
      "Place all of the dough ingredients into the pan of your bread machine, program the machine for manual or dough, and press Start. About 10 minutes before the end of the final kneading cycle, adjust the consistency of the dough with additional flour or water, as necessary; it should be smooth and somewhat sticky.

Roll the first half into a 10 x 12-inch rectangle. Spread half the filling over the rolled-out dough, leaving a 1/2-inch margin clear of filling along all sides.",
      "Starting with a long side, roll the dough into a log, sealing the edge. Use a pizza cutter or sharp knife to cut the log in half lengthwise. Place the half-logs, filled side up, side by side on a well-greased or parchment-lined baking sheet. Keeping the filling side up, twist or \"braid\" the two logs together, working from the center to each end. Pinch the ends together. Repeat with the second piece of dough. Cover the twists lightly, and set them aside to rise for 1 to 2 hours.",

Place the slices cut side up (and down) in well-greased or parchment-lined pans, placing them close together (though not touching) for soft-sided rolls, or about 2 inches apart for crustier rolls.

If the caramel hardens, set the pan over medium-high heat. Stir until the caramel dissolves, then pour it into a heatproof measuring cup or bowl.",
      "Step 2: With hot water (so the leftover caramel bits do not seize up on the bottom of the pan), clean and dry the pan. Place the skillet over medium-high heat and heat canola oil in the skillet. Add onion and ginger. Cook for 1 minute. Add sliced garlic and cook for an additional minute. With a slotted spoon, remove the onion, ginger, and garlic from the oil and reserve in a bowl. Many Vietnamese Chicken recipes usually require a short time to make this process.",
      "Step 3: To the skillet, add chicken thighs. Cook until the chicken no longer looks raw on the outside, about 2 minutes per side. Yes, the pan will be crowded! Add the reserved caramel sauce, fish sauce, 1/4 teaspoon salt, black pepper, and chili flakes. Mix to coat the chicken. Reduce the heat to medium and cook (the mixture will be simmering briskly) until the chicken is cooked through, turning the chicken every 2 to 3 minutes, about 20 minutes. Stir in the reserved onions, ginger, and garlic and cook for 2 to 3 additional minutes.",
      "Step 4: Transfer the chicken and cooked aromatics (ginger, etc) to a serving platter. Thinly slice spring onions and use to garnish the chicken.",
      "To sum up, this dish is one of best Vietnamese Chicken recipes in rainy days. With a hot bowl rice and soup, you can feel comfortable and feel warmer inside by ginger. It also help you to prevent many sick when the weather changes. Good luck to you!",

      "Preheat oven to 400. Pierce a spaghetti squash 8-10 times with a skewer or thin knife (pierce deeply through flesh into center). Place on a baking sheet on center rack of oven. Bake for 30 minutes and then turn 1/4 turn. Bake another 30 minutes or until outside has browned in places and shell feels soft. Remove from oven and set aside until cool enough to handle. Once it's cool, cut it in half and remove and discard the seeds and scrape the strands of squash out with a fork. Put the squash into a bowl and set aside.",
      "While the squash is cooking, prepare the Brussels sprouts. Trim and discard the ends and cut the sprouts in half (quarter larger sprouts). Place on a baking sheet and spray quickly (2 seconds) with olive oil. (This prevents burning; if you don't want to use the oil, cover loosely with a sheet of aluminum foil.) When the squash has finished cooking, put the sprouts into the oven and bake for about 15 minutes, stirring halfway through. Remove them when they are just beginning to be touched by brown but are not burning (they will finish cooking in the skillet in the next step).",
      "In a large, deep, non-stick skillet, cook the onions on medium-high heat until they become golden, about 5-6 minutes. Add the Brussels sprouts, garlic, and vegetable broth and cover tightly. Cook for 3-5 minutes, adding more broth or water if skillet becomes dry. Add the chickpeas, basil, and red pepper flakes. Stir in the spaghetti squash, and toss gently to mix. Cook until heated through. Add salt and pepper to taste, along with lemon juice. Serve topped with crushed or sliced almonds, if desired."
