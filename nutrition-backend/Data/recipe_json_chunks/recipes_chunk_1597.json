Baby potatoes in Australia are called chat potatoes. I think they are called new potatoes in the US. You can use any type of potatoes you want. Just ensure they are starchy ones suitable for roasting and mashing (that go fluffy when cooked), not the waxy ones which are good for boiling for things like potato salad (which hold their shape).\n2. This can be made with fresh fish or good quality frozen fish. Thaw the fish completely before cooking.\n3. The cooking time for the fish will vary depending on the thickness of the fillet you are using. If you aren't sure, just take a peek by pushing aside some of the fish flakes in the centre of the fish to check. And remember that the fish will continue to cook while resting! Also if you are cooking fish straight out of the fridge, it will take a little longer to cook than fish at room temperature."

      "In a large bowl, combine goat cheese, ricotta, egg, lemon zest, and lemon juice; whisk until smooth. Cover and place in the refrigerator until needed.",
      "Preheat oven to 400\u00b0F. Wrap beets in foil, place on a baking sheet, and roast for 45 minutes or until tender. Once the beets have cooled, remove the skins with your hands and discard peel. This can be done up to two days in advance. Place peeled and cooled beets in a food processor and process until extremely smooth, about 1 minute. Add eggs and egg yolk and pulse until combined.",
      "In a KitchenAid(R) Stand Mixer fitted with the flat beater attachment, combine flour and salt; mix on low until combined. Add beet puree, turn the speed to 2 and mix until combined; about 1 minute. Exchange the paddle for the dough hook and knead until for 8 to 10 minutes or until the dough is smooth. Humidity in the air can affect the moisture in the dough. If the dough seems too \"wet\" add additional flour a tablespoon at a time until the dough becomes firm. If the dough is too \"dry\" add cold water a tablespoon at a time until the dough is balanced. Remove the dough to a lightly floured work surface and cut into 6 equal pieces; cover.",
      "Attach the KitchenAid(R) Pasta Roller attachment to the stand mixer and set the adjustment knob to 1. Turn the mixer speed to a speed you are comfortable with between 2 and 4. Feed one pasta dough piece through the pasta roller. Sprinkle the dough with a little flour, fold in half, and roll again. Repeat this process several times until the dough is smooth and pliable.",
      "Move the adjustment knob to setting 2 and feed the dough through to flatten. Move the adjustment knob to 3, sprinkle the dough with flour, and roll it through to flatten further. Move the adjustment knob to 4, sprinkle with flour, and roll the dough through again for the final time. Do not fold the dough during the flattening process. Set pasta sheet on a floured surface and cover. Repeat with remaining dough.",
      "With a 2 1/2 -inch round pastry cutter, cut rounds out of the pasta sheets. If the leftover pasta dough is still pliable, gather, run it through the pasta roller and repeat the pasta sheet process.",
      "Place the filling in a pastry bag and pipe a dollop of the goat cheese filling onto the center of a pasta round. You can also do this using a spoon, if desired. With your finger or a pastry brush, brush the edge of the pasta round with water. Top with another pasta round and press the sides to adhere the rounds together. Repeat with the remaining pasta. Cover finished ravioli with a towel until use.",
      "In a large saucepan, melt 6 tablespoons of butter over medium heat. Simmer the butter until it turns golden brown; about 8 minutes. Once the butter has browned, immediately remove from heat and add the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter; stir until melted. This will stop the cooking process. Add sage and salt; stir until combined. Taste and add additional salt if needed.",
      "Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Once boiling, reduce the heat to a rapid simmer over medium-high. Carefully add the ravioli to the water. Gently stir to keep the ravioli separated for even cooking. Cook for 5 minutes. Strain water from the ravioli.",
      "Serve by plating ravioli, drizzle with brown butter sauce, and garnish with grated Parmigiano-Reggiano and Meyer lemon zest."

If you add it now our meal will have a milder taste. \n\nNow decide if you would like your sauce with the vegetables or you will serve it on the side. I have personally done both always depends what I feel for but if you have children I recommend to add it to the sauce since they seem not be too keen \nOn seeing just the vegetables on their own.",

      "1. For the Tete de Cochon: Make enough equilibrium brine to fully submerge the two halves of the pig's head. Include lemon peel, onion, garlic, thyme, parsley, bay leaves and black peppercorn to flavor the brine. Brine the head overnight",
      "2. Preheat the oven to 325\u00b0F. Place a medium rondeau over medium heat and add olive oil to coat the bottom of the pan. Add the onions, celery, and carrot to the pan and sweat the vegetables until they start to become tender. Add the garlic and cook for another few minutes until the garlic is fragrant. Add the red wine to the pot and bring to a boil to burn off the alcohol and reduce slightly. Add the San Marzano tomatoes and stir to combine. Season with salt and bring the sauce to a simmer",
      "3. Place each side of the split head into a hotel pan and cover with the sauce. Place a piece of cut parchment onto each hotel pan, pressing onto the surface of the sauce and pig's head. Cover the hotel pans with foil to tightly seal. Place the hotel pans in the oven and braise for 31/2 hours until the heads are completely fork-tender. When the heads are cool enough to handle, pick the meat and return it to the sauce, discarding the bones. Transfer the sauce to a large saucepot and hold warm",
      "4. For the Sangue Tagliatelle: In a mixer outfitted with a dough hook, combine the blood and \"00\" semolina flour and a few pinches of salt. Mix on low speed to start until the dough begins to form, gradually increase the speed until the dough forms a ball. Cover tightly in plastic wrap and rest for at least 30 minutes. Divide the pasta into workable amounts and dust the dough and your working surface with flour to prevent sticking. Run the dough through the largest setting on a pasta machine and decrease the settings as you go, rolling the pasta thinner with each pass until you have a length of dough about 18-inches long. Book the pasta by folding it in on itself. Rotate the dough 90\u00b0 and repeat this step two more times to build lamination. Roll the pasta out to the desired thickness and length and hand-cut the pasta into ribbons. Hold the cut pasta on a parchment-lined sheet tray, dusted with flour. Keep the pasta covered to keep it from drying out",
      "5. To assemble the dish: Return the sauce to a simmer and fold in the butter, stirring to incorporate and emulsify. Taste and re-season if needed. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and cook the pasta in batches. Add the pasta directly to the pot of sauce, using a bit of pasta water as needed to thin and balance the sauce. Season the pasta with lemon juice and fold in chopped chervil to finish",
      "Note: Crispy pig's ears can be made by cooking the ears with a circulator set to 190\u00b0F for eight hours. Remove the ears, cool fully, pat dry, cut into strips and deep fry."

Soak the gelatine in the cold water. Dissolve the sugar in the juice and boil up to 240 F or the soft ball stage. Add the lemon juice and gelatine. Re-heat to 240 F and pour into a tin previously rinsed in cold water. If the colour is pale add a few drops of cochineal before the end, but fresh fruit should give a brilliant colour. When set, loosen the sides with a hot knife and",
      "Crystallising: CRYSTALLISING CANDIED FRUIT (This is the chapter that the author said to use for crystallising the jellies. I assume where it says fruit you would substitute jellies.) A sparkling finish is much sought after in this class of sugar work, so here are two recipes-one very simple, the other correct and of lasting quality. SIMPLE CRYSTALLISING Dip each fruit very quickly into boiling water-just in and out-drain it on blotting-paper or butter muslin. Have ready sufficient sieved granulated sugar spread upon a sheet of paper to accommodate the fruits. Roll them gently about in the sugar until completely coated. Leave in a dry, warm situation for some hours to reduce any moisture. They will have a s",
      "Place one rack in the baking tin, arrange the fruits upon it so that they do not touch each other or the side of the pan. Place the second rack feet upwards upon the fruits, holding them gently in place. Cut a piece of greaseproof paper the exact size of the interior of your saucepan. Fold it across and across, then nip the centre point out leaving a hole about 1\" in diameter. Make a syrup by dissolving 2 pounds of granulated sugar in 1 pint",
      "(20 ounces) of water. This is your basic recipe- increase it proportionately if the amount will not cover the fruits in the tin. They must be entirely immersed. Bring the syrup to a boil and strain it through muslin wrung out in hot water. Return the syrup to the saucepan, bringing it up rapidly to 220-225 F, remembering that the higher temperature gives larger crystals, and is good for imposing fruits, while 220 F gives finer crystals suitable for cherries, grapes and nuts. Put the pan where it won't be jarred in the slighest degree, covering the actural syrup with the prepared circle of paper. Steam will escape through the central hole.",
      "Agitation of the pan will result in a \"grainy\" syrup, so tread warily. When slightly cool-about 15 minutes-tilt the saucepan so that the syrup flows gently around and over the fruits held down by the wire cake rack. Cover with a cloth and leave for at least 12 hours. Then, if you have a crystallising tray, draw off the liquid. Otherwise, gently lift your tray of fruits from the baking tin. In eigher case place the fruits in a warm cupboard to thoroughly dry off once more. They should be covered with shimmering crystals of a size to suit your taste, according to the original temperature of the syrup. You will be left with a quantity of syrup which cannot be used again for crystallising. It can, however be used to make delicious toffee or to sweeten"

Remove the giblets if there are any from inside the turkey and then massage the paste into the bird cavity, inside and out, reserving around a spoonful.
