It's often a good idea to peel it.: *Whether or not to salt and drain eggplant before cooking remains a matter of dispute, too. Some say you should salt slices heavily and drain them on paper towels for an hour to rid the eggplant of any bitterness; others feel it's an unnecessary step. What is indisputably true is that eggplant that has been salted and drained will absorb less oil during frying than eggplant that has not.",

      "STEP 1 HAND FORM & SEASON: In a large mixing bowl, combine 1 pound ground sirloin with 1/4 cup grated Spanish onion, 1 1/2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce, and 1/4 teaspoon kosher or sea salt. With clean hands, mix gently until the ingredients are well combined. (Hand working helps the burger stay together.) Pack a 1/2-cup measuring cup with beef. Remove and mold into a slightly flattened patty about 1 inch thick. Place the burgers on a platter and grind 1/8 teaspoon pepper over them. Flip them and grind another 1/8 teaspoon pepper on top.",
      "STEP 2 START YOUR GRILL: A charcoal or gas grill by far gives you the best flavor, but you can also use a grill pan. Whatever method you're using, always start with a clean grill.",
      "For charcoal or hardwood: Ignite the coal or wood, and bring the coals to an even red flame. For a gas grill, heat grill to a high heat and rub grate with a folded-up paper towel dipped in olive oil (use tongs to hold the paper towel). Reduce the flame to medium. Never char your burger--it can create harmful carcinogens.",
      "STEP 3 COOK THE BURGERS: Place burgers on grill; cook 5 minutes. Flip burgers, cover the grill, and continue cooking for another 4-5 minutes for medium doneness. (Make sure internal temperature reaches 160\u00b0.) Don't press the burger down with a spatula, or you'll squeeze the flavorful juices out (and risk creating the aforementioned carcinogens). For cheeseburgers, now is the time to top the burger with a slice of reduced-fat cheese such as Swiss, Muenster, or Cheddar. Using tongs or a heatproof spatula, transfer burgers to a clean plate or platter.",
      "STEP 4 DRESS 'EM UP: While burgers are cooking (or before you start), put a condiment plate together. When you go with low-fat meat, you need to up the flavor in other ways. Try add-ons like thinly sliced onions, sliced ripe tomatoes, and fresh romaine lettuce leaves, all of which add extra nutrients, too. And don't forget the ketchup, Dijon mustard, relish, and sliced dill pickles. When burgers are cooked, place on the bottom half of each of 4 whole-wheat hamburger buns. Dress up your burger, cover with the top half of the bun, and enjoy."

      "Lightly butter a 10- by 15-in. baking pan. In a small bowl, stir baking soda in vanilla to dissolve; set aside. In another bowl, stir together cinnamon and salt (to help the cinnamon distribute evenly when it's stirred into the sugar mixture).",
      "In a 4- to 5-qt. saucepan over medium-low heat, use a heatproof spatula or wooden spoon to stir together sugar, 1/2 cup water, corn syrup, and 1/4 cup butter until butter is melted and sugar is completely dissolved (see aAACaramelizing Sugar: Watch Closely,aAA? below). Increase heat to medium and boil sugar mixture, stirring occasionally, until it turns a deep amber and measures 335\u00b0 to 340\u00b0 on a candy thermometer (see aAAUsing a Candy Thermometer,aAA? below), 8 to 12 minutes.",
      "Remove sugar mixture from heat and carefully stir in vanilla and cinnamon mixtures (they will bubble up). Immediately stir in pumpkin seeds and pour into prepared pan, using spatula or wooden spoon to evenly spread and fill pan. Let brittle cool at room temperature for 30 to 40 minutes.",
      "Gently twist pan to release brittle (if necessary, run a heatproof spatula underneath brittle to help release it), then chop or break it into chunks. Store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 weeks.",
      "Caramelizing sugar: Watch closely. Sugar cooks quickly once it begins to brown, so have your ingredients measured and your tools assembled before you start. Before bringing your sugar mixture to a boil, make sure you completely dissolve the sugar and melt the butter: Stir the mixture with a flexible heatproof spatula over medium-low heat, running the spatula around the inside of the saucepan a few times to thoroughly mix everything together.",
      "Using a candy thermometer",
      "It can be tricky to know when a sugar mixture has reached the temperature that will yield the texture you're after. Thankfully, candy thermometers eliminate the guesswork. You'll find them at supermarkets and some hardware stores; make sure to choose one that measures temperatures up to 400\u00b0.",
      "Test it first: If you have an old thermometer in the back of your gadget drawer, test its accuracy by immersing it in boiling water; it should read 212\u00b0. (If it doesn't, get a new thermometer.) Our favorite in the test kitchen is the Taylor Classic Candy and Deep-Fry Analog Thermometer ($13; available at housewares and home improvement stores), an inexpensive model that's easy to read and attaches securely to the pan's side.",
      "Read it accurately: Attach the thermometer to the side of the pan after the sugar mixture has come to a boil. The placement of the heat sensor varies among brands, but generally the bottom of the thermometer must be completely submerged in the sugar mixture to get an accurate reading. If the mixture is too shallow, carefully tilt the pan until liquid completely covers the bottom of the thermometer when you want to check the temperature.",
      "Note: Nutritional analysis is per oz.",
      "To toast raw green pumpkin seeds-often labeled pepitas in Latino markets-bake in a 350\u00b0 oven until they start to pop, 8 to 10 minutes."

One of the most important red grapes in Italy, barbera in this country has mostly disappeared into generic red wine blends--until recently. Now winemakers are capitalizing on the grape's beautifully high level of acidity (it makes a fantastic food wine) and spicy cherry flavors, and they are bottling it on its own. In the Sierra Foothills, for some reason, barbera often has an edge of cinnamon that makes a lovely link to this pork. You couldn't go wrong with the 2007 Terra d'Oro Barbera from Amador County ($18), with a rush of sweet red fruit and warm spices. --Sara Schneider"

Slide the pizza onto the stone and bake until bubbling on top and the crust is deeply golden, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer the pizza to a cutting board, sprinkle with basil and cut into wedges.
