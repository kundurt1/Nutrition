Reserve 1-2 cups broth and add it while reheating on medium-low. * This is what I did for garnish per serving. When the butter and olive oil were hot, I cooked some pretty slices of cremini and reserved them. On each serving I drizzled about 1 tsp cream, eyedroppered very few drops of truffle oil, sprinkled a couple of thyme leaves, and floated a reserved mushroom slice."

    "title": "african lamb couscous from mauritania",
    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "In a large stew pot that has a tight fitting lid, brown the meat by stirring quickly in hot oil or butter. Reduce heat and saute the onions and garlic until golden. Add vegetables, stirring for 2 to 3 minutes. Cover with about 2 cups water, put the lid on the pot, and simmer until vegetables are tender and meat is cooked. Mix the dates, raisins, and chickpeas into the dry couscous, and steam. Serve by ladling the stew over couscous on individual plates. Serves 6 to 8.",
      "COUSCOUS: There are several ways of steaming and softening this form of semolina wheat that is a base for north African stews. The preferred method is to use a couscousier.",
      "If you don't have a couscousier here is a method. Get dry couscous grain in an ethnic or gourmet grocery or a natural foods store. Allow 2 oz. per person for a meal.",
      "Pour the couscous into a large bowl and cover it with cold Iwater. Stir, and let it sit for about 10 minutes. Then scrape the damp grain out onto a clean absorbent cloth such as a linen dish towel. (If all the water hasn't been soaked up, you should drain it off first.) Leave the grain to swell for 15 minutes. If you prefer, you can leave the grains in the bowl, but as they are more confined, they may not become quite as fluffy.",
      "Now you must find a way to steam the couscous. A colander that will sit part way down into a pot, without sinking to the bottom, can become a homemade couscousier. But if your colander, like most, has holes too large to prevent the couscous grains from falling through, you must line it with a clean, porous cloth (cheesecloth) When everything is ready, bring water in the pot to a boil, and steam the couscous, uncovered, for 20 minutes.",
      "Now the couscous must swell and steam a second time, but with slight variations. Once again, put it into a bowl or onto the towel. Sprinkle cold water over it-perhaps half a cup for every pound of couscous-and rub grains between your fingers to break up any lumps that have formed. After it has sat for 10 minutes, rub some oil onto your hands and rework the grains with your fingers. (For special occasions, use butter to grease and separate the grains.).",
      "Finely, steam the couscous for 25 more minutes, and serve hot.",
      "There is nothing complicated about this process, but it does take some time.",
      "If it sounds too ambitious, try the packaged, pre-cooked grain that is widely available where couscous is sold and follow the simple directions on the box. True connoisseurs argue, no doubt that you will never know what real couscous tastes like unless you steam your own. The \"instant\" kind is acceptable though.",

For the broth, In a medium size sauce pan (enough to add the 4 fillets and you want the broth to cover the fish), add the lemons, garlic cloves (give them a light smash with the back of your knife or with the palm of your hand), ginger, wine, broth, thyme sprigs, and peppercorns. Bring to a boil and then immediately turn off the heat and cover. The broth will be ready in just a couple of minutes.",

Slowly add in the milk and heavy cream and whisk until well blended and the sauce begins to thicken. Add in the celery, fresh thyme, salt and pepper to taste. The sauce is done. Just reduce to low and set on the back burner.",
      "Fish -- Bring your broth back up to medium heat, you don't want it boiling, just a medium simmer. Add the fish, reduce to medium low and cover. Halibut will take about 8 minutes per 1\" of fish. The cooking time will depend on the size of your fish fillets.",
      "Tomato Relish -- As the fish cooks, make the tomato relish. Add the chopped tomatoes, capers, basil, olive oil, and pepper to a small bowl and mix until well combined.",
      "Serve -- This is how I love to serve this dish. A small bed of micro greens or spring greens, then the fish topped with the celery sauce and then the tomato relish. But you can omit the greens if you want. I have also served the sauce on the bottom of the plate with the tomato relish on top and the micro greens on the side. Either way -- ENJOY!"

      "If you have a cast iron jambalaya pot use it, if not you can use a magnalite or a very large oval pot to cook the Pastalaya. Start by browning the pork first. Brown it until it makes like a crust on the bottom. Set it aside in a large bowl. Next, brown the sausage. After you brown the sausage set it aside also in the same bowl as the pork. Then, add the chopped onions in the pot that you just browned all the meats inches Add just a little of chicken broth to release the flavor from the bottom of the pot that the meat made. This will turn the onions like a caramel color. Add cream of mushroom soup and beef gravy to onions. Stir till well blended. Add meats. Let this mixture come to a slight boil. Next, add chicken broth. You will not use both cans of broth. Add enough until it is about 2 inches from rim of pot. Let mixture come to a boil. Add the stick of butter. Add Tony's seasoning to taste. To know that you have seasoned it well, when you taste it, it will pick your throat. It may taste like a lot of seasoning, but you will need it to make it have a good taste. After this mixture comes to a rolling boil, add pasta. Break the pasta in half. Stir with a pasta utensil. Let it come to a boil again then, lower the fire and cover it, stirring it occasionally. Keep checking the pasta by tasting it to see if it is cooked. It should be tender just like when you cook spaghetti. This makes a lot. It will feed at least 10-15 people. ENJOY!"

The leaves and bark can also be used to treat whooping cough, ordinary coughs, and chronic bronchitis. Peach seed (kernel) can be used as a mild laxative, and an expectorant for the lungs, nose and throat, and it can help relieve chest pain and spasms. Peach bark is still used to improve blood flow and eliminate blood stagnation caused by amenorrhea, dysmenorrhea, postpartum abdominal pain, and pain and swelling due to external injuries.",
