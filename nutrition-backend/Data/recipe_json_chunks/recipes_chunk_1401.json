Squeeze in as many as you can because they will reduce slightly in size as they cook. Trim one pear half to fit in the middle.",

Return them to the high heat and cook until the sugar is a deep caramel brown, about 5 minutes.",

When the pears are done, remove the pan from the heat and carefully drape the dough over the pan. Taking care not to burn your fingers, tuck the edge of the dough along the side of the pan. If you have measured accurately, the dough should just fit with a bit extra to slip down into the sides. If you do what I usually do and roll it a bit too big, just squeeze it into the pan. Don't worry if the dough is a bit lumpy because this will be the underside of the tart when you are done. Place the pan in the oven and let it cook until the crust is lightly browned, 25 to 30 minutes.",

Stir into the flour until dough just comes together. Turn out onto a floured surface and knead it a couple times before patting it into a 1 inch thick rectangle. Cut into 6 squares and place on top of the fruit. Brush with the heavy cream and sprinkle with sliced almonds and turbinado sugar, if using. Bake for 12-15 minutes, until biscuits are golden brown and fruit is bubbling. Let stand for at least 30 minutes before serving."

Form the dough gently into 2 loose balls, wrap tightly in plastic wrap, and chill in the fridge for a minimum of 3 hours or as long as overnight (obviously, overnight is best - I sometimes let this dough sit for 36 hours).",
      "At this point, you can use this pie crust to make whatever pie you like, or you can use all of the dough to make cookies, or even freeze half of the dough and use the other half to make cookies.",
      "Preheat your oven to 375 degrees F to make the cookies, let the dough sit out on the counter for a few minutes so you can roll it out more easily. Roll the dough out to about 3/4-inch thick, then cut out into your favorite shapes. Place the cookies on parchment lined baking sheets - you can place them pretty close together because they won't rise or spread much. Brush the cookies with your egg wash, combine the sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl, then sprinkle all of the cookies with this mixture.",
      "Bake the cookies for 15-20 minutes, until golden and flaky. Allow to cool slightly, then remove from the pans. Enjoy these warm alongside some ice cream or cooled, all on their own. These will keep well at room temperature in an air-tight container or sealed bag for up to 3 days."

You can spread it on toasted slices of French bread and serve it with aperitifs; serve it as an hors d'oeuvre with raw vegetables and hard boiled eggs or use it as the basis for a sandwich. Spread it on a long thin baguette of French bread, split in half and lightly toasted, then layer the sandwich with slices of tomato, hard-boiled eggs, sweet spring onions and a few anchovy fillets (or chunks of well-drained canned tuna).

      "Remove cardamom pods from cream. Add cream and cognac to caramel mixture. Take off heat and stir.",
      "To make the Cardamom Ice Cream, place the milk vanilla bean and crushed cardamom pods in a heavy pan and slowly bring to a boil. Remove from heat, cover and let infuse for 20 minutes. Take out vanilla bean and scrape seeds into liquid. Strain cardamom seeds.",

Stir until the custard is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon; this may take approximately 10 minutes. Do not boil.",
      "Remove the pan from the heat and continue to stir until it has almost cooled. Fold the cream and the ground cardamom into the custard. Freeze entire mixture in an ice cream maker following the manufacturer's instructions.

      "The night before: make the biga. Warm 400ml of unchlorinated water in a pot or in the microwave until it is comfortable on the fingertips and not stinging. If it is stinging to the touch, it is too hot for the yeast. Place the yeast in the warm water, stir and allow to sit for 5-10mins--until it is foamy on top.",
      "While waiting for the yeast to bloom, measure out the 500g of AP Flour in a bowl twice the size that you think you need.",
      "Mix until the flour is well-incorporated. If it is lumpy, do not worry! This is only the pre-ferment. Cover tightly with clingfilm and leave in a dark corner of your kitchen overnight--at least 12 hours.",
      "The next morning--or 12 hours later--the biga should be near the top of the bowl and almost bursting at the seams of the plastic wrap. When you peel back the plastic wrap, it should smell a touch pungent and sour.",
      "Now, warm the 100ml milk in a saucepan or in the microwave until it is comfortable to the touch and pour into the bowl of a stand mixer. Mix in the rest of the yeast and allow to bloom for 5-10 minutes. Do not worry if this yeast is not foamy on top. After 5-10 minutes, add the 300ml of warm water, 1.5 tbsp of oil and measured biga. Mix with paddle attachment of stand mixer until blended.",
      "Slowly add the mixture of AP flour and bread flour with salt into the stand mixer. Continue with paddle attachment on low speed until the flour is incorporated.",
      "Stop the mixer, move it near a power outlet on the floor, switch to the dough hook and scrape down the sides of the bowl. Turn the mixer to power level 5 or 6. The mixing/kneading will be vigorous and your stand mixer will \"walk,\" hence why we took it off of the counter. Allow to knead at this high speed until it comes away cleanly from the bottom of the bowl--approx. 10-20mins.",
      "Lightly oil a large glass bowl and transfer the dough. It should be soft and wet, but not overly sticky. Cover with clingfilm. Allow to rise for 1-1.5 hours. In the meantime, prepare two baking trays, by covering them with parchment paper.",
      "When doubled in size, turn the dough out onto a generously floured cutting board. Be gentle! You want to reserve as much air in the dough as possible. That is what makes these loaves so ethereal and light. Now, dust the top with flour.",
      "Using two dough scrapers, divide the dough in half. Make the first half into 4 loaves. And the second half into 8 buns or 12 rolls. With each loaf/bun/roll cut, carefully tuck the edges underneath while lifting with your dough scrapers and place gently onto one of your prepared trays. This process creates those beautiful rolled edges on the ciabattas.",
      "Cover the trays with light kitchen towels and allow to rise for 30mins. And preheat your oven to 425f.",
      "When the loaves have risen enough, you should be able to poke them with your fingertip and the indentation does not bounce back. If you are at this point, put your buns/rolls into the oven first (because the larger loaves will most likely need an extra 20 minutes of rising). And before you close the oven door, toss a single ice cube into the bottom of your oven--this will provide enough steam to create a delicate crust. Set your timer for 20-25 minutes.",
      "Check on your bread, once they are golden brown on top, remove from the oven. They should feel light for their size and sound hollow when tapped on the bottom. If you are satisfied, remove from the tray to a cooling rack. And repeat.",
      "Here is the hard part. Allow to cool completely before indulging. The slightly sour flavor really develops as they cool and it is better if you wait! Trust me."

Cut green onion stalks in half lengthwise, then finely slice. Drain bulgur and place in a large bowl; add vegetables and lemon juice to bulgur and mix to combine; let sit together for 10 minutes.",

Handfuls at a time, line up where the parsley stems split into leaves and then chop between the split and the leaves. Reserve the thick stems for another use (I like to freeze and use for stock) and finely slice the leaves; add to bowl. (Note: don't use the food processor to chop your herbs. Even though the desire may be strong since you're using it later in the recipe, resist. Using the food processor for your herbs will get you pesto, not tabouli).",
      "Add the olive oil, spices and salt; stir. Feel free to tweak the seasoning to your liking. Cover and refrigerate (Can be made a day ahead, which helps the flavors blend and bulgur absorb some of the juices).",
      "Put ground beef, onion, garlic, spices, salt and pepper in food processor. Work quickly so that your meat remains as cold as possible (you could even pop the meat and veggies in the freezer for a few minutes to boost the cold and help combat the heat your food processor will generate). Puree until the mix is good and smooth, stopping to scrape down the sides. In a 9 x 13 inch baking dish, form into a 1 inch-high meatloaf, doing your best to square off the sides for uniform slicing later. Cover and refrigerate for a couple hours or as long as overnight.",
      "Preheat oven to 325 degrees. Cook until internal temperature reads 160, about an hour. Let cool in pan set on rack. (Can be made ahead to this point and refrigerated for a week).",
      "Reduce oven heat to 200. Cut cooked loaf into 1/8 to 1/4 inch thick slices. Heat a skillet over medium high heat with a teaspoon of olive oil; once hot add in doner loaf slices 3 at a time and cook until crisp on the outside, about 2 minutes per side. Move cooked slices to oven to keep warm.",
      "Wipe out skillet with a paper towel, add in a touch more olive oil. Toast bread in skillet, a couple minutes per side. Split bread and put several slices of doner meat, a sprinkling of feta cheese, and a scoop of tabouli. If you're using a denser bread or something like a baguette that's a little thicker, use a spoon to scoop out some of the bread on the inside. Repeat with remaining bread and fillings.",
      "Notes: 1) Feel free to improvise with other fillings. You could mix full-fat greek yogurt and some dill and spread that on one side of your toasted bread, or layer your cooked beef with some shredded cabbage for crunch. Make a spread of various fillings and have a doner sandwich party! 2) You're going to have leftover tabouli, which is never a bad thing. You can make yourself another Whiteway classic the next morning: tabouli topped scrambled eggs. With a strong cup of black coffee. That's the stuff."

Heat oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Pan fry plantains flipping over halfway through cooking time until cooked through and they can be pierced with a fork ( ~ 3-5 minutes total). They won't be fork tender but they will be able to be pierced. Don't overcook. It's fine to brown a little but you're not going for dark brown. Remove from pan and blot dry with paper towels.",

Pulse again so the onion mixture is well incorporated. The plantain mixture is starchy, and easy to form into cakes, but they will dry out if not pan frying right away, so cover well. Reheat the oil in the frying pan over medium-high heat. When the oil is hot, gently lay the plantain cakes in the hot oil and brown on both sides. They're best when a beautiful brown crust forms.

      "Next ground down loose Lapsang Souchong tea. If you do not have a pestle and mortar, use a bowl and spoon to break up the tea as best you can into a coarse powder. You can also break tea up by using your clean fingers. Roll in between thumb and forefinger. Tea will aways be coarse using these methods.",
      "Now it is time to cook. Using whatever cooking dish or pan you prefer begin seasoning the Chicken. It does not matter in which order you choose to season your meat. Now you have removed the excess water off the chicken (leaving some moisture). Sprinkle the chicken with the above ingrediences( one at a time or you can place all DRY ingrediences into a shaker or bowl and season your meat. Always remember use the ingrediences to whatever your taste buds require. And do not heavily season all at once. Gradually increase seasoning to taste as you taste. A good cook always taste their creation as they go alone and before the finale. Viola!",
      "Using your dry ingredience season your chicken front and back or inside and outside. The seasoning should then be rubbed into the piecing holes.",
      "Then after all of your seasoning has been added to initial taste, spray , drizzle or rub oil onto chicken so that the dry ingredience will absorb some of the oil. DO NOT OVER OIL. For butter users let butter set until soft or you can melt butter down and let cool. Gently rub your whole chicken with the oil or butter to aid in an even tone color when cooking. The aroma should be slightly drifting upwards from the oily uncooked bird.",
      "NOW! it is time to cook. Once you have place it in the oven at 350 degrees you will begin to smell the garlic as the bird heats up. About 20 mins for chicken breast or until done but moist. Whole chicken about 1 hour or until done depending on size. REMEMBER to check chicken periodically to insure it is not getting over cooked. Save your drippings from the cooked bird it makes excellent gravy.",
      "Viola! Now add Rice or Potatoes and a Green Vegetable and dinner is served. Happy eating."

      "Notes: \r\n- I always double grind the meat when I'm making meatballs; it yields a more tender, juicy meatball that is less likely to fall apart when you cook it. I either ask the butcher to do it for me or just throw regular ground meat in my food processor for about 20 seconds to get a finer texture and more even distribution of fat. Of course, it's not the end of the world if you don't double-grind the meat, but I find it makes a much better meatball. \r\n- If you don't have a food processor, you can ask your butcher to double grind the chicken. Grate the zucchini on the large holes of a box grater before salting and draining. Then mince the garlic by hand and roughly chop the herbs before adding them to the ground chicken. \r\n- These meatballs freeze beautifully. Once you have them formed, put them on a parchment-lined sheet pan and place them in the freezer. Once frozen, transfer the meatballs to a resealable bag. They will keep for up to two months in the freezer. They can be browned from frozen, but will require more time in the oven.\r\n- If you don't need these meatballs to be gluten-free, you can replace the almond meal with dried breadcrumbs.",

Transfer the chicken mixture to the bowl with the zucchini. Add the green onion, 1 more teaspoon of salt, the parmesan, almond meal, ground cumin, chile flakes and egg. Mix well to combine.

Once your tofu is light brown on at least two sides (it's hard to get all four, but if you can go for it!), sprinkle on your garam masala. You want each piece to get a dose of garam masala, but with tofu you can't just stir everything around because your cubes will break. If you use extra-firm tofu that is less likely to happen, but I prefer the mouthfeel of firm. Once you've sprinkled your garam masala on all the tofu, keep on sauteeing for another minute, turning the pieces over so the spices get stuck on the tofu via sauteeing in butter. Set aside.",

Chocolate chips, dark or white, yes indeed.",

Soft cheeses don't work well for the same reason fresh fruits do not. If you want to serve them as an hors d'oeuvre with some sort of dip or spread, shape the dough into a rectangle a couple of inches wide, and cut the scones into \"fingers\". Brush with cream and sprinkle with some good sea salt. Use your imagination, and have fun with them!"

      "Drain the ricotta cheese for at least an hour before using. The cheese should be dry and cakey before using. To do this, line a colander with a damp piece of cheesecloth and place the ricotta cheese on it. You can also gently squeeze the ricotta between paper towels if it's still wet after an hour.",
      "Blanch the spinach for 3 minutes in boiling salted water. Remove and drain. When cool enough to handle, press and squeeze as much moisture out as you can. Roll in a towel and squeeze the last bit of moisture out. Remove from towel and chop. Set aside.",
      "Combine the cheeses together using only 2 ounces of the parmesan cheese, reserving the rest for later. Fold in the proscuitto and pine nuts. Set aside while you make the bechamel base. I do a slightly browned butter bechamel for this filling. Melt the butter in a small pot over medium heat and wait until it's a soft golden brown before adding the flour. Whisk the flour in and cook for about 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and gradually add the half and half, constantly whisking the mixture. Once the mixture is completely smooth, place the pot back on the heat and cook until the mixture is thickened, about 10 minutes. Remove from the heat again and fold in the cheese mixture. Add the nutmeg, salt and pepper to taste. Set aside.",
      "Preheat the oven to 400F. Set a large pot of salted water to boil. Cook the lasagna according to the instructions on the box, cooking until it is just al dente. Run under cool water and aside until cool enough to handle while you make the tomato sauce.",
      "Heat the olive oil in a large saute pan and cook the sausage and saute until crumbly and cooked through. Remove with a slotted spoon and set aside.",
      "Add olive oil to the pan if necessary and saute the onion and pepper. Once they begin to soften (about 15 minutes), add the garlic and oregano. Cook 1 minute.",
      "Add the wine and cook until almost completely absorbed. Add the basil, sausage, pesto, tomatoes and juices from one can, and tomato paste. Cook until thickened, about 20 minutes while you make the lasagna rolls.",
      "To make the lasagna rolls, lay out each noodle individually on a work space. Spoon 2-3 tablespoons of cheese filling onto the noodle and smooth out along the noodle. Starting at one end, roll each noodle up.",
      "When the sauce is ready, spoon some sauce onto the bottom of a 8\" X 8\" baking pan. Make sure the bottom is completely covered. Place the lasagna rolls in the dish, seam side down. If you use artichoke bottoms, they go down first with the lasagna rolls laying on top. Ladle more sauce around and on top of the lasagna rolls and bake until starting to bubble (about 25 minutes). Sprinkle the rest of the parmesan cheese on top and bake another 5 minutes. Remove from the oven.",
      "To serve, use a large serving spoon to lift each lasagna roll (and artichoke bottom, if using) onto a plate. Ladle some of the sauce around it. Serve with garlic bread and a fresh green salad and enjoy!"

      "Wrap the half batches of dough separately and chill overnight (or 2-3 hours, until nice and cold).",
      "While the cookie dough is chilling, crush the candy canes with a few tablespoons of sugar until you have a fine pink powder speckled with tiny red shards. Using a food processor doesn't work well because the candy canes stick to the blades. It helps to freeze the candy cane for 20 - 30 minutes before crushing them. I break the candy cane into a few pieces and then line those up in the bottom of a tough (freezer) zipper lock bag, add a couple tablespoons of white sugar to the bag, and roll the bag around the candy three or four times. I hit the bag five or six times with a French rolling pin -- others have suggested using a hard mallet -- and then pick out the large pieces of candy canes, pour most of the small bits and powder into a small bowl, and then return the larger pieces to the bag and repeat the process, a few times if necessary.",
      "When ready to bake, heat oven to 350 degrees (or 325 if using a convection oven and your manufacturer recommends that reduction). Line two cookie sheets with parchment.",
      "Take heaping tablespoons of each dough, roll them (separately) into 6 -7\" logs between your palms, then twist a pink strip with a plain strip and form into a candy cane shape, flattening very slightly onto the parchment lined baking sheet. Leave about 2 inches between canes. The dough is harder to work with when very warm, so if you are working with children or otherwise not working quickly, keep a portion of the dough in the fridge until you use it.",
      "Bake for about 10 minutes, until very slightly browned on the edges. Remove and allow to cool on the cookie sheet.",
      "While the cookies are still warm, sprinkle them with the pink candy cane and sugar powder, pressing very gently to help it melt and thus adhere. Allow them to finish cooling on a wire rack.",
      "I hope you enjoy these. ;o)",
      "N.B. I take a somewhat industrial approach to shaping these, adopting the following efficiency-increasing procedures. I first plop little lumps of chilled dough onto a parchment lined sheet, making an effort to keep them uniform, and truing up any that aren't. I also check to make sure I have equal numbers of pink and white! I roll the dough between my palms into logs, but when they're about 3 inches long, put them down onto another cookie sheet (parchment covered) and quickly roll them back and forth on the sheet, using flattened fingers. This shapes them more evenly. Once all the logs are rolled, I wrap and shape all at once.",
      "Also, for those of you who take a project management approach to your holiday baking, organizing your time spent to achieve efficiencies by grouping like tasks together: it works particularly well to prep your candy canes for these cookies at the same time you're breaking candy canes for peppermint bark."

Cover the pan and cook for a few minutes, without stirring until the sugar is dissolved. Uncover the pot and cook without stirring until the syrup begins to color slightly. Swirl the pan gently rather than stirring if the syrup is colors unevenly. Use the tip of a knife or skewer to drop a bead of syrup on the plate from time to time. When a drop looks pale amber, add the nuts. Turn them gently with a clean dry wooden spoon or silicone spatula until they are completely coated with syrup.

When the nuts are still quite warm, but not to hot to handle, break the brittle into a few pieces and transfer it (still quite warm and still on the parchment) into a zipper lock bag or airtight container.

Remove it from the heat as soon as a genuine boil (bubbles all over the surface) is achieved.\r\n\r\n2. It's important to use cane sugar, because I've found beet sugar makes a grainy custard."

Cool in the pan on a wire rack for about 10 minutes, and run a knife around the inside of the pan to release the cake. Remove from the pan and transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.",
      "Add the remaining 1 tsp of olive oil to the small bowl containing the reserved tamarind. Sift in the confectioners' sugar and whisk until completely smooth. Pour the glaze over the cooled loaf and let it sit for 1 hour to set before serving.",
      "A note on the approach: A high-speed blender is a marvelous tool to use for olive oil cakes because it can quickly whip air and emulsify the liquids in the batter to create a delicate cake crumb. This cake is first spiced with ginger and black pepper and sweetened with jaggery, adding contrast to the tamarind and dates in the batter, and then finally drizzled with a tamarind glaze to add a pop of fruitiness. I prefer to use the sour tamarind found in the Asian grocery stores rather than the sweeter Mexican variety because its stronger flavor comes through better in baking."

When the potatoes are done, drain and put them in a bowl of ice water too.",

I always make my dressings in a jar because with a lid on tight, you can really give it a good shake and prove to the world that even oil and vinegar can sometimes mix. So put your garlic into a small jar with the juice of half the lemon and the rest of the ingredients. Shake until it is creamy. Taste and adjust seasonings.",

This salad is really happy company to just about any of Spring's edible delights so let your garden or your local farmer inspire your whims.",

For directions on how to do that, see David Liebowitz's website. \r\nhttp://www.davidlebovitz.com/2005/08/tempering-choco/\r\nYou may also simply melt the chocolate by placing it in a large bowl and microwaving it for 30 seconds at a time. Stir well between each round in the microwave.",
      "Once the chocolate is ready, prepare your chocolate cups. Keep all the cups in a stack, but loosen the top one. With a pastry brush (silicone works great), coat the inside of the cup with melted chocolate. Set aside and continue doing the same with all of the cups. Whatever chocolate is leftover, set aside and you can retemper (or just remelt) for the topping later.",
      "Once the chocolate in the cups has hardened, take your peanut butter mixture and pipe it into the cups, leaving about 1/4 inch at the top. Remelt or retemper the chocolate and either put it in another piping bag or leave it in the bowl. Top the candy cups by piping the chocolate in a spiral from the outside in. Or you can simply spoon the chocolate from the bowl and gently spread it over the tops of the cups.",
      "You may optionally top each cup with a roasted peanut and a sliver of candied ginger. Drop them on the top while the chocolate on top is still melted so that they'll stick.",
      "These peanut cups are considerably creamier than the store-bought kind so it's best to eat them in a single bite. They'll keep for a couple days in a cool, dark place (they'll last a bit longer in the fridge)."

Just make sure it's a pan you don't need to use for other things during the twenty-four hours that the jars are cooling. It's a really safe way to move hot jars, and is so efficient, too!!"

Peel the roasted garlic (carefully - it will be hot, so you may need a fork and knife) and add it to the food processor. Blend until the corn forms a rough paste. Allow to cool about 5-10 minutes (until the corn stops steaming). Add the solid burrata cheese and blend until smooth. Use some of the liquid from the burrata container to thin the cheese-corn mixture if it is thick. It should be smooth and spreadable.",

Sprinkle half of the remaining whole roasted corn kernels over the burrata. Add another layer of pasta sheets and repeat the process. The lasagna should have 2 tomato layers and 2 burrata-corn layers. Spread the top layer of lasagna noodles with any remaining tomato sauce and sprinkle with shredded mozzarella cheese. Cover with tinfoil and bake 30 minutes, rotating every 10 minutes. Turn the heat up to 400 degrees, remove the foil, and bake a final 10 minutes. Allow to cool slightly but serve hot."

If it gets too warm, it will be difficult to handle (very sticky) and will result in edible but not very nice looking pockets so don't allow the pastry stay out too long, thawing before you use it. About 5-6 minutes at room temperature should be sufficient for it to have 'shed' its frozenness.",

And please don't do as I did and heat the pan first.... you'll end up with partially melted butter if you do. So, moving swiftly on, sprinkle the sugar over it (Vanilla sugar would go great if making an Apple version) and then add the cardamoms and chopped ginger.",
      "On a floured surface, roll-out the puff pastry. Since I use pastry sheets, I piece them together and then roll the edges to seal.

      "Then arrange the pears, rounded side down on the butter and sugar and set the tin or pan on medium heat till the sugar melts and begins to bubble. If other areas are browning more than others, move the pan around but do not stir otherwise the mixture WILL NOT caramelise because the sugar will form lumps before it has a chance to melt and liquefy!",
      "As soon as the sugar-butter mix has caramelised, remove the tin or pan carefully from the heat. Don't worry about the pears turning brown on the outside...they'll end up even browner so",

    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "For the sponge, combine the milk, yeast, and sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer (you need a stand mixer). Whisk by hand to dissolve the yeast, then whisk in the eggs and stir in 1 cup of the flour. Sprinkle the remaining 1/3 cup over the top (don't stir it in). Cover and set aside to proof until there are cracks in the top layer of the dough and it's very soft to the touch, about 30 minutes.",
      "To make the dough, add the flour, sugar, salt, eggs, egg yolk, and tahini or peanut butter to the bowl with the sponge. Use a dough hook to mix on low speed until the dough starts to come together. Scrape down the sides, then increase to medium speed and mix until you just see the dough come together around the dough hook, 8 to 10 minutes. It's important that the dough is developed before you incorporate the butter, so try not to rush the process.",
      "Scrape the sides of the bowl, mix again on high speed, then add half the butter, working on medium speed. Once the first half of the butter is incorporated (you no longer see lumps)-this takes minutes, not seconds-add the second half. Continue mixing until the dough is silky smooth, 10 to 15 minutes (when I used peanut butter, this took closer to 20 minutes!). Increase the speed to medium-high and beat until the dough comes off the bowl, about 1 minutes. If you take a little piece of the dough and stretch it, you should see a gluten window, which indicates that the gluten is developed (when I was working with the peanut butter dough, I had to repeat the high-speed minute intervals a few times in order to achieve this elasticity; even then, it was still fragile/delicate).",
      "Lightly flour a bowl or plastic storage container. Scrape the dough into the container and press it out in a flat rectangle. (Since the peanut butter dough was so soft, I used a generous amount of flour both in the bowl, on my hands, and on the dough's surface.) Fold the two sides in to meet in the middle, then flip over and press it out, back into a flat-ish rectangle. Cover and refrigerate for 6 hours, or up to overnight. After refrigerating, you can shape the dough. You can wrap the shaped loaves and freeze them for up to 5 days.",
      "To make the loaves, lightly flour a work surface and butter two 9-inch loaf pans. Divide the dough in half, then roll one half into a 2- by 6-inch rectangle, divide into three long strips, braid together, and tuck into the loaf pan. Repeat with the second piece of dough. (You can also make the second piece of dough into balls, then pile those into the loaf pan.) \r\n\r\nAlternatively, this is a place where you can go wild! Spread jam over the dough then roll it into a log and either tuck that whole roll-up into the pan, or slice into cinnamon bun-like swirls and tuck them in haphazardly (or in an organized fashion).",
      "To make rolls, butter a 9-inch springform. Then divide the dough into 12 pieces and use a cupped hand to gently roll each one in small circular motions against the surface to form a tight ball. Arrange them in the pan in a single layer, with 8 around the circumference and 4 in the center.",
      "Cover whatever you've shaped loosely with plastic wrap and let rise until doubled in size (2 to 2 1/2 hours for the loaves; 1 1/2 to 2 hours for the rolls). To test to see if they've proofed properly, press down on the dough with your finger: It should feel pillowy-soft and spring back almost all the way, still leaving a small indentation.",
      "Heat the oven to 350\u00b0 F. Make an egg wash by whisking together the eggs and the milk. Brush the dough with egg wash and sprinkle sesame seeds over top, if using (flaky salt is also a good addition here). Set on a baking sheet and bake until golden brown, 40 to 45 minutes for the loaves, 15 to 20 minutes for the rolls.",
      "Let the loaves cool in their pans on a wire rack. For the rolls, snap off the outside of the springform pan, then let cool on the pan bottom on a wire rack."

Don't panic while it's mixing in fear that it won't thicken and think you need to add more flour - just let it keep mixing and it will get there on its own.

Set the dough aside until it has risen a little bit and is quite soft to the touch, either a couple of hours at room temperature, or overnight in the refrigerator.

Dust the excess flour from the bomboloni and carefully place them, in batches if necessary depending on the size of your pot, in the hot oil. Fry, turning occasionally, until browned on all sides, about 5 minutes total. Transfer the browned bomboloni to a paper towel-lined plate or tray to drain.

Most kamaboko and gefilte fish are made with a blend of fish-you could even throw in salmon. I highly recommend asking the fishmonger (it will save you loads of time) at the counter to debone, skin and put it through the grinder. You lose about a 1/4 pound to the grinder, so you'll need to purchase a little over a pound to start. If the fishmonger at your local market is not able to do this, carefully debone and skin the fish yourself. Using a food processor, blend until smooth. The other reason I prefer to have the fishmonger do this step for me is that it can be tough on your food processor if you don't have a heavy-duty one.",

Transfer the mixture back to the pot and chill in the fridge until completely cold, preferably 6 hours. This \"resting\" time is supposed to improve the texture of the ice cream.",

If your machine is just an ice-bucket with a spinner like mine, I find that the coldness of the bucket never lasts long enough. So I usually leave the churned ice cream in the bucket and return it back to the freezer. Every 15 min or so, I would go back and fold/knead the ice cream with a spoon or spatula. I find that this improves the texture of the ice cream by making it slightly denser. Repeat for a couple of times then transfer the mixture to a container to harden in the freezer."

Leave it in the oven until the oven cools, an hour or two, or even overnight. Be sure it is dappled with a golden hue or it will need to cook a bit longer. Sometimes, after the hour of baking each side, I'll turn the oven up to 350 F, turning the oven off as soon as it reaches that temperature.

The can should be standing on one side, not rolling around.\r\nNow, I noticed that the can tends to make a lot of noise as the bubbles from the boiling water try to escape from beneath it. One trick, if you happen to have two pairs of tongs lying around, is to prop the can on a tilt by sticking a small ball of tin foil underneath it. This stops the noise.\r\nCover the pot and bring the water to a boil. When water is boiling, uncover pot. Leave the can in the simmering water for at least 2 hours (longer for a firmer caramel - I left it in for 3), and make sure to replenish the water as often as you need to in order to keep the water level at least an inch or so above the can. I had to add about a cup every half hour to 45 minutes.",
      "When 2 hours (or your desired cooking time) have elapsed, turn off the heat and leave the can in the water for at least half an hour, to cool slightly. If you were to remove it immediately, the heat inside the can would overpower the air pressure surrounding it, and it would explode.",

Season with soy sauce and Sriracha to taste. The filling shouldn't be too moist, but the soy sauce adds a lovely flavor.",
      "Keep the wonton skins covered with a moist kitchen towel so they don't dry out. Take one skin at a time and place a teaspoon of filling in the middle. Brush the rim of the skin with a wet finger, then fold the dumpling to a half moon shape, removing any excess air from the inside out as you go. Take the dumpling in your hands and fold in little \"pleats\" now (besides looking neat, they also add extra stability). You might want to make around 6 to 10 dumplings per person, depending on what other additions-like ramen noodles or vegetables-you plan on adding to your soup.",
      "Spread the finished dumplings on a clean kitchen towel and refrigerate until ready to use. You can also freeze them at this point, for later usage.",
      "Start by julienning the ginger. Add it to a large pot together with the vegetable broth and/or miso broth (I used about half and half of each) and the dried shiitake (you'll remove these after cooking). Bring to a boil. This is the basis for the soup that you can now refine, to taste, with soy sauce (for saltiness), Sriracha, or chili powder (for spiciness) etc. Keep the bok choy, julienned carrots and sliced spring onions at the ready as soup additions.",
      "To finish the soup, quickly blanch (in simmering-not boiling-water) the wontons in batches (cook only the ones you will need for your first serving of soup). They're ready when they float on the top, which takes about 2 to 3 minutes. Carefully remove them with a slotted spoon or spider spoon and keep ready on a wooden board (careful, they are quite sticky when blanched) or divide between the bowls. Shortly before serving, add the bok choy and carrots to the broth and heat through, just a few seconds. Ladle the broth into the bowls, adding the vegetables and place the dumplings on top (some might drown, others float on the top, neatly). Sprinkle with spring onions and serve hot.",
      "I always serve the condiments on the side for my guests to customize and refine their soup according to their taste. The things that are essentials for a good Asian (Chinese-Japanese fusion, let's say) broth according to me are: soy sauce, rice wine vinegar, Sriracha, chili powders (I have them in various heats and colors, even a black one that is very fancy and evil looking), sesame seeds and sesame oil, miso powders, and maybe even pickled ginger. You can even put bowls of scallions, sprouts, blanched edamame, shiso sprouts, or herbs (cilantro is nice) on the table for the guests to pick their favorites. For a different-and particularly hearty-version, add some noodles to the dumpling soup. I like rice noodles, udon, or soba, but my favorite is the rumpled and nest-like ramen (the egg yolk-yellow type). You can pick them up at a well-stocked delicatessen or Asian market. They're usually ready in a couple of minutes."

      "Prepare the eggplant: Peel the eggplant and cut lengthwise into long slices, about 1/4 of an inch thick. Layer the slices in a colander. Sprinkle each layer generously with salt. Continue to layer the slices until finished. Allow the eggplant to drain in the sink for a minimum of 30 minutes but you can allow to sit longer while you prepare the sauce.",
      "Make the sauce: Heat the olive oil in a saucepan or skillet over medium heat. Add in the garlic and pinch of hot pepper flakes (if using). Cook until garlic is fragrant being careful to not let brown - about 30 seconds to 1 minute. Add in the diced tomatoes. Allow the sauce to come to a simmer. Cook until the tomatoes break down and the sauce thickens - about 20 minutes. (Allow the sauce to become thick and chunky so the finished dish is not too watery.) Once thickened, season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Chiffonade a few basil leaves (roll lengthwise and cut into little slices.) Stir to combine. Taste and adjust any seasonings.",
      "Roast the eggplant: While the sauce is cooking, preheat the oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit. Lightly coat 2 sheet pans with olive oil. Rinse and dry the eggplant slices. Lay the slices on the pan and brush he tops with additional olive oil. Sprinkle with salt and freshly ground pepper. Bake until soft and golden, about 20 minutes. Check half way through and turn slices. Remove from oven. Allow to cool until possible to handle. Maintain oven temperature.",
      "Assemble and bake: In a baking dish, spread a thin layer of the tomato sauce on the bottom. Layer about 1/3 of the eggplant slices over the tomato sauce. Spread with another thin layer of tomato sauce. Sprinkle with about 1/3 of the mozzarella and a dusting of Parmigiano. Repeat with the remaining eggplant, tomato sauce and cheeses. I give the top an extra dusting of Parmigiano. Bake until the cheese has melted and the sauce is nice and bubbly, about 25 minutes.",
      "Allow the dish to rest for about 15 minutes before serving. Buon appetito!"

(If you have leftover ground shrimp, you can fry it into tasty little patties, which make good snacks.)",

Pour in 1/2 cup oil and blend for 1 minute. Add the rest of the oil and blend for 2 minutes. Transfer to a covered jar and let rest for 24 hours, then strain.",

Whisking constantly and vigorously, slowly dribble in the oil only a drop or two at a time until mayonnaise is thick and the oil is incorporated. When the mayonnaise has emulsified and is starting to get thick, you can add the oil in a thin stream. Continue until all the oil is added and the mixture has thickened to mayonnaise consistency.",

Place a large bowl inside the sink and below the board, so that as you cut, you can sweep the shavings right into the bowl. Place a washed and dried wedge of cabbage on the board, and with a VERY sharp knife, make light, forward-moving cuts. Don't cut through to the board each time, just make partial cuts so you can gauge the fineness of each shave. Not as difficult as it sounds, and you'll soon get the hang of it. It helps to rotate the wedge of cabbage slightly as you go, because it's easier to get a thin cut when you have a somewhat smaller surface to work with.

    "title": "the smitten kitchen's caramel cake",
    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0 F and place a rack in the middle. Butter an 8-inch square cake pan and line it with a square of parchment paper. Butter the parchment paper. (I know you do not want to do this, but do take these precautions: These extra steps are worth it in the end.)",
      "Sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. (You can also get away with whisking these dry ingredients together in a bowl, make sure to thoroughly aerate and incorporate them.)",
      "Beat butter and sugar in a large bowl with an electric mixer at medium speed until pale and fluffy, 3 to 5 minutes. Beat in vanilla, then add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Turn the mixer to low speed and beat in the buttermilk until just combined (don't worry if your mixture looks curdled). Add flour mixture in 3 additions, mixing until each is just incorporated.",
      "Spread the batter evenly into your prepared pan, then knock it on the counter several times to get rid of any air bubbles.",
      "Bake for 35 to 40 minutes, until golden. A toothpick or thin knife inserted into the center of the cake should come out clean, but be careful not to overbake the cake. It should feel moist on top and be springy to touch.",
      "Cool the pan on a rack for 10 minutes, then run a knife around the edges, invert the pan onto the rack, and cool completely, at least 1 hour. If you want to eat the cake tomorrow, you can store it in an airtight container (or wrapped in a layer of plastic wrap followed by a layer of aluminum foil) at room temperature until the next day.",
      "Once the cake is cool, make the caramel glaze: Attach a candy thermometer to a 1 1/2-quart heavy saucepan and pour in the cream, brown sugar, corn syrup, and a pinch of salt to a boil, stirring until the sugar is dissolved. Boil, without stirring, until the glaze reaches 210 to 212\u00b0 F on thermometer, about 12 to 14 minutes, then stir in vanilla. If you want a thicker caramel topping -- more like a coating of candy rather than a thin glaze -- boil the caramel so that it's hotter. But be careful so that it doesn't burn! And know that the caramel topping will be much harder the next day.",
      "Put the rack with the cake in or over a shallow baking pan and pour the hot glaze over top, allowing it to run down the sides. Do not worry if it puddles in the bottom of the pan -- you can eat this leftover caramel with a spoon later on. Cool until the glaze is set, about 30 minutes."

      "Add the carrots and continue to cook, stirring occasionally and taking care not to let the lentils stick to the bottom of the pot. Add more water if the soup gets too thick. The lentils will soak up the water and broth very quickly!",
      "After about ten minutes, give the soup a good, thorough stir, and add the cauliflower pieces. If you want to add some sliced cabbage or some roasted winter squash, this is the time to do it. Add more water if the soup seems to be drying out. Turn the heat to low, give the soup another good stir (but gently, please), then cover the pot, and cook for at least 20 minutes, stirring every five minutes or so.",
      "Check for salt and correct if necessary, taking into account that the chutney and raita, if you plan to use them, may also have salt in them.",
      "Turn off the heat and let the soup sit, covered, until ready to serve. (Refrigerate it though if you won't be serving for several hours or more.)",
      "Stir in the lime juice and chopped cilantro. (I often don't chop fresh cilantro when serving our favorite mint-cilantro chutney with this soup.)",
      "Serve with freshly ground pepper and Cucumber Raita. (My recipe for it is on Food52.)",
      "N.B. Sometimes I add a handful of small green peas right at the end of the cooking time, to give it a bit more color. Also, we often stir cooked brown basmati rice into this when eating this is for dinner.",
      "About the chutney: Search for \"mint chutney\" and \"cilantro chutney\" on food52 for some great fresh chutney recipes. Kitchenbutterfly's \"Coriander Chutney\" should not be overlooked!",
      "When adding roasted pumpkin or winter squash to this, I always add the juice of a full lime, even if I plan to stir in some chutney, to balance the sweetness of the roasted vegetables.",
      "About making extra for freezing: I often make a red lentil soup base for freezing by doubling the recipe, up through (and including) the addition of the roasted winter squash, if I plan to use it. The other vegetables get an unpleasant texture when frozen, so remove the portion you plan to freeze, before adding them to the batch you plan to eat right away. When you use the frozen base, thaw and bring the base to a simmer, and then proceed with adding the carrots and cauliflower, etc. I've also pureed the fully-cooked soup, with all the vegetables, and frozen that. It tasted great. Add in fresh cilantro and lime juice, or a good chutney before serving, if you do this. ;o)"

The milk is done heating when it's starting to steam, but it hasn't started bubbling. You don't want to reach a simmer or a boil, because this will cause your milk to curdle and you'll have to start over with fresh milk.",

This will cause the custard to begin to thicken and become creamy as the eggs begin to cook, but if you aren't beating fast enough you'll end up with a scrambled egg mess, so put some muscle into it!",
      "Wipe your saucepan clean with a kitchen towel and then add the custard mixture back into it, and return the pot to a medium-low burner. Heat the custard while continuously stirring with a wooden spoon. The technique for stirring involves slowly scraping the bottom of the pot with your spoon to prevent burning. I find the best spoon for doing this task is one with a square end. Continue to cook until the mixture becomes thick and steamy. Once again, you don't want to simmer or boil the milk, so the temperature you're aiming for is around 180\u00b0F.",

This provides a light enough butter coating that the sugar will not clump or melt."

      "For the risotto - Heat a wide heavy-bottomed saute pan over high heat. Add the olive oil and red onion, stir well and saute for 3 minutes until wilted. Drain the artichoke slices, shake off any excess water and add them to the pan. Saute for 3 to 4 minutes until the artichokes are golden, stirring only occasionally. Add the garlic and white wine and continue sauteing until the wine has reduced to a syrupy sauce, about 2 to 3 minutes. Add the rice, salt and pepper and saute for 1 minute until the rice becomes translucent at the edges, stirring constantly.",
      "Cook's note: If you are making this recipe ahead of time, take the pan off the heat at this time until ready to continue the risotto. When you are ready to proceed, reheat the risotto at medium heat and proceed as below.",
      "Reduce heat to medium to medium-high. Add a scoop of the broth to the rice using a ladle and simmer, stirring constantly until all the liquid has been absorbed. You may have to adjust the heat from time to time so that the risotto is always at a good simmer, but doesn't stick to the pot. Add another ladle of broth and continue stirring, repeating the process until the rice is creamy but still al dente. This will take about 20 minutes.",
      "Cook's note: You can use 5 to 6 cups of liquid depending on the rice you use, and whether you like a drier risotto. The more liquid you use, the wetter your risotto will be.",
      "Add the butter and parmesan and stir continuously to make the consistency of the risotto softer and creamier. As soon as the butter is melted, turn off the heat and stir in the pesto.",
      "Spoon the risotto into pasta bowls. Drizzle with a little olive oil. Garnish with chive tips and serve immediately."

      "Notes: *I've also made substitutions with canned black olives or capers instead of pickles, but do not include all three in one salad as to keep the level of salt in check. **If you don't have smoked ham on hand, I've used smoked turkey, bologna, or even cut up pieces of hot dog. If you happen to live in the NYC area or have an inclination to come into Astoria, go to Muncan, where they smoke their own meats and sausages without any fake preservatives. They're the closest thing you can come to your own personal smokehouse without storing sausages in your friend's garage. ***Don't be tempted to use frozen peas, as the texture of frozen, while fresher and notably better in most other things, would lend a completely different tone to this salad where most of the rest of the ingredients might be considered \"marinated.\" It would be like adding a jewel tone color to a salad of earthy hippie colors; it's just wrong. You don't want a fresh crisp pea in here, it wouldn't meld with the other ingredients. The crisp elements are onions and pickles alone and steamed or boiled peas would bring a waxy and watery texture."

      "Next, store the pot in a cool place, below 21\u00b0Celsius or 71\u00b0 F. Above that temperature our good bacteria run the risk of being overrun by the baddies of the bacterial world, spoiling the pot. That's part of the reason why pickles traditionally got started in fall, with the cooler temperatures arrives a better environment for the preservation of food - kind of useful when you think that winter will be next.\r\n\r\nCheck the pickles every day. Remove all scum and/or mold that may form at the top. If you've kept your pot clean and your pickles submerged you should have little to worry about, but a little bit of growth is perfectly normal. Remove with a paper towel and make sure to wash your hands - this is an occasion where you need to be scrupulously clean - before touching the pot.\r\n\r\nAfter a week or so taste your first pickle. It should be firm and crunchy and taste mildly sour. Over the coming weeks the sour flavour will increase, until the pickles are fully fermented and the flavour will stabilize. When taking pickles out of the brine, always use clean tongs, never your hands. You've got a delicate eco-system in your pot, make sure not to disturb it if you can possibly help it.\r\n\r\nVegetables preserves with lacto acidic bacteria have a depth and layerdness of flavour that vinegar pickles can only dream about. As per usual, and this is for Mr. Stephenson, time is the magic ingredient here. Time to allow the flavour to develop, time to allow the vegetables to hanker down for the long, cold winter months."

    "title": "almond crepe cake with raspberry-rose cream",
    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "NOTES: I love that this crepe cake is delicious with or without sugar. How much you use is totally up to you. If you don't want to use sugar, you can leave it out completely and rely on the natural sweetness of the almonds, berries and cream, or you can use stevia. Some brands of stevia have a horrible aftertaste that will ruin a dish. I find that SweetLeaf powdered stevia, used in moderation lends just a hint of sweetness without the wacky aftertaste. \r\n\r\n- To keep from getting frosting all over your serving dish, you can lay down strips of parchment before you place the first crepe and then carefully pull them out once the cake is frosted.\r\n\r\n- An offset spatula helps to spread the layers and frost the cake. \r\n\r\n- For beautiful slices, make sure the cake has chilled for at least an hour! If not, the layers can slide off. Heat a chef's knife under hot tap water until warm then wipe it dry. Slice straight down (no sawing back and forth as you cut) and wipe your knife after each cut. Periodically run your knife under hot water and wipe as you slice.",
      "In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, whip the cream and sugar or stevia (if using) to soft peaks. Transfer to a large mixing bowl and set aside. Place the cream cheese in the bowl used to whip the cream and beat until it has softened and has a similar texture to the whipped cream. The time will vary depending on how warm it is when the cream cheese goes into the bowl, but it should take somewhere between 2-5 minutes. Don't rush this step; you want your cream cheese quite loose or else it won't fold into the cream.",
      "Transfer the reserved whipped cream to the bowl with the softened cream cheese and whip at medium-low speed (or by hand) until the mixture is homogenous and has the texture of frosting. Take care not to overbeat it.",
      "Transfer half the frosting to the large mixing bowl and set aside. Fold the chilled Raspberry-Rose Compote into the remaining frosting until the color is uniform. This is what you will use between the crepes.",
      "To assemble the cake: Place a crepe on a flat serving dish. Spoon about 1/2 cup of the Raspberry-Rose Cream on top of the crepe and spread it to 1/3-inch from the edge (the weight from the rest of the crepes and the cream will push the filling to the edge). Continue layering crepes and cream, ending with a crepe on top. Gently press down on the crepe cake to flatten the top and push the cream in the top layers to the edge if necessary. Frost the cake with the reserved whipped cream mixture and refrigerate until firm, at least 1 hour.",
      "CREPE INSTRUCTIONS:",
      "NOTES: If you aren't great at swirling the batter, no worries; just back fill any holes with batter.\r\n\r\n- If you can't find almond meal, make your own. Place almonds in the bowl of a food processor or blender and process until they form a fine meal. You will be able to get a finer meal in the blender. Adding a tablespoon or two of sugar will help keep the almonds from turning to almond butter.\r\n\r\n- Feel free to experiment with other nuts here. Hazelnut and pistachio are both great substitutions.",
      "Place all the ingredients except the coconut oil in a blender. Blend at high speed until the batter is smooth and homogenous, stopping occasionally to scrape down the sides of the bowl, about 1 minute.",
      "Heat a 6-inch nonstick pan over medium-high heat. Add about 1/2 teaspoon coconut oil. When the coconut oil has melted, pour 1/4 cup batter into the center of the pan. Gently swirl to coat the bottom of pan, if necessary. Cook until the crepe is set, 60-90 seconds. Loosen the edge with a flexible heatproof spatula then flip and cook until the other side is golden brown, about 30 seconds longer. Transfer the crepes to a wire rack to cool. Once a crepe has cooled slightly, it can be stacked.",
      "Crepes can be made 1 day in advance. Stack crepes and wrap tightly with plastic wrap until you are ready to assemble your cake. Makes about 10 6-inch crepes or 6 8-inch crepes.",
      "RASPBERRY-ROSE COMPOTE INSTRUCTIONS:",
      "Note: I used Nielsen-Massey rose water, which is quite strong. If you are using a more delicate brand, you might need to use a little more. Always add rose water in very small amounts (drops are good) because once you add too much, your whole dish will taste like soap. And we don't want that.",
      "Place the raspberries in a medium saucepan along with the salt and a couple tablespoons of water. If you are using sugar, add it now. Cook over medium-high heat until the raspberries are bubbling and the sauce has reduced slightly, about 7-8 minutes for frozen berries and 5 minutes for fresh.",
      "Place the cornstarch in a small bowl and add a tablespoon of water. Stir to dissolve the cornstarch then add the mixture to the raspberries. Cook for 1 minute more. Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the lime zest and rosewater. If you are using stevia, stir it in now. Cool the compote at room temperature for about 20 minutes then transfer it to the fridge and chill until cold. The compote can be made up to 3 days in advance and stored, covered, in the fridge. Makes about 1 1/2 cups."

Making brisket a day or two ahead is a great entertaining trick. One less thing to do on the day of a party!",
      "To reheat, preheat the oven to 325\u00b0. Skim any additional fat from surface of the sauce and discard. Cover and reheat brisket in sauce for about an hour or until heated through.
