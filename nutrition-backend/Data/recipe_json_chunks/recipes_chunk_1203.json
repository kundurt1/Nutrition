An MP3 player is a useful accessory here while you stand by the pot.",

      "Wild Canada geese have little or no fat, as do most wild birds. Because of this lack of natural basting liquid, some wild fowl tends to dry out while cooking. This recipe will help assure the cook of no accidents and help keep the meat moist and tender.In this recipe you are essentially poaching the bird, i.e. roasting it upside-down in liquid with finely chopped vegetables. Wild goose is naturally very dark, nearly indistinguishable from roast beef after it is sliced.You may want to add potatoes, onions and firm vegetables to the roasting pan about 45 minutes before the bird is finished. They will not only add flavor to the sauce and the bird but will save you time by allowing the entire meal to finish together.",
      "You may substitute wild turkey, also a lean bird, in place of wild goose.",
      "Pre-heat oven to 375 degrees F.",
      "Melt the butter in a large sauce pan over medium-low heat.",
      "Add the carrots, celery, onions, apple and garlic.",

      "Turn up the heat and bring to a boil for about 1 minute.",
      "Lower the heat to medium-low and simmer for 6-8 minutes.",
      "Pour the vegetables and liquid into a large roasting pan fitted with a lid. Turn the bird breast-side down and nestle into the vegetables and liquid. Spoon some of the liquid and vegetables over the goose and add more water (or wine if you like) to submerse the bird half-way.",
      "Cover and roast about 1 1/4 hours.",
      "Turn the bird over, facing up, and cook another 15 minutes, uncovered or until a meat thermometer registers 160 degrees F when inserted next to the leg bone.",

      "Spoon some of the juice and vegetables over each portion of sliced meat and potatoes.",

    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "These directions are long because I am covering the method quite thoroughly for new-comers. (-;.",
      "SOAK BEANS: On Sunday night (or the night before you want to eat these yummy beans), check beans to be sure there are no stones then place beans in a large bowl and fill almost to the top with water. It's better to have too much water than not enough. The beans will more than double in size overnight. In the morning, I drain beans in a colander and rinse well.",
      "A FEW PERSONAL TRICKS: One of the first things I do in the morning is fill my Crockpot with hot tap water just to bring it up to temperature much faster. This saves on cooking time and electricity. I also fill and boil my electric jug (or kettle) - this is the water I will use to cook my beans.",
      "PLACE IN CROCKPOT: Beans, ham hock, black pepper, chicken stock powder, chopped garlic, garlic salt, bay leaves, and optional Chipotle powder and liquid smoke. Note: Save adding salt until the end of cook time.",
      "COVER WITH HOT WATER: Cover beans with hot water from your jug or kettle just until fully covered. Then add an extra inch of water on top of that. This will give your beans a chance to swell even more during cooking. Cover Crockpot with lid.",
      "QUICKLY: Saute onions and bell-pepper just until they begin to cook. Add these to the beans and stir.",
      "COOK: If you are going to be gone all day, cook beans on low setting for 6 to 8 hours. If you will be around to stir, etc., I recommend cooking them on high until they are almost fully cooked (about 4 or 5 hours). Then turn them down to low for the last bit of cooking.",
      "ONCE COOKED: When beans are fully cooked, remove bay leaves (if you can find them all) add butter and stir. To thicken beans, add 2 tablespoons corn flour mixed with just enough cold water to dissolve it. Add this to beans and stir for a minute. Beans should thicken a bit in fairly short order. Repeat until you get the desired consistency.",
      "ADD: Add salt by half-teaspoon until you reach the level of your liking. It may not take much for you. Also add a bit more fresh ground pepper.",
      "NOW: Put your rice on to cook. Slice smoked sausage and cook in a medium-hot cast iron skillet until nicely brown and starting to emit those nice juices. Take skillet off heat but leave sausages where they are. Don't cover.",
      "RINSE your rice with hot water. Once drained, place about half a cup of hot fluffy rice in a wide, shallow bowl.",
      "COVER rice with a generous amount of red beans. Top with a good amount of hot smoked sausage slices.",
      "SPRINKLE with hot sauce and/or more Tony's if you want it spicy like I do.",
      "SERVE with hot buttered, grilled slices of French bread, salad or coleslaw, and a big glass of iced tea.",
      "ENJOY!",
      "EDIT - December 2016 - I'd like to address the review comments regarding mashing your beans to thicken them. The reason I don't do that is because I don't want to lose any of my beans, though I do that if I make a double batch. These freeze so well (without rice). Also, for re-heating, I put beans in a pot on the stove (medium/low) and add small amounts of water to thin them out a bit. They are much better juicy! The beans are very forgiving but they do need that added moisture when being re-heated. And I'd also like to say I am so humbled by all the comments - a BIG thank you to everyone who has reviewed these humble red beans!"

Take off the stove and set the pan on a dishtowel on your counter. Allow the fudgy mixture to cool down until it's warm, but not hot anymore.",

Stop the mixer and scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl. Turn your mixer back to medium, add your milk and vanilla and keep mixing until it's fully blended. Dollop the peanut butter buttercream in heaping spoonfuls on top of the cooled brownies. Evenly spread it with the back of a butter knife the over the surface.

      "Brown your ground beef on med heat until done. Preheat your oven to 375 degrees. On your premade thin crust, cover with an ample amount of pizza sauce. Use half of your thinly sliced pepperoni. The pepperoni should be thin enough to crush up into a ball. They may come partially undone but that's ok. Put the balled pepperoni on top of the sauce in an even spread. Now use about half of your ground beef the same way. Next shred your fresh mozzarella. The bag stuff just isn't the same. Add the mozzarella cheese evenly. Now use the rest of your ground beef on top followed by the rest of your pepperoni (either balled like before or not, your choice). The thin pepperoni may burn a bit if you do not ball it up. Now top off with your oregano and parmesan cheese. Bake in the preheated oven for between 10 and 15 minuets depending on how brown you want the cheese and how dark and crispy you want the crust. *note* store bought crust will burn if the oven is too hot or if you overcook the pizza. It will be hard. Taking the pizza out as soon as you can see the edges turning golden brown and the middle of the pizza is bubbly and rising. Otherwise the cheese in the center may not be fully cooked, or you will cause the crust to burn. Getting it just right may take some practice, but in the end this is a fantastic pizza in my opinion. Also fun for the whole family."
