Gradually add the milk, beating at medium-low speed 2 minutes or until sugar dissolves.",
      "Beat egg whites (at room temperature) at high speed until foamy. Gradually add the remaining 1/2 cup sugar, beating mixture until stiff peaks begin to form. Add the flour mixture and egg white mixture alternately to the yogurt mixture, beating at low speed.",
      "Pour the batter into prepared pan. Sharply tap pan once on counter to remove air bubbles. Bake at 375\u00b0 for 10 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 350\u00b0, and bake 28 minutes or until a wooden pick inserted in center comes out clean. Let cool in pan 10 minutes on a wire rack. Loosen cake from sides of pan, using a narrow metal spatula, and turn out onto wire rack. Peel off wax paper, and let cool completely.",
      "Note: Don't coat the sides of the cake pans with cooking spray. The cake needs to cling to the sides as it bakes, which allows it to rise higher and gives it a smoother crust.",
      "Note: When separating the eggs, do them one at a time into a custard cup, and pour the whites into your mixing bowl. This prevents you from having to start over if some yolk happens to get into the whites. Eggs are easier to separate right out of the refrigerator; however, for better volume, let them come to room temperature before beating.",
      "Note: Use real vanilla and orange extracts instead of imitaion.",
      "Note: Wrap cooled cake in heavy-duty plastic wrap, lightly dusted with flour, and then in heavy-duty aluminum foil. Refrigerate up to 2 days or freeze up to 2 weeks. (To thaw, place the wrapped cake in refrigerator overnight.)",
      "Note: To slice the cake in half evenly, insert toothpicks around the outside, marking the middle. Using a serrated knife, slice the cake about 2 inches, using the toothpicks as a guide. Wrap a long piece of dental floss around edge through cut; tie floss once. Slowly tighten the floss - it will make a clean, even cut through the cake, dividing it in half.",

Adjust heat to keep milk at 195\u00b0 and cook, whisking often, 10 minutes. After heating, \"you're going to have a thicker, more stable curd,\" Fletcher explains. Remove from heat.",
      "Set pan in a sink of ice and water and cool to 115\u00b0. \"The milk cools fast, so keep checking it. If it goes too low, just reheat it.\" (But don't let it go above 118\u00b0, or it will kill the yogurt.)",
      "Put yogurt in a small bowl and whisk in about 1 cup hot milk to temper it and thin it out, then whisk this back into milk in pan. Transfer milk to a container with a spout. Drain hot water from jar and add hot milk mixture. Put lid on jar.",
      "Incubate yogurt. \"I wrap it in a kitchen towel so it doesn't get my blankets dirty, then set the jar in a blanket nest.\" Fold a small blanket or beach towel in quarters, set on a counter, and fold sides up over yogurt.

Stir in the rosemary, thyme and sage and scrape the mixture into a large bowl; let cool.",
      "Soak the bread in the remaining porcini liquid until evenly moistened, then squeeze dry and tear into small pieces. Reserve the porcini liquid for the gravy. Add the soaked bread to the large bowl, along with the ground beef, veal and pork and the ham and eggs. Season with 1 tablespoon of kosher salt and 1 teaspoon of black pepper. Knead the mixture with your hands until combined. Transfer the meat to a large enameled cast-iron baking dish or a small flameproof roasting pan and pat it firmly into a 10-by-6-inch oval loaf.",
      "In a bowl, mix the mayonnaise with the mustard and cayenne and brush it over the meat loaf. Bake for 1 1/2 hours, or until browned and firm to the touch. Using 2 large spatulas, transfer to a cutting board, cover loosely with foil and keep warm. Set aside the baking dish.",
      "Meanwhile, melt the remaining 1 tablespoon of butter in a medium skillet. Add the shiitake mushrooms and cook over moderate heat, stirring frequently, until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the shallot and cook until translucent, about 3 minutes. Add the chicken stock and porcini soaking liquid and simmer over moderate heat until reduced by half, 8 to 10 minutes.",
      "Place the meat-loaf baking dish over moderately high heat and stir occasionally until the drippings start to brown, about 3 minutes. Add the wine and cook, scraping up any browned bits, until reduced by half, about 3 to 4 minutes. Strain the contents of the baking dish into the skillet, whisk in the flour mixture and boil until thickened, about 2 minutes. Season the gravy with salt and pepper. Cut the meat loaf into thick slices and pass the mushroom gravy at the table.",

      "Preheat the oven to 450\u00b0. Heat the oil in a 9- to 10-inch cast-iron skillet. Add the celery and onion and cook over low heat, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 8 minutes. Add the ground beef and cook over moderately high heat, breaking it up with a wooden spoon, until no pink remains, about 5 minutes. Add the paprika and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in the tomato soup, water and tomato paste until thoroughly blended. Season with salt and pepper and remove from the heat.",
      "In a large bowl, mix the flour with the baking powder, 1 teaspoon of salt and the celery seeds. Using a fork, cut in the shortening until the mixture resembles small peas. Gently stir in the milk just until a soft dough forms.",
      "Using 2 spoons, arrange tablespoon-size dollops of the dough all over the beef filling to within 1 inch of the edge of the skillet. Bake the beef pie for 20 minutes, or until the crust is browned and cooked through and the filling is bubbling. Let the pie stand for 10 minutes before serving. Invert onto a large, flat plate or serve straight out of the skillet.",
      "Make Ahead: The beef filling can be refrigerated overnight. Bring to room temperature, then reheat in the cast-iron skillet before proceeding.",
      "Wine Recommendation: A juicy, peppery, medium-bodied red from the Cotes-du-Rhone in France has the intensity and fullness to complement the tomato-beef pie's rich, creamy filling. Try the 1999 Guigal or the 1999 Domaine Andre Brunel Cuvee Sommelongue."

Begin testing for doneness by inserting a wooden pick directly into the fruit (not granola mixture) after 25 minutes of baking. A wooden pick should be able to pierce the fruit easily with just a little resistance. Overcooking will lead to the fruit losing its natural shape and becoming mushy. For testing purposes only, we used Nature Valley Oats 'N Honey Crunchy Granola Bars."

Add powdered sugar and 3 egg yolks, and pulse just until mixture comes together and pulls away from sides of bowl. Divide dough in half, and flatten each half into a disk. Wrap in plastic wrap, and chill 1 to 12 hours.",

Fit dough circles into 2 (9-inch) fluted tart pans with removable bottoms; trim edges. Line tart shells with parchment paper, and fill with pie weights or dried beans. Bake at 350\u00b0 for 20 minutes or until edges are light brown. Remove weights and parchment paper, and bake 5 to 10 minutes more or until light golden. Cool on a wire rack while preparing Filling.",

Whisk in remaining butter, and cook, whisking constantly, about 22 minutes or until mixture becomes very thick. (Continue whisking throughout the cooking process to prevent mixture from curdling.) Remove from heat, and pour through a fine wire-mesh strainer into a bowl, discarding solids. Whisk 10 minutes or until mixture has cooled slightly.",

Stir together egg whites and 2 cups granulated sugar in bowl of a heavy-duty electric stand mixer. Place bowl over simmering water, and cook, whisking constantly, 3 minutes or until sugar has dissolved and mixture is hot.",
      "Beat hot mixture at medium-high speed with stand mixer, using whisk attachment, about 2 minutes. Increase speed to high, and beat 4 to 6 minutes or until stiff, glossy peaks form. Spoon meringue over tarts. Brown meringue using a kitchen torch, holding torch 2 inches from meringue and moving torch back and forth. (If you do not have a torch, preheat broiler with oven rack 8 inches from heat; broil 30 to 45 seconds or until golden.)"
