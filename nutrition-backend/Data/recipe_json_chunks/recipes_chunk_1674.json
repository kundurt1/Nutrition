      "Firstly let's make the caramel sauce - this sauce is great as part of an ice-cream sundae, banana split, pancakes etc.",
      "(Tip: if you change the ratio to equal parts ie 1 cup each butter, sugar, cream, then put it somewhere to get cold you will have chewy caramels)",
      "Melt the butter and sugar together in the pan over a high heat.",
      "Allow the sugar to dissolve - give it an occasional stir",
      "Let it come up to the boil then reduce the heat a little and allow it to have a small rolling boil",
      "Using a spoon stir around the bottom edgees just to keep it moving and stop it from burning",
      "The butter/sugar mixture should turn golden and when you stir it should feel thicker, this is when you continuously stir as it will burn quickly.",
      "In the blink of an eye the light brown caramel colour will appear and you need to be firmly holding the pan and beating the caramel.",
      "Remove from the heat whilst still beating as the hot pan will still burn your caramel.",
      "Add the cream, stir it in until completely combined then put back on the hob over a low heat and allow a slow simmer for about 5 minutes.",
      "The while thing should take about 8 minutes",
      "So the coffee - the old fashioned way is without a machine, by boiling the milk in a pan on the hob until it froths.",
      "But I like to use the microwave so for me with the instant espresso and microwave milk it's not quite the old fashioned way!",
      "It's the caramel sauce that takes the longest.",
      "So I make the sauce first and whilst it is simmering I compile the rest",
      "Fill your cup or glass 2/3 with milk (approx)",
      "Put it in the microwave - now this is where we will differ so as a rule I use a latte glass that takes half a pint of milk and in an 800 watt microwave it takes 2 minutes and 10 seconds to reach the optimal point, which is, that you can see it just starting to move because the centre is now boiling but the outside is slightly cooler.",
      "Remove quickly from microwave, immediately put a metal spoon into the centre and froth will rise to the top of the milk.",
      "Magic!",
      "I also have a small whisk if it all goes pear shaped",
      "Add 2 heaped teaspoons - real teaspoon measurements - to a small jug plus any sweetening you may like and add boiling water 1/3 of your cup or glass measurement (I always make a bit too much) slowly pour the espresso through the centre of the froth.",
      "Finish off with a drizzle of caramel sauce (I drizzle it on the glass too so that I can lick it off :))",
      "Yummy, serve with your favorite biscuits on the side or like me some chunks of homemade white chocolate"
