Cover this vessel with a lid. No need to add water.\n\tThis mixture should be kept around 36-48 hrs. Just shake it up in between. We can see bubbles forming on the rice. Keep it in warm place. The temperature affects the fermentation\n\tGrind this mixture along with required salt. Let it rest for 1 hr. We will notice the batter will nicely ferment and rise. If the batter is too thick add little water. This batter will be thicker than normal dosa batter and more like Idli batter.\n\tHeat a dosa griddle (tava) take the batter in a ladle and spread the batter into a medium size thick dosa with a light hand as we need sponge consistency dosa. As we pour the batter, we can notice a lot of pores appearing on the dosa. Add a tsp of oil on top and edge of the dosa.\n\tCook this dosa covered and in slow fire.\n\tWe need not flip the dosa or press the dosa. The bottom side of the dosa will become nice light brown colour. It looks like a sponge with lot of big and small pores. \n\tYou can put urad dal chutney powder (Melaga podi ) over it with little oil and have this dosa or with any chutney/ Sambar.",

Don't despair over the canned soup and packaged soup mix; just try it, then scoff if you will. The time-bake oven gadget was invented for this pot roast; it goes into the oven frozen before breakfast, and comes out 6 p.m., meat-falling-off- the-bone wonderful. Variations: Use tiny new potatoes or cannellini beans, rinsed and drained. Use those packaged, peeled small carrots and/or winter root vegetables. Add 1 fennel bulb, cut in half, then sliced (about 1/3\" thick).",

      "Get a fire going and burn the wood down to red hot smoldering coals. You'll want enough wood left over to occasionally add to the fire, one at a time, during the cooking process.",
      "Once your fire is ready, put your campfire grill grate over the fire, and set a soup pot on the grate.",
      "Add the bacon, and cook until it starts to crisp up, but still kinda raw. The bacon will finish cooking in the soup later. Can't really say how long it will take, it all depends on how hot your fire is, and how close your pot is to the fire. Remove the bacon from the pot and place it on a plate. Wrap the plate in tin-foil, and set aside until needed. If the bugs are bad, wrap the bacon in foil and put it in your cooler, tent, car, ect, so the scent doesn't attract more bugs.",
      "Throw 2 tablespoons of butter into the pot, once it completely melts, add the minced garlic. Continuously stir until the garlic becomes fragrant, approx 30 seconds. Then add the mirpoix.",
      "Sprinkle the mirpoix with a pinch of salt and pepper, then stir occasionally until the mixture begins to soften. Again, you will need to taste and play cooking times by ear depending on how hot your fire is.",
      "Once the vegetables are softened, add the thyme and split peas. At this point I added another pinch of salt and pepper and stirred until the peas will mixed well with the vegetables. Now add the veggie stock, and water. Stir the ingredients around for a bit, so the peas don't stick to the bottom of the pot and burn.",
      "Now add the somewhat cooked bacon and the ham steak into the pot. Submerging them into the liquid. It's hard to control a camping fire's temperature, so at this point, I put the lid on the pot, and another log on the fire, in hopes it would bring the liquid to a boil. Which it did. If your fire is too cold and the soup won't boil, don't be too worried, you just may have to cook your soup longer.",
      "Cook, covered, for about 1 hour, stirring occasionally.",
      "Note, about 20 minutes or so into the cooking time, take off the cover, you should see a foam forming on top of the liquid. Skim the foam and discard it in the garbage. Replace the cover and continue cooking.",
      "After 1 hour, remove the ham steak from the soup. This will help prevent the ham from drying out. Put the ham on a plate and cover it with foil. If the bugs are bad, you may need to keep the ham in your cooler, tent, or car, otherwise the smell will attract more bugs.",
      "Continue cooking the soup for another 40 minutes to an hour. Stirring on a regular basis. Taste the peas, if they break apart easily, the soup is ready. If the peas are still tough, you'll have to cook it longer.",
      "Once the peas are extremely soft and easily break apart, I start to gently smash them against the side of the soup pot to break them up even more (optional).",
      "Remove the cooked bacon. You can either eat it right there, discard it, or cut it up, and put it back into the soup. Taste the soup for additional salt and pepper. Cube the ham steak, and add it back into the pot, ensuring you pour any juices from the resting ham, back into the soup.",
      "Ladle the soup into bowls, and top with any soup toppings you like (cheddar cheese, breadcrumbs, ect)"

Continue to cook and stir until the liquids mostly evaporate and mixture looks relatively dry. At this point you can add your raisins, green olives and capers if using.

The dough is very sticky and you can rub your hands with vegetable oil to prevent sticking also. Pat as thin as you can make them while allowing the filling to remain well encased! This is very important because if they are too thick they become gooey and starchy as opposed to a tender crisp shell. Make a disk and add as much filling as desired and carefully fold over and press to seal. Repeat until you make as many as you want. I honestly don't know if they can be filled and frozen or even if the dough will keep in the freezer or fridge because I have never tried.",

When they're nicely roasted and soft if you poke at 'em, place them in a bowl and cover for about 15 minutes. Then gently peel the blackened skin off, cut them in half and remove the stem and seeds. After that you can chop",
      "If you have a hand blender, I suggest you blend your base up right in the pot. If you don't, you can blend the soup in a regular blender, but you'll have to do it in batches. You can add a little of the milk to each batch if it's too thick to blend.",
      "Add remaining ingredients to pot (except sour cream) and stir until well-mixed. Then cover and simmer for 15 or 20 minutes, until spices have had time to nicely flavor the soup. Keep tasting, and add more of your favorite spices as desired.",

When the oil has become hot but not smoking, add the garlic and the sage (not more than seven or eight leaves; too much sage will make the beans bitter). Cook until the sage crackles and the garlic is lightly browned.",

      "MARINATION OF CHICKEN:\n6 pieces Boneless Chicken \n1 cup Barbecue sauce\n3 tablespoon Soy sauce\n1 teaspoon Red chili powder\n1.5 tablespoon Olive oil\n1 teaspoon garlic powder\nSalt to taste\n\nCHICKEN PREPARATION:\n1. First, let's wash, clean and pat dry chicken pieces. Let's begin by marinating the chicken. Assemble all the ingredients and in a bowl lay out the chicken pieces,pour barbecue sauce on top of it. You can even combine the sauces, stir in the spices and mix till its well blended - then pour it on top of the chicken.\n2. Add in soy sauce and spices and give it a good mix till everything blends well with the chicken. Cover and allow it to marinate for 2-3 hours.\n3. Heat olive oil in a saucepan and add marinated chicken to it. Keep sauteing on a medium flame. As chicken gets cooked, pull it out of the pan onto an plate and using a fork shred it into pieces.\n4. Return shredded chicken back to the pan and keep sauteing till all the liquid reduces and sauce becomes thick and sticks to the chicken. Barbecue chicken is ready.",
      "ALFREDO SAUCE:\n2 tablespoons butter\n1 cup cream (I used Amul fresh cream)\n1 teaspoon of mixed herbs (oregano,basil,thyme)\nSalt and freshly ground black pepper to taste\n1/2 cup freshly grated cheese, plus more for sprinkling over the final dish, if desired.\n\nALFREDO SAUCE PREPARATION:\n1. In a saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Make sure the butter does not brown since this sauce is in a creamy white color.\n2. Carefully pour the cream into the saucepan with the melted butter. Add salt and pepper to taste and add herbs too.\n3. Bring the butter-cream mixture to boiling; reduce the heat to a simmer and cook the sauce gently until it begins to thicken, stirring frequently with a wooden spoon. This will take 3 to 5 minutes.\n4. Remove the pan from the heat.Stir in the cheese.\n5. Continue stirring until the cheese is incorporated into the sauce. Your sauce is now ready to toss with pasta or use as desired",
      "SPAGHETTI:\n1 packet spaghetti\n1 large onion\n\nCARAMELIZING ONIONS:\n1. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a saucepan and add onion julienne's to it. Keep stirring on a medium flame and within 7-8 minutes you will have beautifully caramelized and crispy onions ready for our recipe.\n\nSPAGHETTI PREPARATION:\n1. In a pan boil spaghetti according to the package instructions, add 1 tablespoon oil and season it with salt.\n2. When spaghetti is perfectly cooked, drain it through a colander. When fully drained, return it to the pan and stir in dried basil leaves, salt and diluted Alfredo sauce. Give it a good stir until all the spaghetti blends in with the sauce.",
      "ASSEMBLING SPAGHETTI AND CHICKEN:\n1. Get your serving plate ready - to serve make a bed of spaghetti on the plate, sprinkle some caramelized onions on top and finish it with barbecued chicken.\n2. Toss in some dried basil leaves just before serving.",
      "POINTS TO BE NOTED:\n1. In case if your sauce thickens, add little milk to get your desired consistency and bring it to a boil.\n2. while adding cheese to Alfredo sauce make sure the pan is off the heat, as high heat can cause the cheese to clump or become stringy rather than melt smoothly.\n3. while making Alfredo sauce when cream added to butter ensure you stir continuously to avoid lumps.\n4. To enhance taste of Alfredo sauce you can add dried garlic powder in it."
