Return to medium heat. Separately mix the broccoli cheese soup and milk. Stir until creamy in texture. At this point, test for taste. I usually add table grind black pepper and salt (less than 1/2 teaspoon). When the ground beef is ready, add the rice and broccoli and soup mixture, tossing carefully. Put the mixture into a 9 x 9 or 9 x 13 casserole dish. Sometimes I top this with seasoned bread crumbs and Parmesan cheese. Bake about 35 minutes. Makes 8 servings."
