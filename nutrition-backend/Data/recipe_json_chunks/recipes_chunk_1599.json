Attach the KitchenAid(R) Sifter + Scale Attachment to your mixer, and have the ingredient valve in the closed position. Weigh the sugar (7 pz), baking powder (0.28 oz), and salt (0.13 oz) in the ingredient hopper, taring the scale between ingredients. Turn the mixer to low speed, open the ingredient valve, and sift the sugar mixture into the mixing bowl. Cream the butter mixture until the sugar is incorporated, about 1 minute. Turn the mixer to medium, and beat until creamy, about 4 minutes. Stop the mixer.",

Set the pastry bag in a 2-cup/480-ml measuring cup for easier filling. Transfer the cookie dough to the piping bag. Twist the top of the bag to close and remove any air pockets.

Add the 1/4 cup cream, 2 Tbs lemon zest and 1 Tbs lemon juice, and 1/8 tsp salt to the mixing bowl. With the mixer on low speed, open the ingredient valve and sift the sugar into the cream mixture. Beat on medium-high speed until smooth, about 2 minutes, stopping the mixer once to scrape down the sides of the bowl.

      "Slice eggplants lengthwise (about 4-5 mm thickness). Eggplants should not be sliced too thin to prevent them from burning while frying. On the contrary, if eggplants are cut too thick, they will absorb too much oil.",
      "Toss eggplants with salt and place them in a colander.The secret to a liquid free recipe is draining enough water from eggplants. Some recipes suggest to let eggplants drain for about 1 hour. I let them drain overnight.",
      "According to Neapolitan tradition, eggplants should only be fried with olive oil long enough to acquire an intense golden brown color. Fry 4 to 5 slices at a time. In other Italian regions, eggplants are previously dipped in egg batter or/and flour before frying.",
      "Once fried, eggplants are transferred to a plate and covered with paper towels to drain excess oil. Make sure to eliminate excess oil: there is nothing worse than a Parmigiana drowned in oil.",
      "To prepare the sauce, the most recommended type of tomatoes are fresh, ripe San Marzano or Picadilly. These kind of \"plum\" tomatoes, are considered by many Italian cooks to be the best sauce tomatoes",
      "In a pot, boil water and add tomatoes, and blanche for about 1 - 2 minutes, the necessary time to soften them. The more time you boil tomatoes in water, the more water they absorb.",
      "Once blanched, tomatoes are passed through a hand-held vegetable mill. This useful tool besides from speeding up the process by easily removing skin and seeds (which determines acidity in tomato sauce) from tomatoes, it produces a sweeter and better quality of sauce.",
      "In a saucepan, add 2-3 tablespoons of olive oil, and sliced garlic. Add chopped onions and saute for about 30 seconds. Add sauce and simmer for about 1 hour or until sauce is thickened. Add some basil leaves and salt to taste",
      "The type of cheese used in Parmigiana di Melanzane is crucial for the final result. Since Buffalo Mozzarella usually has high level of serum (which is a sign of freshness), Neapolitans do not use in Eggplant Parmesan because it becomes soggy. Therefore, they prefer to add sliced Fior di Latte, previously squeezed to eliminate excess liquid. Some Neapolitans even slice it, place it on a tilted plate, and leave it overnight in the refrigerator.",
      ".Arrange eggplant slices in bottom of a baking dish (I used an oval baking dish 13- by 11- by 2-inch), overlapping slightly if necessary. Spread over tomato sauce. Cover with Fior di Latte slices, and Parmigiano Reggiano. Add some whole basil leaves on top. Continue layering with remaining eggplant, sauce, Fior di Latte, Parmigiano Reggiano, and basil. Sprinkle top with remaining Parmigiano-Reggiano.",
      "Bake at 200\u00b0 C (about 400 F), uncovered, until cheese is melted and golden, approximately 30-40 minutes. It is very important to let it cool for about 30 minutes before serving to appreciate flavors better."

    "title": "three-layer carrot cake with cream cheese frosting",
    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "Special Equipment: KitchenAid(R) Stand Mixer; KitchenAid(R) Sifter + Scale Attachment; Three 9-in/23-cm cake pans with 11/2-in/4-cm sides; parchment paper; food processor fitted with the medium shredding disk or a box grater; offset spatula",
      "Position one rack in the center and a second rack in the lower third of the oven and preheat to 350\u00b0F/180\u00b0C/gas 4.",
      "Butter three 9-in/23-cm cake pans with 11/2-in/4-cm sides. Line the bottom of each pan with a circle of parchment paper. Butter the parchment paper. Sprinkle 1 pan with a spoonful of flour, and then tilt and tap the pan to distribute the flour evenly. Turn the pan upside down over the sink and gently shake out the excess flour. Repeat with the second and third pans.",
      "Attach the KitchenAid(R) Sifter + Scale Attachment to your KitchenAid(R) mixer fitted with the flat beater. Place the scale lid on top. Individually weigh the carrots (10.6 oz), coconut 3 oz), walnuts (4 oz), and raisins (3 oz). Using a rubber spatula or your hands, toss them together in a medium-sized bowl until evenly combined. Set aside.",
      "Remove the scale lid, attach the ingredient hopper, and close the ingredient valve. Weigh the sugar (14 oz) in the ingredient hopper. Add the oil to the mixing bowl. Turn the mixer on low speed, open the ingredient valve, and sift the sugar into the mixing bowl. Beat together until smooth, about 2 minutes. Add the 4 eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Turn the mixer off.",
      "Close the ingredient valve. Weigh the flour (8 oz), baking powder (0.28 oz), baking soda (0.42 oz), cinnamon (0.16 oz), salt (0.16 oz), and nutmeg (0.04 oz) in the ingredient hopper, taring the scale between ingredients. Turn the mixer to medium-low speed, open the ingredient valve, and sift the flour mixture into the mixing bowl. Be careful not to overmix the batter. Remove the mixer bowl, and use a rubber spatula to blend in any flour remaining on the sides of the bowl. Fold in the carrots, coconut, nuts, and raisins until evenly distributed.",
      "Divide the batter in three equal parts into the prepared pans, spreading evenly in each pan. Bake the cakes until they just start pulling away from the sides of the pan and a toothpick inserted into the center of a cake comes out, 40 to 50 minutes. For even baking, at the midpoint, switch the pans between the racks and rotate them front to back. Let the cakes cool in the pans on wire racks for 15 minutes. Run a table knife around the inside edge of each pan to loosen the cake sides. Invert the cakes onto the racks and peel off the parchment paper. Let cool completely before frosting. (Note: the cakes are deliciously dense; so don't expect a lot of rise once baked.)",
      "To make the frosting, in the stand mixer fitted the paddle attachment, beat the 16 oz (2 pkg) cream cheese on medium speed until smooth, about 3 minutes. Add the 1 cup butter and beat until combined, about 2 minutes. Turn off the mixer.",
      "Close the ingredient valve. Weigh the confectioners' sugar (7 oz) in the ingredient hopper. Turn the mixer to medium-low speed, open the ingredient valve, and sift the sugar into the mixing bowl. Drizzle the 1 Tbs lemon juice down the side of the mixing bowl and beat until fluffy, about 3 minutes.",
      "Place 1 cake layer, top side down, on a cake plate. Using an offset spatula, spread one-third of the frosting over the top. Spread the frosting right to the edge of the top without frosting the sides. Carefully set the second cake layer on top, placing it top side down and lining up the edges. Spread half of the remaining frosting on top of the layer the same way. Place the third cake layer on top, right side up. Spread the remaining frosting over the top of the cake, again without frosting the sides. Swirl the frosting to decorate the top, then garnish the top evenly with the coconut, if desired. Refrigerate the cake for at least 45 minutes to set the frosting. Remove from the refrigerator 30 to 40 minutes before serving.",
      "Note: Use the medium-shredding blade for your food processor, to make quick work of grating the carrots. Otherwise, use the coarse holes on a box grater.",
      "The frosted cake can be made up to 2 days in advance. Refrigerate until cold, then carefully cover with plastic wrap. The frosted cake also freezes well. Place it in the freezer unwrapped until both the frosting and the cake are firm and set, usually about 3 hours. Wrap the cake airtight in plastic wrap and then aluminum foil. Don't freeze baked goods any longer than 30 days, as they pick up a stale-freezer taste. Thaw the cake, still wrapped, in the refrigerator overnight. The cake will keep for 3 to 4 days."

      "4. Pour in egg whites, and mix on low until just incorporated. Mix in the buttermilk in two installments, on a low speed. Add in vanilla and oil, and mix at a low speed until fully incorporated. Scrape down the sides of the bowl with a spatula, then beat on medium speed for about 30 seconds.",
      "5. Divide batter evenly between the prepared cake pans.",
      "6. Bake for 35-37 minutes (or until a skewer comes out clean). Allow to cool for 10 minutes, then run an offset spatula around perimeter of the pan to separate the cake from the pan. Place cake layers into the freezer for 30 minutes, to accelerate the cooling process. Carefully invert the pans, and remove the layers from the pans onto a wire rack, to finish cooling.",
      "7. Once fully cooled, level one of the cake layers using a serrate knife. Leave the second cake layer with a dome. Set aside.",
      "1. Line two 6-inch pans and two 4-inch pans with parchment rounds, and spray with non-stick spray.",
      "2. Add the sugar and butter into the bowl of a stand mixer, and whisk on high for 1 minute. The mixture should become light in color.",
      "3. Add in the eggs, one at a time. Then add baking soda, baking powder, and salt. Mix on high for another minute.",
      "4. In a separate bowl, combine the hot water, and buttermilk. Pour in the black cocoa, and whisk until no clumps remain.",
      "5. Next, add 1/2 cup of flour into the butter/egg mixture. Scrape the sides of the bowl with a spatula, to ensure the flour is fully incorporated.",
      "6. Pour in half of the buttermilk / cocoa mixture, and gently pulse the mixture to incorporate the liquid (if you don't, you'll end up splattering the cocoa mixture all over your kitchen!",
      "7. Repeat this process, ending by mixing in the last 1/2 cup of flour.",
      "8. Divide the batter between the pans, filling each pan at least 1 inch high with batter.",
      "9. Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until a skewer comes out clean.",
      "10. Allow layers to cool in the pans for about 10 minutes, then run an offset spatula around the edge of the pans to help separate the layers from the pans.",

      "4. If the frosting is too thick, add in additional cream (1 tablespoon at a time). If the frosting is too thin, add in more powdered sugar (quarter of a cup at a time).",
      "5. Place 1/2 of the frosting into a separate bowl, and mix in 1/2 cup of unsweetened baking cocoa and an extra tablespoon of heavy cream to make chocolate peanut butter buttercream for the top tier of the cake. Cover with plastic wrap, and set aside.",
      "6. Place 1/2 cup of peanut butter buttercream into a small bowl, and add forest green gel food coloring. Mix until evenly colored, then place in a small piping bag. Snip a small (less than 1/2 cm) opening at the tip of the bag, and set aside.",
      "Now assemble the cake!",
      "1. Spread a small dab of buttercream in the center of a 12-inch, grease-proof cake board. Center the leveled, peanut butter cake layer on the cake board, and top with a generous, even layer of peanut butter buttercream. Place the un-trimmed peanut butter cake layer on top of this. Cover the cake layers in a crumb coat, and place in fridge to chill.",
      "2. Next, begin to make the chocolate portion of the cake. Using a 6-inch cardboard cake round, stack and frost the chocolate cake layers with the chocolate peanut butter buttercream. Smooth any overhanging frosting, and then use a serrated knife to trim the cake into a cone-like shape. Cover in a thin crumb coat, and place in the fridge to chill.",
      "3. Remove the peanut butter cake from the fridge, and add a second, thicker layer of peanut butter frosting. Use an acetate sheet to create rounded sides on the cake, to emulate the shape of a peanut butter cookie. Carefully add granulated sugar onto the peanut butter frosting, to emulate the sugar that peanut butter blossom cookies are rolled in before they are baked.",
      "4. Trace the shape of a 6-inch circle on top of the cake (using the cake pan or a 6-inch cake round), and scoop out the circle using a spoon (removing about 1 inch from the top of the cake). This will help make it look like the chocolate portion of cake was pressed into the peanut butter layer, just like a peanut butter blossom cookie fresh out of the oven. Set aside.",
      "5. Remove the chocolate cake from the fridge, and add a second, thicker layer of frosting using the chocolate peanut butter buttercream. Use an acetate sheet to create slightly curved sides around the base of the cake. Once the frosting is smooth, carefully place on top of the peanut butter cake layer, into the carved area on top of the cake.",
      "6. Use a small knife to carve some lines into the frosting, to resemble the cracks that peanut butter blossom cookies have when once they're baked.",
      "7. The finishing touch is to use the green buttercream to pipe a line around the chocolate cake, and place the candy-coated chocolate almonds beneath it, to look like Christmas lights!",
      "8. The last step is to gather your friends and family around, and slice into this cake! This cake feeds about 25 people."

Also if you do this, you'll also want to freeze the crab meat as well, my preferred way to freeze crab meat is by placing the meat in a ziplock freezer bag and adding a few tablespoons of milk.",
      "Cut the kernels from the ears of corn into a large bowl (you should have around 3 c. corn). Using the back of a chef's knife, scrape the spent cobs to extract the sweet, milky corn pulp into a separate bowl. Add a cup of the corn kernels into the bowl with the corn pulp and reserve the remaining corn kernels.",
      "To make the soup: Heat olive oil in a soup pot or Dutch oven over medium heat until the oil is shimmering, add the shallots and saute, stirring occasionally, until the shallot is softened and browned around the edges, about 5-7 minutes. Add the tomato paste and 1 1/2 t. thyme. Cook, stirring constantly, until the tomato paste is evenly incorporated into the shallots and is darkened in color, 2-3 minutes. Add the dry sherry, cook, scraping up any browned bits on the bottom of the pot, until the liquid is almost completely cooked out, about a minute. Add the crab stock, plus additional water (or bottled clam juice) to measure 5 cups of liquid total, along with the roasted red pepper and the corn/pulp mixture. Bring to a simmer, simmer for about 10-15 minutes, to blend the flavors.",
      "Working in batches, ladle the soup into a blender and puree until smooth. Return the soup to the pot, add the salt and pepper to taste. Bring to a gentle simmer, add the remaining thyme, the remaining 2 c. corn kernels and about 2/3 of the crab meat. Gently simmer for 3-4 minutes. Off heat, stir in lemon juice and parsley, season with salt & pepper to taste. To serve: ladle the soup into bowls, garnish with the remaining crab meat."

    "ingredients": [],

      "1. For the Sumac Glaze: In a medium saucepot, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Sweat the garlic for about 1 minute. Add the sumac and Aleppo pepper and toast in the hot oil for 30 to 60 seconds until fragrant. Pour in the molasses, brown sugar, vinegar, salt, plus 3 Tablespoons of water and bring to a simmer. Add the lemon peel and remove from the heat, allowing the mixture to steep for 30 minutes. Strain the glaze.The glaze will hold refrigerated for up to a week, bring to room temperature before using, as the mixture will thicken when cold.",
      "2. Preheat a grill with two zones of heat: medium and medium high.",
      "3. For the Charred Herb Vinaigrette: Combine the ingredients for the dipping liquid and set aside in a 2\" half hotel pan, large enough to fit your bundled herbs. Trim any large stems from the herbs. Using butchers twine, bundle the herbs together. Place the herbs on the grill over medium heat and allow the herbs to char. Every few minutes, dunk and roll the herb bundle in your dipping liquid and continue to cook on the medium grill until nicely charred and the scallions are fully tender. Remove from the heat, unbundle and once cool, remove all the tough stems from the mixture and chop the charred herbs. Whisk together the ingredients for the vinaigrette base, as well as any remaining dipping sauce mixture. Fold in the chopped charred herbs and reserve.",
      "4. Take the ham steaks and place them on a hot grill. Cook for about 30 seconds on each side and then dunk them in the Sumac Glaze. Return the slices to the hot grill and cook again, for approximately 30 seconds on each side or until the glaze begins to char. Remove from the grill and season with salt and pepper to taste.",
      "5. For Shelling Beans: In a large saucepot, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the bay leaf, rosemary, chiles, and thyme. Bloom them in the oil for a few minutes before adding the sliced onions and garlic. Stir the mixture continuously until the onions are tender and translucent, approximately 5 to 7 minutes, then add the beans, stock, and Brussels sprout or cabbage leaves, if using. Allow the liquid to come to a simmer and reduce the heat so that it is just under a simmer. Let the beans cook for about 45 minutes, stirring occasionally and making sure that the pot does not simmer or boil in order to prevent the beans from overcooking or breaking apart.",
      "6. Once the beans are tender and creamy all the way through, remove them from the stove and season them with salt, pepper and sherry vinegar. Do not be tempted to season them sooner - this can make the beans tough."

If you are adding honey, do so now (I always have more success with the honey not clumping up if I add it after the dry ingredients are in). Don't worry about over-mixing because coconut flour is nothing like regular flour - you can't mess this recipe up by mixing it too much. Allow batter to sit for about 10 minutes. I swear, as one of the most impatient people on this planet, I wouldn't say this step unless it were necessary.",

I suggest making small pancakes because they are much easier to flip when they are small. The flipping process requires some finess, as these pull apart easily - they take a little more care than the standard pancake. Spoon out small portions of batter into the skillet (you should be able to make 3 at a time) and allow pancakes to cook about 5 to 7 minutes before flipping. Allow pancake to cook an additional 3 minutes and serve with your favorite toppings!"

Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let it sit at room temperature for about 12 - 18 hours, until the surface is dotted with bubbles and the dough has more than doubled in size.",
      "When the slow rise is complete, Lay a 12 x 18 inch sheet of parchment paper inside a 10-inch skillet and spray it with nonstick cooking spray. Generously dust your counter, a large cutting board, or a silicone mat with flour. Use a rubber spatula to scrape the dough out in one piece. Using lightly floured hands, lift the edges of the dough and fold them in toward the center. Nudge and tuck in the edges of the dough to make it round. Transfer the dough, seam-side down, to the parchment-lined skillet. A bench scraper is helpful for doing this. Spray a piece of plastic wrap with nonstick cooking spray and cover the dough loosely with the wrap. Place the dough in a warm, draft-free spot to rise for 1 to 2 hours. The dough is ready when it is almost doubled, and if it holds an indentation when gently poked with your finger.",
      "Half an hour before the end of the second rise, preheat the oven to 450 degrees F, with a rack in the lower third position, and place a covered pot in the center of the rack. Take the pre-heated pot out of the oven, and carefully transfer the dough into the pot by lifting the parchment paper and lowering it into the pot. Quickly cover the pot and put it in the oven. Bake for 30 minutes. Remove the lid and continue baking until the bread is a deep chestnut color, 10 - 20 mins more. Make sure to check the bread so it doesn't burn, because every oven is different. An instant-read thermometer will register 210 degrees, or you can tap the bottom and listen for a hollow sound. Carefully remove the bread from the pot and transfer to a wire rack to cool."

You can speed the setting process by placing the biscotti in the fridge.",
