Then toss the dice in a level teaspoon of salt and pack them into a colander with a plate on top and a heavy weight on top of the plate. Leave them on one side for an hour so that some of the bitter juices drain out. After that, squeeze out any juices left, and dry the dice thoroughly in a clean cloth. Preheat the oven to gas mark 9, 475\u00b0F (240\u00b0C).",
      "Now arrange the eggplant, zucchini, tomatoes, pepper, fennel and onion in the roasting pan or sheet pan, sprinkle with the crushed garlic, basil and olive oil, toss everything around in the oil to get a good coating and season with salt and pepper. Place the pan on the highest shelf of the oven for 30-40 minutes or until the vegetables are toasted brown at the edges.",
      "When the vegetables are done, remove them from the oven and stir in the chopped olives and the capers then remove them to a plate to cool.",
      "When you're ready to assemble the salad, first place the couscous in a large, heatproof bowl, then pour the boiling stock over it, add some salt and pepper, stir it with a fork, then leave on one side for 5 minutes, by which time it will have absorbed all the stock and softened.",
      "Meanwhile cut the cheese into sugar cube-sized pieces. Make up the dressing by whisking all the ingredients together in a bowl, then pour into a serving container. To serve the salad, place the couscous in a large, wide salad bowl and gently fork in the cubes of cheese along with the roasted vegetables. Next arrange the salad leaves on top and, just before serving, drizzle a little of the dressing over the top followed by a sprinkling of onion seeds and pass the rest of the dressing around separately."

Serve the pie directly from the tin and put the jar of honey, with a spoon in it (or you can pour it into a jug) on the table for people to add extra as they eat."

    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "First of all, this looks hard -- but it's not. After you make it once, you will be a pro. Second of all, please get the freshest fish you can. It's key! Do use raw fish. Smoked or otherwise cooked fish will not do. Be brave! Leave your fish in the fridge until the last part because you want it nice and cold and it goes on last.",
      "I use a rice cooker to make this recipe super easy. While the rice is cooking (20 minutes), I prepare the remainder of the dish.",
      "Get a good quality sushi rice if you can. If not, use a short grain white rice. It won't be quite as good but will suffice. Rinse your rice well before placing in rice cooker. If you don't have a rice cooker, cook according to package directions. A good rule of thumb is 1 cup rice, 2 cups water. Simple! Once rice is in cooker, I pour in water and give it a stir. Turn rice cooker on and let it go.",
      "Next I place sesame oil in a small skillet over a medium low heat. When it's hot I add the panko bread crumbs and stir with a sprinkle of garlic salt. You want to warm the crumbs and make them crunchy but you don't want to burn them or turn them dark brown. This process only takes about 3 minutes. Once you have pinched a few to taste (yes, that burn your fingers a bit) and added more salt if needed, remove the pan from the burner, pour the crumbs onto a paper towel or napkin to cool. That's done!",
      "Once the rice is cooking and the crumbs are crunchy, start on your vegetables. I chop the cucumber and bell peppers so that they are quite small and fairly uniform in size. A variety of colors is key. This is a gorgeous dish and one you will be proud to serve to others. Slice your tomatoes longways. Save the avocado til last thing as they turn brown quickly. I have been known to prepare the chopped vegetables up to a few hours in advance and just have them ready in the fridge.",
      "Your salad greens should be nice and leafy. Iceberg lettuce just doesn't cut it for this particular dish. Go with a Spring Mix or Baby Spinach or a mixture of both for the best texture, flavor, and nutritional content. You'll thank me. Make sure it's washed and well-drained. Salad spinners are great for this!",
      "Now, your rice should be just about done. As soon as it is done, remove the inner pan from the cooker and let it start cooling. No need to rinse. Remember, you did that before cooking and you don't want soggy rice. If you used a pot on the stove, remove rice to a bowl to cool. After allowing it to cool for about 5 minutes, stir vinegar into rice. It does not take much but it give the rice a sheen and makes it sticky. This is part of the genius to this dish. It helps the greens and vegetables stick to the rice (and that's good if you are going to be extra brave and use chop sticks).",
      "Now place about a cup of rice (or a little less) in the bottom of a big, pretty single serving bowl. A deep bowl is an excellent choice.",
      "On top of rice sprinkle a half teaspoon of black sesame seeds. Now add salad greens. A good handful, about a cup, is good.",
      "Now sprinkle your greens with your chopped bell pepper, cucumber cubes.",
      "Alright. Now it's time to cut up your fish. Did I mention how perfect salmon is for this dish?.",
      "Take your Salmon filet and wash it good. Pat it dry with a paper towel. Now place on a cutting board and remove any skin. Once you have a good clean piece of fish start slicing with a sharp knife. Now cut each slice into little pieces or cubes. If you haven't tried raw Salmon before, go with quite small pieces as it's easier to acclimate to raw fish that way. If you are a seasoned connoisseur, go with whatever size you like.",
      "Place fish in a bowl and squeeze some fresh lemon juice over it. Not too much -- about a tablespoon or so.",
      "Wash your hands good at this point and grab your avocado. With a medium sized butcher knife, start cutting around the avocado lengthways (to the pip in the middle) and go all the way around it. Twist the avocado so that the two sides come apart easily. Take the half that still has the pip and wrap it up and place back in the fridge for later (unless you are like me -- and I give each person half of an avocado to themselves). Cut the remaining half longways so that you have quarters. Now peel each quarter, starting at the skinny end. You should have a beautiful wedge. Now sprinkle a bit of lemon over those wedges and slice them, longways for visual effect or crossways for ease of eating, I've done both. It really is a masterpiece and one that is super fun to build because of all the textures and colors.",
      "Place avocado slices around the top of each bowl in a sunburst display. Between slices place cherry tomato halves. The visuals on this are gorgeous!",
      "Back to that beautiful fish -- In the middle of the salad place a pile of salmon. I like to sprinkle a few more black sesame seeds on top. They have a tiny bit of bite. Here I add a sprinkle of the cooled Panko crumbs. You will be utterly amazed at the burst of textures when this hits your lips!",
      "Serve your Sashimi Donburi with a nice drizzle of soy sauce and sri racha sauce. Use the sri racha sauce sparingly if you don't like hot sauces -- but I love it and just keep adding more and more soy and sri racha, all the way through the eating event!",
      "Now once you start eating and clear off some of the top bits, dig down in the bottom and bring up some of the rice to mix in with the fish and salad. And yes, add more soy sauce and hot sauce. It's an eating extravaganza! Best shared with a friend.",
      "Enjoy!"

    "title": "hot yeast rolls",
    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "In a medium-sized saucepan, put 1/2 C sugar & Crisco All-Vegetable Shortening in the 1 cup of BOILING water. Turn the heat off when all ingredients are dropped in the saucepan. Dissolve 1/2 C sugar & Crisco All-Vegetable Shortening. Once all dissolved, add in salt. Dissolve salt. Once everything is all dissolved add in the one cup of the ICE-COLD WATER. Stir to become a luke-warm mixture. Let mixture sit aside. In a separate cup, put the 1/4 cup of luke-warm water and dissolve the 1/2 TSP of sugar in it. Once all dissolved, but still luke-warm, add in the Active-Dry Yeast and stir. Make sure all yeast is dissolved. Then let the mixture of sugar, water, & yeast sit for 5 minutes. **If the mixture does not rise up and become bubbly, that means you have killed the yeast cells with too hot temperature of water, or you just bought a faulty pack or jar of yeast** If indeed that happens, start over with the sugar, water & yeast mixture. After your mixture has risen up and become bubbly, place out a large bowl and pour the sugar, salt, & Crisco All-Vegetable Shortening mixture into it first to make sure that the mixture is luke-warm and not too hot. Then pour the yeast mixture into the large bowl also. Stir with a wire whisk to combine well. Then add in 2 cups of the Gold Medal All-Purpose flour to the combined mixture. Stir well to combine, the mixture should look like cake batter or a little thicker depending on the day's humidity. Place a warm, wet towel over the large bowl & let the mixture sit for 15 minutes or until it forms bubbles. After the approximated 15 minutes, add in 1 3/4 cup of the Gold Medal All-Purpose Flour to the mixture. Stir and combine very well. Then after the flour is worked in see if the dough is sticky and wet. If it is sticky and wet, add in 1/2 cup of the Gold Medal All-Purpose Flour and combine very well. If it is not sticky and wet, the mixture should form a dough ball (or a roughly-shaped one). Then dump the dough onto a heavily floured board or countertop and knead by hand well for 5 minutes approximately. The dough should be springy & elastic. Once you have reached that point by hand-kneading the dough, place the dough into a well-oiled large bowl (tossing the dough to coat). Cover the bowl and dough with a wet and warm towel, and let sit in a warm place for at least 2 hours (or until doubled in size) Once doubled in size, place the dough on a lightly floured surface and punch down with hand (to remove any extra air pockets in the dough). **If dough does not rise, that means you killed the yeast in the process of combining the yeast mixture with the sugar, salt, and Crisco mixture because it was too hot, or you just bought a faulty pack or jar of yeast** Grab a pie dish that has been well-greased, and place beside the dough. Pinch off dough balls about 2\" in diameter. Roll the dough in hand to form a smooth ball. Place in the greased pie dish. Continue the process until you have about 8-11 rolls in the pie dish. **Recommended: Let the yeast rolls sit over night in the chill-chest for extra-fluffy texture, but let them rise a little longer if you leave them overnight the next day** After you have your rolls ready in the pie dish, place them in a warm spot, not covered, to let each roll expand and rise. Once the rolls have risen to your desired size (let the rolls at least sit for 45 minutes or they will become hard and will look like rocks), place them in a 350 degree Fahrenheit oven and let cook for about 15-20 minutes, or until desired color on top of rolls. Glaze with melted butter and serve hot. Enjoy your hot, fluffy, and delicious yeast rolls!"

I added a 1/2 cup of corn meal to the batter, also some garlic & onion powder to taste and/or fish seasoning. I also let the fish sit in the batter for 30 minute This made the batter a bit thicker on the fish and made it stick well. My entire family loved this recipe. I am also expected to make this recipe for my neighbor. She buys the fish I cook it. We now have an awesome batter for our fish. WE all Love IT."
