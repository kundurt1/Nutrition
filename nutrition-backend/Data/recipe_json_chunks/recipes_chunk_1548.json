    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "In the bowl of a food processor, combine flour, salt, and sugar. Add butter and pulse until the mixture resembles the size of small peas. Add the first 5 tablespoons of water, one tablespoon at a time. Check consistency. If the mixture holds together when pinched, the crust is perfect - don't add any more water. If, however, the crust still crumbles apart and won't stay together when pinched, that means it won't stay together while rolling either; so go ahead and add the last tablespoon of water one teaspoon at a time, rechecking the consistency between each teaspoon. The exact amount of water you need will depend on the amount of humidity in the air and therefore in the flour.",
      "Once finished, turn the dough out onto a piece of plastic wrap. Form the dough into a disk, and refrigerate 30 minutes before rolling it out. You want that flour to relax and the butter to be nice and cold - that will ensure you have a nice flaky crust.",
      "Meanwhile, boil a pot of water large enough to fit the stalks of asparagus. Trim the ends of your asparagus making sure they will fit nicely into your quiche pan, arranged like the spokes in a bicycle wheel with the ends touching in the middle. Place the stalks in boiling water, and blanch for 2-3 minutes. Remove from boiling water and place in an ice bath to stop the cooking and keep the color nice and vibrant green. Set aside.",
      "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.",
      "On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough out into a circle a few inches larger than your quiche or pie pan. Fold the dough back up over the rolling pin if needed, to gently lift the crust into the dish. Once the dough is neatly into the pan, make sure it is smoothly tucked into the corners. Trim excess crust from the edges leaving about a 1\" border. Fold the excess dough under itself, making sure not to fold it over the edge of the pan, to ensure a nice even border. Crimp the dough between your fingers to make little pinches. Poke a few fork holes in it to allow the steam to escape, this will prevent a soggy bottom crust.",
      "Blind bake the crust for 5 minutes. This will prevent all of the custard from getting absorbed into the crust making it soggy.",
      "Remove crust from oven and sprinkle with Havarti with Dill cheese. Set aside.",
      "Increase oven temperature to 375 degrees F.",
      "In a large bowl, combine eggs, heavy cream, and milk and whisk thoroughly. Pour egg mixture gently over the cheese mixture.",
      "Place asparagus stalks, tips pointing outwards into a spoke pattern like on a bicycle wheel, making sure the ends come together in the middle.",
      "Bake 40 minutes. At that point, ceck to make sure the crust isn't getting too brown. If it is, then loosely drape a piece of foil over the top, making sure you don't lay it on the actual custard mixture in the middle. Bake 10-12 minutes longer. To test doneness, slide a butter knife under the edge of one of the asparagus stalks. The knife should come out clean. It should be moist - after all the quiche is moist, but the knife should be free of egg mixture. If not, put it back in the oven with your tent foil on top for 3-4 more minutes."

Since the filling for this pie will not be baked in the crust, you want to fully blind bake it. Line the chilled pie shell with an oversized piece of foil. Fill the shell with dried beans (like pinto beans) to serve as your weights and bake in a 350\u00b0 oven for 15-20 minutes. At that point, carefully remove the \"weights\" (See \"Note\" below) and return the shell to the oven to bake until the bottom is browned. Set aside and let cool completely.",

So finely chop your shallots and garlic. Clean the mushrooms and slice them into bite-sized pieces. Clean the asparagus (break off the woody stems) and cut them into bite-sized pieces, grate the Parmesan cheese. And finally, dump your chicken broth into a medium saucepan/pot and start heating it.",

Add more butter (or oil) if necessary and saute the shallots and garlic until they are tender. When the chicken broth is simmering, blanch the asparagus (in the broth) for 2 minutes then remove with a slotted spoon and set aside with the mushrooms. Keep broth warm.",
      "When the shallots and garlic are tender, add the rice. Stir around to coat it with the butter/garlic/shallots and just cook on medium heat for a few minutes. Add the wine and stir until it is absorbed, then start adding the chicken broth 1/2 cup - 1 cup at a time. You can start with a larger amount but as it gets more done, you might want to add smaller amounts, stirring constantly. As soon as the liquid is almost absorbed, add more and continue to stir. Keep doing that and checking the rice for done-ness every so often, and add salt, pepper and thyme to taste (keep in mind that parmesan cheese is salty, so don't overdo the salt please). Once the rice is almost completely cooked, throw in the asparagus and mushrooms. Right before you serve it, throw in the parmesan cheese. Then thank your maker for giving us something as delicious as risotto.",
      "Seriously, a note on substitutes: you can put almost anything in risotto. If you want red peppers or leeks or squash or tomatoes or no vegetables at all, fine. If you want to use veggie broth instead of chicken broth and make it vegetarian, fine. If you want to add diced up chicken, shrimp, scallops or tofu, I certainly won't stop you. Champagne instead of wine? No alcohol at all? Cheese, no cheese-I don't care. Make it how you want it. Just make it. Soon. And smile!"

      "With the bay leaves I usually add about five small or two large. It's really up to you if you like the flavor bay leaves brings to the party then add a couple more. If your jar of dried bay leaves haven't seen the light of day in a while, you will need the extras. As with all spices, they lose some of their flavor the older they are. Now if you are lucky enough to have a bay tree growing in your back yard, you would only need one large bay leaf. Fresh bay leaves are much stronger then the dried ones. I did have a bay tree years ago and can tell the difference between fresh and dry.",
      "Turn the stove up to medium high and put your pot on the burner..",
      "Preparing your beans:",
      "Pour your dried beans into a fine mesh strainer and rinse. Remove any stones and any beans that are discolored. Once your beans are nice and clean, dump them into the pot, turn the heat up to high and get it to a boil.",
      "Dry beans vs. canned beans: I use canned beans all the time when I make my chicken soup or my veggie soup. This is not the time for canned beans. I have never made ham and beans with canned beans. Since the beans are cooked already by the time your ham and spices had flavored your soup, the canned beans would be mush.",
      "Your probably also wondering why I didn't soak my beans overnight. Well, some people do that. I don't.",
      "You can skip the soaking part. You might have to cook your beans a lot longer this way but again, you would lose out on tons of flavor from the ham because the beans are soft after they have soaked overnight and they would be done cooking in less than half the time. This way, it takes about 3 hours from start to finish. What I do is start my beans in the morning at around 10 and they are done by 1 or 1:30 in the afternoon.",
      "Bring the pot of beans and ham up to a full boil and let them boil for about thirty minutes. Turn the heat down just enough to keep a good boil going but not so much of a boil that the liquid is sputtering out of the pot all over your stove. You can put a lid on but leave a gap so some of the steam can escape. You want some of the water to evaporate as it cooks. Stir occasionally and cook it like this for about an hour. Stir and turn the heat down so your ham and beans are at a simmer. Continue to cook it like this until your beans are tender. You can add more pepper at this point and taste it to see if it needs any salt. By now the water has probably turned a nice creamy color from some of the beans cooking down.",
      "As your beans are cooking, the ham and bone are flavoring the liquid. The meat is getting tender and falling from the bone in chunks. When your beans are tender you can pull the bone from the pot. Use a big spoon to scrape the tender meat from the bone into the pot.",
      "That's all there is to it. You can make any type of bean soup you like this way. If you like split pea soup, use dried peas. They will cook much faster than the Great Northern beans."

      "Note - There are two ways to end the recipe - Some people just let the popcorn dry out at room temperature, and some bake in the oven for a short amount of time. I tried both, and decided it was purely up to preference. Leaving it at room temperature yields a more chewy, softer while not soggy popcorn. If you want a more crunchy popcorn, you could bake it for up to 30 minutes at a low temperature.",
      "1. Preheat oven to 140 C[280 F], if you intend on baking it in the end, as mentioned in the above note.",

      "3. Cover with the lid immediately, and keep over high heat until popping has reduced to a few a minute. Give the entire pan a shake every minute or so, to ensure fewer unpopped kernels. This should take about 5 minutes. Transfer to a greased bowl big enough to toss all the popcorn into. Also grease two spatulas/wooden spoons, and lay out three baking sheets with parchment. If you are adding peanuts, add it to the popcorn now.",
      "4. Now for the caramel. First mix together the salt, baking soda and cinnamon. Set aside.",

Let it boil over high heat until it reaches a deep amber color, between 10-15 minutes. The larger pan will make the caramel cook faster, and so, it will take less time than mentioned above.",
      "6. Take it off the heat, pour in the baking soda mixture, and give it a few stirs. The caramel will lighten in color, and foam up. Immediately pour it over the popcorn, working quickly. Toss the popcorn using the two spoons, until it is evenly coated.",
      "7. Lay it onto the waiting baking sheets, in a more or less single layer. Either let cool at room temperature, or pop into the oven, stirring every 10 minutes for up to 30 minutes. Once cool, store in an airtight container."

Add the lid to the pot and place it on the stove element that is heated to medium high heat. Slowly shake the pot back and forth over the element. Do not stop moving the pot or the popcorn may burn. After a minute or two, your popcorn will begin to pop. Keep the pot moving and resist the urge to open the lid. Once the popping sounds have slowed, immediately remove the pot from the stove. Carefully remove the lid, and transfer the popped corn to a large, greased roasting pan. Remove any un-popped kernels.",

You can also use a pastry brush dipped in water to run around the sides of the pot. This will help to make sure that no sugar crystals are left on the sides of the pot (*see note). Once it hits a boil, allow the mixture to boil without stirring for 5 minutes (or if you're using a candy thermometer, until it reaches the soft crack stage or 270 F).

All it takes is one rogue sugar crystal to grab hold of another, and then another, until your entire batch is crystallized and your caramel is grainy. It is also extremely important to wash and thoroughly dry your spatula and candy thermometer (if you're using one) between stirs or each time you remove it from the pan and want to use it again. This will also help from mixing one temperature/stage of sugar into a different temperature/stage of sugar which can cause crystallization. If your caramel popcorn does crystallize, eat it anyway because it still tastes good!"

Mix well, cover with a damp towel and set in a warm place for 1-2 hours.",

Continue mixing in the bread flour, a little at a time, until bread comes together in a sticky ball. (You may not need all the flour.) Knead about 8-10 minutes in the mixer, or turn out onto a floured board and knead by hand, until smooth and elastic. Dough should be a little bit sticky. Place in a greased bowl, cover with a damp cloth, and allow to rise in a warm place until doubled in size (about 45 - 60 minutes).",
      "Punch down the dough. Flour your work surface well. Roll out into a rectangle 12\" wide by 15\" long. Distribute the cubed cheese evenly over the surface of the bread. Roll up the dough from the long edge (just like you do when making cinnamon rolls). Slice into about 15 pieces. Take each piece into your oiled or floured hands and roll into a ball (poke the cheese chunks to the inside). Line them up in a greased 9x13 or 10x15 inch pan. Cover rolls lightly with plastic wrap. Let rise in a warm place until almost doubled in size (30 - 45 minutes). Bake at 350 degrees F about 20-30 minutes until well browned. Turn out of pan and allow to cool.",
      "You may mix either the sponge or the completed dough mixture together in the evening and pop it into the fridge to rise overnight then finish it the next day. The slow rising will allow it to develop more flavor."

      "Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F and lightly grease four 6-inch cake pans with oil. Set aside.",
      "In a large mixing bowl, mash bananas, coconut sugar, and neutral oil. Use a stand mixer or hand-mixer to beat on medium-high speed for 1-2 minutes. Whisk flaxseed meal and filtered water and let this sit to thicken for 4-5 minutes. Stir in almond milk, flax egg, and apple cider vinegar. Set aside.",
      "Combine flour, baking powder and soda, cinnamon, and sea salt in a medium bowl and stir until incorporated. Slowly add dry ingredients to the wet, mixing after each addition. Make sure no clumps of flour remain and then stop mixing. It's important to not over-mix the batter here, so stop when everything is just combined.",
      "Divide batter amongst the four cake pans and bake for 22-25 minutes, or until edges are golden brown and a toothpick poked through the center comes out clean. Leave to cool for 5 minutes before removing from pans. Then,carefully remove cakes and lay on a cooling rack until completely cool.",
      "In the meantime, prepare the ganache. Using a stand-mixer or hand-mixer, mash avocados with almond butter until smooth. In small batches, add cacao powder and mix slowly to avoid making a cacao-powder mess. Add coconut sugar and almond milk and continue mixing until smooth, about 7-8 minutes.",
      "When cakes have cooled, place one layer on a cake dish and cover with a thin layer of ganache, about 1/2 inch thick. Repeat this process with the remaining layers of cake until the cake is covered in ganache. Use a spoon to create swirls on the top layer, and a knife to smooth out the sides of the cake for a sleek finish. Place dark chocolate chips around the bottom of the cake.",
      "Slice and serve immediately. Store leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 2 weeks. Enjoy!"
