      "NOTE: As mentioned in the comments, this is a very thick lasagna and there is often a lot of liquid in the pan. It is best to let the lasagna sit for 10 minutes after removing from the oven to let it absorb some of the liquid. Adding salt to remove liquid as suggested is a great idea if you plan on eating the entire lasagna the day it is made/soon after. However, this lasagna freezes and reheats VERY well and that is largely because the excess liquid when it is originally made helps keep the lasagna moist after being reheated in the microwaving process. Another way to reduce the amount of liquid is to use the type of noodles that you don't have to pre-cook, however, I prefer the texture of the ones that need precooking."

      "Make the barbecue sauce: Melt the butter in a heavy saucepan; add in the shallot, garlic, and celery; cook over medium heat until lightly browned, 3-4 minutes.",
      "Stir in the coffee, ketchup, cream, soy sauce, bourbon, Worcestershire sauce, vinegar, mustard, liquid smoke, and brown sugar; bring to a boil.",
      "Decrease heat slightly and let the sauce simmer until thick and richly flavored, 8-10 minutes, whisking from time to time.",
      "Taste for seasoning, adding salt and pepper to taste and more brown sugar (or any other ingredient) as necessary.",
      "The sauce can be refrigerated, covered, for several weeks; let return to room temperature before serving.",
      "Make the rub: put the ground coffee, salt, chile powder, onion powder, garlic powder, coriander, pepper, and cinnamon in a small bowl; mix using your fingers to break up any lumps.",
      "Place a rack of ribs meat side down on a baking sheet; remove the thin, papery membrane from the back of the rack; repeat with the other rack.",
      "Sprinkle the rub over both sides of the ribs, rubbing it onto the meat; cover the ribs with plastic wrap and let cure in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour or as long as 4 hours (the longer the ribs cure, the richer the flavor will be).",
      "Meanwhile, make the mop sauce: melt the butter in a saucepan over medium heat.",
      "Add in the brewed coffee, vinegar, and bourbon; let simmer gently until blended, about 1 minute.",
      "Whisk in the salt and pepper to taste; let the mop sauce cool to room temperature.",
      "Set up the grill for indirect grilling and preheat to medium; place a large dip pan in the center of the grill.",
      "**For gas grill, place the wood chips in the smoker box or in a smoker pouch and run the grill on high until you see smoke, then decrease heat to medium.",
      "When ready to cook, brush and oil the grill grate; place the ribs bone side down in the center of the grate over the drip pan and away from the heat; cover the grill and cook the ribs for 45 minutes.",
      "Mop or brush the ribs on both sides with some of the mop sauce; recover the grill and continue cooking the ribs until well browned, cooked through, and tender enough to pull apart with your fingers, 30-45 minutes longer (1 1/4 to 1 1/2 hours total).",
      "When the ribs are done, the meat will have shrunk back from the ends of the bones by about 1/4 inch.",
      "Mop the ribs once or twice more with the sauce.",
      "Just before serving, brush both sides of the ribs with some of the Cafe au Lait Barbecue Sauce.",
      "Move the ribs directly over the fire and grill until the sauce is sizzling, 1-3 minutes per side.",
      "Transfer ribs to a large platter or cutting board; let ribs rest for a few minutes, then cut the racks in half or into single ribs.",
      "Serve at once with the remaining Cafe au Lait Barbecue Sauce on the side, or drizzle over the ribs."

      "Paula Wolfert shares her tips:",
      "Located on Morocco's Atlantic coast, south of Casablanca and north of Essaouira, the city of Safi is known for its seafood specialties.",
      "To most closely approximate the flavor of Moroccan lemons, Wolfert recommends Meyer lemons for this recipe. This lemon/mandarin orange hybrid, in season in January and February, has yellow-orange flesh, a smooth rind, and a sweeter flavor than other lemons.",
      "To sterilize a mason jar for the lemons, place it upside down in a steamer and steam for 10 minutes. Using tongs (wrap the ends in rubber bands for a better grip), remove the hot jar and dry it upside down on a paper towel-lined baking sheet in a warm oven. To sterilize the jar's top, boil it in water for 5 minutes, then remove with tongs.",
      "When you're ready to use a lemon, remove it with clean utensils to avoid contaminating the inside of the jar with bacteria. This way, the remaining contents of the jar will not need to be refrigerated."

      "For the Crust: Process 3/4 cup flour, salt, and sugar in food processor until combined, about two 1-second pulses. Add butter and shortening and process until homogenous dough just starts to collect in uneven clumps, about 10 seconds; dough will resemble cottage cheese curds with some very small pieces of butter remaining, but there should be no uncoated flour. Scrape bowl with rubber spatula and redistribute dough evenly around processor blade. Add remaining 1/2 cup flour and pulse until mixture is evenly distributed around bowl and mass of dough has been broken up, 4 to 6 quick pulses. Empty mixture into medium bowl.",
      "Sprinkle vodka and water over mixture. With rubber spatula, use folding motion to mix, pressing down on dough until dough is slightly tacky and sticks together. Flatten dough into 4-inch disk. Wrap in plastic and refrigerate at least 45 minutes or up to 2 days.",
      "Adjust oven rack to lowest position, place rimmed baking sheet on rack, and heat oven to 400 degrees. Remove dough from refrigerator and roll out on generously floured (up to 1/4 cup) work surface to 12-inch circle about 1/8 inch thick. Roll dough loosely around rolling pin and unroll into pie plate, leaving at least 1-inch overhang on each side. Working around circumference, ease dough into plate by gently lifting edge of dough with one hand while pressing into plate bottom with other hand. Refrigerate 15 minutes.",
      "Trim overhang to 1/2 inch beyond lip of pie plate. Fold overhang under itself; folded edge should be flush with edge of pie plate. Using thumb and forefinger, flute edge of dough. Refrigerate dough-lined plate until firm, about 15 minutes.",
      "Remove pie pan from refrigerator, line crust with foil, and fill with pie weights or pennies. Bake on rimmed baking sheet 15 minutes. Remove foil and weights, rotate plate, and bake 5 to 10 additional minutes until crust is golden brown and crisp. Remove pie plate and baking sheet from oven.",
      "For the Filling: While pie shell is baking, whisk cream, milk, eggs, yolks, and vanilla together in medium bowl. Combine pumpkin puree, yams, sugar, maple syrup, ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt in large heavy-bottomed saucepan; bring to sputtering simmer over medium heat, 5 to 7 minutes. Continue to simmer pumpkin mixture, stirring constantly and mashing yams against sides of pot, until thick and shiny, 10 to 15 minutes.",
      "Remove pan from heat and whisk in cream mixture until fully incorporated. Strain mixture through fine-mesh strainer set over medium bowl, using back of ladle or spatula to press solids through strainer. Re-whisk mixture and transfer to warm pre-baked pie shell. Return pie plate with baking sheet to oven and bake pie for 10 minutes. Reduce heat to 300 degrees and continue baking until edges of pie are set (instant-read thermometer inserted in center registers 175 degrees), 20 to 35 minutes longer. Transfer pie to wire rack and cool to room temperature, 2 to 3 hours. Cut into wedges and serve."

Add the oil and cook 1/2 of the chicken skin side down on medium high heat. Remove and set to the side and then cook the other 1/2. You don't want to crowd the pan as they cook. You just want to cook the chicken until all the skin and chicken is golden brown. Then lastly add the sausage pieces and once again, cook until golden brown and remove to the plate with the chicken.",

      "Sauce -- Add in the flour and cook 1 minute to mix in with the onions and then add the bay leaf, mustard, broth, and beer and bring to a boil. Reduce to low and arrange the chicken in pot in one layer. Don't forget to pour in any juices from the plate too. Good Stuff! Now if you can, transfer to the oven and cook at 375 uncovered, or you can continue to cook on the stove top on low to medium low also uncovered, but the oven to me gives it a better taste. It takes about 40 minutes until the chicken is falling all the bone.",

In England, you'll find \"caramel shortbread,\" which has a layer of caramel and a layer of chocolate on top of the shortbread. It's wonderful (of course!). I've tried various ways of doing this and various kinds of caramel, but it's been a while and I don't remember what works best. It can be tricky not to make a mess!"
