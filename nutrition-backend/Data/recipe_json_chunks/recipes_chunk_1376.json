Cover the pan loosely with plastic wrap and let the dough rise until nearly tripled in volume, about 1-2 hours in a warm, draft free part of the kitchen. I like to use the microwave oven with the door slightly open so the heat of the light warms the dough and helps it rise. \r\n\r\nPreheat the oven to 500 degrees. Arrange a pizza stone on the bottom rack of the oven.",
      "TOP THE PIZZA WITH LAYERS: Spread a layer of marinara sauce over the dough. Easy does it! You should be able to see the dough through it. Then sprinkle the shredded cheese blend, then the basil (and spinach), then the chopped fresh mozzarella, then a sprinkle of dried Italian spices and finally a drizzle of olive oil on top and along the sides. \r\n\r\nBake on the pizza stone (on the bottom rack) for about 15-20 minutes or until the sides are bubbling and the cheese is nicely browned. Make sure the bottom of the pizza is nice and brown. Let the pizza rest for 10 minutes to firm up the cheese. Cut into squares using a pizza cutter and kitchen shears."

Set each piece of sausage on wire rack (no need to wash the rack beforehand). Place baking pan in oven and roast for about 30 minutes, or until sausage is browned and caramelized. It usually is not necessary to turn the sausage, but you can if you wish. Remove pan from oven and turn off oven.",
      "On cutting board, cut onion into medium-small dice. Thinly slice garlic cloves, then roughly chop. (You don't want the garlic pieces too small or they will burn.) Heat a large, heavy saucepan or Dutch oven over medium-low heat. Add olive oil. When oil has warmed, add onion and saute until just beginning to turn golden brown (about 10 minutes), stirring occasionally with a wooden spoon. Add garlic to pan and stir frequently. When the garlic aroma becomes heady and fragrant (watch carefully to make sure garlic is not browning too quickly), clear a hot spot in the pan with your wooden spoon. Add tomato paste and saute until the tomatoes begins to release their fragrance. Mix tomato paste with onion and garlic mixture and add 5.5 ounces of water to pan. (Easiest way to do this is to simply fill tomato paste can with water.) Drain juice from canned tomatoes and reserve about a cup of it. Add bay leaf and tomatoes to pan. You can add tomatoes whole -- they will cook down. Or simply cut each tomato into about four pieces with kitchen shears before adding them to the pot.",
      "Bring tomato-onion-garlic mixture to a simmer and add pork bones and sausages, nestling them carefully into the sauce. You want enough meat to flavor the sauce, but not so much that it overwhelms the tomato sauce. Lower heat and cook tomato sauce at a low simmer for about two hours, stirring occasionally. During the first hour of cooking, if level of sauce in the pan begins to evaporate, add reserved tomato liquid, as needed. After the first hour of cooking, add water to the sauce instead if sauce is looking too thick. The sauce will smell wonderful as it cooks, infusing your home with pork and tomato aromas. Inhale and savor, and pour yourself a glass of your favorite red wine.",
      "After about two hours of cooking, begin to add salt, about 1 teaspoon at a time. Let sauce cook for about 15 minutes, so that the salt's flavor can be absorbed before adding more. Add a few grinds of fresh black pepper and the parsley. Taste and adjust the seasonings until the flavors are to your liking. Continue to cook for another half hour or so. (Total cooking time should be at least 2 1/2 to 3 hours, but honestly you cannot cook this sauce too much. The longer it simmers, the better it will taste.)",

If you can't taste the salt, then add a little more. When water is rapidly boiling, add dried pasta. Give a good stir with a slotted spoon and bring back to a boil. Cook for about eight minutes, then begin tasting the pasta. When it is al dente (just slightly chewy, but not hard) drain pasta, but reserve a cup or two of the cooking water.",

    "title": "mango-lime trifle with brown butter cake",
    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "Make the cake: Heat the oven to 350\u00b0 F. Butter and lightly flour three 9-inch cake pans, tapping out any excess flour. In a heavy-bottomed saucepan, melt the butter. Cook over medium to low heat, stirring once in a while until foamy, then continue to cook, stirring frequently, until you are seeing small brown bits in the butter and it smells nutty. This whole process takes 10 to 15 minutes. Scrape your butter and any browned bits into the bowl of your stand mixer, then put that bowl into an ice bath in the fridge. Let sit for about 10 minutes, until the butter along the outside of the bowl starts to set and turn opaque. Meanwhile, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt. Put the bowl with the butter (once ready) onto the mixer, and beat until creamy. Add the sugar and beat until light and fluffy. Then add the egg yolks, beating to combine, followed by the whole eggs, beating to combine again, then the vanilla. \r\n\r\nBeat in the dry ingredients and buttermilk in 3 alternating additions, scraping down the bowl as necessary. Pour the batter evenly into the 3 prepared pans and bake, rotating the pans once while baking, for about 30 minutes. A toothpick or cake tester should come out clean, or with a couple dry crumbs. \r\n\r\nCool the cakes in the pans for 15 minutes, then turn out and allow them to cool completely on racks while you work on the rest of the trifle. Once cool, chop the cake up into 1 to 2-inch square pieces.",
      "Pastry cream: Heat the milk, vanilla seeds and pod, and salt in a pan and put over medium heat. Bring to a boil. Meanwhile, heat a small saucepan with some water to a boil. \r\n\r\nIn a large mixing bowl, whisk the sugar, cornstarch, and eggs until smooth. Don't let these items sit together because the sugar can \"cook\" the yolks and make them grainy. Slowly add 1/2 of the milk mixture into the egg mixture and whisk constantly to temper them. Add the remaining milk. Place this bowl over the saucepan of boiling water. Whisk constantly until you get a thick consistency and the mixture registers 180\u00b0 F, about 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool for about 10 minutes, until it registers 140\u00b0 F, and then incorporate the butter, one tablespoon at a time, until smooth. Cover the surface with plastic wrap, directly touching the cream. Let cool completely in the fridge.",
      "Fruit puree: Puree the mango puree, lime juice, lime zest, and 1/2 cup sugar in a blender or food processor. Add the Champagne to taste, if using. Set aside.",
      "Assembly: Whip the whipping cream and tablespoon of sugar in a mixer until it holds medium peaks. Then begin putting the trifle together...\r\n\r\nBegin with 1 pan's worth of the cut up cake squares, scattered along the bottom of your trifle dish. Cover the cake with 1/3 of your fruit puree, then 1/3 of your mango (and raspberries, if using), 1/3 of the toasted coconut, 1/3 of the pastry cream, and finally 1/3 of the whipped cream. Repeat 2 more times. Smooth out the top of your last layer of whipped cream. The trifle can keep, in the fridge, for a day, and I prefer to wait at least a couple hours before serving so the fruit puree cake seep into the cake a little."

      "You also need special utensils (sorry!), but they are really awesome special utensils: a lefse grill; rolling pin and pastry \"sock\" for the rolling pin; a cloth covered pastry board; a lefse stick; and a potato ricer. And a bunch of ziplock freezer bags to store your finished product because lefse in the fridge is only good for a couple of days, but if you freeze it early, then you can thaw and warm it as needed it and it's nearly as delicious as fresh.",
      "Peel the potatoes, cut them into even chunks and boil them in a large pot of water until just tender when poked with a fork. You don't want them to be mushy. Drain the potatoes, then press them through the ricer into a large bowl. Mash in the butter, cream, sugar, salt, and baking powder, making sure you get rid of any lumps. At this point you have the world's most delicious mashed potatoes, you may wish to steal a little bite. Leave the potatoes uncovered to cool somewhere - in the fridge or a cold entry way - at least 7 hours, preferably overnight.",
      "The next day, when you are ready to griddle, prepare a place to stack the lefse rounds as they finish cooking. We put a large plastic bag, covered with a clean towel on the counter and stack the rounds on top of each other on top of this, and cover them with another towel and plastic bag. It seems unwieldy but it really works to keep them from drying out and losing their nice texture. Preheat your griddle - ungreased - to 450-500F.",
      "Put 1/4 of the cold potato mixture in a bowl and use your hands to mix in 1 1/2 cups of flour. Keep the rest of the dough in the fridge as you work with this portion. Roll the floured dough into golfball sized balls and place these in a separate bowl. Flour the pastry board and the rolling pin (with the sock on it) are well floured. You need to use a lot of flour to keep the lefse from sticking to things. Sticky spots are your enemy! They can cause disasters, and if you get one, scrape it up immediately and rub a whole bunch of flour into it. Place a dough ball onto the pastry board and gently roll it out until it is paper thin. We generally have the goal of rolling out large circles, but they often wind up looking like various countries and continents. Carefully lift the rolled lefse by skooching your lefse stick all the way under it, right down the equator line of the lefse, so the tip of the stick pokes out on the other side. Lift and transfer to the griddle by laying one of the hanging sides of the lefse flat on the grill (the other side will be folded over it as if it were a quesadilla), then rolling the stick and unfurling the other half (the folded over half) so the entire thing is lying flat on the grill. When the lefse has bubbled up a bunch, lift an edge and peak to see if it has brown spots. When it does, gently use the stick to flip the lefse (in basically the same way as you transferred it to the grill) and cook the other side just until it has brown spots. Each side only takes 1-2 minutes. If they start to get crispy either you have cooked the lefse for too long or your griddle is on a bit too high. When the lefse is done, transfer it to your prepared space (with the towels and plastic bags). (You can check out the pictures for illustration of these steps, though I'm afraid the photos went up in reverse order, and I don't know how to change them!)",
      "Keep cooking the lefse until you have used all your dough. As you run out of prepared dough balls, take another quarter of the cold potato mixture, mix in another 1 1/2 cups of flour and roll more balls.

      "First, hard boil your eggs. Put eggs in small saucepan. Add enough cold water so that eggs are thoroughly covered. Add a teaspoon salt to the pan. Turn heat to high. When water starts to boil, turn heat off pan and cover. Leave eggs for 15 minutes, then drain in colander and rinse with cold water until eggs feel cool to the touch. Carefully peel eggs and slice into small dice.",
      "While eggs are cooking, add about 1 quart cold water to medium-size pan and turn heat on burner to medium-high. Wash potatoes. If your fingerlings are tiny, cut in half; if they are larger in size, cut into quarters. Do not peel. When water has reached a lively simmer, add potatoes and 1/2 tablespoon salt to water. Turn heat down slightly so that potatoes stay at a simmer, but aren't at an angry boil. Cook potatoes for about 10-15 minutes. Test a potato with a sharp knife for doneness. You want it thoroughly tender. There is nothing worse than not-quite-cooked potatoes in potato salad! Drain potatoes in colander. Return to sauce pan and cover to keep warm.",
      "While potatoes are cooking, make the garlic and oil dressing. Peel garlic and mince into very tiny dice. Put garlic and olive oil in small heavy skillet. Turn heat on burner to low. Garlic will start to bubble in about 4-5 minutes. Give an occasional stir once in a while. You may be tempted to turn heat up, so that garlic will cook faster. Resist this impulse -- garlic burns very easily and it only takes a second or two! About two minute after garlic starts to bubble, add crushed red pepper flakes. Give the ingredients in the pan a good stir, so that the red pepper flakes get coated with the oil. Continue to cook for another five minutes or so. Take garlic off heat when it starts to look translucent and it is giving off a lovely, heady aroma. You want it to stop cooking just before it turns brown. The best way to tell if it is done is to taste it. It should taste sweet and garlicky (not at all raw) and should be a little crunchy.",
      "Finally, it is salad assembly time! Put potatoes (hopefully, they are still warm) in serving bowl or picnic container. Add diced egg and parsley. Pour garlic and oil mixture over eggs and potatoes, making sure to get every last drop of the garlic oil and all of the little bits of garlic. It may look like too much dressing at first, but don't worry -- the potatoes will absorb it all. Add lemon juice. Using a large spoon, mix ingredients carefully, so that the potatoes and eggs don't break apart but get a nice coating of the garlic and oil. Find a fork and sample the salad. It may need a bit more salt or possibly more lemon juice. I usually don't add black pepper to this salad because of the zippiness the red pepper flakes provide.",
      "Serve immediately while the potato salad is still warm. Or pack in a picnic basket to eat at room temperature al fresco. Or stick in the fridge or in a cooler, filled with ice packs, to enjoy cold. Savor every bite!"

More curds will appear and you will slowly begin to see the greenish whey. Add the last tablespoon of juice and with this, you should be able to see a clear, greenish whey separating from the curds. Switch off the gas immediately at this point. Depending on the acidity of the juice, the amount of juice you require may differ. Start with one tablespoon at a time until you achieve the results.",
      "Once the curds and whey have separated, you'll want to work quickly. Line another pot with double-layered cheesecloth, making sure the cheesecloth is long enough to be bundled up and hung later. Pour the contents of your pot into the cheesecloth to drain the whey and collect the curds. Wash the curds by running them under cold water to remove the lemon taste.",
      "Tie up the cheesecloth in a tight bundle and let it drain for about 30 minutes. Then place weight on the cheese to get it to be flatter and drain out extra moisture. I generally place it between two cutting boards and set a heavy pot on top of them for 1 to 2 hours. Adding too much weight for too long will drain out too much moisture from the cheese, resulting in hard and crumbly paneer.",
      "Wrap your paneer and store it in the fridge for up to a week. I prefer to use it as early as possible.",
      "For use in curries, cut the paneer into evenly size cubes. You might want to trim out any irregular edges to get even cubes.",
      "Note: Lately, I add a good pinch of salt to the milk for more flavor, but it is not essential. Other flavorings like cumin, herbs, and other spices can be kneaded into the curds before draining. Yogurt can be used in place of lemon for those with a sensitivity to citrus. About 1/4 cup of yogurt should work for this recipe, but it will depend on the quality and sourness of the yogurt."

You will need around 2 cups to 2 1/2 cups to get 4 cups of cooked chickpeas. If there is not time, do not worry, canned is okay. Try for Organic and make sure that if you are buying dried they are of good quality. Look at the size and colour and see if it has an expiration date on the bag.",

Add the 2 tablespoons of oil and the onions to a pot/pan and fry the onions until they start to change to a nice brown colour. You will need to frequently stir so they do not stick to the bottom of the pan. You can always add a little more ghee or oil if they are constantly sticking. While you are waiting peel the tomatoes and roughly chop. Set aside.",

Mix thoroughly and then add the tomatoes. Then add the cooked chickpeas and stir well. Once the mix is simmering add the coconut milk, sweet potatoes and mango. Stir well and allow to simmer. NOT boil, simmer. Let simmer for around 25 minutes. Taste at this point and if you think you need a little more salt feel free to add. Once done place in a nice bowl, sprinkle on top the peanuts, cilantro and the lime juice and serve either as a main meal or as a side dish. If you make too much don't panic. It makes a great lunch the next day and will freeze as well. Put in Freezer Ziploc bags air removed and lay flat. For other great recipes using Berbere please see my website.

    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "Preheat grill; put your grill at a good temperature where you would usually grill chicken. I have found, since we've gotten a new grill recently, that heat pockets/temperature vary from grill to grill. Prepare the chicken breasts by pounding them lightly to flatten. They don't need to be as flat as if you were cooking them stovetop, but about 1/2\" thick is good for being 'thin' but still 'grillable'. I do this by putting the chicken between two sheets of parchment paper and pounding with an old wine bottle. This also works well inside of a gallon-sized ziploc bag, if you don't have parchment paper. When all four pieces are flattened, give the chicken a quick sprinkle with salt and pepper before throwing them on the grill.",
      "Clean your mushrooms to get the dirt off and trim the stems as close to the cap as possible. Thinly slice all of your mushrooms.",
      "Heat a large saute pan on the stove (med-high to high). Add 1 Tbsp of butter. I add the butter in increments based on how the mushrooms are cooking. Start with less butter, and you can always add more later. I put about 3 Tbsp of butter for every 20-25 mushrooms. Saute mushrooms until they are browned nicely and softened to the touch.",
      "Now is a good time to put the chicken on the grill. Chicken can grill while you are working on your sauce. I usually have the hubby go outside and grill while I cook the sauce in the kitchen. You can also grill your chicken on a grill pan on the stove if you don't have a grill or it's just way too cold outside. Just keep a good eye on it, since you will be multitasking with the sauce at the same time.",
      "Once the mushrooms are browned nicely and softened, slowly add the 1 cup of marsala cooking wine. After a few minutes you will notice that the wine will start to simmer. Turn the temperature of the burner down just a little bit (medium-med/high). Make a \"hole\" in the center of your pan out of the mushrooms, so the mushrooms surround the edge of the pan and there is a pool of marsala wine in the middle of the pan. While stirring just the middle area, slowly sprinkle in the 1 tsp of corn starch. Make sure that you have all the clumps stirred in and the liquid is smoothed out. This will thicken the sauce very nicely. I have tried to do this without the cornstarch and just let the wine cook down and reduce, and the flavor just isn't right. I have also tried to add a bit of water first before reducing...still doesn't give it the right flavor or consistency. Once all corn starch is blended into the middle liquid, stir the entire pan of mushrooms and liquid together. Heat the pan back up (med/high to high) and let the liquid simmer and reduce slightly. You will want the sauce to look like its mostly mushrooms in more of a gravy looking sauce, than something too soupy. When you get it where you want it, add the chopped flat leaf parsley. I put in about 1 Tbsp of finely chopped parsley. It gives it a pop of green and adds a level of freshness to the sauce. You can now put the sauce onto Low heat until your chicken is done or you are ready to serve.",
      "Plate each chicken breast and pour 1/4 of the sauce over each piece. I like to serve with either couscous, capellini, or sometimes (if I have some extra time) creamy mashed potatoes. The hubby likes it with garlic bread to sop up all the leftover sauce."

I tend to add various roasted peppers to a lot of things to bring a little heat to a dish and some smoky earthiness. But this dish works well without the jalapeno too.",
      "Lightly salt the garlic and saute it in the rendered fat from the sausage. Add a little olive oil if needed. Once the garlic is just turning golden, add the diced roasted jalapeno pepper (if you're using it), diced tomatoes and a ladle-full of clam broth from the pot you cooked the clams in. I put in enough clam broth to create a very soupy sauce. Add the salt, sugar, red pepper flakes, oregano and half of the seasoned pepper, and cook until the clam broth has reduced by one third. Add the cooked sausage and clams. Toss around to rewarm, but not long enough to start cooking the clams again. Nothing is worse in this dish than rubbery overcooked clams. At the end I do a couple squeezes of lemon slices to balance the acid.",

      "NOTE: The ratio between flour and water in this dough, is 1 part flour to 0.9 part water by weight, so that's a \"90% hydration,\" sometimes up to 95%, which means 100 grams of flour will need 90 grams to about 95 grams of water. It's very, very wet. The roti dough absorbs all this water in 2 stages, which somehow increases the amount of water the flour can absorb, and the smoothness and shine of the overall texture. I've tried my best to provide the measurement in volume, but it's highly recommended that you measure by weight. Because of it's super-wetness, I'm not sure if this can be done by hand. Perhaps mixing the dough vigorously with the back of a wooden spoon would work.",
      "Combine the bread flour and salt in a stand mixer with a dough hook. Check the temperature of the warm water-it should be too warm to leave your fingers in comfortably for more than a few seconds. Add it into the stand mixer and mix on low first for a couple of minutes. The dough should look \"dry\" in the very beginning, then extremely wet and sticky once the flour and water are completely blended. Increase to high-speed and beat the dough for another 6 to 7 minutes, scraping down the sides once in between. At the end of which, the dough should be able to pull away from the bowl when machine's running, but sticks right back once the machine stops.",
      "Now add the cold water one tablespoon at a time. After adding the first, knead on high for 1 to 2 minutes until the dough pulls away cleanly from the bowl, then add the next tablespoon and repeat. Check the texture of the dough, which should be extremely shiny, smooth, and elastic, like lava-silk with small pockets of air within. The dough should run to the side when the bowl's tilted. Suspend it high in the air, and it should droop down and stretch slowly without breaking. If it breaks or tears easily or seems grainy in texture, it's too dry. Add another tablespoon of water. If it doesn't pull away cleanly from the mixer bowl, it's too wet. Add a couple tablespoons of flour. Once the dough reaches the correct consistency, cover the bowl with plastic-wrap. Let it sit for 1 to 2 hours (meanwhile make the dip).",

Lightly flour 1 portion, form it into a ball, then gently and slowly roll it out into 1/4- to 1/8-inch thick circle (keep the bottom floured or it'll stick). Brush the top evenly with clarified butter and sprinkle with a bit of salt, then roll it into a log and curl it up like a snail. With the seam/curl-side facing sideway (smooth side-up), shape it back into a ball by gently tucking the dough underneath itself with your hands. Lightly flour the dough again, then gently and slowly roll it out into 1/4-inch thick disk (thicker roti will be stringy and chewy, whereas thinner roti will be crispy and flaky). Brush a sheet of parchment with clarified butter and transfer the dough on top. Brush the dough again with clarified butter.",

      "Most likely you'll have a sturgeon steak that's a bit less than a pound. I cut the two filets off the backbone for two servings although you could leave it whole until after it's cooked. Put alder chips (one nice handful) in the center of the roasting pan, place the rack on top of the pan and the fish (cleaned and dry) on top of the rack then make a tent of foil and crimp it well all around the edges of the pan. It will take about a half hour to smoke so plan accordingly.",
      "Place your smoker over a burner and turn on high. In four or five minutes you should see smoke escaping. Turn the burner off, leave the fish covered and wait 30 minutes. At the end of 30 minutes, the fish should be perfectly cooked. If it's a bit under done give it another blast of heat for a minute or two. If it's overdone curse me all you want.",
      "While the fish is smoking, lightly saute one slice of bacon cut into lardoons with about a quarter of thinly sliced onion and a clove of garlic cut into julienne. Cut one or two celery stalks into thin batons one to two inches long and blanch for two or three minutes. Peel and cut the cucumber the same length, remove the seeds and cut into small wedges say a quarter inch thick. Blanch for a couple of minutes. For pickles I used 3 Zergut kosher dill pickles cut into batons about an eighth of an inch. They're small, no more than a couple of inches long. What I aimed for was more or less equal amounts of onion, celery, cucumber, and pickle but this time you're going to eat this not me. Do what you like. Toss the celery, cucumber pickle in with the bacon and onion, wet it with a little cream (it's your waist and your taste) and cook it enough so it's not too runny. The vegetables are now ready.",
      "Plate the vegetables, put the fish on top, and garnish with chopped fresh dill if you have it. Don't be shy and eat the yellow fat, it really picks up the smoke. BTW it's unlikely that you'll ever use that pan for anything but a smoker after this. It warps and gets wicked stains but clean it up for lots of other smoked fish possibilities. Clean up isn't so bad when the kitchen smells of alder and smoked fish."

Add a few peeled, whole cloves of garlic. Bring to a boil and season with salt and pepper.",
      "When white froth forms on the top of the pot, skim off and discard. Lower heat and simmer for 3-4 hours, partially covered. After about 2 hours, check the breasts, thighs, and legs for doneness. If they are cooked through, remove them from the pot. Remove the meat from the bones and discard the fat. Return the bones to the pot. Skim the fat off the top of the soup, if desired. I do this, because too much fat can cause the soup to feel oily. To skim the fat, gently lower a spoon parallel to the surface of the stock and dip one edge under the surface. The fat should fill the spoon. Put the fat into a small bowl next to the stove and save for matzoh balls or for cooking other food. Chicken fat, or schmaltz, can be used in the place of butter when pan frying (the kosher version of bacon fat).",

Remove the carrots, onions , garlic and celery.

You now have a traditional Jewish chicken soup.",

      "Add the two types of flour to a large mixing bowl, and whisk to combine. Form a well in the center of the flour. Make the flour look like a volcano. Add the eggs and extra yolk to the center of the flour volcano. Using a fork, beat the eggs in the center of the flour, and gradually incorporate more flour from the periphery. When about two thirds of the flour has been incorporated into the eggs, I like to use my bare hands to push the remaining flour into the wet dough mixture and form a ball of dough. You can also just keep using the fork.",
      "Remove the wet dough ball from the mixing bowl and place it on a good kneading surface (a table, counter, cutting board, whatever works). Wash your hands. You don't want stray clumps of dry crumbly dough getting incorporated into your nice dough. Set yourself up with a small bowl of extra OO flour to be used as bench flour. Knead the dough for approximately 10 minutes. The better you knead the dough now, the easier it will be to roll it out later. If the dough feels too tacky and sticks to your hands, liberally dust it with bench flour. (Don't worry if you need to repeatedly add extra bench flour.) After 10 minutes of kneading, the dough should feel smooth and pliable. Wrap it in plastic wrap and let it rest at room temperature for 30 minutes.",
      "While the dough is resting, turn your attention to the savoy cabbage. Remove the core, and cut the cabbage into 1 inch squares. Set a large skillet over high heat, and add just enough grapeseed oil to cover the bottom of the skillet. When the oil begins to lightly smoke, add the cabbage. Watch out, it might splatter. You want to cook the cabbage in a single, even layer, so you will likely have to cook the cabbage in batches. Toss the cabbage in the skillet. When it is wilted and slightly charred, after approximately 2 minutes, remove it from the pan. When all of the cabbage is cooked, season it with the crushed caraway seeds, lemon zest, lemon juice, and salt to taste. Set the cabbage aside.",
      "Roll out your pasta: Depending on how much room you have to work with, you should probably divide the dough into two or three balls, and work in batches, rolling out one ball at a time and keeping the rest of the dough covered in plastic wrap. Set your pasta roller to the widest setting, and pass the dough through. If it feels tacky, sprinkle it with semolina flour. Fold the dough over on itself in half, and pass it through the widest setting again. Repeat this step until the dough looks smooth and is shaped like a rectangle. Adjust the pasta roller so that it is one notch thinner, and pass the dough through. Continue passing the dough on incrementally smaller settings. When you have passed the dough through the second-thinnest setting, you're done. Using a pasta cutter, cut the dough into 1 inch squares the shape of a handkerchief. Dust a parchment-lined rimmed baking sheet with semolina flour, and transfer the handkerchief pasta to the baking sheet. Top with extra semolina so that it doesn't stick to itself. You can make the pasta ahead of time and store it in the freezer.",
      "Set a large pot of water over high heat and bring the water to a boil. While you are waiting for the water to boil, set a large skillet over medium heat. Add the butter. When it is melted, add the garlic and the chili flakes. Cook until the garlic just begins to brown. Turn off the heat.",
      "When the water is boiling, add salt so that the water tastes like the ocean. Add the pasta and cook until it floats to the surface, approximately 1 to 2 minutes. Drain the pasta, reserving 1/4 cup of pasta water. Add the cooked pasta and the reserved pasta water to the skillet with the garlic and butter, and set the heat to high. Add the cabbage and cook, stirring occasionally, until the liquid in the pan is bubbling and steaming. Reduce the heat to medium, and add the provolone. Toss the pasta with the cheese. The cheese should melt and begin to form a creamy sauce for the pasta. Add the speck, and continue to toss the pasta. When the cheese is fully melted, taste the pasta. Adjust with salt or lemon juice as necessary. Serve it up."

For summer, substitute basil and grated summer squash, olive oil, and fresh goat cheese (chevre) for the vegetables, butter, and creme fraiche. If you use olive oil, keep the heat at medium or lower since olive oil has a lower smoking point and will degrade, causing harmful free radicals, at higher temperatures; adjust cooking time accordingly. In the fall, substitute escarole or another chicory and apple, ghee (slightly browned clarified butter), and Cheddar for the vegetables, butter, and creme fraiche. For winter, substitute green cabbage, caramelized onions, and duck fat for the vegetables and butter."

However, if you have a large enough saute, feel free to dirty another dish. This is another critical step. It wakes the aromatics up and really gets them going. Overlook this one, and your finished product will likely be weak and lifeless like the turkey, and you'll have what basically amounts to turkey water.",
      "Stock it up!\r\nPut everything in the pot, veggies on top, and cover it with water, and get some heat under that baby! Now is the time to add the sage, thyme, peppercorns, and bay leaves you forgot to saute with the rest of the aromatics in the previous step.",

Why? Because now you're going to let the stock cool and refrigerate it overnight. As it cools completely, all the fat will rise to the top for easy removal while you're combatting your hangover tomorrow morning. Remember how I said this was a 'project'? I wasn't kidding. Fear not, we're entering the home stretch. Take some Anacin, drink some water and go get some sleep.",
      "Skim and salt.\r\nGood morning, Count Drunkula! Grab some hair of the dog, and the ladle you threw across the room last night, wash it, and then carefully skim off the layer of fat that has risen to the top of the stock revealing the beautiful, golden brown goodness beneath. Wash the pot that you left on the stove last night and gently reheat the stock, tasting as it heats up and add salt accordingly.",
      "Let me clarify that for you.\r\nYou're not done yet. Beat the egg whites until fluffy. As your pot begins to boil, give it a strong stir and drop in your egg whites. Kill the heat, and walk away. Maybe use the egg yolks in an omelette to effectively lay waste to your hangover.",
      "Skim and store.\r\nNow that the cysteine in the eggs is coursing through your system, skim the raft of egg white out of the pot and break out your vacuum packager while the stock cools. Ladle a cup or two into a muffin tin with roughly half-cup wells lined with plastic wrap, and freeze. Portion out the rest of the stock, one cup at a time into vacuum bags and let your vacuum sealer do the rest. Lay the bags flat on a sheet pan and freeze. After the muffin tin has frozen up solid, pop out the portions and stow them in a freezer bag.",

      "NOTE: Even though it's really fast to make fried garlic, I still like to do it in large amount and freeze the extra for whenever I need it. It comes very handy in sprinkling onto savoury oatmeals and noodle soups. So we're making twice the amount this dish will need (or if you want to double the recipe for a bigger crowd, you'll need all of the fried garlics).",
      "NOTE 2: If you don't have fish sauce, I know it'll be very tempting to just replace it with salt, instead of making a trip to buy a bottle. DON'T. It will make a night-and-day difference in the depth of flavour, and... just don't. Buy a bottle of fish sauce. And also, while we're at it, don't think about using peeled shrimps either. The shell will give a ton of flavour to the frying oil, which is then going to give a ton of flavour to the garlics, and if your shrimps have semi-soft shells, they can even turn into crispy deliciousness.",
      "TO MAKE THE FRIED GARLICS: Pulse the peeled garlic cloves in a food-processor until finely minced. On the side, set up a large fine sieve resting over a large bowl.\r\n\r\nWarm up (not hot) 1 cup of vegetable oil in a wok/pot over medium-high heat. Drop a piece of garlic into the oil, and if it slowly bubbles up and floats to the surface, the oil's ready (remove the tester-garlic or it'll burn). Lower the heat down to medium, then add all the garlic at once. Keep stirring and keep stirring with a wooden spoon (don't stop stirring or the garlics close to the edge of the wok/pot will brown faster) until the garlics start to turn into pale-golden (think lightly roasted peanuts). Turn off the heat completely at this point, and keep stirring with the residual heat. Once the garlics turn into light-golden, immediately drain them through the fine sieve. You want to remove the garlics from heat just a little earlier because they will continue to darken into medium-golden once drained. Any darker than a medium golden-brown will taste bitter. You should have about 1 1/2 cup of fried garlic.",
      "The fried garlic could stick to each other after cooking, so break them up with a fork and divide in half. Freeze half in an air-tight bag for next use. Reserve the garlic oil.",
      "TO MAKE THE TYPHOON-SHELTER GARLIC SHRIMPS: Mix 1/2 of the fried garlic with 3/4 tsp of ground white pepper, 1/4 tsp of ground black pepper and the zest of 1/2 a lime. Set aside. Have all the dried chili, scallion, Asian celery and fish sauce ready on the side.",
      "Use a scissor to cut the shrimp-shells open along the back, all the way to the tails. Devein the shrimps, then score the meats open with a small knife without cutting through (see picture). Evenly mix together 2 tbsp of all-purpose flour and 2 tbsp of fine cornmeals, season with a small pinch of salt. Light coat the shell of the shrimps in the flour-mixture, then dust off any excess flour. Set aside.",
      "Heat up 3 tbsp of the reserved garlic oil in a wok/deep skillet on high heat until smoking. Lay the shrimps flat on one side in the wok/skillet to fry, then don't move them. Once the first side is blistered and crispy, add the diced dried chili and turn them over to fry the other sides. It's important not to stir them or move them around too much, otherwise they won't fry properly. Once both sides are crispy, add the scallions, celery and 1/2 tsp of fish sauce, stir gently and cook until the scallions have just wilted. Now turn off the heat completely, and add the fried garlic-mixture, and the remaining 1/2 tsp of fish sauce. The residual heat is enough to do the rest of the job, but won't burn the garlics. Fold gently again to have everything combined.",
      "Serve immediately, meaning you suck the heads, chew on their crispy legs, down the meats and spoon the garlics over rice or savoury congee. It is excellent on both."

When combined, turn the dough onto a work surface (I like to use a large silicone mat for easy clean up) and knead for several minutes until the dough is satisfyingly elastic. Transfer the dough to a lightly oiled bowl, or if using, loosely wrap the dough in the silicone mat and transfer it right back into the dough mixing bowl. Allow the dough to rise until it has doubled in bulk for a coupe of hours. You can also make this dough in the morning and let it rise in the refrigerator during the day and it will be ready at dinnertime.",

In the bowl of a food processor, pulse the walnuts into a coarse chop. Squeeze the kale dry and add to the food processor. Blend until well chopped. Add 2 Tbsp olive oil, the ricotta, and a generous pinch of salt. Process until you have a fairly smooth, bright green paste. Reserve.",

Flip the pieces and drizzle the balsamic vinegar over them, as well as a pinch of salt and grind of black pepper. Cook briefly to let the vinegar cook down into a syrup, and then remove the slices to a plate, pouring over any remaining vinegar.",
      "Preheat the oven to 475 degrees and insert a pizza stone if you wish. Roll out the pizza dough into a thin sheet, approximately 15 inches in diameter (you can spare a quarter of the dough for a small auxiliary pizza is you like). Sprinkle a pizza peel or baking sheet with polenta and place the dough on top. Spread the kale pesto in a thin layer over the dough. Layer the glazed pears and onions over the kale pesto. Crumble the gorgonzola and sprinkle on top. If using a pizza stone, carefully slide the pizza from the peel onto the stone. Bake the pizza for about 16 minutes until the crust sounds hard when tapped and the ricotta in the kale pesto has cooked through and lightened in color. Serve at once."

Once you have made several of these, make them and cover them so that they do not dry out. Take salted boiling water , and boil these dumplings for about 3 - 4 minutes till they are al dente.

Immediately add in the dumplings. Again mix it well.

      "First, prepare the olives. Arm yourself with a small knife. (A regular table or butter knife is easiest to work with; you may prefer a sharp knife, but they can cut too easily through the olive, resulting in breakage). Begin trimming around the pit of the olive, much like you would peel the skin off an apple, to create a \"spiral\" of olive meat and to remove the pit. Discard the pit, and place the olive in a bowl with the water and salt. Continue with the rest of the olives. (You may want helpers.)",
      "For the filling, over medium heat, melt the butter with the olive oil in a skillet, and saute the carrot, onion, and celery for about 5 minutes. Add all the pork, beef, and chicken, and cook, stirring gently, for about 5 minutes. Then, add the white wine, nutmeg, salt, and pepper, and continue cooking, stirring gently, for a further 10 minutes or until the liquid is reduced slightly. Transfer the mixture to a food processor and blend, until smooth and fine like a paste.",
      "To the meat mixture, add the egg yolk and Parmesan cheese, and blend again. You should have a rather solid, compact filling that you can easily shape into a ball. If it is a bit soft or sticky, place in the refrigerator to chill. This filling can also be made a day or two ahead and stored in the refrigerator in an airtight container until needed.",
      "To fill the olives, take a 1/2-teaspoon sized portion of the filling, roll it into an oval shape, and wrap an olive around it (like the filling is taking the place of the pit). Press gently to close the olive perfectly over the filling. Repeat with the rest of the olives. When all the olives are ready, they can be refrigerated at this point and kept until you need to fry them.",
      "In a small bowl, beat the egg with a pinch of salt. Put the flour and the breadcrumbs in 2 other, separate small bowls.",
      "Fill a small saucepan with enough olive oil for the olives will float in. Bring the oil to medium heat.",
      "Double-coat the olives by first dipping them in flour, then egg, then breadcrumbs, then back into the egg and back into the breadcrumbs. Drop them carefully into the hot oil and fry for about 1 minute, turning them gently to brown evenly. Fry in small batches (do not overcrowd the pan otherwise the temperature will drop significantly), and drain on paper towels. Serve immediately. Note: If the olives are browning too quickly, it means the oil is too hot and you will end up with a soft filling rather than a fully cooked one (the egg will be uncooked but the meat of course is already cooked). Turn the heat down a notch and try again, cooking them slower."

      "June 22nd, 2015\r\nBok Choy Chopped Salad\r\nShare on FacebookTweet about this on TwitterShare on LinkedInPin on Pinterest\r\nBok Choy Chopped Salad\r\nChopped salad is exactly what it sounds like! All the ingredients are chopped into bite size, somewhat uniform pieces with a flavorful dressing and served. Usually chopped salad is a little more \"American\" in flavor with vinaigrette, lettuce, tomato, bacon, small pasta tubes, etc. This version is Asian influenced (we're not the first to do this, a little research revealed), with bok choy as the center of the salad. If you watched Anton & Emma cover bok choy, you'll remember it can be treated as 2 vegetables - the stalk and the leaves. Here the stalk is cubed, and the leaves shredded with carrots, broccoli, and spring onion tops for a gluten free version. There is so much you can do with this salad, try any crunchy vegetable like radish, kohlrabi, cucumber. Fresh herbs like mint, cilantro, or Thai basil would be a great addition. We added diced local chicken, but if you prefer try smoked tofu or tempeh.\r\nBok Choy Chopped salad\r\nBok Choy Chopped Salad\r\nEverything is tossed with a creamy miso dressing, making it cookout and picnic friendly! I used mayo for a little extra creaminess, but you could omit it or use a mayonnaise substitute for a vegan version. Pureeing it with an immersion blender gave it a super creamy consistency. The tall measuring cup ours came with is perfect for blending a quick dressing or dip. One of the smartest things we did this year was get a big bag of ginger from Good Life Farm and freeze it. Make sure you order some from CSA+ this fall!\r\nBok Choy Chopped Salad\r\nMiso is an ingredient we use fairly often in the farm kitchen, it adds a lot flavor, has health benefits, and a little goes a long way! The price tag on a tub may seem a little high, but it will last months. If you cook along with us during the CSA season it's a good investment. And I just learned you can also order NY state produced miso from CSA+! Fold in the cashews just before serving, and serve with an Asian Chili sauce on the side, like Sriracha.\r\nbokchoychop2\r\nBok Choy Chopped Salad\r\n1 head of bok choy\r\n2 - 3 carrots\r\n1/2 lb broccoli\r\n1 cup sliced spring onion or scallion tops (just the green part)\r\n1 1/2 cups diced chicken or smoked tofu\r\n3/4 cups raw cashews\r\nDressing:\r\n3 tablespoons miso paste (white mellow)\r\n2 tablespoons mayonnaise\r\n1/2 cup neutral oil like canola/coconut blend\r\n2 tablespoons grated ginger\r\n1 tablespoon rice vinegar\r\n1 tablespoon maple syrup\r\nChop the vegetables. Slice off the bottom of the bok choy, then rinse in between the stalks to remove all of the dirt. Dry the stalks with a towel, and slice the head of bok choy where the stalks meet the leaves.

      "In a roasting-type pan as close as possible to the size of the filo (the Food52 test kitchen used an 8 x 8-inch square), begin building the baklava. Layer 6 to 8 sheets of filo in the bottom of the pan, brushing each sheet lightly with butter before adding the next. I use a silicone brush to do this. (Many Greek cooks I've watched, including my mother-the aforementioned Mrs. Z-simply drizzle the butter from a teaspoon. So don't worry if you don't have a pastry brush.)",
      "Sprinkle the nut mixture in a thin layer over the filo dough. Cover with 3 to 4 more sheets, each brushed lightly with butter. Repeat until nut mixture is completely used up. Cover with 6 to 8 fila, brushing each layer lightly with butter. (No one has claimed this is a diet dessert!)",
      "Refrigerate the uncooked baklava for an hour or two until the butter solidifies. Then, cut with a sharp knife (before baking!) into small squares or diamond shapes. If you want the traditional diamond shapes, start with a corner-to-corner diagonal cut. Stick a whole clove into the center of each piece.",
      "Bake at 350\u00b0 F for no longer than one hour. If the baklava dries out, it is ruined. It should get very lightly golden brown.",
      "As soon as you take it out of the oven, pour the room temperature syrup evenly over the hot pastry. The rule is hot pastry, cool syrup -- or you'll get a soggy dessert! Start with about half of the syrup, letting the pastry absorb it-you may not use it all. I like to serve baklava on a platter, each piece nestled in a pretty paper or foil cupcake cup."

    "title": "cornish hens with potatoes, porcinis and tarragon en papillote",
    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "Prep. step: put porcinis in 2 cups of water to soak (they require at least an hour of soaking prior to beginning this recipe). Preheat the oven to 450 degrees. Put a little wire rack in a roasting pan for the birds to rest on. Peel the garlic cloves - all 20 or so of them!",
      "Readying the birds: wash them in cold water and pat dry with paper towel. Season them outside and in with a lot of salt and pepper. Rub them all over with a lot of butter. Put half a tangerine, a few sprigs of tarragon, and a peeled and smashed clove of garlic or two in the cavity of each bird. You don't want the cavities stuffed though, there should be some air in there - we're trying to get an aromatic tangerine/tarragon/garlic steam bath type thing happening in the bird's cavity - we're not trying to slow the cooking process by stuffing it full. Truss the birds tightly. Put them on the wire rack/roasting pan combo, breasts down. Arrange garlic cloves around the birds, ideally a few under the rack underneath them as well.",
      "Cooking the birds: Put the birds in the oven at 450 for 30 minutes. Remove from the oven, flip breasts up, lower oven to 350. Pour the white wine and the chicken stock over the birds and brush them with a little more butter. Put them back in the 350 oven (NOTE: this is when you put your packet of potatoes, tarragon, garlic and porcinis in the oven, described below, if you want it all done together), probably for only another 20-30 minutes but you simply have to keep checking with a meat thermometer, aiming for about 160-165 in the fattest part of the bird you can fine (it will come up another 5 degrees when you take them out of the oven and let them rest). Baste at least every 10 minutes.",
      "The gravy: Right after you first put the birds in the oven at 450, drain the porcinis and reserve the water in which they have been soaking. You use the porcinis themselves in the second part of the recipe, below, but for the gravy you're going to reduce the soaking liquid. To do this, put it in a sauce pan, squeeze in the juice of the other tangerine, and just boil it all down for about 30 minutes - until has reduced by about half, but not until it is really as thick as you ultimately want it. When the birds are finished, splash a little cold white wine (or chicken stock, or water) into the pan they've been in and scrape like mad (deglaze it, in other words). Skim some of the grease off, then pour the remaining drippings and the cloves of garlic in with the reduced porcini liquid. Reduced the combined porcini liquid and pan drippings, whisking it all the while, for about 6 minutes at a furious boil. It should be thick enough to coat a spoon at that point. Strain and season it. Meanwhile your birds have been resting and your little packets of potatoes have been roasting, so once you're done with the gravy you can serve.",
      "Potato and garlic pre-boil: Before you begin prep. of the birds, when you're just putting the oven on to preheat (in Step 1, above), put the potatoes in a pot with the garlic cloves and just barely cover in cold water. Put this on the stove and bring it to a boil, then boil for 10 minutes (no more - this is just a pre-cooking step). Drain the potatoes and slice them into rounds about as thick as your pinky. Slice the garlic cloves in half.",
      "Making the packets: \r\n\r\n(N.B. If you're fancy, you will know how to make little packets of vegetables and what have you out of lovely honest parchment paper tightly sealed around the edges already. You will probably even know that you have to brush the parchment with water before you put the little packets into the oven, so that they won't scorch, since they're going to be in there for 30 minutes or more. I'm not even going to talk to you since you already know everything. HOWEVER, if you don't already know what en papillote means and/or you're not OCD-level nostalgic, the recipe works just as well with aluminum foil, so that's how I'm going to explain it).\r\n\r\nDraw out a sheet of aluminum foil as long as your arm (so it's about twice as long as it is wide) and spread it shiny side up on the counter. Smear it with butter, but leaving an inch or two band un-smeared all around the edge. Make a pile 1 or 2 levels deep of potato rounds on one side (long-ways), then pile on tarragon leaves, then the garlic cloves, the porcini mushrooms, and a couple hunks of butter, then more tarragon leaves, then another layer or 2 of potato rounds. Fold over the aluminum on top of this packet and crimp it tightly around the edges, so you have a little, sealed, square packet of potato, tarragon, garlic, porcini and butter.",
      "Cooking and serving the packets: Throw the packets in the oven with the hens when they are put BACK into the oven at 350. They need a minimum of 30 minutes cooking time, but it's pretty hard to overcook them, so don't worry about it - just take them out when you're done with the birds and the gravy, they'll be fine. I like to put them on a platter and open them table side by slitting them down the middle with a sharp knife, as this allows the steam out, which is very fragrant."

Lay down parchment paper for easy removal. I recommend a depth size of 1.5\"-2\" (Inches) for the foam itself.",

      "Bring mixture to 300 degrees Fahrenheit using a candy thermometer. You can purchase one of these at Target like I did for school. A generic single prong meat thermometer usually doesn't surpass 220 degrees. A key technique in this process is to resist the urge to stir it. At the very beginning when it is starting to heat up it's ok to dissolve the dry sugar into the syrup. But once it starts to take off, stirring when sugar becomes unstable with heat will cause it to crystalize and form structures. Once one forms it spreads quickly the way nitrogen does when instantly freezing a liquid and forms a network. Creating a dense product.",

I stuck mine in the freezer (which is where I also stored them) for the best results. Heat, even room temperature is too warm. \r\n Start preparing your dipping chocolate while it's setting. I put the chips in a bowl and microwaved it at 30 second intervals and stirred each time. Careful not to over heat the chocolate. And stop microwaving before all the chips melt, the carry over heat should melt the rest creating an optimal dipping temperature. If you pull your bowl out and the chips are completely melted and it is liquid than you will need to let it cool.",

    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "Creating the Dough\r\n\r\nSpending time kneading the dough will pay off in the success of these flatbreads. The basic principle behind kneading is in folding the dough onto itself and pressing down, while making sure to be adding plenty of flour to prevent the dough from becoming unworkably sticky. Use the heel of your hand to really dig into the dough, kneading it in half from either side. Spend about 5-10 minutes kneading. Allow dough to rest for 10-15 minutes.",
      "Forming the Flatbreads\r\n\r\nThis skill is definitely one that comes with time, but we can give you some key tips to get you up the learning curve more quickly. Once the dough has risen, punch it down to allow the accumulated gas to escape. Divide the dough and create balls. Then using your thumb, pinch the dough against the heels of your hands. Once the dough has flattened, use your thumb and index finger to further spread out the dough, starting from the inside and working your way to the outside edges.",
      "Getting to Golden Brown & Fluffy\r\n\r\nAdd a bit of oil to your cast iron pan or grill and turn to medium hot heat. The key here is to make sure your pan is hot enough so the bread turns to a light golden hue and puffs up, about 2-3 minutes per side.",
      "Adding Sumac Spice & Herbs\r\n\r\nWe recommend incorporating half of the sumac spice and herbs into the dough before kneading. Use the second half to sprinkle on top of your finished flatbreads; brush with olive oil then sprinkle and serve. Or, add your spices to a small bowl of olive oil for dipping the flatbreads.",
      "Create & knead the dough:\r\n\r\n1. Mix flour, baking powder, salt, and 1/2 of RawSpiceBar's sumac spice & herbs together.\r\n2. Slowly pour in the olive oil, mixing while pouring. Add the warm water and mix again until the dough comes together into a ball.\r\n3. Knead dough continuously for 5-10 minutes. Add flour to coat as you go along and continuously fold the dough in half from either side; the dough will be firm and this is normal.\r\n4. Once kneaded, allow to rest for 10-15 minutes",
      "Form the flatbreads:\r\n\r\n1. Transfer the risen dough onto a floured surface. Punch to allow accumulated air to escape.\r\n2. Divide the dough into 10 pieces, forming each into a ball.\r\n3. Using the heels of your hands, flatten the balls from either side. Use your thumb and index finger to fully flatten and stretch the dough into a 6\" diameter.",
      "Golden brown:\r\n\r\n1. Turn the grill or cast iron pan, if you have one, to medium high heat. Brush with oil.\r\n2. Add the flatbreads a few at a time, allowing space between each. Leave for 2-3 minutes until golden brown and slightly puffy on either side."

While water is boiling, acquaint olive oil, garlic, anchovies, and hot peppers over a very low flame in a vessel with good heat retention, and which is large enough to comfortably hold all the ingredients, such as a dutch oven. You're not looking to brown anything; what you want instead is for the anchovies to slowly dissolve into the oil and for the garlic and peppers to get soft and melty. Once you have reached this melty state, stir in the tomato paste and cook about a minute, then stir in the lemon juice and continue cooking over very low heat, a couple minutes more. (Be judicious at this stage--not all lemons are created equal in terms of size or juiciness. You may not need all the juice. Taste and adjust the amount according to your palate. Essentially you are making a warm vinaigrette, so be mindful of the oil-to-acid ratio.)",

At the same time you add the cauliflower to the water, add the contents of the food processor and the drained stewed tomatoes to the pan mixture and gently heat through. Drain cauliflower and potatoes and immediately add to the dutch oven along with the chick peas and the remaining 2 tbsp capers, and gently stir to coat everything in the sauce. Bring just to a simmer, then cover and remove from heat. Let stand at least a half hour for everything to infuse, although the longer it sits, the better it gets. Can be served hot, cold, or room-temperature. This is particularly good tossed with orzo and some of its cooking water."

Drain and dry the asparagus spears, then cut thinly (1/4-inch) on the bias. Arrange the asparagus on a platter (or individual plates). Sprinkle the garlic over the asparagus. Drizzle some oil over the asparagus -- it's ok if it pools a little, especially if it's good oil. Using a vegetable peeler, scrape away about 1 inch of the horseradish skin from the end of the root; give it a rinse. Grate the white root over the asparagus -- about 2 teaspoons of horseradish. Season with more salt, if needed, and serve with lemon wedges."

Bring to a gentle boil again and boil rice for 5 to 7 minutes, stirring occasionally & gently. Drain in a colander. Pour 2 to 3 cups of tepid water over the rice in the colander. Drain again.",

Then, one spatula of rice at a time, arrange rice in the pot by first covering the bottom of the pot, using a spatula to spread it, then layering the rest of the rice to taper on top in the form of a quasi pyramid or dome. Make several wells in this rice dome with the handle of a wooden spoon. Cover and cook over medium heat until rice steams - usually around 20 minutes. (Keep a watchful eye.",

(One test for when the rice is properly done is to moisten finger tip and touch the pot, and if you hear a \"pszzst\" sound, the rice is ready.) When done, turn off heat and let rice rest undisturbed in the pot for 5 minutes. Then, wet a kitchen towel with cold water and place pot on top of the towel. (The pot should make a fizzing \"pszzst\" sound again. That'd be a good sign.)",
      "At some point before rice is done, prepare the carrots and barberries. First heat olive oil (plus an optional dab of butter) in a large skillet. Add carrots and saute over medium heat until pliant - usually around 5 minutes. Season carrots with cumin, coriander, cinnamon, and a tiny pinch of saffron. Add sugar as well. Stir to mix, lower heat, place lid ajar on top of pan to capture steam, and cook for another 5 minutes. (This allows sugar to liquify and carrots to really soak up the sugar.) Set aside. Wipe skillet with a paper towel, heat more olive oil (with yet another optional touch of butter) till very hot; reduce heat and saute barberries with 1 tablespoon sugar on low flame, stirring frequently, for no longer than a minute. Set this aside as well.",
      "Once rice is ready to be served, place 2 spatulas of rice in a small dish and sprinkle with saffron water, using a fork to fluff the rice grains and evenly coloring it with saffron water. This saffron-colored rice will be used to top rice as a decorative dome. Set this aside for now.",
      "Taking one spatula full of rice at a time, arrange a layer of rice topped with a good sprinkling of carrots and barberries. Then add another layer of rice and top it again with carrots and barberries. Repeat till you've used all the rice but once you get to the \"tah digh\", the crunchy crust at the bottom of the pot that is, gently detach that in as intact a shape as you possibly can and serve in a separate platter. Finish off the rice platter by topping it with the saffron-colored rice you'd set aside earlier, and using your hands or a spatula mound the rice back to the shape of a dome. Garnish rice with remaining barberries and carrots, and the slivered pistachio and almonds. (Optional: To make this dish more scrumptious and moist, you can melt 2 tablespoon of butter and pour evenly over the serving platter at this point.)\r\n\r\nServe hot.

Now use the tomatoes as per the recipe above.\r\n\r\nDo not use the store bought white bread which is pre-sliced and comes in a bag. To test the bread, soak stale bread for 10 minutes in water and then squeeze the water out. If the bread can be shredded easily and flakes apart it is the right kind of bread. If it turns into dough balls, then it is not."

Immediately temper the eggs by adding a little bit of the cream/yogurt mixture and whisking them. Then add the egg mixture back to the sauce pan with the rest of the cream and yogurt. Place over low heat and stir continuously until it starts to thicken. It should look like thin pancake batter. Remove from the heat and stir in a pinch nutmeg.\r\n Pour over the top of the casserole making sure it is spread evenly.\r\n Bake in a preheated 350 degree oven for 45 minutes to 1 hour or until bubbly, golden brown and delicious."

You can make a wonderful soup the next day (or several days hence) using this as a base. Here's how:\r\nRemove the herbs to a small bowl, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate. Pour the wine/olive oil stock into a storage container, cover tightly and refrigerate overnight. When you are ready to make the soup, remove most of the oil that has risen to the top. Also overnight, soak 1 pound of small white beans in enough cold water to cover by 2 inches. The next day, drain the beans and put them back in the pot with enough water to cover by 2 inches, 6 black peppercorns and 1 bay leaf. Bring the beans to a boil and simmer for about 1 hour, until the beans are not quite tender. Drain the beans and reserve the water.",
      "Return the beans to the pot and now add the reserved wine/olive oil stock from the chicken to the beans. Also add the reserved herbs from last night's pot, and at least five of the following:\r\n1/2 pound lima beans or fava beans, shelled and peeled;\r\n6 potatoes, scrubbed and cut into 3/4-inch chunks;\r\n1/2 pound green beans, ends trimmed;\r\n5 carrots, peeled and cut into 3/4-inch chunks;\r\n5 red onions, peeled and thickly sliced;\r\n5 zucchini, cut into 3/4-inch chunks;\r\n3 white turnips, cut into 3/4-inch chunks;\r\n2 leeks, well washed, dried and sliced.",
      "Add 1 teaspoon sea salt and stir the mixture. Bring the soup to a boil and simmer for 40 to 50 minutes more. Some tubular pasta added during the last 15 minutes of cooking will add substance to this second one-dish meal. Serve the soup in large bowls with freshly grated Parmesan cheese on top and crusty bread on the side."

To grill: Peel eggplant, chop into cubes, salt, let sit 10 minutes, pat dry before brushing with oil and grilling until there are dark grill marks on each side and the eggplant is tender."
