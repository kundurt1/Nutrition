Set the strainer over a large bowl, ideally one from which you'll be able to easily pour afterward. Pour the vodka mixture through the strainer and allow the fruit to sit, seeping liquid, for a good hour or so, stirring a bit and pressing if need be to make the liquid go through.",

Fine chop the Cilantro and Parsley, squeezing out the extra moisture of the Parsley in a rag or paper towel. Mix all the ingredients in the bowl together.

Follow the directions on the box. When the rice is done add 1/2 the jar of Ragu Double Cheese sauce and stir. Place rice evenly in a large rectangle baking pan. Lay the chicken across the top in a row. It is ok if you need to over lap a little. Then pour the remainder of the cheese sauce of the chicken covering it completely. Top with shredded cheese then place in oven on broil. If you have an oven light you will want to keep it on or stand next to oven to check. This process takes no more than 5 minutes. The idea is to brown the cheese on top. when finished remove and let stand for 10 minutes and serve."

While the milk is heating, in a small bowl, stir together the sugar, flour, and salt. (Mixing the flour with the sugar will prevent the flour from clumping when you add it to the egg yolks.)

When all of the milk has been incorporated, return the contents of the bowl to the saucepan and place over medium heat. Whisk continuously and vigorously for about 3 minutes, or until the mixture thickens and comes to a boil. At first, the mixture will be very frothy and liquid; as it cooks longer, it will slowly start to thicken until the frothy bubbles disappear and it becomes more viscous. Once it thickens, stop whisking every few seconds to see if the mixture has come to a boil. If it has not, keep whisking vigorously. As soon as you see it bubbling, immediately go back to whisking for just 10 seconds, and then remove the pan from the heat. Boiling the mixture will thicken it and cook out the flour taste, but if you let it boil for longer than 10 seconds, the mixture can become grainy.",

After the eggs are done, add the vanilla. Next, stir into the mixture the flour and salt and mix well enough to not see the flour anymore, but to have it mixed into the chocolate. At this time, you can add the pecans or walnuts and pour into buttered and cocoa dusted 9x13 inch pan. Bake in a 350 degree oven for approximately 45 to 50 minutes. Do not over bake. Brownies should be set in the middle but still soft. Do not cut until brownies are room temperature if you want pretty nice cuts. If you can't wait, it's okay! Everyone knows brownies look crumbly!

      "The following day: Rinse off seasonings, blot very dry, and wrap in pairs in boilable pouches, then use a FoodSaver or professional vacuum packing device to seal airtight. Cover one stovetop burner with a Simmer Mat or heat diffuser. Place the sealed pouches in a deep flameproof ceramic or cast-iron casserole and cover with hot water. Be sure the pouches are completely submerged; if necessary, weight them down. Place the casserole over the mat or heat diffuser set over medium-low heat. Cover the casserole and heat to 180\u00b0F (use an instant-read thermometer), then reduce heat to low and allow to simmer at a constant 180\u00b0F temperature for at least 8 hours for Moulard, 9 for Muscovy, or 5 to 6 hours for Pekin. (If you have an electric oven, alternatively, you can place the pouches in very hot water in a casserole and cook at 180\u00b0F overnight. (Because of the constant water temperature, the flesh won't cook beyond its stage of \"doneness.\")",
      "The duck is ready when the flesh feels very tender, begins to separate from the bone, and the joint between leg and thigh cracks easily. When you remove the pouches from the casserole, immediately set the pouches in a bowl of ice water to chill until completely cold, about 30 minutes. The fat should congeal. Refrigerate until ready to use, within one week (see Cooks' Notes below).",
      "When ready to serve: Place the pouches under warm running water until you can easily break the chunks of the fat away from the meat. Open each pouch and separate the fat and jelly-like juices from the flesh. Set the fat aside for some other purpose; use juices for sauces or add to the beans. If using for cassoulet, bone the legs and break the meat into large chunks. Brown the skin to a crisp in a skillet; season the flesh side with pepper. Add the meat chunks and skin to the cassoulet"
