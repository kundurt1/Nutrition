Put the regular beaters in the mixer and add the flour mix to the water mix. Beat in slowly, then beat on medium for about 5 minutes, to develop the dough. Switch to the dough hooks, and gradually add 2 cups of the rye flour. The dough should be thick and heavy, but not thick enough to knead. Add a little more rye flour if it's too wet. Spoon into a greased loaf pan, put a little butter on your hands, and pat it down lightly to get into it the corners. Bake at 400 degrees for 40 to 50 minutes. Cool completely before slicing.",

      "Mix until the consistency is some what even. Then continue to slowly add flour 1/2 Cup at a time until the dough quits sticking to the sides of the bowl. It should be tacky to the touch. The trick is to have enough consistency to stand up with the least amount of flour so the bread will be fluffy. It will most likely be 6 1/2 cups but in any case do not exceed 7 1/2 cups of wheat flour. You can trade one cup of wheat flour for one cup of all purpose white if you wish. Don't over mix or the bread will be tough.",

      "Drop the dough on a floured surface so you can work the dough and shape it. Shape it with your hands to make a nice ball getting enough flour on it so it isn't sticky. Divide the ball in half and do it again. Shape the loaves by turning the dough under it's self over and over. When the dough is shaped the sides and ends will be sealed and all you will see is a nice oblong shaped loaf with smooth sides and top. Drop the loaves in your bread pans and let them rise until almost doubled. Bake in a preheated oven at 350 for 36 minutes. If you forgot to preheat 41 minutes. (gas oven).",
      "When done turn the bread out of the pan to a rack to cool. You can eat it right away (a great time for real butter) don't wrap it until completely cooled. (Condensation will make it soggy) Put in tinfoil to store on the counter. If you put it in the refrigerator it will turn into a brick. Enjoy."

Combine 3/4 cup granulated sugar and 1/4 cup water in a saucepan; bring to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring to dissolve sugar. Boil, without stirring, until syrup turns a deep caramel colour. Let cool until bubbles subside; pour a thin layer onto custards and let harden."

Set bag on a large platter-so the wings are mostly single layered in the sauce- and place in the fridge. Marinate the wings several hours or overnight, (re-toss every couple hours if you can so the black color of the marinade gets on all surfaces of the wings). Preheat oven to 425. Remove wings from bag with tongs and place on a foil lined-(Pam) sprayed baking sheet with shallow sides (I used my jelly roll pan) Fan/stretch the wings open. (Discard sauce). Bake at 425 for 25-30 min or until done. Serve on a light colored platter for best visual effect. These wings look awesome dark black and the color does not stain your fingers after baking."
