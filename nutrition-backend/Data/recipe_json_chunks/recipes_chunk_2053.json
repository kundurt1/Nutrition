      "SPECIAL EQUIPMENT SUGGESTED: A no-stick frying pan for the diced vegetables; tweezers or pliers to remove bones; a lightly buttered baking dish that will just hold the fish comfortably (or an ovenproof baking and serving platter, or, lacking either, cut the fish in half crosswise, and reassemble it after cooking- the vegetables will mask the surgery); buttered wax paper to cover fish.",
      "THE AROMATIC VEGETABLES: Cook the diced vegetables slowly in the butter until quite tender but not browned- about 10 minutes.",
      "Season lightly with salt, pepper, and a big pinch of dried tarragon.",
      "PREPARING THE FISH: Go over the salmon carefully with your fingers to detect any little bones; pull them out with tweezers or pliers.",
