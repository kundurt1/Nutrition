      "Make the dough: Using a floured pastry cloth and rolling pin sleeve, or two sheets of lightly floured plastic wrap, roll the pastry 1/8 inch thick or less and large enough to cut a 13-inch circle. Use an expandable flan ring or a cardboard template and a sharp knife as a guide to cut out the circle. Transfer it to the pie pan and tuck the overhanging pastry under itself. If desired, reroll the scraps, chill, and cut out decorative designs such as leaves. (Bake them separately on a small baking sheet at 400\u00b0F for 6 to 10 minutes or until golden brown. Remove to a rack to cool.)",
      "Cut the border into a checkerboard design or use a fork or spoon to make a flat but decorative border. Do not make a high raised border or extend it over the sides of the pan, as it will not hold up baked so close to the heat source. Refrigerate, covered with plastic wrap, for at least 1 and up to 24 hours.",
      "Preheat the oven to 375\u00b0F at least 20 minutes before baking. Plan to bake directly on the floor of the oven, or set an oven shelf at the lowest level and place a baking stone or cookie sheet on it before preheating.",
      "Process the gingersnaps and pecans until finely ground. Sprinkle them over the bottom of the pie crust and, using your fingers and the back of a spoon, press them into the dough to coat the entire bottom, going about 1/2 inch up the sides.",
      "Make the pumpkin filling: In a small heavy saucepan, stir together the pumpkin, brown sugar, spices, and salt. Over medium heat, bring the mixture to a sputtering simmer, stirring constantly. Reduce the heat to low and cook, stirring constantly, for 3 to 5 minutes or until thick and shiny.",
      "Scrape the mixture into a food processor and process for 1 minute. With the motor on, add the milk and cream, processing until incorporated. Scrape the sides of the work bowl. Add the eggs one at a time, processing just to incorporate, about 5 seconds after each addition; add the vanilla along with the last egg.",
      "Pour the mixture into the pie shell and set it directly on the floor of the oven (or on the baking stone). Bake the pie for 50 to 60 minutes or just until a knife inserted between the sides and center comes out almost clean. The filling will have puffed and the surface dulled, except for the center. (The filling will shake like jelly when moved. This will happen before it has finished baking, so it cannot be used as a firm indication of doneness; conversely, if it does not have this jelly-like consistency, you can be sure that it is not baked adequately). If the crust appears to be darkening too much on the bottom, raise the pie to the next rack. After 30 minutes, protect the edges with a foil ring.",
      "Place the baked pie on a rack to cool. When cool, the surface will be flat. If you have made decorative designs, place them on it now."

      "In clean grease-free glass or metal bowl, beat whites until soft peaks form. Gently fold the chocolate mixture into the whites. Pour batter into cake pan, transfer pan to middle of preheated oven and bake for 30 to 45 minutes, depending on pan size and type of oven. Cake will be firm at edges, but will seem under-baked in center. Remove from oven and let cool completely in pan. Put cake in pan in the refrigerator, overnight if possible. Cake must be cold to successfully remove it from the pan.",
      "To remove cake from pan: Cut 2 cardboard circles the same size as the pan used. Put one circle on top of cake still in pan. Heat the bottom of the cake pan on top of the stove over high heat for approximately 20 seconds. Remove from heat and invert cake onto cardboard, gently tapping pan on table if necessary. Cake will fall out of pan. Put the other cardboard circle on bottom of cake and invert cake. Remove cardboard from cake top. Keep cake in refrigerator until ready to use.",
      "For the ganache: In the top of a double boiler or a heatproof bowl set over simmering water melt the chocolate, stirring, until smooth. In a small saucepan bring cream just to a boil. Remove pan from heat, add melted chocolate and stir until smooth. Transfer melted chocolate to a bowl and let cool completely at room temperature.",
      "To assemble the cake: Ice the top and sides of the cold cake with the ganache. If ganache becomes too cold to spread, soften it in a microwave oven or on top of stove for a few seconds and stir to blend. Use as much or as little of the icing as your taste desires. The extra can be stored as stated in the recipe. Put the iced cake on a serving platter. Refrigerate if desired.",
      "To decorate the cake: Cut 3 to 4 strips from a new (one-gallon size) freezer bag, each 10 1/2 inches long and approximately 5 inches wide. There should be enough strips to cover an 8- or 9-inch cake. Melt chocolate as described in above instructions. Spread the melted chocolate over the entire surface of one strip. While the chocolate is still wet, pick up the strip and place it with the chocolate side to the cake, aligning the bottom of the strip to the bottom of the cake. Allow the top to fold over the top of the cake - just like a piece of fabric. Refrigerate until the chocolate strip is cold (this should be about a minute or less). Remove cake from the refrigerator and peel",
      "Repeat the process with the next strip, and then the third strip. The cake will be \"wrapped\" in a free-form blanket of chocolate. Dust with confectioners' sugar before serving."

Drop spoonfuls of chocolate chip cookie mix onto an greased aluminum foil covered baking sheet. Now I know most recipes call for NOT greasing your baking sheet and not covering with aluminum foil. But I've learned the hard way that if I follow those directions, I end up with crispy burnt bottoms and my cookies never turn out great. Bake the cookies for 9-11 minutes and remove to cool. I found the 9 minute mark for my oven produced the best cookie. They were still slightly soft but definitely not crunchy.",
      "When it comes time to prep your cookie s'mores you can do it by the bonfire or in the oven. If you opt for the oven make sure you have aluminum foil to make little pouches. Essentially you're laying a cookie, piece of chocolate, marshmallow and cookie. Wrap it up in foil and place in the oven at 375 for about 10 minutes. This is just enough time for the chocolate and marshmallow to melt and get gooey. When you unwrap you may find that some of your cookies have started to break open which for me was the best part. You're left with big chunks of chocolate chip marshmallow sticky sweetness."
