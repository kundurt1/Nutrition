Gradually add 1 1/2 cups of the sugar and beat until light and fluffy, 4-5 minutes. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition; beat in the grated lemon and lime zest. Sift together the flour, salt and baking powder onto a sheet of wax paper. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the butter mixture in 4 to 5 additions, beating on low speed until just blended after each addition. Spoon into prepared pan and bake for 1 hour and 15 minutes, or until cake tester inserted into the center comes out clean and the edges of the cake begin to pull away from the sides of the pan. Leave in pan to cool on rack for 5 minutes. Meanwhile, in a small non aluminum sauce pan, combine the remaining 1/2 cup of sugar, the lemon juice and lime juice. Cook over moderate heat stirring until sugar dissolves, 1 to 2 minutes. Do not boil. Remove glaze from heat. Remove cake from pan and place on a rack. Place rack on wax paper, and while cake is still warm brush all over with the hot citrus glaze. Let cool completely. Wrap in plastic and then over wrap with aluminum foil. Let cake stand in a cool place for at least a day before slicing. The cake will improve overnight and will keep for up to a week if kept tightly wrapped."
