Lift the fish fillets from the marinade and arrange them on top of the onions, skinned side down. Top each fillet with an even coating of the crust mixture, gently patting it on with your fingertips. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, or just until the fish flakes apart slightly when nudged with your finger and the interior is no longer translucent. Turn the broiler to high and broil until the crust is golden brown. Remove from heat and let stand 5 minutes. Serve with mashed or roasted winter squash, or braised winter kale."

If you are using the dough on the same day, remember to preheat the oven to 190C/170C Fan/ 375F. Oil a tart pan using a baking brush thoroughly. Set aside. Roll the dough flat enough to cover the tart pan. Wrap the pastry around the rolling pin, center it over the pan and unwrap the pastry. Then try to fit the pastry into the side of the pan without stretching it too much. Use your fingers to press gently into the fluted side of the tart pan. Make sure that the pastry fits snugly where the bottom and side of the pan meet with no air pockets. Also, trim the overhanging dough and use it to \"patch up\" the dough shortfall area (if any). Lightly brush the surface with some oil and prick the bottom of the tart with a fork. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes or until the crust appears golden."

It should not be so thin that you can see through it when you pick it up, nor should it be quite as thick as a floppy disk for a computer. After you have rolled out the dough, you will need to cut it into little circles for each momo. The easiest way to do this is turn a small cup or glass upside down to cut out circles a little smaller than the palm of your hand. Then you are ready to add the filling. I will teach you the easiest momo shape-- the half-moon.",
      "",
      "You begin by holding the flat circular dough in your left hand and putting a tablespoon of filling in the middle of the dough. Then you have to fold your circle of dough in half, covering over the filling. Now press together the two edges of the half circle so that there is no open edge in your half circle, and the filling is completely enclosed in the dough. You will now have the basic half-moon shape, and you can make your momo pretty by pinching and folding along the curved edge of the half circle. Start at one tip of the half-moon, and fold over a very small piece of dough, pinching it down. Continue folding and pinching from the starting point, moving along the edge until you reach the other tip of the half-moon.",
      "",
      "As you are making your momo's, you will need to have a non-stick surface and a damp cloth or lid handy to keep the momo's you've made from drying out while you're finishing the others.",
      "",
      "Finally, you should boil water in a large steamer. Oil the steamer surface lightly so the momos won't stick to the metal, then place as many as you can without touching each other. Steam the momo's for 10 minutes, then serve them hot, with soy sauce or hot sauce of your choice to dip them in."

Generously brush the surface of the cake with simple syrup.",

      "). Measure out 1/2 cup (2.6 oz / 73 g) of buttercream and, using an offset spatula, spread it evenly on the bottom cake layer, being careful not to let it blop over the sides. As you spread the buttercream, let a small wall (about 1/4 inch high) form around the outer edge, creating a well for the lemon curd.",
      "Evenly distribute 1/4 cup (2.1 oz / 60 g) of the lemon curd in the well. Set another cake layer on top and brush with simple syrup; spread with buttercream, creating a well, and fill with lemon curd just as you did with the first layer. Repeat with the third layer. Top with the final cake layer.",
      "If necessary, warm the buttercream once again. Measure out 1 cup (5.2 oz / 146 g) of buttercream and use the offset spatula to apply it as a crumb coat, a thin coating covering all surfaces of the cake; a crumb coat will seal the exterior of the cake to help prevent crumbs from marring the final frosting. (It's important to measure out buttercream specifically for the crumb coat so that the unused buttercream remains crumb free.) Refrigerate the cake for 10 to 15 minutes to set the crumb coat.",
      "Reserve about 1/2 cup (2.6 oz / 73 g) of buttercream for the top of the cake. Using an offset spatula, apply a thick layer of the remaining buttercream to the sides of the chilled crumb-coated cake. At this point, it's not important that the cake look pretty-it's most important that the buttercream be evenly distributed around the sides. With the cake sitting squarely in the middle of the turntable and with the offset spatula held vertically against the frosting, begin spinning the turntable. Keep the cake moving steadily in one direction and apply light pressure with the spatula; the buttercream will begin to even out. I like to imagine the spatula as the needle that stays steady while the record (or cake) spins round and round on the turntable. My goal is to make the sides perfect before adding any Thiebaud personality. Make sure to watch the vertical line of the cake; I find it helpful to look at the right side of the cake at eye level while spinning the turntable. You can add more buttercream to any spots that seem thin and whittle down any thick spots with the spatula.",
      "Once the sides are perfectly vertical and smooth, create as much or as little texture as you want in the buttercream. I constantly refer back to",
      "as I try to capture the casual, slightly imperfect look of Thiebaud's cakes onto my neatly frosted sides. It's not easy! While spinning the cake on the turntable, I often hold my offset spatula vertically and gently wobble it back and forth, or I take a quick swipe at the cake with the spatula blade as the turntable spins.",
      "When the sides are to your liking, you'll find a ring of buttercream standing up above the surface of the cake. Lightly \"grab\" the excess buttercream in one area with the offset spatula and pull it toward the center of the cake, spreading it toward the center. Repeat until you have a nice, clean edge all around.",
      "If necessary, warm the reserved buttercream, and then mound it up on top of the cake in the center. Using a small offset spatula, start from the center and begin smoothing out the buttercream, inching it closer and closer to the edge of the cake. I work fairly slowly when doing this in order to get a nice, voluminous lip of buttercream where the sides and the top of the cake meet, re-creating the ring that appears around the top edge of Thiebaud's pink cake.",

Take cream off heat and whisk in rue. Put cream back on heat and continue whisking until thickened. Sprinkle cheese and spices to taste. Add sausage (drippings and all) back into cream mixture and heat through. Serve over warm biscuits immediately or let cool down and refrigerate (up to 1 week) until ready to use.

      "Use a fork, holding the tines parallel to your work surface, to break the yolks and stir the eggs in a circular motion. As you stir, you'll see flour from the walls of your well tumbling into the egg. Keep stirring, gradually incorporating the flour into the eggs and occasionally gathering the border of flour closer to the slowly expanding bright yellow center. After 4 minutes or so, you should have a very wet dough surrounded by flour. Now use your hands or a dough scraper to slowly incorporate the rest of the flour, folding and pressing until it's all incorporated.",
      "Cut the dough in half. Knead one piece at a time, keeping the other wrapped in plastic, by pressing firmly down and forward with your palm (one hand on top of the other for force), then folding the dough back onto itself, pushing down and forward again, and turning the dough and doing it all over. Keep at it until the dough is smooth like a baby's bum, 5 to 7 minutes. Kneading will prove more challenging as you work the gluten, so you might occasionally switch to the other piece of dough, wrapping the one you're not kneading in plastic and letting it relax a bit. Wrap each half in plastic wrap and let them rest for at least 20 minutes or up to 1 hour.",
      "Cut each piece of dough in half, rolling out one and keeping the other pieces you aren't working with wrapped in plastic wrap. (As you get more comfortable with the process, you might not need to halve them.)",
      "Work with one piece of dough at a time. Form the dough into a rough rectangle that's about 4 x 6 inches. Set the rollers to the widest setting and feed the dough through twice. (If the dough feels at all sticky or doesn't come cleanly from the machine, dust it with a little flour.) Set the rollers to their second widest setting and feed the dough through once. Continue in this manner until the dough has been through each setting once. This process works the gluten in the dough, giving the pasta a lovely texture. At this point, it's fine if the long sheet of dough looks ragged or uneven.",
      "Fold the sheet of pasta onto itself several times to form a rough rectangle (about 5 x 8 inches) and press firmly with your hands so the layers stick together. Set the rollers to the widest setting again. Feed the dough through once at each setting until you reach about halfway to the narrowest one. Then start feeding the dough through twice at each setting, continuing toward the narrowest one, until your dough is about 6 x 36 inches and about 1 millimeter thick. Cover the dough with a damp towel and repeat with the remaining dough.",
      "Cut the long sheets crosswise into smaller, shorter sections that are as long as you'd like your pasta to be. I like my tagliatelle to be 12 to 15 inches long. Dust each side with semolina, giving the dough a light rub, and stack the sheets neatly. Cut the stack lengthwise into 1/2-inch-wide slices. Gently toss the slices, separating them into individual noodles as you do.",
      "At this point the pasta is ready to cook, but I like to leave it on the counter or a tray for 30 minutes or so to dry out a bit. (The drier the pasta, the more time it'll take to cook and the more time you'll have to do any last-minute prep.) You can store it in a plastic storage container in the refrigerator for up to 2 days."

While the onion cooks, combine the horseradish and sour cream in a separate small bowl, stirring to blend together well. Cut the bread into eight 3/4\" thick slices, lay them out on a cookie sheet, and toast them under the broiler on high heat for approximately a minute, removing once to flip the slices, then toasting the other sides for another minute. Once the onions have been cooked through, remove them from the skillet and set them aside. In the same skillet, pan-fry each steak slice individually, approximately 15-20 seconds per side, until each slice is fully browned. Take care not to overcook the steak slices. Set the cooked slices aside. Once all the slices are cooked, divide them in four and pile them onto four of the toasted bread slices on the cookie sheet. Divide the onions and the cheese and top the steak slices with them. Leaving the sandwiches open faced, slide them back under the broiler on high for approximately one minute, until the cheese melts and browns slightly on top. Serve the sandwiches open-faced with the sour cream horseradish sauce on the side, so that the sauce can be spooned on to taste before the top slice of bread goes on. Serve the chilled tomatoes on the side in a separate bowl, so the juices from the tomatoes don't seep into the sandwich bread."

Reduce heat to medium-low and cook undisturbed for 5 to 7 minutes for soft-set yolks. (For hard-set yolks, cover the pan after 5 minutes and continue cooking until the yolks are cooked through, 4 to 6 minutes more.)",
      "5.To assemble, place an egg on top of each pair of tortillas and top with a generous 1/4 cup of the lettuce mixture."
