If you stop cooking too early and the jelly turns out to be too runny that is OK because re-boiling can fix that; the pectin manufacturer's instructions probably has tips on what to do. Over-cooked jelly is not very nice and there is very little you can do about it except learn."

      "Heat the pan to medium high heat and add the olive oil. Season the steak well on both sides with salt and pepper and bring to room temperature. Sear the steak on one side for 4-5 minutes until nice and brown (the time will depend of how thick the steak is) and then flip. I like to finish in a 425 degree oven for about 5-8 minutes until it reaches your desired internal temperature. NOTE: These times are based on on 1 1/2\" thick strip or fillet. Remove the steak once done and transfer to a plate and cover with foil to let rest.",
      "Onions -- As the steak finishes in the oven, cook the onions in a separate small sauce pan. Heat to medium high and then add the butter and onions. Season with salt and pepper and saute 5-8 minutes until the onions are lightly golden brown and tender. Finish by adding the thyme. Just reduce to low while the steaks finish and you make the sauce.",
      "Sauce -- After the steak is done and resting, return the pan to the stove on medium heat. Add in the garlic and cook just a minute, then add the white wine to deglaze the pan. Scrape up the drippings as well. Cook just a couple of minutes so it reduces slightly. It doesn't take long. Then remove the pan off the heat as you stir in the brandy and then return it. NEVER pour a flammable liquid like brandy directly over the heat. Return to medium heat and bring to a boil. Then remove from the heat and add in the mustard, butter and blackberry jam. Just whisk everything together. The heat of the pan and wine will warm up everything perfectly.",
      "Serve -- Plate the steak and top with a few of the onions. Then drizzle a little of the sauce on the top. If you go with a skirt steak or something similar you can slice up the steak on a batter and serve it the same way with the onions and sauce.",
      "As I said I love a green salad with blackberries, blue cheese and candied walnuts to bring all the flavors together and my parsnips and cauliflower puree for a nice twist to mashed potatoes. Make the potatoes (aka cauliflower) and the walnuts all ahead, so it is just matter of a quick reheat and the steak. A gorgeous dinner for friends one night."

    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "Place all of the ingredients into the bucket of your bread machine, reserving 1/3 cup of white chips or chunks for the topping. Program the machine for basic bread, light crust, and press Start. After about 10 minutes of kneading, examine the dough; it should be smooth and soft, not gnarly. Add additional water, if necessary; the bread will rise properly and have a beautiful, tender texture if it has the correct amount of liquid. Note: If the bread is coarse-textured and collapses, use slightly less liquid the next time.",
      "If you have a bread machine that seems to heat the dough a lot as it kneads, such as the Breadman, add half the chocolate at the beginning of the kneading cycle and half near the end, as otherwise it may all melt. Adding all of the chocolate at the beginning worked fine with the Zojirushi, which is a \"cooler kneader\" than Breadman.",
      "Chop or crush the reserved white chocolate. Just before the final rise cycle begins, brush the top of the loaf with water or beaten egg white, and sprinkle with the crushed white chocolate. (This step is optional, but if you like caramelized white chocolate, it really adds a nice touch.) Allow the machine to finish its cycle.",
      "Here's a helpful hint: Just before the final rise cycle begins, and before you brush the top with water or egg, lift the dough out of the machine, remove the paddles, and spritz the bucket with non-stick baking spray. The baked bread will release more easily from the pan, and only small holes will be left in the bottom, rather than the larger holes the paddles would have left.",
      "You could also form this dough into breakfast buns and glazed with vanilla frosting.",
      "To make buns, place all of the ingredients (except 1/3 cup of the white chocolate) into the bucket of your bread machine. Program the machine for dough or manual, and press Start. When the cycle is complete, turn the dough out onto a lightly floured or greased work surface. Divide the dough into 12 pieces, each weighing slightly more than 2 1/2 ounces. Shape the pieces into round balls, and place them on a lightly greased or parchment-lined baking sheet, leaving room between them for expansion. Cover and let rise for 30 to 45 minutes; the buns will be almost double in size, and be very soft looking. Gently brush the buns with water or beaten egg white, and sprinkle the reserved white chocolate over their tops. Bake the buns in a preheated 350\u00b0F oven for 18 to 20 minutes, until they're a light golden brown. Remove them from the oven, and cool them a bit on a wire rack. Spread while they're still warm with the following glaze, if desired.",
      "In a small saucepan set over low heat, or in the microwave, melt together the white chocolate, butter, honey, and milk or cream, stirring until smooth. Sift the sugar into the chocolate mixture, and stir; thin with a teaspoon or so of extra milk if necessary to make a smooth, spreadable glaze. Spread over the warm rolls, then allow them to cool for an hour or so, for the glaze to harden. Yield: 12 buns."

Wet the edges and place the larger piece on top. Pat around the edges to ensure the pieces of dough form a seal.",

Cover the cookie with your choice of icing. Ice on a cooling rack with waxed paper underneath to catch drippings. Allow to harden. If you feel creative, you can decorate the shape with coloured icing, candy decorations, etc."

Just add everything in a small sauce pan and set on the stove. And remember, if you use the pineapple juice from a can of pineapple rings (save those rings), you can bake those for a side dish as you bake the shrimp.",
      "Coatings -- #1) In a small pan or bowl, mix the corn starch, salt and pepper and set to the side. #2) Mix the egg whites, honey and pineapple juice (you may want to heat up the honey for a few seconds in the microwave so it is easier to mix in). Just set to the side. #3) Lastly, add the coconut, macadamia nuts, and cumin -- again, to a small bowl or pie plate and set to the side.",
      "NOTE: I chop my macadamia nuts in my small food processor so they are fine ground, remove to the bowl or plate. Now the coconut -- I add this to my food processor and pulse only 1-2 times. Coconut is moist, and you don't want to puree it, so go easy.",
      "Shrimp -- Make sure the shrimp are dry, then and dip in the corn starch mixture, this will allow the coating to stick well. Next, the egg white, and then in the nut and coconut mixture.",
      "Bake -- Heat your oven to 400 degrees. Either spray a baking sheet with a non-stick spray or I prefer to line the baking sheet with parchment paper. Add the shrimp lying on their sides and spray with a non stick spray, (this will make the coconut crust get golden brown). Bake 7-10 minutes on the middle shelf until golden brown and flip. Cook another 5-7 minutes and they are done. They will start to curl up and the coconut will be golden brown.",
      "Note: Remember those pineapple rings? Melt 2 tablespoons butter and 2 tablespoons brown sugar in a small cup in the micro for 10 seconds. Brush on the pineapple rings and put them right on the same baking sheet as the shrimp. They won't take quite as long, so just check them. A great side dish and easy.",
      "Sauce -- As the shrimp bakes, your sauce is ready to go. Just heat to medium to medium high, you want it to come to a light boil, and then reduce to medium low. The corn starch once heated will naturally thicken the sauce. If you want it a bit thinner, just add a bit more orange juice or pineapple juice, that is up to you how thick or thin you want it. Serve warm.",

Transfer to a medium bowl and toss 2 1/2 cups of reserved sauce until completely combined; season with salt. Transfer filling to an airtight container and chill until turkey is cold and firm, at least 3 hours.",

      "For the Masa and Assembly:",
      "Mix masa, schmaltz, stock and salt in a large bowl with your hands until well incorporated and mixture looks shiny and smooth, about 4 minutes. (Alternatively, you can also do this in a stand mixer) Masa will seem wet but should not stick to your hands. Slap the top of masa with the palm of your hand, immediately pulling your hand back. If masa doesn't stick and your hand looks shiny, the dough is ready. If masa sticks, add another 2 tablespoons schmaltz and knead until incorporated; repeat slap test. If masa still sticks to your hand, repeat process until you get there (another 2 tablespoons schmaltz should do it).",
      "Bring a large pot of water to boil over high heat and preheat oven to 350\u00b0. Set a rack inside a rimmed baking sheet and position it so that one of the long sides is facing you. Cover the sheet tray with two leaves, lengthwise from top to bottom, slightly overlapped, with ribs in the center. Repeat with another two leaves covering the first two. Brush banana leaves with schmaltz and top with half of the masa. Press into the banana leaves in an even layer covering most of the leaves, leaving a 1\" border around the rim of the baking sheet. Gently spread the filling, lengthwise down the center, making a 6\" wide strip across the masa.",
      "Using overhanging leaves to help you, fold the side closest to you over the filling, carefully separating the leaf from the masa so that it rests over the filling. Pull back the leaf completely so that it is resting on the sheet tray. Fold the second side over so that the masa and leaf completely covers the filling and slightly overlaps the other masa flap. Fold the first leaf over and tuck under the tamal on the other side. Tuck the leaves on the two ends under the tamal. Cover the tamal in wet, clean kitchen towels. Place baking sheet in oven and pour very hot water into pan until it just below the level of the rack and cover with heavy duty foil. Bake until set, 60-75 minutes. Let sit covered for 30 minutes. Carefully unwrap and slice and serve with reserved sauce and pickled red onions."

Cut in shortening using pastry blender (or pulling 2 table knives through ingredients in opposite directions), until mixture looks like fine crumbs. Stir in milk until dough leaves side of bowl (dough will be soft and sticky).",
      "Place dough on lightly floured surface. Knead lightly 10 times. Roll or pat 3/4 inch thick. Cut with floured 2 1/2 -inch round cutter. Place on ungreased cooked sheet about 1 inch apart for crusty sides, touching for soft sides (I prefer crusty sides). After cutting as many biscuits as possible, lightly press-don't knead- the scraps of dough together to make 1 to 2 more biscuits.",
      "Bake 10 to 12 min or until golden brown. Serve warm.",
      "Note: This recipe doubles very well. Every time that I make these, I always double this recipe. To double, simply double all the ingredients. Also, the key to high-rise, flaky biscuits is having really fresh baking powder and not overworking the dough. Even if your baking powder is not expired, the biscuits will not rise if the baking powder has clumps inside the container. Also, I cannot emphasize enough to just lightly knead the dough 10 times; over-kneading will produce a tough biscuit. When you pat the dough to 3/4 inch thickness, the baking powder will already be activating the dough to rise. Do not re-pat the dough down again because the air bubbles forming will make the biscuits flaky.",
      "Betty Crocker's Tips for Biscuits: Tip One: One secret to making flaky biscuits is thoroughly blending or \"cutting in\" the shortening and dry ingredients. A pastry blender, which breaks the shortening into little lumps works great for cutting inches If you don't have one, you can crisscross two table knives through the flour and shortening or use a wire whisk.",
      "Tip Two: Use a biscuit cutter dipped in flour to cut the dough, pushing the cutter straight down through the dough. If you twist as you cut, the biscuits will be uneven. Cut the biscuits as close together as possible. If you don't have a biscuit cutter, use the end of an open 6-ounce juice can or other narrow can or glass, or use cookie cutters for fun shapes. Dip in flour before cutting."

This method produced 2 cups of coconut milk. Can be made up to 2 days before recipe and refrigerated, covered. The milk will separate in the fridge, forming a creamy 'fat' layer on top, and a thinner 'liquid' layer underneath. Not to worry, the fat layer will melt into the curry along with the liquid and form a lovely milk.",
