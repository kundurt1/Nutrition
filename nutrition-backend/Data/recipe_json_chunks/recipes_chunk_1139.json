(If you use ground pepper you will not get much pepper flavor, and it will be incredibly hotter. You will need to adjust pepper to about 1 tsp).",

By the end of cooking it should have reduced to about 1/4 to 1/2 cup of liquid.",
      "Once internal temperature reads 145-150\u00b0F immediately remove the roast from the oven and cover the pan with foil for a minimum of 15 minutes before slicing. **Side Note: The key to a tender roast is to use a meat thermometer and follow up with the tenting method. This allows the internal temperature of the roast to raise another 10 degrees after it comes out of the oven so that the meat gets completely cooked to a safe temperature, and is so moist and juicy. I learned this from watching America's Test Kitchen and they are SO right on about that.",

    "title": "family reunion chicken and dumplings",
    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "Place the chicken in a large pot at least 7qt. I use my gumbo pot. This recipe makes exactly 5 quarts and you want a little room. Cover the chicken with 4 quarts of water. Add bay leaves, salt, pepper, poultry seasoning, one of the onions quartered, and 3 celery stalks cut into large pieces. These will cook to the point of mush and be discarded later. Put the lid on and boil on medium heat( on my electric stove it is #5) for exactly one hour. Occasionally check to make sure it is at a medium boil and move the chicken around in the pot.",
      "When the hour has passed turn off the heat, take off the lid and let it cool down for about 15 minutes. Then remove the chicken to a large bowl. Drain off any broth back into the pot. Cut the chicken down the center and open it up so it may cool. Set aside.",
      "Next I strain the broth. I like to have a nice clean broth free of bay leaves, bones, skin etc. If you notice any chicken skin stuck to the pot please remove it. Throw it all out including the mushy onion and celery .Pour your nice broth back into the pot. Chop your remaining onion and celery into nice, pretty small pieces. Add it to your broth, put the lid back on and boil on medium heat while you are making your dumplings.",
      "Now is a good time to clean up your mess. Once clean, you will need a nice floured surface about as long and wide as your rolling pin. If you don't have a rolling pin you can use a glass. The area should be about 15x15.",
      "In a large mixing bowl add your 5-cups of flour. Make a well in the middle and pour in the 2 cups of milk. Mix well with a fork until all of the flour is moistened and you can make it all stick together in a dough ball. It is better to have a little dry flour in the bowl than to have dough that is too wet. If you really think you need to add milk do it by spoonfuls. Plop the dough out onto your floured surface, roll it around so that the bottom of the dough gets floured and then flip it over and roll the top around in the flour. Use your rolling pin or glass to roll the dough out. If it sticks just sprinkle a little flour on the sticky spots. Roll it out to a 1/4 inch thickness which should cover about a 15x15 area. Push in any raggedy ends. Use a knife to cut the dough into about 1 1/2 inch strips to have nice big dumplings like mine (pictured) or smaller if you like.",
      "At this point take the lid off of the pot. The broth should be at a medium simmer--you need to see bubbles before adding your dumplings. Now cut each strip of dough into 1 inch squares. Throw each dumpling in the pot as you cut it. After each row stir the pot. Continue until you have cut all of the dumplings.( It is good for the dumplings to be coated with the extra flour, don't shake it off. This adds thickness to the broth.) Stir well making sure all of the dumplings are separate.Put the lid on and lower the heat. You want a low simmer.",
      "Now it is time to remove the chicken from the bone. Separate the breast meat into medium sized chunks.Everything else usually comes off in bite sized pieces. Please make sure you are free of bones, fat and skin. By the time you have all of the chicken removed it is time to add it to the pot.",
      "Remove the lid and add the chicken .Then add the cream of chicken soup, butter and parsley. Stir well. You may think your broth looks a little thin. Don't worry, it thickens upon standing. First you need to cook your chicken and dumplings a few more minutes now that everything is in the pot. I like to taste test about now and I usually add a little more salt, pepper, and poultry seasoning to suit my taste. Let this sit on the stove uncovered over very low heat for about 15 minutes. Then turn off the heat completely and let it sit for another 15 minutes. This is when it really thickens up for you. When it is cool enough and thick enough ---eat up!"

      "#1-I made this basic recipe by completely cooking the pork spareribs in a cast iron pan (and with a Mojo Sauce) but the meat came out a little on the tough side. However, it was moist and better the second day (leftovers) when heated up in a microwave; see Photo #1 Mojo Sauce. So I then made this recipe again in a Crock Pot and it came out much better and to my liking; see Photo #2 Mustard-Honey-Mayonnaise Topping.",
      "#2- A reply to the 2 Star Reviewer, \"Thank You for reviewing my recipe.\" I have now revised the wording a little to make this recipe clearer; Step #5- again use 1 piece of RAW garlic in a press (Not Roasted Garlic) and as an Alternative Option I had recommended using Harvey Bristol Cream which is a little sweeter then dry sherry, Step #11- It is common to place pieces (slivers) of RAW garlic in Puerto Rican Pernil Pork Roasts prior to cooking (that is where the idea came from) -- You are right the M-H-M might have masked the Mojo Garlic Flavor a little. To Quote a Zaar Chef \"There is NO Right and NO Wrong with cooking\" ... \"Cooking is about personal tastes and flavors.\"."

Alternatively, a 1-inch safe oven-safe skillet (either cast iron or stainless steel) can be used not only to cook the pineapple, but to bake th cake as well. If using a skillet instead of a cake pan, cool the juices directly in the skillet while making the batter; it's OK if the skillet is still warm when the batter is added. For a cake with a light, tender crumb, it is important to cream the butter and sugar well and to have the eggs at room temperature.",

      "FOR THE PINEAPPE TOPPING:",
      "combine pineapple, brown sugar, and orange zest in 10-inch skillet; cool over medium heat, stirring occasionally during first 5 minutes, until pineapple is translucent and has light brown hue, 15-18 minutes. Empty fruit and juices into mesh strainer or colander, set over medium bowl. Return juices to skillet, leaving pineapple in strainer, (you should have about 2 cups cooked fruit). Add orange juice to skillet and simmer juices over medium heat until thickened, beginning to darken, and mixture forms large bubbles, 6-8 minutes, adding any more juices released by fruit to skillet after 4 minutes. Off heat, whisk in butter and vanilla; pour caramel mixture into prepared cake pan. Set aside while preparing cake. (Pineapple will continue to release liquid as it sits: do not add this liquid to already-reduced juice mixture.).",

      "In bowl of standing mixer fitted with flat beater, cream butter and sugar at medium-high speed until light and fluffy. 3-4 minutes. Reduce speed to medium, add vanilla, and beat to combine; one at a time, add whole eggs, the egg white, beating well, and scraping down bowl after each addition. Reduce speed to low; add about 1/3 of the flour mixture and beat until incorporated. Add half of milk and beat until incorporated; repeat, adding half of remaining flour mixture and remaining milk, and finish with remaining flour. Give final stir with rubber spatula, scraping bottom and sides of bowl to ensure that batter is combined. Batter will be thick.",

      "Working quickly, distribute cooked pineapple in cake pan in even layer, gently pressing fruit into caramel. Using rubber spatula, drop mounds of batter over fruit, then spread batter over fruit and to sides of pan. Tap lightly against work surface to release any air bubbles. Bake until cake is golden brown and toothpick into center comes out clean, 45-50 minutes. Cool 10 minutes on wire rack, then place inverted serving platter over cake pan. Invert cake pan and platter together; life off cake pan. Cool to room temperature, about 2 hours. Then cut into pieces and serve."

Trust this recipe of mine, and I guarantee that you and your guests will have the best and juiciest turkey ever. The cook time and the amounts of ingredients will vary, depending on the size of the bird.",
      "Remove giblets from both cavities at both ends and set aside. Rinse the bird inside and out and pat dry with paper towel. Place a rack into a large roasting pan, and then place the turkey onto the rack with the breast and legs up.",
      "Place your hand between the skin and the flesh from the rear of the turkey and slide a palm full of the butter all the way up to the front of the bird, so that the entire bird has butter between the skin and the flesh.",
      "Then place a glob of butter into the palm of your hand and generously rub the entire outside of the turkey with the butter.",
      "Generously sprinkle the entire bird with salt, freshly ground black pepper, onion powder, granulated garlic powder, tarragon, parsley flakes, thyme, basil and paprika. Pour about 1/4 to 1/2 inch of chicken broth in the bottom of the roasting pan, being careful not to wash any of the seasonings off the turkey. Completely tent the turkey with aluminum foil and place into a preheated 325\u00b0F oven for about 1 1/2 hours.",
      "Remove the foil tent and wrap foil around the legs and wings. Baste the turkey and return it to the oven for the remainder of the cooking time, which will be when the interior temperature of the bird reaches 180 degrees, or until the juices run clear and not red when you puncture the bird between the thigh and the breast. Cooking time will vary depending on the size of the turkey. NOTE: I always cook my turkey unstuffed. I place my stuffing into baking dishes to bake.",
      "DIRECTIONS FOR BREAD STUFFING:",
      "Place 2 Tablespoons butter into a hot skillet. When the butter is melted, add the small dices of celery, lightly sprinkle with salt, and saute until the celery pieces are tender.",
      "Transfer the celery with the pan juices to a large pot or a very large mixing bowl. Add the turkey or chicken stuffing. Tear the white bread into small, but not too small, pieces and add the bread to the mix. Add the 4 eggs. Season to taste with the herbs. Add a little water if necessary, but be careful not to make it too mushy, otherwise you will need to add more torn up white bread. Mix it well.",
      "Preheat oven to 325\u00b0F Spray baking dishes with Pam or a non-stick spray, and fill the baking dishes with the stuffing mixture. Cover with aluminum foil and bake 30 to 45 minutes.",
      "DIRECTIONS FOR CANDIED YAMS OR SWEET POTATOES:",

    "title": "pumpkin rugelach",
    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "Prepare the dough. Cut the butter and cream cheese into tablespoon-sized pats and let soften for 10-15 minutes. Pulse the flour and salt in the food processor, and then add the semi-softened butter and cream cheese and pulse several times, until the mixture has formed large crumbly chunks (this can also be done very easily with a pastry knife, if you've got a sleeping baby and don't want to use the food processor). Gather the dough together into two large balls, flatten into disks and wrap in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for two hours or up to overnight. While the dough is chilling, prepare the filling. Heat 3 tablespoons of olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat until shimmery. Toss in the chopped shallots, sage, and aleppo and cook for 2 minutes. Stir in the pumpkin puree and cook for 5 minutes more, to help evaporate some of the water in the pumpkin. Season with two healthy pinches of kosher salt and freshly ground pepper. Remove from the heat to cool down (the filling should not be hot when you spread it on the dough). Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. When the dough has chilled, roll each disk into a 12\" circle on a well-floured board. Make sure you flour the underside of the dough often, so that it doesn't stick. Spread half of the cooled pumpkin filling onto each disk, and then distribute half of the finely chopped walnuts over each disk. Using a bench scraper (or knife, or pizza cutter), cut the dough into 16 triangles. Roll up each triangle, starting from the base, to form a crescent, and place on a parchment paper-lined cookie sheet. Beat the egg with a teaspoon of water and brush lightly onto the rugelach. Top each rugelach with flaky sea salt or finely grated parmesan (I prefer the sea salt, my husband prefers parmesan, so I make half of each kind). Bake for 25 minute."
