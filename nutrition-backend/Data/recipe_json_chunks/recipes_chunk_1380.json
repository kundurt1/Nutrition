      "Rinse the raspberries very quickly and put on kitchen paper towel to drain for 1 minute. Add the raspberries to the pot and cover with the remaining sugar. \r\nStir to coat the raspberries with sugar and cover with a clean cloth. Let stand at room temperature for 8 hours, stirring occasionally, so the sugar dissolves completely before cooking. You will have a lot of syrup, unlike the mix fruit + sugar and cook method.",
      "For no-seed jam: Pass the raspberries through a food mill fitted with a fine screen and weigh the raspberries after deseeded.",
      "Bring the raspberries and sugar to a low simmer and cook for 15minutes, stirring constantly to prevent burning. During this boiling stage, skim off the foam, using a big spoon.",
      "Check the directions of your No-Sugar Needed Pectin Packet and measure the pectin needed for the weight of raspberries. To this quantity add 25% more of Pectin (see Note 3) and dissolve all of this pectin in the lemon juice.",
      "Add the lemon juice / pectin to the pan and allow the berry-pectin mix to boil on medium heat for 1 minute.",
      "Fill sterilized jars immediately (it's really important that the jam is still very hot) to 1/4 inch of tops, wipe clean the rims and close immediately with a sterilized tight fitting lid. Turn the jars up-side down for 20 minutes. Turn them back over and allow to cool.",
      "Clean jars, label them at least with the date and store in cool dark place.",
      "Note 1: Always make only one batch at a time. If you double or triple the recipe's contents you often end up with a softer jam.",
      "Note 2: If you want, sterilize the jam in the jars. Place the filled jars in a water bath. Boil for 10 minutes after the water has returned to a boil.\r\nRemove the jars to cool on a cooling rack.",
      "Note 3: Pectin - About Pectin: I did some research on brands sold in the US. The one that is most similar to the one I use nowadays is Sure-Jell \"No Sugar Needed\" Pectin. Because I cut down on sugar, I prefer to add 25% more of pectin to the jam and be sure that it sets, rather than having a runnier jam and having to \"remake\" the jam.",

To achieve this, frost all the way to the edge of the cake layer. When you place the next layer of cake on top, press down slightly-this stabilizes the layer and helps the frosting ooze out a bit more to the edge.

    "title": "beet, orange, olive and walnut salad",
    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "THE BEETS:\r\nWash beets and pat dry, then halve them. Place in a baking dish and lightly coat with olive oil. Cover with foil and bake 45-60 minutes in a 375-degree oven until done. Cool. Slip off the skins, cut into wedges and then set aside.",
      "THE WALNUTS:\r\nToss walnuts, 1 tbsp walnut oil, pinch of sugar, and salt and pepper to taste in a small bowl. Place on a baking sheet, and toast in the 375-degree oven for 5-7 minutes. Keep a very close eye on them after 5 minutes, as they burn quickly! Cool. Coarsely chop and set aside.",
      "THE DRESSING:\r\nWhisk together: the orange juice, 1 tbsp walnut oil, 2 tbsp olive oil, the red wine vinegar and salt and pepper to taste. Set aside.",
      "FINAL ASSEMBLY:\r\nPrepare the oranges by cutting off the top and bottom. Cut off the skins with a knife so that no white pith remains. The cut into small sections. Wash the lettuce and either tear or cut into pieces. Dry. Toss the lettuce with half the dressing and place on a platter. Toss the beets with the remainder of the dressing and place on top of the lettuce. Garnish with the orange sections, olives, preserved lemon and walnuts.",
      "This recipe is enough for a one-quart mason jar; adjust amounts accordingly for larger or smaller glass containers. A wide-mouth jar is recommended, making it easier to remove the lemons for use later. Quarter the lemons from the top to within 1/2 inch of the bottom, sprinkle salt on the exposed flesh, then reshape the fruit. Place 1 tablespoon salt on the bottom of the jar. Pack in the lemons and push them down, adding more salt and the herbs/spices between layers. Press the lemons down to release their juices and to make room for the remaining lemons. Add freshly squeezed lemon juice to cover the lemons. You might find recipes that call for covering lemons with water, but we think using juice creates a better product. Leave a little air space before putting the lid on the jar. Place the jar in the refrigerator and shake the jar daily to distribute the salt. The lemons are ready to use after 4-6 weeks. Most recipes use only the peel. To use, remove the desired amount from the jar and discard the pulp unless the recipe instructs otherwise. Rinse the peel under running water. Preserved lemons will keep up to a year in the refrigerator. The pickling juice can be used two or three times over the course of a year. Remove bay leaves and coriander seeds after about 2 months, as they will make the lemons start to taste bitter over time. NOTE: I have also seen red peppercorns or a slice of red bell pepper put into the jar to add some color."

      "Drain all but 2 tablespoons of the bacon fat from the skillet, and return it to the burner over medium heat. Sprinkle the dried herbs and spices (through the cayenne pepper) into the bacon fat and fry for 1 minute. Reduce heat to medium low and carefully pour the bourbon into the skillet, scraping the pan to loosen up the browned bits and spices. Allow the bourbon glaze to reduce for 3-5 minutes, but be careful not to let it burn.",
      "Toss the shrimp in the salt and pepper, and then add them to the pan in an even layer. Stir to evenly coat the shrimp in spices and bourbon glaze, and cook until pink on both sides (about 4 minutes). Pour in the lemon juice, and scatter the crumbled bacon and scallions into the skillet, tossing to combine. Cook for an additional 3-5 minutes. Taste, and add additional salt if necessary.",
      "Divide the grits among your serving bowls, and spoon a generous helping of the shrimp mixture over each. Enjoy immediately with a glass of your favorite bourbon - straight or in a cocktail."

      "Preheat the oven to 375\u00b0F. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper.",
      "Melt the chocolate: In a medium saucepan, bring about 3 inches of water to a simmer over medium heat. In a large heatproof bowl, combine the unsweetened chocolate, chocolate chips, and butter. Set the bowl over the simmering water and melt the chocolate, stirring it regularly with a wooden spoon to avoid scorching. Set it aside to cool until lukewarm.",
      "Make the batter: In a bowl, whisk together the sugar, eggs, and vanilla. In another bowl, sift together the flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, and salt; whisk to combine. Stir the egg mixture into the cooled chocolate. Then gently stir in the flour mixture. Do not overmix.",
      "Bake the pies: Scoop the batter by scant 1/4-cup measures onto the prepared baking sheets, keeping the shapes round and about 2 inches in diameter. Leave room between them because they will spread as they bake. You should have about 32 rounds. Bake until they puff up, 5 to 8 minutes. If they seem a little too soft in the centers, leave them in the oven for an additional 1 to 2 minutes. Remove the baking sheets from the oven and allow the cookies to cool for 10 to 15 minutes before gently transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.",
      "Flavor the milk: In a medium saucepan, heat the milk to a simmer and addd 3/4 cup of the toasted almonds. Remove the pan from the heat and allow the almonds to steep in the milk for 15 to 20 minutes. Then strain the milk and pour it back into the same pan. Discard the almonds.",
      "Make the filling: In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, beat together the sugar, flour, cornstarch, and egg yolks until the mixture thickens and forms a ribbon that falls when you lift the beater, 3 to 5 minutes. Pour some of the warm almond milk over the eggs and whisk to blend. Then pour the entire egg mixture back into the milk. Cook over medium-low heat, stirring constant with a wooden spoon, until the mixture thickens, 5 to 8 minutes. Stir in the almond extract. When the mixture begins to bubble, cook for an additional 2 minutes, stirring to make sure it doesn't cling to the bottom of the pan and burn. Pour the filling into a bowl. Cover it tightly with a layer of plastic wrap, pressing it down so it touches the filling and protects it from forming a skin. Refrigerate until cold.",
      "Assemble the whoopie pies: Spread out half of the cookies, flat side up, and scoop the filling onto them. Sprinkle with the remaining 1/4 cup slivered almonds, and top each one with another cookie, flat side down. Serve at room temperature (preferably) or chilled."

In a few minutes, once steam begins to rise, cook 3-4 minutes until just tender when skewered. Remove domed lid and set tiers on empty pots and/or in front of open windows to cool.Do not rinse. (Retain the covered steamer with hot water in case you want to add more potatoes to the recipe after tasting the mixture.)",
      "Saute chorizo in a little hot oil over medium heat until browned and some fat has been released. Remove from the pan, leaving the fat in the pan. Saute onions in that fat over medium high heat until soft and translucent or lightly browned. Add cooked potatoes and stir to coat. Add chorizo and salsa verde. Simmer 5-10 minutes to blend flavors. Don't let it be too dry or too soupy.Taste and adjust ingredients as needed. (It will be very salty from the salsa verde and the chorizo, but the yoghurt will counter that nicely.)",
      "One at a time, toast tortillas over a wire rack over a medium flame- on both sides. Keep them warm, wrapped in a kitchen towel. (Or heat 1/4\" vegetable oil til hot, briefly saute tortilla on each side til slightly crispy but still pliable, drain on paper towelsl.)",
      "When all tortillas are toasted, fill each with about 1/3 cup of the hot chorizo mixture, top generously with plain yoghurt and chopped cilantro, and serve.\r\nThe tangy yoghurt counters the salty spiciness perfectly.",
      "We allow 3-4 chorizo tacos per hungry adult.\r\nMakes 6 cups filling (about 18 tacos)",
      "Notes*:\r\nI do not care for the cinnamon notes in Mexican chorizo. For this recipe, I prefer Portuguese chorizo, like Gaspari.",
      "Notes**: I have become a major fan of steaming instead of blanching or boiling. It is quicker, uses less water and fuel,requires no dangerous boiling water, and is far more nutritional, as the steamed food retains its nutrients rather than discharging them into a big pot of water. I love my 2- tiered aluminum Chinese dome-topped steamers which I bought in a Chinatown restaurant supply store. The tiers are flat (think 'flat colander'' or 'cake pan with holes all over') and they are so space efficient, both for setting over another pot to cool, and for stacked storage.They have an interior diameter of 10\" and hold alot of food in a single layer. They also have a good rim around each tier, making it easy to grasp them. You can improvise a steamer by placing a disposable aluminum pan (that you have punctured all over with a skewer tip) over a water filled can or a cake rack -into a larger pot with a few inches of water in the bottom, and a tight fitting lid. Or you can use the standby fold-up 'steamer basket', opened up as wide and flat as possible, to hold more food."

Place the main embossed design (with the handle) over the top and press firmly. I recommend cutting out then pressing several at a time while keeping the rest of the sheet of dough covered so the dough does not dry out. If using just a one-sided embossed design, you can cut out rounds first and then print your design on the top, pressing firmly. Again, do several at a time and keep the rest of the sheet of dough covered so it doesn't dry out. Place finished corzetti on a clean kitchen towel. You can let them air-dry as they are until they are ready to cook, or you can cook them right away.",

      "Bring a large pot of boiling water to boil. Add a heaped teaspoon of salt. Cook the corzetti in the boiling water until al dente (about 4 minutes-taste one, it should give way gently but have a pleasant bite to it; also check that the pasta should show no signs of white/uncooked flour). Drain, setting aside some (a cup or so) of the cooking water, and then place the pasta immediately back in the pot, over very low heat and add the walnut mixture. Add a splash of the cooking water to loosen. You'll see that as you agitate the pan, tossing the pasta through the sauce and combining it with the pasta cooking water, that the sauce turns into beautiful, glossy, creamy, and off-white. Continue tossing the pasta for 1 minute, adding as much cooking water as needed to loosen the sauce so that it coats the corzetti thickly but smoothly. Serve with the rest of the Parmesan scattered on top (and if you like, a few fresh extra marjoram leaves)."

      "A note about lemons. When I suggest that you use Meyer lemons if at all possible, it is because of their tender zest, the sweet tones in their flavor, and their smaller size, all relative to regular lemons. That said, they aren't available year-round. If you need to substitute regular lemons, using half as much of both the juice and zest where called for. Also add the zest and juice of a quarter orange to add back some of the sweetness lost if Meyers aren't available. And if the flavor is still just a bit too tart, simply dilute it with some additional stock. Bon appetit!",
      "Film the bottom of a medium skillet with olive oil and place over medium-high heat. Add the onions and a good pinch of salt. Saute until softened. Add the garlic, walnut pieces, cardamom, sage leaves and Panko (or bread crumbs). Saute, stirring often, until walnuts and garlic are fragrant, and Panko takes on a toasted color, about 8-10 minutes.",
      "Transfer contents of skillet to bowl of a food processor. Add the garbanzo beans and lemon zest, and pulse until well blended, but not pureed. Add the egg and pulse until nearly a paste-like consistency. Season to taste with salt and pepper.",
      "Line a baking sheet with parchment. I use a small ice cream scoop that's about 1 1/2\" in diameter (#30) to scoop the \"meatballs.\" If you don't have one, use a soup spoon to scoop up about the same amount, and roll them between your palms to round (you may need to dip your palms in some flour). You should get 16, and they will fit on one baking sheet.",
      "Bake for 25 minutes, rotating at the halfway point. They want to be a bit firm, and have a nice crust on the outside. While they are baking, prepare the soup.",
      "Trim the cauliflower. Quarter the larger florets. Add the cauliflower florets and the stock to a soup pot. Bring to a boil, then cover the pot and reduce heat to an active simmer. Cook until they are very tender (pierce a stem with a paring knife), about 15 minutes.",
      "When cauliflower is very soft, add the spinach. Replace the lid and steam until spinach has wilted, about 5-7 minutes more.",
      "Remove the pot from the heat. This is a job for an immersion blender. Add the lemon juice and puree the sauce right in the pot until it is as smooth as possible. Add stock as needed; the consistency wants to be pourable, not thick. Alternatively, use a food processor, or a blender. Though if the latter, be careful, as hot liquids tend to take on a life of their own in a blender. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Re-warm if necessary before serving.",
      "Serve in pasta bowls. Pour a couple of ladles of soup in the bottom of each one. Think shallow end of the pool; you don't want the meatballs to drown. Add 3 or 4 meatballs. Drizzle a bit of olive oil over, garnish with Feta, and please don't forget the parsley!",

Take the orange quarters and squeeze the juice into the water, then drop the quarters whole in as well. Add a little salt to taste (I do about 1/2 tsp). This is your poaching liquid. Bring the liquid to a boil, then reduce the heat down so it's barely simmering. Cover with lid and let simmer for about 10 minutes so flavors can infuse. Turn off heat and add the shrimp in all at once. Let shrimp stay in poaching liquid until they turn opaque in color and are just firm to the touch -- around a minute, maybe minute and half (time will depend on how large your shrimp are). Remove with slotted spoon (as seen above) and let stand to cool. Discard poaching liquid.",
      "While the poaching liquid infuses, you can make the corn. Heat a little olive oil in a small saute pan. Add the corn kernels and season with salt and pepper to taste. Cook about 5 minutes -- the corn will turn bright yellow. Let stand to cool but best if use while still a little warm.",
      "To assemble the salad, simple place the arugula in a large mixing bowl. Add the scallions, corn, tomatoes, and shrimp. Season with some salt and pepper to taste. Add enough of the vinaigrette to moisten the salad and toss to combine. Top with feta cheese and serve immediately.",

Now set the oven to broil, spread the nectarines in a single layer in a cast iron pan and pop them under the flame. Roast them until golden. Be sure to let them completely cool before handling for obvious reasons, and because they will be very soft when they come out of the oven. Letting them cool will also allow them to steam a bit and release from the baking surface.",

    "title": "no-knead focaccia",
    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "Make the dough: Pour the water into a large bowl. If you are using fresh yeast, crumble the yeast into the water and whisk until it is completely dissolved (since there is no kneading, it's very important that the yeast be completely dissolved). If you are using active dry yeast, mix the yeast into the flour. Then, in this order, add the flour, sugar, and salt to the water in the bowl. Use your hand to swirl the ingredients together; then use a plastic dough scraper to scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl. Continue to mix the dough by hand in the bowl (it's very sticky, so you're really just scooping it away from the sides of the bowl with a cupped hand and folding it on top of itself) until there aren't any clumps, about 1 minute. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and set it aside at room temperature until the dough has relaxed into the bowl and risen slightly (not a lot happens visually in this stage), about 30 minutes.",
      "Stretch and fold the dough: Remove the plastic wrap and drizzle a little olive oil around the edges of the dough and over your hands. Use a dough scraper to help you grab one-quarter of the dough, stretch it up, and flop it over onto itself without pressing down on the dough. You're really just gently folding the edges onto the middle, giving the dough 4 folds without pressing on it, which would release the gas in the dough. Slide the dough scraper under the dough and turn it over. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and set it aside for about 20 minutes, until, when you grab a small knob of the dough, you can see that there is a little gluten development, but if you stretch it too far, it rips easily.",
      "Repeat the folding of 4 \"corners\" as you did in step 2. Turn the dough over again and let it rest for 20 minutes. After this rest, it will look a bit smoother, and when a small piece of dough is stretched, you should be able to feel and see a lot of gluten development.",
      "While the dough rests, place a pizza stone in the oven and preheat the oven to 475\u00b0 F. (If you have another sheet pan, you can use that instead of a pizza stone. If the sheet pan is rimmed, turn it upside down so you have a completely flat surface. The heat from the oven may cause the pan to warp slightly, but it will flatten out after it comes out of the oven.) You want the stone to be very hot when you put the bread in, so even after the oven is up to temperature, let the stone heat for at least 20 minutes before baking the focaccia.",
      "Stretch and divide the dough: Heavily flour your work surface. Use the dough scraper to lift and transfer the dough to the floured surface, and flour the top of the dough (don't be cheap with the flour!). Gently lift, pull, and stretch the dough into a 14-by-8-inch rectangle. Use a bench scraper to divide the dough in half lengthwise so you have 2 long strips, and then divide the strips into 4 pieces each for a total of 8 pieces.",
      "Shape and proof the dough: Place a piece of dough with a short edge facing you. Using your fingers and starting at the short edge, roll the dough over a quarter turn to start making a cylinder shape. Use your fingertips to firmly press the edge onto the dough, trying to only seal the edge and not press down on the body of the roll (you don't want to press out the trapped gas in the dough). Then roll the dough again and press the cylinder down to tack it onto the dough. Repeat twice, until you have a completed cylinder. Repeat with the remaining pieces of dough. Place the rolled pieces of dough on a heavily floured sheet pan (or leave them on your work surface) and cover it with a kitchen towel. Set it aside in a warm, draft-free spot until you see a few bubbles on the surface of the dough and each piece of dough has increased in volume by 50%, about 30 minutes (or a little less or a little longer depending on the temperature of the dough and the temperature of your kitchen).",
      "Dimple and season the dough: Place a small bowl of flour on the work surface. Set a long sheet of parchment paper on a pizza peel, large cutting board, or upside-down sheet pan (a cool one, not the one in the oven!). You can also use a large piece of cardboard. Flour the parchment lightly and stretch 2 pieces of dough on top, creating two 8-by-4-inch rectangles. Dip your fingers into the flour and make deep depressions in the dough. Drizzle some olive oil over the dough, and then sprinkle the dough with a few generous pinches of oregano, sesame seeds, and coarse salt. Use your fingertips to further deepen the initial dimples in the dough.",
      "Bake the focaccia: Open the oven door and quickly slide the dough-topped parchment onto the hot baking stone. Bake until the breads are nicely browned around the edges and golden brown everywhere else, 9 to 11 minutes. Slide the parchment onto a wire rack and drizzle the hot focaccia with more olive oil. Repeat with the remaining pieces of dough. Serve warm or at room temperature."

Lower heat slightly and add the ground fennel seed, thyme, sage, and reserved porcini powder, and saute about a minute to cook off their raw taste. Add the tomato paste and let it take on some color, stirring constantly to prevent scorching. Raise the heat to high and deglaze with the marsala or sherry, stirring to scrape up browned bits. When the marsala is about half-reduced, add the tomatoes and the mushroom-chicken broth and bring to a boil. Nestle in chicken thighs, skin-side up, cover, and transfer to the oven. Braise until chicken is falling-off-the-bone tender, about 1 1/2 hours.",
      "When the chicken is cooked to the desired tenderness, remove the pan from the oven. Fish out the thighs with tongs and set aside til cool enough to handle. Meanwhile, put the pan over medium-low heat on the stovetop, and allow the sauce to simmer down and tighten up a bit. When chicken is cool enough to handle, remove skin, bones, and gristle, and roughly shred the meat by hand. Return to the sauce, along with the heavy cream, if using, and heat through. Garnish with parsley and serve with gnocchi; with something ridged and tubular such as rigatoni; or with something ribbony like pappardelle or malfatti (which you can make by smashing up lasagna sheets into smaller, bite-size pieces)."

Once that's combined add another 2 Tbsp liquid. As the eggs get warmer you can add more and more liquid each time. By the time I've added about half the liquid I usually just add the rest of the liquid in one go.)",

(This is kind of weird, but I really like using dental floss for clean cuts of foods with a dough-like consistency - cookies, ice cream, butter, etc. I find it a lot easier than using a knife. In the case of this cake, I wrapped the floss around the circumference, making sure that it was in the perfect location on all sides. Then I just crossed the ends of the floss and pulled in opposite directions to close the loop. As I pulled, the loop got smaller and smaller, and the only direction it could travel was through the ice cream.)",

Freeze until solid (about an hour), then transfer to a zip-top storage bag and store in the freezer. They last for weeks this way, and you can bake as many or as few as you like at a moment's notice. When you're ready to bake, arrange the dough balls on the baking sheet and let them sit at room temperature to thaw slightly before putting them in the oven.",
      "For ice cream sandwiches: \r\n\r\nGet the cookies ready, arranging half of them upside down on a baking sheet.\r\n\r\nYou can get a uniform shape by using a dry measuring cup as a mold for the ice cream. Or, you can get a more handmade look by simply scooping a large scoop of ice cream onto a cookie, sandwiching it with a second cookie, and pressing on the cookies slightly.\r\n\r\nFreeze the sandwiches, putting the baking sheet in the freezer to let them harden for at least two hours. If you're storing the sandwiches for longer than one day, transfer the hardened sandwiches to zip-top freezer bags, being sure to squeeze out any excess air before sealing."

Mix the mugwort and pepper together and roll your venison in it, giving a light coating.\r\n4. Leave in the fridge over night or if it is less than 2 hours before you cook the venison, leave it out on the side\r\n5.

Grate the potato with an ordinary grater\r\n\r\n4. Grate some horseradish root into the mixture to taste and season with salt and pepper.\r\n\r\n5.

Turn each piece as it colours - be careful not to let the pepper burn too much - and keep turning until the meat is well coloured\r\n\r\n4. If you are cooking the meat to rare small steaks will take a matter of 2 or 3 minutes while larger ones will take under 10 minutes\r\n5. Rest the meat for at least as long as it cooked for in a warm place and then slice across the grain. While the meat is resting make the blackberry sauce",

      "Unless the fresh pasta is semi-transparently thin, blanch the noodles a few minutes (longer if dry) to al dente, in salted boiling water; lift out and into colander; rinse briefly in cold running water and dry on cloth towels.\r\n In a well- buttered or sprayed 9 x 13 inch ceramic dish, lay down one layer of noodles, overlapping slightly. Top with half the cooked chard mix. Spread out evenly to edges of pan.Lay down a second pasta layer, slightly overlapping, in the opposite direction from the first layer. Scatter half the: beans, cheese, breadcrumbs, and half the walnuts, and drizzle with half the heavy cream. Sprinkle with freshly ground black pepper.\r\n Top with another overlapping layer of noodle and the remaining chard mix. Top with the last pasta, the remaining beans, comte, bread crumbs and walnuts.\r\n Drizzle liberally with remaining heavy cream. Sprinkle a little fresh ground black pepper and the ground parmesan on top. Dot with unsalted butter.\r\n Cover the lasagna very loosely with buttered or sprayed parchment paper or foil and bake in the upper third of the oven for 15 minutes. Remove the parchment paper and bake for about 15 minutes longer, until the lasagna is bubbling and top is browned in spots. Tent with foil and let rest for 15 minutes before serving."

      "To make the dough: Lightly oil a large bowl and set it aside. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook attachment, combine the water and yeast and let sit for 20 to 30 seconds to allow the yeast to dissolve and activate. Dump the flour and salt onto the yeast mixture, and carefully turn the mixer onto low speed. Let the dough mix for about 10 seconds. (To prevent the flour from flying out of the bowl, turn the mixer on and off several times until the flour is mixed into the liquid, and then keep it on low speed.) When the dough is still shaggy looking, drizzle in the olive oil, aiming it along the side of the work bowl to keep it from splashing and making a mess.",
      "With the mixer still on low speed, knead the dough for 4 to 5 minutes, or until it is smooth and supple. The dough should be somewhat sticky but still smooth, and have an elastic, stretchy consistency. If it is much stiffer than this, mix in 2 to 3 tablespoons water; if it is much looser than this, mix in 2 to 3 tablespoons flour.",
      "Transfer the dough to the oiled bowl. Cover the bowl with a piece of plastic wrap or a damp lint-free cloth. Place the bowl in a draft-free, warm place (78 to 82\u00b0 F [25 to 28\u00b0 C] is ideal; an area near the stove or in the oven with only the pilot light on is good) for 2 to 3 hours. The dough should rise until it is about double in bulk. (This is called proofing the dough.)",
      "Meanwhile, make the honey goo: In a medium saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat and whisk in the honey, cream, water, and salt. Remove the pan from the heat and let the goo cool for about 30 minutes before using, or until room temperature. The goo can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.",
      "To make the filling: Place a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 350\u00b0 F (175\u00b0 C). Put the cashews on a baking sheet and toast for 8 to 10 minutes, or until lightly toasted. Turn off the oven and set the cashews aside to cool.",
      "Punch down the dough to deflate it-literally give it a punch in the center of the puffy dough, which will allow you to roll it out more easily. On a floured work surface, roll out the dough into a 12-inch (30-centimeter) square about 1/4-inch (6-millimeter) thick. It will be a bit stretchy and it may spring back, but keep rolling gently until it roughly holds its shape.",
      "In a small bowl, with a wooden spoon, mix together the butter, cinnamon, and toasted cashews for the filling. Spread this mixture evenly over the entire surface of the dough square.",
      "Using your hands and starting from the top of the square, and working your way down, roll the dough loosely like a jelly roll until the entire sheet is rolled up. Using a sharp knife, trim both edges of the dough roll about 1/4 inch (6 millimeter) to even out the ends. Using a bench scraper or a chef's knife, cut the roll into 12 equal pieces, each about 1-inch (3-centimeter) thick. (At this point, the unbaked buns can be tightly wrapped in plastic wrap-either individually or stack them all and wrap as a tower-and frozen for up to 1 week. When ready to bake, remove the buns from the freezer. Leave them wrapped and thaw in the refrigerator overnight, or at room temperature for 2 to 3 hours; proceed as directed.)",
      "Pour the goo into a 9- by 13-inch (23- by 33-centimeter) baking pan. Place the buns in the pan, evenly spaced. If some of the buns have become oblong or oddly shaped from the cutting and moving around, feel free to arrange them once they are in the pan into round spirals. Cover the pan loosely with plastic wrap and let the buns proof at warm room temperature (78 to 82\u00b0 F [25 to 28\u00b0 C] is ideal; an area near the stove or in the oven with only the pilot light on is good) for 1 to 2 hours, or until the dough is puffy, pillowy, and soft and the buns are touching.",
      "About 15 minutes before the buns are ready to bake, place a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 400\u00b0 F (205\u00b0 C).",
      "Bake for 40 to 50 minutes, or until the buns are pale and light golden brown. Remove from the oven and let cool in the pan on a wire rack for 10 to 20 minutes.",
      "Using a spatula, invert the buns, one at a time, onto a serving platter. Serve warm. (These are best served warm or within 4 hours of baking. You could make them one day and serve them the next after warming them in a 300\u00b0 F (150\u00b0 C) oven for 6 to 8 minutes.)"

Stir ONLY until sugar is dissolved, then LEAVE IT ALONE! I mean this. Don't touch it, even though you will want to stir it, because everything in your baking mind tells you not to leave it. If you stir it, even once, the sugar will crystalize and it will be done for, and the mess is a bitch to clean up.

Using a pastry brush or the back of a spoon, paint the interior of the dough with mustard. Pour in cooled lamb filling. Cover the filling with slices of cheese. Roll out second disc of dough. Place dough on top of cheese and filling. Seal the top layer of dough with the bottom. Tuck edges underneath. Crimp away! Or fold over. Or use the tines of a fork to make a pretty pattern. If you have any scraps of dough, add a few decorative flourishes in the form of a lightning bolt, a leaf, a star, or a heart.",
      "Whisk together egg and cream. Using a pastry brush, paint the top and edges of the pie with the egg wash. Don't go overboard. Just a light coating. You will have a lot left over. Save it for your next pie. Decoratively cut several 2-inch long gashes in the center of the pie to allow the steam to escape. Sprinkle crust with coarse salt. Bake until crust is golden brown and the lamb filling is bubbling a bit out of the slits (45 to 55 minutes). Remove from the oven. Allow to cool for at least 20 minutes. Serve with something refreshing like yogurt mixed with chopped mint and lemon zest. Or a crisp green salad with avocado and pomegranate arils."

      "Stack all the slices of bread together on a cutting board; then cut the largest rectangle you can from the stack by trimming away all the crusts and then some. You want these 4 slices to stack up perfectly. Lightly butter all sides of the slices except the bottom face.",
      "Spread each of selected sandwich fillings, layer by layer: What you select should all go well together. Crab meat salad, roasted pepper hummus, egg salad, spinach pesto aioli, whipped goat cheese with roasted tomatoes and rosemary, chopped cucumber and cress (good to include a salad course in your trio), salmon salad in mustard dill, ham salad in horseradish mustard, or chicken tarragon are some ideas to consider...but design a compatible combination you will love. Make sure you will be able to slice through each layer effortlessly, and that the layers will remain in tact, so select wisely. One interior layer can use aioli in the mix, but I would not use it on more. My recipe for the aioli can be found on this site- http://www.food52.com/recipes/12014_umami_aioli_for_fish_especially_bluefish Reserve the rest of the aioli for the top. Keep the mini loaf straight. Press down gently as you build the layers.",
      "Next frost the loaf. I suggest you use a goat cheese mixed with yogurt and aioli as a spread for all the sides. Maybe use straight aioli for the top. Garnish with suitable herbs and pickled vegetables. Chill for a few hours for the flavors to permeate and for the layers to meld a bit together: this makes slicing easy later. Garnish the plate with greens. Slice and serve. Don't hate me if you don't like this! But if you do like this, then you could make a whole full size loaf of unsliced bread, which you then slice horizontally into 3 or 4 layers."

Generously rub flavorful olive oil over the cut. Wrap each head in a pouch of aluminum foil (set root-side down in the middle of a square piece of foil which, when pressed up around the head covers it completely on each side and has enough slack left to bunch up on top). Leave a small opening in the folded foil over the center of the stem-side for stem to escape through while roasting. Drizzle a few more drops of oil through this opening. Place the two well wrapped heads with the openings up on a rack in the middle of your oven and let them roast for 45 minutes while you are preparing the rest of the dish.",
      "If using fresh sprouts, cut the stems with a V-cut (to aid cooking later and to allow for their flavor to develop more fully) and clean any yellowing leaves. If using frozen sprouts, you can make a shallow X-cut in each head for the same purpose, without loosening too many leaves.",

While all of the mix will ultimately finish cooking in the oven, you want to make sure the flour's raw taste is gone at this point, which needs at least 1-2 minutes. Do not allow the flour to brown.",

      "Stir in 1 cup of the cheese until it melts. (If you think the sauce is too thick, you can add another 1/2 cup milk, but generally the juices of the mushrooms and sprouts release in the first step provide sufficient addition to the specified amount of milk).",
      "Squeeze the garlic cloves out of their skins (which you have taken out of the oven after 45 or so minutes of roasting and ideally also cooled down by now) into the mix. If roasted sufficiently, they should pop out very easily.",

My personal favorite combination is Gruyere in the mix and Bulgarian Kashkaval (preferably a piece that has been in the fridge for some time, so that it gets hard enough for grating) for the top crust since it not only melts nicely but turns a wonderful golden-brown color under the broiler.)",

      "When you are ready to start the whole cooking process, move your oven rack to lower middle position and preheat oven to 300\u00b0F. While the oven is coming up to temperature, place stock in a large liquid measuring cup and sprinkle gelatin over the top. Set the mixture aside.",
      "Then, add 2 tablespoons of olive oil to a large Dutch oven, over high heat until it begins to shimmer. Next, Add salt pork and cook, stirring occasionally, until browned all over, about 8 minutes. Once the meat has cooked Transfer to a large bowl and set aside. Then add the pork shoulder and brown, followed by the sausage. Once each type of meat is browned, add it to a bowl and set it aside.",

Then, add the beans, carrot, celery, garlic, parsley and bay leaves. I made my parsley/bay leaves into a bouquet garni to make removing it later easy! Once the vegetables have softened a bit, you can add the stock/gelatin mixture. Bring the mixture to a simmer over high heat. Once boiling, reduce the heat to low, cover the Dutch oven and cook until beans are almost tender but retain a slight bite, about 45 minutes.",
      "Once the beans are mostly tender, remove the bouquet garni and add all of the meats to pot, making sure that the duck end up on top of the beans with the skin facing upwards. The Beans should remain almost completely submerged. Transfer to oven and cook, uncovered, until a thin crust forms on top, about 2 hours, adding more water by pouring it carefully down the side of the pot as necessary to keep beans mostly covered.",
      "After 2 hours break up the curst with a spoon and shake the pot gently to redistribute. Then, return to oven and continue cooking, stopping to break and shake the crust every 30 minutes until you reach the 4 hour mark. Once you are about 20 minutes away from eating, top the mixture with the bread crumbs and return it to the oven so they can crisp. Once the bread crumbs are golden brown, take the pot out of the oven and serve immediately."

Toss the Portobello slices in about 3 tablespoons of the oil, season with salt and pepper and sear each side for a couple of minutes in the hot pan, until softened. Ideally, we want to mark the Portobello slices with black grill marks but this might not always happen depending on the size and shape of the mushroom slices and your grill pan. A regular fry pan can also be used. Place on paper towels to drain some of the moisture off and set aside.",

Add the chopped tomatoes, the vinegar and sugar. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Stir over medium heat until sauce is heated through. It will thicken slightly, that's ok - you don't want it too runny. Remove from heat and and stir in the basil.",

Remove from oven and let stand for 10 minutes to cool slightly. Run a knife around the edge of the pan and turn your torta out onto a platter (If this scares you, you can simply cut slices from the pan and serve it from there). Cut into slices and enjoy!"

On the 3rd day (ie the fourth time boiling the mixture), add the cloves and cinnamon, boil and let the mixture reach setting point - i.e. when the sugar syrup slowly drops off a spoon. Also test to make sure that the walnuts are cooked. To do this, get a needle and pierce a walnut horizontally. Point the needle towards the ground and let the walnut try to slide off - if it does slide off, the walnut is cooked. Add juice of a 1/2 lemon towards the end. Note that if you boil the mixture too much, the sugar syrup will being to caramelize and you will need to add a little more water to make it more like syrup.",

While it cools dice the onion, slice the chorizo, and mince the garlic. Season the quail generously all over with salt and pepper. Now seed the pepper and slice it into strips. Eat a few, they are irresitable and you have plenty.",
      "Coat the bottom of your paella pan or large skillet with olive oil. Heat to medium-high and put the chorizo in. Brown the chorizo and then remove it with a slotted spoon. Now put the quail in the pan - you want to crisp up the skin but not cook it through, so keep the heat kind of high. When the quail are crisped take them out and set them aside.",
      "Now you can turn the heat down a little. Add the chili powder and saffron to the pan. Put the onion in and saute until it softened, then add the garlic and the rice. Cook, stirring, for a few more minutes until the rice is a little toasty. Now add the wine and tomato paste and stir, then broth and stir, then add the chorizo back in, with the peas and peppers. Cut the quail into quarters and nestle them into the rice. Cover the pan and set you timer for 15 minutes.",

I think that's right) at the same time. You can hear it sizzling if you put your ear by the pan. DO NOT catch your hair on fire. This will take just 3 or 4 minutes.",

Fill each with a centimeter or so of water with water and place on the picnic table or blanket, along with the bowl of cojita crema sprinkled with cayenne, a stack of spring roll skins, serving plates for your number of guests, and the platter of fruit, vegetables, and herbs.",
      "To make each spring roll, lay one skin flat on the plate of water and gently push it in. Turn over in the water a couple of times, until the skin is transparent and slightly more pliable-but not so long that it becomes soft and difficult to handle. After your skin has been dipped in water, return it to your plate and quickly lay down a lettuce leaf. On top of that, fill with vegetables, mango, and cilantro. Finish with a vertical line of sauce. Finally, wrap it up like a burrito-folding the bottom over, then one side and tucking it under the ingredients, then rolling tightly."

Just in case, take out 5 to 6 extra crackers extra to protect against potential errors. Once you've figured out how many crackers you'll need, melt 2 tablespoons of butter in the microwave and brush the crackers on both sides. Set aside.",

Then, line the pan again with parchment paper and invert the brownie and cracker back into the pan so that now, the cracker-layer is facing down and lining the pan.

      "Preheat the oven to 180C. Beat the sugar with butter until fluffy. Then add the egg yolks one at a time, beating the mix well after each egg yolk. Add the lemon, cognac and the vanilla. Then, by hand, add the flour, baking powder until a nice soft dough is formed (see picture above). (Note that after you start mixing the dough by hand, you can also switch to using the paddle attachment of a mixer if you want, and then finish mixing the dough with your hands.)",
      "Divide the dough in half. Press half of the dough flat into the bottom of the pan (15 inches by 10 inches). Spread the jam on top. Take the remaining dough and roll a long thin roll and place it on top of the jam so it follows the outer edge of the rectangular pan. (Try to make sure that you roll the dough on a surface that is not too warm to prevent the long thin rolls from cracking. Also make sure your hands are not too warm, and that the butter has been mixed well to help prevent the long thin rolls from cracking.)",
      "Make more rolls and place them diagonally over the jam to create a diamond pattern, as in the pictures above. If you wish, then place small roasted almond pieces in each diamond pattern. Place in the oven and cook for about 35 to 40 minutes., until the dough is golden brown in colour. Remove from oven and let cool. Once cool, cut into as many bite size squares as you wish."

Make sure the whole dumpling is sealed, if it is not sealing, moisten with more water or press harder.",

In an ovenproof skillet (8\" works well) or a low-sided sauce pan, stir together the sugar, water, vanilla bean + seeds, and green cardamom pods. Over high heat, cook the mixture until it turns a golden caramel -- about 5 to 7 minutes. Take the pan off the burner and add the rum. Return the pan to the burner, lower the heat, and cook until the rum and caramel melt together, about 2 minutes. If your sauce begins to thicken or clump, simply stir it until it's smooth or add a teaspoon or so of water if necessary. You're looking for a light, thin caramel sauce -- not one that's thick or sticky. Add the mango and cook another 2 to 3 minutes, shaking the pan a few times to evenly coat the mango with the rum-caramel sauce.",

The caramelized mango can be served hot or cooled to room temperature. You can also refrigerate it for a few days -- letting it come to room temperature or gently reheating it before use."

      "When it melts and becomes a stretchy mass, take small portions and put them in ice cube trays, to have a layer of 5mm cheese (in height) on the bottoms of each tray. Fill all the trays with popcorns and press them well, so for the cheese to fill the gaps between popcorn. Then put the trays the refrigerator for the cheese to congeal.",
      "Now you have cheesy popcorn \"cubes\" to accompany your favorite movie/tv show. Season with pepper and/or sweet paprika and enjoy.\r\n\r\n(*) I know that this way cheese turns into a somewhat thick, stretchy cheese with a layer of liquid oil sitting on top of it. Normal cheese melts like that, cause it is made of proteins, fats, and water, and these separate when they are heated. But we don't care about this, because we don't to make melt cheese for dipping, a.k.a. smooth liquid.",
