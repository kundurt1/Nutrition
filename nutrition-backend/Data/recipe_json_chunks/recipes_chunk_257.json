Heat the mixture until it begins bubble, stirring often, then remove it from the heat. In a large bowl, add all but two tablespoons of the tomato sauce to the meat. Use a large wooden spoon, or your hands to work the sauce into the meat, until it is very well combined. Combine the remaining ingredients with the ground sirloin -- flour, salt, onion powder and ground pepper. Use the wooden spoon or your hands to work the spices and flour into the meat. Load the meat into a loaf pan (preferably a meat loaf pan with two sections which allows the fat to drain, but if you don't have one of those, a regular loaf pan will work). Wrap foil over the pan and place in oven for 30 minutes. After 30 minutes, take the meat loaf from the oven, remove the foil and, if you are not using a meat loaf pan, drain fat. Using a knife, slice the meat loaf all the way through into 8 slices, while it is still in the pan. This will help to cook the center of the meat loaf. Pour the remaining 2 Tbsp. of sauce on top of the meat loaf, in a stream down the center (don't spread the sauce). Place the meat loaf back into the oven, uncovered, for 25 to 30 minutes or until it is done. Remove and allow to cool for a few minutes before serving."
