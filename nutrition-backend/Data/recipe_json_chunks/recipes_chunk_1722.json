    "title": "alcohol in cooking information recipe",
    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "DOES the vino lose its power in the Crockpot overnight In a flambe baked Alaska, does the brandy lose its bite Does the alcohol all burn off, as the cookbooks say it does Or possibly can you eat a plate of coq au vin and get a little buzz When you cook with wine or possibly brandy, here's the latest scoop: There will always be some alcohol remaining in the soup.",
      "So many cookbooks assert which all or possibly virtually all of the alcohol 'burns off' during cooking (what they mean is which it evaporates; it will not burn unless you light it), which almost everyone accepts which statement as gospel.",
      "The standard 'explanation,' when there is one, is which alcohol boils at 173 degrees Fahrenheit, while water doesn't boil till 212 degrees, and therefore the alcohol will boil off before the water does.",
      "Which's just not the way it works.",
      "It's true which pure alcohol boils at 173 degrees and pure water boils at 212.",
      "But they do not behave independently when mixed; each affects the boiling temperature of the other.",
      "A mix of alcohol and water will boil at a temperature which's somewhere between 173 and 212 degrees.",
      "When a mix of water and alcohol simmers or possibly boils, the vapors are a mix of water vapor and alcohol vapor.",
      "Exactly how much alcohol will remain in your pan depends on many factors, so a general answer for all recipes is impossible.",
      "In 1992 a group of nutritionists at the University of Idaho, Washington State University and the U.S. Department of Agriculture measured the amounts of alcohol before and after cooking two dishes similar to boeuf bourguignon and coq au vin, plus a casserole of scalloped oysters made with sherry.",
      "They found which from 4 percent to 49 percent of the original alcohol remained in the finished dishes, depending on the type of food and the cooking method.",
      "Higher temperatures, longer cooking times, uncovered pans, wider pans, top-of-the-stove rather than closed-oven cooking - all conditions which increase the general amount of evaporation - were found, not surprisingly, to increase the loss of alcohol.",
      "What about using wine to deglaze a pan when there isn't any other alcohol in the recipe The researchers didn't test it, but it stands to reason which the more you reduce it, the less alcohol is going to remain.",
      "Do you think you've burned off all the alcohol as you march triumphantly into your darkened dining room bearing a tray of blazing cherries jubilee or possibly crepes suzette Think again.",

      "If desired, finish them by piping words, monograms, or other details with the remaining stiff icing.",
      "For an added touch, before the stiff icing dries, take the cookie and place it facedown on a plate of sprinkles or sanding sugar, gently pressing the cookie so that the sprinkles adhere to the added words or other details.",
      "Let the icing dry before packaging or serving, about 1 hour.",
      "The cookies can be kept in an airtight container for up to 1 week.",
      "Royal icing can be mixed into an array of vivid colors.",
      "As you mix colors, add the food coloring judiciously, about a drop at a time, until you achieve your desired shade.",
      "Primary colors can be mixed to create a rainbow of other shades, just as you would mix paints.",
      "If you accidentally go too dark, you can adjust the icing with tablespoons of confectioners sugar and drops of water to bring the icing back to a paler shade.",
      "Keep in mind that freshly mixed royal icing has a fair amount of air incorporated into it, so the color of your icing will darken as it dries.",
      "Finally, if you are working with bright colors, be sure to allow ample time for them to dry (at least 12 hours) before layering the cookie with paler shades, because the brighter colors can bleed into the paler ones."
