Reduce the wine until the pan is almost dry, then add the skimmed juices back to the pan. If the juices are scant, supplement them with fat-free low-sodium chicken broth, as needed. Bring the mixture to a boil and then strain it into a saucepan; keep hot and set aside. In a small bowl, whisk, 4 tablespoons all-purpose flour into 1 cup water (there should be enough of the flour mixture to thicken 8 cups of gravy). Using a whisk, stir 1 cup of hot stock into the flour mixture until it is smooth. Add the thickened stock back into the remaining juices and whisk the mixture together while bringing it to a boil. Simmer the mixture for 15 minutes, seasoning with salt and pepper to taste, transfer to a gravy boat, and serve.",

Roast 30 minutes, then reduce oven temperature to 350\u00b0 and roast another 30 minutes. Remove shallots with tongs and let cool. Keep roasting beef until an instant-read thermometer inserted into center of thickest part reaches 130\u00b0 for medium-rare, 1 to 1 3/4 hours longer. Lift to a cutting board and let rest 30 to 40 minutes, loosely tented with foil.",

Cook over medium-high heat, scraping up browned bits, until gravy thickens slightly and turns a nutty brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Season with salt and strain into a serving bowl.",

      "*For easy carving, ask the butcher to cut the meat from the bones and tie them back together for roasting.",

While the roast rests (step 6), in a microwave-safe bowl, mix peas with the cold couscous and heat in a microwave oven at full power (100%), stirring occasionally, until steaming, 3 to 4 minutes total. Mix the chopped herbs with the hot couscous and use more fresh herbs for garnish."

      "Step 1: Heat milk and whey. Set a 20-qt. canner on the stovetop and insert canning rack upside down (handles down). Fill canner with water to 1 in. below top ring. Bring to a boil, covered. Fill a sink with cold water (this will be your cool-down spot should you need it). Set an empty 8-qt. pot on upturned rack in canner (it will float a little). Pour whey if using, milk, and salt into pot and insert dairy thermometer into milk mixture. With a large slotted spoon, stir milk 20 times with a gentle surface-to-bottom circular motion to evenly distribute heat. Let milk heat over high heat, covered and undisturbed, until its temperature reaches 192\u00b0 to 194\u00b0 (water will be boiling), 30 to 40 minutes; adjust heat to maintain temperature. If milk starts to get too hot, cool it in sink of water.",
      "Step 2: Acidify the milk. Slowly pour vinegar over the warm milk. With a slotted spoon, stir milk 20 times with a gentle surface-to-bottom circular motion. Small curds will begin to form (they may have already). Cover pot with canner lid and let mixture stand, undisturbed, over high heat 25 minutes for curds to finish forming (temperature should remain between 192\u00b0 and 194\u00b0; check occasionally and adjust heat as needed). Meanwhile, line mold with a double thickness of cheesecloth, trimmed to hang slightly over rim. Set a cookie or biscuit cutter in a medium bowl, then set mold on top.",
      "Step 3: Drain your curds. Gently ladle curds and whey into mold, occasionally pouring out liquid from bowl, until draining slows down to a trickle. Smooth cheese in mold so it's level. Cover bowl and mold with plastic wrap and chill. Let curds drain in refrigerator until there are no visible pockets of liquid (curds should be moist), a few minutes to about 30 minutes more. Wrap mold and cheese tightly with plastic wrap (or, if you're using a colander, transfer cheese to an airtight container). Your ricotta is ready to eat. It keeps, chilled and wrapped airtight, up to 4 days. To serve, invert mold onto a plate or just spoon cheese out of container.",

As soon as the milk mixture reaches 170\u00b0, stop stirring (whey and curds will separate at this point). Continue to cook, without stirring, until the thermometer reaches 190\u00b0. (Be sure not to stir, or curds that have formed will break apart.) Immediately remove pan from heat. (Bottom of pan may be slightly scorched.) Pour milk mixture into cheesecloth-lined colander. Drain over bowl for 5 minutes, and discard liquid (whey). Gather edges of cheesecloth together; tie securely. Hang cheesecloth bundle from kitchen faucet, and drain 12 minutes or just until whey stops dripping. Scrape ricotta into a medium bowl. Sprinkle with salt, and toss gently with a fork to combine.

Place on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet. Repeat procedure with the remaining phyllo, butter, sugar mixture, and foil cylinders. Bake at 375\u00b0 for 12 minutes or until lightly browned; cool completely on a wire rack. Carefully remove foil cylinders from phyllo shells by twisting ends of foil in opposite directions and gently pulling foil from shells.",

Repeat with the remaining tomatoes and onions, potatoes, and Parmesan. Cover the dish with aluminum foil and bake for 30 minutes.",
      "Meanwhile, wipe out the frying pan and then heat the remaining 1 tablespoon oil in it over moderate heat. Sprinkle the remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/8 teaspoon pepper over the lamb chops. Cook until browned, about 3 minutes per side. Remove the chops from the pan.",

Though our perceptions of Bordeaux are often distorted by the wildly expensive cru classe wines, many wines from the region are both affordable and delicious. Look for the appellations Bordeaux Superieur, Bourg, Blaye, and Fronsac."

      "How to Use a Dutch Oven",
      "Prepare the fire. If you have a campfire going, move any large pieces of still-burning wood to the side and level out your hot coals to fit the size of the dutch oven. If the campground doesn't allow wood fires, burn 50 charcoal briquets till they're mostly gray, 10 to 15 minutes, and spread into an even layer the size of the dutch oven.",
      "Set up the oven. For many recipes, you just set the dutch oven on top of the hot coals (\"bottom heat cooking\"). But there are times when you'll need to heat both the top and bottom of the oven. Just scrape about half the coals to the side and arrange the rest in a circle the size of the dutch oven's outer edge. Set the oven on top of the circle of coals, then pile the rest of the coals on top of the lid.",
      "Start cooking. Lift the dutch-oven lid occasionally to check the food and temperature. To decrease the heat, scrape away some fuel. To increase the heat, or to cook longer than 45 minutes, add 6 to 10 new briquets or more wood embers (from that still-burning wood you moved to the side of your firepit) every 30 minutes.",

      "Wine note: Pasta Primavera is a burst of spring. The wine that accompanies it should be, too. Sauvignon blanc is a good option since the fresh \"green\" quality mirrors vegetables perfectly. But because this is a cream-based pasta primavera, I would opt instead for a pinot blanc. Rounder and more mellow than sauvignon blanc, pinot blanc at its best soars with freshness and vivacity, and is loaded with floral and citrus character. My favorite: Robert Sinskey Pinot Blanc 2005 Los Carneros, California ($18). --Karen MacNeil"
