      "Bring the full quantity up to a boil before adding in the chicken.",
      "If the water is not hot enough it will cool too quickly and the chicken will not cook through.",
      "Addendum to Step 6 (continued): After sitting in the cooling water for 2 hours, it is okay to remove the chicken, even if the water is not thoroughly cool yet.",
      "There is no need to let it sit in tepid water for a longer period of time as this will not affect the chicken."
