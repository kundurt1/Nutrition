      "Start by thawing your turkey in the refrigerator, if frozen, for up to 3 days. If the turkey is larger than 14 lbs., it may take up to 4-5 days.",

      "Next, prepare your turkey by remove the giblets and neck from the body cavity and neck cavity of the turkey, and set aside. Trim any fat from the edge of the skin of the turkey, but try to leave as much of the skin on the turkey as you can to protect the meat from drying out during the smoking process.",
      "Rinse the turkey in cold, running water. Make sure to clean the body cavity and outside surfaces of the turkey.",
      "Separate the skin from the breast of the turkey and use your hands to make sure it comes loose. Begin at the back of the bird and move to the front, then down the sides towards the legs which allows the brine to reach the breast meat.",
      "Once this is complete, place the turkey \"head first\" into the brine mixture. Brine the turkey in the refrigerator for 12 hours or up to 24 hours.",
      "Remove the turkey from the brine and rinse it with cold water, making sure to clean the whole bird, including the outside. Let dry for 5 minutes and pat dry with a paper towel.",
      "In a small bowl, mix together the dry rub ingredients: 1 Tbs. paprika, 2 tsp. garlic powder, 1 tsp. salt, 1/4 tsp. pepper, 1 tsp. rosemary, and 1 tsp. oregano. Use your hands to distribute the dry rub on the outside of the turkey.",
      "Smoking Process: When you are ready to smoke your turkey, let your smoker reach a temperature of 225\u00b0F. Oil the grate of the smoker to make sure your turkey doesn't stick.",
      "Maintain a temperature of 225-250\u00b0F throughout the entire smoking process. Turkeys take about 40 minutes per pound to smoke, and you want the thickest part of the breast to reach 170\u00b0F.",
      "Once the turkey is removed from the smoker, it will continue to cook. Remove the turkey when a meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the breast reaches 170\u00b0F, cover with foil, and let rest for 20 minutes.",
      "Once ready to serve, slice the turkey and serve with lemon slices and fresh rosemary.",
      "TIPS: Use a wood smoker for best results. For the wood chips, we suggest hickory chips that have been soaked prior to use.",

      "First, place your beef in the freezer for one hour or so, so that it's easier to slice. After about an hour, take a sharpened knife and slice it fairly thinly, about 1/4\" slices, against the grain. Trim off any fat that you see.",
      "Next, prepare your marinade, mix it together in a bowl large enough to hold all of the sliced meat. Once ready, stir the beef into the marinade and make sure it's coated really well. Wrap it up in saran wrap, and store it in the fridge overnight.",
      "Next day, preheat your oven to 170, this is the best temperature for drying, rather than cooking, and will ensure it at least gets hot enough to kill any bacteria in the meat, rather than incubate it and make it worse.",
      "Line the bottom of your oven in tin foil, so that any drips don't make a mess of the oven. Then, lay out your beef on the oven rack as you see. It's a little tedious, but it will be worth it. Cook your beef in the oven for about 4-6 hours, depending on how good your oven works, your exact cut of meat and the slices' thickness, it's going to vary a little bit. Two very important things to keep in mind: The first, is that you must cook your jerky with the oven door held open a bit by either a crushed can or a wooden spoon, so that the air / moisture can get out. Next, about half way, you may want to flip the jerky pieces. They can be a little tricky to rebalance, but the parts touching the metal wrack won't have been exposed to the air enough to dry out. It won't be that hot in the oven, so you can stick your fingers in there alright, for the most part. But seriously, don't burn yourself. If you do, it's not my fault."
