Mince the jalapeno - so no one gets a big chunk of jalapeno when they bite into the meal. After the meat is browned, add the jalapeno, tomato and 1 can of water to rinse out tomato can. Stir well. (Make sure the liquid is adequate to cook the noodles.) Cook this mixture for about 15 minutes to get the spices well mixed with the tomatoes. Add the frozen vegetable - bring up to boil. Then add the egg noodles - cook until tender, about 7 or 8 minutes after the mixture comes to boil after adding the noodles. When noodles are cooked, cover and remove from heat. Allow the meal to sit for 5 - 10 minutes, covered and off heat. (I haven't given amounts for seasoning because that is a personal choice - season to taste. I like my meal seasoned as I said above - cover the top of the ground meat lightly with all of the spices before browning. Then as heat comes up, I break up the ground meat and mix in the spices.)."

You want a batter that is shiny and elastic and a little runny, but slightly stiff. (For instance, it should be thicker than pancake batter, but runnier than mashed potatoes. More like pudding, sort of. You'll get the hang of it, and it doesn't have to be !00% perfect.).",

      "Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the onions, reduce heat to medium, and cook, stirring occasionally with a wooden spoon, until onions are dark caramel colored, about 30 minutes. The trick is to stir the onions enough to keep them from burning, but not so often as to interrupt the browing process.",
      "While onions are slowly cooking, make the spaetzle. When the water is boiling, place the spaetzle maker across the top of the pot, add dough to the metal cup of the machine, and starting sliding the cup back and forth across grater-like flat part of the machine. Gravity will pull the slightly runny dough through the holes at the bottom of the cup, and eventually little drops of dangling dough will fall into the water. These are the spaetzle. Continue sliding the cup until all the dough has emptied. Let the spaetzle cook for a few moments. When the batch is floating on the surface, scoop them out with a slotted spoon, place in a baking dish, and set aside. Repeat the process until all the dough is used.",
      "(Note: if you don't have a spaetzle maker, roll out small amounts of the dough on a cutting board until about 1/4-inch thick. Then use a knife to cut into pieces about 1/4-inch wide by 1-inch long -- about the size of elbow macaroni, were it straight. Scrape the pieces into the boiling water.).",

      "My Note: What others have added, mustard, pickles, bacon, radishes, etc. Because everyone's tastes vary, as mentioned in the description, I encourage you to add \"additional ingredients\" to make this recipe \"your own\". Don't be afraid to experiment, that's what makes cooking fun. When adding bacon or chopped dill pickles, you may want to reduce the salt called for in the recipe. To make this quickly - first start cooking the eggs - then take out the large bowl that you will be using to serve - I peel and dice the potatoes and rinsed them in that bowl to get out starch - put potatoes in cold water and bring to boil - then lower heat to a slow boil and cook approximately 10 to 15 minute Your eggs will probably be finised by then so cool them down with cold water. Then mix all the ingredients for dressing in the bowl - add the chopped eggs and by then your potatoes are probably ready to add. Very little clean up and no waiting time for things to be done - I added a tablespoon of ground mustard to dressing and only used 2 eggs but that is just a preference. I thought this turned out great and it was fast. The inlaws/outlaws? (in Sweden) are in love with this and have asked for the recipe! Have Fun and Happy Cooking!"

      "Note: If you do not have powdered milk, you can heat 2 cups of milk, or 1 cup milk & 1 cup water; whichever you prefer, in a small saucepan to 120 degrees on a candy thermometer and omit the 2 cups of water. Also, when making 100% whole wheat bread, you may have to adjust the amount of wheat flour if the weather is too humid or dry. Adding to much wheat flour can make the bread dry. If you do not like the strong flavor of 100% wheat bread then you can replace some of the flour with bread flour and it will be lighter in texture, but I prefer the 100% flavor of whole wheat bread.",
      "Grease a large mixing bowl and set aside. In another large mixing bowl, add the yeast, salt, sugar or honey, oil, and hot water. With a mixer, mix all those ingredients for 2 minutes. Add 2 cups of wheat flour and the powdered milk. Mix for another 2 minutes. With a wooden spoon, stir in the 3 cups of whole wheat flour. Remove the dough from the bowl out onto a lightly floured counter top or table. Knead the dough for 10 minutes until smooth and elastic. You may need to sprinkle a little flour on your dough or counter top a couple of times if it is too sticky, but not too much. Take dough and place it in the greased bowl; flip the dough over so greased side is up. Cover with a piece of plastic wrap; don't tighten it down, just lay it over the bowl loosely....or you can use a small t-towel too. The plastic helps it from drying out to much. Let it rise until double in a warm place. Like; a sunny window or on a warm clothes dryer that is running. It can rise as quickly as 45 minutes in those warm places. Otherwise, it can take up to 1 hour to 1 1/2 hours depending on the temperature in your house. To test to see if the dough has doubled, press the dough on the top with the tips of your two fingers, lightly and quickly about 1/2 inch into the dough. If the impression stays, the dough is doubled and is ready. If the indent disappears quickly, it needs a little more time; cover and let rise a bit longer. ( 100% wheat bread does not get the height like white bread does).",
      "Lightly grease a cookie sheet with shortening, or you can line with parchment paper. After the dough has risen, dump the dough from the bowl onto a clean table or counter. Pull about 14 pieces of dough off the dough, and shape them into balls by tucking the ends under...kind of like pinching it all towards the center on the underside of the roll. Place shaped rolls onto the greased cookie sheet(s) about 2 inches apart. Cover with towel; let rise in a warm place for about 30 minutes.",
      "Preheat oven to 325 degrees. Bake 1 cookie sheet at a time, and bake for 25-30 minutes. They should be golden brown on top. Remove from oven. Take a wet paper towel, and it can be really good and wet, and wipe off the tops of the baked rolls. This does not make your bread soggy. (trust me! ) It keeps the bread crust soft! But...You can avoid this step if you want. Remove rolls from cookie sheet to racks to cool. Wait at least 5 minutes (if you can) before splitting a roll open and smearing it with butter before eating. This gives the bread a few minutes to set. If there is any left over, cool the rolls completely, and store in a airtight container or put into freezer bags and freeze for future eating. You can then microwave 1 frozen roll for 30 seconds when you are ready for another taste of homemade bread.",
      "To bake bread in a loaf pan: You can use 2 loaf pans, your choice, but since the 100% whole wheat bread is denser and slightly heavier than white, it does not rise as high in a loaf pan as white bread. So I bake it in a single loaf pan to get a nice looking loaf of bread.",
      "Ok,that being said....Same ingredients, same procedure. Except, after the first rising, remove dough from bowl and flatten it into a greased loaf pan for the final rising. Cover with a towel and let it rise for about 45 minutes in a warm place. Preheat oven to 350 degrees (bake in a hotter oven than for the rolls) Bake for about 40-50 minutes. Remove from oven. Wipe down bread with a wet paper towel. Remove from pan and cool on a wire rack. And....if you insist on cutting a slice of bread before it is cool, use a electric knife or a large serrated bread knife so the loaf don't get squashed down when you are cutting it. :o)."

To weigh down the assembled strata, two 1-pound boxes of brown or powdered sugar, laid side by side over the plastic-covered surface, make ideal weights.

A little bright red paprika on this layer would also add some additional color. Enjoy!",
