Stir constantly and allow the onions to cook until mahogany in color, about 10 minutes; if onions are browning too quickly, reduce to medium heat. Add the short ribs back to the pot along with the reserved wine marinade. Allow the wine to come to a boil before reducing the heat to a simmer, skimming foam and fat from the surface of the liquid. After simmering for several minutes, add remaining ingredients and allow to simmer uncovered until the meat is fork tender and nearly falling off the bone, roughly 5 hours.",

      "Mushroom seasoning salt brings a very distinct, earthy flavor to the sauce. You can find it at gourmet specialty stores or in most Korean markets.",
      "Frying onions is quite easy. You have to chop the onion first, and then heat about 1 inch of canola oil in a small skillet. Fry the onion in the hot oil, stirring frequently to prevent the onion from burning until the color is evenly golden brown. Drain the oil on paper towels. Set aside, if you want to make much more at once, you can do it and then keep in a box to use for next time.",
      "Pickles Daikon and Carrot is great for this salad, so if you have time, please make those pickles ready, you can use them for many different kind of foods.",
      "Daikon (white radish) is an Asian turnip that looks like a large white carrot. This root is perfect for making broth for the natural sweetness it provides. Discard the root when the broth is ready.",
      "Vietnamese mint has a very different flavor from regular mint, the taste is much better too. It also has darker vein markings on the leaves.",
      "Rau ram and ngo gai are Vietnamese coriander leaves, you can find them at the Asian market very easy in Vietnamese grocery store.",
      "To prevent the herbs from darkening, chop them at the very last minute, toss them into the salad and serve immediately.",
      "Now you have everything you need, are you sure? Okay! Let's start!",
      "Preparing the chicken: Pour 2 litres of water into a pot and boil then add chicken breasts, 3 tablespoons salt, ginger, white onion, if you could add anymore vegetables which have unami flavor like carrot, leeks, turnips etc...that would be perfect (don't worry if you don't have) cook until the chickens are well done.",
      "Remove the whole chickens from the pot. Let them cool a bit until you can handle them without discomfort and then sliced into thin 5 cm lengths.",
      "To avoid chicken meat of the fishy taste, wash with warm water, salt and then boil the water before add chicken into the pot.",
      "Salad sauce: In a bowl, combine: Chili paste: 1 tablespoon (option). Horn pepper or red hot chilli scrushed (to have red color for the sauce). 4 tablespoons chunk rock sugar. 1 tablespoons rice wine vinegar. Lime juice: 4 tablespoons. Fish sauce: 6 tablespoons. 3 Garlic clove finely minced. Hot water: 2 cups. Mix well, and then test if the salinity, light, sour, sweet, taste characteristics are stable and moderate.",
      "This is not easy to make this sauce. Even with local people.",
      "Here i will tell you some ways to make a perfect one.",
      "1) The best way to do is make a glass of lemonade with sweet taste, add minced garlic, red hot chilli scrushed mixed into the lemonade. Then slowly pour the fish sauce in the salad sauce also test the taste at the same time until it tasted sweet, bitterness, sour, salty.",
      "2) You may need follow this second way if this is the first time you make the salad sauce ( 30gr sour juice ( lemon, vinegar), 30gr sugar, 30gr fish sauce, 100gr warm water) galic minced, red hot chilli scrushed.",
      "If you don't have vinegar, just add more lemon juice.",
      "It will be more simple for you at the next time, when you got used to it, but need to remember an important tip that always put galic minced, red hot chilli scrushed in the lemonade first, then pour fish sauce on later. So after you are done, galic, chilli will float on and have a beautiful look. If you put the galic minced, red hot chilli scrushed on first, then pour vinegar, lemonade into later? The garlic and chilli will sink to the bottom.",
      "Dosage depends on individual taste, try to adjust it appropriate as your own taste. The way you feel the best.",

      "1. First you need to salt your fresh salmon fillet to extract some of the moisture. This will enable it to take on the smoky flavor more easily and cook safely. Cover the base of a dish with about 1cm of salt and place the fillet skin side down on the salt. Sprinkle some dry dill onto the fillet followed by a generous amount of salt making sure to cover the fish completely with more salt on the thicker parts. Leave it in a cool place for 2-3 hours.",
      "2. Remove the fish from the now damp salt and wash it thoroughly in cold fresh water.",
      "3. Place the fillet on a drying rack for at least an hour and preferably more.",
      "4. Fill your smoker with beech, oak or fruit wood sawdust having soaked a hand full of the sawdust in Whiskey (don't use your best Hebredean single malt for this).",
      "5. Place your fillet in the smoker and gently smoke for 12 hours. A brief hot smoke (about 60-80 degrees) of about 30 minutes followed by a long cold smoke (under 30 degrees C) works well. I used an insulated smoker like this one http://www.outdoorcook.co.uk/collections/smokers/products/professional-meat-fish-smoker , but there are loads of different types around and you may even be able to use your BBQ although insulation is important to maintain lower temperatures and an electric element or gas makes for easier use.",
      "6. Remove the fillet and check it is cooked through before serving. It can be eaten in leafy salads, with boiled new potatoes, on bread, with pasta and all it needs is a bit of Lemon juice to bring it alive!",

      "Peel potatoes and cut into half-dollar size slices 1/4\" thick or so. If the potato is large, cut it in two lengthwise then slice. Place the slices into a large bowl filled with cold water, keeping the potatoes submerged to prevent browning.",
      "Cook bacon, saving all of the drippings. Crumble or chop bacon and place into a bowl, covering bacon and drippings and set aside. Yes, I said save the drippings. All will be revealed to those who are patient and/or hungry. Tip: Use the Alton Brown method of oven-baking the bacon. It's less messy, the bacon cooks more evenly and it conserves more of the drippings for later. Don't know what the Alton Brown method is? Google it.",
      "While bacon is cooking, boil eggs until very hard, 15-20 minutes after the water reaches a boil. Shell and chop coarsely. Cover and set aside.",
      "While eggs are boiling, chop onion into medium pieces. Place in a colander and rinse under hot water for a minute or so to remove the bitter compounds.",
      "Put a large stock pot (12 quart at least) half-filled with water on to boil. (Tip: fill pot with hot tap water - it will cut the boil time considerably) When it reaches a full rolling boil, drain the potato slices and *slowly* dump them into the pot. Cook until just done - soft-ish but still firm enough they won't fall apart when stirred. Al dente, if you will, were such a term applicable to potatoes. Drain.",
      "Keep in mind the potatoes will continue too cook in the retained heat for several minutes after taken off the boil. Try to coordinate the other steps to all be ready as sson as the potatoes are done.",
      "While potatoes are boiling, quickly combine the bacon crumbles, onion and eggs in a large bowl. In a 4 quart saucepan, heat the reserved bacon drippings (there should be about one cup) on low and when warm add the flour until smooth and all the lumps are gone. Add the sugar and whisk in the vinegar. Heat over medium slowly, gradually increasing the temperature to medium high, until the sauce has thickened to thin mayonnaise consistency. Remove from heat and cover.",
      "After the potatoes are drained, put them back into the stock pot (you'll need the room). Add the bacon-egg-onion mix and stir gently until reasonably well combined. Pour the sauce over and stir gently until well-combined, taking care not to damage the potato slices too much. The egg yolk will emulsify into the sauce and create a mayonnaise right in the pot.",
      "Making sure your cardiologist is standing by, serve warm aside with any German food - Bratwurst, knockwurst, schnitzel, sauerbraten, with good strong beer. My wife says this potato salad is a meal in its own right. I believe her."

Put them and the broth back into the pot you cooked the chicken in.) Season the remaining broth with butter and salt and pepper to taste. Bring to a boil and cook the dumplings.",

      "For the pie shell: Mix flour, salt and sugar in food processor fitted with steel blade. Scatter butter pieces over flour mixture, tossing to coat butter with a little of the flour. Cut butter into flour with five 1 second pulses. Add shortening; continue cutting in until flour is pale yellow and resembles coarse cornmeal with butter bits no larger than a small pea, about four more 1-second pulses. Turn mixture into medium bowl sprinkle 3 tablespoons cold water over mixture. Using rubber spatula, fold water into mixture; press down on dough mixture with broad side of spatula until dough sticks together. If dough will not come together, add up to 1 tablespoon more cold water. Shape dough into ball, then flatten into 4-inch-wide disk. Dust lightly with flour, wrap in plastic, and refrigerate for 30 minutes before rolling. Generously sprinkle work area with 2 tablespoons graham cracker crumbs. Place dough on work area scatter a few more crumbs over dough. Roll dough from center to edges, turning it into a 9-inch disk, rotating a quarter turn after each stroke and sprinkling additional crumbs underneath and on top as necessary to coat heavily. Flip dough over and continue to roll, but not rotate, to form a 13-inch disk slightly less than 1/8-inch thick. Fold dough into quarters; place dough point in center of 9-inch Pyrex pie pan. Unfold to cover pan completely, letting excess dough drape over pan lip. To fit dough to pan, lift edge of dough with one hand and press dough in pan bottom with other hand; repeat process around circumferences of pan to ensure dough fits properly and is not stretched. Trim all around, 1/2-inch past lip of pan. Tuck 1/2 inch of overhanging dough under so folded edge is flush with lip of pan; press to seal. Press thumb and index finger about 1/2-inch apart against outside edge of dough, then use index finger or knuckle of other hand to poke a dent on inside edge of dough through opening created by the other fingers. Repeat to flute around perimeter of pie shell. Refrigerate until firm, about 30 minutes. Use fork to prick shell at 1/2-inch intervals; press a doubled 12-inch square of aluminum foil into pie shell; prick again and refrigerate at least 30 minutes.",
      "Adjust oven rack to lowest position, heat oven to 400 degrees. Bake, checking occasionally for ballooning, until crust is firmly set, about 15 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees, remove foil, and continue to bake until crust is crisp and rich brown in color, about 10 minutes longer.",
      "For the filling: Mix sugar, cornstarch, salt, and water in a large, nonreactive saucepan. Bring mixture to simmer over medium heat, whisking occasionally at beginning of the process and more frequently as mixture begins to thicken. When mixture starts to simmer and turn translucent, whisk in egg yolks, two at a time. Whisk in zest, then lemon juice, and finally butter. Bring mixture to a brisk simmer, whisking constantly. Remove from heat, place plastic wrap directly on surface of filling to keep hot and prevent skin from forming.",
      "For the meringue: Mix cornstarch with 1/3 cup water in small saucepan; bring to simmer, whisking occasionally at beginning and more frequently as mixture thickens. When mixture starts to simmer and turn translucent, remove from heat. Let cool while beating egg whites.",
      "Heat oven to 325 degrees. Mix cream of tartar and sugar together. Beat egg whites and vanilla until frothy. Beat in sugar mixture, 1 tablespoon at a time; until sugar is incorporated and mixture forms soft peaks. Add cornstarch mixture, 1 tablespoon at a time; continue to beat meringue to stiff peaks. Remove plastic from filling and return to very low heat during last minute or so of beating meringue (to ensure filling is hot) pour filling into pie shell. Using a rubber spatula, immediately distribute meringue evenly around edge then center of pie to keep it from sinking into filling. Make sure meringue attaches to pie crust to prevent shrinking. Use spoon to create peaks all over meringue. Bake pie until meringue is golden brown, about 20 minutes. Transfer to wire rack and cool to room temperature serve.",
      "Note:Sprinkle an 18-inch work area with 2 tablespoons graham cracker crumbs; place the dough disk in the center. Scatter a few more crumbs over the disk top. Roll the dough from the center to the edges to form a 9-inch disk, rotating it a quarter turn after each stroke and sprinkling additional crumbs underneath and on top to heavily coat the dough. Distribute the meringue evenly around the edge then the center of the pie. Use a rubber spatula to spread the meringue, making sure the meringue attaches to the pie."
