      "In a large bowl, use your hands to mix together the potatoes, chopped sauerkraut, flour, eggs, and salt until well combined. Mind that the sauerkraut is well mixed in, so you don't end up with big chunks of it in the latkes. If the mixture is too moist-it should be easy to form into latkes-gradually add more flour.",
      "Fill a large, heavy saute pan with about 1/3 inch (7.5 mm) of sunflower oil and place over medium-high heat. Take 2 to 3 tablespoons of the potato-sauerkraut mixture into your fingers and form it into a thin, small pancake-shaped latke. Mind that the latkes have to be thin enough to get crispy when fried. (You can also add balls of the mixture directly to the hot oil and push them down with a spatula.) Repeat with the remaining latke mixture. Working in batches, fry the latkes for 1 1/2 to 3 minutes per side or until golden brown and crisp. Lower the heat if they brown too quickly. Transfer to paper towels to drain, and repeat with the remaining latkes, adding more oil if necessary. Serve or keep the fried latkes in a warm oven until you finish the last batch. This makes about 15 latkes.",

A terrific choice is Muscat Beaumes-de-Venise from Jaboulet, France. The 2001 is about $16 for a 375-milliliter half-bottle. Just a small glass of this wonderfully opulent wine will make the baked apples taste like a three-star dessert course. -Karen McNeil"

The kick of the red curry paste and cilantro, plus the exotic thick creaminess of the coconut milk, need a refreshing wine that has more weight and power than a white. Try any number of roses from California. One of my favorites: Saxon Brown Flora Ranch Rose 2006 from Chalk Hill ($20). -Karen MacNeil"

      "). If you don't have three pans, it's okay to bake the cakes in stages; the batter will keep at room temperature until needed. Sift the all-purpose flour and almond flour together in a bowl, then whisk thoroughly to combine, at least 1 minute. Under-mixing the flours can produce a cake with a splotchy crust and uneven crumb.",
      "In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine sugar, baking powder, salt, and butter. Mix on low speed to roughly incorporate, increase speed to medium. Beat until fluffy, pale, and light, about 8 minutes. About halfway through, pause to scrape the bowl and beater with a flexible spatula.",
      "With the mixer still running, add the eggs one at a time, letting each fully incorporate before adding the next, followed by the vanilla extract, almond extract, and rose water (if using). Reduce speed to low and sprinkle in about 1/3 of the prepared almond-flour, then drizzle in 1/3 of the milk. Repeat with remaining flour and milk, working in thirds as before.",
      "Scrape the bowl and beater with a flexible spatula, and resume mixing on medium speed for about 3 seconds to ensure everything is well combined. The batter should look creamy and thick, registering between 65 and 68\u00b0F (18 and 20\u00b0C) on a digital thermometer. (Significant deviation indicates ingredients were too warm or too cold, which can lead to textural problems with the cake.)",
      "Fold batter once or twice from the bottom up with a flexible spatula, then divide evenly between prepared cake pans (about 20 ounces/565g per pan). Stagger pans together on the oven rack, and bake until puffed, firm, and beginning to brown around the edges, but relatively pale over all, about 35 minutes. If your oven has very uneven heat, pause to rotate the pans after about 20 minutes. Alternatively, bake two layers at once and finish the third when they're done.",
      "Cool cakes directly in their pans for 1 hour, then run a butter knife around the edges to loosen. Invert onto a wire rack, peel off the parchment, and return cakes right-side-up (covered in plastic, the cakes can be left at room temperature for a few hours). Prepare your frosting of choice.",
      "Level cakes with a serrated knife (full directions",

If you like, a waxed cardboard cake round can first be placed underneath, secured to the turntable with a scrap of damp paper towel. Top with exactly 1 cup buttercream, using an offset spatula to spread it evenly from edge to edge. Repeat with the second and third layers, then cover the sides of the cake with another cup of buttercream, spreading it as smoothly as you can (tutorial",
      "). Refrigerate cake until the buttercream hardens, about 30 minutes.",
      "Rewhip remaining buttercream to restore its creamy consistency, then use to finish and decorate the chilled cake as desired. If you like, garnish with toasted, sliced or slivered almonds. To serve, bring cake to an internal temperature no cooler than 70\u00b0F (21\u00b0C) and cut into portions with a chef's knife, wiping or rinsing the blade clean between each slice. Cover the exposed edges with leftover buttercream to keep the remaining cake moist. Under a cake dome, the cake will keep for 3 days at cool room temperature."

To do it, lift the paella pan carefully off the grill and set either wadded-up aluminum foil or, for an even higher lift, bricks, on the grill grate (it helps to have another person aid you during this step).",
      "Set the paella pan back on the grill and continue cooking until the rice is just al dente and the liquid has fully been absorbed, about 8 minutes longer; turn the pork once during this time to heat them through on both sides. If the liquid cooks off and the rice isn't done enough, add more boiling-hot stock or water in small additions until the rice reaches the desired doneness. You can also use a spoon to carefully dig into the paella and check the bottom of the pan to make sure nothing is burning.",

Fold the overhanging plastic wrap over the top of the cake, covering completely, and then gently press down on the plastic to distribute the cream evenly (don't use too much pressure). Refrigerate for at least four hours or overnight.",
      "When you are ready to finish the cake, release and lift off the pan sides and peel away the plastic wrap. Using a wide metal spatula, transfer the cake to a serving plate, if using, or leave it on the cake pan base.",
      "To make the topping, whip the topping cream until thickened. Add the sugar and whip until the cream holds soft peaks. Using the offset spatula, frost the top of the cake. The cake can be served immediately or kept cold in the refrigerator until ready to serve. It will keep for up to three days.",
      "Preheat the oven to 325\u00b0F. Line the bottom of a 10-inch springform pan with 3-inch sides with parchment paper cut to fit exactly. Do not grease the sides of the pan.",
      "Sift together the flour and baking powder in a large mixing bowl. Add 1 1/4 cups of the sugar and the salt and whisk to combine. In a small bowl, whisk together the oil, egg yolks, water, vanilla, and lemon zest. Make a well in the flour, add the yolk mixture, and then whisk thoroughly and quickly for about 1 minute, until very smooth.",
      "Place the egg whites in a large mixing bowl. Using a mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, beat on medium speed until frothy. Add the cream of tartar or lemon juice and beat on medium-high speed until the whites hold soft peaks. Slowly add the remaining 1/4 cup sugar and beat on medium-high speed until the whites hold firm, shiny peaks. Using a rubber spatula, scoop about 1/3 of the whites into the yolk mixture and fold in gently to lighten the batter. Gently fold in the remaining whites just until combined.",
      "Pour the batter into the prepared pan, smoothing the top with an offset spatula if necessary. Bake until a cake tester inserted into the center comes out clean, 45 to 55 minutes. Let cool in the pan (the sides of the pan will help hold the structure of the cake as it cools) on a wire rack. To unmold, run a small, thin knife around the sides of the pan to loosen the cake and then release and lift off the pan sides. Invert the cake, peel off the parchment, and use as directed. The cake will keep, well wrapped, in the refrigerator for up to four days or in the freezer for up to one month.",
      "For the summer fruit Bavarian, you will need to split this cake into two even layers. Use a long, serrated bread knife.",
      "Have a bowl ready for cooling the pastry cream. Set a fine-mesh sieve atop it.",
      "Pour the milk into a heavy saucepan. Split the vanilla bean in half lengthwise and scrape the seeds from the pod halves into the milk. Add the salt, turn the heat to medium-high, and bring to just under a boil, stirring occasionally and making sure that the milk solids are not sticking to the bottom of the pan.",
      "Meanwhile, in a mixing bowl whisk together the cornstarch and sugar. Add the eggs and whisk until smooth.",
      "When the milk is ready, turn off the heat and slowly ladle about one-third of the hot milk into the egg mixture, whisking constantly. Pour the egg-milk mixture back into the hot milk, turn the heat to medium, and continue whisking until the custard is as thick as lightly whipped cream, about 2 minutes. In order for the cornstarch to cook and thicken fully, the mixture must come just to the boiling point. You want to see a few slow bubbles. However, if the cream is allowed to boil vigorously, you will curdle the pastry cream. Remove from the heat and immediately pour through the sieve into the bowl. (If the custard stays in the hot pot, it will continue to cook.) Let cool for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally to release the heat and prevent a skin from forming on top.",
      "Cut the butter into 1 tablespoon pieces. When the pastry cream is ready (it should be about 140 degrees), whisk the butter into the pastry cream 1 tablespoon at a time, always whisking until smooth before adding the next tablespoon.",
      "To cool the cream, cover the bowl with plastic wrap, pressing the wrap directly onto the top of the cream to prevent skin formation. Refrigerate. Pastry cream will keep, well covered, in the refrigerator for up to five days."

Bake for another 20-25 minutes, until the filling starts to bubble all over. Remove the pie from the oven and allow to cool.",

Bring the sugar mixture to a boil and continue to cook until it reaches 235\u00b0, frequently washing down the sides of the pot with a brush dipped in water. As the sugar approaches the desired temperature, begin beating the eggs so they are foamy but still quite wet. Slowly drizzle the sugar into the bowl of the mixer as it runs on low to medium speed, then increase the speed and whisk until the meringue holds firm peaks, about 4 minutes.",

Place the pie under the broiler in the oven and watch it carefully as the meringue's surface caramelizes and turns golden brown. This will happen quickly, so be sure to watch it carefully and pull it out when it has reached your desired level of darkness. Serve immediately."

Cook until salmon is 115 to 120\u00b0F in the center, about 20 minutes. (If you don't have a thermometer, salmon should flake easily when done.) Drain salmon, discard aromatics, and let cool in refrigerator.",

      "When the apricots are cool enough to handle, open each one and spoon in a rounded tablespoon or more of the yogurt, pressing the apricot halves around it to hold it in place. (The apricots should not be closed up over the yogurt, however. They should look like an old-fashioned whoopie pie, with the yogurt oozing out.) Arrange the apricots on a serving dish and spoon some of the reserved syrup over each one. Garnish with chopped pistachios.",
      "For the Labneh: Use a colander lined with a triple layer of cheesecloth. Pour a quart of pure yogurt into the cheesecloth and set the colander in the sink or in a bowl to catch the whey. Set a plate or a piece of plastic wrap or aluminum foil lightly over the top to keep the dust off and leave for up to 24 hours. The yogurt just gets thicker as it keeps on dripping. When it's the thickness you desire, scrape it into a refrigerator container, cover it, and refrigerate it. It will keep for 10 days or more. Any whey that drifts to the top can be poured off before using."

Whisk the egg yolks and fold them into the meringue, then fold in the cake flour, taking care not to deflate the batter. Fold in the cooled, melted butter. Immediately pour the batter onto the parchment-lined pan and spread it evenly with a large offset spatula. Bake the sponge for approximately 5-7 minutes, or until it is browned and springs back to the touch. Do not over-bake, or the sponge will be too stiff to roll. Allow the cake to cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then run a knife along the edges, place another piece of parchment on top and an inverted jelly roll pan atop the parchment, and flip the cake onto the inverted pan. Carefully peel off the parchment paper, and make the roulade as soon as the cake is cool to prevent hardening.",

Spread an even layer of pastry cream over the entire cake (between 1/8 and 1/4 inch thick) using an offset spatula. Sprinkle small amounts of the cranberry compote over the surface. Using the parchment underneath to stabilize, begin rolling the cake into the roulade the long way, as you would a carpet, resting the roll on the seam. Cut the cake on an angle 1/3 way up the roulade using a serrated knife, then cut a round off of the bottom of the small piece. Arrange the bigger part of the roulade on a serving plate, and cover with a thick layer of buttercream. Arrange the smaller pieces so they look like branches coming out of the big roulade, then frost the smaller pieces with buttercream. Draw patterns in the buttercream to resemble bark, and decorate the cake as you see fit. The cake can be stored in the fridge until serving, but do not refrigerate the meringues or they will melt."

When it is smooth and no caramel lumps remain, add the salt and toasted coconut and stir with a wooden spoon (it will be a bit of a workout) until the coconut is fully coated. Remove from heat.",
      "Using a small offset spatula or even a spoon, gently spread 2-3 teaspoons of the caramel-coconut mixture on top of each cookie.

      "While the topping is setting on the cookies, prepare your chocolate for coating the bottom of the cookies and finishing the tops. In a large microwave-safe bowl, heat the chocolate in 30-second intervals, stirring after each interval, until smooth and melted (you can also do this over the stovetop, if you feel like washing out that coconut-coated medium saucepan you used for the topping).",
      "Dip the bottom of each cookie in the melted chocolate and then place on a piece of waxed paper or parchment paper. Once all of the cookie-bottoms have been dunked, transfer the remaining chocolate to a small piping bag, and pipe stripes across the top of the cookies. Or if that seems too hard, simply spoon a dollop of chocolate on top of each cookie. (Tip: a dollop of peanut butter on top, while not traditional, tastes great too!)",
