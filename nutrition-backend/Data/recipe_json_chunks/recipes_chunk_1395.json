    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "NOTE: The flavour of the cake is as good as the quality of the eggs and honey that you use (well, eggs and honey being almost the only 2 ingredients in it...). So none of that bear-bottle stuff, please. Use a pure, floral, dark and fragrant honey that tastes and smells like the flowers it came from. The honey itself will provide enough sweetness for a mildly sweet cake, but for people who wants more sweetness, the optional powdered sugar will do the job. Besides good quality, it's also important to use room-temperature eggs. The batter should be slightly warm, not cold, before going into the oven. Then, last but not least, even though the flour may seem to take insignificant ratio in the batter, it's well advised to use cake/low-protein flour VS all-purpose. In my experience, it takes some considerable whisking in order to completely incorporate the flour into the batter without any lumps, and you don't want the excess gluten in all-purpose flour to ruin the party.",
      "NOTE 2: The batter will make a taller 6? cake, or a shallower 7? cake. I haven't tried using rectangular loaf-pan but perhaps that'll work, too. Whatever pan you're using, the key to success is: butter and flour the interior of the pan really really, really well. Because this cake'll stick. It'll even stick to parchment paper! So if you want to lay a circle-sheet of parchment paper on the bottom of the cake-pan for easy transferring (like I did), butter and flour that parchment as well!",
      "TO MAKE THE CAKE: Preheat the oven on 355\u00b0F/180\u00b0C.\r\n\r\nIn a stand-mixer bowl with a whisk-attachment (or large bowl with handheld mixer), whisk large egg yolks, large eggs and powdered sugar (optional) just until combined, then pause. Heat up honey in a pot over medium-low heat until it starts to simmer, then continue to let it bubble and simmer for 2 minutes (to heat up the custard and also to reduce the moisture-level slightly). Turn the stand-mixer back on medium-high speed, then slowly pour the hot honey from the side of the bowl into the eggs with the machine running. Keep whisking the eggs and honey mixture on medium-high speed until the it becomes pale and thick, almost doubled in size. The correct texture of the batter is important. You should whisk just until the batter starts to leave obvious \"ribbons\" behind the whisk. Now, tap the bowl on the counter and use a spatula to fold the batter a few times to get rid of large air-bubbles. Sift the cake flour right into the bowl, then whisk on low-speed until the flour is completely and smoothly incorporated (scrape the bottom of the bowl if need be).",
      "Butter and flour the interior of the cake-pan then dust off excess flour. Pour the batter into the pan, then gently tap it a few times again to eliminate large air-bubbles. Bake in the oven on the middle rack for 15 ~ 16 min. Even 1 minute will make a big difference (as some people like it runnier than others, see below)! And since every oven is sort of different, you'll need to judge the baking-time accordingly. How I check is I gently shake the pan, and the center of the cake should wobble! If it doesn't, it's already over-baked.",
      "Let the cake cool inside the pan on a cooling-rack for at least 30 min. The cake will be puffy at first then of course it'll deflate. Good. As it should.\r\n\r\nThis cake is great while it's slightly warm, or at room-temperature, or believe it, even when it's cold (perhaps better...)!"

Add several large pinches of salt. Set over a medium flame. (Cooking the pasta this way yields much starchier water, which'll help thicken our sauce later.)",
      "While the pasta water heats, brown the sausage: In a separate large pot (big enough to hold all of the pasta, eventually), heat 2 tablespoons olive oil over a medium-high flame until very hot and glistening. Add the uncased sausage and brown thoroughly on one side without jostling, about 3 to 4 minutes. Use a slotted or wooden spoon to break the sausage into small, bite-sized pieces as you flip to brown its other side thoroughly. Once fully browned and cooked through, use a slotted spoon to move the sausage to a separate plate off heat.",
      "Check on your pasta. When the water has come to a boil, you want to let it go for about 2 to 3 minutes, until the noodles are pliable but still quite al dente (you'll be cooking them for another 2 minutes later, in the sauce, and letting them hang out in the hot water in the meantime, which will cook them more). Turn off the heat.",
      "Meanwhile, back in the big pot, drain about half of the sausage fat and oil, then add another 2 tablespoons of olive oil over a medium-low flame. (This will give the final dish a subtle-but not overwhelming-sausage flavor.) Don't worry about any straggler fennel seeds that have fallen out of the sausage pieces, into the oil. Add the garlic and saute about 3 minutes, until fragrant and just starting to toast. Add the red chili flakes and saute another 30 seconds. Use a measuring cup to transfer 2 1/4 cups of the starchy pasta cooking water from the skillet to the pot of garlic and red chili flakes. Scrape up any browned bits from the bottom of the pot and turn heat to medium-high to bring the water to a rolling simmer. Reduce by about one-half, which will take roughly 4 to 5 minutes. Turn the flame down to low.",
      "Then, using tongs or two slotted spoons (or, if you're me, some precarious combination of forks), transfer over the spaghetti from the skillet of water into the pot with the reduced sauce. Add the grated Parmesan, parsley, sausage pieces, and salt. Toss together over the low flame until the cheese melts and an emulsified sauce coats all of the noodles. Taste and add more salt if needed. Serve immediately while hot, garnished with more grated Parmesan and chopped parsley."

Your bread is done when it has an internal temperature of 190 degrees F. To get your bread extra golden brown, place it on the top rack of your oven during the last 5 to 10 minutes of bake time. On the other hand, if it is browning too quickly, tent with foil.\r\n\r\nCool loaves or rolls on a cooling rack. Enjoy with butter, honey, or fresh jam."

Instead, look for a crispy top that's just starting to crack. Firm slightly-browned edges. And when you press on the center, you don't want it to feel really soft. Don't stress. You can always throw it back in later. Just know that once it's cool, it will firm up quite a bit. And once frozen, it is dreamy in all forms.",
      "Remove from the oven. Cool completely before removing from the pan. The blondie block should pop right out (either pull out by parchment/alumninum foil or if in a greased pan, just invert onto a cutting board and carefully flip it back over). Cut into desired portion sizes. These keep for a few days at room temperature in an airtight container. Or you can freeze them for a few months."

Carve it into a fan with your sharpest knife, keeping it attached at one end. Drop it into the soup. Bring to a nice, gentle simmer. Let simmer for 15 minutes or so to concentrate some flavors.

Place tartlets on jelly-roll pans (in batches) and place in hot oven for about 4 or 5 minutes until melted and bubbly. Remove from oven, top each tartlet with a small spoonful of mushroom mixture. Return to oven and warm another two minutes or so in oven, loosely covered with foil to prevent drying out. Garnish each with a pinch of minced parsley if you are not using the wine jelly. Arrange on serving tray. Serve hot."

      "When ready to bake, preheat the oven to 375 degrees and cover a baking sheet with parchment paper. Place half of the dough on a piece of lightly floured parchment paper, sprinkle some flour over it and then place another piece of parchment paper on top. Use a rolling pin to gently roll out the dough, spreading it evenly about 1/4\" thick. Remove the top piece of parchment paper and cut out circles with a round, 3\" cookie cutter. With a smaller cookie cutter, make a circular indention in the middle of each cookie, without cutting all the way through the dough (there should be about a 1/4\" space between the indentation and the edge). Press the edges of each cookie with a fork as if marking the edges of a pie. Repeat the process with the remaining dough and roll it out again making as many cookies as possible.",

With your hands, rub the pumpkin seeds between your fingers and thumbs to try to release their skins. The skins will float in the water. Carefully pour out the water, cover again with clean water and drain again. With a slotted spatula, place the pumpkin seeds on a clean kitchen towel, rubbing them so the remaining skins come entirely off. Place the seeds in a bowl, cover them with water, rinse and place them on a towel to dry.",

Cook, keeping a close eye on it, until the sugar has completely melted into the water and appears to be a happily bubbling syrup (which should take anywhere from 8 to 10 minutes). Add the ground pumpkin seeds or almonds and stir well, creating a thick paste. Let the mixture cook for another 3 to 4 minutes-it will thicken and become even more pasty. Turn off the heat, pour in the milk and stir well. It should be thick yet shiny and liquid. Remove the mixture from the heat and let it cool slightly. Use it to top the cookies but before it hardens. If it does harden, just heat the mixture over low heat with a tablespoon of water until it becomes runny again.",
      "Once the cookies are no longer warm to the touch, add the cooled candied pumpkin seed or almond glaze on top with a spoon. 1 to 1 1/2 teaspoons of glaze is more than enough; it spreads as it settles."

Remove from the oven, leave to cool slightly and then remove the parchment and baking beans. The edges of the flan will have shrunk slightly, but now you can trim them neatly to the height of the flan dish with a sharp knife.",

Put a couple of tablespoons of the tomato sauce in the base of the tart and spread evenly with the back of a spoon. Scatter the chargrilled aubergine evenly across the top. Now add another two tablespoons of the sauce, spread evenly and scatter over the sliced peppers. Add another two tablespoons of the sauce, spread evenly and scatter the zucchini slices evenly over the top. Cover the zucchini with any remaining sauce, then scatter the olives and capers over the top. Finally, sprinkle the mozarella and Parmesan evenly over the top.",

      "To make the pastry dough: In a food processor, combine the flour, sugar, and salt and pulse to blend. Add the butter and pulse about 10 times, or until the butter is in pea-size pieces; do not overprocess. While pulsing the processor, add 1/3 cup of the ice water, then pulse just until moist clumps of dough form, adding more water 1 tablespoon at a time if necessary.",
      "Transfer the dough to a work surface and divide it in half. Make one half slightly larger and shape each piece into a thick disk. Wrap individually in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes before rolling out.",
      "Position one rack in the lower third of the oven and a second rack just above it. Set a baking sheet on the bottom rack. (Being near the heat source will help the bottom crust bake and brown properly. The baking sheet will catch any bubbled-over juices.) Preheat the oven to 425\u00b0 F.",
      "In a medium bowl, combine 3/4 cup of the sugar, the cornstarch, and the salt. Stir in the cherries, amaretto, lemon juice, and cinnamon stick; set aside.",
      "Unwrap the larger disk of dough, set it on a floured surface, and lightly dust the top of the dough. Roll out the dough into a 13-inch round, occasionally rotating the dough and dusting it with flour to prevent sticking. Brush away the excess flour and transfer the dough to a 9 1/2-inch glass pie plate, centering it in the pie plate and letting the excess dough hang over the edges. Lightly press the dough into the dish. Refrigerate the pie shell.",
      "On the floured surface, roll out the other disk of dough into a 12-inch round. Using a large knife, cut ten 1-inch-wide strips from the dough round.",
      "Transfer the cherry filling to the pie shell, then scatter the butter on top. Arrange the dough strips over the filling, forming a lattice (see Note on page 146). Trim the dough overhang to 3/4 inch. Pinch the bottom crust and strips together and fold the overhang under. Crimp the edges to seal. Lightly brush the lattice with the milk and sprinkle the remaining 2 teaspoons sugar over it.",
      "Bake the pie on the rack above the baking sheet for 20 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 350\u00b0 F and bake the pie for about 1 hour longer, or until the crust is deep golden and the filling is bubbling. If the crust begins to brown too quickly, tent the pie with foil. Let the pie cool on a wire rack until warm, about 1 hour.",
      "Cut the pie into wedges and serve warm with ice cream."

Sprinkle both sides with salt and pepper and drizzle with two tablespoons olive oil. Place zucchini on the baking sheets in one layer. Roast for about 12 minutes, until lightly browned. Remove from the oven and reduce heat to 375 degrees F.",
      "Put it all together: Rub a 2-quart gratin with the half garlic clove and about a tablespoon of olive oil. Spread 1/4 cup tomato sauce into the bottom of the dish. Lay a third of the zucchini in an even layer over the sauce. Spoon another 1/4 cup of sauce over zucchini and sprinkle with 1/4 cup parmesan and a third of the pecorino and both mozzarella cheeses. Repeat for 2 more layers, ending with the remaining cheeses. There will be leftover sauce. (Aren't you lucky! Make some pasta later this week and then go to town on the sauce. Or just break out a baguette. You won't be sorry.) Drizzle on a tablespoon of olive oil. Bake 30 to 35 minutes, until bubbly and golden brown. Allow to sit for 5 to 10 minutes before serving to firm up a bit. I like to top my portions with a dollop of sauce and cheese, and thick slices of chewy bread to mop up every last bit from the bowl, but you can listen to your heart."

Brush with eggwash or heavy cream (or both) on the rims; sprinkle wet dough with turbinado sugar and grate fresh nutmeg over the pears. Bake the galette for 40-45 minutes or until done at 350. Rotate the baking sheet halfway through until the crusts are browned. Right when it comes out of the oven, brush a bit more apricot preserve on the pears to make them glisten! Let cool before serving. Galettes can be covered and kept at room temperature for 1 day."

Fold the dough rounds in half over the filling and crimp the edges to seal. Place the empanadas on a baking sheet lined with a Silpat or parchment paper.

Combine the remaining flour, beer, hot sauce, garlic powder, onion powder, and salt in another shallow bowl. Stir the former with a fork to break up any clumps. Stir the latter with a fork until completely smooth. (Adding the beer incrementally-splash then stir, splash then stir-helps create a smooth batter.)",

Cover with plastic wrap and let sit in a warm area for at least an hour, or up to 8 hours. As time passes, mixture should begin to bubble and expand slightly, creating the \"sponge\" starter.",

Scrape the dough from the bowl onto floured surface, then sprinkle more flour over the dough and knead until smooth, adding more flour if dough is too sticky, and roll dough into a small ball. Measure out a large piece of parchment paper, about 15\"x15\", and place dough on it. Flatten the dough slightly into a disk. Starting from the center of the dough, begin to spread the dough with your fingers, pushing from the center outwards, creating a rim all around and shaping dough into a round. Continue to consistently press the dough outwards, and as you do, the rim will become smaller as the circle increases in size. Press dough outwards until about 12\" to 14\" in diameter. Slide a large pizza peel underneath parchment paper and dough. Let rest for 5 to 10 minutes.",

When oil is hot and shimmering, add scallops and briefly sear on each side, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Scallops should be slightly undercooked as they will finish cooking in the oven on the pizza. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Squeeze lemon juice over scallops. Set aside.",

Sprinkle mozzarella over pizza, and then sprinkle most of the parmigiano-reggiano cheese over pizza, reserving a heaping tablespoon. Spread parsley over entire pizza, leaving scallops exposed as much as possible. It will look like it's a lot of parsley, but it will shrink down when it cooks in the oven. Sprinkle remaining parmigiano-reggiano cheese evenly over the pizza. Open oven door and carefully slide pizza and parchment paper onto pizza stone. Cook until cheese looks bubbly and is starting to brown slightly. Slide pizza peel underneath parchment paper and remove pizza from oven onto large cutting board or protected surface.

Although I'm sure the writer of the original recipe would cringe, I very rarely bake, don't own a pastry cutter and no one in my life trusts me to dual-wield knives without losing a finger or two like the recipe called for alternately. So, I beat the crap out of the butter with a metal potato masher and hands that I periodically chilled in the freezer until the right consistency was reached.",

Don't over-mix, just incorporate all the dry wispy bits of flour from the sides of the bowl. The dough will be lumpy, sticky in places and shaggy around the edges. Pick the dough up and knead it carefully in the bowl, turning over with each pass, 3-5 times, until almost all the mixture forms a cohesive mass.",

Keep your fingers reasonably close together as you don't want the yolk to break or drop through. Gently place the yolk into the other small bowl. Transfer the whites into the large bowl.

      "MAKE COUCHE: Fold the parchment in half lengthwise. Fold back to start an accordion pleat that overlaps about about 1-3/4\". Continue folding accordion style until you have seven fold lines. This will create three valleys on one side - or four on the other. Spread out the parchment and place weights at two opposite corners. See photos.",
      "DIVIDE DOUGH: Oil up your work surface and cutting utensil. Turn out dough onto surface. Make indentations to guess where you will cut to make three or four even pieces of dough. The center portion(s) will be narrower than the sides! Cut through and turn dough slices so that \"skin\" is on the oiled surface - this will make it less likely to stick.\r\nIt is best to just work with whatever size pieces you made, but if they are way off in size then slice off small pieces from the larger and lay on top of the smaller.",
      "SHAPE BAGUETTES: One by one, gently pull the cut portions into an oblong of even thickness; again, the less handling of dough the better. Fold lengthwise and seal edges with the heel or side egde of your hand. Gently roll out to make longer and narrower.",
      "COVER (or not): Cover with plastic wrap. If this is your first time working with high hydration dough and/or slashing is a challenge for you then NOT covering the baguettes might be helpful. The surface will dry out a little and this will making slashing less difficult. Allow loaves to proof.",
      "POKE TEST: Stick an index finger into the loaf. If dough springs back and dent disappears they are not ready, or under-proofed. If dent stays and does not spring back at all then loaves are over-proofed and will not rise fully. But if the dent fills in about halfway then they are ready to bake. Heat oven and baking stone.",
      "SEPARATE: Cut along top creases of parchment so that each loaf has its own little lily pad (?) of parchment.",
      "PREPARE TO SLASH: The goal of slashing is allow bread to rise in height through planned slits - otherwise it will burst at the seam you made when shaping, which is now on the bottom of the loaf. The slits should be ALMOST PARALLEL to the length of the loaf. The slits should overlap slightly and only be about 3/4\" apart at the overlap. [I will get a photo up].",
      "SLASHING (directions for right-handers): Oil up the serrated knife. Position baguette so it is at 11:00; knife will be at 12:00. Use left hand to provide resistance. Angle top edge of knife to the right and close to bread (so you can see your fingernails). Cut through 1/2\" of skin of loaf; use a sawing motion if necessary. This part of breadmaking takes the most practice in my opinion.",
      "BAKE! ; The beauty of the parchment paper is that the bread can be transferred to the baking surface on its paper very easily. About halfway through cooking the paper can be pulled out."

The best way to separate them is to clean your hands well and to crack the egg with one hand into the other so that you hold the yolk in your palm and the white drains into a bowl. If you haven't done this a lot, you will want to use a couple bowls: break each egg over one bowl before adding it to the others. If the yolk breaks and mixes with the white, you can't use the egg anymore. Even a trace of broken yolk can stop the whites from beating properly. Don't throw out the yolks-you can make lovely fresh pasta with those!",

Add more flour if needed, in small tablespoon size portions. Dough should not be sticky and should resemble pie crust dough. Wrap dough with plastic wrap or waxed paper and chill for a minimum of 2 hours, preferably 4.\r\n\r\n*You can also substitute your favorite pie crust for the base. Martha Stewarts Pate Brise recipe works well too.",
      "Preheat oven to 350 degrees. \r\n\r\nAdditional Ingredients: Seedless raspberry jam, 1 mediu sized jar. I use Smuckers, seedless raspberry jam.\r\n\r\nYou will need 4 small mini tart pans, non stick preferred.\r\n\r\nRemove base and topping dough from the refrigerator. Let stand for 20 minutes. To assemble tarts first fill tart pans with the base dough by pinching off a 1 1/2 tablespoon size piece of the base dough and press into the pan so that the entire surface is covered. Make sure there are no holes and that the dough reaches the top of the pan sides. If any holes are seen, the jam can leek out during baking. Once all of the tart indentations are filled with the base dough, place no more than 3/4 teaspoon of seedless raspberry jam into each tart. Do your best to make the jam fall to the center of each tart. Using two teaspoons helps. Top the tarts with the topping dough. 1 tablespoon size scoop, placed directly on the top. Wipe of any excess jam that may have fallen on the pan. \r\n\r\nPlace pans in preheated oven and bake for 20-25 minutes. Rotate pans if needed to ensure even baking. Tarts should not be brown on top, only slightly golden. \r\n\r\nOnce removed from the oven, cool on a wire rack for 10 minutes. Remove the tarts from the pan with a dull knife or small metal spatula, being careful not to scrape your nonstick pans. The tarts will be hot, and the filling even hotter, so use caution. If any jam leaks through it can be difficult to remove as it will have bubbled up and over the pan. Use care to not overfill, You'd hate to waste this yummy dough!\r\n\r\nEnjoy. \r\n\r\nTarts can be frozen for up to 1 month in freezer safe bags."

      "Heat the oil and butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat until butter is melted. Add the flour and cook 3-4 minutes while whisking frequently, until the roux turns beige. This cooks out the raw flour taste and makes a slightly nutty flavored roux. Add the hot milk while whisking ,and the mixture should immediately leaves the sides of the pan, clump in the middle, and be very very thick. The mixture should be smooth(no lumps of flour.) Turn off the heat. Switch to a wooden spoon and add the lemon juice and nutmeg, salt and pepper.",
      "With a can opener, open the top of each tuna can all the way, but leave the top in place. Over a bowl, invert each can and squeeze down hard on its contents so that all juices and oil leave the can. (Now give this bowl to your watchful kitty!) Over the saucepan of beschamel, add the tuna while shredding finely with your fingers. Blend thoroughly and adjust seasoning as needed. The goal is a well blended,smooth creamy mixture, not a chunky one, and with a bright lemon flavor (enough so that it won't need more later) spiked by pepper. Spread mixture into any spray-oiled 8-9\" square pan; cover and refrigerate a few hours or overnight (or a few days) to set up.",
      "Remove the pan from the frig, uncover, and cut it into a grid of 4 x 4 squares. Remove each square (a narrow cake spatula or pancake spatula helps) and stand them on end in the pan, leaning against each other. Now roll them all: fold each square lightly in half , and roll in the palms of your hands briefly til you have a smooth 2 1/2\" long, square ended barrel . To get the proper and equal size, I usually end up with only 15. Place them in a shallow oiled pan with edges.",
      "Place the panko in a container that has a tight fitting lid. With one hand, place 2 or 3 croquetas at a time into the bowl of well beaten egg. With that same hand, grasp each by its end and flip it lengthwise, rolling them around in the egg. Then place 2 or 3 in the panko.",
      "With the other hand, snap on the container lid and gently shake the container to coat the croquetas with panko. With that same other hand, remove them and place them back on the same sheet pan. When all are done, refrigerate 1 hour (or up to 3 days, covered) to set the coating. They should be firm, not limp or squishy .",
      "In a medium size saucepan or fryer, heat a 3-4\" depth of oil to 370 degrees F. Carefully lower in the croquetas. Depending on the size of your pan, fry about 4-5 croquetas at a time (do not crowd them) for about 5 minutes til medium brown. Stir gently after 2-3 minutes to assure their not sticking on the bottom. To test for doneness, remove a croqueta and insert a metal skewer tip into the middle. Upon removal, if the skewer tip is hot, the middle of the croqueta is as well. Drain on thick newspapers topped by a triple thickness of paper towels.",
      "Notes: *Japanese panko is readily found in supermarkets and Asian food stores. For frying, it is hugely superior to bread crumbs because its texture and airiness creates a much crisper crunchier coating.",
      "** Fresh oil is necessary for a clean fried taste. I use about 4 1/2 cups of oil to fry one batch of croquetas. I then filter the cooled oil through a fine sieve and discard the debris from the sieve and the pan. If the oil retains a golden color(unlikely), I may add a bit of new oil to it and use it for one more batch of croquetas, but then I discard that oil after that second batch.",

Remove from the feedtube, slice per above, discarding the seeded centers. Repeat with the rest of the cucumber pieces until you have 16-18 ounces of usable noodles.Gently toss the cucumber strips with 2T. kosher salt. Put in a colander or sieve for 1 hour or until cucumber noodles have given up their water and become silky and flexible. Rinse thoroughly once or twice in running water to remove salt.

As you roll, occasionally peel the top parchment away from the dough, then flip the dough over and peel away what was the bottom parchment as well. This keeps the dough from fully adhering to the parchment during rolling, and also makes it less likely that crinkles in the paper will leave lines on your dough. Roll out the dough to 1/4-inch thick.",
      "Use a round cookie cutter to cut it out. (Note: If you used a cookie cutter to trace guides on the parchment for your pate a choux, you can use the same cutter to cut the rounds of dough.)

Next, add the garlic, spring onions, pickled chiles, and pickled ginger. Stir fry for another minute.",

Spoon the sauce from the bottom of the wok over the fish and cover to cook for 5 to 8 minutes. During this time raise the lid a few times to spoon more sauce over the fish. Once the fish is cooked through, carefully lift the fish out of the wok and place onto a serving plate.",

Place the pork over the the sweet potato and now everything is ready for steaming. Into a large stock pot, add about 1 1/2 inches of water. Then place a metal vegetable steamer in the center, and your bowl on top. Cover with the lid and bring to a boil. Once the water has come to a boil, turn the flame down to a medium low. Steam for 1 1/2 to 2 hours, or until the pork and potatoes are super tender. The water in the pot should last the whole cooking time. If it looks to be drying, you may have the flame on too high. Half way in, mix the pork layer a bit to allow the rice meal to cook evenly.",

So there you have it, the mystery dish, from the mystery place, that's loved throughout India.

Replace the husks and place them on the grill for about 30 minutes rotating them periodically as the husk turns from green to brown. The moist husks will steam the corn and keep the corn from burning. Cut off the cob immediately and add on top of the arugula."

My preference is the Maseca brand. If you buy Quaker masa [the most common brand available in the U.S.], be sure to buy the \"Masa Harina de Maiz,\" NOT the \"Harina Preparada Para Tortillas.\" Regular corn meal can not be substituted for masa. Canela, also called true, Mexican, Ceylon, or Sri Lankan cinnamon, is a less pungent variety than the cassia cinnamon commonly used in the U.S.\r\n Guajillos are large, dark-red chiles with a nutty flavor and not too much heat."

Store bought pastry dough works fine as well. Here is the recipe I used http://www.10thkitchen.com/2013/11/mushroom-gorgonzola-caramelized-onion-hand-pies-recipe/",

      "If prepping Thanksgiving inspired filling follow this recipe: roughly cut bread into cubes - no need to be perfect, these will go in the food processor. Melt butter in pan and place bread crumbs in. Coat all pieces well with melted butter. Add salt, pepper and fresh thyme. Cook until brown and crispy. Remove from heat. Set aside.",
      "Heat olive oil in a large pan. Cook turkey with salt, pepper, and bay leaves for about 5 mins. Do not cook all the way through, you still want a little pink. Remove from pan and place in bowl.",
      "Add extra olive oil to same pan if necessary. Saute onions and garlic until fragrant and translucent, about 2 mins. Add leeks and mushrooms, cook down until tender, for 3-4 mins. Salt and pepper to taste. Put the turkey back in the pan and let the flavors combine and allow the turkey to cook all the way through. Remove from heat and transfer to a large mixing bowl.",
      "Put bread crumbs in food processor. Give it a coarse pulse (you don't want to turn the bread into dust). Add bread crumbs to ground turkey and veggie mixture. Crack two eggs into the bowl and add chicken broth. Mix thoroughly. Set aside.",
      "Flour a surface and rolling pin to roll out dough. You do not want it too thin as it needs to stand up to the hardy filling. Once rolled into 1/8 thickness, cut out large circular shapes to form a hand pie - I used an upside down bowl to create my shape. Follow this same method if using store bought dough.",
      "Put parchment paper on a baking sheet. Place cut out dough on sheet and fill with meat and veggie mixture placing the stuffing in the center. Fold in half to create a hand pie/empanada shape. With fingers, press into dough along edges to close. Crack an egg into a bowl and use as egg wash on top of hand pies. Put a slit with a knife or scissors into the top of the pie to release steam. Bake pies for 25-30 or until golden brown. Serve with cranberry dipping sauce or leftover gravy."

While constantly whisking the egg mixture in the bowl, slowly pour the oil into the mixture, drop by drop, until an emulsion forms. Continue to whisk as you very slowly pour the oil into the bowl in a thin stream. If the mixture gets too thick, add the water to thin it out. Once about half of the oil is mixed in, you can pour the rest of the oil in a little faster. When all of the oil is in, you should have a smooth mixture with a consistency slightly looser than store bought mayonnaise. At this point, taste the mayonnaise and season it to taste with salt and more lemon juice if desired. Stir in the chives. Store any extra mayonnaise in an airtight container in the refrigerator for no more than a few days."

While that's heating up, combine the sugar, cornstarch, egg yolks, and salt in a bowl, and whisk until smooth. Add a splash of hot milk and whisk. Add another, bigger splash and whisk. Keep repeating this until you've added all the milk. Now pour this mixture back into the saucepan and cook-whisking slowly but constantly-until the mixture either comes to a boil or thickens enough for the whisk to leave a distinct trail, with a consistency that resembles pudding. Remove from heat and add the butter, vanilla extract, and bourbon. Whisk until smooth. Press the pastry cream through a fine-mesh sieve (to remove any lumps) into a heatproof bowl. Press plastic film against the custard to prevent a skin from forming. Chill until completely cold.",
      "Make and bake the pate a choux: Heat the oven to 425\u00b0F. Line 2 sheet pans with parchment. Combine the water, butter, sugar, and salt in a large saucepan. Set on the stove over high heat and bring to a boil. Turn off the heat. Add the flour (yep, all at once!) and stir with a wooden spoon until smooth. Turn the heat back on to medium-low and cook, stirring constantly, for about 2 minutes, or until the mixture begins to leave a film on the bottom of the pan. Turn off the heat. Let the mixture cool for a few minutes, stirring occasionally to release steam. Once it's slightly cooled, add one egg and mix until smooth. Repeat this until you've added 8 eggs. (You can do this egg-adding part in a standing mixer, but I prefer to not dirty another dish.) Beat the remaining egg with a couple grains of salt in a small bowl until smooth. Use a tablespoon-sized cookie scoop to drop the pate a choux onto the prepared sheet pans, spacing the blobs about 3 inches apart. (Overcrowding will prevent them from rising properly, so you'll need to do 2 rounds in the oven. The dough is fine sitting at room temp, but I like to cover it with a kitchen towel or some plastic wrap.) Brush the egg wash on top of each one. Bake for 22 to 25 minutes, or until doubled in size and browned. When they come out of the oven, poke each puff's side with a paring knife to help release steam. Scoop and bake the remaining pate a choux dough. You should get at least 54 puffs. Cool completely on wire racks before filling.",
      "When the puffs are cool, fill them: You can go about this a couple ways: 1) by filling a plastic baggie with some pastry cream and snipping one of the corners or 2) fitting a piping bag with a 1/2-inch plain tip and filling that. Both work, so totally your call. Remember that steam vent in each puff? That's your pastry cream's entry point. Fill each puff.",
      "Re-line one of the sheet pans with a fresh sheet of parchment. Now fill it with the cream puffs; with 54 puffs, it'll be 9x6 puffs.",
      "Make the caramel: Combine the sugar and water in a saucepan. Set over medium-heat heat. Fill a small dish with water; if you see any sugar grains creeping up the sides of the pan, dip a pastry brush in the water, and brush away the grains (this prevents crystallization). When the sugar turns from cloudy to clear, add the vinegar. Continue to cook until the sugar caramelizes and turns amber. You want to cut the heat *before* it reaches your dream color (a rich brown), since it will significantly continue to darken as it cools. (If you're worried about taking it too far or not confident in the timing, you can fill a bowl with ice water and bobble the saucepan in there to halt the cooking.)",
      "Top the puffs: Let the caramel cool for about 5 minutes, or until it's no longer bubbly and about the thickness of maple syrup or runny honey. (If you top the puffs when the caramel is too warm and liquidy, it won't form the same thick layer on top of the puff.) Use a heat-proof spoon to top each cream puff with a lid of caramel; you don't want too much to drip down, or else the puffs will become problematically adhered to each other. Sprinkle each caramel-topped puff with flaky salt before the caramel hardens. After you've topped each puff, you should have some caramel leftover. Use the spoon to wave caramel back and forth, all around the sheet pan, to create thin strands. Let cool for a few minutes until the caramel is totally hard, then serve."

      "For roasting the beetroot - Preheat the oven @ 180 Degrees. \r\nPeel the beetroot, keeping the natural form of the vegetable intact. Once done, line up a baking tray with parchment paper and marinate the beetroot with some olive oil, rock salt & sugar. Let it sit out for 5 mins and then put it to roast in the preheated oven for 25 mins roughly. ( It could take longer or lesser depending on the genetics of the beetroot that you would be using, hence, its wise to keep an eye out for a brown crust like surface on the beetroot, if achieved, take it out and keep it intact, don't cut it! )",
      "While your beetroot is roasting, take this time to cook the quail eggs to a soft boil stage. For this - Boil some water and keep a bowl of ice water handy with you to cool down the eggs rapidly. Put in the quail eggs and boil for maximum 3 mins, and immediately put them in the cold water to shock them and stop from further cooking. Peel carefully and keep aside for final use.",
      "Next is to treat the greens with some love, for which, take the greens, cut them roughly, add some olive oil, salt & lemon juice and toss them until well coated.",
      "The final step is to roast the Charoli seeds for which you could either use the oven once your beetroot has been done, or you could also do it over a non-stick pan over medium heat. Start to roast them and stop when you see them browning up and keep aside.",
      "For plating - Take a round bowl and place the whole roasted beetroot in the middle. Now put your greens all around it, once done, add the charoli seeds from the top and finish with the quail eggs."

Scatter chilled butter and shortening over the flour mixture. Pulse about 15 times, until the mixture resembles wet sand with some pea-sized pieces of butter remaining. Scrape down the sides of the bowl, making an even layer of dough in the process. Add the remaining flour in an even layer. Pulse just until combined, about 5 to 6 fast pulses.",
      "Dump contents into a medium-large bowl. Drizzle the water mixture evenly over the flour mixture. Using a rubber or silicone spatula fold and press the mixture until it all combines into a slightly sticky dough. If necessary sprinkle on another tablespoon of water. Divide dough into 2 unequal portions, using about 2/3 of the dough for the larger one. Flatten the dough balls to about 3/4-inch thickness, wrap tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least one hour. (Note: dough can be made and refrigerated 1 to 2 days ahead.)",

Cut apricot halves in half (pole to pole) then each quarter crosswise into 2 or 3 pieces depending on the size of the fruit. Do the same with the plum halves, cutting each quarter into 3 or 4 pieces. You want the pieces to be about the same size as a raspberry. Add to the bowl with the dry ingredients, along with the lemon juice. Stir until well combined. Set aside.",
      "Line a 15- by 10-inch rimmed sheet pan with heavy-duty aluminum foil, so that it comes up and over the edges of the pan.",
      "Roll the larger piece of dough out between 2 pieces of parchment paper (13-inch wide, and 19-inch long.) Lightly flour the bottom piece before placing the dough on it, then lightly flour the dough before placing the top piece. Roll the dough out to almost completely fill your parchment (no more than 1/2-inch of parchment unfilled on each edge. You will want to lightly flour the top surface at about the halfway point to prevent sticking. When you are done rolling the dough, remove the top piece of parchment paper, then roll the dough and the bottom sheet of parchment paper lightly around your rolling pin. Transfer the dough to the prepared pan, with the parchment side up. Peel the parchment off the dough, and gently press the dough into the corners of the pan. (Don't worry if the dough tears a bit, just patch it back together using pieces of dough that overhang the edges.) Trim dough that overhangs the edges by more than a quarter inch or so.",
      "Spread the filling evenly into the dough. Scatter the raspberries evenly over the filling. (Note: I buy organic raspberries, and don't wash them because they are so fragile. You may gently rinse them and allow to briefly air dry if desired.) Place filled pie in the fridge while rolling out the top crust.",

Remove the top layer of parchment and evenly cut 15 to 20 holes in the crust using whatever pattern you'd like. I used a bubble tea straw to do this. Cover the pie with the crust, using the rolling pin as before. If the dough is overly soft, refrigerate it for 10 to 15 minutes before covering the pie. Don't worry if there are some small tears, it's a rustic pie so they add charm. Remove the parchment. Fold the bottom crust over the top crust, then use the tines of a fork to seal them together. Refrigerate for 30 to 60 minutes before baking.",

Bake pie for 40 to 45 minutes until filling is bubbly and crust is golden brown. Rotating pan 180\u00b0 after 20 to 25 minutes for even baking. Remove from oven and cool on rack for 40 to 45 minutes.",
      "When pie has almost finished cooling whisk together the powdered sugar, almond extract, and half-and-half in a small bowl. It should be thin enough to drizzle in a stream; if necessary add a bit more half-and-half. Cover with plastic wrap until ready to use if it'll be more than a few minutes.",
      "Using the foil transfer the pie to a serving platter or cutting board, taking care to gently slide the pie from the foil. Drizzle with the glaze in an attractive fashion. Serve warm or allow to cool and serve at room temperature."

With a floured flat spatula, transfer each dough circle to the parchment lined baking sheets.

Pinch corners of the opening tightly to prevent cookies from flopping open while baking. Place in freezer for at least 30 minutes; this will help ensure that they hold their shape. While cookies freeze, preheat the oven to 375 F, and unwrap the remaining dough, repeating the rolling, cutting, filling, folding and freezing process.",

(I admit this sounds tedious, but the almonds shouldn't be very stuck, and the process goes fast. If any nuts refuse to budge, try stabbing the almond with the toothpick and prying it out, or just leave it - a toasted almond in a cookie isn't such a bad surprise!)",
      "Set aside the floured almonds to re-use as you wish. (You may opt to pulse them in a food processor to make your own almond meal, perhaps for another batch of these cookies. If you use them for another purpose, just remember they're neither gluten nor dairy free.)",
      "Let the emptied cookies chill completely, at least to room temperature, before filling. Set your ice cream on the countertop for a few minutes to let it soften. Transfer the ice cream to a pastry bag or plastic bag with a small corner cut off; place open tip inside a cookie. Squeeze until corners are filled and ice cream domes out the top. (Alternately, you can use a small spoon or mini spatula to fill them, but I find the piping method easier.)",
      "Repeat with all cookies, serving or placing in freezer immediately as you go. The cookies are most delicious just after being baked, cooled and filled. They are also wonderful treated like ice cream sandwiches - stored in a tightly covered container in the freezer (if stacking cookies, place parchment or waxed paper in between layers) - and eaten within a week. When serving from the freezer, let sit out for a few minutes before digging in."

      "To assemble cheesecake, 1/3 of the lemon filling over the crust, then drop some of the caramel by the tsp over that and swirl with a knife. Then pour half the remaining filling over that, then drop more of the caramel over that and swirl with a knife. Pour the remaining lemon filling over that, and then drop more caramel over that. Once the pan is full, tap the bottom on the counter to level, and swirl with a knife in a spiral from the outside in to the center, then a toothpick if you want more intricate swirls. Place in the freezer for 4 hours or until set. When ready to serve, garnish with dried fruit, nuts and lemon slices. Store cake in the fridge. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*If you are unable to get young coconut meat, you may substitute 4 cups raw cashews, soaked 4 hours and drained and filtered water instead of the coconut water.\r\n\r\n\r\n**If your coconut meat is very soft and watery, you may need to add a few More Tbsp coconut butter."

Transfer the powder to the bowl of a stand mixer or a mixing bowl. Then pulse the flaxseeds until they too form a fine powder and transfer it to the same bowl. Combine these with the flours, the whole sesame seeds, salt, oil, honey, and water. If using a stand mixer, mix it all with the paddle attachment on a slow speed for 1 to 2 minutes. If mixing by hand, stir with a large spoon for 1 to 2 minutes. It should form a firm, unsticky ball. (If not, add flour or water as needed.) Then transfer the dough to a floured surface and knead very briefly to make sure the dough holds together and the ingredients are distributed throughout the dough. The dough will feel very slightly tacky but not sticky.",
      "Heat the oven to 300\u00b0 F. For every pan of crackers that you want to make now -- well-wrapped, the dough will hold for a week in the fridge and up to three months in the freezer -- line a baking sheet with parchment paper.",
      "Divide the dough into four equal pieces. Working on a well-floured surface and using a rolling pin, roll the dough out until it is relatively thin (Reinhart suggests 1/16 of an inch). The dough may stick in the process, so check it frequently, lifting it up to see if it needs more flour or flipping the whole thing over. If the dough pulls back instead of obediently rolling out, let it rest for a few minutes and then begin again.",
      "Separate the egg and whisk the white with 2 tablespoons of water. (Save the yolk for something else.) Then paint the dough's surface with the egg wash and sprinkle it with sesame seeds and poppy seeds. Using a pizza cutter or a metal dough scraper, cut the dough into your preferred cracker size and shape. Then gently transfer the shapes to the prepared baking sheet. (Reinhart notes that because the crackers won't spread or rise, they can almost touch.)",
      "If you are making multiple pans, you can bake them all at the same time. (Bake for ten minutes and then rotate the pans; bake for another ten and rotate again.) After approximately 25 or 30 minutes, depending on how thin you rolled the dough, the crackers should be about done, which means bordering on golden brown, well-dried, and crisp. (If the crackers are still pale, increase the heat to 325 once they begin to crisp.) Leave the crackers on the baking sheet so they crisp up more. They should snap when cool. (If they don't, return them to the oven for a few more minutes.)",
      "Let the crackers cool for at least 15 minutes. They will keep in an airtight container on the counter for a week (or in the freezer for far longer)."

Or you can do what I did and use as many perfect summer fruits as you can carry. Once you've added all the fruit to the baking dish, toss with a good dash of vanilla and a tablespoon or two of the sweetener of your choice (really, anything goes!) and a tablespoon of cornstarch. Set aside.",
      "Decide which herb you want to use to add a little extra zing to the topping. It may sound strange, but it is worth it. A subtle hint of thyme, mint, basil, sage, or rosemary does wonders with fruit. Grab a sprig or a handful of leaves and chop well; you won't be sorry.",
      "Pick your desired dairy replacer. Far be it from me to suggest anything that challenges the gospel of Julia Child, but for a delicious fruit crisp you need neither dairy-based butter nor cream. I like to use unrefined coconut oil because I enjoy the taste, but any vegan butter will do. You'll need about 1/2 cup. Now for milk: pour about 1/2 cup of the dairy-free milk of your choosing (almond! coconut! soy! hemp!) into a small saucepan. Add the butter and the herb you decided on in the previous step. Place over low heat until the butter melts and the kitchen smells herby. Let cool slightly.",
      "Choose your flour. If you're gluten-free, this part is for you. Though I will admit, I didn't miss my trusty all-purpose nearly as much as I thought I would when trying out almond, garbanzo bean, and coconut flours. Go for about a cup of flour at first, you can always add more later. Mix the flour with however much sugar you feel is right. A good rule of thumb is to start with 1/4 cup and work your way up to 1/2 cup. At this point, I throw in a few handfuls of rolled oats and sometimes chopped almonds or pecans for texture. Pour the non-dairy mixture over the flour, adding a good pinch or two of salt and cinnamon or allspice. Mix it all up with your fingers until coarse crumbs form, adding more flour or oats if things get sticky.",
      "Put it all together! Dump the topping over the fruit, resisting the urge to fill in any imperfect spots. We're making a rustic dessert here, people! Bake at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for about 30 minutes. Top with your favorite ice cream or coconut whipped cream. Or if you're like me, you may even put it in a bowl and drown it in almond milk and pretend it's breakfast."

Add the chopped shitake, unsalted stock and unsweetened soy milk and bring to a simmer. Place 1/2 cup spicy miso paste on top of a very fine sieve. Lower the sieve half-way into the simmering soup and use a spoon to slowly dissolve the paste into the soup (it may seem very thick and troublesome in the beginning but be patient, it'll dissolve eventually). You'd be surprised at how much \"solids\" within the paste will remain on top of the sieve, which if dumped directly into the soup, will make the soup very thick and \"sauce-like\".",

Once the water is boiling fiercely, place the lobster onto the rack, cover the pot and bring back to the boil.\r\n\r\nBegin timing once the water is boiling again. Steam the lobster for 14 minutes for the first lb of weight and then an extra 3 minutes for each extra lb. A 2 lb lobster will cook in 17 minutes, a 3 lb in 20 minutes. Try not to overcook the lobster, as this will result in tougher and less succulent meat. Overcooking also means that some of the delicious flavour will be lost and the meat may shrink, become stringy or even mushy.\r\n\r\nThe lobster is ready when it has reached an internal temperature of 80\u00b0C (180\u00b0F). Once it is done, drain and serve immediately. Otherwise plunge it into a bowl of ice cold water (very cheffy) to stop it from cooking. Then drain.

Seal the jar, place into a large saucepan and add enough water to come halfway up the side of the jar. Bring the water to the boil, then remove the pan from the heat and set aside to cool.\r\n\r\nStrain the lobster oil through a fine sieve.",
