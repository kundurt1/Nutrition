Now a roux-thickened liquid must boil to become thick, so if using a crock pot you'll have to remove liquid out of the crock and boil it with the roux to make a thick gravy and then add that back to the crock pot. Another method is to mix some cornstarch in a 1:2 cornstarch to liquid ratio. You could use the pot liquor for the liquid but you would want to cool it off a bit to avoid lumps. Then boil it all before adding it back to the stew. If you're cooking this stove-top you can just add the cornstarch slurry to the pot and then simmer the whole thing. Two other thickening tricks are to add a bit of oatmeal or tapioca to the mix. Oatmeal does add it's own flavor and texture if you've got thick cut oats, the quick-cook oats will completely dissolve. Instant tapioca pearls dissolve away and about 1.5 tablespoons should do it.",

      "You must keep the rice moving.",
      "After 2 or 3 minutes it will begin to look translucent as it absorbs all the flavours of your base (it may crackle at this point that`s fine).",
      "Add the vermouth or wine keeping on stirring as it hits the pan it will smelt fantastic!",
      "It will sizzle around the rice evapourating any harsh alcohol flavours and leaving the rice with a tasty essence.",
      "I must admit I`m a sucker for dry vermouth. When it cooks into the rice it seems to give it a really full but subtle flavour and leaves a wicked sweetness that works perfectly with the rice. White wine is lovely probably more delicate and fresh.",
      "Try both see what you think.",
      "Stage 2.",
      "Once the vermouth or wine seems to have cooked into the rice add your first ladle of hot stock and a pinch of salt (add small amounts of salt to taste white you are adding the stock).",
      "Turn down the heat to a highish simmer (the reason we don`t want to boil the hell out of it is because if we do the outside of the rice wilt be cooked and fluffy and the inside will be raw).",
      "Keep adding ladlefuls of stock stirring and allowing each ladleful to be absorbed before adding the next.",
      "This will take about 15 minutes.",
      "Taste the rice is it cooked?",
      "Carry on adding stock until the rice is soft but with a slight bite.",
      "Check seasoning.",
      "Stage 3.",
      "Remove from the heat and add the butter and the Parmesan saving a little of the latter to go on top if you like.",

      "If you follow this recipe I promise you`ll be making some of the best risottos out. The real secret of a good risotto I`m afraid is that you have to stand over it and give it your loving and undivided attention for about 17 minutes but it`s worth it. The recipe is in stages; I am going to give you five of my favourite risottos all variants of this basic recipe.",

NOTE: I don't have a stand mixer, my regular hand mixer worked just fine. Reduce the speed to medium-low and gradually add the powdered sugar until all of it is incorporated. Add the Kaluha, increase the speed to medium-high and whip for another 2 to 3 minutes, until it is light and fluffy.",

      "Pour melted candy onto the prepared pan. Tilt the sheet to spread the candy to a 6x8 inch puddle. As the sugar starts to set (one or two minutes after pouring) cut candy into 1/2 x 4 inch strips. Remove one strip and twist gently. Allow to cool on wire rack. Repeat with remaining pieces. To keep the candy malleable, place in the oven for 1-2 minutes. You may prefer to keep the cookie sheet heated and work out of the oven. I found this to be a successful method. When candy pieces harden, lightly coat them with disco dust using a 2\" soft-hair paintbrush.",

But don't just look for signs of fermentation; also get close with your nose and sniff for that clean but tangy pickled smell that means the safe, tasty and healthy transformation you're after is happening. Because of the spices, your fermenting fruit salsa will be more aromatic than plain vegetable ferments are.",
      "Once the apple salsa has been actively fermenting for at least 24 hours, transfer it to the refrigerator or a cool, dark cellar. You won't need the plate under the jar any longer, because the cold storage temperature will slow down fermentation so much that there shouldn't be any overflow. If you opt for the refrigerator, store the apple salsa on the top shelf of the main compartment where it is the coolest. This will help the apples keep their crunch longer. Wait at least a week longer before eating the salsa."

      "Remove the green part of the green onions, and reserve.",
      "Using a good sized frying pan, in the olive oil, sweat (reminder not to use salt if later using myzithra cheese) the basil, oregano, garlic, and the chopped white part of the onions over medium low heat for a few minutes. If you are using dried parsley, add it to the sweat, otherwise do not add at this stage. (If you are substituting fresh herbs for dried, also do not add now.).",
      "When the onions are soft and starting to fall apart, add the spinach and any fresh herbs. Simmer for several minutes at the same heat. (The purpose of this is to add the flavor of the herbs and aromatics to the spinach.).",
      "Let that cool. This is very important. Commune with your family and/or friends, and forget about it for a while. Let the flavors meld, and accept that there's a reason for this. Preheating the oven to 375 depends on the oven, and how long the cooling process takes and how comfortable you are with your utility bills.",
      "Once the spinach mixture has reached at least a lukewarm temperature, in a mixing bowl, or if of limited means the same pan if it's large enough, add the feta, and get your hand(s) in there and start working the product. Depending on the liquid consistency, this is where this recipe becomes an art and a set of guidelines rather than a structured explanation. With your hand on the mixture, you're going to know whether it is feeling tacky or not. You want something like bread dough ready to bake, as far as tactile feel goes.",
      "You will need one egg for the inner part of the eventual product to \"set\" properly. Add that at this point in the process. That will give you a feel for how the rest of this will go. The reason you wanted it to cool was so that you could feel the temperature without burns, and to ensure that the egg did not cook in the spinach mixture.",
      "The strongly suggested myzithra should be added now. If that is not available, or outside of price range, then parmesan and romano should be added now. (It's a matter of preference, in the end, as the myzithra was the \"WOW\", but it's still an amazing dish without it.) What you want is at least a half cup combined. If the secondary cheeses (remember the feta was already added) do not drop the liquid consistency to \"tacky\", add more. If it is dry at this point, add another egg and add more cheese to get it to \"tacky\". What ingredients, dry or fresh, you used prior to this stage have an effect now.",
      "Once you reach that proper consistency, wash your hands, you don't need to touch it any more (potential cross contamination issues with the eggs), and oil a baking dish of similar proportions to the filo dough you purchased. I suggest butter, but do not use olive oil. Its smoking point is too low, and will often burn at 375\u00b0F.",
      "Lay out about half of the filo dough on the bottom of the oiled baking dish. Place the spinach mixture onto the lower layer of the filo dough. Make sure it reaches the edges. If there is some tearing, do not worry as long as the lower layers of the dough are still solid. This is normal, and will not comprise the final product. Lay the rest of the filo dough on top. Brush the top layer with the melted butter. This will assist in producing a crunchy top layer and help keep it from burning.",
      "Place in preheated 375F oven. Cook for 10-15 minutes, and check. Apply more butter if needed. Cook for a total of 20-25 minutes. You should be able to smell it and hear a solid almost frying sound when it is ready."

For easier handling, allow parts of the sheet to remain a little bit stiff (some of the hatch marks that are in the design of most rice papers can still be visible). Remove from water very carefully.",
      "Place the rice paper wrapper on a smooth, dry surface. Surface should be ceramic, plastic or glass - Rice paper wrappers can stick to wooden surfaces. Take 1/5 of noodles and arrange lengthwise 1 inch from the bottom of wrapper. Leave 1-2 inches of the wrapper uncovered on the sides, as well.",
      "Add mint, cilantro or basil, lettuce, and 1/5 of the flaked salmon as separate layers on top of the vermicelli. Pull the bottom edge of the wrapper up to cover the filling. Now fold both sides of the wrapper up to cover the edges. Continue rolling, tucking the filling in towards you with your fingers and roll tightly so that the roll remains firm (but not so tightly that you rip the rice paper!).",
