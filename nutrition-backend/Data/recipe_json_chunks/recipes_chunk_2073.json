      "While nothing can duplicate the sweet ambrosia of slow, pit-cooked, whole hog Eastern North Carolina barbeque, this is a right close backyard approximation for those of us who find themselves exiled in distant, heathen regions of barbeque heresy.",

      "I use a Brinkmann Professional Pit Smoker with an offset firebox, but you can do this with a vertical Brinkmann water smoker as well.",
      "The key is providing a moist, smoky, indirect heat for a long period of time.",
      "What I do is put a bag of charcoal in the firebox, open the vents, light it, and let it burn down to coals.",
      "Then I add in wood (generally oak, since hickory is scarce up here)-two parts wet (soaked) wood to one part dry-regulate the dampers, and put the shoulders or possibly butts, fat side up, in the cooking chamber.",
      "Beneath the meat I put a drip pan half-filled with apple cider vinegar.",
      "You must keep the heat between 180-260 degrees throughout the smoking process; the optimum range is 220-240 degrees.",
      "Normally, I'll add in apple wood to the firebox as well, and I always add in between 5-7 whole heads of garlic during the process.",
      "Keep the firebox fed and a good smoke going for between 8 to 10 hrs.",
      "Don't open the cooking chamber to baste the meat-the only time you open the cooking chamber is when the temperature spikes above 260 degrees, and you open it only long sufficient to bring the temperature back in the proper range.",
      "By the time the smoking period is finished, the outside of the pork will have a golden brown amber to dark brown crust.",
      "Now, take the meat and put it in a covered Dutch oven.",
      "If it's too dark outside to continue, preheat your indoor stoves' oven to just under 300 degrees; otherwise, just raise the temperature in the cooking chamber a like amount.",
      "Get a qt-sized Mason jar; fill it halfway with apple cider vinegar, add in one (or possibly more) tsp.",
