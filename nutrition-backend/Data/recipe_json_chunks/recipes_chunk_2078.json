      "For preserved jam, pack the hot fruit in the sterilized jars and seal using the hot-pack method (see Know-how, page 291).",

      "Winter: Pumpkin marmalade, orange or tangerine marmalade",
      "A little bit of butter is often added to berry jams, but not for the reason you might expect.",
      "More than adding a hint of richness, the butter helps keep the jam from foaming, thus reducing the need to skim the jam as it cooks.",
      "I love the straightforward taste of simple fruit jam, but when Im feeling more adventurous I like to play off of the fruits sweetness by adding less run-of-the-mill seasonings.",
      "A 1/4-cup splash of balsamic vinegar deepens the flavor of strawberry or mixed berry jam, while a sprig or two of fresh thyme or rosemary imparts an elegant grassy end note to blackberry or plum jam.",

      "If enough pectin is present, the sugar can be reduced to taste.",
      "Apples, pears, and quinces are good sources of natural pectin, but if you want to take a more precise approach or avoid introducing those flavors, you can use store-bought natural pectin, such as the Pomona brand.",
