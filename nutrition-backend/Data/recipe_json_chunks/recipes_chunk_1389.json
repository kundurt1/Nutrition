    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "To Make the Shells:\r\n1. Set up your sheet trays with parchment paper or nonstick\r\nbaking mats. 2 trays should be sufficient. If you want to be exact, use a sharpie attached to a compass to draw 3/4\" circles one inch apart on each sheet of parchment and then flip the sheets over.\r\n2. Whip the egg whites, sugar, and cream of tartar until nice satinlike,\r\nstiff peaks form.\r\n3. Meanwhile, put the pecans and the confectioner's sugar in the food processor and pulse until you have what resembles whole wheat flour in appearance.\r\n4. Sift the dry mixture onto a piece of parchment paper. You may have some bits of pecans about the size of nonpereil sprinkles that don't go through and that's okay, although macaron purists would probably beg to differ. I say, dump them on top. The idea is just to make sure that you don't have any sugar lumps or chunks of nut.\r\n5. When your egg whites are sufficiently whipped, switch to the paddle attachment and stir in the dry mixture on low speed until incorporated.\r\n6. Use a spatula to fold the mixture by hand for about a minute (40-45 times) until it flows slowly like lava.\r\n7. Scoop your mixture into a pastry bag and pipe 3/4\" rounds from about a half inch tall at a distance of one inch apart. When the tray is full, smack it firmly on the counter 2 or 3 times to release air.\r\n8. Let your trays set for 15 minutes at room temperature while you are preheating your oven to 375 degrees. It seems arbitrary, but don't skip this step. They need time to develop their skin.\r\n9. Turn oven down to 325 degrees and bake for 10 minutes, turning halfway through.\r\n10. Let them cool for a couple minutes and then transfer to wire racks to cool completely. If you are having trouble peeling them from the tray, try sliding an offset spatula underneath.",
      "To Make the Filling:\r\nAny kind of buttercream or icing consistency ganache, caramel, or other confection will work to fill macarons. When I made the ones in the photo, I was aiming to reduce waste and used a basic chocolate american buttercream with a pinch of espresso added for some kick, because I already had some on hand. You only need about a quarter of a cup of filling for this amount of shells, but you can store leftovers in the fridge for your next project. Just let it come to room temperature before you try to whip it up again, otherwise condensation will give your baking anxiety a jump start.\r\n1. Whip up the softened butter.\r\n2. Sift together the confectioner's sugar and cocoa powder and add the mixture to the butter bowl with the cream.\r\n3. Mix on low speed until incorporated. Whip on high speed until fluffy.\r\n4. Scoop into pastry bag.",
      "To Assemble:\r\nWhen the shells are cooled, match them up in same sized pairs. If you did the reverse side template that I suggested, they should all go together pretty well. If not, this may be a fun game, depending how adept you are with pastry bags.\r\n\r\nPipe the filling into the center of one side of the macaron. Do not let it go completely to the edge or it will gush out and look sloppy when you put the top on and take a bite. Ideally, macarons will sit filled for 24 hours before serving so that the shells can absorb moisture from the filling and get all nice and perfectly chewy. But who can wait? Not me. And these were spot on in my opinion. \r\n\r\nMacarons are excellent do-ahead desserts for the busy holiday season. You can keep them at room temperature for several days or up to a week in the fridge. They can also be frozen. The shells alone or the assembled macarons last in an airtight container in the freezer for up to six months. Let them defrost in fridge then bring to room temperature."

If all goes as planned, the water should barely stop boiling, but if it takes a second or two, don't worry. Cook the beans just until they turn vibrant green and are just tender. Lean on the al dente side for good measure. Remove them from the water immediately and place them directly into the ice bath making sure all the beans are submerged. By doing this you have immediately stopped the cooking process and prevented the beans from becoming too soft.",

When you're ready, divide into manageable portions and roll out into a thin layer, about 1/4 inch thick. Cut into disks, 3 to 4 inches in diameter. Keep these disks humid by stacking them with with plastic wrap between each disk and covering the entire pile. You can refrigerate these while making the filling.",

Boil the eggs for about 8 minutes, let cool, peel, and chop and set aside.

Continue stirring while the onions cook for about a minute, then turn down the heat to medium low and let the onions cook for about 6 minutes, stirring occasionally.",

If you have a rich chicken stock, made using a ham bone or a slice of ham or prosciutto which you've roasted with the chicken pieces or bones (if you roast before making your stock) or included in the stock itself while cooking, use it to make the polenta. It's the best way to make polenta taste great without adding a lot of butter, cream and cheese. I usually add a tablespoon or two of grated pecorino romano anyway though, even when using the rich stock, to round out the flavor.",
      "To make this vegetarian, omit the ham, but add a bay leaf and 1/4 cup of celery, finely chopped, a minute or two after adding the onions. And use vegetable stock instead of chicken stock. If you are serving both carnivores and vegetarians, add a bay leaf when you add the mushrooms back to the skillet. Then, take some of the ragu out for the vegetarian (or vice versa) right before adding the chicken stock; then add the ham with the stock to the carnivore's pot. Add some vegetable stock and simmer with the finely chopped celery.",

    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "First, prepare the pasta dough. Get a small pot of water on the stove and bring it to a boil. Have a bowl filled with ice water handy. Boil the mint leaves for about a minute and then transfer them with a slotted spoon right into the ice water to stop the cooking. It's the same as when you blanch vegetables! Take the leaves and either put them into a mortar, or into a food processor. If you are using a mortar, crush the leaves thoroughly with the pestle to make them into a paste. If you want to use the processor, you are basically going to puree the mint leaves into the same paste consistency.",
      "Take the flour and make it into a large well. Crack the eggs into the center of the well, along with the mint leaf paste and pinch of salt. Using a fork, beat the eggs while slowly incorporating the flour without breaking the well. Once a dough starts to form, bring it all together with your hands into a big ball of dough. Knead the pasta dough for about 2-3 minutes to really make sure it is beautiful and uniform. Wrap it in plastic, and let it rest for an hour. This lets the gluten in the flour relax to make it really tender.",
      "While the dough rests, prepare the spiced lamb ragu. Get a large pot on the stove and heat the olive oil in it over medium high heat. Brown the lamb until completely cooked through. While it is cooking, season it and spice it up with the coriander, cinnamon, salt, cumin, ginger, and red pepper flakes. Add in the onion and let it get soft and fragrant. Next, add in the garlic and tomato paste and let them cook for about 30 seconds. Then pour in the sriracha, Worcestershire and red wine. Give everything a big stir and let the mixture simmer for about 5 minutes to let the alcohol in the wine cook off. Pour in the crushed tomato and bring the mixture to a boil. Give it another big stir and reduce it to a simmer. Let the spiced lamb ragu simmer for an hour to let the flavors meld beautifully.",
      "Get a large pot of water on the stove to boil for the pasta and salt it until it tastes like the sea. When the dough is rested, it's time to roll it out. This is the most fun part! First cut the ball of dough into quarters. Then roll out each quarter super thin, until you can almost see your hand through it. I use a pasta roller attachment on my kitchen aid mixer and it is fantastic! See my post on fresh pasta making to get detailed instructions on how to roll out and cut the pasta. Each quarter will get so long that it will need to be cut in half to be the right length, so you will end up with 8 sheets of pasta. You can cut each sheet into ribbons by hand (that's what fettuccine means, little ribbons!) or use the fettuccine cutting attachment that usually comes with the pasta roller.",
      "By this time, the water should be boiling and the spiced lamb ragu should be ready! Get the fettuccine into the boiling water to cook, it will only take about a minute. Then drain it and add it into the pot with the spiced lamb ragu. Toss everything together thoroughly for about a minute, then take the pot off of the heat. You're ready to serve! Plate the pasta and sprinkle some of the little ribbons of fresh mint on top for a pretty pop of green. Enjoy and buon appetito!"

You should be able to lift it out of the pan quite easily with a spatula. This is best eaten the same day it's baked. I don't even let mine cool; it's a bit messier, but I can't help myself."

Crackers and other vegetables are great additions as well.",
      "Stuffed Portobello Mushrooms //\r\n1.)\tCut off stems of mushrooms. \r\n2.)\tDrizzle the mushrooms with olive oil and balsamic vinaigrette\r\n3.)\tPlace mushrooms in oven for 10 minutes at 350 degrees\r\n4.)\tCut up tomatoes and stack tomato, mozzarella cheese one after the other in the mushrooms. Place a hump of cheese on the top. Trust me, don't be stingy on the cheese.\r\n5.)\tCook for another ten minutes\r\n6.)\tAdd the roasted peppers on top and finish off with more mozzarella cheese. Cook for 5 minutes\r\n7.)\tSmell the goodness, but don't eat yet. With hold. Drizzle the tomato bisque soup over the beautiful stacks\r\n8.)\tGarnish with parsley, Italian oregano and salt and pepper",
      "Vegetable Salad//\r\n1.)\tUse large pan and drizzle olive oil on the bottom. \r\n2.)\tPlace the vegetables spread out in the pan. Be creative, add your favorite greens! Season with all the above seasoning. Bake for thirty minutes at 350 or until nice and soft\r\n3.)\tTake 1/3 of the vegetables and place on top of the Spring Lettuce mix in desired bowl.\r\n4.)\tTop with pecans, crasins and edamame and use the Brianna's dressing",
      "Eggplant Boats //\r\n1.)\tCut the eggplants in half horizontally and core out the middle (this is where you get the eggplant to dip into the hummus, again reusing- see the theme ) \r\n2.)\tDrizzle balsamic vinaigrette and olive oil on the eggplant boats. Put in oven at 350 and bake for ten minutes. These will be in while the vegetables are baking as well.\r\n3.)\tIn a pan, cook your chosen ground meat. Be sure to drain the oil and season with your desired seasonings.\r\n4.)\tMeanwhile, add your first layer of vegetables to the eggplant boats. Put cheese on them. Bake for ten more minutes. You can still have both vegetables cooking at the same time. I just like the eggplant to absorb the first layer of vegetables\r\n5.)\tWith the nearly finished ground beef, evenly distribute it throughout the eggplant boats. Cook for ten more minutes.\r\n6.)\tTop the last of the vegetables in the eggplants and cook for ten more minutes.\r\n7.)\tTake out your finished product and drizzle your desired amount of tomato soup as well as more balsamic dressing (I'm all about the dips)\r\n8.)\tVoila, you got yourself an eggplant boat!"

Dump squash on trays and toss in oil. Roast at 400 rotating sheets and switching top and bottom every five minutes until squash has darkly browned on edges. Once slightly cooled, place in food processor, add a half cup of milk and the cornstarch and process till smooth. Store or use.",

Don't go crazy with flour; the rue should be liquidy. Also, don't panic, the rue should be liquidy. Add the hot milk gradually to the rue and also add 1/4 - 1/2 C parm cheese. You might try the bechamel with nutmeg instead of squash although this may be too many tastes. Remove the sage leaves.",

Wet fingers and smoosh squash down to an even layer. Top with parmesan cheese and a layer of noodles. Now add the seitan etc. filling, distribute even and top with parm. cheese. Another layer of noodles. For the second squash layer, dilute the squash a little with about 1/4 C milk. This is just to provide more cooking liquid to cook the noodles and bind the thing together. Spread squash over noodles. Top with parm cheese and another layer of noodles. Now add about 2/3 or 3/4 of the bechamel and top with parm and more noodles. Now add the rest of the bechamel and some more parm cheese, why not?",

      "PLEASE NOTE: If you prefer to use your own pizza dough, by all means do so. Just fry up the bacon and then cook the onions in a bit of the fat, and skip down to the pizza assembly instructions.",
      "Proof the yeast in 2 tablespoons of warm water with the pinch of sugar. Set aside.",
      "In a heavy skillet over medium heat, cook the bacon. Make sure the pan doesn't get too hot, lest the sugar from the bacon burns in the pan.",
      "When the bacon is done, remove and save the bacon, drain off and reserve most of the fat, and add the sliced onions. Cook over medium heat until they just begin to turn a light golden color. They shouldn't get too dark.",
      "Remove the onions - you will use them on the pizza -- and use 1/4 cup of the wine to deglaze the pan, scraping up whatever bits you can. Bring to a boil, then turn off. Pour off, with all of the little bits, into a liquid measuring cup and add the remaining 1/2 cup of wine, plus enough cold water to make 1 cup total.",
      "Put the wine and water mixture, the honey, olive oil, salt, wheat germ and one cup of flour in a large bowl. Stir it well to combine.",
      "Add the yeast and water mixture and beat well.",
      "Stir the baking soda into the remaining two cups of flour and add to the dough. Stir, using the back of the spoon to press the flour into the dough to combine. When it becomes too difficult to stir, dump everything from the bowl onto your kneading surface and begin kneading to incorporate all of the flour from the bowl.",
      "Continue to knead for about ten or twelve minutes, until the dough is smooth and elastic. You may need to add up to another 1/4 to 1/2 cup of flour, a bit at a time, while kneading. Don't add too much, or the dough will be flat and tough.",
      "Put the ball of dough into a well-oiled bowl, turn it over to coat thoroughly, cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a damp tea towel, and let the dough rise until it doubles in volume.",
      "After the dough has risen, punch it down and let it rest while you prepare the topping ingredients. I typically let it rest outside of the bowl, on a piece of parchment paper.",
      "Preheat oven to 475 degrees Fahrenheit. Put pizza stones, if using, on the middle racks to preheat with the oven. Don't put the pizzas in until at least twenty minutes after the oven has reached 475 degrees.",
      "In 1-2 tablespoons of the reserved bacon fat (or olive oil, if you prefer), saute the celery slices. After a minute or two, add the cooked onion and stir well, continuing to cook over medium heat. Add the thyme leaves. (If not using the white wine dough, saute the onion at this point, until translucent, then add the celery, and when it's bright green, add the thyme.)",
      "When the celery is bright green (another minute or two at most), remove from the heat and add the cream. Toss well to coat.",
      "Cut the bacon slices into one-inch square pieces. Blanche the broccolini by plunging it in boiling water for one minute, then draining and immersing in very cold water. After a minute or so, drain again and lay out on a towel to dry a bit more.",
      "TO MAKE EACH PIZZA: \r\nRoll out half the pizza dough into whatever size and shape you prefer. I then put it on a large piece of parchment paper because it's so easy just to put the whole thing on the pizza stone, and the crust doesn't seem at all affected.",
      "Put the onion, celery and thyme mixture on first, then the corn, then the broccolini or arugula, if using, then the bacon pieces.",
      "(If using cheese, add it last.)",
      "Brush the outside edge of the dough with olive oil.",
      "Cook on the hot pizza stones for about 8 - 10 minutes. Check after 8, as they may be ready then. Cooking could also take longer, depending on the efficiency and calibration of your oven.",
      "Enjoy!! ;o)"

      "To make the Preferment: Heat the milk in a small saucepan until it is just warmed through, about 80-90 degrees. Pour the milk into a medium bowl and stir in the yeast until dissolved. Add the flour and stir the mixture with a wooden spoon until a smooth, but sticky dough forms. Cover the bowl with cheesecloth or plastic wrap and let the mixture rise until it has almost doubled in volume. This will take 2-3 hours at room temperature or overnight in the refrigerator.",
      "To make the Dough:Add the preferment mixture to the bowl of a stand mixer. Add the yeast and mix together on low speed with the dough hook until evenly combined. You may have to stop the mixer and scrape the dough off of the hook occasionally. When the mixture has come together, increase the speed to medium and mix for a couple of minutes.",
      "With the mixer running, slowly add in half of the milk and mix until well combined. Reduce speed to low and add the remaining milk, flour, sugar, salt and melted butter. Mix until the dough comes together, about 3 minutes. Turn off the mixer and let the dough rest for 15-20 minutes, loosely covered.",
      "Turn the mixer back on low speed and mix the dough until it is smooth and elastic, no more than 4 minutes. If the dough seems very firm, add in more milk, 1 tablespoon at a time. I added a tablespoon or two. Make sure to not overmix the dough as over-mixed dough will result in tough, glutenous croissants that are difficult to roll out. Cover the bowl with cheesecloth or plastic wrap and let it rise until the volume increases by half, about 1 1/2 hours.",
      "Lightly flour a work surface and transfer the dough to the surface. Gently press the dough into a rectangle 2'' thick. Wrap the rectangle in plastic wrap and place it in the refrigerator to chill for 4-6 hours.",
      "To Laminate the Dough with Butter: About 1 hour before you are ready to start rolling and laminating the dough, take the roll-in butter and place it in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Mix the butter on medium low speed until it is malleable but not warm or soft. Turn the soft butter onto a piece of plastic wrap and wrap it up. Place it in the refrigerator to stay cool, but don't let it harden completely.",
      "Lightly dust a work surface with flour and place the rectangle of chilled dough on it. Roll the dough into a rectangle 28 inches by 12 inches.",
      "With the long side of the rectangle facing you, and starting from the left side, use your fingers to gently and evenly spread the butter over 2/3 of the rectangle, leaving the far right side butter-less. Fold the un-buttered third of the dough over the butter, then fold the left-hand third over the center, like a letter. Gently pinch all of the seams of the dough to hold the butter in place.",
      "Give the rectangle a quarter turn so that the end seams are to your right and left and the long edge of the dough is facing you. Again, roll the dough into a 28 inch by 12 inch rectangle, being careful to not break the seams holding the butter in. Fold the rectangle into thirds and transfer to a lightly floured quarter sheet pan. Wrap tightly in plastic wrap and let the dough rest in the refrigerator for 1 1/2-2 hours before making the final turn.",
      "Lightly flour a work surface and place the refrigerated dough on top. Again, roll the dough to a 28 inch by 12 inch rectangle and fold it into thirds. Place the rectangle back on the quarter sheet pan and wrap tightly with plastic. Place the pan in the freezer for at least one hour. If you plan to make the croissants the next morning, transfer the dough from the freezer to the fridge the night before. Alternately, you can freeze the dough for up to one week, just remember to transfer the dough to the fridge the night before you plan to bake the croissants.",
      "To FInish the Croissants: Transfer the thawed dough to a lightly floured work surface and roll it into a rectangle 32 inches by 12 inches and about 3/8 inch tall.",
      "Use a ruler to mark 4 inch intervals at the bottom of the dough. Cut the dough into long triangles, 4 inches wide at their base. If you'd like to make pain au chocolat, cut the dough into 6 inch by 4 inch rectangles.",
      "To shape the croissants, begin with the base of the triangle facing you, gently stretch the base and roll the base towards the point. To finish, grab the point, stretch it gently, and tuck it underneath the rolled dough. This will help the croissants stand tall and proud. To shape the pain au chocolat, place a baton of chocolate or a few ounces of chopped chocolate in the center of the rectangle and, starting from a long end, carefully roll the croissant. Place the croissants or pain au chocolat, seam side down on a lined baking sheet at least 2 inches apart.",
      "Loosely cover the formed pastries and let them rise until at least doubled in size, 2-3 hours, in a draft free area. The ideal ambient temperature is 75\u00b0, but a bit warmer or cooler is alright as long as the temperature is not so warm that it melts the butter in between the layers. When the croissants are finished rising the pastries should be puffy, but still a bit firm to the touch.",
      "When the croissants are ready to be baked, preheat your oven to 425\u00b0 and prepare the egg wash by whisking all of the ingredients together. About 10 minutes before you are ready to put the croissants in the oven, gently brush them with the egg wash then let the wash dry slightly before baking. Make sure to wipe up any errant drips of egg wash on the baking sheet.",
      "Place the croissants in the oven and turn down the temperature to 400\u00b0. After 10 minutes, quickly open the oven door and turn the sheet pan(s) 180\u00b0 which will help the croissants bake evenly. Bake for 6-10 more minutes or until the croissants are deep golden brown.",
      "Remove the croissants from the oven and place on a wire rack to cool. They are best enjoyed fresh and warm, but they can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for 1 day or for up to 3 days in the fridge. Genltly warm them in a 375\u00b0 oven before serving.",
      "Bonus Recipe\r\n\r\nIf you have any scraps of dough left over after cutting your triangles and rectangles DO NOT throw them away. Roll them in a mixture of 4 tablespoons sugar and 1 teaspoon of cinnamon. Then curl them up into little snails and tuck them into a muffin tin. Let them rise until they are doubled in size and bake in a 400\u00b0 oven until crisp and deep golden brown. My little cinnamon snails are pictured above with the grapefruit juice and they were such tasty little treats."

Use a rubber spatula to gently fold the meringue into the chocolate mixture until just combined. Pour into the prepared springform pan and bake for 25 minutes. Remove the cake and place on a wire rack to cool slightly. The cake will puff and crack in the oven and fall significantly as it cools. Do not turn off the oven.",

Use the spatula to gently press the meringue into the edge between the cake and the side of the pan. Both of these step will ensure the meringue creates a more successful seal. Scrape the rest of the meringue onto the cake and smooth out with the spatula. It may or may not reach the top of the springform pan, but should not extend over. Place the cake back in the oven for another 25 minutes. The meringue will expand dramatically, crack and brown slightly, but will fall significantly as it cools. Allow the cake to cool completely on a wire rack before chilling it in the refrigerator for an hour or so.",
      "After chilled, use your hands to crush the meringue down into the springform pan. Be assertive, but don't compact the meringue too much.

Use the knife/spatula to pry the pan bottom from the cake and peel the parchment circle off. Place the cake on a serving platter.",

Chill the cake completely before serving, approximately another hour. Using a vegetable peeler, shave the block of bittersweet chocolate directly onto the cake before slicing and enjoying.",

      "Continue to cook on low heat, spritzing and reapplying lemon pepper about every half hour, for a total time of about 3 hours, or until they begin to crisp up.",
      "You can increase the heat to 350 or so at the 3 hour mark to increase the crispiness, but make sure to check the meat against the bone to make sure you're not drying out the meat.",
      "I usually cook these for a total of about 3 - 4 hrs, but the time will vary depending on your grill setup. In the end you want crispy wings with pull-off-the-bone tender meat that is still tender and moist. These are great right off the grill, or served with a simple vinegar based coleslaw. Enjoy!!"

      "Roast the pumpkin: Pre-heat oven to 375 F. Cut the pumpkin into 8 wedges. Cut each wedge into three chunks. Place the pumpkin on a foil lined baking pan, skin side down. Using 3 tbsp butter, place a small pat on each chunk. Using 3 tbsp of brown sugar, place equal amounts onto the butter. Sprinkle liberally with spice mix and sprinkle a pinch of salt on each chunk. Bake for 30 - 45 minutes or until pumpkin is tender and browning on the edges. Remove from the oven and let cool. When cool enough to handle, cut the pumpkin flesh from the skins. Using a fork, mash enough of the pumpkin to obtain 3/4 cup. Cut the remaining pumpkin into 1\" cubes. Keep warm.",
      "While the pumpkin is roasting, make the gnocchi: Spread the ricotta on triple layered paper towel. Cover with another triple layered paper towel. Press and let sit for a few minutes. Scrape the ricotta into a bowl using a spatula. Combine ricotta, mascapone (use additional 1/4 cup parmagiano if not using the mascarpone) 3/4 cup mashed, roasted pumpkin, parmagiano, yolk and salt in large bowl. Mix well. Sprinkle 3/4 of the flour on the mixture, gently turn with spatula a few times to incorporate. Sprinkle remaining flour on top of the mixture and incorporate with the spatula. Generously flour a clean, smooth surface and dump the dough onto the flour. Flour your hands and gently knead with your fingertips, just bringing together the mixture and rolling in the dough on the surface as needed until flour is incorporated through. This only should take a minute or two. Any longer and you will be over-kneading. The dough will still be a bit sticky.",

Take one part and roll into a 1\" diameter log (begin from center and work your way out to the ends). Cut each gnoccho into 1 1/2\" pieces (a bench cutter seems to work best for me). Make an indentation into each gnoccho with the tip of your finger. (Alternately, a traditional method is to press the tines of fork into the gnoccho to create ridges.). Place parchment or wax paper on a baking sheet, dust the cut gnocchi with a little flour and place the gnocchi onto the sheet. Refrigerate them while you braise the brussel sprouts, or you can freeze the gnocchi and place them in a freezer bag for use at a later time.",

Add sprouts to the pan, cut side down and saute for 4 minutes or until sprouts begin to brown on bottom (Don't crowd the sprouts, you may need to do this in two batches. If cooked in one batch, you may need to add additional butter to the pan). Add 1/3 to 1/2 cup chicken stock (depending on size of pan), ensuring the sprouts are surrounded by liquid. Shake the pan to distribute evenly, cover and cook for another 10 minutes (for fresh sprouts, shorter if using frozen sprouts). Remove the cover and continue to cook until all stock is evaporated and the sprouts are tender and bottoms are nicely caramelized. (Add a few splashes of stock if pan is too dry and sprouts haven't fully cooked yet). Season to taste with salt and pepper. Remove the sprouts to a bowl and keep warm. Deglaze the pan with a small amount of chicken stock and remove from heat.",
      "Put it all together: Remove the gnocchi from the freezer. (Note, a typical serving size for this dish is about 15 gnocchi per person). In the same pan you cooked the Brussel sprouts in, heat 2 tbsp butter over medium low heat. As the butter cooks, add about 15 gnocchi at a time to the pot of boiling water. Cook for about 1 - 2 minutes until gnocchi float to the surface. Don't overcook or the gnocchi will begin to fall apart. Using a wire basket or slotted spoon, remove the gnocchi as they float to the surface and place them into the pan with the browning butter. Keep heat at medium low. Lightly brown the gnocchi, use a spatula to flip. Add another serving size of gnocchi in the same manner as you brown the first batch. Add more butter to the pan as needed. Once the first half of the gnocchi are cooked, add 1 1/2 tsp chopped sage, half of the Brussel sprouts, 1 1/2 cups reserved roasted pumpkin chunks, and half the chestnuts, some additional butter if desired and a splash of stock and continue to cook until heated through. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Divide equally into two serving bowls. Keep warm. Repeat with the remaining gnocchi, sprouts, pumpkin and chestnuts. Top each serving with pancetta and fried sage leaf."

      "When you are ready to make the crepes, locate your widest, flattest non-stick pan. Using a paper towel, rub a thin sheen of butter all over the pan, and then set it over medium heat. (You can repeat this for every new crepe, but it usually isn't necessary.)",
      "When the pan is hot, use a ladle to quickly drop a measure of the batter into the pan. Turn the pan in a wide circle, as quickly as you can, so that the batter distributes evenly and rapidly. You want as thin a pancake as possible. Don't worry if the first one is a disaster; it's part of the process. Save the disasters for yourself. You will get better with each crepe.",
      "As the crepes cook, pile them on a plate; you want to cook all of your crepes before you start filling them.",
      "Make the ratatouille: Heat some olive oil in a wide pan or Dutch oven. Add the minced garlic. When the garlic is fragrant, add the onion. When the onion is translucent, add the carrot. And so on and so forth; add the eggplant, the zucchini, the wine, the herbs, and the crushed tomato.",
      "Cover the pan a bit, and let the ratatouille simmer over low heat for a while. Add the white beans, and let it simmer for a while longer. It's ok if the beans start to fall apart a little. The ratatouille can be made up to a few days ahead of time, and honestly, it tastes better with a little age.",
      "Fry your eggs: In a non-stick skillet, heat some more of that good quality olive oil. When the pan is quite warm, crack the egg. Sprinkle some salt and pepper onto the egg as it cooks. Cook one egg at a time, moving them to a small plate near the stove top as you go.",
      "Prepare the crepe: In your egg pan, lay down one of the buckwheat crepes, so it heats up a little. Layer: the ham, the ratatouille, the cheese (you want it to melt a little) and then the egg. Garnish the whole thing with chives, and a little drizzle of olive oil, if you like."

You'll need an additional 1/4 - 1/2 cup of flour, depending on the moisture level of the cheese; add that flour once the cheese and potato have been incorporated into the dough, after at least 5 minutes of kneading. These rolls will be a bit more dense than the dry cheese and oregano variety described above (which you'll find smells and tastes for all the world like a particularly good pizza crust)."

The idea is to keep all that sweet deliciousness in there, but get rid of as much liquid as possible. When they are nice and concentrated take them out of the pan and put them aside for later use.",
      "Turn the heat to as low as it will go. While you wait for the pan to cool, whisk the egg thoroughly. Pour the eggs into the pan and move the pan around until the eggs are evenly distributed. When the eggs start to cook, using a spatula pull back some egg around the edges gently and let the uncooked egg fill in the gap. Repeat that movement maybe 4 times. Sprinkle your tomatoes, arugula, and queso fresco crumbled. Put a lid on top and be patient. The bottom will be nicely browned as the top is good and soft with slightly wilted arugula and melted cheese.",
      "Add a bit of salt and fresh cracked pepper. Fold one side on top of the other and move carefully to a plate. Serve with some tasty sourdough and garnish with a little hot sauce and lime juice."

      "When ready to make the XO Sauce, I chop three or four good sized slices of prosciutto in the food processor and put them in a large skillet with about 1/2 inch of sunflower seed oil. I cook that over medium heat until the prosciutto starts to crisp up and turn red.",
      "Meanwhile, I chop in the food processor, until it turns to paste, the soaked shrimp and scallops, along with 2 heads of garlic (cloves all peeled) and about a fat 4\" long piece of ginger that I've peeled and coarsely chopped. When that is processed to a fine paste, I dump it all into the skillet with the prosciutto, a good pinch of salt and a couple pinches of sugar, and cook for about 10-15 minutes until it's all nice and light brown, stirring thoroughly to blend all the ingredients. The recipe also calls for chilies, which you would finely chop and add with the salt and sugar. (I don't use them.) Store covered in the fridge. It keeps for at least a couple of months; the nice people over on Grubstreet.com say it lasts forever. It will be eaten long before then, of course. Once you try this, you'll immediately understand why."

My sister-in-law, Irma, taught me this and all I could think was, \"Duh, why didn't I think of that?\".\r\n\r\nSTEP 1\r\n\r\nGrab an avocado and a lime on your way out the door.\r\n\r\nSTEP 2\r\n\r\nGo to the office, log onto your computer, then head to the kitchenette. Yes, yes, get some water; must stay hydrated.\r\n\r\nSTEP 3\r\n\r\nCut the avocado in half, lengthwise. Cover the half with the seed in wrap, to save for the next day (or share with a co-worker). Cut a wedge of lime. To the other half avocado, sprinkle with sea salt (do you keep yours in your drawer?) and squeeze over the lime. \r\n\r\nSTEP 4\r\n\r\nGet to that meeting you are late for, avocado in the palm of your hand. Eat avocado, scooping with a spoon as you converse with meeting attendees. This is of course conducive behavior for some meetings and some - not; use your judgement.",

This is healthier than a \"typical\" breakfast sandwich, quick, easy to assemble and cook, but best of all, feels like a civilized breakfast that can be transported to the office with almost no effort. Share one-half with a co-worker; no need to be an oinker.",
      "STEP 1\r\n\r\nPack an English muffin (I use whole wheat), a small tomato, a few leaves fresh basil and a few slices of cheese into a travel bag. For the cheese, I switch between fresh and hard mozzarella, cheddar, Comte, gruyere, lite Jarlsberg, or whatever specialty cheese I might have picked up that week. It is extra convenient (and requires even less time) to use pre-sliced cheese (not Kraft singles) which is what I resort to on the busiest of mornings (pre-sliced cheese, not Kraft that is).\r\n\r\nSTEP 2\r\n\r\nGo to the office, log onto your computer, then head to the kitchenette.\r\nSTEP 3\r\n\r\nToast the English muffin lightly in the toaster. While it is toasting, slice the tomato, sprinkle with sea salt (which I keep at the office) and fill up a glass with ice water (to keep hydrated).\r\nSTEP 4\r\n\r\nPut the toasted muffin halves on a piece of foil and lay a slice of cheese on the top of each muffin half; top with basil leaves then tomato. Put the muffins into a toaster oven (in a pinch, use the microwave) and set it to \"toast\" which should take a few minutes for melting the cheese, during which you can begin reading emails or doing something work-related.\r\nSTEP 5\r\n\r\nEat at your desk as you read/answer emails. Be sure to wash your hands and your keyboard/mouse often.",
      "You can do this the night before and puree just before heading out the door; still do it quickly or else you have missed the whole point. If you don't have a Magic Bullet, transfer the smoothie to a glass jar with a lid after pureeing.\r\nSTEP ONE\r\nQuickly, very quickly, throw the above listed ingredients into the cup of a Magic Bullet, Vitamix or food processor and puree until smooth.\r\nSTEP 2\r\n\r\nGo to the office. Yes, you will still be logging onto your computer, then going to the kitchenette (to get water, hydrate, hydrate, hydrate).\r\n\r\nSTEP 3\r\n\r\nYou can join a meeting, head to your desk or whatever your calendar has in store for your morning. A sippy cup is usually acceptable in most of the above. It is also okay to have already finished the smoothie in the car, bus, train, subway (you get the idea). Easy! Healthy! Makes you pretty (yes, even you, pretty-boy)."

I added a little bit more stock after I pureed the Korma, and adjusted the salt and chillies for the 'heat'. Yum!"

If not, use a heavy saucepan, and be prepared to stir a bit more. Stir in a couple healthy pinches of salt and heat until the water is too hot to touch. Sprinkle in the polenta, stirring all the while. Once you've added it all, continue to stir for about a minute, to ensure there are no lumps. If using a double boiler, let it cook for about 25 more minutes, stirring ever 10 minutes of so. Otherwise, stir every 3 - 4 minutes, and keep the temperature under the saucepan very low.",

Tip the polenta into the pan, smooth it out level, cover tightly with cling wrap, and put it into the refrigerator to cool for at least 3 hours or, preferably, overnight.",

      "Add softened chiles, chipotles, onions and garlic to a blender with 2 t. kosher salt and enough of the chile infused water to barely cover. Blend thoroughly, about 20 seconds.",
      "Dry pork with a paper towel and season with salt and pepper. In a hot pan or electric pressure cooker set on saute with 1-2 T vegetable oil, brown meat, then remove from pan to a plate. Add vinegar and lime juice to deglaze the pan, then add meat and any juices on the plate back into the pot, followed by the chile puree and the bay leaf. Using tongs, turn pork pieces to coat with the puree. Add another teaspoon kosher salt.",
      "At this point you have three options for how to cook the meat. 1) electric pressure cooker on high for 33 minutes followed by 15 minutes natural release, 2) slow cooker on low for 3-4 hours, 3) dutch oven covered in a 375 degree oven for 1.5-2 hours.",
      "Once the meat is very tender, remove to a bowl and shred using two forks. Leave the sauce on to reduce while you're shredding. In an electric pressure cooker this means turning it back to the saute function. With a slow cooker you should pour the sauce into a saucepan and reduce over medium-low heat with the lid off. In a dutch oven you should do the same, using the same pot you cooked everything in.",
      "Add meat back into sauce and stir to further shred the meat and coat it in the chile sauce. Reduce further if you feel it is necessary. Don't worry about continuing to cook it, you would have to try very hard to make the meat dry at this point.",
      "For the salsa combine all ingredients except the diced onion to a blender and blend. Pour into a bowl or storage container and stir in onion. Really...that's it!",
      "For the tacos warmtortilla in a comal, cast iron pan, or directly over a low flame until it has a few char marks. Top with some of the shredded meat and salsa. Other optional toppings include shredded cabbage, diced onion and cilantro."

Empty the seeds into the ramekin and slice the chile lengthwise down it's side opening it up. Discard any remaining seeds and the white ribs. Slice lengthwise down the other side of the chile, creating two flat pieces. Repeat.",
      "After all of the chiles have been processed, on a skillet over high heat toast each of the chiles in small batches. Don't crowd the chiles! Slight blistering of the skin side, and slight browning of the flesh side is all we're going for and it happens in seconds. In other words- don't walk away from this. If they get overcooked they'll be bitter. Take the water off the heat to cool. Place toasted chiles in colander as they're done.",
      "After everyone is nice and toasted, cover the chiles in the hot - not boiling- water for twenty to forty minutes. But, don't sit down, or remove your gloves.",
      "Reduce the heat to medium-low and add a little olive oil to the skillet. Saute the onion until just translucent. Add the garlic and reduce the heat. Let this go just until the garlic is fragrant. You're not trying to cook the vegetables, you're just trying to scare them.",
      "Pulse the garlic, onion, lemon and lime juices, vinegar, paprika, cumin, coriander, salt and pepper together in a food processor or blender until a very fine, almost liquid consistency is achieved. Thin with water if you have to, but don't use the soaking liquid from the peppers. Reserve one quarter of this mixture.",
      "Your gloves should still be on when you discard the soaking water and gently press the water out of the chiles. After a rough chop, toss them with salt and cover the colander with plastic wrap. Set a mixing bowl on top of the covered chiles and allow to drain for ten minutes.",
      "Unless you have a giant food processor, work in batches pureeing the drained chiles into a thick paste. Combine everything in a mixing bowl as it comes out of the processor. Tasting the sauce now you'll discover that it's either bland, or bitter, or perhaps too sweet. Don't worry, you have not erred. And, you still can't sit down or take off the gloves.",
      "What you have now needs to be reduced over very low heat. Slowly. Put the quarter cup of stock in the pan and stir in the sauce. Keep stirring, keep tasting and you'll notice the heat and sweetness develop a real richness in the sauce. The longer you can let this go, the better developed your sauce will be. However, you can't very well reduce it to nothing and you don't want to burn it. Fifteen or twenty minutes should be fine.",
      "Remove from heat and add reserved mixture of aromatics for that final punch of brightness. Taste and add salt, citrus or vinegar to your liking. If you want more heat, grind some of the reserved seeds and add in small amounts. Now would be the time to press through a fine mesh sieve. I don't do that, but but if you want a really fine sauce, sieve away. Better yet: food mill.",

If you made extra, spoon it into ice cube trays and you'll have it on hand for months. Add it to literally anything you want to give a little heat. Sauces, salsas, soups, dressings, marinades, breads, whatever. Oh, but don't take your gloves off yet.",
      "Wash everything you touched with warm soapy water, or put it straight into the dishwasher. Don't forget cabinet and drawer pulls, refrigerator doors, spice containers, olive oil bottles, and so on and so forth. Remember what I said about Mise en place?"

      "DAY 1: Place the lemon eighths in a nonreactive saucepan where they will fit snugly in a single layer. Add enough cold water for the fruit to bob freely. Cover tightly and let rest overnight at room temperature.",
      "DAY 1: In a separate nonreactive saucepan, place the sliced oranges with water to reach 1 inch above the tops. Cover tightly and let rest overnight at room temperature.",
      "DAY 2: Prepare the cooked lemon juice: Bring the pan with the lemon eighths to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to medium. Cook the fruit at a lively simmer, covered, for 2 to 3 hours, or until the lemons are very soft and the liquid has become slightly syrupy. As the lemons cook, press down on them gently with a spoon every 30 minutes or so, adding a little more water if necessary. The water level should stay consistently high enough for the fruit to remain well-submerged as it cooks.",
      "DAY 2: When the lemons are finished cooking, strain their juice by pouring the hot fruit and liquid into a medium strainer or colander suspended over a heatproof storage container or nonreactive saucepan. Cover the entire setup well with plastic wrap and let drip overnight at room temperature.",
      "DAY 2: Meanwhile, prepare the orange slices: Bring the pan with them to a boil over high heat, then decrease the heat to medium and cook, covered, at a lively simmer for 30 to 40 minutes, or until the fruit is very tender. If necessary, add a little more water during the cooking; the fruit should remain submerged throughout the cooking process. When the oranges have finished cooking, remove the pan from heat, cover tightly, and let rest overnight at room temperature.",
      "DAY 3: Place a saucer with five metal teaspoons in a flat place in your freezer for testing the marmalade later.",
      "DAY 3: Remove the plastic wrap from the lemon eighths and their juice and discard the lemons. Strain the juice through a very fine mesh strainer to remove any lingering solids.",
      "DAY 3: In a large mixing bowl, combine the sugar, cooked lemon juice, fresh lemon juice, and orange slices and their liquid, stirring well. Transfer the mixture to an 11-quart copper preserving pan or a wide nonreactive kettle.",
      "DAY 3: Bring the mixture to a boil over high heat. Cook at a rapid boil until the setting point is reached; this will take a minimum of 30 minutes, but may take longer, depending on your individual stove and pan. Initially, the mixture will bubble gently for several minutes; then, as more moisture cooks out of it and its sugar concentration increases, it will begin foaming. Do not stir it at all during the initial bubbling; then, once it starts to foam, stir it gently every few minutes with a heatproof rubber spatula. As it gets close to being done, stir it slowly every minute or two to prevent burning, decreasing the heat a tiny bit if necessary. The marmalade is ready for testing when its color darkens slightly and its bubbles become very small.",
      "DAY 3: To test the marmalade for doneness, remove it from the heat and carefully transfer a small representative half-spoonful of marmalade onto one of your frozen spoons. It should look shiny, with tiny bubbles throughout. Replace the spoon in the freezer for 3 to 4 minutes, then remove and carefully feel the underside of the spoon. It should be neither warm nor cold; if still warm, return it to the freezer for a moment. Tilt the spoon vertically to see whether the marmalade runs; if it does not run, and if its top layer has thickened to a jelly consistency, it is done. If it runs, cook it for another few minutes, stirring, and test again, repeating more times if necessary.",
      "DAY 3: When the marmalade has finished cooking, turn off the heat but do not stir. Using a stainless steel spoon, skim off any surface foam and discard. Pour the marmalade into sterilized jars, processing according to the manufacturer's instructions or another method of your choice."

You might be worried that the rest of the fish seems raw, but honestly this is a good thing. Once the skin has crisped flip the fish, and cook it an additional 2 (maybe 3) minutes more. Do not let it cook all the way through. The fish will continue to cook after it leaves the pan. Your goal is a succulent flesh graduating from a rare center outwards to a crispy crackly skin.",
      "Serve the fish warm or at room temperature with a slightly chilled Pinot Noir (yes, Pinot Noir... trust me). Dining alone is no excuse for a poor wine pairing."

Use dough/biscuit cutter to cut out 8 circles (I used a 2-1/2\" cutter). Place on a cookie sheet lined with a silpat or parchment paper. Sprinkle them with sugar. Use the rest of the dough to roll into 8 little balls in the palm of your hand. Each ball should be about 1-1/2\" in diameter. Roll them in sugar and place them on the baking sheet. (The disks will be the shortcake bottoms; the balls will become domed tops.)",

Simmer for 30 seconds and turn off the heat. Let it steep for 30 minutes. Rewarm to a liquidy sauce consistency over low heat when ready to build the shortcakes.",
      "Make the whipped topping by first whipping the cream until almost firm peaks. Add the creme fraiche, lemon juice and a pinch of salt. Continue to whip until firm peaks. Set aside.",
      "To grill the pluots, preheat the grill until the rack is very hot. Baste the cut side of the fruit with grapeseed oil and place, cut side down over direct heat. Let the fruit cook for a good 4-5 minutes. Baste the bottoms with the grapeseed oil and turn the fruit over and move to indirect heat. Continue to cook another 10 minutes or until the fruit is softened.",
      "To build the dish, place a shortcake disk on the plate and top it with 2 grilled halves of the pluot. Pour some warm Thyme-Caramel over them. Place a domed shortcake piece (formed from the shortcake balls) on top. Add a dollop of the whipped cream. Pour some champagne or a glass of port and celebrate life."

Pour batter into the3 floured-buttered pans and bake about 20 minutes. Ovens are different and you will want to check to see if the cake is done--it should be golden on top and spring back lightly when touched. Do not overbake because it will dry out easily. When done, set the cakes on a rack to cool completely. If the layers are still warm the topping will melt!",
      "Pick out a nice plate and place the first layer, spoon 13 the topping over it--drips down the side are fine. The topping should be thickened when cool. Layer 1/3 third of the berries and make sure they peek out at the edge, then top with the second and third layers and repeat. I like to gather the blueberries in the middle and surround them with strawberry halves. Be sure to store in the fridge or cooler until serving."

I have even wrapped these in foil and heated them over charcoals or a campfire...such a treat when out on the trail!"

      "Add the water and bump up the heat to medium-high and bring to a boil. Skim off any impurities and reduce to a simmer for about 20 minutes.",
      "Make jidan: In 2 separate bowls, whisk the yolks and the whites. Add 1 teaspoon of vegetable oil to a small to medium nonstick pan, and heat over medium-low heat. When heat, pour the yolks into the pan, spreading evenly. Turn off heat. Let it sit in the pan for a minute before flipping and letting sit a minute more. Remove from heat. Repeat process for the whites. After slightly cooled, slice yellow and white omelettes, separately, in half and then into thin strips, about matchstick-sized. Set aside.",
      "Drain the dduk from the water, and add them to the broth. Be careful not to walk away for too long at this point! It will cook rather quickly, just 3 to 5 minutes more, depending on your taste. Dduk should not be al dente, but should definitely not be mushy or gummy either.",
      "Right before you think the dduk is ready, add the scallions to soften in the soup. Add the Korean soup soy sauce. (If you don't have this, add regular soy sauce; note this will make your broth a bit darker.)",
      "Turn off the heat. Slowly drizzle in the 3 lightly beaten eggs, without touching the soup for about 10 seconds before going in with a wooden spoon and gently creating beautiful, airy egg strands (this is seriously my favorite part!). Add the sesame oil to the soup and lightly stir.",
      "Ladle dduk guk into large bowls. Top with cut-up seaweed; yellow and white jidan; and chopped scallion to garnish. Season with more Korean soup soy sauce (or regular soy sauce, or salt), and freshly cracked black pepper, if you'd like."

Next, place the jar in a dark place (I put mine in the pantry), and leave it for 12 to 24 hours, until you see that the liquid is beginning to separate into curds and whey.\r\n\r\nKeep in mind that the mixture will ferment quickly in the summer , but at colder temperatures, this process will take longer. Avoid making the kefir in rooms hotter than 90\u00b0 F; at this temperature, the milk might spoil before the grains can culture it.",
      "After the mixture has been sitting, pour the entire contents of jar into a plastic sieve placed over a bowl. Gently shake the sieve from side to side to encourage the kefir to drain through. If I have left the jar a little bit too long and really solid bits have formed, I let the sieve rest in the bowl of drained whey. I mix the solid parts gently back into the grains until the really firm curds are loosened, and then I re-strain the liquid.",
      "The strained kefir is then ready to use. Drink it plain or sweetened, or use it in place of milk, yogurt, or buttermilk in your baking and cooking. It can also be stored in the fridge for up to a week.",
      "Then, use the strained kefir grains to make your new batch in a clean jar. There's no need to rinse the grains between batches.",
      "NOTES:\r\nYou can make as little or as much kefir as you want: I usually make 1/2 liter every other day. If you want to slow things down a bit, let the mixture ferment in the fridge instead of in the pantry.",
      "If you only have a tablespoon or two of grains to begin, just use a cup or two of milk until your grains have multiplied enough to ferment more milk.",
      "Excess kefir grains can be frozen: Rinse them well, pat them dry on a clean cloth, coat them lightly in in milk powder, and then freeze them in a double-lined plastic bag. Keep in mind, however, that frozen kefir grains may take up to three months of fermentation before they produce consistently good batches of milk kefir."

    "ingredients": [],

      "Begin by heating the 2 tbsps olive oil in a large dutch oven over medium high heat. Pat the brisket dry and season with salt pepper and smoked paprika. Once the oil is hot, sear the brisket on all sides and remove from the dutch oven when brown all over.",
      "Reduce heat to medium, add yellow onions and an additional olive oil if necessary to prevent sticking. Cook the onions until glassy. Deglaze the dutch oven by adding the beef stock. Return the brisket to the dutch oven and add whole black peppercorns. Cover the pot, increase heat and bring liquid to a boil. Once boiling, reduce heat to a low simmer and cook for 2.5-4 hours or until the brisket pulls apart very easily. Be mindful that you are left with some liquid in the pan. I check for doneness after about 2.5 hours and then every half hour to see if I can pull it apart yet. (You can add more broth if ever you see you are risking full evaporation.",
      "Turn the heat off and shred brisket with two forks so it absorbs the rest of the liquid and the jam-y onions.",
      "Caramelized red onions: \r\nWhile brisket is cooking, you can caramelize your red onions. Thinly slice onions and add to a medium saucepan with a quarter cup of red wine vinegar and set over medium heat.",
      "Close the lid and let steam until onions are steamed in vinegar and glassy. Now, leave lid off, reduce the heat to medium low and cook slowly, caramelizing the onions until they are soft and jammy. I add a salt and sugar towards the end of the caramelization process and taste for sweetness. Remove from heat and set aside.",
      "Guasacaca:\r\nPut peppers, avocado, salt, pepper, cilantro, parsley, vinegar, onion, garlic into a food processor and process until mostly smooth. Add the olive oil in a stream with the processor running and process until creamy. Let stand at room temperature for at least 1 hour for the flavors to blend. Taste and adjust seasoning.",
      "To assemble:\r\nMake Arepa dough and cook according to package instructions. I usually calculate 2-3 per person depending on how large you make the patties. (What the bag does not tell you is how to test for \"done-ness\". I like to tap on my arepas with a knife right after flipping them over the first time. Once you know what this sounds like, tap on them again when they are closer to the end of their cook time (8-10 min) and you should here a deeper, hollower sounding tap that indicates they are ready to remove from the pan.)\r\nSlice them open while warm and fill with a slice of cheese so it begins to melt. Continue with the rest of the arepas. \r\nI then assemble the arepas with a spoon full of the brisket meat, top with a dollop of guasacaca, mojo and the caramelized red onions.\r\nEnjoy!"

    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "Preheat the oven to 425F. On a rimmed baking sheet, toss the cubed celery root with salt, black pepper, and the celery seed and drizzle with olive oil, tossing well to coat. Bake 20 - 25 minutes, until brown on the edges. Allow to cool slightly before adding to the salad.",
      "While the celery root cooks, make the dressing. First, rub the garlic clove all around inside the bowl you'll be serving the salad in. Then, mince the garlic (I find a pinch of salt makes a finer mince) and combine with the mayonnaise through orange juice (if you must stick to the classic, the juice of 1 lemon works in lieu of the orange). Whisk well to combine, then slowly drizzle in the olive oil, whisking continuously. Gently stir in the Parmesan cheese.",
      "Chop the romaine into bite-sized pieces and fill the salad bowl that has been pre-rubbed with garlic. Top with the roasted celery root, hard-boiled egg slices, and croutons (and extra shavings of Parmesan if you'd like!) Toss with the dressing and enjoy!",
      "Cook's note: my favorite method of making hard boiled eggs is to cover by 1 inch with cold water, bring to a gentle boil uncovered and cook at the boil 6 minutes, uncovered. Then remove from heat, cover with a lid, and rest 6 more minutes before running under cold water until cold enough to handle and peel. \r\nTo make fresh croutons, cut day old bread into about 1 inch cubes with a serrated knife. Toss with a drizzle of olive oil, salt and pepper (and other flavorings you'd like, such as garlic or herbs) and bake in a 500 degree oven for 10 - 15 min, stirring once halfway through cooking and watching closely to avoid burning (like I frequently do.)"

Sift the salt, baking soda, baking powder and coconut flour over the egg mixture. On low speed, blend the batter as you pour in the coconut milk, again mixing until even. Batter will seem very dry. Add 1 well packed cup of the drained pineapple (you'll have some crushed fruit left over to use as you wish; reserve the juice for glaze). Fold in 1 cup of the toasted coconut until evenly distributed (reserve remaining 1/4 cup for topping; see below). Fill your muffin tins with a little more than a heaping tablespoon of batter per cup.",

      "Whisk together the powdered sugar, egg white, and pineapple juice vigorously. With the cakes upside-down, top each one with 1-2 teaspoons glaze and quickly sprinkle with a pinch of the remaining toasted coconut. If using cooling racks as you glaze, place the racks over a cookie sheet and/or parchment paper, and use a spatula to scrape up and re-use the glaze that collects below the racks.",

Take the cookie crust baking dish out of the fridge & put this cream cheese layer equally divided over the cookie crust. Spread it all out with a knife, if you need to. Arrange the cut up fig slices over the cream cheese. I used 12 thinly sliced fig parts. Place the dish back into the fridge to stiffen up, preferably all night long. Cut into 12 bars.

      "Rub the herb paste all over the pork should and into the crevices. Some people like to tie their pork shoulders up, but I generally don't, as I find you get more crispy bits that way. You certainly may, if you wish.",
      "Put the roast in a bowl you can cover or a lidded glass storage container and refrigerate for at least six hours or, preferably, overnight. Bring the meat to room temperature for about an hour before roasting.",
      "Preheat the oven the 375 degrees.",
      "Put the onion slices in a braising pan or Dutch oven. Put the meat in on top of that. Cook for about 20 minutes, then add the stock. It should come up about 1/4 of the way up the meat. If it doesn't, add a bit of water.",

      "Cook for another half hour, then turn the roast over again and add more liquid if necessary. The onions will have released quite a bit, but depending on how much space there is on the bottom of the pan, it's not uncommon for the pan to dry out. Add the carrots now, if using.",
      "Return the roast for yet another half hour, then check the meat with a fork. It should be very tender and should pull apart easily. At this point, I usually flip the roast over again and cook it for at least another 15 - 20 minutes. Make sure its internal temperature is at least 145 degrees Fahrenheit before you take it out. It probably will be more than that, if your oven is well insulated.",
      "Let the roast sit for at least 20 minutes after removing it, before slicing.",
      "The onions can be pureed with the pan juices, and more stock if you like, using an immersion or other blender, to make a nice sauce for the roast.",

On fairly high heat, brown chops on both sides, then lower the flame and cook until chops feel firm and are close to completely cooked.",

Add the stock, the cornichons and capers and when it comes to a boil, stir in the mustards and then the creme fraiche. Simmer until slightly reduced and thickened. Add the black pepper. Stir in the 3/4 of the chopped herbs, lemon zest and juice. Save about 1/4 of the herbs to sprinkle on after plating. Put the chops back into the pan, adding any juices that are on the plate. Taste the sauce and add salt, if needed--unlikely because of the brine and the many salty ingredients. Spoon the sauce over the chops, and allow the chops to cook for a few moments before plating. Be as generous as possible with the sauce. Serve with mashed potatoes or polenta."
