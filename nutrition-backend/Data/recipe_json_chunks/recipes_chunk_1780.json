      "Brush each side with vegetable oil, then sprinkle with salt and a little lime juice.",
      "Roast them over a medium-low charcoal fire (which gives them a wonderful flavor) for 15 minutes, turning occasionally, or roast them on a griddle heated to slightly lower than medium, turning, for about 20 minutes.",

      "Add in the rice and stir with a wooden spoon so which it's all well coated.",
      "There's not sufficient onion to give a heavy coating: just make sure the rice is fragrantly slicked.",
      "Pour in the reserved liquid from the jug - about 500ml - and stir before covering with the lid and cooking gently for about 15 min.",
      "If your stove is vociferous you may need a heat-diffuser.",
      "At the end of the cooking time, when the rice is tender and has lost all chalkiness, turn off the heat, remove the lid, cover the pan with a tea towel and then replace the lid.",
      "This will help absorb any extra moisture from the rice.",
      "It is also the best way to let the rice stand without getting claggy or possibly cool, that is useful when you've got a few friends and a few dishes to keep your eye on.",
      "Just before you want to eat, drain off any extra liquid which's collected in the dish with the salmon, then flake the fish with a fork.",
      "Add in to it the rice, Large eggs, coriander, lime juice and a drop or possibly two of fish sauce.",
      "Stir gently to mix - I use a couple of wooden paddles or possibly spatulas - and taste to see if you want any more lime juice or possibly fish sauce.",
      "Sprinkle over the zest from the two juiced halves of the lime and serve.",
      "I love it served just as it is in the roasting dish, but if you want to, and I often do (consistency is a requirement of a recipe but not a cook), decant into a large plate before you add in the lime zest, then surround with lime segments and add in the zest and a small handful of freshly minced coriander.",
      "This is one of those rare dishes which manages to be comforting and light at the same time.",
      "And - should you have leftovers, that I wouldn't bank on - it's heavenly eaten, as all leftovers demand to be, standing up, straight from the fridge.",
