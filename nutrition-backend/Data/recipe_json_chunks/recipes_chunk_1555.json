Place the glazed doughnuts onto a cooling rack, glaze-side-up, and top with sprinkles (or other toppings if you desire). Repeat until all the doughnuts have been dipped, flipped, and topped with sprinkles.",

      "To get started, preheat the oven to 375\u00b0F. Wash one large beet and cut off the stem and the root. Drizzle some melted coconut oil over it. Wrap tightly in aluminum foil or place in a roasting pan, partially covered. Roast for about an hour, or until you can stick a knife in it without any resistance.",
      "Let the beet cool for a few minutes, then put in a blender. Add a little bit of water and blend until you have a nice puree, adding more water as necessary. Measure out 1/2 a cup and set it aside.",
      "In a bowl, whisk together 1 cup of unsweetened vanilla almond milk and 1 tsp of apple cider vinegar. Let it sit for a few minutes and you will end up with a vegan buttermilk.",
      "Line a muffin pan with paper liners.",
      "Add the granulated sugar, melted coconut oil, vanilla extract, and the beet puree to the buttermilk mixture. Beat until foamy with a whisk or beaters.",
      "Slowly add in flour, unsweetened cocoa powder, baking soda, baking powder, and the pinch of salt to the wet ingredients mixture. Use beaters to mix everything together to ensure there are no lumps.",
      "Last step is to pour the batter into the paper liners, but only 3/4 of the way full. Bake for 22-25 minutes. Let them cool before peeling liners off or icing them.",
      "Make vanilla frosting by using powdered sugar and a little bit of So Delicious Coconut Creamer (either the original or vanilla flavor) and beating until you have the consistency you want. Pipe or spread on top. You can also dust cocoa powder or powdered sugar on top if you don't want to frost them or top with rose petals for a nice pop of color.",
      "You can easily make this recipe gluten free if you like. I would recommend a more neutral flour like brown rice flour or garbanzo bean flour, and mix in a little bit of coconut flour to thicken it."

But don't blame me if you get salmonella from the raw eggs if you end up eating the whole batter before baking it! We don't have salmonella in Norway where I live so I taste raw cookie dough all the time, but I don't want to be held accountable for eventual salmonella poisonings.

Place one layer flat-side down on a serving plate or cake stand. Place some of the berries flat side down over the cake, with the tips of the berries barely sticking out over the edge. Spread a layer of whipped cream over the berries, just enough to fill in the gaps between berries but without spreading down the sides. Whipped cream layer should cover the berries just enough so that the tops carry a thin layer. Add the next layer of cake, strawberries, and cream and continue with this process using the rest of the cake layers, berries and cream. Once the top layer of cake is applied, spread the top with a generous coat of whipped cream. Top with a heap of berries and refrigerate until serving.",
      "Serve either by slicing vertically (which is precarious), or by lifting each half of layer of cake onto a plate.",

Add a dash of cayenne pepper and simmer about 30 minutes, then drain liquid through a mesh sieve. Set aside sufficient stock for the recipe and the remainder may be frozen for future use. You can also use prepared, store bought stock.",

      "1.) I buy the 2-pound bags of frozen shrimp (\"All-Purpose\" = medium) at a club and they work great. Just put them in the fridge a day ahead to thaw.",
      "2.) This is best when the pasta is made ahead and chilled. 3.) Making the stock ahead is fine, too, but it can be used upon its completion, too.",
      "4.) I chop/slice the celery in my food processor so the pieces are small but larger slices are fine.",
      "5.) If you have found a seafood seasoning with no salt then adding a teaspoon or so of sea salt is recommended.",
      "6.) I use dried parsely as I find fresh is actually a little strong for delicate flavor of shrimp; if you prefer fresh parsley, add just a little at a time and taste test!",
      "7.) You can also use some mild chopped onion or green onions (scallions) in place of the onion powder, but just like the parsley - watch the overall amount as to not overwhelm the shrimp flavor.",
      "Boil the pasta so it is al dente, drain well and place in large container to cool down, adding the oil as soon as you put it in the container. Stir the drained pasta to evenly coat it with the oil. Allow pasta to fully cool (and if you have time, put it in the fridge to chill it awhile).",
      "In a very large mixing bowl, mix together the mayonnaise, shrimp stock, lemon juice, Old Bay, parsley, onion powder, and pepper - whisk all until well-blended. Toss in the sliced celery, the shrimp, and then the pasta. Using a large spoon, gently stir all everything is well-blended (I use a classic lift and fold mixing method)."

This is very low in fat and really does not need anything else, but if you're the type, feel free to add a little bacon grease or a spoonful or lard (can't believe the word lard is in one of my recipes!) to add creaminess.

Mix thoroughly or flour will lump when milk is added. Slowly stir in 1 cup milk and the dissolved yeast mixture. Pour entire mixture into a 1 gallon Zip-lock plastic bag. Consider this day 1 of the 10 day cycle. Leave plastic bag filled with the mixture at room temperature.",
      "On days 2 thru 4; mash the ingredients in the bag with your hands. You may periodically need to let accumulated air out of the bag; this occurs naturally as the starter ferments.",

In each of 4 separate 1 gallon-sized plastic Zip-lock bags, place 1 cup of the starter mixture to give to friends along with this recipe (Keep one bag for yourself and consider it \"Day 1\" if you want to start all over again). Use the remaining mixture to create the Super Chocolate Amish Bread as shown above."

Divide any left-over batter into muffin tins and bake separately for 15 minutes or until they test done. The cake itself bakes for 75 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the middle comes out clean. (I've baked this for as much as an extra 30 minutes, because it's still quite jiggly in the middle after 75 minutes.) After removing it from the oven, allow it to cool for 10 minutes, then turn it out onto your favorite cake plate.",

Add milk slowly, stirring constantly, and continue cooking until it comes to a boil. Boil for about a minute, then remove from heat. Allow to cool for 5 minutes, then stir in enough confectioner's sugar to achieve a good spreading or dribbling consistency, whichever you prefer. Spread or dribble this over the cake until you're satisfied with the results, and sprinkle with pecans if you like. I used candied pecans!"

When the yeast has doubled (it only takes a few minutes), add it to bowl. Mix on low speed just until the ingredients are combined.",
      "Add 4 cups flour, powdered milk, dough enhancer, and salt. Mix on a medium speed for 7-10 minutes. Turn off mixer and let mixture rest for 10 minutes.",
      "Add 2 more cups flour and mix on medium speed until ingredients are well incorporated. With mixer running, add more flour, 1/2 cup at a time, just until the dough cleans the side of the bowl. This is an important step because it marks the difference between a roll that has just the right amount of flour and one that has too much or too little flour. Turn the mixer to a higher knead setting and let the mixer do its thing for 8-10 minutes until the dough is very smooth and elastic.",
      "Turn off the mixer and let the dough rest for 10 minutes. I leave the dough in the mixer bowl. This is where you really save time on this recipe. After the dough has rested, you can start forming the rolls.",
      "Lightly butter a 9 \" x 13\" metal pan. Use a metal pan, not a glass baking dish. Pinch off enough dough to form a 1 1/2\" ball. You can vary the size of your rolls by how much dough you choose to make each one. Sometimes you might decide that you want bigger rolls if you are using these for sandwiches, sometimes you might be in the mood for something a little more traditional. Look at the amount of dough you are using for your roll and imagine it double its visible size. That's how big your finished product will be-maybe even a little bigger. I make my rolls so that I can get 4 rolls across the pan and 5 rolls lengthwise.",
      "Dip each roll into some melted butter before putting them into the pan. The butter provides two things: it allows the rolls to make a wonderful top and bottom (the corner rolls are my favorite because they have two outside browned sides, a brown bottom, and a lovely golden brown top) and the rolls separate easily from each other after they are baked.",
      "Cover the pan with plastic wrap and set the rolls in a warm place to rise. It takes about an hour for the rolls to rise; sometimes only 30-45 minutes, depending on how happy the yeast is that day. You can get some good talking done while the rolls are rising.",
      "Once the rolls have doubled in bulk, remove the plastic wrap and bake the rolls at 375\u00b0F until they are golden brown, about 20 minutes. You can brush a little more butter on them, if you want to. It makes them extra pretty.",
      "By the way, this recipe can make about 4 dozen rolls. You could make a pan of rolls and use the rest of the dough for cinnamon rolls or scones. Just a thought."

If glaze pools in corners of cake, you can maneuver some of it back to the center with a knife or spatula until it stays put. The glaze will set as it cools.",
      "Serve cake warm, at room temperature, or chilled. Store tightly covered for a day or two."

Trim away any excess dough, then use a fork to prick the crust all over. Chill for 10 minutes. Bake the tart crust until it's pale golden, 20-35 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool.

      "Every heirloom tomato is genetically unique. They are so beautiful. So many colors and fun patterns. Oh, and flavors!",
      "Turn your oven on to broil. If you have an oven that says High Broil or Low Broil, put it on Low. But if you don't, that's okay too.",
      "Oh, and make sure your baking rack is set to the medium level. We don't want it up really close to the broiler element. That would not be good.",
      "For this recipe, I selected a nice round heirloom that will make two thick slices. If you get a really large heirloom (there are many), you might be able to get three nice thick slices out of it.",
      "Cut them into thick beef-steak type slices. Place your slices on a greased cookie sheet. Drizzle the top with olive oil. Be generous.",
      "Now, sprinkle the top with kosher salt. Then sprinkle the top with freshly grated Parmesan cheese. On top of the Parmesan, place a slice of fresh mozzarella.",
      "I like to buy fresh mozzarella in little medallions. This size is perfect for topping things with. But if you can't find the medallions (slightly larger than the size of a silver dollar) then just get fresh mozzarella and slice it.",
      "Now you can put one of these medallions on top, or two. I like to put two on top. Just because it's that kind of day today.",
      "Now pop your baking sheet into the oven. Remember to have your rack set to the middle level. We don't want to have these delicate things too close to the broiler element.",
      "Keep an eye on them. Make sure your oven light is on and keep checking them. It should take about 6 minutes or so., depending on whether or not you have a High or Low Broil setting on your oven.",
      "You basically want to be sure the cheese is all melty and has a couple of brown bubbles on top.",
      "Serving suggestions:",
      "These are wonderful as a side item paired with a nice piece of fish and some roasted asparagus.",

Place the asparagus on the top rack to keep it from burning and it will cook faster than the rest of the veggies. Once veggies have gotten situated, you can shut the lid of the grill to retain the heat inside the grill. Once veggies have finished cooking (5 - 7 minutes), take them off the grill to a platter, transport inside, and cut squash into small bite sized pieces. Combine all veggies onto a dish and serve."

      "1. Make the blueberry sauce by placing the coconut milk (make sure you whisk the milk really well straight from the can, as it does separate, before measuring) and the blueberries into a small food processor (mine is 3 cups size) and process until smooth and combined. You will have some pieces of blueberry skin, which is okay.",
      "2. Pour the mixture into a small saucepan and add the honey. Bring the mixture to a boil on medium heat, stirring occasionally. Once boiling, whisk frequently and cook until the mixture reduced by 1/4, about 15-20 minutes. You want to end up with just over 1/2 cup of blueberry sauce, so I recommend measuring it out to make sure you have reduced it enough. Turn the heat off and let the blueberry sauce cool.",
      "3. While the blueberry sauce boils, preheat your oven to 350 F and line the bottom of an 8-inch square baking pan with parchment paper, rubbing coconut oil over the paper and up the sides of the pan. Set aside.",
      "4. In a large bowl, stir together the almond flour, coconut flour, salt, and baking powder until well combined. Set aside.",
      "5. In a small saucepan, melt the coconut oil and honey until bubbly and smooth. Pour the mixture into a medium bowl and add in the eggs and vanilla. Whisk until well combined.",
      "6. Pour the coconut oil mixture into the flour mixture and stir until well combined. It will be quite thick. Let the batter rest for 5 minutes and then spread it evenly into the prepared cake pan (see note). Bake until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, and the top is golden brown, about 17-18 minutes. Remove from oven.",
      "7. Immediately poke 5 rows of 5 holes in the cake, leaving some space around the outside edge, using the back of a wooden spoon. Poke the holes almost to the bottom of the cake, but leave a little bit of space. Pour the blueberry syrup (see note) over top of the center of the cake and use a spoon to gently spread it so that it fills all the holes. Try to get as much sauce as you can in the holes, and not left on top of the cake. Cover with tinfoil and refrigerate for at least 3 hours, up to overnight.",
      "8. Once the cake is cooled, flip the can of chilled coconut milk upside down and open it. Pour out the water on top (save it for a smoothie!) and scoop the chilled cream at the bottom into a large bowl. Beat it with the honey until light and fluffy.",
      "9. Spread the coconut whipped cream on top of the cake (see note) and garnish with strawberries.",
      "10. Devour.",
      "Notes:",
      "1. You will need to buy 2 cans of coconut milk to make this recipe. I tried to chill the cream once opened and use the leftovers from the blueberry sauce, as the topping, but it didn't work. Keep the remaining coconut milk and use it in a yummy recipe!",
      "2. Since the dough is thick, I found it the easiest to rub clean fingers with coconut oil and just press the batter into the pan with your hands",
      "3. You want the blueberry syrup to be as fluid as possible, so if it's ready long before your cake and begins to thicken, I recommend turning the heat on for a few minutes and letting it warm and get thinner before pouring it on the cake. It's easier to spread this way. Alternately, you can make the syrup the day before and then warm it when ready to use.",
      "4. I always like to chill cakes with coconut cream for an hour or so after spreading it on, to firm up the cake. But, this is totally up to your preference!"

Cream the butter and beat in the sugar and lemon mixture. Add the eggs, 1 at a time, and then add the lemon juice and salt. Mix until combined. Pour the mixture into a 2 quart saucepan and cook over medium-low heat until thickened (about 10 minutes), stirring constantly. The lemon curd will thicken at about 170 F, or just below simmer. Remove from the heat and cool, then refrigerate. Smooth a thin layer of lemon curd topping onto the chilled cheesecake. You will have more lemon curd than needed to cover the cheesecake. Once you put the curd on the cheesecake, refrigerate another hour before serving."

You can either spread them quickly with glaze (I just mix icing sugar with a bit of almond extract and enough milk to make it runny, about 1 cup sugar to 1-2 tablespoons milk) and sprinkles, or use royal icing to make designs. The simple glazed ones do taste better, but the royal icing looks prettier, so whichever you're going for isi fine. We like a combination!",
      "To make the royal icing, combine the meringue powder and water in the bowl of a stand mixer. Add icing sugar and mix well. Add corn syrup and almond extract and beat the mixture for 5-7 minutes until stiff peaks form. Divide the icing into different bowls depending on how many colours you want to make and tint each of them. I like to use the gel food colouring to get brighter colours. Keep any icing that you're not working with covered as it hardens quickly when exposed to the air.",
      "In order to do the decorating shown in the pictures, you need piping icing (which is what we just made) and flooding icing. To make flooding icing, you add water to the tinted icing, a teaspoon at a time, until it is thin enough that when you allow a spoonful to drizzle back into the bowl of icing, the \"ribbon\" of icing will disappear in 2-3 seconds. After tinting, I take out some of each colour and thin it out to make this flooding icing. The piping icing I then put into piping bags, and the flooding icing I put into squeeze bottles.",
      "To decorate, pipe around the edges of the cookies and then fill them in with the flooding icing, using a toothpick to spread the flooded icing right to the piped edges and to remove any air bubbles. Let that icing set for about a minute, and then you can use the other colours of flooding icing to make designs by squeezing dots or stripes onto the flooded cookie. You can then use a toothpick, dragging it through the stripes or dots to create different designs if you like.",
      "I usually work with 3-4 cookies at a time, edging all of them, then flooding all of them, then going back and adding designs to all of them. Allow the cookies to set overnight before storing them in an airtight container. They can be frozen for up to 3 months."

If you are using a grill, the peppers can be placed directly on the grates. Watch them closely and turn them every 1-2 minutes, until each side has turned completely black. You want the peppers to blister. If you are using the broiler, follow the same steps, but lay your peppers on an aluminum foil lined baking sheet. Once the peppers have blackened on all sides, remove them from your grill or broiler and transfer them to a brown paper bag (a plastic bag will work as well) or a bowl with a lid. Immediately close whichever vessel you decided to use. The steam will help loosen the skins when you go to peel them. Let them stand for about 15-20 minutes before peeling them.",
      "Preheat your oven to 375 F.",
      "Take your already roasted and peeled pasilla peppers, and cut lengthwise down one side of the pepper (start at the end opposite the stem and cut about half way up to the stem with a pair of kitchen shears or sharp knife). Remove the seeds with a spoon, pat the peppers dry and set the peppers aside.",
      "In a large mixing bowl, combine the cheeses, shrimp, shallot, red bell pepper, green bell pepper, jalapeno, cilantro and basil. Season with a dash of salt and pepper and mix until all of the ingredients are combined.",
      "Now take your roasted pasilla peppers and stuff them with the shrimp mixture. Be generous, but be careful not to tear the peppers. Once stuffed, seal the peppers shut with a toothpick. Lay your peppers on an aluminum foil lined baking sheet and bake at 375 F for 12-15 minutes or until the cheese has melted.",
      "While your peppers are baking, prepare your sauce. Remove the skins and any seeds from your roasted red bell peppers and loosely chop them with a sharp knife. Set aside.",
      "In a saute pan, over medium heat, heat the olive oil. Once hot, add the garlic, serrano, and the remaining two shallots. Cook until the shallots are tender, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a blender and add the roasted red bell peppers, vegetable broth, and a dash of salt and pepper. Blend until perfectly smooth and pureed. Transfer the sauce back to the saute pan to keep warm over medium-low heat. Stir in the heavy cream and season with more salt and pepper to your liking.",

Scoop the ball out of the candy and tap your spoon lightly on the side of the bowl to remove the excess candy and create a smooth texture.

Stir in the strawberries. Heat a large skillet or griddle over medium heat, and coat with butter or cooking spray. Pour batter into desired size of pancakes. Flip with a spatula when bubbles appear in the center. Cook until golden brown on the other side. They smell so good as they cook. The vanilla wafts up and makes the kitchen smell great. Top with fresh strawberries, syrup or jam. I ate mine with strawberry syrup. Heavenly."
