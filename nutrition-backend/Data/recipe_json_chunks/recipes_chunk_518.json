Turn dough out onto parchment paper, and tear off another piece of parchment paper to cover dough. Through the top sheet of parchment, use your hands to press the dough as thin as you can (the thinner the better). Peel off the top layer of parchment paper. Use a thin, sharp knife or a pizza cutter to score the dough into squares. (Hint: spray knife or cutter with Pam and the dough will not stick to it.) Bake for 30 minutes or until evenly browned. Break along the scored lines and store in a container with a tight lid. For those counting carbs you'll love this recipe. Each cracker contains just a trace of carbohydrates, a trace of fiber, and 1 gram of protein."
