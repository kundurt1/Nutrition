Cut into two 15 by 10 inch rectangles. Roll up each, starting with the 15 inch side. Cut each rectangle into 12 to 14 slices. Place cut side down in a well greased muffin cup or in two 9 inch pans. Let rise in warm place until light and doubled in size; 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Bake at 375\u00b0 for 12 to 15 minutes. Remove from pans immediately. Frost with butter frosting, if desired."
