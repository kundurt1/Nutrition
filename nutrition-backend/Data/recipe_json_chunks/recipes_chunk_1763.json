      "Once the full pot of water, seasonings, beef and onions is back to boiling, add your sliced potatoes.",
      "Bring back to boil and let cook for about 15-20 minutes, depending on quantity and size of your potato slices, you want to get them close to fully cooked (when you think they're ready, stab a couple of the bigger slices and see if your knife inserts easily which means they're soft enough to eat).",
