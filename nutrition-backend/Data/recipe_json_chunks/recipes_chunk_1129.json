      "Hopefully I will be able to give you each your first lot of sweet sourdough starter for AMISH BREAD as well as sourdough dough starter for SOURDOUGH BREAD, but just in case something happens where I can't for whatever reason, AMISH BREAD starter is made with 1 1/2 cup each all purpose flour, sugar and milk plus 1 package of dry yeast. Lumps aren't really an issue because they break down as the starter ferments. Stir daily and feed every 3-4 days. You will probably want to let it have a couple of feedings before you make your first batch of AMISH BREAD so you have enough starter. You can feed it as much as you like as long as it's all equal ammounts of milk, flour and sugar. The more often you bake, the more you feed it because you need 3 cups of starter per recipe with enough left over to feed and get going again. I normally feed anywhere between 1/2 cup to 1 1/2 cup each depending on how much I am baking. I keep my starter on the counter in a plastic half gallon screw top jar I got from the dollar store that I drilled a little hole in the top of. You must have some way to let out the gasses that build up durring fermentation or it will quite literally explode and that makes one horrible mess. Trust me you don't want to be cleaning that up.",

      "Notes:",
      "Do not refrigerate tomatoes, as refrigeration undermines the flavor.",
      "Though tomatoes are a fruit, they are usually pH 4.5 to 4.6, which is right on the borderline of foods you can safely process in a water bath, so you have to acidify them by adding lemon juice or citric acid if you are planning to process them in a water bath. You can do this by adding 1/4 teaspoon citric acid or 2 tablespoons lemon juice per pint. Citric acid is sold in the US under the name \"Fruit Fresh\", and can be bought at most grocery stores. If you choose to use lemon juice to acidify your tomatoes, use bottled lemon juice, because bottled commercial lemon juice has a consistent pH, and fresh lemons can vary in acidity.",
      "Sometimes you remove tomatoes from the boiling water bath canner to find that the pulp has separated from the juice. This is caused by an enzyme in the tomato that becomes activated when the tomato is exposed to air, either by skinning and/or cutting and crushing. The enzyme breaks down pectin, causing the solids and liquids to separate. The sooner the skinned, crushed or cut tomatoes are heated, the better, as heat stops the enzymatic action (this is also why you almost always blanch foods before freezing them). Regardless of separation, these tomatoes are still perfectly safe to eat.",
      "Bring a large pot of water to a boil over high heat. Drop the tomatoes into the boiling water, count off 10 seconds, and then remove.",
      "With a sharp paring knife, slit the tomato skins and peel them off. They will come off easily. Core the tomatoes and tear them in half, squeezing out the seeds. Toss into a pot. Drop the skins and seeds into a colander over a bowl. A lot of tomato juice is saved this way, which you can add to your canned tomatoes or drink fresh.",
      "Crush the tomatoes. You can use a food processor or a tomato masher. Chunks are OK.",
      "Heat the tomatoes and boil gently for 5 minutes. The tomatoes may get a bit foamy on top - that's OK.",
      "Have ready 6 pint-sized canning jars. Into each jar, place 1/4 teaspoon dried basil, 1 teaspoon of salt, 1/4 teaspoon of citric acid OR 2 tablespoons lemon juice. Ladle in the hot tomatoes, leaving 1/2 to 3/4 inch of headspace in each jar. Wipe the rims, set on the lids, and screw on the bands fingertip tight.",
      "Place the jars in a boiling water bath and add enough water to cover the jars by 3 inches. Process the tomatoes for 40 minutes, making sure that the jars are covered with at least 1 inch of water the whole time. If the jars are not covered by water at any point, you have to delete the time that the cans were not totally submerged, add water, bring back to a boil, and begin timing again, deducting any time in which the jars were not submerged.",
      "When you remove the tomatoes from the boiling water bath, if some pulp fizzes out of the jars, don't panic; they will probably still seal.",
      "Let the jars sit, undisturbed, for at least 12 hours before checking seals. It is important to let them sit undisturbed for 12 hours because the sealing compound on the lids is still cooling and hardening, completing the seal. While the jars cool, you will hear a \"plink\" type sound from each jar - this is the jars completing the vacuum seal as the final air escapes the jar. After 12 hours have passed, remove the bands and check the lids - press down in the center of the lid. If you cannot push the lid down any further, the jar is sealed. If the lid \"gives\" a bit, and you can push it down, the jar did not seal. If any jars did not seal, place them in the fridge and use within a week."

      "Here is a recipe that has the proper spice mixture. You will need to soak the corned beef! Between 2 and 4 hours and change the water every 30 minutes. The reason you never hear people talk about this is because it is usually boiled.which takes the salt out. But roasting is a whole different technique. I would leave it UNFOILED for the first couple of hours. This will create a nice bark -- the outside area that will be intensely flavored. Then you can foil and finish cooking.",
      "Cook it to an internal temperature over 185\u00b0. Unless you have a meat slicer and can slice VERY thin, cooking it to 150\u00b0 will result in a VERY tough piece of meat. The connective tissue needs to breakdown and that takes much time and occurs around 170+\u00b0. To test for doneness, use a meat thermometer or simply poke the meat -- use a fork and twist it -- it should offer no resistance.OK, that's about it! Enjoy!",

      "Wrap tightly in plastic wrap and let sit overnight in the refrigerator.",
      "Preheat oven to 250-275\u00b0.",
      "Slow cook brisket uncovered for the first 2 hours. (At this point I add approximately 4 oz of beer) , then cover with foil. You will be slow baking for an additional 1 1/2 hours per pound until done.",
      "Internal meat temperature needs to be near 185\u00b0 or above when done. It is important to use a thermometer for this part. If it is above this temperature, now worries. Just recover and keep warm until ready to eat.",

Be careful not to stir sauce to vigorously during first 20-30 minutes as that may break up your meatballs, just stir enough to make sure meatballs are completely submerged in sauce. Once 40-50 minutes has elapsed sauce should be ready to eat, as the meat should be cooked. I prefer allowing sauce to simmer on low heat for a 2-4 hours, as the longer this sauce cooks the better it tastes. The meat also absorbs more flavor from the sauce itself. As long as you cook meats at least 40-50 minutes in sauce mixture you should be fine. This does however change based on the size of the meatballs you make. I make ones around the size of a golf ball. Larger meatballs take longer to cook. You can always take one out and cut it in half to see if they are cooked through throiughly.",

      "Note: I rarely use the exact ingredient amounts. It's good to substitute black or red beans for the pinto beans or to use regular corn for shoepeg. I've used red wine vinegar in place of garlic red wine vinegar as well. You can even add hot sauce if you like spicy. I always double the recipe (but not necessarily the dressing) and eat on it for days. It's good in burritos, pitas, or on top salads, anything really. It's a very flexible recipe."
