      "Find a high-sided pan large enough to accommodate both salmon fillets side-by-side, without too much excess room; a small skillet or medium-sized saucepan should do. Pour lemon juice and olive oil into the pan, along with enough water to bring the water level up to 3/4-inch. Season the water to taste with salt and pepper, then add the salmon. Pour in enough water to just cover the salmon.",

Place the egg yolks in a metal bowl, and whisk in hot water. Place the bowl over, but not touching, the boiling water.

You may need to remove the bowl from the boiling water from time to time in order to keep from scrambling the yolks.",

Once all of the butter has been incorporated, remove from heat, whisk in the lemon juice, and season to taste with salt and pepper.",
