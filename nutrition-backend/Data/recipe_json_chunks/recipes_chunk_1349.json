So to make bechamel you melt half a stick of butter and add in 1 cup of flour and mix those over a low heat. Then you stir in 1.5 cups of milk and you let that sit on the low heat until it starts boiling. It will thicken as it boils and once its at kind of a thicker consistency then you take it off the stove and mix in 2 eggs. And then you just throw in whatever you want. For the one I made last week I had sauteed onions, mushrooms, and spinach and add those to the bechamel and then a whole bunch of Parmesan cheese. I mixed those and then put them on top of the puff pastry that I bought from trader joes and baked it for 20 minutes."

After all the chocolate has been added, stir in 2 tablespoons water and beat well until the glaze is completely smooth. Let the mixture cool about 5 minutes to thicken slightly."

According to Jamie Oliver, boiling the lemon like this leaves the juices simmering inside of it. Most of us put a cold lemon in the chicken, which means the juices don't start to pervade the chicken meat until the last half hour of cooking. Putting in a hot lemon means the juices release immediately, and the heat of the lemon starts to cook the chicken immediately too. So, stuff the chicken with the hot lemon, and a few more skewers of rosemary. Put this into the oven and cook for half an hour.",
      "\u00b0After half an hour, pull out the roasting pan. Take the partially cooked chicken out of the pan and put it on the plate, temporarily. Throw the boiled potatoes onto the bottom of the roasting pan. Be sure to swirl them in the juices that have already formed. Make a divot in the pile of potatoes, then put the chicken back in it. Return the pan to the oven for an additional hour.",
      "",
      "At the end of this, you should have the juiciest, easiest roast chicken you have ever made. And the potatoes will be golden brown and soft. Tuck in."

      "In the bowl of the heavy-duty mixer, combine the milk, yeast (see note if using instant yeast), and honey and stir to blend. Let stand until foamy, about 5 minutes. Add the egg and half the flour and stir to blend. The sponge will be soft and sticky. Sprinkle with the remaining flour, to cover the sponge dough, but don't mix it in. Set aside to rest, uncovered, for 30 minutes. The sponge should erupt slightly, cracking the layer of flour. This indicates that the yeast is live and doing its job.",
      "Add the honey, salt, eggs, and flour to the sponge. Mix at low speed just until the ingredients come together, about 1 minute. Increase the mixer speed to medium and beat for 5 minutes.",
      "When the butter is incorporated, it should be the same consistency as the dough. To prepare the butter, place it on a flat work surface, and with the pastry scraper, smear it bit by bit across the surface. (If you do not have a pastry scraper, use the back of a large metal spoon.) When it is ready, the butter should be smooth, soft, but still cool-not warm, oily, or greasy.",
      "With the mixer on medium-low speed, add the butter a few tablespoons at a time. When all the butter has been added, increase the mixer speed to medium-high for 1 minute, then reduce the speed to medium and continue to beat for 5 minutes more. The dough will be soft and pliable but shouldn't stick to your hands.",
      "Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap. Let the dough rise at room temperature until doubled in bulk, about 2 hours.",
      "Punch down the dough. Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate the dough overnight, or for at least 4 hours, during which time it should double in size again.",
      "Divide the dough into 12 equal pieces, each weighing about 2 1/2 ounces. Roll each piece of dough tightly into a ball and place 6 pieces in each bread pan, staggering them in two rows of 3; there will be some space left at either end of the loaf but it will fill up when the dough rises again. Cover the pans with a clean cloth and let the dough rise at room temperature until doubled in bulk, 1 to 1 1/2 hours.",
      "Center a rack in the oven. Preheat the oven to 375\u00b0F.",
      "Lightly brush the dough with the beaten egg. Working quickly, using the tip of a pair of sharp scissors, snip a cross on the top of each ball of dough; this will help the brioche rise evenly as it bakes. Bake until the loaves are puffed and deeply golden, 30 to 35 minutes. Place the pans on the baking rack to cool. Turn the loaves out after they have cooled.",
      "When using instant yeast, there is no need to let the yeast proof in warm milk; it can be added directly to the flour. Don't omit the milk, however, as this will change the balance of liquid to dry ingredients in the recipe. Instant yeast and active dry yeast can be used interchangeably in the same quantities.",
      "Honey both enriches the flavor of this brioche and helps keep it moist. Top quality honey makes all the difference here.",
      "The brioche is best eaten the day it is baked, although it can be tightly wrapped and stored for a day or two or frozen for up to 1 month. Thaw, still wrapped, at room temperature."

Bring to a boil, cover, and reduce the heat to a simmer. Cook until the rice is done and the liquid is absorbed, about 25 min. (If the rice is done but still very soupy, remove the cover and cook very gently until the liquid evaporates, taking care not to burn the rice.) Give a toss and then let sit for 5 min. before serving.",

      "Put chicken in roaster oven or stock pot and add enough water that it won't burn, but will just have enough to simmer. Put in half of onions and garlic. Cook until chicken is tender and skin has released it's fat. Pull chicken, and let cool until you can pick from the bones. While you do this, boil off the remaining water until basically the drippings and garlic and onion are left. Add flour to make a thick roux. Cook flour for a few minutes until it starts to turn light golden. Add several cups of water (you need a lot of gravy) and bring to a boil until gravy is thickened. It is ok if it is a little thin, as it will cook down with the veggies. Generously salt and pepper, and add rosemary, thyme, and parsley. Add potatoes, remaining garlic and onion, and the rest of the veggies. Cook until potatoes are just done and gravy is the right consistency. Preheat oven to 400 degrees while you prepare biscuits topping. This will not fit into one 9x13 pan so I recommend saving half in the freezer (no biscuits, use half a recipe and make more when you defrost it) or using two pans. If you don't you will have a massive mess like I did when it boils over in the oven. Take dry biscuit ingredients or mix and add cheese and seasonings. Finish making biscuit mix per recipe directions. Drop by spoonfuls across the top of the pot pie filling, covering as much of the top as you can. Bake in the oven until biscuits are cooked through and golden on top. It will take longer than normal because of the pot pie below."

Place chicken pieces in a 13 x 9 inch baking dish. Add marinade; turn to coat completely. Cover with plastic wrap; marinate in refrigerator 2 days. Bring to room temperature before grilling. Make Java Sauce. Prepare barbecue. Drain chicken pieces. Place skin-side down on grill over hot coals; cook, turning and basting with marinade every 10 minutes, 30 to 40 minutes, depending upon size of pieces, or until juices run clear when meat is pierced. Chicken will brown quickly because of the sugar in the marinade; do not burn. Serve with Java Sauce and Java Rice.",

Reduce heat to very low; steam, without stirring, 30 minutes or until rice is tender. Use a heat diffuser if necessary to prevent rice from burning and sticking. Fluff with a fork before serving."

Work potatoes through a food mill or a potato ricer onto a lightly floured surface. Sprinkle the flour and salt over the potatoes and mix together with your hands. Form a mound and create a well in the center; add truffle oil and egg. Gently knead dough until it just comes together, adding a little more flour if it begins to stick. 2. Lightly flour a parchment paper-lined baking sheet and set aside. Using a rolling pin, roll dough to a 1/2\" thickness. Cut into 1/2\"-wide strips. Roll each strip between your hands and the work surface to form ropes. Cut each rope into 1\" segments. Working with one segment at a time, roll it down the back of a small fork so that the tines make ridges on the surface of the dough. More specifically, start by positioning a 1\" dough segment on the back of a dinner fork; then slowly roll the segment down the length of the fork tines while simultaneously pressing lightly on the dough with your thumb to form a shallow indentation in the back. The resulting indentation and striations will help sauce cling to the gnocchi. When finished, transfer gnocchi to the prepared baking sheet; cover with a kitchen towel and refrigerate until ready to cook.",

Raise heat to high; add cream, peas, and thyme and cook, stirring occasionally, until cream reduces by half. Season mushroom sauce with salt and pepper and remove skillet from heat. Boil gnocchi in the salted water until they float, about 2 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer gnocchi to mushroom sauce, add chives, and toss to combine."
