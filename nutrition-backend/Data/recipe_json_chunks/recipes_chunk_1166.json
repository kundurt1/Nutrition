Now check the liquid, adding some broth or hot water if needed. It should have the color of the roux and be just slightly thickened. Simmer for about 30 minutes. Add salt and black pepper to taste, then add ground red (cayenne) pepper -- enough to just prick the tongue. About 5- 10 minutes before removing from heat, add the green onion tops and parsley. To serve, put a scoop of rice in your bowl and ladle on the gumbo. You should have plenty of French bread to complete your meal, and then top it off with a good tossed salad."

Cook on high for 3 to 6 hours on high, or low for 6-10 hours, depending on when you need it to be finished.

Also when cooking be very careful as they do seem to fall apart unless you make the pieces of dough thicker, and a tad larger. I only hope that by posting this here someone can come up with ideas on how to make the meat more mushy I've tried other recipes for the dumpling portion, and it just didn't taste as good."

Cover, place over high heat and bring to a boil. Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and simmer until the meat is very tender and falling apart, 1 1/2 to 2 hours.",

Once the turkey legs are cool enough to handle, remove the meat from the bone and shred, discarding any skin or cartilage. Place a 4-quart saucepan over medium heat and add the vegetable oil. Once shimmering, add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until they are semi-translucent, approximately 2 minutes.",

Soak the husks until they are soft and pliable, at least 45 minutes and up to 2 hours. If you have an electric kettle, place the husks in the kettle, fill with water and turn on. Once the kettle turns off, allow the husks to sit for 1 hour in the hot water.",

Add the lard and using your hands, knead together until the lard is well incorporated into the dry mixture. Gradually add enough of the reserved cooking liquid, 2 to 4 cups to create a dough that is like thick mashed potatoes. The dough should be moist but not wet. Cover the bowl with a damp towel and set aside until ready to use.",
      "ASSEMBLY: Remove a corn husk from the water and pat to remove excess water. Working in batches of 6, lay the husks on a towel and spread about 2 tablespoons of the dough in an even layer across the wide end of the husk to within 1/2-inch of the edges. Spoon about 2 teaspoons of the meat mixture in a line down the center of the dough. Roll the husk so the dough surrounds the meat and fold the bottom under to finish creating the tamale. Repeat until all the husks, dough and filling are used. Tie the tamales, around the center, individually or in groups of 3, with kitchen twine.",
      "STEAMING THE TAMALES: Place a steamer basket in the bottom of an 11-quart pot and add enough water to come to the bottom of the basket. Stand the tamales close together on their folded ends and lean them in towards the center, away from the sides of the pot. Bring the water to a boil over medium heat, then cover and reduce the heat to maintain a simmer. Check the water level every 15 to 20 minutes, and add boiling water by pouring down the side of the pot, if necessary. Steam until the dough is firm and pulls away from the husk easily, 1 to 1 1/2 hours.",

      "Dissolve yeast in warm water. Add 1/3 cup sugar, salt, milk, oil and eggs. Gradually add flour to make medium - stiff dough. Knead well on lightly-floured surface and turn into greased bowl. Let rise in warm place until double in size. Roll out dough to make 8 x 20 rectangle. Brush with 1/2 melted butter. Mix brown sugar, granulated sugar and cinnamon (add optional items here) and sprinkle over dough. On long side, start rolling into a tight log. Make sure the curl is tight and well packed. Slice into rolls - approx 32. In 12 x 15 pan and 11 x 13 casserole, melt 1/4 c butter. Brush butter along all the sides and corners. Sprinkle another 1/2 cup of brown sugar in each. Place the roll slices in the pan/casserole. Place in warm place to rise. When the rolls are approximately double the size, heat oven to 350 degrees. Bake for 20 minutes until tops are lightly browned. While baking, make cream cheese icing by beating together the 8 ounces cream cheese and softened 1/4 cup margarine, 1 teaspoon vanilla, 3 cups confectioners' sugar and 1 - 2 tablespoon milk (if it seems too thick, add milk to thin).",
