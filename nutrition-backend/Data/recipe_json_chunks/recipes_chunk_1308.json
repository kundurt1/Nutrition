Add the pepper, coriander, fennel and the rest of the ingredients (except the turkey!) to the saucepan. Once the salt and sugar are dissolved, turn off the heat and let cool. If the brine is to be used immediately, you can add ice cubes directly to the brine to lower the temperature. Warm brine should NEVER be used to brine your poultry. Otherwise, transfer the brine to a container and refrigerate until ready to use. To brine your turkey, place breast side down in a pot or container large enough to hold the turkey when covered with liquid. Add enough water to cover, stir to combine, and refrigerate, covered, for up to twelve hours. You may want to place a plate on top of the immersed turkey to keep the whole bird submerged. When ready to cook, remove the turkey from the brine, rinse, and pat dry.

Squeeze them in your hands to wring out the excess water and them crumble it into tiny pieces adding the moist bread to the crab/vegetable mixture. Next add in the Mustard and the Miracle Whip, mixing thoroughly. Next add in all of the seasonings and the margarine and mix thoroughly one last time. Making sure that the mixture is thick and pliable, but not so gooey as to fall apart in your hands, (remember, if the mixture isn't sturdy enough you can always add more bread crumbs).",
      "Spray a medium to large skillet with cooking spray ( I like to use the olive oil spray for extra flavor). Take a small handful of the crab cake mixture and begin to roll and compress it in your hand (as you would a meatball) Once the handful is compressed enough that it isn't falling apart, flatten it a bit in your hand so that is a thick ovular shape then dust them lightly with the breadcrumbs you've set aside and lay them in the pan. (This is done to help maintain shape, add crispness, and keep the crab cakes from flaking) For extra crispness and flavor I like to sprinkle a little bit of parmesan cheese (what was set aside) over the top of each crab cake as well, but this is optional. Turn your crab cakes until each side is crispy and a nice dark golden brown color and have thickened enough to hold their shape"

Place chicken over beer can so the chicken is balanced and the beer can is inside the chicken (yep, wierd...but trust me) Be sure the chicken can balance, now place on the BBQ. Since BBQ's vary in time the cooking will take anywhere from 1-2 hours. You can test the chicken for doneness by wiggling the wing to see if it is loose. When finished the chicken needs to be lifted with oven mits and have a friend remove the beer can while you hold the chicken.

Grill the merguez coils for 10-12 minutes, total, turning once. I make large coils to serve four. They make a spectacular dinner party offering with lentils du puy, crusty bread, and a green salad with figs and marcona almonds."

Remove from heat and quickly stir in baking soda, then nuts. Don't stir too long or toffee will turn cloudy and crumble when cool. Immediately transfer to large baking sheet that has been sprayed with vegetable oil cooking spay. Seperate nuts with two forks. At this point, some of the pecans may not have enough toffee covering them. After all nuts have been seperated, the toffee should be cool enough to handle but still warm enough to be pliable. Using your fingers and a fork, wrap extra toffee around any uncoated nuts. Can be stored in an airtight container when completely cool. These can be enjoyed as a snack or crushed and used as a topping for ice cream, bread pudding, cheesecake, pumpkin or sweet potato pie. Also great stirred into your favorite chocolate fudge recipe!"

I won't eat this the day I make it. I'll refrigerate it and heat it again the next day. Then it's even better!! You may have to add some more chicken broth if soup is too thick. I've also used ketchup in place of the tomato sauce. This is one of those recipes that can easily be made with minor substitutions and still have great, maybe even better outcomes."

Wrap the sausage securely in aluminum foil (Heavy duty is probably best).

      "The benefits of brining are many fold. First, brining provides a cushion for the breast meat, so even if it overcooks by ten degrees F or so, it remains moist. Secondly, the meat of a brined bird tastes pleasantly seasoned, which eliminates the need to season before and after roasting. Because the turkey sits overnight in a tub of salted water, brining also ensures that all parts of the turkey are at the same temperature. Yet another benefit is that the turkey meat absorbs water during the brining process. Water is a heat conductor and therefore expedites cooking. Lastly, brining may help inhibit growth of certain types of bacteria. So while it may seem like added work, dunking the bird in the brine is worth it for a whole host of reasons."

Lightly brush both sides of the zucchini and the leeks with olive oil and season with 1/2 teaspoon salt and pepper. Grill the zucchini over high heat, turning once, until nicely browned and tender, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer to a work surface, let cool slightly and slice crosswise 1/2 inch thick.",

Transfer the leeks to a work surface and let cool slightly. Remove the outer leaf and thinly slice the leeks crosswise, discarding any tough dark green pieces.",

When the skillet is hot, carefully pour in the eggs and vegetables. Using a spoon, carefully dollop the remaining 2 tablespoons of the creme fraiche and the 2 teaspoons of harissa around the top of the eggs. Close the grill and cook the frittata for about 15 minutes, moving the skillet a few times to make sure it's evenly heated, until the eggs are puffed and set.",

Whisk in a cup of instant nonfat milk powder (to enhance flavor - it is not traditionally an ingredient in brown butter). Raise the heat to medium, whisking constantly. The butter begins to bubble and hiss; after all the water has boiled away, turn down the heat. Now the temperature will rise quickly to 250 deg F, whereupon the butter and the solids in it will begin turning a richer golden color, then a golden brown, a dark brown, and finally black, as the heady scents of toffee and butterscotch fill the room. Remove from the heat as soon as the milk solids have gotten very dark brown; the goal is to avoid the black state, which tastes mainly burned. Immediately pour the butter into a large bowl, preferably of metal, to stop the cooking. Fill a larger bowl with 2 or 3 pounds of ice and add cold water to about 2 inches from the rim. Float the smaller bowl in the ice water. With a whisk, stir the butter slowly until it begins to thicken, then whip vigorously until the butter becomes too stiff to mix further.

Remove immediately.",

      "While salmon is cooking, heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add butter and garlic, cooking for 30 seconds, then whisk in flour to create a roux. Let the mixture cook for another minute or so until it becomes golden in color, then add milk and half and half, stirring constantly. Allow the mixture to slightly thicken then toss in the basil and parmesan, stirring to combine. Taste and add salt and pepper to your liking. Add in cooked noodles and using kitchen tongs, toss to coat completely. Serve immediately and place salmon on top.",
      "",
      "Note: I used salmon that was about 1 inch thick - if your's is thicker or thinner, you may need to adjust the cooking time accordingly. Additionally, this \"sauce\" leaves a thin coating on the noodles and is not very saucy. If you desire more, I suggest doubling the butter, garlic, flour, milks, basil and parm. This also allows you to have extra sauce to spoon on top of the salmon, which is terrific."

      "Method of Preparation:",
      "Butter a 13- by 9-inch baking dish. Cut 20 (1-inch) slices from baguette and arrange in 1 layer in the baking dish. In a large bowl whisk together eggs, milk, nutmeg, vanilla and 3/4 cup brown sugar and pour evenly over bread. Chill mixture, covered, until all liquid is absorbed by bread, at least 8 hours, and up to 1 day. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. In a shallow baking pan, spread pecans evenly and toast in middle of oven until fragrant, about 8 minutes. Toss pecans in pan with 1 teaspoon butter and salt. Increase temperature to 400 degrees. Sprinkle pecans and blueberries evenly over bread mixture. Cut 1/2 stick butter into pieces and in a small saucepan heat with remaining 1/4 cup brown sugar, stirring until butter is melted. Drizzle butter mixture over bread and bake for 20 minutes, or until any liquid from the blueberries is bubbling. Meanwhile, in a small saucepan, cook blueberries and maple syrup over moderate heat until berries have burst, about 3 minutes. Pour syrup through a sieve into a heatproof pitcher, pressing on solids, and stir in lemon juice. Syrup may be made 1 day ahead and chilled, covered. Reheat syrup before serving. Serve French toast with syrup. This recipe yields 6 generous servings. Source: \"COOKING LIVE with Sara Moulton - (Show # CL-9558)"
