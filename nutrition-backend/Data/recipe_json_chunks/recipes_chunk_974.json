      "When you think it's been browned long enough and it's time to give it a stir to redistribute the meat for more browning - STOP - wait another minute and a half to two minutes, and then stir up the meat. Do this repeatedly until all the meat is good and brown. This is important for the end result. For a good meat sauce, you want your meat to have browned sufficiently, and most people don't give it enough time. In all, this process should take 12-15 minutes.",
      "Add all the remaining ingredients, bring back to a boil, and reduce heat to a simmer. Simmer, uncovered, for 35 minutes, then cover pot and simmer a further 30 minutes. This is as long as I cook it for my family, the sauce is as thick as we like it. If you like your sauce thicker, cook it uncovered slightly longer before covering the pot (another 5-10 minutes?). If you like your sauce thinner, cover the pot after 25-30 minutes of simmering before continuing with the additional half hour.",

      "In the dry pot you cooked the pasta in, add the butter (BUTTER, not oil, not margarine); melt and brown the butter. This takes about 3-4 minutes at high heat. Turn off heat source and add spaghetti back to the pot. Toss to coat with browned butter.",
      "Put spaghetti in large platter, pour half of sauce over, sprinkle with about 1/2 cup myzithra cheese.",

Once the sauce is bubbling, put the lid on, turn the heat down to very low, and leave to simmer gently for about 45 minutes to 1 hour. If you're using a wide pan, the shorter time should be enough; if the sauce is piled up higher, you'll probably need the full hour.",

Taste to see if you want any more seasoning. Once the polenta is thick and coming away from the sides of the saucepan, quickly divide it between the damp pans, spreading each one to an even as possible layer using a silicone spatula you've passed under a cold tap. It will set almost instantly. You can put aside these polenta layers and your meat sauce for now.",

The reason I don't use a food processor is because Jerusalem artichokes have a unique consistency, and they don't chop well in the food processor. Some of them get pulverized, while large chunks remain unchopped. So, if you like, use a food processor, but just make sure you don't end up with mush. You want a lot of very small chunks; it should look about the consistency of relish. As you cut the artichokes, place them in the brine.",
      "Make a second batch of brine with the remaining cup of salt and one gallon water, stirring well to make sure all the salt dissolves.",
      "In a food processor, chop the cabbage, onions, and bell peppers until they are cut fine. Make sure to keep an eye on what you are doing so you don't get mush. You want the vegetables to be the consistency of a relish.",
      "Once they are chopped, place the vegetables in the second batch of brine you made, and stir well.",
      "Cover both bowls of brined vegetables, and leave on the counter overnight or for 8 hours. Don't let them sit in the brine for longer than 10 hours or the vegetables may become too salty.",
      "Line a counter with lots of paper towels - I usually use 5 layers. You are going to be placing the drained vegetables on these paper towels, so make sure you cover a fairly large space; at least 2 1/2 feet by 1 1/2 feet.",
      "Drain the Jerusalem artichokes and rinse with cold water. Drain well and place on half of the paper towels.",
      "Drain the cabbage/onion/pepper mixture and rinse with cold water. Drain well, and then with your hands, which you have just washed in hot water with soap, squeeze the remaining moisture out of the vegetables. You will see that a lot of water still comes out. Place the drained and squeezed vegetables on the other half of the paper towels.",
      "In a large bowl, whisk together the French's mustard and the flour. Set aside.",
      "In a very large stockpot (at least 10 quarts), combine the apple cider vinegar, white wine vinegar, sugar, yellow mustard seed, turmeric, celery seed, cayenne pepper, ground allspice, ground cloves, and black pepper.",
      "Bring to a boil, stirring well, and then reduce to a simmer.",
      "Dip out about 2 cups of the vinegar mixture and add it to the mustard/flour mixture in the bowl, whisking well to combine - make sure you whisk it until there are no more lumps.",
      "Add the mustard/flour mixture back to the vinegar mixture in the stockpot, whisking well to combine. Bring to a boil and then let simmer for 10 minutes over medium heat, whisking occasionally.",
      "Add the drained artichokes and the cabbage/onion/pepper mixture, and stir very well, making sure all is combined and mixed well with the vinegar/mustard mixture. Bring to a boil, stirring often.",
      "Place in canning jars, leaving 1/2\" headspace. Use a chopstick or other thin, non-metal utensil to run around the sides of the jar to make sure there are no air bubbles left in the jar. Wipe the rims of the jars with damp paper towels to remove any relish which got on the rims or the threads. Place the lids and the bands on the jars, just tightening the bands fingertip tight.",
      "Process in a boiling water bath for 15 minutes, then remove and let sit, undisturbed, for at least 12 hours before checking seals. It is important to let them sit undisturbed for 12 hours because the sealing compound on the lids is still cooling and hardening, completing the seal. While the jars cool, you will hear a \"plink\" type sound from each jar - this is the jars completing the vacuum seal as the final air escapes the jar. After 12 hours have passed, remove the bands and check the lids - press down in the center of the lid. If you cannot push the lid down any further, the jar is sealed. If the lid \"gives\" a bit, and you can push it down, the jar did not seal. You can either put the band back on the jar, and reprocess it for another 15 minutes, or you can just put it in the fridge and use it within 3 months.",
      "Artichoke relish should sit for at least a month before you use it, so the flavors can combine and improve."

Repeat with the other two portions.

Remove and drain well. Blanch the husks in same water for 3 minutes. Remove and drain well. Discard the water. Remove kernels from the corn cobs. Discard cobs.",
      "To make the masa filling, beat the lard in a large bowl until light and fluffy, the same way you would cream shortening when making a cake. This may take as long as 3 minutes. Use an electric mixer on medium speed. Begin adding the masa, about 1/2 cup at a time while beating constantly. Scrape down the sides of the bowl often. If the mixture becomes too stiff, beat in some of the warmed chicken broth, a little at a time. Beat in the salt. The masa is ready when it is very delicate and light and has the consistency of buttercream frosting. Any leftover masa can be frozen.",
      "To assemble:",
      "Place a large, blanched husk on work surface, vertically, with the pointed end of the husk facing away from you. Spread the center of the husk with a generous 1 tbs of masa mixture. Add about 2 tsp of blanched corn and about 2 tsp cooked chicken on top of the masa. If you run out of large husks, lay 2 smaller husks side-by-side. Adjust the amount of filling according to the size of the husk. Fold the tamales like this:.",
      "First, fold the long sides of the husk inward over the filling. If these edges are curling, make sure they are flat when folding. Then, fold the top of the husk over the filling. Finally, fold up the bottom edge of the husk to make a square-ish packet, about 1 3/4 to 2 inches square. If the tamale is difficult to fold, trim off the thick, stem end of the husk. Some cooks tie the tamale closed with long, thin strips of husk or cotton kitchen twine.",
      "Lay each completed tamale, face up, carefully into the steamer. You can use a two-level steamer with no problem. Steam over vigorously boiling water for about 1 hour, adding additional water to the steamer as needed. Remove from steamer to a serving plate. Cool briefly.",
      "To eat, unfold the tamale, top with your favorite salsa or condiment, scoop out the filling and enjoy. Red and green salsa for serving, along with guacamole and sour cream are good choices. A good accompanying dish is Mexican red rice. Just search \"mexican red rice\" on Recipezaar. Discard the corn husk."

    "title": "goat's cheese, shallot and leek tart - a bit of a french tart!",
    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "You will need a 71/2 inch (19 cm) diameter fluted quiche tin with a removable base, 11/4 inches (3 cm) deep, very lightly buttered, and a small, solid baking sheet.",
      "Pre-heat the oven to gas mark 5, 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C) and pop the baking sheet in to pre-heat on the centre shelf.",
      "Now prepare the leeks. First, take the tough green ends off & discard them; leave some of the lighter green & then make a vertical split about halfway down the centre of each one and clean them by running them under the cold-water tap while you fan out the layers - this will rid them of any hidden dust and grit. Then slice them in half lengthways and chop into 1/2-inch (1 cm) slices.",
      "Next, in a medium-sized frying pan, melt the butter over a gentle heat and add the leeks, shallots and some salt. Give it all a good stir and let them cook gently, without a lid, for 10-15 minutes or until the juice runs out of them. Then you need to transfer them to a sieve set over a bowl to drain off the excess juice. Place a saucer with a weight on top of them to press out every drop.",
      "Roll it out into a circle on a lightly floured surface. As you roll, give it quarter turns to keep the round shape and roll it as thinly as possible. Now transfer it, rolling it over the pin, to the tin. Press it lightly and firmly over the base and sides of the tin, easing any overlapping pastry back down to the sides, as it is important not to stretch it. Now trim the edges and press the pastry up about 1/4 inch (5 mm) above the rim of the tin all round, and then prick the base all over with a fork.",
      "After that, paint some of the beaten egg for the filling over the base and sides. Now place the tin on the baking sheet and bake for 20-25 minutes or until the pastry is crisp and golden. Check halfway through the cooking time to make sure that the pastry is not rising up in the centre. If it is, just prick it a couple of times and press it back down with your hands.",
      "While the pastry case is pre-baking, crumble the goats' cheese with your hands, and then gently combine it with the leeks & shallots in the sieve. Now, in a jug, mix the beaten eggs with the creme fraiche or double cream, seasoning with just a little salt (there is some already in the leeks) and a good grinding of freshly milled black pepper.",
      "As soon as the pastry case is ready, remove it from the oven; arrange the leeks, shallots and cheese all over the base. Pour the cream and egg mixture over the top of the cheese, shallots & leeks, then put the tart back on the baking sheet with the oven shelf half pulled out, then gently slide the shelf back in and bake the tart for 30-35 minutes, until it's firm in the centre and the surface has turned a lovely golden brown.",
      "Next, remove it from the oven and allow it to settle for 10 minutes before serving. These 10 minutes is important, as it will be much easier to cut into portions. The best way to remove the tart from the tin is to ease the edges from the sides of the tin with a small knife, then place it on an upturned jar or tin, which will allow you to carefully ease the sides away.",
      "Next slide a palette knife or wide fish slice underneath and ease the tart on to a plate or board ready to serve, or simply cut it into portions straight from the tin base.",
      "Serve for picnics, light lunch with mixed salad and baked potatoes or as finger food for a buffet."

      "***Wanted to say THANKS to all the reviews! Here's another hint to make this easier: when you are going to make boiled eggs, ALWAYS make sure you buy the eggs at LEAST 7-10 days in advance. Why? Because as an egg matures, it develops a small air \"bubble\" inside it (it's the membrane separating from the shell). Having this bubble makes it a BREEZE to peel the eggs once they've cooled completely (also a great trick for Easter Eggs, BTW). You want your eggs to be around 10-12 days old, and it takes, on average, 2-3 days to get them from the laying facility to the store."

      "One secret to making Gino's East pizza is getting the cornmeal ground up fine enough so that you don't have a grainy texture to the crust. To do this, take 3/4 cup corn meal and grind it up in a coffee grinder. You have to grind it as fine as is possible. Then take the ground corn meal and sift it into your mixer bowl.",
      "Another secret to Gino's East pizza is to get the cornmeal dissolved as well as possible (again, to prevent the grainy crust.) To do this, put the warm water in the mixing bowl with the corn meal, and add the yeast, salt, sugar, olive oil, and melted butter. Using the whisk attachment (if you have a KitchenAid mixer), stir the mixture for 10 minutes.",
      "Add one cup of flour to the mixer and use the dough hook to mix it up well. Add the remaining flour 1/4 cup at a time until you can handle and kneed the dough without it sticking to your hands. You may not need the whole 2 1/2 cups of flour, or you may need a little more. You will have to use your judgment. Just remember not to let the dough get too hard, or to have it too soft (will stick you your fingers).",
      "Take the dough out of the KitchenAid mixer and kneed it by hand on a countertop. If you have made the dough right you will not have to put any flour down, or you will only need a minimal amount. Kneed the dough for 3 to 5 minutes.",
      "Oil the inside of your mixer bowl. Place the dough ball in the bowl and cover the bowl with a sheet of plastic wrap or a warm damp towel. Let the dough rise until doubled in size. This might take anywhere from 1/2 to 1 1/2 hours.",
      "After the dough has risen, punch down the dough into a ball. Place the ball of dough on the counter and flatten it with your hand. Then use a rolling pin to roll the dough into a uniform circle 1/4 inch thick.",
      "Oil the bottom of the skillet, with CANOLA oil and not olive oil, and then take your dough and carefully place it into the skillet. Form the crust by stretching the dough about 1-1/2 to 2 inches up the side of the pan. Cover the pan with plastic wrap and let the dough rise again until your oven is preheated to 475\u00b0F.",
      "Melt 2T of butter and use a basting brush to coat the crust surface with melted butter. The first thing you will put into the pan will be the cheese. Place an even layer of cheese 1/2 to 3/4 inches deep in the pan. The next thing you will put into the pan will be the meat. Layer the meat spaced evenly over the top of the cheese. Next spread a layer of tomato sauce or crushed tomates on top of the meat. Don't put too much sauce on or you will end up with a soggy pizza. The last thing is to sprinkle parmesan cheese over the top of the sauce.",
      "Bake the pizza at 475 for 15 minutes. Lower the temperature to 400\u00b0F and bake the pizza an additional 10 to 25 minutes until the crust is golden brown, and areas of browned cheese start to poke up through the sauce. Let the pizza cool 5 minutes and then serve."

      "Grilling -- After making your skewers, let them set and come to room temp before grilling. They can be grilled outside, charcoal or gas or can be done inside on a grill pan. NOW -- make the rice --",
      "Rice -- Bring the water, coconut and salt to a boil and add the rice. Most recipes will take about 15 minutes to cook covered. Just follow the recipe on the package. Each rice brand can take different times. Once light and fluffy add the cilantro and any salt and pepper is needed.",
      "Serve the skewers over the coconut rice. I love to serve this with simple sauteed sugar snap peas. A little butter, red pepper flakes, salt and pepper. 3-4 minutes and serve. But use any veggie you enjoy. Bok Choy pan seared is also great with this."
