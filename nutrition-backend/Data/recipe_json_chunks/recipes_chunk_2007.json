      "A tortilla press is essential for making Corn Tortillas (page 174) and Tostones (page 34).",
      "It is made from two round, heavy plates.",
      "One sits solidly on the counter and the other, attached to the first by a hinge, is pushed down over the first using the leverage of the handle.",
      "Its a beautifully simple design that hasnt been improved by the introduction of new technologies or materials.",
      "Buy the heaviest one you can find; I like cast iron.",
      "The weight helps do the pressing for you.",
      "Dont buy nonstick or electric presses.",
      "Be sure to line both sides of the press with wax paper or plastic wrap or the tortilla will stick to it.",
      "Tortilla presses can not only be found at kitchen supply retailers, department stores, and online, but they can also often be found for half the price in grocery stores catering to a Latin clientele.",
      "A comal is a flat, heavy griddleagain, I prefer cast ironcrucial for cooking tortillas.",
      "They are widely available at big box and department stores and well worth their very reasonable price.",
      "Theyre sturdy enough to last decades and are great for searing meat and making quesadillas, panini, and grilled cheese.",
      "Unlike the tortilla press and comal, a lidded tortilla warmer is not crucial for producing the most successful tortillas possible.",
      "You can certainly place cooked, warm tortillas on a platter and cover them with a clean, cloth napkin or pretty kitchen towel.",
      "But tortilla warmers are fun and often beautiful.",
      "I love to collect them, in fact, and have a large assortment of warmers made from cloth, ceramic, terra-cotta, and porcelain.",
      "I love to present everything I serve in an attractive way, and tortilla warmers look lovely on the table while actually doing the useful job of keeping my fresh tortillas moist and warm!"
