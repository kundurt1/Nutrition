I like to make frozen mudslides by blending Kahlua and vanilla ice cream, then pouring into a glass that has been swirled with chocolate syrup. Top with additional chocolate (if desired) and whipped cream. Another favorite of mine is to mix Kahlua with perfectly brewed coffee. Add either cream or whipped cream (homemade whipped cream is best!). Enjoy."

      "One of the really important things for German Christmas baking is \"Oblaten.\" They are very thin baking wafers that are quite tasteless by themselves, but they have oh so many functions. First and foremost they keep your cookies soft! Second they help with uniform sizing and make your cookies slide off the baking tray so easily. But, first and foremost ... they keep your cookies moist! (Click on related blog post for links).",
      "This is important for Elisenlebkuchen, as they really need to sit for a while to reach their \"prime!\"",
      "I generally have some on hand, either from Germany or from local stores that carry German ingredients. I tend to use round because that is what I can get, but square or rectangular works just as well! And they can be cut to size really easily with a pair of scissors!",
      "They keep forever! I mean literally. I found some in my pantry from years ago and they were still perfectly fine! So if you get some, stock up! I also have a couple more recipes where these will come in quite handy!",
      "Should you not be able to find them but still want to try this recipe, there is a way around it. Granted it won't work quite as well, but it is a passable substitute. I will explain it in the directions later.",
      "Chances are you can only get the hazelnuts whole. Grind them as fine as you can in your food processor! For the coarse chopped nuts, put the whole nuts in the food processor and pulse a few times. Then add the candied peel and pulse a few more times until the peel resembles finely chopped consistency. (See related blog post for photos)",
      "1. Add all ingredients (everything before the baking wafers/coating/glaze ingredients) to a bowl and mix well.",
      "2. Cover the bowl and let it sit in the refrigerator for 24 hours. It may seem a little runny at first, but it will thicken up quite a bit in the next 24 hours.",
      "3. When you are ready to bake, preheat the oven to 400F.",
      "4. Lay out the baking wafers on a baking sheet, lined with parchment paper. Scoop equal amounts of the nut mix onto the wafers and smooth out. I find that the easiest way to get the round wafers uniform is to use an ice cream scoop. Scoop some nut mixture into your slightly moistened hands, make a smooth ball and then press it as a disc onto the wafer and smooth the edges down. Make sure that the disc is just slightly smaller than the wafer, as the dough will spread some.",
      "5. Bake for 12-15 minutes or until the Lebkuchen are lightly golden brown. It is important that they are not quite done in the middle though.",
      "6. Place them on a cookie rack to cool slightly.",
      "7. If you are going to be icing them with the sugar glaze, it is better if you do this when they are still a little warm. For the chocolate coating they need to be entirely cooled however. Try and brush the coating on as thinly as you possibly can!",
      "Traditionally the Elisenlebkuchen are offered in 4 ways: With a thin sugar glaze, unglazed, with a thin dark chocolate glaze or with a thin milk chocolate glaze. You can do them whichever way you prefer. In our family we tend to favor the sugar glazed ones, closely followed by the semi-sweet chocolate glaze, so I usually only do those two.",
      "If you have used baking wafers, just brush on a thin coat of chocolate coating or sugar glaze. Let completely dry and then store in a cookie tin.",
      "**If you didn't use baking wafers, you will need to dip or brush your entire cookie. First a coat on the bottom, let dry, then a coat on the top of the cookie. This will also seal the moisture and flavors inside!**",
      "Lebkuchen need to sit for a while to develop their prime taste and texture. They need a minimum of 10 days in that cookie tin, so take that into account when planning to make these!",
      "They will however keep for several weeks in a cookie tin and personally I think they taste the best after they have matured for about 2-3 weeks!"

      "Now, where you would normally place a second layer of cake, make a slit with a knife all around (about 2\" from the rim of the cake) and stick in the chocolate discs, standing up, so that it resembles a second layer (refer to photo). The same with the 'top' or 'third' layer. Add a couple of discs in the very center and you could stack a couple on top of those so that it (the cake) looks taller.",

You can also make the discs larger (though, they become a bit more difficult to work with). The number of discs that you use all depends on how large the cake is.

It should simply fall apart. Next: peeling the cloves. If you've ever watched Food Network, they all do it the same way. Place the flat side of your knife on the clove and hit the knife with your other hand. The clove should be easy to remove from the peel. If not, hit it again.",

Return to the refrigerator and cool until firm.",
      "To serve, use a star tip on a piping bag, or a small spoon to add a dollop of the whipped cream to each panna cotta and then sprinkle with some shaved chocolate on top. Serve immediately.",
      "Note: I prepared the dessert in clear glass tumblers so you could appreciate the separate layers, and used a simple twist of sweetened whip cream and a sprinkle of grated dark chocolate to serve. I used a bitter dark chocolate, but you could use whatever chocolate you prefer; just adjust the sugar as needed as you do not want it overly sweet. For the espresso, I used an entire single serving of Starbuck's new instant Italian espresso roast but you could use any instant coffee you have on hand. Just add 1 teaspoon at a time until you get a light coffee flavor, as you do not want the coffee flavor to overpower the chocolate."

      "Using a mixer, cream together the butter and brown sugar until the mixture is fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add the egg and vanilla and mix until combined, scraping down the bowl as needed. Slowly add the flour mixture until just incorporated. Tightly cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.",
      "While the dough is chilling, preparing the filling by mixing together the brown sugar and sour cream in a small bowl. Add the walnuts and stir until incorporated. Refrigerate the filling until needed.",
      "Preheat the oven to 350F. After the dough has chilled, line a sheet pan with parchment paper. Use a cookie scoop to put 6 to 7 mounds of dough on the sheet pan. I prefer to use a large cookie scoop (2 tablespoons), which makes large cookies. You will get about 16 cookies when using a large cookie scoop. You may certainly use a smaller cookies scoop or roll the dough into 1\" balls. If you make the cookies smaller, you will get a larger number of cookies out of each batch.",
      "Refrigerate the remaining dough to keep it chilled. These cookies do spread when baking, so be sure to leave PLENTY of room between the cookies or they'll run together. Poke your thumb into each mound of dough, leaving about 1/8\" thickness of dough on the bottom. Take the effort to make the well as large as possible while keeping a sturdy wall around the perimeter. Fill each well with some filling. I prefer to really mound the filling in the well because I think the filling is the best part of the cookie. Some people prefer less filling because it makes the cookies too sweet. When making these cookies for the first time, I recommend that you put only two cookies on your sheet pan-one with a moderate amount of filling and one with a lot. When the cookies come out of the oven, taste them and decide which one appeals to you better. Note: if you plan to use a lot of filling in each cookie, you may need to make a little extra so you have enough to fill all of the cookies. The filling only takes a minute to make so, if you need to make more, it can be made at a moment's notice.",
      "Bake the cookies for about 9 to 10 minutes or until they are lightly brown. For smaller cookies, decrease the baking time appropriately. Don't over bake. Allow the cookies to cool on the sheet pan for 2 minutes before transferring to a wire rack. While the first sheet pan is in the oven, prepare another one with 6 to 7 cookies. Keep the dough refrigerated until it is ready to go in the oven or the cookies will spread too much. When storing, don't stack the cookies on top of each other or they may stick together."

As noted in the recipe, you can substitute part of the water with chicken stock. In fact, I often add 1 can of chicken stock and add enough water to total about 6 cups. You may not need all 6 cups.",
      "While the water is heating, add the chopped bacon to a large skillet (and I do mean a LARGE skillet), then set the skillet on a burner over medium heat. Starting the bacon from a cold skillet will help it render more fat. Cook the bacon until crispy. Transfer the bacon to a paper towel using a slotted spoon. Pour off all but 2 tablespoons of the bacon fat.",
      "Add the onions to the bacon drippings in the skillet. Saute the onion for about 3 minutes, stirring often. Add the Arborio rice and stir to coat. Cook the rice without adding any liquid for about 3 to 4 minutes, stirring occasionally. This helps to give risotto its classic \"al dente\" bite. Add the garlic and ginger and cook for 1 minute longer.",
      "By now, your water should be hot. Add 4 ladles of the water (about 2 cups) to the skillet, enough to cover the rice. Add the soy sauce and rice vinegar and stir to combine. Using a wooden spoon (which helps to keep the rice intact), stir the rice from time to time. Do not put a lid on the skillet. The liquid in the rice should be lightly simmering. If it is simmering too briskly, turn down the heat.",
      "Cook until most of the liquid has been absorbed, which should take 4 to 5 minutes. Add another 2 ladles of the hot water (about 1 cup) and allow it to be absorbed by the rice, stirring every once in a while, another 4 to 5 minutes.",
      "When most of the liquid has been absorbed, add the carrots. Add another cup of the hot water and cook until most of the liquid has been absorbed, stirring every so often.",
      "By the time the liquid from the last addition has been absorbed, the rice should have been cooking in water for about 12 to 15 minutes. Add the peas and one last cup of the hot water. (It is certainly possible that you may not end up using all of the water. Or you may. It depends on your brand of rice, the humidity, how quickly you're simmering the rice, etc.) You should stir the rice more often at this point. After a couple of minutes, I start heating a small skillet for the scrambled eggs. The rice needs to have been cooking in the liquid for a total of about 18 to 20 minutes.",
      "After the water has been absorbed, add 2 tablespoons of butter to the risotto and stir aggressively.",
      "At this point, quickly scramble the eggs by adding 1/2 tablespoon of butter to the small skillet that you've been heating. Add the beaten eggs and scramble until just firm.",
      "Add the cooked eggs, cubed chicken, scallions, and sesame oil to the risotto and stir to combine. Taste for seasoning and adjust as needed with salt, soy sauce, and pepper (if desired). The risotto should be nice and creamy. If it is too thick, add a little more water. If it's too soupy, allow it to cook another minute or so before serving. Serve piping hot topped with some of the crispy bacon you fried earlier.",

Over medium heat in a small sauce pan, scald the milk, sugar, and salt. Remove from the heat and skim off any skin that has developed on the surface. Add the butter and allow the mixture to cool to lukewarm.",

Use a mixer equipped with a paddle to get the ingredients completely combined then shut off the mixer for 4 minutes. This rest period will allow the liquid to be more readily absorbed so you do not end up adding too much flour. After 4 minutes of resting, switch to a dough hook. Mix the dough for about 3 to 4 minutes. This dough will be a little stickier than many kinds of dough that you may have worked with before. For the most part, the dough should not be sticking to the sides of the bowl as it is mixing. If it is really sticking, add a little more flour. If it looks pretty dry, add a teaspoon or so of water.",
      "Spray a bowl with cooking spray. Form the dough into a ball and add it to the sprayed bowl. Spray the top of the dough lightly with cooking spray then cover the bowl with plastic wrap. Let rise in a warm place until doubled in size - about 60 to 75 minutes.",
      "Punch down the dough and turn it out onto a lightly floured surface. Roll the dough out into a 12\" x 9\" rectangle (with one of the longer sides closest to your tummy). The dough should be very soft and easy to work with.",

Sprinkle the butter-topped dough with the cinnamon-sugar mixture. Drizzle the remaining butter all over the sugar mixture. Add the chocolate chips on top of the sugar. I use about 1/2 cup or so. You could certain use more or less. If using nuts, sprinkle some on now. Lightly press the chocolate and sugar mixture to make the dough easier to roll up. Lightly brush the 1\" strip of dough at the top with a little water so that, after you roll up the dough, the seam will seal better. Starting from the side closest to your tummy, carefully roll up the dough - trying to keep as much of the filling inside as possible. You should end up with a log roughly 12\" in length. Pinch the lightly moistened seam tightly to seal. Cut the roll into 10 slices.",
      "Place 5 rolls in each pan (4 around the outside and 1 in the center) - leaving as much space as possible between each roll and the sides of the pan. Cover and let rise until doubled - about 45 to 60 minutes. About 15 minutes before the rolls have fully risen, preheat the oven to 350F. When doubled in size, uncover the rolls and bake about 15 minutes.",
      "While the rolls are baking, make the frosting.",
      "Using a mixer equipped with a whisk attachment, whisk the cream cheese and butter together. Add the powdered sugar and use the mixer to slowly whisk it in. Add the vanilla and milk. Whisk for about 2 - 3 minutes, scraping the bowl as needed. Too thick for you? Add another 1/2 tablespoon of milk at a time until you have reached the desired consistency.",
      "When the rolls are done, allow them to cool in the pans for 1 to 2 minutes. Remove a roll from one of the pans and place it on a serving plate. Top with some frosting and some shaved chocolate from a chocolate bar. The frosting will start to melt and everything will get gooey and messy. Unapologetically eat the roll with your fingers. Remember - everything in excess. I mean moderation. Yeah, yeah. Moderation.",
      "Note:",
      "1) Regular chocolate chips contain stabilizers that inhibit melting. The Ghirardelli 60% Cacao Bittersweet Chocolate Chips melt beautifully and are flat disks which makes them easier to roll up inside the cinnamon rolls. The chocolate flavor is also great. I'm not getting paid to say this either!",
      "2) The amount of liquid in the dough and the rising times are estimates.",
      "3) I do not recommend using a 9x13\" dish to bake these in. I don't think they cook evenly in a larger pan which is why I recommend using 2 eight-inch cake pans instead.",

      "1. Bring a small pot of water to a boil. Gently place apricots into the boiling water and allow to simmer for 1 minute. While water is going, prepare an ice bath. After 1 minute transfer the apricots from the boiling water to the cold water. When cool enough to handle, using a paring knife, peel the skin off of the apricots. Remove the pit, cut them into a dice and set aside.",
      "2. Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to 425 F.",
      "3. Place flour, baking powder, baking soda, sugar and salt in a large bowl. Whisk together until thoroughly combined.",
      "4. Using a box grater, grate the cold butter into the flour mixture. Working quickly, and using your hands, mix the butter into the flour mixture until it resembles a coarse meal. Gently stir in apricots, being sure to coat them in the flour mixture. Measure out the buttermilk in a measuring cup and add one egg; beat until combined. Pour the buttermilk into the dough mixture and mix until the dough begins to form, about 30 seconds.",
      "5. Transfer dough and all dry, floury bits to a liberally floured counter top and knead dough by hand just until it comes together into a rough, slightly sticky ball. This will only take 5 to 10 seconds. Pat the dough flat to a 1-inch thickness. You can cut the scones into 8 wedges or you can use a biscuit cutter. I did the former and ended up with 8 triangular scones. Place the scones on a parchment-lined baking sheet. In a small bowl beat an egg with a tablespoon of milk and brush the tops of the scones with the egg wash.",
      "6. Transfer the baking sheet to the hot oven and bake until scones are light brown, 12 to 15 minutes. Cool on a wire rack for at least 10 minutes. Serve warm with butter and honey, if you like."

Turn off the heat and add the chow mein noodles and stir to coat. Immediately add some of the noodles to each of the bowls. Working quickly, use the back of a large spoon (sprayed with cooking spray) to help shape the bowls into something that resembles nests. They set up fast so you may want to enlist the assistance of a helper to shape the bowls before the sugar begins to harden. Allow the nests to complete cool before removing them from the bowls. Store in air-tight containers. These are best when used within 24 hours of making."

I cleaned my coffee grinder out really well and put some of the decorating sugar in it (the granules were too big) and ground it finer. Then I put it in a bowl and added some regular white sugar to make it go further. Also, I made one bowl with regular white sugar, added a few sprinkles of turmeric and then a couple of drops of liquid chlorophyll. This became a nice yellow! And I used a few all natural jelly beans on a couple of peeps for eyes, but they were really too big.",

      "Activating the yeast: bring 1 cup of the water to 115\u00b0. This is a good temperature for yeast-not too hot, not too cold. If you want to be particular about it, you can use a thermometer to measure the temperature. I like to turn on the tap water and run it over my wrist. When the water feels like the temperature of my skin (with no cold splashes or hot pockets), it's ready. Mix the water, yeast, and sugar in a medium-sized bowl. Set it aside to rise, about 15 minutes.",
      "Mixing the dry ingredients: combine the almond flour, corn flour, sweet rice flour, potato starch, tapioca flour, xanthan gum, and salt together. Whisk them together in a food processor, or in a stand mixer, or with a whisk. Combining them into one flour will help the final cinnamon rolls to be light, rather than dense and lumpy. Add the brown sugar and milk powder. Stir to combine.",
      "Finishing the dough: bring the remaining 1/2 cup of water to 110\u00b0. If you have a stand mixer, move the dry ingredients into the bowl of the stand mixer. (If not, you can make this dough with a hand mixer or by hand.) Turn the mixer on medium-low speed and add the yeasty water, then the eggs, 1 at a time, mixing in between. Mix for a few minutes until the dough comes together. If the dough feels a bit too dry, add the remaining water. (I always seem to need it.) The dough should be soft and a bit shaggy, but not soggy. It will NOT be as firm as you expect a gluten dough to be. Instead, you are aiming for pliable and a bit spongy, like a cookie dough.",
      "Yeast doughs will vary in behavior depending on the weather. These measurements are a guide. If you find you need another splash of water to make the dough feel right, then go ahead. If the dough feels too wet (like you need to wipe your hands after touching it), then add a touch more potato starch. Start to trust your instincts.",
      "Letting the dough rise: move the dough to a large greased bowl. Cover with a clean tea towel and set the bowl in a warm place in the kitchen. Allow it to rise until it has doubled in size, about 1 hour. The dough will have become a bit more pliable, a little more like gluten dough, at this point.",
      "Rolling out the dough: grab a Silpat (or piece of parchment paper) and lay it on a large baking sheet. Move 1/2 of the dough onto the Silpat and cover it entirely with plastic wrap. Slowly, roll out the dough to the edge of the baking sheet. (You're rolling out its width, first.) I try to make the dough the width of the rolling pin. Next, spin around the baking sheet and roll out the dough lengthwise. You probably won't take it as far as the edge. Simply roll it out to about 1/2-inch thick. Take off the plastic wrap.",
      "Making the filling: melt the butter on the stove, on low heat. Put half the brown sugar, cinnamon, agave nectar, golden raisins, and walnuts onto the rolled-out dough. Drizzle 1/4 of the melted butter on top.",
      "Rolling the dough: here's the important part-go slowly. Grab the Silpat on the edge farthest from you and pull it up gently. The edge of the dough should start to roll away from the Silpat and toward the dough. If not, then nudge it with your fingers. Make tight rolls, moving slowly and patting the dough gently as you go. Roll the dough, then press it down with the Silpat, then roll some more, with the dough falling toward you, going slowly. If the filling oozes out as you reach the end, that's okay. It's a sign you're going to have good cinnamon rolls.",
      "(Nothing of this should be about being perfect, anyway.)",
      "Cutting the dough into rolls: go grab your dental floss. Yes, your dental floss. Cut a long piece of it, longer than two hand widths apart. Slide the piece under the log of dough, then bring the two edges together to cross over the top. By doing this, you should be slicing a piece off the log. This makes for lovely, neat pieces, instead of jagged hunks. Make your way down the log of dough with the dental floss. You should end up with about 8 pieces, with ragged end bits as well.",
      "(Sometimes I bake the ragged ends separately, as little cinnamon swirls. Sometimes I just throw them in.)",
      "Preparing to rise the rolls again: pour 2 tablespoons of the melted butter into the bottom of a pie pan. Place the sliced rolls into the buttered pan, tightening the rolls if they have begun to unravel. Set them aside to rise.",
      "Repeat this process with the other half of the dough and remaining filling.",
      "Allow the rolls to rise for 1 more hour. Gluten-free doughs do not rise as high as gluten doughs do on the second rise, but they do puff out nicely. It's worth it.",
      "Baking the rolls: preheat the oven to 350\u00b0. When the oven has come to temperature, slide in both pans. Bake until the rolls feel firm to the touch when you press on both sides of one, but still with some give, about 25 minutes.",
      "Allow the rolls to cool for about 10 minutes, then invert them onto a plate.",
      "Frosting the rolls: put the butter and cream cheese into a food processor. Whirl them up. While that is mixing, pour in the vanilla extract. Add the powdered sugar in handfuls, looking at the texture of the frosting between batches. It usually takes about 2 cups for frosting to be thick and rich in our food processor, but you may like a different texture. This is only a guide.",
      "Frost the rolls when they have reached room temperature.",
      "Go at it.",
      "Makes about 16 cinnamon rolls."

Use the dough right away, or place in a mixing bowl and refrigerate for up to 3 days, punching down the dough if it rises to the top of the bowl. (Note: dough is easier to work with if it's been chilled for at least an hour or so beforehand.)",
      "Preheat the oven to 375\u00b0F.",
      "To assemble the rolls, remove half the dough from the pan/bowl. On a floured baking surface, roll the dough into a large rectangle, about 30 x 10 inches. The dough should be rolled very thin.",

Generously sprinkle half of the ground cinnamon and 1 cup of the sugar over the butter. Don't be afraid to drizzle on more butter or more sugar! Gooey is the goal.",
      "Now, beginning at the end farthest from you, roll the rectangle tightly towards you. Use both hands and work slowly, being careful to keep the roll tight. Don't worry if the filling oozes as you work; that just means the rolls are going to be divine. When you reach the end, pinch the seam together and flip the roll so that the seam is face down. When you're finished, you'll wind up with one long buttery, cinnamony, sugary, gooey log.",
      "Slip a cutting board underneath the roll and with a sharp knife, make 1/2-inch slices. One \"log \"will produce 20 to 25 rolls. Pour a couple of teaspoons of melted butter into disposable foil cake pans and swirl to coat. Place the sliced rolls in the pans, being careful not to overcrowd. (Each pan will hold 7 to 9 rolls.)",
      "Repeat the rolling/sugar/butter process with the other half of the dough and more pans. Preheat the oven to 375\u00b0F.

Press dough out into a flat rectangle 9 or 12 inches wide, depending on the size of the loaf pan you are using. Roll the dough up into a loaf and pinch the bottom seam together. Then pinch the ends together and down so that from the top, the loaf has a nice shape. Place the dough seam side down in a greased 4.5\"x12\" or 5\"x9\" loaf pan. Cover with plastic wrap and let it rise until slightly more than double, about another hour.",
      "When the loaf is about half risen, start preheating the oven at 375\u00b0F. When the loaf is properly risen, carefully remove the plastic wrap and bake in the center rack of the oven for approximately 30 minutes. When done, the loaf should have a nice golden crust, sound hollow when thumped, and have an internal temperature around 200\u00b0F. Remove bread from the pan promptly to cool on a wire rack. Cool completely before storing in an airtight container at room temperature for up to five days or over a week in the refrigerator.",
      "NOTE: Soy flour helps you end up with a loaf that is more moist and tender and it also helps the loaf to have better shelf life. If you can't find soy flour or would rather not use it, you can simply substitute bread flour instead."

Wrap each disk in plastic and refrigerate at least 30 minutes. Try to work quickly and handle the dough as little as possible so the warmth of your hands doesn't melt the butter.",
      "ASSEMBLING THE PIE:",
      "Take one the disks of dough and lay it on a large piece of waxed paper. Cover it with another sheet of waxed paper and roll the crust out into a circle about 3\" bigger in diameter than your pie plate. Roll from the middle outwards, not back and forth. Remove the top sheet of waxed paper. Center the pie plate upside down on the dough and flip it over. Remove the bottom sheet and press the dough down into the bottom and sides of the pie plate. Leave the dough hanging over the edges for now. Place the pie shell in the refrigerator.",
      "In a large bowl, stir the apples up with the remaining ingredients. Let sit for at least 15 minutes covered with plastic wrap.",
      "After the apple mixture has set 15 minutes, it will be very juicy. Stir it up again to evenly coat the apples. Take the pie shell out of the refrigerator and pour the apple mixture into it. Place back in the refrigerator.",
      "Meanwhile, roll out the second disk of dough just like the first one. Take your filled pie shell out of the refrigerator and lay the second crust evenly on top of the pie. Cut off excess dough so that it's even with the bottom crust. You want about an inch hanging over the sides. Reserve the excess dough pieces for making decorative shapes if you like. Roll the edges up, curling the bottom dough around the top dough and pinching to seal. Crimp the edges with your fingers or a fork.",
      "Cut a few slits in the top dough for ventilation. If desired, roll out the extra dough and cut decorative shapes. I make a few leaves to put between three ventilation slits. Adhere them to the pie with a bit of water. Next, brush the entire top of the pie with a bit of water and sprinkle with sugar.",
      "At this point, I let the whole pie sit in the refrigerator for at least an hour. You don't have to, but I find that it just helps if the crust is super cold before baking.",
      "Bake at 425 degrees for 15 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees and cook another 40 minutes until the juices are bubbling through the slits. Once the pie crust has become golden brown to your liking, cover the pie with a foil tent and continue baking. Do this quickly so you don't lose too much heat from the oven.",
      "Let the pie cool thoroughly until just slightly warm. Serve with whipped cream or vanilla ice cream! Yum, yum, yum!",
      "Store covered with plastic wrap in the refrigerator. Warm individual slices in the microwave. In mine, it takes about 15 seconds."

Using a round biscuit cutter, cut out circles of dough. Stretch the dough just a little lengthwise and dip one half into melted butter. Fold dough over in half and place on the pan. Place the rolls close to each other in rows. Repeat with remaining half of dough. Work the left-over dough from the two dough halves together to finish making your rolls. You should be able to get 32 rolls on a large baking sheet (4 rolls across and 8 rolls down).",

      "For the cupcakes:",
      "1. Preheat your oven to 375 F. Place muffin liners in the cups of two 12-count muffin trays and stick an Oreo in each cup, set aside.",
      "2. In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream together butter and sugar until light and fluffy, 5 to 6 minutes.",
      "3. Add eggs, one at a time, and beat until creamy, occasionally scraping down sides of the bowl using a spatula.",
      "4. In a large bowl, sift together flour, baking powder, and salt.",
      "5. In a small bowl, mix together half-and-half, vanilla and vanilla seeds.",
      "6. With mixer on low speed, add flour mixture into the creamed sugar mixture, alternating with the vanilla mixture, beginning and ending with flour. Beat until just combined.",
      "7. Divide batter into the muffin cups so that each cup is about 3/4 of the way full.",
      "8. Bake until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Remove from oven and allow cupcakes to cool in the pan for about 15 minutes. Then remove them from the pan and cool the rest of the way on a wire rack.",
      "For the marshmallow filling:",
      "In the clean bowl of your electric mixer beat together the marshmallow creme, butter, vanilla and heavy cream until smooth. Then gradually add the powdered sugar until it's all in. Then increase the speed of the mixer and beat for one minute. Pop into the fridge until you need it.",
      "For the Oreo buttercream:",
      "1. In the clean bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the soft butter for 7 minutes on high. Time it. This is what gives it that ice cream flavor so don't cut it short.",
      "2. Once the butter is all creamy and beaten slow the mixer down to low and add in the powdered sugar. Beat until smooth and creamy again.",
      "3. Add the cream gradually, a couple tablespoons at a time while keeping the mixer on low. Keep adding until the frosting is a pipe-able consistency. Then mix in the vanilla.",
      "4. OK, so here is where I kinda messed up as far visually. I made the frosting while the cupcakes where cooling and it was going to be a while before I actually piped them. I went ahead and added the cookies into the frosting and I shouldn't have. They still looked OK and tasted great but by the time I actually used the frosting I needed to beat it a little more to loosen it up and then the cookies had softened and then I beat it and the frosting kind of turned black as you can see in the photo. So ... When you are ready to use the frosting fold the cookie crumbs into the frosting until fully incorporated. Then you will have frosting that looks exactly like cookies and cream ice cream and pretty much tastes the same-just not as cold. YUM!",
      "For the assembly:",
      "1. First find yourself a small round cookie cutter if you have one. If not you could probably just cut out a circle with a sharp knife. Use the cutter and cut down into the top of the cupcake (don't go all the way through) and then twist until the cutout comes loose and you can remove it. Do this with all the cupcakes. Set the cutout next to each cupcake because you'll use it in a second.",
      "2. Then fill the hole on each cupcake with about a tablespoon of the marshmallow filling and place the cutout cupcake piece on the top. Repeat with remaining cupcakes.",
      "3. Then fill your piping bag with the buttercream and pipe a swirl around the top of each cupcake, hiding the filling and cutout on top of it.",
      "Serve and enjoy!",

Microwave in 30 second intervals, until the liquid reaches the temperature directed by the yeast manufacturer (typically 120 to 130 F for instant yeast).

      "While the onions are sweating, cut each baked potato into quarters, taking care to keep the skin as intact as possible. Use a regular soup spoon to carefully scrape most of the insides out of each potato quarter into a large bowl, leaving behind a shell of about 1/4 to 1/2 of an inch. When you have eviscerated all your potatoes, line your potato shells up on a baking sheet and cover well with plastic wrap. Refrigerate the shells for later use as potato skins. Use a potato masher to break up the remaining potato pulp. It doesn't need to be 'mashed potato' smooth, just broken into small bits. Some pieces of baked potato are desirable in the finished soup.",
      "Sprinkle the flour evenly over the translucent onions and whisk until smooth. Turn the heat back to medium. Although at first the fat and flour will seem to seize up, it will loosen and become liquid again fairly quickly. Once it returns to a liquid state and begins bubbling, stir constantly and cook for 1 minute. This is your roux, or your thickener, for the soup. Whisk all of the milk into the roux and bring to a simmer. Simmer gently until thickened. To check whether your base has thickened enough, dip a soup or wooden spoon into it and remove it. If the sauce clings to the spoon and is still liquid, you're good to move on to the next step. If it is still thin, simmer a little while longer or until it does coat a spoon.",
      "Whisk the chicken stock into the thickened milk base and then stir all of the smashed potato innards into the soup. With the pot over medium heat, stir frequently to prevent scorching. You don't need to boil the soup; you just need to get it steaming hot. When it is steaming, check the consistency. If it is not thick enough for your liking, sprinkle two tablespoons of instant potato flakes over the top of the soup and stir in quickly. Wait a couple of minutes and check the consistency of the soup again. You can continue adding potato flakes until it is as thick as you like it. We like our soup quite thick, so I have added as much as 1 cup of flakes before. Make sure, though, to wait a couple of minutes between additions, as it takes a little while for potato flakes to reach full thickening power. Stir in the two cups of shredded cheese until it is completely melted. Adjust flavors with salt and pepper to taste.",

      "(Note that this recipe contains raw eggs.)",
      "1. Begin by creating the syrup that will be used to moisten the ladyfingers, referred to hereafter as 'the dunk.' Add the cup of sugar to the cup of water in a small saucepan. Stir until the sugar is dissolved and bring to a full rolling boil. As soon as it begins boiling, remove from heat. Make several cuts in the clementine or tangerine so that it is sliced deeply enough to release some of the juice, but not deeply enough to break up the fruit. Gently drop the clementine into the syrup, cover with a tight-fitting lid and let it steep and cool for 30 minutes. After 30 minutes, fish the fruit out, gently squeeze over the bowl and discard the fruit. Place in a mid-sized bowl, stir in the Grand Marnier and place in the refrigerator to chill completely.",
      "2. Make the blueberry compote. In a small bowl, stir together the 1/2 cup of sugar and 2 tablespoons or cornstarch or arrowroot powder. Toss with the blueberries and orange zest (or orange extract) in a medium saucepan. Add the water and stir over medium-low heat until the blueberries start to give up some of their juices. When there is more liquid in the pan, raise the heat to medium or medium-high and continue stirring until the blueberries begin to burst and simmer. Allow to simmer for 3 minutes, stirring constantly. Remove from the heat and chill in the refrigerator until cold all the way through.",
      "3. Prepare the mascarpone cream. Carefully crack and separate the yolks and whites from your large eggs. Place the yolks and 3/4 cup of sugar into the bowl of your stand mixer or a large mixing bowl. Using the whisk attachment, whip on medium-high speed until the yolk mixture looks thick, creamy and light-yellow. Add the mascarpone all at once and whip on medium-high speed until evenly combined, about 2 minutes. If using the stand-mixer, transfer to a large mixing bowl and set in the refrigerator. If using a large mixing bowl and hand-mixer, simply put the bowl into the refrigerator and turn your attention to the whites.",
      "Mega important tip: if you are using the stand-mixer, carefully wash and dry the bowl and whisk attachment before proceeding!",
      "Whip the egg-whites on high with the whisk attachment on your stand mixer until they form soft peaks. (In other words, when you raise the whisk from the egg whites, it should form a little curlicue on top that looks like the tip of a warm Hershey's Kiss.) With the mixer still running on high, add the remaining two tablespoons of sugar. Run for one minute, stop the mixer to scrape down the sides, and return to high until firm peaks form. (This means that when you raise the whisk from the egg whites, you should be able to recognize exactly where it left the egg whites and there should be no droopy curlicue.) The whites should be very shiny and glossy at this point.",
      "Use a spatula to scrape about 1/3 of the beaten egg whites onto the mascarpone mixture. Use a whisk to incorporate the whites. This lightens the mascarpone cream a bit so that you can more easily fold the remaining whites into it. Scrape the rest of the beaten whites onto the mascarpone cream. Use a rubber or silicone spatula to fold the whites into the cream. Don't panic! While it sounds futzy, it's really easy to fold egg whites into heavier mixtures. The best way to do this is to picture your mixing bowl as a clock. Insert the spatula, blade side down, into the center of the mixture and gently plunge it to the bottom of the bowl. Pull the spatula back toward six o'clock. When you hit the edge of the bowl, rotate the spatula so that the flat part scrapes against the bowl. Turn the spatula back blade side up at a 45-degree angle. Lift the spatula, and the contents on top of it and gently turn it over. Rotate the bowl about 15 minutes (a quarter turn) and repeat until there are no little white 'clumps' of egg white remaining. By this point, you should have an even, creamy and fluffy mascarpone cream. Place this, lightly covered, into the refrigerator until you're ready to proceed (but no longer than an hour in advance!).",
      "4. Time to assemble! Plunge the ladyfinger cookies, one at a time, into 'The Dunk' and count to 2. Lift for an additional 2-count to let extra syrup drip away and then arrange the cookies snugly over the bottom of your trifle dish or serving dish. Scoop about 1/4 of the blueberry compote onto the ladyfingers and spread toward the edges. Top with 1/4 of the mascarpone cream and spread toward the edges. Repeat the layers-dunked ladyfingers, blueberry compote, mascarpone cream-until you run out of one item or space to fill. Tightly cover the dish and refrigerate for at least 2 hours prior to serving.",
      "5. The payoff: time to eat! Scoop into serving dishes and eat as is or garnish with fresh blueberries and orange zest."

      "First, remove the membrane and seeds from the Poblano peppers and Serrano chilies. If you would like the soup spicier, you can leave the membrane and seeds for the Serrano chilies. Then slice the peppers, chilies, and onions into shoestring-sized slices. This doesn't need to be exact. Add these to an already heated dust-free pot, along with the olive oil and garlic. I prefer to use a garlic press to crush the garlic right into the pan so I don't lose any of the juices, but if you don't have a garlic press, a fine chop on a cutting board will do. Cook this down until the onions and peppers have lost their structural integrity, about 20 minutes over medium-high heat. Make sure you stir occasionally so you don't burn anything. To this, add the tomatoes. I like to crush them in the pan with the back of a wooden spoon, but you can also crush them before adding to the pot. Add 1 cup of water and cook this until simmering.",
      "To the pot, add the chicken thighs. I strongly recommend using bone-in thighs. There is no escaping the flavor this will add to your soup. I also chose to use the thighs because they tend to be a little fattier (flavor) and I would not need to worry as much about drying them out. Pour in 8 cups of chicken stock, add a generous amount of salt and pepper.",
      "Bring this to a simmer and let cook for 2 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally. Don't get impatient, your time will be well rewarded.",
      "When the skin easily pulls away from the chicken thighs, remove them to a bowl and allow to cool enough to remove the skin, fat and bones.",
      "At this point, turn the heat down so the soup is at a slow simmer. Add heavy cream, just to add some extra richness. Then add the black beans. In a separate bowl, shred the chicken and then add it back to the soup. Cook the soup only as long as necessary to reheat the chicken and beans."

    "ingredients": [],

      "You should begin by blooming your yeast. I was lucky enough to have a KitchenAid mixer when I was preparing my sweet rolls and so I bloomed my yeast in the mixing bowl by adding the yeast package and 1/3 cup heavy cream heated to somewhere between 100\u00b0 and 115\u00b0F.",
      "While that sits, in a separate bowl, mix together the melted butter and egg. Again, be careful when adding the butter; you do not want to scramble the egg. These are not scrambled egg sweet rolls. That just does not sound as delicious now, does it? After that is mixed, add the sugar, salt, and ricotta cheese. Take this mixture and add it to the mixing bowl and incorporate the heavy cream and bloomed yeast.",
      "Now you can begin to incorporate the flour. This should be done in stages, making sure all the flour is incorporated before adding any more. When adding the flour, you are looking for the dough to be moist, but it should pull from the sides of the bowl or your fingers without sticking. Make sure to add the last cup of flour slowly so you don't end up with a dry dough. The weather will also determine how much flour is needed. I'm not saying that you need to have an accurate barometric pressure reading, but when I was making my sweet rolls I was in Arizona, which is known for its dry climate. Because of that, I needed less flour than I would have if I were in Portland, as I am now.",
      "After you have your dough, knead it by hand. This won't take long, assuming you have incorporated all your flour. After kneading, form the dough into a ball and place it in a buttered bowl. Set this bowl aside, loosely covered, for about an hour, giving the dough time to double in size.",
      "Once fully raised, clear off ample counter space, dust lightly with flour, and roll out the dough into a rectangle approximately a quarter inch in thickness (make sure you check to ensure your dough is not sticking to your counter top; nothing is more frustrating). Now you are ready to roll.",
      "(For this recipe, I'm using a cinnamon filling. For peach and strawberry, check the related blog post link!)",
      "Have the filling ingredients ready. With the dough rolled out, use your fingers to spread the butter, making sure to cover all the dough. Then sprinkle around the brown sugar, covering evenly, and then dust with cinnamon. The measurements for the filling are approximations. It is up to your tastes and preferences. I then sprinkled on the chopped pecans. I also like to finish off my cinnamon rolls with a light drizzle of heavy cream. This is a trick I picked up from my grandma and it will make your cinnamon rolls moist and rich.",
      "Now you can roll up the dough. Try to keep the roll as tight as possible without squeezing out your filling. Once rolled, cut into rounds about 1 1/2 to 2 inches in thickness and place into your baking pans. Two 10\" pie pans will work well, or you can use a large Pyrex pan.",
      "For our cinnamon rolls (which I must confess are more like sticky buns because they lack the cream cheese frosting), we made a simple caramel sauce by melting 1/4 cup butter, 1/4 cup heavy cream, and 1/2 cup brown sugar. Let this simmer to thicken. Then, pour the caramel into your buttered pie pans and add roughly chopped pecans prior to placing your rolls in the pan.",
      "Once your rolls are placed in the pans, cover them loosely and let raise for another hour, or until double in size.",
      "Preheat your oven to 375\u00b0F and bake for 25 to 30 minutes. Check the rolls after 20 minutes to make sure they are not getting too brown. You are looking for a nice browning and for the rolls to spring back when pressed gently with your finger."

      "Oct 2015 update: TIPS! Use only real butter!! (My personal preference is the organic salted butter from Costco as to me it has a more rich and buttery taste.) Do not use margarine, tub spreads, Country Crock, etc as the frosting is likely to separate. Some people like to use superfine sugar instead of regular granulated sugar, or to run the granulated sugar through a food processor first to make their own superfine sugar. If you taste flour or paste when it's done, I suspect the flour/milk mixture didn't cook long enough, don't be in a hurry to bring the milk/flour to the thickened state, let it have time to cook that flour taste out as it thickens. Did you get lumps? whisk whisk whisk as it cooks! One person recommended using a hand mixer as it cooks to avoid lumps, Some people use 3 T of flour instead of 5. I've made it with soy milk, non-fat milk and all the way through to half-n-half and it's turned out great for me using any of those. I've put it in piping bags and decorated with it, I've left it on the counter and I've also refrigerated it. I'm not a professional baker and while I've never had this recipe fail, I highly recommend reading the comments, there are great tips and helpful comments! Some have recommendations for adding cocoa powder, cherry, fresh strawberries, using coconut oil, etc. One person used lavender and earl grey tea in it (I recommended she post that recipe!) Some people have put the sugar in with the milk/flour mixture instead of creaming it with the butter. (I've tried that and personally wasn't a fan as it completely changed the flavor, and texture, of the frosting in the end.) Also, while I like this best on chocolate cake, you can use it on any flavor of cake. In fact, it's the original, very old, frosting for Red Velvet Cake. Yep, that's right! Cream cheese frosting is not the original frosting for Red Velvet",

Stir in the vanilla extract and then the salt and cocoa powder. Mix until the cocoa powder is integrated and the batter is smooth and creamy, sort of like a thick frosting. Add the all-purpose flour and mix just until the batter is no longer dusty looking; it might still be a bit crumbly, and that's okay. You don't want to over mix and end up with tough cookies.",
      "Turn the dough out onto a counter, gather it into a ball, and knead it just once or twice to bring it together into one nice, smooth mass. Place the ball of dough into a large plastic bag and flatten it into a disk roughly 3/4-inch thick. Place the dough in the freezer for 20 minutes to chill.",
      "Rollout and bake:",
      "Remove the dough from the freezer and roll it out really thin-remember how thin Thin Mints are? That's how thin you need your dough, about 1/8-inch. You can either roll it out between two sheets of plastic, or dust your counter and rolling pin with a bit of flour and do it that way. Stamp out cookies using a 1 1/2-inch cutter or whatever shape you want (I used a shot glass). Place cookies on a parchment-lined baking sheet and bake for 10 minutes. Remove the cookies from the oven and allow them to cool completely on a baking rack if you've got one.",
      "Make the peppermint coating:",
      "While the cookies are in the oven, you can get the coating ready. I use a makeshift double boiler to melt chocolate (a metal pan over a saucepan of gently simmering water), but I know many people who swear by melting chocolate in the microwave. Slowly melt the chocolate, stirring occasionally until it is glossy and smooth. Stir in the peppermint extract. If you think the chocolate needs a bit more peppermint kick, add more extract a drop or two at a time, but don't go overboard.",
      "Finishing the cookies:",
      "You are going to coat the cookies one at a time and then gently set them on a parchment-lined baking sheet to set. Drop one cookie into the chocolate and (using a fork) carefully make sure it gets fully coated. Lift the cookie out of the chocolate with the fork and bang the fork on the side of the pan to drain any extra chocolate off the cookie. You are after a thin, even coating of chocolate. Place on the aforementioned prepared baking sheet, and repeat for the rest of the cookies. Place the cookies in the refrigerator or freezer to set. I put them in the freezer for 20 minutes and then transferred them to the fridge. I like 'em cold. Always have.",

Be ready to chase the occasional stray kid/husband from the kitchen with a wooden spoon. They will try everything to get at those chocolate cakes.",

In the top of a completely cooled cupcake, insert the tip of the pastry bag about halfway and squeeze in some frosting. Stop when it begins to bulge. If you go too far down, the frosting will probably burst out the bottom. Don't worry, though. The mistakes can still be covered in chocolate! Place cupcakes on lined sheets frosting side up.",
      "Now, clean up that mess and continue to chase away those pesky kids with a wooden spoon. In the top of a double boiler set over medium heat, melt the chopped paraffin completely. Add the chocolates and stir until smooth and heavenly. Think Willy Wonka's chocolate river. Remove from heat and begin dipping. Place each cupcake into the chocolate, insertion side up. Push down on all sides so that the chocolate comes over the top a little. Don't cover the frosting hole with chocolate. Remove from its bath with a couple of forks and flip it insertion side down onto your prepped sheets. When they are all finished, place in the fridge to set. By the time you are finally finished cleaning up the war zone, you will be able to sample a homegrown ding dong! That will be the only one you get, because your husband and your children are professional ding dong devourers.",

Once it's doubled in volume, chill the dough for a bit (will keep fine in fridge for several days if you want to make the dough ahead of time) to make it easier to handle (this can be skipped if you don't have the time). Then set up your knotting station. Put out a large wooden cutting board and oil it liberally. Grab a rolling dowel or pin and oil it. Grab a pizza cutter or something similar to slice dough in strips. Put your container of flour within easy reach. Line several sheet pans with parchment paper or silpats and place within easy reach.",

Take the first half, slap it onto the oiled board several times to flatten. Using the dowel, spread into an even rectangle approximately 5\"x16\" and 1/2\" thick. Then slice the rectangle into 1/2\"x5\" strips.",

Tie into a knot (over, under, and through) and place on your lined sheet pan. Place knots about an 1 1/2\" apart. At first it may seem awkward making the knots but with a little practice it will become easy. Flour is your friend to help keep the dough from sticking to itself while forming the knots.",

      "Using kitchen scissors, cut each marshmallow in half through the middle. (I cut all the marshmallows from one bag in half, then about 12 from the second bag. You can always cut more if you find you need them.) Dipping the scissors in hot water, then drying them off after a few cuts will make it a lot easier to cut the marshmallows.",
      "Place the marshmallows, cut side up, on a cookie sheet or tray.",
      "I usually put the candy thermometer in the pan before adding the ingredients. That way, I can adjust the height of the thermometer and make sure the bulb at the bottom doesn't touch the bottom of the pan.",
      "Combine cream, sugar, corn syrup and salt in a DEEP medium saucepan. Make sure it's a deep one and if it's heavy, all the better. I recommend nonstick, but it doesn't have to be. It just makes clean up easier. I use a heat diffuser under my pan since it isn't that heavy. This is by no means necessary, but I've found it helpful to keep the mixture from scorching. Once I get the ingredients stirred and combined well, I clip the thermometer in place.",
      "Bring mixture to a boil over low heat, stirring constantly. The mixture will start out milky white, then it will go through several color stages as it cooks. It seems to take forever to get to 220 degrees, and once it does, it seems to stay there forever! It takes a while (at least on my stove) to get to 225 degrees. Once it hits 225 degrees, the bubbles will start to rise up towards the top of the pan. As long as you stir it down, it shouldn't boil over (that's why I suggest the DEEP saucepan). The mixture will also start to change color - you'll see it starting to get a light golden color. Keep stirring and checking that candy thermometer! At 230 degrees, the color will deepen a little more.",
      "You're almost there! 235 degrees is the magic number. This temperature doesn't seem to take as long to reach as the others. You'll also notice that the mixture feels slightly thicker as you're stirring. Keep your eye on the thermometer and remove the pan from the heat when the thermometer reaches 235 degrees (soft ball stage).",
      "I use a small heating pad under my pan because it's not thick and doesn't hold the heat that well. You want the butterscotch to stay nice and warm to make it easy to dip the marshmallows. My husband came up with the idea of wrapping a towel around the pan and clothespin it to help keep some of the heat in. He does come up with good ideas sometimes!",
      "Let the pan sit for 3-5 minutes to take some of that boiling heat away. I usually stir the butterscotch for a few minutes to sort of cool it down a little; if you dip the marshmallows immediately after removing it from the heat, they'll hit that hot butterscotch and start to melt right away. I stir until I feel the mixture gets a tad bit thicker and see it start to drip slower off of the wooden spoon.",
      "Start dipping your marshmallows; drop a marshmallow in the mixture, one at a time; coat one side, then quickly flip the marshmallow over, using a meat fork and a cake tester or wooden skewer.",
      "Lift the marshmallow out with the fork (don't stab it; use the cake tester to place it onto the fork); let some of the excess butterscotch drip back into the pan. Ease the marshmallow off of the fork with the help of the cake tester and onto parchment paper-lined baking sheets. Don't worry if there's puddling around the marshmallows; that's perfectly normal. You'll also notice that the first 10-20 marshmallows don't look as coated as the ones you do later; that's normal too. As the butterscotch cools, it thickens so the more marshmallows you dip, the thicker the coating.",
      "As you get towards the bottom of the pan, the butterscotch may thicken to the point that the marshmallows don't want to coat. If that happens, take the pan back to the stove and heat it over low heat just to rewarm the butterscotch. You don't want to boil it, all you want to do is loosen it up enough to make the butterscotch the same thickness it was when you began dipping. Continue dipping until all the butterscotch is used.",
      "You'll have over 100 pieces, depending on the size of the marshmallows. Don't worry about all of that excess butterscotch around the marshmallows - that will all get scraped up and wrapped with the candy.",
      "Let the pans of coated marshmallows sit overnight to dry out. They won't be bone dry; you should be able to touch them with your finger and not have them stick like super glue. The salt is what helps dry them out. How do I know that? I forgot to put it in once and the coating stayed really, really sticky!",
      "Now comes the tedious part: the wrapping. My suggestion is to get a roll of plastic wrap specifically for these. Get the cheapest one you can find and cut the brand new roll in half through the middle. My husband Bob does this for me by putting a razor blade in a vise and holding both ends of the roll, rotates the roll of plastic wrap around the razor. This makes it SO much easier than cutting that clingy wrap in half piece by piece.",
      "Tear pieces large enough to wrap the candies. (Yes, I throw them in a pile and yes they cling together, but oh well. They don't call it cling wrap for nothing, right?) Lay individual squares of plastic wrap down and place a marshmallow on the center of each piece.",
      "Using a butter knife, run the knife under a marshmallow, lift it off of the parchment paper and place it in the center of the plastic wrap. Fold one side of plastic wrap over marshmallow; repeat with other side. Twist each end of the plastic wrap. Repeat to wrap all of the marshmallows.",
      "Store in an airtight container. They'll keep at room temperature for a good 2 weeks.",
      "When it comes time to eat them, unwrap the marshmallow and eat it right off the plastic wrap. You can pick it off the wrap with your fingers, but that might be a tad messy. Then again, what a good excuse to lick your fingers!",
      "If you find the marshmallows are really sticky when you try and peel the wrapping off, you can refrigerate them for a few minutes. But I feel they lose a little of their butterscotch flavor when they're chilled.",
      "By the way, this isn't something to make in the hot weather. I don't think they'd set up well in heat and humidity. Save making these for a cool dry day."

Place cheesecake back into the pressure cooker, uncovered, and allow it to sit until pressure cooker is room temperature or cold.

When cheesecake has cooled to room temperature, take a thin blade knife and run it carefully around the edge of the cheesecake. Cover with plastic wrap and/or foil and refrigerate at least 4 hours, preferably overnight.",

Not that I am speaking from experience... wah wah.) Sprinkle a bit of flour over the top of the dough, as it will be VERY sticky.",

Place the dough on the counter on a piece of parchment paper and cover with a towel. Let rise for another 1 to 1 1/2 hours.",

This time, I kept the whole thing wrapped up in a towel after I cut it, and then put the whole thing (towel and all) in a Ziplock bag to store. The towel helped keep the moisture in without making the crust soggy, and the dough stayed fresh and soft! Try it!"

      "2. Mix flour and salt in a mixing bowl.",
      "3. Slowly stir in liquid mixture and mix very well.",
      "4. Knead dough for a good 5 minutes or until you have a good elastic quality to the bread. If you have a stand mixer or a food processor you can do this step using those. It will make it easier and might take less time. It can also be done by hand very easily.",
      "5. Cover bowl with a wet towel and set aside for at least 30 minutes.",
      "6. Preheat oven to 400. You want the oven really hot so make sure you do this at least 30 minutes before you want to cook your pizza.",
      "7. In a medium sized mixing bowl combine rhubarb, 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla, 1 teaspoon of lemon juice, cinnamon, nutmeg, brown sugar and cornstarch.",
      "8. When dough has doubled in size and oven is hot roll out the dough. I baked mine on a pizza stone but if you don't have one just roll out the dough on a greased pizza pan or baking sheet.",
      "Note: When you place the dough on the baking sheet, make sure you create a lip or edge for this pizza. You will need this to hold in the filling/topping. Trust me! You do NOT want to learn the hard way, like I did the first time I made this. Brown sugar + liquid + hot oven = smoke. And a mess. BIG MESS. So do yourself a favor and make sure you make a nice edge on your pizza. It doesn't have to be huge...it just needs to be there.",
      "9. Pour topping on top of pizza crust and spread around as evenly as possible.",
      "10. Bake at 400F for 15-20 minutes or until golden brown on edges and the sauce is bubbly.",
      "11. While pizza is baking make the icing.",
      "12. In a stand mixer bowl or with a hand held mixer blend powdered sugar, the remaining vanilla and lemon juice, the butter and milk/water until you have a smooth, somewhat runny icing. Place in a zip-lock bag and set in the fridge until ready to use. (You can also use a piping bag but I don't have those on hand.)",
      "13. When pizza is done take out and let cool for about 5 minutes.",
      "14. Snip off just the very corner of the zip-lock bag and drizzle the frosting over the pizza.",
      "15. Cut and serve."

      "Over-mixing the butter and sugar in this step will cause too much air to be incorporated into the dough. If you'd like a light and fluffy cookie, that's ideal, however the dough will spread more during baking, which is not ideal if you'd like the cookie to hold its shape.",

      "5. Add all of the flour mixture to the bowl. Place a large tea towel or two small tea towels between the edge of the bowl and the electric mixer so that the flour won't escape. Mix on low speed for 3o seconds. Remove the tea towels and observe the dough mixing; when it clumps around the paddle attachment, it's ready. It's also important at this stage not to over-mix the dough (the glutens in the flour develop and the dough can become tough).",

      "Have a greased cookie sheet ready. You will also need a candy thermometer.",
      "In medium saucepan/pot, combine sugar and corn syrup. Turn heat to medium. This first stage of cooking is not quite as critical, but you will need to keep this under a close watch. I like to keep my candy thermometer in the pot, so I can see where the temperature is at. Keep it stirred and let it boil until it reaches 235\u00b0F (or softball) on the thermometer.",
      "Add the margarine and peanuts. Continue stirring and watching the temperature closely, it needs to boil to 302\u00b0F (or hard crack). This stage is a bit more crucial; you do not want it to heat too quickly or it will result in a sticky peanut brittle. Keep the heat around medium (I put it at 4 on my electric stove), and if the temperature doesn't continue rising, put it up just a bit higher. Sometimes it can take a while for it to reach the next temperature.",
      "When it reaches 302\u00b0F, add the baking soda and remove from heat. You will need to stir it quickly and then pour it out on your greased baking sheet. I've also found that it helps to get it to the right consistency if you can put in a cooler place (rather than letting it sit in a warm kitchen) to cool down. I like to set it down in my basement.",
      "To get your saucepan clean again, turn your kitchen faucet to hot, and let that water run into it, letting it soak in very hot water for a while.",
      "After the peanut brittle is completely cooled, break it into pieces and store in an airtight container (or ice cream bucket).",
      "This recipe comes from my mother-in-law, who got it from her mother-in-law, and I'm not sure where she got it. It is definitely a family favorite! Enjoy!"

      "Note: this recipe makes enough dough to make fresh bread all week long. You just take a handful at a time and bake as needed. The dough itself will keep for at least two weeks. You can use less yeast if you want to, but just make sure you give it enough time to rise. The prep time does not include the initial 3 hours of rest.",
      "To make the dough, put the water in a large container (large enough to hold all of the risen dough-a 3 to 4-qt container should be good). Sprinkle the yeast and salt in it. Then put in all of the flour, and mix using a wooden spoon. Just mix until everything combines and there are no streaks of flour left.",
      "Cover the container (not airtight) and let the dough rise and then deflate a bit, about 3 hours. You can now bake immediately, or store in the refrigerator.",
      "To bake, dust your hands and the surface of the dough with some flour and grab a handful of the dough (about the size of a grapefruit). Gently pull the sides of the dough toward the bottom, rotating the dough, until you get a roundish boule shape with a smooth surface. Be gentle and try not to deflate any gas bubbles. Don't worry about the bottom being smooth, it'll be fine.",
      "Dust a pizza peel with some cornmeal to prevent sticking, and lay the formed dough on it. Let it rest (no need to cover it) for at least 40 minutes, or longer if the dough was chilled. It's best to bake it when it's no longer chilled.",
      "Twenty minutes before you are ready to bake, put a pizza stone in the middle rack of your oven, and put a broiler pan in the bottom rack. Preheat your oven to 450 degrees. Dust some flour on the top of your loaf, and make 1/4-inch deep slashes on the surface of the dough.",
      "After twenty minutes of preheating, slide the loaf onto the pizza stone. Pour a cup of warm tap water into the bottom broiler pan and shut the oven door to keep the steam inside.",
      "Bake for 30 to 40 minutes until you get a nice brown crust. Let cool completely on a wire rack.",
      "You can also bake this in a Dutch oven, which will eliminate the need for the broiler pan with the steam. But I prefer the pizza stone method.",

If you're using whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose flour, you have to use a little bit more than you would all-purpose flour, because it's finer. But the combination of the two worked great for these cookies. If you only have all-purpose flour, you can use about 2 1/4 cups in the recipe. Also, if you click on the related blog post linking to my website, you can find out how to cut the saturated fat in half for these cookies by using Earth Balance buttery sticks and Earth Balance peanut butter.",

    "ingredients": [],

      "Because we are using rapid rise yeast, we will begin by adding the yeast to half of the flour and set aside. Rapid rise yeast is added to dry ingredients first, and then the wet ingredients are added later. But for now, if you are using active dry yeast, this step is the same. In a small saucepan, put milk, 1/3 cup butter, granulated sugar and salt on medium heat, allowing butter to almost melt and the temperature to reach about 120 to 130\u00b0F. If you can, use a thermometer, because if it's too hot, it will not allow the yeast to do its magic. If you don't have a thermometer, a good rule of thumb is to never let it boil or form small bubble around the side of the saucepan. The butter should not be totally melted, but almost, and the liquid should be cool enough to dip your finger in quickly without burning it. Stir occasionally so the sugar will dissolve. It is better to have the liquid on the cooler side than on the hotter side.",
      "Once warmed to desired temperature, add the liquid mixture to the flour and yeast and mix, along with the eggs and almond extract, on medium speed for thirty seconds. Stop and scrape the sides of the bowl, and then mix on high speed for three more minutes. Add in the rest of the flour a little at a time until it's fully incorporated. If you are using a KitchenAid, make sure to use the hook attachment for this step. If not, then use a wooden spoon and do it by hand. Once incorporated, place the dough on a floured surface and knead for a few minutes, adding any extra flour that you could not incorporate into the mixing step. Form into a ball and let rest for ten minutes.",
      "While it's resting, mix the brown sugar, cinnamon, and a dash of flour into a small bowl. Heat the remaining butter in the microwave to melt, and set aside. Once the dough has rested for ten minutes, roll out into a rectangular shape (the ends will come to more of a point). The dough should be about 1/4 inch thick. You can make it thinner, it just depends on how thick you want your rolls to be.",
      "Use a pastry brush, or just a spoon, and spread half of the melted butter evenly over the dough, leaving about 1/2 to 1 inch of space on each side. Sprinkle brown sugar mixture evenly over the butter. Use a spoon to make sure it's evenly dispersed. Now sprinkle half of the coconut flakes evenly over the filling, and then the sea salt on top of that. Roll the dough starting at the bottom point, and rolling towards the top point. It will be full, so try and roll tightly, but be careful not to rip the dough. Once rolled, pinch the ends that do not have any filling in them and use a bread knife to cut them off. Carefully cut the dough into about 1-1/2-inch pieces (again, depends on how thick you want your rolls to be and how many). Place each piece into the baking pan and cover in a warm place for about 40 minutes to an hour to let them rise. Mine didn't look that giant, but they still worked.",
      "While you are waiting, preheat the oven to 375\u00b0F. Once heated, place the remaining coconut flakes on a cookie sheet and bake for about 5 minutes, watching closely so that the coconut gets toasted and not burned. Remove from the oven. Continue to let the dough rise. I leave the oven on and have the rolls on the stove so that the heat allows them to rise faster.",
      "For the frosting, place powdered sugar into a mixing bowl, and add a small portion of the milk. Mix on low, scraping the sides of the bowl, and add the rest of the milk in small doses, watching the texture of the icing. Some people like the icing thick, others thin, so add more or less milk accordingly. Add almond or coconut extract to taste.",
      "Once rolls have risen, place in the oven for 25-30 minutes or until golden brown. Remove and let cool slightly, then pour the frosting over the rolls. Serve warm, and add the toasted coconut on top.",
      "Enjoy!",
      "Note: If using active dry yeast, place the dough ball into a greased bowl, cover and let double in size, about 1-1 1/2 hours. Punch down the dough, then follow the steps above like the rest of the recipe."

      "To make the oats, bring water to a boil in a deep pot. Add oats and cook until they begin to thicken. Reduce to a simmer, and continue cooking, uncovered, until grains are slightly tender and water has mostly absorbed, about 15 to 20 minutes. Turn off heat, cover pot and let sit for 5 minutes before serving.",
      "Make-ahead note: this recipe actually yields enough oats for 6 to 8 servings. Since they reheat very well, this is an easy solution to cut out the normally long cooking time on busy weekday mornings. Store leftovers in a covered container. Spoon your individual portions into a bowl, adding a tablespoon or two of milk or water, then cover and microwave until heated through-about 1 minute does the job in my 1000-watt microwave.",
      "To prepare the onions, heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add onions and season with salt and pepper. Saute until they begin to soften and become golden, about 5 minutes. Stir in molasses, and a touch more olive oil if necessary. Cover skillet and reduce heat to medium-low. Cook, covered, until onions are very tender, about 10 more minutes.",
      "Divide 1 cup of cooked oatmeal among two bowls. Top with equal amounts of caramelized onions and fresh ricotta. Stir together with your spoon before digging in."
