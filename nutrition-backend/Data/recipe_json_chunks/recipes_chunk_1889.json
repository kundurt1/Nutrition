    "title": "fennel, mint & lemon lamb sausage with whisky cream sauce",
    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "For the sausage:",
      "Roast the fennel seeds and chili flakes in a small heavy pan over medium-low heat for 5 to 10 minutes or until just aromatic but not browned.",
      "Lightly grind the fennel seeds and chili flakes in a spice/coffee grinder.",
      "Youll use 1 1/2 teaspoon of it for this recipe and set aside the remainder for another use (see tips).",
      "Use your hands to mix together the 1 1/2 teaspoons of fennel/chili mix, ground lamb and the rest of the sausage ingredients until well combined.",
      "You can form into patties and cook immediately (see cooking instructions below), or for a more restaurant-style presentation, form the mixture into a sausage about 2 in diameter.",
      "Roll and wrap the sausage link tightly in plastic, then turn the ends of the plastic in opposite directions to tighten the wrapping.",
      "Continue to tighten until very firm, then refrigerate for at least 2 hours.",
      "Preheat a heavy frying pan over medium high heat.",
      "Unwrap the sausage, cut 1/2 thick slices and fry until golden, about 3 minutes.",
      "Flip and fry until browned on the other side, about 3 more minutes.",
      "* Dont overcrowd the pan its better to fry it in 2 batches than to end up with steamed sausage.",
      "Remove the sausage to a paper towel-lined plate to drain the grease and tent it with foil to keep warm.",
      "For the whisky sauce:",
      "Lower the heat to medium.",
      "If the pan is very dry after frying the sausage, add a little olive oil to saute the onion and garlic.",
      "Add the onion and garlic to the pan and saute, stirring constantly until aromatic, about 1 minute.",
      "Try not to overbrown/burn.",
      "Deglaze the pan by adding the chicken stock and whisky.",
      "(You can substitute white wine for the whisky in the sauce, or just add more chicken stock if you prefer.)",
      "Reduce the liquid until the pan is almost dry, about 3-4 minutes.",
      "Reduce the heat to low, add the cream and continue to cook at a quick simmer until the sauce coats the back of a spoon, about 3 minutes more.",
      "Arrange the sausages on the plate and spoon the sauce over top.",
      "Serve with mashed potatoes and a green of your choice... Or try some candied turnips!",
      "Ith gu leoir!",
      "(Eat Plenty)",
      "Tips:",
      "I use lamb from right here on my little island.",
      "It tends to be a bit fattier than ground lamb from Australia/NZ (which is what is in most North American grocery stores).",
      "You can always mix a little ground pork in with the lamb for a moister, juicier sausage.",
      "Use the remaining fennel/chili mixture as a rub for your next roast (chicken, beef or pork), or in tacos or tomato sauce.",
      "Preserved lemons are a North African condiment that is my secret ingredient in many dishes.",
      "Theyre easy to make at home and last indefinitely."

      "The size of the pan should correspond to the size of the bird and should not be more than 2 inches deep.",
      "The rack prevents the bird from frying in its own fat.",
      "Slide the pan into the oven.",
      "Roast until an instant-read thermometer inserted deep into the thigh alongside the thigh bone registers 160 to 170 degrees F. The internal temperature depends on your preference for well-done (170 degrees F) or very juicy with a hint of pale pink (160 degrees F).",
      "As a rule of thumb, a 6- to 7- pound turkey will roast in 2 to 2 1/4 hours.",
      "During the first half of the cooking, baste the turkey with the remaining butter-oil mixture and, in time, with its own juices, always remembering to remove the bird from the oven to do so and to shut the oven door immediately after placing the bird on the stove top to baste.",
      "Frequent basting--every 10 to 15 minutes--is critical to the flavor and moisture of the bird.",
      "Retain moisture by turning the turkey onto alternate sides each time it is basted.",

      "This is a tedious task, but the burst of tart, cool juice from the glistening seeds sprinkled over the tender turkey meat makes it well worth the trouble.",
      "Using a sharp paring knife, make a cut in the blossom end of the fruit and peel away the tough outer skin.",
      "Once inside, peel away as much of the white membrane, along with the outer skin, as possible, taking care not to pierce the seeds.",

      "Now pry apart each of the halves to produce 4 sections in all.",
