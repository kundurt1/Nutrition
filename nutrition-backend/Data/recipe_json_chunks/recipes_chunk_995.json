Try not to overmix because this tends to make your meatloaf mixture more dense than is necessary. Mixing gently with your hands, mix in the oats or crackers until mixture is no longer runnuy. If it is, add more crushed crackers, oatmeal and/or pasta, remembering that the pasta will absorb excess liquid only as it cooks. Important: when right, the mixture should retain a shape made by your hand. If you don't get this part right, your meatloaf will not retain its shape when cooked. If you get the mix right, it will cut nicely and likely lose a crumble or two when transfering from the pan to plate. For that reason, I do this in mini muffin pans too and they come out just right, not crumbling.",
      "Put mixture into a loaf pan. Pat lightly to smooth out top of loaf. Cover loaf pan with foil and put in oven. Prepare topping by mixing ketchup with the 1 tsp of brown sugar and set aside.",
      "After 45 minutes, carefully pour off excess grease (place something on top of loaf so it doesn't fall OR use a turkey baster to suck out the juices) and thn spread topping over meatloaf. Put back in oven, uncovered. Cook for 5 more minutes and check to see if loaf is done by using a thermometer reading. If not done, check every five minutes until done. It is done and safe to eat at 160 degrees, but you can take it out at 152 and let it rest for five minutes and the temp will rise to a safe temperature.",
      "I do not trust the \"it's done if it aint pink no more\" method because ground meat products can both look brown long before they are safe to eat and look pink long after they are actually done. A thermometer is just easier to use and safer too. So, you use your own judgment on cook time. I pulled mine out of the oven after 52 minutes of cook time and it was 161 degrees and DELICIOUS.",
      "If you are making mini muffins, start your initial cook time at 30 minutes and keep checking with your temp till the center of the muffins reach at least 155. Also, you still have to remove the excess grease from the pans during cooking. For that reason, when making meatloaf muffins, I put a baking sheet under the pan to catch drips.",
      "A word of warning: This recipe is not friendly to subbing out the pasta or the lean ground meat. If you omit the pasta, the loaf will not be moist and hold its flavor. If you use higher fat ground meat, your pasta will be cooked in grease and the loaf will be mis-shapen, swimming in grease and unappetizing. Believe me, I know -- I've tried both. When you have both ingredients, just try it as it's written and most of all:",

      "Heat the oven to 325\u00b0F Remove the neck, giblets, and tail (save these for the broth recipe) from the turkey, as well as any plastic parts, like leg connectors. Rinse the turkey well inside and out and pat it dry thoroughly with paper towels. Either stuff now, or bake the stuffing separately. Truss the turkey, if you like. Rub the turkey all over with the rub.",
      "For the rub: Combine all the rub ingredients together, hold back 1 1/2 tablespoonfuls of the rub, and lovingly massage the rest into your turkey, making sure you get some under the skin to flavour the meat underneath, as well.",
      "Put the turkey, breast side down, on a V-shaped rack in a roasting pan, preferably a heavy-duty flameproof pan so that you can make the gravy in it later. Roast the turkey (with the legs pointing to the back of the oven if possible) for 1 hour.",
      "With wads of paper towels in both hands, lift the turkey at the neck and tail ends and flip it breast side up. Carefully rub the rest of your herbs onto the breast. Continue roasting until a thermometer inserted in the thickest part of the thighs reads 170\u00b0F, another 2 to 2-1/2 hours (you also have to get a reading of 165F). While the turkey roasts, baste it every 30 minutes or so with pan drippings and rotate the pan occasionally for even browning. Transfer the turkey to a carving board or platter, tent it loosely with foil, and let it rest for 20 to 30 minutes (you can use the juices to make gravy at this point). Remove the trussing strings before carving."

Then add in salt and pepper to taste; mix. Cover tight and let sit in the refrigerator for three days, if you are that patient. Otherwise, just set it to cure first.",
      "Cilantro Puree- In a blender puree everything but the oil (Includes washed cilantro, 1/2 cup of freshly squeezed lime juice, roasted garlic cloves, roasted onions, and course salt to taste). While the blades are moving, add the oil slow stream. Pour into a squirt bottle if you want to do so. You will, most likely, have some left over and that is a good thing.",

      "Serving Suggestions- Presentation With a squirt bottle, drizzle a line or two of the Chipotle Pepper Sauce and the Cilantro Puree on to a plate (Be creative. Write your name or the guest of honor's, etc). Place two tablespoons of the salad in the center of the plate. Top the salad with one tortilla chip. Fill the tortilla chip with one large teaspoon of salad and serve. For a delicious and nutritious alternative, use the Avocado, Black Bean and Pineapple salad as a topping on chicken or fish.",

      "Go ahead and roast more onion than you need. It is always handy to have in the fridge.",

Keep warm (you can microwave on low for 5 minutes or so or put in a small pan over low heat). Soak until soft (about 10 minutes) and puree in food processor or with stick blender. The puree should have a texture similar to thick batter or soft butter. If it's too thick, add a little water or if it's too thin, add more softened figs. (If you find you've made a bit more than the 175g you need for the brownies, you can use it to top toast or porridge or substitute for butter in biscuit or flapjack recipes.).",

      "Pour into baking pan or loaf tins. I use silicone, which doesn't need preparation, but a metal tin should be greased and either floured or lined with baking paper.",
      "Bake at 180\u00b0C/350 F/gas mark 4 for about 30 minutes or until the brownie begins to crack and does not wobble when shaken. This may take slightly less or slightly more time depending on how hot your oven is and how you like your brownies (ie longer baking time makes a cakier, less fudgy brownie). Cool and cut into squares.",
      "A note about substitutions: this recipe is amazingly robust and seems foolproof. Feel free to make prudent and appropriate substitutions as long as you keep the correct proportions of wet and dry ingredients. I often cut the sugar (by 30-50g) and just add an equal amount of flour instead. You can use prunes instead of figs, or substitute spelt flour for wheat. I once used 200g of chocolate and substituted 5 tablespoons of cocoa with an extra tablespoon of fig puree for the rest. Significant subs can be made within reason."

Lightly season beef, kneading about 1/3 of the seasoning into the meat. divide meat into 8 small patties about 4 in by 1/4 in for 1/8 lb patties, 1/2 - 3/4 in for 1/4 pound patties. Press flat onto wax paper and then freeze for approximately 30 minutes. (This prevents the patties from breaking apart when grilled)",

      "Remove bun and seperate two pieces, crown and heel.",
      "Crown: top with 5 small squirts of Heinz tomato ketchup, 5 squirts of yellow French's mustard, and then add your onions and pickle slices. (amounts will vary depending on tastes, I use just under 1 tsp onion and 3 pickle slices).",
      "Heel: top generously with Mac Sauce before topping with patty and prepared crown.",
      "\"Big Mac Style:\" If desired, this recipe can be used for larger 1/4 lb patties and/or layered \"Big Mac\" style. If this is desired, toast two buns per burger, discarding second crown on each. Top each heel with Mac sauce, burger patty, and 1 slice kraft american cheese, then stack one on top of the other. Prepare one crown as described above and then top burger with onions, pickle, toasted crown, and any additional desired ingredients (such as lettuce or tomato).",
