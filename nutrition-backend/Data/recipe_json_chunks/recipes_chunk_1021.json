Increase the mixer speed to medium and beat for about 3 minutes, until the dough forms a ball.

Put the pans on a baking sheet lined with parchment or silicone mat, cover the pans lightly with wax paper and leave the loaves at room temperature until dough fills pans.",

Use a chopstick or other thin, non-metal utensil to run around the sides of the jar to make sure there are no air bubbles left in the jar. Wipe the rims of the jars with damp paper towels to remove any relish which got on the rims or the threads. Place the lids and the bands on the jars, just tightening the bands fingertip tight.",
      "Process in a boiling water bath for 10 minutes, then remove and let sit, undisturbed, for at least 12 hours before checking seals. It is important to let them sit undisturbed for 12 hours because the sealing compound on the lids is still cooling and hardening, completing the seal. While the jars cool, you will hear a \"plink\" type sound from each jar - this is the jars completing the vacuum seal as the final air escapes the jar. After 12 hours have passed, remove the bands and check the lids - press down in the center of the lid. If you cannot push the lid down any further, the jar is sealed. If the lid \"gives\" a bit, and you can push it down, the jar did not seal. You can either put the band back on the jar, and reprocess it for another 10 minutes, or you can just put it in the fridge and use it within 3 months."

You could for example, include green beans along with the other vegetables or use different herbs. A splash of wine would be a fine addition as well.

I thank her for this.",

You'll want to serve this slow cooker pork roast recipe with a good loaf of French bread because there is lots of great sauce to sop up.

If there isn't enough clearance, remove some of the liquid. Recover and cook another 10 minutes. Meal is done when carrots and potatoes are tender. Let cool for a bit, then salt and pepper to taste.

Once baked, remove from oven (and here's my secret to getting a smooth cookie -- immediately after removing a batch from the oven, place a sheet of parchment over the top and using a slightly smaller baking sheet press, slide and swivel the smaller sheet on top until perfect. Allow cookies to cool before removing and place on paper towels.",

      "Mix sugar, water, corn syrup and tartar in a large pot on medium/high heat. Stir constantly until mixture begins to boil. Stop stirring and place candy thermometer on the edge of the pot with the temp gauge submerged into sugar syrup. This part takes a while (20 or so minutes) so keep an eye on the thermometer. Allow to heat to 300 degrees and immediately remove from heat. Stir and mix in two drops blue food coloring.",

Any unused frosting can be covered with a damp towel to prevent drying and retain freshness. Keep in mind the longer you work with a single batch the darker the color will become, so when initially mixing, keep that in mind. I usually make one batch at a time, mixing more as needed.",

      "Take a basting brush and paint a thin layer of each color onto a large parchment lined baking sheet. Allow each color to dry at room temperature. Once completely dry, crumble all colors together making sure nothing is too large. If the final product is too vivid you can add a bit of coca powder to it to give it a more natural appearance.",
      "Additional Materials Needed:",
      "Cake board, Wooden dowel rods, Battery operated tea lights, Electrical tape.",
      "Note: Remove the light element and battery from these and use electrical tape to adhere them together for a fun light to place in each window cavern. The light stays lit for roughly three days and should be removed before cutting and serving.",
      "Various colors of powder paints and ice-cold vodka (to use as a liquifying agent for the paints). I used these minimally on this project to give the house some deeper tones and shading where needed.",
      "Purple smoke bombs -- This was an adventure! I ordered them off Amazon and used roughly 12 until I got all the shots I needed. One at a time they were placed in the chimney cavity and lit. They emit smoke for only about 10 seconds or so and the chimney portion should *NOT* be served, but instead discarded.",
      "Assembly of cake:",
      "I kept all cake elements cold at all times. This was an extremely heavy cake and allowing it to fully come to room temperature would have caused it to sag and lose it's correct shape.",
      "After studying the house from the movie, I cut out cake board sheets in the necessary shapes using a craft blade. Every third layer got a sheet of the board between and 4-5 cut dowel rods placed variously through the layer to give the needed support.",
      "Once the structure was built, it received a generous crumb coat before getting a polishing final coat of buttercream. It was then allowed to chill fully over night before the next step.",
      "The following day, the large window frames were placed in their respective places using royal icing to 'glue' all cookie pieces to the house. I used a bread knife to cut small pockets in each window and door frame to allow for a light to be placed before photographing. Once these pockets were cut out, I coated all their inner walls with a bit of butter cream to prevent the cake from drying out.",
      "My secret weapon for cookie sculpting: I used a dremel tool (which I only use for baking) to perfect each edge and to cut every accent and roof strip to align with the next.",
      "Once the cake was fully assembled it received a few accents and shading done with powder paints and then the surrounding ground was coated with brown sugar and a sprinkling of the royal icing leaves. As an additional touch I used shredded wheat to add bails of hay in the front and used the remaining cookie dough to create surrounding trees.",
      "As a final step I hand painted a large tri-fold presentation board as a background landscape :D."

Sift the mixture so that the All Purpose Flour and Corn Starch are evenly distributed. The Corn Starch lowers the protein content of the mix and makes for a more tender dough. To yield 75g (1.5x) Eggs, crack two large Eggs into a bowl, beat them gently with a fork to combine the yolks and the whites, and scale out the 75g.",

    "title": "beef jerky the real mccoy! smoker required...",
    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "Lets get our selves ready first to actually make Beef Jerky with some preparation. I can not stress enough about food safety practices here. You are about to preserve meat in a way that requires a low temperature cooking and drying method and you are the preparer; You are the one that has to take these tips I share with you to heart and prepare with care or love.",
      "The meat needs a storage container that is sterile and clean, I suggest getting a food container of the likes you can find at any good restaurant supply store or Costco, Sams Club in their food pro catering Isle a nice deep square/ rectangular non reactive container with a very tight fitting lid. Various Tupper Ware types will work but make sure you have an air tight seal that won't give in a few hours or days. We need it air tight.",
      "Consider your cutting area we need a good clean butcher block or meat cutting area.",
      "Finally, gloves it may help to have some gloves to ensure cleanliness.",
      "Okay lets begin:",
      "Preparation, the CUT:",
      "Take your London Broil and identify the grain of the meat, and cut along the grain 1/4 inch to just under 3/8 of an inch thick strips. Your London Broil is usually about an inch plus thick slab of meat. So take each slice and portion that slice length wise to about the same first dimensional cut of about 1/4 inch to 3/8 inch. Now you should have long strips of meat that are about the thickness of a lady's finger. This is important in the final quality of your jerky. I have found staying very close to a precise 1/4 inch precision cut strip to no larger than 3/8 will yield a chewy, but tender result that will satisfy. Many cut into thin wide slices but bare with me and give this recipe a try and reserve your judgements for the final product.",
      "Marinading, THE CURE:",
      "We are going to layer the meat, and dress with salt and molasses. We will layer each layer of meat in a directional manner. First layer, lay strips North to South the next layer will be East to West -- But wait Read below first -- Start with your first layer of meat laid North to South covering the bottom of the container completely no spaces no overlaps.",
      "This is very critical and it does take a steady hand to prepare your cure box with just the right application of salt and molasses. So WARNING, please read this first do not just dive in -- Okay we need to lay down the salt, I like to start by swinging the Kosher salt box over the curing container that you will store your beef in a back and forth manner that is level and parallel to the meat surface in a nice controlled manner and as you tilt the salt box in your hand over the curing box the salt will begin to throw out nice and even. Important we are not trying to make a perfect layer to cover every square inch of the meat. That would be too much salt, a proper salt layer will actually have granules of salt about every 1/8 to about a 1/4inch of the meat. I know that sounds salty nonetheless but trust me, it is about right. You might want to practice over a baking sheet a little to get your technique down, I highly recommend practicing.",
      "Okay great now the Molasses, you want to have the same control here in the application by pouring the molasses with an even parallel swing but slower, its molasses and you want a small thread of molasses to begin pouring out and just as the molasses begins to clear the bottle neck pull back the tilt a bit to reduce it to that very fine thread that will flow in a thread like manner. Now swing back and forth nice and steady laying a thread of molasses at a coverage of about one line space per 1/8 inch North and South, then come back and lay a thread at 1/8 spacing East and West. Wheh -- You did it --",
      "Okay great now your next layer, remember this time alternate the direction of the meat lay this layer East to West. Fill the layer completely no spaces. Repeat layering salting, and molasses application till you have no more meat. Cover tightly and refrigerate for one week. Then you are ready for smoking in a smoker. I have marinated/Cured Jerky up to two weeks with no problems, if you are adding flavors and seasonings to this curing process then increasing curing time can be beneficial. see tips at the end of the recipe.",
      "Managing the CURE:",
      "Leave your Curing Meat undisturbed in the refrigerator for two days. straight. Once you have two days in to the curing process you can now redistribute the contents. This is important to insure we get an even cure on all of the meat try to get what is on the bottom to the top and the top to the bottom. I hope that makes sense, in other words if you wish you could take a clean spatula and just slip it in one side and just flip the contents over don't worry that all your neat layers are now in disarray that is fine. Do this every day now flipping the contents till you have a full week into curing the meat.",
      "Ready to JERK:",
      "One week later your London Broil Strips are now cured. Believe it or not your jerky is safe to eat, but I do not think it would be very appetizing. It will be soon and we are more than half way there but a little more TLC and we will have the best of the best, The Real McCoy of Jerky in your hands soon.",
      "Remove Jerky from the the confines of your fridge.",
      "Prepare your Smoker with wood natural lump charcoal, light and bring your smoker to a operating temp of 170 degrees F. try to keep it below 200 degrees F. as you maintain this heat level. Prepare your choice of wood chunks by soaking them in water, I prefer Hickory, but all nut or fruit bearing hardwoods are fair game. Clean your racks and lightly oil them but once oiled clean of with a paper towel we do not need the racks oiled heavily. I like to have the very bottom rack covered in tinfoil, if your fire and heat is coming from below. this will cause a more even heat distribution and smoke distribution.",
      "Remove the meat and I like to strip the pieces with my hands wearing a food grade glove to remove most to nearly all the marinade. Some of you will fret for the sake of flavor but the less moisture you have on the meat and in the smoker the better to insure our drying time is on cue.",
      "Prepare each rack for your smoker by laying the strips across the grate with at least a 1/8 inch of air space between strips. Fill the racks densely though because the fewer racks to rotate in the smoker the better. Place the Beef lined racks in the smoker and maintain the smoker at about 170 degrees F. add wood chunks to add smoke flavor. If your accustomed to smoking you probably have a feel for what is too much smoke or too little. You want a slow steady procession of fresh smoke gently rising with the heat. Use lots of ventilation on your smoker we want the heat to carry away the moisture so do not dampen heavily less you need to squelch a flare up that is causing your temp to sore. Best to ad fuel sparingly. Check the racks of meat about every 30 minutes. Ensure to rotate as needed over under or to just rotate the racks in a clock wise rotation to ensure even drying. Here is what I find works best for smoking and drying time; expect 4 hours at about 170ish to 200 degrees F. and then you may want to stoke the fire then you may want to stoke the fire up one last time at 4 hours to about 200 degrees and then just as that fuel dwindles, fully vent the smoker and allow to air dry to full cool for another four hours. Remove from smoker, remove from racks. You know it is right when you bend the meat you will see it give into exposing the meat fibers in the bend and possibly splinter slightly. If it splinters easily you are to dry, if it bends but will not expand and expose meat fibers to a few splintering it needs more drying time. You can air dry on baking racks inside, or in your oven to perfection. Another great gauge for perfection is your pallette go ahead and try it dry to your liking this thick cut should be chewy, but pleasant to work and not be so hard to cause severe gum and mouth abrasion. I hope that all makes sense here.",
      "Storing: Once you have your finished product it is important to store correctly. Zip locks are great and even vacuum packing is better, with each batch of jerky store with two paper towels folded into a single flat to lay on one side of the bag. The Paper towel will help with collecting moisture and keep your product in better shape. It is completely normal to see the paper towel wick a colored stain into itself. change the paper towel on longer stored jerky. Room temperature for short periods is fine say a week to ten days. Longer storage you can freeze up to many months, or refrigerate for many weeks.",
      "Tips on Flavor:",
      "Okay the natural smoke flavor of the Real McCoy already should make you feel as though all Jerky you ever, ever, ever ate from a mass producer is only fit for a Dog. I know the first time i made it just as described I nailed it not too salty, not too sweet and the London Broil was a premium cut with next to no fat or connective tissue just pure premium meat. My dogs were smelling this for hours in the smoker and when I had the first chew I got that overwhelming feeling so primal and so natural of an instinct to hunker down and cover myself from prying eyes as though I discovered a very special secret -- Like striking gold and hiding the prize from claim jumpers. So all by it's simple self this recipe screams perfection.",
      "To jazz things up here are my best tips from my years of production and trials. If you want heat then make as per the recipe above but dust the finished product with Ground Red Pepper when storing -- Making a heated up hot sauced marinade will only mellow in the smoker and the pepper sauce and spices may take on more bitters of the smoking process. Seasoning with spices is always better at storage time. Try making your favorite smice rubs and blends and see what you think.",
      "My favorite and very best of the best recipes has been the addition of julienned strips of Habenero peppers, and a product called Sweet Spicy Ginger Teriyaki, from East West Specialty Suaces -- Pouring the liquid marinades, citrus, peppers, or red pepper flakes in after your two day soak is best -- It is not necessary to add your flavor ingredients in the first production of making layers. I encourage you to let the curing of the salts and sugars of the molasses to do their job first then flavor it all up in the toss up and flip of the meat after your two day cure soak. I have found this to work the best.",
      "Enjoy and please, comment feel free to comment, our journey in the pursuit to the REAL Mc Coy is a shared experience and collaboration of us working to the same pursuit of hapiness. Cheers."
