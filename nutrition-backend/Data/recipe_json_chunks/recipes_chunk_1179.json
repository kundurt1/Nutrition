Trim excess fat from the chicken, and cut the flesh into 1 in [2.5 cm] cubes. Add to the marinade. Seal the bag and shake to coat evenly. Refrigerate for 4 hours.",

More seasoning is then added to the flour in the dredging mixture, and finally, the hot little nuggets of chicken are topped with crunchy fried curry leaves and chile peppers. While we often eat this with a hot sauce or ranch dressing, the very best accompaniment is the maple-vinegar syrup or green chutney."

In a medium size pot, add the butter and melt on medium heat, then add in the onion, garlic, roasted red pepper and red pepper flakes and cook until the onions are tender and translucent. Should take about 5 minutes. Then add in the vodka and cook another minute, followed by the tomatoes, heavy cream, parsley, salt and pepper to taste. Just simmer for another five minutes and it is done. This can be done in advance and just heated up, or made at the time you plan to serve the ravioli. It freezes well and will stay 3-4 days in the refrigerator.",
      "Shrimp Filling -- Now I like to get my shrimp steamed right at the grocery store to save time. You can also buy pre-cooked shrimp, which I don't like as much, but they certainly will work for this dish just fine.",
      "The shrimp needs to be very fine chopped which you can do by hand, or if you are me, I just add it to my food processor to get a coarse chop which is so much easier.",
      "Then add the shrimp to a large bowl with the ricotta, parmesan, eggs, garlic, parsley, nutmeg, salt and pepper and mix well.",
      "Ravioli -- Lay out the ravioli and put a small spoon of the filling on top of each ravioli in the center. With you finger or a small brush, brush the edges of the wonton with a little water and then top with the second wonton, and press the sides together and around the center filling so there is no air and the wonton and it is sealed tight. Lay them all out of a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper to dry slightly. Now they are ready for cooking. If you want, rather than making a square ravioli, you can easily put the filling on the bottom ravioli and fold over corner to corner to make a triangle. This method will work just as well and will give you about 40 plus triangle shaped ravioli. Either way works just as good as the other.",
      "Cook them right away, or you can freeze them right on the sheet and bag them up and freeze for later. NOTE: If you have any left over filling, add some onions, peppers and make a quesadilla or a grilled shrimp sandwich.",
      "Cook -- In a pot of salted medium boiling water, add the ravioli and cook 3-4 minutes. When they float, they are done. Remember the filling is already cooked, so you are just heating them through. They don't take long.",
      "Serve -- Just top the ravioli with your sauce, some fresh basil and grated parmesan cheese. And ENJOY!",

Slow cooking is the key to ensuring the tofu doesn't stick to the pan and that the water has time to evaporate so that the tofu can brown. Do NOT use oil. What you want to do is leach all the water out of your tofu in a dry pan. As the tofu cooks, frequently use a spatula to press down on the top of each piece. You should see some water squeezing out and sizzling in the pan.",

      "Uncooked leftover tofu should be placed in a container that has a lid, submerged in water, sealed, and stored in the fridge. Try to remember to change the water every day or two until you use it. Cooked tofu can be stored like any other leftovers."

Sprinkle a generous amount of salt and black pepper on the chicken, rubbing it with your fingers over all its body and into its cavity.",

Soften each lemon by placing it on a counter and rolling it back and forth as you put firm downward pressure on it with the palm of your hand. Puncture the lemons in at least 20 places each, using a sturdy round toothpick, a trussing needle, a sharp-pointed fork, or similar implement.",
      "Place both lemons in the bird's cavity. Close up the opening with toothpicks or with trussing needle and string; do not seal it completely airtight, or the bird may explode. Run kitchen string from one leg to the other, tying it at both knuckle ends. Leave the legs in their natural position without pulling them tight. If the skin is unbroken, the chicken will puff up as it cooks, and the string serves only to keep the thighs from spreading apart and splitting the skin.",
      "Put the chicken into a roasting pan, breast facing down. Arrange the carrots and potatoes around it. Place the pan in the upper third of the preheated oven. After 30 minutes, stir the carrots and potatoes and turn the chicken over to have the breast face up. When turning it, try not to puncture the skin. If kept intact, the chicken will swell like a balloon, which makes for an arresting presentation at the table later. Do not worry too much about it, however, because even if it fails to swell, the flavor will not be affected.",
      "Cook for 30 to 35 minutes more, then turn the oven up to 400\u00b0F Stir the potatoes and carrots again, ensuring they are covered with the chicken juice, and cook for 20 minutes more. (Total cooking time should be 20 to 25 minutes per pound.).",
      "Whether your bird has puffed up or not, bring it to the table whole and leave the lemons inside until it is carved and opened. The juices that run out are perfectly delicious. Be sure to spoon them over the chicken slices. The lemons will have shriveled up, but they still contain some juice; if you squeeze them, they may squirt."

Now, I can't give you an exact time, because everyone's microwave is different and everyone's potatoes will be different. But for the most part, about 10-15 minutes. I make sure to turn them over a couple of times during cooking. You want them soft when you insert a knife, but not mushy. Set to the side and let them cool enough so you can handle them.",

In a small sauce pan on medium high heat, add the olive oil, onion, garlic and cook until soft, about 2-3 minutes.

And if there is any filling left, just mix that with the left over potato and reheat for a great side with some steaks, or eggs in the morning.",

      "FOR THE PAN: Stir together butter and cocoa in small bowl until paste forms; using a pastry brush, coat all interior surfaces of standard 12-cup Bundt pan, see illustration below. (If mixture becomes too thick to brush on, microwave it for 10 to 20 seconds, or until warm and softened.) Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position; heat oven to 350\u00b0F.",
      "FOR THE CAKE: Combine cocoa, chocolate, and espresso powder (if using) in medium heatproof bowl; pour boiling water over and whisk until smooth. Cool to room temperature; then whisk in sour cream. Whisk flour, salt, and baking soda in second bowl to combine.",
      "In standing mixer fitted with flat beater, beat butter, sugar, and vanilla on medium-high speed until pale and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Reduce speed to medium and add eggs one at a time, mixing about 30 seconds after each addition and scraping down bowl with rubber spatula after first 2 additions. Reduce to medium-low speed (batter may appear separated); add about one third of flour mixture and half of chocolate/sour cream mixture and mix until just incorporated, about 20 seconds. Scrape bowl and repeat using half of remaining flour mixture and all of remaining chocolate mixture; add remaining flour mixture and beat until just incorporated, about 10 seconds. Scrape bowl and mix on medium-low until batter is thoroughly combined, about 30 seconds.",
      "Pour batter into prepared Bundt pan, being careful not to pour batter on sides of pan. Bake until wooden skewer inserted into center comes out with few crumbs attached, 45 to 50 minutes. Cool in pan 10 minutes, then invert cake onto parchment-lined wire rack; cool to room temperature, about 3 hours. Dust with confectioners' sugar, transfer to serving platter, and cut into wedges."
