      "Building this dough is a bit like building mud pies, in the sense of its compactness.",
      "The goal is to end up with a dough that can be molded rather than rolled.",
      "Take an ounce or so of the dough and form it into a rope about 1/2 inch in diameter.",
      "Using your thumb and forefinger, pinch off bits of the ropeeach about the size of a dried white beanand press each bit, rocking it, really, with your thumb, over a rough surfacea tea strainer turned upside down, the tines of a fork turned upside down, or even over a straw place mat.",

      "Place the cake on its rack over a sheet of foil or waxed paper to catch the glazes drippings.",
