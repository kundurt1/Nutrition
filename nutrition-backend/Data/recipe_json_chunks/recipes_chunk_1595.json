Place the skillet adjacent to the hot coals in a place where it will get a good amount of radiant heat so the topping cooks through evenly without burning. Use a metal shovel to pile hot coals on top of the lid (this will distribute heat from the top). Cook 45 to 50 minutes, rotating the skillet 90 degrees every 10 minutes so the cobbler cooks evenly. (Feed the fire with more wood as needed.) Change out the hot coals on top 2 or 3 times during cooking so the top stays hot throughout. When the cobbler is done, the fruit will be bubbling around the edges and the topping will be light and fluffy. Serve the cobbler straight from the pan with vanilla yogurt on the side.",

      "PRO TIP You can adjust this technique to cook white fish (like cod, haddock, halibut, etc.) by reducing the oven temperature to 35O F', basting the fish with an additional tablespoon of cooking fat, and baking for 10 to 12 minutes. You want to pull the fish out of the oven when its opaque in color, but doesn't easily flake with fork-if it fluky, its likely to be too dry when served."

Turn on the machine and SLOWLY add the oil. By slowly I mean drip by drip. Keep going until the mixture starts to look like mayonnaise. *Note: If the mayonnaise is too thick you can add a few drops of water, if it is not thick enough add a bit more oil. *Note: If you don't have a food processor you can use a bowl and whisk to mix the mixture.",
      "For the Tuna sauce:\nAdd all the ingredients (do not add the veal) in a food processor or blender turn the machine and blend until smooth and creamy*Note: Cream cheese is not in the traditional Italian Recipe, I have added it as it decreases the mayonnaise taste and helps with a creamy texture.",
      "For the concoction:\nOnce everything is ready, thinly slice the Veal and place it on the plate, cover it with the Tuna sauce. At this point you may add some whole capers for looks and extra taste. Enjoy! This dish can be prepared ahead of time and kept in the fridge."
