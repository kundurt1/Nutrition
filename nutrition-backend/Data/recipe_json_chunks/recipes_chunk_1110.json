Place 1 bay leaf and 1 cinnamon stick in the bottom of glass jar. Have a small bowl of Kosher salt nearby. Slice lemons in quarters ALMOST down to stem end, but leave intact. Place coriander and fennel seed inside lemon and also fill with salt. Place cut side down into glass jar, squeezing as many into the jar as you can. As you squeeze them, some of the lemon juice is released, but not enough to fill the jar. Just continue packing in as many lemons as you can and add additional salt between layers of lemon. Top off with freshly squeezed lemon juice. Then refrigerate for a month. I think this is Jamie Oliver's technique, but there are many out there. He has also suggested doing this with other citrus, like limes and mandarin oranges. Meyer lemons work nicely. Some techniques suggest a layer of olive oil on top, and this works well, too."

Turn off the flame and add a few grindings of pepper, the parsley, and the thyme. Serve in large bowls with Spaetzle, egg noodles, or rice."

      "Onions -- To a medium to large sauce pan, add the butter and olive oil and bring to medium heat. Add the onions and slowly begin to caramelize them - don't rush this. It will take a good thirty minutes, but it isn't hard. After 5 minutes add a pinch of salt and sugar and continue to stir now and then. After 15 minutes the moisture (water) from the onions will start to evaporate and the onions begin to caramelize. Once they get golden brown, remove, let cool and refrigerate until you are ready to use them. They can be reheated in the microwave in just a minute when you are ready to make the crostini.",
      "Garlic Oil -- In a small sauce pan on medium heat, add the oil and garlic. Cook for just a minute on medium and then reduce to medium low and simmer for about 20 minutes until the garlic is golden brown. Remove the garlic and you have wonderful garlic oil. You can always buy a bottle which is expensive, and not nearly as good.",
      "Beef -- Add the beef broth and marsala to a small bowl to a small pan and heat until warm. Add in the beef slices and cook just a minute or two until the beef is warm. You don't want to over cook it, it doesn't take long.",
      "Crostini -- Slice and grill or broil just until golden brown on each side. Remove and brush each slice with some of the garlic oil.",
      "Onions -- As the bread is toasting and the beef warming up - heat up your onions for just 1 minute in the microwave, they are all done you just want them warm.",
      "Horseradish Cream -- Don't forget to stir in the chives right before you are ready to serve.",

      "In a small bowl, mix together 3/4 tablespoons of oil, 1/2 tablespoon of butter, 4 teaspoons of garam masala, 1 1/2 teaspoons of ginger, 6 cloves of garlic, and 1 teaspoons of salt. Place hens in a large baking dish or plastic bag, loosen the skin from the breast and legs and, using your hands, spread a good part of the mixture underneath. Rub the remaining marinade inside the hen's cavity and over the skin. Loosely cover, refrigerate, and let marinate 30 min or up to 12 hours.",
      "Remove hens from marinade and left any excess drip off. Let hens sit at room temp while oven warms up, about 30 minutes. Place probe thermometer into thickest portion of the thigh making sure not to hit bone.",
      "Arrange the rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 425 degrees F.",
      "Combine remaining 3/4 tablespoon oil, 1 1/2 teaspoons of garam masala, 1/2 teaspoon of ginger, 2 cloves of garlic, and 1 1/2 teaspoons of salt (more or less to taste) in a large bowl. Place cut vegetables in it and toss until the vegetables are well coated. Season veggies with freshly ground black pepper (to taste) Place at bottom of large roasting pan which has been sprayed with nonstick spray.",
      "Place hens breast side up on top of vegetables and bake for 15 min at 425 degrees F. Reduce heat to 375 degrees F. When internal temperature hits 145 degrees F, brush yogurt on hens. Make sure to just do a thin and light coating of yogurt. You don't want it to be very thick. When internal temperature hits 160 remove from oven and loosely cover with foil. This is also the time to check the vegetables in the pan and make sure that they're done to your liking. If you'd like them softer, simply put the vegetables back in the oven while the hens are resting.",
      "Let hens rest, covered, for 15 minutes which also insures that carryover cooking will take the temp up to above 165 degrees F, for example mine ended up at 166.4 degrees F which was perfect. If you're uncomfortable with this doneness, go ahead and roast until 165 degrees (which is the temperature which poultry must be at to be done and safe) and then let hens rest covered, for 15 minute After hens have rested cut each one in half, through the breast and backbone (I just use a big sharp knife or you could use poultry shears) so that each person gets a half a hen. Divide the vegetables among the four plates and serve with a simple green salad or some rice to round out the meal."

      "To Make Blackened Spice Mix: In a food processor combine paprika, salt, garlic powder, onion powder, red pepper, black pepper, coriander, thyme leaves and oregano leaves. Pulse to combine well. Store in a clean air-tight glass jar. Keeps for about three months if it is moisture-free and cool. Note: this mixtures doesn't have to be processed, just mix together thoroughly.",
      "TIPS for preparing the mahi prior to cooking: Prepare the fish by cutting it into fillets no more than one-half-inch thick. This way the fish cooks quickly and finishes before the spice mixture is burnt and bitter. Cut thicker fillets into pieces by slicing them on a 30-degree angle for an even thickness. Remove all skin, fatty tissue and bones. Deep-chill the mahi-mahi in the freezer for about 30 to 60 minutes before cooking, but do not freeze it.",
      "To Make the Papaya-Citrus Salsa: In a medium bowl combine papaya, orange segments, lime juice, red onion (to your taste), green onions and cilantro. Season with salt and black pepper to taste. Refrigerate.",
      "To Cook the Mahi: Place a large, heavy, cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat and allow to warm until white hot, at least 15 minutes. Remember to use heavy insulated cooking gloves, long tongs or a long-handled spatula and turn on the exhaust fan to high.",
      "Pour the olive oil and melted butter into a shallow medium-size pan or plate. Pour the spice mixture into another shallow pan or plate. Remove the fish from the freezer. Dredge each piece through the olive oil/butter mixture on both sides to evenly coat, holding it above the oil for a few seconds to allow the excess to drop back into the pan. The oil coating should be very thin. Lay the mahi onto the spices and apply light pressure to adhere the spices to the fish. Turn over to completely enrobe both sides of the fish pieces with the spices. Lay the spice-coated fish onto a cookie sheet while repeating the coating process with the remaining fish.",
      "Carefully lay the spiced-coated mahi into the hot skillet without overlapping or crowding. Cook the fish until the spice mixture browns, about two minutes. Turn over and finish cooking, about two to three additional minutes, depending on the thickness of the fish. Remove to hot serving plates with a spatula, placing two slightly overlapping the pieces on the center of each plate. Depending on how large your cast iron pan, you may need to repeat this process.",
      "Divide the salsa in a band across the layered mahi or serve on the side. Garnish with the cilantro sprigs and serve immediately."

We can guess that the type of cheese used was one of several (or similar): blanco, fresco, requeson, etc. Mild American cheese such as California Monterey Jack will work fine as will a medium sharp white cheddar. I always use a combination of different cheeses-Jack, fresco, etc. For the sauce I used a recipe from another site, with a few adjustments-most especially using dried chilies for chili powder, etc. Just remember when choosing dried chilies, to choose ones that are mild to medium in the hotness category.",
