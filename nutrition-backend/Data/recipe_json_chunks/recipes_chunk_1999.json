      "Add the salt, pepper, garlic, and herbs, stir well to mix, and set aside to cool.",
      "Lift the skin of the neck of one of the chickens, and cut on each side of the wishbone.",
      "With your thumb and index finger, pry the wishbone out (see the first step of illustrated chicken preparation).",
      "Insert your index finger between the skin and the flesh at the neck opening of the chicken, and gently push your hand inside to loosen the skin, not only around the breast but also around the thighs.",
      "Do not loosen the skin of the back, just the top surface and the sides.",
      "Repeat with the second chicken.",
      "Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.",
      "To stuff the chickens:",
      "Stand a chicken on its tail in a 4-cup glass measuring cup or a bowl of similar size to secure it in the right position.",
      "Using half the mushroom filling per chicken, stuff the chickens by inserting the filling between the skin and the flesh, pushing it evenly with your fingers throughout the chicken, including the sides of the legs.",
      "To truss the chickens:",
      "Cut a length of kitchen twine about 40 inches long for each chicken.",
      "Be sure to use fairly thick cotton kitchen twine, so it doesnt cut your fingers or the meat of the chicken.",
      "With one chicken positioned, breast side up, with its neck toward you on the table, center the string under the tail, and bring it around the tips of the drumsticks in a loop.",
      "Then cross both ends of the string above the chicken, and bring them under the tips of the drumsticks to create a figure Pull on both ends of the string, which will tighten and close up the tail opening.",
      "Be sure that the legs are pushed back snugly against the chicken.",
      "Now bring the string around the sides of the chicken until they join at the neck or next to the wing, and tighten the string behind the stump of the neck or one wing.",

      "Reduce the oven temperature to 150 degrees.",

      "For the Vinaigrette: Mix together the vinegar, garlic, mustard, cumin, salt and pepper to taste, bean liquid and extra virgin olive oil.",
      "Stir the vinaigrette into the beans.",
      "For Assembly: If you're serving the salad hot, add in the red and green bell peppers and cilantro.",

      "Shortly before serving, stir in the bell peppers and cilantro.",
