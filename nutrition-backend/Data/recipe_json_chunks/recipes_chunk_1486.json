Keep cooking, undisturbed, until the mixture reaches 240\u00b0F on a candy thermometer. You may notice the mixture beginning to crystallize a little around the edges, but that is a good thing. When the mixture reaches 240\u00b0, shut off the heat and let it stand until it cools to 210\u00b0. Transfer to bowl with gelatin (mixture may crystallize). Fit the bowl with the whisk attachment and whip on medium-high speed until the mixture has nearly doubled in volume and cooled. While mixing, add vanilla extract, orange flower water, and almond extract.",
      "Once mixture has doubled and cooled, shut off the mixer. If you're just making white marshmallows, use a lightly greased rubber spatula to transfer the mixture to the cookie sheet, spreading it out to about 1/4\" thickness. Alternatively, if you'd like to make different color marshmallows, divide the mixture into as many bowls as you'd like colors. Add a few drops of food coloring to each and stir with a spatula until the color has incorporated. Spread each portion across a separate patch of the cookie sheet.",
      "Set the tray of marshmallows in a dry, well ventilated location where you feel safe leaving them, uncovered, for twenty four hours.",
      "After the marshmallows have dried for 24 hours, peel the big sheet of marshmallows up from the cookie sheet. You will notice the bottom of the marshmallow sheet is slightly damp, while the top is crusty. Transfer to a cutting board, placing it crusty side down, and use a tiny cookie cutter to stamp the marshmallows into shapes, or use a knife to cut them into tiny squares or diamonds. Transfer the marshmallow cut outs to a parchment lined cookie sheet, damp side up. Allow them to dry for another 24 hours, or until they have become crunchy. The exact length of time it takes depends on kitchen humidity. Store the marshmallows in an airtight container, at room temperature for up to 2 weeks. Alternately, freeze or refrigerate indefinitely.",
      ": In a medium pot, combine the sliced corn cobs and water. Bring the water to a boil, then reduce heat to medium and simmer gently until the water has reduced by half; about thirty minutes. Use a pair of tongs to fish out the corn cob pieces; discard. Add the vanilla bean and seed scrapings, sugar, and salt. Stir constantly until the sugar dissolves. Simmer for twenty minutes, or until the mixture has taken on a thick, syrupy consistency. Cool. Store indefinitely in the fridge along with the vanilla bean."

Pipe a dab (about 1/4 teaspoon) of ganache in the center of each marshmallow. Immediately pipe the remainder of the marshmallow batter into tins, covering the ganache and filling the wells to the tops. Sift coating evenly over top. Let set for at least 4 hours.

Work quickly, and be careful not to overwork the dough; if it resists or shrinks back as you shape it, let it rest briefly before proceeding. (If you prefer, you can roll out the dough with a rolling pin. Lightly flour the work surface and the rolling pin; sprinkle the rolling pin with more flour as necessary to prevent sticking.)",

As the crust cooks, if you see any parts that remain undercooked, especially any thicker parts, simply press them against the pan so they cook a bit more; once the dough has set, you can move the crust around as necessary for more even cooking. Flip the crust over and cook until the second side is completely dry, about 1 minute longer.",

      "The first time you use the dehydrated grains (or if they have been stored for an extended period of time), they need to be hydrated to become active. In a small pan, heat 2 cups of the water over medium-high heat to just boiling. Place 1/4 cup of the raw sugar in a 1-quart glass jar and cover with the hot water. Stir to thoroughly dissolve the sugar. Add enough room-temperature water to bring the level of the liquid to the shoulder of the jar. Cool the mixture to room temperature and then add the grains. Cover the opening with fine-weave cheesecloth or a kitchen towel and secure with a rubber band. Allow the mixture to sit at room temperature for 3 to 4 days until the grains are plump. You are taking a risk if you let them sit any longer than 5 days, as the grains may start to lose their potency from lack of food (sugar).",
      "In a small pan, heat 2 more cups of the water over medium-high heat to just boiling. Divide the remaining 1/2 cup sugar between two 1-quart glass jars and cover evenly with the hot water. Stir to thoroughly dissolve the sugar. Add enough room-temperature water to bring the level of the liquid to the shoulder of the jar.",
      "Cool the mixture to room temperature, and then add equal amounts of the loose plump grains in each jar. Cover the jar opening with fine-weave cheesecloth or a kitchen towel and secure with a rubber band.",
      "Allow the mixture to sit at room temperature for 24 to 48 hours, depending on the level of sweetness you want. Shorter time will result in a sweeter kefir; longer will be less so. Do not exceed 72 hours.",
      "About 12 hours before you are ready to strain the kefir, start a new batch of sugar water to prepare for the next batch of kefir. This sugar water will need to be ready to receive the grains once you have strained the kefir.",
      "Once it has reached the desired level of sweetness, use a dedicated fine-mesh nylon strainer to strain off the liquid into a spouted glass measuring vessel. Using a funnel, fill two 1-liter swing-top bottles. Place the captured grains in the new batch of sugar water to store.",
      "Secure the caps on the bottles and leave at room temperature until ready to consume. In a day or so, tiny bubbles of carbonation will appear. This will increase as time passes and if you add fruit to the kefir. Water kefir does not need to be refrigerated unless you want it chilled. It's best to consume within 10 days after opening a bottle.",
      "Unused grains can be fed and stored, covered, in sugar water (1/4 cup sugar to 1 quart water), and refrigerated for up to 2 weeks. Bring the mixture to room temperature before using the grains for a new batch of kefir. For longer periods of storage, the grains should be laid out to dehydrate, stored in an airtight container, and refrigerated. This process returns the grains to their original state.",
      "Note: Kefir grains require minerals to thrive. Hard, mineral-rich water such as well water or spring water is best. Do not use filtered water because too many of the minerals will have been removed. If using tap water, first bring it to a boil to remove any possible chlorine, and then cool it to room temperature before using. Supplementing with Trace Mineral Drops (1/8 teaspoon per quart of water) is a good security measure. These can be purchased from the same source as your grains."

(This is the order I filled mine, but I've noticed that the proper order depends on the machine. Follow your manufacturer's instructions) Set the bread machine to a knead-only setting. On this model, I used the kneading setting for pizza. If there's a long final rise on your machine, consider taking the dough out sooner (unless you're planning on baking right away). When the kneading is done, drizzle a small amount of olive oil into a zip-top bag and transfer the dough to the bag. Squeeze out the air and refrigerate the dough overnight.",
      "Meanwhile, melt 1 tablespoon of butter in a small frying pan. Peel, core, and slice the apples thinly, and drop them into the frying pan. Cook, stirring as needed, until the apple is fork-tender. Transfer the apple to a storage container and refrigerate until needed. You can cook the apples the next day, but you want them to be fully chilled before you use them.",

Spray a square Pyrex baking pan with baking spray (if you want a little extra insurance against sticking - or you can use a metal pan if you like, but I prefer the Pyrex for this.",
      "Flour your work surface and turn out the dough. Knead it briefly, then roll it out to a rectangle about 10 x 15 inches. With one of the long sides facing you, spread the softened butter on the dough starting at the edge closest to you and to within an inch or two of the far edge. It's fine if there are gaps and blobs of butter, as long as it's somewhat evenly distributed from side to side. Top the butter with the sugar, again leaving an inch or two at the far end uncovered. Do the same with the cinnamon. Again, it's fine if it's not perfectly even.",
      "Remove the apples from the refrigerator and place a row of them across the dough on the edge closest to you. Leave a gap of about two inches and place another row of apples. (this leaves space for making the first turn of the spiral. Depending on how thin your slices are, and how you arrange your apples, this might use them all up. If not, place another row right above the second row, and continue until all the apples are used up.",
      "Starting at the edge closest to you, begin rolling the dough up, jelly-roll style, until you reach the far end. Seal the seam. Arrange the log you've created so it's somewhat evenly thick from one end to the other. Slice the log into thirds, then slice each of those into thirds again, so you have 9 pieces.",
      "Place the pieces, spiral sides up, in the prepared pan. Press down on the rolls so they're all the same height. You don't want to mash them to death, just gently press down. It's fine if they're touching each other. Cover the pan with plastic wrap and set aside until doubled. Depending on how much your dough has warmed up, it might take as much as an hour to rise. It's better to let it rise fully than to bake it before it has time to get fluffy, so if it needs more time, be patient. About 20-30 minutes before the rolls have risen fully (or sooner, if you prefer) preheat the oven to 325 degrees.",
      "When the rolls have doubled in size and feel puffy when you touch them, remove the plastic wrap and bake them at 325 degrees until the are cooked through and nicely browned, about 45 minutes. There's likely to be some sugary goo on the bottom of the pan, so turn the rolls out and let them rest upside down first, before you flip them over to finish cooling."

Arrange balls in baking pan, cover loosely with plastic, and allow to rise until each portion of dough feels puffy and light for its size, able to retain a shallow impression when gently pressed, with a distinctly \"cushy\" feel from the air cells trapped inside, about 1 1/2 hours total.

Once the whites are thoroughly foamy, increase the speed to medium and gradually add about half of the remaining sugar. Increase the speed to medium-high as the whites become shiny and opaque, and gradually add all but the last tablespoon or so of the remaining sugar. Rub the vanilla-bean scrapings into the remaining sugar. Whip whites until glossy and dense but still supple-medium-firm peaks. In the very last stage of beating the whites, add the vanilla sugar and whip just until well incorporated.",

(Because angel food cakes get all of their volume and texture from beaten egg whites, it's important to treat the whites gently as you incorporate the dry ingredients. Don't worry if veins of dry ingredients or zest remain visible after the first few additions. Wait until the final addition of dry to fold everything in thoroughly. This will prevent a lot of lost volume.)",

If the tube pan has \"feet,\" immediately invert the pan onto its feet and allow to cool completely. If the pan does not have feet, invert it over a heavy bottle (sliding the hollow center of the tube pan over the neck of the bottle), and allow the cake to cool completely.",

      "Make the dough: Pour the warm water into a medium bowl. The temperature range for the \"warm\" water is where the dry yeast likes to wake up from its nap in those little envelopes in the back of your cupboard. (When you run the water from the tap, it's about where water starts to feel just hot to the touch; if it is so hot that you have to pull your hand away, you've gone much too far.) Whisk in the yeast and set aside to dissolve in the water. After 10 minutes, you should see a few small bubbles on the surface. (If there is nothing at all, start again with fresher yeast.) Stir in the all-purpose flour, cover with plastic wrap, and set aside in a warm place.",
      "Meanwhile, in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat together the butter and sugar on medium speed until fluffy and light, 8 to 10 minutes. Do not skimp on or rush this time. Scrape down the sides of the bowl as you mix. With the mixer on low speed, add the eggs, one by one, taking care that each one is thoroughly integrated before adding the next. When the mix is smooth, add the vanilla and salt. Scrape down the sides of the bowl. Add the bread flour and mix on low speed until fully incorporated. Add the yeast mixture and mix again until thoroughly incorporated. Transfer the dough to a greased bowl, cover with plastic, and allow to rise in a warm place until the dough has doubled in volume, about 1 hour 30 minutes.",
      "Roll and cut the doughnuts: Lightly flour a cool surface and sprinkle the dough with an even layer of flour. Use a rolling pin to roll the dough out to about a 1-inch thickness. Cut rounds of dough with a 2-inch round cookie cutter. You cannot reroll scraps (though you can fry them as is and devour them in the kitchen), so cut your doughnut rounds very close together to maximize yield. Put the doughnuts, leaving room between them for them to grow, on a floured baking sheet to rest in a warm place for 20 to 30 minutes. If you wait longer than that to fry them and they become fairly puffed up, cover them with plastic and refrigerate until you are ready. Leaving them in a warm place for too long can result in overproofing and yield an overly yeasty (and somewhat sour) doughnut.",
      "Fry the doughnuts: In a medium, deep, heavy-bottomed pot (or deepfryer), heat the canola oil to 350\u00b0F. Monitor the temperature of the oil with a thermometer.",
      "Drop a doughnut scrap in the oil to make sure it is hot. It should bubble immediately. Cook until golden brown on both sides, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove it from the oil with a slotted spoon and set on a kitchen towel to drain. Fry the remaining doughnuts in batches.",
      "Fill the doughnuts: Fill a pastry bag fitted with a small plain tip (or a zippertop plastic bag with a corner snipped off) with the jam. Poke a hole into the side of each doughnut with the tip (or with a small spoon) and squirt some jam into the center. While still warm, roll in sugar. Serve immediately with the dipping sauce.",
      "For the dipping sauce: Infuse the milk. In a saucepan, combine the vanilla bean and milk with the salt. Bring to a boil over medium heat and then reduce the heat so that the milk simmers. Cook for 2 minutes and then set the pan aside to steep for 10 minutes.",
      "Start the sauce: In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, combine the egg yolks and sugar. Whip on medium speed until the eggs are pale yellow, about 5 minutes. Strain the milk, pressing down to extract the maximum from the vanilla bean.",

Return the egg yolk mixture to the saucepan along with the remaining milk and cook over medium heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, until the sauce coats the back of the spoon, 5 to 8 minutes.

Add about two-thirds of the chopped chocolate and allow to sit for 5 to 10 minutes, stirring only occasionally with a heatproof spatula (you want to make sure the chocolate on the bottom of the bowl doesn't get too hot, but if you stir the whole time, the heat will disperse too much and the chocolate won't melt all the way).",
      "Once all the pieces have melted completely, insert the tempering thermometer (recommended but optional; if you don't have one, try using the Cheater's Chocolate Coating, explained next) and check the temperature; for dark chocolate you want it to be around 108\u00b0F; milk, 106\u00b0F; white, 104\u00b0F. If you go a little bit under these temperatures, that's fine; too much under, though, and you won't melt all the \"bad\" crystals in the cocoa butter (the ones that keep your chocolate from getting glossy). No thermometer? No problem. Dab a bit of the chocolate on your lip instead. At the melted stage, the chocolate should feel distinctly warm, not just lukewarm.",
      "Once your chocolate has reached the desired temperature, CAREFULLY lift the bowl off the pot, and place it on top of a folded dish towel. You'll want to wipe the moisture off the bottom and side of the bowl; this will lessen the risk of accidentally getting some in the chocolate, which is not okay. (Water will cause the chocolate to \"seize\", or get lumpy and unworkable, and you'll have to make it into chocolate sauce instead.)",
      "Now add some of the reserved chocolate, about 1/4 cup at a time, stirring constantly until the addition has been incorporated completely and there are no more lumps. You'll want to stir like your life depends on it here, both to agitate the chocolate (the more it is agitated, the nice-n-shinier it'll be) and to reduce its temperature. You want to get it down to about 90\u00b0F for dark, 88\u00b0F for milk, 86\u00b0F for white. (Starting to notice a pattern here? More cocoa solids require working at higher heat.) If you're doing the lip test, you'll want it to feel distinctly cool. Agitating not only encourages the right crystals to form, it also helps cool the chocolate more rapidly. This will take you about 15 minutes.",
      "Once the chocolate is close to the desired temperature (a degree or two above is fine), test it: Dip a teaspoon in the chocolate, then stick the dipped spoon on a piece of wax paper and allow it to set up for a few minutes. (If your kitchen is warm, you can put it in the fridge for a bit - 2 minutes for dark, more like 5 for milk and white.) If the test sets up completely; a little glossy, not tacky to the touch, not streaky or blotchy, then huzzah and kudos to you! You just tempered chocolate.",
      "If tempering seems like too much fuss to you, try this. You'll need 19 ounces of chopped milk or dark chocolate, and 1/2 cup (100g) neutral-flavored vegetable oil, like sunflower or safflower.",
      "Melt the chocolate: Place it in a medium-size microwave-safe bowl and heat it in the microwave on high for 20 seconds. Stir the chocolate with a whisk or heatproof spatula, then continue heating it on high in 20-second increments, stirring after each increment, until the chocolate is completely melted.",
      "Alternatively, fill a small (2-quart) saucepan about one-third full with hot water, and place it over medium-low heat. When the water simmers, place the chocolate in a slightly larger metal bowl and set it over the simmering water (make sure the bowl is large enough for you to easily grasp it for removal). Allow the chocolate to melt, stirring it occasionally, until it's completely liquid and there are no lumps left, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove it from the heat.",
      "Slowly stir the oil into the melted chocolate until it is completely incorporated.",
      "Keep the coating warm by setting the bowl over a saucepan of simmering water until you're almost ready to use it; then remove it from the heat and allow it to cool until it has the consistency of warm fudge sauce, 15 to 20 minutes.",
      "Store the chocolate coating in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 1 month. Reheat it as many times as you need to. To reheat, cut the cooled coating into chunks and microwave on high for 20 second intervals, then 5 to 10 second intervals, stirring after each, until it's melted. Or, place the block on top of a double boiler set over low heat and stir occasionally until melted.",
      "You'll need two large (13\" x 18\") rimmed baking sheets, lined with parchment paper, large and small metal offset spatulas, a ruler, cutting board and wire cooling rack.",
      "Place a sheet of parchment on top of the candy slab. Grasp the parchment and baking sheet on both ends, holding everything together like a giant sandwich. Keeping the parchment as taut as possible, turn \"the sandwich\" over with one swift, smooth motion onto the cutting board. Remove the baking sheet and peel off any lining. The slab should be upside down; you'll first be coating what will end up as the bottom of the bars.",
      "Pour about 3/4 cup of the prepared chocolate on top of the slab, and use the large offset spatula to spread it over the surface in an even layer, adding more if needed to cover the entire surface (it's okay if some drips down the sides; you'll be trimming them anyhow). Allow the chocolate to set until it is no longer wet but it is still soft, about 5 minutes. Meanwhile, set aside the bowl of chocolate; you'll retemper/reheat it soon.",
      "While the chocolate layer is still slightly soft, flip the slab of candy so it is chocolate side down, and trim the edges with a sharp chef's knife so that they're more or less straight (if the slab contains sticky layers, oil the knife first). Using the ruler and the knife, measure and score 1 by 4-inch bars or 1- by 1-inch bite-size pieces; then press down with a firm hand to cut along the score lines. Set the cut bars, chocolate side up, on a lined baking sheet, and let the chocolate set completely, about 15 minutes.",
      "Meanwhile, retemper the chocolate, or warm the chocolate coating over a pan of simmering water until it's body temperature (test it on your lip).",
      "Set the wire cooling rack over the second lined baking sheet, and arrange the bars, chocolate side down on the rack, about 1/2 inch apart. Ladle the warmed chocolate over each bar, pouring long-ways while making small side-to-side motions; coat as much of each bar as possible (if there are a few small gaps that remain uncoated, you can fix them later). Tap the tray against the counter to even out the chocolate.",
      "Immediately run a small offset spatula or butter knife underneath each bar to loosen it from the rack. Don't be afraid to scrape along the wires of the rack; you can't do any damage to it, and you want to keep as much chocolate on the bars as possible. Use the spatula to transfer the loosened bars to the first lined baking sheet.",
      "Scrape off any excess chocolate on the rack into the pool of chocolate in the baking sheet. Gently pour the chocolate on the baking sheet back into the bowl, and stir it a little to even out the consistency. Using the small offset spatula, cover with chocolate any holes that may be left in the coated bars. Allow the bars to set completely, about 20 minutes.",
      "Coated candy bars will keep, stores in an airtight container, for 3 to 8 weeks (bars with ganache and/or a cookie base will last 3 to 4 weeks; nougat and caramel, 6 to 8)."

The edges will probably be thicker, so judge the thickness a little farther from the edge. Try to keep the dough rectangular, but don't stress about it being uneven.",
      "While the crackers will rise during baking, you want to keep them from becoming little puffy hollow pillows. To keep them from puffing, use a dough docker or a fork to poke holes and/or dimple the dough. I have a rolling pin that I use for this sort of thing, but a fork works fine. If some of the crackers puff, it's not a big deal.",

      "Move the crackers to your parchment-lined sheet. You don't need to break them apart completely; it's fine if groups of them remain stuck together, and they're easier to handle in sections rather than individually. Once they're baked, they'll break apart cleanly at the score marks.",
      "Bake for 25-45 minutes, until the crackers are very lightly browned and dried all the way through.",

You can move them around to get them to bake evenly, or take out the browned ones as they're done baking. The fully-baked crackers will snap apart crisply, while the yet-unfinished ones will bend rather than snap. Also, the fully-cooked ones will feel lighter, since all the water will have cooked out.",
      "The more often you open the oven to rearrange the crackers, the longer the baking will take, but once they start browning, they can overbrown quickly. So watch them carefully.",

Whisk for 1 minute, then move the mixture to the food processor and process for 1 minute. Allow the mixture to cool for 5 minutes, then add the egg yolks one at a time, processing for 5 seconds between each addition. Return the mixture to saucepan and stir constantly until the mixture reaches 160\u00b0F. Remove from heat and allow the mixture to cool to just below room temperature over an ice bath, stirring occasionally (if this is too warm, the mixture will not set up properly). Fold in chilled heavy cream that has been whisked to soft peaks, taking care not to deflate the cream. Pour the mousse into the pie shell and place in the fridge to set for at least 6 hours (overnight is best). Serve chilled with whipped cream if desired."

Sweat until tender over low-medium heat. The pot should be in between tall and wide, so that the liquid that comes out of the onions as they cook does not burn off right away. When you take off the lid, the onions should be swimming in their own juices. Add the carrots and cook over medium heat, stirring often, until the liquid reduces and caramelizes. The point here is that you want to release the juices containing sugars from the vegetables, and then burn off the liquid and caramelize those sugars. This will give the vegetables a deep, rich flavor. Don't just brown the vegetables and then throw in some water to standardize the color, which will give you something that looks similar, but is nowhere near as tasty. When the vegetables are mahogany brown and sweet, add them to the stockpot.",

Doing it this way will mix the murk on the bottom with the clear elixir on top that you worked so hard to create. Strain the stock through a fine mesh sieve. Cool in a very col ice bath, letting the fat rise to the surface and harden. If you're not using it immediately, then then fat cap will protect the stock.

You can pull most of it off with your fingers; use a paring knife to cut the skin away from the wings and ends of the drumsticks.

Remove the chicken from the marinade, setting aside any remaining marinade. Hold the chicken upright, with the opening of the body cavity at the bottom, and position the bird on the can or chicken roaster so that it fits snugly into the cavity. If you are using a can, pull the legs forward to form a sort of tripod, so the bird stands upright. The rear \"leg\" of the tripod is the can. You don't need to do this if you are using a chicken roaster. Tuck the tips of the wings behind the chicken's back. Alternatively, truss the bird with butcher's string or a bamboo skewer.",

Spoon any remaining marinade over the chicken, then cover the grill. Grill the chicken until it is handsomely browned and cooked through, about 1 hour for a skinless bird, about 1 1/4 hours if the bird is skin-on. Use an instant-read meat thermometer to test for doneness, inserting it into the thickest part of a thigh but not so that it touches a bone. The internal temperature should be about 170\u00b0F. If the top of the bird starts to brown too much, loosely cover it with a small piece of aluminum foil.",

      "Before you do anything at all, have ready a large colander suspended over a pan and in the sink. Soften half the onion with half the olive oil in a large pan that will accommodate the mussels. Turn up the heat, pour in the wine, add the mussels, shake the pan about a bit, and put on the lid, still over a high heat. After about 2 minutes, remove the lid and shake and toss the mussels so that those initially underneath now appear on top; you will notice, from this action, that the mussels underneath have already started to open. Replace the lid, cook for a further 2 to 3 minutes and then repeat the shaking and tossing motion. Depending upon strength of heat, you may have to do this once more, but if it looks as if most of the mussels are now open, tip the whole panful into the colander in the sink. Leave to drain for at least 5 minutes, giving the colander an occasional shake to ensure that all the remaining juices drip through.",
      "Once the mussels are cool enough to handle, extract all the meat from their shells and collect it in a bowl. Cover and set aside. Take the mussel-cooking liquor that has now collected beneath the colander and strain it through a very fine sieve into the stock. Pour this mixture into a pan and place over very low heat to keep hot, but not to boil. (You may not necessarily use all of this; any leftover can, of course, be frozen for a subsequent occasion.)",
      "In an entirely new solid-bottom pot, heat the remaining olive oil. Soften the remaining onion in this and then add the tomatoes. Briskly cook together for a few minutes until reduced to a sloppy paste. Add the rice and stir around in the tomato mess until thoroughly coated with it. Introduce the first ladle of the hot stock and vigorously stir in. Only consider adding a second ladle once this has been fully absorbed. And so on, until the rice is nearly cooked; taste a grain: it should still possess \"bite.\"",
      "Now add the shelled mussels and stir in, together with what should, hopefully, be the final ladleful of stock. Sprinkle in the garlic, parsley, and chilli flakes and carefully fold everything together, while also making sure that you do not pulverize the naked mussels, which are now fragile, having been robbed of their protective shells. Taste for salt&mash;probably not necessary-and finally stir in the spoonful of softened butter. Cover the pot with a lid and leave to settle for 5 minutes. Serve from the pot at a table, directly onto hot plates."

      "In a sieve, thoroughly rinse the sushi rice under cold running water until the water runs clear. Place the rinsed rice in a small saucepan with the water and a generous pinch of salt. Bring the rice to a boil, uncovered, over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat to medium and simmer until most of the water has been absorbed by the rice, about 5 minutes. Cover the pan tightly, reduce the heat to low, and continue cooking for about 7 minutes longer. Remove from the heat and let stand, covered, for 15 minutes. The rice should be tender and all of the water absorbed. (Even very slightly overcooked rice is not a problem in this recipe, as that may help the rice cakes keep their shape.) Scoop the rice onto a small baking sheet lined with plastic wrap. Form the rice into a rough square 3/4 to 1 inch thick. Cover tightly and refrigerate overnight until cold and set. When the rice has set, cut 8 equal-size triangles of rice cake and set aside until ready to fry and serve.",

Add the steaks to the pan and sear until nicely browned on both sides, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer the pan to the oven and bake until steaks are medium-rare, 7 to 10 minutes. Transfer the steaks to a cutting board and let rest for 5 minutes.",

Carefully add the rice cakes to the hot oil. Cook until golden brown and toasty on one side, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip the rice cakes and continue cooking until golden brown on the other side, another 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer the rice cakes to a plate and cover to keep warm. Set aside, reserving the pan.",
      "Wipe out the pan you used to fry the rice cakes, if necessary, and add the olive oil and pea shoots. Stir in the chili-garlic sauce, the sweet soy glaze, and season with sea salt and ground pepper. Saute the pea shoots until just barely wilted.",
      "Carve each of the steaks into 5 slices. Place 2 toasted rice cakes in the center of each plate, spoon the sauteed pea shoots over one side of the toasted rice cakes, and arrange the sliced beef around. Spoon the sweet soy glaze over and around the steak and serve at once."

      "Place the water and star anise in a saucepan over high heat, or in a microwave-safe container in the microwave oven, and bring to the boil. Remove from the heat, cover and infuse for 1 hour.",
      "Center a rack in the oven and preheat the oven to 300 degrees F. Very lightly spray an 8 x 4 x 2 1/2 inch loaf pan with vegetable oil spray and then line the pan with parchment paper; set aside until needed. Prepare an insulating layer for the cake by stacking two baking sheets, one on top of the other, or use an insulated (air-cushioned) baking sheet.",
      "Stir the honey and melted butter together in a medium bowl, then strain the star anise-infused water into the bowl (discard the star anise). Stir to blend and then set the bowl aside.",
      "Sift the all-purpose flour, rye flour, baking powder and spices together into a large bowl. In another bowl, stir together the nuts, dried fruits and zests. Add 1 tablespoon of the dry ingredients to the nuts and fruits and toss to coat the ingredients lightly with the flour.",
      "Pour the honey mixture into the bowl with the flour and spices and stir gently with a wooden spoon or large rubber spatula. Treat this batter as you would a quick bread or muffin mixture-stir it only until the dry ingredients are moistened. Add the nuts and fruits and lightly stir them into the batter-thoroughness isn't important here. (The batter will be very thick, more like a quick bread dough than a cake batter.)",
      "Spoon the batter into the pan and bake for 65 to 75 minutes, or until a thin knife inserted deeply into the cake comes out clean. Transfer the cake to a cooling rack and unmold it, then invert it to cool to room temperature right side up. When the cake is absolutely cool-this can take a couple of hours-wrap it in a double thickness of plastic wrap and allow it to \"ripen\" for a day before slicing and serving in very thin slices. (Of course, you can eat it now, if you want to.)",
      "Wrapped airtight, the cake will keep for about 4 days at room temperature or for up to 2 months in the freezer."

Gradually add the sugar and vanilla and continue to beat, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed, until the mixture is smooth and creamy, but not airy. Reduce the mixer speed to low and add the flour mixture, mixing only until the ingredients are just mixed-no more. Alternatively, you can remove the bowl from the mixer and stir the flour into the dough with a rubber spatula. The point is to mix the dough as gently and as little as possible-this light touch is what will give the cookies their characteristic crumbly texture. As soon as the last of the flour is no longer visible, divide the dough in half, shape each half into a ball, wrap the balls in plastic wrap and chill for 30 minutes.",
      "Working on a smooth surface, form each piece of dough into a log that's about 1 1/2 inches thick and 7 1/2 inches long. (Aim to get the thickness right and the length will be fine.) To get a solid log, one without the commonly found hole in the center, use the heel of your hand to gently flatten the dough, then flatten the dough lightly each time you fold it over on itself to make the log. Assured that the log is solid, you can roll it gently under your palms to smooth it out. Wrap the logs in plastic and chill for 1 to 2 hours. (The dough can be made to this point, wrapped airtight, and stored in the freezer for up to 2 months.)",

Roll the logs in the sugar, pressing the sugar gently to get it to stick, if necessary, then, using a sharp slender knife, slice each log into cookies 1/2-inch thick. Arrange the cookies on the baking sheets, leaving about an inch of space between each cookie, and bake for 15 to 18 minutes, rotating the pans front to back and top to bottom at the midway mark, until the cookies are just firm to the touch.

Whisk in about one-third of the milk to make a smooth paste, then whisk in the rest of the milk. Cook the mixture over medium heat, stirring frequently, until thickened to the consistency of thin yogurt, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and whisk in the egg yolks and butter. Return to the heat and cook until the mixture just begins to boil and a few bubbles pop on the surface. Transfer to a bowl that holds at least 4 quarts (4 liters).

Using a sharp knife, cut the strips of zest lengthwise into pieces about as narrow as a wooden match.",
