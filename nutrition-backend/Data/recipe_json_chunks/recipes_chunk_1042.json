To prevent the flesh from turning brown, sprinkle with lemon juice. In Australia, there are now varieties of avocado which don't brown after being cut, but I do wonder (I don't know) if they have been genetically modified."

Place the third layer on top of the second. Frost the top with all of the Butter Cream that was not thinned. This is a thick layer of frosting so pile it on. Try to get the top as smooth as you can.

      "NOTE #1: If using canned asparagus, drain & reserve liquid. When the roux is ready for addition of the broth, combine the reserved asparagus liquid w/broth to a total volume of 2 cups & add to roux, using additional broth as needed to get desired consistency. This method will concentrate the asparagus flavor. If using it + the broth, you will not need added salt.",
      "Note #2: Without the fresh asparagus tips, you will not have the visual & textural elements of using fresh asparagus, but the sauce will be rich & flavorful. I favor adding baby shrimp or crisp bacon pieces to get visual & textural elements.",

Add the crushed Walnuts to the mixture and saute for about 5-7 minutes or until the celery and onion are soft.

But, if you would like to add a punch to the flavor, use beef or chicken broth -- maybe even a portion of a sausage gravy packet with the water to add a peppery-sausage flavor. Its up to you! Your choice should be based on the type of stuffing you have made as well as what type of meat you will be serving.",

Remove from heat, stir in Parmigiano-Reggiano, and season with salt, pepper and nutmeg. Whisk in egg yolks one at a time. Reserve up to 2 days, covered.",

      "Beating and Folding: Put egg whites into a very clean bowl of standing mixer fitted with whisk. Turn on low to break up the whites. Add a pinch of salt and a small pinch of cream of tartar. Gradually increase speed to high. Keep a sharp eye on the whites, it only takes about 4 minutes to get to stiff peaks - that's when they stick straight out when you hold the whisk or beater sideways, instead of softly flopping over. Take the bowl off the standing mixer and finish the souffle by hand (or 6-8 minutes by hand).",
      "Take out one-fourth of the beaten whites and stir into 1 cups of the cooled (but not cold) Mornay Sauce - this lightens up the Mornay and makes it easier to fold in the whites.",
      "Pour the Mornay Sauce down the side of the bowl containing the remaining whites and sprinkle the 3/4 cup finely grated cheese over the top. Fold everything together using a rubber spatula, pressing the spatula down to the bottom of the bowl where most of the heavier sauce base will have settled and lift up the base, gently folding it over the whites. Continue cutting into the whites, but not pushing against them, to combine the mixture. Don't overdo it; a few uncombined pieces of white are less of a problem than overworking the mixture.",
      "Gently pour the mixture into the souffle dishes - the mixture should come up somewhere between 3/4ths of the way up and the top. Slide the sheet pan of souffles into the oven. Turn up the oven to 375\u00b0F or to 385\u00b0F if making individual souffles.",
      "Bake a large souffle for 40 to 50 minutes or individual souffles for 15 to 20 minutes. Souffles are done when risen about half its original height and when sheet pan jiggled back and forth the tops won't rock - if the insides are underdone, the tops will rock slightly.",
      "Side Note: \"If you rush the souffle to the table and cut into it and see that it's undercooked, don't panic. Be as nonchalant as possible and just put souffles back in the oven and cook it a few more minutes. An underdone souffle won't fall much once out of the oven, an overdone one will.\".",
      "Take the sheet pan with the souffles out of the oven and immediately pull away the collar, and bring the souffle to the table. If you are serving individual souffles, put each souffle on a plate and sit it before a guest. If you are serving one big souffle, serve it at the table on heated plates. Make sure everyone gets some savory crust. The creamy center should function as a sauce for the rest."
