      "The butter should be malleable, but not overly soft, and the dough should not get too warm during this process.",
      "When the last of the butter has been beaten in, continue beating the dough until it is very smooth, glossy and elastic, about 5 minutes with the dough hook, or 10 minutes by hand.",
      "The dough should now have reached the clean-up stageit should come away from the sides of the bowl in a smooth entity, or should neatly roll on the counter, no longer sticky or tacky.",

      "Not to mention the waste of time, energy and perfectly good butter.)",
      "Return the bowl to the coldest part of your refrigerator and leave there overnight.",
      "If the dough is left longer than 8 hours, check periodically to make sure it has not risen above the bowl; gently punch it down as necessary.",

      "Place this ball in the bottom of one of the prepared fluted moulds.",
      "Repeat the rolling process with 6 of the remaining pieces of dough, setting them around the outside of the mould over the first ball.",

      "Cover the pan loosely with plastic wrap and repeat with the second half of the dough.",
      "Cover the pans loosely with plastic and drape a dishtowel over top.",
      "Let the shaped loaves rise in a draught-free place until plumped and risen, but not quite doubled.",
      "This last rising can take between 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 hours, as the dough is still chilled from the refrigerator.",
      "Keep an eye on the dough and make sure that it does not rise too much, or you will not get as good an oven-spring (the big initial rising in the oven).",
      "During the last 20 minutes of the final rising, preheat the oven to between 375 and 400.",
      "Brush the plump loaves with the egg-milk glaze and bake them for 35 to 40 minutes, or until they sound hollow when tipped out of their pans and tapped on the bottom.",
      "Be careful when handling the hot loaves, as the joints between the sections are still very soft and fragile.",
      "As the brioche cools, the loaves will become firm and less delicate.",
      "Turn the loaves out and cool completely on wire racks before serving or wrapping tightly in plastic wrap and aluminum foil and storing or freezing.",
      "The baked brioche can be frozen for up to 2 months, well-wrapped.",
