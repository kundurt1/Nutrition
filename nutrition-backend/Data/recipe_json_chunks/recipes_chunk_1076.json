It may take a bit less time depending on your pan and the type of potatoes as well as your oven. Just check. Poke a knife in the potatoes and they should be tender and the top should be golden brown and bubbly. One dish took 45 total and another 60 minutes. So, just check, that is the best way to make sure it is all done. Also the eggs with the cream will make a custard like so the eggs need to be set as well.",

Cover and cook, to 210-218 degrees (syrup cooked to this stage will fall in a thin stream from a cold spoon).* Discard lemon and cinnamon.",

When the beef is cooked to your liking, remove from the oven to cool, then chill in the fridge for about 20 minutes.",

      "3. Heat 2 tbsp of the oil and all the butter in a large pan and fry the mushrooms on a medium heat, with the thyme sprig, for about 10 mins stirring often, until you have a softened mixture. Season the mushroom mixture, pour over the wine and cook for about 10 mins until all the wine has been absorbed. The mixture should hold its shape when stirred. Remove the mushroom mixture from the pan to cool and discard the thyme.",

Spread half the mushroom mixture over the prosciutto, then sit the fillet on it and spread the remaining mushroom mixture over it. Use the plastic wrap edges to draw the prosciutto around the fillet, then roll it into a sausage shape, twisting the ends of plastic wrap to tighten it as you go. Chill the fillet while you roll out the pastry.",
      "5. Roll out a third of the pastry to a 7 x 12in strip and place on a non-stick baking sheet. Roll out the remaining pastry to about 11 x 14in. Unravel the fillet from the plastic wrap and place it in the center of the smaller strip of pastry and brush the pastry's edges, and the top and sides of the wrapped fillet, with beaten egg yolk. Using a rolling pin, carefully lift and drape the larger piece of pastry over the fillet, pressing well into the sides. Trim the edges to about a 1.5in rim. Seal the rim with the edge of a fork or spoon handle. Glaze all over with more egg yolk and, using the back of a knife, mark the beef Wellington with long diagonal lines taking care not to cut into the pastry. Chill for at least 30 mins and up to 24 hours.",
