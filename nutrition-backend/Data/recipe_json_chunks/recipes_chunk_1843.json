      "Grill ribs After 20 minutes, check on the temperature inside the grill.",
      "The thermometer should read 275F to 300F (open lid, if necessary, to lower temperature).",
      "Let the ribs cook like this for a total of about 2 hours, turning them over and rotating 90 degrees every 30 minutes and adding more coals after 1 hour.",
      "If the ribs seem to be getting too dark too soon, tent them with foil.",
      "After 2 hours, the ribs should be cooked through (to test doneness, lift and hold the rack with tongsthey should bend and start to break away at the bend point) and nicely charred in spots; if not, continue cooking and check frequently until they are ready (this could take up to about 30 minutes more).",
      "Brush ribs with some sauce and cook 15 minutes more.",
      "Transfer ribs to a platter and let rest 5 minutes before serving with remaining sauce.",
      "The terms grilling and barbecuing are often used interchangeably, but there is an important (if little known) distinction between the two techniques.",
      "Barbecuing uses indirect heat at a very low temperatureeven lower than indirect heat grillingto slowly cook food with a combination of heat and smoke.",
      "The slow and low heat of barbecuing is ideally suited for large, tougher cuts of meat, such as whole briskets and racks of ribs.",
      "Grilling, on the other hand, uses a more intense direct heat that browns the meat, but that doesnt add the depth of smokiness that distinguishes true barbecue.",
      "A 22-inch round charcoal grill is ideal for grilling ribs, as it will allow enough room for both hot and cool spots created by the charcoal.",
      "An 18-inch grill will also work, but you will need to start with fewer briquettes and to replenish them more frequently during cooking.",
      "Either way, they must be tended to with a watchful eye.",
      "Although it burns hotter than briquettes, hardwood lump charcoal can be used instead: Fill a chimney starter three-fourths full and add a handful of coals every 20 minutes; if the temperature in the grill rises too high, wait about 30 minutes before adding more coals.",
      "The trick is to know when the coals are starting to burn out, which can cause a significant decline in temperature; adding more coals at the right time will help maintain steady heat."

      "To make the cabbage filling: Trim away tough or blemished leaves from the head of cabbage, cut out the entire core, and slice the head in quarters.",
      "With a sharp, long-bladed knife, thinly slice the cabbage wedges.",
      "You should have about 3 quarts of very fine shreds.",
      "Put the olive oil and the butter in the skillet, and set over medium heat.",
      "When the butter melts, scatter in the chopped pancetta; let it cook for a few minutes, stirring occasionally, as it sizzles and renders most of its fat.",
      "Heap the shredded cabbage in the skillet, season with the salt, and tumble it over to mix with the fat and pancetta.",
      "Pour in the hot water, cover the pan, and heat it quickly to a boil.",
      "Adjust the heat to maintain a steady bubbling simmer, and cook, covered, for about 1/2 hour, stirring and turning the cabbage now and then, until the shreds are very soft and the pan is nearly dry.",
      "Uncover, and cook away the remaining liquid (but dont let the cabbage brown), then empty the pan into a bowl to cool.",
      "When the cabbage is at room temperature, beat the egg with a pinch of salt, pour egg over the cabbage, and toss in with the shreds.",
      "Sprinkle the filling with the cup of grated cheese and the nutmeg, and toss until thoroughly blended.",
      "For the tortelli: Cut the pasta dough in six equal pieces, and roll out as described on pages 144145.",

      "Lay a strip out horizontally in front of you on a lightly floured board.",
      "With the pastry wheel, trim the left, right, top, and bottom edges of the strip to form an even rectangle.",
      "Starting about 1 inch in from the left (short) edge of the strip and 1 inch above the bottom (long) edge, place a scant tablespoon of filling on the dough.",
      "Continue to make more mounds at 2-to-2 1/2-inch intervals.",
      "You should be able to fit eight to ten mounds on the strip, depending on length.",
      "With the pastry brush (or your fingertip) dipped in water, lightly moisten the top and bottom edges of the pasta strip; also wet the dough in a vertical line halfway between the mounds of filling.",
      "Fold the top edge down to align with the bottom edge, covering the mounds.",
      "Press lightly to seal the edges together, and press between the filling mounds, too.",
      "Finally, cut vertically (down) the lines between the mounds, separating the strip into individual tortelli.",
      "Arrange them in a single layer on a lined and floured tray.",
      "Continue to make more tortelli out of the other strips in the same way.",
      "Tortelli that you will cook soon can be left on the tray, lightly covered.",
      "Freeze tortelli for future use right on the trays until solid, then transfer them to freezer bags, packed airtight and sealed.",
      "To cook and serve tortelli for four, you will need thirty to forty pieceseight or more per serving.",

      "Meanwhile, melt the butter in a large skillet or saute pan (at least 12 inches in diameter), and keep it warm.",

      "Cook for about 3 minutes, or until the thickest part of the pasta is cooked through and perfectly al dente.",
      "Lift tortelli from the cooking pot with a spider, drain briefly, and lay them in the pan of melted butter.",
      "Tumble the tortelli over and over, gently, until all are coated; add a few tablespoons of pasta cooking water to extend the sauce if necessary.",
      "Sprinkle a cup or so of grated cheese over the tortelli, and spoon them into warm bowls.",
      "Drizzle a bit of the butter left in the pan over each portion, and serve immediately, with more cheese at the table.",
      "Cooking tortelli for six or more: If you want to serve all your homemade tortellienough for six portions (or eight small ones), you will need to cook them in two batches instead of all at once.",
      "For dressing this many pieces, I also suggest using a 14-inch skillet or saute pan, increasing the melted butter to 12 ounces (1 1/2 sticks).",
      "Cook half the tortelli for 3 minutes or so, drain, drop them into the skillet, and keep them bathed in the warm butter while you cook up the second batch.",
      "Add these to the pan, turn to coat them all with butter, sprinkle with cheese, and serve."
