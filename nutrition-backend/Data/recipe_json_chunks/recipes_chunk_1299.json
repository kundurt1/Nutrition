Lower the heat to maintain a very gentle simmer and cook for 2 minutes. Cover the skillet with a lid (keep the parchment in place) and cook for another 2 to 3 minutes, or until the potatoes are tender. A toothpick inserted into the thickest part of a piece should meet no resistance. If the chunks are not yet tender, add a bit more water and simmer for another minute or two. Check to make sure the sugar doesn't burn.",
      "Once the potatoes are tender, remove the lid and parchment and jiggle the skillet to allow the potato chunks to roll around in the rapidly reducing glaze (the vinegar, by the way, will keep the sugar from seizing after the glaze has cooled). After 6 minutes or so, the water and oil in the skillet will have separated and most of the water will have evaporated, enabling you to remove the lightly glazed sweet potato chunks with little or no oil clinging to them.",

Rinse them and shake off the water (part of the genius of this technique is that a little residual water won't cause splattering, so you don't need to towel-dry the potatoes). Put them in a heavy pan - a straight-sided saute pan is ideal, but anything not too shallow will do. They should ideally be in a single layer, but this is not always practical: aim for it, though. Add room-temperature fat just to thoroughly cover and put the pan over low heat, without a lid.",

Yes, the oil will bubble, but reassuringly, not alarmingly. Every now and again, use a thin-bladed spatula or a long-handled spoon to make sure they are not sticking (their starch has a tendency to cause this) and give the pan a shake. Be very careful: at a certain point they will be very, very fragile - cooked but not yet crisp.

      "Start by marnating pork in soy and worcestershire. I will usually chop up a garlic clove or two to go in there as well. Then cut up you herbs. After getting those chopped finely, slice the garlic. After slicing in wafer-shaped thin pieces, proceed to chop those as well. Put herbs, garlic, spices, and olive oil in a bowl and mix. I have never measured exactly how much oil, so add until you see everything coated, but not drenched. Put in fridge and chill. Not you guys, the herbs: ) After marinating 4-5 hours, remove pork from sauce and discard. Drench the tenderloin in flour until evenly coated, and pack the herb mixture around tenderloin until evenly coated and chill. I grill this, so I have no baking prep. I start a medium size fire, charcoal of course, and grill it, making sure to turn every 5-6 minutes to keep from blackening. Total time 20-26 minutes. Often serve with fresh steamed broccoli and a rice side. Enjoy!"

Add it to the soup -- let it boil; the idea is to shortcut the cooking process for the soup by rendering the veggies into the tiniest pieces possible. Stir, and simmer -- but keep it bubbling. Add the rice -- this will make it creamy without using cream. Add water if it gets too thick. After about 20 minutes, add the cheeses and the pepper, stirring all the while. once it's reached a fragrant and wonderful state, plug in the plunge blender and blend it until it's smooth.

Once the butter has liquefied, decrease the heat to lowest setting then adjust to maintain a low boil (this can be accomplished by setting stove somewhere between gas mark 1 & 2). Attach a digital thermometer to the side of the pot and immerse it into the melted butter. When the temperature reaches 255 degrees F (124 degrees C), REMOVE THE BUTTER FROM THE HEAT and using a spoon, skim the white coagulated solids and foam off the top of the butter (do not stir, just skim) and discard. When you're done skimming, immediately strain the butter into another unheated pot (as it will continue to cook until you get it out of the heated pot), put the pot cover on and allow it to cool for 30 minutes. After the butter has cooled for 30 minutes, transfer the clarified butter to its final glass storage container and cover the container with a paper towel (to prevent airborne contamination); allow the clarified butter to cool on the countertop until it solidifies; once solidified, remove the paper towel and seal the container with its lid.",

Also, be sure to close the container lid as soon as possible after usage, to prevent airborne contaminants and moisture from getting into your clarified butter, both of which can promote spoilage of the clarified butter."

Remove the star anise, line the apricots in the cake tin as per the design you wish on the cake top and pour in the caramel. I did in circular motion (requires a lot of patience). Cream butter and sugar and then add eggs gradually to a fluffy mix. Add vanilla essence; sift flour, cocoa powder, espresso powder and baking powder together in the egg mix. Fold together and add milk if required to loosen the batter. Transfer to the apricots lined cake tin and layer the batter smoothly. Bake for 25- 30 min or till the skewer comes out clean. Allow it to cool for 10 minutes. Get the cake out on the serving plate carefully as the juice and caramel would spill out once inverted on the plate.

      "The perfect Spritz is prepared in a wine glass, or rock. Add ice, Prosecco, dash of seltz and top with Aperol. This is to avoid that the Aperol settles on the bottom. Garnish with a slice of orange.",
      "The origins of this drink are not known but it is widely believed that the Spritz was born during the 19th century Austrian occupation of Italy. Its name, in fact, may derive from the German verb spritzen meaning \"to spray\" or might be linked to the name of specific Austrian wines of the western region of Wachau. German soldiers soon got used to drinking local Venetian wines at the many taverns, but the alcohol content, so much higher than the beer they would drink back home, made them dilute it with water. Thus was born the \"straight\"",
      "Spritz that is still found in some bars of Trieste and Udine.",
      "With time the Aperitivo ritual of northern Italy spread to the rest of the country, and with it the variants of the original Spritz. Many Venetian towns had their own specific variant, and many interpretations of each kind. However, in the last decade the Aperol Spritz with Prosecco has become the most popular one; fresh, sparkling and light- the ideal early evening drink.",
      "But the Spritz isn't only an Italian phenomenon. Recently, both the Spritz and Aperol are starting to take hold in many different countries, including the US. For example, in the smash hit \"Meet the Parents\" starring Robert de Niro, Barbra Streisand, and Dustin Hoffman, the latter offers De Niro an Italian Spritz instead of his usual Tom Collins."

Pulse the machine 5 to 7 times, holding each pulse for 5 full seconds, to cut all of the butter into pea-size pieces. Scatter the pieces of frozen shortening over the flour-and-butter mixture. Pulse the machine 4 more 1-second pulses to blend the shortening with the flour. The mixture will resemble coarse cornmeal, but will be a bit more floury and riddled with pale butter bits (no pure-white shortening should be visible).",
      "Turn the mixture out into a large mixing bowl, and make a small well in the center.",
      "If you find a few butter clumps that are closer to marble size than pea size (about 1/4 inch in diameter), carefully pick them out and give them a quick smoosh with your fingers. Pour the cold water into the well. Use a curved bowl scraper to lightly scoop the flour mixture up and over the water, covering the water to help get the absorption started. Continue mixing by scraping the flour up from the sides and bottom of the bowl into the center, rotating the bowl as you mix, and occasionally pausing to clean off the scraper with your finger or the side of the bowl, until the mixture begins to gather into clumps but is still very crumbly. (If you are working in very dry conditions and the ingredients remain very floury and refuse to clump together at this stage, add another tablespoon of ice-cold water.)",
      "Lightly gather the clumps with your fingers and use your palm to fold over and press the dough a few times (don't knead!-just give the dough a few quick squishes), until it just begins to come together into a single large mass. It will be a raggedy wad, moist but not damp, that barely holds together; this is exactly as it should be-all it needs is a good night's rest in the fridge.",
      "For single- and double-crust pies, mini pies, potpies, or hand pies: Divide the dough into 2 equal portions, gently shape each portion into a flat disk 1 1/2 to 2 inches thick, and wrap each tightly with plastic wrap. For quiche, leave the dough in one piece, flatten it into a single large disk 1 1/2 to 2 inches thick, and wrap tightly with plastic wrap.",
      "No ifs, ands, or buts, the dough must have its beauty sleep. That means 8 hours in the refrigerator at the very least. Extra rest is just fine; feel free to let the wrapped dough sit in the fridge for up to 3 days before rolling. (The dough may discolor slightly. No worries. This is merely oxidization and will not affect the flavor or appearance of your finished piecrust.)"
