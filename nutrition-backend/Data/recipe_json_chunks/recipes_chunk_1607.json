      "To make the dough: Place the diced butter and shortening in the freezer while you prepare the flour and water. Fill a 2-cup measuring cup with ice cubes and water. Set aside.",
      "Put the flour, salt, and sugar in the bowl of a food processor and process to mix. Add the cut up butter and shortening in pieces. Give the machine about twenty quick pulses until the mixture is the consistency of cornmeal textured with pea-sized pieces of butter. Measure out the ice water.",
      "Pour about 1/2 the measured ice water into the bottom of a large mixing bowl. Dump the flour mixture over it and sprinkle the remaining water over the top. Using both hands, toss the dough to evenly moisten. Squeeze a handful of dough: if it clumps together it is moist enough; if not, sprinkle on a little more water and toss.",
      "Turn the dough out onto the table, scraping the bowl well and, with the heel of your hand, gently mash the dough into the table with a few quick strokes. Gather the dough together into a rough log shape. Score it in three equal pieces and cut it so that it is divided into 1/3 (about 9 oz) and 2/3 (about 18 oz). Form the smaller piece into a patty about 4 to 5 inches in diameter. Form the larger piece into a log. Wrap each in plastic wrap and chill for four hours or overnight.",
      "To roll out the bottom crust: Place the smaller disc of dough on a floured surface and roll to a diameter of 12-inches. If necessary, loosen it from the table using a long flexible metal spatula. Brush off any excess flour, fold the circle in half, center it over a 9-inch glass pie plate and open it. Gently mold the dough down and around the sides without stretching it. Using a paring knife, cut the excess dough around the rim so that it is flush with the edge of the pie plate. Freeze until solid. This can be done up to a week ahead.",
      "To roll out top crust: Cut the log of dough in half lengthwise and refrigerate one half. On a floured surface, roll the dough out to a thickness of about 3/16-inch (a little less than a 1/4-inch). Loosen it from the table using a long flexible metal spatula. Using a 3-inch heart cutter, cut as many shapes as you can, as close together as possible. Layer the cut-outs on a sheet pan lined with parchment or wax paper. Roll out the second piece of dough and repeat. Altogether you need about 24 large 3-inch hearts, 5 medium and 4 small. Layer these onto the tray as well. Cover and freeze until solid. This ca",

Using a rolling pin, roll out half of the dough into a circle that's a little bigger than the circumference of the pie plate - that is, roughly an 11-inch circle for a 9-inch pie plate. Dust the dough and the counter frequently to prevent sticking - but use very little flour each time.",
      "3. To lift the dough, place a rolling pin close to an edge of the pie plate. Lift about 3 inches of the edge of the dough up onto the rolling pin. Slowly roll the pin towards you while lifting the dough.",
      "4. To lay the dough over a buttered pie plate, gently place the rolling pin over one edge of the plate and unroll the dough over the entire plate. Then lift the edges of the dough so that gravity lowers it into the bottom of the plate. With your fingers, press the dough into the corners of the plate. The dough should cover the sides, leaving about an inch or two of overlap on the edge.",

      "Attach the KitchenAid(R) Sifter + Scale Attachment to your KitchenAid(R) mixer fitted with the flat beater. Place the scale lid on top. Weigh the 1/2 cup (4 oz) butter, cut it into small cubes, place it into a small bowl and refrigerate it while you weigh and prepare the other ingredients.",
      "With the ingredient valve in the closed position, weigh the flour (5.8 oz), sugar (1.75 oz) and salt (0.03 oz) in the ingredient hopper, taring the scale between ingredients. Turn the mixer to low speed, open the ingredient valve, and sift the flour mixture into the mixing bowl. While mixing, scatter the ice-cold butter over top, and mix on medium-low speed until the mixture looks pale yellow and sandy, about 2 minutes.",
      "In a small bowl, use a fork to beat together the cream and egg yolk. With the mixer on medium-low speed, add the cream mixture and mix to form a dough, about 45 seconds longer.",
      "Turn the dough out onto a sheet of parchment paper. Gather the dough and flatten it to form a thick disk. Place the second sheet of parchment over top. Using a rolling pin, roll out the dough to form a 1/4-in-/6-mm-thick long rectangle, rolling it to be a little larger than the tart pan. Place the dough, still between the parchment sheets, on a rimmed baking sheet and refrigerate until cold, about 20 minutes. Wipe out the mixer bowl and wipe clean the paddle attachment.",
      "While the dough is chilling, make the filling. In a small saucepan over medium-low heat, melt the 4 Tbs butter. Remove from the heat. Split the vanilla bean lengthwise and scrape out the seeds with the back of a knife. Add the seeds and pod to the melted butter and place back on the heat. Cook, swirling the pan frequently, until the butter darkens to a nutty brown and the solids drop to the bottom of the pan, about 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from the heat, discard the vanilla bean pod, and set aside to cool to room temperature, about 15 minutes.",
      "Stir the butter and measure out 4 tablespoons of the butter, being sure to get as much of the vanilla bean seeds as possible. Add the butter, along with the egg, to the mixer bowl fitted with the paddle attachment. (There will be a tiny amount of browned butter leftover; don't waste it-smear it on toast!)",
      "With the ingredient valve in the closed position, weigh the sugar (2.2 oz), flour (1 oz), and salt (0.05 oz) in the ingredient hopper. Turn the mixer to medium-low speed and beat the butter and egg until combined, about 1 minute. Open the ingredient valve, and sift in the flour mixture. Mix just until the flour disappears. Remove the mixer bowl, and use a rubber spatula to blend in any flour remaining on the sides of the bowl. Transfer the filling to a small bowl and set aside at room temperature.",

      "Remove the dough from the refrigerator. Lift off the top sheet of parchment and set it aside. Flip the tart dough over onto the tart pan, using the bottom parchment to ease it into the pan, gently pressing the dough into the bottom, corners, and up the sides of the pan. Gently lift off the parchment. Use your fingers to patch any cracks in the dough. Roll the rolling pin across the top of the tart pan to cut off excess dough. The dough should be flush with the top of the pan. Using a fork, prick the bottom of the tart all over. Using the top sheet of parchment, fit it into the shell. Freeze the tart shell for 20 minutes.",
      "Prebake the tart shell, lined with parchment and filled with pie weights, dried beans, or rice, until the shell looks set and lightly golden, about 12 minutes. Carefully, lift out the parchment and pie weights. Reduce the oven temperature to 350\u00b0F/180\u00b0C/gas 4. Continue baking the tart shell until the bottom is set and lightly golden, about 10 minutes longer. Transfer the tart shell to a wire rack to cool for 10 minutes before adding the filling.",
      "Spoon the filling into pre baked tart shell, spreading it evenly over the bottom with a small offset spatula or spoon. Arrange the berries in even rows on top. Bake on the center rack until the filling puffs up around the fruit and is golden brown in the center as well as along the edges, about 35 to 40 minutes.",
      "Transfer to a wire rack to cool. Cut the tart crosswise to serve. Dust each serving with confectioners' sugar. The tart is best when served on the day it is baked. (The tart shell can be frozen, then well wrapped and frozen, for up to 1 month. Bake it, straight from the freezer, as instructed above, on the day you plan to serve it. The filling can be made 1 day in advance. Cover and refrigerate. Remove from the refrigerator and bring to room temperature before filling the tart."

    "title": "black rice butternut squash salad with cashews and chipotle dressing",
    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "Firstly cook the black rice by adding about twice the amount of water. Constantly check the rice while cooking. Sometimes it will need more water, sometimes less. You can add water (hot water) or drain the rice as needed. You will know the rice is ready when it is chewy with a nice bite to it. Once the rice is cooked, transfer it to a large tray to dry and let it cool.",
      "Grill the butternut squash and onions with a light coat of olive oil. Use high heat and turn them only once. You want those nice grill lines on the butternut squash. Pinch them with a fork to check they are cooked through. They need to have a bite to them, not too soft or they will fall apart. Move them to a plate with kitchen paper towels to drain any excess oil. Leave to cool.",
      "Segment the oranges. Make sure they are small bite sizes. You want them to be seen but not as big as the butternut which is the star of the show. Don't fuss a lot with the segments, just make sure to remove the seeds and any big white parts. Set aside.",
      "Chop spring onion and roughly chop the cashew nuts.",
      "To make the dressing use a hand blender and mix everything in a tall container. First blend the rice vinegar, shallot, chipotle, honey, orange marmalade, water, about a teaspoon of salt and a little bit of pepper. Once these are blended slowly add the olive oil with the blender running. Make sure you add it slowly so the dressing infuses nicely. Add salt to taste. We have made this dressing so many times and it is very difficult to get it right the first time. Sometimes it needs more salt, sometimes vinegar, sometimes honey and sometimes orange marmalade. It depends a lot on how flavourful the individual ingredients are, especially the honey and orange marmalade, as these can be very strong. The quantities here are a base, but feel free to adjust accordingly and do it by adding small amounts. Remember you can always add, but you can't take away.",
      "The final part is the easiest. Mix all the things! By this point the rice, onions and butternut squash must be cooled down. That's why I like to make all the prep a day ahead. Firstly mix the rice with the dressing, but not the whole amount. Make sure you keep about a third of the dressing on the side to adjust to your liking. Then add the onions, butternut squash (that should have already cut in large bite sizes), the spring onion, 2/3 of the orange segments, 2/3 of the cashew nuts, 2/3 coriander and 2/3 pomegranate seeds. Mix it well and taste it. Always taste as you go. At this point you should know if it needs more dressing and salt. Transfer to a pretty bowl or serving dish. At the end sprinkle with the remaining pomegranate seeds, orange segments, cashew nuts and coriander. Now marvel at the beauty :)"

      "In a large metal bowl mix the peanut butter, jelly and pepper flakes together. Set aside.",
      "I do not have a deep fryer but if you do, use that. I used a large ceramic coated cast iron skillet. I put enough oil in the pan to almost cover the wings; just a bit on the top was uncovered. Heat the oil until it starts to ripple on top. Put the wings in one at a time. If it does not sizzle when you put it in, it means your oil is not hot enough and you need to wait a few more minutes.",
      "Once all the wings are in, cook them 9 minutes on the first side then flip them over and cook them 5 more minutes. I had my heat on med-high. I also had to use a spatula to loosen them before I flipped them. They splash a little here so if you have an oven mitt, use it. Total cook time for a perfect wing is 14 minutes. I know this because 1) I live in Buffalo, and 2) my oldest brother used to work at the Chicken Coop :)",
      "Remove the wings and place them in a strainer. Shake around a bit and then put them into the peanut butter jelly bowl. Toss around like a professional, like you see on TV, they swirl the bowl all around and flip the wings into the air (hee hee). If that doesn't work, just use your tongs to flip them about and coat them all. The heat from the wings will melt the peanut butter mixture and coat the wings.",

If you keep a small dusted surface area with flour, you can dip your palm into it in order to keep the dough from sticking all too much. I find if I keep dusting the surface under the dough that it doesn't help as much as this method.",

Cover with plastic wrap and allow for the dough to sit for an hour before turning it over to gently deflate. After another two hours of rising, place onto a lightly greased surface (not too greasy, otherwise you will have a terrible time shaping the dough)."
