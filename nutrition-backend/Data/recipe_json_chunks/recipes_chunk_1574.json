Sprinkle sugar on the dough so that you have a light, even coating on the dough (approximately 1/3 cup). For a sweeter croissant, use more sugar here; for less, use less. It doesn't require a whole bunch of sugar, so it is all personal preference. Using your rolling pin, press and roll the sugar into the dough.",

Drop a little dollop (approximately 1 teaspoon) of raspberry preserves near the side closest to you and then sprinkle a few chocolate chips on top of that dollop. (I used about 6-8 chips in each.) Now fold the bottom of the triangle (the part with the filling on it) up a little and then roll it up towards the top point. The preserves will spill out, so I pinched the sides of the dough after that first fold and in some cases, folded over the other points to help contain it. (The goal here is a crescent shape).",

This usually happens with smaller strawberries, but it is less likely to happy with larger strawberries, unless you want a lot of vodka injected in them.",

You may hit the pit, so if you do, just move it over a little bit more and try again. Repeat with the other side.",

Very carefully, place your knife on an angle, and cut the flesh off the pit by starting in the middle, and moving your knife down at an angle to cut the flesh off the pit.

I then would let the excess drip off and then place onto wax paper, remove the toothpick by twisting and then use a spoon to create a swirl of chocolate where the hole was. You'll have to experiment and you'll inevitably end up with chocolate everywhere. But is that so bad?",
      "After each ball is coated, before chocolate sets, apply sprinkles and a sliver of crispy fried bacon. After all balls are coated and decorated, they can set in the fridge or be stored in the freezer."

Makes it so, so much easier to cut. Oh, and use a really sharp knife.) Toss the little bits into your flour. Roll them around, then put them into a large stockpot.(Make sure the heat is OFF.) This step is the most labor intensive, so consider yourself warned.",

      "3. Chop your habanero as finely as possible. No one wants a dime-sized bite of fire in their mouth. (If you have a Cuisinart, or any other food processor, steps two and three go a lot quicker. You can also process your meat, but then you don't get that nice cubed effect.)",
      "4. Brown the meat in the large stockpot. Don't cook it all the way through, okay? You're going to simmer it for a long time, so it'll get there. Trust me.",

      "I have a bad habit. I will admit it. Sometimes I get anxious when people don't \"eat the way I eat\".",
      "According to my daughter, I always seem to make gentle \"suggestions\" to people on HOW to eat something. (I do it out of love of course).",
      "For instance, I gently \"suggest\" (over and over again - or so I'm told): \"Be sure and squeeze a little lime juice on the fish before eating it\" or, \"Oh please don't forget to dip this into that\", or \"I think you should pour this on top, it tastes really good that way\".",
      "My daughter frequently announces to me: \"Stop telling me how to eat!\"",

      "While the butter is melting, pour your 1 cup of milk into the flour mixture and using a whisk, whisk away. Now pour the melted butter in your flour mixture and again, whisk away.",

      "Spray your casserole dish with non-stick spray and pour your batter into your pan.",
      "Take the fresh raspberries and drop them right on top of the batter.",
      "Now take your raw sugar and sprinkle all over the top of the batter and raspberries. I love raw sugar because it looks like little diamonds sprinkled on top of your baked goods. It adds a bit of a sweet crunchy topping. I put it on top of my Cranberry Bread or Banana Bread and on top of the crust on some of my pies.",
      "Now bake your cobbler in the oven at 350F for about 50 minutes or until golden on top. I like when the edges are a little brown and crunchy.",

Let it cook for about 30-45 seconds or until the bottom has brown spots and the edges are curving away from the griddle. Turn it over and let it cook for another 30-45 seconds, then use a pancake turner or large spatula to transfer it to a plate and cover with a towel to keep warm.",
      "3. Keep repeating the process of pressing out the tortillas, frying them, and transferring them to a plate until all 16 tortillas are finished. Serve warm."

Then place in the refrigerator for at least 3 hours to chill thoroughly. Once set, carefully remove the cheesecake from the pan by pulling up on the foil lining. Slice into bars and dust with powdered sugar."

      "2. Melt butter in a saucepan (or in the microwave) until a thermometer registers the butter temperature at least 200 F.",
      "3. Blend the egg mixture with the immersion blender until egg yolks have lightened in color. Stream in the hot butter a little at a time while you run the immersion blender, letting the hot butter cook the eggs and blending until Hollandaise is light and fluffy and all the butter has been incorporated. If the Hollandaise gets too thick, blend in a few teaspoons of water to loosen it before serving. This will only take 30-45 seconds, so keep an eye on it as you blend!",
      "4. Side note: You could also make this Hollandaise in a regular blender if you don't have an immersion blender. I just like the ease of the immersion blender!",
      "For the assembly:",
      "5. Reheat crabcakes in a hot skillet until the sides are crispy and crab cake has heated through, about 1 minute per side. Set aside.",
      "6. Poach each egg in a pot of hot water (water should be just-barely-simmering for best results) until whites have cooked through, about 4 minutes.",
      "7. While eggs are poaching, toast your English muffin halves. Place two toasted English muffin halves onto a plate cut-side up and top with a crabcake. When eggs are done, gently place one egg on top of each muffin/crabcake stack and season eggs with a bit of salt and pepper.",
      "8. Pour Hollandaise over the English muffin stacks. Top with a pinch of fresh ground black pepper and a few fresh arugula leaves and serve immediately.",
      "Notes:",
      "1. You can make the Hollandaise in a regular blender if you don't have an immersion blender (or just don't want to use it). I just like the immersion blender because it's quick and easy with not much cleanup!",
      "2. Some people swear by adding vinegar to the poaching water before poaching an egg, or like to swirl the water around with a spoon before adding the eggs to create a whirlpool that wraps the white around the yolk. I find my poached eggs turn out just fine if I crack each egg into a ramekin, then gently tip the egg into the hot water and just let it do its thing. Play around with different techniques to find out what works for you!",

      "6. Once the tea has steeped in the cream for ten minutes, remove the tea bags and discard them.",

      "13. When you are ready to serve the creme brulee, take the ramekins out of the fridge, uncover them and sprinkle a fine layer of sugar over their tops. You want to get an even layer of sugar over the whole surface, so you may need to tilt, wiggle and shake the dish to get the sugar to spread out. Tap out any excess sugar. Ignite a culinary torch and hold it near the ramekin so the flame is parallel to the surface of the custard. You want the heat from the flame to be very close to the sugar so it caramelizes, but not directly in contact with it or it will burn. Move the torch around the surface of the custard in a slow, even motion so as not to burn the sugar. Caramelize the surface of all four creme brulees. Serve immediately."

      "Now you are ready to serve. Ladle into your soup bowl, or cup, and dig in.",
      "What were these Polish folks thinking? I'll tell you what, they were thinking that this bowl of soup would be nothing but delicious. Again, at first glance you think it is vegetable soup, but when you bring the soup spoon closer, you get that mild dill pickle aroma, and the subtle taste when enjoying the soup. My daughter, who can't stand pickles, finished her bowl of soup. I was surprised, and after her first or second bite, she asked, \"Are there pickles in this?\" I said yes. She kept her face down, her bread dunked, and kept at it."

Raw honey can be substituted for regular honey, but remember that raw honey is much sweeter and stronger. If you are using regular honey, which is fine, maybe add a little more. You can use any milk you please, I just prefer almond milk."

      "For the crust:",
      "This amount makes enough for a bottom and top crust. Whether you cover the filling completely or do a lattice top is your choice.",

      "2. With your mixer on medium to medium-low, add your cold cubed butter, one square at a time. When all the butter has been added you'll want to see a sand-like texture with a few lumps of butter the size of peas.",
      "3. Turn your mixer down to low and slowly add your 1/4 cup of ice water (omitting ice) little by little until the dough just comes together and starts to pull away from the bowl (make sure that you do not over-mix at all). Depending on where you live and the weather the day you do this, your water amount will change. So you might need 1/4 cup or you might need closer to 1/3 cup. Just add a little at a time until dough just comes together. As soon as it does this, stop mixing! You can easily over mix which will result in a less flaky crust.",
      "4. Pull dough out of bowl onto a floured surface and gently pat together into a ball. Wrap with plastic wrap and chill in your refrigerator for 15-20 minutes.",
      "5. When the dough has chilled, pull it out of the fridge, split it in half and roll half of it on a floured surface until you have a circle about 1/4\" thick. Take your 9\" pie dish and place it upside down on top of the dough. You want the dough to exceed the pan about 2 inches at least, on all sides.",

Set aside.",

      "Note: Make sure you plan ahead because this recipe requires multiple chilling steps (step 8, to chill the ice cream base; and step 9 to freeze it after churning the ice cream).",
      "1. In a large saucepan, heat half-and-half and 2 cups milk together over medium heat.",
      "2. In a separate bowl, whisk together egg yolks, sugar and vanilla until the egg yolks have lightened. Set aside.",
      "3. Melt together butterscotch chips and 2 tablespoons of milk in the top of a double boiler (with simmering water in the bottom of the double boiler) until butterscotch has melted.",
      "4. Whisk the melted butterscotch into the milk and half-and-half mixture a little at a time, until combined. Bring this mixture to a simmer.",
      "5. When butterscotch mixture has reached a simmer, temper it into the eggs by pouring a few tablespoons at a time into the egg yolks and whisking well between each addition. When you've added a little more than half of the hot liquid into the eggs, go ahead and add the remainder in all at once. This method of tempering will prevent the eggs from curdling while you cook your custard base.",
      "6. When you've whisked the eggs and butterscotch mixture together, return it to the saucepan over low heat. Stir occasionally while it thickens, for about 5 minutes. Remove from heat when mixture is thick enough to coat the back of a wooden spoon.",
      "7. Remove the saucepan from the heat and let it cool for about 30 minutes.",
      "8. When mixture has cooled slightly, pour it into a large container, cover it, and pop it in the fridge for at least 4 hours (preferably 8 hours or overnight).",
      "9. When the mixture has chilled for at least four hours, pour it into an ice cream maker and churn according to manufacturer's instructions. It will be the consistency of frozen yogurt when it comes out of the ice cream maker. When done, place it in a freezer-safe dish and cover it, then put it in the freezer to set (about 2 hours).",
      "10. When you're ready to serve the ice cream, melt the semi-sweet chocolate in the top of a double boiler and drizzle it over the surface of the ice cream with a spoon to create artsy zig-zags. The chocolate lends a nice crunch and flavor to the ice cream-and it looks super pretty!",

Also, drain the pineapple rings well and reserve 2 tablespoons of the syrup for your cake batter. Set aside.",
      "2. In a small sauce pot add your first 4 tablespoons of butter. Melt over medium-low heat until just melted. I opted to go a little further and browned it slightly-it was delicious! Pour melted butter into the bottom of your lightly greased cake pan. Next, sprinkle your brown sugar over the butter. Finally, place the pineapple rings onto the brown sugar/buttered bottom and arrange so that it is one nice even layer of pineapple rings. Add one maraschino cherry into the middle of each ring and set pan aside.",
      "3. Into the bowl of your stand mixer, add your flour, vanilla sugar, baking powder and salt. With a paddle attachment, mix on low to combine.",
      "4. In another bowl or large measuring cup, mix together your milk, reserved pineapple syrup, and vanilla extract. Add the milk mixture and your butter into the flour mixture and beat on medium-low speed until combined. Stop and scrape down sides and bottom of bowl and beat another 1-2 minutes on medium (or until smooth).",
      "5. Finally, add your egg and beat for another 1-2 minutes, making sure to stop and scrape sides and bottom of bowl once more.",
      "6. Carefully pour cake batter into your prepared cake pan, making sure to spread evenly over the pineapple and cherries (but not disrupting them too much). Pat the pan on the counter a few times to settle the batter even further.",
      "7. Bake at 350\u00b0F for 35-40 minutes or until the cake is golden brown along the sides, the middle springs back when gently pressed and a toothpick inserted into the middle (but not through to the very bottom) comes out clean. Remove pan from oven and set it on a rack. Cool the cake for 5 minutes in the pan and then carefully (with oven mitts) turn it out onto a cake platter or plate. I did this by flipping my cake stand upside down, placing it over the top of the cake pan and then carefully pressing the two together, flipping the bottom of the cake pan over, so it's now the new top. Then, gently remove the cake pan. Your pineapples and cherries should be beautifully displayed on the top of your cake, with syrup dripping down. Yum!",

If it is convenient, let the bowls of Chocolate Snowballs stand at room temperature for a little while to soften a bit.
