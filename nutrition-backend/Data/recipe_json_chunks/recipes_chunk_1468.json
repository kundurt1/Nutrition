Prick goose skin all over with a small metal skewer or paring knife, angling skewer or knife sideways so you only prick skin, not meat. Season generously inside and out with salt and pepper. Chill overnight, uncovered.",
      "Remove goose from refrigerator about 1 hour before roasting. Meanwhile, prep vegetables: Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add onions and boil 1 minute. Lift out with a slotted spoon to a baking sheet to cool. To boiling water, add potatoes (keep whole so they're not waterlogged), 3 bay leaves, and about 1 tbsp. salt. When water returns to a boil, reduce heat and simmer potatoes until just tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Transfer to baking sheet with onions to cool.",

Reduce oven to 350\u00b0 and return goose to roasting pan. Roast another 30 minutes, then pour off fat as before. Baste top of goose with 1 to 2 tbsp. fat. Continue roasting, checking temperature with an instant-read thermometer inserted in thigh joint every 30 minutes, until thermometer registers 170\u00b0 to 175\u00b0, about 30 minutes more, pouring off fat if more than about 1 in. accumulates.",

      "Remove legs: Cut legs free from thighs at the knee joint (similar to a chicken); set in pan. Keeping very close to bone, cut around thigh, turning goose over and slicing up toward center of back to loosen the \"oyster,\" a nugget of meat. Grasp end of thigh bone and push back to pop joint loose. Cut through joint, then slice off meat and transfer to pan, skin side down.",

    "directions": [
      "Light the grill or heat the broiler. In a shallow dish, combine 4 tablespoons of the oil with the garlic, salt, and pepper. Add the lamb chops and turn to coat.",
      "Grill over high heat or broil the lamb chops for 5 minutes, basting with the remaining 2 tablespoons oil. Turn and cook until done, about 5 minutes longer.",
      "Variations: Add four teaspoons of chopped fresh rosemary to the garlic and oil mixture. Add three tablespoons of chopped fresh sage and an additional tablespoon olive oil to the garlic and oil mixture. Use lamb loin chops instead of rib chops.",
      "Test-Kitchen Tips: When grilling quick-cooking items such as chops, turn them only once. If you leave the meat alone for a few minutes, it will have a chance to form a nice brown crust. If you move it too soon, the meat will stick, and you'll pull off the incipient crust. Once that brown edge forms, the meat is easy to move. When you do turn the meat, use tongs or a spatula. Never poke a fork into the meat or the precious juices will escape.",
      "Wine Recommendation: Grilled lamb chops are the perfect foil for the rich cassis and herbal flavors of cabernet sauvignon. Your best bet here is a so-called super Tuscan. Though the most famous wines, such as Sassicaia and Tignanello, fetch astronomical prices, many excellent values can also be found."

      "Set the spareribs on 2 large rimmed baking sheets and spread the jerk paste all over them. Cover and refrigerate overnight. Bring to room temperature before grilling.",
      "Light a grill. Grill the spareribs over a medium-hot fire, turning them frequently if they are browning too fast, until lightly charred and crisp, about 25 minutes. Transfer the ribs to a cutting board and let rest for 10 minutes. Cut in between the ribs, arrange on a platter and serve.",
      "Wine Recommendation: A fruity, spicy Zinfandel will stand up to the heat in this dish. Choose one with low levels of oak and alcohol, since fiery spices exaggerate both qualities in a wine. Look for the 1999 Cartlidge & Brown. Or, alternatively, choose a zesty, full-flavored Caribbean beer like Red Stripe to cool down the spices."

      "Bring the water to a boil in a medium nonstick saucepan. Add a pinch of salt, then slowly add the polenta in a steady, thin stream, stirring constantly, to avoid lumps. Cook over moderately low heat, stirring often, until tender and very thick, about 35 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and stir in 1/2 cup of the mascarpone, the Parmesan and 1 tablespoon of the butter. Season with salt and pepper and keep warm.",
      "Meanwhile, melt the remaining 1 tablespoon of butter in the oil in a large nonstick skillet. Add the onion and cook over moderately high heat until softened but not browned, about 4 minutes. Add the corn and jalapeno and cook until the corn is tender, about 5 minutes. Stir in the tomatoes, season with salt and pepper and cook until just warmed through and some of the tomato juices have been released, about 5 minutes. Stir in the basil and mint.",
      "Stir the polenta; add a little hot water if it is too thick and spoon into bowls. Top with the tomato-corn ragout, garnish with thyme sprigs and serve hot. Pass more of the mascarpone cheese at the table.",
      "Wine Recommendation: A round, rich Merlot would complement the polenta perfectly and have enough edge to balance the sauce. Consider the 1995 Meerlust from South Africa or the 1996 Silverado from California."

    "directions": [
      "Mix flour, sugar, and salt in a large bowl. Drop in butter and shortening. Using your hands, a fork, a pastry cutter, or two knives, work butter and shortening into the flour mixture until it resembles cornmeal with some small pea-size pieces.",
      "Using a fork, quickly stir in 1/2 cup ice water (mixture will not hold together). Turn dough and crumbs onto a clean surface. Knead just until dough starts to hold together but some bits still fall away, 5 to 10 times. Divide dough in half and pat each half into a 6-in. disk. Wrap each disk in plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 20 minutes and up to overnight.",
      "Pie Crust Without Fear: Even experienced cooks can find it intimidating to make pie pastry. The following tips will help you turn out a terrific crust with ease.",
      "Keep the dough cold and the butter chunky. For a flaky crust, keep the butter from melting into the dough before baking. Why? Those bits of butter, which should be roughly pea-size, are meant to melt in the oven, giving off steam that creates flaky pockets. If the dough seems to be softening too much as you're working with it, throw it in the refrigerator for 15 minutes. As you roll out the dough, you should see veins of butter running through it.",
      "Roll out from the center. It's much easier to roll dough into a circle if you work from the center out to the edge in all directions.",
      "Don't overdo it. Overworking the dough and using too much flour can make pie crust tough and dry. Try to keep a light hand with both, rolling just enough to reach your desired size and using only enough flour to keep the dough from sticking to the counter.",
      "Use a pie crust bag. This handy tool takes the strain out of rolling by providing a nonstick round frame for the dough as you roll it out, allowing you to use less flour and avoid shaggy edges. Simply put your chilled dough in the bag, zip it up, roll it out, and transfer it to your pan. The bags come in different sizes for regular and deep-dish pies and are available from many online sources (such as www.sugarcraft.com; $3 to $6 per bag).",
      "Use store-bought dough. If you're short on time (or patience), you can always use ready-made dough. In our tests, we preferred Pillsbury Just Unroll refrigerated pie crusts ($99), which have a nicely crisp texture (if slightly bland flavor) and Trader Joe's Gourmet Pie Crusts ($49), which have a more buttery finish.",
      "Crimp the edges. Crimping or fluting the edges of a double-crust pie seals the dough and keeps the filling from leaking out during baking. Even on a single-crust pie, crimping can create a helpful dam effect. There are many good techniques, but our favorite is to pinch the dough around the index finger of one hand using the thumb and forefinger of the other.",
      "Note: Nutritional analysis is per serving.",
      "If you would like to use lard--which also contributes flavor and flakiness to pie crust--substitute 2 tbsp. lard for 2 tbsp. of the shortening. Try to get good-quality lard from a butcher shop if you can; it's generally much better than ordinary grocery-store lard."
