Remove from heat, and pour into a cold, clean saucepan placed in the ice bath. Do not move or disturb the syrup in any way whatsoever while cooling: If the syrup gets jiggled at this point in the process, the cream won't form. Let stand, adding ice as needed until the syrup radiates a gentle warmth to the back of the hand when held about 1-inch above it or a candy thermometer registers about 100 degrees. Once the mixture reaches the proper temperature, using a wooden spoon, stir slowly until the mixture turns a lighter color and thickens to the consistency of peanut butter, about 12 minutes. Working quickly, transfer the cream to a jar or plastic container, and store, covered, in the refrigerator for up to 6 months, or store indefinitely in the freezer."
