Place breast in between 2 large pieces of plastic wrap and pound with a meat mallet to a uniform thickness of 1/2\". Season inside of breast with 1 tsp. salt, 1/2 tsp. pepper, and 1/2 tsp. ground fennel. Transfer skin side up to a rimmed baking sheet; season with 1 tsp. salt, 1/2 tsp. pepper, and 1/2 tsp. ground fennel. Repeat with remaining breast.

Stop to scrape down the bowl as necessary. Note regarding peanut butter - although natural peanut butter or homemade peanut butter may work, I recommend using storebought peanut butter like Jif, Skippy, Peter Pan or similar so that cookies bake up thicker and spread less. Using natural or homemade peanut butter tends to result in thinner, flatter cookies, that are prone to spreading.",

Dough may be a bit crumbly in pieces, but pieces should all stick together forming a large mound when pinched, squeezed, and pushed together. If your dough seems dry, adding 1 to 2 additional tablespoons of peanut butter will help it combine.",

Slightly flattening the mounds before baking ensures they don't stay too domed and puffed while baking because this dough, when properly chilled, doesn't spread much; just don't over-flatten. Cover plate with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or up to 5 days, before baking. Do not bake with warm dough.",

Space dough 2 inches apart (8 to 10 per tray) and bake for 8 to 10 minutes, until edges are set and tops are barely set, even if slightly underbaked in the center."

In the mean time fry the bacon to a crunchy consistency and cut into bits. When the potatoes are cold, we'll cut them in half lengthwise and then into 1/4 inch thick slices and place into a bowl. Season generously with salt and pepper and set asFor the broth we'll need to do the following. Heat the broth in a small sauce pan and bring to a light simmer not a full blown boil. Add the chopped shallot, red onion, garlic, mustard, vinegar and sugar to the simmering broth. Turn heat down to low and let it simmer for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. While the broth's simmering, finely chop the cornichons or gherkins and add them to the potatoes. Now we'll add the hot broth and bacon bits to the potatoes and carefully fold everything under with a spatula. Let everything rest for at least an hour so that the flavors can disperse within the salad. Once the hour has passed, we'll add the fresh herbs to it and maybe add a splash of olive oil to the salad and carefully combine. Season again with some sea salt and freshly ground pepper, cover the boil with some plastic wrap and rest until use.The salad can be refrigerated for up to 4 days before the potatoes turn to mush, and we don't want that. But I doubt it'll survive even two days because it's so damn tasty. Serve with a medium-boiled egg (soft but not runny center), some pickles and tomatoes. Or whatever your heart desires."

Generously sprinkle with salt and pepper. Add a layer of eggplant and sprinkle on more salt. Add another third of the tomatoes, the zucchini, garlic, thyme, and the remaining onions. Top with the remaining tomatoes. Press down on the mixture with your hands. Pour over the remaining olive oil. Season generously with salt and pepper. (Don't worry. The vegetables will be piled high but collapse as they cook.)",

The vegetables should be reduced in height, and should be brownish black and caramelized, almost charred in places. Return to the oven to finish roasting. Let cool for at least 10 minutes, so the mixture can solidify a bit. Cut into squares and serve."
