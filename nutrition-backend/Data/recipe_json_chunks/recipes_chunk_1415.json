Mark Gottwald recommends using a 10-inch chef's knife to sever the lobster's spinal cord, inserting the knife at the point where the tail meets the body. Or you can insert it behind the head. The advantage to this method is that shortening the time between killing a lobster and cooking it will improve the quality of meat. But our test kitchen found the knife method took more guts on the cook's part and a little experience to master. So we opted for killing with boiling water. Be sure not to cook the meat at this point, or it may become tough. If you would rather not kill the lobsters yourself, have the seafood market steam them for 2 to 3 minutes only."

Gradually mix in pink icing color, 1 drop at a time, until the mixture is a slightly more intense shade of pink than what you want your final crust to be. Scrape the butter mixture onto a sheet of wax paper; form into a log and wrap with the wax paper. Place wrapped butter mixture in the freezer at least 1 hour or until firm and you're ready to use.",
      "Mix a couple of drops of pink icing color into the chilled water; set aside. Whisk together the flour, strawberry flavor powder, salt, and baking powder in a medium bowl. Remove butter mixture from freezer and cut the log into small pieces; sprinkle the chopped butter mixture over the flour mixture. Gently cut the butter mixture into the flour mixture using your fingertips; continue to work the butter mixture into the flour mixture until it is evenly dispersed and the entire mixture is pink. Mix in colored water, 1/2 tablespoon at a time, until the dough comes together. Form the dough into a disk and wrap with plastic wrap; transfer to the refrigerator to chill for 1 hour.",

Gradually mix in pink icing color, 1 drop at a time, until the mixture reaches your desired shade of pink. Pour the mixture into the pie crust; cover pie loosely with aluminum foil. Bake at 350\u00b0 for 16 minutes or until just set. Cool the pie to room temperature on a wire rack; chill pie in the refrigerator 8 hours or overnight.",
      "To make the whipped cream, mixing the heavy cream and icing coloring in a small bowl until desired shade of pink is reached (you will only need a tiny drop of yellow in order to warm the shade of pink up to better match that of the crust and filing). Combine the cream and sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment; beat at medium speed until stiff peaks form. Garnish pie with whipped cream as desired and serve."

In your blender, mix all of the batter ingredients except the melted butter until smooth, then drizzle in the butter with the blender running. Your batter should be the consistency of heavy cream. If it seems too thick, add more milk 1-2 tablespoons at a time to get the right consistency.",
      "Set the batter aside at room temp for one hour to rest.",
      "In your food processor, put the softened cheeses and whipping cream. Pulse to combine. Turn the machine on and drizzle in the olive oil until you have a light fluffy mixture. Hold at room temp while you make the crepes. You should have a light easily spreadable mixture.",
      "Heat a 7- or 8-inch nonstick skillet over medium high heat. Brush with a light coating of neutral oil or clarified butter. Pour about a scant 1/4 cup of batter into the hot pan and immediately swirl the pan to coat the bottom evenly. When the top of the crepe seems to have dried a bit and looks matte, flip the crepe gently with a thin spatula. It should be pale golden brown and a bit speckled. Leave the crepe on the second side just long enough to brown a bit, 15-20 seconds or so, then remove to a plate. Continue until you have used all of the batter.",
      "To assemble the cake, get a cake stand or platter, and place a crepe in the center. Using an offset spatula, spread a very thin layer of the cheese mixture over the crepe, almost but not quite to the edge. You want the cheese to be as thin if not thinner than the crepe. Sprinkle the cheese with about a teaspoon or so of the chives or other herb. Place a second crepe on top and press gently so that they adhere. Repeat, adding the chopped herbs about every other layer, until you have a cake the height you want. Finish with a plain crepe. Spread the jam of your choice in a thin layer on top of the cake. Refrigerate. Take out of fridge about 30-45 minutes before you want to serve. Makes an excellent brunch dish, lunch with a small salad, or side dish."

Place the dough slightly off-center on the palm of your throwing hand (generally, if you're comfortable spinning the dough counterclockwise, use your right hand; for spinning clockwise, use your left). Make a fist with the other hand, knuckle side up, and place it under the dough, beside your throwing hand, to support the other side. Hold the dough parallel to the ground, between your waist and chest.",

Toss with fast, deliberate moves; if you're tentative and slow, the dough will be more likely to flop over or droop. Don't get discouraged! In our test kitchen, a little practice produced amazing results (and a lot of laughs)."

(As you work, slide the dough back and forth every minute or so with a quick jerk of the peel to help keep it from sticking; if it does, lift dough and sprinkle more flour underneath, then jerk again.) First, sprinkle half of each kind of mozzarella onto the pizza. Then release your inner Jackson Pollock, spooning half the sauce over the pizza with a flicking motion. Add half the roasted peppers, mushrooms, and sausage. Grind on black pepper to taste.",
