      "Repeat the process with the remaining ingredients, and pour this into the sauce pan as well.",
      "Bring the sauce to a boil, then immediately stir and turn the burner to low. Let the sauce simmer UNCOVERED for approximately 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add salt to taste.",
      "Prepare and chop fillings and toppings while the green sauce is simmering.",
      "Set up your frying pans: you will need one small frying pan for the tortillas, and one small frying pan for the sauce.",
      "Once the sauce is reduced and thickened, pour about a cup of it into one of the frying pans. Heat this pan to low. Pour a tablespoon of oil in the other frying pan and heat this pan to medium.",
      "Take one of the tortillas and fry in the pan with the oil, about 30 seconds each side. You do not want it to get crispy, just slightly toughened. Using a separate utensil, dip the tortilla into the warm sauce in the other frying pan. Fold in half and lay on a plate. Repeat the process with 2 more tortillas.",
      "Inside each fried and sauce dipped tortilla, put a little of the queso fresco, a little avocado, and a little chicken. Don't overfill the tortillas. Arrange the filled tortillas on a plate overlapping each other, and ladle a bit more of the green sauce from the sauce pan on all of them. Take a teaspoon of the crema, and drizzle across the enchiladas in a streaking motion. Sprinkle with some of the cilantro and diced onion.",
      "You will need to prepare the enchiladas for each person you are serving. So, it is a lot of standing over a hot stove but worth the effort. Because of the time involved, I would not recommend this dish for a large crowd, although you could just prepare the tortillas dipped in the sauce and keep them warm in the oven until it is time to assemble.",
      "I love the leftovers for breakfast the next morning. If there is more sauce than tortillas left, you can freeze it and throw it into a pot of chili for extra flavor."

      "Start by reconstituting the mushrooms in the red wine and flavoring them with the cloves. (I put the mushrooms, cloves, and wine in a 2-cup Pyrex measuring cup and nuke them on medium-low for 3 minutes. If you have your own favorite way of reconstituting dried mushrooms, use that instead.)",
      "Slice the white and the tender green parts of the scallions into half-inch lengths.",
      "Choose a heavy pot big enough to hold all 40 brussels sprouts snugly. Coat the bottom liberally with peanut oil (I especially like the flavor of Spectrum Naturals unrefined peanut oil). Add the scallion slices and put the pot over a medium flame.",
      "Rough-chop the garlic and add it to the scallions.",
      "As soon as the garlic is fragrant (a minute or two), dump in the Shaoxing wine and the soy sauce. (Dump them in all at once rather than dribbling them so they don't vaporize and burn you.) Holding back the mushrooms and cloves, pour the red wine into the pot. Add a teaspoon of salt. (I know it sounds strange to use both soy sauce and salt, but Chinese cooks condemn the practice of achieving saltiness solely with soy sauce; they say American Chinese food \"tastes like soy sauce\" instead of tasting like food.)",
      "Grate the ginger into the pot till you reach the point where you will bark your knuckles on the grater; throw the remaining bit of ginger into the pot. Add the two star anise stars. Take the peel off the tangerine with a vegetable peeler, only the orange part (the white pith is not bitter, as some people say, but it is tasteless); taking it off in one long piece is elegant, but it doesn't change the flavor to take it off in three or four pieces; keep track of how many because in a while you're going to fish them out. Eat the tangerine or save it for some other purpose.",
      "Reduce the liquid by simmering until it is a thick, shiny, syrup studded with pieces of scallion and garlic (about 10 minutes).",
      "Meanwhile, trim the stems of the brussels sprouts flush and remove any bruised or battered leaves. (The discarded stems and leaves make a nice little soup the next day with some meat broth and a potato.) Halve the sprouts lengthwise.",
      "Discard the cloves and the stems of the mushrooms and cut the caps into slivers.",
      "When the sauce is cooked down to syrup, remove the pan from the fire. Remove the lump of ginger, the star anises, and the tangerine peel. (Eat the peel; as my great-grandmother used to say, \"The cook gets the licks.\" Or save it for some other purpose.) Stir in the sprouts, the mushrooms, and the brown sugar. Every sprout half should be thoroughly coated with the syrup. Luckily, the sprouts are light-colored and the syrup is dark, so you can see whether you've done a thorough job.",
      "Now put the lid on the pot and put the pot over a low flame till the sprouts are cooked through (40 minutes).",
      "Serve them and eat them promptly. They don't taste as good if you let them cool down."

Discard half and add another 60 g / 1/2 cup flour and 60 g / 6 tablespoons water and stir to combine. Replace the cheesecloth and allow to ferment at room temperature for 8 to 12 hours.

Once it is fragrant with a creamy, yeasted scent, perform the float test by dropping a dollop of the starter into a cup of water.

If it sinks, perform one or two more feedings or extend the feeding time before trying again.",

Feed it daily if kept at room temperature, or store it in the refrigerator and feed it weekly, always discarding (or using!) some, but not all, of the \r\noriginal starter before each feeding.

And of course, like any good quiche, you can add a lot of additional ingredients to make it your own, like roasted thick-cut bacon or pan-fried pancetta and steamed spinach!

      "Twenty or thirty minutes before you start cooking, place your clams in a bowl of fresh water to let them purge any grit from inside their shells. Just before cooking them, drain.\r\nFill a medium-sized skillet (that has a lid) with water until you've got 1/4\" or 1/2\" in the bottom. Add the bay leaf, and set the skillet over medium-high heat. When the water is nearing a boil, carefully place the clams in, cover the skillet and steam 7-10 minutes. If some still haven't opened at that point, you can let them steam a bit longer. Ultimately, discard any that don't open. When the clams are cool enough to handle, remove the meat from the shells, coarsely chop it and reserve in a bowl with any juice you can save. You may then discard the cooking liquid and the shells.",
      "In a 8\" or 10\" skillet, fry the bacon until crisp. Remove to a paper towel-lined plate to drain and cool some; then chop and reserve. If there is roughly 1.5 tablespoons of drippings left, you don't need the butter. Or, if you don't want to saute your corn and scallions in the drippings, pour them off and add the butter to the skillet.",
      "Heat the skillet over medium-high heat, and when the butter is melted or the drippings are hot, add the corn, 1 cup scallions and salt. Toss to combine well and cook until the veggies have softened but are still nice and bright. Remove from heat.",
      "Set a cast iron skillet over medium heat. When hot, add one tortilla. Carefully place half the cheese, half the corn-scallion mixture, half the bacon and half the clams on tops. Add a second tortilla to make a \"sandwich\", pressing down gently with a large spatula. \r\nPay attention to the heat- if your tortillas brown too quickly, turn it down some. After a couple minutes, carefully flip the quesadilla. After a couple minutes, you might want to flip it again. You want the cheese nicely melted, everything warmed through and the tortillas lightly golden. Garnish with remaining chopped scallions.",

Using a 3-inch cookie cutter or inverted glass, cut out pastry circles and place on an ungreased cookie sheet. Reroll and cut scraps until dough is used up. In the center of each round, place about a half-teaspoon of the filling. The cookies should be well filled, but make sure to leave room around the edges of each circle. Dipping your fingers in water, lightly moisten the edges of each circle and fold one half over the filling to form a semicircular pocket. Use a fork to crimp closed the edges. Bake for 10-15 minutes, removing from oven when the edges are just turning golden. Transfer cookies to cooling racks and sift a generous amount of confectioner's sugar over them. Repeat the process with the reserved dough from the refrigerator."

If you want to make it a bit more Frenchified you could substitute equal amounts tarragon & chive for the parsley and a concasse of tomato wouldn't hurt either."

      "Recipe Notes:\r\nSlow cooker variations: The exact heat and speed of cooking can vary between different slow cookers. Some slow cookers, especially newer models, may cook hotter and faster than others. Our research has also led us to believe that some models allow for imperceptible evaporation of liquid (although you'd expect that no liquid would be lost when using a slow cooker), which can leave your recipes less saucy and moist. Because this particular recipe uses very little liquid, it's particularly sensitive to these variations. No need to worry - it's delicious even when cooked until it's a bit drier, particularly since the creamy Caesar dressing adds moisture. The key is simply to control the cook time and temperature to yield the most juicy, fall-apart-tender result.\r\n\r\nAdding Caesar dressing: For best results, leave the Caesar dressing and chicken in the crock pot for 30 minutes before serving. This allows the flavors to develop and meld together. You can eat the sandwiches immediately after stirring in the Caesar dressing, but the flavors may be stronger and more pronounced."

Arrange the potato slices neatly in the baking dish in one layer, overlapping each one about the third of the way over the slice that came before, until the bottom of the dish is neatly paved. Sprinkle with salt and cover with the third of the meat. Repeat the process (potatoes + sprinkle of salt + ground beef) two more times.

Once the liquid starts to bubble, remove the cover, reduce heat to 365\u00b0 F and bake for another hour or so (this will depend on your oven, dish, and many other factors, so start watching at about 45 minutes). The moussaka is done when the potatoes on top are golden brown, spotted with dark crispy areas, while the potatoes inside are very soft. (If you notice during baking that top layer is getting dry, sprinkle it with water and brush it with vegetable oil. If you notice that the entire dish is getting dry, add a bit more warm milk. If you think that the top is getting baked faster than the inside, cover with the foil again. If the inside is fully done and the top is not golden, finish the dish under the broiler for a minute or two.)",
      "Remove the moussaka from the oven. Let it settle for about 15 to 20 minutes, then cut into square slices and eat immediately."

As you spread, pop any air bubbles in the pastry so that the cream can really penetrate every layer and fill the craters. Continue until you have worked with all of the layers (cover the top layer with pastry cream and crumble any sacrificial discs over top for decoration. Place the cake in the refrigerator for several hours so that the pastry can absorb the cream, or eat it straight away.",

Pour the egg mixture into the rest of the milk and cook over medium-low heat, stirring constantly and making sure to scrape the bottom and edges of the pan, until the cream thickens to a custard-like consistency, 10 to 15 minutes.",

Discard any clumps and move on with your life/cake.",

      "Blackberry syrup: Place 1/2 cup of sugar and 1 cup water in a pan on medium heat, stirring till the sugar is dissolved. Add the blackberries and gently stir. Allow to cook till the blackberries are soft and can be squashed. Remove from heat and let cool. Blitz in a food processor or with a hand-held immersion blender. Now this next step is crucial - because the jelly will lose some of its sweetness when it cools down, taste the syrup now and add more sugar if necessary, stirring to make sure it dissolves well. Strain 160ml of the liquid mixture for the jelly. (Refrigerate the rest of liquid and strained out blackberry mass/puree for use later in the verrines)",
      "Blackberry jelly: if using gelatine leaves, soak them first in water for 4-5 minutes till the soften and swell, then add to 160ml warm blackcurrant syrup (if blackcurrant syrup is cold, gently reheat it till warm but not boiling), stirring till it dissolves. If using powder, sprinkle onto a few tablespoons of warm water and leave to stand for a few minutes, then combine with warm blackcurrant syrup and mix till dissolved. Note that I used gelatine leaves so my instructions for the powder are a guide. When the liquid is ready, gently pour equal portions into your 6 tumblers. Cover and leave to set for a couple of hours (or overnight).",
      "Cooled, whipped cream: By the time you're making the cream, the jelly should be set and ready to be topped. Cool your mixing bowl and whisking attachment in the freezer for a half hour before whipping the cream. When the utensils are cool, combine the cream, 1/2 cup of sugar and vanilla extract in the bowl and whip till light and soft. To this creamed mixture, add your mascaporne and gently fold in. You can use the cream as is or add a tablespoon of the set-aside blackberry puree (leftover from step 1) or do both.",
      "Set out the glasses with the set jelly and ladle into each glass a teaspoonful of the blackberry puree (leftover from step 1). Top/fill up with the whipped cream. Do this for all the verrines.",
      "When you're done, place in the fridge for at least an hour or overnight, covered to 'set'.",
      "Sugared Almonds: Pre-heat your top grill to the highest. In a baking tray, place the flaked almonds and gently sprinkle the light brown sugar on top of the almonds. \r\nPlace the tray 6 inches down from the heat source and let brown for 3-4 minutes. Remove from oven, pour onto a bowl or unto a plate and let cool for a few minutes.",
      "When ready to serve verrines, (give your guests long handle spoons) sprinkle with sugared almonds and some lime zest. Serve with a lime wedge and have your guests squeeze some lime juice over the top - the fragrance is wow. If you have key limes which I've heard so much about but never used, go ahead and avail yourself!",

Secure the lid tightly and place the jar in a quiet corner of your kitchen. Within the first half an hour, you will notice the cabbage settling down as it sweats and more liquid is released. An hour later, the level of the cabbage would have sunk further. Leave the jar to rest undisturbed in this spot for 48 hours. During this time, you will notice that the empty space in the jar is starting to get cloudy. This is the beautiful fermentation gases brewing and working their magic to create a tart kimchi.",

      "Note - Korean pepper powder also known as Kochugaru or Gochugaru is a specialty spice mix that can be sourced from your local Asian supermarket. It is a mix often made up of coarsely ground Korean red pepper and salt. It can be substituted by grinding 3 tablespoons red chilli flakes, 1 tablespoon smoked paprika and 1 teaspoon salt in a mortar and pestle. A pinch of cayenne pepper can be added to this mix for extra heat."

    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "In a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, whip the tahini on high speed for 5 minutes, until slightly thickened.",
      "Gradually add the sugar and beat to combine. Scrape down the sides of the bowl and whisk again-all of the sugar should be dissolved (and no longer visible).",
      "Add the butter, piece by piece, scraping down the sides of the bowl, until fully incorporated.",
      "Add the egg and salt and beat until well combined.",
      "The frangipane can be made a day or two ahead and stored in the fridge (it also freezes wonderfully!). Bring to room temperature before using.",
      "To make this large galette, you'll need enough pie dough for one double-crust pie (or, if your recipe is for a single crust pie, you'll need to double it!). I used Stella Parks' No-Stress, Super-Flaky Pie Crust: https://food52.com/recipes/72570-stella-parks-no-stress-super-flaky-pie-crust. Make sure your dough is ready to roll before you start the rest of the recipe. Roll it out into a rectangle that's approximately 13 by 18 inches, then transfer to a parchment-lined half sheet pan.",
      "Use a large spoon or offset spatula to spread the soft frangipane over the dough, leaving a 1-inch border. You might not need all of the frangipane. Transfer the whole pan to the fridge while you prep the apples.",
      "Peel 3 of the apples-this should give you 1 cup of apple peels, which you'll use for the glaze. (If you're not making the glaze, you don't have to peel any apples!) You can peel the remaining apples or leave them unpeeled-your choice! Quarter and core the apples, then thinly slice the apple quarters, leaving them as \"bundles\"-this will make it easier to arrange your slices on top of the dough.",
      "Remove the pan from the fridge, then arrange the apples over top in whatever arrangement you'd like. Fold the edges of the dough over the apples, creating a dough border.",
      "Heat the oven to 500\u00b0 F, preferably with a pizza stone on the bottom rack. While the oven heats, transfer the pan back to the refrigerator to chill. When the oven's hot, brush the beaten egg over the dough border, then sprinkle the whole tart-dough included-with the sugar (you might use a bit less than 2/3 cup).",
      "Put the pan in the oven, on top of the stone, and immediately reduce the temperature to 400\u00b0 F. Bake the galette for 45 to 60 minutes, rotating halfway through, until the crust is a deep golden-brown.",
      "While the galette bakes, make the optional glaze. Place the apple peels and hibiscus in small saucepan with 2 cups of water. Simmer until the apple peels are limp and the hibiscus has imparted a deep pink color. Strain through a fine mesh sieve. Return the liquid back to the pot, then add the honey, lemon juice, sugar, and a pinch of salt. Bring to a simmer and reduce, stirring very frequently with a rubber spatula, until thick and syrupy (about 15 to 20 minutes).",
      "When the galette is out of the oven, wait 10 minutes before glazing it with the honey-hibiscus syrup. Serve the galette on its own or with ice cream."

On a lightly floured large piece of parchment paper roll out each disk into a 8\" circle about 1/2 inch thick. Use an 8\" to 9\" dessert plate as your guide and cut with a pizza cutter. Save and refrigerate the scraps for the 5th dough circle. Knead the scraps together to form a disk and roll as described previously. Reuse a cooled parchment lined pan for the 5th dough circle cookies. Place a thin layer of orange marmalade over the dough round. Cut the dough circle into 8 triangles. Form a teaspoon sized bullet with the filling and place almost at the begining of the wide end of each triangle. The filling bullet should reach the end of the triangle dough. Roll up the dough and filling into a crescent starting with the wide end. Arrange seam side down; 12 cookies on each pan. Push each cookie into a semicircle crescent shape. Nice and neat! Sprinkle with cinnamon sugar.",

Remove them with a slotted spoon, divide them in 3 parts and put them in the pans with the 3 sauces. Mix well on low fire and serve hot.\r\nDecorate the gorgonzola gnocchi with the crushed pistachios and the orange cream gnocchi with the orange zest. \r\nServe with more thinly grated Parmigiano Reggiano or Grana Padano and ground pepper on the top."

Put the beet slices into a bowl along with the juice of 2 or 3 lemons. You want plenty of juice, but it does not need to be soupy. Add the cayenne pepper. Set the beets aside to marinate at room temperature until plating time. But do not let them marinate more than 4 hours. Drain them well before plating.",
      "Cut off the thick stems of the beet greens, then clean the the leaves by totally submerging them in a colander set in a large bowl of cool water. Agitate them well and leave to soak a few minutes. Then lift out the colander, drain the water, refill the bowl and repeat until there is no grit. (This is both easier and much more effective than the running water and colander method.) Roll a stack of beets leaves lengthwise, like a cigar. Then slice across the roll making perfect chiffonades about 1/4 inch wide. Continue with all the greens. Put the greens into a big pot with a lid. Add a tablespoon or two of water. Cover the pot and bring what little liquid there is to a boil. Turn off the heat and leave the lid on for 5 or 6 minutes before proceeding. Put the greens back into the colander and press out as much liquid as you can.",

Remove the pan from the heat and add 1 teaspoon paprika, 1 teaspoon ground cumin, 1 teaspoon oregano, 1 teaspoon kosher salt, along with a few grinds of black pepper. Stir in the cooked beet greens adding a bit more olive oil if the mixture seems dry.",
      "Mound the greens onto the center of a serving dish and give them a good squeeze of lemon juice. Surround the greens with plenty of the raw marinated golden beets. Give the beets a light sprinkling of cayenne if you like. A good drizzle of olive oil finishes the dish. Serve at room temperature."

Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let it sit at room temperature for a few hours. After the raisins are done soaking put them into a frying pan along with the sugar and bring the mixture to a boil. Reduce to a medium heat and continue to simmer until the liquid has thickened into syrup and has reduced to the point where you can see the tops of the raisins in the pan. Let the conserve cool at room temperature until it is needed.",
      "To make the tuille batter simply mix together the honey, sugar, orange juice, almonds, poppy seeds, and bread flour until you have a smooth batter. Refrigerate the dough for at least half an hour before using.",
      "While the tuille batter is refrigerating you can make the mascarpone mousse, but first preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit for the tuille. Mascarpone is a very rich, creamy, and absolutely scrumptious cheese, it embodies the culinary abstraction of a cloud. Cream the mascarpone cheese so that is nice and fluffy, then cream in the sugar followed by the yoghurt. (make sure that you use a plain yoghurt of no less than 3% fat content, (a heavy Greek yoghurt works the best) Whip the cream to soft peaks, add the sugar and continue whipping until you have medium peeks. Fold the cream into the mascarpone mixture, cover and refrigerate it until you are ready to plate the dessert.",
      "Remove the tuille batter from the fridge and spread it out onto a baking sheet lined with a silpat or parchment paper leaving one inch around the sides for spreading. Dont worry about getting the tuille perfectly even it will even out when it bakes. If you are using parchment paper double pan the tuille so it does not burn on the bottom, place the pan in the oven and bake for 7 minutes or until the tuille is an even light brown; it may get darker on the edges but that is ok you can cut the edges off later. Let the tuille cool after baking before cutting the dark edges off and breaking it into 6 pieces",
      "The final component of this desert is the caramel for the mouse, the first thing you always do when making a caramel is clean your pot and all of your utensils. Using a half a lemon and some salt to scrub out the pot works well but if you don't have these any acid will work; the acid cleans away any food particles that may cause the caramel to crystallize. It does not take much for the sugar molecules to crystallize, they like to act in unison so if one crystallizes it influences the others and the result is a course caramel. Rinse thoroughly and then place the sugar, lemon juice, honey, and water into the pot and bring to a boil. Reduce to a medium heat and simmer until the sugar starts to become a light amber colour, this means the sugar is caramelized, (if you want a darker richer caramel cook the sugar to a darker colour of brown)immediately remove from the heat and add the butter and cream. Stir the cream and butter in and place aside to cool until needed.",
      "I like to present the dessert in a hallowed out orange but you can also use a bowl or a wide mouthed glass. Place two tablespoons of caramel in the bottom of each vessel top it off with the mascarpone mousse followed by a drizzle of caramel, the conserve, and the tuille. Finally grind up some earl grey tea in a mortise and pestle and sprinkle it on top; this provides a wonderful aromatic layer on top of the layers of flavours."

      "We then press it like a pizza dough in a dredge made up of flour, cornmeal and cayenne pepper. be mindful that you dont want to stretch it like a pizza as that will be too thin and wont give you the chew that makes the dish delicious. You want to get it pressed out to about 1/4\" thick. We get a cast iron skillet hot with enough oil that the bread can crisp nicely. Allow your oil to heat just to the smoking point and add the dough. air bubbles will begin to rise. at this point you may need to reduce your heat in order not to burn, once you have achieved the desired color on the bottom side, flip it and finish cooking. take it out of the pan and allow it to quickly drain on a paper towel. sprinkle with sea salt and cut in the shape you prefer.",
      "In a medium bowl, thoroughly blend the flour, yeast, and salt. Add the water and, with a wooden spoon and/or your hands, mix thoroughly. (We've found that it's easiest to start with the spoon, then switch to your hands.)",
      "Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a kitchen towel and allow it to rise at room temperature (about 72\u00b0) for 18 hours, or until it has more than doubled. It will take longer in a chilly room and less time in a very warm one.",
      "Generously flour a work surface and your hands and scrape out the dough. Divide the dough into 4 equal parts and press each to about 1/4-inch thick. (You don't want to stretch the dough like you're making a pizza because you're looking for a chewy final product.)",
      "In a shallow casserole dish or a large plate with a rim, mix together the dredging ingredients. Transfer the pizza dough discs to the dredge and make sure they're thoroughly coated on each side.",
      "In a cast-iron skillet or other heavy frying pan with sides, heat about 1 inch of canola oil to just before the smoking point (you don't need the pizza dough to be completely submerged-only one side at a time needs to be in the hot oil). To test whether the oil is hot enough to fry, you can use an instant-read thermometer (you want it between 350\u00b0 and 375\u00b0 F); insert the handle of a wooden spoon (if it's hot enough, oil will bubble around the handle); or drop in a few flecks of water (they'll furiously bubble).",
      "Add a disc of dredged dough (two, if you can fit them) and fry until deeply brown on the bottom. Flip and continue to fry until that side is brown, too. Remove to a wire rack, sprinkle with flaky sea salt, and set aside until cool enough to handle. Repeat with the remaining discs of dough. (Because some of the dredging came loose when I was frying the dough, I found it helpful to change the oil in between fries-otherwise, the flecks of flour and cornmeal can start to burn).",
      "Cut the dough into wedges and serve with your favorite dip. (Or turn it into a pizza-of-sorts: Top with fresh tomato slices, or Marcella Hazan sauce, and tears of mozzarella or, even better, burrata.)"

Basically, you simply cut it into chunks, remove the seeds, slather the pieces with olive oil and lightly sprinkle with Thyme, a little salt and a touch of pepper. You then bake at 350 until tender, remove the skins and mash up the pumpkin. This produced enough pumpkin for several pies and several cups of filling for freezing.",

Strain and reserve the liquid, add a little brown sugar and chipotle powder and reduce to a thick caramelized pumpkin barbecue sauce. Unique and delicious.",

Mix dry ingredients together and form a well in the center. Add the olive oil and eggs, fold into the dry ingredients and then knead until well mixed. Add a few drops of water if the dough won't hold a ball shape, but the mix should not be wet. Wrap in plastic and set in the fridge for at least an hour.",

      "While the pastry is cooking, let's get ready with the cheese cake and the fig nougat. In a separate bowl mix together 3 fresh figs with skin, ricotta, vanilla sugar and cream cheese.",
      "Fig nougat was kindly given to me by Sun Flavours. It has a very interesting spicy and nutty flavour... I would simply say: it tastes like Christmas, but in a very mild way! Inspired by the typical goodies from the Algarve (southern part of my beloved Portugal) - such as: figs, almonds, anise, and cinnamon... it nicely blends with my summer fig tart and will work as the only sugar injecting ingredient! You can easily find it in some Portuguese stores in Paris or substitute by traditional French fig jam...",
      "Nougat serves as a layer between the dough and the cream. It was a bit thick, so I sliced it in two and then cut each of those parts in two halves. Nicely spread the nougat over the hot dough.",
      "Now add the creamy mixture and shave the raw dough left-overs on top. Put the cake back into the oven and bake for another 20-25 minutes until your dough becomes golden brown and the cream becomes solid and starts separating from the dough.",
      "Sweet pastry dough is very fragile when hot, so let the cake cool a bit in the form. Then move it to the plate, cut off the baking paper and decorate with the remaining fresh figs.",
      "This tart is so delicious and healthy! Tarts are great any time of the year, but especially in summer, because you have so many fresh fruit, that you can experiment with. Instead of figs, you could use plums, apricots, pears, raspberries, strawberries, etc... Once you start appreciating the natural sweetness of the most amazing and humble goodies from your own summer garden, life changes forever!"

The next day (or evening, if you started the soak in the morning), drain the beans, add them to a medium-sized, heavy pot, and cover them with 4 to 5 cups water. Add the bay leaf, a pinch of salt, and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Reduce the heat to about medium-low-you want the water to remain at a very low bubble with the pot partly covered. Simmer for 45 minutes or so, until the beans are just tender. If your beans are particularly fresh, this might only take 35 minutes; older, an hour or more. Remove from the heat, cover with a lid, and allow the beans to rest for at least 30 minutes. Leave them in their liquid; you'll need to use it later.",

Sprinkle the flour over the oil, and whisk until smooth-a flat whisk works well here. Whisk the oil-flour mixture for a few minutes, then switch to a wooden spoon, and stir, constantly, as the roux begins to darken to a dark caramel color. The time it takes to reach this shade depends on the heat you're using, but count on around 20 to 30 minutes at medium-low.",

Stir for a couple of minutes, add the garlic, thyme, and a good several grinds of black pepper, and saute for another 7 to 8 minutes, until the vegetables are light golden around the edges and begin to wilt.",

Whisk well, bring to a simmer, and cook for about 5 minutes, until the broth thickens. Add the beans and any remaining liquid (you should have another 3/4 cup or so), and cook for a few minutes more. After about 10 minutes, add the greens, and simmer gently until their texture turns silken, anywhere from 2 to 3 minutes to 10.

Put the Brusslies into the skillet and flip the halves over, as necessary, so the cut side is down.",

(I put the covered jar in the serving dish, with the serving utensil, well in advance of the meal, so everything is right there when I need it.)

It adds extra time, so I'm dropping it into a footnote, as it were: Heat oven to 350 degrees. For a fancy touch, soak the pepitas in 2 tablespoons of lime juice for at least 15 minutes. Drain, reserving the lime juice for another use. (It will be a bit cloudy, but perfectly suitable for salad dressing, quacamole, hummus, etc.) Toast the pepitas on a parchment lined baking sheet until toasted and fragrant, 10 - 15 minutes. Allow to cool completely on a clean plate - you want them off the parchment, which will be somewhat moist if you soaked the pepitas -- and then put in a tightly covered box, if not using right away."

    "ingredients": [],

      "Whisk together the flour, sugar, and salt in a large bowl or the bowl of your food processor. (I used my food processor, but I didn't always have one and have had great results making this crust by hand.) Please note that this is basically a double pie, meaning it is a lot of dough! I did mine in two batches-that is, I divided the recipe in half and repeated the process twice. If you have a giant mixing bowl or food processor, go for it, but my equipment isn't large enough to handle 7 1/2 cups of flour.",
      "Add in the chopped pieces of cold butter and cold shortening. Blend together with your hands or pulse with your processor until you have coarse crumbs (it doesn't have to be perfect). You can use a pastry cutter, too, but I find that a clean pair of hands work best. Mix together the water and vinegar in a small bowl. When ready, slowly drizzle it over the dough, a tablespoon or so at a time, gently stirring the mixture with a fork or pulsing with your processor, until fully incorporated (you may not use all of the liquid).",
      "It might seem a bit too wet at this point, but it will dry up while it sits in the fridge. Form the dough gently into 2 loose balls, wrap tightly in plastic wrap, and chill in the fridge for a minimum of 3 hours or overnight (as always, overnight is best). Make your filling when you are almost ready to use your dough.",
      "For the marshmallow fluff: Stir together the sugar, corn syrup, water, and salt in a small saucepan over high heat. Bring the mixture to a boil, stirring often, until the it reaches 240\u00b0 F on a candy/fat thermometer. Be careful not to let the mixture bubble over-turn the heat down if you need to and keep a watchful eye over it. This might take a little longer than you think, but just keep at it. Mine took about 10 minutes, but when you're standing there watching it, it feels like an eternity. It got stuck at around 220\u00b0 for what seemed like forever, but then it eventually got up to 240\u00b0.",
      "Meanwhile, place the egg whites and cream of tartar in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment. Start whipping the egg whites to soft peaks on medium speed. You want to have the egg whites whipped and ready to go, waiting for your syrup to be drizzled in. If they're whipping faster than your syrup is coming to temperature, just stop the mixer until the syrup is ready, which is what I did.",
      "When the syrup reaches 240\u00b0 F, reduce the mixer speed to low and slowly drizzle about 2 tablespoons of syrup into the egg whites to warm them. If you add too much syrup at once, the whites will scramble. Slowly drizzle in the rest of the syrup, a bit at a time-seriously, do not do more than 2 tablespoons at a time.",
      "Increase the speed to medium high and whip until the marshmallow fluff is stiff and glossy, about 7 solid minutes. Don't try to speed this process up! Add in the vanilla and whip 2 minutes more. Use the fluff immediately or refrigerate stored in an airtight container for up to 2 weeks. (I made my fluff about 4 hours ahead of time before baking with it, and I actually doubled the recipe so that I'd have some extra to spread of the top of the pie pieces... just an idea!)",
      "For the chocolate filling: If you have a double boiler, use that. I don't, so I just melt chocolate very slowly and carefully because it burns easily. In a saucepan, combine your cocoa powder, heavy cream, chocolate, sugar, butter, and salt. Stir constantly medium-low heat constantly until everything is melted and smooth. Remove from the heat and set aside. The mixture will thicken up as it cools down, making it easy to spread over your pie crust later.",
      "For assembly: Remove your crust from the refrigerator to allow for easier rolling. Preheat your oven to 400\u00b0 F. Generously butter a half-sheet pan. Roll out your first ball of dough-it should be about an inch or two longer and wider than the baking sheet, but it does not have to be perfect by any means. If you need to re-roll a few scraps here and there to patch up pieces, that's fine. Move it over onto the baking sheet by draping it over the rolling pin. Unfold it and gently press the pie crust into the bottom of the baking sheet.",
      "Spread your chocolate mixture over the dough, then scatter mini marshmallows over top, saving some for a finishing touch once the pie is baked. Sprinkle 4 crushed graham crackers over the top of the marshmallow. Roll out your second pie crust and gently place it over the top. Crimp the edges together, discarding any scraps (or using them to decorate the pie, dealer's choice). Pull the dough slightly inward, away from the edges of the baking sheet, to make it easier to cut later.",
      "Use a fork to make a pattern in the top of the pie, like a traditional Pop-Tart. Beat together your egg and water and brush the top of the pie with it. Place the pie in the oven, then reduce the heat to 375\u00b0 F. Bake for 50 to 60 minutes, until golden brown and shiny on top. Remove from the oven and allow to cool completely.",
      "Spread the marshmallow fluff all over the top of the pie and decorate with any leftover mini marshmallows. Use a kitchen torch to brulee your topping, then slice, serve, and enjoy!"

Cook the roux, while whisking continuously for about 5 minutes. Slowly add the milk, whisking to avoid any lumps. Bring the sauce to a simmer, then reduce the heat to low.",
      "Add the cream cheese, and let it melt completey. Slowly add the shredded cheese, stirring as you drop it in, letting it melt. When the cheese has totally melted, add the paprika and the parsley.",
      "Add 1/2 teaspoon of salt and a pinch of pepper, then taste it to see if it needs some more. The key to cheese sauces is salt. If it tastes bland to you, try adding a little more salt. Taste, and add, then taste again. Adding the salt little by little will help you get the flavor just right.",
      "Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large frying pan over medium heat. Add the onion, and the remaining garlic to the pan. Cook until the onions clear. Raise the heat to medium-high or high, then add about 1/3 of the spinach. Use a pair of tongs to toss the spinach in the pan. When it wilts, add another 1/3 of the spinach, and repeat until all the spinach is cooked.",
      "You can serve the pasta with the toppings and sauce over it, or you can mix all of the ingredients together in a big pot. It will taste great either way, so the choice is up to you. I find that the dish looks prettier when the sauce is draped over the noodles, and the spinach and tomatoes are plopped on top. However, mixing it all together has a much more hearty, classic mac n' cheese feel to it, so without considering looks, I prefer it that way."

If you don't have almond flour, I would imagine that just about any other flour will work, though I have not tried this recipe using another flour, so results may vary. Let me know in the comments below if you do make a substitution!"

      "Grease the springform with butter or cooking spray.",
      "Set the springform in a slow cooker liner to prevent water leakage. Alternatively, you can prepare the traditional way and wrap it in two pieces of aluminum foil.",
      "Mix melted butter this into the graham cracker crumbs. The mixture should look like wet sand and hold together in a clump when you press it in your fist. Use a glass to press the crumbs evenly on the bottom of the pan and up the sides.",
      "Place the crust in the oven (be careful not to tear the foil if using). Bake for 8 to 10 minutes until the crust is fragrant and just starting to brown around the edges. Let the crust cool on a cooling rack while you prepare the filling.",
      "Combine frozen unsweetened cherries, sugar and 1/4 cup water in a medium saucepan and bring to a boil over medium heat until defrosted and sugar melts. Stir often to prevent burning.",
      "Combine 1 tsp of zest from the lemon, lemon juice, and the cornstarch in a small bowl. Add the slurry to the cherries and bring to a boil. Cook this until it is thickened to your liking. Remove it from heat and allow to come to room temperature before putting it on your cheesecake",
      "Combine the warmed cream cheese, sugar, cornstarch, and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment (or use a handheld mixer). Mix on medium-low speed until the mixture is creamy, like thick frosting, and no lumps of cream cheese remain. Scrape down the beater and the sides of the bowl with a spatula.",
      "Add the yogurt, lemon juice, and vanilla to the bowl and beat on medium-low speed until combined and creamy. Scrape down the beater and sides of the bowl with a spatula.",
      "Mix in the eggs and yolk one at a time. Wait until the previous egg is completely mixed into the batter before adding the next one. Scrape the sides and make sure there are no clumps.",
      "Pour the batter over the cooled crust and spread it into an even layer against the sides of the pan.",
      "Transfer the pan to a roasting pan or other baking dish big enough to hold it. Bring a few cups of water to a boil and pour the water into the roasting pan, being careful not to splash any water onto the cheesecake. Fill the pan to about an inch, or just below the lowest edge of foil.",
      "Bake the cheesecake: Bake the cheesecake at 350\u00b0F for 50 to 60 minutes. This is usually closer to 50 minutes, and the temperature should be about 150 degrees F. The inner center should still look jiggly. Some spots of toasted golden color are fine, but if you see any cracks starting to form, move on to the next step right away.",
      "Turn off the oven and crack the door open. Let the cheesecake cool slowly for one hour.",
      "After an hour, remove the cheesecake from the oven and from the water bath, unwrap the foil, and transfer it to a cooling rack. Run a thin-bladed knife around the edge of the cake to make sure it's not sticking to the sides (which can cause cracks as it cools). Let the cheesecake cool completely on the rack.",
      "Chill the cheesecake for four hours in the refrigerator: Chill the cheesecake, uncovered, for at least four hours or up to three days in the refrigerator.",
      "Take the cheesecake out of the fridge about 30 minutes before you plan to serve. Unmold the cake and top the cheesecake just before serving. You can serve the cake right from the bottom of the springform pan, or use a large off-set spatula to gently unstick the crust from the pan and transfer it to a serving platter. Leftovers will keep, uncovered and refrigerated, for several days. Visit The Kitchn.com for more tips, hints, and information on the original version of this recipe."

Then use tongs to transfer the pasta to the bowl (but don't drain the water from the pot). Set the bowl back over the pot of boiling water-like a double boiler!-and use tongs to coat the pasta in the egg-cheese mixture, until eggs thicken and leave a trail in their wake. Add a bit more pasta water by the tablespoon if you need to. The cheese will stay a bit clumpy-don't worry. Add the mushrooms and their oil and toss to combine.",

Fill one layer of the storage vessel with cut membrillo, top with another layer of parchment and continue filling in this manner until all of the membrillo is cut. \r\nStore in the refrigerator for months.

Then, add another crumbled meringue, some chocolate sauce and then add a layer of orange supremes, with a spoonful of poaching liquid. Then, add another layer of whipped cream. Repeat the process as you choose, but make sure you have 2 layers of orange supremes. Top with whipped cream, and then add toasted coconut, and finally some orange zest. After the first bite, the mess begins!",
      "Cook's Note: For the less messy nest, place a tablespoon of the chocolate sauce in the center of a dessert plate, and swirl it around the plate. Firmly place the meringue nest atop the pool of sauce. Pour another spoon of sauce in the nest, followed by a tablespoon of whipped cream. Then, add 4 or 5 orange supremes, and spoon a tablespoon of poaching liquid atop the supremes, and a few drops around the plate. Top supremes with another dollop of whipped cream, and crown with the toasted coconut and a few bits of orange zest."

Do not use dried Spanish chorizo cantimpalo, as its flavor is too strong for this dish. Also avoid Mexican chorizo, which has a crumbly texture that will fall apart when stir-fried. If you cannot find chorizo, use smoked kielbasa or Georgia sausage. Sachaculantro is the Peruvian term for saw-tooth coriander, which is also known as culantro or recao in different parts of Latin America.

Slice it crosswise (i.e. from the apple's \"top,\" where the stem was, to its \"bottom\") into scant 1/8-inch slices, keeping the slices together in the shape of the apple half. Transfer the slices to a saucer, pushing on the top to fan them only slightly. Sprinkle with 1 1/2 teaspoons of the sugar. Cover loosely with a square of wax or parchment paper, tucking the ends under the dish. Microwave on high for 1 minute (my microwave is 800 watts use; 45 seconds if your microwave is more powerful). Set the saucer aside and let the apples cool and reabsorb most of its juice undisturbed. Meanwhile prepare and cook the other apples one at a time, always reserving the peels. Cool all of the apples on the saucers they were baked in.",
      "To do this in an oven rather than a microwave, preheated the oven to 350\u00b0 F. Put the sliced apple halves, still together in the shape of half an apple, in a baking pan. Sprinkle 4 to 5 tablespoons sugar over them and 2 tablespoons of rum, if you like. Cover with foil and bake 20 minutes. Uncover and baste apples with their juices. Cook uncovered for 10 to 20 more minutes or until tender when pierced with a fork. Cool completely before forming roses.",

Wrap one or two adjacent slices partially around the bud to resemble the inner petals of the rose. Continue to arrange the adjacent slices, working from the center outward, until the apple looks like an open garden rose lying in the saucer! You can cover and refrigerate the roses up to 4 days before serving them.",

You should have about 1/4 cup of glaze. Discard solids. Set the glaze aside until needed.",
      "To assemble tartlets, spread a little apple butter, jam, or pastry cream in each tart shell. Slide a metal spatula under a rose and transfer it to a tartlet crust. Repeat with the remaining roses. Reheat the glaze and brush it on the apples to give them a little shine."

Add the hot milk while whisking ,and the mixture should immediately leave the sides of the pan, clump in the middle, and be very very thick. The mixture should be smooth(no lumps of flour.)

Over the saucepan of beschamel, add the tuna while shredding finely with your fingers. Blend thoroughly and adjust seasoning as needed. The goal is a well blended,smooth creamy mixture, not a chunky one, and with a bright lemon flavor (enough so that it won't need more later) spiked by pepper. If the mixture is cooled and set up already, you can proceed to make the croquetas. Otherwise, spread mixture into any spray-oiled 8-9\" square pan; cover and refrigerate a few hours or overnight (or a few days) to set up.",

Now roll them all: fold each square lightly in half , and roll in the palms of your hands briefly til you have a smooth 2 1/2\" long x 1\" Wide, square ended barrel . To get the proper and equal size, I usually end up with only 15. Place them in a shallow oiled pan with edges.",
      "Place the panko in a container that has a tight fitting lid. With one hand, place 2 or 3 croquetas at a time into the bowl of well beaten egg. With that same hand, grasp each by its end and flip it lengthwise, rolling them around in the egg. Then place 2 or 3 in the panko.",
      "With the other hand, snap on the container lid and gently shake the container to coat the croquetas with panko. With that same other hand, remove them and place them back on the same sheet pan. When all are done, refrigerate 1 hour (or up to 1 day, covered) to set the coating. They should be firm, not limp or squishy .",
      "In a medium size saucepan or fryer, heat a 3-4\" depth of oil to 370 degrees F. Carefully lower in the croquetas. Depending on the size of your pan, fry about 4-5 croquetas at a time (do not crowd them) for about 5 minutes til medium dark brown. Stir gently after 2-3 minutes to assure their not sticking on the bottom. To test for doneness, remove a croqueta and insert a metal skewer tip into the middle. Upon removal, if the skewer tip is hot, the middle of the croqueta is as well. Drain on rack over thick newspapers .\r\n**For some odd reason, these do not hold together when kept for a few days, waiting to be fried. So fry them all after the coating has set up, at which point they can be kept warm or reheated- in a 250 defree F oven. - While I typically squeeze lemon juice on anything fried, these should need no lemon juice or any sauce!\r\n- These would make fine hors d'oeuvre if formed into 1 1/2\" balls.",
      "*Panko is readily found in supermarkets and Asian food stores. For frying, it is hugely superior to bread crumbs because its texture and airiness creates a much crisper crunchier coating.\r\n** Fresh oil is necessary for a clean fried taste. I use about 4 1/2 cups of oil to fry one batch of croquetas. I then filter the cooled oil through a fine sieve and discard the debris from the sieve and the pan. If the oil retains a golden color(unlikely), I may add a bit of new oil to it and use it for one more batch of croquetas, but then I discard that oil after that second batch."

It should look like a silver ball of sorts when done. Place the bird again breast side down into your roasting pan rack.",
      "Place the bird in the oven for 30 minutes only... then turn the oven down to 200 degrees for one hour.",
      "After one hour at 200 degrees, remove the turkey from the oven and open the foil and parchment. Flip the bird over and tightly close up the parchment and foil again. Return to the oven at 200 degrees and roast for another hour.",
      "After this next hour, you should be especially aware of the internal temperature before finishing the bird in the oven. Measure the temperature by piercing deep into the thigh. Look for a final temperature of 142-148 degrees. (148-160 for more doneness)",
      "Remove the bird after the two hours at 200 degrees and remove the parchment and foil allowing the juices to pool in the roasting pan. Crank the oven up to 375 (425 for non convection) and return the bird (breast side up again) to the oven until well browned and cooked to your desired cooking temp of 142-148. Expect a touch of pink near the joints for these temps but if you prefer a less moist bird you can cook it further. See above.",
      "Note: USDA recommends 180 for poultry, sadly this will result in the dried out birds of our childhoods...",
      "Once the bird has reached temp remove and place the turkey on a wood cutting board or platter to rest for one hour! Don't forget to tip the bird in the roasting pan, you want to make sure to get all of those juices out for gravy... Resting for an hour will allow all the juices to disperse back into the flesh and give you the perfect crown jewel of the table this holiday, so don't skip. If you can keep the bird in a warm area while resting (90-105 degrees) it's best but if not tent it lightly with foil.",
      "To Carve the Bird...\r\nMake a cut along the middle of the breast bone, let your knife slice just the side of the bone releasing the breast from the carcass. remove the entire breast and slice on the bias, plating on the platter. Repeat on the other side. Remove the legs using the tip of your knife to release it from the joint. Remove the wings and any under meat if you like or save those parts for left overs.",

      "Set the roasting pan directly over medium high heat on your stove.",
      "Add the white wine to the pan, careful it will sizzle and pop. Scrape the pan with a wooden spoon while the wine is sizzling, this will deglaze the pan releasing all the little bits into the liquid.",
      "Add the shallots and thyme, keep scrapping and stirring for 5-6 minutes...",
      "Place the sauce pot on a medium-high heat burner. Once hot add the flour and stir until well combined and the flour is smooth.",
      "Continue to stir briskly while slowly adding the wine and shallots mixture. Add in 1/2 cup increments the potato water to achieve the desired consistency. Keep in mind you may need to adjust the temperature to keep the gravy gently bubbling.",
      "Let the gravy simmer for about 10 minutes before tasting and seasoning with salt and pepper.",
      "The gravy will thicken when cooled at the table but adjust thickness with flour or water for thicker or thinner gravy.",
      "Serve alongside of your perfectly roasted turkey and don't blame me (or Chef Sullivan) if your guests are not much for conversation, they will be too busy enjoying your turkey!"

Then, add the second half of the butter mixture, toss to coat, and cut this in -- the second time around, I like to press the cubes into flat sheets, which helps to make the crust flaky.

The thickness is your choice - don't make them so thin the cookies crack when you spread them with dulce, but remember in the end you're making a sandwich. I usually roll mine out to an 1/8+ of an inch, but don't actually measure them out! The size of the cookie is to your taste as well. I prefer mine smallish, the size of a champagne flute. Re-form and re-roll out the scraps until you find the dough is tough and brittle, at which point cut your losses and toss (or eat?!) the rest.",

Spread the golden bottom of one cookie with dulce de leche, add a second cookie, golden side towards the dulce, to form a sandwich. Be gentle! The cookies tend to crack under pressure. Smooth a little dulce around the perimeter, and roll the edge of the cookie sandwich in coconut.",
      "NB: A note about dulce de leche. The best dulce de leche is made from scratch - milk, sugar and patience. A semi-homemade alternative is to cook condensed milk in a double boiler for three hours or so, making sure the water doesn't fully evaporate, and stirring every so often, until the dulce is a rich caramel color but is still thin enough to spread easily. Or, if you have a pressure cooker, look up the technique for that - will save you time and hours standing at the stove. If you're using store bought dulce, steer clear of nestle, you're better off using condensed milk, flavor wise! I've had luck tracking down 'Conaprole' & 'Manfrey' in the US."
