      "Heat a large, heavy saucepan over medium heat, add olive and butter. Wait until the butter is fully melted into the oil and the foam has subsided, then add the turkey sausage and ground turkey. Saute, chopping it all together into a mix of chunks and bits, until cooked and light golden brown. Remove to a plate, and add the chopped bell peppers, chopped onion, mushrooms. Saute until they start to soften, then add the minced garlic, salt and pepper, and saute everything together until the bell peppers are soft and tender, and the onion is translucent, scraping any bits off the bottom of the pan. Add the rice, and stir to coat, keep cooking until the rice is toasty and golden. Add the turkey sausage and ground turkey back into the pan, turn up the heat, and add all the wine, scraping the bottom of the pan, and letting it reduce until almost dry. Lower the heat to medium low and start adding the broth, about 1 cup at a time *You may not use all of it*, stirring then letting it reduce until the vegetable, rice and turkey mixture is almost dry again. Continue to add the broth, 1 cup at time, until the rice is tender to the bite, and has a creamy consistency. This could take anywhere from 20 to 30 minutes. When you're satisfied with the texture of the rice, if you have any chicken broth left, add it, and let it cook down for only 1 minute so it's still slightly soupy, then add the butter and grated parmesan cheese. Stir to combine, until very creamy. Top with chopped chives and parsley and sprinkle with some extra parmesan cheese. Serve immediately, in the pan (like I do) or in a bowl or dish."

Cut the meat into 1-inch (2.5-cm) cubes. Place them on a baking sheet and freeze until they are semisolid, about 1 hour. In batches, process the meat in a food processor until it is coarsely chopped. (If you are lucky to live near an artisan butcher, ask them to bone and grind the beef shank meat with the coarse \"chili\" blade.)",
      "2. Mix the guajillo chile, vinegar, chile de arbol, salt, oregano, cumin, and cloves together in a nonreactive medium bowl. Add the beef and mix well. Cover tightly and refrigerate for at least 12 and up to 24 hours.",
      "3. Prepare the beans: Put the beans in a large bowl and add enough cold water to cover by at least 3 inches (7.5 cm). Let them stand in a cool place (refrigerate if the kitchen is warm) for at least 12 and up to 16 hours.",
      "4. Drain the beans, put them in a large saucepan, and add enough fresh cold water to cover by 3 inches (7.5 cm). Heat them, stirring often, over medium-high heat just until the water boils. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer until the beans are barely tender, about 1 1/2 hours, depending on the freshness of the beans. During the last 30 minutes, add the salt to the saucepan. Drain the beans and set them aside.",
      "5. Make the chili: Meanwhile, heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a heavy Dutch oven over medium-high heat. In 2 or 3 batches, add the marinated beef and cook, stirring often, until it is seared, about 5 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the beef to a bowl, leaving the fat in the pot.",
      "6. Pulse the onions and garlic together in a food processor until finely chopped but not pureed. (Or mince the onions and garlic by hand.) Add the remaining 1 tablespoon oil to the Dutch oven and heat. Add the onion mixture and cook, stirring often, until the onions are softened, about 5 minutes.",
      "7. Return the beef to the Dutch oven. Add the tomato puree, chile flakes, oregano, thyme, and cumin and stir well. Reduce the heat to medium-low. Simmer, uncovered, for about 2 1/2 hours, until the meat is very tender and the tomato juices thicken. Add hot water to the chili if it threatens to stick to the pot, and stir in the beans during the last hour. Season with salt and more Urfa chile flakes. If you like very spicy chili, add more ground chile de arbol. (The chili can be cooled, covered, and refrigerated for up to 2 days.) Spoon it into bowls and serve hot."

Scatter the 1/4-inch-size pieces of chilled fat over the flour and work in by rubbing fingers with the fat and flour as if snapping thumb and fingers together (or use two forks or knives, or a pastry cutter) until the mixture looks like well-crumbled feta cheese. Scatter the 1/2-inch-size pieces of chilled fat over the flour mixture and continue snapping thumb and fingers together until no pieces remain larger than a pea. Shake the bowl occasionally to allow the larger pieces of fat to bounce to the top of the flour, revealing the largest lumps that still need rubbing. If this method took longer than 5 minutes, place the bowl in the refrigerator for 5 minutes to rechill the fat.",
      "Make a deep hollow in the center of the flour with the back of your hand. Pour 3/4 cup of the buttermilk into the hollow, reserving 1/4 cup buttermilk, and stir with a rubber spatula or large metal spoon, using broad circular strokes to quickly pull the flour into the liquid. Mix just until the dry ingredients are moistened and the sticky dough begins to pull away from the sides of the bowl. If there is some flour remaining on the bottom and sides of the bowl, stir in 1 to 4 tablespoons of reserved milk, just enough to incorporate the remaining flour into the shaggy wettish dough. If the dough is too wet, use more flour when shaping.",
      "Lightly sprinkle a board or other clean surface using some of the reserved flour. Turn the dough out onto the board and sprinkle the top lightly with flour. With floured hands, fold the dough in half, and pat dough out into a 1/3- to 1/2-inch-thick round, using a little additional flour only if needed. Flour again if necessary, and fold the dough in half a second time. If the dough is still clumpy, pat and fold a third time. Pat dough out into a 1/2-inch-thick round for a normal biscuit, 3/4-inch-thick for a tall biscuit, and 1-inch-thick for a giant biscuit. Brush off any visible flour from the top. For each biscuit, dip a 2 1/2-inch biscuit cutter into the reserved flour and cut out the biscuits, starting at the outside edge and cutting very close together, being careful not to twist the cutter. The scraps may be combined to make additional biscuits, although these scraps make tougher biscuits. Toss the blueberries with the ginger. Push 6 blueberries into each biscuit round; don't allow the blueberries to touch each other.",
      "To skillet-fry, heat an iron skillet until hot and add the melted butter. Using a metal spatula, move the biscuits to the skillet. Cook 2 minutes or until lightly browned on the bottom. Turn the biscuits over with the spatula and cook an additional 2 minutes. Remove to a plate and sprinkle with confectioners' sugar if desired.",
      "To bake, preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Move the biscuits to a greased cake pan and bake them on the top rack of the oven for a total of 10 to 14 minutes until light golden brown. After 6 minutes, rotate the pan in the oven so that the front of the pan is now turned to the back, and check to see if the bottoms are browning too quickly. If so, slide another baking pan underneath to add insulation and retard browning. Continue baking another 4 to 8 minutes until the biscuits are light golden brown. When the biscuits are done, remove from the oven and lightly brush the tops with softened or melted butter. Turn the biscuits out upside down on a plate to cool slightly. Serve hot, right side up, and sprinkle with confectioners' sugar if desired.",
      "Peaches, raspberries, blackberries, and other soft fruits (cut blueberry-sized if necessary) do beautifully in this recipe as well. Candied ginger or cinnamon are happy in the biscuits as well.",
      "Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a 10-inch skillet over low heat. Evenly distribute 1 teaspoon granulated sugar and 1/2 of a sliced green onion. Pat biscuits into the skillet, overlapping the biscuits slightly. Sprinkle with more sliced green onion. Cover skillet and cook 5 minutes over medium heat. Turn biscuits over with a pancake turner. Add 2 more tablespoons butter. Cover and cook 5 minutes longer. Serve warm."

Coat the top of the crescent rolls with a thin layer of preserves and top with a handfull of pecans. Press them into the rolls a little bit. Put in the oven. Bake at 350 degrees for approx. 30 minutes. Keep on checking to make sure the rolls don't burn, but make sure that the brie has melted inside. If you see the top browning too much just put a piece of tin foil on top and secure it so it doesn't burn. Put 2 spoons in so your company can either put some on a plate and eat it or serve with crackers and enjoy!"

      "To make the pastry, place the flour, ground nuts, icing sugar and salt in a food processor and pulse to combine. Add the butter and vanilla bean paste and blitz until it forms fine crumbs. Add the egg yolk and pulse until the pastry comes together, adding the tsp of ice water if needed; do not overmix. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead very lightly just until it is smooth; form into a thick log, wrap in clingfilm and refrigerate for at least an hour.",
      "Slice the chilled log into 6 even pieces, roll each one out on a lightly floured surface until it is large enough to line an 8-10cm deep tart tin. Line the tins, pressing the pastry right into the corners and leaving any excess pastry overhanging. Place the tins on a baking tray then chill in the fridge for 30 mins or so.",
      "Meanwhile, heat the oven to 350F. Line each tart case with a piece of baking parchment and fill with baking beans or dried rice, making sure that it goes right into the corners. Bake for 15 minutes then remove the baking beans and parchment and return the tarts to the oven for a further 10 minutes or until the pastry is golden and baked through.",
      "Leave the tarts to cool a little in the tins then carefully trim off the excess pastry with a very sharp serrated knife. Remove the tarts from the tins and set aside.",
      "For the hazelnut salted caramel layer, place the hazelnuts on a baking tray and toast in the oven for about 10 minutes until the skins have darkened and the nuts are golden. Tip them out onto a clean teatowel and rub them vigorously with the towel, the skins should flake off but don't worry if you can't get rid of all of the skin. Roughly chop the nuts and set aside.",
      "Place the sugar and water in a deep, wide, heavy bottomed saucepan. Heat, swirling the pan (don't stir it), until the sugar has melted and turned a rich golden brown; meanwhile, heat the cream, butter and salt together in a small pan until hot but not boiling. As soon as the sugar has turned golden, quickly remove it from the heat and pour in the cream, it will bubble up violently so be careful.",
      "Once the bubbling has subsided, stir until smooth; you may need to return the pan to a low heat for a couple of minutes if there are any lumps of caramel. Set aside one third of the caramel for drizzling over the finished tarts and stir the chopped nuts into the rest. Allow to cool a little then divide it between the tart cases and place them in the fridge until the caramel has set.",
      "For the chocolate crunch layer, melt the chocolate in a bowl set over a pan of gently simmering water (don't let the base of the bowl touch the water), or in short bursts in the microwave. Stir in the crushed waffle cones or feuilletine until they are fully coated in chocolate. Divide the mixture between the tarts, spreading it out into an even layer, return to the fridge until set.",
      "To make the chocolate cremeux, place the chocolate in a heatproof bowl. Put the milk, cream and vanilla in a saucepan and bring to the boil. Meanwhile, whisk together the egg yolks and sugar until pale. Gradually pour the hot cream mixture into the egg yolks, whisking constantly so that the yolks don't curdle.",
      "Return the pan to a low heat and stir constantly until it coats the back of a spoon (180-183F). Pour the mixture through a fine mesh sieve onto the chocolate, mix until smooth then add the butter and stir until melted.",
      "At this point you can either allow the cremeux to cool then pour some onto each tart while it is still fairly runny and spread until it is smooth, or you can do as I did and place it in the fridge until it has become firm enough to pipe (keep an eye on it, you don't want it to become too firm) then transfer it to a piping bag fitted with a large, plain nozzle and pipe dollops of it on top of each tart.",
      "Allow the tarts to come up to room temperature before serving, then dust with a little cocoa powder and drizzle with the remaining salted caramel sauce."

      "2. Start mincing that garlic and chopping those veggies. Remember to keep things separate.",
      "3. I've developed a decent order for the veggies, probably best to do the mushrooms and the carrots, celery, red peppers first, then the more delicate veggies like onions and the peas. Remember, except for the mushrooms, the goal is to keep the veggies crisp. For each group use a medium high heat; melt some butter and olive oil then drop in some garlic (best smell in the world, sauteing garlic) and ginger. When the garlic is really fragrant, throw in the veggies. The carrots, celery, red peppers can go in one. Mushrooms in their own pan on a medium heat. Do the onions separate; they need a little less time. Sugar snaps and snow peas take an even shorter amount of time, keep them bright green if you can. As the veggies finish, you can spread them into the pot or you can stir them all together before pouring them in. However, save the bean sprouts for last, cook them a very short time, maybe 2 minutes and spread on top of the veggies.",
      "4. For the water chestnuts and bamboo shoots, I use a medium heat then I toast them in the sesame oil, get them a little browned. Spread them on top of the veggies.",
      "5.\tDo the shrimp and scallops separately. Medium heat; butter and olive oil; then 1/4 head minced garlic for each until the garlic gets really fragrant before it starts to burn. Dump in the meat and sprinkle liberally with sesame seeds. There should be a bunch of liquid in the frying pan when done. I just pour that over the whole thing so the seafood juice permeates through the veggies and rice."
