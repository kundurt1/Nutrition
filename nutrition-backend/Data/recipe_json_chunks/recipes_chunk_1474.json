With a slotted spoon, transfer fries to a baking pan lined with paper towels. Allow oil to return to 325\u00b0 and repeat with remaining potatoes, arranging them in a single layer (you'll need a second baking pan). Let cool completely, about 15 minutes.

      "Make the Shortbread: In a medium bowl, mix the flour with the cornmeal and salt. In a standing mixer fitted with the paddle, mix the butter with the confectioners' sugar at medium speed until creamy, about 2 minutes. Beat in the orange zest and vanilla extract. Add the flour mixture and beat at low speed until the dough just comes together. Pat the shortbread dough into a disk, wrap in plastic and refrigerate for 1 hour.",
      "Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0. Line 2 large rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper. Unwrap the chilled shortbread dough and roll it out between 2 sheets of parchment paper to an 8-inch round (1/2 inch thick). Cut the dough into 1/2-inch-wide strips and transfer the strips to the baking sheets; leave 1 inch between each strip. Refrigerate the dough strips for 30 minutes, until chilled.",
      "Bake the shortbread for about 20 minutes, until golden; rotate the pans halfway through for even baking. While the warm shortbread strips are still on the baking sheet, cut them into 1/2-inch cubes. Let cool, about 30 minutes.",
      "Make the Blueberry Compote: In a small saucepan, combine 1 cup of the blueberries with the sugar and water. Bring to a simmer and cook over moderate heat until the blueberries break down, about 5 minutes. Scrape the blueberry sauce into a blender, add the lemon juice and puree until smooth. Scrape the blueberry sauce into a bowl and fold in the remaining 1 cup of whole blueberries. Refrigerate until chilled, about 2 hours.",
      "Meanwhile, Make the Cheesecake Custard: In a medium saucepan, bring 3/4 cup of the milk to a boil with 3 tablespoons of the sugar; remove from the heat. In a medium bowl, whisk the egg yolks with the cornstarch and the remaining 1/4 cup of milk and 2 tablespoons of sugar. Gradually whisk the hot milk into the egg yolks, then pour the mixture into the saucepan and whisk constantly over moderate heat until thickened, about 2 minutes. Over low heat, whisk in the cream cheese, lemon juice, grated lemon zest and vanilla extract until smooth, about 1 minute. Scrape the cheesecake custard into a bowl. Press a piece of plastic wrap directly onto the surface of the custard and refrigerate until chilled, about 2 hours.",
      "In a medium bowl, using an electric mixer, beat the cream to medium peaks. Fold the whipped cream into the chilled cheesecake custard until no streaks remain. Spoon the shortbread cubes and custard into bowls. Drizzle with the blueberry compote, garnish with the lemon zest strips and serve."

      "Chicago's Brian Duncan, wine director at downtown Chicago's BIN 36 Restaurant, Wine Bar, and Market and BIN 36 Lincolnshire, brings an innovative touch to the Windy City's dining scene. Brian's wish to demystify wine for the consumer results in the restaurant's creative, approachable list of 50 wines by the glass and almost 400 by the bottle. Working closely with California winemakers, Brian created BIN 36 Brian's Blends--a collection of 12 (and counting) wine blends--to pair with food or enjoy on their own. Here, Brian selects wines to accompany this Asian-inspired dish.",
      "\"My pick here is the Clos La Chance El Dorado County Zinfandel ($15). This elegantly styled Zinfandel manages to support sweet and sour flavors in the dish. Ripe, red Zinfandel is a fantastic foil for the saltiness of the soy sauce in this recipe and the sweetness of the teriyaki sauce.\""

      "Using a stand mixer (or a food processor), combine all the dry ingredients. Cut the butter into little pieces, about 1/2 inch thick, and drop the pieces into the dry ingredients. Turn on the mixer again and mix on low speed until the butter has crumbled into pea-size pieces.",
      "Drop in the egg and apple cider vinegar as the mixer is running. Once they are incorporated, slowly drizzle the ice-cold water into the mixture, a little at a time, while the mixer is running. When the mixture coheres and looks like dough, turn off the mixer.",
      "At this point, drop the ball of dough onto a large piece of parchment paper. (Prepare this ahead, unless you want to wipe dough off the box of parchment paper later!) Place another piece of parchment paper, the same size, on top of the dough. Gently, smoosh the dough outward, equally in all directions, until it is a thick, round cake of dough. Refrigerate the dough for as long as you can. Ideally, you should prepare the dough in the evening and refrigerate overnight. Take the dough out of the refrigerator at least 20 minutes before you want to work with it.",
      "Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.",
      "Leave the dough in the parchment paper sandwich and roll it out. By rolling it, gently, between the pieces of parchment paper, you will not need to add more flour to the mix. Roll it out to the size of the pie plate, then strip the top piece of parchment paper off the dough. Carefully, flip the dough into the pie plate. Using your fingers, gently press the dough outward, evenly, until you have extended it beyond the edges of the pie plate. You can crimp the edges at this point. If some of the dough falls off the sides, don't worry. Simply reattach the pieces to the crust-to-be by pressing in with your fingers. (Gluten-free pie crust is fragile, but it is also forgiving in the baking.)",
      "Fill the pie crust with the",
      ". Carefully cover the apple filling with another layer of pie crust. Pinch the edges to seal in the apples. Cut a small slit in the top crust to allow the steam from the cooking apples to escape. Put the pie in the oven. Bake for 15 minutes. Lower the oven's temperature to 350 degrees F and bake the pie for another 30 minutes. Check the pie sporadically to make sure the top is not browning too much. (If it is, cover the pie with some tin foil for the remaining baking time.)",
      "The pie is done when you can insert a knife into the apples and have it move through them softly, when the crust is warm and golden, and when the juices from the apples are carmelizing along the edges of the crust. Take the pie out immediately when it has reached this stage. Cool for 20 minutes, then dig in."

Small, whole new potatoes are at their best cooked in their pink jackets. If peeled, potatoes will darken quickly. Cook immediately or place them in lightly salted cold water to prevent darkening. For deep-fried potatoes, ice the water; drain and dry thoroughly before frying.",

      "Cut a slit in the top of each baked potato. Press sides to loosen inside of potato. Add butter and seasonings to taste.",
      "Note: To yield a crispy potato skin, rub with shortening before baking. To keep potatoes hot until serving time, remove from oven, and roll up (jellyroll fashion) in a clean towel; put in a warm place.",
