      "Cake:",
      "Preheat oven 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Grease bottom and sides of 2 (9 x 1 1/2\" or 9 x 2\") round layer-cake pans. Dust with flour and shake out excess. Melt chocolate in double boiler over simmering water. Set aside to cool slightly. Drain beet juice into a small bowl. Place beets on a cutting board and chop into very small pieces. Add to beet juice and set aside.",
      "Beat butter, sugar, eggs and vanilla in a large bowl with an electric mixer on high speed until very fluffy, about 5 minutes, scraping sides occasionally. Reduce speed to low and beat in melted chocolate.",
      "Stir together flour, baking soda and salt in a medium-size bowl. With mixer on low speed, alternately beat flour in fourths and buttermilk in thirds into chocolate mixture, beginning and ending with flour. Mix until incorporated, about 1 minute. Add beets and juice and mix on medium speed until blended, about 1 minute. The batter will be thin and you will see pieces of beets.",
      "Divide the batter equally between the 2 prepared pans. Bake in the 350 degrees oven for 30 - 35 minutes or until cake tester inserted in center comes out clean and top of cake springs back when lightly pressed with fingertips. DO NOT over bake or cake will be dry. Cool cakes in pans on wire racks for 10 minutes and then invert onto racks.",
      "NOTE: If desired, cake layers may be wrapped in foil and kept at room temperature overnight, or they may be frozen. Defrost wrapped cake at room temperature before frosting.",
      "Frosting:",
      "Heat cream in a medium-size saucepan just until it comes to a boil. Remove from heat and add chocolate and vanilla, stirring until mixture is smooth and chocolate is melted. Transfer mixture into a plastic or glass bowl (metal causes the sides to get too cold and set up too quickly.) Refrigerate, stirring every 10 minutes until mixture is as thick as pudding, about 50 - 60 minutes. At this point the frosting will begin to set up very quickly. Leave in refrigerator and stir every 5 minutes until frosting is a thick as fudge, about 15 more minutes. Alternatively, the frosting may be placed over ice water and stirred constantly until spreading consistency. If it begins to get too thick, immediately remove it from the water.",
      "To assemble the cake, (make sure cake has cooled and has reached room temperature) place one cake layer top-side down on serving platter. Spread with a third of the frosting and top with second layer, bottom-side up. Spread remaining frosting over top and sides. Let stand at room temperature for frosting to set.",
      "NOTE: The frosted cake may be held at room temperature, uncovered, overnight or refrigerated up to 2 days. Bring to room temperature before serving."

      "TIPS ON FINDING RIPE FRUIT: For pineapple, the skin should be slightly yellow, firm to the touch but not hard--will give a little. And, when a leaf near the top of the fruit is tugged gently, it should easily remove from the fruit. For cantaloupe, it should be firm but give slightly, a bit yellowish on the rind--those \"veins\" are a good sign--it means they were left long enough on the ground to ripen properly. And, if you poke a fingernail in the top \"dime\" spot, you should be able to smell the fruit. If you can't smell anything, it's not ripe. Strawberries should be shiny and fragrant. Nectarines should have a slight give and be fragrant. Blueberries and blackberries should be firm and deeply colored. Kiwi fruit should be firm, but not rock hard--must have a very slight \"give\"."

Because microwaves vary so enormously in heat, if using this option, err on the side of caution and just cook the prosciutto for a minute to start with.and then perhaps for an extra 30 seconds at a time until the prosciutto is how you want it. It's too delicious to waste. Not quite as crisp as grilled, but a useful alternative. Apologies if this is a method you've known for years! It's a useful tip if you're unfamiliar with it."

Place the biscuit circles over the raspberries. Bake until the topping is golden brown and the juices have thickened, about 45-50 minutes. The biscuit top should be browned and fully cooked. Cool.

      "Put the oats and salt in a blender or a food processor with the small bowl fitted, and process until you get the consistency of flour, a mealy flour to be sure, but it should still be fine-ground.",
      "Tip into a bowl and stir in the baking powder and cinnamon.",
      "In a measuring jug, whisk together the milk, egg and vanilla, and then stir the wet mixture into the dry, until thoroughly combined. If the batter thickens too much, add more milk. And do not let this batter rest, as otherwise it will thicken too much.",
      "Pour 1/2 a teaspoon of oil onto a smooth, non-stick griddle (or large cast-iron or heavy-based frying pan) and, with a piece of kitchen roll, smear it over the whole surface. Put the griddle on a medium heat and, when hot, add the batter, using a quarter-cup measure but only filling it two-thirds full. You should get 4 pancakes at a time, and they will need around 2 minutes a side. Generally, when cooking pancakes, you turn them over when you see bubbles coming to the uppermost side, and while that still holds true, the bubbles are rather understated here. So slip a spatula underneath a pancake after 2 minutes to see if the underside looks cooked, and then when it is, flip it, and the rest of the pancakes, over and cook for another 2 minutes. As always, do not press down on the pancakes as they cook, and do not flip them more than once. When you've cooked the first 4, pile them on a plate, and cover with a clean tea towel, then oil the pan again and proceed as before.",
      "Serve immediately - the oats carry on drinking up liquid, and the pancakes will dry on standing - with the warm raspberry honey poured on top."

    "title": "earth oven roast pig",
    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "Additional Items you will need: canvas tarp (make sure it's big enough to anchor the tarp around the edge of the hole,) charcoal briquettes, one cord of wood, 40 cantaloupe-sized rocks (preferably lava rocks, but river rocks will work,) chicken wire, 30 or so green banana leaves, very sharp knives, 20 wet burlap bags, a metal chimney (I a 3 foot length of 6 inch diameter aluminum pipe,) green corn husks (cabbage or seaweed will work and you'll need quite a bit).",
      "You'll also need shovels to dig the pit, and some lengths of rope to lower the pig, and remove it. I used carabiners on the end of the rope.",
      "The first, and hardest part, is to dig the pit. For a 200 pound hog we dig a pit that is 5 feet by 7 feet and 3 feet deep. The dimensions will vary depending on the size of the pig, but you should dig it no less than 3 feet deep. Square walls help in lowering the pig and removing it.",
      "Once the hole is finished, place your chimney in the center and fill the hole with your wood. I recommend having a full cord of wood on hand, again depending on the size of your pig and pit, but it's a good idea to overestimate. The wood should completely fill the hole and pile up about 2 feet above the hole. On top of the wood, evenly space your rocks. You should have enough rocks so that when the wood burns down you'll have completely covered the bottom of the pit with hot rocks.",
      "Next, drop 10-15 charcoal briquettes down the chimney. To the briquettes, add a whole can of charcoal lighter fluid. Ignite the lighter fluid and get the charcoal going. The safest way to do this is to take a piece of newspaper or a brown paper bag, roll it up, put a bit of the lighter fluid on it, and drop it down the chimney. You can remove the chimney when you know the fire is going well, but we use aluminum pieces that simply burn away with the intense heat. Once your fire is going, it's time to prepare the hog.",
      "Score the skin and rub in salt and spices. Pig skin is notoriously tough, so you'll need extremely sharp knives and with a larger pig, you'll probably have to sharpen them as you go. I frequently use box cutters with razors. The onions and pineapples can be placed inside the hog. You can also inject your favorite marinade into the meat at this point.",
      "Now you need to wait for the fire to burn down. This can be a dangerous point of the project if you're using river rocks. Bubbles and moisture inside the rocks will expand with heat, and the rocks can (and probably will) explode and crack. You can minimize the problem by placing chicken wire over the fire which will keep pieces from flying all over the place. Once the rocks heat up enough, they'll stop cracking and it will be safe.",
      "Once the fire has burned down, you'll need to place a couple of the hot rocks inside the cavity of the pig. We use a post-hole digger to pick up the rocks. You can use heat resistant gloves but you'll likely ruin them. These rocks are HOT!. Place enough inside the pig to fill most of the cavity.",
      "Wrap the pig first in the green banana leaves, then in chicken wire. The leaves will prevent the pig from charring, and any parts left uncovered will burn. The chicken wire will help keep the pig together while it's cooking and will aid in placing the pig in the pit and removing it when it's done.",
      "Now you're going to make a bed of corn husks on top of the hot rocks. I mentioned earlier that you can use seaweed or cabbage for this. I have used both cabbage and corn husks, but seaweed is the traditional Polynesian way. Corn worked great, as did cabbage, though the cabbage was FAR smellier as it cooked. I think the corn husks impart a sweet flavor to the meat, so that's my preferred method.",
      "Lower your wrapped pig onto the bed of corn husks.",
      "Thoroughly soak the burlap bags in water, then place them over the pig, covering the entire pig. These will create a type of lid over the pig keeping the heat inches.",
      "Cover the pit with the canvas tarp, anchor the edges and corners, then moisten the tarp thoroughly. Use the dirt from the hole to cover the tarp completely, starting with the edges to prevent the tarp from slipping in on the pig. Once you've covered the tarp in dirt, soak the dirt and relax. You will need to occasionally moisten the dirt. There's no time schedule on this, but when the dirt starts to dry, hose it down.",
      "Your pig will be cooked in about 7 hours. Just remove the dirt, then roll back the tarp and take out the pig. At this point I find easiest to use a length of rope with a clip (carabiner) at the end. You just attach the clip to the chicken wire and pull it out. Works great!",
      "I cooked a 200# hog for my wedding. It cooked for 8 hours and was only slightly over-done. It was delicious, and the looks on peoples faces as it came out of the ground were priceless.",
      "You should not, however, underestimate the difficulties of a project like this. Hole digging is tough, and it can be difficult to find that many rocks. Allow yourself several weeks to plan, and at least a couple of days to dig the hole. This is not a last minute recipe.",
      "For proportions, count on 1 person 1 pound. So, 100 people, 100# pig."

With a spoon, scrape out the bulk of the seeds, if the eggplant is too seedy - these only tend to bitter the eggplant; be careful not to take too much of the eggplant off. Cut the halves into 1/2 inch slices, salt both sides with coarse salt and place the slices into a colander to drain for approximately 1 1/2 to 2 hours (the longer the better). You can place a heavy pan on top to quicken the draining. After draining, wash the slices in cold water and pat each slice thoroughly dry. You can omit this salting step, but the drained eggplant is of much better quality for frying and salting and draining is highly recommended.",

With a spoon, push the tomatoes under the hot water for 15-30 seconds. Remove and place the tomatoes in a bowl of ice water and let sit. When all the tomatoes have been blanched and are resting in ice water, the skins should begin to peel back. Proceed to peel the skin from the tomatoes, starting at the top where the tomato was scored. Peel with a small paring knife. Place all the peeled tomatoes in a bowl, cut into chunks and set aside.",

Remove from pan and drain on paper towels to remove excess oil. Repeat until all the eggplant is fried and drained.",
      "In a pan large enough to hold all your ingredients, saute the onions in a few tablespoons of olive oil until they are translucent, being careful not to brown them. Next add the capers, the the green pitted olives and the 1 and 1/2 cups of the marinara sauce, the Roma or plum tomatoes (optional) and continue to cook over low heat for 15-30 minutes until the mixture reduces and thickens and the Roma tomato chunks are cooked into the mixture, but still distinguishable. Stir the mixture from time to time to prevent sticking. You will need to use your judgment to determine the doneness of the mixture, but do not overcook, a little less is better. The mixture should not be dry.",
      "NOTE: You may also use one 28oz. can of whole plum shaped tomatoes, well drained, seeded and cut into medium size pieces in place of the Roma plum tomatoes above.",
      "Add the fried eggplant pieces, the sauteed celery pieces and chopped basil to the tomato mixture and continue to cook over low heat for several minutes, stirring the mixture to prevent the mixture from sticking. Do not overcook and let the mixture become too dry. It is best if it is thick and loose.",
      "When the tomato mixture appears to be absorbed into the eggplant, add the wine vinegar, stirring the hot mixture continually. A word to the wise, stand away from the pan when adding the wine vinegar to the hot mixture to prevent inhaling the vinegar vapor. Add the sugar, a bit at a time, stirring between additions to speed absorption.",
      "NOTE: I have found it best to add half the wine vinegar and the sugar. Taste to assure the correct degree of sweetness and sourness before continuing with either of these two ingredients. This is a matter of personal taste. Salt and pepper may be added to taste at this point also, but remember that several of the ingredients were soaked in brine, so be careful with the salt!",
      "Cool the caponata well before serving. The caponata may be placed into a container and refrigerated. This is one of those dishes that ages well and the taste even improves over time. It will keep for several days in a refrigerator; just stir the mixture well from time to time. I recommend cooking this dish in advance to take full advantage of these qualities. An added tip: this dish also freezes well, just place in an appropriate container and freeze, let thaw and stir before serving. Remember to always serve at room temperature.",
      "Caponata can be served as an antipasto or appetizer. It is delicious served on bruschetta or with pieces of crusty Italian bread. There should be enough to serve at least 8."
