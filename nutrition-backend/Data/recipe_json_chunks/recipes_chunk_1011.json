With hand mixer on low start to combine, this helps break up the cream cheese. Once smooth add in heavy whipping cream. Mix on low until incorporated then slowly turn up to high. Mix until light and fluffy. Pour onto pie crust and smooth. This can be topped at this point with topping or eaten plain. Is best when chilled for about an hour- if you can wait that long."

      "RECIPE OVERVIEW & NOTE: Per Chef Schwartz: The recipe is not fussy: First, stew the onions with the pumpkin (or butternut squash) until they are soft and sweet and the pumpkin is almost cooked through. The onions should be well seasoned and flavorful when taken off the heat. Next, bring the cream and stock to a simmer and slowly whisk them into a bowl with the beaten egg yolks. Then, mix it all together-bread, herbs, cheese, cream, vegetables-and pack it into ramekins. Top with pecorino (Parmesan will work, too) and bake until the centers are nearly semi-firm. Before serving, slide the panades under the broiler for a few minutes; the pecorino should brown and bubble and form a crackly crust. When tapped with a spoon, the topping will give way to sweet pumpkin, caramelized onions and melted fontina, all suspended in a pillow of warm bread.",
      "Heat oven to 325 degrees.",
      "Using 1/2 tablespoon butter, grease 4 ramekins and the dull side of 4 pieces of aluminum foil cut to cover ramekins.",
      "Set saute pan over medium heat. Swirl in oil and remaining butter. Add onions and a pinch salt. Cook, covered, until translucent, about 3 minutes.",
      "Add garlic, pumpkin and a pinch salt. Cook, covered, for 4 minutes.",
      "Uncover and cook until onions are lightly colored and pumpkin is tender, about 4 minutes more. Taste and season with salt and pepper, as needed. Discard garlic.",
      "While pumpkin cooks, toss bread, parsley, thyme and fontina in a large bowl. Stir in cooked pumpkin mixture.",
      "Return pan, without cleaning it, to medium heat. Add stock and cream or milk. While heating, whisk yolks in a small bowl. Once liquid is hot but not boiling, whisk it gradually into yolks (do not add too quickly or eggs will scramble). Pour liquid over bread mixture and toss to combine. Let rest a few minutes so most of the liquid is absorbed.",
      "Pack mixture into ramekins and top with pecorino. Cover with foil, buttered-side down.",
      "Bake, on center rack, until panades are semi-firm at their centers, about 15 minutes. Remove panades from oven and discard foil. Turn on broiler.",
      "Broil until pecorino melts and browns in spots, 3-5 minutes.",
      "Serve as a side dish or as a main course with side salad."

      "Combine all of the honey and the measured wine into a sauce pan. Cook the honey and wine mixture on very low heat, while constantly stirring with a wooden spoon. The heat should be just high enough so that the mixture begins to boil and bubbling with small bubbles after about 10 minutes being on the fire. Once the mixture starts boiling immediately remove from the fire and let it cool down until the bubbling stops. Then return back to the fire for about another 10 minutes and then remove again after boiling. This procedure of bringing to a boil and cooling should be repeated 3 times. After the 3rd time a white residue will start forming on top of the mixture. Once the white residue forms the reduction is complete. Remove it from the fire and let it completely cool for about 15 minutes. You will notice that the mixture will start to solidify back to the thick consistency of honey.",
      "While the mixture is cooling measure out 670 ml into a glass bowl.",
      "Once the honey wine mixture has cooled return it back to the fire for 2-3 minutes so that it liquefies again and becomes runny. It is not necessary to bring it to a boil at this point.",

Stir for about 5-10 minutes until the mixture is mixed throughout. The mixing of hot honey-wine mixture with the room temperature wine and spices is what allows all of the spices to infuse their flavor into the wine, so make sure you keep mixing it for at least 5 minutes.",
      "Take a single sheet of coffee filter paper, place it on top of a metal mesh strainer and place the strainer on top of a bowl.",
      "Slowly pour the final mixture into the filter. Allow the wine to drip filter through the filter into the bowl. The coffee filter should remove all particles from the mixture and only clear wine should remain. If the first filtering does not result in clear wine, repeat the filtering process again using a clean bowl and a clean coffee filter. The filtering process may take up to 1 hour depending on the quantity of wine and the thickness and size of the coffee filter.",
      "Once the wine has been filtered pour it into a glass bottle and serve.",
      "The flavor of the wine will be at first sweet with a strong flavor of honey, and then you will get a good kick of peppery spices at the end. Enjoy.",
      "Please note that I have modified this recipe from the original recipe that appears in Apicius 1.1. I removed the date mash and the date pits from the ingredients list, because they were causing the wine to be overly too sweet. I used a coffee filter for filtering the wine instead of charcoal, for convenience. Charcoal will remove more spicy flavor from the wine. I might post another version with the charcoal later and report on how the flavor has changed. And I have mixed honey wine mixture with the spices right after cooking the mixture while it was hot, instead of letting it sit for 24 hours and mixing it cold. It seems that mixing them cold does not really work, because the honey wine mixture becomes too thick and does not mix well. The flavor was good without adding extra 24 hours to the process, so I decided the wait was not necessary."
