Be careful not to over mix the batter. Remove the mixer bowl, and use a rubber spatula to blend in any flour remaining on the sides of the bowl.",
      "Transfer the batter to a covered container and refrigerate for 2 to 3 hours before baking.",
      "Position an oven rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 400\u00b0F/200\u00b0C/gas 6.",
      "Use a one-tablespoon measure to scoop a slightly rounded spoonful of batter into each madeleine cup. Bake the madeleines until they crown at the center and are deeply golden brown at the edges, about 12 minutes. For even baking, at the midpoint, rotate the pans from front to back. Let the cakes cool in the pans for 3 minutes, and then use a table knife or small offset spatula to loosen the madeleines. Place them ridged-side up on a cooling rack. Serve warm. The madeleines are best when served on the day they are baked. Though not as moist, the madeleines will keep for two days in a covered container."

      "Satay or \"Sate\" was originated from Java, Indonesia. It is also popular in other Southeast Asian countries: Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand. It is an authentic and a popular dish consisting of richly spiced meat (chicken, pork, beef) on bamboo skewers. It is grilled over a wood or charcoal fire and served with a spicy peanut sauce, onions, cucumbers and ketupat (pressed rice cubes.) When I was a kid growing up in Malaysia, my friends and I would wait anxiously for our regular satay vendor. On his shoulder he had a long stick to carry two hugh baskets--a hot charcoal stove on one, and the other basket his famous satay. We would squat near his hot stove and watched hungrily while he cooked our satay. Hmmm..it was the best Satay I've tasted! Ingredients: 2-3 lbs chicken thigh meat 2 tsp. cumin powder 1 tsp. cinnamon powder 5 shallots, diced finely 2 tsp. coriander powder 2 tsp. tumeric powder 2 Tbsp. curry powder 1 1/2 Tbsp. sugar 1 Tbsp. oil 1 tsp. salt 2 stalks lemon grass, crushed oil for basting bamboo skewers, soak overnight with a drop of oil Peanut sauce ingredients: 300 gms raw skinless peanuts, roasted 2 tsp. ginger powder 2 tsp. galangal powder 1 onion, cut in chunks 2 stalks lemon grass, grind finely 4 Tbsp. chilli paste 1/2 cup brown sugar 2 Tbsp. tamarind paste, mix with water to get 1/2 cup 2 Tbsp. oil Method: 1. Cut meat into 1-inch strips, drain and set aside. In a bowl mix cumin, cinnamon, shallots, coriander, tumeric, oil, curry powder, sugar and salt together to form a smooth paste. Marinate the meat well with this mixture. Pierce meat on bamboo skewers. Set aside in refrigerator. Peanut Sauce: 1. In a pan on medium heat, pan roast raw peanuts till golden brown. Cool, and grind peanuts to resembles like breadcrumbs. Set aside. 2. Mix the ginger, galangal, onion, lemon grass, brown sugar and chilli paste to a paste. Heat 1 Tbsp. oil and fry mixture till fragrant until a thin layer of oil forms on top of mixture. Lower heat and add tamarind juice and let it simmer for about 5 minutes. Add sugar and 3/4 of the peanuts. If mixture is too thick, add a little more tamarind juce and a little more sugar if you like it sweeter. The taste should be spicy hot with a balance of sweet and sour taste. 3. Prepare charcoals for grilling. Grill meat over burning coal, constantly basting with cooking oil over the meat using the crushed lemon grass as a brush. Turn chicken over and baste with oil. Grilled till cooked on both sides. 4. To serve, arrange a few sticks of satay on a plate, accompanied with peanut sauce, cucumber, onions, and compressed rice (ketupat)"

To line with sprinkles, sparkling/sanding sugar, or cake sparkles, pour some onto a flat plate and invert outlined cookies onto decor; sprinkles will stick to icing.

      "Add in the sifted flour and mix until the mixture starts to pull away from the walls of the bowl.",
      "Refrigerate the dough for 30 minutes.",
      "Preheat the oven to 190 C. (or 170 C. if using a convection oven).",
      "Set the dough on a lightly floured work surface and roll it out, but not too thin.",
      "Using a cookie cutter or glass, cut out the cookies and transfer them onto a baking tray lined with parchment paper. Leave room between the cookies, as they will expand while baking.",
      "Bake for 13 to 15 minutes then transfer the whole paper to a baking rack to cool.",
      "When the cookies are cool, you can optionally glaze them with some chocolate. Just put the chocolate chunks in a microwave-safe bowl and microwave in 1-minute increments until melted.",
      "Transfer the chocolate into a plastic bag and barely cut off the tip. Squeeze the chocolate back and forth across the cookies."
