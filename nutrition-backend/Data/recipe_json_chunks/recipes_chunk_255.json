Combine seeds with water, soy sauce, molasses, vinegar, green onions, garlic powder, and cayenne in a 2-cup measure. Trim excess fat from beef; place in a large glass bowl; pour marinade over; cover. Refrigerate overnight, turning meat several times in marinade to season evenly. When ready to cook, remove meat from the marinade, then pat dry with paper towels. Brown pot roast in a large skillet. Place meat in a slow cooker; pour marinade over; cover. Cook on low (190-200\u00b0) 10 hours, or on high (290-300\u00b0) for 6 hours, or until beef is tender when pierced with a fork. Remove beef to a heated platter to keep warm. Turn heat control to high. Combine cornstarch with 1/4 c. cold water in a cup; stir into liquid in slow cooker until well blended. Cover; simmer 15 minutes. Carve meat into 1/4 inch slices; serve with gravy."
