    "title": "sanrio-inspired bento box",
    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "Before beginning, you will need: a sharp kitchen knife, bow cookie cutter, 1 inch round cookie cutter, 1/2 inch round piping tip or cookie cutter, 1 1/2 inch round cookie cutter, and 1 piece of card-stock if you'd like to create a template for the character's shapes.",
      "*Tip: Place a tiny piece of cheese under any of the pieces of nori to keep them from curling.",
      "Hello Kitty: Cook the somen noodles in boiling water for 2 minutes. Remove from the heat and drain. Rinse the noodles under cold water and drain again. Stir in enough toasted sesame oil to coat the noodles and keep them from sticking together. Transfer the noodles to your refrigerator while preparing the bento box. You can draw Hello Kitty's face shape onto a piece of card-stock paper to use as a guide. Cut the template out, if using, and lay it (with the side you drew on facing up), on top of the slice of white cheese. Use a sharp kitchen knife to carefully cut out the face shape. Place into your bento box. You can use either a fork, tongs, or chopsticks to neatly twist and place the cooled noodles on top of the cheese. I like to start from the inside and work my way out - placing the twisted piles of noodles on top of the cheese and using my utensil to spread them out to form the shape. Create the body first, then repeat to make each ear. You can place a little of the green onions and herb mixture around the noodle shape to create a separation and also to add flavor when eating them. Fold the nori sheet in half, and cut out 3 long sprinkle like shapes for the whiskers, and 1 small arched shape for her closed eyes (when you unfold the nori you should have 6 whiskers and 2 eyes). Transfer the nori cutouts to the top of your pasta. Use the sharp knife to cut an oval shape out of the yellow cheese and add to the noodles, placing in between the eyes and slightly down. Cut the bow shape out of bell pepper, and use the 1 inch cookie cutter or piping tip to cut a separate piece of pepper for Hello Kitty's iconic red bow. If the pieces will not lay flat on top of the noodles you can use toothpicks, underneath, to hold them in place. Fill in around your noodle character with any ingredients that you would like to enjoy with the noodles. I used pieces of curly kale. .",
      "Keroppi: Cook the Cha Soba noodles in boiling water for 6 minutes, Remove from the heat and drain. Rinse the noodles under cold water and drain again. Stir in enough toasted sesame oil to coat the noodles and keep them from sticking together. If you'd like to add a little more color and flavor to your noodles you can also stir in the matcha powder. Transfer the noodles to your refrigerator while prepping as you did for Hello Kitty. Cut a long oval shape out of the cheese and place, in your bento box, below your Hello Kitty noodles (making sure to leave room for the eyes). Twist and drop the green noodles, and spread them to fill in the shape. Use the 1 1/2 inch round cookie cutter to cut the eyes out of the leftover white cheese. Use the 1/2 inch round piping tip or cookie cutter as a guide to press the shape for Keroppi's eyes into a folded piece of nori. Cut the eyes out as well as a v shape for the mouth. Add the eyes to the top of the noodles so that the cheese is overlapping the noodles and touching in the middle (you can use veggies behind the eyes, if needed, to hold them up). Add all of the nori cutouts. Use the same 1/2 inch cutter to cut 2 cheeks out of the radish, and add them to Keroppi, on either side of his mouth.",
      "Dipping Sauce: This part is super simple! Whisk all of the sauce ingredients together in a small bowl and sweeten, with the honey, to taste. Transfer to a small lidded container to pack with the noodles.",
      "Badtz Maru: Wash and dry the blueberries. Use the other layer of your bento box to arrange the blueberries in an oval shape similar to the bottom of Hello Kitty's face (I cut some of the blueberries in half to fill in gaps). To create the spikes at the top, cut 4 blueberries in half and lay two halves next to each other, with one blueberry cut into a point on top for each of 4 spikes. Cut 2 U shaped pieces out of the pear and lay on top of the blueberries, adding another half a blueberry to each for the eyes (as long as the pear is in a sealed container it will stay white for a at least a day or 2). Cut a rounded triangle out of the mango for the beak. Place on top of the blueberries, just below and in between the eyes.",
      "Finish your masterpiece by filling in the empty areas with your favorite fruits and veggies. Make sure to keep the bento box cold and well sealed until it's time for lunch."

      "Whisk together the water with ingredients from all 3 of the envelopes. Pour about 1/4 cup of the liquid on the bottom of the crockpot, place the roast on top. Don't be tempted to season the roast. There is plenty of salt and other seasonings in these envelopes.",
      "Pour the remaining liquid mixture all over the top and all around the roast. Pour the jar of picante sauce on top of the roast, cover and cook on low for 8 hours, or on high 4 to 5 hours.",
      "To thicken gravy, remove the roast and tent with foil to keep warm. Carefully transfer the contents of the crockpot to a saucepan and stir in a slurry of one tablespoon of cornstarch with just enough water to loosen. Stir into the sauce, bring up to a boil, reduce and simmer until thickened.",
      "To Make Sliders: Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Butter the insides of dinner rolls and toast, butter side down, on a baking sheet in the oven just until warmed through and browned on the bottoms. Meanwhile in a skillet, caramelize a sliced onion in a tablespoon of canola oil and one tablespoon of butter. While onions are browning, use the lowest setting on the microwave to gently warm the leftover beef, just enough to take the chill off. Use a fork to shred the meat. Place a scoop of beef on the bottom half of dinner rolls, then top with caramelized onion, and some finely shredded Swiss cheese. If you like, stack all the sliders back on the baking sheet and cover the whole pan tightly with aluminum foil. Return to the oven just long enough to melt the cheese. Stack the sliders on a platter and serve with condiments at the table or with a nice sauce like a Sour Cream Horseradish Sauce."

      "Make sure the skin is left on the chicken. This is one of the keys for cooking mandy because the skin produces natural fat to cook in the spices. This is why we do not use an oil. Rub mandy spice and sea salt, to taste all over chicken pieces. Place in a non-stick saute pan (or a well seasoned cast iron pan is what I use), cook chicken uncovered with no oil until tender and brown. Place cooked chicken on a plate reserving the pan remnants in the pan as they are.",
      "In a separate pan saute finely chopped onion with 1 tbs butter until tender. Add the whole bruised cardamom pods, cloves, chicken stock, sea salt, to taste, and drained Basmati rice; stir. Bring to a full boil add chopped tomatoes then cover and reduce heat to low. Cook (do not remove lid) for 15 minutes or as long as you cook your rice usually.",
      "After the chicken and rice are done pour the rice into the saute pan used to cook the chicken, mix around if transferring back to the other pot which I suggest if you use a cast iron pan like I do. Place the onion shell bowl into the middle of the rice. If you make a indent in the rice it is easier. Melt butter and pour into onion bowl. Carefully place chicken around the pan slightly close to the onion bowl. Add a hot bit of coal into the melted butter and quickly shut the lid. Allow to smoke for 15 minutes adding a new coal as needed. You may use 3 or 4 pieces of the same bukhoor coal.",

I always use this time to clean up and prepare for the next step in the recipe.",
      "Take one tray from the Log House CandiQuik(R) melting chocolate and melt in the microwave. I have used chocolate bars and chocolate chips, and the Log House stuff is MUCH easier to use. However, IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT YOU FOLLOW THE HEATING INSTRUCTIONS TO A 'T'. Heat it for 1 minute, and only in 15 second increments after that, and that is only if there are still solid chunks of chocolate after you have stirred. Believe me, the chocolate will look like it is not melting, but it is! Just stir it a little and it will become more liquid. I made the mistake of overcooking the chocolate, which makes it hard and powdery and unusable. The good thing is that the Log House package comes with two trays, so if you mess up, you have a backup! The Log House chocolate is available online and at SAM'S Club, where I bought mine. http://loghousefoods.elsstore.com/view/product/?id=18562&cid=2549",
      "Remove the chilled balls from the freezer. Notice that each ball has hardened nicely, and that the bottom is now flat. One ball at a time, insert the pointed end of the toothpick/turkey lacer pin into the flattened bottom of the ball (I have found that the turkey lacer pin makes it easier because of the length. http://www.dollarnights.com/images/K03/Image2/KB-966.jpg). Do not pierce all the way through. Dip the ball into the melted chocolate and swirl it around. You don't need to coat the bottom. Once the ball is evenly covered, hold it upside down until most of the excess has dribbled off. Now, hold the ball upright and using a fork underneath, slowly lift the ball off of the pin and place on the cookie sheet. Dust a pinch of the leftover cookie grounds over the truffle ball before the chocolate dries. Do this for each ball.",
      "STORAGE: Truffles can be left at room temperature for a time while being served, but because of the perishable nature of the cream cheese, long term storage should happen in a refrigerator or freezer.",
      "***Tips for decorating: Use the vanilla version of the Log House chocolate to drizzle lines of white over the dark chocolate coating. You can even reverse the order by rolling the balls in vanilla and drizzling with chocolate! You can even do half and half!",
      "***Tips for Flavor: You can buy different types of Oreos for different flavors. Try Mint Oreos for a minty taste, or chocolate Oreos for a richer chocolate flavor. I have even seen Red Creme Oreos! I'm sure you could even mix up the flavor of cream cheese or use Golden Oreos, but I haven't ventured into that yet ;) The possibilities are endless with this recipe. Have fun with it!"

If it is your first time deboning a fowl, it is advisable to practice first on the chicken rather than the turkey since mistakes will be hidden inside the bigger birds.",
      "Rinse the turkey and remove the neck and any giblets. Place the turkey, breast side down, on a clean flat surface. Cut through the skin along the length of the spine. Using the tip of a knife and starting from the neck end, gently separate meat from rib cage on one side. Toward neck end, cut through the meat to expose the shoulder blade; cut meat away from and around the bone, severing bone at the joint to remove shoulder blade. Disjoint wing between second and third joints. Leave the wing bones and keep the wing attached to the meat.",
      "Continue separating meat from frame, heading toward the thighbone and being careful to keep the \"oyster\" (pocket of meat on back) attached to skin, rather than leaving it with the bone. Cut through ball-and-socket joint to release the thighbone from the carcass (bird will be open on one side, exposing bones left to deal with). Keep the leg attached to the meat.",
      "Repeat boning procedure on the other side of the bird. Carefully remove the carcass and use it to make stock. Stock is needed for making stuffing and more stock is needed for gravy. To make stock, put the turkey carcass in a large pot and cover with water. Bring to a boil, then simmer on low heat overnight.",
      "You should end up with a flat boneless (except for wings and legs) turkey with the skin intact in one large piece. Put the boned turkey in a large dish or bowl and cover with plastic wrap to keep it from drying out. Place it in the refrigerator.",
      "Repeat the deboning process on the duckling and the chicken, but debone both stumps of wings and leg drumsticks. Cut through flesh at the thinnest point and trim around these bones with a knife until they can be removed. (Since they have little meat, we usually cut off the entire wings and add them to the stock pot.) Both the chicken and duck will be stuffed inside the turkey and need not be kept \"perfectly\" intact.",
      "Trim excess skin and fat from the birds. Ducks, in particular, have a lot of excess fatty skin that should be saved to render fat to be used later for making gravy. We usually remove most of the skin from the chicken, but keep the duck skin which adds flavor.",

Add 2 lbs sausage (we prefer spicy Italian sausage) to the skillet and cook about 5 minutes or until the meat is browned, stirring frequently. Add paprika (3 tbsp.) and minced garlic (3 tbsp.) and cook approximately 3 minutes over medium heat, stirring occasionally. Stir in 3 cups of stock and bring to simmer. Continue cooking until water evaporates and oil rises to top, about 10 minutes. Stir in 2-3 cups toasted bread crumbs and mix well. Add more bread crumbs if mixture is too moist.",
      "Prepare a similar amount of another stuffing such as corn bread stuffing.",
      "Assemble the Turducken at least 11 to 12 hours before dinner.",
      "Spread the turkey, skin down, on flat surface, exposing as much meat as possible. Rub 3 tablespoons of seasoning mix evenly on meat. Spread sausage stuffing over the turkey in an even layer approximately 3/4 inch thick.",

      "Arrange the chicken, skin down, evenly on top of corn bread stuffing. Season chicken meat with seasoning mix. Spread remainder of sausage and/or corn bread stuffing on top of chicken.",
      "With another person's help, carefully lift the sides of the layered birds, folding the sides of the turkey together. Have a helper hold the bird while sewing the opening down the back of the turkey together using cotton thread. The bird may not close perfectly, and a strip of cheese cloth can be used to help close the \"crack\" in the back of the turkey so stuffing will not leak out when the bird is turned over.",
      "Since the turducken has no skeleton, it must be trussed up or it may fall apart in cooking. Tie 4-5 pieces of cotton string around the bird, width wise to act as skeletal support. Turn the bird over and place in a roasting rack inside a large roasting pan so it is oriented breast side up and looks like a \"normal\" turkey. Tie the legs together just above the tip bones.",
      "Heat oven to 225 degrees F. Temperature control is critical since the turducken is so massive that it has to be cooked slowly at a low temperature to prevent burning the outside before the interior is cooked. Using an oven thermometer is highly recommended. We place 2-3 oven thermometers at different locations within the oven to monitor oven temperature. We also use a meat thermometer inside the bird to measure its internal temperature.",
      "Place the bird in the center of the oven and bake until a meat thermometer inserted through to center reads 165 degrees, approximately 9-10 hours, though cooking times will vary depending on the size of the birds and amount of stuffing used. Rely on temperature and not time cooked for doneness.",
      "There will be no need to baste, but accumulated drippings may need to be removed from the pan every few hours so that the lower portion does not deep fry in the hot oil. Save pan drippings for gravy. Remove the turducken from the oven and let cool in the pan for an hour before serving. Make gravy according to your favorite recipe.",

      "Simple Gravy if desired.",
      "Take 1 cup of pan drippings plus 1 cup of flour and cook over medium heat until \"tan\". Add 10 cups stock to fat/flour all at once. Whisk thoroughly. Bring back to a boil and then simmer for 5 minute Whisk constantly. Add salt + pepper + paprika \"to taste\".",
      "Another simple gravy variation is to use about a quarter to half cup of pinot grigio and about two to three tablespoons of instant potatoes instead of the flour. Test for taste and if it gets too thick add water or more pinot.",
      "The gravy can be made in advance and allowed to stand over low heat for at least 2 hours (maybe more). We usually make at least two batches."

      "These days, borage is rarely used in cooking or grown in the common herb garden. It is a beautiful plant with delicate blue flowers. The leaves, flowers and stalks of borage are edible, however borage is a voracious grower and can take over a garden very quickly. This has lead to a decline in its popularity as a garden plant and also as an ingredient in meals.",
      "Using Borage in Cooking.",
      "Borage is a versatile herb in the kitchen; its leaves, stalk and flowers are edible. The young, fresh leaves have a mild cucumber taste and can be added to salads, used in stocks, soups and stews, or brewed to make a refreshing tea. You could also try adding them to sandwiches instead of lettuce, or chopping them and adding them to cream cheese or yogurt. When cooked, borage leaves may be used as a substitute to spinach. Don't be put off by the fine white hairs on the leaves, as once in the mouth they quickly dissolve. They also disappear when cooked.",
      "Borage flowers are beautiful and both look and taste fantastic in salads. They can also be preserved or candied. Why not try freezing some in ice cubes and adding them to drinks or simply floating the blooms in a glass of lemonade?",
      "The stems of borage are used to flavour a number of alcoholic beverages, including Pimms No. 1. In Spain the stems are parboiled and fried in batter. Chopped up, they make a great addition to soups and can also be eaten raw; giving a hearty crunch to salads."

      "(For those that are not too familiar with grilling, preheating your grill to 400 degrees is a great way to clean your grill before cooking a new item. Simply wait till your covered grill hits 400 degrees and then using a grill cleaning brush, scrub off the chard left overs. Heating your grill up to 400 degrees also creates in my opinion the best heat to start off your grilling as you'll for the most part not want to cover your grill again through out the cooking process. It's also equally as important to watch your wings to make sure your wings aren't being overly chard on the outside, this just comes with practice!).",

After cooking the mixture on medium for 5 mins, reduce (allow sauce to thicken) this mixture on a low to medium heat setting for about 10 mins, stirring occasionally. (meaning you'll need to have the sauce pan uncovered during the whole processes to allow the moisture to escape).",

Add the wings in batches (about ten wings depending on how large your wok or pot is) and coat for about 2 minutes making sure that the wings are well coated. Once done, plate them and enjoy!"

Using the bottom of a measuring cup, create a well 4 to 5 inches (10 to 13 cm) wide, with at least 1/2 inch (12 mm) of flour on the bottom of the well.",
      "Slowly and carefully add the whole eggs, egg yolks and olive oil to the well, treating the flour as a bowl. Using a fork, gently beat the eggs without touching the flour walls or scraping through the bottom to the work surface.",
      "Then, still stirring, slowly begin to incorporate the flour \"walls\" into the egg mixture, gradually working your way toward the outer edges of the flour, but disturbing the base as little as possible. If the eggs breach the sides too soon, quickly scoop them back in and reform the wall. Once the dough starts to take on a thickened, paste-like quality (slurry), slowly incorporate the flour on the bottom into the mixture.",
      "When the slurry starts to move as a solid mass, remove as much as possible from the fork. Slide a pastry scraper or spatula under the mass of dough and flip it and turn it onto itself to clear any wet dough from the work surface. At this point, with your hands, start folding and forming the dough into a single mass. The goal is to incorporate all the flour into the mass, and using a spray bottle to liberally spritz the dough with water is essential. It is a very dry dough, and it is very important to generously and constantly spritz it with water to help \"glue\" any loose flour to the dry dough ball.",
      "When the dough forms a stiff, solid mass, scrape away any dried clumps of flour from the work surface, which, if incorporated in the dough, will create dry spots in the final product.",
      "To knead the dough, on your work surface, drive the heel of your dominant hand into the dough. Push down and release, and then use your other hand to pick up and rotate the dough on itself 45 degrees. Drive the heel of your hand back in the dough, rotate and repeat for 10 to 15 minutes. When the dough is ready, it will stop changing appearance and texture. The dough will be firm but bouncy to the touch and have a smooth, silky surface, almost like Play-Doh. Tightly wrap the dough in plastic wrap before proceeding as directed with your recipe. Makes about 20 oz. (625 g) of dough."

      "Place the cooked mixture into a blender and add the vinegars and salt. Blend until completely smooth and pureed. Adjust the seasoning.",
      "For the compound butter:",
      "In the bowl of a food processor, with the machine running, drop in the 5 whole garlic cloves, through the feed tube, one at a time. Scrape down the garlic with a spatula and add the butter, parsley, lemon zest and juice, and 1 to 2 tablespoons of the hot sauce. Season with salt and pepper, and puree until smooth. Reserve one third of the mixture in a small bowl and set the rest aside to spread on your chicken.",
      "For the chicken:",
      "Using your fingers, gently loosen the skin of the chicken away from the meat. Spread the compound butter under the skin as well as over the skin. Wash your hands and then sprinkle the chicken generously on both sides, using tongs to turn it over (just to prevent the mid-seasoning hand wash). Set the chicken aside for a moment.",
      "Set a heavy-bottomed roasting pan over medium-high heat. Add the olive oil, then the chicken neck, wing tips and the sausage, and brown everything, stirring occasionally to brown all over, 8 to 10 minutes. Add the smashed garlic cloves, stir for 1 minute. Add the potatoes and toss them in the drippings. Add the pepperoncini, the pepperoncini liquid and the chicken stock. Place the spatchcocked chicken breast-side down on top of the potatoes and sausages. Roast for 30 minutes, then flip the chicken over and continue to cook until the chicken registers 160 degrees F in the thigh, about 45 more minutes. Remove the chicken from the pan, smear the remaining compound butter on top of it and leave it to rest for 15 minutes.",
      "While the chicken rests, continue to roast the potatoes and what is left in the pan for 15 minutes more.",
      "Once the chicken is rested, cut it into 8 to 10 pieces, however you like. I love to serve it family style and pour all the potatoes and sausage out onto a platter and place the cut up chicken on top, making sure to pour over all the juices from the cutting board where you cut your chicken. Sprinkle chopped parsley all over and dig inches Serve with more hot sauce on the side, if desired."

Simmer the beef until golden brown on each side. Remember to do a little at a time so you don't over crowd the pan. If you put in too many pieces in at a time, they will just steam vs brown. After the meat is done, just remove to a plate on the side. Time to deglaze the pot. Add in the wine and deglaze scraping up all the bits on the bottom of the pot. Then add in the small onion cut in half, the carrot, celery and the beef. Then add in the water and broth and turn to low heat and simmer, covered. It should take around 1 hours You want the meat tender but not falling completely apart. This time depends on how small you cut your pieces and the cut of meat you purchased. Just take a look after 1 hr, it can take up to 1 1/2 hrs to be tender.",
      "Soup Base -- When you beef is just about done, it is time to make the Base Flavors. In a large saute pan, add the olive oil and bring to medium high heat. Add in the onion and garlic and saute for about 3 minutes until lightly golden but not too brown but tender. Add in the mushrooms (remember, I don't like mine too fine chopped, this is a rustic soup) and continue to saute until the mushrooms begin to get tender and golden brown, about 3-5 minutes. Then add in the potatoes (drained) and stir well to combine. Season with salt and pepper to taste.",
      "Beef -- Now it is time to remove the carrots, celery and onion from the beef. Remember they are large pieces so they will be easy to take out. And don't forget the bay leaf. This was all used just to flavor the beef and the broth.",
      "After your removed the vegetables, add your fresh sauteed vegetables to the meat mixture and stir well. Bring to a medium boil and add in the chopped kale. Turn to medium low and the kale will only take about 10 minutes to cook and become tender.",
      "Finish -- Check for any additional seasoning, salt or pepper and add in the thyme and stir well.",
      "Garnish -- I love to serve a toasted baguette with melted swiss cheese - absolutely perfect for dipping. A hearty perfect cozy night soup. ENJOY!"

    "title": "cilantro-lime leftover turkey stew",
    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "This recipe takes two days to make, not continuous work mind you, but short periods of intense activity, separated by many hours of slothful relaxation. There are two main phases, the first is to make the meaty Turkey broth base, the second, to make the complete stew.",
      "PHASE - I.",
      "Secure a large crock pot or conventional pot of at least six quarts capacity. If you do not have one, procure one from a neighbor. A handgun may be helpful if they are not very cooperative (sorry - I forgot to add that to the ingredients list - my bad).",
      "Take the Turkey carcass and violently rip it limb-from-limb until it fits into your pot. If you are timid, find another more \"PC\" recipe, you pretender!.",
      "Fill the pot with ordinary water to cover the Turkey. I typically use five to six quarts. No fancy froo-froo water from places like France is needed. If you think you need it anyway, then get the hell out of Dodge and find another recipe!",
      "Slice the carrot into less than 1/8\" slices and put into the pot. Strain the garlic cloves finely and put in pot. Add 1 Tbsp of the dried Celery leaves. Put the pot on the stovetop on low heat for 3 to 4 hours, or until the meat simply falls off the bone. DO NOT boil, just use slow heat with a few bubbles rising. Boiling will kill the flavor. A large crockpot can also be used.",
      "After truning off the heat, let the pot cool down for an hour, and then place it into the fridge overnight. I do this so the fat in the broth will rise to the top and harden, so it can be easily removed in the morning. Leaving the fat in this stew will inflate your waistline -- as if the beer you drink isn't doing enough!",
      "PHASE - II.",
      "The next morning, get the pot from the fridge and skim off the fat from the top with a large spoon. Then you will have to get your hands dirty. If you have recently changed the oil in your bike, you better scrub up but good. Clean hands are a must. Separate the meat from the bones by hand. I set up two large bowls, one for bones and gristle, the other for cleaned Turkey meat. Remove the meat and bones from the pot and separate into the two bowls until there is only broth left in the pot. Put the remnants of the skin, the carrot slices, and anything that looks funny to you in the bone bowl.",
      "Toss what is in the bone bowl into the trash or out the window if you have no trash can. Next go through the meat bowl and cut up any large chunks of meat with a knife. I like to chop it in the direction of the muscle fibers so you leave long shreds of meat. That makes things interesting in the bowl when eating, unlike the factory-made stuff you get in cans. For six quarts of soup use about 1-1/2 quarts of shredded Turkey. If you have more meat than that, set it aside and use it for burrito filling. If you use more meat it becomes too thick.",
      "Place the pot of broth on the stove and start to heat it slowly. Put the burner on medium heat to start, no hurry now. Toss in the turkey from the meat bowl, open the cans of sweet corn, drain them of water, and put the corn into the pot. Then open the can of tomatoes and put it all into the pot without draining.",
      "Slice the onions and peppers into strips, less than 1/4 inch wide and at least 1-1/2 inches long. Do not finely chop, unless you want to make a bland uninteresting chowder. Brown the onions and peppers in a large pan in oil. Hey! Don't use a lot of oil, this is a low fat recipe. Turn the sliced veggies so they don't burn, yet get a bit brown on the edges. Then dump them into the pot.",
      "Next add the rest of the dried Celery leaves, the Ancho Chili Powder, the Coriander, and Cayenne. Stir well.",
      "Then wait for the pot to start bubbling. NOT BOILING -- just slowly bubbling. While you are waiting for this, squeeze the juice from the Limes into a bowl. Then thoroughly wash about 2/3 of the bunch of Cilantro and strip the leaves from the stems with a knife. The remaining 1/3 bunch will be used later as garnish when serving.",
      "When the pot starts to bubble, turn the heat down to low and add 3/4 of the Lime Juice and the Cilantro leaves. DO NOT BOIL. If your pot is not full to six quarts capacity, now is the time to add more water. This recipe is for six quarts of stew. Now add salt to taste. I usually end up adding about 1+ level Tbsp, but you might like it different.",
      "Cover the pot and let it very slowly bubble for 1 to 1-1/2 hours. If it bubbles vigorously, turn the heat down even more. Stir it up about every ten minutes or so so it all gets well mixed together. Then about 10 minutes before the end add the remaining Lime juice. This is the time to taste it to see if you need more salt, lime or other ingredients to taste. After you take the pot off the heat, let it sit about 30 minutes to let the flavors blend and develop more. With this stew, the longer you wait, the better it gets.",
      "Serve it up in large bowls. I like to add a few tbsp of salsa verde and a large dollop of sour cream in the middle of each bowl. Don't stir it in, just plunk it into the bowl. This adds a bit of temperature and flavor contrast to the stew. Then garnish with the rest of the Cilantro.",
      "And hey, there is not need to eat it right away! This stew is even better after you cool it in the fridge for a day and reheat. If you don't have hungry guests that need to eat right away, set it aside, and go for a ride instead. It will be even better the next day."
