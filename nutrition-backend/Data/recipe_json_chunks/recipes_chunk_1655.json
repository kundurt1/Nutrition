      "Using your hands or a shaker-top jar, sprinkle the brisket liberally with the rub.",
      "Let it sit for about 5 minutes and pat the spices into the meat but do not rub-this mixture will form a dark savory crust on the meat, often referred to as the sought after \"burnt-ends.\"",

      "It will feel like the consistency of butter when you insert it with the probe of the thermometer.",
      "Remember: Do not turn the meat during the entire cooking time.",
      "Let the meat rest for 20 minutes or until cool enough to handle.",
      "The recipe can be made in advance up to this point and, once it is cool, wrapped in 3 layers of heavy-duty aluminum foil.",
