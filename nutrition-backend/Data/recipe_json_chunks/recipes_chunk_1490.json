Arrange on a parchment-lined aluminum baking sheet, leaving 2 inches between each. With the palm of your hand, gently press each portion to minimize its dome.

Due to the unique melting point of coconut oil, the cookies will seem doughy and raw in the middle, but they will become increasingly thick and firm as they cool. Cool directly on the baking sheet until the crumb is set, about 5 minutes.

      "Use immediately as a frosting for cake, and serve as soon as possible; at cool room temperature, the frosting will hold for about 24 hours, as the cake will slowly absorb the meringue over time. If desired, after frosting a cake, the exterior layer of meringue can be toasted like a marshmallow using a culinary blowtorch.",
      "While the approximate cooking times for the water bath are estimations at best, and will naturally vary from kitchen to kitchen, substantially missing the mark indicates heats that are vastly too high or low. When the meringue cooks much too fast, it is prone to scrambling, regardless of how thoroughly the bowl is scraped, resulting in a lumpy texture and eggy flavor. When the meringue is cooked too slowly, excess evaporation will dry the meringue, making it grainy and dense. In either event, adjusting the heat as needed will resolve the issue."

      "Fill a wide pot with at least 1 1/2 inches of water, with a thick ring of crumpled tinfoil placed on the bottom to act as a \"booster seat\" that will prevent the bowl from touching the bottom of the pot. Place over high heat until steaming-hot, then adjust temperature to maintain a gentle simmer. Combine egg whites, sugar, salt, cream of tartar, and vanilla seeds (if using) in the bowl of a stand mixer. Set over steaming water, stirring and scraping constantly with a flexible spatula, until egg whites hold steady at 185\u00b0F (85\u00b0C). This should take only 10 to 12 minutes, so if mixture seems to be moving slowly, simply turn up the heat. Once ready, transfer to a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment and whip at high speed about 10 minutes, until meringue is glossy, stiff, and cool to the touch, around 90\u00b0F (32\u00b0C).",
      "With mixer still running, add butter, 1 or 2 tablespoons at a time. Initially, the volume of the meringue will decrease dramatically; it may even seem soupy along the way, but as the cool butter is added, the mixture will begin to thicken and cool. In the end, buttercream should be thick, creamy, and soft but not runny, around 72\u00b0F (22\u00b0C). Mix in vanilla extract and almond extract (if using) on low speed until well combined.",
      "Use buttercream right away, or transfer to a large zipper-lock bag, press out the air, and seal. Buttercream can be refrigerated for up to 2 weeks and frozen for up to several months. (The main issue with longer storage in the freezer is odor absorption, not spoilage.) Rewarm to 72\u00b0F and re-whip before using.",
      "If warmer than 74\u00b0F (23\u00b0C), the buttercream will be soft and loose; pop it in the fridge for 15 minutes and re-whip to help it thicken and cool. If colder than 68\u00b0F (20\u00b0C), the buttercream will be firm and dense, making it difficult to spread over cakes and slow to melt on the tongue, creating a greasy mouthfeel; to warm, briefly set over a pan of steaming water, just until you see the edges melting slightly, then re-whip to help it soften and warm.

Cook until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the breast registers 150\u00b0F and the legs register 165\u00b0F, 5 to 10 minutes; remove the chicken pieces to a second rack or a paper-towel-lined plate as they reach their final temperature. Season with salt and serve-or, for extra-crunchy fried chicken, go to step 7.",

Add crushed tomatoes and cider vinegar and cook, with cover slightly ajar, until beans and beef are fully tender and broth is rich and lightly thickened, 2 to 3 1/2 hours longer, adding water if necessary to keep beans and meat mostly submerged (a little protrusion is okay).",

If bottom is not as crisp as desired, place pan over a burner and cook on medium heat, moving the pan around to cook evenly until it is crisp, 1 to 3 minutes.

Lower the mixer speed, add the flour, and mix until smooth. The dough will be quite soft and sticky, but should hold its shape when you drop it from a spoon. Stir in the pistachios and cherries.",

Five minutes before cutting, use a spray bottle filled with room-temperature water to lightly but thoroughly spritz the log, making sure to cover the sides as well as the top.

      "Reduce the oven temperature to 325\u00b0F. Wait another 5 minutes, then cut the biscotti into 1/4- to 3/4-inch slices. How thick you slice them depends on a number of factors. This recipe, without nuts or any add-ins, is easy to slice thin. Once you start adding chips, almonds, raisins, and other chunky ingredients, a 3/4-inch slice is more realistic. When you're slicing, be sure to cut straight up and down, if you cut at an angle, biscotti may be thicker at the top than the bottom, and they'll topple over during their second bake.",

(The authors recommend a 6-quart pot, but in my experience that is not large enough to hold these ingredients plus, later, the pork. I use a 9 1/2-quart Dutch oven, which is a little roomy but works fine. I suspect 7 1/2 quarts would be perfect.)",

Use a sharp knife to slice the skin from the shoulder with a gentle sawing motion, working back from the point diagonally across from the leg end where the skin forms a corner (you can ask your butcher to do this to save yourself time). Leave a thin layer of fat on the shoulder. Season the pork with the salt and black pepper.",

Lower the pork, skinned side down, into the pot with the tomato braising liquid.",

Tuck the vegetables around the pork in the pot. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons vinegar to the skillet and stir with a wooden spoon, scraping up any caramelized pork, tomato, and onion bits from the bottom. Pour over the pork.",

Baste the pork, then turn the heat down to 300\u00b0F and continue to cook, basting every 30 minutes, until the pork is tender, about 2 1/2 hours. For pork so tender it falls from the bone-the kind suitable for barbecue sandwiches or tacos-cook 1 hour longer for a total of 3 1/2 hours.",
      "Remove the pot from the oven and the pork from the pot. Let the pork cook on a cutting board. Season the sauce in the pot with molasses, vinegar, salt, pepper, and smoked paprika to taste (it usually tastes pretty good to me without further seasoning).",
      "When the pork is cool enough to handle, pull it into shreds. I'm not going to lie to you-this is pretty gross, because the muscles in the shoulder are very articulated and, well, muscle-y. But you can't run from the fact that you're eating an animal here, so fortify yourself with a beer and get to it. Refrigerate the pulled pork overnight in a container with the sauce.",
      "When the time comes to serve the tacos, reheat the pork gently in its sauce on top of the stove. Chop the cilantro and slice the onion very thin. Warm the flour tortillas (I do this in a skillet, individually, but this gets really tiresome with so many tortillas-any great ideas out there about how to warm a bunch of tortillas at once and still have them taste and feel good?) Let your guests build their own tacos, adding as much cilantro and onion as they like. The Lee brothers recommend using 1/4 cup pork and sauce per taco."
