      "Lightly butter a large heatproof bowl, add cereal and set aside. Lightly butter a 13x9\" baking dish, then line with parchment paper, leaving a 2\" overhang on long sides. Lightly butter parchment. Cook 3/4 cup butter in a large skillet over medium heat, swirling, until butter foams, then browns (be careful not to let it burn), 5-7 minutes. Add marshmallows and salt. Reduce heat to low and cook, stirring constantly, until marshmallows are melted and mixture is smooth, about 3 minutes. Mixture will have brown specks and almost look grayish in color, and that's ok!",

Stir with a large heatproof spatula or large spoon, scraping bottom of bowl and folding, until cereal is completely coated, mixture will get very sticky and thicken as it cools so work quickly. Scrape into prepared pan; then cover with a sheet of parchment paper. Press down firmly to make an even, compact layer (just don't press too hard or you'll break the loops!). Cover treats loosely with plastic and let sit until cool, about 2 hours.",

I suggest two types here because the runnier sort smoothes over things more easily when appropriate. If you only keep one type then use whatever you have - it will be just fine :).",

I'm sure there are other spices that would work just as well in spare/extra mills but that does me for now! (I don't use salt, ever.

Place formed dough onto sheet, about nine balls per sheet. (Smaller cookie sheets can be used but fewer cookies can be baked at one time and the time may need to be adjusted).",
      "Bake until cookies are light golden brown and outer edges start to harden, yet centers are still soft and puffy, 15 to 18 minutes (start checking at 13 minutes). (Frozen dough requires an extra 1 to 2 minutes baking time.) Cool cookies on sheets. Store in an airtight container.",

The cookies came out a little smaller than the giant 1/4 cup size, but they still looked great. They will deflate a little as they cool so keep that in mind when determining baking time. I baked mine for the full 18 minutes, or just until the centers were soft but not squishy. The cookie scoop method yielded 17 large cookies."
