Being the busy bee that I am I needed to find an easy, cake mix recipe that I could use in a pinch. Here it is! Still nice but with a homemade taste. Try it - I am positive you will see how easy it is to still get those cupcakes together the night before school. You know how kids are!",
      "Ready, set, go. Dump into your mixer the cake mix, eggs, melted butter, and water. Mix on low for a few minutes, scraping down sides as needed. Now mix on high for another minute or so. It should be thick and creamy. Now fill cupcake tins about 2/3's full - don't fill to the top. Bake cupcakes in a 325\u00b0 oven for about 18 minutes, until set or until a toothpick comes out clean.",

Some hate frosting, some hate \"whipped frosting\", some hate icing, regular and canned. You can imagine I'm sure. Besides that little issue, I could never find a recipe for frosting that didn't taste like butter. I have looked high and low and tried various types only to throw them in the trash. I recently came across this \"no fail frosting\". Guess what? I tried it and loved it! It doesn't have that heavy butter flavor that I hate - somehow it came together. It was creamy, thick, and had a nice vanilla flavor. I would recommend if you need a white icing, use a clear butter, colorless vanilla, and regular Crisco without butter. That way you will have the clean white coloring that you need. I was going to dye mine so it didn't really matter.",
      "This is your recipe for mile high frosting for decorating cupcakes!",
      "Cream your 1 cup of butter and 1 cup of Crisco until well blended and smooth. Scrape sides as needed. Slowly add the powdered sugar - one cup at a time until blended. Add whipping cream and vanilla and beat at highest speed until super fluffy about 1 minute. Scrape sides as needed. If you are coloring your frosting, add your drops one at a time and mix completely until you get the color you need. Store in refrigerator when not using.",

In this recipe I used 1/2 cup of sucanat, 1/2 cup organic cane sugar in the raw and 1 cup of organic demerera (just because I had all three!). Any sugar will do (I prefer 1 cup white and 1 cup brown for flavour) but if you need a truly vegan product, look for the sugars I mentioned."

Pour into a large bowl, add the melted butter, and stir with a flexible spatula until all crumbs are moistened. Place the cookie-crumb mixture in the lined pan and, using your fingers, press the mixture firmly and evenly into the bottom. Bake for 10 minutes, then remove to a wire cooling rack (leave the oven on) while you make the filling. Snap the remaining Oreos in half, put them in the food processor, and turn on and off quickly a few times, just until the cookies are roughly chopped.",
      "3. Make the filling: In a large bowl, using an electric mixer on medium speed, beat the cream cheese and sugar until well blended, about 2 minutes. Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl with a flexible spatula and beat again until uniform. Beat in sour cream, vanilla and salt. Scrape down the bowl and mix again. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each. After beating in the last egg, scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl and beat one more time, to make sure the mixture is fully combined. Stir in chopped Oreos with the same spatula.",
      "4. Pour the cream cheese mixture over the baked cookie crust, smooth the top with the spatula, and bake for 40 minutes, until the filling is set around the edges but still slightly wobbly in the center when you gently shake the pan. Remove the pan to a wire rack to cool to room temperature, about 1 hour. When cool, cover it with foil and refrigerate until well chilled, at least 3 hours. (I chill mine overnight.)",
      "5. To cut, use the foil overhang to lift the cheesecake out of the pan and place on a large cutting board. Use a sharp chef's knife to cut the cheesecake into bars, rinsing off the knife with hot water and wiping it dry between each cut. Keep refrigerated until ready to serve.",

      "2. In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour and almond meal. Add this mixture to the mixture in the mixer with the mixer turned off. Drape a kitchen towel over the mixer to prevent flour from flying all over, and pulse the mixer at low speed 5 times for about 2 seconds each time. If there is still a lot of flour on the surface of the dough, pulse a couple of more times. On low speed, mix the dough for about 30 seconds more, just until the flour is incorporated. Don't worry if the dough looks a bit crumbly-working the dough as little as possible once the flour is added will yield the best texture.",
      "3. Using a rubber spatula, transfer half of the soft, sticky dough onto a piece of plastic wrap and form into a log. Don't worry if the log isn't perfect! Wrap the log well in plastic wrap and then repeat with the other half of the dough. Refrigerate the logs for at least 3 hours, preferably longer. (The dough can be kept in the refrigerator for up to 3 days or frozen for up to 2 months.)",
      "4. Center a rack in the oven and preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. Remove one log from the refrigerator, unwrap it, and slice it into 1/2-inch-thick cookies. Place the rounds on one of the baking sheets, leaving an inch of space between them. Bake the cookies for 15 to 18 minutes, rotating the baking sheet halfway through. When done, the cookies will be light brown on the bottom, lightly golden brown around the edges, and pale on top. Remove them from the oven and let the cookies rest for a couple of minutes before carefully lifting them onto a rack with a wide metal spatula to cool to room temperature. (You can also just carefully slide the parchment paper with the cookies on it onto the rack if the rack is wide enough.) The cookies will finish setting as they cool, so do not worry if the tops still feel a bit tender when you remove them from the oven. Repeat with the second log of dough and the remaining lined baking sheet."

In a heavy-bottomed pot (aim for using a pot on the larger side to give the sugar room to do its thing), melt the remaining 1 cup of sugar over medium heat, stirring the sugar constantly with a wooden spoon to keep it from burning or melting unevenly. The sugar is done when it has liquefied and is a dark rich copper color.",

When the water in the sauce pan is simmering, starting from the handle of the pan and moving clockwise around the pan, very carefully break each egg into the water (get as close to the water as you can, but be careful not to burn yourself).

Toss the pan to coat the squash, then cook for a few minutes, until the squash starts to get some color on the bottom. Give the pieces another toss to brown on all sides, and continue tossing every few minutes to get more color and to cook all of the pieces. If the pan dries out (you will know because the squash pieces will start to stick to the pan), add a bit more oil. When the squash is cooked through, remove the pan from the heat and set aside.",

Reduce the heat to low. Add the miso paste to the dashi, stirring the soup to combine everything. Add the poached eggs with a slotted spoon (so that the cold water drains off them when they are transferred) and reheat slightly (but do not boil).",

      "Bake at 350\u00b0F for 25-30 minutes until they test done.",

Make as many or as few as you want. Muffin batter may be kept for 1 week in refrigerator. They also freeze great. Place them in a Ziplock bag and pull out 1 at a time and place it in the microwave for 30-40 seconds. These are so good with butter and honey! Serve for breakfast, or with your favorite soup one night.",

      "This pie has a few steps but it's very tasty. I've added my favorite crust recipe. You don't have to use it. You could buy a pre-made crust or use your own favorite. The crust recipe makes 4 crusts at a time. I usually make the whole recipe, and just use what I need. I love freezing the dough for pies at a later time. It's super easy, and all you have to do is thaw the dough on the counter for a few hours and you can make another pie. The filling recipe fills 3-4 pies depending on how full you fill them.",
      "For the pie crust:",
      "In a large bowl, combine flour, cornstarch, salt and sugar. Cut in shortening. Set aside.",
      "In another bowl, mix egg, cold water and vinegar. Blend this into the flour mixture until it forms a ball. Try to handle the dough as little as possible. Recipe makes 4 single pie crusts so split the ball of dough into fourths. Again, I always make the whole recipe. If I have dough left over I just plop the extra dough ball(s) into a Ziploc and put them into the freezer.",
      "For the strawberry pie you need to blind bake the crusts. That's just pre-baking. I usually roll out the crust(s), put each into a pie pan and crimp the edges and then put another pie pan on top of the crust to bake it. That keeps the dough from slipping down the pie pan. The filling recipe below makes 3 pies so if you are making the entire batch, you'll want to roll out 3 crusts. Bake at 375 F for about 15-20 minutes or until browned. Remove from the oven and allow to cool before filling.",
      "For the cream filling:",
      "This is pretty much just a no bake cheesecake.",
      "Beat the cream cheese and condensed milk together until completely smooth. Gently fold in the whipped cream and pudding. This much cream filling filled three 9-inch pies really full. You could fill four easily with this much cream. You may just want to add a few more strawberries. Fill each cooled pie shell almost full of cream and then top with fresh berries that have been glazed (recipe below).",
      "For the strawberry glaze:",
      "I use this recipe all the time. It is so easy and cheap to make. No need to buy Danish Dessert anymore, but you totally can if you want.",
      "This berry glaze will make enough to glaze the four pies or approximately 6 pounds of whole or halved strawberries. I usually use 1 1/2 pounds of strawberries per pie. It usually depends on how small you slice your berries. If you leave them whole the presentation is more dramatic, and you can use less berries. Put the prepared berries in a large bowl.",
      "Combine all of the glaze ingredients (except berries) in a saucepan over medium heat and cook until mixture comes to a boil. Cool completely and add it to the fresh berries for a beautiful glaze."

    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "NOTE: Use a 10\" bundt pan.",
      "For the caramel:",
      "Add one cup sugar to a small saucepan over medium-low heat. Splash in a quarter cup of water and a pinch of cream of tartar. Cream of tartar will prevent crystallization which is when you get giant snowflakes in your water, instead of caramel. Don't ask me how I know this. Let's just say there's nothing like making caramel three times to learn the hard way.",
      "Cook until light golden brown or the mixture reads over 115F on an instant read thermometer.",
      "Meanwhile... For the flan:",
      "Preheat the oven to 350F. Put a large lasagna pan in there, half full of water (for a water bath to keep the heat gentle on the flan)",
      "In a small saucepan over medium heat, cook some milk and a little cream with the scrapings of a vanilla bean. Of course, a splash of vanilla extract is okay too.",
      "Heat everything over medium until the milk is scalded, or just nearly boils. Then, remove from heat and cool to room temperature.",
      "Meanwhile, crack 5 eggs into a large bowl as well as two egg yolks. The two egg yolks take this dessert over the edge in creaminess. Trust me on this. You'll faint when you eat it. I did.",
      "Whisk eggs together with the sugar, pumpkin puree, cinnamon, allspice, and cooled cream mixture.",
      "Now, here's the exciting part. Pour the caramel into your bundt pan while still hot.",
      "Swirl it around in the pan to coat the sides. Be careful, the pan gets hot! You might need pot holders. I only went partway up the sides because the flan doesn't fill the entire bundt pan.",
      "Strain your gorgeous flan mixture into the pan (or, if you find it easier, strain into a bowl first). Toss all the yuckies left in your strainer down the sink. Feel no guilt.",
      "Put your bundt pan into your lasagna pan of water that has been in the oven. Bake for one hour and ten minutes, or until an inserted knife comes out clean. Stunning.",
      "Let cool and refrigerate about six hours (or overnight). To unmold, run a knife along the top of all edges to break the \"seal.\" Then - this is very scientific - jiggle the bundt pan from side to side, until the flan begins to wiggle free. Some caramel should ooze up and out when you tip it to the side a little.",
      "You might dip the pan into some hot water for a few seconds to help loosen the caramel at the bottom.",
      "Now, for the big finale... Carefully invert the flan onto a large platter with a lip (so the caramel won't overflow).",
      "Slice and serve to your mother in law and she'll love you forever and ever. Especially if you serve her a slice first. And that's a promise.",
      "(Serve cool, but not ice cold)"

      "Don't be distracted by the heavenly aroma that is enveloping your kitchen-you need your full concentration on the task!",
      "Now dump in the rest of your sugar. Keep stirring, and add your vanilla. At this point, I like to mention that if you have vanilla sugar or a powdered type of vanilla flavoring, do feel free to use that over the liquid kind. It tends to work better. If you do, mix it with the 1/3 of a cup of sugar you are using for the second lot of sugar.",
      "At this point, there might be quite some noise ensuing from your pan. Some crackling and popping, but hopefully no snapping. It depends on how fresh your almonds were. Really fresh almonds will make a popping noise and the coat may start to crack. That's the water in the almonds escaping. If the almonds are older, there won't be as much of that!",
      "Keep stirring until the almonds are fairly shiny, but still a bit lumpy. You don't want them completely smooth. The best ones are the ones that are shiny in some areas with some delicious lumps of cinnamon sugar on other parts of the almond.",
      "As soon as you see that happening, take them off the heat and transfer the almonds to a sheet of parchment paper. Spread them apart as much as you can, but don't worry about some of them sticking together initially. BE CAREFUL, however. These are extremely hot, so only use a spoon. These babies can really burn you!",

Finish by adding the 1 teaspoon of vanilla and fold to combine; keep warm.",
      "Next, prepare the crepes by heating a small, non-stick pan over medium-high heat. Add the remaining 3 tablespoons of melted butter and swirl to coat the pan. Then pour a 2 ounce amount of the batter into the pan, swirling gently to form a thin layer. Allow the batter to heat and set for about 30 seconds or until light-golden on the bottom. Using a spatula, gently pull the edges away from the pan and flip the crepe over, allowing the bottom side to cook for about 20 seconds more. Remove crepe from pan and place onto a plate to hold. Repeat process until all of the batter is used, making about 12 crepes. Keep the completed crepes warm.",
      "Finally, fill 2 crepes (per person) with the Buttered-Rum Banana filling. Roll up the crepe, then top with a drizzling of the chocolate ganache, a dollop of the Chantilly Cream and a sprinkling of the chopped nuts as garnish. (Remaining crepes can be refrigerated or frozen.)"

      "Form the dough into an 8-inch circle. Take a knife and cut 8 wedges. Place the wedges on a buttered or parchment lined baking sheet. Bake for 16 to 18 minutes, turning the sheet halfway through. They should be golden and the bottoms should be slightly golden too. Allow to cool on the sheet for about two minutes then transfer to a wire rack to finish cooling. Or just dig in right then and there.",
      "* By the way, that photo is of little baby scones that I made for my class. Every weekend I've been making them into wedges but it always slips my mind to take a photo of them. The little baby scones were about an inch size circle and took about 8 to 12 minutes to bake. Mini love.",
      "** If you wish to freeze these, prepare them so they are sliced and ready for the oven on a baking sheet but place them in the freezer instead. Freeze them for about 30 minutes and then transfer the frozen scones to a freezer bag. When ready to bake them, do not defrost them. Just heat up the oven and put the frozen scones on a lined or butter baking sheet and bake away. They may take a few minutes longer to bake.",

They are two options: trim edge flush with pie plate (as I did) or leave a 3/4 inch overhang for crimping. Sprinkle over remaining 1/2 tablespoon of cornstarch directly over the bottom crust and brush to spread over bottom and sides. Add fruit filling over crust. Dot with butter. Brush top and inner edges of bottom crust with egg wash.",

Fold back alternating pieces of dough halfway up the pie. Place one long strip across the center, in the opposite direction of the other pieces of dough. Unfold the strips so they lay over the strip just placed down. Fold back the opposite pieces of dough and place another strip spaced evenly apart from the last strip set down. Unfold strips. Repeat with remaining strips of dough to create a basket weave pattern. If bottom crust is cut flush to pie plate, press strips into bottom crust and trim off all extra dough. If you left an overhang, trim excess dough from top strips and press into bottom crust. Then fold over bottom crust and crimp as desired.",
      "Place pie plate in the freezer for 10 minutes. Remove from freezer and place on a baking sheet. Brush top with egg wash and sprinkle over a generous amount of turbinado sugar. Bake on the center rack of the oven for 60-70 minutes or until well-browned and filling is bubbling. Place pie plate over wire rack and cool completely, for several hours, before serving. Store in fridge. Enjoy."

Spread some strawberry strips over the buttercream and add the second cake layer on top. Spread 1/3 of the buttercream over the top of that layer then add the third cake layer on top. Spread the remaining buttercream over the last layer and decorate with the remaining strawberries and some rosemary sprigs if you like. Keep in the fridge until you eat it."

If you have time, you could let this mixture sit in the fridge for a few days which helps break down the fruit, but this works just as well.",
      "While you're waiting for the rhubarb mixture, do 2 things. Place a few small spoons in the freezer to use as a jam tester later on in the process. And sterilize your jars according to safe canning practices (see related blog link for details).",
      "Once your rhubarb is ready, scoop the sugar, juice and fruit into a large pot with high sides (or a jam pan if you have one). Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Once it starts to bubble and get a little foamy you've entered into Phase 1 of the jam cooking process. Stir the mixture to make sure nothing is sticking. Skim off any foam that forms during the process.",
      "As you enter the second phase of cooking the liquid will start to really reduce. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking. If you notice it's starting to stick, turn down the heat very slightly.",
      "As the third phase starts you'll notice the bubbles are more concentrated in wells and come out from the side of the pan. It will still have some liquid when it's close to being done and will firm up once cooled. The whole cooking process should take about 15-20 minutes.",
      "To test for doneness, turn off the heat and dip one of your freezer spoons into the jam. Put it back in the freezer and wait a few minutes. Take the spoon out and if the consistency is like syrup, you need to cook it a few minutes more. Test it again after a few minutes. The jam should move very slowly down the spoon when done and should have a jammy consistency.",
      "To store your jam you have a couple options. The least complex option is what I favor.",
      "Take your clean jars and remove the lids. Put the glass sections on a jelly roll pan and bake them for about 10 minutes at 350 F. This sterilizes them and prevents them from breaking when you pour hot jam in them!",
      "When filling the jars, leave at least 1\" of space between the top of the jam and the lid. That air will create the suction to seal the jars as the jam cools and allow for expansion if you're freezing it. After filling the jars, make sure the rims are clean. Screw on the tops. As the jelly cools to room temp the jars will seal themselves.",
      "I like to keep my jars in the back of the refrigerator where it's the coldest. The jam should last for about a month.",

      "Next, crumble the crumbly goodness over the fruit evenly. Into the hot oven goes your creation. I baked mine for 45 minutes. But really, all ovens are different. Try 30 minutes first. Look at the bottom of the dish. Can you see all the tasty juices bubbling yet? Is your crumble getting nicely browned? If you answer 'yes' to both, take it out. If not, keep it in for the rest of the time. When it is done, let it rest for about 15 minutes if you can. This will let juices thicken a bit more. And it's good for your patience. A little bit of waiting now and then is good for you. I'm so glad that I decided to use sugar. It was worth it."

      "A brief word about jam choices. My cousin made these cookies with Smucker's Seedless Red Raspberry jam. I used the same, but I also wanted to try some different flavors. I really had my heart set on strawberry rhubarb, because I love strawberry rhubarb pie in the summer, but the rhubarb season is so darn short. When I tasted my cousin's cookies for the first time, I thought how perfect it would be to capture that flavor in a cookie that could be enjoyed all year round. There are several recipes out there for homemade strawberry rhubarb jam, but I admit, I was intimidated. Luckily, I found what I was looking for\u007f-in the mall, of all places-at Harry and David's. They carry a strawberry rhubarb conserve which is available all year. It has chunks of fruit in it, but they can be reduced with a few seconds in the food processor if you want (or you can do what I did and just scoop the jam out from between the fruit bits). If you have a store in your local mall, check them out. Besides the strawberry rhubarb, there were a few other jam varieties in there that I had my eye on for future cookie-making, including: bing cherry, marionberry, blackberry, and blueberry. There are also some lovely apple and pumpkin butters that might be good for the autumn; I'll be looking into those in a few months. If you don't have a store at your local mall, you can visit the Harry and David website. I'm sure other places sell similar jams and preserves, but not having tried them, I can't vouch for anything else available online. If anyone has a line on some good and varied jams, let me know!",
      "This recipe can be made entirely in a food processor, or with a stand mixer and paddle. I used the mixer because I didn't feel like cleaning my food processor. They came out great, so don't worry if you don't have a processor.",
      "1. Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F.",
      "2. In a small bowl, whisk the egg yolks and vanilla together, set aside.",
      "3. Combine the flour and granulated sugar in a mixer with the paddle attachment or in a food processor/mixer and process just to blend.",
      "For the mixer: sprinkle the butter onto the flour/sugar mixture and mix on medium until the mixture looks crumbly. This won't take long. Add in the egg mixture and mix until the dough pulls away from the side of the bowl.",
      "For the processor: with the machine running, add the butter 2-3 pieces at a time and process until the mixture looks crumbly. With the machine still running, add the egg yolk mixture and process until blended and the dough begins to pull away from the sides of the bowl.",
      "4. Refrigerate until chilled, about 30 minutes. I usually leave it in the bowl and cover the top with Saran wrap.",
      "5. Line cookie sheets with parchment paper.",
      "6. Using a #60 scoop, scoop out dough and roll it into a ball with your hands. Place dough balls on the sheet.",
      "7. Flour the back of a 1/2-teaspoon measuring spoon (you will have to keep reapplying the flour), and push the back of the spoon into the cookie until the dough is pushed up even with the rim of the spoon. Be careful not to push all the way through. The cookies will crack a little bit, which isn't tragic as long as the walls of the imprint are intact-otherwise, the filling will run out while baking. If they crack too much, repair as best you can, or re-roll the cookie and try again.",
      "8. Using a spoon or a pastry bag fitted with a plain tip, fill each indentation with about 1/4 teaspoon jam.",
      "9. Bake the cookies until the edges are golden, about 15-20 minutes.",
      "10. Let the cookies cool completely before transferring the cooled cookies to wire racks.",
      "I had the fleeting thought that a dab of peanut butter underneath the jam would be perfection. My husband insists that this is over the top, but I think I will try it anyway."

You an always add more the next time you make them if you approve of the bourbon flavor. It is a distinctive flavor, it is definitely not for everyone.

    "directions": [
      "Rhubarb season in the Northeast US is pretty short, from April-May and fresh rhubarb is preferable when available. However, many grocery stores also carry frozen rhubarb, which will do nicely as well. I've read differing opinions on whether the rhubarb should be thawed first and patted dry of excess moisture, or whether it should just be dumped into the pie and cooking time extended. Not having tried this pie with frozen rhubarb, I'm not sure which is better, but I have a feeling that either will work as long as you watch your pie to make sure the filling is bubbling and the crust edge isn't overly brown (use a shield or aluminum foil around the edge if necessary). If you choose to fully thaw frozen rhubarb, however, definitely drain it before using. If you choose not to thaw first, I would just toss the rhubarb (and strawberries) with the flour and cornstarch before adding anything else.",
      "If you are concerned about the bottom crust getting soggy, there are 3 good options that should work: 1) bake the pie on the bottom rack; 2) pre-bake the bottom crust for about 10 minutes at 425F (with weights and an edge shield); 3) spread about 1/2 to 1 Tablespoons of flour on the bottom of the bottom crust before adding the filling.",
      "This pie recipe is presented 2 ways: one version has egg beaten into it, which results in a slightly custardy and delicious pie; while the other leaves out the egg and is strictly fruit-based. I prefer the egg beaten in, but they are both delicious. I include both ways because I made the egg-less pie first, and then I tried the pie with egg in the filling. The remainder of the ingredients are the same, except that you add an extra tablespoon of cornstarch to the egg-less pie to help it thicken. Cooking times/temperatures are the same for both.",
      "Directions:",
      "1. Decide whether you want to pre-treat the bottom crust (see above).",
      "2. Preheat the oven to 425F.",
      "3. If using egg, beat 2 eggs and 1 1/2 cups sugar until fluffy (I used a whisk).",
      "4. Add the flour, cornstarch, salt, cinnamon and vanilla into the egg/sugar mixture (or just the 1 1/2 cups sugar if you don't want to use egg).",
      "5. Mix in the fruit and toss to coat.",
      "6. Pour the filling into the bottom crust, and dot on the butter.",
      "7. Brush bottom pie crust with egg wash (1 egg white beaten with 1 teaspoon of water).",
      "8. Cover with the top crust, crimping to seal. Brush egg wash over the top crust and sprinkle with the remaining 2 tablespoons sugar.",
      "9. Collar pie with foil or shield, and bake for 15 minutes at 425F.",
      "10. Without opening the door, lower the oven temperature to 375F and bake for an additional 45 minutes or so, until the filling is bubbling and the crust is golden.",
      "10. Let the filling cool before serving. It needs time to thicken up a bit.",

      "With the dough hook attachment, blend the butter, eggs, and salt into the yeast mixture. Scrape down the sides of the bowl if needed and don't worry if it's not totally mixed. Gradually add the flour and beat at medium speed until a soft dough forms that just pulls away from the sides of the bowl. Then beat until the dough is soft and supple, about 10 minutes longer. (If you do not have a stand mixer with a hook attachment, knead the dough by hand in this step.)",
      "Gather the dough into a ball and transfer it to a lightly greased bowl, turning dough once to grease all sides. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let sit in a warm, draft-free place until doubled in size, about 1 hour.",

Spread cranberry sauce evenly over the rolled dough, leaving a border around the edge of the dough. Then sprinkle on chocolate chips and orange zest. Tightly roll up the dough, starting from a long side of the rectangle, to form a 24-inch-long log. Cut into 15 even rolls (about 1.5 inches thick each). Arrange them in the prepared baking pan, cut sides up. Cover the dish of rolls with plastic wrap that you've sprayed lightly with cooking spray and let them rise in a warm place until they are puffy, 1.5 - 2 hours.",
      "When done rising, preheat the oven to 375 F. Remove the plastic wrap and put the dish into the oven. Bake for 25 minutes, until they are golden and the tops are firm to the touch. Transfer the pan to a rack to cool for about 15 minutes before glazing, or let rolls cool completely before freezing.",
      "For the glaze: In a small bowl, whisk the icing sugar and orange juice until smooth, starting with 2 tablespoons and adding more if necessary to reach desired drizzling consistency. Pour glaze over the warm rolls (either fresh from the oven or microwaved-both are amazing) and serve.",
      "To make ahead: During the second rise, cover the sliced rolls with plastic wrap sprayed lightly with cooking spray and let them sit in the fridge overnight before baking. Bring to room temperature before baking. Baked rolls can be frozen in an airtight container or freezer bag for up to 3 months and warmed up to enjoy at a later date.",

      "4. Then, pull a small section of the dough off and using the heel of your hand push the dough down and away from you. You have just created a sheet of dough which is going to turn into delicious flaky crust. Scrape this section of dough off of the board and place it into a bowl to the side. Repeat with the remaining dough, a small section at a time, until you have worked through all of the dough.",
      "5. Once this is complete, gently remove the dough from the bowl and press it together. Then split it in half and wrap each half in plastic wrap and form into disks. Chill the dough for at least 1 hour before using. I chilled mine overnight. (See the related blog post for a link to a photo tutorial.)",

Fill the prepared pie shell with the rhubarb mixture and top with the second crust. Crimp the edges and cut a few vents in the top crust. Alternately, you can top the pie with a lattice-style crust as I've done in the photo above. When I make a lattice-topped pie, I like to use nice thick strips of dough, so the ones pictured above are about 1\" wide.",

      "5. Put the pie pan on a baking sheet to catch any drips and bake for 15 minutes on the lowest rack of your oven, then lower the oven temperature to 350\u00b0F and bake for 40-50 minutes or until the crust is deep golden brown and the rhubarb juices bubble.

I pulverized mine pretty well because I wanted it to be easily spreadable. If your marmalade has finer bits of zest to begin with, you probably won't have to go crazy with the blender, you don't want to totally puree it. Then, add in the spices and vanilla if using. If you are using a flavored marmalade, you might want to skip the spices and vanilla, your call. Grease and line a 9x5 loaf pan with parchment.",

Use a brush or spoon to spread the 4 tablespoons of melted butter onto the dough, then gently spread the marmalade mixture on top. You want a very, very thin layer of marmalade so you may need a bit less than 8 ounces total.",
      "6. Slice the dough into 6 vertical strips, then stack the strips on top of each other. Slice the stack into 6 squarish pieces. Lay the stacks of dough in the prepared loaf pan so the layers are visible, like the pages of a book. Cover the pan and let the dough rise until almost doubled again, 30-45 minutes.",

With the mixer on low speed, pour the liquid mixture into the dry mixture and mix until the dry ingredients are moistened. Stop the mixer, scrape down to the bottom of the bowl to make sure all of the dry ingredients are incorporated, then turn the mixer up to medium and mix for 2 minutes.",
      "3. Turn the mixer back down to low and slowly pour in the coffee. Stop the mixer and scrape down to the bottom of the bowl and finish the stirring by hand.",
      "4. Pour the mixture into the prepared pans and bake for 20-25 minutes or until a cake tester comes out clean.",
      "5. Then remove the cakes from the oven and allow them to cool in the pan for 15 minutes. Then invert cakes onto a rack to cool completely.",
      "For the frosting:",
      "This frosting has two components that will be prepared separately (Chocolate Ganache and Swiss Meringue Buttercream) then mixed together.",
      "For the ganache",
      "1. Place the chopped chocolate in a large bowl. In a small saucepan heat the heavy cream over medium heat until just before it boils. Pour the hot cream over the chocolate and cover the bowl with plastic wrap. Let the mixture sit for 5 minutes, then whisk until smooth. Whisk in the vanilla, coffee and salt then set aside to cool until it is cool but still soft. Don't let it harden completely or you will not be able to whip it into the frosting.",
      "For the Swiss Buttercream:",
      "1. In the bowl of a stand mixer (or another bowl that will fit over a pan of simmering water-double boiler style), mix to combine the egg whites and sugar. Then set the bowl over a pan of simmering water and whisk continuously until the sugar has dissolved and the mixture is warm to the touch, 5-7 minutes.",
      "2. Then remove from heat and use the whisk attachment of your mixer to beat the egg white mixture until stiff glossy peaks form and the mixture has cooled to room temperature, about 10 minutes.",
      "3. Switch to the paddle attachment and reduce the speed to low and add the salt, then add butter a few tablespoons at a time and beat the frosting until smooth. During this step it is very likely that the frosting will \"break\" and you will think you messed up. Good news! You didn't! Mine breaks sometimes too. All you have to do is turn up the speed on your mixer for a few seconds and the frosting comes back together. Continue until all of the butter is incorporated then add in the vanilla.",
      "To make the Chocolate Swiss Buttercream:",
      "1. Whip the room temperature ganache into the meringue buttercream until no lumps remain. The finished buttercream will be glossy, smooth and fluffy.",

      "Peel the parchment paper from the cake layers and trim the cakes so the tops are flat. Place one layer onto a serving platter or pedestal and spread about 1 1/2 cup of the frosting onto the cake in an even layer. Place the second cake layer on top and repeat by frosting that layer in the same manner. Finish by placing the last layer on top, trimmed side down so the top of the cake will be nice and flat and crumb free. Cover the top and sides of the cake with a thin layer of frosting (crumbcoat) and refrigerate for about 30 minutes.",
      "Pull the cake out of the fridge and add a second, heavier coat of frosting on the top and sides of the cake. Garnish with cacao nibs and chocolate sprinkles.",

      "Use this as you would like any other barbecue sauce. For me, well, my kids are really into pulled pork. So that is the direction I went with this. We love eating pulled pork sandwiches by steaming lotus leaf buns that you can purchase in the frozen section of your local Asian market. Basically you steam them for about 10 minutes, open them up, and pile your pork in there. Top with the sauce and eat. My kids tore through these like they were going out of style, and the rhubarb barbecue sauce is pretty fantastic. It's sweet, with a bit of tart, and to me, that is a pretty amazing sauce when you can get that type of balance.",
      "So if you have rhubarb growing in the backyard, or if you find some at your local farmer's market, pick some up and make this barbecue sauce. I know you will love it! Plus it is a nice surprise that your family or guests will be inquiring about."

I typically measure the thickness by running a wooden spoon in the jam and seeing how well it sticks to the spoon. Once thickened, remove the jam from the heat, and let cool on the stove.",
      "Once cooled, pour into a large mason jar, and place in the refrigerator. My wife and kids loved this jam, and heck, so did I. I'm not much into sweet stuff, but this was a bit addicting. I should say my friends and neighbors loved the rhubarb and strawberry jam as well. You can process this using standard canning practices if you like. However I just placed it in the mason jar and refrigerated it. It lasted for several weeks.",
      "One of the uses beyond spreading this on toast or peanut butter sandwiches was to spread it on some brie cheese and warm it in the oven until the cheese starts to melt. I served that with some chopped apples for an appetizer. It was heavenly. If you are looking for ways to use rhubarb, give this one a shot."

      "Turn oven on and let the oven begin to heat up for 3 or 4 minutes, then turn the heat off and leave the door closed. Warming the oven this way will give your dough excellent conditions for rising.",
      "In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook, add the warm water and sprinkle in 1 tablespoon of sugar and the yeast. Let mixture sit for 10 minutes. After 10 minutes, yeast mixture should have grown and become frothy. If it has not grown, then your yeast is dead and you must start over with either a new batch of yeast, or perhaps your water temperature was too hot and it accidentally killed the yeast. Either way, try again.",
      "To the yeast mixture, add 4 cups of flour, remaining sugar, salt, oil, and eggs. Turn mixer on low and mix until incorporated. Add 2 more cups of flour; mix again. Add 1 more cup of flour; mix again. Increase speed to medium and mix until dough is well combined. Continue mixing for several minutes. Dough should begin to pull away from the sides of the bowl. If dough is too sticky and does not pull away from the sides, add an additional 1/4 cup of flour at a time until it begins to pull away. The dough should still be slightly sticky and not completely dry. (You can do these steps by hand like they used to before the invention of stand mixers but I'm lazy so I use the mixer.)",
      "Transfer dough to a well-floured surface. Knead dough with your hands for 50 to 75 turns. Be careful that you don't add too much flour to the dough. Just sprinkle the dough with flour as needed so that it doesn't stick to your hands.",
      "Transfer dough to a lightly oiled, large bowl that will leave plenty of room for the dough to grow. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and then a tea towel and place it in the warmed oven. Do not turn the oven back on. Insert a wooden spoon or similar object in the oven door to prevent it from closing all the way. This will allow a small amount of the heat to escape. You don't want to cook the dough but you want to ensure that it is just warm it enough for the dough to rise. Let the dough rise for 45 minutes or until it has doubled in size. Once it has risen, punch it down, cover it again, and place it back in the oven to repeat the process. You do not need to \"reheat\" the oven.",
      "Once dough has risen a second time, remove dough from the oven and set it aside while you prepare your baking dishes. Smear a generous amount (about 4 tablespoons per pan) of butter on the bottom and sides of three 8x8 or 9x9 glass baking dishes. You can also use 9x13 baking dishes if that's what you have. Sprinkle 1/3 cup brown sugar on the bottom of each pan. Set the pans aside.",
      "Divide dough into three equal portions. This makes it easier to roll and will give you uniform-sized buns. On a lightly floured surface, roll one portion into a rectangular shape measuring approximately 8 x 12. Spread 2 to 3 tablespoons of soft butter all over the dough. Sprinkle with 1/4 cup of brown sugar and 1 to 2 tablespoons of ground cinnamon. Beginning on the long side, roll the dough towards the opposite side. Once you reach the other side, pinch the end of the dough to the roll to form a seal. Use a sharp knife to cut straight down in the center of the roll. Cut each half in half again to form 4 equal-sized rolls. Transfer the rolls to the pan, cover with a tea towel and set aside. Repeat on the remaining two portions of dough. Let the buns rest for 15 minutes.",

      "You will also need:",
      "1. A food processor fitted with the rotary blade attachment.",
      "2. A large bowl.",
      "3. A medium-size bowl.",
      "4. A pie pan with a 9-inch base, 2-inches deep.",
      "5. A pastry board and rolling pin.",
      "6. A pastry wheel or knife.",
      "Ingredient note: The amount of water may vary, since not all flours are the same and altitude and humidity may also affect the amount of liquid required. Add a little more or less to make a dough that is soft and very pliable but not crumbly.",
      "Timing note: The pie is best if made a day in advance and allowed to cool at room temperature overnight. A pie of this kind, straight from the oven, is very tasty, but can't be successfully cut into slices.",
      "For the pie crust dough:",
      "1. Pour the flour, salt and baking powder into the bowl of the food processor. Pulse to mix them.",
      "2. Add the butter and the shortening. Cut them into the flour by pressing the Pulse button on and off until the mixture is well combined.",
      "3. Mix together the ice water and cider vinegar. Turn on the processor and, with one hand pressed firmly down on the lid of it, pour the liquid slowly through the tube. Pressing down on the lid prevents any jerky motion of the processor as the dough forms.",
      "4. As soon as the mixture pulls away from the sides of the processor and forms a cohesive mass, turn off the machine.",
      "5. Test the texture of the dough before removing it from the processor. If it feels a little dry and is not soft and pliable, add a few more drops of water. The dough requires no lengthy refrigeration before rolling out, but it may be wrapped in plastic and refrigerated briefly while making the filling. (If the dough is refrigerated for longer than about 30 minutes, the butter in it will harden and the dough will have to be softened at room temperature before it can be rolled out.)",
      "For the pie filling:",
      "1. In a large bowl, combine the strawberries and rhubarb.",
      "2. In a medium-sized bowl, mix together the sugar, cornstarch, cinnamon and nutmeg.",
      "3. Pour the sugar mixture over the fruit and mix everything together well. Add the 1 beaten egg and toss the fruit around to blend it in. Set the bowl of filling aside while you roll out the pie crust.",
      "Assembling and baking the pie:",
      "1. Preheat the oven to 400 F and position the oven rack in the lower third of the oven.",
      "2. On a lightly floured pastry board, roll out half the dough into a circle that will fit into the pie pan with a 1-inch overhang. fit the round of dough into the pan.",
      "3. Roll out the second half of dough into a circle of similar size to the first one. With a pastry wheel or knife, cut the round into 1/2-inch strips.",
      "4. Pour the filling into the pastry-lined pan.",
      "5. Weave the lattice crust (this is the fun part): Lay half of the pastry strips horizontally across the pie filling 1-inch apart. Place a long strip vertically down through the center of the pie, and weave it over and under the horizontal strips, gently folding back every other horizontal strip and placing the vertical strip beneath it. Work out from the center, placing the vertical strips about 1-inch apart and weaving each one over and under in the same way as you did the first one. Note: If the long center vertical strip crosses OVER the corresponding long horizontal one in the center of the pie, then the vertical strips on either side of it will cross UNDER the long horizontal one.",
      "6. Trim any overhang from the strips to the edge of the pie pan.",
      "7. Fold the overhang from the bottom crust up over the edges of the strips, all around the rim of the pan, pressing the overhang to seal it over the strips and form a pastry border all around the rim of the pie.",
      "8. Crimp the border using your fingers.",
      "9. Brush the lattice and crimped border with the egg wash (egg combined with the water) and bake the pie for 40-45 minutes, or until the crust is golden.",
      "10. Cool the pie at room temperature before cutting it. A pitcher of sweetened (or unsweetened) fresh cream is a nice accompaniment. Especially if it comes from the hands of a friend.",

    "title": "blueberry rhubarb pie",
    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "To make the dough:",
      "1. Cut the butter into small pieces and break them apart. (I like to cut the stick lengthwise, turn it 90 degrees, and then cut it lengthwise again, so I have 4 long sticks. Then I cut regular tablespoon-size pats, so I end up with a bunch of 1/4 Tablespoon pieces.) Put the well-separated pieces of butter into a bowl and place it in the freezer for about 30-40 minutes, or until they are just barely frozen through.",
      "2. In a medium bowl, mix together the flour, sugar, and salt. Add the frozen butter and gently work it into the flour with your fingertips. Since it's frozen, you'll have to kind of smush it into the dry mix. Use your finger muscles! The butter will be incorporated enough when you have small pea-sized bits of butter left.",
      "3. Add the very, very cold water and stir it into the mixture. This shouldn't be enough moisture to bring the dough together, so add the Goldshlager 1 Tablespoon at a time until the dough will just form into a ball. Divide the dough evenly into two balls. Wrap each ball tightly in plastic wrap and squish it into the shape of a round disc, like a giant hockey puck.",
      "4. Chill the dough in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours, but overnight is okay too.",
      "To make the pie:",
      "1. In a bowl, combine the blueberries, rhubarb, sugar, tapioca starch, lemon zest, lemon juice, cinnamon, salt, and brandy. Mix until everything is incorporated and the fruit is well coated. Set aside.",
      "2. Remove one hockey puck of dough from the refrigerator. On a very well floured surface, roll out the dough evenly until it is big enough to cover your pie plate, plus a 1/2 inch or so. This is best achieved by constantly turning and flipping your dough so it doesn't stick to your surface. Don't be afraid to add too much flour, you can't. Transferring to the pie plate can be tricky. I like to fold the dough in half, and then in half again, and then transfer the quarter wedge to the plate and carefully unfold it. But use whatever method you like.",
      "3. Gently press the dough into the plate and trim off any dough overhanging more than a 1/2 inch over the plate. Using the excess bits to fill any holes or imperfections you have. Remember, you won't see the bottom crust, but you'll taste any spots where there's missing dough. Pour the blueberry mixture over the bottom crust and set aside.",
      "4. Remove the second hockey puck of dough from the refrigerator, and roll it out the same way you did the first one. When it is big enough to cover the pie with at least a 1/2 inch overhang, figure out what's going to be the center. You need to make vents in the top crust for the steam to escape. I cut a hole about the size of a shot glass in the very center, but it can be anywhere. You'll want at least one. I also cut a few smaller holes around the edges. When the dough is properly ventilated, carefully cover the pie, and again trim any excess. Tuck the two crusts under so it is flush with the plate. Using your fingers or a fork, crimp all the way around the edge of the pie so it's sealed. Cut a few more vents in the crust. Put the pie in the refrigerator to chill for about 20 minutes.",
      "5. While the pie chills, preheat your oven to 425 degrees and move the rack to the lower third of your oven. If you're worried about filling bubbling over and making a mess you can put a cookie sheet under the rack to catch any drippings.",
      "6. Beat the egg and milk together and brush evenly over the top of the chilled pie, making sure none of it pools. When the oven is ready, bake for 30 minutes, then knock the heat down to 375 degrees and bake for another 30 minutes. If the pie starts to get too brown before it is finished baking, cover it loosely with foil (I did this about 45 minutes in). The pie is finished baking when the crust is golden brown and the filling is thick and bubbling.",
      "7. Let the pie sit and fully cool before cutting into it to give the filling time to come together, at least 4 hours. Don't jump the gun, you'll regret it!"

It will change from a splashy liquid, to going quite frothy. When it starts to get frothy, that means that it is close to being done. Remove it from the heat and let the froth die down a bit and check to see if the rhubarb mixture is done by coating the back of a wooden spoon with it and running your finger through it. If your finger mark remains, it is ready. If the liquid starts to run back together, keep cooking it for a little while longer.",

When it feels quite cool to the touch and it has visibly thickened to the point that the lines made when you stir it don't disappear right away, you can take it out of the fridge. The faster way to cool it down is to put lots of ice and water in a larger bowl and set the bowl with the rhubarb mixture in it and whisk constantly for about 5 minutes. It will cool down quickly and start to thicken much faster. Once it starts to thicken and is cold to the touch, take the rhubarb mixture bowl out of the ice water bowl. Set it aside. If it continues to get thick, just whisk it vigorously before you add the beaten egg whites.",
      "In a clean bowl, whisk the egg whites using a stand mixer or electric beaters until very frothy and then slowly start adding the other half of the sugar as you continue to whisk. Keep beating the egg whites until you get stiff peaks. Take 1/4 of the stiff egg whites and stir it into the cold, thickened rhubarb mixture to lighten it up a little bit. Once the first bit of egg whites is incorporated, add the rest of the egg whites and gently fold the egg whites in using a rubber spatula until there are no streaks of the darker rhubarb mixture.",
      "Once the two parts are incorporated, spoon the mousse into 6 dessert bowls or champagne glasses and refrigerate for at least 2 hours before serving. Serve with a dollop of lightly sweetened whipped cream if desired.",
      "Note: For those with sensitivities, this does include raw eggs. Use pasteurized egg whites if serving this to anyone who shouldn't eat raw egg whites. Save the four egg whites and freeze them to be used in a recipe that calls for cooked egg whites, such as a pavlova."

Pulse the blender until those ingredients are combined. Now turn back to the melted butter (which you made sure not to boil). Pop the middle out of the top of the blender, and while the blender runs on a middle-high setting (I think I use \"whip\"), SLOWLY pour in your hot, melted butter. The sauce should come together almost instantly, thickening and turning a nice medium yellow color.",

Each muffin half gets a slice of Canadian bacon and a poached egg (make sure to run a small rubber scraper around each egg so it will easily turn out of its cup).
