      "You will need 2 Litres of good chicken stock or, in the absence of the home made nectar prepare the liquid using chicken stock cubes. Not having the proper stuff will give a less tastier dish. So please, please have a bash at making your own. It is so easy and quick and tastes so much better. Check out the recipe #71349 which works well or one of the others. If you haven't got your own carcass then ask one of your friends to give you theirs as most people just bin them. Your stock needs to be gently simmering before you start the rice.",
      "Melt butter in a large pan and add the onion (finely minced) and also the garlic (ideally minced also). Don't allow to brown or colour. Make sure the garlic/onion is minced very fine to avoid the 'if this has got onion in it I am not eating it!' comments. Have tried making without but it is needed for flavour.",
      "Add the rice. Note that for this recipe it called for long grain rice and not arborio. Please try the recipe as it is as it does work and quantities for liquid are correct.",
      "Immediately the rice has been stirred well add almost all the stock. Most recipes will call for adding the stock bit by bit but (from experience) I can tell you that the quantity of liquid will be correct and life is definitely too short to stand over a hot stove! Specially now online poker has been invented. So add about 3/4 of the stock and bring to simmer. You can't do this with arborio rice but the long grain rice makes the constant stirring and dribbling of hot stock unneccesary. Cover and cook until all liquid is absorbed and your rice is 'nearly there'. If you are timing this it should be about 15/20 minutes after the stock was added.",
      "Add approx 1lb of chicken left overs (cut into cubes), the zest and juice of two lemons, the peas and rest of the stock if you feel it is needed. Season well and give the cooking time an extra few minutes.",
      "This dish doesn't really need parmesan but a small amount of fresh parsley could be added. It is beautifully light and tasty. Not an 'elegant' dish but my children absolutely love it and the flavour is good considering the few ingredients.",
      "Freeze left-overs after adding a tiny bit more stock to leave it a bit 'soupy' to avoid it getting stodge when it cools.",

Transfer the dough to a lightly greased bowl or dough-rising bucket, cover the bowl or bucket, and allow the dough to rise till puffy though not necessarily doubled in bulk, about 1 hour, depending on the warmth of your kitchen. Gently fold the dough in upon itself and turn it upside-down after 30 minutes; this \"turn\" helps eliminate some of the excess carbon dioxide and redistributes the yeast's food, both imperative for optimum yeast growth.",

      "Cut the chicken into 1/4 inch strips (don't fuss with being even), wash, drain and set aside. Crack both eggs into another bowl and toss in the black pepper and salt and give it a whisk. We now have the chicken cut into pieces, the seasoned crumbs and eggs. It's time to set up a batter and frying station. We'll need the veg oil in a deep pan (I used a small wok so the oil doesn't splatter onto the stove while frying) on med/high heat, a plate with the flour, the seasoned crumbs, the chicken strips, egg wash and have a paper towel lined plate or basket to drain off the excess oil when the chicken strips are done cooking.",
      "Take a piece of chicken and dust it in the flour, then into the eggs (make sure it's covered in the eggs mix) and drain off the excess egg and roll in the seasoned bread crumbs. Do about 4-5 of these so once you start adding to the hot oil, you'll have a few to go in at the same time.",
      "Your oil should be hot by now, so gently place each strip inches Flip after a couple minutes and keep an eye on them. If you find that they're browning too fast, turn your heat down a bit. It takes about 5-7 minutes to fully cook and have that lovely golden brown color. Drain on the paper towels and continue until all the chicken strips are cooked. Sprinkle (while hot) with a little sea salt (not mentioned in the ingredient list)."

      "Put the pork into a saucepan with enough water to cover and salt to taste. Cover and simmer until the meat is tender, about 30 minutes. Heat the lard or vegetable oil in a skillet and saute the onion, bell pepper, and garlic until the onion is soft. If using the pimientos, add with the tomatoes. Add the tomatoes and cook until the mixture is quite thick, about 5 minutes. Drain the pork and reserve the stock. Add the onion and tomato mixture to the pork with the oregano, cloves, salt and pepper to taste, the chopped egg whites, olives, raisins, capers, and sherry, mixing well.",
      "Remove the cheese shell and lid from the water, drain and pat dry. Divide the meat mixture into three parts. Put one-third of it into the cheese, patting it down firmly. Halve the egg yolks. Make a layer of 6 halved yolks on top of the meat. Spoon in another third of the meat mixture and pat down lightly. Make a layer of the remaining 6 halved egg yolks, and top with the rest of the meat mixture. Place the lid on the cheese and rub the cheese all over with lard or oil. Wrap it in a double layer of cheesecloth, then place on a rack in a steamer, and steam over boiling water for 40 minutes.",
      "Meanwhile prepare the sauce: Heat the butter in a saucepan. Add the flour and cook, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, for a minute. Do not let the flour brown. Add the reserved pork stock, making up the quantity with water to 2 cups, if necessary. Add the saffron the bell pepper or pimientos, salt and pepper to taste, and the olives. Cook, stirring frequently, for 15 minutes. Pour over the cheese just before serving.",
      "Lift the cheese out of the steamer and remove the cheesecloth. Place the cheese on a warmed serving platter and pour the sauce over it. To serve, cut the cheese in wedges. Serves 6 to 8.",

      "Using the re-sealable bag as a pastry bag, stuff each slice of bread with about 2 tablespoons of the cream cheese mixture. Once the slices are stuffed, place each slice into the milk and egg mixture for about 10 seconds per side. Once the slices are coated with the custard base, place them into the skillet to brown. Work in batches. Cook each slice of stuffed French toast until golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes per side. If cooking a large batch, transfer the cooked French toast to a baking sheet and keep warm in a 200 degree F oven while you cook the rest of the slices. Repeat the process with the remaining French toast. Serve warm, topped with extra berries, powdered sugar and maple syrup.",

Once the fruit has cooked, add it to the smaller bowl and set it in the ice bath to cool. As the fruit cools it should become gel-like. Once the jam has cooled it can be stored."

Thin crackers will be crispy whereas thick crackers will be chewy. Put cracker sheets in dehydrator at 110 degrees (or on cookie sheet in oven at lowest setting and door open). Remove after about 2-4 hours and score crackers for breaking and return. Flip crackers onto screen as soon as they can be handled without breaking (after about 6-12 hours) and return until crisp (another 12-24 hours).

      "In food processor fitted with steel blade, combine 3/4 cup nuts and 3 tablespoons sugar (reserve remaining sugar). Process by \"pulsing\" on-and-off just until nuts are finely ground. Place in a small bowl. Add cornstarch and mix in thoroughly with fingers. Cover and set aside.",
      "Adjust racks to divide oven into thirds; preheat oven to 225 degrees F. Line two large (17\" by 12\") baking sheets with parchment paper. On each piece of parchment, trace a 10\" diameter circle. Set aside.",
      "Make sure that large bowl of electric mixer is absolutely clean and grease-free; place room-temperature egg whites into this bowl. Fit mixer with whisk beater, if available. Sift cream of tartar into egg whites. Start beating whites at low speed, then gradually increase speed to high. Beat until whites are increased in volume and very foamy.",
      "Gradually, add 1 cup sugar about 2 tablespoons at a time, reducing mixer speed to low while adding and sprinkling in each addition. Increase speed to high in between additions, and beat for about 15 seconds. When all sugar has been added, increase speed to high, and beat meringue just until stiff peaks form. It will be very thick. Remove from mixer. By hand, with large spatula, fold in ground nut mixture only until combined.",
      "Now, working quickly, place small dabs of this meringue under the parchment paper at two opposite corners on each baking sheet, then replace parchment paper on sheet (the meringue will keep the parchment from sliding around). Place about half the meringue in the center of each traced circle. With a flat knife or large offset spatula, spread meringue out so that it just touches the traced circle on each piece of parchment. Make meringue surface as even as possible for each circle, but don't fuss with either for too long. As soon as one circle is done, place in preheated oven, then go back and form second circle, working quickly. Once second meringue circle is in oven, start timing. Bake the meringue disks for 2 hours, switching baking sheets back-to-front and rack-to-rack only after 90 minutes (do not open oven door before that time, or meringues may crack). TURN OVEN OFF, but allow meringues to dry out further in turned-off oven for at least 2 hours (overnight is is ok). At any time while meringues are baking or drying out, finely chop reserved 1/2 cup toasted, cooled nuts; set aside, covered.",
      "When meringues have dried out for at least 2 hours, remove from oven. Very gently peel parchment paper from baking sheet; place parchment paper, with meringue still on it, on cooling rack. Cool completely. Now, place 10\" diameter corrugated cardboard cake circle on top of one meringue. With large, very sharp, thin-bladed serrated knife, trim meringue circle, if necessary. To do so, work with a small section at a time, and saw overhanging edge of meringue very gently back-and-forth. Do not press knife down into meringue, and do not press down on cardboard cake circle. After trimming, loosen meringue from parchment with a long, thin, stiff-bladed spatula. If assembling dacquoise immediately, leave meringue circle on cooling rack. Otherwise, wrap airtight for storage. Repeat with other meringue disk.",
      "To assemble dacquoise, have ready finely chopped nuts and a flat-bottomed serving plate or foil-lined corrugated cardboard circle at least 10\" in diameter. For ganache: Combine finely chopped chocolates and salt in medium heatproof bowl. Place over hot water on low heat (water should not touch bottom of bowl); stir frequently until almost melted. Remove from heat and hot water; stir until smooth. All at once, add sour cream. With hand-held electric mixer at a low speed, beat in sour cream. If sour cream is at all cold, ganache will lump. If this happens, replace bowl over hot water and beat at a low speed almost constantly just until ganache is smooth. Remove from heat and hot water. Beat in vanilla. If ganache is too thin, allow to stand at room temperature, stirring occasionally, until of good spreading consistency. Otherwise, use immediately. Place a small dab of ganache in center of serving plate or foil-covered cardboard circle. Place the worse-looking of the two meringue circles, right side up, on the serving plate. By large spoonfuls, place about 3/4 of the ganache on top of the meringue circle; spread quickly to form an even layer. Place other meringue circle on top, right side up; press GENTLY to compact very slightly. Frost sides of dacquoise smoothly with remaining ganache (the top of this pastry is not frosted). Quickly, before ganache sets, coat sides with the finely chopped nuts, pressing them into the ganache lightly. Place in refrigerator. Chill at least 2 hours before serving.",
      "To cut, use a large, sharp, straight-edged knife. Rinse the blade under hot water and dry it after every other cut or so. Allow the cut dacquoise to stand at room temperature for about 20 minutes, loosely covered, before serving. Just before serving, sift unsweetened cocoa powder (preferably Dutch process) very lightly over the top of each slice. Store any leftovers in refrigerator, tightly covered."
