Shape into a ball. 2. Roll out on floured surface to a 20 x 8 inch rectangle. Cut in half to make two 10 x 8-inch rectangles. 3. Spread one half with peanut butter (try crunchy peanut butter if you wish); top with the apple butter. Place the second half of dough on top of first. Brush with milk and sprinkle with a little bit of granulated sugar. 4. Cut into strips 5 x 1/2 inches. Gently twist twice. Place on well-greased cookie sheets and bake in preheated 400-degree oven for 7-10 minutes or until light golden brown. Do not overbake. Serve warm or at room temperature. Makes 30 twists."

Time will depend on thickness of chicken, probably around 4-5 min per side. Once finished place on cookie sheet with wire rack and place monteray jack cheese ontop and broil until lightly brown and bubbly. Serve with marinara and maybe a side of penne or spaghetti.

After you comine the two, place the mixture in a sealed Tupperware container. You may also store in a sealed Mason Jar. Although there is sour cream in these recipes, I have found that if I store the sauces in a sealed container in the refrigerator, it will stay viable for several weeks.

What I do, is that I use a teaspoon to pour some of the raw batter over the spot, carefully \"slosh\" some of the hot oil over it with the slotted spoon to set the batter and roll it over once more to cook the spot."

      "The theory is that the more you knead the dough, the better the bread will be. But don't let it run away with you. Quite a small amount of kneading will result in excellent dough (Bread or rolls) My theory is the more you knead the dough (need the dough$$), the poorer you are. Ha! Seriously, it doesn't make that much difference whether you knead it half a day or about 5 minutes. It turns out real good at 5 - 10 minutes.",
      "FROM THIS POINT, YOU DECIDE WHAT TO MAKE WITH YOUR DOUGH AND GO FROM THERE.",
      "TO MAKE BASIC BREAD LOAVES: After you've kneaded the dough the final time, take about half as much as your loaf pan holds. Roll it roughly into the shape of a pie. Starting at any edge roll it up. Tuck up the ends under so that the roll now fits your loaf pan. The rolled \"seam\" should be on the bottom of the pan. Bake at 325 for 1 hour. This recipe should make 2 loaves.",

Spread butter (about 1/2 stick) over entire top. Sprinkle with sugar and cinnamon (about 1/2 cup sugar - 1 teaspoon cinnamon). I have used apple pie spices instead and it came out fine. Roll up very tightly and tuck ends in if they are too long for your pan. Put in a warm place and let rise to double its original size - about an hour. Bake at 325 degrees F. for 1 hour.",
      "TO MAKE PARKERHOUSE ROLLS, When making Parkerhouse rolls, remembering that your rolls will be twice the size of your original dough! Butter your muffin tins well and put 3 equal siaed rolls of your dough in each tin. Let rise to double in size. Bake at 375 degrees F. for about 25 minutes or until golden brown. Will make about 2 doz. rolls.",
      "TO MAKE BUTTERFLAKE ROLLS: Roll dough very thin, cut small rounds and put about 5 in each muffin tin, endways. Let these also rise to double in size before baking at 375 degrees F for about 25 minutes or until golden brown. Makes about 2 dozen.",
      "YOU CAN ALSO MAKE SOME VERY GOOD PECAN ROLLS: Substitute brown sugar for the white sugar in the original recipe. Butter 2 muffin tins. In the bottom of each muffin cup add these ingredients: 1 heaping teaspoon of Light Brown Sugar, 1 to 2 teaspoons of chopped nuts or 3 pecan halves. After the final rising, shape your dough into a long roll or into two 1 foot rolls. Cut the roll into 1\" slices and place each slice into a muffin cup. Let them rise until double in size and bake them at 375 degrees F. for about 2 to 30 minutes. Turn them upside down onto Aluminum foil or wax paper to cool."

If bubbles come rising up beside it, the oil is hot enough. Have a slotted spoon by your stove top as well as two paper towel-lined plates.",
