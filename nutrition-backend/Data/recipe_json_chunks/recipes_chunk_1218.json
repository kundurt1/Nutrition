If you add it to fast it will wind up lmpy, which is not real bad, but it's better if you try to keep it smooth. So slowly stir in the milk, a little at a time. When all the milk is added, break the eggs into the bowl too. You don't add the eggs before the milk because the hot cornmeal will cook them. Beat up the batter until the eggs are well incorporated. Then turn the batter into a well oiled 2-quart casserole, or 8-inch square pan, or even a ten inch iron skillet. Bake the bread at 375F for abot40 minutes. The top will be nicely browned and the mixture will jiggle a little bit when you shake the pan. Take it out of the oven and serve it hot."

      "Prepare Thanksgiving Deep Fried Turkey:",
      "First you will want to Marinade or Brine your Turkey for at leat 8-12 hours for extra flavor and to make sure it is really moist. You will need a pot big enough to keep in your refrigerator for the 8-12 hour period to keep your Turkey inches You will mix all ingredients together, and add your Turkey and the marinade to your pot, and cover, and add to the refrigerator overnight. I like to put the fresh herbs directly into the cavity of the bird for a little extra flavor. When you are done marinading you are ready to cook your Turkey.",
      "How to Deep Fry a Turkey:",
      "You will need a completely thawed turkey, a couple gallons of oil, and a very large cooking pot. You can use canola, vegetable oil, but it is better if you use peanut oil. You will also need to truss the turkey, meaning you need to secure the legs, neck flap, wings and tail to the body of the turkey. Make sure that there is not any type of thermometer or device that will pop out on the turkey. It would melt into the oil, not a good thing.",
      "To determine the perfect amount of oil you are going to be using, place the turkey in the pot and add water until the turkey is completely covered plus an inch or two left from the top. If you do not have any room for extra water you will need to get a larger pot. You will then remove the turkey and measure the amount of water left, and this is the amount of oil you will need to fry your turkey.",
      "You will now dry and season your turkey, and make sure that your frying pot is completely dry. You can add any seasonings you like; I prefer to inject my seasonings directly into the bird. You can also add you cooking pot to your stove top and heat to make sure all water is gone before adding to your outdoor fryer heating source. Once completely dry you will add the oil to the pot and bring it to a temperature of about 375 to 400 degrees. Make sure that you are able to get a good read on the temperature. It may fluctuate a few degrees depending on the weather while cooking outside but it should not be that big a deal. You just want to make sure that you are cooking in a covered but ventilated are. If it is raining or snowing it will make your Turkey frying experience for a really bad day.",
      "This is where it gets tricky. The turkey needs to be room temperature and dry. Turn off the burner when you put the turkey inches You are going to lower the turkey into the pot of very hot oil 400 degree oil. The oil is going to splatter some and you will need some very good cooking gloves. They sell different styles of racks to lower your bird into the oil at Wal-Mart, Lowes, and Home Depot. Just remember to very, very slowly lower your turkey into the hot oil. A good method here is dunking your turkey, and I do not mean cannon ball either. When you lower your turkey into the hot oil it will boil up. This is why I suggest turning off the burner or heat source when you do it. You may have to do this multiple times and then one time might do the trick. Just make sure that the oil does not overflow the cooking pot.",
      "Once the bird is safely resting in the oil, turn the burner back on to get to a temperature of 350 degrees. At this point you can go take a breather. But don't wander too far because that turkey will be done soon. A deep fried turkey cooks at a rate of about 3 to 3 1/2 minutes per pound. A ten pound turkey should take 30-35 minutes. If you have a bio thermometer you will need to test the turkey for doneness. The internal temperature needs to read 160 to 165 degrees. Make sure you are testing between the thigh area, and not hitting a bone to get a correct read.",
      "Remove the turkey from the oil when it's done. Do this slowly and after you have turned off the burner. Let the turkey drain a little bit and you're set to go. Let it rest for about 15 to20 minutes and then carve and enjoy this crisp and delicious bird."

    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "NOTES: These freeze well, but you must re-heat them for 3 to 4 minutes in a 350 degree oven before serving or they will not be crispy.",
      "If you want the straws to be mild, just use 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne; 1/2 teaspoon for regular (slightly spicy), or you can add more if you like them really spicy - 1 teaspoon will make them very spicy, and probably too hot for kids. I usually use 1/2 teaspoon of cayenne.",
      "The rice flour helps the texture of the straws, it gives them a nice sandy texture, like a good shortbread. If you cannot find rice flour, you can use just regular all purpose flour.",
      "I find that I get a better final product if I use margarine - I use Land O Lakes 80% Vegetable Oil Margarine in this recipe. The straws made using margarine hold their shape better, are crispier, and are less fragile once baked. Also, the dough made with margarine is much easier to press out of the cookie press. On a health note, margarine has trans fats in it (2.5g per tablespoon), and butter has a lot of saturated fat (7g per tablespoon), so make your decision accordingly - these are a special occasion treat which I make infrequently, so I don't worry too much about using margarine here.",
      "DO NOT use the kind of margarine which comes in a tub, or any margarine with less than 80% vegetable oil - these types of margarine have a lot of water in them, and they will ruin the consistency of the straws.",
      "The dough for this is pretty stiff and thick - when it is done it will be like a shortbread dough - it will not be a squishy, stretchy mass that sticks together in one uniform ball. I have posted a photo of the dough when it is done being mixed so you can see what it should look like.",
      "You can make the dough ahead of time and keep it in the fridge for a couple of weeks or freeze it for up to 3 months.",
      "If you refrigerate the dough, it will be very hard when you take the dough out of the fridge (this is especially true if you have made the dough with butter), and will need to sit out on the counter for at least 8 hours before you will be able to put it through a cookie press, so plan ahead!",
      "You can either use a cookie press to press out \"straws\", or you can roll out the dough and cut it into strips.",
      "RECIPE:",
      "Preheat the oven to 375\u00b0F.",
      "If you cannot find rice flour and are using just all-purpose flour, make sure to use a total of 1 1/3 cups plus 2 tablespoons of all-purpose flour.",
      "Sift the 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons of flour, rice flour, dry mustard, salt, cayenne & garlic powder together into a bowl.",
      "In a Kitchen Aid mixer, mix together the cheese and the butter on low, mixing for 10 minutes to cream together.",
      "Using the dough hook, gradually add in the flour mixture, mixing on medium-low. Mix well between each addition and scrape down the sides of the bowl so the flour is incorporated into the dough (I add the flour in 4 portions).",
      "Mix until the dough comes together - see the posted photo in the \"photos\" section of this recipe to see what it should look like. It doesn't have to form one single ball, but it does need to come together, and most of the dough should have come off the sides of the mixing bowl.",
      "You can either use a cookie press using the star disk to form strips, or roll the dough out to a 1/4 inch thickness and Use a pizza wheel or a knife to cut the dough into 1/2\" by 4\" strips.",
      "Place a sheet of parchment paper on a cookie sheet, place the straws on the parchment with 1/2\" of space between them. If you have rolled and cut the dough, pierce each straw with the tines of a fork.",
      "Bake at 375\u00b0F on the middle rack of the oven for around 10 to 12 minutes. The cheese straws should be barely beginning to brown when you remove them from the oven. Everyone's oven is different - some run hotter than others because many ovens are not calibrated properly. Start checking the straws at 8 minutes. In my oven they usually take 11 minutes.",
      "Let the straws cool on the cookie sheet for 5 minutes, then place the straws on a rack to cool. If you try to put the straws on a cooling rack immediately after you take them out of the oven, they may break while you're trying to transfer them from the sheet to the rack.",
      "These can be kept in an air-tight container for up to a week, or you can freeze them for up to 3 months. If you do freeze them, return to room temperature and heat for 3 to 4 minutes in a 350\u00b0F oven before serving."

      "In large mixing bowl, cream shortening, butter and sugar together until light and fluffy. Blend in vanilla. In separate bowl, mash bananas and then add to creamed mixture in mixing bowl. Add eggs, one at a time until thoroughly incorporated.",
      "TIP: If you do not have buttermilk on hand, then make some sour milk by adding 1 tablespoon vinegar to 1 cup milk. This will curdle the milk. Set aside.",
      "In another bowl, mix together the flour, oatmeal, baking soda, salt and walnuts (or pecans). NOTE: nuts that are coarsely chopped turn out a better product than nuts that are processed in a food processor.",
      "Begin adding flour/oatmeal mix to creamed mixture a cup at a time and alternate with adding the buttermilk (or sour milk) -- mixing each addition until just moistened (should have no dry ingredients stuck to bowl).",
      "BAKING TIP: Loaves bake more evenly if placed on racks that are in the center of the oven, not the bottom.",
      "IF BAKING LARGE LOAVES: Divide batter between 3 large loaf pans. Large loaves bake for 1 hour and 10 minutes -- when timer goes off, insert toothpick just off-center of each loaf to check if it is done (should come out clean). Cooking time varies, so if not done, bake 5 minutes longer and check again. Continue at 5 minute intervals until done.",
      "IF BAKING LITTLE LOAVES, divide batter between 10-12 mini pans. Bake 20 minutes and check to see if done using same method above and continue to bake at 3 minute intervals until done.",
      "When finished baking, let large loaves sit in pans 5 minutes and then turn them out to finish cooling. For the mini loaves, you can turn them out after 5 minutes, too -- or you can keep them in their pans for gift giving.",
      "Please note that the recipe format of this site for servings, yield and baking times does not give a choice for adding more than one of each (in the case of a recipe that offers different choices in preparation/baking) -- so I could only add 1 choice for the servings, yield and prep/cooking time. Variations for different baking pans, etc., are reflected in the recipe itself."

Anadir mas agua si fuera necesario, tiene que quedar una textura de crema liquida.

      "In a mixer on medium speed, beat the butter to soften. Beat until it is light in color, about 3 minutes. Add sugar and continue to beat (cream) until very light, scraping down the sides and across the bottom of the bowl at least once. While creaming, feel the bowl; if it does not feel cool, place in the freezer for 5 minutes, then continue creaming.",
      "Beat in the vanilla. On medium speed, blend in the oil.",
      "On the lowest mixer speed, blend in the yolks, one at a time, mixing just to blend. Blend in the whole eggs, one at a time, mixing just to blend.",
      "In a medium mixing bowl, beat flour, baking powder, and salt for 30 full seconds at medium speed with a hand mixer or with a fork or whisk by hand.",
      "On the slowest mixer speed, blend over 1/2 of the flour mixture into the batter. Continue on slowest speed and blend in 1/2 of the buttermilk. Continue adding the remainder of the flour until all is incorporated. Blend in the remaining buttermilk.",

      "Pour the batter into the prepared pan. Drop the pan onto the counter from a height of about 4 inches (10 cm) to knock out bubbles. Place the cake in the oven on the stone and bake until the center springs back when touched, or a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean but moist, about 40 minutes. Ideally, the cake should not pull away from the sides until it has just come out of the oven. The center temperature should be about 209 F/98 C if you check by inserting an instant read thermometer.",
      "Place in the pan on a rack to cool, about 10 minutes, then shake the pan to loosen the cake all around. Spray a cooling rack with nonstick cooking spray and invert the cake onto the rack to finish cooling. Peel off the parchment. Cool completely before slicing into layers, storing or icing."
