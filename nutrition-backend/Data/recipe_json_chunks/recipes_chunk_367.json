Simmer covered until pork is just tender. Season with cumin and chili powder - be very generous with cumin as it is what really sets this chili apart. Three to four tablespoons is not unusual. Simmer about 30 minutes more and serve with heated tortillas and if you wish, some grated Jack cheese on top. This both reheats and doubles well. Serves 6 to 8."

Measure the flour, baking soda, cinnamon, salt, baking powder, nutmeg and ground cloves into separate bowl, then stir until combined (a great job for kids). Slowly add the dry ingredients to the pumpkin mixture, beating until smooth. Grease two 9- by 5-inch loaf pans and dust them with flour. Evenly divide the batter between the two pans. Bake for 60 to 70 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Cool for 10 to 15 minutes. Then remove from pans by inverting them onto a rack and tapping the bottoms. Slice and serve plain, buttered or with cream cheese."
