      "If the crumb base is smaller, youll need to pile up the fruit.",

      "When youve assembled your fruit in the middle of the dough, fold the uncovered band of pastry on top of the fruit.",
      "The width of the band will vary with your arrangement of the plums, but you should have at least 2 1/2 inches of dough to form the pleated top crust.",
      "Finally, sprinkle 1 or more tablespoons of sugared bread crumbs over the visible fruit in the center.",
      "As before, use more crumbs on juicy fruit.",

      "Put the baking sheet with the crostata in the oven, on the stone if using one, and bake for 25 minutes; rotate the pan back to front for even cooking.",
      "Continue baking, and check the browning of the crust after 40 minutes: it should be light gold.",
      "If it is getting quite dark, you may need to lay a piece of foil on top.",
      "Bake for another 15 minutes or more, until the fruit is bubbling and has caramelized on the edges.",
      "If youve filled the crostata with a mound of fruit, youll probably want to bake it more than an hourand cover the topto make sure all the fruit is cooked.",
      "Let the crostata cool on the baking sheet for about 15 minutes or more before lifting it, with the parchment, to a wire rack to continue cooling.",
      "When it has set, slide it off the parchment, supported by long spatulas, onto a platter.",
