Grind to a rough paste, then add the chilies, ginger and garlic, and continue to blend. Add the remaining ingredients, except the cilantro, and blend until smooth.

The result will be a brown paste, 3/4 of a cup of which you will need for the marinade."

Baste kabobs with remaining marinade and grill for another 6-8 minutes until swordfish is done. Return everything to a large plate for service.

Turn the heat back up to medium-high and let the liquids come to a boil. Then add the rice and the coconut paste. Stir gently so that the rice is evenly distributed in the pot. Let the rice cook on medium high until the liquids have been absorbed and you can see holes on the surface. DO NOT STIR WHILE THIS IS TAKING PLACE. Turn the heat to low, cover the pot, and let cook for approximately 20 minutes. Check the rice for texture: the grains should have opened and be soft. If it looks like the rice needs more water, add a couple of tablespoons of regular water. Be careful when adding water. Too much could turn the rice into a pudding! Once the rice is cooked, turn the heat off. Take take the lid off the pot and fluff the rice gently with a fork. Let it stand for 10 minutes.",

Make the tandoori marinated tofu - add the diced extra-firm tofu to a bowl. Top with the tandoori paste, garlic cloves and 1 tablespoon of the vegan yoghurt (made in step 1). Stir until tofu is evenly coated. If possible, allow to marinate in the fridge for about 3 hours. If you in a hurry, allow at least half an hour. 3. Make pizza base sauce - Take half of the remaining vegan yoghurt mixture (from step 1) and put it in a bowl. Add the tandoori paste, sugar and the garlic clove. Stir to combine. Taste and adjust the sweetness and saltiness if needed. Set aside 4. Preheat oven to 180 degrees celsius (fan-forced) 5. Make the mint yoghurt sauce - Add the remaining yoghurt mixture (from step 1) to a bowl with the mint leaves. Stir to combine and set aside. 6. Add the marinated tofu and the oil in a pan. Fry on high heat until browned on all sides. Set aside. 7. Line two pizza trays with baking paper or spray oil. Add the pizza bases to the trays and divide the pizza base sauce on both. Spread with a spoon until both pizza bases are evenly covered. Top with the onions, cherry tomatoes and the marinated tofu. 8. Bake for approx. 30 minutes until slightly browned on top. 9. Serve hot with a drizzle of mint yoghurt, salt and freshly cracked black pepper and a handful of baby spinach on each pizza. Enjoy!"

      "6. Pour chicken mixture into 13-by-9-inch pan or any shallow baking dish of similar size. Lay dough over pot pie filling, trimming dough to 1/2 inch of pan lip. Tuck overhanging dough back under itself so folded edge is flush with lip. Flute edges all around. Or don't trim dough and simply tuck overhanging dough into pan side. Cut at least four 1-inch vent holes in large pot pie or one 1-inch vent hole in smaller pies.",

A piece of plastic tube of a diameter that you want your sausage to be is OK, and a rammer made from a piece of wood is fine. Oil the outside of the tube and slide the skins over it, bunching them up as you go. Tie a knot in the end of the skin, then feed the mix into the tube with your thumb and gently ram it down into the skin. Keep going until all the mix is used up. You can gently squeeze the long sausage and twist the skin to form individual sausages or just cut them to length.",

Stir in enough milk to make a thick batter. (The batter will thicken as it stands; thin with additional milk, if needed.) Brush a nonstick griddle or large skillet with oil, and heat over medium heat. Drop scant 1/4-cupfuls of batter onto the hot griddle, and cook for 2 to 3 minutes per side, until golden brown. Transfer the finished fritters to an oven-safe platter and place in the oven to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining batter, adding additional milk, if needed, and reducing the heat if fritters brown too fast. You should get 24 fritters; serve hot.",

Transfer to a plate. Add the shallots and cook over low heat for about 5 minutes, stirring frequently to prevent the shallots from burning, until the color is evenly golden brown. Transfer to a plate, leaving as much oil as possible in the pan. 9. Add more oil if necessary. Add the zucchini slices. Pan-fry the zucchini until golden. Toss well and cook for about 5 minutes. Once the slices are nicely golden, add the green chiles and bell pepper. Lower the heat, then add turmeric powder, Herbes de Provence, salt and lemon zest. Cover and cook until softened, stirring frequently, for 10 minutes. 10. Once the zucchini is soft, add the bread croutons, golden garlic, fried shallots and olives. Drizzle with honey and lemon juice. Toss well. Check seasoning. Add more salt (if necessary) and pepper. Turn off the heat, top with Parmesan cheese and parsley. Let it sit for about 5 minutes. 11.

Season front and back. (You can do the rub portion as far as 24 hrs in advance, but right before you start to cook them yields a delicious product too, so it's not necessary.) Stack ribs in groups of three and wrap tightly in heavy duty foil. Place in baking dish (with at least a 2\" lip) and bake for 3 hours, swapping the location of the bundles within the oven a couple times to ensure they're cooked evenly. After 3 hours, pull the baking dish and allow to sit on top of the oven for an additional 30 minutes. During this time you can prep your BBQ sauce. In a saucepan over med-lo heat, bring BBQ sauce up to a simmer and add red pepper, remaining black pepper, habanero (chop with gloves on or chop quickly, avoiding exposed surface area and wash hands IMMEDIATELY for about 30-45 seconds before touching anything else). Allow to simmer on low for the full 30 minutes, and crank the oven heat up to 325. Carefully unwrap foil and lay ribs flat on baking sheet (doesn't still need to have a 2\" lip, most of the juices have already run off - reserve these liquids and use later to cook other meats, rice, pasta or veggies). Just before using the sauce, add the honey and taste it for heat. Add additional red pepper flakes and/or honey to achieve desired sweet-hot taste. Baste ribs liberally on both sides with sauce and allow to bake for 30-45 minutes at 325, or until sauce begins caramelizes. Allow to sit for 5 minutes before serving. Serve with remaining sauce."

Start with a half cup of each sugar and add more as needed. Cranberries are very tart so you will want to add slightly more than you think you need. Add more sugar as needed to get the desired taste. - Mix in desired spices like cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, pinch of salt... (also to taste) - Add cranberries and slow boil until they begin to pop... you can crush up a few if you'd like to add texture - Simmer until the mixture is 50% reduced to desired thickness, then mix in select fruits. You do not need to drain the crushed pineapple when adding it in. - Taste periodically and add in more spices, fruits or juices to taste"

      "Fill a large pot-one in which you can submerse a whole head of cabbage-with water and bring to a boil. (It is helpful to use a pot with a strainer insert, such as a pasta pot, so you can pick up the insert to remove the cooked cabbage, rather than struggle with spoons or tongs.) Add the first head of cabbage and parboil for about 10 minutes. Remove and let it drain in a colander in the sink until just cool enough to handle. Meanwhile, cook the second head of cabbage, drain, and cool.",
      "Gently pull the outer leaves off each cabbage. (Some of these might be soggy or torn.) Set these aside to line the baking dish. It helps to cut off some of the coarse stem at the beginning and while peeling off the leaves. Your goal is to have 12 to 16 perfect medium to large leaves in which to roll the stuffing. Set aside the small leaves for lining the baking dish as well. If you can get more than 16 leaves to stuff, do so-you can never have too many little doves. Pat each leaf dry and set aside on a kitchen or paper towel.",
      "In a small frying pan, melt 2 tbsp of the butter over medium heat, add the onion, and cook until lightly browned. Remove from the heat and put the onion, rice, and chopped meat into a food processor; season with salt and pepper; and whirl until well mixed. You want to be careful not to overprocess the filling-it should have the consistency of raw meatballs, and not be mushy.",
      "Lay out the \"choice\" cabbage leaves on a work surface and divide the filling among the leaves: The exact portion size for each one will depend on the size of the leaf. (I dollop the filling on with a tablespoon, placing it near the bottom of the leaf). If any stem remaining on the leaf seems especially tough or thick, you can pare it down with a vegetable peeler. Roll the leaves up, folding in the sides and ends so the stuffing is enclosed.",
      "Line the bottom of a 9-x-12-in/23-x-30.5-cm baking dish with any leftover cabbage leaves. (If, after lining the dish, you find you still have a lot of leftover leaves, store them in the refrigerator and eventually chop them, cook in butter, and season with salt and pepper to serve as a side dish for another meal!). Rest the rolls on top, seam-side down; they can be crowded together, just so long as they don't overlap. If you run out of room in one baking dish, start a smaller, second one, lining it the same way.",
      "Pour in the chicken broth (it should come about a third of the way up the sides of the rolls, and not submerge them). Dot the tops of the rolls with the remaining 3 tbsp butter. Bake for 40 minutes to 1 hour, or until the tops are golden and slightly crispy.",
      "Remove the cabbage rolls to a platter and keep warm (you can tent them with foil and keep them in the turned-off oven). Discard the leaves lining the baking dish, but reserve the broth, which will be added to the mushroom sauce.",
      "Soak the dried mushrooms in the boiling water for at least 30 minutes, until softened. Strain the soaking liquid through a fine-mesh strainer lined with a paper towel or cheesecloth, placed over a bowl. Squeeze the mushrooms until the juices are all extracted. Set the liquid aside. Rinse the mushrooms with cold water, pat dry, and coarsely chop.",

Slowly add the reserved mushroom soaking liquid, continuing to stir until all the liquid is blended in and has thickened. Add the wine, cream, and any broth remaining in the pan in which the cabbage rolls were cooked, adding each one separately, stirring constantly, and allowing the sauce to thicken before adding the next. Add the lemon juice and lower the heat. Simmer the sauce for a good 15 minutes or so, until thick and rich. If the sauce is still too thin after 15 minutes, raise the heat and cook at a gentle boil, stirring, until reduced further.",

      "1. Preheat oven to 275 degrees. In a medium-size saucepan cook honey until it darkens and just begins to smoke. Remove pan from heat and slowly add cream, whisking continually. Use caution, as mixture will bubble, splatter and create hot steam. Set aside.",
      "",
      "2. In a separate bowl, whisk together vanilla, salt, egg, yolks and dark brown sugar. Temper yolk mixture by whisking in about a cup of cream mixture. Scrape yolk mixture into cream mixture and whisk until well combined. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve.",
      "",
      "3. Divide pudding base among eight 6-ounce ramekins. Place filled ramekins in a deep baking dish or roasting pan, spaced evenly. Add enough hot water to pan to reach halfway up sides of ramekins. Cover pan with foil and place on center rack of oven. Bake 15 minutes, then rotate pan, lift foil to release steam and replace foil securely. Continue baking, rotating and releasing steam every 15 minutes, until budinos are completely set around edges and slightly loose in centers, about 45 minutes total.",
      "",
      "4. Remove foil and set pan on a rack to cool. When budinos are cool, remove them from water and refrigerate, uncovered, until completely chilled. Budinos can be stored, loosely covered, in refrigerator up to 2 days."

In a small skillet, heat 1/2 inch of vegetable oil over medium heat.

Slice this parsley bundle thinly, as if it were a single vegetable. As you slice, the ball will come apart, but just bunch it back together as best you can, keep slicing, and you'll have a nice head start on the chopping that remains. Anchor the tip of the knife to the cutting board and use a paper cutter-like motion to chop away at your pile. Go over it a couple of times, then slide the knife under, like a spatula, and flip it over. Continue chopping and flipping until the parsley is finely chopped; transfer to a medium bowl.",
