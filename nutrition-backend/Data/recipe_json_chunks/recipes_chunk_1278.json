      "When you are ready to dip, remove a few shaped cake balls at a time from the refrigerator, keeping the rest chilled.",
      "One at a time, dip about 1/2 inch of the tip of a lollipop stick in the melted candy coating, and insert the stick straight into the bottom of an oval-shaped cake ball, pushing it no more than halfway through. Dip the cake pop into the melted coating, and tap off any excess coating. Hold the pop over the bowl in one hand, and tap your wrist gently with your other hand. If you use the hand holding the cake pop to shake off excess coating, the force of the movement will be too strong and could cause the cake ball to loosen or fly off the lollipop stick. Tapping the wrist holding the cake pop absorbs some of the impact. The excess coating will fall off, but you will need to rotate the lollipop stick so the coating doesn't build up on one side, making it too heavy on that side. If too much coating starts to build up at the base of the stick, simply use your finger to wipe it off, spinning the lollipop stick at the same time. This can happen if the coating is too thin or too hot. It's not as hard as it sounds; it just takes a little practice.",

Attach two 1 1/2-inch licorice wheel sections on either side of the witch's head for hair. Hold them in place until the candy coating sets like glue, and place in the Styrofoam block to dry. You can add more coating on the sides to attach the pieces if the coating sets too fast.",

      "The Piedmont region of Italy is quite a fantastic area with its breathtaking views of the majestic snow-covered Swiss and Italian Alps and, of course, the famously aromatic white truffles that grow there. Dolcetto, a varietal common in the Piedmont, is wine for everyday drinking. It is often soft, round, fruit-driven and fragrant, with flavors of licorice and almonds. Sandrone is often seen as a modernist in the Piedmont because he opts for shorter macerations and uses some new oak in his wines. His wines are often rich but very polished.",

      "Gevrey-Chambertin is a small town in the Cote de Nuits producing some of Burgundy's most famous red wines made from Pinot Noir grapes. In 1847, Gevrey annexed the name of its finest vineyard, Chambertin. These Pinot Noirs are generally deeper in color and are a little firmer than the wines of their rivals from neighboring villages. Here in the 'Homeland' of Pinot Noir it is all about the terroir. Of course there are many great, top-level wines from all over the world, but once you have the luck to drink great red Burgundy at its peak, you will never forget that experience! Joseph Drouhin is a negociant in Burgundy who produces wonderful wines for a great value."

      "Place the yeast, sugar, and lukewarm water in a small bowl and allow to stand for 10 minutes until the yeast becomes foamy. (This is proofing the yeast.) Meanwhile, place the shortening and sugar in a mixing bowl. Add the boiling water and stir until everything is dissolved. Add the cream. When the mixture has cooled somewhat, beat in the egg, then stir in the yeast. If the yeast is added to the water while hot, it will die. Beat in 2 cups of unsifted, all-purpose flour. Stir together until the batter becomes smooth and velvety (2-3 minutes). Stir in the additional flour, 1/4 cup at a time. When the dough becomes too stiff to stir, use your fingers and work in additional flour until it becomes firm enough to hold its shape. Place the dough on a lightly floured surface and gently knead for 2-3 minutes, adding flour as necessary, a little at a time. You want to add as little as possible because if too much flour is added to the dough, the beignet will be heavy and dense in texture. Knead until the dough is smooth. Flatten the dough by pushing it down with your fingers, then roll out to a thickness of about 3/8 inch. The dough is still extremely soft so exert gentle pressure with your rolling pin. Using a pastry wheel or pizza cutter, cut the dough into 3-inch squares. Heat 3 inches of oil in a deep pan to about 375 degrees. To test the temperature of the oil, sprinkle a few drops of water into the pan; it should sizzle and pop the instant the water touches the oil. Drop the beignets into the hot oil one at a time. It should first sink to the bottom then rise to the surface after about 10 seconds. (If it stays on the bottom too long, the oil is not hot enough; if it surfaces immediately, the oil is too hot). When the beignet rises to the top, ladle the hot oil over it until it is thoroughly puffed Turn and cook until both sides are golden. Fry only 2-3 at a time. Drain on absorbent paper; sprinkle with powdered sugar, and serve immediately."

      "If using tenderloin, cut into equal filets. Heat a heavy skillet until a drop of oil smokes when added. Season filets with salt and pepper. Brush with vegetable oil. Sear each side for 5-10 sec. Return to plate. Let cool (reserve juices from plate for sauce). Reduce heat to med-hi. Add 2 Tbsp olive oil to skillet and heat. Add onions and saute for 2 min. Season with salt and pepper. Add shallots and saute for 1 min. In a mini chopper, finely chop mushrooms, in batches. Add the mushrooms to onions and saute for 2 min. Add red wine and bring liquid to a simmer. Cook until liquid has dissipated and mixture is nearly dry. Remove from heat and stir in the parsley. Cool completely. Preheat oven to 475 F. On a floured surface, roll out one sheet of puff pastry just so smooth. Cut the pastry in half diagonally (or, if using sheet for three steaks, cut into three triangles - from midpoint of one side to the two opposite corners). Whisk the egg and water together to be used as an egg wash. Place a filet near the center of the pastry. Spread a thin layer of pate over top of steak then evenly pile ~ 1/2-inch of mushrooms on top. Fold one corner of pastry over the filet, tucking in tightly. Folding in the edges as you go, wrap the other two corners over the pastry. Brush egg wash over the pleats to hold them together. Make sure filet is entirely enclosed. Pinch folds together. Repeat for all of the steaks. Place steaks in buttered, rimmed baking sheets. Brush each steak generously with egg wash. Place in oven. Brush steaks again with egg wash once or twice while baking. Bake until thermometer registers 125-130 F for medium. Make a sauce while baking."

Add the remaining all purpose flour and knead the dough. It will still be sticky but resist adding more flour.",

      "Set dough in a lightly oiled bowl and cover with plastic wrap or a towel, then set in a warm place to rise for one hour. After one hour, punch the dough down and either refrigerate for later/tomorrow use, or use it now. Lightly flour your workspace and using a rolling pin, roll the dough into a giant rectangle. I followed the directions and rolled it to be about 12 x 12 inches. Brush the dough with melted butter then covered with the remaining grated cheese.",
      "",
      "Using a pizza cutter, slice the dough from top to bottom into 6 even strips - they do not have to be perfect. Lay the strips on top of each other (be careful you don't lose the cheese!) and then cut into 6 pieces again. Butter and lightly flour a 9 x 5 loaf pan. Layer the square slices into the loaf pan cut side down (like in the first picture). Cover the dough with a towel and let rise for another hour.",

      "The Pork: cut the roast into roughly 1-inch cubes. Remove most of the fat. Combine the dry ingredients in a bowl, then sprinkle the rub over the pork cubes, tossing several times to coat fully. Cover, refrigerate, let sit for 2 hours to overnight. The Chilies: Preheat oven to 500. Place chilies directly on an upper rack. Turn them every 5 minutes or so. While the chilies are roasting, fill a bowl with ice and water. When the chilies are darkened and the skins beginning to split and crack, remove from the oven and place into the ice water and let cool for ten minutes. Turn the oven down to 250. Once cooled, remove the stems and seeds, then peel and dice the chilies. Slice the white onion into thin slices but don't dice them. Dice the red onion and mince the garlic. Using a very hot, large, cast iron skillet, melt the maseca and coat the pan completely. Sear the pork cubes until all sides are well caramelized (about ten minutes). Set the seared pork aside, then deglaze the pan with the white wine and a cup or so of the chicken broth. Pour this liquid into a Dutch Oven or braising pot, then put the seared pork in with it. Cover the pork with the sliced white onion. Add another cup or so of the chicken broth. Cover the pot and place it into the 250 degree oven for 1-1/2 hours. Once the braising pot comes out of the oven, dump it into the cast iron skillet, where you can separate the cooked down white onions and remove as much of the fat as possible. In the braising pot, add your corn oil. Over medium heat, sweat the red onions until they are translucent. Add the minced garlic and cook until aromatic, then add the diced chilies and the canned hominy. Now add the pork and pan juices from the skillet back into the braising pot, then add the remaining broth and bay leaf. Cover and simmer for two hours. Serve with shredded cheese, pico de gallo, and chopped cilantro. I also serve it with hot buttered flour tortillas."
