      "In a medium bowl, combine bread with milk and soak well, breaking up bread pieces with your fingers until no firm or dry bits remain. Set aside.",
      "In a measuring cup or medium bowl, combine cornstarch with a couple tablespoons chicken stock, stirring to form a smooth slurry with no lumps. Add remaining stock, stir well, and set aside.",
      "In a large mixing bowl, combine ground beef, ground pork, minced yellow onion, egg yolks, salt, a very generous grating of black pepper, onion powder, garlic powder, and liquid smoke (if using). Add bread mixture, along with any liquid. Using clean hands, mix well until all ingredients are thoroughly combined. (Alternatively, you can use a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment to combine these ingredients; scrape down sides occasionally.)",
      "Place a grape-sized ball of meat mixture on a small plate and cook in microwave or in a small nonstick skillet on the stovetop until cooked through (about 15 seconds on high power if using microwave). Taste, then adjust seasoning if desired. Cook another small sample and adjust again if desired. (This recipe purposely makes a tiny bit more meat mixture than you will need so that you can taste and adjust seasonings as necessary.)",
      "Form meat mixture into 4 baseball-sized balls; you may have a small amount left, depending on how much you used for the samples. Flatten each ball into an oblong, steak-like shape about 3/4 inch thick and place on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Using a finger, form dimples all over top side of each ground-meat steak.",
      "In a large cast iron skillet, heat oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add ground-meat steaks, dimpled side up, and lower heat to medium. Cook, using a thin metal spatula to rotate steaks for even browning, until browned on one side, about 8 minutes. Flip steaks and repeat on other side until browned, about 8 minutes longer. Adjust heat as necessary to ensure steaks brown but don't burn on either side. Continue cooking and turning steaks every couple minutes until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of the steaks registers 145\u00b0F (63\u00b0C). Transfer steaks to a platter.",
      "Increase heat to medium-high and add mushrooms to skillet, scraping and stirring until mushrooms release their liquid and you can scrape up browned bits on bottom of pan, about 1 minute; add extra oil at any point if pan seems too dry. Continue cooking, stirring occasionally, until mushroom liquid has evaporated and mushrooms begin to brown, about 6 minutes longer.",
      "Add diced onion and cook, stirring, until onion releases its liquid and you can scrape up browned bits from mushrooms on bottom of pan, about 1 minute. Continue cooking until onion liquid evaporates and onion is softened and beginning to turn lightly golden, about 2 minutes longer.",
      "Stir in ketchup or tomato paste and cook, stirring, for 30 seconds. Stir stock mixture to lift any settled cornstarch from the bottom, then add to skillet and bring to a simmer, stirring and scraping up any browned bits. Continue to cook until stock has reduced by about one-third and has thickened slightly.",
      "Stir in Worcestershire sauce and season with salt and pepper. Lower heat and add butter, stirring vigorously, until butter has melted and a smooth, emulsified sauce forms that lightly coats the back of a spoon. Add just enough vinegar to taste to balance out the sauce. (Use small increments of about 1/2 teaspoon, tasting after each addition to ensure you don't add too much.)",
      "Return steaks to skillet along with any accumulated juices, spoon sauce all over, and simmer gently until warmed through. Serve right away."

Using a silicone spatula, scrape the batter into the prepared pans, being sure to press the thick and fluffy batter against the sides of the pans, and smooth the surfaces evenly with a small offset spatula.",
      "Bake for 30 to 40 minutes, or until a wire cake tester inserted into the centers comes out clean and the cake springs back when pressed lightly in the centers. The cakes should start to shrink from the sides of the pan only after removal from the oven.",
      "Cool and unmold the cake: Let the cakes cool in the pans on a wire rack for 10 minutes. Run a small metal spatula between the sides of the pans and the cakes, pressing firmly against the pans, and invert the cakes onto wire racks that have been coated lightly with nonstick cooking spray. To prevent splitting, reinvert the cakes so that the top sides are up. Cool completely. The cakes will be slightly smaller at the tops (more so if you haven't pressed the batter up against the sides of the pan.)",
      "In a food processor, process the chocolate until very fine.",
      "In a 4-cup or larger microwaveable cup with a spout (or in a medium saucepan, stirring often), whisk together the cream and tomato soup and scald it (heat it to the boiling point; small bubbles will form around the periphery).",
      "When the cakes are completely cool, spread a little of the ganache on a serving plate and set the first layer on top. Slide a few wide strips of wax paper or parchment under the cake to keep the rim of the plate clean.",
      "Spread about 1 cup of the ganache over the layer. Place the second layer on top and use the remainder to frost the top and sides. With the tip of a 1/4-inch-wide metal spatula, make wavy lines through the ganache on top of the cake. Slowly slide the paper strips from under the cake. If storing the cake under a cake dome, allow the ganache to set for a minimum of 3 hours or overnight before applying the Pirouettes or the moisture from the ganache will soften them.",
      "To surround the cake with the Pirouettes, you may first have to trim them to about 4 inches, using a small serrated knife. Repair any broken ones using ganache and press them gently against the sides of the cake. The ganache will hold them in place. If the ganache becomes too firm, heat it by applying a spatula run under hot tap water and dried.",
      "If desired, pipe little flames of red buttercream on top of each Pirouette. If not using a coupler or tip that screws into the tube of buttercream, hold the small star decorating tip in place with your hand. Hold the tube of buttercream in a vertical position over the Pirouette and squeeze it with your free hand to pipe the flame onto the top of the cookie. Allow to dry until set, about 30 minutes. As a further option, you can enhance the look of the \"flames\" by painting them lightly with piping gel, brushing them very gently with the artist's paintbrush from the bottom of the flame to the tip."

    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "Take a large bowl, sift into it the measured flour, salt, soda, and baking powder. Add the lard and blend together with a pastry blender or your fingertips until the mixture has the texture of cornmeal. Add the milk all at once by scattering it over the dough. (If you are making ham biscuits, add the minced ham now.) Stir vigorously with a stout wooden spoon. The dough will be very soft in the beginning but will stiffen in 2 or 3 minutes. Continue to stir a few minutes longer.",
      "After the dough has stiffened, scrape from sides of bowl into a ball and spoon onto a lightly floured surface for rolling. Dust over lightly with about a tablespoon of flour as the dough will be a bit sticky. Flatten the dough out gently with your hands into a thick, round cake, and knead for a minute by folding the outer edge of the dough into the center of the circle, giving a light knead as you fold the sides in overlapping each other. Turn the folded side face down and dust lightly if needed, being careful not to use too much four and causing the dough to become too stiff.",
      "Dust the rolling pin and the rolling surface well. Roll the dough out evenly to a 1/2-inch thickness or a bit less. Pierce the surface of the dough with a table fork. (It was said piercing the dough released the air while baking.) Dust the biscuit cutter in flour first; this will prevent the dough sticking to the cutter and ruining the shape of the biscuit. Dust the cutter as often as needed. An added feature to your light, tender biscuits will be their straight sides. This can be achieved by not wiggling the cutter. Press the cutter into the dough and lift up with a sharp quickness without a wiggle. Cut the biscuits very close together to avoid having big pieces of dough left in between each biscuit. Trying to piece together and rerolling leftover dough will change the texture of the biscuits.",
      "Place the biscuits 1/2 inch or more apart on a heavy cookie sheet or baking pan, preferably one with a bright surface. The biscuits brown more beautifully on a bright, shining pan than on a dull one, and a thick bottom helps to keep them from browning too much on the bottom. Set to bake in a preheated 450\u00b0F oven for 13 minutes. Remove from the oven and let them rest for 3 to 4 minutes. Serve hot."

Taste for seasoning; fill the whites with the yolk mixture. If not serving within an hour, refrigerate until ready to eat.",
      "You may simply sprinkle the eggs with chopped chives and/or parsley or dust them with paprika. For extra flavor, you may mash into the yolk mixture chopped herbs, paprika, a tiny bit of pounded garlic, or chopped capers. My favorite combination is a tiny bit of garlic mixed into the yolk with minced chives sprinkled on top.",

      "Put the yolk in a bowl with the lemon juice or vinegar and a pinch of salt. Whisk well, until the salt has dissolved and the yolk has thickened a bit. Slowly dribble the olive oil into the egg yolk mixture, whisking constantly. As yolk absorbs the oil, the sauce will thicken, lighten in color, and become opaque. Once this happens, you can begin to add the oil a little faster, in a thin but constant stream, whisking all the while. Taste and whisk in another dash of vinegar or lemon juice if it needs brightening."

Stir in 3/4 cup cream, just until most of the dry mixture has been moistened; it will still be quite dry. Turn out on a board and knead just a few times, until the dough just comes together. It might still be a little crumbly at the edges. Roll or pat 1/2 inch thick and cut into squares or circles or whatever shape you like. This recipe will make 12 individual shortcakes.

You should end up with a pillow-shaped center surrounded by an edge that is just under 3/8 inch wide. Seal the sides of the edges together firmly until you can't see a seam where the two discs meet. As they are made, place the ravioli on a dish towel or tray sprinkled with semolina. Leave to dry for 10 to 15 minutes. (You can now cover the tray with plastic wrap and keep the ravioli in the fridge for a day.)",
      "When ready to cook, bring a large pan of salted water to the boil. Cook the pasta for 2 to 3 minutes, or until al dente. Drain and divide among four plates. Sprinkle with pink peppercorns, tarragon and lemon zest. Drizzle grapeseed oil over the ravioli and around them, sprinkle with extra salt and a squirt of lemon juice, if you like, and serve at once."

Add water and knead on low speed just until mixture comes together and no dry flour remains. Allow to rest for 10 minutes. Knead on low speed for an additional ten minutes. The mixture should come together into a cohesive mass that barely sticks to the bottom of the bowl as it kneads. Depending on the type of flour used, you may need to add up to 1/2 cup additional flour. If dough sticks heavily to bottom of bowl, add flour 1 tablespoon at a time with mixer running until it forms a mass that just barely sticks to the bowl. Cover bowl tightly with plastic or transfer the dough to two gallon-sized zipper lock bags, seal, and refrigerate for at least 8 and up to 72 hours.",
      "Transfer the dough to a floured work surface and dust the top with additional flour. Using a bench scraper, divide the dough into six even pieces, approximately six ounces each. Using floured hands, shape each piece into a neat ball by gathering the dough towards the bottom. Coat four small containers with non-stick cooking spray or olive oil (large cereal bowls work great for this) and add one dough ball to each bowl. Lightly spray top of dough ball with non-stick cooking spray. Cover tightly with plastic wrap, and allow to rise at room temperature for 2 hours (dough should roughly double in volume).",

Cut the mozzarella into 1/2-inch chunks and place on a plate on a triple layer of paper towels or a clean kitchen towel.

Transfer it to a floured surface and gently stretch it into a 10-inch circle, leaving the outer 1-inch edge slightly thicker than the center. The best way to do this it to start by gently stretching with your fingertips. Pick up the slightly stretched dough and place it on the opened face of your left hand. Toss it back and forth between your opened hands, rotating it slightly with each toss until it stretches out to around 8-inches in diameter. Return it to the work surface. With your left hand flat in the center of the round, use your right hand to stretch the edge of the dough out, rotating as needed until it is an even 10-inches in diameter.",

Preheat the broiler to high and arrange the rack such that you can just barely fit a 12-inch heavy-bottomed oven-proof cast iron or stainless steel skillet on top of it. Dust skillet with flour, tap out excess, then heat the skillet over high heat and heat until lightly smoking, about three minutes. Transfer one dough round to the skillet. It should fill up the entire bottom surface. Working quickly, spread two tablespoons sauce evenly over the dough, leaving the outer 1-inch border un-sauced. Top with 1/6 of the cheese chunks. Season with kosher salt. Drizzle with 1 tablespoon olive oil, and scatter four basil leaves over the surface. Transfer skillet to broiler and broil until pizza is puffed and darkly charred in spots (this can take anywhere between 1 1/2 to 4 minutes, depending on the strength of your broiler). Return the skillet to the stovetop and cook until the bottom is darkly charred in spots, using a thin metal spatula to peek after about 1 minute (depending on the skillet you use, you may skip this step if the pizza is already charred). Transfer the pizza to a cutting board and serve immediately. Repeat steps 4 and 5 to bake remaining pizzas."

      "Place a baking stone on the middle shelf of the oven and preheat on the highest setting for at least 1 hour. Shape the dough ball using the toss-and-spin method, stretching it to a diameter of about 12 inches. The dough should be about 1/4 inch thick and slightly thicker toward the edge. Transfer the dough to a peel or an inverted sheet pan that has been dusted with flour.",
      "In a bowl, stir together the ricotta, salt, thyme, and pepper. Spread the White Sauce over the surface of the dough, leaving a 1/4-inch border uncovered. Spread the ricotta mixture evenly over the White Sauce.",
      "Carefully slice the pizza from the peel onto the baking stone. It should take about 12 minutes to make. When it is done, the crust should be crisp and slightly charred on the edge and the cheese should be bubbling and just beginning to caramelize. The underside of the crust should be brown and crisp, not white and soft.",
      "Remove the finished pizza from the oven and garnish it immediately with the parsley. Let the pizza cool for about 3 minutes before slicing and serving. If you want a \"snappier\" crust, let the pizza cool completely, then return the individual slices to the hot oven for recrisping.",
      "With a large metal spoon, stir together all the ingredients into a 4-quart bowl or the bowl of an electric stand mixer until combined. If mixing with an electric mixer, fit it with the dough hook and mix on a low speed for 4 minutes, or until all the flour gathers to form a coarse ball. Let the dough rest for 5 minutes, then mix again on medium-low speed for an additional 2 minutes, or until the dough clears the sides of the bowl and sticks just a little to the bottom. If the dough is too soft and sticky to hold its shape, mix in more flour by the tablespoonful. If mixing by hand, repeatedly dip one of your hands or the spoon into room-temperature water and use it much like a dough hook, working the dough vigorously into a coarse ball as you rotate the bowl with your other hand. As all the flour is incorporated into the ball, about 4 minutes, the dough will begin to strengthen; when this occurs, let the dough rest for 5 minutes and then resume mixing for an additional 2 to 3 minutes, or until the dough is slightly sticky, soft, and supple. If the dough is too soft and sticky to hold its shape, mix in more flour by the tablespoonful; if it is too stiff or dry, mix in more water by the tablespoonful.",
      "Immediately divide the dough into 3 equal pieces. Round each piece into a ball and brush or rub each ball with olive or vegetable oil. Place each ball inside its own zippered freezer bag. Let the balls sit at room temperature for 15 minutes, then put them in the refrigerator overnight or freeze any pieces you will not be using the next day.",
      "The next day, remove the balls from the refrigerator 2 hours before you plan to roll them out to take off the chill and relax the gluten.",
      "In a heavy saucepan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the onion and saute for 5 or 6 minutes, or until translucent. Add the garlic and stir for 1 minute longer. Add the cream, lower the heat to medium-low, and cook for about 3 minutes, or until the cream thickens and reduces slightly.",

Stir the mixture into the bowl with the flour until the dough is just lightly mixed. Then add the olive oil, scraping down the bowl sides and mixing until thoroughly blended. The dough should be very stiff; if necessary, add in enough more flour to stiffen it. Gently stir in the olives until evenly distributed throughout. Brush the top with oil. Tightly cover the bowl with plastic wrap. If desired, for best flavor or for convenience, you can refrigerate the dough for 3 to 10 hours. Then let rise at cool room temperature for 12 to 18 hours.",
      "Using an oiled rubber spatula, lift and fold the dough in towards the center all the way around until thoroughly loosened fro the bowl; don't deflate any more than necessary. Evenly brush the inside of a 3 1/2- to 4-qart Dutch oven or other heavy pot or large, deep, flat-bottomed ovenproof casserole with olive oil. Add the cornmeal, then tip the pot back and forth to distribute it on the sides. Invert the dough into the pot; don't worry if it's ragged-looking or lopsided. Shake the pot to center the dough. Brush the surface with olive oil. Top the pot with its lid.",

Let rise until the dough has doubled from its deflated size.",

Brush the loaf with olive oil and continue to bake, uncovered, testing until the top is well browned and a skewer inserted in the thickest part comes ou with just a few crumbs on the tip (or until the center registers 207 to 208 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer), 12 to 15 minutes longer. Bake for 5 to 10 minutes more to ensure that the center is done. Cool in the pot on a wire rack for 15 minutes. Run a knife around the loaf and remove it to the rack; let cool completely.",
      "This loaf tastes good warm, but will cut better when cool. Cool completely before storing. To maintain the crisp crust, store draped with a clean tea towel or in a heavy paper bag. Or store airtight in a plastic bag or foil: The crust will soften, but can be crisped by heating the loaf, uncovered, in a 400-degree F oven for a few minutes. The bread will keep at room temperature for up to 3 days, and may be frozen, airtight, for up to 2 months."

Avoid letting the zucchini sit at room temperature covered in oil, as spoilers may bloom, and the zucchini will absorb too much oil. The oil should harden quickly in the fridge.",

Depending on what type of all-purpose flour you use, the amount of liquid will vary slightly. (I generally use King Arthur, and I find that it needs a little more liquid.) The dough will start to come together when approximately half of the liquid is incorporated into the flour.",

Sprinkle the sheet of dough with flour, and then gently fold into fourths lengthwise. Cut into approximately 1/4-inch strips with a sharp knife. After cutting, spread out loosely to ensure that the strands will not stick together as you are rolling and cutting the rest of the dough. This batch, in total, will make approximately 10 servings.",
      "To cook the noodles: bring a large pot of water to boil. Cook for approximately 4 to 7 minutes, depending on the thickness of the noodle. Boil until the noodles are just cooked through the center; drain and rinse under cold water. Unlike Italian pasta, for which it is desirable to retain the surface starch, you want to make your udon noodles slicker.",

This broth may be made in advance, cooled to room temperature, and refrigerated in a container for up to 3 days.",
      "To assemble: Place the cooked noodles in the broth, along with accoutrements, if desired. If the broth is fresh, then the noodles will be delicious on their own with very few additions needed. A poached egg, sliced green onions, or fish cake are some of my favorites."

Fill in the gaps with more buttercream so it is even with the edge of the laters, then smooth out the sides of cake with an offset spatula to form the crumb coat, leaving top of cake bare. Chill in refrigerator until the buttercream is firm, 30 minutes.",
      "Use the remaining frosting to frost only the sides of the cake but not the top, leaving those gorgeous caramelized bananas exposed. If you feel like showing those bananas even more love, you can brush the top with a little simple syrup or melted apricot jam."

      "Prepare the butter and lard, if using. Cut the butter into 1/2-inch (12-mm) cubes (a bench scraper is perfect for this, but a sharp knife works well too), and cut the lard into small pieces. Return them to the fridge or freezer to cool.",
      "In a liquid measuring cup, stir together the milk and vinegar. Refrigerate the mixture until ready to use.",
      "On a clean flat surface or in a large shallow bowl, toss the flour, cornstarch, sugar, and salt together lightly to blend. Add the butter and lard (if using) to the dry ingredients and, using the tool of your choice (see Tools of the Trade, page 20), cut the fat into the flour with speed and patience, until the fat has been reduced to small pea-sized chunks. Try to use a straight up-and-down motion, avoiding twisting your wrists, as the more you press on the flour the more tough gluten will develop in the dough. Avoid using your fingers, as the heat from your hands will melt the fat and further encourage gluten development. Unlike with pasta or bread, gluten is the enemy of pie dough, so be gentle, and be quick!",
      "Once your fat has been cut down to size, spread your mixture out gently to expose as much surface area as possible. Gently drizzle about half of your milk mixture over the flour, trying to cover as wide an area as you can. Using bench scrapers or a large spoon, toss the flour over the liquid (don't stir; just lightly toss), spread everything out again, and repeat the process with the second half of the liquid. You should now have a dough that will just hold together when pressed against the bowl, with visible little chunks of butter. If you need to add more liquid to bind it, do so with more cold milk, adding a tablespoon at a time until you reach the right texture. It's not an exact science, as everything from the humidity in the air to the dryness of your flour will affect the consistency of your dough.",
      "Once you've reached your goal, cover the dough tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate it for at least 1 hour. The dough can be kept in the fridge for up to 1 week, well wrapped, or in the freezer for up to 2 months. Note: For this recipe, you'll only need half the dough, as it's a single-crust pie.",
      "Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C). Roll out the dough into a circle about 11 inches (28 cm) in diameter. Transfer it to a 9-inch (23-cm) pie plate. Blind-bake the pie crust until partially baked; set it aside to cool. Leave the oven on.",
      "Make the filling: In a large bowl, whisk the eggs and sugar together until light and fluffy. Whisk in the tea, flour, butter, and salt. Put the par-baked crust on a baking sheet. Pour the filling into the crust and bake for 25 to 30 minutes, until the filling has just set and is still slightly wobbly in the center. Remove the pie to cool completely before serving. This pie can be refrigerated for up to 1 week, covered well in plastic wrap. Add topping, if using, just before serving."

Carefully pat pupusa down into a flat round about 4 inches wide and about 3/4 inch thick; if edges crack, run a wet finger around them to smooth them. Place pupusas on a baking sheet and keep covered with a towel as you work. Repeat with remaining masa balls and fillings.",

Working in batches, add pupusas and fry, turning once, until well-browned and crisp, about 4 minutes per side.

Cover and proof until puffy, light, and roughly doubled in bulk, about 2 hours at 70\u00b0F (21\u00b0C). In a chilly kitchen, the dough will need more time to rise, and in a warmer kitchen, it will move faster.",

To test dough, poke it gently with a flour-dusted fingertip; when dough is ready, it will retain a shallow impression that springs back after a minute. If dough is firm and springs back right away, continue proofing until dough retains a shallow impression. This will take about 75 minutes at around 70\u00b0F (21\u00b0C). Again, timing of the process will vary based on environmental conditions. Near the end of this period, adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and preheat oven to 350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C).",

Immediately turn loaf out onto a wire rack, and cool completely before slicing, at least 90 minutes. Slice with a sharp serrated knife.

The four larger layers will make up the center of the cake with two smaller layers on each side. Be sure to save the two domed small top layers for the very outer pieces.",
      "Once layers are arranged, use a sharp knife to carefully trim the outer edges into a more egg-like shape. You can adhere the trimmed pieces with frosting if desired to add additional shaping (I added a little piece that had been trimmed off the edge to the \"tip\" of the egg to give it a more rounded look).",
      "Spread the outside of the cake with remaining frosting and decorate with M&Ms in whatever pattern you desired. To create the striped egg effect I first sorted all of the M&Ms by color then applied them in thick stripes."

Toast the poppadums until bumps appear on the surface and they turn light brown, 1 to 2 minutes. There is no need to turn them. Set them aside to cool. Microwaving poppadums on high power for 30 seconds to 1 minute is also an option. The poppadums will turn crisp and brittle as they cool. You can store them in airtight plastic zip-top bags at room temperature for up to 2 weeks (but I bet they will be gone long before that).",

Once the skillet is hot (when you hold the palm of your hand close to the bottom of the skillet you will feel the heat), usually after 2 to 4 minutes, add the coriander and cumin seeds and toast them, shaking the skillet every few seconds, until they start to crackle and turn reddish brown and the aroma is highly nutty fragrant with citrus undertones, about 1 minute. Immediately transfer the seeds to a small heatproof bowl or plate to cool. Once cool, place the coriander and cumin seeds in a spice grinder (you can also use a coffee grinder) and grind the blend to the consistency of finely ground black pepper.",
      "Place the cilantro, lime juice, salt, onion, garlic, and chiles in the bowl of a food processor and, using the pulsing action, mince the blend. Letting the processor run constantly will create an unwanted chunky puree, full of liquid.",

Transfer the dip to a pretty serving bowl. If you are planning on serving the avocado dip later, press a piece of plastic wrap directly onto the dip's surface, making sure there are no air bubbles in between the wrap and the surface (this slows down the dip from oxidizing and turning a wee bit black). You can store the dip in the refrigerator for up to 2 days.",
      "To serve, if you are making the spiked onion, place 6 poppadums on a large pretty platter. Evenly divide the onion topping among them, spreading it over the surface of each. If you are making the dip, place the poppadums in a cloth-lined basket with the dip alongside."

      "Put the cake flour in a big bowl, then drop in the cool butter cubes-that is, right out of the fridge, just now cut into little pieces. Use a fork or a pastry cutter to push the fat through the flour, continually working it all around the bowl, cleaning the tines often, then going at it again. There's way more fat here than flour, way more butter than you'd use for a pie crust, so the resulting mixture will be about the consistency of the stuff in a jar of elementary-school paste that's been left uncovered overnight.",
      "You can also do this task in a food processor fitted with the chopping",
      "blade. Add the flour and butter, and process until the mass starts to",
      "adhere into a ball.",
      "Line a clean, dry work surface with wax paper. Gather the dough together, then turn it out onto the wax paper. Set another sheet of wax paper on top. Roll the dough into a 9 x 12-inch (23 x 30.5-cm) rectangle. Note the missing words \"about\" or \"approximately.\" Don't cheat; use a ruler and make the rectangle exactly the right size by repositioning the rolling pin repeatedly and rolling just once or twice in each direction before changing and rolling in another set of directions. Once you've got the rectangle, pick it up still between its sheets of wax paper, set it on a large baking sheet, and put the whole thing in the fridge for at least 1 hour or up to 24 hours.",
      "Heat the milk in a large saucepan over low heat until the milk is between 100\u00b0F and 105\u00b0F (38\u00b0C and 41\u00b0C). It's important to be accurate. Use an instant-read meat thermometer to be sure, taking the milk's temperature without letting the probe touch the pan itself.",
      "Once the milk is at the right temperature, take it off the heat and stir in 3 tablespoons sugar and the yeast. Set the pan aside for 5 minutes to proof the yeast-that is, to make sure it's bubbly, even foamy, starting to come alive and producing the fizzy carbon dioxide that will eventually make the pastry rise.",
      "Dump in the 2 cups (330 g) all-purpose flour and 2 tablespoons of the beaten egg (reserve the rest of the beaten egg in the fridge for later in the recipe). Stir a bit; then once the stuff starts to form a dough, turn it out onto a clean, dry, lightly flour-dusted work surface and knead for 2 minutes, pulling it with one hand while twisting the stretched lump and at the same time digging the palm of your other hand into it. Basically, you want to create a smooth dough, not as silky as good bread dough, but still coherent and cohesive. Cover it with a clean kitchen towel and let it rest on the counter for 10 minutes.",
      "Clean up your work surface so it's got no sticky bits of dough, dry it well, then dust it lightly with flour. Set the lump of dough in the center and use a rolling pin to roll it into a 14 x 20-inch (35.5 x 50-cm) rectangle.",
      "Take the chilled butter dough out of the fridge and set it on top of and at one end of the flour dough so that the 12-inch (30.5-cm) side of the buttery rectangle is an inch (2.5 cm) or so from but also parallel to the 14-inch (35.5-cm) side of the larger sheet of dough. Turn the dough so that the buttery rectangle is farthest from you. Now fold the larger dough sheet up and over the buttery one, thereby encasing it. Work around the dough to seal all the edges.",
      "Roll it out again into a large rectangle, about 14 x 20 inches (35.5 x 50 cm)-not exactly this time, just close enough. If you knead it during this step, you can dust your work surface with a little flour, but do so as infrequently as possible, using as little as possible. More flour = more gluten = the possibility of a tougher dough.",
      "Take one short side of this rectangle and fold it over until it comes to the two-thirds mark on the rectangle's long side. Now take the other exposed side and fold it over the other way, thus folding the piece of dough into three equal sections on top of each other. Roll this piece of dough out into a large rectangle, about 14 x 20 inches (36 x 51 cm). Then do this three more times: folding it into thirds and rolling it back out, and then again, and then again. Fold the dough into thirds one last time, then set it in the refrigerator to chill for 1 hour.",
      "Meanwhile, prepare the filling: Mix the fresh chevre or soft goat cheese, the large whole egg (not the reserved beaten egg), the sugar, all-purpose flour, and nutmeg in a bowl until creamy and smooth. Take out that remainder of the beaten egg from the fridge and whisk it with 1 tablespoons water.",
      "To make the danishes, take the chilled dough out of the refrigerator and slice it into 3 equal pieces. Clean and dry that work surface yet again. (Is it any wonder why pastry chefs are so irritable?) Give it a light dusting with flour. On that surface, roll each piece of the dough out to a 6 x 8-inch (15 x 20-cm) rectangle, about inch (.6 cm) thick. Be fairly precise but not obsessive-because once all 3 are rolled out, you will trim them to perfect 5 x 7 -inch (13 x 19-cm) rectangles with perfectly straight edges. (The excess dough can be thrown out or baked on its own for little puff pastry twists or braids.)",
      "Cut each of these rectangles into six 2 x 2 -inch (6 x 6-cm) squares. In other words, make one straight cut parallel to the 7 -inch (19-cm) sides, and two even cuts parallel to the 5-inch (13-cm) sides.",
      "Place a heaping tablespoon of the filling in each square. Fold the corners",
      "of each square toward the center to meet in the middle over the filling. Dab a little of the beaten-egg-and-water mixture on the dough to seal it at the center point. Once all the little packets are made, line a large baking sheet with a silicone mat or parchment paper, and put the filled packets on a large baking sheet, cover them with a clean kitchen towel, and let them rest at room temperature for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, position the rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 400\u00b0F (205\u00b0C).",
      "Bake until the danishes are puffed and golden brown, about 20 minutes. Cool for a minute or two on the baking sheet, then transfer to a wire rack and continue cooling. Once they're at room temperature (if they make it that long), they can be stored on the counter in a zip-sealed plastic bag for a couple of days or in the freezer for several months."

Chill the ganache until cool and slightly thickened, but not set. Using a whisk, beat until thickened. Spread the ganache across two of the cake layers and set aside while you make the Swiss meringue.",

Remove the bowl from the heat and, using an electric mixer, beat until the meringue forms stiff glossy peaks. (When you have made the meringue, you need to work with it fairly quickly. Don't let it stand or it will firm up too much to spread easily.)",

Repeat with the second chocolate-topped cake layer and finish with the final layer. Take the remaining meringue and spread across the top and sides of the cake-this doesn't have to look perfect, as any imperfections will just add to the effect. To finish the cake, take a blowtorch and lightly torch the meringue until it is golden."

Once the butter has melted, add one-third of the mushrooms. Scatter the mushrooms in an even layer in the saute pan. Cook the mushrooms until caramelized on all sides, 3 to 4 minutes. Season with 1/4 teaspoon of the salt and some pepper. Remove the mushrooms from the saute pan and drain on paper towels. Repeat this process 2 more times with the remaining mushrooms.",

Add the bacon or pancetta and cook until the fat has rendered and the meat is slightly crispy, 5 to 6 minutes. Add the garlic and cook until the garlic is slightly golden, 1 to 2 minutes longer. Add the pickled peppers and basil; stir to combine. Then add the cooked mushrooms and toss together until the mushrooms are warm. Stir in the lemon juice. Taste and adjust the seasoning as needed; the mixture should be spicy, salty, and lemony. Set aside and keep warm while cooking the eggs.",
      "In a medium ovenproof nonstick saute pan, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil and 1/2 tablespoon butter over medium heat. When the butter has melted, crack the eggs and add them to the pan. Season the eggs generously with salt and pepper. When the eggs start to sizzle, place the saute pan in the oven. Cook the eggs just until the whites are set but the yolks are still runny, 2 to 3 minutes.",

If you have a wide, shallow strainer, you can place the zeppole foil side down in the strainer to transfer to the oil.

Cook until golden brown then using heat resistant tongs turn the zeppole and cook to the same degree of doneness, about 1 to 1 1/2 minutes per side. Do not cook more than 2 to 3 zeppole at a time, as over crowding will cause the oil's temperature to drop. Use tongs or strainer to remove zeppole from oil, letting any excess oil drain off, then transfer to a wire rack for cooling. Test your first zeppole to make sure that the insides are completely cooked, if not, adjust your cooking time accordingly.",
      "When zeppole have cooled completely, pipe a little cream in the middle and up around the inner edges in a swirling pattern. Dust with confectioner's sugar and top with a cherry. Enjoy immediately."

Once all cakes are coated, they may be wrapped and stored at room temperature for a day or two or stored in the refrigerator for several days. (For the most eating pleasure, be sure to allow chilled cakes to come to room temperature before serving.)"

Honey, maple syrup and other sweeteners can also be substituted in part or in whole for the sugar, just be aware that liquid sweeteners tend to be sweeter than white sugar and should not be substituted cup for cup. Instead, substitute sweeteners such as honey and maple little by little, to taste. You can add a little more sweetener to the custard later if necessary, but you won't be able to take it away.",
