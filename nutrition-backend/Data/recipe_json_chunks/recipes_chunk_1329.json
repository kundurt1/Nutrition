      "Place chicken in pot, and add enough water to cover by at least an inch. Add cubes, rosemary, bay leaves, thyme, garlic, salt, pepper, and oregano. The amount you add is a personal choice. (I cook like my mother, a pinch of this etc.)Boil until chicken is cooked through. This will vary in time depending on size and temperature. As the chicken cooks, you may have to add water several times, again, a personal choice. When cooked through remove chicken and place in a bowl to cool. Spoon out the bay leaves, and make sure that no chicken wings are left in broth. Turn temp on stove down to lowest possible settings. While it is cooling, chop celery, onion, and garlic and add to broth. Add corn, carrots, green beans and diced tomatoes. Cover broth and begin to remove the bones from the chicken. When you're done add the chicken back to the broth as well as the tortillini and the salsa, turn the temp back up to boiling and let it boil for about 20 minutes. I say about because the type of tortillini will affect how long it needs to be cooked. Dried tortillini takes longer. Again, you will have to add water because you will need a little extra for what the tortillini take up in cooking. This recipe is large enough that it is great for parties. Also, this recipe can be made using leftover turkey from thanksgiving and chicken broth to give it more flavor. many more things can be added depending on taste, but I suggest that you do not add ocra, as it does taste good, but gives the soup a slimy texture.",

      "Seal graham crackers in a large ziplock bag and then just completely destroy them with the flat side of a meat tenderizer. Or a rolling pin or a mallet or your own two golden fists of fury, whatever you want, just beat the bejesus out of those crackers until you are left with a sack of graham cracker powder, which you may then pour into a large bowl. In a microwave-safe bowl, heat the almond butter and butter together until smooth; this should take no more than 1 minute of microwave time, in two 30-second intervals, mixing in between. Stir until blended, and then pour into the bowl with the graham cracker crumbs. Add powdered sugar to the bowl and mix it all together until combined into a dough. It will take some time to get all of the powdered sugar incorporated. Patience is a virtue. Roll dough into small, 1-inch balls and spread out on a baking sheet. You may want to line this with parchment paper to make the next step easier, but at this juncture that is not required. Stick into the fridge or freezer to harden. Melt dark chocolate chips (in a double boiler or in the microwave) and stir until smooth and perfect. Dunk each ball into the melted chocolate, and then return to the lined baking sheet. We like to do halfway in chocolate, but all the way would be, of course, totally allowed, because there is not such thing as too much chocolate. For the cleanest experience, dip balls by stabbing them with a long skewer and then placing them, skewer and all, back on the baking sheet. Keep it the fridge or freezer until ready to serve.",

      "For the Cake: Preheat oven to 375\u00b0 F and line a 9-inch by 13-inch rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Grease the paper. In the bowl of a standing mixer, beat the yolks with half of the sugar on high until the mixture is pale and very fluffy, about 5 minutes. Beat in the salt and vanilla, then the cocoa powder. Wash and dry the bowl and whisk, then beat the egg whites on medium high until soft peaks form. With the mixer running, gradually add the rest of the sugar and beat until stiff peaks form. Stir 1/4 of the egg white mixture into the egg yolks to lighten everything up. Then gently fold in the remaining egg whites. Transfer the mixture to the prepared baking sheet and bake until the cake springs back and is dry to the touch, 10 to 15 minutes. Let the cake cool in the pan for 5 minutes (the cake will deflate a bit). Then turn it out onto a clean kitchen cloth that has been dusted with cocoa powder. Gently roll the cake, towel and all, into a long cylinder. Let the cake cool completely in the towel while you prepare the ganache and filling. To Prepare the Ganache: Add the chocolate, butter, and salt to a bowl. Heat the heavy cream to a bare simmer, then add it to the chocolate. Stir until smooth and let sit at room temperature until it cools to a spreadable consistency. To Prepare the Filling: Heat the cream to a bare simmer and turn off the heat. Add the sugar, salt, vanilla bean, and instant coffee. Stir and let steep for 20 minutes. Remove the vanilla bean pod, making sure to scrape out all of the seeds into the milk, then add it to the room temperature mascarpone and stir to combine. To Assemble the Cake: Gently unroll the cake/towel. Spread the mascarpone mixture over the top and use the towel to help roll the cake into a tight cylinder. Cut a 2- to 3-inch piece off of one end at a diagonal to use as a stump. Gently move the cake to a parchment-lined baking sheet. Use the cooled ganache to attach the stump to the log and slather the ganache al over cake"

      "Directions Heat the oven to 450\u00b0F. Bring a large pot of heavily salted water to a boil (Molly uses about 3 tablespoons salt). Add the potatoes and cook until slightly tender, 6 minutes. Drain and pat dry with a clean towel. Tossing the potatoes back into the drained, still-hot pot briefly can also help some of the excess moisture steam away. Scatter the potatoes on a baking sheet and season with salt and pepper. Drizzle with the melted butter and toss to coat using tongs or a thin spatula. Roast until the potatoes are dark brown and crispy, 30 to 45 minutes, tossing halfway through. If the potatoes are sticking stubbornly, don't fuss with them too much-let them keep browning and crisping till they release from the pan. Meanwhile, in a bowl, whisk together the mayonnaise, vinegar, paprika, sugar and shallots. You have two choices for serving: You can either serve the salad warm right away, or, if you want to be able to set it out at a party and stay creamy and crunchy for longer, let the potatoes cool before dressing. When ready to serve, toss the warm or cooled potatoes with half of the paprika mayonnaise (save the rest for dipping or another use). Taste and adjust the seasonings as needed. Top with chives and enjoy!"

      "Mix the dough on low speed to combine the ingredients, stopping the mixer if the dough climbs up the hook or if you need to work in dry ingredients that have settled on the bottom of the bowl. Scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl as needed. It should take about 2 minutes for the dough to come together. If there are lots of dry bits in the bottom of the bowl that just aren't getting worked in, add a tablespoon or two of water. On the other hand, if the dough looks softer than in the photo opposite, add a few pinches of flour.",
      "[Note: Eventually you'll be able to feel the dough and know if you need to add water or flour; it's always better to adjust the ratios when the dough is first coming together at the beginning of mixing rather than wait until the end of the kneading process, since it takes longer for ingredient additions to get worked into the dough mass at this later point and you risk overworking the dough.]",
      "Increase the speed to medium and knead until a smooth dough forms, about 4 minutes. You want the dough to be a bit firm.",
      "Lightly dust your work surface with a little flour, and use a dough scraper to transfer the dough from the mixing bowl to the floured surface. Use your palms to push and tear the top of the dough away from you in one stroke, and then fold that section onto the middle of the dough. Give the dough a quarter turn and repeat the push/tear/fold process for about 1 minute. Then push and pull the dough against the work surface to round it into a ball.",
      "Lightly dust a bowl with flour, add the dough, sprinkle just a little flour on top of the dough, and cover the bowl with plastic wrap. Set the bowl aside at room temperature until the dough has risen by about 70%, about 40 minutes (this will depend on how warm your room is-when the dough proofs in a warmer room it will take less time than in a cooler room).",
      "Use a plastic dough scraper to gently lift the dough out of the bowl and transfer it to a lightly floured work surface (take care not to press out the trapped gas in the dough). Gently pull the dough into a rectangular shape. Use a bench scraper or a chef's knife to divide the dough into 3 equal horizontal strips (you can use a kitchen scale to weigh each piece if you want to be exact). Then divide each piece into 3 smaller equal parts crosswise so you end up with a total of 9 pieces. [Note: It is best not to have an overly floured work surface when rolling dough into cylinders, since the flour makes it hard for the dough to gain enough traction to be shaped into a rope.]",
      "Set a piece of dough lengthwise on your work surface. Use the palm of your hand to flatten the dough into a flat rectangle; then fold the top portion over and use your palm to press the edge into the flat part of the dough. Fold and press 3 more times-the dough will end up as a cylinder about 7 inches long. Set this piece aside and repeat with the other 8 pieces.",
      "Return to the first piece of dough and use both hands to roll the cylinder back and forth to form a long rope, pressing down lightly when you get to the ends of the rope so they are flattened. The rope should be about 14 inches long with tapered ends. Repeat with the remaining 8 cylinders. Lightly flour the long ropes (this allows for the strands of the braid to stay somewhat separate during baking; otherwise, they'd fuse together).",
      "Pinch the ends of 3 ropes together at the top (you can place a weight on top of the ends to hold them in place) and lightly flour the dough. Braid the dough, lifting each piece up and over so the braid is more stacked than it is long; you also want it to be fatter and taller in the middle, and more tapered at the ends. When you get to the end of the ropes and there is nothing left to braid, use your palm to press and seal the ends together, or, for a round festive challah, join both ends of the challah together to form a circle, then flip over so the more attractive side is showing. Repeat with the remaining 6 ropes, creating 3 braided challahs. Place the challahs on parchment paper-lined rimmed sheet pans, cover them with a kitchen towel (or place them inside an unscented plastic bag), and set them aside in a warm, draft-free spot to rise until the loaves have doubled in volume, about 40 minutes (depending on how warm the room is).",
      "Adjust the oven racks to the upper-middle and lower-middle positions and preheat the oven to 425\u00b0F.",
      "Once the challah loaves have roughly doubled in size, do the press test: Press your finger lightly into the dough, remove it, and see if the depression fills in by half. If the depression fills back in quickly and completely, the dough needs more time to rise; if you press the dough and it slightly deflates, the dough has overproofed and will be heavier and less airy after baking.",
      "Make the egg wash by mixing the egg, water, and salt together in a small bowl. Gently brush the entire surface of the loaves with egg wash, taking care not to let it pool in the creases of the braids. You want a nice thin coating. Generously sprinkle the loaves with the seeds. [Note: At the bakery, we dip the egg-washed dough facedown into a large tray of seeds and then roll it from side to side to heavily coat the bread. If you just sprinkle a few pinches over the top, it won't look very generous or appealing after the bread has expanded and baked, so be generous with the seeds whether sprinkling or rolling.]",
      "Bake for 15 minutes. Rotate the bottom sheet pan to the top and the top sheet pan to the bottom (turning each sheet around as you go), and bake until the loaves are golden brown, about 10 minutes longer. Remove the loaves from the oven and set them aside to cool completely on the sheet pans."

Top with the remaining beans and enough of the liquid so that the beans are just barely floating in the liquid. (Refrigerate any extra bean liquid, as you may need it later. Or if there isn't enough bean liquid, add a bit more water, just enough to moisten the beans.)",

After an hour, use the side of a large spoon or a heatproof spatula to break the crust on top in several places. Decrease the oven temperature to 250\u00b0F (120\u00b0C) and bake the cassoulet for another 2 1/2 hours, breaking the crust two more times while cooking. Remove the cassoulet from the oven and let it rest for 15 minutes. If you want to serve the cassoulet reheated, as many prefer it, let it cool to room temperature for 1 1/2 hours, and then refrigerate it.",
      "To serve the cassoulet reheated, remove the cassoulet from the refrigerator 1 hour before you plan to reheat it. Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F (180\u00b0C). Break through a piece of the top of the cassoulet, and if you don't see much liquid surrounding the beans beneath the surface, add some of the reserved bean liquid (or warm water)-just enough to moisten the insides a little, about 1/2 cup (125ml). Bake the cassoulet for 1 1/2 hours, or until it's completely heated through. If the topping isnt crusty, turn the oven up to broil-if you're using a ceramic dish, turn the oven just to 450\u00b0F (230\u00b0C), or whatever maximum heat is indicated by the manufacturer-and watch carefully until the top is browned to your liking. Remove the cassoulet from the oven and let it rest for 15 minutes. Serve the cassoulet in its dish at the table. It requires no other accompaniment, although a glass of Armagnac after (or in place of ) dessert is considered obligatory to aid digestion. As is a pat on the back for making the cassoulet."

      "In a small saucepan, bring the honey and thyme just to a boil, then remove from heat and allow to cool to room temperature. Gently toss the peaches with 2 teaspoons of the flour to coat thoroughly, then toss them with 2 tablepoons of the honey. Set the peaches aside. In a large bowl, whisk the cold flour, sugar, and salt together. Cut in the butter using a pastry blender or forks until the mixture looks like slightly chunky wet sand. Using a fork, stir in 5 tablespoons of water to bring the dough together. You might need to add in another 2 or 3 tablespoons of water, but be careful not to add too much; the dough will leave some unincorporated crumbs at the bottom of the bowl, and the dough itself should not feel at all wet. Dump the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and briefly work the dough by hand to mix the crumbs into the dough. The dough should not look smooth and completely homogeneous; you want to see discernible bits of butter. Gather the dough into a ball, wrap in plastic, and refrigerate for 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 400\u00b0 F. On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough to a circle roughly 14 to 16 inches across and transfer it to the center of a parchment- or Silpat-lined baking sheet. Pile the peaches in the center of dough so that there is about a 2-inch border of dough surrounding the fruit. You can stack the fruit quite high if you like. With lightly floured fingertips, create the galette by bringing up the edges of the dough up and over the edge of the fruit. Overlap the folds and gently pinch them together; continue working around the fruit until there you've formed a lightly mounded volcano of dough with the fruit visible in the mouth of it. Lightly whisk the egg yolk with the milk or water, and brush it over the dough. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes until the dough is golden and the fruit begins to soften a bit. Remove from the oven and allow to cool until it's just warm. Mix 2 tablespoons of the thyme-infused honey with the creme frai"

Drying out the surface in this manner will allow for good caramelization that merely patting dry never will.",

Drizzle red and or green taco sauce ontop to taste (just a few drops evenly across the surface so it doesn't get soggy). Add chopped onions sparingly. Then add the optional sour cream (a few little pea-dime sized peices per taco), top with lettuce, then grated cheddar cheese, and lastly with black olives and press into the shell gently to get them to kinda stick in better without breaking the shell.",

      "Several hours in advance or overnight, soak the dried fruit in water to cover. Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F. Fry the almonds in the hot oil over moderate heat until golden brown, then drain on paper towels and reserve. remove the skin and any visible fat from the chicken portions, thoroughly dry them, then season with the salt and pepper. Fry the chicken in the hot oil until rich brown on all sides, then lift out and drain on paper towels to remove any surplus fat. Lay the pieces side by side in a lidded casserole and surround with the drained fruit. In the same oil gently saute the finely chopped onion and garlic until they turn a rich golden brown (keep the pan lid on for 5 minutes to soften them in the steam, then remove it to finish the browning). Add the spices and stock and honey. Stir well to release any crispy bits adhering to the base of the pan, then bring to the boil and simmer for 5 minutes. Stir in the cornstarch mixed with the lemon juice (or water, if wine has been used). Pour over the chicken. Cover and bake for 1 hour, or until tender when pierced with a sharp knife. Do not overcook as the chicken will soften during the reheating. Garnish the dish with the fried almonds. Note: Any dish containing a black food - be it prunes or olives - is never served on the Eve of Rosh Hashanah in Moroccan Jewish households for fear it would dim the lightness and brightness of the first day of the festival. But on the second night a tagine made with either chicken or lamb is eaten, because of the sweet ingredients - the dried fruit and honey it contains. A similar dish, Poyo kon Prounes, is also to be found in the Graeco-Jewish cuisine.

When the dough has enough elasticity that you can roll it out on a floured surface without it crumbling on you.

As you pat the dough down, make sure you do it as evenly as possible. You want the crust to be approx. 1/8\" high. Use any remaining dough to make \"dough\" strands to attach to the edging. To do this, take a ball of dough and rub your palms together back and forth to make a 1/4\" thick strand. Place the strand around the edge of the pie plate.
