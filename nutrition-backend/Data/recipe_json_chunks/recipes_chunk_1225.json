    "ingredients": [],

      "In a large bowl, whisk the dry ingredients together. Begin preheating the pan on the stovetop.",
      "Separate the eggs into two separate bowls. The whites will end up being beaten separately. The yolks will be beaten with the other wet ingredients.",
      "Beat the yolks with the butter and buttermilk. Beat the egg whites until they just hold a 2 inch peak. Do not overbeat them. Add the yolk-butter-buttermilk mixture to the dry ingredients in a slow steady stream while mixing gently with a rubber spatula. Don't worry if there are still dry patches. Just don't over mix. Fold in the egg whites gently. If the batter seems too thick to be able to flow like molten lava, add a splash more buttermilk and mix in gently. It should be less firm than drop cookies, but more than the usual pancake batter.",
      "Fill the hollows of the greased hot pan and cook the aebleskiver until they are brown and a skewer poked into them comes out clean. (See below for more detail on this process). If you are not having your diners come up and retrieve them as they get done, let cooked skivvers rest in a 200 degree oven until the whole pile is cooked.",
      "MORE COOKING TIPS:.",
      "I have a glass-top range, which works with this pan, as it has extra cast iron at the bottom of the cups making it flatbottomed. (An antique pan designed for a gas range might have spherical bottoms, which might not have enough contact with the glass top.).",
      "I brushed the cups with a little canola oil, and then preheat the pan until a drop of water danced when flicked into one of the cups, but when cooking I turned the heat down a bit lower than I would use for something less thick. More into the medium range. I found in the course of cooking my batch, that you don't want to fill the cups more than 1/2 to 2/3 full, because they will expand as they cook. It is easier to work with about 3 of the holes at a time, at least at my expertise level of making skivvers. So fill batter in three cups, let it cook and firm up a little bit on the bottom, then drop in the chunk of apple or whatever filling you want to use (just a little 1/2 inch chunk of something), and get it pretty close to where it's ready to turn before starting the next group of 2 or 3 holes. Once those are full, go back to the first group and spin the balls a quarter turn so that at the top you see raw along one half and cooked along the other. I was not able to do this first turn with the wooden skewer - I used a teaspoon, being careful of the nonstick finish which is very minimal. I would not recommend the As Seen on TV pan to someone who was not able to cook with lower quality pans, as it is going to stick if you don't know what you are doing, and that nonstick finish is going to disappear with even the slightest level of abuse. Part of knowing what you are doing is to let it cook enough before you try to turn it. Just like a cake, it will start to pull away from the edges of the cup. Watch for that and then GENTLY probe and feel with the edge of the spoon whether it will allow you to lift the bottom of the ball, whether it is ready to come away. This is why lower heat is key - if the heat is too high, you are not going to have time to deal with the transition between raw and sticking, ready to turn, and burnt and sticking. The first turn is the hardest. After that, you can do the other two quarters with the wooden skewer. You can roll it around in the cup more than just three times if that's what you want. Be sure to brush the cups with more oil before refilling with batter. Without the oil, it is going to stick. It's harder to explain than it is to do.",
      "Also, when it is time to clean up, after the pan has cooled, use a brush (like a toothbrush) or plastic scrubby to GENTLY rub off any bits sticking to the pan and just rinse under very hot water. Do not use soap. It's just like taking care of a wok. Towel it dry. Put a dab of oil on a paper towel and wipe the slightly-oily towel in the inside of those cups. Put on the burner so that the sheen of oil is absorbed. Let it cool, and wipe down with a clean paper towel. Make sure there is no dampness left - don't let it air dry.",
      "Just for a little more geekery - Japanese takoyaki, Thai kanom krok, Indian paniyaram, and Dutch poffertjes are similar food technology."

    "title": "meatloaf foil packets",
    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "Tip 1: Meatloaf is dry and crumbly if you don't have enough of the right kind of fat in it, and by itself, beef doesn't have the right kind of fat. That's the reason why beef, pork AND veal are used. Each of these meats have properties which will help with the flavor and texture of the meatloaf. You can buy the meats separately, but many stores carry \"meatloaf mix\" which combines all three meats for your convenience.",
      "Tip 2: Because you'll be cooking the meat and veggies in one packet, it's important to buy beef with the lowest fat possible, since you'll get plenty of fat from the pork. I use 4% fat, and I wouldn't recommend anything over 7%. After it cooks, you'll be left with a thin, flavorful gravy in the bottom of the packet that will not taste too greasy.",
      "Tip 3: Some stores do not carry Lipton Onion and Mushroom soup mix, so if you can only find Onion soup mix, that will be fine, but you'll need to add about a cup of finely chopped mushrooms to your meatloaf mix. Even if you don't like mushrooms, they are necessary to hold in moisture and flavor. You won't taste them in the soup mix or finely chopped.",
      "Tip 4: It's very important not to overmix your meatloaf, as it can become tough. It's best to combine all the ingredients (except the meat and breadcrumbs) in a bowl first, then add the meat and squish it all together until you have a very wet mix, then add as much breadcrumbs as needed to create a sticky loaf that will keep it's shape.",
      "Tip 5: I actually use throw-away pie tins covered in heavy duty foil for when we go camping, because I like the stability of the pie tin. But if you're using only foil, be sure to use two layers of heavy duty foil.",
      "Let's get started! In your largest mixing bowl combine all the wet ingredients including eggs, stir thoroughly.",
      "Add to the mixture, all the remaining ingredients except the meats and the breadcrumbs. Stir thoroughly.",
      "Add all the meats and using your hands (I wear plastic gloves) mash all the ingredients together, making sure to incorporate all the meats together and spices throughout the mixture. At this point it should be very wet.",
      "Finally, add the breadcrumbs to stiffen the mixture. Start with one cup of breadcrumbs and add more as needed to create a sticky loaf that will hold its shape. DO NOT OVERMIX or it will become tough.",
      "At this point, you can cook the meatloaf in a pan as you would any typical meatloaf recipe. If making foil packets, you have two options; either make them ahead for later, or make them now to go straight on the fire. If making ahead, you should separate out the portion size you prefer (I made big, hearty 1/2 lb portions). Place the portions in separate plastic baggies until ready to use. It's important NOT to include your side veggies in the baggie. When you're ready to cook them, shape the portions into mini-meatloaves and place them on top of your choice of veggies and herbs (I like baby red potatoes, onions and carrots with olive oil, seasoning salt, pepper and fresh herbs like rosemary, thyme or sage.) Then wrap it all up in heavy duty foil and cook it on the campfire for 45-60 minutes, depending on portion size. When the veggies are done, the meat will be done, so check the carrots and potatoes for doneness. When it's done, you can add shredded cheese on the top and close the packet for a few minutes to let it melt. We also like ketchup drizzled on the top."

      "Combine the graham cracker crumbs with 1 Tablespoon of sugar and then drizzle the melted butter over the top.",
      "Mix this together well enough to cover all of the crumbs with the butter. Do not let it turn into a paste.",
      "Press the crumbs onto the bottom and about two-thirds of the way up the sides of the springform pan. It's ok if it doesn't go all the way up the sides. You want part of the cheesecake to extend above the crust.",
      "Bake for 5 minutes, then chill it in a refrigerator for up to 24 hours.",
      "**************Filling*************.",
      "The cream cheese should be at room temperature before you begin mixing, or you'll end up with lumps in your cheesecake. Using cold cream cheese also leads to overbeating--whipping too much air into the batter--which forms unattractive air bubbles on the surface of the cake. Reduced fat and nonfat cream cheeses contain fillers that might prevent the cheesecake from setting properly. Never substitute whipped cream cheese for the solid block.",
      "Combine the softened cream cheese 1 C sugar, and vanilla in a large mixing bowl.",
      "Mix the cream cheese and sugar by itself until it's smooth and light, before adding any other ingredients. If you end up with lumps in your batter, run the mixture through a sieve or give it a quick spin in the food processor and you'll have silky smooth results. Mix until smooth using an electric mixer (remove the lumps but don't over-mix). Be sure to mix your cheesecake batter well, eliminating all possible lumps in the cream cheese BEFORE you add the eggs. It is the eggs that will hold air in the batter, so add them last, and mix as little as possible once they are in the mix.",
      "Add the pumpkin, cinnamon, nutmeg and allspice and continue beating until smooth and creamy.",
      "Lightly beat room temp eggs and add to batter mixture, and blend well, do not over whip as adding eggs and over mixing can add air to the mixture which will want to escape while baking and create a crack.",
      "Pour the mixture into the graham cracker crust.",
      "Note: Cheesecake is a custard at heart. It's delicate, so you want to bake it slowly and evenly without browning the top. The most effective way to do this is to bake it in a water bath. Since water evaporates at the boiling point, the water bath will never get hotter than 212 degrees F (100 degrees C), no matter what the oven temperature. This means that the outer edge of your cheesecake won't bake faster than the center, which can cause it to souffle, sink, and crack. (see water bath instructions below).",
      "Bake in water bath for 60-70 minutes. Don't over bake the cheesecake. When perfectly done, there will still be a two to three-inch wobbly spot in the middle of the cheesecake; the texture will smooth out as it cools.",
      "Remove from the oven and allow to cool at room temperature.",
      "When the cheesecake has come to room temperature, put it into the refrigerator.",
      "When the cheesecake has chilled or you've lost all will-power, release the spring and remove the sides of the pan.",
      "**********Water Bath Instructions**************.",
      "To prevent water from seeping into the removable bottom of the springform pan, wrap aluminum foil completely around the bottom and halfway up the sides of the pan in a criss-cross pattern. Or another method is to place a roasting bag around pan (thanks Laura!). Place the cheesecake into a jellyroll pan (or any baking pan with sides) and place the pans into the oven. I use a disposable foil roasting pan. Use a teakettle to fill the outer pan with hot water. Cheesecakes usually bake for about 11/2 hours, so check the bath after the first hour and refill if necessary.",
      "Because cheesecake is very soft, it can be difficult to judge when it is done cooking. One way to check for doneness is to take the cake's internal temperature with an instant-read thermometer. The ideal temperature for a cheesecake is around 160 to 165 degrees F (70 to 72 degrees C). You can also insert a small knife into the center of the cake and if it comes out clean, the cake is done. Some bakers turn off the oven and leave the cheesecake in it for an additional hour to ensure that it sets completely.",
      "Once the cheesecake has been removed from the oven, it needs to chill thoroughly--preferably overnight. The cake will have pulled away the edges of the pan. Carefully run a small knife around the edge of the pan to loosen any bits that might stick to the pan.",
      "Chill overnight for best results.",
      "For a seamless look, you can smooth the sides of the cheesecake with a hot, wet knife."

Bake in 15 minute increments checking to see if it's done by using toothpick. Cobbler will be done when the toothpick comes out with no batter on the toothpick. Don't worry too much about the color of the crust. It's mostly the cinnamon making it look dark (see picture). You should be able to tell the difference between cinnamon brown and burnt.",
      "I serve mine with homemade whipped topping (see picture) and here's how I do that even though I don't list these ingredients in the main ingredient list -- It's better to use a stand mixer because of the time it takes to blend but a hand mixer will work. Place your bowl (if using a hand mixer use a deep mixing bowl) and beaters in the freezer for at least 30 minutes before making whipped cream. You need 2 cups heavy whipping cream (I used Promise Land or Organic Farms) 6 tablespoons sugar and 2 teaspoons of real vanilla extract. Mix on high until stiff peaks form (approx 6-7 minutes). Whipped cream will keep in refrigerator up to 2 days tightly covered. This recipe will make enough whipped cream for all 10 servings with a pretty good dollop of it."

    "title": "step-by-step meringue",
    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "If you are using the meringue for a baked pie begin making the meringue at least 20 minutes before the pie is done baking (if using refrigerated eggs as preferred) so that the meringue can be applied to a piping hot filling. Once the meringue is made it should be applied to the pie within 5 minutes or it will begin to lose volume. If you are using the meringue for a refrigerated pie instead of using Cream of Tartar make a cornstarch mixture by combining 1 tablespoon of cornstarch and mixing thoroughly with 1/3 cup of cold water, heat the mixture on the stove in a small saucepan while stirring constantly over low heat until it thickens, then set aside to cool.",
      "For a meringue with more volume start with refrigerated eggs that are at least several days old. Older egg whites (3-4 days old) create more volume than newer egg whites. Cold eggs separate more easily than temperate eggs because cold egg whites hold together better. Use a clean dry large glass or stainless steel mixing bowl to beat the egg whites in, a small clean dry dish to place the egg in and clean dry beaters to beat the egg whites with. Egg whites will not whip as well if there is any grease or moisture on the bowl, dish or beaters.",
      "Separate the egg yolks from the egg whites, cracking the egg shell gently in the center of the side by knocking it against the counter. Placing your thumbnails on either side of the crack in the egg shell, gently pull the egg shell halves apart over the dish, transferring the egg yolk from one shell half to the other, allowing the egg white to fall into the dish. Repeat this until all the egg white has fallen into the bowl then set aside the egg yolk. If the egg yolk breaks during this step make certain to remove any traces of yolk (or egg shell) from the egg whites in the dish using an empty egg shell half or a clean dry spoon. The smallest amount of egg yolk in the egg white mixture can cause the egg whites to fail to whip properly. When all the egg white has been placed in the dish and you are certain that the egg white has no yolk or shell in it - transfer the egg whites to the mixing bowl and repeat for all the remaining eggs. Set the egg whites aside.",
      "If using refrigerated eggs allow 15 to 20 minutes for the egg whites to warm to room temperature. Using either the beaters or a clean dry whisk beat the egg whites until foamy then add the salt and beat well. If you are using the meringue on a pie that will not be refrigerated add the 1/2 teaspoon Cream of Tartar or 1 tablespoon Piping Gel to the egg white mixture and beat until incorporated. Note: once you start the mixing process you need to continue beating without taking any breaks. Set the mixer to medium high and beat the egg whites until they form soft peaks (peaks that droop to one side when lifting the beaters away from the mixture).",
      "Reduce the mixer speed to medium and begin to gradually beat the sugar into the egg white mixture one tablespoon at a time. When you have finished adding the sugar it is very important to make certain that the sugar is completely dissolved into the mixture. To test for this simply rub a tiny bit of meringue between your fingers - if you feel any grit in the meringue then the sugar has not been completely incorporated - beat for a minute longer and test again. Using extra fine sugar makes this process faster and easier than using table sugar. For a softer meringue use between 1/2 to 3/4 cup of sugar (to prevent weeping use just 1/2 cup), for a harder meringue use between 3/4 to 1 cup of sugar (much more likely to weep). A \"French Meringue\" would require 1 cup of sugar. If you are using the meringue with a refrigerated pie begin incorporating the cooled cornstarch mixture into the meringue one tablespoon at a time until you have finished adding the cornstarch mixture. Now add the vanilla extract and beat until it is well blended into the meringue. The beating process is complete when you can hold a spoonful of meringue upside down and none of the mixture falls off (again make certain there is no sugar 'grit' remaining in the meringue). Continue beating the meringue until the peaks are as stiff as you desire. Once the meringue forms stiff peaks (peaks that hold their exact position when the beaters are removed from the mixture) stop beating - do not over beat the mixture.",
      "Begin placing the meringue on top of the filling (piping hot if the pie was baked). Putting the meringue on a hot filling will seal the meringue underneath and will help to protect the meringue. Make certain that the meringue touches the edges of the pie crust as this will help to prevent shrinking later. Finish spreading the meringue over the pie.",
      "Bake the meringue in an oven that is preheated to 325 degrees. Bake for 20 to 30 minutes - be careful to watch the meringue closely as it will begin to brown quickly once it nears the end of the baking cycle. Overcooking can cause the meringue to become tough, sweat or burn. If you want a meringue that is harder or more done lower the temperature to between 250 to 300 degrees and bake for a longer period of time. Meringues should be baked until light brown in color and dry to the touch.",
      "Serving & Storage: Cut a meringue pie using a cold wet knife dipping between cuts in cold water. There are conflicting answers on whether or not baked meringues need to be refrigerated. They are perfectly safe at room temperatures for up to 2 hours. Meringue pies should be stored in air-tight containers and are best eaten within a day or two. If the pie is refrigerated it will eventually weep. Cooked meringue can be stored refrigerated for several days or frozen for up to 3 months. Meringue with higher sugar content is more likely to weep since it is the sugar in the meringue that attracts moisture. Using the cornstarch mixture in making the meringue helps to reduce weeping in refrigerated or frozen meringue pies.",
      "A final note: sweating or weeping meringue on fairly fresh pies is caused by one or more of the following conditions: over-baking, over-beating, under-beating, high humidity, refrigeration or when the meringue is placed on a cool filling."

Use your fingers to depress a well in the bottom and fill each one with about 1 soup ladle full of the chicken mixture. Top with about a tablespoon of the tomato mango relish. Replace the top and spoon just a bit of both the sauce and relish over the top. Serve hot."

Press into scone trays or similar, score the top with a knife into the size pieces you want (little pieces for small dogs, larger for your big guys) and bake in a slow oven until the biscuit is quite dry. I find the dogs just love them, they contain all the goodies they need and are also very handy for traveling. I actually add a few capsules of fish oil and empty capsules of glucosamine into my mix as my husky has arthritis in his knees.It helps her tremendously. Just break up the pieces when cooked and cool and store in airtight containers. Get a few trays done and freeze some also."

I used white and brown royal icing to create the final coat and for the long eyes I piped several strips of thick royal icing on parchment and allowed it to dry, then gently pierced the cakes head with them and did a royal icing flooding over top with a watered-down batch.

Once you have created your logs tightly roll them in aluminum foil, shiny side inches Make sure to use lots of foil because your seitan logs will try to expand in the oven and they will, I have done it, explode out of the foil. Seal the ends by twisting and pushing in to compact the seitan even more. You want to make a tight seal. Place logs lengthwise on oven racks and bake for 1 hour, turning over after 30 minutes.

If you want to thinly slice them you will need to do this before placing them in the refridgerator. Refridgerating them makes it impossible to thinly slice. I have only had success using my food processor when attempting to make a thin slice. Anything manual just crumbles the seitan.
