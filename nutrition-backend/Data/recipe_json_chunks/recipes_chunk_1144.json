Just eliminate all of the meatball ingredients in the recipe, warm the sauce as above, then stir in the frozen meatballs with the heated sauce.

      "2. \tYou will probably have a couple of galettes that don't work out the first time. Usually I find it takes a couple to get into the technique!",
      "1. \tHeat a large non-stick frying pan over medium heat. You might like to melt some butter (about 1 tablespoon) to start with and after every 2-3 galettes, depending on how \"non stick\" your pan is. One of my pans does not require any butter, some of my older ones do.",
      "2. \tUsing a half-cup measure, pour batter into the centre of the pan and immediately swirl the pan to spread the mixture - you're looking for a galettethat's about 8-9 inches across so it will be very thin.",
      "As the edges begin to crisp up a little, make sure the galette is not sticking, especially in the centre. I use a large, thin plastic spatula to keep this in check.",
      "3. \tYou'll know the galette is ready to flip when it's completely dry looking on top. It might bubble and look a little \"lacy\" but that's fine - in fact that's perfect!",
      "4. \tFlip the galette carefully and immediately add the cheese in the centre. Once the edges of the cheese have started to melt, add the mushrooms, saving a couple for garnish. Press them into the cheese. Cook a minute or so then add the ham.",
      "5. \tFold in the sides of the galette to slightly cover the fillings. Traditionally thegalette is served in a square shape with all four sides folded in but I kind of like with just two sides folded over (oh, and it's pretty hard to make it stay folded when it's all four corners!).",
      "6. \tTop the completed galette with the mushrooms you set aside and a sprinkle of chives.",
      "Bon appetit!"

      "My Note: I did do 2 changes: 1- we halved them, so that we wouldn't get \"mushy middles\", lol. And, I read somewhere that if you remove the \"choke\" that's at the bottom of the sprout (inside), the brussel sprout will not be bitter. Voila! it worked! These yummmy, salty, nutty, crunchy, carmelized brussel sprouts were SO good. No bitterness what so ever! The super dark carmelized parts of the roasted bsprouts were the best! LUVVVVV this recipe, and will make over and over again!",
      "This time, The only difference is that I sprinkle a few cloves of minced garlic on top as the sprouts roast, which is delicious--the roasted garlic is sweet and compliments the sprouts without overpowering them. Also, I usually parboil the sprouts first (for 2 minutes). This draws out bitterness, and cuts down on roasting time (25 minutes to nicely blackened).",
      "Do it just long enough for the outer leaves to turn brown/crispy, about 15 minutes. So easy, so delicious. Sometimes I sprinkle balsamic vinegar on top."

When all has melted and combined take off heat and evenly pour caramel topping over the soaked bread. Bake uncovered in a 350 degree oven about 45 minutes, or until puffed, bubbly and golden brown. Let sit 10-15 minutes before serving. ( I like to keep a cookie sheet or a piece of tin foil under the baking dish while cooking because once in a while this likes to bubble over on you).

Also because it was summer I added fresh chopped herbs to the mayo mixture, parsley, rosemary and basil. As it was a poolside lunch, I put the prepared sandwiches on a foil lined, thick cookie sheet and put it on the grill and closd the lid for about 5 minutes. But broiling would give it a bubbly top. Also, THICK DENSE bread is a MUST! And remember to toast the bread first. My grandaughter the vegetarian even asked for the recipe. She marinated thinly sliced red onion along with the tomatoes, used a little less of the Parmesan, and added a thin slice of Swiss cheese. Also, since her husband loves BLT's, added a few pre-cooked slices of bacon to his before adding the tomato/onion topping and the cheese -- he loved it!",
