In bowl of stand mixer fitted with dough hook, mix flour, potato flakes, and 11/2 teaspoons salt until combined. With mixer on low, add water mixture in steady stream and mix until dough comes together, about 1 minute.

On clean surface, form each piece into rough ball by pinching and pulling the edges under so that the top is smooth.

Turn out onto floured work surface and knead until dough is smooth and forms cohesive ball, about 10 minutes. Proceed as directed.",

When the rolls are just beginning to brown (about 5 minutes), remove them from the oven, cool, and freeze for up to a month. To finish, let the parbaked rolls sit on a parchment-lined baking sheet at room temperature for 1 hour. Bake in a 400-degree oven until they're golden brown, about 10 minutes."

      "Pans needed: Bundt cake pan of 10 inches or larger in diameter, preferably a thick or heavy pan. Large bowl to mix crust. Two medium to large size bowls, plus a colander, to drain sliced apples.",
      "Peel and slice apples into equal-sized pieces. (Some folks use thin slices, some use thick slices, and some prefer to cube their apples. This is your preference, but the apple slices should be roughly the same size.) Mix in 1/4 cup sugar. Place a colander into a large bowl, then add the mixed apple slices to the colander. Let the liquid drain from the apple slices for 90 minutes.",
      "While the apples are draining, preheat your oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit and prepare your pie crust.",
      "In a large bowl, mix together the ingredients in order: flour, suet, baking powder, brown sugar. salt. Stir together, then mix in spices: allspice, cardamon, ginger. Add brandy and 1/4 cup water. Stir it all together until you are close to forming a dough, then add the remaining 1/4 cup of water and stir. Once the crust dough is thick in consistency, you can then knead the dough with your hands. If the dough is not at the right consistency then add more water, a tablespoon at a time, until you are left with thick dough and no dry crumbs on the side and bottom of the bowl. Separate the mound of dough into two halves, and roll them into two balls of dough.",
      "Grease the entire inside of the bundt pan with shortening, to prevent sticking when the finished pie comes out.",
      "Press one of the balls of dough with a rolling pin into a flat circle. Place it into the bundt pan, and press it out with your hands so that every inch of the inside of the pan is covered. I found the pie crust was indeed very thick and solid, and it was much easier to roll out with a rolling pin than a typical pie crust. I pressed it into the bundt pan by hand, and spent maybe twenty minutes or more pressing the pie crust up along the inner and outer edges of the pan.",
      "When the apples have finished draining, reserve (keep) the drained apple juice. Return the apples to the big mixing bowl. In order to add more flavor to the crust, I poured some of the reserved apple juice from the apple slices into the pan and swirled it around, then drained out the excess.",
      "In a large bowl, mix the drained apples together with the pie filling ingredients. Add the filling to the bundt pan.",
      "With a rolling pin, press the other ball of dough into a second round crust to add to the top of the pan - and when the pie is flipped over, this will be the bottom of the pie. Because of this, it will be necessary to double over and press down the edges all around the pan. This will crimp it down with the inner crust, and seal the pie as it bakes in the oven.",
      "Bake the pie in your oven at 350 degrees F for at least 75 to 80 minutes (1 hour plus 15 to 20 minutes).",
      "Remove the pie from the oven. At this point the torture begins! It is absolutely necessary to let the pie sit and settle for one hour before flipping the bundt pan over. After this, wait for another hour before lifting the pan off if the finished pie.",
      "Finally, prepare the pie glaze: Add 2 cups powdered confectioner's sugar to a medium sized bowl. Bring applejack brandy to a boil. Lower temperature, and simmer to boil off the alcohol. As the liquor is simmering, add 2 tablespoons of butter, and stir until the butter is melted. Add the mixture of brandy and butter to the powdered sugar. Add 2 tablespoons of heavy cream, plus 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon and 1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract. Stir it all into a thick liquid or a thin paste. Drizzle the glaze over the pie."

Place on parchment paper, sprinkle with nonpareils, and let dry.",

Process 20 to 30 seconds until butter is cut in evenly. Add egg yolks and vanilla and process until mixture forms a ball. Remove, divide into 4 equal balls, flatten each and cover with plastic wrap. Refrigerate overnight.",
      "Preheat over to 375 degrees. Cut aluminum foil to fit approximately 4 cookie sheets. Using a well floured pastry cloth and rolling pin cover, roll 1 section of dough, leaving the rest refrigerated until needed. Roll evenly approximately 1/8\" thick (or actually 1/8\" thin). Using small size cookies cutters, cut cookies (they should remain in the cutter, then tap out on to the foil lined cookie sheets). Place cookies 1/2 inch apart. Sprinkle with sugar crystals. (Easier to do one whole sheet red, next sheet green). Reroll scraps and roll out, trying to handle dough as little as possible. Don't reroll dough a third time, use another refrigerated section of dough. Bake approximately 8 minutes, one sheet at a time. Cookies should be slightly golden, remove quickly as once they start to brown, they could burn fast. Immediately slide foil off cookie sheet and leave cookies on foil to cool. Repeat with remaining dough. Store in a wax paper lined, cookie tin. Cookies reach their taste potential after a day and will stay fresh in a cookie tin approximatelly 3 weeks. Actual yield is based on the size cookie cutter used. I use a very small size, approximately 1 1/2 \" across."

Include the ribs and as much of the leafy greens as you can--they're tasty too! (My cleaning approach for a particularly muddy head of celery was to chop first, discarding the dried out tops, dunk it all in a bowl of cold water and swish around to get the dirt to fall to the bottom, and then scoop out the celery pieces into a salad spinner to remove excess water.).",
      "In a medium to large size saucepan on the stove top, saute the celery (you may need to work in two to three batches depending on your pan size and amount of celery) in the 1 tbsp extra virgin olive oil. (If you saute in batches, only use a total of 1 tbsp oil--e.g. if you saute in two batches use about 1/2 tbsp per batch.) When sauteing, try to develop a little of the browning/carmelization that will give the dish extra flavor by not stirring constantly. When the celery has cooked to your desired done-ness (e.g., I like mine lightly sauteed and still a little crispy), lightly salt and transfer to a 8 x 8 square glass baking dish. Repeat until all celery is sauteed and in the baking dish.",
      "(Assuming you have not burned the celery in the pot) Using the same hot pot you just emptied of the last batch of sauteed celery, over medium heat add another 1 tbsp of olive oil and the diced onion. Saute for a few minutes to your desired done-ness. Add the 1 1/2 tbsp butter and allow to thoroughly melt, stirring in to the onions. Once melted, add the 1 1/2 tbsp flour and stir well. Keep stirring for a few minutes--not allowing to burn--as the roux comes together. (Just keep it moving in the pan, and take it off the heat if you think it is starting to burn.).",
      "Slowly add small amount of the milk, stirring well after each addition to thoroughly incorporate. Add the nutmeg and taste for seasoning. You'll probably need to add more salt, maybe even a few tablespoons (depending on the type of salt you use). Keep stirring the mixture over medium heat until you get the seasonings right and the mixture comes just up to a boil and thickens. Turn off the heat.",
      "Mix the melted butter with the bread crumbs.",
      "Add the sauteed celery back in and stir to coat the celery with the creamy mixture. Transfer the creamy celery mixture back to the baking dish. Top with the butter/bread crumb mixture and bake (or broil if you pan can handle it) in the oven just to brown the bread crumbs.",
      "Variations: You could add or substitute other vegetables in this dish, e.g., peas, carrots, potatoes, brussel sprouts, cubed squash, asparagus, leafy greens. You could also add herbs and spices to your liking. You could add shredded cheese to the roux once it comes together to give it a cheesier flavor. You can omit the bread crumb topping--I often do."
