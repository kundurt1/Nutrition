      "After 30 minutes, season the pork generously with salt and pepper.",
      "Reserve the marinade.",
      "Preheat the oven to 325F.",
      "Heat a large saute pan over high heat for 3 minutes.",
      "Swirl in the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil, and wait a minute or two, until the pan is very hot, almost smoking.",
      "Place the pork loin in the pan, and sear it on all sides until well browned and caramelized.",
      "Dont turn or move the pork too quickly or all the mustard will be left in the pan and not on the pork.",

      "Wait 1 to 2 minutes and then deglaze it with the chicken stock or water.",
      "Bring to a boil, whisking and scraping the bottom of the pan to release the crispy bits.",
      "Swirl in 3 tablespoons butter and set aside.",
      "Arrange the haricots verts and spring onions on a large warm platter.",
      "Slice the pork thinly, about 1/4-inch thick, and fan the meat over the beans.",

      "Shower the mustard breadcrumbs over the top.",
      "Blanch the haricots verts in a large pot of salted boiling water 2 to 3 minutes, until tender but still al dente.",

      "Heat two pans over medium-high heat for 2 minutes.",
      "(In order to get nice color on the onions and preserve their beautiful shape, its best to cook them in two large pans so they are not crowded.)",

      "Preheat the oven to 375F.",
      "Place the breadcrumbs in a medium bowl.",
      "Heat a small saute pan over medium heat for 1 minute.",

      "Transfer the breadcrumbs to a baking sheet, and toast them 10 to 12 minutes, stirring often, until theyre golden brown and crispy.",
      "Marinate the pork the day before serving.",
