To cook and smoke the bird: Remove the bird from the brine and pat dry. Lightly brush the bird with olive oil and set aside. Prepare the bbq by lighting 24 charcoal briquettes. When hot and spotted gray, divide in half and push to opposite sides of the grate. Place a metal drip pan which is at least 1 in deep. Place a 1/2 C or so of the wood smoking chips in the center of a double layer of heavy duty foil. Form the foil into a bag shape leaving the top open and place on top of one of the mounds of the hot coals.",
      "Put the upper rack of the bbq in place and then put the turkey centered over the drip pan. Cover the bbq and partially close the air vents to restrict the oxygen but not so much that you put out the coals. Regulate the vents to keep the chips smoking and the coals slowly burning. Check every 25 minutes or so to make sure the coals are still hot and smoke is continuing. Add charcoal and additional chips as needed. Internal temperature of the barbeque should be in the 275 to 325 degree range. The smoke should keep going for 1 1/2 to 2 hours. After that, remove any wood chips and continue cooking without smoke until the turkey is done. This insures that the turkey going to be too smoky in flavor but you can adjust to your own taste. The total cooking time will be approximately 3 to 3 1/2 hours. Internal temperature should be 155 to 160 degrees when tested at the thickest part or you can test by cutting an incision at the hip/thigh joint and making sure the meat is cooked and juices run clear. Remove turkey from the barbeque and allow to rest for at least 15 minutes before carving."

Cook until bubbles form on top and the batter is set 2/3 of the way through. Check that the bottom is golden brown then flip the pancake gently. When the second side is light brown, remove from the heat. Make a stack of 3 pancakes and pour real maple syrup over the top. To keep pancakes hot preheat oven to 100C &c.."

Add 2 1/2 teaspoons cold water, and lightly work it into the flour, using your fingers, slightly cupped together, or a fork. Gather the dough into a ball, sprinkle a few drops of water over any remaining dry ingredients, and gather them together. Cover the dough with waxed paper or plastic wrap, flatten it into a disk, and let it rest at least 30 minutes in the refrigerator before using. The dough can also be frozen at this point for future use.",

Roll it out with firm, even strokes into a circle about 1/8 inch thick. Pick it up on the rolling pin and slide it onto the pie dish or tart mold. Or, alternatively, fold it into quarters, lay it with the point in the center of the pan, then unfold. Trim the edges, leaving on overhang of an inch or so; then fold the overhang under and crimp the edge.",

When ready to use, preheat the oven to 425\u00b0F. Set the frozen tart shell directly into the oven, and bake until the crust has a \"set\" appearance and is just beginning to color, about 8-10 minutes. While the crust is baking, check to see that the bottom is not swelling with steam and air. If it does, prick it lightly with a paring knife.",

      "Meanwhile, line a large rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper and spray with nonstick spray. Arrange matzo on parchment with no gaps in between (it's ok if they overlap slightly).",
      "Whisk together butter, brown sugar, vanilla, and salt in a medium pot. Whisking occasionally, bring to a high simmer over medium heat, about 3 minutes. Once mixture is simmering, whisk constantly, until it turns a light brown, thickens, and starts to pull away from the sides of the pot, about 3 minutes. Immediately pour onto matzo, covering completely. Using a spatula, quickly spread caramel so matzo has an even coating.",
      "Bake matzo until caramel is golden brown and bubbling, 14-16 minutes. Watch carefully to make sure caramel doesn't burn. If it starts to darken too quickly, remove from oven and lower heat to 325\u00b0F; return to oven after a few minutes and continue to bake, watching closely.",
      "Meanwhile, place chocolate in a heatproof bowl set over a small pot of simmering water and stir occasionally until melted. (Or, place chocolate in a microwave-safe bowl and heat in 20-second bursts in the microwave, stirring between each burst, until melted.)",
      "Remove matzo from oven and sprinkle immediately with reserved coconut and almonds. Drizzle with chocolate. Let cool slightly, then place the baking sheet with the matzo crunch in the refrigerator until cooled and set, at least 30 minutes or up to overnight. Break matzo crunch into pieces and serve."

Transfer the pieces to the unheated portion of the grill, cover the grill and cook.

The chicken should show no sign of pink, and the internal temperature should register at least 160\u00b0F. Continue cooking the chicken as needed, up to 10 minutes more, but be careful not to overcook.

    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "In a heavy-bottomed skillet, melt a tablespoon of butter. Saute the garlic over medium-low heat until translucent and very soft. Chop a few of the sage leaves and add them to the skillet. Sprinkle with Kosher salt and saute for another minute or so, until the leaves crisp up a little bit.",
      "",
      "In a large bowl, scrape the contents of the skillet in with the mashed squash. Add the Parmesan and nutmeg, and combine well. Set aside.",
      "",
      "Now, I am funny about the wonton wrappers: I don't think they hold up very well unless they're doubled up. So, I use 4 wrappers per ravioli, brushing one side of a wonton wrapper with egg wash and then laying another wrapper on top of it, pressing to seal. I repeat this process with another pair of wrappers. Then, spoon filling on top of one double sheet, then top with the other double sheet and seal the edges with egg wash. It's a little extra trouble to do it this way, but I once had a whole batch fall apart in the boiling water with only single sheets, so I prefer to play it safe. (Of course, homemade pasta would be best).",
      "",
      "Once the ravioli are assembled, set them aside. Bring a pot of water to boil. Add the ravioli and cook until they float, about 3 or 4 minutes. (You may have to do this in batches). Drain and arrange on plates.",
      "",
      "While the ravioli are cooking, brown the sausage in the skillet (the one you cooked the garlic in) until cooked through. Remove with a slotted spoon. Add the butter and cook over medium until it's just beginning to turn golden. Add the pine nuts and remaining whole sage leaves. Stir and cook until the sage leaves are crispy. Watch carefully so that the butter doesn't burn. Divide the sauce evenly between the plates of ravioli. Top with the sausage and sprinkle with Parmesan cheese. Serves 2 hungry people for dinner, with a couple of extra ravioli left over.",

Toss the meat in a little seasoned flour, then add it to the pan with all the vegetables, the tomato puree, wine and stock, and gently stir together. Season generously with freshly ground black pepper and just a little salt. Bring to the boil, place a lid on top, then cook in the preheated oven until the meat is tender. Sometimes this takes 3 hours, sometimes 4 - it depends on what cut of meat you're using and how fresh it is. The only way to test is to mash up a piece of meat and if it falls apart easily it's ready. Once it's cooked, you can turn the oven down to about 110\u00b0C/225\u00b0F/gas 1/4 and just hold it there until you're ready to eat.",

Mix the lemon zest, chopped rosemary and garlic together and sprinkle over the stew before eating. Just the smallest amount will make a world of difference - as soon as it hits the hot stew it will release an amazing fragrance."

Set your barbecue for indirect grilling at 225\u00b0F. In a gas barbecue, use a smoker box for your wood chips; for charcoal barbecues, place a handful of soaked wood chips on the surface of the charcoal. Place the pork shoulder on the barbecue, close the lid. Begin coating with apple juice mop an hour into the cooking process and continue to baste every half hour. Leave pork on grill until the internal temperature of the pork reaches 185\u00b0-190\u00b0 F. This could take from 6 to 10 hours, depending on weather conditions. Monitor the internal temperature of the pork using a meat thermometer. Once it has reached a temperature remove it from the barbecue, wrap it tightly in foil and allow it to rest for at least an hour before pulling. Do not skip this step, as it is the final step in allowing the connective tissue to completely break down, resulting in tender, moist pork. Shred using pork claws or a meat fork.

The corn can be easily replaced by other vegetables that offer a contrast in taste and texture: small fresh fava beans (my favorite), peas, 1-inch lengths of green beans. Use about the same volume measure. And I love this soup made with half potatoes and half parsnips or young turnips, or rutabaga."

When they are lukewarm, remove them from the pan. Remove the tails and cut into sections about 2 inches long. Split the body shells and crack the claws. From the shells, remove the green liver, or tomalley. Put it in a small saucepan and add 3 tablespoons of the butter and the flour. Heat this mixture gently, while whisking into a smooth paste, and add enough of the wine in which the lobsters were cooked to make a smooth sauce the consistency of light cream. Season lightly and carefully with white pepper to taste, and when the sauce is smooth, blend in the chopped chervil and tarragon leaves. Place the lobster pieces in a large deep casserole dish and add the rest of the butter (melted). Cover and gently reheat. When the butter is foaming, pour the slightly heated Pernod over the lobsters sections and set aflame. When it has burned out, add the sauce. Lift the lobster pieces gently with a spoon to let the sauce penetrate completely. Cover the dish and set in a very slack over (225 degrees) for 10 minutes to let the lobster become imbued with the various flavors. Serve sprinkled with chopped tarragon."

Transfer skillet to oven and roast chicken just until cooked through (an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of breast should register 160\u00b0F), 15-20 minutes.

Pour in juices that have pooled under chicken on plate; mix in parsley. Return chicken to skillet to serve."
