If you want to make the 4 ounce size, you'll need to bake them for about 15-20 minutes and you'll probably only get about 10 cookies out of this recipe. These are best eaten on the day they are made (they are ESPECIALLY great warm out of the oven - like most chocolate chip cookies). What you don't eat, put into an airtight container. To freshen them after a few days (if they last that long), give them a quick nuke in the microwave for 3-5 seconds. Also, for a little variation, try adding 1 cup of chopped walnuts.",

      "Note: Use 2 To 3 varieties of apples to add flavor depth, and make sure that at least half of the apples are a variety that is very firm and will hold their shape well when cooked. This will allow for the chunks in the sauce. My all-time favorite apple is the Haralson, a product of the University of Minnesota. It is tart and crisp and juicy. The perfect apple for baking with and making applesauce!",
      "Fill a large pot or stock pot half-full with cold water. Stir in lemon juice. Peel, quarter, and core the apples. (I use this gadget that cores and cuts. We use it a lot all year long-it saves so much time!) Then slice the quarters cross-wise, into 1/4\" to 1/2\" thick slices, depending on how chunky you like your sauce. Thicker slices will allow for more chunks. Add apple slices to water and lemon juice mixture. When all the apples are in the pot, the water should reach about halfway up the apples in your pot. If there is too much water, pour some off. Too little? Then add some water. Don't worry about exactness. This is more a method than a recipe!",
      "Place the pot of apples on the stovetop over medium-high heat. Add sugar and cinnamon to your liking. Start out with less sugar than you think you might want, you can always add more later in the process. My mom likes it sweet, my dad likes it tart. The sweetness is all up to you!",
      "Stir the apples occasionally, making sure they aren't scorching on the bottom of your pot. If they are scorching, turn the heat down a bit. If the mixture is lacking moisture, but the sauce isn't soft and broken down to your liking yet, add some more water. When the sauce is starting to get to your desired consistency, which will take an hour or two, take a sample out and let it cool a bit. Taste it for sweetness and add more sugar and cinnamon if desired. When the applesauce is to your liking in both texture and flavor, remove the pot from the heat.",
      "Store the applesauce in a large covered bowl or in jars, and refrigerate. It will keep well in the refrigerator for a few weeks. You can also freeze it in freezer-safe containers.",
      "Or do a simple water bath canning process: Turn canning jars upside down in a wide pan with 1\" of water in it and bring to a medium boil. Let the jars get hot and steamy and sanitized for 10 minutes in the boiling water. In a small pan over medium-high heat, add 1/2\" of water and the jar lids. Bring to a medium boil and sanitize for 10 minutes. Working with 1 jar at a time, fill with apple sauce, leaving 1\" head space. Wipe off the rims of the jars with a clean dry towel, top with a hot lid, and screw on a ring, just finger-tight. Process in a boiling water bath, with water covering jars by 1\", for 20 minutes. Remove jars from boiling water and let them cool on a towel on the counter overnight, undisturbed. After they have been sitting for awhile, you will start hearing the jars \"pop\". Such a fun sound! The following day, check that the jars have sealed by pressing down in the center of the lids. If the lid pops up and down, the jar hasn't sealed and should be placed in the refrigerator to eat within a few weeks. If the lid is sucked down and does not move, it has sealed, and can be stored for a year or so in the pantry.",
      "To double this recipe (what I do): You will need at least an 8-quart stock pot or 2 smaller stock pots. Double all ingredients. The cooking time will increase to 2 to 2-1/2 hours if using one large (8-quart or larger) stock pot. Because you will be using more jars, you will need to sterilize your jars in batches. It's really not that much more work for double the amount of applesauce!"

      "How to seed a pomegranate: This is the best trick that I've found. Seeding your pomegranate this way will minimize the loss of juice and will save your hands and counter tops from juice stains. Fill a medium sized bowl with cold water. Cut your pomegranate in half and while holding the fruit under the water, use your fingers to pry the seeds apart from the membranes and allow the seeds to fall back into the bowl.",
      "The pomegranate seeds will sink to the bottom of the bowl, and any of the pith will float to the top. You can then skim off any of the floating bits and pour the water and fruit through a strainer to drain.",
      "Once your pomegranate is seeded, process the seeds through a food processor or blender. Pulse several times so that the seeds are completely broken up. Place a mesh strainer over a bowl and pour the seed mixture into the strainer. Use a rubber spatula to push down on the seeds and extract as much juice as possible. You will need to do this in stages, a little at a time.",
      "Measure out 4 cups of fresh pomegranate juice. I left my juice in the fridge overnight and let the teeny tiny bits settle to the bottom. This step is completely optional, but I wanted my jelly to be as clear as possible. Once ready to make the jelly, I strained the juice further by running it through a cheese cloth. This last step caught any of the little bits that didn't get caught in the mesh strainer the first time around.",
      "For the pomegranate jelly:",
      "In a large canning pot, sterilize eight 8-ounce size canning jars in boiling water for 10 minutes. Sterilize the lids in a separate smaller pot. Remove jars from the boiling water and set aside.",
      "In a medium-sized pot, combine the pomegranate juice, lemon juice, and pectin. Bring to a boil over high heat, stirring constantly. Once you reach a full rolling boil, add the sugar and stir to combine. Bring the mixture back up to a boil and continue to boil, without stirring, for 2 full minutes. Remove from the heat and allow to sit for a minute or two before skimming off any foam.",
      "Carefully pour liquid jelly into the warm, sterilized canning jars. This amount of liquid should fill six to eight 8-ounce jars. Fill to within 1/2\" from the top of the jar. Wipe any jelly off the rim of the jars and attach lids and outer rings.",
      "To finish the canning procedure, place the completed jelly jars in a pot of boiling water. Use a canning rack if you have one. The water should cover the top of the jars by at least one inch. Boil for 7 to 10 minutes and then carefully remove the jars from the water. Let the jars cool on a wire rack. Check the seals to make sure that the jars are sealed tight. The lids should be sucked down and you'll hear a popping noise as the jelly cools. If any of the jars do not seal properly, store those jars in the refrigerator and use those first. Let jelly sit at room temperature overnight or put in the refrigerator for several hours to allow jelly to set.",

      "1. Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F. Grease a 9-inch springform pan with butter, dust it with flour, and line the bottom with parchment paper.",
      "2. Place the halved and pitted plums in a bowl. Pour the brandy over them and sprinkle them with 2 tablespoons of sugar.",

      "5. Pour the batter into the pan. Arrange the plums on top in rings, cut side down. Sprinkle with any remaining brandy/sugar syrup and the remaining 2 tablespoons sugar. (The syrup may leak a little from the pan. A piece of foil placed on the rack below the one holding the cake will catch the drips.)",
      "6. Bake the cake for 1 hour, or until it is golden and an inserted toothpick comes out clean. Let the cake cool for 10 minutes, remove the ring of the springform pan and transfer the cake to a plate. (It isn't essential to remove the cake from the bottom of the pan and peel off the parchment.

      "In another bowl, combine the buttermilk, oil, eggs, and vanilla. With the mixer on low speed, slowly add the wet ingredients into the dry. With mixer still on low, slowly and carefully add the coffee and stir just to combine, scraping the bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula. The batter will be very loose.",
      "This original recipe is for 2 round pans, and I found this amount to be just a bit too much for 24 cupcakes, so I remove about 1 cup of batter before dividing the remaining batter amongst the cupcake liners.",
      "Bake for about 18 to 20 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out clean. Let the cupcakes cool in the pans for 15 minutes, then move to a cooling rack to cool completely.",
      "For the salted caramel sauce:",
      "Place cream in a small bowl. Scrape in the seeds from the vanilla bean and then also add the bean. Set aside.",
      "Stir sugar, corn syrup, and water in a heavy saucepan over medium heat until sugar dissolves. Increase heat to medium-high and bring to a boil, occasionally swirling pan and brushing down sides with a wet pastry brush. It will thicken and turn deeper in color. After about 5 to 6 minutes, it should be deep amber in color. Don't let it get too dark. If it starts to smell burnt, immediately remove pan from heat. Gradually add the vanilla cream, while continuously whisking. The mixture will bubble vigorously. Whisk over medium heat until smooth and thick, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat and whisk in butter and salt. Pour the mixture through a strainer into a heatproof bowl. Place in refrigerator to cool completely before starting the buttercream.",
      "For the salted caramel buttercream:",
      "In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle, beat the butter until creamy. At low speed, beat in the powdered sugar. Increase the speed to high and beat until fluffy, scraping down the side of the bowl, about 2 minutes longer. At low speed, beat in the cream and vanilla. Then gradually beat in 1-1/4 cup of the cooled caramel sauce. Scrape down the side of the bowl and the paddle, increase the speed to medium-high and beat until light, 3 minutes longer. Using a wooden spoon, vigorously beat the buttercream for 30 seconds to deflate any air bubbles.",
      "To finish the cupcakes:",
      "Fill a pastry bag with a large star tip with the buttercream and pipe it onto cupcakes. Drizzle over the top of each one a bit of the remaining salted caramel sauce. (Any leftover salted caramel sauce is wonderful over vanilla ice cream!) Press a chocolate coated espresso bean into each swirl of frosting and then sprinkle lightly with sea salt.",
      "Serve immediately or store in a container in the refrigerator. Remove from refrigerator about 30 minutes prior to serving.",

Slowly add the chicken stock while whisking so that the flour pieces are broken down. Add the milk, dill and seasonings. Lower the heat to medium and cook for approximately 30 minutes until the soup thickens.",
      "To make the dumplings, bring a pot of water to a boil. While the water is heating, combine the flour, baking powder, salt and pepper in a large bowl. In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs, buttermilk, chives and cheese. Add the wet ingredients to the dry and stir just until combined.",
      "Using a tablespoon or 1 ounce sized scoop, drop the biscuits into the pot of boiling water, lower the heat to medium and cook for approximately 20 minutes until the dumplings are puffed up and firm. Note that many people like to cook their dumplings in the actual soup so that the dumplings pick up the soup flavor. I find, however, that it makes the soup cloudy and I prefer to cook them separately. An option, though, is to use chicken stock instead of water to cook the dumplings. When dumplings are done remove them from the water using a slotted spoon and put them into your serving bowls. Top them with the soup and enjoy.",
      "Makes approximately 16 dumplings.",

Then squeeze the lemon over the apples and pour in a half cup of REAL maple syrup. (I approximated how much syrup I ended up adding since I adjust it to taste as the apples cook down). Ideally the lemon should brighten the flavour, not make the topping tart, so adjust for that. We're looking for juicy, not drowning. Depending on the type of apple used it will take 10-15 minutes to cook them, stirring occasionally. The apples are done when they are tender with just a little firmness near the center of each slice."

This careful step will ensure that your crust won't be soggy.",

Serve warm or at room temperature.",

      "3. Cook, stirring constantly, until the butter becomes a light tan color. Remove the pan from the heat. The butter will continue cooking even after you remove it from the burner. The finale should be nut-brown and have a toasty aroma. Overcooked butter will have a very bitter taste.",
      "4. Substitute brown butter for melted butter. It will add a complex and nutty flavor to your food with this classic French technique."

When you want to roll pie crust, it's best if you put a sheet of baking paper between the dough and the rolling pin. So put one piece of the dough onto a lightly floured work surface. Put a sheet of baking paper over the dough and use your rolling pin to roll it out bigger than the size of your pie pan. Then gently pick up the dough and place it into your pan.",

Fill the fruits into the bottom pie crust.",

      "4-There are tiny bones in the legs and wings, make sure to get them all, also remove any skin. I discard any meat fragments that look too dark to me also. This is hard to describe because I go by look and feel. I just put meat back in the soup that I would like to eat.",
      "5-The result is a meaty homemade soup, with no bones.",
      "6-I season after the meat is taken off the bones because I use the skin and it was seasoned for roasting. This way I taste the broth before I add more seasoning."

      "- If you want to make baby cakes, you will have to double this recipe. If you want to make a simple bundt cake or layered cake then stick to the measurements of the recipe.",
      "- If you are making the baby cakes, you can use any size cut out that you want. I used a biscuit cutter that was 3 inches wide, which is rather large, but you can use whatever size you want. In fact, I recommend using a cut-out that is a little smaller because you will get more baby cakes out of the batter.",
      "- If you are going to make the baby cakes you will need to use a long baking sheet. The pan I used was 17.5 inches long by 11.5 inches wide and about 1 inch deep. If you are going to make a layered cake use 2 round 9 inch bake pans.",
      "- Don't throw away the scraps that are left after you cut out your mini cakes. You can use the scraps for parfaits or something else creative. I put them in a Mason jar and put some of the left over mousse on top.",
      "For the cakes:",
      "Preheat oven to 350 F.",
      "1. In a medium saucepan on low to medium heat, melt the stick of butter. Once the butter has melted, add the cup and a half of chocolate chips. Use a rubber spatula or wooden spoon to slowly stir the chocolate until it has completely melted and turns smooth. Take pan off the heat and set aside to cool slightly.",
      "2. It is best if you have a standing mixer for this next part but if you don't that is okay. In a bowl, add the eggs and sugar. Beat on high until the eggs begin to double in size and turn pale. This takes about 5 minutes. When the eggs have risen and turned pale, turn the mixer on a low speed. Add the coffee, vanilla, salt and sifted cocoa powder and blend until well incorporated. While mixing, slowly pour in the melted chocolate.",
      "3. Do not skip this part! It is important to line your bundt pan, 9-inch round pans or the large cookie sheet with parchment paper. So first, butter the pan, then line with parchment paper, and add more butter or baking spray on top of the paper. Pour your batter into your pans (if you are making a layered cake make sure you divide the cake batter evenly among the two pans. If you are using the cookie sheet for the baby cakes pour evenly on the sheet). Bang the pans on the counter top to release the excess air. Bake for about 25-30 minutes or until a toothpick is inserted and comes out clean. Once finished, remove the pan(s) from the oven and allow to cool completely. This could take several hours.",
      "While that is cooling make the ganache.",
      "I actually made the ganache before I made the cake. I like my ganache to be nice and cooled so it can be thick when I'm ready to use it.",
      "For the ganache:",
      "1. Place the 9 ounces of chocolate in a shallow bowl. Heat up the the cream in a pan on the stove. Once the cream has come to a slight boil immediately pour the cream over the chocolate and use a rubber spatula to stir until the chocolate is completely melted and smooth. Add the vanilla extract and stir. Set aside to allow to cool.",
      "While that is cooling make the mousse.",
      "For the mousse:",
      "1. In a medium bowl, add the cream, powdered sugar, cocoa powder and your raspberry liqueur and beat on high until stiff peaks form. This takes about 2-3 minutes. Place in a piping bag and back into the refrigerator until ready to use.",
      "While that is chilling make the raspberry sauce.",
      "For the raspberry sauce:",
      "1. In a medium saucepan, add the raspberries, water, sugar, and lemon juice and allow to simmer for 10 minutes. The raspberries will begin break down into a sauce. After 10 minutes, add the cornstarch and stir. The sauce will begin to thicken slightly. Continue to simmer for another 5 minutes and remove pan from heat. Allow that to cool as well. I know there are some recipes where you strain the seeds and if you prefer to do that then that is okay. I wanted to keep the seeds in mine as a personal preference.",
      "For the assembly of the Baby Cakes:",
      "Cut out your mini baby cakes, to create an even number (details for size and cutting are in the notes above). Take one cake, pipe chocolate mousse in the middle of the top, place another cake on top, pour some of the chocolate ganache on top of that. Then add a little of the raspberry sauce, and then more of the chocolate mousse. Now you have a baby cake! You can garnish with chocolate shards or chocolate curls and fresh raspberries. If you are making a bundt or layered cake, assemble similarly.",

      "If you are making homemade dough, prepare the pie dough. Then gather it into two equal sized discs and allow it to chill for two hours in the fridge wrapped in plastic wrap.",
      "After the dough has chilled, preheat the oven to 375\u00b0F.",
      "Place raspberries in a medium bowl and set aside. To easily peel the peaches, bring a small pot of water to a boil. Gently place the whole peaches in the boiling water for 30 seconds or so and then remove them from the water with a slotted spoon. Place the peaches into a dish of cold water or run under cold water until the peaches are no longer warm. Halve the peaches to remove the pit, then slice into 1/2\" pieces and add them into the bowl of raspberries. Add sugar, almond extract, and tapioca and mix well. The raspberries will begin to break down and release their juices almost immediately. Set the bowl aside.",
      "Line two large cookie sheets with parchment paper. Dust a clean surface with flour and roll out one disc of your pie dough until it is about 1/8\" thick. Be generous with the flour to prevent the dough from sticking to the counter. Using a large biscuit cutter or other circular cutter about 3\" in diameter, cut out an even number of circles, using as much of the dough as possible. Remove scraps from around circles and press them back together in a ball and return it to the fridge.",
      "For half of the circles, carefully spoon about 2 tablespoons of filling onto the center of each circle. Take the remaining circles and stretch them out slightly so they will completely cover the circles with the filling. Drape this stretched circle over the filling and press the edges down all the way around the circle. If your cutter has a sealing edge, press down firmly to ensure a seal is made. If not, press the tines of a fork around the edge of the circle to ensure the dough seals shut. Repeat until all pies have been sealed and place pies on the cookie sheet about 1/2\" apart. Use the tip of a knife to make a small slit in the top of each pie to allow for venting. Place the cookie sheet in the fridge while you build the rest of the pies.",
      "Roll out the second disc of dough and repeat the pie-building process. Continue to recombine your scraps and re-roll them to maximize the number of pies you can complete.",
      "Once all of the pies are ready and on the cookie sheets, combine the egg yolk and water in a small bowl and beat until mixture is slightly foamy. Brush over the top of each pie. Finally, sprinkle sanding sugar over all of the pies. The sugar won't melt during baking, so use as much or as little as you like.",
      "Bake pies at 375\u00b0F for 25-35 minutes or until crusts are golden brown. Pies without a strong seal may leak slightly. Remove pies to a cooling rack and allow to cool for at least 20 minutes before serving.",
      "Pies can be served warm or cool. Serve them by themselves, with vanilla ice cream, vanilla pudding, whipped cream, or whatever makes you happiest. Pies can be stored at room temperature for 3-4 days in an airtight container."

      "2. Bring a pot of water (or double boiler) to a simmer with only about an inch of water in the bottom. In the meantime chop your Hershey's Hugs (makes it easier to melt), put in a heat-safe bowl (one that fits right over the top of the pot) and put the bowl over the simmering water to allow chocolate to melt.",

Place the marshmallow pops back onto the tray, or poke the stisks into a block of styrofoam, to allow chocolate to set. Enjoy!",

Once the flour and chicken broth is completely dissolved you should have a thick soup base. Add the 2 cups of water and continue to stir. Allow the soup base to simmer for 30 minutes. Make sure you stir and continue to scrape the bottom of the pot to get all that chicken flavor integrated and so that the soup doesn't stick and burn.",
      "4. Now, add the corn, beans, and diced jalapeno. Allow to simmer for another 20 minutes. Add the seasonings and the cream. Add the chicken and any juices that were on the plate and allow to simmer for another 20-30 minutes. Serve with delicious cornbread and thank me in the morning."

This cake is a mature flavor best suited for adults, and even then the sweetened whipped cream is a MUST. Kids will love the look of the cake, but probably not the taste, so although I highly recommend this cake, I'd also recommend making sure it isn't the only dessert offered if there are lots of kiddies at your holiday table. Fair enough? Good. Whoever heard of too many desserts anyway, right? Psssht. Not me, that's for sure.",
      "Now, this cake makes for a beautiful presentation that is actually very simple to assemble. It is tasty and definitely different. The orange comes through nicely and adds depth to the flavor, as does the hint of cinnamon and allspice in the berries. The cake is yummy and moist, and the cranberry layer combines both sweet and tart. Visually, the ruby red jewel-like topping is a stunner. Again, the cranberries are still on the tart side, even smothered in sugar and butter, because they are whole berries and not a sweetened sauce. But between the sugar, orange and whipped cream, I think the tartness is at an acceptable level (although this might vary from person to person). If you hate cranberries, this might not be your dessert. But if you want a little sumpin' sumpin' different from the usual dessert offerings, then this is it!",

      "- I precook the beans to tenderize them prior to adding to the chili. This avoids beans with too much of a bite and allows them to absorb more of the chili flavors.",
      "- To mash garlic, first smash the clove with the side of a wide chef's knife to remove the skin and make the clove less apt to roll around the cutting board. Next sprinkle 1/8 teaspoon of Kosher salt on the garlic (coarse salt is a must), and press the garlic with the flat of the knife as you pull toward you. Keep doing this until the garlic forms a paste.",
      "- After the chili has been simmering for 11/4 hours, taste to check the acidity. If it is too high, stir in a little baking soda - 1/2 teaspoon at a time. The result will be slightly sweeter. Taste after each 1/2 teaspoon addition; too much baking soda will cause the tomatoes to taste flat.",
      "- I remove the seeds and membranes from the Serrano pepper to keep the chili somewhat tame. Before you add more peppers or spices to increase the heat, try leaving the seeds and membranes with the pepper.",
      "- If you prefer a thinner chili, halfway through the cooking time add some of the reserved soaking liquid from the red beans, one cup at a time, until the chili reaches the desired consistency. Note that it will become thicker again as it continues to cook for the next 11/4 hours."

When the eggs have just been incorporated, scrape the sides of the bowl again and mix on low for 30 seconds.",

      "3. Sprinkle dough and your rolling pin with additional cocoa powder and roll dough to 1/8\" thickness. Cut out cookies with a 2\" round cookie cutter, or other small shape. To make \"designs\" on the cookie, press a smaller cookie cutter firmly in the center of the dough circle, but do not cut all the way through. You should make a deep impression, not a clean cut. You can also form the dough into a log, chill, and slice, if you prefer. But I think the roll and cut method looks nicer. Work scraps back into a smooth ball, roll, and cut, until most of the dough has been used.",
      "4. Preheat the oven to 350 F. Place the cookies on an ungreased baking sheet lined with parchment paper, at least 1/2\" apart. (If you are having trouble moving the cookies, use a very thin spatula or bench scraper to transport them.) Bake for 12-15 minutes. Cookies should be fully cooked and crisp, but not burned. Let the cookies cool completely on a wire cooling rack before filling.",
      "For the the raspberry creme and to assemble:",

      "2. To fill the cookies, transfer the creme to a pastry bag fitted with a large round piping tip. (You can also use a large zip top bag, sealed tightly, with a small hole cut out of the corner.) Squeeze a generous dollop of creme on the bottom of one cookie. Top with a second cookie and press lightly. Repeat until all of the cookies are filled. If desired, dip the cookies in dark chocolate and let set on wax or parchment paper until the chocolate is firm and the cookie lifts easily.",

      "2) Next thing you're going to do is get either a wok or a skillet out, and get that bacon going! No spray on the pan and no oil either. Just heat it up and add the bacon. It'll take a few minutes to cook, but you can enjoy the sound of the sizzle as well as the smell as it works.",
      "2) Once it begins to look cooked to your liking (it will cook more, so don't overdo it!), add your lettuce and mix it up. Allow the lettuce to soak up that delicious bacon grease. Whatever you do, don't throw that grease away!! Be adventurous.",
      "3) After all of the grease has been soaked up, add the soy sauce. You can continue to add even more soy sauce while you're stir-frying. It all depends on your own soy-sauce liking. Stir, and then add your onion and green pepper. Mix again. Oh so good. But it gets even better. Add your carrots, and allow it to continue to cook over low heat.",
      "4) Your water SHOULD be boiling by now. When it finally gets to that point, add all of your noodles to the pot and stir it about. (Pro tip: Break up the ramen noodles before you add it to the pot! Unless you like leaning over your bowl while eating. Then it's okay.) Cook noodles for 3 minutes, and then turn off the heat. Add HALF of the seasoning packets - not all. It doesn't need more. (Unless you want it. Then go for that salty goodness.) Stir.",
      "5) This is where things get even more exciting. Turn off the heat to your stir fry. Get out a big bowl, pour the ramen soup in. Pour that WONDERFUL stir fry over the top of the soup. Serve and enjoy with your weapon of choice: fork, spoon, or chop sticks. Oishii!"
