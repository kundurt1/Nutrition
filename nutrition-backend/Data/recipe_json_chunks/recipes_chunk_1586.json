      "Note: Active prep time is roughly 20 minutes but you will want to plan ahead because this does require refrigeration to allow the fudge to completely cool.",
      "1. Lightly spray an 8x8\" baking pan or dish with cooking spray and then line with parchment paper. You will want your parchment to hang over the sides of the dish by a few inches, for easy lifting once fudge is cooled. Set aside.",
      "2. Into a medium to large saucepan, add your candy corn and peanut butter. Turn heat to low and cook, stirring frequently with a wooden spoon, until candy corn is almost all the way melted. This should take about 3-4 minutes. Make sure to break up any large chunks with your spoon. Please be very careful not to burn the bottom, as it will want to. Constantly stir and don't leave it unattended!",
      "3. Next, add your entire can of sweetened condensed milk and stir to combine. Cook for another 3 minutes, stirring frequently. At this time, your candy corn should mostly be melted. Do not let the mixture come to a boil. Rather it should gently heat over low until everything is melted and combined.",
      "4. Add your white chocolate chips and give it a good stir. Turn heat off and continue stirring until chips are melted and combined completely. Because white chocolate melts at a much lower temperature, the residual heat from the mixture should melt it just fine. If you find it isn't melting completely, go ahead and put it back over a low flame and heat until just melted.",
      "5. Quickly pour the mixture into your prepared baking dish and smooth it using a spatula so that there is a nice flat top. Tap the dish on the counter to settle everything and then allow it to cool at room temperature for 15-20 minutes. Next, place fudge into the refrigerator to cool completely.",
      "6. Once completely cooled and hardened, lift the fudge out of pan with the parchment handles, put it onto a cutting board and cut into 1x1\" squares. To do this I simply cut straight down with a long large knife. You can wipe the blade after each cut if you'd like. Line a sheet pan with wax or parchment and place the squares of fudge onto the parchment, spaced about 1/2\" apart. Place the pan into the fridge to set up once more while you melt your chocolate!",
      "7. Over a double boiler, gently heat and melt your semi-sweet chocolate chips. Once completely melted, remove fudge from the fridge and dip the bottom of each square into your melted chocolate. Shake off excess and then place the square back onto your parchment lined sheet pan. Repeat. When all of the pieces have been dipped, place fudge back into the fridge until chocolate has hardened.",
      "8. Once hardened, fudge can be gifted and given to your friends and family! Store at room temperature, in an airtight container for up to 5 days.",
      "Once completely set, I wrapped a couple of pieces in cellophane bags, tied the bags closed with fancy ribbon, and gave as gifts to friends! They are perfectly fine at room temperature without any fear of melting or sticking!",

Pour the vegetable oil, white vinegar, vanilla, and hot water into the well. Gently mix with a fork until combined. Do not use an electric mixer. Bake in an ungreased 9x13 baking dish at 350F for 30-35 minutes. Cake is done when a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Be careful not to over bake. Cool completely, or at least until the cake is barely warm.",
      "For the glaze: In a small bowl combine the sugar and cocoa, set aside. In a small saucepan, bring the milk to a simmer, then add the sugar and cocoa mixture. Bring to a boil and cook for 2 minutes at a full boil, stirring frequently. Remove from heat and let cool for a few minutes. After the glaze has cooled for a few minutes, whisk in the vanilla.",
      "Now use a fork to poke holes in the surface of the entire cake. Pour the glaze over the cake, and spread evenly with a spoon, making sure the entire cake is covered. Let cool until the glaze has hardened. It will become smooth and hard to the touch once cooled. This hardening process may take just a few minutes, or up to an hour; so make sure you keep an eye on the glaze while it is cooling in the pan. You don't want it to set up in the pan, and not be able to pour it over the cake. Serve and enjoy! This cake keeps very well for several days."

I use a pizza cutter but be careful with it so you keep your lines straight. Wrap in parchment paper or wax paper. You need patience for this, it takes a while! So turn on your favorite TV show and get to wrapping.",
      "Notes:",
      "1. Whenever you are using a candy thermometer, make sure you test it beforehand. An inaccurate thermometer will ruin everything! To test, clip a candy thermometer onto a pan full of cold water and bring it to a boil. Don't let the thermometer touch the bottom of the pan. Boiling water should read 212\u00b0F. If your water is boiling and the reading is different, make note of the difference and apply this when making your carmel. (To help, if the thermometer says the boiling water is 210\u00b0F and not 212\u00b0F that means you are at a 2\u00b0 difference. So when the thermometer reaches 242\u00b0F you will take your caramel off the heat then instead at the normal 244\u00b0F. If this is all too confusing, just buy a new thermometer, that's what I would do!)",
      "2. High-altitude: If you live over 7,000 feet, take the candy off at 227\u00b0F. Use the NMSU E215 Guide for reference and use the lowest temperature for a chewy candy."

Let it cool a bit before opening the tinfoil, and if it's not finished, just wrap it back up and throw it on for a couple more minutes. Be careful not to burn your fingers! The tin cools off fairly quickly, but the melted stuff inside stays hot. If the crackers get a little burnt ... it's absolutely delicious. It makes a wonderful, ooey gooey delicious mess. Enjoy!"

I never use un-toasted nuts because the flavor just is not the same. Most of the time when you toast them, since the flavor really comes out, you can even cut down the amount you need! You know the nuts are toasted when they start to become fragrant and you can really smell the pecan. You just have to be careful that they do not burn. I put them in the pan for about 3-5 minutes stirring them around often. You do not want to toast them completely because you still need to glaze them and they will continue to cook during that process.",
      "Once pecans are toasted, then you want to pour on the honey! Then you want to throw in your dash of cayenne. I probably used about 1/8 of a teaspoon but use whatever floats your boat! Stir them up and let them simmer and heat up in the honey until they are all coated in the honey mixture (approximately 3 to 4 minutes).",
      "Once the pecans have simmered in the honey for about 3 to 4 minutes and you feel they are well coated, remove them from the heat and spread them on a plate or a cookie sheet.

      "For the buttercream icing:",
      "Pour the granulated sugar into a medium sized, heavy bottom pot. Add the water to the sugar, but do not stir it. Heat the sugar mixture over medium high heat until boiling. Do not stir the sugar mixture at any point. Allow the sugar mixture to boil for several minutes. The sugar will begin to caramelize and turn a light amber color in the center. Caution: the sugar will turn quickly at this point, so watch it carefully so that it doesn't burn. Once you've reached your desired dark amber color, lift the pot off the heat and working quickly, gently swirl the pot for 10 or 15 seconds until the color is uniform throughout.",
      "With the pot off the heat, slowly add the cream while stirring continuously. The sugar will clump and become tough to stir, but continue mixing until the sugar remelts and the caramel is smooth. If necessary, place the pot back onto the warm element (without turning the heat back on) to raise the temperature enough to finish melting the sugar that may have clumped. Then set it aside and let the caramel cool until it is no longer warm but is still pourable. You may put the caramel into the fridge for 20 to 30 minutes to speed up the cooling process, but give it a stir every 5 minutes.",
      "In the bowl of your stand mixer, cream the butter and shortening until smooth. Add the salt and the vanilla. Mix well. Add half of the icing sugar and mix well. Add the remaining icing sugar and beat the icing for several minutes until it is fully incorporated.",
      "With the mixer running on low, gently pour the cooled caramel into the bowl in a steady stream down the side of the bowl. Increase the speed and continue to beat the icing until it is light and fluffy.",
      "If your caramel was too warm when added to the icing, your icing will become runny. Simply refrigerate the icing for 15 minutes, then beat the icing again.",
      "For the salted caramel candy shards:",
      "Line a large rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper and set it aside.",
      "Pour the granulated sugar into a medium sized, heavy bottom pot. Add the water to the sugar, but do not stir it. Heat the sugar mixture over medium high heat until boiling. Do not stir the sugar mixture at any point. Allow the sugar mixture to boil for several minutes. The sugar will begin to caramelize and turn a light amber color in the center.

Once you've reached your desired dark amber color, lift the pot off the heat and working quickly, gently swirl the pot for 10 or 15 seconds until the color is uniform throughout.",
      "Quickly pour the caramel onto the parchment paper and working quickly and carefully, lift the edges of the parchment paper causing the caramel to spread over the parchment paper in an even layer, or as even as possible. The caramel will harden quickly, so you must work quickly. Sprinkle the candy generously with salt before it hardens. Once the candy has hardened, break it into pieces.",
      "This recipe makes enough to generously ice 24 cupcakes or a 3 layer cake. You can easily half this recipe, or simply freeze any remaining icing to use later."

      "Meanwhile, whisk together the flour, 2 tablespoons of the sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a medium bowl. Add the butter, and incorporate it into the flour by pinching it throughout the dough. You could also use two knives or a pastry cutter. The butter should be evenly distributed throughout the dough in small chunks about the size of pearl couscous.",
      "Next, combine the egg white and milk in a small bowl. Add this into the dry ingredients and stir until combined.",
      "Flour the counter, and place the dough ball on it. Knead the dough for 3-5 minutes, or until the dough is no longer sticky and feels soft and supple. Flour the counter, your hands, and the rolling pin as necessary.",
      "Cover the dough with plastic wrap and let it rest for 15 minutes.",
      "Next, roll the dough out into an 8\" square. Using a pizza cutter or knife, cut the dough in half, then in thirds to make six donut bar shapes. (See photo in the related blog). Place the donut bars on a Silpat- or parchment paper-lined cookie sheet, and cover with a sheet of buttered plastic wrap. Let dough rise in a warm place for 45 minutes.",
      "Preheat the oven to 400\u00b0F. Sprinkle the donuts with the cinnamon and remaining 1 tablespoon of sugar. Bake the donuts for 10-12 minutes, or until lightly browned on all edges. Remove from oven.",
      "Let the donuts cool slightly, then make the glaze. In a small bowl whisk together the powdered sugar and milk. Decorate the donuts while still slightly warm with the glaze and sprinkles. Serve immediately.",
      "The donuts taste best right out of the oven, but can be kept for 1 day in an airtight container. It's best to warm them very briefly in the microwave before serving.",
      "For these donuts, I converted a baked beignet recipe by Jenna at eatliverun.com into donut bars."

    "directions": [
      "For the jam:",
      "In a medium-size saucepan combine all of the jam ingredients over medium-high heat. Bring the mixture to a boil and boil for 1 minute. Turn the heat down to medium-low and mash the berries with a potato masher. Simmer the jam for about 30 minutes until it has thickened and reduced slightly. Remove from heat.",
      "Cool to room temperature before putting it in a jar. Store the jam in the refrigerator. It will continue to thicken as it cools.",
      "For the beignets:",
      "In a small bowl combine the warm water and yeast with the pinch of sugar and let the mixture sit for 5 minutes until it becomes thick and bubbles form.",
      "In a separate bowl combine the flours, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and sugar. Add the cubed cold butter to the flour mixture and work it into the flour mixture with your fingers until the flour resembles coarse sand.",
      "In another small bowl whisk together the buttermilk, Greek yogurt, egg, and vanilla bean paste. Add the yeast mixture into the buttermilk mixture and stir to combine.",
      "Pour the wet ingredients into the dry and mix together until combined. If the dough is very wet add a little more flour.",
      "Dump the dough out onto a floured surface and knead it for about 8 minutes until the dough feels smooth. Place the dough back into a bowl sprayed with cooking spray and cover the bowl with plastic wrap. Let the dough rest for 15-20 minutes.",
      "Remove the dough from the bowl and roll it out into a rectangle or square shape that's roughly 1/2 inch thick. Use a pizza cutter or knife to cut the dough into 8-10 squares or rectangles.",
      "Place the cut out dough onto a baking sheet that you've lined with parchment paper or a Silpat and cover with plastic wrap. Let the dough rise again for about 45 minutes.",
      "Preheat the oven to 400 F.",
      "Uncover the dough and place the pan on the middle rack of the oven to bake for 7-9 minutes or until light golden brown. Remove from the oven and place the beignets on a wire cooling rack. Dust the tops of the beignets with powdered sugar.",
      "Serve immediately with the blackberry bourbon vanilla jam for dipping.",
      "Notes:",
      "- Whole wheat flour is optional, so if you don't have it use all regular flour.",
      "- You can also use a stand mixer to help knead the dough, but you will probably still need to knead it for a couple minutes by hand.",
      "- If you don't have bourbon for the jam or don't want to use it, you can omit it and the jam will still taste wonderful.",

      "Set aside 1 cup of water with 3-4 ice cubes in it. Whisk together flour, sugar and salt in a large bowl (large and wide if you have one). Add in cold butter cubes and work them in with a pastry cutter. Stop when the butter pieces are the size of little peas.",
      "Drizzle about half of the water into the mixture (discarding any leftover ice). Use a rubber spatula to combine (add more water if needed). Once it starts to clump together, use your hands to form a solid ball out of the pieces. Divide the dough into 2 pieces and wrap each one separately in plastic wrap (flatten them out a bit so they resemble disks). Make sure that you don't work the dough too much-this will make sure the butter doesn't get warm. Refrigerate the dough packs for 1-2 hours (2 is better).",
      "For the filling:",
      "Combine blueberries, lemon zest, juice, cornstarch, sugar and vanilla into a large bowl and mix well. Let the fruit mixture sit while you preheat the oven and roll out the dough (at least 5-10 minutes).",
      "For the assembly:",
      "Set out 8 (wide and flat) mason jars onto a rimmed cookie sheet, lined with parchment paper. Keep the lids off to the side. I used 8 of the 16 ounce size jars and filled them about 2/3 of the way full, so the lids were easy to get on. Or you could use 10 to 12 of the 8 ounce jars, filled to the top.",
      "Preheat oven to 400 F. Once the dough has been chilled, remove one of the dough packs from the fridge onto a clean, generously floured work surface. Roll the dough out until about 1/8\" thick.",
      "Using a mason jar lid, cut 8 circles from the dough and line the bottom of each jar with a dough circle.",
      "Use the remainder of the first dough pack and into the second, to build the dough up onto the sides of the jars. You can just pull pieces off and press them tightly against the sides of the jars or I found it really useful to cut the pieces into squares first. Keep the sides thin, to make sure you have enough dough left for the tops. Once all the jars are lined with dough, divide the fruit mixture evenly among the jars.",
      "Use the remainder of the dough for the tops, however you like (I used mini star cookie cutters and laid the stars over the filling). Top each pie with a little sprinkle of coarse sugar (or regular granulated works too).",
      "Bake the pies (on the cookie sheet) for 40-45 minutes (or until the filling is bubbly and the crust starts to turn golden). Remove pan with the jars on it to a rack. Allow to cool for at least 10-20 minutes before handling (jars will be extremely hot, use caution when moving them). If keeping the pies for later, wait until they are room temperature to put the lids on and store in the refrigerator until ready.",
      "To re-heat refrigerated pies:",
      "-Remove jars from the fridge and leave them out at room temperature for about 30 minutes.",
      "-Preheat oven to 350 F.",
      "-Place jar(s) on baking sheet lined with parchment and bake them for 20-25 minutes, or until hot and bubbly (again, allowing them to cool for 10-20 minutes or until cool enough to handle before serving).",
      "Notes:",
      "- I used 8 of the 16 ounce size jars and filled them about 2/3 of the way full, so the lids were easy to get on. Or you could use 10 to 12 of the 8 ounce jars, filled to the top.",
      "- If you can, I highly recommend buying the blueberries in bulk (at a farmer's market or a Costco/Sam's Club). It's very cost-effective.",
      "- Alternatively, you can store the pies before you bake them: Seal each jar with its lid once they are assembled and store in the refrigerator for a few days (or in the freezer for up to a few weeks). Follow reheating instructions above."

Grab the dough in one hand, and smear some butter up the sides and across the bottom of the bowl. Place the dough back in the bowl, cover with a towel and let it rise in a warm place for 45 minutes-1 hour, or until doubled. If your kitchen is cool, turn on the oven to 200 F for 5 minutes, turn it off, and place the bowl inside to rise.",

In a small bowl, combine the brown sugar and 1 teaspoon of the cinnamon. Sprinkle the brown sugar and cinnamon on top of the melted butter. Let it sit for a minute or so, until the butter absorbs the brown sugar and cinnamon. This will help the filling from falling out when rolling.",
      "Gently, roll up the square, starting on the side of the dough closest to you. Roll it tightly into a log, and pinch the edge together when you get to the end. Slice the roll in half, then place both halves in a greased loaf pan, cut side up. Let the rolls rise in the loaf pan in a warm place for 30 minutes.",

      "Note: Most russet potatoes weigh more than 5 ounces, so either grab a tiny organic one, or pull out 5 ounces worth of raw potatoes while making mashed potatoes the night before."

It sort of makes me laugh to think of the idiom, \"I'm going to whip something up real quick\" because this, my friends, does not whip up quickly. You may get to a point where you are questioning whether or not you've done things right. Just keep going. It took me about 10-15 minutes of whipping this mixture until it was a proper meringue.

Cut with your favorite cookie cutter but leave the cookie in place and simply peel the dough scraps away from the sides. You can keep the cookies pretty close together because this dough will not spread. Repeat and roll out the scraps on another sheet of parchment paper to make additional cookies.",

Then transfer them to a wire rack to finish cooling. I used a 2 1/2\" round cutter and got 18 cookies."

      "2. Switch to a rubber spatula and gently fold in the hazelnuts and coconut. My mom adores coconut, and it ended up adding fantastic texture along with the hazelnuts. Take a 12 well standard size muffin pan and liberally spray it with cooking spray. Using a heaping 1/4 cup to measure, distribute the batter evenly among the 12 wells of the prepared muffin pan.",
      "3. Bake the rose cardamom muffins for about 15 minutes, until the edges are golden and a toothpick inserted in the middle comes out clean. Remove pan from oven and set it on a rack. Let them cool in the muffin pan for a few minutes, then remove them to a rack to finish cooling.",
      "4. When the rose cardamom muffins are cool enough to handle you are ready to serve! Eating them warm out of the oven is ideal, but they also keep very well for a couple of days in an airtight container. The flavors really spoke to my Lebanese heritage. These will wow at your next brunch!"

Whisk the wet and dry ingredients together, and pour through a fine mesh strainer to break up any lumps. Whisk one more time.",

Remove from heat and let the mixture sit, whisking occasionally, until it reaches a thick, gloppy consistency (which Deb likened to mayonnaise, which was right on). This took me about 30 minutes.",

Add the rest of the sugar, in 1/2 cup increments, and mix until fully incorporated. (If you don't want the buttercream too sweet, you might try it at 4 1/2 cups and stop there if you like it.)",

      "1. Cut the cooled cake layers evenly in half (horizontally), so there are four thin layers. Be careful! They'll be very delicate. If the tops have puffed up in the middle, use a bread knife to level them. Put them in the freezer to firm up, about 30 minutes to an hour.",

Using a spatula, spread about 1/2 cup of the raspberry filling in an even layer over the cake. Make sure it gets all the way to the edge. Spread about 1/2 cup (or one third) of the chocolate frosting over the raspberry filling. Place cake in the refrigerator to firm up, if needed. (Note: If the raspberry filling is on the runny side, put the chocolate frosting layer down first. My filling was very thick, so it worked best for me to use it first.)",
      "3. Repeat Step 2 for the next two layers, making sure to work slowly and let it set in the refrigerator if it is slipping and sliding at all. Chilly cake is your friend! Then place the final layer of cake on top.",
      "4. If there is unevenness in the shape of the cake, now is the time to even it out. Cut off any bits that stick out...and eat them! Gotta test for poison, right?",
      "5. Spread a very thin layer of the raspberry buttercream around the cake for a crumb layer. This will glue the dark crumbs to the cake, so they don't show through the light colored buttercream. Chill the cake in the refrigerator for 15 minutes until firm. Apply a regular, thick layer of the chocolate buttercream, then chill again for another 15 minutes.",
      "6. Pour the glaze over the top of the cake and using a spatula, push the glaze just to the edge of the cake, so it spills down the sides. Refrigerate the cake for at least 30 minutes to set completely.",
      "7. Decorate the top of the cake with leftover raspberry buttercream and/or fresh raspberries."

If not, go with your standard casserole dish. Use some cooking spray and lightly spray each ramekin, eight in my case, or your casserole dish.",

Have your milk ready and pour that in, continuing to whisk. You are making a cheese sauce, yes you are! Continue to whisk. Add in the blue cheese, and continue whisking. And yes, you are getting a nice little workout at the same time. After about 6-8 minutes you will notice the sauce come together. The cheese will have melted and incorporated into the sauce, and it will begin to thicken. This is exactly what you want. Turn off the heat, and move the sauce pan to another location on your stove.",
      "Now is the time to make the casserole. Take your potato slices and layer them into your ramekins, or your dish, leaving enough room near the top for bacon, onion, and breadcrumbs, about an inch. Midway through your layering, add a bit of the chopped bacon and red onion, and top with remaining potatoes. Add a bit more bacon and onion. Repeat this process for each ramekin. Pour the sauce over the top, tapping, or lightly shaking the dish to make sure the sauce gets into all areas. Cover with aluminum foil.",
      "Place on a baking sheet, and put it in the oven for 45 minutes. At the 45 minute mark, carefully remove the sheet from the oven, and take off the foil. Place a layer of breadcrumbs on the top, place back in the oven, and cook until the breadcrumbs are nice and toasty, about 12-15 minutes.",
