      "Unfortunately, the ideal veal breast for this recipe is not an item much in demand.",
      "It may take dedicated searching to find a butcher in your area who can fabricate the perfect piece: a 5-pound bone-in breast cut, from the tip.",
      "Thats the very end of the breast, farthest from the front leg, and it has two advantages: lots of cartilage, which adds flavor and richness, and a naturally closed pocket at the tip, which makes stuffing easy.",
      "On the day we tested this recipe and took these photos, I couldnt get a breast tip anywhere.",
      "The piece shown here (which came from a Manhattan supermarket) is only 3 1/2 pounds and cut from the middle, not the closed end of the breast.",
      "As you can see, the pocket that I cut for the stuffing is open on both ends.",
      "I wondered, though, how would I keep the stuffing in?",

      "No stuffing was lost, and we enjoyed our roast and delicious sauce for lunch and supper too.",

      "In the first step, you set both the heat and the pan of bread high up, so the top heat will quickly caramelize the bread without drying it out.",

      "Stay flexible, though: you might want to move the pudding higher if the top is not browning as you want itor you might need to cover it if its darkening too fast even at a lower temperature setting.",
