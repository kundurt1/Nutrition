      "While the bacon cooks, season the chicken pieces well with salt and pepper.",
      "Remove the bacon from the pan, leaving the fat behind, and set aside to drain on paper towels. Put the chicken in, top side down, reduce the heat to medium and leave to cook for about 4 minutes.",
      "Meanwhile, trim and finely slice the green onions (both the green and the white bits) and mushrooms and peel and finely chop the garlic. Run your fingers down the length of the rosemary stalks to release their leaves and finely chop them too. Set everything aside.",
      "The chicken pieces should now be golden brown underneath, so flip them over and leave to cook on the other side for about 3 minutes.",
      "Once the chicken is golden brown, turn down the heat to low and add the prepared mushrooms, garlic and rosemary, along with the tomatoes, Madeira (or red or white wine or stock), harissa paste or tomato puree and oregano, and crumble in the bay leaf.",
      "Give it a good stir and then leave to bubble away for 15-20 minutes, stirring from time to time so that it does not stick to the bottom.",
      "When the chicken dish is about halfway through cooking, add the reserved cooked bacon and green onions, then put the kettle on. Use the boiled water to cook the pasta in a large saucepan according to the package's instructions. Once it is cooked, drain the pasta and then return it to the pan with the lid on to keep warm if necessary.",
      "Check to see if the chicken is cooked-if the juices run clear, it is ready. Taste the sauce, adding a little sugar and/or a pat of butter if the sauce is still a bit acidic from the tomatoes. Add a drizzle of water if the sauce is too thick and let it bubble away for a bit longer if too thin.",
      "Divide the pasta among four plates, top with a piece of chicken breast or two thighs, spoon some sauce over and scatter with some ripped-up basil or parsley leaves, if using."

      "Preparation",
      "Preheat the oven to 300-degrees. Season the pork generously with salt and pepper and sprinkle with the caraway seeds. Melt the bacon fat over medium-high heat in a roasting pan placed over 2 burners. Add the pork and the chine bone and brown on all sides, about 10 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat. Place the onion in the pan and arrange the pork roast, bony side up, on top of the onions. Leave the chine bone in the pan and put the pan in the oven.",
      "",
      "After 1 1/2 hours, remove the pan from the oven. The onion should be browned and caramelized. Turn the roast over to the other side and add the garlic, tomato paste, and chicken stock. (Don't worry about stirring globs of tomato paste into the stock since you'll be whisking the gravy later.) Return the pan to the oven for another hour.",
      "",
      "After 2 1/2 hours of roasting, an instant-read thermometer inserted into the meat should read about 165 degrees. If the temperature is lower, continue to roast the pork until the thermometer reads 165 degrees, then remove the pan from the oven. Transfer the pork to a platter and set it in a warm spot, loosely covered with foil.",
      "",
      "Place the roasting pan on 2 burners over medium-high heat and bring the liquid to a simmer. Gradually sprinkle in the flour, whisking constantly. Continue whisking for about 5 minutes, until the flour taste is cooked out, any lumps of tomato paste are smooth, and the gravy is barely thick enough to coat a spoon. Also whisk in any juices from the platter that have collected around the roast. You can strain the gravy if you prefer.",
      "",
      "Transfer the pork to a cutting board and cut it into portions between the bones. Pile the pork on a platter and pour about a quarter of the gravy over the meat. Pour the rest of the gravy into a sauce boat and serve the pork accompanied by gravy and dumplings."

Place chicken pieces, skin-side down, in oil, cover, and fry until deep golden brown, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove lid after 4 minutes and lift chicken pieces to check for even browning; rearrange if some pieces are browning faster than others. (At this point, oil should be about 300 degrees. Adjust burner, if necessary, to regulate temperature of oil.) Turn chicken pieces over and continue to fry, uncovered, until chicken pieces are deep golden brown on second side, 6 to 8 minutes longer. (At this point, to keep chicken from browning too quickly, adjust burner to maintain oil temperature of about 315 degrees.) Using tongs, transfer chicken to plate lined with paper towels; let stand for 5 minutes to drain. Serve"

      "In a mixing bowl combine all the ingredients except for the cinnamon sprinkle. Take the meat and place it into a baking dish or other container large enough to accomodate the steak. Pour the marinade over the steak making sure the meat is well coated with the sauce. Sprinkle the exposed side of the meat liberally with the cinnamon/sugar until it is entirely coated. Let stand for 20 minutes and then turn the steak over and cover the other side of the meat with the cinnamon sprinkle. Let stand. Cover the dish with aluminum foil in between the turnings. Turn the steak over at least 4 times each time reapplying the sprinkle on the exposed side of the steak while allowing the meat to marinade for a minimum of 2 hours. You can marinate over night but it isn't necessary. You can use the baking dish to cook the steak as long as the dish is big enough so the liquid comes about half way up the side of the meat. Put the uncovered dish on the grill to cook and close the lid of the grill. I sometimes make a cooking surface from tin foil by crimping several layers of foil together and turning up the ends and sides to keep the liquid around the steak. I then place it on the grill. Make sure you use several layers so it is thick enough and won't puncture and leak liquid. Cook in the liquid until desired doneness. I strongly suggest rare to medium rare for best flavor. When the steak is done remove from pan and let it rest 10 minutes or so. Slice very thin against the grain. Use the remaining sauce as a table sauce. I hope this turns out well for you because I never measured the ingredients before, I would just use sight and taste as my guide. But if done properly this is a terrific recipe."

Cook to the point where the pancake developes browned circles where the bubbles formed. Loosen the edges and flip carefully. Place sliced strawberries on one half of the pancake, leaves at least the dimension of the strawberry between each slice. Sprinlkle the whole pancake with sugar lightly. When the pancake has the browned bubbles, looking like spongebob, flip the half of the pancake w/o strawberries onto the the side with, and then fold that in half. Serve hot as they come off.",

Use the peel or cutting board to slide the loaf onto the baking stone or slide the baking sheet into the oven.

If the bread is browning too quickly, lower the temperature to 400\u00b0F. Remove and cool on a wire rack.",

Chop 1 pound pancetta (or bacon) and cook until it's crisp. Drain the meat and set it aside, reserving 1/3 cup of the rendered fat. If you don't have enough, add olive oil or good-quality lard to make up the balance. Proceed with the recipe, using the reserved fat in place of the oil.

      "In a large bowl, mix all of the ingredients, except the flour, until they are thoroughly combined. Add the flour, 1 cup at a time, until a soft dough is formed, and it is no longer clinging to the side of the bowl. (This usually takes about 4 1/2 cups of flour, but will be altered according to weather, humidity, etc.) At this point the dough can be worked into a 1-inch disc, wrapped in plastic, and refrigerated for an hour or so, or it can be directly rolled out. Divide the dough in half, reserving the unused half in the refrigerator. On a well-floured work surface, with the top of the dough floured as well, roll out the dough to 1/4 inch thickness. With a floured doughnut cutter, cut out doughnuts and holes. The dough does not re-roll well, so scraps can be sliced into fritters. Roll and cut the second portion of dough. The doughnuts can be held on a lightly floured baking sheet until frying. Prepare the oil for frying. In a Dutch oven, heat oil, at least 2-3 inches deep, to 360\u00b0F. Fry the doughnuts, no more than 4 at a time, until they are golden brown, 1 1/2 to 2 minutes. With a spider, or wooden spoon, flip the doughnuts over, and complete the frying. When the doughnuts are crispy, and golden brown, drain them on a cooling rack set over thick paper. It is important that you let the oil return to 360\u00b0 before frying again. Having hot enough oil helps the doughnuts absorb a minimal amount of fat. When the doughnuts have cooled some, roll in powdered sugar, the traditional finishing, or dip in chocolate glaze"
