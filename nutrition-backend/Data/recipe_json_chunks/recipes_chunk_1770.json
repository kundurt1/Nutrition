      "While the oven is preheating, put the baking tray with the rolls on top of the oven (put the tray on top of some newspaper and/or a cooling rack, and cover it with the misted bowl, to prevent it from coming into direct contact with the hot oven, and to prevent it from drying out) and let it rise for another 5 minutes.",
      "While the first tray of rolls is undergoing its 2nd rise in the oven, form the second batch of rolls.",

      "When it's cold, start the rise at room temperature, then move it to the top of the oven when the 2nd batch is in the oven.",
      "This way you can proof and bake all 3 batches efficiently and with good results, without having to wait for any batch to complete its 2nd rise.",
      "I usually make this by replacing 20 to 40 g of the milk with plain, undrained yogurt, and using 60g of very strong bread flour (included in the total amount of bread flour).",

      "Be very careful not to overheat it.",

      "A glass bowl retains heat well and keeps the chocolate tempered longer.",
      "Another way to temper chocolate is called seeding.",
      "In this method, add small pieces of unmelted chocolate to melted chocolate.",
      "The amount of unmelted chocolate to be added depends on the temperature of the melted chocolate, but is usually 1/4 of the total amount.",
      "It is easiest to use an immersion blender for this, or a whisk.",
      "The classic way to temper chocolate is called tabliering.",
      "Two thirds of the melted chocolate is poured onto a marble or another cold work surface.",
      "The chocolate is spread out and worked with a spatula until its temperature is approximately 81 degrees F. At this stage, it is thick and begins to set.",
      "This tempered chocolate is then added to the remaining non-tempered chocolate and mixed thoroughly until the mass has a completely uniform temperature.",
      "If the temperature is still too high, part of the chocolate is worked further on the cold surface until the correct temperature is reached.",
      "This is a lot of work, requires a lot of room, and makes a big mess.",
      "A simple method of checking tempering, is to apply a small quantity of chocolate to a piece of paper or to the point of a knife.",
