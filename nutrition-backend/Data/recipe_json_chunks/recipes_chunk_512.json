      "Cut potatoes in half prior to baking for one hour or until done. (Note: This recipe uses baking sized potatoes so adjust as needed if not using potatoes this large.) Once potatoes are baked, allow to cool and when they are cool enough to handle, scoop the potato out of the skin leaving the skin as a shell to be used later. In a large mixing bowl, add potato pulp and all ingredients listed above. (Adjust spices to your own taste.) Mix all ingredients using either a blender or with a fork depending on how fine you want the potatoes mashed. Once the ingredients have been mixed together, place them back in to the potato skins. Heat oven to 350 and bake potatoes an additional 10 to 15 minutes until the tops are browned."
