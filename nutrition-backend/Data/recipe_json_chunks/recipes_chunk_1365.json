If it is, lower the oven temperature by 10 or 15 degrees and/or set the lid slightly ajar.",

Tightly cover the pot and return to the oven, about 6 to 8 minutes, or until the eggs just begin to set. Then uncover the pot and cook until the edges of the egg begin to brown, about 10 minutes more (though time may vary). Spoon off any fat that may rise to the top. (The eggs may sink a bit at first, and you might think you've ruined your dish, but carry on -- the eggs will set up and form a slightly golden crust over the pork. Just monitor closely and have faith!) Remove from oven. Scatter fresh tarragon over the top and add lemon juice to taste before serving (or serve with lemon wedges on the side).",
      "If preparing this dish in advance, complete steps 1 -through 8, placing the meat in a tall container and pouring the braising liquid on top. Refrigerate. The following day, lift off the congealed fat and discard. Let the meat come to room temperature. About 1/2 hour before serving, place the meat in an ovenproof dish in a 325 degree F oven with the braising liquid. The pork will take about 30 minutes to reheat. Then, proceed with steps 9 through 13."

      "If your goat is very bony (i.e. you're not using steaks) you'll want to blanch it for 5 minutes first. Drain the blanching liquid and then put the meat/bones in the pressure cooker, cover with a couple inches of water and let it get up to full pressure. Turn the heat down and let it cook on low pressure for 15-20 minutes. Release the pressure however you like, then drain and save the liquid. When the meat cools, you can fairly easily pull all the meat off of the bones. Before you return the meat and reserved liquid to the pot, pour in a little olive oil and saute the garlic and ginger in it. Add the turmeric and let cook for about 20 seconds, then deglaze with balsamic vinegar. Add the goat and reserved cooking liquid. At this point the goat is only covered by an inch or two of water so you'll want to add more water, up to about the middle point in an 8 qt. pot.",

      "Add in the rest of the spices. (Toasting them first will add more depth, but it will still be fine if you don't.) If you're using whole spices (which you should be) you'll definitely want a coffee grinder, or at least something other than a mortar and pestle, to grind them; most of them are no problem, but annatto seeds are hard. Really hard. I gave up after about 5 seconds in the mortar. Just wasn't worth it.",
      "Bring just to a boil, then turn it down to a simmer and let it go for about 45 minutes. When you're nearing the end of that time, start your chickpea flour roux, mixing equal parts besan and olive oil and cooking over medium heat until the raw taste has been cooked out. Be aware that besan needs a bit more time to cook than regular flour, since it's very, very raw tasting. You'll definitely want to let it cool enough to taste it before adding it to the stew, just to be sure. When it's ready, mix it in and let simmer for 20 minutes.",
      "Goat meat can be tough, so you'll want to test a piece for doneness before adding the veggies since you don't want them to overcook. When you think it's close to being done, saute your carrots/peppers/onions, deglaze with more balsamic, and then add them to the pot along with the chickpeas. Add a shot of pomegranate molasses, if using. When the goat is nice and tender, and the veggies too, you're good to go.",
      "Goes well by itself, but is good with flatbread, or especially over rice. Fresh fenugreek leaves make a great garnish, if you can find them. They don't have an especially strong flavor, but they smell like snap peas, or fresh garbanzo beans. (A friend thought they smelled like walnuts, but I didn't really pick up on that.) Lacking that, mint is nice, and cilantro is especially good.",

You may need to stir the yeast after a few minutes to allow it all to dissolve. Once dissolved, stir in the rest of the sugar, 1 cup of the flour, the eggs, salt, and cinnamon. Once incorporated, add in an additional 1-3/4 cups of flour, stirring on low to combine. Using the paddle attachment, increase the speed to medium (I use 4 on my mixer) and begin adding the butter a piece at a tim, stirring to barely incorporate after each addition. Continue to beat, scraping the sides of the bowl twice throughout the process, for 4 minutes or until the dough is moistened and stretchy, forming strands of stringy dough between the beater and the bowl. Toss the blueberries with the remaining 3 tablespoons of flour and stir or knead the blueberries into the dough on low speed until they're combined and barely starting to burst. If you feel like the of the blueberries are squishing before they are incorporated, you can try to fold them in with your hands. Don't worry- they'll integrate well after the first rise. Lightly grease a large bowl and place the dough inside. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and allow it to rise in a warm spot of your kitchen until doubled in size, about 1-1/2- 2 hours. I like to let mine rise on the counter next to a warm stove or oven.",

Pat one piece of dough out into a rectangle roughly 8\" wide on it's shortest side and fold it lengthwise like you fold a letter, folding the bottom third up and the top third over top of it. Rotate the dough 90 degrees and pat it out into a rectangle again, repeating the folding process. Lightly grease two loaf pans (8 1/2\" x 4 1/2\" x 2 3/4) and gently work the dough into each pan with the seam facedown and cover the pans with plastic wrap. Allow them to rise a second time, about 1-1/2 hours until the bread has risen just barely over the lip of the pan, about 1/2-1\". The bread will continue to rise in the oven, so don't worry if it's not a lofty loaf yet. Keep in mind if you use a larger or smaller loaf pan, your rise will be slightly different.",
      "While the bread is rising, preheat the oven to 350 degrees and make the crumb topping. Stir together the flour, sugar, and cinnamon until combined. Then, use a fork to cut the butter and vanilla into the mixture until it is a coarse meal consistency. When the loaves have risen, gently brush them with a thin layer of cream and sprinkle the crumbs on top. You may have some crumbs leftover. Bake in the preheated oven for about 35-40 minutes, or until the loaves have tanned and are 190 degrees in the inside. Allow to cool for 20 minutes in the pan and then continue cooling on a cooling rack."

Remember to occasionally stir as you proceed with the recipe.",

Once sugar is dissolved and mixture is boiling you will need to keep a pretty close eye on the pan. If you are using a candy thermometer you will notice the mixture hovers near the boiling point for a while then starts to climb fairly rapidly. As the mixture approaches 310\u00b0 F, you will want to start swirling it fairly frequently as caramelization is imminent. Once caramel color is to your liking remove pan from heat. The pan will retain some heat so I like to remove the caramelized sugar mixture from the heat at about 325\u00b0 F, or when it is a golden brown color.",

Stir often, scraping the bottom of the pan. As you get close to your target temperature you may want to turn the heat down to low if you are using a gas stove, or off if you are using electric to slow things down. Your caramels can go from too soft to tooth breaking within a short time frame. You will also want to stir close to continuously as you get close to your target temp to prevent burning.",

Use parchment paper to remove from the pan, then cut caramel into 1-inch squares, or whatever size pieces you prefer. Wrap individually with waxed paper, and store in an airtight container.",
      "Note: Caramel making is a bit trial-and-error based on humidity and other factors. If your caramels come out too soft, modify the final temperature up 1-4 degrees. If they come out too hard, modify down. This recipe scales down by half to an 8-inch square pan if you want to make a smaller amount or feel like experimenting!"

You'll notice a difference in how much batter you get from this as soon as the mix really starts to blend out. From here you just pour it evenly into your bundt pan then smooth out the top. Depending on your oven I would do 50-70 mins at 350.",

When it looks like it's about to get hard that's when you want to drizzle it along the top of the cake.

      "Combine in a small bowl the salt, pepper, cayenne, and five-spice. Heat a wok or large skillet (10-inch is ideal, but I've had success with an 8-inch skillet as well), then add the oil. When just hot enough to bubble and sizzle the nuts, deep-fry the cashew nuts for 2-3 minutes or until they begin to turn slightly brown. Keep the nuts moving in the oil so they brown evenly. Ken didn't give a temperature, but I find the 300-325 degree range to be safe to prevent any scorching. While the nuts are browning, start to heat another skillet. Remove the nuts from the oil with a slotted spoon when they are lightly toasted. Do not allow them to brown very deeply, as they will continue cooking even after they have been taken out of the oil. Add the nuts directly to the other skillet. Add the salt, pepper, cayenne and five-spice powder mixture and stir-fry for 2 minutes or until the cashew nuts are well coated with the spices. Remove to a bowl and allow to cool completely and crisp up before serving with drinks.",
      "Note: I have recently learned about an Indian technique used with cashews: cover the raw nuts with water and let them soak for 2 minutes. Drain thoroughly before frying. If anyone knows the science behind this technique, please comment! Otherwise, I'll try it myself one of these days and update the recipe if it improves this tasty nosh."

      "MARMALADE: Slice the kumquats in half length wise and take out the seeds. Slice them thinly and mix in a bowl with the sugar. I usually do this while my dough rests before I roll it out. The fruit and sugar need to sit together for about an hour or more so that the kumquats release all their juice.",

      "GANACHE: The most important part here is a high quality chocolate. Don't bother with anything that doesn't taste good to eat on it's own. Check the ingredients. The fewer the better. Ideally all you want to see is cocoa mass, sugar and cocoa butter. Some good stuff has a little vanilla and even some lecithan in it. But try the chocolate before you use it.

It depends on how much coconut you put in and also on how moist your apricots and prunes were to begin with. You don't want the mixture to be too moist - about the consistency of meatloaf is perfect. You will be surprised when you taste this filling to find that the glaceed fruits have completely melded in with the other flavors and that the filling is very fruity, sweet, and tart with just a very slight hint of bitterness from the citrus peel.",
      "TO COMPOSE THE STRUDEL: Lay out a full sheet of filo and brush with a little butter. With the short side of the filo at the bottom, randomly and unevenly sprinkle bits (about a teaspoon or so each) of filling all over the filo sheet up to about 2-3 inches from the top. Starting at the bottom, roll the filling into the filo. The idea is that when you have completely rolled up a sheet with filling, there will be places where the filo is in between the filling from the \"level\" above. At first, in some places there is filling and some places there is just empty dough. By the time you have rolled the whole sheet, you should have a solidly filled roll that is about 1-2 inches in diameter. Wrap the unfilled filo at the top around the roll and secure with it with a brush of butter. Brush the roll with more butter on the outside and set it aside on a baking sheet until you have rolled up all of the filling this way.",
      "Bake the rolls in a 350 degree oven until the filo is golden brown. Remove the baking sheets from the oven and run a spatula under the strudel to loosen it from the sheet. Allow the strudel to cool thoroughly and then cut it in 1\" pieces. Store in a parchment lined tin or plastic container in layers , with parchment between each layer. Dust each layer lightly with powdered sugar.",
      "Blot a folded up white paper towel with whiskey and get it nice and damp, but not at all dripping. Place this in your tin or plastic container to help keep the strudel fresh and soft (although it is really good even when it gets a little hard).",
      "When well sealed in a tin, strudel will keep for at least 6 months."

      "It's much easier to use a mixer to make this large quantity of dough, but of course you can also make it by hand as people have done for centuries. In a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook (or large bowl) combine the water and sugar. Sprinkle the yeast over the water and let it stand until it's foamy, about 10 minutes. Add the oil, then the whole wheat flour and the salt. When those are mixed in, begin adding the white flour, one cup at a time. Mix the dough until it comes together and the sides of the bowl are almost clean. The dough should still be a little bit sticky. If necessary, add a little more flour, but be sure the dough remains elastic.",
      "Using olive oil, lightly oil a large bowl. Place the dough in it and turn it over so that the whole dough ball is coated with oil. Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap. Let it stand in warm draft-free area until the dough doubles, about 1-1 1/2 hours.",
      "After the dough has doubled in size, gently punch it down and knead it lightly in the bowl for a minute or two. Divide the dough into 8 equal pieces (it helps to use a kitchen scale for this so that everyone gets the same amount of crust to work with).",
      "Light a charcoal grill, using wood chunks if at all possible, high-quality briquets otherwise. Let the fire die down to a super-hot glow with no active flames.",
      "Now, depending on your guests, you can either pre-cook the dough rounds just before they arrive, or let each person work with her own dough. In either case, this is what you need to do. Roll or pat out each piece on a lightly floured surface to a 9\" round.",
      "Pre-cook the crusts like this: place each crust on the hot grill and cook just until the underside is crisp, about 2-3 minutes. Flip the crust and grill for another minute. The dough should not be burnt, but it will not be cooked all the way through either.",
      "Now you're ready to top the pizza. I suggest covering the whole dining table (or other very large work surface) in aluminum foil to facilitate cleanup. Place all of the toppings in the center of the table and give each person one of the pre-cooked crusts. Instruct them to place the toppings on the well-cooked side of the crust, because the lightly cooked side will get more cooking once the toppings are in place.",
      "Using baking sheets to ferry the topped crusts to the grill, let each person grill her own masterpiece. It's best to do this with the cover on the grill, to help melt the cheese and bring the toppings together. Depending on your fire, this last step should take 3-4 minutes per pizza. This means that everyone won't sit down to eat at the same moment, but both those eating and those grilling will be happily occupied, and every pizza will be crafted to the diner's exact specifications. People LOVE to do this, and it's amazing how many people have never made their own pizza before."

      "To make the dough: In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, salt, and instant yeast. Add the water. Using a rubber spatula, mix until the water is absorbed and the ingredients form a sticky dough ball. (If you need to use active dry yeast instead, proof it in the lukewarm water with a pinch of sugar first for about 10 minutes, until foamy, before adding to the other ingredients.)",
      "Cover the bowl with a damp tea towel or plastic wrap and set aside in a warm spot to rise for 1 to 1 1/2 hours, until the dough has doubled in bulk. Note: Here's a trick for making the perfect warm spot for the dough to rise. Set the oven to 400\u00b0 F and let it preheat for 1 minute, then shut it off. The temperature will be between 80\u00b0 F and 100\u00b0 F. you should be able to place your hands (carefully) on the oven grates without burning them.",
      "Set a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat it to 550\u00b0 F. Cover a work surface or cutting board liberally with flour - use at least 1/4 cup and more as needed. The dough is very wet, so don't hesitate to use flour as needed. Using two forks, deflate the dough by releasing it from the sides of the bowl and pulling it toward the center. Rotate the bowl quarter turns as you deflate, turning the mass into a rough ball. Turn the dough out onto your floured surface and use a bench scraper to divide the dough into 6 equal portions. With floured hands, roll each portion into a ball, using the pinkie-edges of your hands to pinch the dough underneath each ball. Let the balls sit on their tucked-in edges for at least 20 minutes without touching.",
      "Meanwhile, prepare the kale-and-mushroom filling. Heat a large saute pan over high heat. Add 2 tablespoons of the oil. When it shimmers, reduce the heat to medium, add the mushrooms and let them cook for 1 minute without disturbing them. After the 1 minute, stir to distribute and rearrange, then let cook for another minute. Stir again. Season with kosher salt and let cook another minute. When mushrooms are brown on all sides, scoop them into a bowl and return the skillet to high heat. Add the remaining tablespoon of olive oil. When it shimmers, add the kale and let cook for 1 minute without disturbing it. After the 1 minute, stir to distribute and rearrange, then let cook for another minute. Stir again. Season with kosher salt and let cook another minute. When the kale has wilted, turn off the heat, return the mushrooms to the pan, stir to combine, and taste. Adjust with salt to taste.",
      "Pour 1/2 teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil into one or two 8- to 10-inch oven-safe skillet. (If you have two skillets, prepare two-I don't bake more than two pizzas at a time, but if you have two ovens or if your oven is large enough to fit three skillets on one rack, you can prepare three skillets at this step.) Transfer one ball of dough to each prepared skillet, and roll in the oil to coat.",
      "With oiled hands and working from the center out, gently stretch the dough to fit the skillet or into an 8- to 9-inch round. As soon as the dough begins resisting or tearing, stop, let it rest for 5 minutes, then stretch again-small tears are fine and can easily be pinched back together.",
      "Spoon creme fraiche over the dough leaving a 1/2-inch border or so-I use about a tablespoon per pizza. Top with a layer of sauteed kale and mushrooms. Top with mozzarella to taste. Drizzle lightly with olive oil. Sprinkle with sea salt. Place the skillets in the oven, one or two at a time, and bake for 8 to 10 minutes, until the edges are golden. Check the underside with a metal spatula; it should be crisp and golden brown. If the underside of the crust is still pale, continue baking for 3 to 5 minutes, or place the pan over a burner on medium-high heat for about a minute, keeping an eye on it the entire time and continuing to peek at the underside."

Shake off any excess water, then transfer the rice to a blender along with the 535 grams of water. Let the rice soak for 4 to 5 hours, at which point the grains should crush easily between your fingers. Add the potato starch or cornstarch and blend for 2 to 3 minutes, pausing to scrape the mixer down from the edges as needed. Once liquified, run the mixture through a very fine sieve into a large bowl. Use the back of a spoon to press down any large rice clumps to help them pass through the sieve. Set aside as you set up your steamer. Proceed to Step 3.",

Put the lid on and bring the water to a boil over high heat.) Find a shallow sheet pan that fits into your steamer or makeshift steamer (I used a pizza pan, but a shallow metal pie pan will also work), and brush the pan with canola oil. Whisk the batter, then pour in enough to cover the pan in a thin layer. Place the pan inside of the steamer as level as possible, so that the noodles cook evenly.\r\nPlace the lid on the steamer and steam the sheet of rice mixture on high heat for 2 to 3 minutes, or until large bubbles form on the surface of the sheet of rice noodles.

Tilt the pan towards a cutting board, then gently scrape the noodle-sheet onto the cutting board. Cut the noodles into thick strips with a pastry cutter. Don't worry if your strips are curling up rather than staying flat -- no matter what, the noodles will stick to each other in the absence of liquid, so don't freak out. They will separate easily once sauce is applied.",

      "If using fresh beans, soak them the night before with a bit of lemon juice. Lentils can be soaked for just an hour or 30 minutes. Once ready, rinse them well. Pre-cook the beans for about 20 to 30 minutes. If using canned, add them 10 minutes before the end of cooking.",
      "Wash, trim, and cut all the vegetables: Finely dice the onion, celery, and all but one carrot. Cut the last carrot more coarsely. The chopped base of these three vegetables is called soffritto. Chop the other vegetables into chunkier pieces.",
      "Add the oil to a pot that can hold all the vegetables and water to cook them. Peel the garlic cloves and crush them, then lightly stir fry them with the sage and rosemary. Even though the pot is big, it is best to use a medium flame for this recipe. After some 5 minutes everything should smell very aromatic.",
      "Add the soffritto mixture to the oil and stir around. Let it cook until the onion gets a bit translucent; another 5 minutes will do. Then, remove the herbs and garlic.",
      "Add the potatoes, pumpkin, beans, split peas, tomato sauce, bouillon cube (if using), and Parmesan rind (if using). Stir things around a bit and add water to cover everything by a couple inches. Partially cover the pot, and wait for it to come to a boil.",
      "At this point add about a half tablespoon of the salt. It is best to check again for salt later. Keep it to a steady, gentle simmer.",
      "After 10 minutes, add the lentils, the zucchini, and the chard. Now you can leave it to cook undisturbed for 30 more minutes; just check it every now and then to make sure there's enough water in the pot and nothing sticks. You can add more or less water depending on how thick you want it to be, but don't add too much or it might get bland. When the soup is almost done, check for salt and adjust to your liking.",
      "For the croutons: Cut slices of crusty bread and rub them with garlic, olive oil, and rosemary. Or, cut them into rough cubes and toss them with those ingredients. Toast them until crispy and golden.",
      "Serve the soup with the croutons or bruschetta, a bit more olive oil, and a teaspoon or two of Parmigiano. It is really good straight from the pot, and 1,000 times better a few hours later or the day after.",
      "SUBSTITUTIONS:\r\n\r\n- Use any kind of bean you like!\r\n- Change the vegetables according to what's seasonally available.\r\n- Chickpeas, small pasta, or other things like millet, rice, farro, etc. would be great add-ons or bread substitutes. I actually added the bread just for styling purposes, as I tend to avoid it when I can.\r\n- Miso would be good instead of the salt. Not italian, but it would do an awesome job! Use a little over a tablespoon instead of the bouillon cube."

Stir everything while the wine simmers in the pan, scraping up any browned bits leftover from cooking the meat. Let the wine simmer until it is reduced a bit, about 1 minute. Add the Worcestershire sauce, tomatoes with their juices, and beef broth. Add the browned beef (including any juices on the plate), potatoes, thyme, and bay leaves. Stir everything until it is combined. Bring it to a boil and then reduce the heat so that the soup simmers. Cover the pot and simmer over low heat until the beef is fork-tender, about 1 1/2 hours. Add the chopped chard and simmer 20 minutes more. Season to taste with salt and freshly ground black pepper.",

      "Put the 2-cups of chicken stock into a pot and bring to a boil. Reduce the stock by half. While the stock is reducing focus on the leftover cauliflower. With the outer pieces of cauliflower and trimmed stalk, pare the pieces into about 1/2\" segments. When the stock has reduced, add the milk and the cauliflower. If the liquid is not enough to cover, add more milk. Add 1 tablespoon of the garlic confit oil and the clove of garlic as well (paper removed). Pinch of coriander seeds. Now, here is the secret, grate a touch of nutmeg. Not too much, just enough to know it is there. Bring to a boil and simmer until the cauliflower is tender when pricked with a knife.",
      "Strain the cauliflower from the liquid and reserve the liquid. Put the cauliflower in a blender, add 1/2 cup of the cooking liquid, tablespoon of butter. Blend until a fine, silky puree is produced. Add more liquid as needed. The puree should have the consistency of a soft whipped cream. Firm enough to stand by itself, by loose enough that it settles/spreads if you hit the bottom of the plate. Season to taste.",
      "Now, preheat your oven to 425degrees fahrenheit. Take an oven-safe skillet just large enough to fit both cauliflower steaks and heat over a medium heat.",

Baste the back of the cauliflower with a bit more oil and after 3-4minutes check for browning. When browned to desired golden-brown. Flip and put the pan in the oven. Check on the steak in 5minutes. It is done when the stem is easily pricked with the tip of a knife.",
      "Plating. Dollop the puree in the center of the plate and spread into a round. Hit the bottom of the plate to smooth out the ridges and make the round look as close to pristine as possible. Set the \"steak\" into the middle carefully so that you do not mess up your puree. Pick the points of parsley off of the leaves and place around. Drizzle the picual or other spicy olive oil around the plate. Spritz with a bit of lemon juice. Pepper flakes around the border. And a grind of white pepper as well as a sprinkle of maldon sea salt over the dish. Eat."

Transfer the broccoli florets to the baking sheet, season with salt and freshly ground black pepper, and broil them until they begin to turn brown and crispy around the edges. Keep a close eye on the broccoli to prevent it from burning. Everyone's broiler is different, so this step may take anywhere from 2-5 minutes. Set the cooked florets aside until they are cool enough to handle.",
      "Transfer the broccoli florets to the food processor. Add the 3/4 cup of olive oil, along with the garlic cloves, pine nuts, lemon zest and juice, and pecorino romano. Pulse until everything comes together. Do not over-process the pesto, you do not want a puree. Tiny pieces of the broccoli should be visible. Taste the pesto and adjust with salt, pepper, and/or lemon as necessary. Note that this pesto can be made ahead of time and stored in the refrigerator.",
      "Using a vegetable peeler, shave away the fibrous outside layer of the broccoli stems. You could also use a paring knife to carefully cut away the outside layer of the broccoli stems. To test whether you have peeled away enough of the outside layer of the stem, cut off a small piece of the stem and taste it. It should taste crisp and fresh. If it is fibrous and hard to chew, peel off more of the stem and try again. Cut the stems into thin slivers about 1/4-inch thick. Set a medium skillet over medium heat, and add just enough olive oil to cover the bottom of the skillet. When the oil is hot, add the broccoli stems. Cook them, stirring occasionally until they begin to brown on the outside. Remove them from the heat, season with salt and freshly ground pepper, and set them aside.",

Cook according to the instructions on the box, except undercook your pasta by 1 to 2 minutes. Strain the pasta from the boiling water, and dress it in the broccoli pesto. Fold in the sauteed broccoli stems. Using a box grater, grate half of the smoked mozzarella, and fold it into the pasta. Using a knife, cut the remaining smoked mozzarella into thin medallions. Transfer the pasta to a baking dish, and top with the medallions of smoked mozzarella. Bake at 450\u00b0 F until the cheese begins to melt and brown, approximately 5 to 10 minutes.

The aromas are very strong and it is easy for it to become over powering. So, I prefer to take it slowly and taste the cream and decide if the flavor is to my liking. Black truffles are wonderful but, needs to be delicate in flavor as well.\r\nOnce to my liking I add this cream to my whipping cream siphon and leave in fridge for a couple of hours.",

I know in the US it is a bit more difficult.\r\nPreheat the oven to 225-250C depending on your oven.\r\n\r\nTo prepare the fois gras triangles first take one filo sheet and spread on chopping board. Cover the rest of the packet so it does not dry out.\r\nI purchase the filo sheet( feuille de brique) sold in the shape of a circle which I prefer. I cut the large circle in half. Then I fold the half in half. Place a nice tablespoon of fois gras 1 1/2 cm and the end closest to you. Top of with a little teaspoon of fig confit, a touch of fleur de sel, and cracked pepper. Fold the right corner side towards the left seam to form a triangle. Continue making rolling from left to right until the triangle is complete. Fold left over sheet into little pocket of the triangle. Place on baking dish finished triangles and brush with melted butter. Bake in oven for 20 minutes until crisp. Arrange on a square or rectangle white plate the samosas top of triangle at the top. Make a row going down. Top of with a pretty touch of black truffle whipping cream. A bit of shaved black truffle, and a sprig of chive for deco. \r\nNote: I did not add melted butter on the filo dough while folding the triangles because Fois Gras can be oily when melted so, no need to add the extra butter during the first step.",

Pour the mixture back into the original cream pot. Set aside your whisk and bring out a wooden spoon. Place back on medium heat. And start stirring. Don't walk away or you will have scrambled eggs. Watch and feel for the shift in viscosity. As you stir, the thin custard will slap against the sides of the pot like waves against the side of a boat. As it thickens, the gliding spoon will cause the custard to rise up and settle back down without much of a splash. This takes anywhere from 3 to 5 minutes. But don't time it. Just watch. To confirm that it's done, do the drag-your-finger-across-the-back-of-the-wooden-spoon test. It's ready when your finger leaves a lovely lingering trail. Pour mixture through the fine strainer into the medium bowl that's resting in the large bowl. Pour just enough water in with the ice cubes so that the ice water is at least half way up the side of the bowl filled with the ice cream custard. Leave bowl over the ice bath until it's cool.

Stir it well. Add the semolina and rye (or barley, or wheat or white, if you're not using rye) flours, and stir again. Make sure you stir all in the same direction, by the way.",
      "Add the diced roasted potatoes, if using, the salt and one cup of bread flour. Stir it well to combine.",

      "Knead until the dough comes together and is fairly smooth. It should take no more than five or six minutes. The potatoes and skins that have come loose will make it a bit lumpy, but don't worry about that.",
      "Rinse your bowl and dry it well. Drizzle about a teaspoon of olive oil into it and put the dough in. Flip it over to coat it evenly, then top the bowl with a piece of parchment at least twelve inches square. Put a towel over the paper and put the covered bowl in the refrigerator for at least six hours.",
      "About an hour before using the dough, take it out and let it come to room temperature. It will take less than an hour if you pull the dough apart into smaller pieces. Make sure they are well oiled and covered so they don't dry out.",
      "N.B. Right after making the dough, you should saute the onions or shallots, if you want to use the skillet in which you cooked the pancetta. Doing this flavors the onions beautifully, assuming that you like pancetta, of course. See Step 3 below, for more details.",
      "Also, you can make the dough up to a day ahead of time. Just put it in a plastic bag that you tie off tightly, leaving some room for the dough to rise. Keep it refrigerated until an hour before using.",

      "Put parchment onto a large cookie sheet, preferably one with an open end, off of which you can slide the paper and the uncooked stromboli. You can also work on a pizza peel, of course. If you like using cornmeal or semolina flour instead of the parchment, you can do that, too. I find the parchment on the cookie sheet method to be much easier.",

      "While you roast the garlic, wash the potatoes very well, cut in half horizontally and put in a pan covering them with cold water. Add 1 tablespoon of salt and cook for 20 minutes or until a blade of a sharp knife goes smoothly through the potatoes. Try and have all the halves the same size so they cook at the same time.",
      "When cooked, drain the potatoes and put each half, cut side down in a potato ricer fitted with the smaller wholes disk. Press to mash, open the handles and remove the skin. Continue until all the potatoes are finished. Always mash potatoes while still hot and never leave them in the cooking water.",
      "Bring the milk and cream to a boil.",
      "Put the mashed potatoes in a pan, add half the roasted garlic, and stir with a wooden spatula vigorously. Add the olive oil and follow by the hot milk and cream in a steady stream always mixing vigorously. Depending of the moisture level of the potatoes you might need less or more milk. Taste the potato garlic mash. If you like more garlic taste add more roasted garlic to your tasting. Season with salt. Set aside covering the puree with plastic film directly on top of the mash so it doesn't form a dry hard skin.",

Drizzle some olive oil on the parchment paper, add the 3 vegetables on top, layering with the saffron threads so they are in the middle of the vegetables, sprinkle a little salt, and drizzle with the remaining olive oil.

They will have very distinct falvours.",

Once the oil is hot, quickly dip the tomatoes in the flour, egg, and then bread crumbs so that you get an even coat on both sides (don't do this ahead of time or you will make glue). Place into the pan.\r\nFry until GBnD (Golden Brown and Delicious), about 2 minutes on each side. Place on paper towel and to soak up excess oil and cover to keep warm (or put in oven to keep warm).",
      "In the meantime, heat 2 tablespoons of butter in a non-stick pan on medium high. Beat four eggs and once the butter begins to bubble, lower to low heat, add four eggs and scramble - stirring constantly until the eggs are creamy but cooked. Add salt and pepper to taste. Should take no more than about 5-6 minutes. (The eggs will not be creamy if you cook them on high heat.)",

Bring it to a boil. Once it's boiling, turn off the heat, and add your 6 black tea bags. Put on a lid and let it go completely cool.",

Sift in your flour, salt, baking powder and baking soda. Give it a nice whisk until almost combined. Fish your spices out of the milk and add it to the batter (I left the tea leaves in the batter, but you can totally strain everything, if you want to). Mix until it's all combined. Pour the batter into the prepared pans and bake it for 30 to 40 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Let it cool completely once it's done",

Add the 1/2 tsp of salt and 2 tbsp of your black tea infused milk. Mix again until combined. Now, it's up to you how you want this frosting to be: if you want it looser, add more milk (I added about 4 tbsp), or add less if you like it stiffer, if you want it less sweet, add more salt, and keep ajusting, until you think it's good.",

Cut out the top of both cakes, to make it even (you don't have to do this what so ever, I did it because I think it looks prettier when it comes to naked cakes). Now, you can decorate this however you like, I decided to make a naked cake, but really, follow your heart and do whatever floats your boat lol Take out the pieces of parchmen paper and serve!\r\nThis cake can also be made in advance, just leave it in the fridge and take it out about 20 minutes before serving."

      "Have the butcher disjoint the oxtails - that is, cut them through at the joints, not hack them into pieces. [Just love this instruction ! Today precut oxtails are available in most large supermarkets.]",
      "Preheat oven to 450. Let oxtails come to room temperature, then season each one well with salt [I use Kosher salt] and freshly ground black pepper. Dredge each oxtail thoroughly in flour and pat off any excess. Being careful not to crowd them, place oxtails in a flat baking dish [I use a roaster with handles]. Roast at 450 for 30 minutes. [Beard says to shake the pan from time to time and baste the meat with its own juices. I only sometimes shake the pan and never baste. Seems to work for me.]",
      "Remove pan from oven and pour off fat. [I usually don't find it necessary to pour off fat. If I need to, however, I remove the oxtails to a platter first, then pour off excess fat being careful to leave all the browned, yummy bits of fond behind. Then I return the oxtails to the roaster.]",
      "Move oxtails close together in the roaster. Carefully warm the brandy in a large metal soup ladle. Pour warmed brandy over oxtails and flame. When flame extinguishes itself, transfer oxtails to a deep casserole and add the carrots, onion, thyme, parsley, bay leaf and enough water and broth or water and wine to cover. [I tend to use a no/low-salt beef broth rather than the wine. And if I've been really organized and have homemade broth/stock - it really does taste the best. If using fresh thyme, increase the amount to 1 tablespoon. Dried thyme is quite successful in this dish, however.]",
      "Lower oven heat to 350. Braise oxtails, covered, for 3 hours. [I usually stir them around at this point.] Reduce heat to 250 and cook, covered, for 3 hours more. [Often the oxtails are \"falling off the bone\" wonderful after the first three hours. If I cook them further, I usually check them at 4 hours and they are usually ready.]",
      "Serve in deep bowls with plenty of rich broth. Beard says, \"Boiled potatoes and braised cabbage sprinkled with poppy seeds go well with the ragout.\" I agree. But I also like these served with goat cheese infused polenta. The goat cheese seems to cut the unctuousness of the oxtails.",
      "Beard also notes, \"The ragout is even better if made the day before, cooled, skimmed of fat and reheated.\" Agreed.",
      "I use this basic technique/recipe for braised short ribs, too. The mess of browning stovetop is avoided, the brandy lends depth to the braise, and the short ribs, like the oxtails, never fail to be meltingly delicious."

      "It all starts with choosing the right fish. How do you know, which one to pick? Here are my little hints. Do not go for a big fish; the bigger the fish, the older it is and the more likely its meat will be drier. My turbot was only 700gr/1.5lb and it was more than enough for two people. (Anything below 1kg/2.2lb is good.) The freshness of the fish can be judged by the eyes of the fish: only fish, caught in the last 24 hours will have normal eyes. Within the second 24 hours after being caught, its eyes will become blurred and homogeneous.",
      "Set your fish ready. No cleaning, no cutting or peeling required! Just rinse it in cold water and place it on a yummy, herbal pillow made of dill, tarragon, lemons and lot of salt. Salt serves as a protector from the direct heat waves. It keeps the fish moisturised and evenly spreads the heat.",
      "Place the fish onto the herbs and cover it in salt. Make sure, that every single piece of your fish is well covered. Drizzle with a few splashes of water to help salt particles get sticky and literally seal your fish from all sides. (The dill below was just for fun: a kind of a tribute to my beautiful fishie . I took it away after taking this photo.) Put the tray into the pre-heated oven and cook for 30-35 minutes: 180C/356F/fan.",
      "When the fish is ready, take it out and carefully crush the top. It will be solid and hard as a rock. So, split it in halves with a sharp knife and carefully remove each of them, not ruining the fish.",
      "Now turn the fish upside down and gently remove the first layer of the meat! Do not forget the most delicious \"bullets\", which are proudly looking at you from the fins of the fish. You can still see them on the left side of the photo below. These bullets are the real vitamin bomb, ready to explode with albumin... AND! they are super-mega juicy and tasty. My favourite part of this fish!",
      "Remove the spine and the bones on the fins: just pull them up and take out. Now melt a piece of unsalted butter and pour it on top of your fish. Squeeze more fresh lemon to cut off the fat and enjoy! By the way a lot of people eat Mr. Turbot's skin - it is very thin, soft, stretchy and healthy. But be carful and do not consume too much, as it is also very rich in fish oils. Though very taste in the beginning, it might cause dizziness afterwords."

      "N.B. If you don't care for aniseed, toasted cumin seeds also work well . . . . very different, but tasty!!",
      "CANNING TIP #1: Regardless of what other instructions you see in recipes posted in various places on the internet, make sure that you put your canning lids in simmering water (no hotter than 180 degrees) and that you keep them hot just until you use them. It's not enough simply to make sure they're clean. You put them in the hot water to soften the gasket (the rubber rim), which is essential to creating a good seal.",
      "CANNING TIP #2: A procedure I discovered (and have wondered how on earth it's taken so long, after all these years of canning, to figure out) is to use a large, towel-lined rectangular baking pan for moving jars to and from the hot water bath, to and from my workspace, and from the stove to the shelf where I cool the jars. Just make sure it's a pan you don't need to use for other things during the twenty-four hours that the jars are cooling. It's a really safe way to move hot jars, and is so efficient, too!!",
      "CANNING TIP #3: Here's a tip about making condiments for gift giving. All condiments taste better after a few weeks or in some instances, after a month. Every batch will vary, regardless of how many times you've used the recipe, because the fruit will be different from year to year. I usually do my initial vacuum seal of condiments in pints or quarts, and then, in the weeks before the December holidays, taste test the condiments again. If they are worthy of gift giving, I then reheat to boiling and re-seal and process the condiments in 4 or 8 ounce jars. You can also test and correct seasoning at this point. ;o)"

Strain the stock through a fine-mesh strainer into a bowl and discard the solids. Set aside to coo",
      "Meat Filled Tortellini: Heat a medium heavy saute pan over medium heat. Add the butter and let it melt, tipping and turning the pan to coat it. Add the bay leaves and cook for 1 minute to infuse the butter with their flavor. Add the pork shoulder and sausage and cook, stirring frequently with a wooden spoon, until the meats are browned all over and cooked through, about 8 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and set aside to cool: remove and discard the bay leaves. Once they are cooled, transfer the meats to the bowl of a food processor, add the prosciutto and mortadella, and pulse until coarsely ground and amalgamated. Transfer the mixture to a large mixing bowl: add the cheese, egg, and nutmeg; and mix with a wooden spoon until incorporated. Season with salt and a few grinds of pepper and mix in. Fill a spray bottle with water and set it so that it produces a fine mist when the trigger is pressed. Set your pasta machine to the thinnest setting and roll the pasta sheets through it. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and lightly rust with rice flour. Lay the pasta sheets on a floured surface and use a wheel cutter or sharp chef's knife to cut them into 1 1/2 inch wide strips, then into about 125- 1 1/2 inch squares (use a ruler or straight edge to guide you). Working with 12 squares at a time, and keeping the other squares hydrated under a damp kitchen towel, use a teaspoon to spoon a scant amount of filling into the center of each square. Hold the spray bottle a foot or 2 above the pasta and press once to release a mist of water over the squares, then form the tortellini: Working with one square at a time, fold the square in half to form a triangle and press the edges together to seal them. Hold the triangle with the center point facing down and bend the two ends around, overlapping the ends by about 1/4 inch and pressing them together. As they are done, arrange them point side up on the rice-flour-dusted baking sheet and repeat with the remaining dough and filling: there may be less than a dozen squares in the last batch.",
      "Tortellini in Brodo: Pour the stock into a large pot and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat so the broth simmers gently, add the tortellini, and cook until they float to the surface, about 2 minutes. While the tortellini are cooking, put 1 tablespoon of butter in the bottom of each of 4-6 wide shallow bowls. Ladle the tortellini and broth in the bowls: the hot broth will melt the butter. Grate some cheese over each serving and serve immediately."

    "title": "sturgeon bathed in anchovy tomato sauce with mediterranean friends",
    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "PREP: \r\n\r\nIn a small saucepan, heat 1 TB olive oil until very hot, but not smoking. Drop in the chopped anchovies, they will sizzle. Turn down the heat slightly and let them fry for a minute or two until fragrant.",
      "Add the tomato sauce, cover and let simmer a few minutes more until the flavors have melded. Set aside",
      "Brush the cauliflower with olive oil, grind over fresh pepper and roast in a 400 degree oven until browned (20-30 minutes). Cut into florets, trimming away most of the stem, set aside.",
      "COOK: \r\n\r\nIn a heated skillet tipped with olive oil, brown the sturgeon on one side. When you are able to move it without sticking to the pan, flip it over, add the onion and garlic.",
      "Turn the heat down a bit, stir the onion mix and add in the rosemary, capers, olives,",
      "Pour in the white wine and bring to a simmer. Add the mussels; give the pan another shake.",
      "Add the tomato sauce and roasted cauliflower. Quickly bring back to a simmer and transfer to the oven (which should still be heated to 400 degrees). If you haven't already done so, put the bread in the oven to heat and toast slightly being careful not to burn.",
      "If the mussels have already opened and the fish still feels dense to the touch, transfer the mussels to a plate and keep in a warming drawer or covered nearby. The fish might need 5 - 10 minutes in the oven to cook through and become tender.",
      "When the fish is nearly ready, add the mussels back to the pan to heat through.",
      "SERVE: \r\n\r\nTear each slice of bread into large pieces and place in the bottom of 2 (or 3) deep, heated, individual serving bowls. Ladle some of the sauce over the bread then, using kitchen tongs, place a piece of fish and three mussels on top with a few pieces of cauliflower alongside.",
      "MAKE THE TOMATO SAUCE: \r\n\r\nIn a stock pot, sweat the onion, carrots and garlic in the olive oil until they are soft (approximately 10 minutes). Listen to them sizzle softly, without browning and reflect on the day.",
      "Add the vinegar and cook for another minute before adding the wine. Breathe in the fragrance and exhale.",
      "Now empty the tomatoes into the pot, stir. Take in the wonderful hue of red with your eyes and recall warm summer gardens brimming with plump, sweet tomatoes bursting from the vines.",
      "Stir in the tomato paste and grind in the pepper. Feel the strength of your hands as the mill turns out the fiery black speckles.",
      "Add in the chili flakes through the fresh basil, one spice at a time. Pause after each addition to appreciate the smell and imagine the taste that the spice will bring to the finished sauce. Tip the jar a little further or scoop the herb a little fuller if you feel more will improve the taste.",
      "Bring the mixture to a rumbling simmer, turn down the heat and cover the pot. Let it simmer this way for 30 minutes, or so. Don't go too far though, it will need attention and stirring. As you lift the lid to stir, breathe in the aromas, deep and slow. Break up the tomatoes with the back of your spoon, put the lid back on the pot and pour yourself a glass of wine.",
      "After the 30 minutes, or so, remove the lid and continue to simmer, gently, for at least another hour, more if you desire. I usually go about my business attending to other things and keep it simmering away for several hours, adding the lid when it gets thicker than I want, and then removing the lid to thicken a little more.",
      "When the sauce is done, you can keep it chunky or use a small hand mixer to puree the sauce into a more even consistency as I would for the sturgeon."

      "Move pork loin to indirect heat, turning it only as necessary and ideally just once. Insert a probe thermometer at this point. Cook the pork loin up to an internal temperature of 145 degrees F (USDA recommendation) or to your preference. Remember, the internal temperature of the pork loin will rise by roughly five degrees during resting, so pull your pork loin off the grill at 140 degrees F if 145 is your target temperature. You definitely want to avoid drying out the roast.",
      "Rest the pork loin for at least ten minutes before slicing. I prefer 1/2 to 3/4 inch slices, but I always cut any leftovers thin for cold pork sandwiches."

      "Once the yeast has proofed add in the remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil, the sauteed shallot, and the salt. Then start adding the flour one cupful at a time, mixing with a wooden spoon after each addition. When the dough is clumping together and it has become really hard to stir it in the bowl dust a surface with some more flour and dump the dough out of the bowl. (I soak the bowl with some warm water at this point to re-use it for letting the dough rise. I just hate lots of dishes.) At this point I have usually used close to 2 cups of the flour but the humidity levels in the air are what really end up determining how much flour you use. Once The dough is on the floured surface knead it for 8 minutes until it feels homogeneous and springs back when you poke it lightly with your finger. Add in extra flour if the dough gets sticky when you are kneading it.",
      "Once the dough is done kneading set it aside. Rinse and dry the bowl you used for mixing. Then put a small glug (about a teaspoonful) of olive oil in the bowl and spread it all over the bowl using a paper towel. Put the dough into the bowl turning it around to coat the dough completely with a little of the olive oil. Cover the bowl with a damp kitchen towel or some plastic wrap and set it in a warm, draft free place to rise for 1 hour. During the summer I just leave my bowel on the counter but in the winter I put it in the oven with the light on.",
      "While the dough is rising combine the oregano and the salami in a bowl and let the cream cheese come to room temperature. Grease an 8\" x4\" x 2\" loaf pan. I use a Pam spray for this. Even though I don't like the aerosols in them I find the the bread never sticks to the pan when I use it. You can do what you want.",
      "In an hour the dough will have doubled in size. If it needs a little more time to double then check it in another 15 minutes. If it has doubled then punch it down with your fist and knead it on a clean surface for a minute to get out any large air bubbles.",
      "Roll the dough out into a large rectangle (about 10\"-12\"x 18\"). Spread the softened cream cheese over the dough leaving an inch space around the perimeter of the dough. Then sprinkle the cream cheese with the salami, oregano mixture.",

Allow the dough to have a second rise for 30 minutes. Pre-heat the oven to 350\u00b0. \r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the second rise is over put the dough into the oven and bake it for 30 minutes. The bread is done when it's golden brown and sounds hollow when you tap it. Let the bread rest in the pan for 10 minutes and then turn the bread out onto a rack to cool completely.

      "Next, gently boil the shells with the stock, rice, lemongrass, and garlic until the rice is very tender and the stock tastes fragrant, or about 40 minutes. Puree everything in a blender, and reserve.",
      "In the empty pot, add your tomato paste and curry paste on medium heat, and lightly brown before slowly whisking in the coconut milk. Now strain the puree mixture through a sieve into the pot, and continually push the ingredients through to extract the most liquid without getting the grainy shells bits.",
      "Whisk everything together in the pot, and bring back to a gentle boil. Serve with cilantro, and eat in the sun!",

The hot chocolate needs to be blended at this point. At Laduree, this is done with a hand-held blender (also called an immersion blender). If you have this tool, leave the hot chocolate in the saucepan and whip it with the hand-held blender for 1 minute. If you don't have a hand-held blender, transfer the chocolate to a traditional blender and whip on high speed for 1 minute. (When blending hot liquids, be sure to remove the center insert from the top of the blender, and cover the top with a folded kitchen towel to allow steam to escape.) The chocolate should be served immediately, while it is still very hot and frothy. Alternatively, you can pour the chocolate into a container to cool; the cooled chocolate can be reheated or served chilled. (The chocolate can be made up to 2 days ahead and kept tightly covered in the refrigerator.)",

      "Let the cakes cool for 20 minutes on a rack before inverting them. Once fully cooled, stick them in the freezer while you make the frosting (this is optional but makes them easier to frost).",
      "For the frosting: Pour the egg whites and sugar into a bowl of a double boiler. Use a whisk to beat the mixture over the heat until the sugar has entirely dissolved. Remove from the heat and either transfer to a stand mixer or get out an electric hand mixer. Beat until the egg whites form stiff peaks. Slowly add the butter in tiny pieces. If the frosting starts to separate or curdle, keep beating! It should smooth out.",
      "Puree the raspberries in a blender until smooth. Press the mixture through a strainer to remove the seeds and mix the puree into the frosting to tint it pink. (Note: I used plain buttercream in my filling, then added the raspberries to the frosting just for the outside so it would look extra pink. You can do the same; you can use plain buttercream and skip the raspberries; or you can add the raspberries in the beginning, as these recipes instruct, for a pale pink frosting to use on both the inside and the outside of the cake.)",
      "Remove the cake from the freezer. Place one layer on a cake stand or serving plate and spread a thin layer of frosting on top. Top with the second layer (it doesn't matter whether you stack them right side up or upside down as long as you add enough frosting in between each layer to make the cake sit evenly; you shouldn't need to trim the cake layers unless yours came out of the oven very domed), add another layer of frosting, and top with the final layer. My cake looks a little different because I sliced one of my layers in half to get four uneven layers. I'd suggest sticking with the original three even layers.",
      "Next, make a very thin layer of frosting over the cake (this is called a crumb coat). Refrigerate for about 20 minutes. Remove from the refrigerator and add the final thick layer of frosting over the entire cake. To make my design, use an offset spatula to make small smudges all over the surface and sides of the frosting. Top with fresh flowers, fresh fruit, or candles!"

      "Preheat the oven to 350F. Line muffin tins with paper liners and set aside.",
      "Sift the cake flour into a large bowl (or into the bowl of a stand mixer, if you have one). Add sugar, baking powder, and salt. Stir gently to combine. With the mixer on low, add butter cubes a few at a time and beat until you have a sandy, coarse texture.",
      "In another bowl, whisk together egg whites, coconut milk, shredded coconut, and vanilla (and lime juice, if using). Add half of the mixture to the dry ingredients and beat on medium-high speed until well combined, about a minute. Add the remaining wet mixture and then beat until the batter is light and fluffy, about 30 seconds.",
      "Scoop batter evenly into the liners so they're about 2/3 full (I use a quarter cup measuring cup and that's usually about right). Bake for 18 minutes, or until they spring under your fingertips when pressed lightly. Allow to cool in the pans slightly before transferring baked cupcakes to a rack to cool completely.",
      "To make the frosting, add egg whites and sugar into a large bowl (or the bowl of a stand mixer if you have one) and whisk to combine. Set the bowl over a pan of gently simmering water and heat, whisking constantly, until the mixture is hot to the touch and the sugar has dissolved -- about 6 to 8 minutes. If you rub a little bit between your fingers, it shouldn't feel grainy to the touch.",
      "Transfer the bowl to a stand mixer (with a whisk attachment) if you have one, or else set on a towel on your counter, and start whipping. Beat on medium-high speed until the mixture is a fluffy meringue and the bowl is cool to the touch (6 to 8 minutes if using a stand mixer, 10 to 15 if using a hand mixer).",
      "With the mixer on low, start adding butter cubes one at a time until they've all been added to the meringue. Increase the speed back to medium-high and continue beating until butter is fully incorporated, smooth, and fluffy (don't worry if it looks curdled - more beating will bring it together!).",
      "Slowly add the coconut milk, vanilla and salt to the meringue and beat on medium-high speed until the coconut milk is incorporated and the mixture is once again fluffy and smooth. It'll take some time to reconstitute itself, so be patient!",
      "To frost, transfer frosting to a piping bag with a decorative tip (or a ziplock with the corner cut out; or smear some on with a knife) and pipe onto each cupcake. You can store these at room temp for up to 3 days in an air-tight container."

      "Place the rice in a medium-size bowl. Fill the bowl halfway with water, to cover the rice. Gently rub the slender grains through your fingers, without breaking them, to wash off any dust or light foreign objects (like loose husks), which will float to the surface. The water will become cloudy. Drain this water. Repeat three or four times, until the water remains relatively clear; drain. Now fill the bowl halfway with cold water and let it sit at room temperature until the kernels soften, 20 to 30 minutes; drain.",
      "Heat the ghee in a medium-size saucepan over medium-high heat. Sprinkle in the cloves, cardamom pods, cinnamon sticks, and mace. Cook until they sizzle, crackle, and smell aromatic, 15 to 30 seconds. Then add the onion and stir-fry until it is light brown around the edges, 5 to 7 minutes.",
      "Mix in the ginger, garlic, and chiles. Cook, stirring, for about 1 minute. (You don't want the garlic to brown because its nutlike crunch is important to the rice's texture.) Stir in the tomatoes, with their juices, and the sea salt and turmeric. Simmer, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the tomatoes soften, 5 to 7 minutes.",
      "Add the drained rice and toss gently to coat the grains with the tomato sauce. Pour in 1 1/2 cups water, and stir once to incorporate the ingredients. Bring to a boil, still over medium-high heat. Cook until the water has evaporated from the surface and craters are starting to appear in the rice, 5 to 8 minutes. Then (and not until then) stir once to bring the partially cooked layer from the bottom of the pan to the surface. Cover with a tight-fitting lid and reduce the heat to the lowest possible setting. Cook for 8 to 10 minutes (10 minutes for a gas burner). Then turn off the heat and let the pan stand on that burner, undisturbed, for 10 minutes.",
      "Remove the lid, fluff the rice with a fork, sprinkle with cilantro, and serve. (Remove the cloves, cardamom pods, and cinnamon sticks before you serve it, or just remind folks to eat around them.)"

      "Position a rack in the lower third of the oven and preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F. Line the pan with paper liners.",
      "To make the cupcakes, grate the zest of the lemon in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment (or in a mixing bowl if using a handheld mixer). Add the sugar, eggs, and salt. Beat at medium-high speed until the mixture is thickened and lighter in color, about 2 minutes. Or beat with a handheld mixer on medium-high speed for 3 to 4 minutes.",
      "Add the rice and oat flours, baking soda, baking powder, cinnamon, nutmeg, zucchini, and dill and beat on low speed just until blended. Beat in the olive oil. Divide the batter evenly among the cups.",
      "Bake until a toothpick inserted in the center of cupcakes comes out clean and dry, 18 to 20 minutes. Set pan on a rack to cool for a few minutes before tipping cakes out onto the rack to cool completely before icing or storing.",
      "To make the frosting, put the dill into the bowl of a food processor fitted with the steel blade. Add 5 or 6 tablespoons of the powdered sugar and process until the dill is pureed, scraping the sides of the bowl as necessary, and adding a little more sugar as necessary until the mixture is a thick syrupy puree. Grate the zest of the lemon directly into the processor bowl and add the remaining sugar and the butter in chunks. Process until smooth and spreadable. Process until completely smooth and spreadable, scraping down the sides of the bowl as necessary. Add the olive oil and pulse to blend.",
      "Note: I always try to sneak in a little more extra-virgin olive oil-it adds a lovely dimension and complexity to the frosting that ties into the cupcakes-but at some point, too much oil will curdle the frosting. If that happens to you, smooth out the frosting by pulsing in a bit more powdered sugar."

      "PREP 3 BOWLS\r\n\r\nIn a small bowl, mix about 2 tablespoons of the milk with the cornstarch to make a smooth slurry.\r\n\r\nIn a medium bowl, add the salt and room-temperature cream cheese and whip all the bumps out.\r\n\r\nIn a large bowl, make an ice bath (heavy on the ice) and set aside.",
      "COOK\r\n\r\nPour the cream, sugar, corn syrup, and remaining milk into a 4-quart saucepan. Bring to a rolling boil over medium-high heat, set a timer for precisely 4 minutes and boil for exactly 4 minutes-the timing is critical.\r\n\r\nRemove from the heat and gradually whisk in the cornstarch slurry.\r\n\r\nReturn the mixture to a boil over medium-high heat and cook, stirring until the mixture is slightly thickened, about 1 minute. Remove from the heat.",
      "CHILL\r\n\r\nGradually whisk the hot milk mixture into the cream cheese until smooth. Do this a little bit at a time so that you can whip out any lumps of cream cheese.\r\n\r\nPour the mixture into a 1-gallon Ziploc freezer bag, seal, and submerge the bag in the ice bath. Let stand, adding more ice as necessary, until very cold, about 30 minutes.",
      "FREEZE\r\n\r\nCut the corner off the bag, pour the chilled base into the frozen canister of your ice cream machine, press a sheet of parchment paper directly against the surface, and seal with an airtight lid. Freeze in the coldest part of your freezer until firm, at least 4 hours.",
      "HOW TO TELL WHEN YOUR ICE CREAM IS DONE\r\n\r\nThe ice cream is finished at the exact moment when the machine isn't freezing the ice cream anymore; the ice cream will begin to pull away from the sides (about 25 minutes). If you stop too soon, there will be a thin layer of really dense ice cream on the sides of the canister.",
      "SERVE\r\n\r\nWhen you remove the ice cream from the freezer, let it sit and relax for 5 to 10 minutes before you scoop and serve it-it doesn't need to melt, but it does need to thaw slightly. Ideally, serve and eat it while it's quite firm but pliable and you are able to easily roll it into a ball. Once you've scooped it, return any remaining ice cream to the freezer. If the ice cream has melted too much at room temperature, refreezing it will result in an ice cream that is too icy."

Dough should look similar to pizza dough.",

When it's too large to handle, place it on the tablecloth.\r\nIf you are intimidated with this method, just use a rolling pin to stretch the dough as thin as possible without breaking it and then continue to step 5.",
      "4. Preheat oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit.",
      "5. Using your fingers, gently shake and pull the edge of the dough towards you to stretch out the center, until it's even and transparent. Take care not to tear holes in the dough. If you do, pinch them together. It doesn't have to be perfect; it won't be visible when pita is done. If making pita pie, the dough will eventually cover the tablecloth. Trim the thick outer edges and discard.",

      "8. Tightly coil the small individual pita rolls into a swirl. Place into a greased baking dish. For the pita pie, lay one end of the roll into the middle of a greased large round baking pan. Carefully wrap the remainder of the pastry roll around itself to form a snail-shaped pie. Take the second roll and continue where the other roll had ended. (If you don't have a round pan, then don't coil, just cut the roll the length of your rectangular baking sheet and place next to each other).",

Your first goal is to get the liquid to 220 F, and It will get there fairly quickly (a couple minutes at most). NOTE: Be very careful with any splattering, as there are few things you'll ever cook on the stove hotter than making candy. I use a thermometer where the probe is separate from a box-like read-out panel which tells me the temperature. If you don't have something like this, consider wearing gloves, or wrap your hand in a towel when checking or repositioning the probe.",

Remove the rosemary with a slotted spoon, add the liquid pectin and the dried rosemary, and increase the heat so that the liquid slowly climbs to 223 F. This may take a little longer than you might expect, so keep increasing the heat by small increments as needed. It took me an additional 5 - 7 minutes to get from 220 F to 223 F. Once the liquid reaches 223 F, continue to boil the liquid for an additional 3 minutes. The temperature will occasionally go higher, but by adjusting the (gas) heat I was able to manage the temperature very easily. If you have an electric stove, it will be much more difficult and you may need to remove the pot from the stove intermittently.",

The soji should seem to feel lighter as you stir and will darken just a bit and start to smell warm and toasty.

Cook until the mixture looks shiny and some ghee is visible at the bottom of the pan when the mixture is scraped away.

Turn off the heat, cover with the lid ajar, and let sit for 15 minutes. After 15 minutes have passed, uncover carefully ensuring that no water drips into the pot from the condensation on the lid. Give the shiro a few brisk stirs and transfer it into a serving bowl. Garnish with the remaining cardamom, almonds, and pistachios, and serve. Enjoy!"

I'm using a 9 inch Le Creusot casserole dish) place the 6 spoons of brown sugar; add the orange/lemon juice and melt gently until it starts to caramelise. Once it's golden brown and bubbling, gently tilt the casserole around, coating the walls about half-way up with the caramel. Remove from heat, leaving it to harden slightly",

With a handheld mixer, start beating them up on medium-high for a LONG time (about 15-20 minutes), until they've whitened and almost trippled in volume. Add the water and the vanilla and give it another minute with the mixer. In a small bowl, sieve the flour and mix in the baking powder. Separately (I do this in a food processor while I'm whipping the egg yolks/sugar mixture) beat the egg whites until they form stiff peaks. When they're done, you can start assembling the batter; gently fold into the egg yolks mixture, one tablespoon of flour and two of egg white, alternating between them.",

Ideally, you should place a small pot of water on the bottom of the oven-this will result in a fluffier cake. Bake for 40 minutes and DO NOT OPEN THE OVEN mid-way. the cake will colapse if you do. After 35 minutes, test with a toothpick inserted in the middle of the cake-if it comes out clean, no batter sticking to it, it's done. The cake will separate from the sides of the dish slightly-that's normal. if it's baked, turn off the oven but leave the cake in for an additional ten minutes.",

      "Roast the pepper: You can roast the red pepper by any method by which you are accustomed. I like to char mine over an open flame until very black and slightly peeling. You should have a good fan so as not to disturb the occupants of the house. When the weather is agreeable, outside on the grill works too. When the pepper resembles a charred shell, put it into a paper bag and let sweat for a good 10 minutes or for as long as you might need. Before using, remove from the bag, peel away the burnt skin and tear it into half. Remove the seeds and stem, tossing away for compost. I sometimes cut off a few slivers of the meat to put in a salad or omelette before giving the rest up for sauce (I did go to the trouble of charring this and upsetting the nose of my dogs and husband you know?).",
      "In the bowl of a food processor, place the meat of the red pepper along with the mustard, a few shakes cayenne and 1 TB water. Process until smooth adding more",
      "As one suggestion for use (as pictured): Place small spoonful of sauce in a line on a cold plate. Using a sharp knife, slice sashimi grade ahi tuna across the grain into thin slices; squeeze a little lemon juice over. Lay these neatly next to the sauce and crumble some course sea salt, sparingly over the fish. Julienne a few leaves of fresh basil; line the basil up next to the tuna."

      "First, the business of cutting the pineapple: with a large sharp knife, slice off ends. Stand the pineapple up on one of the now flat ends, and carefully slice away the outer skin from the top down, following the curve of the fruit. Rotate and repeat around the entire fruit. Now, lay the pineapple in front of you. With one hand, hold the end closest to you, while with the other carefully make diagonal wedge cuts to slice out the \"eyes\" (brown spots) (see photo 5). Rotate and repeat until you have removed all of the eyes, then slice the pineapple in half lengthwise, through its core. Cut each half into thirds - you should have six long wedges of pineapple. Wrap three tightly in plastic wrap and store for another use. For each of the remaining three wedges, first, slice about a quarter inch strip from the tough core (see photo 4) and discard. Then, slice wedge into 1/4 inch fan shaped pieces (see photo 3).",
      "Place pineapple pieces in a bowl. Pour rum mixture over pineapple and toss to combine; cover bowl with plastic wrap and set aside for 30 minutes, occasionally swirling bowl (gently) to cover pineapple.",
      "Preheat oven to 250 degrees F. Line a large rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Transfer rum macerated pineapple pieces to baking sheet in a single layer (if you eat a few pieces all of them should fit, snugly) and slow roast for 45 minutes, rotating pan and flipping pineapple pieces mid-way through. (Btw, I hope you did not discard what could be a lovely glass of pineapple infused rum, to be enjoyed while your pineapple is roasting, perhaps). Pineapple should dry out considerably, and shrink just a bit.",
      "Remove from pan and if you are making pineapple in advance, pieces can be stored, stacked, in an airtight container in the refrigerator. If you are refrigerating pieces, lay them out on a parchment-lined pan to dry out a bit before using.",

      "Combine flour, sugar and salt on a cool work surface. Place butter, cut into 1/4-inch slices, on top of flour mound. Dip each piece of butter in flour, to coat both sides. Using pointer fingers and thumbs gently flatten each flour coated slice; pieces will break away to flour mound.",
      "Slide both hands, palms facing up, under the edges of the flour mound and bring your hands together, raking floury butter flakes and gently combining pieces by pressing your thumbs down against your other fingers. Repeat until you have mostly fluffy sandy clumps with a few larger flakes.",
      "Sprinkle 1 T of ice-cold water over pile. Gently work mixture together with your hands to combine dough. If dough gets sticky, dip fingers in flour. Add remaining tablespoon of ice-cold water and gather, eventually rolling dough into a smooth ball (be careful not to overwork, or dough will be tough). Wrap ball in a large piece of plastic wrap and flatten into disc (about 1 inch thick and 4 inches across). Fold plastic wrap around edges of disc to seal and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes and up to 1 day.",
      "When ready to use, remove from refrigerator and allow disc to sit at room temperature for about ten minutes before rolling out. Roll out dough (slightly larger than tart pan) and carefully wind around pin while sliding 9-inch metal tart pan (with removable bottom) under. Unwind dough from pin into tart pan, carefully pressing into the bottom and up the sides. You want the dough to come up a bit higher than the rim of the pan. Place in the freezer for 15 minutes.",

      "In a small saucepan, over low to medium heat, whisk eggs, sugar-zest and gradually add juice. Whisk steadily and continuously until mixture thickens, about six minutes. You do not want your mixture to boil. Whisk in gelatin and stir to combine - continue stirring until your mixture is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon and your finger leaves an open trail.",
      "Strain mixture through a sieve into a large glass-measuring cup or bowl, using a wooden spoon or spatula to help get all of your curd through (but not zest). Fold in rum, combining until smooth, and butter, one tablespoon at a time, into warm curd. Cover curd with plastic wrap, making sure that the wrap touches the surface of the curd to prevent skin formation. Refrigerate for 15 minutes until slightly cooled. Curd will thicken and gelatin will set up as it cools. Pour curd into tart crust and carefully layer pineapple pieces. Since the curd will still be quite liquidy, it is a bit like trying to make a pattern with blocks on a waterbed - you don't want to have to move too many pieces once you start! I started on the outside and worked in, making a tight circle of pineapple and then placing pieces in between in the opposite direction.",
