Also, pour a little water in the bottom of the roasting pan and check periodically to make sure it does not dry up completely. I found the drippings in the bottom of the pan burned if I didn't do this.",
      "Note: For the sauce, I use 1C each of cider vinegar, mustard and ketchup as well as 1/2 C brown sugar and 1/2 t cayenne. I use all of the sauce to mix in the meat. I don't think half is enough. If you want more sauce on the side, I would suggest making more."

      "Fennel -- On the same baking sheet, 1/2 we will be baking the salmon and the other half we will be baking the fennel. So add the fennel, lemon and drizzle with olive oil, salt and pepper and lightly toss.",
      "Bake -- In a 425 degree oven on the middle shelf, bake the salmon and the fennel for about 15-20 minutes. This will depend on the thickness of your fennel and salmon, but they take approximately the same time.",
      "The fennel should be lightly brown around the edges and the salmon done and flaky, but still a little moist. The salmon will cook a little more once removed, so don't over cook - 120 internal temp and then remove. You don't want it bright pink and translucent in the middle, but more opaque. The salmon may get done first, so just remove and set on a plate and cover with foil.",
      "Salad -- At this time, the fennel should be done. So, to a large bowl, add the baby spinach and the roasted fennel and squeeze 1/2 of the roasted lemon and add 1/2 of the vinaigrette (or you can go a bit less). You want a little to drizzle over the salmon as well, so dress the salad to your liking. I tend to go light on the dressing where others like a bit more. Just use what you like.",
      "Note: if you like more lemon like me you can squeeze the other half of the lemon. Once roasted it gets very sweet and adds a great flavor, but I always tell people to squeeze 1/2 first. You can always add more, but you can take it away. I prefer to squeeze both half, but that is up to you.",
      "Plating -- Add a nice helping of the fennel spinach salad to the plate and top with one of the roasted salmon fillets. Top with a little of the vinaigrette over the salmon and garnish with the fresh dill (optional).",
      "Now my favorite is to serve this with some roasted potatoes. As you cook the salmon and fennel, you could also do some roasted new potatoes. Guess what ? No pans. Just a baking sheet with no clean up. My type of dinner. And that roasted lemon half if you don't use it on the salmon, you would squeeze that on the potatoes with salt and pepper which would be wonderful. ENJOY!"

Beat on high speed until cool (this takes about 7-9 minutes; however, you can speed up the process by pressing bags of frozen berries or frozen corn around the sides and bottom of the mixing bowl). Reduce the speed to low and add the butter; mix until thoroughly incorporated. Increase the speed to medium high and beat until the frosting is light and fluffy, about another 1-2 minutes.",
      "Add the vanilla and coffee extracts and continue mixing until combined. If the frosting is too soft, put the bowl in the refrigerator to chill slightly, then beat again until it is the proper consistency. If the frosting is too firm, set the bowl over a pot of simmering water and beat with a wooden spoon until it is the proper consistency.",
      "To assemble the cake: Place one cake layer on a serving platter. Trim the top to create a flat surface, and evenly spread about 1 1/4 cups frosting on top. Add the next layer, trim and frost it, then add the third layer. Spread a very thin layer of frosting over the sides and top of the cake and put it in the refrigerator for about 15 minutes to firm up. (This is known as the crumb coating and will help you keep loose cake crumbs under control when you frost the outside of the cake.) Spread the sides and top of the cake with the remaining frosting. Refrigerate it for 15 minutes to firm it up.",
      "Make the chocolate glaze: Place the butter, chocolate, and corn syrup in the top of a double boiler. Using a rubber spatula, stir the mixture until the chocolate and butter are completely melted and smooth.",
      "Remove the pan from the heat and stir the glaze to release excess heat. Drizzle glaze over the cake. Refrigerate the cake about 15 minutes to set the glaze before serving.",
      "Glaze the cake: Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Place your cake on a wire rack over the baking sheet. Slowly pour about 3/4 of a cup of the glaze over the cake. Use a small offset spatula to smooth it out to the edges. Place the cake in the refrigerator for 5 minutes to set the glaze. Remove from the refrigerator and slowly pour the rest of the glaze over the cake. It should run down the sides in thick streams. You should be able to control the size and length of the streams by the pour. Feel free to experiment, and have no fear n plaing around. This is the fun part, and there is no right or wrong way. Garnish with chocolate covered espresso beans. Chill the entire cake for approximately 20 minutes, or until glaze is set, then transfer to a cake plate. Serve at room temperature."

      "Some of the legs may lose the coating on the first side no matter how careful you are, but if you turn them and replace them right on top of the bits that stuck to the grill, the second side will be fine, and that can be the \"presentation\" side.",

      "Make Ahead -- This is why I like this recipe. The Onions can be made ahead; the mustard and honey sauce can be made ahead; and the brats can even be made ahead This will save lots of time if you are having this for a party.",
      "Brats -- Now if pre-cooked, skip this step. If not, I like to cook mine in a in deep saute pan with 1 can of beer and a couple of cups of water (you can use all water if you want), and just simmer on medium for about 15 minutes. Follow directions on the package. I prefer to simmer rather than pan saute or grill. I don't like mine to be browned for this recipe.",
      "Sauerkraut -- Drain well. You don't want any liquid for this. I even set the kraut after I drain it on a paper towel and squeeze to make sure it is nice and dry.",
      "Mustard -- Mix the mustard and the honey and set to the side. One half is used for the brats, and 1/2 for extra dipping. You can use a store bought honey mustard if you want, but I prefer to make mine fresh.",
      "Wraps -- On a cookie sheet either sprayed well with a non-stick spray or I prefer to use parchment paper (no clean up), lay out the crescent rolls from the can. I use a rolling pin just to flatten a little, and to make sure all the seams are pressed together. This is KEY. ;You don't want to use the pre-cut crescent roll triangles.",
      "Use a pizza cutter or a knife and cut from top left corner to bottom right corner and and same on the other side to make 4 large triangles. This is a must to fit around the brat.",
      "NOTE: If you wanted, you could use 2 triangles (needing 2 cans of the crescent rolls) if you prefer your brat enclosed more. Personally, I prefer using one triangle, but you could always add more if necessary.",
      "Filling -- Now on each triangle, I use a pastry brush, but a knife will work fine - add a little of the honey mustard dressing. Then 1/4 cup of the sauerkraut on each triangle, toward the long edged end, and finally the bratwurst. Roll up, just like you would a crescent roll. You can use less kraut if you want, but 1/4 cup works for me. I think it also depends on the size of the bratwurst, and each brand is a bit different.",
      "Bake -- On the top of each roll, make 4-5 thin slices 1/2\" apart with a knife, this will allow the kraut to heat up and cook the crust more evenly. Brush with the egg (which will give it a crisp brown crust) and sprinkle with the caraway seeds if you want. I like the caraway, but it is optional.",
      "Pre-heat the oven to 375, and bake 15-20 minutes until golden brown.",
      "Onions -- As the brats cook, use the same pan you cooked the brats in (liquid thrown out), and melt the butter on medium high. Add the onion and cook until soft, tender and golden, around 10 minutes. Not too brown, just tender and golden. It will take about the same time as it takes to bake the brats. You can always make the onions ahead of time.",
      "Serve -- Plate your wrapped brats with the extra honey mustard as a dip and the sauteed onions.",
      "Beer Cheese Sauce Optional -- Recipe #162043, is a great recipe but I prefer to use a sharp cheddar and a dark or amber. This is a great sauce to go with the brats. ENJOY!"

Shake the skillet now and then so meatballs stay round and brown evenly. Place them on a heated baking pan in a low oven to keep warm.",
      "To make gravy, deglaze the skillet with 1 cup of the stock, letting it simmer for 5 minutes while scraping the bottom of the skillet with a spatula. Strain the gravy into a clean saucepan and add the remaining 1 cup of stock. In a small bowl, mix the flour with 1/4 cup of cold water until smooth. Whisk flour mixture into warm gravy, and let simmer, whisking constantly to prevent lumps, until thickened slightly, about 3-5 minutes. Add the cream and season with salt and pepper.",
      "To serve, arrange the meatballs on a serving platter, pour hot gravy over them, and garnish with parsley. Traditionally served with boiled new potatoes, lingonberry sauce, and lefse. I just put over buttered noodles or cooked rice, and sprinkled with parsley."

Stir it in well. Taste it. Is it not \"hot\" enough? Add some more until it's warm enough for you. If you make it too hot, then you'll be adding more butter.",
      "3. Add maybe 1 Tbsp sugar. This is only to offset the vinegar taste of the pepper sauce. If you can taste \"sweet\" then you added too much. All you are doing here is taking the edge off the vinegar. If you like the vinegar then don't add sugar. Remember, this is your custom made sauce.",

Your flavors and proportions will vary with which pepper sauce you use at the time. If you use a pre-made \"wing\" sauce, realize you will be using much less butter and will really be losing some cost and originality advantage."
