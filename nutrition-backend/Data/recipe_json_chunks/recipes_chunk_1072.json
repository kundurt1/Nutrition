Stir in the cubed butter until completely combined. Set aside to cool slightly while working on the other mousse components.",
      "Whisk the egg yolks in a separate bowl until frothy (about 2 min), and then slowly whisk into the chocolate mixture. If the chocolate mixture is very warm still you will have to temper it by adding a little to the eggs and stirring before adding the rest of the eggs to the chocolate mixture (so it doesn't scramble the eggs).",
      "Add the sugar, vanilla, and cream to the bowl of your mixer and mix slowly starting on low and working your way up to high for about 3-5 minutes, or until stiff peaks just begin to form.",
      "Gently fold the whipped cream into the chocolate mixture and transfer to a piping bag. Pipe into each heart cavity, filling to the top, and use a butter knife or icing spatula to scrape off any extra mousse. Insert a popsicle stick, and transfer the molds to the freezer to set (at least 4 hours or overnight). At this time you will also want to place the raspberries in the fridge to thaw overnight.",
      "To make the raspberry puree, place the thawed raspberries, sugar, and lemon juice in a medium saucepan. Cook the berry mixture on medium low for 10-15 minutes, or until the berries begin to break down.",
      "Pour the berries through a strainer to remove the seeds. Use a spatula to gently press the berries against the strainer to squeeze out all of the juice, and also swipe the spatula along the bottom of the strainer. Transfer the puree to the refrigerator to chill and thicken. Discard the seeds or use them for a homemade jam.",
      "Once the pops are set you can shape them to give them more of TATA's asymmetric look. Remove the mousse pops carefully from the molds, and place them on a baking sheet lined with wax paper. Use a sharp knife to carefully trim down the left side of the heart. Return the pops to the freezer while making the ganache.",
      "Now for the fun part! To make the glaze, place the white chocolate chips in a heat proof bowl and set aside. Place the cream and corn syrup into a second heatproof bowl and microwave for 30 seconds. Pour the hot cream over the chocolate, and allow it to sit for 1-2 minutes before stirring. Continue to heat the chocolate and cream, in the microwave, in 30-second intervals at 50% power, stirring after each set, until the chocolate is fully melted.",
      "Stir in the fruit puree. The white chocolate chips have a slightly yellow tint that will make the ganache look purple, so to bring it back to TATA's signature bright red add a little red candy coloring until it begins to look red again. The color will develop as it sits, so add just a little at a time (too much will make the ganache taste bitter). You can also add a tiny bit of yellow to brighten it up, if needed. Transfer to a glass measuring cup and re heat for another 30 seconds, so that the ganache is easily pourable.",
      "Place the mousse pops on a cooling rack over a rimmed baking sheet, and pour the ganache over them completely covering the tops and sides. Transfer the pops back to the freezer (you can use a toothpick to clean up the edges).",
      "To make TATA's face, place the yellow and dark cocoa candy melts into 2 separate heat proof bowls, and heat them in the microwave in 30 second intervals at 50% power (stirring between each interval until smooth). Use a toothpick dipped in the yellow melts to draw 6 oval shapes onto wax paper for the mouths, and then dip a toothpick into the dark cocoa melts and draw 3 lines each, for the mouth (right in the middle of the yellow), eyebrows, and 2 small circles for the eyes of each mousse pop. Allow the chocolate to set.",
      "Just before serving, add the faces (I find it easiest to transfer using a toothpick), and enjoy! The mousse pops can either be eaten right from the freezer, or set out for about 10 minutes for a softer texture. Cover and store any leftover pops in the freezer.",

      "The trick to this salsa is the chunkier the better! This is not the \"tomato paste with a few peppers\" salsa you get at your local Mazatlan. This is the freshest Pico de Gallo you can imagine. How good it tastes is solely based on your tasting the results each step of the process (the most enjoyable part!).",
      "So, get out your largest cutting boards, your sharpest knifes, small bowls for each ingredient, your grater, one big steal bowl, and a wooden spoon. This can be a fun kids or couple project if you want to include others.",
      "Essentially hand dice everything in their own neat little piles to be placed in their own respective bowls (except for the tomatoes which should be placed in the big bowl). Grate the carrots and cabbage with large holes next.",
      "Open the two 4 oz cans of \"La Victoria\" diced jalapenos three quarters of the way and then drain the juices one at a time into the bowl with the tomatoes. Once drained, dice up SOME of the contents of the cans, but don't use too much. It is easier to get the spiciness you require by tasting with only the tomatoes up front. As soon as you can sense a light aftertaste/tangyness of jalapenos, you are there. I like mine a bit on the hot side and typically dice about two solid tea spoons of actual jalapenos. I only use one and a half cans of the juice. When this step is complete, pile in the onions, carrots, cilantro, and cabbage. Squeeze in some lime juice, add some salt to taste, and it is finished!",
      "This salsa is a simple/healthy recipe, but so delicious. If invited to a dinner party, I will often drop by our local market and grab all of the ingredients (no bags necessary), whip up a jar and bring it along with blue chips. People can taste the difference right away between store bought and fresh homemade organic salsa.",

That being said, the recipe does include some Thai bird chilies, and I would recommend adding anywhere from 5 - 10 depending on how spicy you'd like it. However, that being said, it's supposed to be a mild dish. This recipe is simple to make, it doesn't take too many ingredients, and the flavors are well rounded and tasty.

      "* THE STUFF GROWS: After adding the Marshmallow Creme and butter to the hot milk/sugar solution, the volume will expand to almost twice the original volume. So use a sufficiently large sauce pan (4 quart or better). As the boil continues, the volume will begin to contract. Stirring is important to help distribute the heat throughout the mixture and prevent scorching.",
      "Remember, this recipe calls for two [2] sauce pans -- one to boil and one to mix.",
      "* YOU CAN SUBSTITUTE: If you don't have access to milk chocolate chips then you may use 24 ounces of semisweet chocolate chips - though it has a stronger chocolate taste. Two large Hershey bars (7 ounces each) will more than substitute for the milk chocolate chips. You can also use 24 ounces of white Chips for an excellent Vanilla Fudge. Don't be shy about substituting mini-marshmallows for the Marshmallow Creme.",
      "* MAKE HALF A BATCH: You may cut the recipe in half (using exactly 1/2 the amount of everything) but the boil time must be reduced to [5] full minutes by the clock. I would also recommend a 9\" x 9\" pan. You can also substitute 5 ounces of evaporated milk (one small can) for 6 ounce (half a large can).",
      "* PERSEVERE: This is a much more liquid mix (more 'soupy') than other fudge recipes and you might get discouraged midway. Keep going. I've nearly given up several times only to have it set extremely well once cast.",
      "* NERVOUS NELLY: If you're afraid this won't set (and it will) or if you just want a more firm fudge then bring the milk and sugar to a rolling boil for a full minute before adding the marshmallow. During the second boil (after the marshmallows are dissolved) go for 9 or 10 minutes. This will set very quickly and be a much firmer fudge.",
      "* DON'T PANIC: If you use a candy thermometer (and this recipes *does not call for a candy thermometer*) the temperature will not reach the normal 232-236\u00b0F found in other fudge recipes. It will attain something around 220-224\u00b0F Don't panic! This is a whole different way of making fudge. The mixture will set once cast.",
      "* STORAGE: Fudge will keep for up to two weeks at room temperature. You'll need to store it wrapped in waxed paper (cut it up into reasonable segments) and in an airtight container. Fudge will keep frozen for up to six months. When freezing fudge you'll need to wrap in waxed paper, store in a double-airtight container. I use double freezer Baggies. Thaw fudge at room temperature in its air-tight container -- it will take most of one day.",
      "* SOFTNESS: This produces a medium-hard fudge. If you prefer a softer fudge (or if the weather is especially dry on the day you make the fudge -- like snowing or you live in the desert) then boil for only [7] minutes instead of the recommended [8] minutes. Conversely, if you'd like a firmer fudge (or if the weather is especially damp on the day you make fudge) then boil for [9] minutes instead of the recommended [8] minutes."

When ready to use break off a selected piece and manipulate it in your hands until it is soft and flexible again. If it's too soft, you can always fold in a little bit of powdered sugar to help it set up a bit more. Once you have a flexible dough you can roll it out to make the white chocolate pumpkins shown in the images.",

      "After reading the comments I tried some things. The egg noodles as well as penne pasta worked really well. The type of pasta I used determined the amount of sauce that was left obviously. Just experiment to see what works for you. Using egg noodles or penne seriously cuts the time on this way back. Using frozen carrot/broccoli blends works great too, to cut back on time. Both of those alterations didn't change much, though the frozen veggies changed a little bit of the \"fresh\" taste in my opinion. If you're doing a day long OAMC marathon, these minor changes might make a big difference. As for the sauce, I think the elevation and dryness of the flour affect the sauce, so does oven temperature Like one reviewer said the sauce thickens as it stands."
