Weight the shell with pie weights or dried beans, and bake until the edges begin to brown, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove paper and weights; continue baking until golden brown, 7 to 10 minutes more. Let cool.",

Gradually add 1 cups cold water, and bring to a boil again, whisking constantly, about 4 minutes.",
      "Remove the pan from heat. Temper 5 egg yolks by beating a small amount of hot mixture into the yolks before adding them to pan. You do not want them to scramble/curdle. You just want to heat the beaten yolks but keep them in a creamy, liquid form. Cook over low heat for 5 minutes.",

Then open the spring form pan of pie filling and place on top of the powdered sugar crust. A layer of lemon cake goes on top of that. Then place the second pie filling layer on top of that. You want to end up with a layer of cake on the very top, and the meringue topping will sit on that top layer of cake.",

Gradually add in the salt and extra-fine sugar, but very very slowly, and gradually turn up the speed of the mixer. You want the egg white to beat till they form soft shiny frothy peaks, but not so stiff that they aren't flexible enough to swirl. Add the Vanilla at the very last moment. With a rubber spatula, swirl the beaten meringue into a 9-inch spring form pan, covering the entire perimeter of the pan and bake for 6 minutes or until lightly brown.",

      "Method:In a medium-sized mixing bowl, combine all of the ingredients, and mix until the dough starts to leave the sides of the bowl. Transfer the dough to a lightly greased or floured surface, and knead it for 6 to 8 minutes, or until it's smooth and shiny.",
      "Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl or rising bucket, turn to coat, cover the container with plastic wrap, and let the dough rise till it's doubled in bulk, about 90 minutes.",
      "To make stand-alone rolls, divide the dough into 16 equal pieces. If you want to make soft-sided, pull-apart rolls, divide the dough into 15 pieces. This isn't as challenging as it sounds: first, divide the dough into three equal pieces (about 375g, 14 ounces, each). Pinch off one piece, about the size of a racquetball or handball (75g, 2 3/4 ounces), off each of the three pieces, setting the pinched-off pieces aside; then simply divide what's left of the three pieces into four pieces each. Presto! Fifteen balls of dough. Gently roll the dough balls under your cupped fingers till they're nice and round. Place the 16 dough balls onto a parchment-lined or lightly greased baking sheet or sheets, leaving about 2 inches between them. Or place the 15 dough balls into a lightly greased 9 x 13-inch pan, spacing them evenly in five rolls of three balls each. Cover the pan(s) with a proof cover or lightly greased plastic wrap, and allow the rolls to rise for about 2 hours, till they're quite puffy; the rolls in the 9 x 13-inch pan should be touching (or almost touching) one another. Baking: Bake the rolls in a preheated 350\u00b0F oven for 20 to 25 minutes, till they're golden brown. Remove them from the oven, carefully turn them out of the pan -- the pull-apart rolls will come out all in one piece -- and brush them with melted butter, if desired. Serve warm or at room temperature. Yield: 15 or 16 rolls."

Add about 1/3 of the flour mixture and mix until combined. Add a second third of the flour mixture and again, mix until combined. Switch to the dough hook and add the remaining flour mixture. Knead with the hook until all that flour is incorporated. Now start adding flour in 1 Tbsp. increments, until the dough comes together, clears the bottom of the bowl and is becoming smooth. Knead on medium for about 2 minutes more. The dough should be smooth and but still a bit moist (but not sticky).",

Using a sharp knife or a bench scraper, cut the dough into 1/2-inch wide strips from top to bottom. Repeat cutting 1/2-inch strips from side to side, so you end up with small chunks of dough. Gather up the dough bits and cut some more, from different directions, until it is in small chunks and evenly mixed with cinnamon/apples/dough etc.",

With each slice, roughly pat into a disc, about the size of your palm (use some additional flour, as needed, if your dough is sticky). Place the dough discs onto a parchment lined or floured baking sheet, leaving a couple of inches of room around each. Repeat with all 12 dough pieces. Cover with plastic wrap that has been sprayed on the under-side with baking spray and set-aside to rise until doubled again, about 30-45 minutes.",

In a small saucepan, bring the water and white granulated sugar to a boil over high heat then reduce heat to medium and simmer for 1 minute. Add this mixture to the bowl with the icing sugar and whisk until all the sugar and has been incorporated and the mixture is smooth. Set aside.",

Fry each donut until deep golden on the underside (1 1/2 - 2 minutes), flip over and fry the other side. (*time and temperature may need to vary. Watch closely the first few to determine timing.

      "If the filets still have the skin on, it needs to be removed with a very sharp fileting knife -- it's easiest to do this with the skin side down on the cutting board. About three inches from the small end of the fish, pierce the knife through the filet near the skin and with the knife blade aimed toward the small end of the filet. Then (keeping the knife close to the skin and while holding the large end in place) slowly run the knife toward the rear of the fish. Once this is done, hold the freed end of the skin with your fingers and filet off the skin in the opposite direction (still with the skin side down.) You can trim off any little pieces of skin (after the filet has been flipped skin side up) which remain attached once the bulk of the skin has been released from the filet.",
      "Wipe the filets completely dry with paper towels and set them aside on a sheet of either wax paper or parchment paper. Mix the salt in with the flour and then pour the blend on to a plate or platter and \"dust\" each filet in it until it is completely coated. Shake off any excess flour and lay the fish back on the wax paper. Allow the filets to rest for 30 minutes (the flour coating seals in the juices and prevents the corn flake coating from falling off or getting mushy.).",
      "Preheat the oven to 375-degrees F.",
      "In a shallow, long dish (a small casserole dish is good), break in the eggs and whisk them for a few seconds and then add in the milk and continue to whisk until it is well-blended.",
      "Dry the parsley sprigs with paper towels until all excess moisture is removed and then add them to the cornflakes. Pulse the cornflake mix a few times in a food processor until the largest flakes are smaller in diameter than a pencil eraser. (You could crush the flakes by hand and chop the parsley separately, adding it in with the cornflakes after the fact.) Pour the cornflake blend out on a large plate or platter.",
      "Spray a casserole dish (which is at least as long as the filets) with the cooking spray.",
      "Handle the filets one at a time. Dip the first one in the egg blend, coating it entirely, and then hold it over the dish to allow any excess liquid to drain off. Then lay the filet across the cornflake blend and allow it to get coated. Flip it over to coat the second side and then transfer it to the sprayed casserole dish. Repeat this process with the second filet.",
      "On the middle oven rack, bake the fish for 25 minutes if the filets are large ones, (e.g., 10-12 inches long -- if your filets are smaller, cut the time back to 20 minutes and check them for doneness prior to serving. If you are using catfish filets then you'll note that they are very thick and may require up to 35-40 minutes baking time.).",
      "After removing the filets from the oven, check for doneness by cutting into the thick end of the fish with a small knife -- the fish should be white, flakey, and juicy.",
      "Prior to serving, dot each filet with butter and allow it to melt which should take about three minutes. Use one or more large spatulas to keep the filet in one piece when plating it. Only the top of the filet (the presentation side) will have the crunchy coating but if you want both sides to be crunchy then you'll need to use a wire rack in the bottom of your baking dish for the filets to lie on. If you use a wire rack, be sure that it is sprayed with cooking spray prior to baking the fish.",

Whisking constantly, gradually add broths; bring to boil, skimming off any foam that forms on surface. Reduce heat to medium-low and add bay leaf, thyme, and peppercorns; simmer, stirring occasionally, until thickened and reduced to 3 cups, 20 to 25 minutes.",

The finished gravy can be frozen. To thaw either a single or double recipe, place the gravy and 1 tablespoon of water in a saucepan over low heat and bring slowly to a simmer. The gravy may appear broken or curdled as it thaws, but a vigorous whisking will recombine it."

And, I had to cook the pie for about an hour before a toothpick test revealed the moist toothpick. As the pie cools, it will set more so don't be alarmed if the center jiggles a little.
