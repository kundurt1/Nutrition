      "Choose a piece of wood that is the length and texture you would like for your frame.",
      "Using a mitre box, cut the one or two frame template pieces exactly to size.",

      "Using a whisk, lighten the flour by incorporating a little air.",
      "Spread a 2-inch thick layer of flour on top of a large sheet pan (or directly on the work surface, if the frame you are making requires more space).",
      "The amount of flour required will depend on the size of the chocolate frame.",
      "Press each piece of the frame template into the flour, immersing it completely and using even pressure, then carefully and delicately lift it out.",
      "Place the bittersweet chocolate in a piping bag with no tip.",
      "Placing the tip of the piping bag as close as possible to the flour/relief, carefully fill the space with chocolate and allow it to set for about 30 minutes.",
      "When the chocolate has set, lift it from the flour.",
      "If you would like an antique look, leave the flour on the chocolate piece, otherwise, clean it off using a strong bristled pastry brush or nailbrush.",
      "Please note: It is better to place the melted chocolate in a piping bag and pipe it into the flour.",
      "If you pour the chocolate from a spouted container, the weight of the chocolate as it falls can damage the delicate flour mold.",

      "Chocolate is tempered so that after it has been melted, it retains its gloss and hardens again without becoming chalky and white (that happens when the molecules of fat separate and form on top of the chocolate).",
      "There are a variety of ways to temper.",
      "One of the easiest ways to temper chocolate is to chop it into small pieces and then place it in the microwave for 30 seconds at a time on high power until most of the chocolate is melted.",
      "Be very careful not to overheat it.",
      "(The temperature of dark chocolate should be between 88 and 90 degrees F, slightly warmer than your bottom lip.",
      "It will retain its shape even when mostly melted.",
      "White and milk chocolates melt at a temperature approximately 2 degrees F less because of the amount of lactose they contain.)",
      "Any remaining lumps will melt in the chocolate's residual heat.",
      "Use an immersion blender or whisk to break up the lumps.",
      "Usually, chocolate begins to set, or crystallize, along the side of the bowl.",
      "As it sets, mix those crystals into the melted chocolate to temper it.",
      "A glass bowl retains heat well and keeps the chocolate tempered longer.",
      "Another way to temper chocolate is called seeding.",
      "In this method, add small pieces of unmelted chocolate to melted chocolate.",
      "The amount of unmelted chocolate to be added depends on the temperature of the melted chocolate, but is usually 1/4 of the total amount.",
      "It is easiest to use an immersion blender for this, or a whisk.",
      "The classic way to temper chocolate is called tabliering.",
      "Two thirds of the melted chocolate is poured onto a marble or another cold work surface.",
      "The chocolate is spread out and worked with a spatula until its temperature is approximately 81 degrees F. At this stage, it is thick and begins to set.",
      "This tempered chocolate is then added to the remaining non-tempered chocolate and mixed thoroughly until the mass has a completely uniform temperature.",
      "If the temperature is still too high, part of the chocolate is worked further on the cold surface until the correct temperature is reached.",
      "This is a lot of work, requires a lot of room, and makes a big mess.",
      "A simple method of checking tempering, is to apply a small quantity of chocolate to a piece of paper or to the point of a knife.",
      "If the chocolate has been correctly tempered, it will harden evenly and show a good gloss within a few minutes."

      "Loosely cover the finished dumplings with a dry kitchen towel or plastic wrap as you form and fill wrappers from the remaining dough.",
      "While these dumplings can be prepared in advance and frozen like the other dumplings in this chapter, they are at their very best when steamed as soon as they are made.",
      "Freeze them on the baking sheet until hard (about 1 hour), transfer them to a zip-top plastic bag, pressing out excess air before sealing, and keep them frozen for up to 1 month; partially thaw, using your finger to smooth over any cracks that may have formed during freezing, before steaming.",
      "To cook the dumplings, steam them over boiling water (see steaming guidelines on page 17) for 6 to 8 minutes.",
      "The dumplings should have puffed up and become somewhat translucent.",

      "Carefully slurp out the hot soup inside or pour it into the spoon and sip it from there.",
      "Finish off the dumpling by eating it straight or dunking it first in the dipping sauce; to be more graceful, spoon a bit of sauce onto the dumpling or into the hole."
