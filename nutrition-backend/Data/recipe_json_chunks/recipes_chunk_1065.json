While most recipes will tell you to use lukewarm water when making yeast dough, I find that by the time you take hot water, put it into a measuring cup and then into a food processor, it has cooled significantly. I always use water that is almost too hot to the touch, and have always had great luck with this dough. Let sit while you measure out the dry ingredients.",
      "After 2-3 minutes you will see small bubbles forming in the liquid in the food processor, which indicates that your yeast is working. Dump in the dry ingredients and turn on the food processor. The machine will go all the work, including the kneading. After about a minute the dough should form into a ball going around in your food processor. Open the machine and take a look. If you think the dough is too wet, you can add a bit a flour, but know that too wet is better than too dry, and the dough will loose some of its stickiness as it rises.",
      "Place about a tablespoon of olive oil in a large bowl. Take the dough out of the food processor (putting a little olive oil on your hands will keep it from sticking) and form it into a ball. Place in the bowl and turn to lightly coat with the olive oil. Cover with a clean kitchen towel and let dough rise in a warm, draft free place for about an hour or until doubled in size, before rolling out and baking. For a crust with a perfect pizzeria taste and texture, I recommend baking on a pizza stone in a very hot oven (500 - 550\u00b0F for about 10 -12 minutes."

      "Movita Boucoup recommends using at least two, 1/2 pound of each seafood selection in addition to the white fish. She strongly recommends scallops and lobster. Don't use any fish with a dominant flavour such as salmon, sardines, clams, etc.",
      "Water is traditionally used in chowders such as this and will taste just fine if you opt for that instead of broth. If using broth, it is recommended using a sodium reduced variety. If you're using canned and don't have enough, you can make up the difference with water. The chicken broth adds just a bit of richness to the chowder.",
      "Chowder is best on the second day, so when entertaining, make it the day before.",
      "To rewarm, put the pot on low and allow 45 minutes it to heat through. Do not allow the chowder to boil; low heat is key.",
      "You will notice that the spices seem to sit on top of the chowder. When you serve, give a little stir and then scoop; just the right amount of spice will come up with the ladle."

      "Combine all of the ingredients in a large mixing bowl, or a large (6-quart), food-safe plastic bucket. For first-timers, \"lukewarm\" means about 105\u00b0F, but don't stress over getting the temperatures exact here. Comfortably warm is fine; \"OUCH, that's hot!\" is not. Yeast is a living thing; treat it nicely.",
      "Mix and stir everything together to make a very sticky, rough dough. If you have a stand mixer, beat at medium speed with the beater blade for 30 to 60 seconds. If you don't have a mixer, just stir-stir-stir with a big spoon or dough whisk until everything is combined.",
      "Next, you're going to let the dough rise. If you've made the dough in a plastic bucket, you're all set - just let it stay there, covering the bucket with a lid or plastic wrap; a shower cap actually works well here. If you've made the dough in a bowl that's not at least 6-quart capacity, transfer it to a large bowl; it's going to rise a lot. There's no need to grease the bowl, though you can if you like; it makes it a bit easier to get the dough out when it's time to bake bread.",
      "Cover the bowl or bucket, and let the dough rise at room temperature for 2 hours. Then refrigerate it for at least 2 hours, or for up to about 7 days. (If you're pressed for time, skip the room-temperature rise, and stick it right into the fridge). The longer you keep it in the fridge, the tangier it'll get; if you chill it for 7 days, it will taste like sourdough. Over the course of the first day or so, it'll rise, then fall. That's OK; that's what it's supposed to do.",
      "When you're ready to make bread, sprinkle the top of the dough with flour; this will make it easier to grab a hunk. Grease your hands, and pull off about 1/4 to 1/3 of the dough - a 14-ounce to 19-ounce piece, if you have a scale. It'll be about the size of a softball, or a large grapefruit.",
      "Plop the sticky dough onto a floured work surface, and round it into a ball, or a longer log. Don't fuss around trying to make it perfect; just do the best you can.",
      "Place the loaf on a piece of parchment (if you're going to use a baking stone); or onto a lightly greased oCHAT WITH A BAKERr parchment-lined baking sheet. Sift a light coating of flour over the top; this will help keep the bread moist as it rests before baking.",
      "Let the loaf warm to room temperature and rise; this should take about 60 minutes (or longer, up to a couple of hours, if your house is cool). It won't appear to rise upwards that much; rather, it'll seem to settle and expand. Preheat your oven to 450\u00b0F while the loaf rests. If you're using a baking stone, position it on a middle rack while the oven preheats. Place a shallow metal or cast iron pan (not glass, Pyrex, or ceramic) on the lowest oven rack, and have 1 cup of hot water ready to go.",
      "When you're ready to bake, take a sharp knife and slash the bread 2 or 3 times, making a cut about 1/2\" deep. The bread may deflate a bit; that's OK, it'll pick right up in the hot oven.",
      "Place the bread in the oven - onto the baking stone, if you're using one, or simply onto a middle rack, if it's on a pan - and carefully pour the 1 cup hot water into the shallow pan on the rack beneath. It'll bubble and steam; close the oven door quickly.",
      "Bake the bread for 25 to 35 minutes, until it's a deep, golden brown.",
      "Remove the bread from the oven, and cool it on a rack. Store leftover bread in a plastic bag at room temperature.",
      "TIPS.",
      "The flour/liquid ratio is important in this recipe. If you measure flour by sprinkling it into your measuring cup, then gently sweeping off the excess, use 7 1/2 cups. If you measure flour by dipping your cup into the canister, then sweeping off the excess, use 6 1/2 cups. Most accurate of all (and guaranteed to give you the best results), if you measure flour by weight, use 32 ounces. Using the same ratio/measuring, you can make a half-recipe if you prefer. While it's great to have dough on hand, it's fine to make less.",
      "Want to try this with whole wheat flour? You can absolutely make up to half of the total flour whole wheat. Add an additional 2 teaspoons water per cup of whole wheat flour to prevent the dough from being too dry.",
      "Would it be better to use bread flour here? Bread flour has more gluten-forming protein, so if you choose to use it in this recipe, the crust will be a bit thicker and you won't get quite the same open-holed structure as with all-purpose. We really prefer the texture of both crust and crumb when all-purpose flour is used. If you do use bread flour, increase the water by about 2 teaspoons per cup of flour to make the requisite sticky dough."

She only use one cup of pumpkin for 4 pks of cream cheese, so the pumpkin falvor isn't very bold. Also she found this needed more baking time. She put it in a 9\" pan and it rose so tall and cracked on the edges even before it was done baking, and it cracked as it cooled as well. I have baked many cheesecakes and have found that recipes using 4 pks of cream cheese bake better in a 10\" pan. If she make this one again that's what she will do.

When the butter mixture is first added to the bread, if you taste it at this point it might seem salty (because it is sitting right on the surface of the bread) but remember that the liquid and butter soaks into the bread and redistributes evenly. Also, this recipe, being from the 1950s, is specifically for cooking *inside* the turkey, which a lot of people no longer do, and again the salt will redistribute from the juices in the meat. If you use a crockpot for cooking your stuffing, I'd recommend reducing the amount of salt.",

I let the oil heat up and test it with a drop of water; if the water shoots back I know the oil is hot enough. If you aren't comfortable with this method you want the oil to stay around 360 degrees. When the oil is hot enough drop fries inches Depending on the thickness of your fry and your temperature control your fries will take anywhere from 10-20 minutes. You want your fries to have a deep golden brown. Keep a careful eye on them and flip if necessary.",

Then place half of the chicken, place mostly in the center, making sure that you are able to fold in the sides. Traditionally, fries are to be placed on top of chicken WITHOUT drying off the oil; however this is entirely up to you. Place fries on top of chicken and top with tomatoes, lettuce, and red onions. Serve with extra tzatziki sauce on the side for dipping."

Do not stir or jar the mixture as butter is added or as the mixture cools. When the mixture has cooled to 110\u00b0F, beat the mixture until it is very thick and loses some of its gloss. Use an electric mixer on low speed for about 8 minutes or beat vigorously with wooden spoon. Stir in nuts. Pour immediately into buttered 9-inch square pan.

Saute until almost tender, about 2 minutes. Add rice and stir 1 minute. Add vermouth. Simmer until liquid is absorbed, about 1 minute. Add 3 cups chicken broth, 1 cups at a time, simmering until almost absorbed before next addition and stirring often. Continue cooking until rice is just tender and risotto is creamy, adding more broth if dry and stirring often, about 18 minutes. Mix in green tops and 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese. Season risotto to taste with salt and pepper. Serve, passing additional grated cheese separately."
