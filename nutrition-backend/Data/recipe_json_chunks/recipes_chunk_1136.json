      "This sauce is really quick and only takes about 5 minutes to make once everything is prepared!",
      "White mushrooms are fine to use if you don't have Portabelo and you can chop them or slice them - whatever you prefer.",
      "Put the oil or butter in a medium sized fry pan with the mushrooms and cook them on a medium heat until they start to soften slightly. Add 3/4 can of evaporated milk and the tablespoon of balsamic vinegar and keep it at a medium heat.",
      "While the mushrooms are cooking in the milk (this won't take long!) quickly mix a little of the milk with the cornflour to form a paste. Add this to the sauce and keep stirring and it will start to thicken. Don't be afraid to bring it to the boil, it won't go funny.",
      "This is where it is up to you how thick you want the sauce! If it becomes too thick just add more Evaporated Milk till you get the desired consistency. If it is not thick enough just make up some more cornflour paste and add it a little at a time until it is just right. You really can't fail to get it the way you want. The best advice I can give is don't have the pan too hot and make sure you keep stirring!",
      "Also taste it before you add any salt and pepper as the Balsamic gives it such a nice flavour you don't want to overpower the sauce with too much salt and pepper. If it doesn't have enough flavour, add another dash of Balsamic Vinegar. It really is that simple!",
      "Pour it over steak and chips or any meat that takes your fancy! Or you can cook up some cubed chicken breast and add them to the sauce and serve with mashed potatoes and greens for a healthy delicious meal! This recipe can easily be doubled.",
      "One tip to give it your sauce more flavour is after you have cooked your steaks use the same pan and leave the juice. It saves on washing and adds that richness. Get saucy!"

      "To serve: Cut each potato in half across its equator and set each half, cut-side down on a plate so that it looks like a small mountain. Cut a slit in the top of each potato half and squeeze the sides gently forcing some of the potato to \"erupt\" from the top. Ladle 1 cup of the stew over each potato to resemble flowing lava; serve immediately.",
      "Tip: We know there's nothing new about microwave-baked potatoes, but the technique in this recipe is a little different and gives much fluffier results. The problem with microwaving baking potatoes is that microwave ovens don't really bake - they steam - so the potatoes come out damp and dense instead of light and fluffy. You can quickly and easily get the best of both worlds by simultaneously preheating a conventional oven while the potatoes start cooking in a microwave oven. Then, when both the potatoes and the oven are hot, you place the spuds in the conventional oven, and they finish baking in about 20 minutes. The results are identical to oven-baking, but cooked in about half the time."

Some people add their oatmeal to the water after it begins to boil, but I find that adding the oatmeal at the same time, before it begins to boil, actually gives the oatmeal a very smooth, rich flavor. Once you boil the oatmeal for about fifteen minutes and it boils down into a porridge, add a fruit of your choice. Great fruits to add are strawberries, blueberries, apples, or bananas while it's still warm so that it cooks into the oatmeal. You may also add golden raisins and/or almonds. This adds a little crunchy texture to it. Other things that you can add to your oatmeal are granola and flax seeds or wheat germ. Again, that adds somewhat of a nutty taste to it and adds a little bit of texture."

      "When you think it is nearly done, thrust a twig or wooden skewer (often a clean broom straw, now a cake tester) into it down to the bottom. If the stick comes out clean and dry, the cake is almost baked. When quite done, it will shrink from the sides of the pan and cease making a noise. Then withdraw the coals (if baked in a Dutch oven, coals were put on top of the oven in an effort to keep heat even), take off the lid and let the cake remain in the oven to cool gradually.",
      "You may ice it either warm or cold. Before you put the icing on a large cake, dredge the cake all over with flour, and then wipe the flour off. This will make the icing stick on better.",
      "If you have sufficient time, the appearance of the cake will be much improved by icing it twice. Put on the first icing soon after the cake is taken out of the oven, and the second the next day when the first is perfectly dry. While the last icing is moist, ornament it with colored sugar-sand or nonpareils."

Cut into 8 wedges. Place 1 1/2 teaspoons filling across the WIDEST part of each wedge, then roll each up toward the point.",

      "While you do the mussels , your other half can make the herb butter . Make sure your butter is about room temperature , mix in the parsley , the garlic and the shallots. also add a pinch of salt and some pepper here. (although salt can be omitted since the mussels contain some seawater still , but i use a bit of salt). Stir the whole mixture up , and let it cool in the fridge a bit so the butter is a bit harder and easier to use later on. now go help your partner cut open the mussels :).",
      "Preheat your oven at 400\u00b0F.",
      "When all the mussels are open and face up on the tray put about half a teaspoon of your herb butter on each mussel . Gently put the tray ion the oven . cooking should take only a few minutes (keep watching it ), they are done when they've all bubbled for a minute and the onions/shallots start getting some color (they should look golden brown at a glance ).",
      "Take the whole tray out and place on a fireproof holder in the middle of the table , let people pick them up one by one as they eat . Don't forget to use a piece of baguette to dip in the juice thats in each muscle , that's the best part :).",

    "directions": [
      "To prepare 1 cup of Simple Berry Jam in advance, add the juice of 1 medium lemon or the juice of half an orange to a medium saucepan. It adds a nice citrusy flavor to the jam. Place a couple of small plates in the freezer. Wash, hull and halve 1 POUND OF FRESH STRAWBERRIES. Add to saucepan. Add 1 CUP OF SUGAR to the saucepan. Stir together over medium heat, boil for 20-25 minutes, until thickened. To check if the jam is set, remove one chilled plate from the freezer and spoon a small dab of the mixture onto it. Give the jam about 30 seconds, and push it with your finger. If it wrinkles, its set and done; if it moves about on the plate, it needs to be boiled a bit longer before you test it on the other plate. You'll also know the jam is done when it reaches 210*F/100*C on a candy thermometer. When the jam is set and done, remove it from the heat and stir in 1 TABLESPOON OF COLD SALTED BUTTER CUT INTO SMALL PIECES. Skim off any foam from the surface with a metal spoon, then pour the jam into clean heat-safe containers or jars. The jam will keep in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks. VARIATIONS: For Raspberry Jam: Decrease the amount of raspberries to 2 cups and add 1 tablespoon of strained fresh orange juice and 1 tablespoon of finely grated orange zest to the berries when stirring them with the sugar. Do the same for Blackberry Jam, but simply increase the amount of sugar to 1 1/2 cups.",
      "To make the CRUST: Position a rack in the center of the oven. Preheat the oven to 450*F. Grease a 9-inch springform pan. In a medium bowl, mix together the cracker crumbs, butter, sugar, nuts, vanilla and salt. Press the mixture into the bottom of the pan, using your hands or the flat bottom of a small measuring cup to compress the crust. Put the pan in the freezer.",
      "To make the FILLING and TOPPING: In a large bowl using a hand held mixer (I find this works better for the job, rather than a stand mixer), beat the cream cheese, sugar, flour, lemon zest and orange zest on medium speed for 3-5 minutes, stopping the mixer and scraping down the sides of the bowl and the beaters to make sure there's no lumpy cream cheese in sight. With the mixer on its lowest speed, add the eggs, egg yolks and vanilla all at once, mixing until smooth and the eggs are well incorporated. Mix in the sour cream until just incorporated.",
      "Remove the crust from the freezer, put on a rimmed baking sheet and wrap the sides of the pan with aluminum foil. Pour the filling into the prepared pan and put the pan on a baking sheet. Bake for 17-20 minutes, until the top is puffed.",
      "Lower the oven temperature to 225*F and bake until the cake is mostly firm but still slightly wobbly in the center, 45 minutes to 1 hour more. (If the cheesecake is not done after 45 minutes, check it every 5 minutes or so until it is.) Once the cheesecake is done, remove it from the oven and allow to cool to room temperature in the pan. Cover and refrigerate it for 8 HOURS before topping.",
      "To make JAM TOPPING: In a small saucepan over medium heat, combine the jam with 1 teaspoon water until it is pourable. Let it cool to room temperature and pour over the cheesecake. Return the cheesecake to the refrigerator until the jam topping is set before serving and topping with the fresh berries. Do not place the fresh berries on top longer than a day in advance of serving."

Process in pulses until no bits of butter are visible; the dough should not quite be clumping or coming together. Drizzle the Orangecello or orange juice over the mixture. Process using 10 to 15 one-second pulses; stop and stir to scrape up and incorporate the mixture on the bottom as necessary. Stop processing as soon as the mixture begins to come together.",
