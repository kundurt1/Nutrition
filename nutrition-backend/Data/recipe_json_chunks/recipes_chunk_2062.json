      "You can substitute potato water (leftover from boiling potatoes) for the water or beer, which will make the dough even softer.",
      "The milk provides some tenderness and color, but if you prefer a leaner bread you can replace it with an equal amount of water or potato water.",

      "If you do so, increase the amount of water by about 1 tablespoon (0.5 oz / 14 g) for every 7 tablespoons (1 oz / 28.5 g) of whole grain flour you use.",
      "If you would like to avoid the air pockets caused by the melting cheese, you can knead cubed cheese into the dough after the overnight rise, just before shaping, rather than rolling it up in the dough.",
