If you like a thinner frosting, add in a little milk (start with 1 teaspoon) and slowly increase until you reach the desired consistency.

      "The first step is just like preparing any steak. You bring in your steak out of the refrigerator, onto the counter, letting it bloom for about half an hour. Then open it out the package, dry your steak off, get it all prepped for that delicious steak seasoning-Chicago Steak seasoning, of course. Put a nice thick crust of steak seasoning on top there. I like to get right in there and just press it right into the meat. Flip your steaks over-nice thick coating- press it into your meat. Once weare all coated up grab yourself a baking sheet and cooling rack, something to use to cool cookies on your counter. Drop it in there. Take your steaks, place them on there. What thatas going to do is itas going to allow the heat to come down, hit the tray and get right underneath and cook it evenly throughout. The way a broiler works is it boils the heat down from the top of your oven. Thatas why we use the cookie rack to lift the meat up just a little bit so it cooks it even throughout. So, what Iave done is Iave started my broiler just to heat that oven up just a little bit. Heat it up for 4 or 5 minutes is all you need. Oven open, throw your steak in. I put it in for 6 minutes. After 6 minutes weall throw a thermometer in and see where we gotta go.",

Drain the water and add the garlic, lemon juice, and olive oil to the bowl. Muddle the mixture together with a fork until no large chunks of garlic or anchovies remain. Add the tuna, scallions, and salt and pepper to taste. Add the mayonnaise and the vinegar to taste. If the anchovy flavor is too strong, add more lemon juice and black pepper to dial it back. Spoon the salad on top of one slice of toasted bread and cover with a second slice. Repeat until you have 4 sandwiches. Cut each in half to serve."

      "Follow this recipe first before trying other variations of your own. I use red & green peppers together, but always make sure at least half of your peppers are green, because the flavor of the green are more pungent than any other color. Sometimes I'll use half turkey franks and half all beef. The flavor of the all beef incorporated with the green peppers and tomatoes is a perfect combination. Enjoy :o}"

      "MAKE THE STUFFING",
      "In a small saucepan, melt 2 tbs. of the butter over medium-low heat. Add the scallions and a pinch of salt and cook, stirring, until softned, 3 to 4 minutes (don't brown). Take the pan off the heat and stir in the Worcestershire sauce and hot sauce. Cool to room temperature.",
      "",
      "In a medium bowl, combine the mayonnaise, 1 Tbs. of the chopped parsley, 1 tsp. of the lemon juice, the lemon zest, the mustard, 1/4 tsp. salt, and a few grinds of pepper. Stir in the cooled scallion mixture. Add the crab and mix gently but thoroughly.",
      "In a 10-inch skillet, melt the remaining 1 1/2 Tbs. butter over medium heat. Add the breadcrumbs and cook, stirring, until light golden brown, about 4 minutes. Transfer to a medium bowl and mix in the remaining 1 Tbs. chopped parsley and 1/4 tsp. salt.",
      "",
      "STUFFING THE SHRIMP",
      "Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment and rub lightly with butter. Arrange the butterflied shrimp on the baking sheet. Using a spoon or your hands, mound a heaping tablespoon of the crab mixture onto the shrimp. Sprinkle and pat the breadcrumbs over the crab. (this wil be messy; don't worry if there are crumbs on the baking sheet.) Flip the tail of each shrimp up and over the crab.",
      "",
      "BAKE THE SHRIMP",
      "Position a rack in the center of the oven and heat the oven to 400. Bake until the shrimp are cooked through, the crabmeat is hot, and the crumbs are golden brown, 12 to 14 minutes",
      "While the shrimp are in the oven, toss the frisee and the whole parsley leaves with the remaining 1/2tsp lemon juice, the olive oil, and a pinch of salt.",
      "On 8 small plates, arrange a small pile of the salad and two shrimp. Serve right away."
