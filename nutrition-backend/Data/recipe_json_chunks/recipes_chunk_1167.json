With an electric mixer, add 3 cups of chicken stock, the Matzo Meal, the rest of the salt and Flour to the eggs, and mix till reasonably incorporated. Now, with a rubber spatula, by hand, fold in the onion/herb mixture, and the last step is to add the shredded potatoes to the mix. Cover the batter with plastic wrap and let it sit in the Refrigerator for at least an hour.",
      "Heat the Corn Oil in an electric skillet and gently mix the potato batter which should have been sitting in the refrigerator. The batter should form round clumps with are then spooned/dropped into the hot oil. Fry on a medium-low heat, again fresh herbs burn quickly and you only want the pancakes to be slightly golden and cook till they hold together. Generally, they cook 7 min on each side. Drain on paper towels and serve with my Homemade Buttermilk/Onion Dip and Apple Cider."

When the onions and bacon are removed from the stove, 2 drops of Tabasco sauce (this is for 3 dozen oysters) are added along with the Worcestershire sauce. Otherwise, the steps are much the same.

Heat two large skillets, or a griddle, to medium, about 325\u00b0F Lightly grease the griddle and/or skillets. Brush the bottoms of the sandwiches lightly with olive oil or melted butter. Place them in the greased pan(s). Brush the tops with oil or butter. Top them with a piece of parchment paper or foil, then a flat sheet pan, or other flat, non-meltable object-the point is to provide a flat surface for a weight. Place something heavy atop the pan-a teakettle filled with water makes a good weight, as does a clean brick wrapped in aluminum foil.",

Adjust the heat downward if the bottoms are becoming brown after only a couple of minutes. Turn the sandwiches over and grill for several more minutes, until they're slightly crisp on both sides, and the cheese is melting. Remove from the heat, cut the sandwiches in 2, and serve warm."

      "Warm the milk in microwave safe dish for 1-1 1/2 minutes. Then add all ingredients to your bread pan in this order. I cut up the butter and scatter it around the bottom of the pan. Be sure not to put your salt and yeast where they will not touch each other. It will deactivate the yeast if they touch. You can make a little whole in the top of your flour and pour the yeast into there.",

      "Filling.",
      "Brown and scramble hamburger and sausage on low to medium heat, in a large skillet that has a lid. You will need to use the lid later when cooking the cabbage. You can use it now if you want.",
      "Onions, peel and cut onions into a few pieces. Put in the food processor and chop until small but not mushy. Add to burger mixture, and cook until they are somewhat clear. Drain grease, saving it to use later.",
      "Cabbage, cut up cabbage in chunks add about a 1/4 of it in the food processor at a time. Chop until small, but not too small. Add it to hamburger mixture. Add a little of the grease to the pan (a tablespoon or so) so the cabbage won't stick. (You can use butter here if you want, but the grease will give it a little more flavor.).",
      "Garlic, put garlic through a garlic press and add to hamburger/cabbage mixture. Stir and put lid on. Cook on med heat until cabbage is tender. Stir occasionally.",
      "After cabbage is cooked, add cream of mushroom soup and stir. Add cheese. Stir until it is distributed evenly. It doesn't have to be melted completely. Salt and pepper to taste. *Sausage and cheese will add a lot of salt so you might not need any. Taste to be sure. Remove from heat.",
      "Assembling your Bierocks.",
      "Preheat your oven to 350 degrees.",
      "Arrange your work space with a large plate right in front of you, 2-12 count greased cupcake pans, filling, dough and a small dish with the butter or margarine all within your reach.",
      "After your dough is done,.",
      "*if you want to be precise about how many bierocks you will have enough bread for, it may be easiest for you to divide your bread into 24 pieces before starting to fill them. You should start out by buttering your hands well, and divide your dough in half. Keep dividing pieces in half until you have 24 pieces.",
      "* If you're not concerned about the exact number, butter your hands, and pull a small amount of dough off. It should be about an inch around maybe a little bigger. A little goes a long way! Put the dough ball on a buttered plate, and smash it down with the palm of your hand and fingers,working it into a circle. Make it into about a 4-5 inch circle. If you tear a large hole in the dough just fold it over so the hole is at the edge of the dough and try again. Use a 1/4 cup measuring cup to scoop filling. Place 1/4 cup of the mixture in the middle of the dough circle. Grab the back side of the dough and gently/slowly stretch it out and then up and over the top of the filling. Grab the front side and slowly stretch it out and then up and fold it over the top, overlapping the dough from the back. Do the same with the sides trying to close the opening. Flip it over so the folded side is down as you put it into the cupcake pan. * You don't have to worry too much about pinching it closed. It will seal itself when it cooks.",
      "Repeat until you have used all of your dough or filling. It will make 24 Bierocks muffins, if you are consistent and don't use too much dough.",
      "Place in a 350 degree oven for approximately 15 minutes. Watch and adjust time as needed.",
      "I cooked mine in a roaster over with the lid on. My oven was broken and this worked well.",
      "ENJOY!",
      "Update: If cooking in the oven they will take longer. Cook until top is slightly or golden brown depending on preference."

But you can also try to line your steamer pan with a cheesecloth and then when it is ready, just lay the dough onto a cutting board that has been generously sprinkled with cornstarch and roll it into a log and then slice the dough from that instead of doing it in the procedure above.
