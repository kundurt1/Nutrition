Remove from the heat and allow the brine to cool completely. Put the pork shoulder in a large container (6- to 8-quart), skin side up and pour the brine over it. Ideally, the shoulder should be submerged, the skin acting as a lid. If not, press it with a plate and put a heavy object on top. Refrigerate for 36 - 48 hours.",

Pour boiling water over the dates, until they are fully covered in water. Leave until the dates are very soft. (It will take about 15-20 minutes if the dates are soft, but it can take an hour or so if the dates are dry and hard.) Transfer the dates with water into food processor and process until you have smooth puree.",
      "To make the pork: Prepare a large Dutch oven (I use 7 1/4 quart), or similar cooking vessel with a lid. Drain the pork and pat dry. Season generously with salt and pepper. In the Dutch oven heat the oil until it is very hot. Sear the pork all over -- it should be nicely browned. (I sear the skin side too, because an extra touch of Maillard reaction never hurts. But this is optional.) Transfer the pork onto a plate. Discard the oil and fat from the Dutch oven and deglaze with about 1/2 cup of water. Reserve the deglazing liquid.",
      "Preheat the oven to 190\u00b0F. Place the pork shoulder back into the Dutch oven. In a large bowl, mix the date paste with the deglazing liquid, mustard and marmite (if using). Mix well. Add 8 cups of water, cider and bay leaves. Pour the liquid into the Dutch oven. The liquid should almost cover the pork. Cover with lid and place in the oven. Cook for about 16 hours, or until the meat is very soft and close to falling apart, yet still pink in the center. (Cooking time will depend on how tough the meat is. Start checking the meat at about 14 hours, but I typically get the desired doneness in about 16 hours for a 6-8 lb picnic.)",
      "Remove the meat from the liquid. Cover with aluminum foil and keep in warm oven. With a large spoon slowly remove the fat from the top of the liquid. Proceed to reduce the liquid. Place the Dutch oven over high heat and bring to boil. Continue to boil on medium high heat until the liquid begins to thicken (this takes quite a bit of time, plan on at least an hour, because it is a lot of liquid.) Once the liquid reduces significantly, reduce the heat to medium -- to prevent from burning -- and then continue to reduce until it reaches the consistency of thin syrup. Remove from the stove and let the glaze cool. (It will thicken more as it cools. If it becomes too thick, add a drop or two of water until it reaches desired consistency.) You will have about 1 1/2 - 2 cups of glaze.",
      "Remove the skin and fat, and separate the meat from the bone. Cut the meat into large chunks or shred it with two forks (it's really up to you). Pour the glaze over the meat. Serve with nice slaw on the side. (Alternatively, you can keep the fat, skin and bone, and let the guests do the \"digging\". My people love it. In that case, while the liquid is reducing, put the pork, skin side up, under the broiler for a couple of minutes to crisp up the skin for nicer presentation.)",
      "Note: You can prepare everything up to step five and keep in the fridge overnight. The following day, warm up the meat gently while the glaze is reducing, and serve. The quantities in this recipe work with larger cuts, up to 10 lbs, without increasing the amount of ingredients. But you will have to increase cooking time to about 20 hours up to a full day."

    "title": "lavender-thyme bread",
    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "Using water will give you a looser crumb, whereas milk will give you a tighter one and a bit richer flavor. Milk will raise the calorie count, where water will lower it. Use whichever you prefer.",
      "Warm milk in a stainless steel pan to about 85 degrees. Alternatively, run warm tap water to the same temperature. Pour into bowl of a stand mixer. Sprinkle active dry yeast over it and whisk it in. If using instant yeast, scale it straight into your flour.",
      "Pour sugar, lavender buds, fresh thyme leaves, and lemon zest into the bowl of a food processor. Turn on and let run while you scale the remaining ingredients.",
      "Measure flour (and instant yeast if using), salt, and olive oil straight into mixer bowl. Add the now-crumbled lavender mixture. Mix on lowest speed using the dough hook until ingredients come together and leave the sides and bottom of the bowl. Have a bit of water and flour to hand in case you need to adjust the balance a bit, but try to have the patience to let the dough and mixer do their jobs before you decide to add one or the other.",
      "Once dough has come together, turn off mixer and drape a piece of plastic around the top of the bowl. Set a timer for 10 minutes and walk away. You're giving the dough an autolyse, or rest period, to let the gluten in the flour fully hydrate without having to contend with being kneaded at the same time. After the rest period, remove the plastic and keep it nearby. After all the uncountable loaves of bread I've made, I still have never tired of this point: you'll turn the mixer on to low speed and watch a beautifully silky ball of dough revolve around the hook. It's like seeing a butterfly hatch from a cocoon. Within a couple of minutes you'll be able to stop the mixer, pull off a walnut-sized piece of dough, and briefly round it up between your palms. Tenderly begin stretching it over the tips of your fingers. You want to see how thin you can gently stretch it without it tearing. This is called testing for a windowpane. When you get it thin and can also tap gently on the backside, you're there; you've adequately developed the gluten in your flour. It will hold your bread up just like framing and timbers hold up your house. If the dough separates, simply toss the piece of dough back in and continue kneading on low speed for a few minutes more until you build a good windowpane.",
      "If you don't need your mixer again right away, you can proof your dough right in the same bowl. If you do need it, follow this step with another bowl. Turn your dough out onto your board. Pour a couple of teaspoons of canola oil into the bowl and use a paper towel to swish it around the sides and bottom. Return the dough to the bowl and turn it over from bottom to top so the oiled side is up. Cover with your original piece of plastic and allow to proof at room temperature until dough reaches the top of the mixer bowl. I find that when I use milk, this takes longer, sometimes by as much as 30 minutes. Proofing time will range from 45 to 90 minutes.",
      "When dough has doubled, remove plastic and hang onto it again. Turn dough out onto your board. Have a half-cup pile of flour nearby. Gently divide dough in half with a bench scraper. Shape each half into a hearth loaf in the shape of your choice: long and thin, shorter and sort of rectangular (a batard), round, long and thin and curled into an S shape; it's your bread, go to town. Gently invert it and tap the top into the pile of flour. This will prevent your well-used piece of plastic from sticking to the surface, and will also give it a rustic look I'm very fond of on virtually any kind of bread.",
      "Set each loaf on a baking sheet lined with parchment. These beauties grow, so leave some room between them. Drape that piece of plastic over them and let proof at room temperature until doubled. A finger gently pressed against the surface will leave an indentation. If it still feels springy, let it continue proofing. Have you ever baked bread and had it separate with a tearing sort of effect along the lower sides? You didn't let it proof long enough. Be patient. Let the yeast do its job. Baking bread is kind of like being pregnant. Very kind of.",
      "About 30 minutes into the proofing time, preheat oven to 375 degrees. When bread is ready for the oven, remove plastic. You're done with it; it's safe to toss it. Using a serrated knife, slash the surface of your loaves a good 1/2\" deep, holding the knife at an acute angle. Give it at least 3 or 4 good slashes. You finally get to take charge of something; you're telling the dough the direction in which you want it to expand once it hits the heat of the oven. Bake for 30 minutes, but set a timer for 15 minutes and rotate loaves. Set it for another 15 minutes. Bread is done when it registers an internal temperature of 185 degrees on an instant-read thermometer. Remove from oven and remove from baking sheet onto a cooling rack. Please allow to cool to the point where you can comfortably handle before slicing. Otherwise, all you'll taste will be the heat. The lavender, thyme, and lemon form a subtle base-note sort of flavor that requires a cool temperature to distinguish."

Lay tarragon or other herb stems across the top of the fish and cover the top with the rest of the sliced leeks.",

Seal the edges together to form a compact tent around the salmon (let the cord of the thermometer poke through one of the seams if you are using one). Repeat with the second layer of foil. The salmon can rest until you are ready to roast.",

      "Note: This is also a fantastic way to cook whole salmon. For a 4lb salmon, you can use relatively the same amount of ingredients. Increase cooking time to 35-40 minutes."

The sea salt will enhance the ice cream's flavor too. Brownies with fresh whipped cream and raspberries or sliced strawberries is also a winning combo.

      "NOTE: Sichuan peppercorns are paramount in mapo tofu, but even then most recipes are being cheap with it. You need the real stuff and you need more. I have for many time, mentioned the difference between red sichuan peppercorn (the typical kind that people refer to) and green sichuan peppercorn (the less common variety), so I may be repeating myself here. In a nutshell, red sichuan peppercorn delivers strong fragrance with a milder numbing power, whereas green sichuan peppercorn... who knows what it tastes like as it will numb your face off completely. It is very common in China that a combination of both is used in different dishes to reach the desired balance. If you only have red sichuan peppercorn and feel absolutely unmotivated to buy the green type, you can just use red. But the result won't be the same.",
      "NOTE 2: The thing about writing recipes with Asian condiments is that different brands vary in taste and saltiness. The link provide for douban paste (sichuan fermented chili bean paste) is exactly the same one I used which is very authentic and salty. If you're using a different brand, you may need to slightly adjust the amount accordingly. I don't have a link for the exact dark soy sauce I used, so you'll have to rely a little bit on your taste-buds. If the soy sauce lands on the \"sweeter\" side, reduce the sugar accordingly.",

      "TO MAKE THE DOUBAN (CHILI BEAN PASTE) OIL: Combine vegetable oil, douban/chili bean paste and chili flakes in a sauce pot. Break apart the douban/chili bean paste as good as you can with the back of a spoon (it'll clump up once the oil gets hot), and set over medium heat. Let fry for about 3 ~ 4 min until the chili flakes turn dark red in color, then turn off the heat and let it sit until cooled down completely. Strain the oil through a fine sieve into another container, and keep in the fridge until needed.",

Bring to a simmer and cook for 1 min. Drain and set aside.) Evenly mix ground beef, toasted sesame oil, soy sauce and cornstarch together, and set aside.",

Cook and break up the ground beef-mixture until browned, then add the grated ginger, grated garlic, diced red chili, douban paste and assorted sichuan pepper corn powder. Stir and cook for a couple min until fragrant (it's important to stir-fry the douban paste for a while to release its aroma), then add the shao-xing wine (or rice wine), dark soy sauce and sugar. Cook for a min to let the alcohol evaporate, then add the chicken stock, chili flakes and the diced tofu. Turn the heat down to medium-low, and let simmer until the liquid has reduced down almost completely and thickened slightly (stir gently in between without breaking up the tofu). Last, add 1/4 tsp of rice vinegar and stir gently to incorporate.",
      "Whisk together cornstarch and water, then drizzle 1/2 tbsp of the mixture slowly into the sauce. Gently stir until thickened slightly, then drizzle another 1 tbsp more and gently stir again. You won't need all of the cornstarch-mixture, maybe just 1/2 tbsp more (the gradual thickening-method supposedly better help the sauce stick to the tofu). Wait until the sauce has fully thickened before deciding if you want to add more. Once the sauce has fully thickened, transfer to a serving dish.",
      "Scatter the minced garlic in the center, and sprinkle 1/2 tsp of assorted sichuan peppercorn powder and 1/2 tsp of ground white pepper evenly over the tofu. Heat up 1/4 cup of chili bean paste oil in a small pot until it starts to smoke up a little. Pour the hot oil over the dish, and it should sizzle and release the fragrance from the peppercorn powder across the board. Diced scallion is optional.\r\n\r\nServe with steamed rice and... maybe a glass of iced water."

      "Combine the remaining milk and yeast in a medium sized bowl. If you have a stand mixer, you can use it, but I made this batch with a wooden spoon and a bit of good old fashioned stirring. Add the rested flour mixture along with the vanilla and the egg. Stir until smooth. Add the whole wheat flour plus 1/4 cup of the bread flour. Top with the sugar and salt and vigorously stir until the dough starts to come together. Add the butter, and continue to stir, adding flour about 1/8 cup at a time, until the dough starts to form into a ball. Then, with a dough hook if you are using a mixer or with your hands, knead in the remaining flour a little at a time until the dough is somewhat smooth and only a little sticky. You may have a little flour left over... just save it for when you roll out your dough.",
      "Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let it sit in a warm place for 30 minutes. Gently push down the dough, recover, and refrigerate for at least 1 hour (and up to 12 hours). This will help stiffen the dough a little and make it easier to roll and cut out.",
      "Line a baking sheet with a lightly floured non-terry dish towel. Roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface to 1/2 inch thick. With a doughnut or cookie cutter, cut out 2-inch-diameter rounds (or, if you want, you can make traditional doughnut shapes with this dough and skip the filling).",
      "Place the doughnuts on the cloth lined baking sheet at least 1 inch apart and cover with plastic wrap. Let sit in a warm spot to proof until they almost double in size, about 30 to 40 minutes, testing at five-minute intervals. To test whether the dough is ready, touch lightly with a fingertip. If it springs back immediately, it needs more time. If it springs back slowly, it is ready. If it doesn't spring back at all, it has over-proofed; you can punch it down and re-roll it once.",
      "When the doughnuts are almost done proofing, heat a heavy-bottomed pot with at least 2 inches of oil until a deep-fat thermometer registers 365?F. With a metal spatula, carefully lift the proofed doughnuts and place them in the oil. Fry for 1 to 2 minutes per side, or until light golden brown. Remove with a slotted spoon, drain on a wire rack over a paper towel.",
      "It's important to let your doughnuts cool all the way before filling, but if you want your doughnuts sugar coated, dip them in a shallow bowl of granulated sugar while they are still slightly warm to the touch. Superfine bakers sugar works the best for this. If you want your doughnuts powdered sugar dusted, wait for them to cool before shaking on the powdered sugar.",
      "These doughnuts become almost completely hollow when fried without a hole punched in the center, so they are really easy to fill. Lightly hold the doughnut from the bottom, cradling the sides with your fingers, and gently insert the piping bag tip. If the doughnut isn't hollow for some reason, you can clear a space with a chopstick... and then simply squeeze your piping bag, slowly withdrawing it as you fill. I like a little dollop of filling to come out the top so you can see what is inside. If you fill with meringue, use a kitchen torch to lightly brown the meringue.",
      "Put the maple syrup in a 1 quart heavy bottom pot with a candy thermometer attached. Heat over medium until the syrup comes to 235F. The syrup will bubble pretty fiercely, so keep an eye on it so it doesn't bubble over. Also, be careful not to overheat or you'll end up with maple candy.",
      "When the syrup gets up around 220F, place the egg whites in the bowl of a mixer with the cream of tartar and the salt and mix until just frothy. Then, increase the speed and beat until the whites can hold a stiff peak.",
      "When the syrup has come to temperature, turn the mixer back on medium speed and slowly stream in the hot syrup, continuing to beat until the meringue is thick and a bit shiny, about 2 minutes.",
      "Transfer the meringue to a piping bag. If you have a long berliner tip for your piping bag, this is the easiest, but a standard 1/4 inch star tip will work well too. Then, fill as directed in the doughnut recipe."

Bake for 15 to 20 minutes, turning the baking sheets halfway through, or until they are deeply golden-brown and some of the marshmallow has bubbled out. Let cool for at least 5 minutes. Croissants will keep, in an airtight container at room temperature for about 3 days."

      "Five minutes later, remove the lid and add your candy thermometer. Continue to cook on medium until the mixture reaches 240 degrees [another five to ten minutes - don't step away, cooked sugar likes to be babied.] Once the thermometer hits 240, turn the heat off and let the sugar syrup cool to 210.",
      "Carefully pour the cooled liquid into the stand mixer, trying to avoid the sides of the metal bowl. Put the whisk attachment on your mixer and turn the mixer on low. After about two minutes, crank the machine up to medium. Two more minutes later, crank it up to medium high. [These are gradual steps so that you don't have hot sugar syrup splattered in your face.]",

      "Turn off the mixer and grab your greased pan and a spatula. Spray the spatula with oil and unhinge the whisk from the mixer. Set aside. Using the oiled spatula, scrape the marshmallow into the pan. Don't get too obsessed with residue on the bowl, and don't get your fingers involved, or it can become a sticky trap.",
      "Once all marshmallow is in the pan, clean your spatula and wet it. Using the wet spatula, smooth the marshmallows. You can lift the pan up and smack it against the counter if you'd like, as well. Cover the smoothed marshmallow with powdered sugar, gently cover with plastic wrap or foil and refrigerate. Four hours minimum, overnight preferred.",
      "Now it's cutting time. Get a large cutting board and gently move the giant mallow to the board - your fingers should be able to remove it from the edges. I like to place it powdered sugar-side-down. Now get a knife or pair of kitchen shears. Dunk the utensil in hot water and slice into 1\" rows. Then slice each row into squares. If smaller marshmallows are desired, cut each square in half.",
      "Using a large bowl, covered container or plastic bag, toss your squares in more powdered sugar. Use a fine mesh strainer to jimmy off extra powdered sugar and transfer to a large air-tight container. Marshmallows are best fresh and room temperature, but these can be refrigerated for weeks or frozen for months."

Some bubbles are okay, but beware a boil-over, which won't hurt the quality of your yogurt but is really a pain to scrub off your stovetop later. (For all you temperature-takers out there, you're looking for the milk to hit 180\u00b0F.)",

This cooling takes a while-check after 15 minutes, then every 5 minutes after that.",

Cover the pot and set in the oven with the oven light on (or, alternatively, wrap in a cozy blanket and set in a warm spot (like the top of your refrigerator). Leave in this warm spot at least overnight and up to 36 hours. The longer it rests, the tangier it will be.",
      "Lift up the lid to peek and give the pot a gentle shake. The yogurt should jiggle slightly, and some whey may have separated from it. Recover it and refrigerate until cold, 2 to 4 hours. (I find the texture benefits from this cooling before you portion it into jars.)",
      "For a thicker, Greek-style yogurt, set a clean dishtowel or a double-layer of cheesecloth over a strainer set over a large bowl. Pour the chilled yogurt into the dishtowel, fold the edges of the dishtowel over the surface of the yogurt, and let drain in the refrigerator for 4 to 6 hours.

    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "To make the mincemeat, chop up the larger dried fruits (like whole figs and apricots) into roughly 1/2-inch pieces. Transfer all the dried fruit into a pot, and add the candied ginger, apple, orange juice and zest, port, butter, sugar, salt, and all the spices. Bring this to a boil, then turn the heat down to a low simmer, and let it cook for 30 to 40 minutes, until nearly all the liquid has evaporated. Then, add in the brandy or cognac, and let cool to room temperature before transferring to an airtight jar or container. (The mincemeat keeps well for up to a month in the refrigerator. I like keeping them for at least a week before using it, as the flavor will deepen and develop a bit more, but it works fresh too!)",
      "Now onto the pie dough. As per Stella Parks' genius technique, start by mixing the flour, sugar, and salt in a bowl. Then, toss the cubes of butter in the flour and pinch each butter cube flat with your fingers. Add in the cold water, and quickly knead it into the butter and flour until a rough ball of dough forms. Place the dough on a well-floured flat surface, sprinkle more flour on top, and roll the dough out into a rough 10x15-inch rectangle. Fold the two shorter sides into the middle so the edges meet, then fold it in half lengthwise. If not using immediately, wrap the dough in plastic and store it in the refrigerator. (Alternatively, you can freeze the dough if you're keeping it over many days or weeks, just make sure to defrost it in the refrigerator for 24 hours before using it.)",
      "Preheat the oven to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C), and ready a mini muffin tin or individual tartlet moulds to bake the mince pies in.",
      "Take the pie dough out of the refrigerator, and roll it out until 1/8-inch (3-4mm) thick. Cut out 20-25 little discs of dough with a 3-inch ring mould (fluted if possible), and nestle each disc into the muffin tin or tartlet moulds. Then, dollop a tablespoon of mincemeat into each pie. (If your work surface isn't quite big enough to punch out 20-25 dough discs, you can split the initial dough in half and work in batches.)",
      "Using a star-shaped cookie cutter, punch little stars out of the dough, gathering and re-rolling it out as needed. Place these dough stars on top of the mince pies, and brush a thin layer of egg wash on top.",
      "Bake the mince pies in the oven for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the tops are golden. When they're done, remove from the moulds and let them cool down on a wire rack until warm to touch. Repeat the baking process until all your mince pies are baked.",
      "Dust a flurry of icing sugar on top of the mince pies and serve on a large cookie platter. (They keep well for up to a week in an airtight container. If you're saving them for later, pop them into the oven for 5 minutes to warm up right before serving.)"

If you want that same result, lightly flour a flat surface and carefully roll out the disks with a rolling pin to make them a tad bigger.",
      "Fill each disk with a spoonful of the pork & chive mixture, leaving just enough room to seal the edges without ripping. Again, not rolling the disk out will make it easier to seal since it will be thicker so it's your choice. Dip your finger in water and wet only half of the disk's circumference. Seal tightly and place each mandoo on a lightly floured surface to prevent sticking, until ready to use. If you're making this ahead of time, freeze the dumplings and cook them while still frozen to prevent ripping. Sometimes thawing them will cause a soggy and undesirable result.",
      "For the tteokbokki sauce, simmer the water with anchovies for about 5 minutes on medium heat. This will help the flavors come alive. Slowly drop each mandoo into the water and after they've all been placed in water, add mushrooms, simmering on low heat for approximately 10 minutes. Add red pepper paste (gochujang), red pepper flakes (gochugaru), honey, oil, and boiled eggs. Cook for another 4 minutes on low heat. Test to see if pork is fully cooked by piercing a dumpling and if meat is no longer pink, it's good to go. Enjoy while it's still hot and fresh! This dish can be frozen or refrigerated but when you heat it up make sure not to rip the dumplings."

      "If possible, refrigerate overnight to allow flavors to mix, or for a few hours.",
      "Place 1/2 cup meat mixture inside a Ziploc freezer bag. Form into a sausage shape by sliding the meat down into bag with the edge of your hand. Expel air and seal carefully. Roll. At this point they may be frozen for future use.",
      "Fill a large pot of water 3/4 full and bring to a boil. Reduce to a slow, slow simmer. Place sausages into water trying not to allow the top of the bag to sink into the water. Simmer for about 15 minutes.",
      "Remove sausages from pot and allow to sit for about five minutes. The fat will rise to the top of the bag. Removes sausages. If you'd like to serve them with their natural juices, carefully make a small cut in the corner of the bag and drain the juices.",
      "Serve plain or with Tzatziki (cucumber) sauce.",
      "SAUSAGE ADVICE\r\n*Use name-brand, pint-sized plastic bags. Generic are usually thinner and the corners leak so you will lose the poaching liquid inside the bag resulting in a very dry sausage. Name-brand, such as Ziploc, do not contain BPA, a harmful chemical.\r\n*Use less, not more, of each spice if in doubt. You can always add more later on. Keep a notepad nearby to record what you add.\r\n*I actually prefer dried spices and herbs, but prefer fresh garlic that is smashed into a paste. Use fresh cheese, not canned/powdered which can dry the sausage.\r\n*After mixing, place a good teaspoonful on a plate and microwave for about 30 seconds or until no pink remains in center. Taste. Adjust seasonings accordingly.\r\n*The ideal sausage mixture is 70/30. Pre-ground pork is 80/20, but it's okay. If you have a friendly butcher, he will be more than happy to grind some fresh suet for you. You can also add ground bacon. Allow it to partially freeze, cut into chunks and grind in your food processor. But remember it will alter the taste of your sausage.\r\n*As the sausages poach, they will shrink. Sometimes the bag will, too.\r\n*Be sure to add the water to your mix. This adds moisture and helps to incorporate the spices.\r\n*If possible, refrigerate your mixture for several hours or overnight before forming into sausages.\r\n*These freeze beautifully. I allow mine to thaw before poaching. \r\n*If you want, carefully remove sausages a bit before they are done and brown in a bit of butter/olive oil. \r\n*Smoked paprika adds great smoky taste to homemade sausages.\r\n*Because they are lower in fat than regular sausages, condiments work well with Ziploc sausages.\r\n*If your sausage mixture ends up too strong in spicy flavors, form into patties and fry. Frying reduces the strong tastes."

(scroll further down).\r\n\r\n(If you want to pre soak the Pecans the night before, just pop them in with the rest of the ingredients, but make sure to add the fig-paste at last.)",
      "Instructions for the Mango/Lime filing: \r\n\r\nIf you have a powerful blender/food processor, just put all the ingredients in and process. Otherwise, grind the Cashews into a flour in a coffee grinder or food processor, then add the mango, lime, coconut oil and salt. Process until completely smooth. Pour the filling over the pie crust and put in the fridge while you make the kiwi-balls! I didn't have a \"melon baller\" at home, but I did have a teaspoon measuring cup in form of a melon baller, it worked just as well! Here's the result!"

      "To prepare the crumble: Dice the butter and place in a small saucepan over medium heat. Allow the butter to melt and, stirring all the while, brown the butter. You'll remove the butter from the heat when you notice it becomes nutty in fragrance and auburn-colored flecks appear at the bottom of the pan. Don't let the butter burn and see notes for more on this. Pour the butter into a bowl and add the brown sugar, salt, vanilla and cinnamon. Stir in the flour until large crumbles appear and then place in the fridge to chill while you prepare the cake.",
      "To prepare the cake: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.\r\nIn a large bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer, cream the butter, sugar, and brown sugar for one minute. Scrape the sides of the bowl and then beat in the egg until pale, about 2 minutes. Add the buttermilk, vanilla, and bananas and stir just to combine. Add the flour, baking soda, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt, and stir on low just until combined. Grease a small baking dish (I use an 8\"x4\" pan but you can substitute whatever you have) and spread in the butter. Use your fingers to crumble the brown butter topping evenly over top of the batter. Bake in the preheated oven until the cake has fluffed and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 30-35 minutes depending on your pan. Allow to cool and then drizzle with the topping if desired. To prepare the topping, combine the powdered sugar, vanilla, and milk in a small bowl until smooth. Add a smidge more milk if the mixture is too thick. Drizzle over top of the cooled cake.",
      "For the drizzle (optional):\r\nCombine 1 cup powdered sugar, 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract, and 2 tablespoons of milk in a large bowl and drizzle over the cooler cake."

      "On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough to 1/4 inch thick. Try to keep it somewhat rectangular while you work. Fold the left edge of the dough 1/3 of the way over the dough. Fold the right edge 1/3 of the way over the dough as well, resting on the piece you just folded over. Think of it like folding a piece of paper to fit into a standard-sized envelope.",
      "Repeat this process two more times, for a total of three folds. If the dough is cold enough when you begin, you shouldn't need to refrigerate it during this process, but if it becomes soft or sticky, refrigerate it for 10 to 15 minutes before continuing. Refrigerate the finished folded dough for 20 to 30 minutes before proceeding.",
      "On a lightly floured surface, roll out the chilled dough to 1/4 inch thick. Using an apple as a guide, cut the dough into large circles-large enough to fully wrap the apple up (the exact size will depend on the size of your apples, but the circles will likely be around 4 to 5 inches in diameter).",
      "In a small bowl, stir the sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg together to combine.",
      "Working one a time, place an apple in the center of a circle of dough. Sprinkle 2 teaspoons of sugar all over the apple-around the outside and in the hole where it's cored. Place one pat of butter in the center of the apple.",
      "Gently stretch the dough outward, then bring it to the top. Continue all the way around, letting the dough pleat naturally as you bring it to the top, and pinch it at the top to seal. Repeat on the remaining apples.",
      "Transfer the apples to the prepared baking dish. Egg wash the dough all around and sprinkle generously with turbinado sugar. Bake until the dough is crisp and golden, and the apples are soft on the inside (you can use a knife to check by seeing how easily it pierces in the inside), 35 to 45 minutes (though the exact time will will depend on the size of your apples).",
      "If using, make the caramel. (Note: it can take awhile-so you can also make it ahead of time, since the dumplings should be served warm!) Place the cider in a large (wide) pot and bring to a boil. Boil until the liquid reduces and the mixture forms a caramel (the precise timing will depend on the size of your pot, but this process takes about 1 to 2 hours; don't worry, you don't need to stir it, just keep an eye on it every 15 minutes or so, and a closer eye toward the end.)",
      "Stir the butter, salt, and vanilla into the caramel, then pour the whole mixture into a heat-safe bowl to cool slightly, about 15 minutes.",
      "Serve the dumplings warm, doused with caramel sauce and with a dollop of whipped cream."

      "In a large bowl, add the bread flour and make a well in the center. Add 1 cup water in roughly 1/8 cup increments, mixing it in with chopsticks, until all the water has been added. It will look rough.",
      "Once all of the water has been added, use your hands to mix it in, kneading it to form a rough dough inside the bowl. The dough should be dry, but if it's falling apart, add more water 1 tablespoon at a time. Knead until there are no residual clumps of dough in the bowl or on your hands. Once it resembles a rough dough, turn it onto a dry surface and knead for 5 to 6 minutes. Its surface should start to become smooth.",
      "Wrap it in plastic wrap and let it rest for 15 minutes, to allow the flour to hydrate.",
      "Remove dough from plastic wrap and knead it on dry surface for another 5 to 6 minutes. Wrap it in plastic and allow it to rest for another 15 minutes. After each rest, the dough should become visibly smoother and easier to work with.",
      "Remove dough from plastic wrap and knead for another 5 to 6 minutes. Form a long oval shape and fold it into thirds, with the two ends overlapping, so that there are three layers. Knead it into a long oval shape again, and repeat this process another two times. Form it into a long oval shape once more and wrap it in plastic. Allow it to rest in the refrigerator for 30 minutes. At this point, the dough's surface should be very smooth, or \"guan hua ti shi\" in Chinese.",
      "After 30 minutes, bring a pot of salted water to a boil and begin to cut the dough into noodles, using one of two methods: For the traditional method, use a very sharp knife and have a pot of boiling water ready. With your left hand, hold the oval dough pointed downward at a 30\u00b0 angle, with the downward-facing edge resting on a cutting board. This will help you make smooth, even cuts. With your right hand, shave the knife down the dough to create thin noodles. There's a Chinese saying to help you visualize this technique, \"Knife doesn't leave the dough, and dough doesn't leave the knife.\" It should be a continuous loop. This technique is tricky, which is why I opted to do the second, less traditional but easier technique: Place the oval dough flat on the cutting board. Use a sharp knife to slice off noodle pieces, as if it were a vegetable. This makes it easier to control the thickness and length. If the cut noodles begin sticking together, flour them with bread flour.",
      "Add the noodles into the boiling water and stir to prevent clumping. If you're using the noodles for the stir-fry below, remove the noodles as soon as the water returns to a boil. Rinse with cold water and set aside. If you are using these noodles for soup, cook them completely through, about 8 minutes. Either way, they should be used immediately to ensure freshness.",
      "Heat up a wok with some cooking oil.",
      "Add in the carrots, white parts of cabbage, and shiitake mushroom, and cook until softened, about 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from the pan and set aside.",
      "Add garlic, ginger, and Thai chile peppers to the wok, and stir-fry until lightly brown and fragrant.",
      "Add in the pork and cook, breaking up the pieces, until browned on all sides and halfway cooked. Add the carrot/shiitake mixture back into pan.",
      "Add in the knife-cut noodles, sugar, and sauces (light soy sauce, dark soy sauce, oyster sauce, and Shaoxing wine). Add the white pepper.",
      "Add in the scallions, green parts of cabbage, and egg. Stir until noodles are completely covered in sauce and the egg is scrambled in and cooked through. Add salt and white pepper to taste, and mix until well combined.",

If mixing by hand, knead until it easily pulls away from the sides of the bowl while as you knead (it will still be quite sticky).",
      "Transfer the finished dough to a well-oiled container and cover. Allow it to rise until doubled in size, about 1 hour. Alternatively, you can refrigerate the dough overnight so that it's ready to make in the morning-but you may need to punch the dough down once or twice during that period to prevent it from over-fermenting.",
      "To shape the doughnuts, roll out half of the dough on a lightly floured surface to about 1/2-inch thick. Use a doughnut cutter to cut doughnuts (alternatively you can use two circle cutters, or even the rim of a drinking glass and the rim of a shot glass, to shape the doughnuts). I also like to cut the doughnuts into squares (about 2 inches by 2 inches) using a pizza cutter -- this is especially great for filled doughnuts.",
      "Heat the oil to about 360\u00b0 F. (You can use a candy/fryer thermometer, but I just do a test with one of the donut holes or a scrap piece of dough: If it rises rapidly to the surface, the oil is ready. If the donuts begin to brown too quickly, the oil is too hot.)",
      "Fry the doughnuts, turning them halfway through cooking, until they're golden brown on each side. Drain on absorbent paper towels. Finish as desired. (You can glaze the donuts by dunking them, or by pouring the glaze over donuts on a rack).",
      "Some finishing options:",
      "-Powdered: Toss in powdered sugar or cinnamon sugar.",
      "-Glazed: Mix 3/4 cup powdered sugar, 3 to 4 tablespoons heavy cream or milk (enough to make a runny glaze), and 1/2 teaspoon vanilla (optional).",
      "-Chocolate-Glazed: Mix 3/4 cup powdered sugar, 2 tablespoons dark cocoa powder, and 4 to 5 tablespoons milk or cream.",
      "-Chocolate-Coated: Dip doughnuts in tempered chocolate thinned with 1 to 2 tablespoons vegetable oil.",
      "-Fruit-Glazed: Mix 1 cup powdered sugar and 1/4 cup fruit puree.",
      "-Violet-Glazed: Mix 1 cup powdered sugar, 1/4 cup cream or milk, and 1 teaspoon violet extract. Garnish with candied violets.",
      "-Pistachio: Glaze donuts with basic glaze, then press in chopped toasted pistachios.",
      "-Coconut: Glaze with coconut glaze (1 cup powdered sugar, 1/4 cup coconut milk, and 1/2 teaspoon vanilla), and press in toasted coconut flakes.",
      "-Black and White: Make a dark chocolate ganache with 1 cup chopped dark chocolate and 1/2 cup heavy cream. Make a white chocolate ganache with 1 cup chopped white chocolate with 1/4 cup heavy cream. Glaze half the doughnut with the chocolate glaze and half with the white glaze.",
      "-Caramel-Glazed: Melt 1 cup of caramel candies with 1/3 cup heavy cream in the microwave in 10-second blasts until fully melted. Thin the glaze with additional milk or cream as needed to get a pourable glaze.",
      "-Meyer Lemon: Mix 1 cup powdered sugar with the zest and juice of 1 Meyer lemon, then add enough milk to form a pourable glaze.",
      "-Cinnamon Roll: Roll out the dough to 1/4-inch thick. Mix together 1 stick melted butter with 1 cup granulated sugar and 2 tablespoons ground cinnamon. Spread the mixture evenly all over the dough, then roll tightly into a cylinder. Cut into 1 inch-thick pieces, then fry until golden brown. Glaze with basic glaze."

      "In a large heavy bottomed pot, heat 1 Tbsp EVOO and 2 Tbsp butter over medium heat. Toss in your carrots and cook till just about soft (5 minutes). Next add in your onion and cook for 3-4 minutes.",
      "Once the onions start 'sweating' their juices, add in the ground beef, thyme and salt & pepper. Cook the meat till browned, about 10-12 minutes.",
      "After your ground beef is cooked through and onions & carrots are soft, drain just a little of the grease (reserve some in pot). Sprinkle in the flour one Tbsp at a time. Quickly mix this in with your meat & veggie blend. The flour will bind it all together and really thicken it up fast!",
      "Now to finish up your Shepards Pie filling! Add in your broth, wine, tomato paste, Worcestershire, peas & garlic. Give it a good stir and bring heat down to a simmer. This will cook down quite a bit and thicken up after 20-30 minutes. It has SUCH a great, rich color to it!",
      "While your filling is simmering away, your baked potatoes should be done. Remove after the hour is up and allow to cool a bit, you need to be able to handle them. Also, bump that oven up to 400 degrees.\r\n\r\nHave a large bowl ready with the remaining butter already in it. Cut each potato in half lengthwise. With a spoon (carefully) scoop out about 90% of the potatoes flesh and put into the bowl. Careful NOT to break that potatoes skin! *I like to almost 'outline' where I'll be scooping out, keep just enough flesh against the potatoes skin to keep its shape. Place these hollowed out skins onto a baking sheet.",
      "With the potato flesh and butter now in the bowl, pour in your milk or heavy cream and a pinch of salt & pepper. Now mash away!! Or for creamier mashed potatoes, use an immersion blender if you have one available. \r\n\r\nHave ready your shredded cheddar and chopped parsley.",
      "Once you've finished the potatoes, your meat filling will be cooked down and ready to go!! The assembly step can be a bit messy, but that's ok! That just means it's going to be good....\r\n\r\nScoop a hefty amount of your meat & veggie mix straight into your potato skin shell. Next is the mashed potato layer. Go ahead and be liberal with that amount as well! What the heck right? ;) *you of course can make this \"pretty\" and use an icing bag to add the mashed potato layer, but I like it more rustic myself.",
      "Top each filled, potato off with a good amount of cheddar cheese and pop these bad boys in the oven for about 15 minutes.",
      "Once time is up, remove from the oven and sprinkle with some chopped, fresh parsley for added flavor and color. There you have it...Twice Baked Shepard's Pie!! Enjoy!"

Roll out to about 10 inches or so, adding more flour if your dough gets sticky. Peel off the top parchment layer, put your (GREASED) pie plate face down on the dough. Hold the pie plate and one hand under the parchment (use help if you have it!) and flip the pie plate right side up, making sure to keep the pie as flat and intact as possible. I did this in one go, so the method worked well for me! Use whatever works for you.",
      "3. Peel off the last sheet of parchment and fit your dough to the pan, using your hands to press into the pan. Choose your favorite pie crust design, I did a \"pinch\" design, shown visually here, along with other ideas.",
      "TO MAKE CARAMEL: Combine sugar and water over medium low heat in a medium saucepan until sugar dissolves. Add unsalted butter and bring mixture to a low boil. Let dissolve and keep at a low boil until mixture darkens to a copper color. (Note: this may take a while, don't turn up the heat! If it's too hot, it will burn and be ruined. Be patient)",
      "Once the mixture reaches it's golden color, remove from heat and slowly pour in heavy cream. The caramel will steam, so be careful -- it's hot. Bring saucepan back to the stove over very low heat and stir in sea salt. After 5 minutes, remove from heat and let cool for at least 30 minutes. (This recipe will make a large amount of caramel, you might have some leftover, but I made extra so I could drizzle on each pie slice upon serving. Plus, if you have leftover apples, you have yourself an indulgent snack.)",
      "FOR FILLING: Using a mandolin, slice your apples into paper thing slices and add to a large mixing bowl. Squeeze the juice of half a lemon and mix very carefully with your hands. Add sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg and salt. Mix again with your hands making sure not to damage your apples (we're making roses here!).",
      "To assemble roses: Lay out about 4-5 apple slices in a line. Once you lay one down, overlap the next one about 1/2 inch and continue doing so for each slice you add (overlapping each just slightly). Then, you will roll up the line of apple slices tightly making sure to carefully keep the \"rose\" in-tact. Place each rose in your pie and continue until filled! This process takes patience, but it's not hard. Just go slow, and experiment with adding different sizes or colors :)",
      "Once pie is chilled, add to 350 degree oven for 30-40 minutes or until crust is golden brown and apples are tender. Be sure to drizzle more caramel over top once pie is cooled and again before serving ;) Serve a la mode or with fresh whipped cream (or both)."

This has to happen slowly otherwise the edges would get burnt before it turns crispy, approx 7~10 min. The second it turns golden brown (one minute longer they will burn and become bitter), drain them through a fine sieve and leave on a paper towel. Reserve the oil.",
      "In a wok or skillet, heat up 4 tbsp of the ginger/garlic oil on high heat. Saute the chopped onion until the edges are browned. Add the ground beef and saute until nicely browned as well. The browning of the onion and beef is IMPORTANT in developing a deep rich flavor so take your time. Now add the 1/3 of the minced ginger, garlic and curry powder, and saute until fragrant. Add the cooked rice at this point. With 2 spatulas, press and turn the rice so that every grain is separated and coated in oil and curry powder. Microwave the Japanese curry bricks in a bowl until melted, approx 1 minute on high. Add the melted curry to the rice along with the coco powder, dashi granule and black pepper. Turn and flip with 2 spatulas until every rice is evenly coated.\r\n\r\nTo serve, add the crispy garlic and ginger on top. Add 1 egg yolk in the middle and a nub of unsalted butter to melt."

This is because coconut milk is sourced from all over the world and depending on where it's from and who the producer is, the fat content will vary. In that case, you can try to salvage by adding a bit of tapioca flour (1 to 4 tablespoons) during the whipping process. That has worked for me several times.

      "OPTIONAL FIRST STEP: One of the keys to a miraculously crispy skin is a VERY dry turkey. The best way to accomplish this is to air dry your turkey (in the refrigerator) for 1 to 2 days before you roast. I know this sounds a little crazy, and I do have the luxury of a second fridge at home, but I do it with my chickens too-and it makes a huge difference. Unwrap the turkey, rinse it, and pat it dry inside and out with paper towels. Then place the turkey onto a tray or into a roasting pan and refrigerate, uncovered, for 24 to 48 hours.",
      "Preheat your oven to 250\u00b0 F. Remove the wing tips or tuck them behind the turkey by bending them backwards and securing them near the neck. Tie the legs tightly together. Place the turkey on a roasting rack inside a roasting pan.",
      "Use your hands to evenly cover the outside of the turkey with the softened butter. Make sure to get the sides.",
      "Stuff the inside of the turkey with the lemon and herb sprigs. Season the turkey well with salt and pepper (inside and out). Pour the white wine into the base of the roasting pan.",
      "Roast the turkey, basting every hour or so (you can go 2 to 3 hours safely without basting, but every hour is best), until the skin is crisp and evenly golden, about 10 hours. (Basting often is the best way to ensure a crisp skin and a moist interior. You could not baste it as often, but the more you baste it, the crisper the skin, the more even the browning, and the juicier the interior.)\r\n\r\nAt this point the turkey can be safely cooled and held until you're ready to reheat and serve.",
      "Turn up the oven temperature to 375\u00b0 F. Roast the turkey for 40 minutes, until the skin is even crisper and more golden and the meat is fully cooked through. Let cool at least 15 to 30 minutes before carving."

      "We all know that dry scallops sear better than wet ones. I like to pat mine dry with a paper towel and allow them to sit in the fridge for about an hour, uncovered, before starting.",
      "You will need 2 saute pans or skillets going for this dish. One will be heated over medium heat (I used cast iron) to sear the scallops. The second (I used a small saute pan) will be used to crisp the scallions, cook the mushrooms, and finish the sauce. Start to finish, cooking time is about 10 minutes. You will want to have the sauce finished just as your scallops finish searing.",
      "If you've never used black truffle cream before, it's a great time to pick up a jar. I used Roland's Black Truffle Cream, which will run you about $10-$12 per jar. You don't use very much, and it's a very economical way to get truffles into your cooking without buying an actual truffle.",
      "First, melt the butter in the \"sauce\" pan. Add the scallions and cook as the butter froths, for about 3-4 minutes. The butter will brown a bit, but be careful not to burn it. Regulate your temperature and pull the pan off the heat if it is getting too hot. Remove the scallions with a slotted spoon and place on a paper towel to drain.",
      "Meanwhile, heat your skillet for searing and add just enough oil to cover the bottom of the pan with a thin layer. Lightly season the scallops with salt and black pepper, and place them into the pan. Using a pastry brush and 1 oz of Sambuca, brush the top of the cooking scallops with a layer of liquor just before you flip them so that the Sambuca cooks into the crust on the bottom. You are going to sear each side for about 4-5 minutes, until the scallops release and they have a nice crust. Use the remaining 1 oz of Sambuca to make yourself a refreshing Sambuca cocktail: 1 oz Sambuca, 2 oz water, served over crushed ice.",
      "When you flip the scallops, brush the already seared side with Sambuca.",
      "As the scallops are cooking, add the shiitake slices to the butter and brown quickly on each side. You should time this so that they brown just before your scallops are done. Remove from the butter and huddle them into a corner of the scallop pan to keep them warm.",
      "Quickly add the cream and the Black Truffle cream to the butter pan and whisk to incorporate. You won't have to thicken it much, but you will want to adjust the seasoning to taste (about 1/4 tsp of salt and pepper each).",
      "To plate, add a small pool of sauce to a plate, place the seared scallop on top. Add 2-3 shiitake slices and sprinkle the crispy scallions on top of the scallop. Serve immediately."

      "The night before, butterfly the pork (or have your butcher do it): Butterflying means to cut the meat open so that it lays in a flat even thickness. Cut through the thick part of the meat, horizontally to almost the edge. Unfold it to get a broad flap of meat, about 1 1/2 - 2 inches thick.",
      "Place pork on a baking sheet and liberally spread the Stubb's Pork Spice Rub over both sides of the flesh, massaging it in with your hands. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight.",

      "for the barbecue sauce\r\nIn a small saucepan, combine Stubb's Spicy Bar-B-Q Sauce, Stubb's Sticky Sweet Bar-B-Q Sauce, pineapple juice and worchestershire sauce. Heat to boiling and reduce heat to a simmer. Cook, uncovered until sauce reduces and thickens, about 15 minutes.",

      "After an hour, use the meat thermometer to check the temperature of the meat by inserting it into the thickest portion. When it reaches 125 degrees, turn the rest of the burners on and use direct heat for the remainder of the cooking. Grill the pork, watching for flare ups and turning the meat once or twice while cooking. You want to achieve an internal temperature of 165 degrees before pulling it off the grill.",
      "During the last 15 minutes of cooking, liberally brush the barbecue sauce over the meat. Cook for 5 or so minutes, then flip the meat and brush sauce on the other side. Cook for 5 minutes and flip again, so the sauce forms a nice crust on the meat.",
      "When the pork reaches 165 degrees, transfer it to a cutting board and tent with tin foil. Let the meat rest for 15 minutes so the juices can redistribute throughout the flesh.",
      "Meanwhile, grill the pineapple rings until you get some nice grill marks, flipping halfway through -- about 5-8 minutes. Transfer to a platter.",
      "Using a very sharp knife, slice the pork as thinly as possible across the grain.",
      "Place a pineapple ring on the bottom of a bun and top with a generous serving of sliced pork, followed by extra barbecue sauce, pickled onions and fresh cilantro leaves."

Make sure your second pot will fit inside of the pot with water in it and that you will be able to whisk inside of it without worrying about spilling water inside of it.",

      "Keep whisking in additional tablespoons of butter until you have incorporated all of it. Whisk in the lemon juice, salt, pepper, cayenne, paprika, and ground mustard. Taste and add more seasonings as needed. Turn off the heat, but keep the hollandaise in its pan sitting on top of the pot with the warm water in it to keep warm while you make the other components of this dish. You may have to add a teaspoon of milk or so if it thickens too much while you work (I did).",
      "Bring a large pot of water to almost-boiling, but not quite as this will overcook the eggs. Add just a splash of vinegar to the water (this is supposed to help. I've heard it's an old wives tale but it works for me so I keep doing it) and stir to combine.",
      "It is best to crack the eggs you will be using first into ramekins or those neat little silicone cups before your start poaching. This way, you aren't fumbling trying to crack eggs and delicately add them to the water.",
      "When your eggs are ready to go, take your utensil of choice (mine is a mesh covered scooping spatula usually used for frying) and start vigorously swirling the hot water. It should look like a whirlpool. Take your first ramekin with an egg in it, then dip it quickly and ever so slight in the swirling water, so that the water kind of scoops the egg out and takes it away (I will be honest; this just takes practice. Be prepared to screw up your first few eggs; it's okay!).",
      "Allow the eggs to swirl and cook (you can swirl the top of the water a bit if you need to keep the momentum going). The idea is that the swirling water will swirl the white around the yolk and cook while the yolk remains nice and runny. They should cook in the water for about 3 minutes, then pull them out gently and place them on a paper towel to drain any excess water, then gently use a utensil, your hands, or, what I find works best, which is to pick up the paper towel and carefully roll the egg out onto your latke. You can leave them on the towels, though, for 5 minutes or so while you finish everything up.",
      "If you are poaching your eggs, this is the point at which you should start heating your water to a simmer in a separate pot. Alright, now the latkes. Peel and grate your squash. You can cut it up and use the proper food processor blades to do this, but I didn't feel like getting yet another appliance out, so I just used a bit of elbow grease and grated it on a box grater, along with the cleaned leeks. Toss together, then squeeze as much liquid out of the mixture as possible by pressing down on it with paper towels. You won't get much, so don't spend too long on this.",
      "Add in the eggs, cornstarch, flour, and spices. Heat a heavy bottomed cast iron pan with about 2 tablespoons of oil over medium-high heat. Use a 2-tablespoon sized cookie scoop (or just scoop with a large spoon) and scoop the squash and leek mixture onto the skillet. The scoops should sizzle immediately. If they don't, your pan isn't hot enough. Allow the latkes to cool on one side for about 3-4 minutes as they are, them flip them and smash them down with your spatula. Allow them to go for another 3-4 minutes, until they are crispy and golden on both sides. Make sure your remove them from the pan and place on a paper towel lined plate for at least a minute before serving so the oil can drain from them.",
      "Just as a recap, I recommend making the sauce first, then heating your water while you prep your latkes, then while your latkes cook, poach your eggs.",
      "When you're ready to eat, place your latkes on your plate, top with a poached egg, and drizzle with a spoonful of hollandaise. Crack a little black pepper on top for garnish and serve warm. The latkes recipe make about 12 good sized latkes, so you will technically have enough food for 4 people, depending on how hungry you are."

    "title": "very imprecise sourdough bread method",
    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "first thing in the morning, OR right before bed (about 8 hours before you'll mix your dough): feed your starter as you normally would; I feed mine entirely with rye flour, a 50/50 mix of white and whole wheat flours is also great",
      "selecting your flours: I've found sourdough benefits from a combination of flours to control fermentation and flavor. If you're working with just regular flour from the grocery store, which is what I almost always do, definitely mix in at least some percentage of whole wheat or grain flour, like regular WW, spelt, rye, buckwheat, etc. A formula that works particularly well for me is: 3C white flour, 3C whole wheat flour, 2/3C rye flour. Definitely don't go over 60% whole wheat until you're feeling really confident! Bread flour is great too in place of white flour and makes your kneading easier, it's just a little pricey.",
      "Once you've chosen your flours, in your largest mixing bowl mix all of the flour and all of the water. I just stir using clean hands. Mix until all of the flour is hydrated by the water, and if you need more water add it in little bits at a time. Wetter dough will give you a more open and spongy texture, but will also be harder to work with, so err on the side of less water if you're new to sourdough.",
      "Scrape down the sides of the bowl with a spatula and leave the dough mix to rest for about an hour, covered at room temperature. Tip: plastic shower caps make great rinseable and re-usable bowl covers.",
      "At the tail end of the hour of resting, get your starter which should by now have risen to its full height and be falling back down. You can tell if there's a line of residue above the line of volume of the starter, indicating that at one point the volume was higher. You should see lots of bubbles. Scoop out half of your starter and drop it in to the bowl of dough. Feed the remaining starter and put back at room temperature if you'll bake again this week, or into the fridge if you wont.",
      "Mix the starter with the dough by pinching and folding until it's no longer visible. Now you're ready to start kneading. Many sourdough folks say not to knead the dough, but this has always worked for me and produced a great bread. We build up the gluten in this step so that as the dough ferments, it has \"rungs on a ladder\" to keep climbing up and rising. That's how I understand it, anyway!",
      "To knead, you'll basically be stretching and folding the dough. I do this by putting my hand underneath the whole mass of dough, scooping half of it up, pulling it up and stretching it, then folding it back down on itself. Then I give the bowl a quarter turn and repeat. I do this for 10-15 minutes which can get tedious and difficult, but it's worth it!",
      "You can use the \"windowpane\" test to see when your bread is done; basically you stretch a small piece of dough between the index and thumb of both hands, and if you can stretch it thin like a windowpane without it breaking, it's ready. If it's like, 80% there I'd say it's fine too, I often call off kneading at that stage.",
      "Add the salt to the dough and knead to combine. If you're adding mix-ins to the dough, here is where you do that as well. Make sure that any dried fruit has been soaked almost to the point of being rehydrated, and drained.",
      "Cover the bowl again and leave to ferment at room temperature first and then in the fridge. How long you do each sort of depends on your temperature at home. If it's very warm in your house, do around an hour or two at room temp, then ~12-14 hours in the fridge. If it's cold, do the full overnight at room temp. It's hard to get this part exactly right and I've found fussing over it to be almost never worth it. You're aiming for around 12 hours of rest but adding on some time if your dough is in the fridge. My normal here in Philly is ~6 hours at room temp and ~8 hours in the fridge overnight, bake early the following morning.",
      "An hour before you bake preheat the oven to 500 degrees and put a pan somewhere in the oven filled with tap water. This will create the steam needed to get a shiny crispy crust.",
      "Cover a baking sheet with parchment paper. I freeform shape both loaves and bake them together on one sheet, just for speed and convenience, but you could shape one, bake it on its own, and then shape the other.",
      "Now you're ready to shape the dough. You'll divide it in half and shape one half at a time in to two rounds. This video from \"Bread monk\" really illustrates what I do, but you basically want to hold the dough mass in the air and form it in to a ball by slowly stretching the top and sides downward to the bottom, creating surface tension. Don't put the dough down on any surface unless it's *covered* in flour because it will be very sticky. Once it's shaped, place it on the cookie sheet as far over to one side as you can, then repeat with the other dough mass on the other side of the sheet. If you *have* the time to let the shaped loaves sit for ~30 minutes to an hour, let them, but if not that's OK too https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8J50Ad0KGvw",
      "Slash the top of each loaf with a sharp knife or razor blade, just a simple slash down the middle or a curved one on either side of the top will do. This allows steam to escape while baking so that the bread holds its shape. Do this the instant before you put the loaves in to bake.",
      "Every oven is different so it's hard to advise on baking times and temps. I like to do 20 minutes at 500 degrees, then the remaining time at 450 or 425 if it looks like it's really cooking, usually another 40 minutes. Start with this method and adjust as you need for your own oven. The bread is done when it's deeply brown all over, if you used whole grains it might even look almost burned, and knocking on the bottom of the loaf with your knuckles produces a \"hollow\" open sound, not a dense short sound.",
      "Leave the bread to cool on a wire rack; it should be completely cooled before you cut in to it, which is the worst part about this whole process. If it's mostly cool, you can leave it to cool the rest of its time in the fridge. I always store bread in the fridge, wrapped in a paper bag.",
      "This is the process and method that I've found consistently works for me, I hope it works for you too! Once you know what the dough is \"supposed\" to look like you can experiment with different kinds of flours, mix ins, levels of hydration, etc. I just made a bread where I used canned pumpkin to supply some of the hydration, and that worked beautifully! Enjoy!",
      "Troubleshooting: \r\nDough too wet after fermenting? Dough stuck to everything and it's a big mess? \r\nScrape it all down, bake in one big blob on a cookie sheet, call it focaccia, you're a hero ! Or, line a loaf pan with parchment and bake as stated above.\r\n\r\nBread \"exploded\" in the oven? \r\nIf the top looks neat and tidy but the bottom looks cracked and blown out, it literally did explode in the oven, and the yeast had nowhere to go! Next time, try cutting a deeper slash into the top of the bread before baking.\r\n\r\nReady to mix in?\r\nThis formula can handle ~1 C of mix-ins, which is fun! Cheese, olives, scallions, chili oil, rehydrated dried fruit, nuts, seeds, all make great add-ins. The top photo was made with canned pumpkin replacing some of the water until the initial mix achieved the right texture!"

      "Place the whole unshelled egg in a small heatproof bowl and pour in boiling water to cover. Let the egg sit, submerged, for 1 minute. (Coddling the egg this way begins to set the protein in the whites, helping the emulsification process and minimizing the bacteria on the shell.) Remove the egg from the water, crack it, separate the white from the yolk, place the yolk in the bowl in which you will be making the aioli, and discard the white.",
      "Combine the olive oil and the neutral oil in a squeeze bottle or flexible plastic container (see the recipe introduction). Grip the whisk handle where it meets the wires, not at the top of the handle, and begin whisking the yolk with your dominant hand. When the yolk is broken up and smooth, start to very slowly-a drop or two at a time-add the mixed oils in a very fine stream while whisking constantly (see the photo, page 33). Stop pouring periodically while continuing to whisk to ensure proper emulsification. Keep your elbow glued to your waist as you whisk and let all of the motion come from your wrist. If your arm gets tired, it's fine to take a break for a few seconds, but make sure you've also stopped adding oil. You don't have to, nor do you want to, work fast-it's more important to whisk and pour consistently and slowly. If you do pour in too much oil at once, whisk very rapidly for a few seconds to combine.",
      "I have found that 1 egg yolk can hold about 1/3 cup of oil before it hits its saturation point and starts to take on a slightly stringy or taffy-like appearance, usually after about 2 minutes of whisking. This is a critical point, and when it happens, use your fingertips to sprinkle about 1/2 teaspoon of the diluted lemon juice over the mixture to thin it out. Resume whisking and drizzling oil until the mixture becomes \"tight\" again, then add another scant 1 teaspoon diluted lemon juice and the garlic paste. Repeat until all of the oil and diluted lemon juice have been emulsified into the mixture. Finally, stir in the salt, starting with 1/4 teaspoon and adding up to 1/2 teaspoon or as needed.",
      "The aioli will keep in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 2 days."

      "Place the raisins in a bowl with enough warm water to cover; let sit for 1 1/2 hours. Drain raisins thoroughly, reserving the liquid.",
      "Warm about 3/4 cups of the liquid until tepid (stick a finger in it, it shouldn't feel cool or warm), pour into a bowl and stir the yeast and sugar into it. Let stand in a warmish spot in the kitchen for about 10 minutes or until the mixture begins to look creamy (even foamy if it's warm enough). Add the softened butter and about half of the flour. Stir to combine, then add the rest of the flour and the salt. Mix the dough by hand until soft, silky and elastic, a few minutes (note, depending on the dough you may find that it is quite sticky, dusting with flour can help you mix the dough at this stage but don't worry too much about the stickiness at this point, mix with a spoon if you prefer not to get hands sticky). You can also do this with a machine, but it's so easy and comes together so quickly I find doing it by hand to be the simplest and most satisfying.",
      "Place the dough in a large, olive oil-greased bowl covered with plastic wrap or a tea towel and let rise at room temperature until doubled in size, 1-2 hours, depending on how warm your kitchen environment is. In the meantime, pat the raisins dry and dust with a couple of tablespoons of flour.",
      "The dough should now be soft and puffed (and if previously sticky, now less so, though still expect a bit of tackiness in areas where not dusted with flour). Place the dough on a floured surface, flatten it gently and shape into a rectangular shape. Sprinkle about a third of the raisins over the dough and roll it up, tucking in the sides-it's best to roll it along the length so you have a long roll as you want to end up with a long loaf. Dust the surface again with flour, flatten the dough again and sprinkle over another third of the raisins. Roll up, tucking in the sides so raisins don't fall out. If it becomes too tight to work with, Carol Field suggests letting the dough rest for about 10-15 minutes (under a tea towel so it doesn't dry out), before adding the final third of the raisins. If your dough is very soft and still manageable, you won't need to wait.",
      "To form the dough, with the last addition of raisins, roll up the dough into a long, plump loaf, tucking the ends in well underneath the loaf. Lift the loaf onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Cover with a tea towel and let rise an hour.",
      "When ready to bake, heat oven to 450\u00b0F (230\u00b0C). Place the bread on a bottom shelf and after 5 minutes, turn the heat down to 400\u00b0F (200\u00b0C) and continue baking 30-40 minutes longer or until a dark brown crust forms. Cool completely on a rack. This is easier to cut when it is a day or more old. Stored wrapped in parchment paper, or in plastic, it keeps very, very well, at least a week but I've never been able to resist keeping a slice of this bread uneaten longer than that."

Spread two teaspoons of the beef mixture in a thin layer on top of the pancake, then scoop another tablespoon of the pancake mixture to close it up. Flatten it out as much as possible, then continue forming pancakes quickly to fill up the griddle. I did 6 at a time. Cook them for 5 minutes on the first side, then flip them over to cook for another 5 minutes. Remove them to a plate and tent them with foil to keep them hot. Repeat with two more batches to make 18 pancakes total. If the griddle gets too brown, wipe it down between batches and use the other fresh tablespoon of butter.

    "directions": [
      "Preheat oven to 350. Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper. (Bake one batch at a time--this recipe makes two batches, about 18 cookies). Mix 1 1/2 teaspoon of Ener-G Egg Replacer with 2 tablespoons warm water in a small bowl, whisking well, then set aside. Mix the dry ingredients together in a medium bowl: flour, cocoa, salt, baking powder and baking soda and set aside. In a large bowl, mix the butter and sugar together with a hand mixer until fluffy. Add mixed Ener-G Egg Replacer and pure vanilla extract and mix until creamy. Add the dry ingredients in thirds with a large spoon to the wet ingredients--use your hand to mix until it all comes together. (Note: If you over mix, your cookies will turn out hard.) Now, shape the dough into 1\" balls. Place on cookie sheet. Now, take your pinky and punch a little hole into the center of each ball--no need to go through the entire cookie. Just a hole to hold the peanut butter. Take the peanut butter and place in a zip lock baggie. Cut a hole on one end and (tying the other end with a twistie to keep it from coming out all over your hand)--dab each hole with about a teaspoon of peanut butter. Bake for 8 minutes. (They may seem a bit undercooked, this is okay, they will continue to bake on the cookie sheet as they cool.) Remove from oven and set aside. Meanwhile, make your ganache (which can be put on the cookies while they are warm, it will settle into a firm topping as cookies cool). Take a spoon and dip into the ganache and just hold it over each cookie and drizzle with ganache--allow a little bit of the peanut butter to peek out. Let cookies cool completely and store in an airtight container."

      "To prepare the pastry, combine the flour, salt, and butter pieces in a large bowl. (Make sure the butter pieces are 1 /4 inch or smaller.) Add 6 tablespoons of the water and mix with a fork just until the dough comes together. Add 1 to 2 more tablespoons water if you need to, but stop before the dough gets too wet. Turn the mixture out onto a lightly floured work surface. It should just hold together when you squeeze it in your hand. With a lightly floured rolling pin, shape the dough into a 12- by 6-inch rectangle with a short side nearest you.",
      "Fold the dough into thirds like a letter. (Fold the bottom third up and then the top third down over the bottom third.) Use a bench scraper to help lift and fold the dough if necessary. At this point, the dough will be very rough and shaggy. As you roll and fold the dough it will come together. Rotate the dough so that the folded edge is to the left. Repeat rolling and folding two more times, lightly flouring the surface as necessary. Wrap the dough tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour. Repeat the entire process one more time for a grand total of six turns. Wrap the dough well and refrigerate until cold, about 4 hours or up to 2 days. Alternatively, freeze the dough, well wrapped, for up to 1 month.",
      "Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Divide the dough into two equal pieces. Working with one piece at a time, roll the dough on a lightly floured surface into an 8- by 15-inch rectangle. Cut the dough into twelve 4- by 2 1 /2-inch rectangles. Put the rectangles on the prepared sheet and lay another piece of parchment on top. Repeat with the remaining dough. Cover the sheet with plastic wrap and refrigerate the dough on the sheet until ready to use.",
      "Preheat the oven to 400\u00b0 F. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper. In a small bowl, make an egg wash by whisking together the egg yolk and a splash of water. Lay out 6 dough rectangles on one of the prepared sheets. Dollop about 2 tablespoons of jam in the center of each rectangle. Brush the edges with some of the egg wash and top with another dough rectangle, pressing the edges with a fork to seal. With a paring knife, make a little slit in each pie to vent steam. Chill the assembled pies for 20 minutes.",
      "Repeat with the remaining dough and filling on the other prepared baking sheet. Brush the tops of the chilled pies with egg wash. Bake until puffed and golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes. Repeat with the remaining pies. Let the pies cool slightly on a rack.",
      "To prepare the glaze, whisk together the confectioners' sugar, cream cheese, and vanilla in a small bowl. Whisk in enough milk to make a thick glaze. Drizzle over the warm pies. Serve the pastries warm or at room temperature. These are really best the day they're made, but you can store leftovers in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days. Unglazed pies can be reheated in the oven on low heat."

      "Place the meat on a middle rack in the smoker and smoke at 225\u00b0F for about 4 hours, pausing to refill the water pan and recharge the smoke tray with fresh wood chips about three times (I do this on the hour). After 4 hours, the pork should have an internal temperature of 150\u00b0F, but it isn't necessary.",
      "Prepare a large (at least 7 quarts) enameled cast iron Dutch oven or a large crock pot for the braise: Place the sliced onion and apples in the bottom, sprinkle on the reserved 2tsp of dry rub and crushed juniper berries (use a mortar and pestle or the side of a chef's knife) and pour in the vinegar and Calvados. Place the pork on top of the bed of apples/onions and pour in any juices that collected in the pan while in the smoker.",
      "Cover with the lid and braise for at least 4 hours and up to 20 hours over low heat on the stovetop or high heat in a crock pot. Aim for a constant low boil. If you want to speed the cooking process for a shorter braise, cut the large chunk of meat into 4-8 smaller chunks in the pot.",
      "After about 4 hours, the meat should be tender enough to \"pull\" by simply stirring it with tongs. Remove the bone at this point. If it isn't soft enough yet to separate, give it more time and heat. If a lot of liquid has built up, crack the lid for the final hour of cooking and stir often to reduce and concentrate the juices. This is harder to accomplish in a crock pot because most products don't supply enough heat to keep a boil with the lid cracked. That's the main reason I prefer stovetop preparation. If you just can't get the juice reduced, pull some off with a ladle and keep it for another use such as a soup or the accompanying barbecue sauce.",
      "Adjust the salt, acid, and sweet seasoning as desired before serving. I often mix in half a cup of barbecue sauce to further moisten and flavor the meat.",
      "Melt butter in a 1-2 quart saucepan over medium-high heat. Add onion, white pepper, a few pinches of salt, baking soda, and 1 tsp of the brown sugar. Stir and let it cook uncovered until the onions start to brown and stick to the pot a little (7-10 minutes).",
      "Have some water handy in a small cup. Pour in about 2 tsp of water, and deglaze the browned bits from the bottom of the pan using a flat-tipped wooden spoon. Let the onions cook and brown again undisturbed (but watch carefully--don't let them burn!) for about 5 minutes. Repeat the water deglazing. Again repeat the browning rest and deglazing a third time until a deep brown-colored paste is achieved. If you think it can get darker without burning, go for a fourth rest and deglaze.",
      "Now add half the apples with a little salt, stir, add a little water and quickly close the lid. This rapidly steams a portion of the apples and speeds up the breakdown process.",
      "After 5 minutes, remove the lid, add the remaining apples, cider vinegar, remaining brown sugar, smoked paprika, and allspice. Stir and continue to cook over medium-high heat while watching carefully to prevent burning.",
      "Once the apples are browned and starting to disintegrate (5-10 minutes later), add the pork braising juice or stock and cook for another 5-10 minutes. For a sweeter sauce, add molasses (my favorite), honey, maple syrup or any combination thereof. A tablespoon of ketchup or two is optional but really ties the flavors together well. Remove from heat and puree with an immersion blender then try a taste test. Adjust with salt, cider vinegar, or brown sugar as needed."

      "Rub a tablespoon or two of oil inside a large bowl. (This is where the dough will proof.)",
      "In another large bowl, whisk together the flour, salt, sugar, and yeast. Make a well in the center, then add the warm water. Using one clean hand, start to mix with the dry ingredients until a dry, shaggy dough begins to form. Add the wine. Continue to mix until a wet mound forms.",
      "Turn out the dough onto a surface very lightly sprinkled with flour (like, no more than a few tablespoons). Clean and lightly oil your hands. Knead the dough for about 3 minutes by lifting the furthest end of the dough, stretching into the air, and folding forward. Repeat with the nearest end of the dough, pulling up into the air, and folding backward onto the dough ball. Now again with the far end, and so on. (You can add a tiny bit more flour judiciously beneath the dough as absolutely needed, but the less you add, the airier your final crumb will be. A dough scraper is a big help with overly sticky edges.) After about 3 minutes of this, your dough should be more tightly elastic and able to roughly hold a ball shape (it'll still be tacky, though). Stop here-we don't want to over-knead, since our proofing period will be short.",
      "Use a dough scraper to transfer the ball to the oiled bowl. Gently flip it over, so the whole ball is coated in oil. Cover the bowl with a dish towel. Set somewhere warm (like, next to-but not right on top of-your preheating oven) to rise for 25 minutes. It will have grown in this time, but won't have fully doubled-and in this case, that's totally fine!",
      "Feel free to put this dough toward your favorite pizza recipe. Here's how I like to use it:\r\n\r\nWhile the dough is proofing, preheat your oven to between 500\u00b0F and 525\u00b0F. Coat the bottom and sides of an 18x13-inch sheet pan with a few tablespoons of olive oil, and gently stretch the dough to fill the pan (the gentler, the better since we're not really doing a second proof)-stretch it a little bit extra, because it'll slink back into itself as it sits. Let the stretched dough sit in the pan for about 10 minutes to give it a chance to puff back up a bit. Then, drizzle it with a little more olive oil (you can use what was leftover in your proofing bowl) and sprinkle with salt, and proceed to gently top it. \r\n\r\nToppings-wise, figure 1 cup your favorite red sauce or pureed canned tomatoes with a big pinch each of salt and red pepper flakes, and about 12 ounces of sliced, shredded, or grated low-moisture mozzarella. Go crazy with other adornments-some of my favorites are jalapenos sliced into rings with pepperoni or bacon, and slices of yellow onion with mushrooms. I also love to swap some of the mozzarella out for Taleggio. If you're adding anything more delicate (e.g., spinach, or super thinly sliced garlic, or little dollops of fresh herb pesto), do so midway through the bake time to avoid burning.\r\n\r\nIn terms of cook time, depending on oven temperature, you'll need somewhere between 12 and 16 minutes. Check in on your pie from time to time and adjust oven temperature as needed-you want crust that's crisp and golden all around the edges, and cheese that has bubbled up and become dotted with brown spots."
