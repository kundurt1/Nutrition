You can add a little bit of water (about half a cup) to your mix, then you put on the lid on the pot and let it cook for about 20-30 minutes, and keep an eye on it, stirring every once in a while. Remember: no oil at all in the filling otherwise you Samosas will open. When the veggies are nice and soft and a little creamy turn off the heat and move them to a dish and let them cool down.",
      "While the filling cools down you can make the dough. Get yourself a large bowl. Mix the flour with salt and gradually add water and knead until the dough is homogeneous. You'll know when it's ready when it sticks to your hand but you can take it off. At this point add two tbsp of olive oil and I keep kneading again until you get a nice ball. Cover it with a clean kitchen cloths and let it rest for 30-60 minutes.",
      "Now you can prepare the \"glue\" to close the samosas. In a small sauce pan bring to boil half a cup of water, then add one tbsp of white flour and stir until all lumps are gone. Put a spoon inside it and take it out, if the solution is too runny add a little more flour and mix well. Take it off the heat and let it cool down. You will need this batter to seal your samosas.",
      "Cover a tray with flour and take small pieces of dough and shape them into walnut-size balls. This amount of dough makes 6-7 balls, and each of which makes two samosas. Put a crepe pan or a non-sticking large pan on the heat. Cover your worktop with flour. Take a ball of dough and press its edges between your fingertips and the palm of your hand until you get a small disk. Place it on the worktop and put some more flour on it and start rolling it away from you. Now you must have a vertical oval shape. Flip the dough and turn it 90 degrees. Sprinkle more flour and roll away from you until you get a circle. Repeat this operation of flipping, turning and rolling until you get a really thin dough looking like flat bread or Naan. Now very carefully take this dough and place it quickly on the hot pan, opening any eventual foldings, wait some seconds and then flip it. If your careful enough you can do this step just with hands, no other utensils are needed. Remember that in this step we are not actually cooking the dough, so it literally stays some seconds on the hot pan for each side. This makes tiny bubbles appear in your samosa. Place it on a dish. Repeat everything with each ball of dough.",
      "Now put 3 or 4 of your flatbreads on top of each other where they match most in shape. Place a large bowl or plate on them upside down, and cut around the plate with a sharp knife in order to get perfect circles. Unfortunately you need to discard the leftovers. Any ideals to recycle these bits of dough?",
      "Now cut the circles in half. Each semicircle will make one samosa. You need to make cones. First hold the semicircle in the palm of your left hand (if your right handed) with the curved side facing up, fold gently the right corner towards the left side and with your index finger of the right hand put a little glue near the edge on the part you have folded. Put some more glue on the length of the left corner. Now that the both side have glue on them place the glued press them together to seal it. Now you must have a cone. Be careful not to leave an opening at the bottom point of the cone.",
      "Spoon the filling inside the cone. Don't over-fill the cone otherwise your samosas will open, one spoon-full should be enough. Put a little more glue inside the cone opening and seal two sides, making a triangle. Your samosa is ready to be baked or fried. Fill and seal all of your 12-14 samosas. It may sound complicated but it's not.",
      "ut a baking parchment on a tray and place the samosas on it. Pour about 2 tbsp of olive oil in small bowl and using a pastry brush give your samosas a quick and slight oil wash. Since you are baking them rather than frying them, this step helps to make them tender yet crispy while keep them light and healthy. Bake in the oven for about ten minutes on one side, then turn them, give them a quick oil wash on the side and bake them some more. Keep an eye on them, because the baking time changes from oven to oven, you want them to look well baked but being as thin as they are, they wouldn't need much time too cook. Serve with the chutney on the side."

    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "Heat oven to 475\u00b0F. Poke potatoes all over with a fork. Rub the skins with 1 tablespoon oil, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Place on a parchment-lined baking tray and bake for 45 to 50 minutes (for sweet potatoes, check after 40 minutes), until skins are crispy and you can insert a knife into the center with very little resistance beyond the skin. You can do this a few hours in advance, and just let them sit out at room temperature until you're ready to proceed.",
      "While the potatoes are baking, prepare the garlicky Greek yogurt and the mushroom bacon. For the yogurt, in a large mixing bowl, whisk together Greek yogurt with 1 teaspoon salt, lemon juice, and garlic. Taste, and adjust seasoning accordingly with more salt and/or lemon juice. Reserve 1/4 cup of the garlicky Greek yogurt for garnish-leave the rest in the large mixing bowl for use when the potatoes come out of the oven.",
      "Prep the mushroom bacon. On a rimmed sheet pan, toss the mushrooms with 1/4 cup oil (they'll absorb it). Sprinkle over the mushrooms: 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1/2 teaspoon black pepper, and 1/4 teaspoon Cayenne pepper. Toss until evenly coated. Spread out so they're not touching one another, otherwise, they'll steam.",
      "Once the potatoes are ready to come out, remove from oven and turn the oven temperature down to 375\u00b0F. After 10 minutes or so, add the sheet pan of mushrooms. Bake for 35 to 40 minutes in total, flipping once midway through, until they're crispy and browned with just the slightest spot of chewiness remaining in the center. (You're going to end up adding the potatoes back into the oven with the mushrooms, too, so leave them shelf space.)",
      "Let the potatoes cool a couple minutes, until you can handle them. Cut each in half lengthwise, and scoop out most of the softened flesh, leaving about 1/4-inch around the inner peels, and transfer to the large mixing bowl of garlicky Greek yogurt. (Note: if you're using one sweet and one savory potato, do this step in separate bowls to keep them separate with half of the other ingredients, each.) Leave the potato skins on the cooking sheet. Add 3/4 cup chopped scallions and 1/2 cup Parmesan to the bowl. Mix the potato flesh with the yogurt, scallions, and Parmesan until everything is smooth and combined. Taste and add additional salt, if needed to make the flavors pop. Spoon the mashed potato mixture back into the potato skins, sprinkle the tops with remaining Parmesan, and bake for 15 to 20 minutes (along with the mushroom bacon), until cheese on top of potatoes is fully melted and bubbling.",
      "The potatoes and mushroom bacon should finish cooking around roughly the same time. Remove each from oven when done. For the best mix of final textures, put the potatoes under the broiler for 1 minute, until the cheese is dotted with brown spots. To serve, top each potato half with a generous dollop of reserved garlicky Greek yogurt, some of the mushroom bacon (break it up with your hands if the pieces are too large), and a sprinkling of chopped scallion."

      "Preheat your oven at 350 degrees F. Spray with non-stick or smear with butter (I don't have a preference here...if I'm feeling lazy I'll spray. It just feels easier) your mini-bundt pan. These are PERFECT to take to school for your kids. But here's a tip...this recipe makes 36 mini cakes. Unless you have a lot of time on your hands, I suggest you pick up two or three pans. You don't have to, I only have one. It's just an investment in your time with the baking and cooling cycle of each batch. One last note...even though they are non-stick, I spray with non-stick. I don't think you're supposed to...but I do. I'm a little paranoid about my baked goods sticking.",
      "Mix your milk and vinegar and set aside.",
      "In another bowl, combine the flour, cornstarch, baking soda, baking powder and salt in a bowl.",
      "Cream your butter and sugar in an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment until they are light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. While this is creaming, zest and juice your lemons for the cake.",
      "Place the lemon juice and vanilla in with the milk and vinegar...let them mingle a bit.",
      "Add the eggs, scraping down the sides to make sure everything is blended well. Then throw in your lemon zest. Now take a big whiff. Doesn't this smell amazing? I just want to swim in it.",
      "Add half of the milk mixture to the creamed butter and eggs. Then add half of the flour. Then the rest of the milk mixture. Lastly, throw in the last of the flour. I always stop the electric mixer when it still looks like it needs more mixing, and then hand mix the remaining so that I don't overwork my flour. It's a delicate little flower that can't handle too much activity. Much like myself.",
      "Now, here comes the part you must follow me on and this is just the type of recipe detail I would ignore and have a disaster on my hands. When you're filling up the mini-bundt pan, just fill them half way. I used half of a 1/4 cup for each mini cake. That's about two tablespoons of batter and it hardly seems like enough. But my first batch was spilling out all over the pan and it wasn't pretty. And what's the point in baking if it's not going to be pretty?",
      "Definitely pick the pan up and drop it on your counter a couple of times to get rid of any bubbles in the batter. Again, think pretty final product.",
      "Place them in the center of the oven and bake for about 15 minutes. You want them to have that light tan thing happening...I'm thinking Kate Winslet, mid-summer.",
      "When you grab these out of the oven, let them sit and cool. Don't force them out. Give them at least thirty minutes of uninterrupted rest. A little cat nap. One hour is ideal. Run a butter knife or very thin spatula along the side. Flip them over onto a cooling rack and tap them on the bottom a bit. Slowly pull up and they should fall out. While they finish cooling...you can move onto the schmooey...",
      "For the Glaze...Put all the glaze ingredients in the stand mixer bowl fitted with the whisk attachment and whisk away. I always pour a little less than the recommended liquid in at first to see how everything is coming together. Then slowly add in the remainder until you get the desired consistency. For me, I like it to be on the thicker side. I want it to hit the cake and slowly slide down the sides.",
      "BUT, before you glaze up, you should sprinkle with the powdered sugar. Use a sieve because it will look the best...weightless and ethereal. There's something angelic about these little cakes, don't you agree? And what grade schooler wouldn't want these? Actually, who, in general, wouldn't want these?",
      "Now you can glaze them. This is a lot of sugar happening...I did this on parchment paper because I didn't want the glaze-schmooey-powdered sugar trio all over the counter. Remember, cleaning sucks.",
      "Here's the best part...this same recipe will make a real-world sized cake. So you basically just broke a cake down into 36 individual bites. So when you want a second one, don't hesitate. I'm thinking you could have at least five before it equates one slice? Don't you agree?"

Add more water only after most of the last ladle has mostly absorbed or evaporated. After about 15-20 minutes your rice will plump up and you will have a creamy rice-y thing going on. Taste a rice kernel - a few minutes before it's a perfect al dente, stir in the mustard a tablespoon at a time, tasting each time. I liked 3, but you might want a bit more or a bit less.

    "title": "parisian macarons",
    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "To make the macarons: If you are going to bake the macarons on baking sheets lined with parchment paper, you might want to make a template. Using a cookie cutter as your guide, trace circles about 1 1/2 inches in diameter on each sheet of paper, leaving about 2 inches between them, then turn the papers over on the baking sheets. If you're using silicone mats, there's nothing to do but line the baking sheets with them. Fit a large pastry bag with a plain 1/2-inch tip. (Alternatively, you can use a zipper-lock bag -- fill the bag, seal it and snip off a corner.)",
      "Place a strainer over a large bowl and press the almond flour and confectioners' sugar through the mesh. This is a tedious job, but much depends on it, so be assiduous. Then whisk to blend.",
      "Put half of the egg whites in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment.",
      "Add food coloring, if you're using it, to the remaining egg whites, stir and then pour the whites over the almond flour and confectioners' sugar. Using a flexible spatula, mix and mash the whites into the dry ingredients until you have a homogeneous paste.",
      "Bring the granulated sugar and water to a boil in a small saucepan over medium heat. If there are spatters on the sides of the pan, wash them down with a pastry brush dipped in cold water. Insert a candy thermometer and cook the syrup until it reaches 243 to 245\u00b0 F. (This can take about 10 minutes.)",
      "Meanwhile, beat the egg whites on medium speed until they hold medium-firm peaks. Reduce the mixer speed to low and keep mixing until the sugar syrup comes up to temperature.",
      "When the sugar syrup reaches the right temperature, take the pan off the heat and remove the thermometer. With the mixer on low speed, pour in the hot syrup, trying to pour it between the whirring whisk and the side of the bowl. You'll have spatters -- it's impossible not to -- but ignore them; whatever you do, don't try to incorporate them into the meringue. Raise the mixer speed to high and beat until the meringue cools to room temperature, about 10 minutes -- you'll be able to tell by touching the bottom of the bowl.",
      "Give the almond flour mixture another turn with the spatula, then scrape the meringue over it and fold everything together. Don't be gentle here: Use your spatula to cut through the meringue and almond mixture, bring some of the batter from the bottom up over the top and then press it against the side of the bowl. The action is the same as the one you used to get the egg whites into the almonds and sugar: mix and mash. Keep folding and mixing and mashing until when you lift the spatula, the batter flows off it in a thick band, like lava. If you want to add more food coloring, do it now.",
      "Spoon half of the batter into the pastry bag (or zipper-lock bag) and, holding the bag vertically 1 inch above one of the baking sheets, pipe out 1 1/2-inch rounds. Don't worry if you have a point in the center of each round -- it will dissolve into the batter. Holding the baking sheet with both hands, raise it about 8 inches above the counter and let it fall (unnerving but necessary to de-bubble the batter and promote smooth tops). Refill the bag, pipe batter onto the second sheet and drop it onto the counter.",
      "Set the baking sheets aside in a cool, dry place to allow the batter to form a crust. When you can gingerly touch the top of the macarons without having batter stick to your finger, you're ready to bake. (Depending on room temperature and humidity, this can take 15 to 30 minutes, sometimes more.) While the batter is crusting, center a rack in the oven and preheat the oven to 350\u00b0 F.",
      "Bake the macarons, one sheet at a time, for 6 minutes. Rotate the pan and bake for another 6 to 9 minutes, or until the macarons can be lifted from the mat or can be carefully peeled away from the paper. The bottoms will feel just a little soft. Slide the silicone mat or parchment off the baking sheet onto a counter and set aside to cool to room temperature. Repeat with the second baking sheet of macarons.",
      "Peel the macarons off the silicone or parchment and match them up for sandwiching.",
      "To sandwich the macarons: Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. You can use a teaspoon or a piping bag to fill the macarons. It's up to you to decide how much filling you'll want to use; some pastry chefs use enough filling to form a layer about half as high as one of the shells and others make the filling as tall as a shell, so they've got equal layers of shell, filling and shell. Spoon or pipe some filling onto the flat side of a macaron and sandwich it with its mate, gently twisting the top macaron until the filling spreads to the edges. Repeat with the remaining macarons and filling, then put the macarons on the baking sheet and cover with plastic film. (Or, if it's easier for you, pack the macs into a container.) Chill for at least 24 hours, or for up to 4 days.",
      "Serving: Macarons are usually served as an afternoon treat with tea or coffee or after dinner or sometimes even after dessert. Take them out of the refrigerator about 30 minutes before serving.\r\nStoring: You must keep the macarons refrigerated for 1 day before serving, and they can stay in the fridge for up to 4 days. They can also be frozen, packed airtight, for up to 2 months; defrost, still wrapped, overnight in the refrigerator"

      "(Important note: I don't include volume measurements for the flour or liquids in this recipe because variations in weight with those two ingredients can make a noticeable difference in the outcome of the bread. A cup of all-purpose flour, commercial white whole wheat flour, and freshly ground white whole wheat flour all have different weights for the same amount of volume, and the method people use when measuring by volume can differ a lot too. It's also easy to have slight differences when measuring liquids by volume, and when making bread, even a couple of tablespoons of liquid can make a difference in the outcome as well. For very small increments of weight, like the salt and yeast, I included the volume measurements because some cheaper digital scales don't always register such small amounts very well. Also note there is a difference between using coarsely or finely ground salt when measuring by volume. If you use a finely ground salt instead of the coarse kosher salt, you may need to decrease the total amount of salt to one teaspoon).",
      "The afternoon/evening before:\r\n\r\nMeasure the flour, using a digital scale, into the mixer bowl. Stir in the teaspoon of instant yeast. Measure the liquids using the digital scale and add to the flour. Mix well until the liquid is completely incorporated into the flour. Cover and set aside to autolyse for an hour.",
      "After an hour, stir or work the salt into the mixture. Using the dough hook, knead the dough on medium speed for ten minutes until you can pull a windowpane from a small piece of the dough. Remove the dough, roll into a loose ball, and place it back in the mixer bowl. Cover and let rise in a warm area until doubled in bulk, from two to four hours. After the dough has risen completely, remove the dough and shape it into a tight round by rolling it between your hands on the countertop, gathering and pinching the ends together on the bottom, and rolling again to finish. Place the dough on a large piece of parchment paper, cover the dough with plastic wrap, and place in the refrigerator overnight.",
      "The next morning:\r\n\r\nUsing the parchment paper, remove the dough from the refrigerator and place it in the cast-iron dutch oven. Using scissors, carefully trim the paper back evenly all the way around the dutch oven so the edge of the paper is below the rim of the dutch oven. Also carefully cut vertical slits into the paper surrounding the dough so that the paper lies flat against the sides of the dutch oven, letting the dough rise evenly. Cover the dutch oven with its lid, and let continue to rise in a warm area for one hour.",
      "While the bread finishes rising, preheat the oven to 450\u00b0F. At the end of one hour, remove the lid on the dutch oven. Drizzle almost a tablespoon of olive oil over the top of the dough and very gently smooth it over the surface of the dough. Sprinkle the top of the dough with a little salt. Score the top of the dough in a cross pattern, using a razor blade or serrated knife, about 1/4-inch deep. Place the lid back on the dutch oven, and place the covered dutch oven containing the dough on the middle shelf of the oven. Bake for 30 minutes, then remove the lid, lower the oven temperature to 375\u00b0F, and bake the bread an additional 10 minutes until the top is deep golden brown. The internal temperature of the bread should be at least 200\u00b0F when tested with an instant-read thermometer."

At this time, set a timer for 40 minutes, and boil until the water evaporates to the level of rice, about 10 minutes.

Mix in a bowl with olive oil to coat, add some salt and pepper and one chopped clove of garlic. Spread on a baking sheet, covered with parchment paper, and bake for 45 min, checking periodically to make sure that they don't burn. They should have a light toasted look when they're ready. Let the sweet potatos cool for about 10 minutes, then transfer to a serving bowl or platter, and drizzle with sweet chili sauce. Then scatter chopped parsley and toasted cashew nuts overtop, along with some freshly ground pepper. Bon Appetit! (Note: you can also cook the sweet potatoes by slicing them into rounds and cooking them on the barbeque for about 3-4 min per side, it's much faster, and looks very nice presented on a platter)."

Whisk cornstarch into remaining milk until smooth and thoroughly incorporated. Stir this into chocolate mixture. Cook on medium-medium high heat, whisking constantly until the pudding begins to boil and becomes noticeably thicker. Turn heat down to medium-low. Continue whisking until it's so thick that the whisk leaves trails in the pudding (about 5 minutes). Remove from heat and stir in vanilla extract and chopped chocolate, stirring until chocolate is completely melted and mixture is very smooth. Pour into a bowl and place plastic wrap or a parchment circle over the top, laying it flat against the surface of the pudding so that a skin doesn't form. Refrigerate till cold",

Increase the speed to medium high and continue to whip, stopping the machine just before the cream holds soft peaks. Remove the bowl from the electric mixer and finish whipping the cream by hand with a whisk. Fold or gently whisk in sour cream and confectioner's sugar to taste.",

Sprinkle or brush 2-4 tablespoons of liqueur, rum, bourbon or coffee onto the cake to moisten it. Spoon chocolate filling over the cake and smooth it with an offset spatula, then top with whipped cream. Smooth the top layer of whipped cream with an offset spatula. (Try to get it smoother than I did. ) Decorate the top as you prefer. (I used a fleur de lis because my parents are die-hard New Orleans Saints fans. I also sprinkled unsweetened cocoa powder over the top because, as you can see, cake decorating is not my forte. Do what you like. ) You can also make this into a layer cake with the chocolate pudding as the filling and iced with whipped cream (or vice versa), and you can decorate it with berries, nuts, grated chocolate.

      "Preheat the oven to 450 F. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper.",
      "Combine water, butter, sugar and salt in a medium saucepan and bring to a boil. Reduce to medium heat, add the flour all at once, and stir rapidly with a heatproof or wooden spoon until the dough pulls away from the sides and the bottom of the pan is clean. The dough will be glossy and smooth, but damp. Continue to cook the dough on medium heat, stirring constantly, for about five minutes. This is so enough moisture evaporates from the dough in order to absorb the eggs. A thin film will begin to appear on the sides and bottom of the pan, which indicates it is ready.",
      "Transfer the dough to a mixing bowl and stir a few more times to allow some of the heat to escape from the dough. Add the first four eggs - one at at time - incorporating well after each addition. This is the hardest part. If you have a stand mixer with a paddle attachment, use it - makes the whole thing much easier. If you're like me and have (or want) to do it by hand, be patient. When you first add an egg, it will separate your dough into several glossy pieces. They will reform with some heavy mixing! After the fourth egg, take a spatula and lift up some dough. If the dough is very dry, doesn't slip off the spatula, or falls off all in one clump, add the fifth egg.",
      "Place the dough in a pastry bag fitted with a 1/2 inch plain tip, or in a freeze bag and snip off the end. Pipe small disks, about 1 1/2 inches wide and 1/2 inch tall, leaving more than inch between them as they puff up when baked. Depending on the size, you will have 2-4 dozen puffs. One recipe of cinnamon ice cream will give you enough ice cream for 16-20 profiteroles, so you might consider freezing the extras until you need them (or making more ice cream!)",
      "Bake at 450 for 10 minutes, then rotate the baking sheet, reduce the oven to 350 F and bake for 15 minutes more. Remove from the oven and cut open a test puff - the inside should be hollow and dry. If it's still gooey, eggy or moist, return to the oven for another 5 minutes. Allow the puffs to cool completely on the baking sheet, and then store in an airtight container until ready to serve. Serve the puffs on the same day they are baked.",

      "Rewarm the cinnamon infused milk mixture. Remove the cinnamon sticks with a slotted spoon and discard them.",
      "In a separate medium bowl, whisk together the egg yolks. Slowly pour some of the warmed milk mixture into the egg yolks, whisking constantly. Pour the egg/milk mixture into the remaining milk mixture, and return to heat.",
      "Stir the mixture in a figure eight motion with a heatproof or wooden spoon over medium-low heat, scraping the bottom as your stir, until the mixture thickens and coats the spoon. Best to be patient and cook over low heat rather than risk curdling the custard. Pour the custard in a bowl, and place in an ice bath (if the custard is a bit lumpy, you can strain it). Stir until cool. Place in refrigerator until cold, preferably over night, and then freeze it in your ice cream maker according to the manufacturer's instructions.",
      "GANACHE! Finely chop 1/2 pound of good quality dark chocolate. In a saucepan bring 1/2 cup heavy cream, 1 tablespoon sugar, and 1 tablespoon light corn syrup to a boil over moderately low heat, whisking until sugar is dissolved. Remove pan from heat and add chocolate, whisking until chocolate is melted. Cut 1/4 stick unsalted butter into pieces and add to ganache, whisking until smooth. You will have a thick, glossy, intensely flavored ganache - the flavor and intensity will depend on the chocolate you use. Allow to cool, and refrigerate until using.",
      "MAKE PROFITEROLES! Heat the oven to 300 F. Place puffs in oven and heat until crispy (chances are, they got a little soft in your airtight tupperware). Warm your apple butter, warm your ganache, and take your ice cream out to soften a bit. When ready, cut the puffs in half. Put a dab of warmed apple butter on the bottom disk, add a spoonful of ice cream, and top with the top half of the puff. Drizzle warmed ganache over the puff, and serve! I usually serve two on a plate, as they're quite small and make a beautiful pair."

      "Meanwhile melt the butter in a non stick pan over medium heat and add the onions, with a dash of salt. Stir continuously for a few minutes, then turn down the heat, stirring occasionally, until the onions go soft and turn a deep colour.",
      "Boil the water in a heavy pan. Add the polenta in a steady stream, while whisking. Keep whisking for two minutes until the polenta is absorbed, then add the salt and turn down the heat to the lowest setting. Keep checking the polenta and stirring every few minutes to prevent sticking. If it gets too thick, keep adding water a few tablespoons at a time. The polenta will be cooked after 25-30 mins but is better if you can cook it longer - the flavours will develop and it will become more creamy. Taste for seasoning (be careful, it will be hot!) (I then turned off the oven and kept the squash covered with greaseproof paper until the polenta was ready to serve.)",
      "When the polenta has reached the desired consistency, add the parmesan and stir until it's all melted. Then add 2-3 tablespoons of really good olive oil.",
      "Spoon the polenta onto a warm plate or dish. Then top with the squash, shrimp and chorizo. Top with the onions, and a drizzle of olive oil. If you have chilli oil, this would be good instead of the olive oil, and/or a drizzle of balsamic vinegar."

The most difficult part will be (carefully!) cutting the pastry before adding the butter and baking. You need a sharp knife and a bit of patience.",
      "Place walnuts, almonds, pistachios, brown sugar, cinnamon, salt, and cloves in a food processor, and pulse until finely chopped (not powder).",
      "Place all of the phyllo sheets on a clean cutting board. You have to cut the sheets to fit the cake pan. Take the cake tin and place it on top of all of the sheets at the furthest corner possible. Use a sharp pairing knife to cut around the tin. Then, move the cake pan to the opposite diagonal and cut around the remaining phyllo. You should have two, even-layered circles of phyllo dough. If the phyllo dough is just a tad short, and it's not exact - don't sweat it. Use the slightly smaller layers for the bottom part and no one knows the wiser!",
      "You are going to make three layers of phyllo and two of nuts. Place one of the layered circles into the greased cake pan to form the bottom. Cover with half of the nut mixture and drizzle a little honey in very thin streams across all of the nuts. Divide the other layered circle into two equal halves of layers. Place one of them over the nuts, and then again cover with the remaining half of the nut mixture and a little honey. Place the final layers of phyllo on top.",

Lower immediately to a simmer, simmer for 5 to 7 minutes, stirring often until slightly thickened, and remove from the heat discarding the vanilla bean and rind. Be careful - it can foam up, so stirring will help prevent it from overflowing. Also, sugar is extremely hot when heated like this so avoid the temptation to dip your finger and taste...",

      "Baklava can be stored at room temperature for about 5 days. Make sure it has completely cooled before covering to keep a good texture.",
      "*Because of the quick method we're using, you don't want the milk solids from the butter to burn on the top of the baklava, so it only takes a few minutes to clarify the butter. You basically want to melt the butter on low and simmer for a few minutes. The water will evaporate, and the milk solids will settle to the bottom. Skim the foam off the top, and the butter should be relatively clear. When you use the butter, decant it - that is, pour it without letting any of the milk solids that are settled at the bottom pour into your container."

Use mesquite chips for their great flavor. (**Skip down to step 4 and make the rajas. Keep them warm while you grill the steak.) When the coals are coated with grey ash and you cannot keep your hand above the grate for more than a minute, you have a hot fire that is ready for the steak. Place the steak directly over the hot coals. Grill each side until it is charred but the center is rare to barely medium rare. Start with 1 to 3 minutes per side.

Don't overcook and remember that the meat will continue to cook while it rests.",

    "title": "jackfruit \"carnitas\" tamales from chef aar\u00f3n s\u00e1nchez",
    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "Drain and thoroughly rinse the jackfruit.",
      "In a large mixing bowl, combine the sugar, salt, dried oregano, spices, and orange zest. Add the jackfruit and toss well to thoroughly coat. Cover and allow to marinate at room temperature for 30 minutes.",
      "In a heavy-bottomed saucepan or small pot, heat the oil over medium heat. Cook the onion until it's just beginning to brown around the edges, 5 to 8 minutes, then add the garlic and cook a minute more.",
      "Fold in the chipotle and jackfruit and let cook, undisturbed, until fragrant. Give it a stir; it should be starting to brown and slightly stick to the bottom of the pan. When it does, pour in the broth and add the bay leaf. Increase the heat to medium-high just until it comes to a simmer, then cover with the lid so there's a slight gap for steam to escape. Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook, stirring occasionally, until the broth has thickened and the jackfruit is easily to shred with a fork, 30 minutes or so. Discard the bay leaf.",
      "Allow the jackfruit to cool completely before filling the tamales; it's best if you can refrigerate it overnight. Feel free to coarsely chop it to make it finer.",
      "To make the tamales: Rinse the cornhusks thoroughly and place them all in a large bowl. Cover with plenty of hot water and add a weight, such as a heavy dish, to keep them submerged. Set aside for at least 20 minutes.",
      "In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the masa, salt, baking powder, and chili powder. Using a fork, stir in the broth until you have a crumbly dough, then add the oil and melted butter. Stir or knead by hand until the mix feels like cookie dough; it will be oily to the touch but should not look shiny or greasy. Divide it into 12 evenly sized mounds, approximately 2 ounces each.",
      "Thoroughly dry one corn husk and lay it on a work surface with the tapered end pointing away from you. Grab a mound of masa and use your fingertips to spread it in a 4- to 5-inch square in the lower left corner of the husk; you want a pretty thin layer of even thickness.",
      "Repeat with 11 of the remaining husks (there are a few extra in case any are badly torn).",
      "Spoon approximately 2 tablespoons of jackfruit \"carnitas\" in the center of the masa so it forms a little line parallel with the husk. Scatter 1 to 2 teaspoons Cacique(R) Queso Fresco over it.",
      "To fold the tamale, start with the corner that has masa. Fold the long side of the husk snugly to enclose the filling, then continue rolling until there's no excess husk. The narrow, un-filled end will form a long, tapered \"tail\"; fold it down toward the seam. Tear some of the extra husks into long, thin ribbons and use these to tie the tamales.",
      "Set up a steamer basket or bamboo steamer above a large pot that has a lid. Fill the pot with water until it's about an inch below the steamer, then bring to medium-high heat. When it's actively simmering, decrease the heat to medium-low for a gentle simmer.",
      "Position the tamales inside the steamer, filling side up. You can lean the tamales against each other to prop them upright. Cover the pot with a lid and steam the tamales, undisturbed, for 35 to 45 minutes. (Check about halfway through to ensure there's enough liquid in the pot; if necessary, carefully pour in more water, making sure it doesn't splash inside the tamales themselves.)",
      "To check for doneness, allow one to cool for 2 to 3 minutes while the rest keep cooking in the lidded pot; the husk should peel away easily. If the masa still sticks to it, continue to steam the tamales in 5-minute increments.",
      "To make the creamy salsa verde de chapulines: Heat a large cast iron skillet over medium heat. Add the pumpkin seeds and toast, stirring occasionally, until golden and nutty, 5 to 6 minutes. Transfer the pumpkin seeds to a bowl to cool, then coarsely chop.",
      "Increase the heat to high. Cut the onion into 4 wedges, leaving the root end intact, and when the skillet is very hot, add the wedges flat side down. Leave undisturbed to char for 3 to 5 minutes, until deeply browned. Flip and repeat on the other flat side, then transfer to a cutting board. Char the tomatillos for about 3 to 4 minutes per side, until evenly blistered and blackened in places. Finally, char the garlic cloves, about 1 minute per side, until deeply browned. When all the vegetables are cool enough to handle, trim the root end from the onions and core the tomatoes.",
      "Let the pan cool slightly off the heat, then add the oil and set the pan over medium-high heat. When the oil is shimmering and nearly smoking, carefully add the crickets and spices. Allow to fry for about 1 minute, then remove from heat. Cool slightly.",
      "Transfer the contents of the skillet to a food processor or mortar and pestle. Add the pumpkin seeds and salt and blend until nearly smooth. Add the onions, tomatillos, garlic, and cilantro (finely chop everything first if using a mortar and pestle) and mix into a thick sauce. Stir in the Cacique(R) Crema Mexicana and vegetable broth, then season with lime zest and juice.",
      "Serve the salsa over the warm tamales."

Instead of drying them on a paper towel, use a cooling rack placed over a cookie sheet to catch the oil. This will prevent the dough from softening immediately."

Place the pancake in the oven to stay warm, and repeat with the remaining batter. Serve hot, with butter and maple syrup, and enjoy!",
      "notes:\r\n- There is an easy test to see if your skillet is hot enough. Get your fingers wet with water, and flick some droplets onto the surface of the skillet. If the drops just sit there, it is not hot enough. If they immediately disappear, the skillet is too hot. If they sizzle and dance, you are ready to cook!\r\n- You will likely need to adjust the stove as you cook the pancakes. If they are browning too quickly, turn the stove down. If they are too pale and taking too long, turn the stove up.\r\n- You don't need much, if any, oil to cook pancakes. We pour about 1/2 teaspoon of vegetable oil in a cast iron pan, then use a paper towel to wipe it over the surface of the pan, creating a very thin coating. For a crisper exterior, feel free to use more oil, or try butter for extra richness."

Place the cup of sugar and grated orange zest in a large bowl and rub the zest into the sugar with your fingers until well-combined (you can also pulse them together in a food processor, but I like to use my hands!).

      "Remove the cake from the oven and, without moving the baking paper, poke many holes all over the entire top of the cake with a toothpick or a skewer. While the cake is still hot, pour over the sweetened orange juice. Let sit until cooled so that the cake can absorb the liquid fully (you can also do this the night before to serve the next day). Serve in thick slices, perhaps with some confectioners' sugar over the top or some poached slices of citrus fruit to decorate (see headnote). The cake keeps well in the fridge, covered (for a up to a week supposedly, according to Marcella's recipe) but it is undoubtedly at its best on the second day when it has soaked the juice perfectly and evenly but has not yet become soggy, as it can tend to do after a few days."

Once all of the water is integrated, use the back of a wooden spoon or spatula to submerge the grounds. Cover the container loosely with a towel and let sit undisturbed for 12 hours. Remove the towel and filter out the grounds using a paper coffee filter or large sieve lined with a cheesecloth. Refrigerate and enjoy within one week.",

Meanwhile whisk the sugar and pectin together - this will keep the pectin from lumping up. When the berries are boiling, stir in the sugar, pectin and butter. The butter will keep the mixture from foaming up too much and butter makes things better in general. Once the jam has reached a rolling boil again you can turn down the heat and keep it at a low boil for about 5 minutes, stirring often. Now look at a spoonful - do you want all whole berries or some mashed? I like some mashed so I run through the jam (gently) with a potato masher. Do the jam test - pour a little down the back of a frozen spoon. Run your finger through it. It should make a path that stays open. If not, boil a few more minutes and test again. Your jam is done!",

Boil in the jam pot for 10 minutes then remove and leave them alone until they have cooled completely and the seals have set. Please research before canning - safety first!!!"

Make a well in the center and pour liquid ingredients and 5 of the eggs (reserving the 6th egg for glazing) into the well. Mix on low speed (or with a wooden spoon) until all dry ingredients are moistened. Let sit, uncovered, for 5 minutes.",
      "If kneading by machine, knead on medium speed for 6 to 8 minutes until the dough is smooth and elastic. If kneading by hand, turn out onto a lightly floured work surface and knead for 12 to 15 minutes, adding wisps of flour if the dough sticks. For both methods, it is ok if the dough is a little sticky, but you do not want a wet dough.",
      "Shape the dough into a tight ball and place in a large, oiled glass or plastic container large enough to hold the dough at twice to three times its volume. Cover with a lid or plastic wrap and set to rise in a warm place until doubled in volume -- at least 2 hours and more, if necessary. (I often put the dough in an oiled jumbo zip-top bag and take it to work with me for the morning. It is very forgiving. I just punch it down if it rises all the way.)",
      "Line two baking sheets with parchment paper or grease lightly. When you are ready to shape the challah, turn the dough out gently onto a lightly floured surface and gently press the air out of the dough. With a bench knife or chef's knife, divide the dough into two equal pieces. Working with one half of the dough at a time, divide into three equal pieces and roll each piece into a strand about 16 inches long. Pinch the three strands tightly together at one end and then braid tightly. When you come to the end, pinch the strands tightly together and transfer the loaf to a prepared pan, tucking the pinched ends under a bit. Repeat with the other piece of dough. Cover the loaves with cotton or linen towels which have been soaked in room temperature water and wrung out and allow to rise until almost doubled in bulk, about 30 to 45 minutes Immediately preheat the oven to 350 degrees.",
      "When the loaves are risen sufficiently, beat the 6th egg with a pich of salt and a teaspoon cold water with a fork until smooth. Using a pastry brush, gently coat the surface of the loaves with the egg glaze, then sprinkle generously (yes, I do mean generously) with the coarse salt and pepper. Pop into the preheated oven and bake for 40 to 50 minutes, rotating front to hack after 20 minutes, until the loaves are a rich brown and the bottom sounds a bit hollow when thumped. Do NOT over bake or the loaves will be dry and mean things.",
      "When done, remove from the oven and allow to cool on the baking sheet for 10 minutes. Then transfer the loaves carefully to a wire rack and allow to cool completely. (I know this is hard, but cutting into the loaf before the proteins have had a chance to stabilize will give you a gummy loaf that is nasty on the tongue.)"

Tightly wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes to an hour.",

      "Place the bowl over a saucepan of simmering water. Add the butter chunks and cook, whisking constantly, until the butter is melted. Continue to cook over moderate heat until the mixture thickens to a loose pudding-like consistency (like a creme anglaise). You don't want it to be entirely firm because you're going to cook it more in the oven, but you do want it to be cooked enough that it thickly coats the back of the stirring spoon.",
      "Remove the curd from the heat. Press it through a fine mesh strainer into another bowl, cover, and place in the refrigerator to set.",
      "Continue with making the dough. Take your dough out of the refrigerator and roll it out into a rectangle about 3/4-inch thick. Fold the right third into the center, then the left third over this, just as you did before, but now roll the dough out to 3/4-inch thick again using a rolling pin.

Nothing inside, place 3or4 of them side by side on the other half of lettuce. Take a handfull of shredded chicken and cover the tortillas. Use a soup ladle and pour the green chili over chicken, tortillas, and even the fresh side. Crumble or shred Queso Fresco over the dish."

      "For this recipe, you will need to use mini-muffin tins. The wells should be about 1 1/2 inches in diameter (measuring across the top).",
      "First, make the tartlet shells. Preheat the oven to 400F degrees. Roll out the dough so it is quite thin (less than 1/4-inch thickness). Using a biscuit cutter or the rim of a glass, cut out circles of the pie dough that are slightly larger than the diameter of the wells of the muffin tin. Carefully press each circle of dough into the sides and bottoms of each well to form a little cup of dough. The dough will shrink as it bakes, so err on the side of extra dough popping up over the sides. Bake for 8-10 minutes or until the dough is set and begins to brown slightly. Remove the tartlet shells from the oven and allow them to cool. Leave the oven on for the tomatoes.",
      "On a small, rimmed baking sheet, combine the tomatoes, thyme,olive oil, and a sprinkle of salt (about 1/2 teaspoon). Roast the tomatoes, occasionally stirring and turning the pan, until they are wrinkled and collapsed and the juices have begun to thicken, about 30-40 minutes. Remove from the oven and allow to cool. Discard the thyme stems.",
      "While the tomatoes are roasting, make the bacon relish. Mince the bacon into pieces not larger than 1/4-inch square. In a saucepan, cook the bacon over medium-high heat, stirring often. When the bacon begins to give off a good amount of liquid, reduce the heat to medium and continue to cook and stir. The bacon will start foaming as it browns; keep a close eye on it so it doesn't burn. When the bacon darkens in color and is just shy of crispy, about 7 to 10- minutes, remove the pan from the heat.",
      "Carefully remove the bacon with a slotted spoon into a small dish. Pour off all but 2 teaspoons of bacon fat (and the tiny bacon bits at the bottom of the pan) and return the pan to the heat.",
      "Add in the onion and saute until the onion is soft and begins to caramelize. Add the bacon back in along with the vinegar and 3 teaspoons of the chicken stock and several generous grinds of black pepper. Cook until the bacon relish begins to simmer. Lower the heat and let it cook for another 5-10 minutes to allow the bacon to soften slightly. You might need to add in more chicken stock, which should be done a tablespoon at a time. The relish should appear moist but not soupy, the onions and bacon appearing to be somewhat melded together. Taste and adjust seasoning. Allow the relish to cool.",
      "To assemble the tartlets, take a pastry shell and line it with a leaf of arugula, which will drape over the sides. Place a small dollop of aioli or mayonnaise in the shell, then a tomato on one side of the shell and a small mound of bacon relish on the other. I have found narrow-tipped chopsticks to be the most helpful for this task.",
      "The individual components can be made a day in advance (keep the tomatoes and relish in the refrigerator and the tart shells in an air-tight container at room temperature) but the tartlets should be assembled as close to go-time as possible."

      "Heat oven to 400 degrees F.",
      "To prepare cauliflower, cut the head of cauliflower in half. Cut the first half into small florets. Place in a large bowl and toss with 1 tablespoon of olive oil (this will promote deeper, more even roasting), Aleppo, fennel seed, and kosher salt, to taste. Thinly slice or shave the other half (the slicing blade of a food processor makes quick work of this task). You're aiming for a combination of thin slices and the little bits of florets that fall off while slicing. Break apart any large pieces so they're easier to eat. Set aside (this is the half that's eaten raw).",
      "In a large, ovenproof skillet over medium heat, heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil for 1 minute. Add the pancetta and cook, stirring occasionally, until crisp, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and transfer the pancetta to a paper towel-lined plate to drain, leaving the rendered fat in the skillet. You should have enough fat to cover the bottom of your skillet; supplement with olive oil if needed.",
      "Return the skillet to the burner at medium-high heat. When the fat begins to shimmer, add the cauliflower florets (the first half that you tossed with spices, salt, and olive oil) in a single, even layer, taking care to avoid overcrowding which will cause the cauliflower to steam. (Cook the cauliflower florets in batches, if needed.) Saute for several minutes without disturbing - you want the cauliflower to caramelize, then flip the florets and brown on the other side, another minute or two. At this point, the cauliflower should be nicely browned but not cooked through. Transfer the skillet to the oven and roast until tender, about 7 to 10 minutes. Check often to avoid mushy cauliflower. Remove skillet from oven.",
      "Immediately toss the thinly sliced, raw cauliflower with the pan-roasted cauliflower in the skillet (or a large bowl); the residual heat will relax the crunch of the raw cauliflower. Let cool for about 10 minutes, then add the pancetta, apple, celery, celery leaves, and dill. Add lemon juice (starting with about 2 tablespoons and adding more, to taste) and 1 tablespoon of extra-virgin olive oil; toss to combine. Adjust salt to taste, and drizzle a little more extra-virgin olive oil over the salad, if desired. Serve while still warm or at room temperature. Leftovers can be gently reheated in a skillet or microwave until the cauliflower is just warm."

      "In a stand mixer, fitted with a paddle attachment, cream sugar, butter and olive oil until well mixed, about 2-3 minutes. Mixture will look a little crumbly. Add vanilla and eggs one at a time, blending on medium-low speed until incorporated. Add salt, baking powder, and one cup of flour at a time, blending on low speed, until flour is dispersed into the sugar, butter and egg mixture. Add milk, then blend until dough starts to form a ball.",
      "Take paddle attachment off mixer and replace with dough hook. Knead dough for 1-2 minutes, until it has formed a smooth ball. (You can quickly knead the dough by hand instead, if you prefer.) Remove dough from bowl -- it will feel a little sticky -- and cut dough in half. Wrap one piece of the dough in plastic wrap and sprinkle the other piece of dough with flour.",
      "When dough is rolled out, cut dough into 8 inch strips, about 3/4 inch wide, with a sharp knife or ravioli cutter (my favorite tool because it gives a pretty scalloped edge). See if you can lift each strip up. If any of the strips are sticking to the wax paper, a little bit of flour and a metal spatula should loosen it.",
      "Now you are ready to form the cookies. The directions may seem involved, but there really is not a right or wrong way to do this. No matter what you do, the cookies will be beautiful! Working with one strip at any time, gently twist it as though you are twisting crepe paper for a child's party. Then bring both ends together. Cross the ends of the dough so that they form an X. (There should be about 1 1/2 inches from where the X forms to the end of each piece of dough.) Wrap one end of the X over and under the other end of the dough, as if you were starting to tie a shoe. Press your thumb gently, where the dough is now joined together. Place cookie on a baking sheet sprinkled with flour. Continue forming cookies until you have used up all of the strips. Remove the plastic wrap from the remaining piece of dough, and roll it out, following above directions. Cut into strips and form strips into cookies. Place all cookies on the cookie sheet.",
      "Now you are ready to fry! In a large skillet, heat vegetable oil until a candy thermometer registers 300 degrees. Working in batches, carefully drop each cookie into the hot oil. Oil will sizzle and bubble. If it is splattering furiously, turn heat down. If bubbling is not really detectable, turn heat up. Fry cookies for about two minutes on the first side. When they have turned a golden, caramel color, turn cookies over with a slotted spoon or spider. Fry cookies on the second side for about 1 minute or until second side is a lovely golden brown. Keep a careful eye on the cookies. They can burn in an instant. When cookies have finished frying, remove to a wire rack fitted over a baking sheet. Let cool.",
      "Last step -- adding the honey glaze: In a small saucepan, heat honey and 1 tablespoon water over low heat just until honey warms. If consistency, looks too thick, add a little more water, a teaspoonful at a time. When honey is warmed (but not hot!), take a silicone or pastry brush, and gently brush warmed honey over all surfaces of the cookies, until they are coated with honey and look beautiful and shiny. Just before serving, sprinkle cookies with confectioners' sugar, if desired.",
      "Enjoy with a hot cup of Earl Grey tea or a mug of strong black coffee. I strongly recommend dipping them! Note: Cookies can be made in advance and frozen for a couple of months or kept at room temperature for a week. It is best to add the honey glaze just before serving because the honey will soften the cookies a bit."

Heat, stirring occasionally, until the chocolate is melted and the mixture is smooth. Transfer to a vessel with a pour spout (like a large liquid measuring cup) and let cool while you make the frosting.",

Scatter the crushed candy around the base of the cake, if desired.",
      "The glaze should firm up within 5 minutes. If it doesn't, pop the cake in the refrigerator for a few minutes. The cake is now ready to be sliced and served-it will hold at room temperature once the glaze is set, but you can hold it in the fridge for up to 4 hours before serving as well."

    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "Heat oven to 400 F. Grind 1/2 oz dried mushrooms to a fine powder in a spice grinder or food processor. Measure out and set aside 1 tbsp and store the rest for another use. Set the remaining ounce of dried mushrooms in a saucepan or a bowl. In another saucepan, bring chicken broth just to a boil, then remove from heat. Pour over the mushrooms, cover, and let steep while you attend to the veggies.",
      "Remove and reserve mushroom stems. If your celery stalks have leaves and your carrots have tops, separate and reserve about a 1/4 cup's worth of each, finely chopped. Also reserve your vegetable detritus--peelings, root ends, etc. Chop up all your mushrooms and veggies--except the garlic--so that they are roughly the same size as the whole cloves. (How many celery stalks and carrots you'll need depends on the size of your onion--use as many as required to obtain a roughly 2:1:1 onion:celery:carrot ratio.) Put everything in a large bowl and toss with the herbs, spices, salt, pepper, and about a 1/4 cup of olive oil. Spread in a large (at least 9 x 13) dish, and roast 45-60 minutes, stirring occasionally to redistribute.",
      "Meanwhile, check on those dried mushrooms you've been steeping while prepping your veggies. When they are sufficiently rehydrated, remove them from the broth with a slotted spoon. Rinse, then squeeze out excess moisture. Set aside to dry. Now take your reserved mushroom stems and other vegetable trimmings and chuck them in your now-mushroomy chicken broth, along with the parmigiano heel. Bring to the barest simmer, cover, and let it slow-jam on the back burner for the time being. (Strain before using, and hold on to the parmigiano heel, too. You'll use it again in a bit.)",
      "When the mushrooms and vegetables are done roasting, remove from the oven and let cool. Drop the oven temperature down to 350 F. Put your rehydrated porcini in a small baking dish or ramekin and pour the 1 1/2 cups olive oil over. Roast in the oven 20-30 minutes, or until it smells like awesome. Have a clean, dry container at the ready--like an empty bottle with a stopper, say--and fill it with your now-mushroom-infused oil. Roughly chop the roasted porcini and set aside.",
      "Pulse your now-cooled roasted mushrooms and vegetables in batches in a food processor until very finely chopped. (If the consistency gets a little pasty in the process, that's ok--it'll help give body to the ragu, like pureeing half the lentils in a lentil soup.) Set the mixture aside until ready to use.",
      "Place the pancetta in a large skillet or saute pan with 1/4 cup of your mushroom-infused olive oil. (Or regular olive oil, if you're skipping the infusing step.) Turn the heat to medium-low and let the pancetta start to render. Once it gets golden, raise the heat, add the bison, and brown, using a heavy wooden spoon to break up any large chunks.",
      "Lower the heat to medium, clear a spot in the center of the pan, add the tomato paste, and let it take on some color as well, stirring to prevent scorching. Add the reserved porcini, the porcini powder, the roasted mushroom-vegetable mixture, the parsley, and the celery leaves and carrot tops, if using. Let that cook together for a few minutes, then raise the heat to high and add the wine, stirring to scrape up all the browned bits on the bottom of the pan. When the wine has almost all evaporated, stir in the tomatoes and 2 cups of the reserved mushroom-chicken broth, along with the parmigiano heel, then bring to boil, reduce heat, and simmer, partially covered, for several hours, stirring occasionally and adding more broth if the ragu starts looking thirsty. Keep simmering and adding broth and letting the ragu drink it up until it arrives at a consistency that is best described as \"sticky\"--not too saucy, not too viscous, but somewhere in between. LIke porn, you'll know it when you see it. Season to taste with salt and pepper and serve with something ridged and tubular, like rigatoni, or long and ribbony, like pappardelle. Garnish with tarragon, parmigiano, and a drizzle of mushroom oil."

You want 2-3 good discs from the sponge. One disc will be the base (later, it will become the top) of the cake. With another, cut strips then trapezoids the same way you did with the pistachio marzipan. With the final disc, set aside for the top (later to become the bottom) of the cake. Some also use simply the sponge leftovers for this part, breaking them into crumbs to sprinkle over the cake in a layer. If your sponge is not the same diameter as the pie tin, you can also slice the sponge into fingers and arrange them (much like you would tiramisu) in a layer across the bottom.",

If your ricotta is quite soft, spoon it into a colander lined with a damp tea towel or a few layers of muslin or cheesecloth set over a bowl. Leave it overnight for the excess liquid to drip out. Combine firm ricotta and caster sugar together until smooth and creamy. Add the dark chocolate, roughly chopped into fine pieces. Set aside.",
      "To assemble the cassata, use a pie dish that measures about 10 inches (25cm diameter) along the bottom. Place a disc of sponge cake on the bottom. Assemble the marzipan and sponge trapezoids along the sides of the tin, alternating to achieve a striped look. Don't worry too much about any little gaps.",

Place a sponge disc (or a sponge crumb layer) on the top and cover with plastic cling wrap. Place a small flat plate that fits just inside the width of the pie tin on top and weigh the cassata down with a couple of jars of jam in order to keep the cassata pressed. Let rest in the fridge for at least 2 to 3 hours, or even better, overnight.",
      "Remove the plastic wrap and place a flat serving plate over the top of the cassata, then carefully upturn the plate and remove the pie tin (it will come out very easily). Prepare a sugar glaze by combining the powdered sugar and water in a small saucepan and heating to a simmer. It should be thick but still runny -- add water as needed, a tablespoon at a time, until you get the right consistency.",
      "It helps to have 4 hands for this next part. Tip the hot sugar glaze out onto the cassata and very quickly smooth over to cover the entire cassata, top and sides (it cools quickly and as it cools it hardens so it is easier to do this bit by bit).",

Simmer for a few minutes or until reduced slightly then take off the heat, add the parsley and set aside.",

Cook the mussels again for about 15 minutes.",

Basically all it is is a can of rinsed refried black beans, 2 bags of pre cut and chopped butter nut squash (trader joe's) 1 shallot, olive oil, cinnamon, salt + pepper + fresh cilantro. Now, you can add some type of crema which will make them even tastier. I kept them non-spicy cause I had some guests who didn't care for the heat. Jalapeno pepper greek yogart would make a nice addition for some more sweet heat. Or be creative and try whatever you want but definitely add some spice to balance the sweet of the squash. Serve them on some corn tortillas and call it a damn day! Play with it until you've mastered an amazing recipe then show them off to your friends."

Sprinkle it with flour and roll it into an 11-inch circle 1/8-inch thick, sprinkling dough and rolling pin as necessary to prevent sticking. As you work, slide the dough around and/or slip a metal spatula under it frequently, and sprinkle with more flour, as necessary to avoid sticking. Don't bother to trim the circle; uneven edges are part of the charm here. You don't have to patch the edges if they tear a little, but do patch any breaks or tears in the center of the dough, using bits from the edge, to prevent juices from leaking.",
      "Roll the pastry up around the rolling pin and unroll it on a sheet of parchment-or slip a flexible cutting mat or baking sheet under it to transfer. Brush off excess flour if necessary- and set aside.",

      "Distribute half of the berries over the center of each circle, leaving a 3-inch border. There will space between berries. Sprinkle the berries on each pastry with 1 tablespoon of the sugar. If you like, break the optional goat cheese into small pieces and divide and distribute them over and between the berries on each galette. Cut the butter into slivers and distribute them over the berries. Trying not to tear or break the pastry (or juices will leak out), fold the edges up and over some of the berries, letting the pastry pleat it as you go.",

Juices will be bubbling and may seem thin; they will thicken as the galettes cool. Set the pan on a rack to cool. Serve once cooled."

Each ball of filling should be about 2 tablespoons to 2 1/2 tablespoons -- roughly the size of a golf ball. If you have a kitchen scale, each ball should weigh about 33 to 34 grams.",

      "For this next step, you may want to flour your hands lightly, though I didn't and it was generally fine. Place a ball of filling in the center and fold up the dough around the ball. It likely will not cover the whole ball at once, nor should it. Gently push, press, and squeeze the dough, holding the ball securely in your palm, until the dough gradually covers the filling ball. The firmer your filling, the easier this will be. If it really won't squeeze over the filling, don't worry -- just pinch off another small piece of dough, roll it out, and use it to patch the ball. I did this a few times and the results were just as good. (To make things even easier, you can even just roll out two small balls of dough -- about a teaspoon each -- and fold one around each end of the filling so that you cover all of the lotus paste without needing to stretch or squeeze.)",

Lift the mooncake mold off the table and use the plunger to push the mooncake out. Place on a Silpat- or parchment-lined baking sheet while you make the rest of the cakes. If it's a hot day, you may want to place these in the fridge to keep their form while you finish folding.",

When the egg whites have just become opaque, start testing by dipping your whisk into the egg white and turning it upside down.

Salt the shoulder generously (approximately 2 tablespoons of fine sea salt), rub it in olive oil, and massage in the ras al hanout. Distribute the vegetables and aromatics-carrots, onion, fennel, garlic, preserved lemon-below and around the meat. Add a pat of butter on top. Cover and refrigerate overnight.",

Roast the shoulder in this high heat for 20 minutes. Lower the oven temperature to 275\u00b0 F. Add 2 cups of water to the pan and cover completely with a lid or double layer of aluminum foil. Cook the shoulder for 12 to 16 hours. You can baste the meat a few times, or you can leave it alone completely. Braises are wonderful in this way; they don't ask for much.",
      "During the last hour of cooking, uncover the pan; this allows some remaining moisture to evaporate, producing a desirable crust on the surface of the meat. All meat should rest before serving, and in the case of a 4-pound joint, give it a good 30 minutes.",

      "Set your pot of water on low heat. Add in 1 tbsp of oil, chopped onion, bay leaf and juniper berries. Peel the beets and cut them into halves if they're small enough or into thirds or quarters if they're very large. You want them to be of relatively equal size. Drop them gently into the water as you continue working on the rest of the vegetables.",
      "Peel and cut the carrots into rounds, and for the potatoes, cut them into 1/2? size cubes or small chunks. (I prefer my vegetables small as I find they distribute a lot better into individual bowls.) Add them to the pot as they're ready. Then add the chopped celery and the juice of 1/2 of a fresh lemon. Bring your heat up and cook the soup until a fork easily pierces through one of the larger beet pieces; this should take about 15 minutes on medium low heat.",
      "While the beets are getting tender, you should skim the soup from some of the foam that will form. By doing this, you will inevitably be taking out some of the oil along with it. Once you've skimmed it, put in an additional 1/2 tablespoon of oil.",
      "Once your beets are done, scoop them out of the soup (bringing back into the pot any vegetables that might have clung to the beet) and let the beets cool for 2 minutes so you can handle them more easily. At this point, you can turn the pot to low heat. I'd advise wearing gloves for the next part so you don't have to take beet stains off your hands. Using the large holes on your grater, shred your beets. Once you've grated all the chunks, carefully put all the shredded beets back into the soup pot and let this cook for an additional 10 minutes.",
      "The soup should have a sweet tart taste. After the 10 minutes, add in the dill and taste the soup to adjust flavors accordingly. Add salt, a tad of pepper, and if the soup is still too sweet for you, another tablespoon or 2 of fresh lemon juice. Remember that if your soup is very hot, you will not taste the actual level of salt, so err on the side of less, as each time you reheat the soup, it will get slightly saltier. This soup is the perfect example of melded flavors getting better in the following days.",
      "Notes: Serve hot or cold, with sour cream or not, but eat this with black bread. If you want to make the soup a bit spicier, add thin slices of garlic to the soup before serving. If you want just a hint of garlic, then rub a cut clove over the crust of your bread. In the Winter, if you want to experience an even more authentic Russian meal, serve this soup with a side of mashed potatoes topped with sardines. Let the juices of the sardines drip into the butter- or milk-mashed potatoes. If you cook this in the Summertime, omit cooking with juniper berries and use a topping of cubed persian cucumbers or a hard boiled egg split in half."

      "Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Toss artichoke hearts with one tablespoon olive oil, and salt & pepper to taste. Bake in a shallow baking dish until crispy, 25 minutes or so. Set aside.",
      "Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a heavy wide saute pan over medium heat. Add four cloves thinly sliced garlic, saute until fragrant and lightly browned. Add 2 pounds whole cherry tomatoes and toss to coat with oil. Cover and cook over medium-low heat until tomatoes break down, 20-30 minutes or so, stirring occasionally. When most of the tomatoes have split open, add 1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes, and mash with the tomatoes into the olive oil using a wooden spoon until you have a chunky sauce.",
      "While barley, artichokes, and tomatoes are cooking, heat enough olive oil to cover the bottom of a large dutch oven over medium. When oil is hot add 3-4 cloves diced garlic, saute until fragrant, about one minute. Add mushrooms and cook until softened, 5-8 minutes. Season lightly with salt and pepper. Remove from heat and set aside (you will add the other ingredients to the dutch oven before serving).",
      "Process arugula and basil with the garlic, the juice of 2 lemons, and salt and pepper to taste. Add olive oil while motor is running until you have a chunky pesto - you want a higher ratio or greens to olive oil here than with a typical pesto. It may taste more bitter than you're used to but it will work once it is added to the other ingredients.",
      "Cut burrata into bite sized pieces. Roughly chop the entire bunch of parsley. Just before serving, reheat mushroom mixture in dutch oven and add 3/4 of the cooked barley. Add pesto mixture and artichokes, and stir until reheated. Taste for seasoning and add more olive oil, salt, or pepper as needed. Remove from heat and add burrata and 3/4 of the parsley.",
      "Reheat cherry tomato sauce if needed. The barley risotto can be served on a large platter with the cherry tomato sauce on top, or you can serve individual portions with a good dollop of the sauce on each portion. Drizzle with olive oil and pass around freshly shaved parmigiano-reggiano, the remaining parsley, and crushed red pepper. Yum!"
