Coat a 9 x 13 pan with nonstick cooking spray and line the bottom of the pan with 5 tortillas, slightly overlapping them. (You will need to cut one of the tortillas in half.) Spread half of the meat mixture over the tortillas, dot with half of the Ricotta mixture and top with half of the cheese. Repeat the layers using the remaining ingredients.
