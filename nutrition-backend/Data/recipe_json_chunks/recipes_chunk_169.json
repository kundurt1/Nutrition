When polenta is done, spoon will stand up in the middle and mass will cling together and pull away from the sides. Remove from heat and turn onto countertop, baking sheet or cutting board that has been wet down with cold water to prevent sticking. Smooth out polenta with spatula. Let cool 30 minutes. Brush the bottom and sides of baking dish with some of the melted butter. Brush the rest of the butter on top of the polenta. Cut the polenta into small rounds. Take all of the little 4-sided pieces of the polenta from between the rounds and place them in a baking dish. On top of these, make an overlapping row of rounds leaning up against the sides of the dish (like tile roof tops). Crumble Gorgonzola over the top and bake in a 450\u00b0 oven for 20 minutes.
