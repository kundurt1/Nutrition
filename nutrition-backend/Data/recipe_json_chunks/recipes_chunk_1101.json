Even if the pans are nonstick, it's a good idea to butter and flour them. Place the pans on an insulated baking sheet or on two regular sheets stacked one on top of the other.",

      "Put the sugar and the lemon zest in a large bowl, working with your fingers, rub them together until the sugar is moist and thoroughly imbued with the fragrance of lemon. Add the vanilla bean seeds and work them into the sugar. If you are using vanilla extract, add it later, after you have added the eggs.",
      "Add the eggs and whisk them into the sugar, beating until they are thoroughly incorporated. Whisk in the extract (if using), then whisk in the cream. Continuing with the whisk, or switching to a large rubber spatula, gently stir in the dry ingredients in 3 or 4 additions; the batter will be smooth and thick. Finish by folding in the melted butter in 2 or 3 additions. Pour the batter into the pans, smoothing with a rubber spatula.",
      "Bake for 55 to 60 minutes, or until a knife inserted into the center of the cakes comes out clean. As soon as the cake goes into the oven, make the syrup. After about 30 minutes in the oven, check the cakes for color- if they are browning too quickly, cover them lightly with foil tents.",
      "Making the syrup: Stir the water and sugar together in a medium saucepan over medium heat until the sugar melts, then bring to a boil Remove the pan from heat and stir in the lemon juice. Pour the syrup into a heatproof bowl and let cool.",
      "When the cakes test done, transfer them to a wire rack to cool for 5 minutes before unmolding them and turning them right side up on the rack. Place the rack over a baking sheet lined with wax paper and, using a thin skewer, cake tester or thin-bladed sharp knife, poke holes all over the cakes. Brush the cakes all over with the syrup, working slowly so that the cakes sop it up. Leave the cakes on the rack to cool to room temperature."

      "Rinse the sushi rice in the rice cooker bowl three or four times until the water is nearly clear. Fill the rice with water until there is a layer of water that rests a fourth of an inch above the rice.",
      "You can either sprinkle the top of the rice with salt and then add the vinegar or mix the two together in a small bowl before pouring it on top of the rice. Some people add a touch of sugar or mirin. Be sure to experiment to suit your tastes.",
      "While the rice is cooking, make sure to cook the shrimp and eel. I buy eel at the local Japanese store. You can sometimes find eel in Chinatown. If you don't have a store that sells eel in the area, there are places that will ship frozen eel to your home. Bake and broil the eel at 350 degrees until it is warm. Make sure to coat the baking tray or pan with spray so that it is easy to remove once you're ready to roll.",
      "In regards to cooking the shrimp, I always use a pan. If you prefer to not add tempura bits or cannot find any in stores, you can also prepare shrimp tempura separately. This is sometimes what I do when I am in the mood. Here is a link for the shrimp tempura recipe: http://www.food.com/recipe/shrimp-tempura-169444.",
      "When the rice is finished cooking, fan the rice, and allow it to cool for five minutes. Unravel your rice mat until it is flat, and set one nori sheet on the mat. Use a wooden spoon to spread three fourths of the sheet thinly with rice. You do not want to spread the entire sheet, as the roll would be too thick and would not have a closing end. Make sure that the end of the sheet that is closest to your stomach is also very thinly spread with rice, as you will be piling ingredients horizontally across an imaginary row. Some people even leave a small row closest to the stomach entirely empty.",
      "I always wait to cut the avocado, as it browns quickly. You can dab the avocado with lemon juice to slow down the process. Cut on the long side of the avocado so you have a thin slice. I often begin by starting with a very thin slice, so I do not waste the avocado and expose too much of it. You can get a fair amount of pieces from one thin layer. Use a spoon to cut pieces depending on how large you want them.",
      "Use a small bowl of water to dip your fingers in, and glide them across the exposed nori sheet that does not have any rice on it. This will allow it to stick upon completion of rolling. You are now ready to begin the process. For the first layer, imagine four separate sections as you look from left to right. It is also helpful to have a mat with grooves/lines that will help form those sections. For each section, add a small piece of avocado, shrimp with tempura bits/shrimp tempura and a small piece of cream cheese. Repeat this three more times. You can leave a space or choose not to, but be aware of the sections until you're ready to cut.",
      "For the second layer, you might have to slice along the broiled eel to create two thin strips. It depends on how much unagi you prefer. Be careful not to overload, as this makes it difficult to roll. When you are satisfied, gently place the eel on top of the first layer. Envision the head, so make sure that there is a piece of the roll that extends from outside of the mat. You may also have to add a bit more unagi to create your layer, depending on how long your strip is. What you should see down below are the two stacked layers closest to your stomach, a bed of rice just north of it and an exposed row of wet nori to the north of the rice.",
      "To maintain stability, you might want to hold the two layers in place as you roll. Continue to roll and press as you move along. If you do have ridges on your mat, press against them to make it easier for cutting. Make sure you do not jam down too hard, as I have pancaked my maki a few times this way. You should be able to seal the roll thanks to the watery end.",
      "Expose your roll that has the little unagi head sticking out. It's not the end of the world if it doesn't appear perfectly roll-like. You can use your mat to shape it a bit. Cut four pieces to make the four imaginary sections suddenly come to life. Sprinkle the top of the roll with roe. You can use pickled ginger to create a tongue or shrimp tempura to create a lovely tail. Feel free to experiment to create eyes and other parts.",
      "Place 1/2 teaspoon of wasabi in a bowl and mix it with soy sauce. This can be used as your dipping sauce for each piece. Enjoy the dragon!"

Mince the ginger and green onions and add to the tuna. Blend in the egg whites, wine and the soy sauce. Toss, and chill in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.",
      "To assemble: Keep a cup of water, your filling, and your wrappers handy. Lay a few wrappers out flat on a countertop. Place about 1-ounce of filling into the center of a wrapper using a tablespoon. Dip your finger in the water (or use a wet brush) and run your wet finger (or wet brush) along 2 connected edges of the wrapper. (Say, for example, the left side and the bottom.) The area you are creating here is a moist strip along the half of the perimeter where water is applied. Fold the wrapper over on the diagonal. The 2 moist sides will bond to their dry counterparts to make a nice little triangular pocket. Remember that the water acts like a glue. Thus, if wet edges are folded to the dry edges, all is well; otherwise, your pot stickers will come open. (If you get pulled away in the process of assembling, cover the wrappers with a kitchen towel to keep them moist until you get back.).",
      "To give the folded-over wrappers that traditional pot sticker look, pick up the wrapper and fold over the sides that have been joined with water in a pleating action. Make 3 or 4 pleats. Put the assembled wrappers on a parchment-lined pan, but make sure that they do not touch each other. If they are left touching, they will stick together, which is bad news because, when you go to separate them, you will have pot stickers with holes. However, this is less of a problem if you use traditional pot sticker wrappers, as they are thicker. When all of the pot stickers are assembled in wrappers, you can cook them immediately at this point or you can freeze them for future cooking. We use to freeze them by the hundreds at the Diner, placing them in airtight containers more suited for freezer storage.",
      "For the potstickers: Heat a griddle, wok, or pan over medium-high heat. When hot, cover the bottom with nonstick spray. Put the potstickers in the pan and cover with a tight-fitting lid (or, if you are working on a griddle, use a pan to cover the pot stickers).",
      "Lift the lid, toss in about a quarter of a cup of water, and quickly close the lid. Let the potstickers steam for about 4 minutes. If you really need to satisfy your curiosity and take a peek, just be sure to add more water. The end result should be that the pot stickers have a crispy golden brown bottom and a soft pasta top. We use to serve them at the Diner on a bed of garlic-sauteed spinach with a soy dipping sauce. (Chopsticks are provided.) I also recommend them with any good commercial spicy chili oil. To make the soy dipping sauce, mix equal parts soy and rice wine or black vinegar. Enjoy!"

Place the divided mixture directly in the center of two of the four patties. Take the last two remaining patties and one on top of each the cream cheese topped patties, sealing the edge. You should know have two stuffed burgers. (It may seem difficult to seal the edges together. If you are having a problem with this, use a basic egg wash upon the edges of the burger where you intended on conjoining them). On the bottom of each of the two burgers, squish a half of the habanero (can be removed after cooking. It is only truly needed for the flavoring, but makes a great addition if left on for eating).",
      "Now, heat the large frying pan to a low-med and allow to season with the Tbs of olive oil. Once seasoning is completed, cook the burgers to the desired temperature. Some stuffing may leak, do not worry it is normal. When cooking is completed, remove the burgers, and allow the pan to cool and wash (or utilize a second pan).",
      "Place a tortilla onto the pan and sprinkle with half of the shredded cheese. Allow cheese to begin to melt. Place one finished burger off-center of the tortilla. The outer edge of the burger should be flush with the outer edge of the tortilla. When cooking is completed, top the burger with 2 oz lettuce, and 2 slices avocado. Fold the remainder of the tortilla over the burger and remove from the pan. Repeat this process for the second burger."
