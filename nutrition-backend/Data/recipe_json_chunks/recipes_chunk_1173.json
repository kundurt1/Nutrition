(It is not necessary to cut up garlic. It'll fall apart -- and your fingers won't smell for days.) When ham hocks have cooled enough to handle, remove skin and discard. Remove meat from bones and gristle from meat. Shred meat and return to pot. Return large bones to pot. Cook on low for another hour or until peas melt in your mouth, keeping them covered with water and stirring as needed to prevent sticking. Peas should be like a bean soup with plenty of liquid, or you can smash up a few peas to create a smooth, thick consistence.",
      "Carefully, salt to taste. Remove bay leaves and bones. Serve with a dash of vinegar (malt, if possible) and steamed white rice (to cool the palate -- optional). Makes 30 1/2-cup servings. Recipe may be halved. Do not freeze leftovers."

Combine the sugar and water in a very small (e.g., 1/4- to 1/3-cup size) microwave-safe bowl, stirring until the sugar is moistened. Heat in the microwave for 20 to 30 seconds, until the mixture is bubbly. Carefully remove from the microwave (sugar syrup is very hot), and stir in the vanilla. Stir until the mixture smoothes out. Drizzle or brush the topping over the hot scones.",

      "In a separate mixing bowl, beat the egg yolks. Once the pastry cream starts to boil, transfer 1/2 cup of the pastry cream to the egg yolks and whisk to temper. Return the mixture to the saucepan. Continue whisking until the mixture coats the back of a spoon and is smooth and thick. Strain.",
      "Remove from the heat and stir in the butter, and vanilla. Stir in 1 cup sliced bananas. Allow the mixture to cool.",
      "Stir the custard to loosen, if necessary. Cover the bottom of the prepared crust with more sliced bananas and drizzle with 1/4 cup Salted Caramel Sauce. Top with half of the sliced bananas, then 1 cup custard, covering the bananas completely. Repeat layering with the remaining bananas and the remaining custard. Chill the banana cream pie until the filling is set, about 2 hours.",
      "For the topping:",
      "In a medium bowl, whip the cream until soft peaks form. Add the sugar, and vanilla and whip until stiff peaks form.",

Transfer dough to pie plate, pressing the dough lightly into the plate; trim the edges. Dock the dough with the prongs of a fork evenly over the bottom of the pie plate. Line the docked dough with aluminum foil and fill with pie weights or dried beans.",
      "Bake the pie crust until the edges are brown and golden, about 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and remove the weights. Return crust to the oven to finish baking for another 5 minutes.",
      "Yield: 1 (9-inch) pie crust.",
      "Salted Caramel Sauce:",
      "In a heavy-bottomed saucepan, combine the sugar and water over medium-low heat until the sugar dissolves. Increase the heat and bring to a boil without stirring. If necessary, use a wet pastry brush to wash down any crystals on the side of the pan. Boil until the syrup is a deep amber color, about 5 to 6 minutes.",
      "Remove from the heat and carefully whisk in the heavy cream. The mixture will bubble. Stir in the unsalted butter, and salt, to taste. Transfer the caramel to a dish and cool.",
      "Yield: 1 1/2 cups sauce.",

    "title": "chili lime salsa",
    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "Tip 1: As with most salsas and sauces, this salsa is best made a day in advance in order for the flavors to meld. It can be stored in the fridge for up to a week.",
      "Tip 2: Use ripe tomatoes! This is the perfect recipe to use up tomatoes that are getting mushy. If you can't get fresh garden tomatoes, use Romas from the store for best flavor You can place the tomatoes in a paper bag for 24 hours to ripen them further if needed. It's important to de-seed the tomatoes so that your salsa is not watery. See directions below.",
      "Tip 3: Cilantro stems contain a ton of flavor, so use them! It will save you time by not having to pluck the leaves off.",
      "Tip 4: When juicing any citrus fruit, you'll get more juice if the fruit is warm. After zesting, zap your naked limes in the microwave for 15-30 seconds before cutting in half and juicing.",
      "Tip 5: White onions have that sharp flavor that you need to give salsa it's kick, so don't substitute.",
      "Tip 6: The heat of a jalapeno comes from its seeds, so de-seed them if you want a milder salsa. I usually de-seed one, and leave the seeds of the other. OPTIONAL: For richer flavor, you can fire roast your peppers over a gas burner, or in a cast iron skillet on an electric stove . Once they are black on all sides, seal them in a plastic baggie to sweat for 30 minutes, then peel them. ALWAYS WEAR GLOVES when handling peppers.",
      "Tip 7: You can make your own taco seasoning, or use a packet. I prefer McCormick HOT taco seasoning because it has the most flavor. Don't worry, there's not enough cayenne in the packet to make your salsa too spicy. If you want it spicier, add additional cayenne or extra chopped jalapeno with seeds.",
      "To begin, you'll need a very large mixing bowl, a medium bowl that a strainer/colander will fit in, and a small bowl for juice/trash/seeds.",
      "Cut tomatoes into quarters, remove core, then use your fingers to scoop out the seeds and juice into the small bowl, leaving the empty \"shell\" of the tomato. Using a very sharp knife, chop the tomatoes into small, quarter inch pieces. place the chopped tomato in the strainer over the medium bowl to drain any additional liquid. When all the tomatoes are in the strainer, sprinkle them with the salt and stir, then allow them to rest in the bowl for about 30 minutes while you prep the other ingredients. The salt will draw out extra moisture and drain it into the bowl below.",
      "Rinse the entire bunch of cilantro under cold water, then blot it dry with paper towels. Mince the cilantro, including the stems. Add cilantro to the large mixing bowl.",
      "Peel and chop the onion into very small pieces, a little larger than a mince, and add it to the large bowl.",
      "De-seed jalapenos as desired, then chop finely and add to large bowl.",
      "Zest two limes, add zest to bowl. Then warm the limes and juice both into the bowl.",
      "Add the cans of chilies and tomato sauce, the minced garlic, and the taco seasoning to the bowl.",
      "Now add the strained, salted tomatoes to the bowl and stir the salsa well. Add additional salt and seasonings to taste. When tasting, be sure to use a tortilla chip. Sometimes it seems like you need more salt, but tasting it with the salty chip will be enough.",
      "For best flavor, refrigerate 24 hours."

Keep in mind cream style corn makes it more moist -- when using this ingredient, you should have a few moist crumbs stuck to your toothpick, but not a big wet streak. During the last few minutes of baking, you can sprinkle cheddar cheese on and let it melt. Go easy, if at all with the cheese on the muffin pan because it's a pain to clean it off the pan if it sticks. I normally use the cheese when making chili too."

Strain the stock through a fine sieve lined with a double layer of dampened cheesecloth and set over a saucepan. Reserve 6 cups of the stock, and discard the vegetables and seasonings.",

Set this shell and all the fat aside, and discard the intestinal matter.",

      "For each stuffed crawfish head, scoop up about 1 tablespoonful of the stuffing and pack it tightly into one of the reserved shells. Immerse each head in the beaten eggs and turn it about in the flour to coat it evenly. As you proceed, set the stuffed heads aside on a platter or wax paper.",

      "Shortly before you plan to serve the bisque, bring it to a simmer over moderate heat. Stir in the remaining cup of ground crawfish meat and 1 teaspoon of red pepper and simmer, partially covered, for about 15 minutes. Taste for seasoning. Ladle the bisque into a large heated tureen or individual soup plates and, just before serving, drop in the crawfish heads."
