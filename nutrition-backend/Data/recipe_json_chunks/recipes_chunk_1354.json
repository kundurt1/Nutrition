Meanwhile, in a small bowl, combine all of the ingredients for the herbed yogurt sauce and stir well to combine. Whenever I add raw garlic to a sauce that won't be cooked, I recommend grating it with your microplane so no one bites down on a big chunk of garlic (aka, the opposite of yum).

When the rice is a a few minutes away from being done put on the pan for the duck. It should be more than large enough to hold all 4 breasts. I prefer a cast iron pan for this. Put the duck into the pan dry, there will be more than enough fat from the duck skin. Save this fat for cooking, there's nothing nicer!Turn over the breasts and place under the broiler. Blanch your asparagus and throw all of the stems straight into the risotto add the saffron \"tea\" and the cheese. Take the breasts out of the oven and rest them for 5 minutes not a second less. Make a mound of the risotto just off of the centre of the plate. Fan out the duck around 1 side scatter the tips of asaragus over the top and the tomatoes and chives around the other side."

Although the mixture will be fairly soft, the pitching ensures the meat mass will hold together. Divide the meat mixture into 4 equal portions, and shape each portion into an oval patty about 4 inches long, 2 1/2 inches wide, and 3/4 inch thick.",

Lower the heat, add the remaining 1 tablespoon sake, cover, and cook for 5 to 6 minutes for medium-rare. To check for doneness, press the meat with your fingertip or the back of a spoon. It should feel fairly firm. Then, poke a patty with a toothpick. The juices should run slightly pink. For a well-done burger, cook, covered, for 8 to 10 minutes. When pressed, the meat will feel very firm and juices will run clear.",

If you use a food processor, you run the risk of having your dish turn to mush. How much mayonnaise one uses is a matter of personal taste. The suggested amount of 1/2 to 1 cup is strictly a gauge.

Begin heating the olive oil to a temperature suitable for browning. Prepare your veggies and herbs and put them aside. Your oil should be hot enough for browning by now. Put shanks and chunks into hot oil for browning. Brown both sides, then remove. Lower the heat and wait a few minutes -- then add all of your veggies and herbs. Also, add about 1/2 cup of water to the mixture. When the mixture re-boils, put the meat back in, stir it all up and cover. Reduce heat to simmer and let braise for about 1/2 hour. (Start boiling your pasta water now) Stir it again and taste a chunk for tenderness. Remove the meat if tender or continue cooking per your best judgment until tender. Remove the meat and add your red wine -- again, to taste -- stir. Now cook your pasta. I find that penne or shells are the best sauce collectors. Turn the heat off of the meat/veggie mixture but keep it warm and covered. When the pasta is done (drain, of course) mix the sauce and the pasta. Serve the pasta and put the meat on a side dish. A dash of salt at this time is wonderful on both the meat and the pasta. So is a grated hard cheese! Tossed salad makes a good accompaniment."

Cover the cake completely with the rest of the orange frosting.",

For the eyes, cut 2 triangles about 1 1/2 inches wide at the base and 1 1/2 inches tall at the center. For the nose, cut another triangle a little smaller than the eyes. Cut the smile to be about 4 inches from tip to tip. You can draw a paper pattern first if you like.",

Spoon mounds of the filling, about 2 teaspoons each, onto half of the wet side of the dough, leaving about a 1/2 inch between the mounds. Fold the dry half of the sheet over lengthwise to cover the filling. Press the pasta sheets together to seal the edges around the filling, and press out any excess air. Use a pastry cutter or knife to cut individual ravioli. As you cut out the ravioli, place them on a plate or baking sheet sprinkled with flour to keep them from sticking. Repeat with the remaining pasta and filling.",

This is akin to sweating an onion, you want translucency, not golden color. Slightly increase the heat and add the rice, stirring frequently to completely coat the rice with the hot butter, cook for a few minutes until the rice is no longer opaque. Cooking the risotto rice and ramps in this way adds texture and flavor to the final dish.",

Stir, letting the rice absorb the liquid almost entirely before adding a small amount more. The rice should be cooking at a moderate temperature and slowly bubbling as you continue stirring and adding liquid. This will take about 15 minutes total. Taste the rice for doneness: it should have lost its \"raw\" crunch , but still be firm in the middle.",
      "Cook for a minute or two longer, then add the remaining butter, lemon zest and lemon juice. Stir in the ramp greens and season the risotto with more salt and fresh black pepper. Adjust the consistency with a little more hot stock if necessary (the finished dish should be smoothly emulsified and pourable without being watery)."
