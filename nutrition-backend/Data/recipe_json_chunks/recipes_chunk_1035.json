In a 2 qt saucepan, melt butter gently over low heat. We don't want the butter to brown, so just be patient and melt it slowly. Add your flour, turn the heat up just a smidge until the roux begins to bubble ever so slightly, and using a whisk stir constantly for about a minute.",

You can add another chipotle/jalepeno or you can cheat and just add a few drops of your favorite hot sauce.

      "FOR THE SOURDOUGH STARTER: Stir the 1 1/2 cups flour (use a soft wheat flour like White Lily if the primary use of your flour is for biscuits; if you vary frequently between biscuits and bread, use all purpose flour)and 2 cups mineral water or spring water together in a large plastic or earthenware bowl. Add the bunch of grapes, pushing it down into the gooey batter. Cover the bowl lightly, with cheesecloth or a dishtowel, so that the starter continues to get air. Leave the bowl in a warm place.",
      "Each day give the bowl another tablespoon of flour and one tablespoon of water, stirring to incorporate the additions. Within a couple of days the mixture should show signs of \"starting,\" bubbling up a bit as yeasts feed on the starch and sugar. If this doesn't happen, throw the mixture out and begin again. Continue feeding the starter each day with one tablespoon flour and one tablespoon of water. If the mixture separates, stir it back together. After about 5 days, the starter will begin to smell sour. The smell won't be unpleasant, and won't overwhelm your kitchen.",
      "Let the starter ferment another few days, continuing to feed it. You'll end up with a mass that looks like a thick pancake batter. Remove the grapes with a slotted spoon, and discard them.",
      "Cover the starter, and refrigerate it. Take the starter out of the refrigerator the evening before you plan to use it, or even a couple of days ahead for a more sour taste to the bread or biscuits. Every time you use the starter, replenish it. For each cup of starter you remove, add 1/2 cup flour and 1/2 cup water. Let it sit on the counter again for about a day before putting it back in the refrigerator. If you don't want to use the starter at least once every week or two, just feed it that often: Pour off about a half cup of starter, and add 1/4 cup flour and 1/4 cup water.",
      "Properly tended, the starter can last for years, developing more complexity over time. It can be used for sourdough pancakes, breads, and other dishes in addition to biscuits.",
      "FOR THE SOURDOUGH BISCUITS: Preheat the oven to 425\u00b0F.",
      "Sift together the flour, and salt into a medium bowl. Add the starter, and stir with a sturdy spoon until the flour is incorporated in the dough. It will remain sticky.",
      "Flour a pastry board or your counter. Grease or flour your hands to make kneading the dough easier. Turn the dough out, and knead lightly a few times, just until it is smooth. The dough will remain soft. Pinch off pieces of dough about the size of eggs, or, for a more modern look, roll out the dough and cut it with biscuit cutter.",
      "Melt the bacon drippings (for real range flavor) or butter in a cast iron skillet or Dutch oven. Dip one side of the biscuit in the fat, and then put it in the pan with its other side down. (Or melt the fat in a small dish, dip each biscuit in the fat, then place the biscuit on a baking sheet.) Arrange the biscuits so they just touch one another, which helps them rise.",

    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "You will need a heavy-bottomed nonstick skillet or saute pan, 10-inch diameter or wider.",
      "To make the ribbons: Stack three or four cooled scrippelle evenly, and roll them up into a cylinder, about the size of a cigar. With a sharp knife, slice the roll crosswise every 2/3 inch (for thin strips like tagliatelle) or every inch (for wider strips, like fettuccine). Separate and unfurl the cut pieces into ribbons. Continue to slice up all the scrippelle this way.",
      "Put the sugar in the skillet, pour 1/3 cup water over it, and shake the pan a bit to spread out the moistened sugar. Set the skillet over medium-high heat, and, without stirring, let the sugar dissolve into a syrup and come to a boil. Don't stir or shake the pan as it bubbles away, evaporating all the water and nearing the temperature of caramelization-this can take 10 minutes or more. Have the remaining sauce ingredients (butter, apricot preserves, and citrus juices) near at hand, as well as a long wooden spoon for stirring, and thick kitchen towels for holding the pan.",
      "When the syrup bubbles become noticeably thicker, watch closely for it to take on color, usually near the edge of the skillet. At the first signs of darkening, lower the heat and swirl the syrup, so it caramelizes evenly to a deep-golden color. Still over low heat, drop in the butter and the apricot preserves, and stir steadily as they melt into the caramel. Pour in the lemon and orange juices, stirring carefully, because the caramel will bubble and splatter.",
      "Raise the heat, and bring the sauce back to a boil, stirring steadily. Adjust the heat to keep it at a simmer, and drop in the scrippelle ribbons. Toss and tumble the strips with tongs or long-handled utensils, for a minute or more, until they're heated through and glazed all over with the caramel sauce.",
      "Turn off the heat, lift out one serving of ribbons, and drop it onto a dessert plate-giving the ribbons twist as you release them to make a pretty nestlike mound. Top each serving with a big spoonful of whipped cream and a scattering of pine nuts. Drizzle any sauce left in the skillet over and around the ribbons, and serve right away."

If you like, you can take the tomato out and place on a plate or in a bowl to do this, just make sure you keep the juices. If the tomatoes are not fully ready to be skinned, put the lid back on and check every 5 minutes. (This is the most time consuming part, but once you get the hang of it, it becomes really simple.).",

Repeat until ball looks uniform and no newspaper shows through (you may want to lay down a \"primer\" coat first in a neutral color). Once silver is dry, paint \"Death Star\" details in black: paint a line around the \"equator.\" One one side near the top of the ball, paint a medium sized (about 4\" diameter) circle with decreasingly smaller circles inside for the \"superlaser\" disk. Some vertical and horizontal lines will suggest detail. Once dry, attach string to top by poking 2 holes in the top and threading it through. Add candy, etc to about 1/3 full, and tape shut. Lift by the string - if the string starts to tear the pinata, reinforce with hot glue.",

Press vertically to the bottom of the mop/broom stick (for the handle). Wrap foam taughtly around stick. Apply a line of glue to the already glued down edge and press foam to it (foam will overlap). Allow glue to cool slightly, cut end off until edges are flush. Apply another line of glue over seam, if needed. Repeat 4 times with blue or green foam, each level flush with the previous, until stick is covered.

Older kids should be blindfolded. This pinata should be strong enough that 6-8 younger kids should get a turn, and it should start breaking apart (no adult help needed!) during the second round."
