    "title": "maple butter turkey",
    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "The night before: Take butter and place in bowl to soften. Once the butter has softened to roughly room temperature, put in the bowl the maple syrup, herbs, the zest of the lemon, and juice from 1/2 of same lemon. Stir well until it has an almost whipped consistency. Cover and refrigerate.",
      "When ready to make the turkey the next day, preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F.",
      "Take butter mixture out of fridge and set on counter. Take giblets and etc. out of turkey. Put the gibblets in a saucepan on the stove, adding water to cover. Clean the turkey. After cleaning, take a sharp knife (fillet knife recommended) and carefully slice the membrane right under the skin at the hind end of the bird to separate the skin and the meat. After separating an inch or so if skin from meat, use hand(s) to very carefully continue the process for the rest of the breast sections. If a rip happens, take a metal pin or some other such implement and patch it back together. Be careful not to leave any broken skin patches, no matter how small.",
      "By this time the butter mixture should be about room temperature. Using about 1/2 to 3/4 of the mixture, mash the butter mixture under the skin (still being careful not to break the skin) covering as much of the meat as possible. Once the meat under the skin has been covered, use the remaining about on hands to smear the rest of the bird with the mixture. Put rest of butter mixture in with the giblet stock on the stove. Place turkey on a rack in your roasting pan.",
      "Taking a piece (or pieces) of cheesecloth that has had warm water run through it to get it moist, cover every inch of the exposed turkey. If your roasting pan has a cover, use it, otherwise take a couple sections of aluminum foil and use it to cover the turkey. Take turkey and place in hot oven and allow to cook uninterrupted for an hour and a half.",
      "While the turkey is cooking, prepare the basting sauce/stock by first bringing the giblet/butter mixture to a boil and then lower the temperature to a simmer. Leave mixture simmering throughout the process.",
      "After the first hour and a half is up, take turkey out of the oven, carefully remove aluminum cover (leave cheesecloth on) and baste liberally with giblet/butter mixture. Repeat this process every half hour. If the mixture on the stove runs out, use the drippings that are in the bottom of the pan. Once the turkey is nearing it's last 10-20 minutes of cooking, baste a final time and place back in oven completely uncovered. Take out roughly 3 minutes before done, re-cover with aluminum foil, and place back in oven. This is to have the inner sanctum reheated to keep the bird nice and warm during the resting period.",
      "After the bird has finished cooking (see Cooking Times below), let the bird rest in pan, covered, for at least a half hour (an hour would be better) before carving.",
      "Cooking Times: The bird will require approximately 13-15 minutes per pound total cooking time (this includes the first hour and half in oven). These times are approximate, though, and there are only two real methods of telling when the bird needs to come out of the oven: probe thermometer and the little turkey done indicator. The probe thermometer is more reliable but can be more of a hassle. Basically you will want to place the probe into the turkey no less than an hour before your expected done time. The magic temperature that you are looking for is 160 degrees. Once the bird hits that, remove it from the oven. Carryover heat will take it the rest of the way. If using a turkey done indicator, pull out of the oven when you see it start moving or looking like it's going to pop soon."

      "Make sure that all meats and vegetables are chopped thin enough to cook quickly in the broth. For beef and chicken, I suggest no more than a centimeter in width and leave in broth for approximately 3 minutes. For fish, choose fillets that have more integrity such as salmon or tuna and slice pieces no larger than 1/4 an inch and leave in broth for approximately 4 minutes. Shrimp are great dippers as they only require shelling and deveining, but no pre-cutting.",
      "Any and all veggies are great in this broth. Like with the meat, it needs to be chopped thinly. I recommend precooking many veggies before using them as dippers. Many veggies are too hard in their raw form to cook in a timely manner in the broth. The easiest way to do this is to bring a pot of water to a boil. Add a generous amount of salt to the water. Add veggies and cook for 3-8 minutes depending on toughness of veggies. Transfer veggies to ice water and hold for 2-5 minutes. This partially cooks veggies, so they only need 3 minutes in the broth.",
      "If you are using meat dippers, I highly recommend putting them in the broth first, as they add flavor to the broth which will enhance the flavor of your veggies later.",
      "Also if you are including mushrooms as a dipper (which I highly recommend!) treat them like a meat. Do not precook them like other veggies, as the water they release during cooking will add flavor to the broth. I suggest that you add mushrooms early with the meats and allow them to cook for about 7 minutes. Mushrooms take longer, but if you are doing meats and veggies, they will be ready to eat about the same time as the veggies, and they are definitely worth waiting for.",
      "Above all, enjoy yourself, and have fun with your fondue!"

It will most likely be around 15 cups (I believe it may be less if you are in a lower altitude area). If the dough mixture isn't \"cleaning\" the sides of the mixer, it is too wet. I sometimes add up to one additional cup -- I think altitude and humidity influence how much is needed, as well as how packed the flour is (if I get my mill full and \"packed\" the recipe takes less flour -- hence the need to add a l/2 cup at the end of the ingredient addition process.",

Knead the dough lightly - too much handling will toughen it, while too little means it won't rise properly. It should require a couple of minutes at most. Basically you're adding the buttermilk as you're kneading it just enough to work the ingredients together properly at which point it needs to be baked straight away in the hot oven.",
      "If using a baking tray rather than a loaf tin, then form a round loaf about as thick as your fist. Otherwise shape it to a similar size but such as will fit in the loaf tin.",
      "Place it on a lightly-floured baking tray and lightly cut a cross in the top with a floured knife \"to let the faeries out so they don't jinx your bread\", or just put it in the loaf tin and lengthways cut a line along the top.",
      "Put at once to bake near the top of the pre-heated oven. Bake for about 35-45 minutes. \"When baked, the loaf will sound hollow when rapped on the bottom with your knuckles.\".",
      "Wrap immediately in a clean tea-towel if you prefer the crust to be softer.",
      "This bread will keep well for a couple of days if very well wrapped. If unwrapped it will dry out very quickly - within half a day. It freezes beautifully.",
      "Best served slightly warm on its own or with butter.",
      "Note:",
      "The Rankin recipe that I was copying does not use caraway seeds at all and uses sultanas not raisins. Some Irish fruit soda bread recipes use caraway seeds and a larger number don't. I love caraway seeds but I like this bread best without. I've listed as a suggestion only. I use Bread flour because I have plenty and I imagine it gives a better rise but I understand that plain flour (All Purpose Flour) works just fine-never used it myself.",
      "Historical notes:",
      "There are hundreds or thousands of recipes, most of them contain egg or rice flour or cornflour etc. Such ingredients would not have been available to most poor Irish families in towns and cities. The point of Irish Soda Breads (as well as Scottish Shortbreads for that matter) was that it was made by a people so poor that they could not even afford to buy yeast (which was not readily available) to bake their daily bread and was basically the normal bread such as they baked every day which had sugar and fruit added as a special sweet and fruity Sunday treat because they couldn't afford to make a proper cake.",
      "It's convenient from a cutting point of view if you've got a very small loaf tin, but a flat or round baking tray will do fine. It was originally made as round loaf sitting on a griddle (UK: basically a form of frying pan) baked in a Bastible (an iron baking pot - a type of oven - they were made in Barnstable, Devon hence the name) over the glowing embers of a peat turf fire. Because of the way the bread rises it's not essential to be so accurate as it is with a yeast-based bread so volume measures (cups and spoons) could just as easily be used instead if you don't have a set of kitchen scales as would have been the case across Ireland in the early 1800s when they were first made."

      "My Note: I used Jameson's Irish Whiskey. This sauce is awesome! We'll use it again and again. I followed those cooking instructions and used the dry rub from that recipe, as well. I used this sauce at the end where it calls for using your \"favorite bbq sauce.\" Hands-down, this is our favorite sauce recipe. Can't wait to try it on my grilled whole chicken breasts! Update 2/4/05 I always double the recipe. One new tip: I use a mini food processor to mince the onions, but you still get small pieces in the sauce. It's great that way, but this time, after fully cooking the sauce, I let it cool and blended it in a regular blender. Awesome smooth texture, terrific flavor! Now we have two options."
