      "Make the flour mixture and add to the sponge. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour (reserve 1/4 cup if mixing by hand), dry milk, and instant yeast. Sprinkle this on top of the sponge and cover tightly with plastic wrap. Allow it to ferment for 1 to 4 hours at room temperature. (During this time, the sponge will bubble through the flour blanket in places: this is fine).",
      "Mix the dough.",
      "HAND METHOD.",
      "Add the salt and butter to the bowl and, with a wooden spoon or with your hand, stir until all the flour is moistened. Knead the dough in the bowl until it comes together, then scrape it onto a lightly floured counter. Knead the dough for 5 minutes, enough to develop the gluten structure a little, adding as little of the reserved flour as possible to keep the dough from sticking. Use a bench scraper to scrape the dough and gather it together as you knead it. At this point, it will be very sticky. Cover it with an inverted bowl and allow it to rest for 20 minutes. (This resting time will make the dough less sticky and easier to work with).",
      "Knead the dough for another 5 minutes or until it is very smooth and elastic. It should still be tacky enough to cling slightly to your fingers a little. If the dough is still very sticky, however, add some of the remaining reserved flour, or a little extra.",
      "Shape the dough and let it rise. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured counter and cut it in half. Shape each piece into a loaf; the exact size is not important at this point. (A long side of the dough should be facing toward you). Dimple the dough with your fingers to deflate any large bubbles. Fold over the right side of the dough to a little past the center. Fold over hte left side of the dough to overlap it slightly. Press the center overlap section with the side of your hand to seal the dough. (If you have a lot of experiance shaping, you may prefer at this point to rotate the dough 90 degrees- a quarter turn). Starting at the top end of the dough, roll it over three or four times, until it reaches the bottom edge of the dough: with each roll, press with your thumbs to seal it and at the same time push it away from you slightly to tighten the outer skin. As you roll and press, the dough will become wider. If it is not as long as the pan, place both hands close together on top of the dough and, rolling back and fourth, gradually work your way towards the ends, gently stretching the dough. For the most even shape, it is important to keep a tight skin on the surface of the dough and not to tear it. If you want the edges of the loaf to be smooth, tuck the sides under. Place the loaves in the prepared loaf pans; the dough will be about 1/2 inch from the top of the pans. Cover them with a large container, or cover them loosely with oiled plastic wrap, and allow to rise until the center is about 1 inch above the sides of the pan, 1 1/2 to 2 hours. When the dough is pressed with a fingertip, the depression will very slowly fill inches.",

Bake for 50 minutes or until medium golden brown and a skewer inserted in the middle comes out clean (an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center will read about 210\u00b0F).

I slide the 2 sides right next to each other, then carefully flip one on top of the other, then tightly wrap and seal the entire sandwich and place in frig at least 2 hours -- Overnight is even better but 2 hours will do. Then leaving it wrapped put it in a 350 oven and bake for 45 minutes to an hour, has to heat all the way through and let the cheese melt. Carefully unwrap and make sure it is hot all the way through( if needed rewrap and cook a bit longer) Once it is done let it sit 15-20 minutes, then you can cut into sandwich slices( electric knife works best, or a good serrated edged bread knife) I like my portions cut into 2 inch slices , remember it is a rich sandwich and larger portions tend to fall apart on you. Best served hot, to at least warm and it keeps in frig real well and reheats fairly well in microwave.",

In a bowl stir together yeast mixture, 1/3 cup of the water, and 1cup of the bread flour. Stir 4 minutes, then over bowl with plastic wrap. Let sponge stand at cool room temperature for at least 12 hours and up to 1 day.",
      "2. To Make Bread: In a small bowl stir together yeast and milk and let stand 5 minutes, or until creamy. In bowl of a standing electric mixer fitted with dough hook blend together milk mixture, sponge, water, oil, and flour at low speed until flour is just moistened; add salt and mix until smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes. Scrape dough into an oiled bowl and cover with plastic wrap.",
      "3. Let dough rise at room temperature until doubled in bulk, about 1 1/2 hours. (Dough will be sticky and full of air bubbles.) Turn dough out onto a well-floured work surface and cut in half. Transfer each half to a parchment sheet and form into an irregular oval about 9 inches long. Dimple loaves with floured fingers and dust tops with flour. Cover loaves with a dampened kitchen towel. Let loaves rise at room temperature until almost doubled in bulk, 1 1/2 to 2 hours.",
      "4. At least 45 minutes before baking ciabatta, put a baking stone on oven rack in lowest position in oven and preheat oven to 425*F. (220*C).",
      "5. Transfer 1 loaf on its parchment to a rimless baking sheet with a long side of loaf parallel to far edge of baking sheet. Line up far edge of baking sheet with far edge of stone or tiles, and tilt baking sheet to slide loaf with parchment onto back half of stone or tiles. Transfer remaining loaf to front half of stone in a similar manner. Bake ciabatta loaves 20 minutes, or until pale golden. Cool loaves on a wire rack.",
      "My Note: * The second time I made the sponge I left it right next to a warm stove top and it rose very quickly and made these HUGE air pockets in my finished product. I only left this for 4 hours but the taste and texture were FANTASTIC and the sponge almost spilled over the rim of the bowl! It was a bit difficult to get out of the bowl because of its stickiness but that was to be expected. For those that thought the sponge needed water, it doesn't. It will look just like a clump of dough in the beginning but if you leave it you'll be pleasantly surprised with a bubbling, frothy, sticky sponge. Secondly, I made this recipe cautiously because I expected it to be very difficult to handle, but it was not.",
      "I prepared the sponge two days in advance and kept it in the fridge. I had no problems with it being too sticky. I cooked it on a pizza stone and basted with water every 5 minutes for a brown, crunchy crust. The parchment did burn a little around the edges while baking, but it was reminiscent of an old Italian bakery.",
      "The easiest 'real sourdough' recipe; those without 'aging' of dough lack the genuine ciabatta taste, even though they may get the consistancy right. This one gets even better with more than one days aging of the 'sponge'.",
      "I have fallen in love with making bread these past few months, and this is the best recipe I have have did, by far. I have made at least 12 loaves with this, and every time I make it, my friends devour it instantly. I have modified it a little, though. I found the original recipe to be too dry for my tastes when it came out of the over, so I tripled the olive oil, and it came out moist and delicious. Add more oil to the recipe and you're in great shape. I love this bread! It was a little involved as far as prep time but it was easy, GOOD, and tasted just like what we had eaten in Florence! I will make it again. For 15 people I made 6 loaves with enough left over for dinner the next night."

Not to mention one night in the fridge with all those flavors mingling could up the heat substantially. Sometimes I use cayenne pepper to build heat bc it dosen't seem to have as strong of staying power on your tounge.

      "Start with the cake ingredients. In a large mixing bowl, mix the sugar, butter, eggs and vanilla on low speed until the mixture begins to get fluffy. This usually takes two or three minutes if your butter is nice and soft.",
      "Beat the mixture on high speed (the highest your mixer will go!) for five minutes, scraping the sides of the bowl to ensure complete mixing. This step is very important; do not skip it to save time! It will make all the difference in the fluffiness of the cake. The mixture should be pale and resemble cheesecake filling by the time you are finished mixing.",
      "Beat in the flour, baking powder, salt and milk alternately on low speed. The mixture will thicken considerably as more flour is added. This is great for giving those arm muscles a workout!",
      "Add the rum or rum flavoring and give the mixture a final mix on low speed. You can add a little more rum if you're so inclined, but too much will ruin the consistency of the cake. Save it for the glaze or get yourself a drink!",
      "Pour the mixture into your pan(s).",
      "Bake until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. For 13x9 pans this is approximately 45-50 minutes; for layers this is approximately 30-35 minutes.",
      "Let the cake cool while you make the glaze.",
      "Heat the butter in a small saucepan over low heat until it is fully melted.",
      "Slowly add the rum or rum flavoring and the powdered sugar. Make sure you take the time to dissolve the sugar, it can take a few minutes to fully melt. The glaze should thicken considerably by the time the last of the sugar is added. You can add more rum than the amount listed if you're so inclined, but too much will cause consistency problems.",
      "If the glaze is too thick, add hot water one tablespoon at a time until it reaches the consistency you want. For this cake I prefer leaving it on the thicker side (1-2 tablespoons of water at the most) but it is a matter of personal taste.",
      "Add the nutmeg and cinnamon. These spices are optional, but they add a lot of character to the glaze and give it a flavor similar to a hot buttered rum - yum! Add more if you like this combination, the amounts listed are conservative for what my family in particular enjoys!",
      "Let the glaze cool for a minute or two and then pour it over the top of the cooled cake. Use a spatula or spoon to help make sure the cake gets fully covered if the glaze is on the thicker side. To really make sure the glaze gets into the cake, you can poke holes in the top of the cake with a fork before pouring - this will help the cake soak up the glaze.",
      "Let the cake sit for at least half an hour before serving. This will give the glaze time to harden up a little and become more like a smooth frosting than a wet glaze.",
      "Serve and enjoy! You can sprinkle a little extra nutmeg and cinnamon over the top for presentation, but I've found that the taste of the cake requires no bells and whistles to get attention! It may look and feel simple, but this is deceptive once you get a taste of what you've made."

      "Saute Pork -- In a large baggie or you can use a pie plate or flat plate, add the flour, salt and pepper and dredge the pork in the flour mixture. Make sure to shake off any extra flour. In a large pan (I prefer a cast iron vs a non stick pan), add the olive oil and bring to medium / medium high heat. Then add the tenderloins and saute on each side until golden brown. They will only take 2-3 minutes per side and don't forget, they will continue to cook once removed. Transfer the medallions to a plate and cover to keep warm. They will need to rest a few minutes before you serve the dish.",
      "Keep the burner on, just set the pan off to the side.",
      "Asparagus and Crab -- As the pork is cooking, start your asparagus, it only takes a couple of minutes. I do this easy and make it right in the microwave, but you can steam it anyway you prefer. In a medium bowl, add the asparagus, 1 teaspoon of water and cover with saran wrap. Microwave for 1 minute, uncover, check to see if it is tender. If not, stir and cook for another 15 seconds at a time, until the asparagus is crisp tender. Remove from the microwave and press a piece of saran wrap right on top of the asparagus. Then add the crab right on top of the saran wrap, and then cover the entire bowl. This is an easy way to heat up the crab without cooking it. The heat from the asparagus will warm it up which is all you need.",
      "Pork Glaze -- Since the pork is resting, return the pan to the burner on medium heat and add in the wine, scraping up all the bits. Then add in the chicken broth and turn to medium low and just let it simmer. It will slightly thicken and reduce. This is not a heavy rich gravy and it is just a light drizzle, so don't expect a lot of the sauce.",
      "Bernaise -- Very easy. Add the butter to a small glass bowl and melt in the microwave on medium for 20-30 seconds until melted. Add in the eggs, shallot, vinegar, cream, lemon juice, tarragon, mustard, parsley, mustard, salt, pepper and cayenne if you want (optional). Return to the microwave, and cook 20-30 seconds at a time on medium-low stirring each time until thickened and smooth. It will take 3-4 times to get a rich perfect Bernaise. I know it isn't traditional, but sure is easy and works every time. But don't think that a higher temp will work, it will just scramble the eggs. A few times on medium heat is what works best.",
      "Plating -- On each plate, drizzle a little of the glaze. Then top with a couple of the pork medallions. Top with the asparagus, crab and finish with the bernaise sauce.",
      "It sounds like a lot, but break each step down. It really isn't hard at all. Serve with some oven roasted fingerling potatoes and a simple salad. Trust me your friends will be totally impressed. ENJOY!"
