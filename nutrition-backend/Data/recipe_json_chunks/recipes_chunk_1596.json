If wanting a thicker, tangier sauce with a hot finish, I highly recommend Ina's barbecue sauce below.

      "In a separate, medium-size bowl, place the flour, xanthan gum, baking powder and salt, and whisk to combine. Set the bowl aside. In the bowl of your KitchenAid(R) Pro Line(R) Series Stand Mixer fitted with the Flat Beater, place the butter and beat on medium-high speed until light and fluffy. Add the sugar, then the eggs and vanilla, beating to combine well after each addition. Add the dry ingredients to the KitchenAid(R) Pro Line(R) Series Stand Mixer bowl in 3 parts, alternating with the milk, and beginning and ending with the dry ingredients. Mix until just combined. Remove the mixer bowl from the Stand Mixer, and fold the cooked apples into the smooth batter until evenly distributed throughout. Scrape the batter into the prepared cake pan and smooth into an even layer with a wet spatula.",
      "Remove the chilled crumble topping from the refrigerator and, using a fork, break the crumble into loose, irregular pieces. Place the crumble pieces on top of the cake batter in the pan in an even layer and press down gently to help the topping adhere to the cake.",
      "Place the cake pan back on the lined baking sheet, and place in the center of the preheated oven. Bake until the crumble topping is lightly golden brown all over and a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes back mostly clean, or with a few moist crumbs attached (about 45 minutes). When it's done, the top of the cake will spring back when pressed gently in the center. Remove from the oven and allow to cool in the pan for at least 30 minutes. Remove any bits of baked crumble topping that are sticking to the edge of the pan. They might make it difficult to remove the cake from the pan. Working quickly, invert the cake onto a plate and then re-invert the cake, so it is crumble-side up, onto a wire rack to cool completely. Slice and serve."

      "Once the cake has cooled, carefully run a knife along the tube and outer edge of the cake pan. Lift the cake straight up, and transfer to the wire baking rack.

Fit the hand mixer with the whisk attachment. Place the whisk into the bowl and turn to speed 3. Mix for 1 minute, or until the mixture begins to thicken and create ribbons. Gradually increase to speed 6 and whip the cream mixture until medium stiff peaks form, about 1.5-2 minutes. Mix It Up: Add 1/2 cup of fresh berries to the whipped cream for a refreshing twist. Transfer to a serving bowl, cover, and refrigerate until ready to serve. (The whipped cream can be made up to 8 hours in advance.) Refrigerate any leftover whipped cream in an airtight container.",
      "To serve, use a long, serrated knife to cut the cake into wedges. Spoon a dollop of whipped cream on-top of each slice and garnish with a light sprinkling of cocoa nibs. Serve immediately.",
      "Chef's Tips: - The cake is best when served on the day it is baked. - Replace the amaretto with your favorite liquor of choice. We recommend kirschwasser, brandy, or bourbon."

      "Both these recipes for flavoured butters use softened butter. The easiest way to soften butter, I think, is to take it out of the fridge overnight and leave it to soften naturally. If you forget to do this, then you can always pop the butter in the microwave. Take care though not to melt it; you just want to soften it.",
      "First make the Bordelaise butter. Place the chopped shallot, port and red wine in a small pan. For extra flavour, you can do this the night before and leave the mixture overnight to marinade. Bring to the boil and cook, stirring often, so that the liquid evaporates, leaving a syrupy mixture just coating the shallot, but doesn't burn. Set aside to cool.",
      "Now place the softened butter in a mixing bowl and mix well with a wooden spoon to further soften it. Add in the Knorr Beef Touch of Taste, mixing in well. Stir in the cooled shallot mixture and mix in thoroughly.",
      "Spread out a large square of cling-film on a work surface. Spoon the butter mixture in a line in the centre of the cling-film and bring it up over the butter, wrapping it up. Use your hands to roll the butter tightly in the cling-film, shaping it into a neat cylinder.",
      "Place the wrapped butter in the fridge for a few hours to allow the butter to firm up. You can make this butter ahead and store in the fridge or the freezer. This butter gives you eight portions.",
      "Now make the parsley butter. Place the softened butter in a mixing bowl and mix well with a wooden spoon to further soften it. Add in the parsley and mix in thoroughly. I've used parsley, but you could use tarragon or basil, whichever herb you like. Add in the Touch of Taste and mix well. What the Touch of Taste does to this butter is give a very nice meaty taste.",
      "Spread out a large square of cling-film on a work surface. Spoon the parsley butter mixture in a line in the centre of the cling-film and bring it up over the butter, wrapping it up. Use your hands to roll the butter tightly in the cling-film, shaping it into a neat cylinder.",
      "Place the wrapped butter in the fridge for a few hours to allow the butter to firm up. You can make this butter ahead and store in the fridge. You can also freeze it. This butter gives you eight portions.",
      "To cook your steaks, you first need to season them. Rather than salt, I prefer to season my steaks with a paste made from a Knorr Beef Stock Cube. Why do I do this? I think it tastes better and it helps the meat caramelise. Try my Marco Steak Challenge and see for yourself. Rub the Knorr Beef Stock Cube into a little olive oil, mixing together so that the cube thoroughly dissolves into the oil and makes a paste. Massage this paste into the steaks on both sides, spreading evenly.",
      "Heat a large, heavy frying pan until hot. Add a dash of olive oil to the hot pan and allow to heat through briefly. Add in your Knorr seasoned steaks and fry. Once they've browned nicely on one side, turn them over to brown the other side. As you fry them, make sure you baste them with the frying fat to keep them moist. Fry them until they're cooked to your taste. Most people like their steaks rare to medium-rare. Once you see the blood start to pierce the surface, then you know that they are rare to medium-rare. This is the simplest way to tell that they're ready.",
      "While the steaks are frying, pre-heat your grill to its highest second. Cut two nice thick slices from your flavoured butter, discarding the cling film from your slices. Transfer the pan-fried steaks onto a heatproof dish or baking sheet, top each steak with a slice of flavoured butter and place under the grill. Keep an eye on the steaks and grill until the butter has just half-melted. You want a nice piece of butter on top of the steak, with some melted butter. Serve at once. No technical ability required, just a few simple steps and some care and attention."

      "Chop the carrots, onion and celery as finely as possible. By chopping finely it allows all the flavours to be released into the bolognese. (My Mum used to mince all the garlic, celery, onions, carrots and meat together.), Take the garlic cloves (you can use as much or as little as you like), crush them with the back of your knife and then slice them finely. Once sliced, add a little salt to the slices. Using the back of your knife again, mash it into a paste. The salt helps to get the paste really smooth and fine, but you can just use a garlic crusher or a food processor.",
      "Add a generous amount of olive oil to a large saucepan or stove-top casserole.",

      "Meanwhile, bring a large pan of water to the boil for the pasta, seasoning the water with a splash of olive oil. Cook according to pack instructions. Drain., Once the bolognese is cooked, discard the thyme and bay leaves. These have released all their flavour and are no longer needed.",

Stir in the chard leaves, garlic, red pepper flakes, and cook and toss until the chard is wilted and any liquid that's been released by the chard has evaporated, about 4 minutes. Put the chard mixture in a medium mixing bowl, and let cool. Add the ground pork and egg. Squeeze the breadcrumbs to remove any remaining milk, and then add to the chard-pork mixture. Drain the currants and add them to the bowl along with the toasted pine nuts, rosemary, nutmeg, 2 teaspoons kosher salt and 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper. Stir until the stuffing is well combined.",
      "3. Prepare the pork belly for stuffing by cutting a pocket in the meat: place belly, skin side up, on work surface. Starting on one long side of the belly, with your knife parallel to the cutting board, insert the knife about 1/2 inch down from the skin, and 1 inch from side of the belly. Cut to the other side. Be careful not to cut through, stopping about 1 inch from the other side. You have now transformed the belly into a hollow tube. Using a very sharp knife or box cutter, score the skin in diagonal lines in both directions, about 3/4 inch apart and cutting no more than about 1/4 inch deep, being careful not to cut too deeply into the fat.",
      "4. Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F.",
      "5. Firmly pack the stuffing into the pocket, leaving the pocket open. Don't worry if some of the stuffing falls out of the opening. Put the stuffed pork belly, skin-side up, on a rack in a roasting pan, sprinkle generously with salt and freshly ground pepper, and place in the oven for approximately 21/2 hours or until the meat is tender when pierced with a fork. When the pork is done, if the skin is not golden and crackling crisp, increase the heat to 450\u00b0F and continue to roast for another 20 minutes.",
      "6. Remove the pork belly from the oven, tent with foil, and let rest for 20 minutes or up to 45 minutes before cutting into 3/4-inch slices. Consider serving the pork belly alongside mashed potatoes or soft polenta."

Alternatively, you can also remove the seeds of the red chili to reduce the spice. I haven't tried it with dried chilies, but I would imagine 5 dried chilis would be a little too spicy for my taste.
