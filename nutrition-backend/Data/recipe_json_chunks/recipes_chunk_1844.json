      "When all combined, gradually stir in salt/flour mixture until a stiff batter like dough is formed.",
      "***If your dough is too wet, don't be afraid to add more flour, a tablespoon at a time until it is dry enough to handle.",
      "It should come away from the mixing bowl in a 'ball' after kneading.",
      "Knead for 10 minutes using the dough hook or by hand if you don't have a stand mixer, again use more flour if kneading by hand if the dough is too sticky or wet to handle.",
      "Cover with a clean cloth and place somewhere warm to let rise for 1 hour or more, until the dough is doubled in size (or more than doubled for extra airy, light rolls).",

      "Put 9 balls (rolls), seam side down, into each pan.",
      "For a total of 18 rolls in 2 pans.",
      "After the balls are places in the pans, there will be quite a bit of room in the pans.",
      "That's okay, because they need to rise.",
      "Cover and let rise again until the rolls are doubled in size and taking up most, if not all of the pan.",

      "If not, return to the oven for another 5-10 minutes.",
      "Every oven is different but now you know the trick to see if they're done.",
      "Note: I did not test the rolls like this to see if they were done.",
      "They were nicely browned, when I took mine out of the oven (I've made three batches of these rolls now) and they were perfectly cooked after 20 minutes in a 350 F oven in my house.",
