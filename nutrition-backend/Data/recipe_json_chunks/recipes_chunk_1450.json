If the dough shrinks or snaps back as you roll it out, let it rest for several minutes--the gluten will relax, letting it stretch to the desired size."

In a fire ring, stack four large logs in a box shape (use six if you're planning a long cooking time). Add tinder inside the box and arrange kindling in a tipi over it. Light tinder with matches or a lighter in a couple of spots; when it starts smoking, blow gently until flames emerge. It takes 1 to 1 1/2 hours for a campfire to burn down to low flames and embers, the ideal stage for cooking. At that point, spread the fire evenly under the cooking grate, using grilling tongs. Move logs or add more of them as needed."

      "When the oil reaches 375\u00b0, dip each fish or fillet in the seasoned corn flour, coating it all over but shaking off any excess. Carefully lower each piece into the hot oil. Fill the pot but do not crowd it; the oil should bubble up around each piece of fish. Monitor the temperature closely so that it stays between 365\u00b0 and 375\u00b0. Fry the fish until it is golden all over, about 2 to 3 minutes on each side, depending on the size of the pieces. Set aside any of the remaining corn flour.",
      "Remove the fish from the oil in the same order that the pieces were immersed, using a wire-mesh strainer, tongs, or any tool that will allow you to hold the fish over the pot so excess oil can drain. Immediately place the pieces on a wire rack, and place in the oven to keep warm.",
      "Continue frying until all of the fish are done, always waiting for the oil to return to the proper temperature before adding more. Then proceed with frying the hush puppies.",
      "Add the reserved baking powder mixture to the hush puppy batter and mix well. Then add the leftover seasoned corn flour to the batter, a little at a time, until the batter is thick enough to be spooned. This will take about 1/4 to 1/2 cup of the remaining corn flour.",
      "Make sure that the oil has returned to 375\u00b0, and then drop the batter by spoonfuls into the hot oil, using 2 teaspoons: one to scoop up the batter and the other to scrape it off and into the oil. Fry the hush puppies until they are golden brown all over, about 3 minutes, again carefully monitoring the oil, and then place on a wire rack.",
      "You probably won't have to put the hush puppies in the oven to stay warm because your guests will be picking at them. Besides, they stay warm a fairly long time, and there are plenty to go to around. Repeat the process until all the batter is fried. Garnish with lemon wedges and parsley sprigs, if desired. Serve the fish and hush puppies immediately.",

      "Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add the onions and cook, stirring frequently, until soft, about 8 minutes. Add the green pepper, 1/2 teaspoon of the salt, 1/4 teaspoon of the pepper, and the mushrooms. Continue cooking until the mushrooms give up their liquid, about 6 minutes, and are tender. Place the vegetables in a colander, reserving both vegetables and liquid. You should have about 1/2 cup of liquid. Return pan to heat and add the remaining 1 tablespoon of oil. Season the chicken with the remaining 1 teaspoon of salt and 1/4 teaspoon of pepper. Cook the chicken in batches until golden brown and cooked through, about 5 minutes. Add it to the vegetables. Pour the wine, broth, and vegetable liquid into the pan and bring to a boil. With a wooden spoon, loosen any brown bits stuck to the pan and let cook in the sauce. Add the barbecue sauce, Worcestershire, mustard, and hot sauce. Whisk until smooth. Boil until the liquid has reduced by half, to about 11/4 cups. The liquid should thicken slightly. Reduce heat and whisk in the sour cream. Do not let the sauce boil. Return the vegetables and chicken to pan and simmer until heated through. Serve over rice, pasta, or toast."
