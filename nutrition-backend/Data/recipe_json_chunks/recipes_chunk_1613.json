Add a ladleful of hot stock to the rice, stir & turn down to a simmer so the rice doesn't cook too quickly on the outside. Continue adding ladlefuls of stock, stirring frequently, allowing the stock to be absorbed before adding the next. This will take 15-20 minutes. Check to see if the rice is cooked - it should still have some 'bite' to it. Remove from heat. Next, add lemon juice, Arenkha MSC, parsley, and, finally, beat in the butter and season well.

      "I lightly salt and heavily pepper both the mayonnaise on both pieces of bread, and a little salt and pepper on the sliced tomatoes. For the leaf lettuce, I think the secret to the sandwich success is too roll up a handful of the leaves, then slice in a chiffon style. Some lettuce will inevitably fall from the sandwich as you eat it, but the longer chiffon cut lettuce pieces hold together much better.",
      "After loading the tomatoes, I stack the bacon on next. The half-pieces of bacon are perfect sandwich size. I add four to six of the half slices of bacon to each sandwich depending on the size of the sandwich. Finally, I pile on a lot of the chiffon cut lettuce, and the second slice of toasted bread. The mayo also helps hold the lettuce in place.",

I've tried adding avocado, which is tasty, and sometimes I'll add an egg which adds some heft to it, And I've experiment with many other variations and add-ins too. So I'm usually a two sandwich guy, but even if I spruce one up a little, the other BLT will be the classic, nothing fancy, but always perfect. Enjoy!"

      "Chop the beef into large chunks of around three inches. I prefer to buy one large piece of brisket or skirt but you can buy cubes of braising steak at the supermarket.",
      "The first stage is to caramelise, i.e. colour the meat on all sides until it is dark golden brown. Do it in batches in a very hot heavy-bottomed pan with a little oil, then transfer each batch to a colander to drain off any excess fat. You can read my tip on the importance of browning meat first.",
      "While the meat is draining, chop the onion and the white part of the leek. It doesn't have to be perfect, as it will break down during cooking. Add the onion and the leek to the pot and cook it slowly in any fat remaining in the frying pan. I add a pinch of flour at this stage, to thicken the sauce a little. When cooked, but not coloured, strain any excess fat off the onions through a sieve.",
      "Add one half of a bulb of garlic cut horizontally across to the pan. You might be asking why I add so much - and with the skin still on. The reason is I like it rustic and because I want it to infuse and support the meat. You can just pick out the skin at the end. Crushed garlic is too strong. It dominates",
      "Make a bouquet garni to flavour the sauce. Again, it doesn't have to be perfect. Just tie up a quarter stick of celery, a bay leaf, a few sprigs of fresh thyme and some parsley with a bit of string. Some people put carrots in their boeuf bourguignon at this stage but I don't think it's necessary. The more you put in the more you take out. I want to taste the beef. I want to taste the red wine.",
      "Pour the wine and port into the pot, then in goes the bouquet garni and a nice big rasher of bacon. I choose a red wine with a lot of body, e.g. Bordeaux. At this stage, you can also add some port for extra richness if you wish. Bring it to the boil and reduce it to taste (probably by around half). This intensifies the flavour.",
      "Dissolve one Knorr Beef Stock Pot into 500ml of water. Add it to the casserole along with the beef. Bring it to a simmer, then pop it in a low oven, at about 140-150\u00b0C, Gas Mark 1-2. Check that it is bubbling away nicely and not drying out after about two hours.",
      "When the casserole is about 20 minutes off being ready (see point 9), it's time to create the 'bourguignon' garnish of bacon, onions and wild mushrooms. Cut the bacon into thin strips or 'lardons' then fry them gently. There's no need for any oil because the bacon will render and cook in its own fat. In another pan, brown the pearl onions. You can buy fresh, but it's easier to use frozen ones, defrosted and ready to cook. When the bacon is lightly browned, strain it off and add the wild mushrooms to the pan. They only need a minute or two.",
      "After approximately three and three-quarter hours in the oven, the boeuf bourguignon will have reduced by approximately one half. Transfer the beef pieces to plates or a large serving dish and pour the braising liquor over the top. Garnish with the onions, mushrooms and bacon. Be generous with it - give it a sense of occasion. There's your classic boeuf bourguignon."

If you don't have a kitchen scale, just make sure you have 3 packed cups of shredded carrots.",

Rotate & turn the ears occasionally as they cook - 15 minutes. When husks blacken, remove & place the ears of corn directly on the grate & turn often to gently char / brown the corn - 5 to 8 minutes.",

      "4. Add the eggs, nutmeg, a hefty pinch of salt and the flour. (I also added a splash of amaretto liquor) Mix lightly with your hands until it comes together, Add more flour if needed. This is really where the margin for error comes into this recipe. The dough should be dry enough to roll out (see pic), but you cannot overwork it, or it will become dense and chewy. It is good to have a small pot of boiling water on so you can taste a sample. It shouldn't fall apart, and hopefully it's not too dense.",
      "5. Now the fun part, in bunches, work the dough into long rolls (about the diameter of a dime) and cut into little dumplings. Being sure to keep everything well floured, or they will stick together.",
      "Now I dropped my pumpkin gnocchi into boiling water. Fortunately gnocchi come with a built in timer. When you drop them in they all sink to the bottom, give them a very gentle stir, and as they cook they will rise to the top. Once they're all sitting on the top, they're ready to go. It happens pretty quickly relative to pasta, so don't drop them until your sauce is ready!"
