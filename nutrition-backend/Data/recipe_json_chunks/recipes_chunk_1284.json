Put a tiny bit of cooking spray into a frying pan and saute the onions until they become translucent. Add the pepperoni and saute for another 5 minutes. Add the mushrooms and saute until the mushrooms have reduced in size by 1/2. Turn off the heat and stir in the sour cream. Take the cooled halves of the squash and a tablespoon. Spoon out the squash meat into the frying pan being careful not to tear the skin of the squash. I usually leave about 1/8 inch of squash meat still in the skin just to make sure it will hold together. Once all of the squash meat is in the frying pan, set the empty squash skins back in the lasagna pan with the open side facing upward waiting to be filled.

When the pie crust bakes, the butter melts into the dough and two things happen: 1) The fat from the butter tenderizes the dough, making it tender, and 2) the water in the butter evaporates, creating a little air pocket in the dough, making it flaky. You need that puff of air from escaping steam to create flaky layers, and this is why all butter recipes are the best for other super flaky recipes, such as puff pastry and croissants.",
      "",
      "When you cut in the butter, whether you're working by hand or pulsing your dough in a food processor, you want your dough to be sandy and have pieces of butter about the size of a large pea still in it. Larger pieces of fat in the crust will result in a flakier texture. For this reason, it is good to stir in the water in the recipe by hand, rather than adding it into a food processor where it could become overmixed. Don't use too much water or the dough will become tough, so add it in gradually.",
      "",

Turn off heat; let sit, covered, until ready to serve. Heat a grill pan or skillet over high heat; coat with cooking spray. Cook chicken, turning once, for 4 minutes. Reduce heat to medium. Cook, turning once, until a meat thermometer reads 165 degrees, 10 to 12 minutes. Remove chicken; let rest two minutes. Slice each breast on the diagonal into 1/2-inch pieces. Heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook sugar peas and peppers until crisp-tender, about 3 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Turn off heat.

      "1. Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F. Grease three 1-pound loaf pans (8.5-by-4.25-by-2.75 inches) with olive oil or spray with cooking spray (or bake in batches).",
      "",
      "2. In a large mixing bowl, lightly beat the eggs. Add the olive oil, water, pumpkin puree, and sugar and whisk with a fork to combine thoroughly.",
      "",
      "3. Sift some flour into a small bowl. Measure out 3 1/3 cups of sifted flour by spooning the flour into a measuring cup and leveling off the top with a knife. Then sift the measured flour again together with the salt, nutmeg, cinnamon, cloves, and baking soda into the mixing bowl. Stir into the wet ingredients until just combined. Stir in raisins, cranberries, or nuts, if using.",
      "",
      "4. Pour into prepared loaf pans, nudging batter into corners. Bake for 45 minutes to an hour, or until a cake tester inserted into the center comes out clean. Cool on a rack for 10 minutes before removing from pan to cool completely. The bread will keep at room temperature for more than a week if tightly wrapped in plastic. It also freezes beautifully.",

    "ingredients": [],

      "Remove both pie crust rolls from refrigerator and let soften on counter (about 15 minutes). Pour bag of frozen blueberries in a strainer and rinse with water to defrost. Set aside. Once dough is softened, working in two batches, unroll and smooth together any cracks with your hands over the top of the plastic film of the dough. Remove plastic film and place dough onto a floured surface. Cut out 7 circles from one roll and 7 circles from the other (it could be more or less depending on the size of your cookie cutter, just make sure you end up with an even number). Place all dough circles onto two baking trays lined with parchment paper and place back in refrigerator to chill. In a medium bowl, combine strained blueberries, lemon zest, lemon curd and flour. Stir and set aside. Prepare egg wash by whisking egg with water in a small bowl. Set aside. Remove dough from refrigerator and place a spoonful of the lemon-blueberry mix onto 7 of the dough circles, making sure not to overfill or touch the edges of the dough. Brush egg wash around the perimeter of each filled dough circle. Place the remaining 7 dough circles on top of the mounds, then crimp the edges of the dough with a fork to seal each pie. Place prepared pies back in refrigerator to chill another 10 minutes before baking. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 375 degrees. Once oven is heated, remove tray of pies from refrigerator and brush tops generously with egg wash. With a sharp knife, cut a slit or a small design on the top of each pie to help steam release while baking. Optional: for added texture, sprinkle turbinado sugar over the top of each pie. Bake pies in center rack for 20-25 minutes, or until the blueberry juices start bubbling and the pastry is golden brown. For even baking, rotate sheet halfway though. Transfer to a cooling rack and serve warm."

Drain all but a couple of tablespoons of the bacon grease. Add olive oil and cherry tomatoes and cook another 5 minutes. Add shallots, garlic and peppers. Cook 2 more minutes. Add white wine and begin adding kale working one bunch at a time. As the liquid from the leaves begins to steam off, the leaves will wilt quickly. Once reduced to half, add the next bunch and keep turning with tongs. In just a few minutes the leaves will completely wilt. Add the bacon. Add the lemon juice and sugar.
