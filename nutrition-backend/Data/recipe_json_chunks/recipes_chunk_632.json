Pour mixture evenly on stuffing mix. Let it set and soak in a while if you have time. If you don't, it will work anyway. Take chicken legs, chicken breasts, boneless pork chops or steak, venison chops or try one of your own. Lay them on the mixture in the baking pan and coat them with barbecue sauce. Use as many as will fit or as few as you want. Use as little or as much barbecue sauce as you want. Put in a 350\u00b0 preheated oven and bake for 50 to 75 minutes. If you are in a hurry, increase temperature and cut time. If you have lots of time, cut temperature to 300\u00b0 to 325\u00b0 and bake for 2 hours. When baked to your liking, take out and enjoy."
