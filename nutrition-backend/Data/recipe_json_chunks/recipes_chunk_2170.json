      "Prepare sachet depice Place the aromatics on a large piece of cheesecloth, gather the edges to enclose, and tie with kitchen twine.",
      "Blanch favas Prepare an ice-water bath in a large bowl for shocking the beans (which stops the cooking and preserves their color).",
      "Drop the fava beans into a large pot of boiling salted water until bright green and just tender, about 2 minutes.",
      "Lift out the peas with a slotted spoon (or a spider) and plunge into the ice-water bath.",
      "Once they are thoroughly cool, drain and peel off the tough outer skins.",
      "Cook veal and artichokes Pour the wine into a large saucepan and bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for 1 minute (to cook off some of the alcohol).",
      "Add veal, water, and 1 teaspoon salt.",
      "Bring to a boil and skim the foam from the surface with a slotted spoon (veal produces more surface foam than other meats, so this step is important).",
      "Add herb sachet and reduce heat to a low simmer.",
      "Cook, uncovered, 1 hour, skimming the surface frequently.",
      "Add artichokes to the pot, submerging them partially in the liquid.",
      "Cook until the artichokes and veal are tender when pierced with the tip of a sharp knife, 20 to 30 minutes more, adding peas during last 3 minutes of cooking.",
      "Remove the sachet and squeeze out the liquid into the pot.",
      "Then strain the contents of the pot through a fine sieve into a bowl or large measuring cup, reserving veal, artichokes, and peas.",
      "You should have about 3 cups liquid.",
      "Thicken sauce Wipe out the pot and return it to the stove.",
      "First, make a roux by melting the butter over medium heat until foamy, swirling the pan to melt evenly, then whisk in the flour and cook, whisking constantly, 1 minute.",
      "Next, make a veloute by whisking the reserved liquid into the roux and bringing to a boil (again, always whisking), cooking until the mixture is smooth.",
      "(Classic culinary teaching would have you whisk cold stock into a hot roux, or vice versa, to prevent the sauce from forming lumps, but that isnt necessary as long as you whisk diligently.)",
      "Reduce heat and simmer 10 minutes.",
      "Make liaison (optional) Whisk together the egg yolk, if using, and heavy cream, then temper by gradually whisking in a cup of the veloute (this will allow the egg to gently heat so it doesnt curdle).",
      "Now whisk everything back into the pot and cook over gentle heat until the sauce thickens enough to coat the back of the spoon, 1 to 2 minutes.",
      "(If you prefer, omit the egg and whisk the cream directly into the veloute in the pan.)",
      "Serve Return the veal, artichokes, and peas to the pot along with the peeled favas and cook gently to heat through, stirring.",
      "Season with salt and pepper.",
      "Add lemon juice and chopped dill or parsley to taste.",
      "This stew is best made in spring when all the ingredients are in season, but in a pinch, substitute frozen peas, fava beans, and even artichoke hearts, adding all at the end, just to heat through.",
      "Omit fava beans, peas, and artichokes.",
      "Once the veal has cooked for 1 hour and 20 minutes, melt 2 tablespoons unsalted butter in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat.",
      "Add 8 ounces small white button mushrooms and 6 ounces blanched and peeled pearl onions (page 31), tossing to combine.",
      "Pour in 1/4 cup stock from the stew and cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are cooked through and the stock has reduced to a syrupy glaze, about 9 minutes.",
      "Finish with the liaison, then return veal to the pot along with the vegetables."

      "I added grated Parmesan cheese along with the black pepper at the end.",
      "This is also very tasty.",
      "Adjust how soupy the risotto is around Step 18, by adjusting when you add the soup and how much you reduce the soup after each addition.",
      "If you continue cooking with the rice submerged, it'll become soupy.",
      "If you reduce the soup more as you cook, it won't become soupy.",
      "Please adjust to your liking.",

      "You will not necessarily use up the soup from Step 7.",
      "It will depend on the heat that you cook in, your desired texture, and how soupy you want your risotto to be.",
      "On the other hand, if you run out of soup before the rice has cooked sufficiently, you probably used too high a heat for cooking the soup and the risotto."

      "The proportion of salt should be great sufficient to trigger osmosis and begin to draw the moisture from the surface of the meat, and (some may disagree with this) the proportion of sugar shouldn't be excessive because it will caramelize and burn during smoking and leave a bitter taste.",
      "However, since sugar contributes to osmosis, it is an important component and should not be eliminated.",
      "Your rub should only be limited by your imagination.",
      "The other ingredients to consider can include paprika, cumin, garlic pwdr, onion pwdr, black pepper, cayenne pepper, chile pwdr, oregano, sage, or possibly anything which you enjoy.",
      "Keeping your rub in a shaker makes it easier to apply.",
      "Rub should be applied at least the night before smoking.",
      "For better flavor let the meat absorb rub for up to three days.",
      "Shake the rub over the entire surface of the meat to be smoked.",
      "Use a generous amount at first and then, as it starts to get moist and adhere, add in more.",

      "I find which it only results in uneven distribution, and it stains your hands.",

      "Rubs are better than marinades for large pcs of meat such as briskets and pork butts.",

      "I believe which the texture of the meat is improved by drawing out excess moisture, before cooking, through osmosis.",
