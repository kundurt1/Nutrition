    "ingredients": [],

      "Notes: 1. Can substitute dark brown sugar in place of white sugar and molasses (I find my way cheaper and less messy). 2. Can substitute canola oil for soybean (I read it's healthier, but I'm in what seems to be a minority of people who can taste canola oil and really don't like it). 3. Can substitute dark brown sugar in place of Splenda (I use some Splenda just to cut down on a few calories). 4. I use Nestle cocoa instead of Hershey's because it's cheaper, and I can't taste any difference. 5. Dutch cocoa will not react with baking soda. Plus, I don't like the idea of treating cocoa with some alkali, which causes some losses of the chemical compounds that are retained in unprocessed cocoa, including some of the natural antioxidants in the chocolate. 6. Can substitute unsalted butter for salted butter, but then need to increase Kosher salt to 1/2 teaspoon. 7. You can freeze the egg white in an ice cube tray then bag it for future use. 8. Of course, you can substitute, add or subtract anything else you want, but then it would be a different cookie recipe.",
      "General method: This recipe uses only a blender, one bowl, and one fork. I've tried other methods, but this gives the best result along with the added benefit of being very simple and quick. Of course, if you don't have a blender, just use whatever substitute will give you the equivalent result of a blender.",
      "Put all the wet ingredients (items 1 - 8) in the blender in any order. Start the blender at a low speed until the ingredients are flowing smoothly (takes maybe 30 to 60 seconds in my blender). Then quickly move the blender speed up to its highest setting and blend on highest for about 30 seconds. The mixture's consistency should be medium light and airy. Not too thick, and not like meringue.",
      "Put all the dry ingredients (items 9 - 12) in a large bowl (I like using a 2-1/2-quart glass measuring cup because of its size and shape for the ingredients in this recipe). Mix them thoroughly (I use a plain fork to do this). Create a well in the center for the wet mixture.",
      "Pour and spatula all the wet mixture from the blender.into the dry mixture well in the bowl. Add the chopped pecans to the bowl. Mix together with a fork, spoon or hands, just until thoroughly combined (I prefer a plain fork). Do not overmix. The cookie dough consistency should be firm, slightly oily, and should not stick to the sides of the bowl. The color should be dark black, and may glisten some.",
      "Set oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit. You should use the center rack.",
      "Let the cookie dough sit in the bowl at room temperature for about ten minutes to let the bread flour and cocoa thoroughly integrate with the wet mixture. The bowl can be covered to keep out unwanted stuff, but it is not necessary otherwise.",
      "After sitting for about ten minutes, .mix a little more. You are now ready to pan and bake.",
      "I recommend you now try a single test cookie. (If you want to just bake the whole batch now, then skip this instruction and continue to the next one.) The batch of dough makes twelve 3 1/2 inch cookies. So, using your fork or other scooper, get an amount equal to about 1/12 the total batch (this should be about the size of a golf ball or slightly bigger). It is not necessary to grease the baking sheet. Put the dollop of cookie dough in the center of the sheet, and mash it till it is fairly flat on top, and about 3 inches across. If the cookie dough sticks a lot to the baking sheet, and leaves residue that is not easily scraped off, you may need a little more oil. Bake the single cookie for 8 -10 minutes (I would try 9). It should rise somewhat while baking, but will fall flat after taking it out of the oven. Let it cool a bit on the sheet, then try it. If it's too dry and sticks a lot to the baking sheet, you can add 1 TBL of soybean oil to the cookie dough and mix it in by hand as best you can. If it's too dry, but does NOT stick a lot to the baking sheet, then try baking less time (try 2 minutes less). When you are happy with the cookie, bake the whole batch following the next instruction.",
      "The batch of dough makes twelve 3 1/2 inch cookies. The baking sheet should be on the center rack of the oven, so you may have to bake two batches of six cookies (like I do), or you can use two baking sheets on two racks, and swap the sheets half way through baking. It is not necessary to grease the baking sheet. The size of each cookie on the baking sheet should equal about 1/12 the total batch (this should be about the size of a golf ball or slightly bigger). Using your fork or other scooper, put the dollops of cookie dough on the sheet, and mash them till they are fairly flat on top, and about 3 inches across. Bake the cookies for 10 -12 minutes (12 works for me). They should rise somewhat while baking, but will fall flat after taking them out of the oven. Let them cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before taking them off (I use a wooden spatula).",
      "Baking is very unforgiving, and these cookies are no exception. There are two main reasons I've found that will give you a bad batch. The cookie dough is either too dry or too oily. Or, the baking time was either too short or too long. In insrtuction 9 above, I discuss too dry. If they are too oily, use less oil in the next batch, or add more milk and/or bread flour. If the dough seems oily enough, but bakes too dry, then reduce the baking time (try 2 minutes less)."

The longer left to soak, the stronger the flavour.",

Alternatively, the whole stalk may be bruised and added during cooking, but then it should be removed before serving. Dried lemon grass is a good substitute:--Soak in hot water for about 2 hours before using then remove from the dish before serving. 1 Tablespoon dried lemon grass is roughly equivalent to 1 stalk fresh. Powdered lemon grass is also available.",

Set the 1/4 cup of spinach water aside and then puree what's left in the pot together with the steamed spinach. I like to just use an immersion blender right there in the pot -- or you could move to a blender or something similar. Set the spinach aside (I move mine to a bowl and clean out the same pot).",

      "In a glass or plastic bowl (never use metal) add the dried starter flakes, 1/2 cup of lukewarm (bottled) water and 1/2 cup of flour.",
      "Note: If you wish a stronger flavor add one or two tablespoons of rye flour to the first feeding.",
      "Using a plastic or wooden spoon (never metal) stir mixture vigoursly to add air.",
      "Cover loosely and place in a warm draft-free area (I leave it on my counter top).",
      "Allow the starter to proof for 8-14 hours (mixture should become very bubbly (don't worry if you see no activity, just continue with second feeding).",
      "Second Feeding.",
      "To the mixture add 1 1/2 cups lukewarm water and 1 1/2 cups flour, stir vigoursly.",
      "Cover loosely and place in a warm, draft-free area and allow to proof for 8-14 hours, until bubbly.",
      "Note: At this point I suggest making some flakes as a back up -- see Preserving Starter below.",
      "You should now have approximately 2 cups of active starter that is ready to use. Always save 1/4 cup of starter for future use, so if your recipe calls for more than 1 1/2 cups of starter then it will be necessary to add equal parts of water and flour and proof for another 8-14 hours.",
      "Maintaining the Starter:",
      "After removing the quantity needed for the recipe, save approximately 1/4 cup of starter and discard (or make flakes) any additional starter. Place the saved starter in a glass jar or plastic storage container. Do not use an air tight container as the gases need room to escape. I use a glass jar with a small hole punched in the top (Since I do not want the starter to touch metal, I place a small piece of plastic wrap over the top before screwing on the metal cap). Next, stir in one-half cup each of flour and water, let sit on the counter for 30 to 45 minutes, then close the container and place in the refrigerator. This will preserve your starter until the next time you need it. The starter can be stored in the refrigerator for up to two weeks. If you must go longer than this, remove the container every two weeks or so and dump all but 1/4 cup down the drain. Feed again, as above, to reactivate starter.",
      "Preserving your Starter.",
      "It is a good idea to preserve some of your starter in case something goes wrong. If your starter dies, you will have to purchase or get some more from somebody and start over. I have learned a method that can be used to preserve the starter for a long time without constantly adding flour or water. This method also makes it easier to share your starter with your friends.",
      "During the normal course of preparing your starter for bread baking and when it is active and bubbly, pour a small puddle of the starter onto some wax paper and spread it out with the back of a spoon so that the starter forms a very thin layer on the wax paper. Let it completely dry out overnight. The next day, bend the wax paper and the starter will break apart like potato chips. Place the starter chips in a plastic zip lock bag sealed tightly and then into the refrigerator. It is also a good idea to write the date and type of starter on the outside of the bag.",
      "Starter can be kept this way for up to six months with no ill effects, though I have heard you can probably go up to year. To reactivate it, place the starter chips in equal amounts of flour and water and put it in a warm place for 12 hours. I make these starter chips every three months or so to ensure I have a fresh backup for all my sourdough starters."

Like other white rind cheeses, this is delicious deep-fried in beer batter and served with tangy Cumberland Sauce, which should be prepared a day in advance to let the flavors meld.",
      "To make the Cumberland sauce: With a vegetable peeler, peel strips of zest from the orange and lemon. With a sharp knife, shred the zest as thinly as possible. Put the zest into a small saucepan and cover with cold water. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to simmer and cook for 5 minutes, or until the zest starts to soften. Drain and set aside.",

Cook for 5 minutes, then reduce heat to simmer and cook for 10 minutes, or until the mixture is reduced by half. Transfer the sauce to a small bowl and stir in the reserved zest. Refrigerate for at least 24 hours and up to 3 weeks. Makes about 1 1/2 cups.",
      "To make the fried cheese: In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, beer, salt, and oil. There should be a few small lumps. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let stand in a warm place for about 3 hours. Stir in the egg yolk. In a small bowl, beat the egg white with an electric mixer until stiff peaks form. Fold into the beer batter.",

Drop into the hot oil, and cook, turning as necessary with a wooden spoon, for 1 to 2 minutes, or until golden brown. With a slotted spoon, remove each piece as soon as it's browned and drain on paper towels.",

      "Elora's Notes: Because original recipe calls for regular milk, might need to add 1 or 2 tablespoons milk. O.k. if batter is quite thick. We do NOT add extra milk, and it turns out PERFECT. Emmett used this recipe to make an upside down Peach cake in a 10-inch iron skillet with it and it was LUSCIOUS! But it ran ALL OVER the oven and we had AT LEAST 1/4 cup batter left in the bowl! So, we aren't sure HOW MUCH it makes. But I figure AT LEAST three 9-in. pans, or a 10 X 14 inches sheet pan, or more than likely three 9-in. pans PLUS one 8-in. pan. I figure you make the three 9-in. layers & the one 8-in. layer. Though it MIGHT NOT be more than enough for three 9-inch pans. If it is, cut the 8-in. layer in half & freeze for unexpected company or when you want a cake & don't want to take time to make one. Can frost it either before freezing or after thawing."
