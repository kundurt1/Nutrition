It is important not to overdo the temperature, otherwise the sugar will burn. Once the sugar is completely liquid, the apple and pear cubes are added. Important: Do not stir immediately, otherwise you will have the whole caramel on the spoon! The apples and pears lose liquid, which combines with the caramel. Only after 2-3 minutes should you stir the pieces of fruit. Now add the apricots and sultanas and stir well.",
      "2. When the fruits are caramelized, add the cereal, milk and cream. The temperature can now be increased and the milk-cream mixture is boiled briefly. The oatmeal now gradually absorbs the liquid. On low heat, the muesli is occasionally stirred until the milk-cream mixture is almost completely reduced, or is absorbed by the cereal.",
      "3. The cereal is then garnished with an apple and pear slices, drizzled with a little honey and served warm. Of course you do not have to cook hot cereals on the grill. This also works in a pan on the stove."

KEEP A CLOSE EYE ON THE HAM IN THE BROIL MODE OR YOU CAN EASILY BURN IT UP!",
      "When the ham looks good, remove it from the broiler, allow it to sit for at least 20 minutes uncovered so that the juices will re-disperse within the meat, remove all toothpicks, and then slice it for serving.",
      "Note: Use the juices/drippings from the ham to make great-tasting Red-eye Gravy. Just pour all the drippings into a skillet and whisk in about 2 tablespoons of Wondra flour, (or cornstarch for clearer gravy), whisking constantly, over medium heat, until it thickens. If you don't have enough drippings, or if your gravy gets too thick, just add a little canned chicken broth."

Transfer to oven and bake until filling is just set in center, about 45 minutes. If edges start to pull away from sides of pan sooner than that, remove it from oven. Immediately remove pan from water and remove foil. Place on wire rack and cool to room temperature.",

Turn out onto a lightly floured surface and knead for a few minutes, adding flour as necessary, until the dough is smooth; do not overwork. Shape into a ball. Place in a lightly oiled bowl, cover tightly with plastic wrap, and allow the dough to rise in a draft-free spot until doubled, about 1 hour.",

Shape each piece into a ball and cover the dough loosely with plastic wrap. Let sit for 5 minutes. Then roll out into thin rounds, as directed in the recipe or use to line oiled pans. If not using right away, freeze the dough to prevent it from rising and becoming too bready. The dough can be transferred directly from the freezer to the oven."
