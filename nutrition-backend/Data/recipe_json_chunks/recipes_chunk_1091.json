Therefore, the first step is to go to the dollar store and buy 8-10 pint-sized freezer containers. Heck, spend a lot more money and buy Tupperware if you want. Or if you are particularly ambitious, pack the finished product into canning jars and seal them. I prefer to just freeze it in pint containers until ready for use.",

Then transfer the sprigs to your food processor. If you don't have one, get out your biggest, sharpest knife and start chopping. The parsley needs to be VERY finely chopped. If not, you will find it all over the floor after Fido's feeding time. Babies don't like the texture of whole parsley and will spit it out. It is, however, good for their breath and digestion and it's very low-cal.",

      "Sauce -- In a medium size sauce pan, add the butter, garlic, shallots and cook 2 minutes on medium heat. Then add in the flour and whisk well until combined and cook another minute to get rid of the flour taste. Add in the cream and season with salt and pepper. Add in the shrimp, scallops or lobster, etc (any un-cooked seafood) and cook 2-3 minutes until done. Slowly add in the cream and cumin and bring to a medium heat. The sauce will begin to thicken. Add in the crab meat and lightly stir and reduce to low heat and just let it simmer. The sauce is done. Make sure to check for seasoning - salt and pepper if necessary. Next, the chips and cheese just take a few minutes.",
      "Base -- As the sauce is cooking, spread 1/2 of the chips in the pan, dish or in the foil pouches and top with 1/2 of the monterey jack, pepper jack and cheddar cheeses. Bake 2-4 minutes until melted. Remove from the oven and top with 1/2 of the seafood sauce and add another layer of chips and the remainder of cheese and sauce, top with the parmesan and bake another 3-4 minutes.",
      "Serve -- If I serve them in individual pouches I let each person garnish their own dish. But I do put a big spoon of the mango salsa and lime slice right on top of the melted cheese. If family style, I like to serve them over a big plate of shredded lettuce and then top with the mango salsa, sour cream, olives and a lime slice which happen to be my favorites. Just don't forget the mango salsa and feel free to use any toppings you like.",
      "As I said, serve them as appetizers or as a main dish. Try some sliders on the side for a fun movie or game night with friends. A few beers or wine and dessert and you have a fun unique dinner. And it is really quick to make believe it or not. ENJOY!"

Remove from fridge and add very cold butter and shortening. Mix the lemon juice, egg, and water in a small bowl and slowly add to dry ingredients, mixing by hand, until the dough begins to form a ball. Divide ball in half, flatten to make 2 disks and wrap each in plastic wrap. Refrigerate at least 30 minutes. You can freeze up to 2 months by placing the wrapped discs in a freezer bag. Just be sure and thaw in the refrigerator before using.",
      "PREP 1 (ROLLING PIN): Take one disk and roll it out larger than your pan onto a lightly floured work surface. Transfer the dough to a pie pan by carefully rolling the pastry around a rolling pin, then gently unrolling it over the pan. If it breaks apart, don't worry. Simply patch any cracks or tears with some dough and press down to seal. It will not show for the bottom crust.",
      "PREP 2 (PARCHMENT): Lightly flour a disk and place between 2 sheets of parchment paper. Roll out the dough from the center to the edges, to make a circular shape larger than your pan. Remove the top sheet of parchment paper and place the pie pan in the center of the dough. Slide your hand under the parchment holding the dough centering your hand to the middle of the pan and flip over. Press the dough into the pan and carefully peel away the parchment.",
      "BOTTOM ONLY PIE: If pre-baking a bottom crust, brush it with the eggwash and using the tines of a fork, prick the bottom and sides in a few places so that the crust will not bubble up. If not pre-baking, Do Not prick the crust! Just brush the edges with the eggwash and fill with the filling of your choice.",
      "TOP CRUST PIE: If making a top crust, brush the edges of the bottom crust with the eggwash. If you have a pie bird, place in the center and then add the filling. Use the same method for rolling out the top crust using either prep 1 or prep 2 method (for prep 2 method, slowly flip the dough with parchment over the filling, then gently pull away the parchment paper). Using the backside tines of a fork, gently press the edges together to seal (or you can pinch the edges for a scalloped look).",
      "Trim excess dough from around the edge and gather up the scraps. Roll it out and cut fruit, leaf, or other designs for the top of the pie. You can use cookie cutters or try out your freehand talent. NOTE: if you have a pie bird, then once you roll out your top dough, place a small 'x' in the center so it will fall over the bird. If your 'x' is too large, simply use the scraps of dough to make a 'skirt' over the bird (see photo).",
      "If you do not have a pie bird, use a sharp knife tip or kitchen sheers, carefully cut or snip a 1/2\" hole in the center of the crust to allow steam to escape. Using the tines of a fork, poke holes around the center hole to resemble a sun and sun ray pattern (you can do it so it will show where to cut the slices). Arrange the dough cut-outs on top (but not over the vent holes). Gently brush the pie crust and decorations with the eggwash."

      "Start beating the egg whites at a moderate speed until foamy, beat in the lemon juice and salt and gradually increase speed to fast, you really need an electric beater for this. When the egg white form soft peak, very gradually add the sugar in small amounts, then beat at high for a few minutes til you get stiff peaks. Beat in the vanilla. Scoop the mixture into the prepared dish or dishes, you want them about filled, just use a second dish if you have too much. I sometimes use a prepared bread pan for the excess and slide it onto the same oven rack as the souffle dish.",
      "Bake immediately in the preheated oven 35-40 minutes. It will rise and turn golden. A bit too much time is better than too little. Remove and cool at room temperature, it will sink a bit. When cool, cover and refrigerate. May be made up to a couple days in advance and even frozen.",
      "Cut into 6 wedges and serve on a pool of cool creme anglaise, which is actually a bit difficult to make at home. If you have any hesitation, buy it pre-made. If you are feeling adventurous, use your leftover egg yolks and any creme anglaise recipe from the web and follow the directions EXACTLY-- it must NEVER boil."
