Cover and set aside for 15 minutes or so. Turn tuna with tongs and let set for another 15 minutes. When grill is ready, place marinated tuna steaks on grill to sear side one. Pour part of the marinade on tuna. Cook on this side approximately 2 or 3 minutes with grill covered. Turn tuna over using flat spatula by quickly shoving under tuna while pressing down on grilling surface. This will help keep tuna intact. Reduce heat to low, pour on the rest of marinade and close lid. Tuna will continue to sear on higher heat and cook while temp. goes down. Turn once more after 4 or 5 minutes. Check tuna often during this stage. Remove from grill and let set for 5 minutes or so. Slice in half and serve."
