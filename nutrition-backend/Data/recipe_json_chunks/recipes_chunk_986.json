Roll out your dough into a rope and tear of fist sized portion. Roll the dough into a ball and then press it together between to parchment sheet. Roll it into a thin flat disc, about 7 inches in diameter. Scoop two tablespoons of filling into the middle of the disc and then seal into a half moon shape. Place the asparagus with the bottom in the middle of the dumpling and fold the two corners over it and seal the edges with water if necessary. Repeat until you have 6 for two people. I made extra dumplings with the leftover filling for later and just folded them into half moons without the asparagus. Bring the steamer water to a boil and place the dumpling in the tray. Alternate the trays after about 5 minutes of cooking. Remove the dumpling with tongs and if the rice isn't ready put them in a warmed oven until you are ready. For plating I put the steamed red cabbage leaves and some basil leaves on the bottom of the bowl, I molded the rice into a smaller bowl and inverted it in the center of the dish. I topped arranged the dumplings on top, and sprinkled some sesame seeds and a mix of soy sauce, lime, and siracha. Enjoy!"

Once the pressing process is done, put your right hand on the cookie and secure it while having your left hand slowly twist the cookie cutter (right handed people may do it vice versa).

Remove the pieces using a metal slotted spoon (or a spider) to a paper towel lined plate, let oil temp return and begin another batch.",

      "Stir in additional flour, 1/4 cup at a time, to make a soft but not sticky dough (it will stiffen when chilled.) Knead by hand or under a dough hook for 5 minutes to form a solid mass.",
      "If using a food processor, attach the steel blade. Place 2 cups flour in the work bowl and add the dry ingredients. Pulse to mix. Pour the 1/4 cup water, milk, and half-and-half through the feed tube. Pulse once or twice to be certain that all dry ingredients are moistened. Add the balance of the flour, 1/2 cup at a time, turning the machine on briefly after each addition. When the mixture forms a mass and begins to clean the sides of the bowl, knead for 30 seconds. Don't overknead!",
      "This begins the process of cooling the dough and at the same time allowing it to rise. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour.",
      "Determine that both butter and dough are about the same temperature - 65\u00b0F (23\u00b0C) is ideal. The block of butter should bend but not break (too cold) nor be oily (too warm) when bent slightly. This may mean taking the butter out of the refrigerator an hour or so early to reach workable temperature. Likewise for the dough. Place the dough on a floured work surface and with the hands press it into a 10\" square. Unwrap the block of butter and lay the block diagonally on the dough. Bring each point of dough into the center, overlapping the edges at least 1\". Press the dough into a neat package. With a heavy rolling pin, roll the dough into a rectangle, approximately 8\" x 18\". This dimension is not critical.",
      "Caution: If the butter seems to be breaking into small pieces under the dough rather than remaining solid, allow the dough/butter to warm a few minutes. But if the butter softens, becomes sticky, and oozes while making the turns, put the dough back into the refrigerator for several minutes.",
      "Fold the length of dough into thirds, as for a letter. Turn so that the open ends are at twelve and six o'clock. Roll again into a rectangle. This time, fold both ends into the middle and then close, as one would a book. The dough will now be in 4 layers. Wrap the package of dough in a cloth (an old tea towel is good) that has been soaked in cold water and wrung dry. Place the wrapped dough in the refrigerator to relax and chill for 1 or 2 hours.",
      "Remove the dough from the refrigerator and place on the floured work surface. Unwrap, roll out, and fold in thirds, as for a letter. This is the final turn before it is rolled out and cut into croissants. Dampen cloth again and wrap loosely around the dough. Place the package in a plastic bag so moisture will be retained (not pulled out of the cloth). Leave in the refrigerator 4 to 6 hours or overnight.",
      "Mix together the egg and 1 Tbsp of water. Have ready the egg wash, a knife or pastry cutter, and a wooden yardstick if you wish the pieces to be cut precisely otherwise, plan to cut them freehand. You may have or can borrow a French croissant cutter that cuts the dough into triangles.",
      "Sprinkle work surface with flour. Roll the dough until it is a generous 10\"-x-38\" rectangle, and, most importantly, about 1/4\" thick. This is a crucial dimension, since it determines the size and texture of the croissants. Trim irregularities to make the strip uniform in width. Cut the strip lengthwise to make two 5\" pieces. Mark the strip into triangles, 5\" wide on the bottom. Using a yardstick as a guide, cut through the dough with a pastry or pizza cutter or knife. Separate the triangles, place them on a baking sheet, and chill for 15 to 20 minutes. Roll the dough into the traditional croissant shape, by rolling the triangle from the bottom to the point.",
      "Place the croissants on a baking sheet and allow to rise for 1 to 2 hours, in which they will double in volume.",
      "Preheat the oven to 425\u00b0F (220\u00b0C). Bake the croissants for 22 to 25 minutes. Allow them to cool on a rack before serving.",
      "Yield: 24 to 30 croissants."

      "After they are good and dry (and it may not take your dehydrator as long or it could take it longer) you have to use your own judgment. You then take them out and place in pans. Place pans in oven and heat for 30 minutes on about 150-200 degrees. Watch them after 20 minutes and make sure they are not burning. Let the beans cool after having in oven.",
      "You will have to use more than one dehydrator to fit the beans in or you can refrigerate the ones that won't fit and add them to the it after the first bunch is dry. I usually have 3 dehydrators going when I am drying a bushel.",
      "Place beans in quart or gallon jugs, add the black pepper, and do be free with the black pepper, it will keep bugs from getting into your beans while they are in storage. My mother always made a note to tell people that the pepper was not bugs, but rather it was pepper. You can also put in a plastic container and store in freezer. I do not I put them in my cabinets.",
      "Now you have dried beans.",
      "Another way to make them is to break and string, then lay out on a screen in a hot attic, but you must check on them regularly because they will mold if you are not careful. This will take about a week to do this way maybe longer, but rest of the directions are the same, put in oven, heat, and then cool and place in jars with the pepper.",
      "A very old fashion way, and I admit when I was a little girl we did them this way. You just string the bean and then take a needle and thread and put the whole bean on it and make as long as you want. Hang them on the porch for several days, until dry. When ready to use you must cut the beans. I think this is the hardest way and the most likely way for the beans to mold.",
      "I have seen people string and break and lay in the back window of the car, I think this would be messy and I sure don't want to drive around town with beans in my back window.",

      "As the mixer turns on low sprinkle in cold water a tablespoon at a time. Try to sprinkle it evenly over the flour and butter. Continue mixing the dough as you slowly add water. The secret is to add just enough water until it just pulls together as a shaggy mass. If you add too much water it will cause the pastry to shrink into the pie pan and it won't look very pretty.",

Lightly flour your work surface and tap one of the dough balls down with four or five taps of the rolling pan. Begin rolling from the center of your dough outward. Stop the pressure 1/4 inch from the edge of the dough. Lift the dough and turn by a quarter and repeat the rolling until the dough is at least 12 inches in diameter. Be sure to re-flour the work surface if your dough is sticking.",
      "Using a pot lid or a circle of cardboard as a template, trim the dough to form a 12-inch round (this should give you a 11/2-inch margin all around your 9-inch pie pan).
