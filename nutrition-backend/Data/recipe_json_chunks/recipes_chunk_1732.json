      "Skim the fat or residue from the pork now and then, as it collects on the surface.",
      "Meanwhile, prepare the soffritto.",

      "When the beans are tender, pour the tomato mixture into them, dipping the skillet into the soup pot to slosh out every bit, and keep the minestra boiling.",
      "Cook the minestra for another hour or more, 2 1/2 to 3 hours total, until the volume has reduced to about 4 quarts (about midway up an 8-quart pot, when you take out any bones and meat).",
      "If theres too much broth, raise the heat and cook uncovered, but stir frequently to prevent burning.",
      "Taste the soup when reduced, and correct seasoning.",
      "Take some of the base for a finished soup now if you want, or let the whole pot cool.",
      "Before using or storing, lift out the pork bones, pick off all the meat, shred it, and stir into the base; pick out the bay leaves and discard.",
      "Keep the soup refrigerated for 3 or 4 days, or freeze, in filled and tightly sealed containers, for 4 to 6 months",
      "I will often add extra pork pieces to the big minestra pot for an hour of so of cooking, then serve the meat as a separate course.",
      "If your pot is big enough, you should be able to drop in a pound or more of meat, either bony spare ribs or hocks, or meatier cuts, such as pork butt or country-style ribs, in addition to the ones already cooking with the soup.",
      "Italian sausages and kielbasa are also great cooked this way.",
      "Wash meat well with hot water before, or you might give it a quick boil before adding to the pot.",
      "You can cook such main-course meat anytime the minestra is perking away, though it will take on the best flavor after youve added the tomato-onion soffritto and salt.",
      "Remove the meat when tender, keep warm until ready, slice, and serve on a plattermoistened with a ladle of delicious minestra broth.",
      "If you prefer a vegetarian minestra, flavor it during the long cooking with an herb pesto instead of the bacon pestata: in the food processor, chop the garlic and rosemary in 1/4 cup of extra-virgin olive oil, and scrape this into the soup pot as it comes to the boil.",
