When doing this pay careful attention to keep the potatoes as light and fluffy as possible. This will aid in keeping the gnocchi light. Refrigerate the potatoes on the sheet tray until cold.

The restaurant used a special meat grinder, but for the home cook, meat chopped into one-quarter to one-half-inch chunks is much better than ground meat for this chili. Alternatively, ask the butcher to put the meat through a \"chili plate\" ONE time - this is a very coarse grind, and works well for chili.",

Tear the chiles into flat pieces, then toast them a few at a time: Use a metal spatula to press the chile pieces flat against the hot surface, skin side up, until they are aromatic and have lightened in color underneath, about 10 seconds. (If heat is right, you'll have a slight crackle when you press them down, but you shouldn't see more than the slightest wisp of smoke.) Place in a bowl, cover with about 3 cups very hot tap water, lay a small plate on the chiles to keep them submerged and soak for 20 minutes.",
      "Use a pair of tongs to transfer the rehydrated chiles to a food processor or blender. Measure 1 1/2 cups of the soaking liquid and add it to the chiles along with the garlic. Blend to a smooth puree, then push through a medium-mesh strainer into a pie plate. The consistency should be like that of canned tomato sauce. Taste (the sauce will be a little rough on the tongue at this point) and season highly with salt, usually about 1/2 teaspoon.",
      "OTHER PRELIMINARIES: Set out the grated cheese and sliced onion. If using the optional chicken, warm it in a microwave or in a small skillet over medium-low heat (for stove-top heating, you'll want to dribble in a little water to keep it from sticking).",
      "FINISHING THE ENCHILADAS: Heat the oven to 350\u00b0F Place the sauce and tortillas near the stove, with a baking sheet beside them. Set a small (8-inch) skillet (preferable nonstick) over medium heat and add 1 tablespoon of the oil or lard. When the oil is hot, dip both sides of a tortilla into the sauce, then lay it in the oil. Let is sear and sizzle for about 20 seconds, then use a small spatula to flip it over. Sear the other side for about 20 seconds. Transfer to the baking sheet, folding it occasionally and then heating another tablespoon of oil or lard to fry a new batch. Arrange the fried, folded tortillas in groups of three, overlapping them. Pop them into the oven to heat through, about 5 minutes.",
      "While the enchiladas are heating, in a small bowl, toss the lettuce with the vinegar and a good sprinkling of salt.",

Do this two more times, draining and covering with fresh cold water each time, until you have soaked the tomatoes in fresh water a total of three times, for an hour each time. This step is important; it removes all of the lime so the tomatoes will be acid enough to can safely. DO NOT SKIP ANY OF THE SOAKING STEPS. Drain the tomatoes and set aside.",
      "Using a quadruple layer of cheesecloth, make a spice bag and tie the celery seeds, cloves, allspice, mustard seeds, and cinnamon up in it.",
      "In a large pan or stock pot (at least 6 quarts), combine the vinegar, sugar, salt, spice bag, and diced ginger. Bring to a boil, then add the drained tomatoes. Return to a boil, then simmer over medium heat for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally and pressing down on the tomatoes to keep them submerged in the brine.",
      "Stack the tomatoes in wide-mouth pint sized canning jars, placing a slice or two of onion between some of the layers in each jar. Place about a half teaspoon of the ginger pieces in each jar, discarding the remaining ginger, but reserving the syrup.",
      "Leave 1\" headspace in each jar between the tomato slices and the top of the jar, and cover the tomato slices with the hot syrup, leaving 1/2\" of headspace. Use a chopstick or other thin, non-metal utensil to run around the sides of the jar to make sure there are no air bubbles left in the jar. Wipe the rims of the jars with damp paper towels to remove any syrup which got on the rims or the threads. Place the lids and the bands on the jars, just tightening the bands fingertip tight.",
      "Process in a boiling water bath for 10 minutes, then remove and let sit, undisturbed, for at least 12 hours before checking seals. It is important to let them sit undisturbed for 12 hours because the sealing compound on the lids is still cooling and hardening, completing the seal. While the jars cool, you will hear a \"plink\" type sound from each jar - this is the jars completing the vacuum seal as the final air escapes the jar. After 12 hours have passed, remove the bands and check the lids - press down in the center of the lid. If you cannot push the lid down any further, the jar is sealed. If the lid \"gives\" a bit, and you can push it down, the jar did not seal. You can either put the band back on the jar, and reprocess it for another 10 minutes, or you can just put it in the fridge and use it within 3 months."

      "Step 1: RINSE THE RICE. Put the three cups of rice in a large bowl. Lightly rinse the rice by adding enough cold water to half fill the bowl and swirl it around with the rice. Rinse it, swirl it again and drain again and again. Scrunch the rice about in the bowl with your hands while rinsing it -- this should take 3 or 4 attempts. Transfer the rinsed rice into a large saucepan. Pour in 3 and 1/3 cups of water and leave it to soak for at least 30 minutes. As it soaks the rice will become whiter and water clear.",
      "Step 2. PREPARE THE SUSHI VINEGAR. Put half a cup of rice vinegar, quarter of a cup of sugar, a pinch of salt and a tablespoon of powdered Dashi into the small saucepan. Heat gently and stir to ensure that the sugar and salt dissolve. Don't let the mixture boil as it will impair the flavor. Only heat long enough to dissolve. Let it cool while you prepare the rice.",
      "Step 3. COOK THE RICE. Put the lid securely on top and turn the heat to high. Avoid lifting the lid at all times through out the cookin process as this will allow the steam to escape. When the rice begins to boil, reduce the heat and leave it to simmer for 15 minutes. After the fifteen minutes are up, turn off the heat and leave the rice to stand for another 15 minutes.",
      "Step 4. STIR IN THE SUSHI VINEGAR. Transfer rice into a large wooden bowl. *I use a glass one and it works fine* Pour the cooled sushi vinegar over the rice. Use a flat spatula in a cutting motion to fold the mixture into the rice. While you are folding, use your other hand to fan the rice. You want to bring that rice to room temperature while folding.",
      "Step 5. READY TO SERVE. It's best to use the rice immediately. It should be shiny and sticky, with each grain separated and not mashed together. It should be used at room temperature. If you don't need it straight away, cover the bowl with a damp cloth. This will prevent it from becoming to hard.",
