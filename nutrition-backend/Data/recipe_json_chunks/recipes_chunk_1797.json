      "Not to worry, you will be removing those, and yes, you absolutely will still be able to use those for your normal traditional gravies, stock and such.",
      "Another great reason for cooking from frozen is, because the breast is greater in mass, it takes much longer to thaw.",
      "When using a cook from frozen method it allows the thigh and leg to be cooked to moist and tender, while the breast is not overcooked and dried out.",
      "The breast will cook to a juicy 160-to-165AsF without any issues.",
      "Ok, now that we're all ok with giving this a try, let's go!",

      "You can also use a dial roast thermometer, but be sure it's inserted into the breast, because it is the slowest cooking part.",
