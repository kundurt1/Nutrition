      "If you are going to paint the bunny's face and other elements, decide on the colors you are going to use and then divide the cocoa butter into the number of colors selected. Place the cocoa butter in a yogurt maker (see tips, below) or individual stainless-steel bowls, using enough cocoa butter to keep it liquid, work the coloring powder into each one, and then, using a small paint brush, carefully paint the features directly onto the interior of the mold. (See tips, below.) Allow the cocoa butter to set for about 30 minutes, then proceed with the recipe. If you don't have the time or energy to make the cocoa butter colors, simply paint the face with tempered milk or white chocolate.",
      "Place a wire rack on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Set aside.",
      "Place the tempered chocolate in a warmed bowl.",
      "Clip the two parts of the mold together. Then, holding the mold upside down, pour the tempered chocolate into the mold. When it is full, immediately empty it back into the same bowl. The mold should be evenly coated with anywhere from 1/16 to 1/8 inch of chocolate. Tap the edge of the mold to release any air bubbles that might remain in the chocolate, to ensure a perfectly smooth coating. Wipe the edge of the mold clean on the edge of the bowl (you don't want to waste a drop of chocolate) and place the mold, open end down, on the wire rack. Let stand for about 5 minutes, or until the chocolate has begun to set.",
      "Once the chocolate hardens, using a pairing knife, scrape the open end of the mold clean. As the chocolate hardens, it will retract from the mold, and the clean edge helps prevent the chocolate from sticking and cracking as it shrinks. (If your kitchen is warm, place the mold in the refrigerator for a couple of minutes to facilitate hardening.)",
      "Repeat this process 2 more times, allowing the chocolate to thoroughly harden between pourings, to give a nice thick, child-friendly coating of chocolate.",
      "Once the chocolate has set, unclip the mold and lift the plastic from the chocolate form. If desired, wrap in cellophane and store in a cool, dry spot for up to 5 days.",
      "You can add flair to molded figures with just a few brushstrokes. In general, the area to be painted in a mold is small, so you don't need to mix a large amount of \"paint.\" I recommend using a yogurt maker (the type that has a few small containers) to mix and hold the paints. The temperature of the machine is perfect to keep the paint warm enough to remain constantly spreadable. It is a great place to store cocoa butter paint, too. (Of course, you can also use small stainless-steel bowls over hot water, but the yogurt maker makes the job much easier.) For each color, place a few tablespoons of cocoa butter in a yogurt container. Mix in powdered food coloring, a tiny bit at a time, until the desired color is reached. Then, using a fine-tipped paintbrush, carefully apply the paint to the interior area of the mold you are coloring (for example, red might be used to paint on the mouth of a human or animal figure). Allow the paint to set for about 30 minutes before you proceed with the recipe.",
      "You cannot mold tempered chocolate successfully in wood or other porous materials. Nor is glass a good choice. When you pour tempered chocolate into a glass mold, it immediately takes on the temperature of the glass, which if it is too hot or too cold will cause the chocolate to go out of temper. Antique metal molds, with interiors that have been damaged through years of use or the passage of time, are best used as wall decorations. Flexible plastic molds are terrific, but in time they begin to show wear and must be replaced. All of this is my way of saying that firm plastic and polycarbonate molds are the best choices for molding chocolate.",
      "Although you might have heard that coating a mold with fat will make removing the finished product easier, do not try it. It will not help unmold the item; it will only make it greasy. Chocolate, like plaster, retracts as it cools, which ensures that once it has set it will easily pull away from a plastic mold. Remember, chocolate reflects the surface against which it has been molded, so if properly done, the set chocolate will be smooth and shiny. However, the chocolate must be tempered-not simply melted-or it won't release.",
      "Before you begin to fill a mold, set up your workspace: Have the tempered chocolate in a bowl. Alongside the chocolate have the mold; a ladle; a paring knife; pastry scraper; large metal offset spatula, or other smooth-edged utensil; a wire rack on a parchment- or waxed paper-lined baking sheet; and some clean kitchen towels.",
      "Using the ladle, carefully fill the mold with the liquid chocolate. Once the mold is full, invert it over the bowl of tempered chocolate and allow the excess chocolate to drop back into the bowl. If the mold is finely detailed, it will be necessary to tap on the sides to release any air bubbles that might form in the raised detail. The mold should now be evenly coated with a thin layer (usually 1/8 or 1/16 inch thick, depending on the recipe) of chocolate. Wipe the edge of the mold, or the edge surrounding each cup in the mold, clean with a paring knife or pastry scraper. Place the chocolate-coated mold, open side down, on the wire rack. Let stand for about 5 minutes, or until the chocolate begins to harden. Using the paring knife, scrape the edge of the mold absolutely clean of hardened chocolate. This is important, because the chocolate retracts from the sides of the mold as it sets, and a clean edge will keep it from sticking and cracking as it shrinks. If desired, you can place the mold in the refrigerator for a few minutes to speed the hardening, but do not leave it there for any length of time.",
      "Once you have invested in molds, they can be used over and over again. My best advice for extending the life of plastic or polycarbonate molds is to clean them with care. Wash them in hot, soapy water, carefully wiping them clean with a soft cloth (never any rough material or a scouring pad). Then rinse them well under running water and dry thoroughly, as water deposits can be as damaging to molds as scratchy scrubbers."

I highly recommend cooking satay on an outdoor grill over charcoal briquettes, but gas will suffice (cook them indoors in a grill pan only if you have a very good exhaust system, since they generate a lot of smoke). Make the baste by mixing the reserved 1/4 cup marinade with the 1/3 cup coconut milk. Grill the ribs for about 2 minutes on each side (a little more or less, depending on how you like your meat). As they cook, brush the ribs with the basting liquid and a sprinkling of salt. Let the cooked ribs rest for 2 minutes before serving with the satay peanut sauce and cucumber ajat.

Simmer for 45 minutes while the meats are roasting. At the same time, in another sauce pan, place 2t, olive oil, the onion coarsely chopped, the celery cut into 1\" slices and the small carrots. Cook together until the onion is golden and the celery is limp. The carrots will not be soft--about ten minutes When that is done, put the beans in an oven proof dish. Add the meats and the vegetables to the beans and stir just a little. The liquid should be just over the top of the mixture, about 1/4\" .

If desired, sprinkle bread crumbs on top. Bake until the top of the pasta looks slightly browned - about 15 minutes."

In small fry pan or sauce pan (I use a black cast iron pan, 6\" on bottom, 7\" across top) put 1/2 c sugar at same time as milk and sugar. Shake the pan of sugar on medium heat until it melts & looks brown. The big pot and the sugar usually get ready about the same time. Stir the sugar &n milk to keep from sticking or running over. It is best to take the big pot at least partly off the stove when it comes to a full boil. Put the browned sugar in the big pot, stirring well & put back on stove & cook until it comes to the soft ball stage (a little dab put in a bowl of cold water). When it is at that stage, take off stove. Add 1 stick butter & 1 tsp vanilla. Let it cool some, beat with a spoon or wisk until it is spreading consistency. It has to cool a while. I use nuts between layers and also on top and sides as that is the way my folks like it, but it is not necessary."

      "Preheat oven to 375\u00b0F. Peel the onion and cut into eights, trim, wash, and slice the leek, peel and slice the garlic. Place a large ovenproof casserole pan over medium heat. Finely slice the pancetta, pick and finely chop the rosemary leaves, then place both in the pan with 1 tablespoon of oil and the bay leaves. Stir regularly for 2 minutes, then add the garlic, followed by the onion and leek. Cook for 10 minutes, stirring regularly.",
      "Meanwhile, chop the squash or sweet potato (wash first) into bite-sized chunks, leaving the skin on and discarding any squash seeds. I like to cut the stalk and face off the mushrooms because it looks nice-just add the trimmings straight to the pan, along with the whole mushrooms and chopped squash or sweet potato. Remove and discard the chicken skin and add the chicken to the pan. Pour in the wine and let it reduce slightly, then add the tomatoes and break them up with a wooden spoon. Half-fill each can with water, swirl about, pour into the pan, and mix it all together. Pit the olives, then poke them into the stew. Bring to a gentle simmer, then transfer to the oven to cook for 1 hour, or until thick, delicious, the chicken falls off the bone, and the squash or sweet potato is lovely and tender. Season to perfection, then serve with bread to mop up that tasty sauce."

Bring to a rapid boil. (You may need to use two pots if you do not have a single pot large enough to hold both ducklings at once; if so, divide the thyme and rosemary into smaller held-together bunches, and divide the garlic between the pots.) Place the ducks in the pot. If they pop up, keep them submerged using a smaller pot full of water or some other weight. Be aware of overflow. Bring the water back to a slow boil. Simmer the ducks for about 30 minutes. Remove them, and use paper towels to dry them thoroughly.",
      "Stuff each of the ducks' cavities with half of the boiled thyme, rosemary, and garlic and the quartered orange.",
      "Line the bottom of a large shallow roasting pan with the onions, carrots, and the orange rounds. Place the ducks, breast-side down, on top. Massage them with the Cointreau. This will give them a mahogany finish. Let them sit for 10 minutes for the skin to absorb the liqueur. Sprinkle with salt and pepper.",
      "Roast until the bottoms brown, about 20 minutes. Turn them breast-side up, and lower the oven temperature to 350\u00b0F. Several times during roasting, spoon off any excess fat as it accumulates, or suck it up using a baster. Use some of the fat to baste the ducks, and set the rest aside, saving some for the sauce.",
      "Depending on how long you boiled the ducks and the size of the ducks, roasting time will be another hour or longer. The ducks are done when a meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh registers at least 180\u00b0F, or until the juices run clear and the leg bones wiggle easily. You want the meat to slide off the bones. Don't be afraid of overcooking these. Ducks don't dry out easily. The skin should be crisp. If not, no worries. You will pass the pieces under the broiler before serving. (If the ducks are too crisp and the meat is not finished cooking, cover them with foil as you continue roasting.) Once the ducks are ready, remove them from the oven, and cover them with aluminum foil while you finish the sauce.",

      "Finish the sauce when you have retrieved rendered duck fat from the roasting duck. In a medium saucepan, warm the duck fat over medium heat. Add the flour, whisking with a fork as you do so. Remove the giblets and necks from the stock reduction, and discard. Add the stock to the duck fat-flour mixture, raise the heat to medium-high, and stir continuously to prevent lumps as you bring it to a slow boil. Add the Cointreau, vinegars, orange juice, marmalade, and orange peel to the pan. Bring back to a boil, melting the marmalade, then simmer uncovered on low heat until the sauce thickens and is reduced. Preheat a broiler with the rack set a notch or two down from the top position.",
      "When the ducks have rested at least 20 minutes, use a sharp knife or poultry scissors to split them and cut the breasts from the legs. Discard the orange quarters, herbs, wings, and any pockets of fat that remain. Slip the breast meat from the bones. Leave the legs intact. Put a little sauce in a broiling pan, and lay the duck pieces on top. Spoon a little sauce on top of each piece. Put them under the broiler for about 1 minute to crisp and glaze. Watch them carefully; the sugar in the sauce caramelizes quickly.",

Bake, tossing occasionally and rotating pans top to bottom halfway through, until beginning to brown in spots and dry out, 35-40 minutes. (Drying out the stuffing will help it absorb the eggs and stock without becoming mushy.) Let cool.",
      "Meanwhile, cook sweet potatoes in a large pot of boiling salted water until just beginning to soften but not fully cooked through, 7-9 minutes. Drain; transfer potatoes to a large bowl.",
      "Heat 2 Tbsp. oil in a large skillet over medium-high. Cook chorizo, breaking up with a wooden spoon, until lightly browned and slightly undercooked, about 5 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer to bowl with sweet potatoes.",
      "Heat remaining 1 Tbsp. oil in same skillet over medium. Add onions, celery, chiles (if using), garlic, paprika, 1 Tbsp. salt, and 1 tsp. pepper and cook, stirring often, until vegetables are tender, about 15 minutes. Add kale in batches as it wilts, then cider and sage and cook, stirring occasionally, until liquid is almost completely evaporated, about 5 minutes. Transfer to sweet potato mixture and toss to combine.",
      "Whisk eggs, stock, and vinegar in a large bowl or pitcher; season with remaining 1 Tbsp. salt and 2 tsp. pepper.",
      "Brush large roasting pan with an even layer of melted butter. Spread one-third of cornbread pieces in pan. Top with half of sweet potato mixture and spread to evenly distribute. Drizzle one-third of egg mixture over. Repeat with another third of the cornbread, remaining sweet potato mixture, then another third of egg mixture. There will be a lot of liquid in the pan-don't worry, it will become absorbed as the stuffing bakes. Top with remaining cornbread, then drizzle remaining egg mixture over. Brush top with remaining butter. Cover pan with foil and bake stuffing until heated through, about 45 minutes. Uncover and bake until surface is golden and crisp, 20-30 minutes longer.",
      "Cornbread can be toasted 1 day ahead; store tightly wrapped at room temperature. Sweet potato, chorizo, and kale mixture can be cooked 1 day ahead; cover and chill."

Garlic Sauce: 1 cup oil 1/3 cup lemon juice 6 cloves garlic, peeled 1 egg white* 1 tsp salt . Chicken Shawarma: In a large bowl add the lemon juice, olive oil, 1 tsp salt, cumin, black pepper, paprika, turmeric, red pepper flakes, cinnamon, garlic, and whisk well. Add the chicken and toss making sure the chicken is well coated in the marinade. Cover with plastic wrap or foil and refrigerate for at least an hour. The longer the meat marinades the more flavour you'll have. Preheat oven to 425 F degrees. Add sliced onion to bowl with chicken and toss well so that the onion is fully coated in the marinade. Add everything to a 9x13 baking dish. I didn't have much marinade leftover since the chicken absorbed most of it, so that's why I added everything to the baking dish. Spread everything evenly over the baking dish. Bake in the oven until the chicken is browned and crisp on the edges, for about 40 to 45 minutes. If you want the chicken crispier on top, turn the broiler on to high and broil for 3 minutes until nice and crispy on the outside. Let the chicken rest for about 5 minutes, then slice it into bits. Garlic Sauce: Add all the ingredients to a blender and blend until smooth, it should take 1 to 2 minutes. This recipe will make about 11/2 cups of sauce, refrigerate leftover sauce. Chicken Shawarma Wraps: To make the chicken shawarma wraps, warm up the wraps first in the microwave for about 30 seconds, then spread some hummus over each wrap, spoon about 2 or 3 tbsp of tabbouleh salad, add chicken shawarma, and drizzle with garlic sauce and serve."

As a guideline, roast the radicchio for about 25 minutes, turning halfway. Roast the onions about 35 minutes, again, turning halfway. Roast the squash pieces for 45 minutes, but do not turn.

      "First brown the meat with olive oil in a sauce pan on medium-high heat. About 5 minutes. Remove the meat and add it to the slow cooker. Add to the sauce pan the onions and the jalapeno pepper. After a minute or so, add the garlic and chopped carrot. Separating these steps is not crucial. I usually throw the garlic, onion, carrots, and jalapeno in a food processor then transfer this whole mix to the oil after the meat is browned. At this point, if you are not using a slow-cooker, you will add the tomatoes etc. But if you are using the slow cooker, pour the mixture in with the setting on low and pre-heated. Pull the tomatos apart and add them to the slow cooker (or sauce pan)with the tomato paste. Add dried italian seasoning (this is a combination of dried oregano etc)and some salt and pepper. Stir everything together. There are two ways to do the fresh basil: 1)add at the beginning then try to remove the starter basil and add a fresh round 2/3 through or just add 2/3 the way through. fresh herbs dont need to be added at the beginning because the flavor is readily unlocked versus dried herbs that need to be rehydrated during cooking. also at 2/3 through add the splash of red wine. the splash of red wine will provide taste and more importantly sugar that will cut the acidity.",
