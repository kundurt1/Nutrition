Mix in the rest of the flour until the dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl. Add remaining flour; 2 cups plus 2 tablespoons. If the dough is too wet, add more flour 2 tablespoons at a time. The dough will probably become too thick to beat; when it is, transfer it to a floured surface, and gently knead it until smooth. Grease a large bowl with a little oil. Transfer the dough to the bowl, and cover. Let rise at room temperature, in a warm place, until it doubles in size, about 1 hour. While the dough rises make the pastry cream.",

Adjust heat so the mixture bubbles gently; cook until it coats the back of a spoon (when you draw your finger through this coating, the resulting line should hold its shape). Stir in butter and vanilla. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve, into a bowl set over an ice bath. Refrigerate until chilled before using.",

Knead any scraps together, being careful not to overwork, and let rest for a few minutes before repeating the process. As you work, place the doughnuts on lightly floured baking with about 3 inches of room between each one. Let rise in a warm place until they have puffed and their tops have domed, about 45 minutes. About 15 minutes before the doughnuts are done rising, Attach a deep-frying thermometer to the side of large heavy-bottomed pot or dutch oven, heat 2-inches of oil, over medium-high, to 375 degrees F.",

You don't want the dough to form clumps, or it will affect how it bakes. Next, add 2/3 cup of grated Parmesan-Romano cheese, reserving the rest for the top. Toss until each piece is coated.",
      "You can bake this bread in any shape you like, but I usually use a loaf pan. Layer the dough quarters evenly in a standard 9x3x2 inch loaf pan sprayed with cooking spray. The dough pieces naturally stick together due to the butter and cheese, but gently pull apart any clumps of dough to be certain the bread bakes evenly. Sprinkle the remaining 1/4 cup of cheese on top and a sprinkle of parsley for color. Cover the pan loosely with plastic wrap that has been sprayed with cooking spray. This will keep the bread from sticking to the plastic wrap as it rises.",

If baking in a loaf, you may need to lay a piece of aluminum foil over the top of the bread to prevent the cheese and butter on top from over browning while the inside of the loaf fully bakes. Continue to bake the bread for another 5-7 minutes, until the center is completely done, approximately 23-25 minutes total, depending on your oven. Test the center of the rolls using a cake tester or toothpick to be certain the bread is cooked all the way through before removing it from the oven. My favorite way to serve this bread?

I set the temperature to just a bit darker than medium and set a timer to count down two and a half minutes just as I'm pouring the batter on the iron. A cup of batter on my iron yields an 8-inch round, four-way-split waffle. That's just a guideline if you have a large waffle iron; so many shapes and sizes are available and the perfect waffle on your waffle iron will require some tinkering with amounts, settings and timing.",

The results won't be as elastic and springy, but it'll still be great. Of course you can always use real buttermilk, just remember to adjust the flour to make up for the lack of buttermilk powder. I've used leftover eggnog as the main liquid in this recipe and the resulting waffles were to DIE for -- and I despise eggnog!"
