      "To make savory biscuits, layer caramelized onions into the biscuits when you fold them.",
      "Youll need to cook the onions well in advance, because its important that they be cool when you layer them; otherwise, theyll cause the butter in the dough to melt, which will damage the texture of the baked biscuit.",

      "Be careful when using strong herbs or spices, such as rosemary, oregano, sage, anise, fennel, cumin, chili powder, and the like, as they can easily overpower the biscuits.",
      "Use these stronger seasonings in moderation and in combination with milder herbs like parsley.",
      "Ground pepper is always an option; just 1/4 teaspoon will provide a surprisingly strong kick.",
      "Dried herbs will also work, but dont use more than 1/4 cup; and again, use primarily mild herbs like parsley, chervil, and basil.",
      "To make sweet variations, keep in mind that there is very little difference between a biscuit and a scone, so consider sweet biscuits to be flaky, tender scones and try adding dried fruits such as currants, raisins, cranberries, cherries, pineapple, apricots, or blueberries, as well as candied ginger (in moderation).",
      "Cut larger dried fruit into small bits.",
      "Add 1 cup (6 oz) of dried fruit (or more, if you like) in any combination, when you add the cream.",
      "Just dont use fresh fruit or berries, as they would make the biscuits soggy and destroy the flakiness.",
      "The single most important technique is to use very cold butter and liquid.",
      "Some biscuit makers go so far as to chill the flour, but this isnt necessary if the butter and cream are cold.",
      "Using cold ingredients ensures that the butter stays in bits and pieces, which shortens the gluten strands (thus the term shortening, used to describe all solid fats, including butter and margarine).",
      "Using bits of cold butter creates weak points in the dough that flake off when you take a bite.",
      "Work quickly to keep the dough cold, but dont overwork the dough.",
      "Gluten is what makes dough tough, and the more you mix the dough, the more organized the gluten strands become.",
      "As a general rule of thumb, mix only as long as needed to get the job done.",
      "As every great biscuit maker will attest, its all in the touch.",
      "The folding technique described in the recipe is similar to the lamination method known as blitz.",
      "It creates many thin layers of dough and fat, causing the biscuits to puff up and open like an accordion, creating maximum flakiness.",
      "The oven must be hot in order to trap the butter inside the biscuit and increase the puffing quality.",
      "In a cooler oven, below 450F (232C), some of the butter might run out onto the pan, so preheat the oven to 500F (260C), then lower the heat to 450F (232C) as soon as you put the biscuits in to bake.",
      "(If you preheat the oven to 450F (232C), it will drop to below 400F (204C) when you open the door.)",
      "Chilling the biscuits before baking them not only relaxes the gluten, it also minimizes the amount of butter that may run out of the biscuits as they bake.",
      "The best way to make biscuits is to bake them 15 to 30 minutes after the dough is cut, placed on the pan, and briefly chilled.",
      "However, when this isnt always practical, its better to bake the biscuits when you plan to eat them rather than bake them in advance and try to warm them up later.",
      "So here are three make-ahead options:",
      "Freeze: Cut and pan the biscuits but dont bake them.",
      "Instead, completely wrap the pan (under and around the pan) in plastic wrap or use a food-grade plastic bag.",
      "If you wrap it well, you can freeze the pan of unbaked biscuits for up to 1 month.",
      "Remove the pan from the freezer at least 3 hours before you plan to bake the biscuits so they can thaw.",
      "Dont bake them while theyre still frozen or they wont rise or bake evenly.",
      "If freezer space is an issue, you can also wrap individual biscuits in plastic wrap, stack them up, and freeze them.",
      "Refrigerate: Wrap the pan or individual biscuits as described above, but instead of freezing, refrigerate them.",
      "This is especially practical if you plan to bake the biscuits within 3 days.",
      "For even baking, remove the biscuits from the refrigerator about 30 minutes before baking to remove some of the chill.",
      "Parbake: Bake the biscuits as described in the recipe, but only until slightly golden on the tops and bottoms4 to 5 minutes less than the full baking time.",
      "Remove the pan from the oven and cool the biscuits thoroughly before wrapping them individually or wrapping the entire pan and freezing.",
      "When you want to finish baking them, preheat the oven to 450F (232C) and place the frozen biscuits on an ungreased baking sheet.",
      "Bake for 10 to 12 minutes, until the tops and bottoms of the biscuits are golden brown.",
      "Cool for 5 minutes before serving; this allows the heat to reach the center, warming but not drying out the biscuit."

      "Add all ingredients together [except for the egg roll wraps, shrimp, eggs, carrots, green onions and oil] in a bowl and mix until everything is fully coated.",
      "Allow it to marinate for a 1/2 hour in fridge if possible.",
      "Authors Note: The reason for mixing all of these ingredients listed above together [as opposed to layering them] is to have your guests intermittently and individually taste the flavors of ginger, garlic, radishes, etc.",
      "Not to have their pallets hit by each of them at the same time.",
      "Slice carrot and green chives in 5\" long thin strips and set to the side.",
      "The reason for these vegetables to be layered and added seperate from the marinade is to have a snap in each bite and to taste the carrot and chive individually.",
      "The same reasoning with regards to the shrimp.",
      "Beat 2 eggs in a separate bowl and set to the side.",
      "Pull out one square egg roll wrap and face one of the pointed ends towards you.",
      "Like a diamond shape.",

      "Continue rolling until you reach the end of wrap.",
      "Make certain all of your edges are sealed.",
      "If they're not, add more egg mixture and pinch the ends to make a tighter seal.",
      "Don't worry about using too much egg mixture other than running out of it.",
      "If that happens, just beat another egg.",
      "If there are any holes or openings, oil will enter your egg roll and make them soggy and oily.",
      "If your rolls aren't tightly rolled, they will fall apart so make certain these wraps are as tight as you can make them without splitting your rolls.",
      "Continue to tightly wrap all of your egg rolls and be sure to mix your cabbage mixture and shake off excess soy sauce each time before placing it on your wrap.",
      "Turn on your fryer or heat you oil in your pan until it's at a higher heat.",
      "Add four egg rolls to your heated oil and fry for approximately 2 1/2 minutes flipping them regularly.",
      "Any more than adding four rolls to your oil will cause your oil to cool down too much and overcook or over saturate your rolls.",
