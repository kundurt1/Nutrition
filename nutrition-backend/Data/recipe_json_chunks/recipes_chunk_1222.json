To crush my peppercorns I put them in a small baggie and use a meat mallet or rolling pin and just hit them until they are roughly crushed. Add the salt, dijon mustard, garlic, olive oil and mix well. Take this mixture and rub all over the meat very well. Put the meat in a glass not metal pan and cover with plastic wrap and let marinate all day. At least 4 hours, but I have even let it go overnight and it tasted great.",

Then spread on a small piece of parchment paper or plastic wrap. Wrap it up and form in a small log shape. Refrigerate until firm. The butter will be cut in small rounds and added to each slice of beef when served.",
      "Steak -- Three things to remember. First, always let the beef come to room temperature before cooking. Second, the ends are always thinner, so I fold them in and then tie them with a piece of kitchen twine to make the ends approximately the same size as the rest of the tenderloin. If you didn't wrap the ends in, they would be well done while the rest of the tenderloin was still raw. And third, the key is a good pan sear in a heavy pan on the stove. On medium high to high heat (cast iron or oven proof pan) heat up the butter and oil and pan sear the room temperature tenderloin until brown on each side. Not too long - just long enough to a nice crust.",
      "Once your tenderloin is golden brown, remove from the heat and transfer to the oven; 450 degrees for about 8-10 minutes. Trust me - there is NO MAGIC time. Everyone's oven, pans and meat are different. There isn't that perfect time that works every time and even when I cook this recipe, each time it is a bit different and it should be, that is normal. I have 2 tenderloins in the freezer. One is flatter and the other thicker, both the same weight. And it is common sense that they will take different times to cook, so just remember that using a thermometer is really the only way to test and to make sure the meat is cooked to the right temperature.",
      "After 8-10 minutes check the temperature using a meat thermometer; and I take 2 readings to make sure you get an accurate read. Remove the tenderloin just before your tenderloin reaches that perfect temperature as the tenderloin once removed will continue to cook as it rests. I remove at these temperatures as the meat will usually go up 3-5 degrees as it rests. So, 120 for rare; 130 for medium rare; 140 for medium; and 150 for medium well to well.",
      "Once the beef reaches the correct temperature, remove from the oven and from the pan, cover with foil and let rest 10-15 minutes before slicing.",
      "Serve -- Slice the tenderloin and serve with a slice of the chilled peppercorn butter. It will melt and drizzle all over the steak.",
      "Garnish -- If you want, a few crumbles of gorgonzola cheese are a nice touch, just a few. Or another favorite is just a few very thin fried onion rings."

      "Set oven to 350 degrees F (second-lowest oven rack).",
      "Grease a 13 x 9-inch baking pan or use a larger pan (for easier clean up I strongly advise to use a disposable heavy foil pan).",
      "Make certain that the cabbage heads are completely thawed before using for this (to do this remove the heads of cabbage from freezer and place in a bowl then thaw at room temperature overnight).",
      "Using a small sharp knife carefully remove the hard core/stem from the center of the head, then remove the leaves from the cabbage (you may need to keep slicing off some middle part to remove the leaves easier).",
      "To speed up cooking time you may want to cook the leaves in boiling salted water for about 8-10 minutes this will give the cabbage rolls a head start and reduce cooking time slightly.",
      "Using your hands gently squeeze out 2 to 3 leaves at a time to remove excess water, then place the leaves in a large bowl; set aside.",
      "FOR MEAT FILLING; using clean hands mix all ingredients together for the meat filling in large bowl until thoroughly combined.",
      "FOR SAUCE; in another bowl combine all sauce ingredients together until blended (adjust the salt and pepper to taste).",
      "Line the bottom of the pan with cabbage leaves (due to the long cooking time this will protect the rolls from over browning/burning in the pan while cooking, you may also place leaves on top of the sauce then cover with foil but that is optional).",
      "Using a large spoon or a ladle drizzle half of the sauce over the leaves then spread out to cover the leaves (does not have to cover the leaves completely).",
      "Stuff the cabbage leaves tightly but carefully with the meat mixture (I use about 1/3-cup for larger leaves).",
      "Roll up tightly and place the rolls in a single layer on top of the cabbage leaves and sauce in the baking dish.",
      "Drizzle the remaining sauce over the rolls (using a butter knife separate the rolls slightly to insure the sauce settles between and around each roll).",
      "Sprinkle about 1/2 cup or a little more sauerkraut over the sauce (if using).",
      "At this point you may cover the rolls with more leaves if desired (this is optional but good to do).",
      "Cover tightly with foil.",
      "IMPORTANT; if you are using a 13 x 9-inch dish it will be very full so place on a large jelly-roll pan to catch any spills.",
      "Cook at 350 degrees F (oven rack set to second-lowest position) for about 2-1/2 to 3 hours or until the cabbage is very tender, the cooking time will vary depending on how thick the cabbage leaves are and if you have pre-boiled the leaves firstly, I usually check after about 2 hours)."

Transfer pan to a wire rack and let cool about 15 minutes. While the bottom crust is baking and the remaining dough is chilling, make the caramel filling. Place the unwrapped caramels in a microwave-safe bowl. Add the cream. Microwave on high for 1 minute. Remove from the microwave and stir until smooth. If caramels are not completely melted, microwave on high for 30-second intervals, stirring after each interval, until smooth (I did the melting in a saucepan stovetop since I don't microwave). Pour the caramel filling over the crust. If you are going to salt the caramel sprinkle it on caramel layer now. Remove the remaining chilled dough from the refrigerator and crumble it evenly over the caramel. Return the pan to the oven and bake until the filling is bubbly and the crumbled shortbread topping is firm and lightly golden, about 25 - 30 minutes. Let cool before cutting into squares."

Remove from the heat and let cool slightly.",

Then whisk in the flour and cook just a minute to get rid of the flour taste. Add the chicken bouillon and milk and bring to medium heat until the sauce thickens. Season with the rosemary, salt and pepper.",

If you are getting the ground meat from a source you trust (we got ours from Whole Foods) that does their own grinding on site, or you grind your own meat, you can safely cook the burgers rare or medium rare.

Place second jalapeno, whole, into pot with two bay leaves. Add enough water to cover the chicken and vegetable (about 2 - 3 cups). Sprinkle one teaspoons chicken bouillon, 1/2 tsp fresh oregano, 1/4 tsp cumin, 1/4 tsp black pepper, and 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes on top. Stir broth to distribute seasonings.",

Bake the cookies, one sheet at a time in the upper third of the oven, reversing sheets halfway through baking from front to back to ensure even browning for 9-14 minutes or just until slightly darker at the edges. Using a spatula, immediately transfer the cookies to wire racks to cool completely. Store in an airtight container for up to 1 week or freeze for up to one month."

      "For the Crust: Beat egg yolk and cream together in small bowl. Process almonds and sugar in food processor until nuts are finely ground, 15 to 20 seconds. Add flour and salt; pulse to combine, about 10 pulses. Scatter butter over flour mixture; pulse to cut butter into flour until mixture resembles coarse meal, about 15 pulses. With processor running, add egg yolk mixture and process until dough forms ball, about 10 seconds. Transfer dough to large sheet of plastic wrap and press into 6-inch disk; wrap dough in plastic and refrigerate until firm but malleable, about 30 minutes. (Dough can be refrigerated for up to 3 days; before using, let stand at room temperature until malleable but still cool.).",
      "Roll out dough between 2 large sheets of plastic into 11-inch round about 3/8 inch thick. (If dough becomes too soft and sticky to work with, slip it onto baking sheet and refrigerate until workable.) Place dough round on baking sheet and refrigerate until firm but pliable, about 15 minutes.",
      "Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 375 degrees. Spray 9-inch tart pan with removable bottom with vegetable oil spray. Keeping dough on sheet, remove top layer of plastic. Invert tart pan (with bottom) on top of dough round. Press on tart pan to cut dough. Using both hands, pick up sheet and tart pan and carefully invert both, setting tart pan right side up. Remove sheet and peel off plastic; reserve plastic. Roll over edges of tart pan with rolling pin to cut dough. Gently ease and press dough into bottom of pan, reserving scraps. Roll dough scraps into 3/4-inch rope (various lengths are OK). Line edge of tart pan with rope(s) and gently press into fluted sides. Line tart pan with reserved plastic and, using measuring cup, gently press and smooth dough to even thickness (sides should be about 1/4 inch thick). Using paring knife, trim any excess dough above rim of tart; discard scraps. Freeze dough-lined pan until dough is firm, 20 to 30 minutes.",
      "Set dough-lined pan on baking sheet. Spray 12-inch square of aluminum foil with oil spray and press foil, sprayed side down, into pan; fill with 2 cups pie weights. Bake until dough is dry and light golden brown, about 25 minutes, rotating sheet halfway through baking. Carefully remove foil and weights and continue to bake until pastry is rich golden brown and fragrant, 8 to 10 minutes longer. Let cool completely on baking sheet on wire rack.",
      "For the Filling.",
      "Heat oven to 250 degrees. Bring cream, espresso powder, and salt to simmer in small saucepan over medium heat, stirring once or twice to dissolve espresso powder and salt. Meanwhile, place chocolate in large heatproof bowl. Pour simmering cream mixture over chocolate, cover, and let stand for 5 minutes to allow chocolate to soften. Using whisk, stir mixture slowly and gently (so as not to incorporate air) until homogeneous. Add butter and continue to whisk gently until fully incorporated. Pour beaten eggs through fine-mesh strainer into chocolate mixture; whisk slowly until mixture is homogeneous and glossy. Pour filling into tart crust and shake gently from side to side to distribute and smooth surface; pop any large bubbles with toothpick or skewer. Bake tart, on baking sheet, until outer edge of filling is just set and very faint cracks appear on surface, 30 to 35 minutes; filling will still be very wobbly. Let cool completely on baking sheet on wire rack. Refrigerate, uncovered, until filling is chilled and set, at least 3 hours or up to 18 hours.",
      "For the Glaze.",
      "Thirty minutes before glazing, remove tart from refrigerator. Bring cream and corn syrup to simmer in small saucepan over medium heat; stir once or twice to combine. Remove pan from heat, add chocolate, and cover. Let stand for 5 minutes to allow chocolate to soften. Whisk gently (so as not to incorporate air) until mixture is smooth, then whisk in hot water until glaze is homogeneous, shiny, and pourable. Working quickly, pour glaze onto center of tart. To distribute glaze, tilt tart and allow glaze to run to edge. (Spreading glaze with spatula will leave marks on surface.) Pop any large bubbles with toothpick or skewer. Let cool completely, about 1 hour.",
      "To Serve.",
      "Remove outer ring from tart pan. Insert thin- bladed metal spatula between crust and pan bottom to loosen tart; slide tart onto serving platter. Cut into wedges and serve."
