      "Melt stick of butter in a microwave safe dish and set aside to cool. Set out a large bowl in which you will put your popcorn when it is popped. Put vegetable oil and coconut oil in a large stock pot that has a lid over medium high heat on the stove top. Put 3-4 kernels of popcorn in the oil to heat and put the lid on the pot. These kernels are indicators and when they pop, you will know that the oil is ready.",
      "Add popcorn all at once and place the lid back on the pot. Using large kitchen pot holders, set the lid slightly askew and hold the pot with your hands on both sides so that you can shake the pot and hold the lid slightly askew at the same time. Begin shaking the pot gently back and forth over the burner. Make sure to keep the lid askew so that steam can escape - this keeps the popcorn crispy. Steam causes wilting. You will hear the popcorn begin to pop - keep shaking until the popcorn popping slows to one or two pops per second. Remove the pot immediately from the heat and pour immediately into the large bowl that you set out in step one. It is important to pour the popcorn into the other bowl to stop the cooking - so that popcorn does not become over cooked. Allow popcorn to cool for at least 5 minutes.",
      "When popcorn is cooled and butter has also cooled, you will note that the butter has white solids floating on the top. With a spoon, skim the white solids off of the top of the butter and sprinkle over the top of the popcorn. Do not do this while the popcorn is hot or the butter is hot as this will cause the popcorn to shrivel and become wilted. Once both are cooled - it will make an excellent flavoring for your popcorn. You may add as much of the remainder of the butter that you like or reserve for another use. Sprinkle with Popcorn salt to taste. Use the Popcorn salt rather than typical table salt - popcorn salt is smaller and clings to the popcorn kernels better."

    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "Special Equipment: spatula; rimmed baking sheet; baking rack; pastry brush; thermometer; fine-mesh strainer",
      "For the goat cheese mousse: In a medium mixing bowl, add 2 1/4 cups goat cheese, 1/3 cup of the heavy cream, rosemary, lemon zest, and black pepper. Fit the KitchenAid(R) 7-Speed Hand Mixer with the turbo beater attachments. Place the beaters into the goat cheese mixture and turn to speed 2. Mix until just combined, then gradually increase to speed 4 and cream for 2 minutes, or until the goat cheese is light and creamy. Use a spatula to scrape down the bowl and beaters as needed during the mixing process. Once the mixture is creamy, turn off the mixer and remove the turbo beaters.",
      "In a medium mixing bowl, add the remaining 3/4 cup heavy cream. Fit the hand mixer with the whisk attachment. Place the whisk into the cream and turn to speed 4. Whip until the cream begins to thicken, about 1 minute, then increase to speed 7 and whip until soft peaks form, another 35-45 seconds. Turn off the mixer.",
      "Using a spatula, gently fold the whipped cream into the goat cheese mixture in 3 increments until combined. Take care to not overmix the mousse by folding, not stirring. Place the mousse into a bowl until ready to use.",
      "For the balsamic caramel: Place 1/2 cup balsamic vinegar, 1/2 cup red wine(or port), 3/4 cup sugar, 1 Tbs shallots, 1/2 tsp peppercorns, and rosemary sprig into a small, but tall, saucepan. Set over a stove turned to medium heat. Using a spatula, stir until the sugar dissolves. Dip a pastry brush in water and brush down the sides of the saucepan (this will prevent crystallization of the syrup). Bring the mixture up to a boil, then cook, without stirring, until it reaches 235\u00b0F/112.7\u00b0C on a thermometer, 6-9 minutes. (If the mixture begins to bubble over, simply reduce the heat a bit to prevent it from overflowing). Remove the saucepan from the stove and strain the caramel into a heat proof container. Discard the solids. Let the caramel cool to room temperature before serving.",
      "For the crostinis: Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F/180\u00b0C/gas 4, and place the rack in the center of the oven. Brush one side of the crostinis with 1/3 cup olive oil, then flip the pieces and brush the other side, then arrange them on your baking sheet. Season the tops with a sprinkling of flake salt and black pepper, the bake until golden (about 12-15 minutes). Remove from oven and let cool before using.",
      "For the assembly: Spread 1-2 rounded teaspoons of the goat cheese mousse onto each crostini and top with the Balsamic Caramel, toasted walnuts and fresh thyme. Place finished crostinis on a platter and serve.",
      "Chef's Notes: To toast walnuts: Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F/180\u00b0C/gas 4. Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Scatter the walnuts onto the parchment paper and place in the oven. Bake for 7-10 minutes, or until golden. Shake or stir the baking sheet occasionally so the walnuts bake evenly. Let cool on a baking rack.",
      "Be sure to use a high quality goat cheese that comes in a round or log so you get a creamier texture for the mousse. (Avoid pre-crumbled goat cheese for this recipe.)",
      "Crostini can be made up to 3 days in advance of assembly. After toasting, place them in a sealed plastic bag stored at room temperature."

Set the steak aside while you enjoy a beer. Steaks are best cooked at room temperature so that they cook evenly. Use High Direct Heat 450- 500 degrees 7 to 9 minutes per side. This will vary with their size and how well done you want it. One this size it will be rare to medium rare.",

Place the garlic on the grill with a folded piece of foil so it won't fall through the grill if falls apart. Using a small cooking grate lay out the asparagus and onions giving them a spritz of olive oil. Salt and pepper the veggies to taste and place them on the grill over Low Indirect Heat around 300. Let the veggies soak up the hickory for about a half hour or so until they are about done, then turn the heat up to high. (Still use indirect heat.) As the temp is coming up watch your veggies because they won't be able to take this kind of heat for long. I like to pull them when they are still a little crisp.

If using a mixture of purple rice and white rice, the color from the purple rice will slowly dissolve into the water and color the white rice.\n\nWhen you are ready to cook the rice, heat water in a steamer until it is boiling.

Do not boil, because you will change the texture and taste and may split the oil from the milk. Palm sugar needs to be heated in liquid to dissolve; it may take a while-be patient. Since the coconut milk stays hot, the palm sugar dissolves even when the heat is off.\n\nBreak up any clumps in the rice and mix until it is evenly mixed and the rice starts to absorb the coconut milk. Let stand for 20 minutes to an hour to allow the rice to fully absorb the coconut milk and for the flavors to blend.",

Make sure there are no lumps.\n\nHeat coconut cream and salt, but do not let boil. Stir in the flour paste, and continue heating and stirring until the mixture thickens. You can let it come nearly to a boil, but don't let it boil (remove it from heat when it gets close). If it isn't very thick, you can make a little bit more flour paste and cook it in the mixture.\n\nDo not add the sugar until the flour has thickened the mixture, otherwise it will lose its sheen and become an unappetizing grey. Once the mixture is thick, add the sugar and stir until it is dissolved. The mixture should taste noticeably salty and a little sweet.\n\nRemove from heat and let slightly cool. Move the mixture to a small container or serving pitcher (a ketchup bottle works well). Refrigerating helps the mixture thicken a bit.",
      "To serve, place an oval mound of rice on a large serving plate or on individual serving plates. Top with some mango slices arranged in an attractive fashion. Use a small amount of the drizzling sauce to sweeten the mango, and bring the extra drizzling sauce and mangos to the table, so that diners can sweeten their dish even more.\n\nThe rice tastes best within an hour of when it is made. After that,The coconut milk keeps the rice moist so you can eat it for the next 24 hours or so but it will dry out some - to freshen leftovers, mix in some extra drizzling sauce to remoisten. Revitalize it by heating it (either by steaming it or using a microwave), though it will taste like leftovers and never be as good as when it is freshly made."
