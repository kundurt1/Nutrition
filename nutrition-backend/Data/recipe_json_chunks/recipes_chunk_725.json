      "In a frying pan, melt butter and saute onion, garlic, squash and zucchini. Add salt and pepper to taste. In the meantime, heat pie shell until about half way cooked. When the ingredients in the frying pan have been sauteed, layer them into the bottom of the pie shell. Add a generous layer of sliced tomatoes and sprinkle with the grated cheese. Bake at 350\u00b0 for about 30 minutes. Hint: You may want to carefully tilt the pie shell after about 15 minutes of baking to let some of the water from the vegetables drain off. The pie freezes well and makes a great wintertime treat when you are craving fresh tomatoes."
