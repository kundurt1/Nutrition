      "Combine yeast and 300 g (1 1/4 cups) room-temperature water in the bowl of a stand mixer. Take the temperature of your kitchen-between 72\u00b0F and 74\u00b0F is ideal for fermentation. If your kitchen is running hot, use cool water. If it's a bit colder, use warm water. Add all the flours and mix with a wooden spoon until no dry spots remain. Cover with plastic wrap and let sit at room temperature until poolish is mature (surface will be very bubbly), 14-18 hours.",
      "Drop a pinch of poolish into a small bowl of room-temperature water. If it floats, it's mature, and you're good to go. If it sinks, wait 30 minutes and test again.",
      "Combine 300 g (1 1/4 cups) room-temperature water into poolish with a sturdy wooden spoon. Add whole wheat flour and 412 g (3 cups plus 1 Tbsp.) all-purpose flour and mix until no dry spots remain. Cover dough with plastic wrap and let sit 2 hours. (This -process, called autolysis, starts to develop the all-important gluten, giving the dough structure and chew.)",
      "Evenly sprinkle salt over dough, then add 65 g (1/4 cup plus 1 tsp.) room-temperature water and mix with dough hook on medium-low speed. The dough should start to develop a shape and cling to hook after a minute or two. Increase speed to medium-high and mix until almost all the dough clings to hook and clears the sides of the bowl, 8-12 minutes. Cover with plastic wrap and let sit 15 minutes to let dough relax.",
      "Turn out dough on a clean surface. Holding a flexible bench scraper in one hand, quickly lift dough eye-level then slap it down on surface in one swift, deliberate motion. As you propel dough downward, let it fall off the ends of your hands and fold over onto itself; the dough will be sticky, but it will want to stick to itself more than your hands. Start slowly to avoid flying dough bits, then increase the intensity of your motion as the dough starts to firm up. Slap and fold 10-12 -minutes, occasionally scraping bits of dough from surface with bench scraper. (If you're not slightly winded by the time the dough is ready, you're doing it wrong.) This important step builds gluten and strengthens the dough, which helps give the -finished loaf a nice open crumb.",
      "Pinch off a small piece of dough and stretch it between your thumbs and index fingers on both hands. The dough should be able to stretch thin enough to let light through without breaking. If it splits or tears, the gluten is not yet developed enough. Continue slapping and folding another 2 minutes and test again.",
      "Place dough in a large clean bowl and cover with plastic wrap; let sit 30 minutes. Starting from one side, use a bench scraper to lift edge of dough, stretching it up and out of the bowl at least 12\" and shaking back and forth to encourage lengthening, then fold back onto itself. Rotate the bowl 90\u00b0. Repeat stretching process 3 more times, rotating the bowl after each turn. Cover and rest another 30 minutes. Repeat process 2 more times, resting dough 30 minutes in between each full turn. (This rebuilds gluten and feeds the yeast during fermentation.) Cover dough with plastic wrap and let sit in a warm spot until nearly doubled in size, 30-60 minutes. Dough should look puffed and bubbly on the surface.",
      "To test if your dough is fermented, poke it with an oiled finger. The dough should spring back slowly but still hold a slight indentation.",
      "Turn out dough onto a lightly floured (use all-purpose) surface and do a final series of 4 folds, bringing edges into the center. Turn dough over, using bench scraper to help you, so seam side is down. Lightly dust with more flour and cover with a kitchen towel. Let rest until dough is puffed and surface is dotted with a few bubbles, 20-50 minutes.",
      "Line a 9\" round colander with a clean kitchen towel and dust towel with an even layer of rice flour.",
      "Uncover dough and dust with a bit more all-purpose flour. Use bench scraper to push edges of dough toward the center to gather into a ball. Cup scraper and free hand around far side of dough and gently pull ball toward you, dragging dough several inches across work -surface and rotating slightly. Repeat dragging motion several times, occasionally moving dough back to center of surface. The friction against the surface will help tighten the gluten over the dough, creating a smooth dome. Lightly flour top of dough, turn over with bench scraper, and quickly transfer, seam side up, to prepared colander; cover with -plastic. Chill 1-2 days. The -longer the bread sits, the more complex the flavor will be, but don't chill longer or the yeast may die.",
      "Place an oven rack in lower third of oven and set a 3 1/2-5 1/2-qt. Dutch oven in center of rack. Set your oven as high as it will go (you want it between 450\u00b0F and 500\u00b0F). Let pot preheat at least 40 minutes. (If the handle on the lid is made of -plastic, unscrew, remove, and plug hole with a small piece of foil.)",
      "Uncover dough and dust surface with rice flour. Cut a round of parchment paper so it's slightly larger than dough; place over top. Remove pot from oven and set on stovetop.",
      "Working on stove next to Dutch oven, invert dough onto a plate (parchment side will be down). Use a lame or a razor blade taped to an ice-pop stick to slash dough in desired pattern, using swift and deliberate strokes to cut at least 1/2\" deep into dough. Working quickly and wearing mitts on both hands, slide dough and parchment into center of pot. Cover pot and bake bread 15 minutes. Remove lid and -continue to bake, rotating pot halfway through, until crust is very well done-approaching the edge of burnt-30-40 minutes. Carefully -transfer bread to a wire rack. When it's cool enough to handle, remove parchment.",
      "Resist the temptation to cut into that just-out-of-the-oven loaf. Trust us. You want to wait at least a couple of hours so the starches in the bread have time to set. This gives the bread a better texture. If you're dead set on eating it warm, reheat part of the loaf in a 300\u00b0F oven (which will also revive the crust), then slice."

Once milk starts boiling, simmer and continue to boil until the milk reduced to half it's quantity. Keep scrapping the sides of the pan to avoid burning of milk solids. 3. Once milk has reduced to more than half, add sugar, stir well. Continue to boil for another 7 minutes. 4. Grate khoya and break any big lumps in it. Grind nuts into small pieces(not powder). 5. Remove the pulp from the mangoes and blend into smooth paste without any water. Add this mango puree into the boiling milk. Boil for 5 minutes. 6. Add the khoya to the milk and whisk well making sure no lumps are present. Keep stirring until all khoya melts. 7. In 1 teaspoon water add corn flour and mix well. Add this mix to milk and stir again. Keep stirring and boil for another 5 minutes. 8. Finally add nuts, cardamom powder and saffron milk mix. Stir. Let it boil for another 3 minutes. 9. Switch off flame and let it cool down. 10. Pour the kulfi mix into earthen pots or any moulds. Cover with aluminum foil and pop them into the freezer, preferably over night. 11. Once kulfi is set, serve them chilled."

Continue stirring this mixture until all of the lumps are smoothed out and the polenta is fully incorporated. Simmer for 45 minutes to 1 hour-the polenta should bubble slightly-stirring occasionally with a wooden spoon. (Be sure to scrape the bottom as you go, to prevent sticking.) Toward the end of the simmering, remove the polenta from the heat and stir in the kefir.",
      "While the polenta is cooking, in a saucepan, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the porcinis, evenly distributing them over the bottom of the pot. Let the mushrooms sit, without stirring, until browned, 7 to 10 minutes. (Do not stir them too early; listen for the sizzling sound of moisture evaporating before stirring.) Once the moisture has evaporated, give them a quick stir, then remove the pan from the heat.",
      "Ladle the polenta into a medium/large shallow bowl, topping with the mushrooms and pecorino cheese. Sprinkle the entire platter with the truffle salt or the truffle oil or shave the fresh truffle over it; don't use more than one of these options or it will overpower the dish. If not using truffle salt, sprinkle with a generous pinch of Maldon sea salt."

      "Shrimp is usually sold by the number needed to make one pound. For example, \"21-25 count\" means there will be 21 to 25 shrimp in a pound. Size names, such as \"large\" or \"extra large,\" are not standardized, so to get the size you want, order by the count per pound. Both wild-caught and farm-raised shrimp can damage the surrounding ecosystems when not managed properly. Fortunately, it is possible to buy shrimp that have been raised or caught with sound environmental practices. Look for fresh or frozen shrimp certified by an independent agency, such as the Marine Stewardship Council."

Fold the dough in half, putting the cheese as a sort of stuffed crust on a pizza, except without the pizza part!! Brush the olive oil on the dough (feel free to use as much or as little as you want, based on the amount of dough, and how much oil you want), and sprinkle topping on the dough.

This allows there to be more broth to accommodate all the yummy toppings like avocado, cheese, tortilla chips, or you will be stuck with a thick stew. I also like to bake my own tortilla strips. Set oven to 425 F, take a few corn tortillas, quarter them, then cut into thin 1/4 inch strips. Toss them in a mixing bowl with olive oil and salt. Spread onto a baking sheet without overlapping and bake in two 10 min increments, stirring in between. Bake them until realllly brown so they are extra crisp. So good!!!"

Most recipes call for heating to a temperature of 254o F on a candy thermometer. Or, you can test the level of \"chewiness\" by putting a small amount of the mixture in the ice water. It will harden to a chewy consistency that varies depending on how long you cook it. I used that method and it took about 40 minutes of cooking time to achieve the consistency I was looking for. When the mixture has reached your preferred hardness, remove the pan from the burner and stir in the vanilla. Pour the hot mixture onto the baking pan and level it evenly.

      "Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and set a bowl of ice water on the side. Score an X on the bottoms of the tomatoes. Boil them for 5 seconds, or until the skins loosen on the bottom. Strain and peel under cold running water; set aside.",
      "In a 5-quart (4.7L) braising pan over medium-high heat, melt the butter with the oil. Season the chicken on all sides with salt and pepper.",

      "Reduce the heat to medium and add the shallots and onions to the pan. Cook, stirring, until the shallots are soft. Add the tomato paste and flour and cook, stirring, for another minute. Add the vinegar, bring to a simmer, then stir in the chicken stock. Bring to a simmer, making sure to scrape the bottom of the pan. Return the chicken to the pan with half of the tomatoes and the tarragon. Cover and simmer for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the remaining tomatoes, cover, and simmer for another 20 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through.",
      "For the Rice Pilaf, rinse the rice with cold water until it runs clear. Heat the olive oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the shallot and cook, stirring, until translucent. Add the rice and stir to coat. Add the butter, chicken stock, salt, bay leaf, thyme and tarragon and bring to a simmer. Cover and cook undisturbed over low heat for 10 to 15 minutes. Turn off the heat and rest, covered, for 5 minutes. Remove the lid and fluff the rice with a fork.",
      "For the Yellow Wax Bean Fricassee, bring a large saucepan of salted water to a boil. Add the beans and boil for 4 minutes or until tender. Strain, return the beans to the pan over medium-low heat, and toss with the butter. Season with salt and pepper and toss in the tarragon leaves just before serving."
