Use your finger to make a hollow depression in the center of each cookie so it looks like a little nest. Bake for about 5 minutes, just until the coconut tips begins to color, rotating the pans from top to bottom and from front to back halfway through the baking time to ensure even baking. Lower the temperature to 325\u00b0F and bake for 10 to 15 minutes, again rotating the pans from top to bottom and front to back halfway through the baking time, until the cookies are a beautiful cream and gold with deeper brown edges. If the coconut tips are browning too fast, you can lower the heat to 300\u00b0F.",
      "Slide the cookies on the parchment onto cooling racks. Cool completely before removing them from the paper. (They can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for 4 to 5 days, or frozen for up to 3 months.)",
      "To fill and dip the macaroons: Beat the chilled ganache just until the color lightens and the mixture becomes stiff enough to hold its shape-if you overbeat the ganache, it will have a granular texture. Scrape the ganache into the pastry bag. Pipe a 1-inch-high kiss-shaped mound (about 1 tablespoon of ganache) into each macaroon \"nest.\" Refrigerate until well chilled, at least 1 hour.",

Stir until the chocolate is nearly melted, then remove from the heat and continue to stir until the chocolate is completely smooth. Wipe the moisture from the bottom of the bowl and transfer the chocolate to a very small bowl or cup. If necessary, let the chocolate cool to about 105\u00b0F. Hold a macaroon upside down and dip only the ganache kiss into the chocolate. Then turn the macaroon right side up, hold it over the bowl, and use a fork to drizzle a little chocolate around the edges. Set the macaroon on a tray. Repeat until all of the macaroons are dipped. Refrigerate to set the chocolate.",
      "For dipping, you can use the same chocolate you use in the ganache, or any other chocolate. You can use an even higher percentage chocolate than called for, but be sure you taste it first so you know what you are getting into.",
      "place the chopped chocolate in a medium bowl. Heat the cream in a large heavy saucepan over medium-high heat until it comes to a gentle boil. Immediately pour the hot cream over the chocolate and stir until the chocolate is mostly melted. Let stand for 15 to 20 minutes to be sure all of the chocolate particles are completely melted.",
      "Stir the ganache until it looks perfectly smooth and free of unmelted speaks of chocolate. Let cool. Cover the bowl and refrigerate the ganache for at least 6 hours (I usually leave it overnight); it must be very cold or it will curdle when it is whipped. (The ganache can be prepared up to 4 days ahead.)",
      "When you are ready to use the ganache (and not before), whip it until it is stiff enough to hold a nice shape and seems spreadable, but don't overdo. Overwhipped ganache looks granular, so watch it carefully: I usually stop the mixer early and finish the whipping by hand. After whipping, the ganache will firm as it sits (and even more after it is chilled), so spread it immediately. If you accidentally overwhip, or if the ganache becomes too stiff to spread, warm your spatula by rinsing it under hot tap water and wiping it dry as necessary. (The warm spatula rescued me when I overwhipped ganache for three hundred during the Tribute Cake adventure-so don't worry.)",
      "Unlike most ganache, this one is whipped to a light, almost fluffy texture. High-percentage chocolates are superb here, but the ratio of chocolate to cream must be decreased, or the ganache will be too dense. To use a higher-percentage chocolate, adjust the recipe as follows. (At each level the flavor is less sweet but the texture is still light.)",
      "To use 60% to 64% chocolate: Use 7 ounces (200 grams) chocolate and increase the cream to 21/4 cups.",
      "To use 66% to 72% chocolate: Use 6 ounces (170 grams) chocolate, increase the cream to 2 1/4 cups, and add at least 4 teaspoons (17 grams), or up to 3 tablespoons (38 grams), sugar to the cream before heating it. Alter the technique slightly: pour half of the hot cream and sugar over the chocolate first and stir until smooth before adding the rest. (Without added sugar, the flavor of the ganache is a bit flat. The minimal 4 teaspoons sugar lifts and opens up the flavor-the way salt lifts the flavor of savory food-without adding perceptible sweetness. You can taste and adjust the sugar before chilling the ganache.)"

      "Combine all of the ingredients in the bowl of your stand mixer. Knead with the dough hook until the dough is elastic. It won't be completely smooth because of the bits of cheese, but that's fine.",
      "This would also work really well in the food processor, and the dough would be a bit smoother since the processor blade would do a better job of integrating the cheese. If you use the food processor, put all the ingredients except the water into the processor bowl, pulse a few times, then leave the processor running and add the water slowly, as fast as the flour can absorb it. Once the dough forms a ball, let it process another 30 seconds or so, then check for elasticity.",
      "Leave the dough in the stand mixer bowl (or, if you used the food processor, transfer it to a clean bowl) and cover with plastic wrap. Set aside for an hour.",
      "Preheat the oven to 250 degrees and have 2 baking sheets and parchment paper ready.",
      "Divide the dough in half, and roll each half into a thin rectangle (it doesn't have to be perfect) about 14x17 inches. Place the dough on the parchment sheets and dock it (use a dough docker or stab it with a fork all over) to keep it from puffing too much when it bakes.",
      "With a pastry cutter, pizza cutter, or similar tool, cut the dough into roughly 1-inch squares. It's fine if they're not even, and you don't need to separate the pieces completely - the crackers will shrink apart a bit as they bake and will break apart at the cuts easily once they're crisp.",
      "Slide the parchment sheets with the dough onto the baking sheets. Bake at 250 degrees for 30 minutes. The crackers should be beginning to brown just a little bit. Rotate the pans if they are browning unevenly.",
      "Turn the oven off, and leave the crackers in the oven for another 30-60 minutes. They will continue to brown a little and become crisp and dry, but watch them carefully - if your oven retains heat really well, you risk browning them too much. If that's the case, you can crack the oven door open a bit to let some of the heat out.",
      "They will continue to dry as they cool, but you want them mostly dry before you remove them from the oven - they should be crisp and not squishy.",
      "Remove them from the oven and let them cool completely before storing them. I like to leave them out in the air for at least a day to make sure they're completely dry and crisp. It's also easier to snack on them that way."

A cake made with dutch-processed cocoa powder will be darker than one made with natural cocoa powder. This step is important because of the xanthan gum present. You want the xanthan gum to be evenly distributed throughout the dry ingredients before you add the wet ingredients. This will prevent the xanthan gum from clumping.",
      "Add wet ingredients. Mix until a smooth batter forms. You want the batter to be thoroughly mixed. No pockets of dry ingredients should remain. The final batter will have a slightly thick consistency.",

      "Once the cakes come out of the oven, allow them to cool in the pan for about 5 minutes and then turn them out onto a wire rack to cool. This allows steam to escape from the cake and prevents a gummy cake. The cake might sink just a little in the center as it cools. This is normal and allows for more icing! Mmmm....more icing.

      "Wipe the meat with a damp cloth. Heat a skillet, grease lightly with oil or lard, and add the beef, searing well on all sides until well browned. Place the seared meat in a heavy pot or pan. Wipe the skillet out and then add a tablespoon of butter and put in the onions. Stir the onions until they are pretty well browned.",
      "Sprinkle the meat over with fresh ground black pepper, then add the browned onions, allspice, and bay leaf. Cover closely and see that the pan is good and hot before placing it in the oven. Set into a preheated 400\u00b0F oven until the meat begins to cook. Turn the oven to 225\u00b0F and leave to cook undisturbed for 2 1/2 hours.",
      "When finished, remove the meat and press the onions through a sieve. Add to pan drippings and season this sauce with salt and pepper to taste. Serve hot with the beef.",
      "I used a larger brisket and increased the amount of onions. She notes that",
      "I seasoned the meat generously with kosher salt and pepper before browning, and I browned each side for about eight minutes. I sliced my onions about 1/4 inch thick and cooked them until they were a pale caramel color, not truly brown. Instead of using a separate skillet for browning, as she suggests, I browned the meat in a large Dutch oven, removed it to a board while I cooked the onions, and then returned the meat to the pot, scooping most of the onions up and over it. I didn't see why I should get two things dirty, especially when that might mean losing some cooked-on meat and onion juices. I was not sure how to tell when the meat had started cooking in the oven, so I left it at 400\u00b0F for 15 minutes and then turned the oven down and let it go three hours more, which seemed to work out well."

Butter the shiny side of a piece of aluminum foil (or use nonstick foil), fit the foil, buttered side down, tightly against the crust and fill with dried beans or rice. Put the pie plate on a baking sheet and bake the crust for 25 minutes. Carefully remove the foil and weights and, if the crust has puffed, press it down with the side of a spoon (or lightly prick the crust). Return the pie to the oven and bake for about 8 minutes more, or until the crust is very lightly colored. Transfer the pie plate to a rack and cool to room temperature before filling."

      "Warm the vegetable oil in a large Dutch oven or other heavy-bottomed pot placed over medium heat. Season the pieces of meat with a little salt and pepper and add them to the pot. Brown for 3 to 4 minutes, then turn the pieces to brown the other side, another 3 to 4 minutes. Continue to brown the meat until it is nicely seared all over. Remove the pieces to a deep plate or bowl. Set the pot aside.",
      "Pass the tomatoes through a food mill fitted with the disk with the smallest holes. Discard the solids. Set the milled tomatoes aside.",
      "Return the pot to medium heat and add the extra-virgin olive oil. Stir in the onion, reduce the heat to medium-low, and saute for about 5 minutes, or until the onion is shiny and beginning to soften. Pour in the tomatoes, raise the heat to medium-high, and bring to a simmer. Return the meat to the pot and reduce the heat to medium-low or low to maintain a gentle simmer. Cover partially and let the sauce simmer, stirring it from time to time, for about 3 hours, or until the meat is very tender and the sauce is thickened. Add a splash or two of water if the sauce thickens too much before the meat is done. Taste and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper, if you like.",
      "Turn off the heat. Remove the meat from the pot before using the sauce.",
      "To mix the dough in the food processor: Put 2 cups \"00\" flour, the 1 tbsp semolina flour, salt, and nutmeg into the work bowl and pulse briefly to combine. Break the eggs into the work bowl and drizzle in 1 tbsp of the olive oil. Process the mixture until it forms crumbs that look like small curds. Pinch together a bit of the mixture and roll it around. It should form a soft ball. If the mixture seems dry, drizzle in the remaining 1 tbsp oil and pulse briefly. If it seems too wet and sticky, add additional flour, 1 tbsp at a time, and pulse briefly.",
      "Turn the mixture out onto a clean work surface sprinkled lightly with semolina flour and press it together with your hands to form a rough ball. Knead the dough: Using the palm of your hand, push the dough gently but firmly away from you, and then fold it over toward you. Rotate the dough a quarter turn, and repeat the pushing and folding motion. Continue kneading for several minutes until the dough is smooth and silky. Form it into a ball and wrap it tightly in plastic wrap. Let the dough rest at room temperature for 30 minutes before stretching it.",
      "To mix the dough by hand: Combine 2 1/4 cups \"00\" flour, the 1 tbsp semolina flour, salt, and nutmeg on a clean work surface and pile into a mound. Make a well in the center of the mound, and break the eggs into it. Drizzle 1 tbsp of the olive oil into the well. With a fork, break the egg yolks and whisk together the eggs and oil. Using the fork, gradually draw the flour from the inside wall of the well into the egg mixture until it has a batterlike consistency. Work carefully so that you don't break the wall of flour, causing the egg mixture to run out and things to get messy. (If this happens, don't panic; just use your palms to scoop up the egg mixture and work it back into the flour.)",
      "Now, use your hands to draw the remaining wall of flour over the thickened egg mixture and begin to mix it and knead it. Using the palm of your hand, push the dough gently but firmly away from you, and then fold it over toward you. Rotate the dough a quarter turn, and repeat the pushing and folding motion. Use a dough scraper to dislodge any bits stuck to the work surface. The dough will begin as a shaggy mass but will eventually turn smooth as you knead it over several minutes. You may not use all of the flour on the work surface. When the dough is smooth and silky, form it into a ball and wrap it tightly in plastic wrap. Let it rest at room temperature for 30 minutes before stretching it.",
      "Set up your pasta machine with the rollers on the widest setting (#1 on my standard Marcato Atlas machine). Scatter a little semolina flour on the work surface around the machine and have more on hand for sprinkling on the dough.",
      "Cut the dough into four equal pieces, and rewrap three pieces. Knead the remaining piece briefly on the work surface. Then, using a rolling pin or patting it with the heel of your hand, form the dough into an oval 3 to 4 in long and about 3 in wide. Feed the dough through the rollers of the pasta machine, and then lay the strip on the work surface. Fold the dough into thirds, like folding a business letter, sprinkle with a little semolina, and pass it through the rollers again.",
      "Repeat the folding and rolling process a few more times, until the strip of dough is smooth. Move the roller setting to the next narrower notch and feed the strip of dough through the setting twice, sprinkling it with a little semolina each time to keep it from sticking and then moving the notch to the next setting. Continue to pass the dough through the rollers twice on each setting, until you have stretched it to the appropriate thickness. This will depend on which cut you are making, so be sure to read carefully the individual recipes and instructions for cutting the various shapes. Most recipes, including those for ravioli and lasagne, call for stretching the dough very thin-about 1/16 in-though some cuts require a thicker sheet. On my machine, passing the dough through the second-narrowest roller setting (#6) produces a very thin pasta sheet, so I usually don't stretch past that setting.",
      "Once you have stretched your piece of dough (it will be a fairly long ribbon, depending on how thin you have stretched it), lay it out on a semolina-dusted surface and cover it lightly with plastic wrap while you stretch the remaining 3 pieces.",
      "Put the veal, salt, nutmeg, and egg in a bowl and mix together thoroughly (I use my hands). With your fingers, pinch off a very small piece of the mixture and roll it into a tiny ball-not much larger than a chickpea. Place the meatball on a clean tray or platter. Repeat until you have rolled all of the veal mixture into meatballs.",
      "Pour the vegetable oil to a depth of 1/4 in in a frying pan, place over medium-high heat, and heat to 375\u00b0F on a deep-frying thermometer. If you don't have a thermometer, carefully drop a meatball into the hot oil; if it sizzles on contact, the oil is ready. Place a platter lined with a double layer of paper towels or a large, plain brown-paper bag near the stove.",
      "Carefully add the meatballs to the hot oil, working in batches to avoid crowding the pan. Fry them, turning them from time to time with a spatula, slotted spoon, or even a fork, for about 4 minutes, or until they are lightly browned. Use a slotted spoon or a skimmer to remove the meatballs to the prepared platter. Repeat until all the meatballs are fried.",
      "Transfer the meatballs to the pot with the ragu. Return the sauce to a simmer over medium-low heat, then reduce the heat to low, cover, and keep the sauce at a very low simmer while you cook the pasta.",
      "Bring a very large pot or a stockpot of water to a rolling boil and salt generously. Carefully drop each maccheroni \"nest\" into the boiling water and stir to separate the strands. Cover the pot until the water returns to a boil, then uncover and cook for just a couple of minutes, or until very al dente. Taste a strand to make sure it is slightly undercooked. Drain the pasta in a colander set in the sink, reserving about 1 cup of the cooking water.",
      "Return the drained pasta to the pot and spoon about two-thirds of the sauce over it. Gently toss the pasta and sauce to combine thoroughly, adding a splash or two of the cooking water if necessary to loosen the sauce. Transfer the dressed pasta to a warmed serving bowl or shallow individual bowls and spoon the remaining sauce over the top. Sprinkle with a little Parmigiano and serve immediately. Pass additional cheese at the table, along with a small bowl of chiles."

Add the egg, vegetable oil, and salt to the well and carefully beat together with a fork without incorporating the flour. Continue stirring with a wooden spoon, adding small amounts of the warm water, and gradually incorporating the flour. Only add the next bit of water when the last has been thoroughly blended with the flour and the mixture has become dry. Once the dough has begun to form, lose the spoon and knead the dough with your hands. Stop adding water once all the flour has been incorporated and a soft dough has formed (it should not feel wet or sticky-if it does, add a little more flour).",
      "Grab a kitchen timer and set it for 8 minutes. Continue to knead the dough until the timer goes off, dusting the work surface with flour as needed to keep the dough from sticking. It should be smooth and elastic. Invert a bowl over the dough and let it rest at room temperature for 1 hour.",

Place one carrot round (if using) on the bottom of each siu mai, add a little bit of the minced carrot on top, and transfer to a plate. Continue wrapping the remaining siu mai. The siu mai can be frozen now (see note) or cooked; note that frozen siu mai are best made without the carrot rounds on the bottom.",

Steam until the dough on the tops of the buns has turned translucent rather than opaque white, about 8 minutes. If there is still liquid remaining in the pan, uncover and continue to cook until it evaporates and buns are crisp. Serve immediately."

Gently fold in the chocolate chips with a wooden spoon, stirring only until incorporated. Let the dough rest in the refrigerator for two hours. Using floured hands, press the cookie dough very firmly into a well-greased 10-inch pie plate, ensuring that it is of an even thickness and goes all the way up the sides of the plate. It works best to make the crust fairly thick, perhaps half and inch, so that it doesn't get too crispy. There will probably be some extra cookie dough after you press the crust; feel free to use the dough to bake as cookies.",

Gradually stir in evaporated milk, until the entire mixture is fully incorporated and homogeneous. Pour directly into the cookie dough crust. It should fill the crust to the very top--be very careful when putting it in the oven to prevent spilling.",

Reduce temperature to 325 and bake for for 20-30 minutes or until pick inserted near center comes out clean (it's ok if it is a bit longer, just make sure the middle has set). The sides of the crust will be crispy and a bit darker than you'd probably bake a cookie. It is OK though--the pumpkin filling will soften it a bit. Cool on wire rack for at least 1 hour so the filling can set. Top with whipped cream before serving."

Whisk the eggs, then whisk in the juice, ginger and cornstarch.",
      "Set the bowl over the pan and start stirring with the whisk as soon as the mixture feels tepid to the touch. Cook the lime cream until it reaches 180 degrees F. As whisk-you must whisk constantly to keep the eggs from scrambling-you'll see that the cream will start out light and foamy, then the bubbles will get bigger, and then, as it gets closer to 180 degrees F, it will start to thicken and the whisk will leave tracks. Heads up at this point-the tracks mean the cream is almost ready. Don't stop whisking or checking the temperature, and have patience-depending on how much heat you're giving the cream, getting it to the temperature can take as long as 10 minutes.",

Don't overdo the mixing-what you're aiming for is to have some pieces the size of fat green peas and others the size of barley. Pulsing the machine on and off, gradually add about 3 tablespoons of water-all a little water and pulse once, add some more water, pulse again and keep going that way. Then use a few long pulses to get the water into the flour. If; after a dozen or so pulses, the dough doesn't look evenly moistened or form soft curds, pulse in as much of the remaining water as necessary, or even a few drops more, to get a dough that will stick together when pinched. Big pieces of butter are fine. Scrape the dough out of the work bowl and onto a work surface.",

If you are rolling between paper, plastic or in a slipcover, make sure to turn the dough over often and to lift the paper, plastic or cover frequently so that it doesn't roll into the dough and form creases.",

Alternatively, you can finish the crust by pressing it with the tines of a fork.",

      "Butter the shiny side of a piece of aluminum foil, fit the foil, buttered side down, tightly against the crust and fill with dried beans or rice or pie weights. Put the pit plate on a baking sheet and bake the crust for 25 minutes. Carefully remove the foil and wights and, if the crust has puffed, press it down gently with the back of a spoon. For a partially baked crust, return the pie plate to the oven and bake for about 8 minutes more, or until the crust is very lightly colored. To fully bake the crust, bake until golden brown, about another 10 minutes. Transfer the pie plate to a rack and cool to room temperature before filling."

Arrange the onion wedges, tomatillos, and serranos on a baking sheet and broil until the tomatillos are soft and browned, 15 to 20 minutes, turning with tongs halfway through cooking. Transfer the onion, tomatillos, and serranos with any of their liquid to a blender or food processor, add the stock, and puree until smooth, about 3 minutes. Add 1/2 teaspoon salt and the sugar and pulse a few times to combine.",

Toss the artichokes and quinoa with two-thirds of the Monterey Jack in a bowl. Place a tortilla on the work surface. Spoon 2 to 3 tablespoons of the artichoke mixture down the middle of the tortilla, add some cilantro leaves, and roll up the tortilla, leaving the ends open. Tuck the enchilada, seam-side down, into the prepared baking dish. Repeat with the remaining tortillas and artichoke filling, lining up the enchiladas side by side in the baking dish. Broil until the tortillas are crisp and golden around the edges, 3 to 4 minutes.",

If all you can find is marinated artichokes, drain your artichokes and pat dry, and skip the step of seasoning the artichokes before filling your enchiladas."

Now make sure your hands are completely dry and cleaned of residual sticky rice.

Divide the mochi into 2-inch balls, rolling each around in a thin layer of starch.",

Flatten the ball of mochi and place a teaspoonful of filling in the center. Gather the ends of the circle together and roll again to form a ball with the enclosed filling. Eat as is, or proceed with toasting. In this form, the mochi can be kept underneath a wet towel for 10 to 12 hours. If you intend to the toast the mochi later, the rounds of rice can be stored for 24 hours.",
      "Heat a heavy skillet or pan. Place each round of mochi onto the pan. You may either leave the mochi in its spherical form or use a spatula to flatten the mochi. Toast the bottoms of the mochi until they are golden brown, taking care not to move or disturb the balls as they cook. If the mochi is prematurely moved, the surface will not have time to harden and the balls will stick to the pan. Continue to toast the mochi on all sides.",

Holding your knife at an angle to the surface of your cutting board, score each slice in two perpendicular directions, being careful not to cut all the way through, with cuts about 1/4 inch apart.

Place the packets on a baking sheet and bake for 20 minutes. If you are using parchment paper, it will turn quite brown; don't be concerned.",

      "Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0. Spread the hazelnuts in a glass pie plate and toast for about 8 minutes, until lightly golden and fragrant; let cool. Transfer the nuts to a mini food processor and coarsely grind. Pour the ground nuts into a medium bowl and add the graham cracker crumbs, sugar and butter; mix until evenly moistened. Press the crumbs over the bottom and up the side of the pie plate in an even layer. Bake the crust for 8 minutes, until barely set. Transfer the pie plate to a rack to cool.",
      "In a large, heavy saucepan, combine the sugar and water and bring to a boil over moderately high heat, gently swirling the pan until the sugar dissolves. Cook over moderate heat, undisturbed, until a deep-amber caramel forms, about 8 minutes. Remove from the heat. Carefully add 1 cup of the milk, then cook over moderately low heat, whisking gently, until smooth, about 5 minutes.",
      "In a small glass bowl, combine 1/4 cup of the milk with the vanilla; sprinkle the gelatin on top and let stand until softened. In a large glass measuring cup, whisk the remaining 2 3/4 cups milk with the cornstarch and kosher salt. Pour the milk mixture into the caramel and bring to a boil over moderately high heat, whisking constantly until thickened, about 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and whisk in the egg yolks, one at a time. Return the mixture to a boil and cook until thickened once again, about 5 minutes. Whisk in the gelatin mixture.",
      "With a rubber spatula, gently spread the caramel pudding in the cooled crust. Tap the pie plate gently on a work surface to settle the pudding. Press a piece of plastic wrap directly on the surface of the pie and refrigerate overnight.",
      "Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper and coat with vegetable spray. In a small, heavy saucepan, bring the sugar, water and corn syrup to a boil over moderately high heat. Lower the heat to moderate and simmer undisturbed until a deep-amber caramel forms, about 5 minutes. Remove the caramel from the heat and stir in the salt and rice cereal. Scrape the caramelized cereal onto the prepared baking sheet and let cool for 30 minutes, until it is hardened.",
      "Break the crispy rice into shards; transfer to a sturdy plastic bag. Using a rolling pin, crush the topping into small pieces.",
      "Spread the whipped cream on top of the chilled pie, making deep swirls. Top the pie with the crispy rice and serve.",
      "The rice topping can be stored in an airtight container for up to 3 days. The pie can be refrigerated for up to 6 hours."

Prick the pastry all over with a fork and refrigerate.",
      "Place 3/4 cup of brown sugar in a small saucepan and cover with 1/4 cup of water. Gently stir with a spoon to make sure all of the sugar is wet (it should have the consistency of wet sand), place a cover on slightly askew, and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Keep the mixture covered until the syrup is clear and producing syrupy-looking medium-size bubbles, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove the cover and continue to cook until the sugar is a light butterscotch color (darker if you're using brown sugar) and its temperature reaches 320\u00b0F. Turn off the heat (the sugar will continue to cook in the pan even though the heat is off). Once the temperature reaches 350\u00b0F (this will take only a few minutes), whisk in the butter, one piece at a time, waiting until each addition is completely incorporated before adding the next. Stir in the vanilla and the salt, and pour the caramel into a 10-inch cast iron skillet (if you don't have a cast iron skillet, you can pour it into a pie plate; you might need to bake it for a few minutes longer).",
      "Cover the caramel with the sliced potatoes, starting in the center and overlapping in a spiraling outward circle as you go. Top with the puff pastry circle. Beat the egg and the milk together and brush over the pastry, and then sprinkle with the remaining 1 tablespoon of sugar. Bake until the edges are deep amber and the pastry is puffed and golden, 40 to 45 minutes. Remove from the oven and cool for 10 minutes before inverting onto a large plate (make sure the diameter of the plate is larger than 10 inches!). Slice into wedges and serve with or without ice cream and whatever other garnish you'd like (pecans or almonds work very nicely)."

You want to spread it as flat and evenly as possible, so that the top layer of chocolate will lay fairly flat on top.

When ready to serve, remove from the refrigerator and let come to close to room temperature before slicing into bars; if you cut while the mixture is still cold, the top layer can crack.

      "In addition to a starter culture, you will need a starter tea to brew kombucha. For your first batch, this can be store-bought kombucha tea, or a starter tea obtained from a kombucha brewing friend. In a pinch, you can substitute vinegar. Then, every time you make kombucha, reserve a small amount (about 1/2 cup) of finished fermented tea mixed with an equal part of distilled white vinegar. This liquid is called \"starter tea.\" Pour it over the kombucha starter culture (\"mother\") and store in the refrigerator.",
      "Rinse out a medium stainless-steel sauce pan with distilled white vinegar. Add the water to the pan and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. As soon as the water boils, add the sugar and stir to dissolve. Remove from the heat, add the tea bags, cover, and let sit for 20 minutes. Rinse a slotted spoon with vinegar and use it to remove the tea bags from the pot.",
      "Rinse a large (at least 1 1/2 quart) glass jar with distilled white vinegar. Pour the sweet tea into the glass jar and let cool to room temperature, about 2 hours.",
      "Stir the starter tea into the sweet tea and add the starter culture (\"mother\"). Cover the jar with a coffee filter, cheesecloth, or other material that will keep out debris but allow air to circulate. Secure with a rubber band. Set in a warm, dark place to ferment for 8 to 12 days (a spot in the basement near a water heater works well).",
      "As the kombucha ferments a new starter culture (called a \"baby\") will form on the surface, while the mother will either float beneath it or sink to the bottom of the jar. Strings may extend between the two cultures. When the new baby is almost as big as its mother, it's time to taste-test the kombucha. Stick a straw partway into the liquid, cover the end still in the air with a finger, and withdraw the straw from the liquid, thereby removing a dropperful. Taste the kombucha that you've captured in the straw. If it is refreshingly tart, it's ready. If not, let the kombucha ferment longer.",
      "When the kombucha is fully fermented, preserve the starter culture and starter tea for your next batch of kombucha. Rinse your hands with distilled vinegar, and then lift the mother and baby into a clean glass bowl or glass jar that has been rinsed with vinegar. Pour 1/2 cup of the unfiltered kombucha over the culture, and add the 1/2 cup distilled white vinegar. This liquid is starter tea. Cover tightly and store in the refrigerator for up to 1 to 2 months. (If you're using a jar for storage instead and it has a metal lid, cover the jar with a layer of plastic wrap first, before putting on the lid, to keep the contents from coming into contact with metal.)",
      "Filter the remaining kombucha through a damp coffee filter or several layers of damp cheesecloth into a clean glass jar. Stir in the orange juice and seal the jar with a plastic or plastic-wrap-lined lid. Let sit at room temperature for 2 to 4 days, until the kombucha is bubbly, and then chill for 24 hours. Serve over ice."

Continue to knead for another 3 minutes, remembering to dust your board when necessary. Wrap the dough in plastic and allow to rest for 30 minutes at room temperature. Note: do not skip the kneading or resting portion of this recipe, they are essential for a light pasta."

      "Transfer the wings from the roasting pan to a stock pot. Add 1 cup of water to the roasting pan and scrape up any brown bits with a wooden spoon. Pour the water and brown bits to a stockpot. Add enough water to cover the wings and simmer for 3 1/2 hours, adding more water if needed to keep chicken wings submerged. (Alternatively, simmer the wings in a pressure cooker at full pressure for 1 1/2 hours.)",
      "Add the onion, garlic, and bell pepper to the stock and simmer an additional 30 minutes. Strain the stock and reduce further or add more water until the yield is 5 cups.",
      "Add the chicken fat to a 6-quart Dutch oven or similar heavy-bottomed, oven-safe pot and heat over medium-high until the fat shimmers. Season chicken thighs with salt and sear, skin side down, until golden brown, about 4 minutes. Flip chicken and sear on other side until browned, about 4 minutes longer. Transfer chicken to a plate and set aside. Drain any excess fat from pot and lower heat to medium.",
      "Add diced onion and minced garlic to pot and cook, scraping up any browned bits from the chicken, until translucent and tender, about 5 minutes. Add aji panca or cayenne, cumin, paprika, oregano, and black pepper and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.",
      "Increase heat to high, then add chicken wing stock, diced potato, and raisins and bring to a simmer. Season with salt. Return chicken thighs to pot along with any accumulated juices. Reduce heat to low. Cover and gently simmer until chicken has cooked through, about 30 minutes.",
      "Remove the stew from heat and set aside until the chicken is cool enough to handle, about 1 hour (The chicken should be left to cool in the stew so that it doesn't dry out.) Using your hands, pick the meat from the chicken thighs and break into small pieces, discarding the skin and bones. Stir peas and picked chicken meat into the stew and refrigerate until the stew has solidified, about 4 hours, preferably overnight, and up to 3 days in advance.",
      "In a 2-quart saucepan, combine butter and annatto and melt to infuse the butter with color.",
      "In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, salt, and sugar. Pour the melted butter into the flour mixture and, using your hands, mix until thoroughly combined and sandy. Add 3/4 cup (177mL) hot water to the flour mixture and mix until the dough comes together into a smooth ball.",
      "Divide the dough into 9 equal portions (about 100 grams each). Fold each portion of dough onto itself until it becomes smooth and pat into a disk. Cover with plastic wrap.",
      "Work with one portion of dough at a time, keeping the remaining pieces covered. Lightly dust your work surface with flour. Using a rolling pin, roll out one portion of dough into an 8-inch round about 1/8-inch thick. Loosen the dough from the work surface with an offset spatula.",
      "Add 1/9 (about 1 generous cup) of the chilled chicken stew to the center of the dough. Top it with a quarter of a hardboiled egg and two black olive halves. Brush the edges of the dough with egg white. Join the edges of the dough together over the filling. Press the edges together to encase the filling into a large football with a seam running across the top. Crimp the edges and transfer the saltena to a parchment-lined rimmed baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining dough and filling. Freeze the formed saltenas before baking at least 1 hour and up to 3 months in advance. (If freezing long-term, once the saltenas are fully frozen, wrap each in plastic and transfer to a zip lock freezer bag to prevent freezer burn.)",
      "If the saltenas have been frozen for only 1 hour, preheat your oven to 500\u00b0F (260\u00b0C). If the saltenas have been frozen solid for 4 hours or more, preheat your oven to 450\u00b0F (232\u00b0C). Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment and spray lightly with cooking spray. Line the tray with the frozen saltenas. (Do not bake on the chilled baking sheet the saltenas were frozen on or the bottom of the pastry will not brown.) Brush the pastries with egg white and bake until the seam is blackened and the crust is golden brown, 15-20 minutes. Serve immediately."
