This step is not necessary, it just adds a richer color to the dish.",
      "Roast the chicken for 20 minutes.",
      "While the chicken is roasting, use a food processor and puree the tomatoes with the red pepper flakes and onions until only slightly chunky. Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a pan over medium high and add the tomato mixture to the oil. Simmer for about 10 minutes. Season with 1 teaspoon kosher salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper.",
      "In a small bowl blend together the lemon juice, yogurt, Dijon, Worcestershire sauce, garlic, 2 tablespoons of olive oil and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Toss with the romaine lettuce.",

    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "For the cake:",
      "1. Preheat the oven to 350 F (180 C or 160 C for a fan oven).",
      "2. Line a 12-hole cupcake tin or muffin tin with paper liners.",
      "3. Prep your strawberries. Set aside 6 or 7 medium-sized strawberries for decoration at the end. Remove the green stems and finely chop the remaining strawberries. Set aside a heaping 1/2 cup of the chopped strawberries. These will be mixed directly into the cake batter later.",
      "4. Make a strawberry puree with the rest of the chopped strawberries. Use a blender, food processor or hand blender to puree the strawberries to liquid. Combine the pureed strawberries, the strawberry jam and a splash of water in a small saucepan. Heat the mixture over medium high heat, stirring occasionally, until the jam has melted and the mixture is smooth. This should take about 3 to 4 minutes. You will have about a cup of finished strawberry puree. You will need 1/3 of a cup for the cake batter and 1/2 cup for the frosting. Set the mixture aside to cool to room temperature.",
      "5. Whip the cream. I usually do this by hand since it's such a small amount. You want to whip it to the soft peak stage. Transfer to the fridge until you're ready to use it.",
      "6. Combine the flour, baking soda, baking powder and salt together in a medium bowl. Whisk for about 30 seconds until thoroughly combined. Set aside.",
      "7. Use a hand mixer or a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment to beat the butter on medium speed for about 3 minutes.",
      "8. Add the granulated sugar and beat on medium speed until very light, about 2 minutes.",
      "9. Scrape down the bowl and beat in oil, followed by the eggs and then the vanilla.",
      "10. Scrape down the bowl again, set the mixer to a low speed and gradually add half the flour mixture, then add 1/3 cup of the strawberry puree, followed by the remaining half of the flour.",
      "11. Fold in the whipped cream gently by hand, followed by the reserved chopped strawberries.",
      "12. Fill the cupcake liners with a medium-sized ice cream scoop (approximately 2 inches wide). The cupcake liners should be about 2/3 full, which will leave enough room for the cupcakes to rise.",
      "13. Bake cupcakes for 15 to 19 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the middle of a cupcake comes out clean. I start checking at 15 minutes, then return the cupcakes to the oven to bake for another two minutes at a time until they are done.",
      "14. Cool the cupcakes in the pan for 10 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.",
      "For the frosting:",
      "1. Use a hand mixer or a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment to beat the butter on medium speed for 2 to 3 minutes or until creamy and smooth.",
      "2. Add the icing sugar, salt (I use fine sea salt), vanilla, whipping cream and the reserved strawberry puree.",
      "3. Start mixing on low speed to combine the ingredients, then gradually increase to high speed. The mixture may look slightly curdled. Don't worry, just keep beating on high speed until you have a smooth, creamy frosting. This will take 3 to 4 minutes.",
      "4. If the mixture is too thin, add more icing sugar. If it seems too thick, add a bit more cream.",
      "5. Frost the cupcakes using any method you like. I used a piping bag with a large open tip to create big swirls.",
      "6. Decorate the top of the frosted cupcakes with sliced strawberries.",
      "7. Cupcakes may be stored for up to 3 days in an airtight container."

However, if you plan on having leftovers or if you prefer a frozen pie I would recommend putting this in the freezer. I tried some in both the fridge and the freezer and personally I liked the freezer better. The fridge left it nice and creamy, but it kept much better in the freezer.",

Then you will just have the thick cream remaining in the can. Add the thick cream to a chilled bowl and beat the cream until it is nice and airy. Add the 2 tablespoons of powdered sugar and beat until it's just combined. Spread over the top of the lime pie and sprinkle the top with the remaining grated coconut. Place back into the freezer or refrigerator and chill at least 6 hours or until set."

    "title": "patriotic red velvet cheesecakes",
    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "1. The cheesecake layer needs to chill the longest, so I made that first. It's my same recipe I used for my classic New York cheesecake, it's to die for! It is loosely adapted from Emeril Lagasse's recipe. Preheat the oven to 350 F and liberally spray a 9 1/2 inch spring form pan with cooking spray. You could also use a 10 inch pan if you have that instead but a 9 inch pan will make the cheesecake layer just too thick for the assembly. In the bowl of a stand mixer combine the cream cheese, sugar, vanilla and salt and beat that all together thoroughly with the paddle attachment until fluffy. Slowly add in the eggs and egg yolks one at a time, letting each one get beaten in before adding the next one. Then add in the Greek yogurt and lastly, the flour. The Greek yogurt is my little secret, it just gives the cake the perfect consistency and tang.",
      "2. Pour the cheesecake batter into the prepared pan and smooth it out with a spatula. Let the cheesecake bake for an hour, take it out of the oven and let it cool for at least 10 minutes before you release it from the pan. Then let it cool completely before you gently wrap the cheesecake in plastic and get it in the refrigerator.",
      "3. Next, prepare the two red velvet layers which will end up sandwiching the cheesecake. My red velvet recipe is adapted from Alton Brown's recipe, I've done quite a bit of testing and tweaking to make it my own! Preheat the oven to 325 F (or just turn it down to 325 F after you take the cheesecake out). Line two 9 inch cake pans with parchment paper circles and spray the pans with cooking spray. In a bowl, whisk together the two flours, cocoa powder, baking soda and salt. In another bowl, whisk together the milk, red food coloring, white vinegar and vanilla. You will need to wash out your stand mixer bowl and paddle attachment from the cheesecake. In the clean bowl of the stand mixer, combine the sugar and butter and beat them together until fluffy. Then beat in the eggs. Slowly add in 1/3 of the dry ingredients, followed by 1/3 of the wet mixture. Repeat two more times, ending with the wet mixture and you will have a gorgeous batter! Divide the batter evenly between the two cake pans. Bake the red velvet cakes for 30-35 minutes, until a toothpick comes out of the center clean.",
      "4. Take them out of the oven and let them cool for a few minutes, then turn them out carefully onto a plate to finish cooling. Wrap the layers in plastic and store them in the refrigerator. Chilling the layers will make them easier to cut later! Also, as a side note, try not to wear anything you care too much about when you make red velvet. I have learned the hard way how hard it is to get splattered food coloring off of my clothes in the past!",
      "5. The last component is the easy cream cheese frosting for the top. You will need to once again quickly wash out your stand mixer bowl and paddle attachment. Combine the cream cheese, butter, vanilla and salt in the clean stand mixer bowl and beat it all together thoroughly with the paddle attachment until creamy and fluffy. Then slowly add in the powdered sugar with the speed on the lowest setting so that you don't end up having a snow storm in your kitchen. Cover the bowl in plastic and let the frosting chill in the refrigerator.",
      "6. After everything has chilled overnight, the red velvet cheesecakes are ready to assemble! Using a 4 inch round cookie or biscuit cutter, cut out 4 circles from the first red velvet layer and lay them on a platter or cake plate. Then cut another 4 circles out of the cheesecake layer and set them carefully on top of the red velvet circles. Cut another 4 circles out of the second red velvet layer and gently layer them on top of the cheesecake layers. Spoon a big dollop of the cream cheese frosting on top and smooth it out a little with an offset spatula. Then take a handful of blueberries and sprinkle them evenly into the frosting. Voila! You have a show stopping dessert!",
      "Now, I know you're asking \"what about the scraps\". No need to waste them! Crumble them up into layers in a big trifle bowl with the rest of the frosting and more blueberries on top to have extra dessert in addition to the 4 red velvet cheesecakes. These are just incredible, let me tell you. The blueberries give that needed burst of freshness and acidity to cut through the richness of the cake. The 4th of the July has never been so delicious and decadent!"

    "title": "potato & cheddar cheese perogies",
    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "For the filling:",
      "Peel the potatoes and cut each one into small pieces. Place the potatoes in a large pot and add enough water to cover the potatoes. Bring the potatoes to a rapid boil, reduce heat and cook until they are fork tender. Depending on the size of the cubes, this will take 10-20 minutes. Drain the potatoes, cover and set aside.",
      "While the potatoes are boiling, heat a large skillet over medium heat and melt the butter. Then add the onions and saute them in the butter over medium heat until they are translucent. Reduce the heat to low, add the garlic, and continue to saute until the onions are lightly caramelized, about 10 minutes.",
      "To the drained potatoes, add the onions, shredded cheddar cheese, Cheez Whiz or Velveeta cheese, salt and pepper. Use a potato masher or electric mixer to mix all of the ingredients until they are smooth. Add more salt and pepper to taste, if needed. Cover and refrigerate until cooled.",
      "For the perogy dough:",
      "Add the milk and water to a microwave safe bowl. Microwave for 1 minute or until the liquid is warm but not hot. Add the cubed butter to the warm liquid and stir until it is melted. Set aside.",
      "In the bowl of a stand mixer, fitted with the dough hook attachment, add the flour, baking powder and salt. With the mixer on low speed, slowly pour the milk mixture into the flour until it is completely incorporated. Continue to mix for 1 minute. The dough will be quite sticky.",
      "Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead lightly (4 or 5 turns) until it forms a ball. The dough will be very soft but the small addition of flour should mean that it is no longer as sticky. Use the mixing bowl, overturned, to cover the dough and let it rest for 10 minutes.",
      "To assemble the perogies:",
      "Divide the dough into quarters and work with only one piece at a time, leaving the other pieces covered. Use a rolling pin to roll the dough on a lightly floured surface, turning as needed to ensure that the dough does not stick. Roll the dough until it is about 1/8\" thick.",
      "Cut circles into the dough using a 2-1/2\" round cookie cutter or the mouth of a glass. Ensure that you cut your circles as close together as possible because the perogy dough will be tough if you try to re-roll it. Throw away any scrap pieces of dough. (Or you can do what we used to do as kids when we would get Grandma to boil the dough scraps and eat them with butter and salt. Yum!)",
      "Place about 1-1/2 teaspoons of the filling into the center of the circle. I like to use a 1 ounce ice cream style scoop to ensure consistency, but a spoon can be just as effective. Gently fold the dough over the filling and use your fingers to pinch the edges closed, being careful not to get any of the potato filling in the pinched seam or your perogy will open when boiled.",
      "Place the completed perogies on a flour dusted, linen tea towel. Cover the exposed perogies lightly with another tea towel and continue until all of the filling and dough is used.",
      "Preparation (to freeze and/or serve):",
      "Perogies can be frozen, uncooked, at this point by freezing them in a single layer on lightly floured baking sheets. Once frozen, transfer the perogies to freezer bags in batches of one dozen per bag. The perogies could then be boiled and served as needed.",
      "You can also precook your perogies and serve and/or freeze them as follows.",
      "In a small pot, combine the butter and diced onion. Cook gently over medium heat for 15 minutes or until the butter has clarified and the onions are translucent. Reduce the heat to low and simmer for an additional 15 minutes.",
      "Fill a large pot with water and bring to a rapid boil over high heat. Drop the perogies, one dozen at a time, into the boiling water. The perogies will cook and float to the surface of the water when they are almost done. Continue to boil for an additional 30 seconds once they have risen to the surface. Use a slotted spoon to remove the perogies from the water and place them in a bowl. Spoon about 2-3 tablespoons of onions and butter over the perogies and gently stir until they are coated.",
      "You can serve immediately with additional sauteed onions, sour cream, jam, or garlic cream dill sauce. (Yes, my family eats perogies with jam! Don't knock it until you've tried it. It's really good.)",
      "To freeze the cooked perogies: Gently toss a dozen of the perogies with the onions and butter as above, then place into a freezer bag, in a single layer if possible, seal and freeze.",
      "To serve the pre-cooked, frozen perogies:",
      "Option 1: Place the frozen perogies in a covered, oven-proof dish with 1-2 tablespoons of butter and some diced onions and bake them for 30 minutes at 350 F, stirring as needed to ensure that they don't stick to the bottom of the dish.",
      "Option 2 (as shown in pictures): Place the frozen perogies directly into a frying pan with a little butter and pan fry them over medium high heat until golden brown, turning once. Serve with additional sauteed onions, sour cream, jam, or garlic cream dill sauce.",
      "This recipe will make about 10 dozen perogies, depending on the size of perogy that you make."

Once you get them started, hold each end in each hand, lift the log from the counter and twirl it in front of you (jump rope-style) until the twists meet the butter and the log is tight. Put the log in the fridge for at least two hours to firm.",

Stir the mixture constantly with a wooden spoon, being sure to scrape the corners of the pan with the spoon.

It shouldn't be pure liquid or completely set. Once it's done baking, turn the oven off and let it sit for at least an hour (more if you have the time). After about an hour or so, I open the oven door and let it sit for a few more hours. This option gives me the best results. I've never had it crack.",

      "B. Stick your pan into the 350F oven and bake for an hour. Turn off the oven and let it sit for an hour or so. Open the oven door, and continue to let it cool for a few more hours. If you choose this option, I suggest using a water bath. You will need to wrap the bottom of your pan with aluminum foil (the more layers of aluminum foil the better), and stick it into a roasting pan. Then pour hot water almost halfway up your Springform pan. It will help the cheesecake cook evenly. I've cooked it this way a few times (minus the water bath) and it's cracked every time. The taste is still delicious, just not as pretty. I've heard bad stories of soggy crusts, so I haven't tried the water bath method yet. I just stick to option A, and I get wonderful results.",

I actually used lemon flavor Perrier and it was just dandy. Give your drink a taste - you can add more syrup if you want it sweeter. Add some ice, a straw, a little mint for garnish and sip away! If you like your drinks slushy, simply whirl the cherry syrup with about 1/2 cup of ice in a blender. Add the sparkling water, give it a stir and enjoy!",

To insure this, one should be sipping a very dry Gibson during the preparation and the cooking.\"",

      "The dough keeps for about 3 days in the fridge in a Ziploc bag and rolls out just fine straight from the fridge, but you can bring it to room temperature if you like or if your dough feels too stiff.",
      "For the dough:",
      "Whisk the flour, baking soda and salt together in a large bowl; make a well in the center and pour in the water and oil. Stir with a fork or wooden spoon until a rough ball forms, then knead gently for a minute with your hands right in the bowl. Cover the bowl and let the dough rest for about 15 minutes to an hour.",
      "For tortillas:",
      "Divide into 8 to 14 balls, depending on how thick and or big you want your tortillas. For a very thin 10-inch tortilla, you need about a 1 1/4 inch in diameter ball of dough.",
      "Heat a heavy-bottomed frying pan or griddle on high heat for about 1 to 5 minutes (depending on how thick your pan is), until a little splash of water evaporates upon contact. I find that a cast iron pan works best, but a cheap old nonstick fry pan works good, too. You just need to be very careful not to get it too hot.",
      "On a well-floured surface, roll out the ball of dough until very thin. The dough should be really elastic. I like to roll it to about 3/4 the size I want and then stretch it the rest of the way in my hands to get a better feel for the thinness I want.",
      "Place the tortilla in the preheated pan and cook for about 1 minute per side, or until bubbled with dark brown spots. You can gently press the tortillas with a flipper to brown it more evenly. Use immediately or stack covered with foil or a kitchen towel until ready to serve.",
      "For chapattis (you will need a gas or propane stovetop for the charring, or a gas or charcoal grill):",
      "Divide dough into 6 or 7 pieces, shape into balls and one at a time roll to about an 1/8-inch thickness for a fairly thick chapatti. Heat a heavy-bottomed frying pan or griddle on high heat for a couple minutes, and turn on another burner to medium. Quickly cook the chapatti on both sides until just cooked but not yet browned. Flip it onto the open burner with kitchen tongs, cook on both sides for a few seconds until covered with black and brown spots and very puffed, then serve immediately. You can also cook them on the grill by throwing them on the cool side for a couple minutes per side and then quickly charring them on the hot side."

      "Cut beef into bite-sized, 1-inch chunks (if you purchased meat that was already cut, make sure chunks are small enough).",
      "In a large (at least 5-quart) Dutch oven or pot, melt 2 tablespoons of the butter over medium heat. Once bubbling a little and just darkening, add half the beef and sprinkle with salt and pepper (about 1/4 teaspoon each) before stirring. Increase heat slightly to keep temperature up, and stir occasionally. The beef will emit liquid, then it will evaporate and the meat will turn darker brown. Don't worry about overcooking the beef at this stage-the red wine, acidic tomatoes, and slow cooking later will tenderize it. Once browned moderately (around 10 minutes total), carefully remove it to a heat-proof bowl.",
      "Decrease heat to medium, add the last tablespoon of butter and allow it to melt. Then add the remaining beef and a bit more salt and pepper and repeat the above process. Remove cooked meat to the bowl and set aside.",
      "With heat at medium high, add the carrots and onions and a little more salt and pepper. Brown bits will stick to the pan at this point, which is fine. Turn down the heat a little if it becomes unmanageable and smells burnt. Cook about 5 minutes, until softened. Reduce heat to medium, add flour, and stir gently to coat the vegetables until you can't see white powdery flour anymore. This will help thicken the stew as it cooks.",
      "Add the wine (it will sizzle and cause the brown, flavorful crust to release from the pan), stock, tomatoes, and rosemary (if using). Stir to incorporate, then slowly add the meat back to the pan, to avoid splashing.",
      "Increase heat to high to bring to a boil, then reduce to a gentle simmer (medium-low or medium) and partially cover the pot. Cook for 50 minutes. Stir every 10 to 15 minutes, scraping the bottom of the pot to ensure the flour and vegetables aren't sticking.",
      "While the stew cooks, peel and cut the potatoes into bite-sized chunks. Add them to the pot after 50 minutes. Continue to simmer, this time fully covered, for another 40 minutes or until the potatoes are easily pierced with a fork. Again, stir frequently to avoid sticking.",
      "Add the peas and simmer uncovered for another 5 to 10 minutes, until peas are thawed and warm. Stir in the parsley and remove pot from heat. Let it stand for 5 minutes off heat, then season to taste with salt and pepper. Serve with sour cream and a side of bread, or on its own.",

    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "Oh boy oh boy. I have leftovers of this soup for lunch today and I'm so excited. Equally excited that I get to share this with you. This soup is so simple yet still one of the most warming, flavourful soups I've ever had. I may or may not have had four bowls of it for dinner last night. You can't prove anything!!",
      "The beauty of this is, even though I've written quantities for everything, it's all totally a matter of taste. Or in my case, it's entirely dependent on how much of any given thing I fancy and happen to have in the kitchen.",
      "Anyway. Start with peeling and cubing two large white potatoes. Really I just use the standard \"white\" that you get at the supermarket, as it's going to get blended up in a bit anyway. But you can use whatever potatoes you have sitting around.",
      "Dice up two large white/yellow onions as well. Then put the onions and potatoes into a pan and cover with just about enough water to cook them nicely, without being overly watery. We're going to use this cooking water, and while it's possible to add more water later, it's not so easy to remove once you've blended the whole shebang. You can add some salt to the water too, if that's what floats your boat. Stick the pan on a medium-high heat with the lid on.",
      "While the onions and potatoes are cooking away, slice up the mushrooms. My dear ol' Mumma V just uses plain closed-cup mushrooms in hers, but I like to be a rebellious wild-child, so I use a combination of closed-cup, chestnut and mini-portabella in mine. Mostly because these are easily available and not too expensive. I guess you could add something even more exotic but it might feel like a bit of a waste in a huge vat of soup.",
      "As an aside, I, like Ree, also rinse all my mushrooms, and for this I don't even bother patting them dry or any of that nonsense. The whole thing behind not rinsing mushrooms, is that they are like natures fungal sponges (spungals, if you will - but that sounds weird). Mushrooms already contain a lot of water and rinsing them only adds to that, and anyone who's tried to fry mushrooms knows you have to let all that liquid cook out before they're ready. But in this soup, obviously, that doesn't matter.",
      "Set the sliced mushrooms aside and slice up the leeks. Mmm, leeks. Slice 'em up fairly thin now.",
      "Ok, let's check our boiling potato/onion situation. Are the potatoes fork-tender? Awesome. Take the pan off the heat, and don't drain that water! Crank out your hand-blender and whizz the whole lot in the pan until it's smooth. Doesn't have to be totally smooth - if you want a more rustic feel you can leave some lumpy bits. In fact, if you want to go down that route, or if you don't have a hand-blender, use a potato masher instead to mash up the ingredients in the pan.",
      "Once you've got it to the consistency you want, stick the pan back on medium heat and add the chicken stock. Once it all starts boiling again, throw in the mushrooms. You might be alarmed at the sheer quantity of mushrooms, but they reduce in size drastically. Let this cook for about five minutes, then throw the leeks in.",
      "Just writing this up is making me anticipate my lunch something crazy. And I just had two slices of toast. What is wrong with me?!",
      "Ok, after another ten minutes or so, check on the soup. It'll look a little dull but it's ok. If the mushrooms and leeks are cooked, it's time to add the finishing touches.",
      "First, take two tablespoons of flour and add it to just a little water, enough to stir the flour up into a reasonably lump-free paste. Add this to the soup and let it cook for one to two minutes to thicken it.",
      "Now folks, it's time to get serious. Time to make peace with whatever dietary deity you worship (dietary deity, try saying that three times fast). Time to remove the pan from the heat, and add 1/2 to 1 cup of double cream. How much you add is a matter of taste/guilt. Stir it all up real nice. Mmm... Season with salt and pepper - keep tasting all the while you're adding the salt, as this recipe, between the potatoes and mushrooms, really needs quite a bit of salt. But over-salt it and it's a disaster.",
      "Now just serve that bad boy up in whatever fancy soup bowls you like - in my case, it is the biggest receptacle of any kind that I own.",
      "I hope you enjoy this as much as I do! Shame I don't have any photos but I was too busy eating the dang stuff to take any last night."

I popped all of mine out of their individual wrappers into a heavy zippy bag and placed them on a paper plate on the floor and proceeded to smash them to smithereens with a hammer. The paper plate is good; do not forsake the paper plate, it will save you from cleaning powdered candy off your floor. Now, sift the candy with a mesh sieve to get rid of all the powder.

A food processor could work, or you can just use a mortar and pestle. I used Chad's spice/coffee grinder. It's awesome. Grind up 1 Tablespoon of lavender in the grinder. The remaining 2 pinches will be left whole.",
      "Mix together all dry ingredients for the shortbread in a bowl. Add the butter and blend in with a pastry blender (alternatively, you can do all of this in a food processor). It should resemble coarse meal. Now put the dough in a 9x13 pan and press down firmly with your fingers. You want the dough to be even and well pressed. Bake for 20 minutes at 350.",
      "Meanwhile, zest and juice two lemons. You'll probably have more than a 1/2 C of juice but you can use that for salad dressing or lemon-pepper chicken. Or stick it in the fridge. By the way, do you have lots of fun zesting things? I do. I love it. And I love my microplane zester. It's delightful and yellow and I got it on sale. Wonderful.",
      "Now for the topping. Mix the eggs and sugar until completely combined. Next add the lemon juice and zest and mix well. When the shortbread has baked, pour the topping mixture over the hot shortbread (this is important-don't let the shortbread cool) and sprinkle on a few lavender flowers. Bake for another 20 minutes (still at 350).",
      "When they are cooled (don't you hate letting things cool), carefully cut the lemon bars into squares (or plain-old rectangles) and place on a cooling rack. I put paper towels under mine for easy clean up, but you can just wipe the counter instead. Now dust the tops with powdered sugar and arrange on a pretty plate.",
      "Oh my goodness. These are easily the best lemon bars I've ever had. The lavender adds a perfectly light, floral aroma and complements the tart lemon. What amazed me most was the yummy shortbread bottom. Usually I'm not a shortbread person but this had just the right texture and floral flavor. And oftentimes lemon bar crusts are super buttery to the point of being greasy, but not these. Please make these. It gives you an excuse to buy lavender and guys, it's cheap and makes everything smell awesome. Just do it."

Remove from heat, drain, and pat dry. Toss in a small splash of olive oil and sea salt, and then roast at approximately 325\u00b0F for 10 minutes or until they have a nice crunch."

Don't skip this step or your biscuits won't be light and fluffy but will instead be quite dense.",

      "Preheat oven to 425 F. Cut each tomato into quarters, then remove the white core. Use your fingers to scoop out seeds. Place tomatoes on a rimmed baking sheet, cut side up, and sprinkle with kosher salt. Add 1/4 cup of the water to the pan and cover with foil. Carefully move pan to oven and bake for 20 minutes. Remove from oven and rest for 10 minutes, covered in foil, while you prepare the other ingredients.",

      "In a large pot, heat enough olive oil to cover the bottom of the pan. Heat over medium high heat. Add the onion and cook until just beginning to brown, stirring occasionally. Add garlic and cook for another couple minutes, allowing it to fry and darken slightly. Stir in the red pepper flakes and tomato paste, and cook for a couple minutes, until the paste is incorporated.",
      "Add wine and simmer until mostly reduced. Add tomatoes and the water from the tray, mushrooms, tomato sauce, 1 cup of water and dried basil. Bring to a low boil, then reduce heat to a simmer and cover until mushrooms have softened to the point that they're edible, about 15 minutes. Remove lid and continue simmering until sauce is over 50% reduced. It should be thick with very little water left and starting to stick to the bottom of the pan between stirring. Mine took about 2 1/2 hours. Season with salt and black pepper if needed (check first-the mushrooms and wine add a lot of flavor). Use immediately, store in the refrigerator for a couple days, or freeze until needed.",
      "Notes:",
      "1. Recipe yields about 8 cups sauce.",
      "2. Use any type of tomato or mushrooms you like. I used standard, on-the-vine tomatoes and white button mushrooms, which are most cost-effective.",
      "3. Use any wine you would be comfortable drinking, as long as it's not too sweet. To omit the wine, add an additional 1/2 cup water and 1 to 2 tablespoons of sweetener (e.g., white or brown sugar or honey; use less if using maple syrup or agave) when you add the mushrooms"

      "For the cupcakes:",
      "While the eggs are cold, separate and reserve whites. Adjust the quantity of eggs if needed to reach 3/4 cups of whites. It's very important that the whites are completely free of yolk and shell, or they may not \"fluff\" when beating later. Cover the bowl of egg whites and bring to room temperature (around 70 F) which will take around 11/2 to 2 hours.",
      "While egg temperature rises, measure flour and powdered sugar, then sift them together with the salt. Measure cream of tartar, sugar, and vanilla each into separate bowls so they're ready to add to the mixer while it's running. Have a 12-count non-stick cupcake pan ready (see note below regarding pan prep).",
      "When the egg whites are ready, preheat the oven to 350 F and add egg whites into a completely clean metal or glass bowl of a stand mixer with the whisk attachment. Whisk on medium low speed (40%) until frothy, about 2 minutes. With the mixer running, add cream of tartar, increase speed 1 \"notch\" (60%) and beat until soft peaks form, about 3 minutes. You should turn off the mixer to check this when the eggs look close, to make sure you don't over-beat them into stiff peaks. After confirming, resume beating at medium low speed (40%), adding a tablespoon of sugar about every 30 seconds. Beat another minute after adding the last of the sugar, then check for only slightly stiffer peaks. They should not be completely stiff. The process of adding sugar and beating for an additional minute took me 4 minutes. Egg temperature will impact mixing times, so watch for the signs indicated, even if it takes a minute or two longer to get there.",
      "Gently drizzle vanilla over surface of the egg mixture and beat on low speed until just incorporated. In four batches, sprinkle the dry ingredient mixture over the surface of the batter and use a rubber spatula to gently fold in by hand until incorporated smoothly. Be patient with the folding-it's necessary to keep the air pockets.",
      "Use a spring ice cream scoop or one third cup measure to evenly distribute batter into the 12 cupcake wells. Bake for 18 to 20 minutes, until tops are golden and spring back slightly when touched. Don't open the oven until you suspect the cakes are close to being done. Remove from oven when done.",
      "If using an unlined non-stick pan, cool the cupcakes upside down, with the pan carefully propped at each corner on a can or other level items. Remove cupcakes from pan once cooled. If you are not using liners, slide a small paring knife around the outside of each cupcake to loosen it. I also used a large spoon to gently scoop the cupcake out of the well.",
      "Once cooled completely, frost or wrap individually in plastic wrap.",
      "For the icing:",
      "Place white chocolate in a completely dry glass bowl set over a saucepan of water (water shouldn't touch bottom of bowl). Heat over medium (to eventually simmer the water), stirring more frequently with a rubber or silicone heat-safe spatula as chocolate begins to melt. When almost completely melted, remove bowl to a towel or potholder, being careful not to get any water in the chocolate. Continue stirring until fully melted, then allow to cool while you start the icing.",
      "In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, or in a bowl using a hand mixer, beat butter at medium high speed until lightened and creamy, a minute or two. Scrape down sides of bowl as needed. Beat in vanilla until incorporated.",
      "Add powdered sugar a little at a time, reducing mixer speed to low when initially adding the sugar, so it doesn't fly everywhere. Increase speed to fully incorporate, then repeat the process until all the sugar is added. Scrape down sides of bowl as needed.",
      "With the mixer running on low speed, constantly drizzle in the melted, cooled white chocolate until fully incorporated. Don't turn up the speed on the mixer; the goal is to stir in the chocolate. Add milk or cream and beat on low speed, to soften the frosting slightly. If you prefer a more liquid consistency, add more milk a teaspoon at a time.",
      "Work with the frosting immediately, frosting the cupcakes by hand or using a bag and frosting/decorating tip. Alternately, refrigerate icing in airtight container, then bring almost to room temperature before using, to soften the frosting. Decorate cupcakes with sprinkles of your choice!",
      "Notes:",
      "1. When baking such a delicate recipe, precision is key, which is why I took to weight measurements for some dry ingredients. I got my kitchen scale for $15 at Costco, and it's one of my most used kitchen appliances-very much worth the small investment.",
      "2. Angel food cupcakes don't stay fluffy for long. When making these for company, bake them a day in advance at most. Wrap individually in plastic wrap and store in an airtight container.",
      "3. You can microwave white chocolate, but I find it's very prone to burning, so I prefer the double boiler method. I don't use an actual double boiler-just a glass bowl set over a saucepan.",
      "4. I've never had a problem using room temperature eggs or egg whites; however, be advised that this may be contrary to the most conservative food safety precautions.",
      "5. I tested baking both in an un-greased, non-stick cupcake pan and in paper liners. I was happy with both results. The cakes baked right in the pan have a traditional cupcake shape, while those baked in paper sucked the wrapper sides up so they were completely vertical, with no issues of the cake sticking to the liner. Use either method, but so not use a greased pan-it may result in flat cupcakes."

Salt and regular ground pepper can be added to taste, but is not necessary for this chili. Mix all ingredients together to get the partygoers introduced and mingled properly.",

      "Keep in mind this recipe is made to fit a large crock pot, about six quarts. If you have a smaller crock pot, halve the recipe to fit.",
      "To make this chili Vegetarian, either substitute tofu for the turkey, add coarsely chopped carrots or other veggies as preferred, or leave out the meat altogether for a simple bean chili. If you are a meat lover, you can also use ground beef, ground chicken, chopped chicken breast, chopped steak, pulled chicken/turkey/pork/beef roast ... whatever you like! This recipe is great for using up leftovers, so see what you have and throw it in if it looks good."

Remove the dough from the bowl, wipe bowl clean and apply vegetable oil to the bowl. Then add the dough back into the bowl and turn to coat the dough with oil.",
      "Cover with plastic wrap and let it rise in a warm place for about an hour. I usually place it in my warming drawer on proof or in a preheated oven that has been turned off. The ideal temperature for rising should be between 80F and 90F (again, oven should be off). It should at least double in size.",
      "Once it's risen, remove dough from the turned off oven. Next, preheat your oven to 450 F and line two baking sheets with parchment paper. Now it is time to form your dough into your desired shape. I needed longer, slightly curved rolls to go with the German Oktoberfest bratwurst I was serving on them. You could also make round rolls or pretzel shapes. They are amazingly tasty in any form!",
      "Place the dough on an oiled surface. Cut the dough into eight fairly equal pieces. Roll each piece into a rope using your hands. You will need them to be about two feet long. For the long rolls, I fold the rope into equal halves and overlap the sides like a braid and then stick both ends to each other and press together firmly.",
      "Place the hot water into a wide microwaveable bowl large enough to dip pretzel rolls into. Microwave the bowl of water until water begins to boil. Carefully remove from microwave and add the baking soda. Stir to dissolve.",
      "One by one, dip each pretzel into the baking soda solution for approximately 20 seconds. Remove to a parchment covered baking sheet and immediately sprinkle with sea salt.",
      "Bake in the 450 F oven for 8-10 minutes until golden brown. Remove from oven.",
      "Once you remove them from the oven transfer to a cooling rack to keep moisture from softening the bottoms. At this point they may look a little dry and it's OK. This is where the butter comes in. You don't need much, just enough to glaze the tops of the pretzels. Some of the salt may fall off during this process, so feel free to sprinkle on a little more if you like.",
      "If you can stand to wait 10-15 minutes before eating them, the butter will completely absorb into the pretzels.",
      "Note: An alternative to the butter, should you not wish to add the extra fat or calories would be an egg wash made by beating one egg with 2 tablespoons of water. Brush this on and then sprinkle with sea salt before baking. It will leave your pretzel rolls golden and shiny."

      "Cook bacon ahead of time and lay on paper towels to drain excess fat. Crumble into small pieces.",
      "Trim spinach ends, if needed. Baby spinach is usually fine the way it is. Wash and dry spinach. Set aside.",
      "Pour maple syrup and crumbled bacon into a small saucepan. Heat on low to let bacon flavor infuse into the syrup. Stir when needed; do not burn.",
      "While heating syrup, you can toast your walnuts under the broiler on a piece of tinfoil or baking sheet. Just check on them every couple of minutes, because they burn easily. You can also broil them on low, or toast in a 350\u00b0F oven for about 10 minutes. Once toasted, crush into pieces. I do this right in my hand, but be careful-they're hot!",
      "Now for the fun part. Cut the chevre log into 1/4-1/2\" thick medallions over a piece of tinfoil. Cutting with a knife might cause the cheese to crumble, so I use a piece of fishing line (monofilament) pulled taught by wrapping around two fingers. It will slice right through the soft cheese. Lay the medallions side by side on the tinfoil. Place under the broiler until tops are golden brown (about 5-10 minutes). While these are broiling, I usually quickly assemble my salad. Toss the spinach with the walnuts. Drizzle the maple with bacon pieces over the spinach.",
      "When the medallions come out from the broiler, let them stand for about 5 minutes. They might be bubbly and give off a little moisture. Once they are set, you can slide them right off the tinfoil with a small spatula, onto the salad. Give the salad a shot or two of a creamy dressing to give it a little lube, such as bacon ranch (preferred), ranch or Caesar. Gently toss.",
      "I try to orchestrate the warm walnuts with the warm goat cheese while trying to keep the maple/bacon dressing warm till just ready to serve. It's heavenly served warm. You will hear the spinach making a slight \"crackling\" noise when it makes contact with the other warm ingredients. Yum.",
      "I also gave some general rules of thumb for ingredient proportions, but I usually just do it by sight. It depends on what I have available, a small goat cheese log or a large one. You can use less or more walnuts or more or less bacon slices, as well as maple syrup. Play around and enjoy!"

I don't know about you, but I definitely don't have that kind of time, and I'm not leaving my stove-top on while I'm sleeping. What I do is throw all of the bones from a leftover turkey into a large stockpot, fill it 2 inches from the top with water, and then simmer it for 2-3 hours (be sure not to boil or you will get cloudy broth), adding water as needed if the water level gets low. I then turn off the burner, let it come to room temperature, and plop it into the fridge with the lid on, bones still in, for 24-36 hours. When I'm ready to use the broth it is gelatinous, so I heat it on the stove until it becomes liquid again and then strain the juices through a fine mesh colander, removing the bones. Viola! It's ready to use!",

After you have done this with the first 4 cups, you can turn the burner to medium-high heat, add the remainder of the broth and the water, and then bring it to a gentle boil.",

Add rosemary and allow it to cook until aromatic, about 30 seconds to one minute. Toss in the minced kale and give it a good stir so it's completely coated with the oil. Using your hands or a food processor, mash the polenta. The idea here is that we want stuffing, not solid polenta cakes. Now add the polenta into the kale, and give it another good stir to incorporate everything. Let this cook for 3-5 minutes, reduce heat to medium-low, and add cream and canned tomatoes. Give the mixture another good stir until everything is nicely mixed together and allow it to cook for about 2-3 minutes.",

      "After the dough is warm but no longer hot, start adding an egg at the time under constant beating. Beat on low and increase to medium for a few seconds. One egg should be completely incorporated before adding the next, and your dough should be nice and smooth.",
      "Now this next step is up to your estimation. After the 4th egg has been added and incorporated, you need to check for consistency. The dough should be very smooth and shiny, it should come off the paddle slowly and leave a little peak at the end. If the dough seems too stiff, crack another egg and add a little of the egg white. Do this until you reach the desired consistency.",
      "Now that's done, you can do this two ways. You could place the dough in a piping bag, fitted with a star tip and pipe little mounds onto a silicone or parchment paper lined cookie sheet. Or you could take two spoons to make little balls, or you could use a very small ice cream/cookie scoop.",
      "Whichever way you get them onto your cookie sheet, once you have them on there, place them in the oven and bake for 8-10 minutes for smaller-sized balls, or 12-15 minutes for the cookie-scoop-sized ones. Then turn down the heat to 375 F and bake for another 15-20 minutes, depending on their size.",
      "To test if they are done, they should be a gorgeous golden brown, and feel firm when you gently squeeze the sides. And of course they should have puffed up considerably! But be sure not to check them too early, or they might collapse when you open the oven door!",
      "Once they are done, place on a cookie rack to cool.",
      "Add the remaining 2 tablespoons sugar to 1 cup whipping cream and beat until stiff. Add the whipped cream to a piping bag fitted either with a long narrow filling tip.",
      "Fill each profiterole with whipping cream. If you'd prefer, you could also break the profiteroles in half and pipe the filling inside, then place the lid back on top.",
      "You can now place these little beauties in the freezer, freeze them solid and then transfer them into bags. When you need them, just take a few out, leave them sitting at room temperature for about 15 minutes and they are ready to go.",
      "Or you could make the ganache to dip the tops in to take them over the top.",
      "To make the ganache, place the remaining 1/2 cup of the whipping cream in an oven proof dish and microwave until very hot. Break up the chocolate and pour the hot cream over it, stirring constantly until all the chocolate is melted.",
      "Dip the profiteroles into the chocolate ganache.",
      "You can do that even once they are frozen. It defrosts them faster and sets up the ganache faster, too.",
      "And then enjoy!"

With the mixer running start adding the flour, one cup at a time until the dough comes together and pulls away from the edges of the bowl. Knead for about 3-4 minutes, you want the dough to be smooth and stretchy but a little bit sticky at the same time.",
      "Once it is done kneading, move the dough to a buttered bowl and cover with a clean tea towel and allow to rise until doubled. I like to turn my oven on to the lowest setting, about 200\u00b0F and then turn it off and set the bowl on the top of the oven so it has nice warm cozy place to rise. This should take about 2 hours, unless of course you live at high altitude - if so, mine was ready after an hour.",
      "Once the dough is ready, punch it down and then prepare the topping.",

      "Next take half of the dough and roll out into a rectangle on a lightly floured surface until it's about 1/8\" thick. Then pour half of the melted butter all over the dough and spread evenly around with a pastry brush. Generously sprinkle cinnamon and brown sugar all over and then starting at one long end of the dough, roll it up jelly roll style until it is a nice, neat roll. You will need to get 12 buns out of this one so I usually make a light mark where I want to actually cut to make sure I am making them all about the same size and that I am going to get the right number. After making the marks use a sharp knife to cut them, place each bun in a muffin cup on top of the filling. Repeat with the other half of the dough, and the remaining filling ingredients. Then cover both trays with a clean tea towel and allow to rise until doubled, about 20-30 minutes.",
      "Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F and then bake the buns until lightly golden on top. I usually put a large piece of tin foil on the rack below them in the oven because the topping always overflows and makes a mess in the oven, but with the tin foil there clean up is pretty simple.",
      "Once they are baked, remove from the oven and allow to cool for about 5 minutes in the pan. Then place more tin foil on a clean spot on the counter and invert the pans over the foil. I like to leave the pans there for a couple minutes to let the maximum amount of the topping to pour out over the buns. Then carefully remove the pans - sometimes the buns need a tiny little bit of convincing to come out of the pan, a little tap usually does it. Then stand there and lick the filling out of the pan and thoroughly enjoy yourself for a few brief moments.",

This is a trick my friend taught me-the rice doesn't stick to the bamboo and makes for easy removal once the rice is done. Ladle in the soaked, drained rice and make it level in the basket, then cover tightly and steam over medium-high high for 25 minutes.",
      "If using a regular steamer basket: Line the steamer basket with a triple layer of cheesecloth or a piece of fresh or thawed banana leaf and then ladle the soaked, drained rice on top. The rice layer shouldn't be any thicker than 2\" on top of the cheesecloth or leaf. Cover tightly and steam for 25 minutes.",
      "Halfway through steaming, remove cover and carefully turn the rice 2-3 times to make sure it all steams evenly-the bottom cooks faster than the top. You'll know the rice is cooked when it's \"squeezable\" and translucent (no longer a hard white color) and sticks together in one big lump. Once done, turn the rice lump out onto a large piece of cling wrap or slightly greased plate and cut with a greased knife into 4 chunks. You can then wrap each chunk in cling-wrap or keep inside individual small ziplock bags to keep warm and moist. Traditionally, you eat the rice by pulling off bite-size pieces from your individual \"chunk,\" compress or roll it slightly between your fingers, and then dip it into sauce or pop it into your mouth. Yummy!",
      "Note: \"Sweet\" or \"glutinous\" rice can be found in Thai mini-groceries or at most Asian grocers or supermarkets. It's called sticky rice once it's cooked, like if you order it at a restaurant, but it's called sweet or glutinous rice if you're looking for it (uncooked) at the store. It is NOT the same as any other kind of rice (jasmine, basmati, sushi/Japanese)! I love eating it with Thai green papaya salad and Thai beef jerky. Enjoy!"

(The measurements I gave were approximations, as I never measure when I'm putting things in, so it's whatever your preferences are. The only thing I notice is that you do need to add more oregano than the other herbs to give it that real \"pizza taste.\") Bring to a boil and let simmer for 5-10 minutes so all the flavors meld together.",

      "The process is, honestly, fairly simple. Just a little time consuming.",
      "1) In a medium bowl beat cream cheese, vanilla & powdered sugar until smooth; set aside.",
      "In a separate, microwave safe dish melt butter. Stir in the crushed vanilla wafers (or graham crackers - whatever you fancy) until all are moist. Carefully add buttery crumbs to the cream cheese filling mixture. Place filling in the fridge while you prep the strawberries.",
      "2) Be sure to thoroughly rinse all strawberries. You want the biggest you can find with pretty tops. My green tops were a little sad but workable. Keep the tops attached, you can always remove them later, but for now they will serve as a nice little 'handle.' Pat dry.",
      "3) Carefully cut an X in the bottom of the strawberry, about an inch down. Gently pry the bottom apart. Strawberries have a slight hollow area in the middle & you want to make sure to find it - I kinda stuck my finger or a chopstick down to open the area more. As you work, place them on a waxed paper lined cookie sheet.",
      "4) Now, you can start the stuffing. Slowly add the filling into the strawberry, bit by bit with a spoon. If you have an icing tip with a large opening, piping it in would be easier. Once thoroughly 'stuffed' clean up the outside; it needs to be as smooth as possible. You don't want awkward chunks of wafer sticking out... just wouldn't look pretty with the chocolate.",
      "5) Place stuffed strawberries in the freezer for 10-15 minutes. This allows the filling to harden slightly, so it doesn't get melted by your chocolate.",
      "6) Be very very careful with your chocolate. It is easy to scorch, burn or even worse... make it separate. {shudder!} Melt 1/2 block white chocolate Almond Bark - broken into smallish bits - in a glass measuring cup. Microwave in 45 second increments, stirring each time, until melted & smooth.",
      "7) Holding on to the green top, dunk your strawberry into the melted chocolate. Be careful to leave some pretty red at the top!",
      "8 ) Don't be too trusting with the green top though; it may break on you. So have a fork or toothpicks handy. I used the back of a spoon to smooth out the chocolate & remove any excess. Then place the berry back on waxed paper. The chocolate will begin to set immediately.",
      "9) Next is the really fun part! Decor! Melt one, single square of chocolate (I used a single square out of a package of milk chocolate Almond Bark) and pour into a plastic baggie. Remove the absolute smallest amount of the tip of the bag as possible... if you want small lines of chocolate. Then have fun! I made little tuxedos, tried a girly dress with pearls, added bows- use your imagination! Use the strawberries to spell out \"I\" \"HEART\" \"U\" or your sweethearts name.",
      "10) Once thoroughly decked out, stick the sweet bites back in the fridge to set up completely. Then devour. Eat as many as fast as you can!!"

Return to freezer and scrape approximately every 3 hours. If you can't scrape every 3 hours, it is OK. This granita is forgiving and you can scrape it just before serving. Granita should be ready to eat in about 10 hours (to reduce freezing time, use a larger container to reduce thickness of the granita and scrape the ice more frequently).",

I get mine at Swanson Health Products because it has the best price. Neither product nor vendor is a paid endorsement. If you want to use an alternative sugar substitute, adjust quantity to suit your taste (I have not tried this recipe with any other sugar substitute). I don't recommend using all refined sugar as it requires 1/2 cup to sweeten this recipe. I found that using this amount affects the consistency and freezing point of the granita. It will not crystallize optimally and be somewhat mushy. It will also increase freezer time by at least 50%."

(My kitchen is very friendly to yeast, so this only took about 45 minutes for me, but may take twice as long if your kitchen is cooler or you don't often bake with yeast.)",
      "When the dough has doubled, punch it down and divide into 15 roughly equal-sized pieces. Shape the pieces into round rolls. Place one of the balls of dough into your hand, flatten it, then roll the edges into the center. This will create some tension on the exterior of the dough and make your rolls rise evenly into pretty rounded shapes. Repeat with the rest of the balls of dough.",
      "Place the rolls onto a large baking sheet that has been covered with parchment or lightly oiled. Cover the rolls with plastic wrap and allow to rise until almost double in bulk. When your rolls are getting close to double in bulk, preheat your oven to 350 F.",
      "Place the rolls in the oven and bake for 18 to 22 minutes. They should be golden brown and sound hollow if lightly tapped. Remove from oven and place the baking sheet on a cooling rack and allow the rolls to cool for about 5 to 10 minutes. Then remove the rolls from the sheet to either serve or continue cooling directly on the rack.",

      "Once the cookies have cooled you can drizzle the orange glaze over the cookies. If you don't have a squeeze bottle, dip a fork into the glaze and drizzle it over the cookies. The icing will set up nicely if you let them sit out for about half an hour. Store in an air tight container."

Add the beef cubes to the same pot and let them get perfectly browned on all sides, about 5 minutes. Remove them to the same plate as the shrimp.",

This is where the layers of the stew start to come together. Pour the beef and shrimp back into the pan and add the ras el hanout, coriander, turmeric, smoked paprika, salt, crushed red pepper, tomato paste, quinoa flour and Worcestershire sauce. Stir everything together thoroughly while the tomato paste and flour cook off for a minute.",
      "3. Deglaze the pot with the red wine and allow it to cook off for about 3 minutes. Then add in the beef stock, shrimp stock, diced tomatoes and bay leaves. Bring the stew to a boil, then reduce it to a simmer and let it simmer for 2 hours. When it is done just ladle it into bowls, top with the chopped rosemary and serve immediately with crusty bread!"
