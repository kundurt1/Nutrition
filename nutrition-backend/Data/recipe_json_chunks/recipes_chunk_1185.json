      "To prepare the eggplants: Cut off the stems, remove the skin with a vegetable peeler, and cut lengthwise into 1/2-inch thick slices. Season all the pieces of eggplant with salt and pepper on both sides. Coat a large skillet with oil and heat over medium flame. Fry the eggplant in a single layer, turning once, until brown on both sides- you will need to do this in batches, adding more oil, as necessary. Drain the eggplant as they cook on a paper towel-lined platter.",
      "Add a little more oil to the pan and toss in the onion, garlic, lemon slices, oregano, and parsley. Cook and stir until soft and fragrant, about 3 minutes. Add the ground lamb, stirring to break up the meat; season with salt and pepper, and toss in the cinnamon stick. Stir in the tomato paste and hand-crushed tomatoes. Simmer until the liquid has evaporated, stirring occasionally. Remove from the heat.",
      "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.",
      "Line the bottom of a 9 by 13-inch glass or ceramic baking dish with 1/3 of the eggplant slices; they should completely cover the bottom with no gaps. Spread 1/2 of the meat sauce over the eggplant, evening it out with a spatula. Sprinkle with 1/2 of the feta and Parmesan. Repeat the layers again, ending with a final layer of eggplant. Cover the top with a nice even layer of bread crumbs. Bake the moussaka for 30 to 40 minutes or until the top is golden. Let cool 10 minutes before serving."

      "After the cauliflower is separated you can get the baking sheet and lay down some parchment paper. Once that's done all you need to do is put the cauliflower pieces on to the baking sheet and add 1 tablespooms of coconut oil over the cauliflower. Vegitable oil works just as well. Once the preheat is done you can stick them In the oven for around 15- 20 minute. They should not be Browning all over but it usually does have a few crispy edges on some.",
      "Now while that's in the oven you can make your batter. First put the flour in the bowl. You'll need a larger bowl for this. Make sure all the clumps are broken up and then you can add the seasoning. Now when it comes to the seasoning the measurements you dont have to be exact. If you like spiciness you could add a little more Cajun and the same goes for the rest. Once all the seasoning is added just mix it all together.",
      "Okay so now take a little bit of your mix about 1/4 cup and put it in a separate bowl. Once that's done just add a little water at a time till it's a creamy consistency. You'll know it's perfect if it's thick enough to stick to the fork or wisk but cant be picked up in clumps.",
      "If your cauliflower is done you can take that out and prepare the oil but if not then I recommend waiting until the cauliflower is done to heat your oil. I heated my oil in a pot but if you have a deep fryer that will work too. Once the cauliflower is done you can heat the oil on medium heat and begin rolling the cauliflower in the creamy mix and then into the dry mix. I recommend not coating a lot at a time unless you plan on cooking them all at once. When the cauliflower is in the oil I let them cook for a minute some for two minutes depending on size. If you feel they aren't cooked long enough I recommend an extra minute to avoid a gooey inside.",
      "After they are cooked then you are all done! Let them sit on a paper towel for a few minutes to get rid of excess oil! Hope you enjoy!"

    "ingredients": [],

      "Homemade Greek Seasoning -- You can make a batch of this up and put in a small spice jar. Once you try this, you will always keep some on hand.: 1 1/2 teaspoons dried oregano, 1 teaspoon dried mint, 1 teaspoon dried thyme, 1/2 teaspoon dried basil, 1/2 teaspoon dried minced onion, 1/4 teaspoon dried minced garlic. Options, you can add some lemon pepper, or marjoram, but that is my favorite combination that I use.",
      "Cabbage -- In a large pot, bring salted water up to a boil and add the cabbage. Blanch, or cook the cabbage just until the leaves are tender or no longer stiff and easy to work work. It should take about 3-4 minutes. Now don't get rid of that water, just turn it off for now. Once the cabbage is cool enough to handle remove the outer leaves, the ones that are soft and no longer stiff. As you get in to the smaller leaves they will be stiffer, so heat up the water to a boil and put the cabbage back in to finish blanching the remaining cabbage, just another 2-3 minutes. Once cool, take off the leaves.",
      "Set all the leaves off to the side to cool. And don't worry if they are all different sizes, that is just the way stuffed cabbage is. Each stuffed leaf will be a bit different.",
      "NOTE: Don't throw that water out yet. We use it one more time.",
      "Fish -- Now you can use a variety of methods, but since you already have hot boiling water from the cabbage, why get rid of it. I simply put a steamer basket (or you can use a colander or even a strainer; I have even used a small grate) over the top, cut my fish fillets into 3\" pieces, easier to work with, and add to the steamer basket. Put a lid or foil over the top and just cooked until slightly tender, but not too long. Usually 4-5 minutes is all you need. Remove and let cool.",
      "Couscous -- Now you can use your favorite brand. Simply follow the directions on the package. My method is to bring a bowl of water up to a boil in the microwave. Remove, add the couscous, cover with plastic wrap and you are done. You want approximately 1 1/2 cups cooked couscous, a little more or less is fine. Just set to the side.",
      "Vegetable Filling -- In a medium saute pan, heat to medium high and add the olive oil. Add the peppers, onion, celery, and garlic and cook 3-4 minutes until the vegetables begin to soften and the onion gets opaque. Then add in the scallions, parsley, Greek seasoning and olives and just stir to combine all the flavors. Remove to the side.",
      "Fish filling -- Take you fish and use your fork to flake the fish. I just roughly flake it, it will fall apart as you mix it with the other ingredients. To the couscous, just remove the plastic wrap or fork to \"fluff up.\" Then add the fish, sauteed vegetables, lemon juice and zest, and the egg to the couscous. Mix well. Your filling is done.",
      "Sauce -- The sauce can simmer as you roll your cabbage leaves. In a medium to large pot bring to medium heat and add the olive oil and then the onions and garlic. Cook for just 2-3 minutes until the onions begin to soften. Deglaze the pan with the white wine and then add in the tomatoes and Greek seasoning. Stir well and then add in the artichoke hearts. Just reduce the heat to low and let it simmer.",
      "Rolls -- Now the fun part. Lay out the cabbage leaves and put a good spoon of the couscous mixture to the center of the leaf. I fold one end over (the smaller end), then tuck in the 2 sides, and finish rolling. Just like you would make a sandwich wrap. Secure with a toothpick and you are done.",
      "If you have any filling left, don't throw it out. Save it and reinvent it. Add some feta cheese and fresh tomatoes and serve as a cold salad over a bed of lettuce or stuff in a tomato for a quick healthy lunch or dinner.",
      "Casserole -- I like to bake mine in a large casserole dish, I add all the cabbage leaves and then top with the simmered tomato and artichoke sauce. In a 350 degree oven, cover and bake 30-40 minutes until the cabbage is very tender and all the filling reheats.",
      "Serve -- Make sure to serve 2-3 leaves per person and top with extra tomato sauce and the black olives as a garnish. Some crusty bread and you have a great dinner. I love to start with a bowl of creamy potato soup, I made earlier, so just reheat. It makes a nice Sunday Comfort Food Meal for a cold chilly day."

      "Choose your ingredients carefully, you can make all kinds of different creations just by switching up the kinds of tomatoes, onions, and peppers you use. Yellow tomatoes make a terrible salsa because they don't have the same level of moisture as most types of red tomatoes. I know some people that swear by boiler onions for salsa, they are small, but powerful onions. I recommend Roma tomatoes and a nice big Spanish Yellow onion for your first salsa.",
      "Begin by dicing the tomatoes. If you don't feel like it (lets face it, that's a lot of tomatoes to dice), then you can throw them in a food processor for a few seconds (be careful not to liquefy them, that will not make an appetizing salsa).",
      "Throw about 85% of the tomatoes into a saucepan with your corn oil. Turn the heat up to simmer (very low). Remember to stir this once in a while, but while you are not stirring, try to keep a lid on it.",
      "Next, dice your onion and throw about 85% of that in with the tomatoes and stir. Make sure you set the last 15% of your onion and tomatoes aside for later.",
      "Next, dice up your peppers and throw them all in the pan/pot. You should chop these up a bit smaller than your other ingredients. I highly recommend a food processor for this step, Chipotle peppers can be very tough.",
      "Next, chop up your garlic and throw that in to the pan. Add in the remainder of your spices (Cilantro, Cumin, Salt).",
      "Add the lime juice and Vinegar. Make sure your stir well after this.",
      "Replace your lid and let the salsa simmer for about an hour or so, stir ever once in awhile. After about 30-45 minutes, add in your leftover onion an tomato (the 15% you set aside).",
      "Once you notice the salsa beginning to lose moisture, remove it from heat. It should still be fairly watery at this point, it will set when it cools down.",
      "Transfer your salsa to another container and refrigerate for a few hours. After that, its ready to be served with tortilla chips! Enjoy!"
