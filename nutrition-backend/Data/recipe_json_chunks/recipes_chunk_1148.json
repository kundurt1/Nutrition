NOTE: FOR A QUICKER STOVETOP MARINATION METHOD, PIERCE CHICKEN PIECES WELL WITH A FORK, THEN HEAT THE MARINADE WITH CHICKEN, COVERED, OVER LOW HEAT FOR 20-30 MINUTES (TURN CHICKEN ONCE MIDWAY THROUGH).",

      "Begin by caramelizing a 1-quart souffle dish or a 6-inch-diameter cake pan; In a small heavy-bottomed saucepan, combine 1/2 cup of the sugar, and 3 tablespoons of water. Cook the mixture over medium-high heat until the sugar caramelizes-it will have a rich golden-brown hue. Immediately remove the saucepan from the heat. Working quickly, pour the caramel into the souffle dish or cake pan. Using potholders to protect your hands, tilt the dish in all directions to coat the bottom and about one inch of the adjacent sides. Continue tilting the dish until the caramel has hardened, then set the dish aside.",

In a bowl, whisk together the eggs and the remaining 1/3 cup sugar, then stir in the rum, vanilla, cardamom or cinnamon, banana puree, and the remaining 2 teaspoons of lemon juice. Stirring constantly to avoid curdling the eggs, pour the hot milk into the banana mixture. Transfer the custard to the caramelized dish.",
      "Set the custard dish in a small roasting pan and pour enough hot tap water into the pan to come 1 inch up the sides of the custard dish. Bake the flan until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean-20 to 30 minutes. (Take care not to insert the knife so deep that it pierces the caramel coating.) Remove the flan from the hot-water bath and let it cool to room temperature. Put the flan into the refrigerator until it is chilled- about 3 hours.",
      "To unmold the chilled flan, invert a serving plate over the top of the dish, then turn both over together. The dish should lift away easily; if it does not, turn the dish right side up again and run a small sharp knife around the top of the custard to loosen it. If you like garnish the flan with a ring of banana slices. Cut the flan into wedges and spoon some of the caramel sauce over each one before serving."

Meanwhile, place the egg yolks in the small bowl of your food processor (or in blender) and season with a smidgen of salt and pepper. Blend for one minute. Once the lemon juice/vinegar has come to a simmer turn your processor or blender back on. VERY slowly add the hot liquid in a small stream to the egg yolks while the food processor of blender is running.",
      "Using the same saucepan, melt butter over a VERY gentle heat. Do not allow butter to turn brown.

Clean the bowl with a spatula and add to the sauce and pulse once.",

Adding the egg whites is technically cheating, but it works every time. (Kay also said more garlic can be used to suit taste pref.).",

I used the *Euro Shopper* brand corn oil, Kay's recipe (including the egg whites) + the thin stream addition of the oil method w/excellent results ~ a richly garlic-flavored & thick sauce. I did add some seasoning salt to better match the Icelandic garlic sauce that is sold commercially & very popular to serve w/lamb (& other meats).",
