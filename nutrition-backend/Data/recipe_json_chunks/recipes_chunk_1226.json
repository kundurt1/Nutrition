      "Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Place a large pot of water over high heat and cover. Place a large saute pan with 2 tbsp oil or bacon grease over medium heat. Once oil is hot, add mushrooms to the pan and saute for 7-10 minutes or until fully cooked and slightly caramelized. Toss or stir occasionally. Season with a pinch of Kosher Salt and Black Pepper then deglaze the pan with the Sherry Vinegar. Allow all of the vinegar to cook out, then remove the mushrooms from the pan and set aside.",
      "Now time for the cheese sauce! Add 4 tbsp butter to a medium sauce pan. Place the pan on the stove over medium heat. Once the butter is melted, whisk in 4 tbsp all-purpose flour. Whisk for about 30 seconds, just long enough to lose the raw flour taste but not long enough for the flour to caramelize. Add the thyme, rosemary, sage and red pepper flakes. Continue stirring to allow the herbs to saute for about 30 seconds. Slowly pour in the warm milk while whisking continuously so the roux and milk incorporate smoothly with no lumps. (HINT: Sometimes removing the pot from the heat source while you stir in the milk will help reduce the possibility of lumps forming.) Allow the mixture to come to a low simmer, stirring occasionally, until thickened.",
      "While waiting for the sauce to simmer, start the pasta. Liberally salt the pot of boiling water. The water should taste very salty for best results. Add the pasta to the water and cook for a minute or two less than the suggested time on the pasta package so that the pasta is very firm, because you will be baking it later and you don't want it to get too soft.",
      "Once your sauce has reached simmer, stir in the chevre, cheddar and half (2 oz) of the parmigiano reggiano cheeses. Add truffle oil and slowly stir until the sauce is smooth, with all cheese melted. Remove from heat. Add salt and pepper to taste.",
      "In a small mixing bowl combine remaining parmigiano reggiano and panko.",
      "Remove the pasta from heat and strain immediately making sure it is well drained. Return to empty pot or use a large mixing bowl to toss the pasta, cheese sauce and mushrooms. Place mixture in a deep glass or ceramic loaf pan, spreading evenly. Sprinkle the Panko/cheese mixture over the top, coating evenly. Bake on upper shelf of the oven for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and cheese sauce is bubbly. Remove from oven and allow to sit for 10 minutes, then serve and enjoy the best mac & cheese you'll ever eat!"

      "PRESS-IN TART DOUGH:",
      "Makes one 10-inch crust (or enough dough for 12 tartlets).",
      "DIFFICULTY: Easy.",
      "MAKE AHEAD AND STORAGE: The tightly wrapped dough can be refrigerated for up to 4 days; bring to room temperature before using. Wrapped in plastic wrap and then in aluminum foil, the dough can be frozen for up to 3 months. Thaw overnight in the refrigerator before using.",
      "In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment (or in a large bowl, using a hand mixer), cream the butter and sugar on medium-low speed until smooth, 2 to 3 minutes.",
      "Add the egg yolk and mix on medium speed to combine. Scrape the bowl well. Add the flour, cocoa powder and salt and mix on low speed until fully incorporated, 45 seconds to 1 minute. Add the water and mix just until the dough is smooth, 1 minute more.",
      "Turn out the dough and use your fingers to press it into a 10-inch tart pan (see Pro Tip). Once the sides and bottom of the pan are fully covered, smooth the dough with your fingers to even out any thicker spots. Use a paring knife held flush against the rim of the pan to trim the excess dough, leaving a clean edge. Prick the dough all over with a fork. Freeze for at least 30 minutes and up to overnight.",
      "WHY IT WORKS:",
      "Creaming the butter and sugar for less time than you would for a cookie dough helps keep the crust from puffing up too much in the oven.",
      "PRO TIP:",
      "When pressing the tart dough into the pan, I start at the edges and work my way inward. This helps make the sides even (the hardest part, I think!), preventing too much buildup in the corners.",
      "DIRECTIONS FOR TARTLETS:",
      "Press each piece of dough into a 33/4-inch tartlet pan: Start with the sides and work your way to the middle, patting gently to even the dough to about 1/8 inch thick all over and letting the excess dough push up above the edges of the pan. Trim the dough by holding a paring knife flush against the edge of each pan and cutting away the excess smoothly, leaving a clean edge. Prick the dough all over with a fork. Freeze the crusts until firm, 15 to 20 minutes.",
      "Preheat the oven to 400\u00b0F / 204\u00b0C, preferably with a baking stone on the bottom rack.",
      "Transfer the tartlet pans to a baking sheet and bake on the stone or bottom rack until the crusts appear dry on the surface and the edges are firm, 15 to 18 minutes. If the dough puffs up noticeably during baking, prick it with a fork to deflate. When the tart shells are fully baked, you can also slam the tray down on the counter once or twice to help flatten the crusts.",
      "Cool the crusts completely, then invert the pans over a baking sheet and tap them gently to unmold the crusts onto the baking sheet; turn them right side up.",
      "Spoon a heaping tablespoon of melted chocolate into the base of each cooled shell and spread it into an even layer that coats the base. Set aside to allow the chocolate to set completely.",
      "Make the filling:",
      "Pour the water into a shallow cup and sprinkle the gelatin evenly over it. Let soak for 5 minutes.",
      "In a small saucepan, heat 242 g / 1 cup of the heavy cream and the sugar over medium heat, stirring, until the cream is hot and the sugar is dissolved. Add the gelatin and stir until it is fully melted.",
      "Pour the hot cream mixture into a medium bowl. Stir in the remaining 242 g / 1 cup cream and the vanilla.",
      "Pour the custard into the cooled tart shells, filling them to just below the edges. Transfer the tarts to the refrigerator and chill until the custard is set, 20 to 30 minutes.",
      "10.In a small heatproof bowl, micro-wave the jam until thinned and fluid, 30 to 45 seconds. Use a small spoon to drizzle the jam over the chilled tarts, then do the same with the cooled melted chocolate, or make \"splatter tartlets\"; see Pro Tip. Refrigerate the tarts until ready to serve.",
      "WHY IT WORKS:",
      "Panna cotta (the name is Italian for \"cooked cream\") is a delicious dessert all on its own, and it makes a killer filling for pies and tarts. Made with milk, cream, or a combo, the silky-smooth custard is set with gelatin. This method makes the sur-face set beautifully smooth-which makes the panna cotta the perfect base for pretty finishes.",
      "PRO TIP:",
      "To splatter on the jam and chocolate, I use a silicone pastry brush with thick bristles. Line your work surface with parchment paper, then dip the pastry brush into the jam. Flick the brush over the tarts, and the jam will splatter randomly. Clean the brush, then do the same with the chocolate.",

If they are stored longer than two or three days, you may need to re-roll them in coating. Fresh marshmallows go stale after about a week, so these are best eaten soon after they are made."

      "I used a 5 pound roast. I put some of the extra meat in the fridge for later and still had a lot of leftover meat. I filled my muffin pan with scoops of meat. Each individual muffin tin holds the same as a typical sandwich. I put the muffin tin in the freezer and froze the individual serving size leftovers. After about 2 hours I took the tin out removed the meat muffins. Next they went into a ziploc and they will not all stick together. To reheat just pop one in the microwave on 50% power. These are great for a quick sandwich, with rice, with beans, or with eggs.",

I think you could do without the oil. I used kraft honey bbq sauce - just what I had on hand. SOOOO tasty. Some can't stop eating this.",
      "I pulled 40 lbs. of pork using this recipe for my grand son's graduation party. I also froze it before reheating it in crockpots. I received many compliments. It turned out much more moist than the root beer recipe I tried earlier. I did serve BBQ on the side, but I'm not sure it needed it."
