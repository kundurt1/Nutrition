      "In a liquid measuring cup, stir 1/2 teaspoon of the sugar into the warm water. Sprinkle on the yeast, stir together, and let stand at room temperature for 10 minutes, until foamy.",
      "Meanwhile, heat the milk and the butter to 90 to 100\u00b0 F, either in the microwave or in a small saucepan over medium heat or in the microwave. The butter doesn't need to melt completely.",
      "Place the flour, remaining 1/4 cup sugar, and salt in the food processor. Pulse to mix. With the motor running, add the yeast mixture, then the milk-butter mixture, and finally, the egg, through the feed tube. (Maida recommends adding the milk mixture into the cup with the yeast so that you get every bit of yeast into the dough.).",
      "Process the mixture until it forms a ball, and then continue to process for another 30 seconds. If the dough is too stiff, add a few drops of water. If the machine slows down, remove about half and then process the two halves separately and knead them together in the next step.",
      "On a board or work surface, knead the dough for about 1 minute. Then place it in a buttered bowl, turning the dough to butter all sides of the ball. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and set in a warm, draft-free spot to rise for about 1 1/2 hours: It should be well-risen and doubled in bulk.",
      "Then, lightly flour a board or work surface, keeping in mind that you'll need a lot of room. Turn the dough onto the floured area and press down to deflate it. Fold in the two opposite sides to meet in the middle, then fold in the remaining two sides to meet, so that you've formed the dough into a square. Press down to flatten it slightly, then cover loosely and let stand for 10 minutes.",
      "Meanwhile, butter a 9-inch by 5-inch loaf pan, preferably one with a dark finish. Set it aside and prepare the vanilla water and cinnamon sugar, below. (You can also make two more reasonable-sized loaves by using two 9-by-5 pans. You'll follow the same instructions as below, halving all of the dimensional measurements.).",
      "To make the vanilla water, mix the water and vanilla together in a small cup. To make the cinnamon sugar, whisk together 1/3 cup sugar and the cinnamon, cocoa, and nutmeg.",
      "With a floured rolling pin, rolling the dough to form a rectangle that's 12 by 22 inches. Make the corners as square as possible. If you're having trouble with the dough shrinking back, pause briefly before trying again.",
      "Use a big pastry brush to brush about 2/3 of the vanilla water all over the dough. Maida says to be careful not to miss any spots-\"this is important.\" You can use a couple teaspoons of additional water if necessary.",
      "Then, sprinkle 2/3 of the cinnamon sugar slowly and carefully in a thin layer over the moistened dough. (\"If you sprinkle too much in any one spot, you will not have enough to cover all the dough-so be careful.\").",
      "Now fold the two long sides of the dough in one at a time, so that the meet each other in the middle. Pinch them together gently to seal the seam. Gently roll over the surface with a rolling pin to flatten the folded dough to about 7 by 25 inches.",
      "Use the remaining vanilla water to wet the dough and sprinkle the remaining cinnamon sugar over top.",
      "Now, the fun part: Making a very fat jelly roll. Starting at the narrow end, roll up the dough, making a thick spiral. When you get to the end, brush a little plain water on the loaf at the spot where the end will hit. Pinch the end a bit to seal it.",
      "Carefully and gently place the roll, seam side-down in the buttered pan. The roll of dough should nearly fill it.",
      "Sprinkle about 1 tablespoon of sugar over the loaf. Cover it loosely with plastic wrap and place in a warm, draft-free place to rise for about 1 hour, until almost doubled and about 2 inches above the top of the pan.",
      "Meanwhile, adjust the oven racks so that you have one rack one-third up from the bottom of the oven. Heat to 350\u00b0 F.",
      "Just before baking, cut slits in the top of the loaf with a sharp knife: Maida recommends six long slits, only 1/4-inch deep so that you don't expose the cinnamon sugar layer.",
      "Bake on a sheet pan for 45 to 50 minutes. You may need to cover the top loosely with aluminum foil towards the end of baking to prevent over-browning. Bake until the loaf, when removed from the pan, sounds hollow when tapped with your fingertips. Cool on a rack. Store, wrapped well in aluminum foil, for 3 to 4 days at room temperature."

Increase the vanilla extract to 2 teaspoons Top the finished waffles with 1 1/2 cups semisweet chocolate chips. The chocolate chips will melt slightly into the top surface of each hot waffle. Serve with powdered sugar and fresh raspberries, if available.",
      "Orange waffles with Pomegranate - Add to the basic mix 2 tbsp sugar and 1 tbsp grated orange zest. Replace the water with 3 tbsp orange juice. After the waffles are cooked, sprinkle with 1 cup pomegranate seeds. Serve drizzled with pomegranate molasses (available in specialty markets and Middle Eastern groceries) or a reduction of Pomegranate juice and sugar.",
      "Herbed sweet corn waffles - If you're making this when sweet corn is in season, shave fresh sweet corn directly from the cob. If corn is not in season, use frozen corn. To defrost, place it in a strainer and run it under room-temperature tap water. Drain and dry it thoroughly before adding to the batter. Omit the vanilla extract. Soak in the melted butter for a few minutes: 2 cups fresh corn kernels (from about 3 cobs), 1/4 tsp dried sage, 1/2 tsp dried thyme, 1/2 tsp dried basil. Add 1 1/2 cups of the corn-butter-herb mixture to the batter, reserving the rest for sprinkling on top of the cooked waffles. Serve with Apple-Jalapeno Syrup. For every 12 oz can of defrosted apple juice concentrate, add a 2-inch jalapeno chile, slice in half lengthwise. Bring to a boil, turn the heat down, and simmer, uncovered, for 20-30 minutes (possibly longer), until it is reduced by slightly more than half. Remove from heat, and let it cool to room temperature. Remove and discard chile. Serve in a small glass pitcher.",
      "Savory Rosemary-Olive Waffles with Peas - You can steam fresh peas or use frozen ones. To defrost, place them in a strainer and run them under room-temperature tap water. No cooking necessary. Drain and dry them thoroughly before using. Omit the sugar and vanilla extract. Replace half the melted butter with olive oil. Add to the batter 1/2 tsp crumbled dried rosemary and 1 cup minced pitted Greek (kalamata) olives. Top the finished waffles with 1 1/2 cups green peas. Serve with Roasted Garlic Aioli."

      "The chicken will be used for two layers of the loaf so I try to cut the chicken in 2-3 smaller pieces so the chicken will fit to make the layers.",
      "Dipping Station -- Layout out your dipping station -- 1) well beaten eggs in one pie pan or small flat dish; 2) parmesan, seasoned salt, pepper, cayenne, and lemon zest in the other.",
      "Pan -- Line a loaf pan with parchment paper, bottom and sides and spray with non-stick spray. I use scissors and cut down the corners of the parchment paper to make it fit easier.",
      "Layer 1: Chicken - Dip 1/2 of the chicken in the egg and then in the parmesan mixture and place in the bottom of the loaf pan. Fit the pieces in well and tight so it covers the entire bottom of the pan.",
      "Layer 2: Mortadella and Proscuitto - Top the chicken with the mortadella slices and then 1/2 of the proscuitto.",
      "Layer 3: Artichokes - Slice the artichokes in 1-3 pieces, depending on the size. Then dip 1/2 of the artichokes in the egg and then in the parmesan and place on top of the mortadella and proscuitto.",
      "Layer 4: Fresh basil leaves -- All of the basil leaves.",
      "Layer 5: Chicken Again - Same as above. Dip the remaining chicken in the egg and then parmesan and put on top of the artichokes.",
      "Layer 6: Salami - Top the chicken with all of the salami and then the remaining proscuitto.",
      "Layer 7: Artichokes - Last layer. Once again, dip in the egg and then parmesan and top the salami and proscuitto.",
      "All Done -- Cover with a piece of parchment paper and here is the key - it needs to be weighted down. Take a brick and cover it with aluminum foil. That really works best. Place on top of the parchment paper and now you are ready to bake. If you don't have a brick, just open a bag of beans and pour them on a sheet of foil and wrap up. Just something heavy to weigh the terrine down.",
      "Bake -- Put the loaf pan in another pan, like a 13x9, filled 1/2 way with warm water. Then bake at 350 for 1 1/2 hours on the middle shelf. The water will keep the terrine from getting too brown and let it cook slower. Remove and let cool completely, cover well with plastic wrap, and refrigerate overnight.",
      "Aioli -- Mix all the ingredients together. Mayonnaise, lemon, herbs and garlic. Cover and refrigerate until ready to serve. This can be made ahead of time.",
      "Serve -- Remove the plastic wrap and the top parchment paper from the terrine, then put a plate on top and flip over. Remove the parchment paper and then thin slice. You can serve this for a buffet too, it is so pretty to serve. I like to serve the slices over a bed a greens and top with the garlic herb aioli. ENJOY this great unique dish!"

      "3.\tHave a couple of damp towels on hand to cover dough during various parts of the recipe.",
      "4.\tMove your rack to the lowest part of your oven to allow room for the bowl of dough to rise in a warm environment. Shortly before placing the dough in the oven, the instructions will ask you to preheat your oven on its lowest setting for 2 minutes, then turn the oven off.",
      "5.\tIt will take about an hour for the dough to rise.",
      "6.\tSoak your bamboo steamers for 10 minutes in warm water, pat dry and lightly oil the bottom and sides before using to cook the Siopao.",

      "9.\tRestaurants and bakeries like to color code their siopao with small dots of food coloring to indicate the filling ingredients, i.e. chicken, pork, beef, etc. If you're making a variety of fillings and flavors, decide upon your color code and when the siopao is formed and placed on a oiled cookie sheet during the prep phase, paint your small dot to indicate filling. My chicken filling usually has no dot, pork filling red.",

      "Cut each scallion into 3-inch lengths.",
      "Smash ginger root with side of cleaver.",
      "Heat oil in a wok over high heat. Add scallions and ginger. Turn off heat immediately. After 5 minutes, discard the scallions and ginger. Cool for 5 more minutes.",
      "Place chili flakes in a bowl and ladle the cooled oil over them. Cover and leave over-night at room temperature. Strain oil and bottle it. Store the chili flakes in a covered jar. Both will keep indefinitely if refrigerated.",

      "Place hot water in a wok to come within an inch of the bottom of the steamer. Boil water in a controlled fashion so that the water is not trying to leap out of your wok or pot but yet plenty of hot steam. Keep a pot of water boiling off to the side, in case you need to replenish the water in the wok.",
      "Arrange the siopao, paper side down in an oiled steamer basket allowing room between each. I've cooked siopao in two sets of dual stacked steamers with great results.",
      "Set the steamer over the wok for 10 - 15 minutes. Resist the urge to lift the lid while steaming. It will stop the dough from rising.",
      "Remove steamers and allow siopao to cool a little before moving to wire cooling rack. Serve warm.",
      "The siopao freezes well to and can be reheated in a microwave oven for a minute on high or re-steamed."

      "Make up a batch of Appalachian Mountain Seasoning (my own recipe), Recipe #152980 -- the quick recipe is: 2 tablespoons dark brown sugar; 1 tablespoon dried oregano; 1 teaspoon ground roasted red chilies, without seeds (or plain ground red pepper); 1/4 teaspoon fennel seeds, freshly ground; 1/2 teaspoon garlic salt, and; 1/4 teaspoon file (pronounced FEE-lay) seasoning, OR, ground anise.",
      "Wipe the chicken dry with paper towels. Using a large brown paper bag, pour in 1 cup of the flour and \"dust\" the chicken parts, one or two at a time. Lay them out on a sheet of wax paper for about 1/2 an hour.",
      "Preheat your oven to 375-degrees F.",
      "In a large skillet, heat the Crisco to at least 375-degrees F. (A couple drops of water will \"spackle\" pretty hard at this temperature but the oil does not smoke.) DO NOT cut short on the amount of Crisco or your chicken will be greasy and dry! It must fry on the sides as it cooks in order to seal in the juices.",
      "Make up your \"drench\" in a low sided bowl by mixing the eggs, the buttermilk, and the water.",
      "Make up your \"dredge\" on a large plate by blending the Appalachian mountain seasoning, 2 cups of flour, and the salt.",
      "Drench each piece of chicken, shake off excess liquid, then dredge it in the flour blend. Lay it into the hot Crisco (It should begin frying immediately -- if not, your oil isn't hot enough).",
      "Drench and dredge only one piece of chicken at a time as you'll need to fry it up in two batches to maintain high oil temperature, and to not \"crowd\" the chicken in the skillet.",
      "Fry the chicken until it is golden brown on the bottom and then turn it (only once!), using tongs and not a fork. This should take about 8-10 minutes total, per batch. When it is golden brown on each side, lay it out on a baking pan (use one with sides). Cover the first batch with foil until the second batch is finished frying.",
      "When all the chicken has been fried, bake it on the lower-middle rack, UNCOVERED, for 40 minutes (375-degree F.).",
      "Allow the chicken to \"rest\" for 10 minutes prior to serving."

      "Mix 300 g plain flower and 1/2 tsp of salt in a large bowl. Make a well in the centre of the flour. Add 3 eggs to the well. With a fork, beat the eggs and gradually draw in the flour. With your hands, mix in as much of the flour as needed to make a rough dough. You may not need to incorporate all the flour. Or if the dough is too sticky, you may need to sprinkle over a little extra flour. As soon as the dough begins to form a ball turn it out onto a work surface lightly dusted with flour. Knead the dough until smooth, elastic and no longer sticky, about 10 minutes. Wrap in clingfilm and leave to rest for at least 30 minutes or up to 4 hours. (You can make the dough in two batches - mix 300 g of flour with 1/2 tsp of salt and 3 eggs, then repeat with the remaining 300 g of flower, salt and 3 eggs, for easier kneading).",
      "Sprinkle some sea salt on pumpkin and put it in the oven to cook at 200C for about 40 minutes. Check if it's ready with a fork. It should be fairly soft.",
      "While the pumpkin is cooking, set the ricotta cheese in a sieve lined with cheese cloth over a bowl for the extra liquid to drain.",
      "When the squash is cooked, spoon out its flesh into a bowl, add the ricotta, a pinch of nutmeg, some salt and pepper and mix well.",
      "Roll the pasta dough using a machine or a rolling pin into long sheets and place one sheet in a well-floured ravioli form. Press it into the form, so that little wells for the filling will form.",
      "Spoon the ricotta and squash mix into the wells, but don't overfill them, because excess filling will spread around the dough when rolling. Brush the dough around the mix with water, and cover with another pasta sheet. Roll with the rolling pin on top to cut into individual ravioli. (Alternatively, simply lay a pasta sheet on a floured working surface, place teaspoons of the squash mis in 2 rows at 5 cm intervals, leaving a 2 cm border around the edges. Brush the dough around the edges with water. Top with another pasta sheet and press the edges together to dal. Cut into squares with a ravioli cutter or a knife).",
      "To make the sage-butter sauce, melt the butter in a frying pan over medium heat. Add the sage leaves and cook, stirring occasionally, for 4-5 minutes until the sage is crisp and the butter is light golden. Don't let your eyes off the pan at this stage, as butter and sage leaves burn easily.",
      "Cook half the ravioli in a large saucepan of salted boiling water for 5-8 minutes or until al dente. Use a slotted spoon to transfer to a plate. Repeat with remaining pasta. Divide the ravioli among serving bowls and spoon over the sage-butter sauce."

Place a lid on the pan, leaving it slightly ajar, and cook slowly for 50 minutes, without colouring the vegetables too much. Remove the lid for the last 20 minutes - your onions will become soft and golden. Stir occasionally so that nothing catches on the bottom. Having the patience to cook the onions slowly, slowly, gives you an incredible sweetness and an awesome flavour, so don't be tempted to speed this bit up.",
      "2. When your onions and leeks are lovely and silky, add the stock. Bring to the boil, turn the heat down and simmer for 10 to 15 minutes. You can skim any fat off the surface if you like, but I prefer to leave it because it adds good flavour.",
      "3. Preheat the oven or grill to maximum. Toast your bread on both sides. Correct the seasoning of the soup. When it's perfect, ladle it into individual heatproof serving bowls and place them on a baking tray. Tear toasted bread over each bowl to fit it like a lid. Feel free to push and dunk the bread into the soup a bit. Sprinkle with some grated Cheddar and drizzle over a little Worcestershire sauce. Dress your reserved sage leaves with some olive oil and place one on top of each slice of bread. Put the baking tray into the preheated oven or under the grill to melt the cheese until bubbling and golden. Keep an eye on it and make sure it doesn't burn! When the cheese is bubbling, very carefully lift out the tray and carry it to the table. Enjoy.",

Use your hands or the paddle attachment of the stand mixer on low speed to blend the butter into the dry ingredients until the texture of the flour changes from silky to mealy. There should still be dime- to quarter-size pieces of butter remaining. If you're preparing the dough the night before, cover the bowl with plastic wrap and chill overnight; otherwise proceed with the recipe.",
      "Make a well in the flour mixture and pour in 1 cup of the buttermilk in one addition. Gently mix the dough just until it comes together; it will look rough. Scrape the dough from the sides and bottom of the bowl, then add another 1/4 cup buttermilk and mix again to incorporate any floury scraps. The majority of the dough will come together, on the paddle if you are using a stand mixer. Stop mixing while there are still visible chunks of butter and floury patches. The dough should come out of the bowl in 2 to 3 large, messy clumps, leaving only some small scraps and flour around the sides of the bowl. If the dough is visibly dry and crumbly, add up to 1/4 cup more buttermilk, 1 tablespoon at a time, mixing no more than one rotation after each addition.",
      "Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Use the heels and sides of your palms to gather the dough and gently pat it into an oblong shape 1 1/2 to 2 inches thick. It won't look smooth or particularly cohesive; that's okay. Use a biscuit cutter to cut the jammers into circles at least 21/2 inches in diameter. Layer the leftover scraps on top of one another and gently pat them out to a thickness of 1 1/2 to 2 inches and again cut into circles.",
      "Use your thumb to make an indentation the size of a fifty-cent piece in the middle of each biscuit. While gently supporting the outside edge of the biscuit with your fingers, use your thumb to create a bulb-shaped hole that's a bit wider at the bottom and that goes almost to the bottom of the biscuit (think pinch pot). Try to apply as little pressure as possible to the outside of the biscuit, to avoid smashing the layers, which are the key to flaky jammers. Fill each indentation with 1 tablespoon of jam and put the jammers on the prepared baking sheet with 1 1/2 inches between them.",
      "Bake for 35 to 40 minutes, rotating the pan halfway through the baking time. The jammers should be a deep golden brown."

      "Once all the broth has been added, bring in the two 12 oz bottles of beer. Please use a local microbrwery. I use 'winter ale'. Add this a little at a time and continue to stir. Your loving stirring is what is going to make this an awesome soup. I think I already said this, but this soup is to be used for good only.

Place a slice of cheddar on each piece of bread in the skillet, and arrange tomato slices in a single layer on each. Butter two more slices of bread, and place them butter side up over the tomato slices. When bottom of each sandwich is golden brown, use a spatula to carefully turn each sandwich. Now place a slice of provolone on top of each sandwich, and 1-2 slices of bacon. Top with the final slice of provolone. Butter two additional slices of bread and place them, butter side up, on top of each sandwich. Again, when the bottom of each sandwich is golden brown, use a spatula to carefully turn each sandwich. You may need your fingers to keep the sandwich intact while turning. Now place a slice of swiss on each sandwich, then a layer of bacon, then the final layer of swiss. Butter the final two slices of bread and place them, butter side up, on top of each sandwich. When the bottom is golden brown, use a spatula to carefully turn each sandwich. You will almost certainly need to use your fingers to keep the sandwich intact while turning. Cook until golden brown. Remove sandwiches to a cutting board, and cut on the diagonal to create thick, layered triangle slices, and serve. Variation: Sprinkle Italian Seasoning on the butter sides before frying, for added flavor and great aroma. Dill pickles and tomato soup are great alongside this beauty."
