Remove the steak from the marinade, season with salt and sear over moderately high heat until deeply browned on the bottom, about 4 minutes. Turn the steak over and roast in the oven for about 10 minutes, or until an instant-read thermometer inserted in the center of the meat registers 120\u00b0. Transfer the steak to a carving board and let rest for 10 minutes.",

      "Wine Recommendation: The crispness and heat from the fresh chile-radish relish combined with the warm, slow burn of the cayenne oil and, of course, the succulence of the beef, complement the strong fruitiness of the 1999 Howell Mountain Vineyards Zinfandel and the 1997 Dunn Vineyards Cabernet Sauvignon."

Bring water to a rolling boil; boil 10 minutes, adjusting processing time for altitude.* Turn off heat, and let stand 5 minutes. Remove jars from canner, and let stand at room temperature 24 hours. Test seals of jars by pressing centers of lids. If lids do not pop, jars are properly sealed. Store in a cool, dark place at room temperature up to 1 year. Refrigerate after opening.",

      "The water is what the oil will be suspended in, so start here. Acid (such as vinegar or citrus) behaves the same way as water, and its tart flavor will balance the rich spread.",
      "Egg Yolks, the Emulsifier. Add egg yolks and salt; pulse to combine.",
      "Egg yolks contain lecithin, which resembles both oil and water molecules and can connect to both. The salt boosts flavor and makes eggs more viscous, which helps prevent separation.",
      "Oil and Agitation. With food processor running, slowly pour oil in a thin stream through food chute.",
      "The key to marrying oil and water is to start slowly and agitate constantly. The mixing motion creates tiny droplets of oil and bubbles of air that the emulsifier (egg yolks) surrounds and keeps evenly distributed in the vinegar-water mixture. If the oil is added too quickly, the emulsifier can't join the water and oil molecules, and the mayonnaise will separate.",
      "Why Make Mayo? Prepared and homemade mayonnaise are similar in calories and saturated fat. Flavor, however, is incomparable: Homemade mayo tastes richer and will likely go a longer way toward satisfying you. And most prepared mayos contain added sugar, artificial preservatives and additives, thickeners, and twice as much sodium as ours."

      "Wine note: Look for a crisp American pinot grigio to serve with these croquettes. Estancia Pinot Grigio 2006 ($12) is bolder than most Italian versions, with acidic verve and a little fizz that smooths out the horseradish sauce. The wine's green apple flavor and citrus acidity marry well with the dish's zesty lemon and herbal notes. -Jeffery Lindenmuth"

      "Wine note: These scrumptious flans take much of their savoriness from the Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese. Because the cheese has a nutty/salty flavor, it pairs well with an earthy light red. Traditionally, Chianti would fill this bill, but for a more modern twist, try a California pinot noir instead. Pinot is an all-around winner with most hard cheeses.

You want a dough the consistency of shortbread cookie dough, you should be able to form it into a log easily, without it sagging or crumbling.

If you are using a garnish, spread a layer in a rimmed baking sheet or roasting pan. Roll the chilled logs firmly in the garnish so that it sticks, and to get the log as round as possible. Slice about 1/8-1/4 inch thick depending on how thick you like your crackers. Arrange about one inch apart on the baking sheet and bake for 15-20 minutes until they are lightly golden on the edges and the bottoms have browned, pick one up and check, if the bottom is nicely golden brown they are done. Keep an eye on them the last 3 minutes or so just to check for burning.",

If once thawed out of the freezer they feel soft, you can re-crisp on a parchment lined sheet pan at 350 for about 5-8 minutes."
