      "FOR THE BEEF STOCK: Combine the beef brisket and 2 quarts of cold water in a heavy 4 to 5 quart enameled or stainless steel casserole. Bring to a boil over high heat, meanwhile skimming off the foam and scum as they rise to the surface. Add the bacon, onion, parsnip, carrot, garlic, parsley root, bay leaf, 1 teaspoon salt and a few grindings of pepper. Then reduce the heat to low and simmer partially covered for about 2 hours, or until the brisket is tender and shows no resistance when pierced deeply with the point of a small skewer or knife.",
      "With tongs or a slotted spoon, transfer the brisket to a plate and drape foil over it to keep it warm.",
      "Strain the contents of the casserole through a fine sieve into a deep bowl, pressing down hard on the bacon bits and vegetables with the back of a spoon to extract all their juices before discarding them. With a large spoon, skim off and discard as much of the surface fat as possible. Return the stock to the casserole.",
      "FOR THE BEET STOCK: In a 3 to 4 quart enameled or stainless steel saucepan, bring the grated beets and 5 cups of cold water to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to moderate and cook uncovered for 10 minutes. Then reduce the heat to low, stir in the vinegar and 1 teaspoon of the salt, and simmer, partially covered, for 30 minutes. Strain the stock through a fine sieve into a glass or ceramic bowl, pressing down hard on the beets with the back of a spoon to extract all their juice before discarding them.",
      "The beet and beef stocks may be set aside at this point if you wish to use the brisket to make meat stuffed buns (Ukrainian Filled Yeast Pyrizhky (Stuffed Buns with Variations) see recipe, usually accompanying the soup.",
      "Just before serving, combine the stocks, add the remaining 1/2 teaspoon of salt, the lemon juice and sugar, and bring to a boil over high heat. Taste for seasoning and serve at once from a heated tureen or individual soup plates. If you have not prepared the pyrizhky, the brisket may be sliced and served with the soup. Serves 8 to 10."

My shirt is covered with chili, which slid unnoticed out of my mouth. My pants are full of lava to match my shirt. At least during the autopsy, they'll know what killed me. I've decided to stop breathing. It's too painful. Screw it; I'm not getting any oxygen anyway. If I need air, I'll just suck it in through the 4-inch hole in my stomach.",

      "Judge # 2 -- This final entry is a good, balanced chili. Neither mild nor hot. Sorry to see that most of it was lost when Judge #3 farted, passed out, fell over and pulled the chili pot down on top of himself. Not sure if he's going to make it. Poor fella, wonder how he'd have reacted to really hot chili?.",

The dough should be about 1/4 inch thick--you do not want to see the corn husk through the dough. Add a bit of filling, and some cheese. Fold the corn husk over to join the edges of the masa. If you need to add more dough, do so---no filling should peek through. Fold all corn husk edges into the center and place into the bottom of an empty crockpot, seam side down (I used a 6.5 quart, and fit 19 inside).",
      "Repeat. Many, many, many times. It took me about 2 hours to make all of the tamales. If you find that your corn husks are unraveling, you can add another the other way to secure it, and tear off a long piece to tie around. I had to do this a few times. I also needed to add more hot water to the soaking husks to keep them pliable. If you need to step away from the tamale-making-process for a bit, put the lid on your crockpot to keep moisture inside.",
      "When the crockpot is full, put the lid on and cook on high for 4-6 hours, or until a tester tamale looks and tastes done. The tamales on the edges will cook a bit faster. Once your tester looks good (I used the same one, and kept re-wrapping it and adding it back when it wasn't ready), unplug the crockpot and keep the lid off. Don't unwrap any others until they've set for about 15 minutes. My tamales were cooked at 6 hours, but I began checking every 45 minutes at 4 hours."

Eggs can be left behind in the body. Cut the bodies into 3/4 inch squares.",

      "Start by putting 700g water (about 3 cups + 1 tablespoon) in a 6qt container with a lid. Just make sure it's not a screw-top container, because you want it to be able to pop off if the dough really expands or gases build up inside. But you don't want the dough to dry out during the long rise time, so you want something with a decent seal to keep in the moisture.",
      "Sprinkle a tablespoon of salt and 4-8 g (1-2 teaspoons) of yeast on top. The warmer it is inside where you are going to set the dough to rise, the less yeast you need. In the summer I use 4g, and the winter 8g. Great for stretching that pricey jar of yeast as far as it will go!",
      "Dump 1000g of unbleached all-purpose flour on top of that (approx 7-7.5 cups) and mix it up with a big spoon just until all the flour is damp. Don't knead! It's very sticky at this point, but still, more of a lump than a batter.",
      "Cover and let it sit out on the counter (out of the sun) all day or all night, until you can see big bubbles in the dough through the clear sides of the container and the container is almost full. For me this usually takes 6-12 hours. Recently I've found I can let it sit out just a short amount of time and then just chuck it in the fridge overnight with the same results.",
      "Technically it's ready to bake at that point, but I find it's very difficult to handle until it sits in the fridge for a good chunk of time first. The coolness makes it a little stiffer. So once it's risen, chuck it in the fridge for another half a day.",
      "When you're ready, sprinkle the top of the dough with a few tablespoons of flour, just to make the part where you're going to stick your fingers less sticky, but don't work it in at all. Grab the dough by the floury part, lift it partially out and cut off a piece with a bread knife. Tuck the edges underneath to form a ball (you may need to go around the edges several times) and put it on a pan sprayed with oil and dusted with cornmeal. You want to use a pan deeper than the bread is tall. A dutch oven is ideal, but I use a large loaf pan. I make about 1/5 of the dough at a time, which is about the size of an orange, but you can use less or more if you adjust baking times.",
      "Put the remaining dough back in the fridge, and use it all up in a 10-14 days. When you make the next batch, you can even skip cleaning the container out if you want. The little smudges of leftover flour and dough should incorporate into the new batch with no ill effects.",
      "Recently I've discovered that if you take an extra minute to shape the remaining dough into a ball before putting it back in the fridge, it pays huge dividends. Just pick up the whole thing and spend a minute tucking the edges under, going around and around, and then plop it back in the container. Next time you go to cut a hunk of dough off, you'll find the dough is extra bubbly, and it bakes up extra fluffy with nice big air-pocket holes in it.",
      "Let the newly shaped loaf sit for 30-60 minutes, then cover tightly (either with foil, or if your pan is a dutch oven with the lid) to keep in the moisture as the bread bakes. This eliminates the need for a pan of water in the bottom of the oven.",
      "I used to preheat, but recently I've been putting it in a cold oven with good results. The large toaster oven I use heats up pretty fast, so that may be why it works so well for me. At any rate, you want to bake at 450 for a good long time, then take the lid/foil off to brown for a little more. In my oven, for the size I make (about 1/5 of the dough at a time) that takes about 30-35 minutes, plus 5-10 for the browning. You will have to experiment with your own equipment.",
      "Let it sit until it cools, then slice and enjoy! Once it's cut, it goes stale pretty quickly, so don't resist that good bread smell too long -- .",
      "NOTE: You can tinker with the flour any way you want. Whole wheat, rye, oatmeal, flax, wheat bran, cinnamon, etc. If you don't want to improvise, just find another recipe you like and use that with this method. See the book \"Artisan Bread in 5 minutes a day\" for other variations and options like pizza, bagels, pretzles, etc.",
      "NOTE2: If you want to bake all the dough at once, I recommend starting at least 24 hours in advance. Mix the dough, refrigerate for half a day, take the dough and spend a minute shaping into a ball, then put it back in the fridge for another half a day before taking it out and putting it in its final shape."

Dump in the flour, and mix vigorously with a wooden spoon, until the flour is completely incorporated. The dough ball should slightly film the pan with a floury residue. Take off the heat and cool the bottom by putting it on a damp kitchen towel, or briefly running cold water over it.",

      "Scoop the warm dough into the plastic bag. Cut the end off one corner with scissors, to make an opening about .5 cm / 1/4 inch or so. Now you will squeeze the mixture onto the pans - the shape dictates what you'll call it eventually. You can make long blobs, which would make them eclairs, tiny blobs, or bigger blobs. To smooth out any parts that stick up when you squeeze out the dough, just wet your finger in water or milk and smooth out. You can also glaze the puffs with a beaten egg wash, to give a shine to it. In this case use a pastry brush, and smooth out the top with it as you glaze.",
      "Baking time also varies, depending on how big your blobs are. For about 5 cm diameter / 2 inch puffs, bake for about 20 minutes, rotating the pans halfway through. (Rotating means to switch the pans so that the top one is on the bottom, and vice versa. You may also want to turn the pans at this point too.) Watch the puffs and when they are a medium brown color, take them out.",

You can then return the puffs to the oven for a few minutes. To ensure there will be no sogginess whatsoever, some people cut open the puffs and let them dry out a bit in the oven, but I sort of like some softness inside so omit this step.",
      "You can also poach the dough in boiling water, to make light gnocchi. Squeeze blobs of the dough into the salted boiling water and cook until the bits float to the surface. Serve with butter, cheese, fresh parsley and so on."

These parties can be expensive, so my last party, I made up invitations with drawings of the veggie they were to bring - each person had one to bring - on the front, and I supplied the rest. This way it costs them like 3 bucks each, but saves your wallett. It's a good thing to do because after hosting one of these parties, your guests will be begging for more!"
