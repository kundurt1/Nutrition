      "The first thing to do is preheat your oven to 400 degrees (F).",
      "Next using a large sharp knife, cut the butternut squashes in half, lengthwise.",
      "Place them on a baking sheet face up and let them bake undisturbed for about 30 minutes.",
      "Dont worry about removing the seeds, they come up easier after the squash is baked.",
      "After 30 minutes, pull them from the oven and remove the seeds with a spoon.",
      "With a small paring knife, cut a rim around the squash leaving about 1/2 of a squash rim.",
      "The idea is to remove the squash in rustic cubes.",
      "Youll want to keep the shell intact because well be stuffing it later and baking.",
      "Next, its time to cook the barley.",
      "In a small pot, add 3 cups chicken stock and the barley.",
      "Let it come to a boil, then turn down the heat and allow the barley to cook for about 45 minutes on a low simmer.",
      "Please note, I did not use the instant barley.",
      "While the barley is cooking, begin making the chicken meatballs.",
      "I discovered recently that using a food processor is a great way to grind up meat.",
      "I personally love the idea of knowing exactly what is going into my ground products.",
      "No mystery meat here!",
      "I added the whole chicken breasts to the food processor.",
      "Next roughly chop up the garlic, rosemary, thyme and about 3 tablespoons of the fresh sage and add that to the processor.",
      "Also add 1 tablespoon of rubbed sage or poultry seasoning and salt.",
      "Then add the mayonnaise.",
      "I know that sounds really weird right?",
      "But youll have to trust me on this.",
      "If you dont add it to the mixture, the meatballs will turn out really dry since were using boneless, skinless chicken breasts.",
      "Turn the food processor on and let it run until you have a smooth consistency.",
      "Remove the lid and add the egg and bread crumbs.",
      "Let the food processor run until all of the ingredients are blended well.",
      "Now were ready to form the meatballs.",
      "Make them on the small side I think they work best in this dish.",
      "Then place them on a baking dish and bake at 400 degrees for about 25 minutes or until golden brown.",
      "While the meatballs are baking, begin sauteing the onion in a deep skillet adding the 2 tablespoons of olive oil.",
      "Add 1 tablespoons of rubbed sage and the grated nutmeg.",
      "When its done, drain the barley well and add to the pot with the onions.",
      "Next goes the chunks of butternut squash, the chicken meatballs, remaining sage (reserve about 1 tablespoon of the fresh sage to garnish at the end) and 1 cup of chicken stock and season with salt to your taste.",
      "Remember that the chicken stock has salt in it so go easy on the salt.",
      "Ok were almost done!",
      "Remember the shells of the butternut squash we reserved?",

      "Top each butternut squash with a little shredded Parmesan cheese and bake in the oven just for a few minutes until the cheese melts.",

      "Wash beef and cube if necessary (I used stew beef to save knife time); Place cut beef in a bowl, and coat with oil mixture from last night; Mix with your hands to get everything well coated, cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and let sit in refrigerator for at least 1 hour prior to cooking.",
      "Prepare your veggies, so you don't burn anything while cooking and chopping all at once; Start with the Eggplant, which should be peeled, sliced about 1/4-1/3\" thick, and seasoned lightly to taste with salt and pepper before cutting each disc in half.",
      "Wash the mushrooms, removing the stems if you desire (I personally did, and usually do); Season lightly with salt, slice the caps, and then cut each slice into thirds; I got a pack of 3 portobellos and they were plenty; A similar-sized pre-sliced package would be just as good.",
      "Remove the leaves from the Endive, washing as you go, as you would any tight-headed leafy vegetable; You should get about 6 to 8 reasonable sized leaves (2 to 4 being a little small comparatively) before getting to the core of the Endive; Keep these leaves whole, and coarsely chop any smaller leaves.",
      "When you're ready to start cooking, heat about 1/4 cup Olive Oil, or enough to coat, in a large pan.",
      "You should have just enough time to whack the life out of a clove of garlic with the bottom of a pan before your oil is hot enough; Protect the pan, the table, and yourself by wrapping the garlic loosely in wax paper, aluminum foil, or similar; You needn't overdo this; One good whack should be enough to get the desired effect out of the garlic and scare your cats/mother.",
      "Add your eggplant to the hot pan; Keep an eye on it, and cook until it just turns golden.",
      "As soon as the eggplant is goldening, for lack of a real word, throw in the mushrooms, which should cook until they start to get tender and give off a bit of a meaty flavor when tested.",
      "After adding the mushrooms, give the flat garlic a good chop and throw it in as well.",
      "When the mushrooms get to that magic just about tender point, add your beef; It shouldn't come straight from the fridge, but also you don't want it just sitting about for too long; Let this brown.",
      "When you feel the beef is just about cooked through, add the wine; I added somewhere just under a cup; This should be enough to coat the beef mixture, but not drown it; If you like wine, make sure it's a wine you'd drink with a meal; If you're not a wine person, which I am not, make sure it's red.",
      "At this point, you'll have enough time to do some frying while the wine reduces; Fill a small pan of average depth (the one you killed the garlic with will probably be perfect) with enough vegetable oil to fry (I'd say about a cup) and start heating; Trust me, this doesn't seem like much for frying, but you won't need much.",
      "Mix the corn starch and flour in a shallow bowl together.",
      "If you'd like, add a moderate pinch of the mixture to about 1/8 cup water, stirring it up and adding it to your wine sauce if you want it a little thicker (doing this outside the pan without hot water will make clumping less likely).",
      "Beat 1 egg in a similar bowl to the one you have the flour mix inches.",
      "Take your whole endive leaves and coat them first with egg and then with the flour/cornstarch mixture.",
      "About two or three at a time, fry the endive leaves until lightly golden; Let the leaves drain on a paper towel; They'll come out tasting like milder onions, but leafier.",
      "Your beef should be set right about now; Take it off the heat.",
      "To plate, place fried endive leaves toward edge of plate, fanned along the circumference (about half the yield per plate); Spoon beef into center of plate, so it only partially covers endive; Sprinkle the remaining endive (yknow, the stuff you chopped) over the top of each serving; This should make 2 large, 4 small, or 3 sensible servings."
