      "Saute fennel, onion, garlic & salt in olive oil for a few minutes. Add wine (or chicken broth). Continue cooking approximately 5-10 minutes (don't rush this time, make sure the fennel is softened, once tomatoes are added in the next step, the acidity of the tomatoes will stop the cooking process of the fennel). Add Italian style tomatoes, basil and Italian parsley. Continue cooking for a few minutes. Add shrimp; cook only until shrimp turn pink. Combine linguine with sauce and serve. Top with Parmesan cheese, if desired."
