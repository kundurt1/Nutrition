      "(6/7 mins).",
      "In the same skillet or a clean one if preferred add the rest of the butter and saute the mushrooms, onion and celery until tender.",
      "(3/4 mins).",
      "Then return the chicken to the pan add the water and the bay leaf, stir and bring to the boil.",
      "(2/3 mins).",
      "Reduce the heat to a low-medium heat cover and simmer for 30-35 mins, stirring occasionally.",
      "During this time the sauce should thicken and have a buttery creamy colour, add more water if the sauce begins to thicken too much to bring it back to a creamy consistency.",
      "Place the remaning flour mixture in a bowl and stir in the milk until smooth then add this to the pan BE CAREFUL not to add too much flour 1 and a half teaspoons should be sufficient, whilst stirring and bring to the boil for 2 minutes.",
      "Turn off the heat and stir in 1 to 2 tablespoons of creme fraiche.",
      "You may add more creme fraiche if desired too taste as this will add a more creamy texture to the dish.",

      "Discard the bay leaf and sprinkle with the parsley if desired.",
      "To Cook the Rice.",
      "Begin cooking the rice about 10 minutes before the chicken fricasse is finished.",
      "Add enough rice to serve 3 to 4 people to a pan.",
      "You do not need to wash the rice before cooking.",

      "You can just simply spoon the rice straight from the pan to the plate.",
