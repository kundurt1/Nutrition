      "Mousse is comprised of three elements: a mousse base (Swiss meringue), flavoring (chocolate and bourbon), and whipped cream. To make a mousse that's rich in flavor with a light-as-air mouthfeel, follow these steps:",
      "Make sure the mousse base (the Swiss meringue), chocolate, and whipped cream are similar consistencies. This will help the folding process. If your whipped cream is too stiff, the result will be a clumpy mousse. Alternatively, if it's too soft, the mousse won't set up properly in the fridge.",
      "The process of gently folding is important. When folding, you're adding a delicate product (the whipped cream) to a heavier product (the mousse base and chocolate). The goal is to keep the lightness of the whipped cream while incorporating it into the mousse base. Fold - never stir!"

      "Rinse the rice several times, until the water is almost clear, then drain it. Stir in one teaspoon of salt and 360ml of water (or more, if needed). Put the ingredients in a rice cooker and steam until done. While the rice is still very hot, mix it roughly, to break up the grains (but not so much that it turns into a paste). Very lightly oil a pan then line it as smoothly as possible with cling-film. Press the rice into the pan so that it is about 2.5cm deep. Lay a sheet of cling-film smoothly on top of the rice. Place another pan on the cling-film, weigh it down so that it compresses the rice, then refrigerate overnight.",
      "Pound the lemongrass and galangal in a mortar. Add the shallot and garlic and continue to pound until a rough paste is formed. Scrape the ingredients into a bowl and add the palm sugar, turmeric, curry powder, coconut milk, 5ml of cooking oil and one teaspoon of salt. Combine thoroughly, then taste; add more salt, if needed. Cut the chicken into strips and mix with the marinade. Cover with cling-film and leave at room temperature for about an hour. Soak wooden skewers in cold water (this prevents them from burning when you cook the satay).",
      "Make the sauce. Put the coriander seeds, peanuts, curry paste and palm sugar in a mortar and pound to a paste. Heat 5ml of oil in a saucepan, add the coconut cream and bring to the boil. Add the peanut/curry paste mixture and stir well to combine. Bring to the boil then lower the heat. Simmer for about five minutes, until the mixture is thick and the oil floats to the surface.",
      "Thread the chicken onto the soaked skewers. Lightly oil a grill pan or barbecue grill and lay the skewers on top. Cook the satay on high heat, until the chicken is cooked through and lightly charred at the edges, turning the skewers as needed. Pour the sauce into a bowl. Cut the nasi impit into two-bite-sized pieces. Arrange the satay and nasi impit on a plate, add the sauce, cucumber and red onion, then serve."

      "When a lot of the fat has rendered out and the skin is crispy and brown, flip the thighs so the crispy skin is up. Dot the cast iron skillet with lemon slices and thyme sprigs and stick it in the hot oven. Let the thighs finish cooking in the oven for 13 to 15 minutes, until they reach an internal temperature of 165\u00b0 F. If you're in doubt, leave them in for another few minutes.",
      "Recipe Notes\nDepending on the size of your cast iron skillet, you might want to brown the chicken in batches so as not to crowd the pan. If you do this, reduce the time on the second batch, as the pan will already be hot. Then you can transfer the thighs to a baking dish to finish in the oven.\nChicken thighs can vary wildly in weight. In the same package, you may have some that weight 4-5 ounces and some that weigh as much as 8 ounces. Don't stress about it; you can cook them all together. Two smaller thighs or one larger one is a good serving size."

      "In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream the butter and sugars together on medium-high speed until fluffy, about 5 minutes. As you make the batter, stop the mixer frequently and scrape the paddle and the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula. Blend in the egg yolks and the eggs one at a time, adding the next one as soon as the previous one has disappeared into the batter. With the mixer on low speed, add the flour mixture in three parts, alternating with the cocoa mixture in two parts, beginning and ending with the flour. After each addition, mix until just barely blended and stop and scrape the bowl. Stop the mixer before the last of the flour has been incorporated and complete the blending by hand with a rubber spatula to ensure you do not overbeat the batter.",
      "Divide the thick batter evenly between the two prepared pans (there will be approximately 1 pound 4 ounces per pan) and smooth the tops. Tap the pans on the counter to eliminate any air bubbles. Bake in the middle of the oven until the centers spring back when lightly touched and small cracks have formed on the surface, 35 to 40 minutes. Cool the cakes in their pans on a wire rack for 30 minutes. Flip the cakes out of the pans, leaving on the parchment paper until you assemble the cake. Let them continue to cool on the rack, top sides up, until they reach room temperature.",

      "Using a hand whisk, whisk together the egg whites, sugar, and cream of tartar in the clean bowl of a stand mixer. Place the bowl over (not in) a saucepan of simmering water. The egg white mixture will be gloppy and thick, but as the mixture begins to warm up, it will become more fluid. Continue to gently whisk the mixture until it is very hot to the touch (130\u00b0F on a candy thermometer).",
      "Move the bowl to the stand mixer and, using the whisk attachment, whip the whites on medium-high speed until they have tripled in volume and are thick and glossy and hold stiff peaks (like meringue), 3 to 4 minutes. Turn the mixer down to medium-low speed until the mixing bowl is just cool to the touch, 1 to 2 minutes. Kick the mixer back up to medium-high speed and add the butter one piece at a time, adding the next piece just as the previous one has been incorporated. Stop the mixer every so often to scrape down the escaping buttercream from the sides of the bowl. At some point, the buttercream will take on a curdled appearance; don't worry, this is normal. Just keep on mixing until it comes together. Once all the butter is incorporated and the frosting is fluffy and creamy, blend in the vanilla and salt until fully combined."

      "Cooking times are approximate and spices are flexible; use whatcha like. My usual version goes something like this:Preheat your oven to 250 degrees. Meanwhile, melt the butter in a heavy cast iron skillet over a low to medium fire. Toss in the peanuts and all the spices and stir thoroughly to coat the peanuts uniformly with butter and spices They don't all have to touch the bottom of the pan, but don't make them too deep unless you want to spend the next 15-20 minutes constantly stirring. You can obviously do them in batches in series (one pan) or in parallel (more than one pan). In any event, stir them frequently, as they usually take a while to start browning but then",
      "Open a cold beer and enjoy the pregame hype. You will want to roast the peanuts anywhere from 30 to 60 minutes, depending on how you like them, stirring them every 10 minutes. We like them well done, by which time they will have a deep, mahogany hue. This takes 45-60 minutes depending on the accuracy of your oven thermostat and the doneness you have achieved when browning them on the stove. You will want to test them occasionally (more than occasionally when the aroma starts beckoning to you). Be aware that they aren't crisp when hot but become so quickly when allowed to cool."

Working on a lightly floured surface, take egg-sized pieces of the dough and smear them away from you with the heel of your hand into 6-inch streaks. Scrape up all the streaks of dough and pile them on top of one another to form a disc. Wrap in plastic and refrigerate for at least 2 hours or overnight.

When they begin to soften, add a small amount of broth, mix and place the lid on top for 10-15 minutes or until veggies are soft. Add the chicken and enough chicken broth to cover. I added more briquettes to the bottom and a few on the lid at this point to really heat things up. Allow this to reduce a bit and heat the chicken, then you might need to add some flour to thicken, stirring it in the entire time. Make dumplings in a bowl until you have a chunky mix and plop them over the chicken mix, 6 to 8 dumplings. Place lid back on and cook 10-15 minutes or until the dough is cooked through. Ta-da!",
      "Not camping: Heat dutch oven over medium heat and add oil, a few minutes later add veggies, butter, herbs, cayenne and salt/pepper. Cook until veggies are soft, then add some broth and reduce 5 or so minutes. Toss in the chicken pieces and more broth, just to cover the chicken and place lid on for about 5-10 minutes. Stir in flour to thicken and make dumpling mix. Plop the dumplings, 6 to 8 on the mix and cover again for 15-20 minutes or until the dough is cooked through."

      "The starch from the whole wheat pasta thickens the broth into a mild sauce and that's what makes this recipe work its magic. Gluten-free pasta will almost definitely not be a viable substitute, as it does not have the same properties. Regular (not whole wheat) pasta is what the original recipe used, and it called for more liquid (4 cups). I personally have not tested with anything other than whole wheat.\n\nMy olives, artichoke hearts, chickpeas, capers, and tomatoes all came from (BPA-free) cans, so I found that I didn't need to add any salt, even with my homemade salt-free vegetable broth. It's easiest to salt to taste after the pasta is done cooking, but if none of your ingredients have salt added, I recommend adding a bit before cooking in order to get the same results that I did.\n\nIn my picture the onions are chopped, but they will do a better job cooking through if you mince them. Sorry for the visual deception.\n\nFinally, I have heard some feedback that the leftovers can get soggy. I think you can minimize the chances of this by: 1) cooking the pasta to al dente, 2) tossing with a bit of olive oil before you store it, and/or 3) let it fully cool, uncovered, before storing."

Stop the mixer once to scrape down the sides of the bowl. Mix 20 seconds longer to incorporate any scraggly bits.",

Using a #12 scoop (80 ml/ 1/3 cup), scoop out 12 slightly rounded balls and drop onto two parchment-lined baking sheets - 6 scones per pan, spacing them evenly apart. Using the palms of your hands, gently shape the balls into 2 1/2-in/6.25-cm by 1-in/2.5-cm rounds. See Note below if you're using raspberry jam. Place the jammers in the freezer for 2 hours or overnight. The longer they chill, the better the shape they will hold. (At this point, the jammers can be wrapped tightly and frozen for up to 1 month.)",
      "Note: To make jammers with a center of jam, use your thumb to make a well in the center of each scone. Fill with your favorite jam, preferably a thick jam, such as raspberry or apricot. Use approximately 1 tablespoon of jam per jammer. Add the jam before you freeze the jammers, prior to baking.",

Lift each jammer off the baking sheet, brush with the butter, and sprinkle the tops and sides generously with the cinnamon sugar. (Do this over a bowl rather than on the baking sheet to keep the parchment clean.)",
      "Bake the jammers until the tops are golden brown and the bottoms are firm to the touch, 25 to 30 minutes. Rotate pans and switch top-bottom halfway through baking time. Set the baking pan on a wire rack and cool the jammers for 10 minutes before serving. Jammers are best when served on the day they are baked."

Bring the water to a boil, then drain and rinse the feet under cold water. This initial blanch of the feet will help to remove any impurities. Return the feet to the pot, cover with enough water to cover the feet by 2 inches. Bring the water to a simmer and cook for 5 hours, skimming regularly. Add the cut vegetables and aromatics to the pot and simmer for an additional hour. Strain the feet and vegetables (if desired, you can pick the meat from the trotters and add to your finished trotter gear,) strain the liquid again through a chinois and cool. Your final product, when cooled, should set very firmly.",
      "2. For the filling: Cut the shoulder into 1/4 inch dice and combine with the ground pork meat. Add the chopped thyme leaves, salt and freshly ground pepper and mix to combine. Cover and set aside until you are ready to fill the pies.",
      "3. For the dough: Heat the lard and water in a small pot until the lard has completely melted and the mixture has come to a simmer. Place the flour in a large bowl and pour the melted lard and hot water over top. Stir the dough mixture to combine and when it has cooled enough to touch, turn the dough out onto a floured surface. Knead the dough enough so that it comes together in a large ball. Cut away 1/4 of the dough and return it to the bowl and cover. While the dough is still warm, roll it out to 1/8 inch thickness. Cut circles 6 1/2 inches wide, so that when the dough has been pressed into the pan, there is a small overhanging edge. Repeat this process for your remaining pans. Roll out the remaining 1/4 of the dough and cut 4 inch rounds to serve as tops for each of pies. Cut a small round vent hole out of each of the tops (a round pastry tip or straw works well for this.)",
      "4. To assemble and cook the pies: Preheat the oven to 375\u00b0F. Fill the pies with your prepared meat mixture, pressing down to tightly pack the pies. Cover each of the packed pies with the 4\" dough tops and pinch the edges to seal. Brush the tops of the pie with egg wash, place on a sheet tray and into the oven. Bake the pies for 30 minutes, rotate, and then again for an additional 20-30 minutes until the tops are golden brown.",
      "5. Remove the pies from the oven and allow to cool completely. Take 2 cups of the trotter gear and heat until it is a liquid again. Pour the trotter gear into each of the vent holes of the pork pies until completely filled. Place the pies in the refrigerator and allow to cool completely before serving."
