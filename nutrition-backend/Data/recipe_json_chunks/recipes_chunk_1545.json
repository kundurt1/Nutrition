Transfer the mixture to the prepared spring form pan and press it very firmly into an even layer across the bottom to form the crust. Bake the crust for 10 minutes to let it set. When it's done, take it out of the oven and set it aside. Reduce the oven heat to 325 F.",
      "3. Meanwhile, prepare the luscious filling. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat together the cream cheeses, mascarpone cheese and pumpkin puree until they are thoroughly combined and fluffy. Add the sugars, pumpkin pie spice, cinnamon, nutmeg, salt and vanilla and let them get completely stirred in. The eggs and yolk get stirred in next, then finally the flour. Continue mixing until it is a smooth batter.",
      "4. Liberally grease the sides of the spring form pan with more butter or shortening so that the cheesecake doesn't stick to the sides. Transfer the batter into the prepared pan and put the pan on a sheet tray with a big lip. Put the tray in the oven, then carefully pour water into the tray around the spring form pan. This keeps the top of the cheesecake from cracking. Let the cheesecake bake for about an hour and fifteen minutes, until cooked through and set.",
      "5. When it's done, carefully remove the pans from the oven. Remove the cheesecake pan from the tray of water. Let the cake cool for about 10 minutes before releasing it from the spring form pan. Let it cool for another 5-10 minutes before covering it and putting it in the refrigerator. Let the cheesecake chill for at least 3-4 hours before serving.",
      "6. When ready to serve, cut the cheesecake into the desired sized pieces and drizzle each piece with prepared salted caramel sauce. Enjoy this decadent alternative to pumpkin pie!"

      "Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F and grease a 9 1/2\" glass pie dish with coconut oil. Make sure to grease it liberally, because otherwise the honey you'll add will make this crust stick.",
      "For the crust, mix together all of the dry ingredients, then stir in the wet ingredients (except the honey) with a fork. Add just enough coconut cream to bring the dough together into a ball. It will be clumpy when you stir it with the fork, but should come together fairly easily into a ball. Press the ball down flat, then use your fingers to push it down into the bottom and sides of your pie dish. Use a small pizza roller to smooth it out if necessary. If your fingers get sticky, try dipping them into water. Make sure the crust is even and not too thick.",
      "Bake for 12 minutes, just to get it a little crusty. If any bubbles come up in the crust, they'll probably go down on their own in a couple minutes. Try not to let any holes open up in it, though, or the honey will seep out too much.",
      "Spread raw honey on the bottom of the warm crust.",
      "Make sure your oven is still heated to 350\u00b0F from pre-baking the crust. Whisk together all of the filling ingredients, then pour into the crust. I actually placed the crust on the rack first, then added the filling, so I didn't have to move it too much. Place a pie shield around the edges to prevent burning.",
      "Bake the paleo pumpkin pie for 45-55 minutes, making sure to check it at the 40-minute mark. The center should be mostly set.",
      "Gently place a pumpkin cookie cutter in the middle of the pie, and sprinkle cashew flour inside of it to make the pumpkin shape. I also sprinkle my pie with extra cinnamon. Serve cold with dairy-free whipped cream. Enjoy!"

      "4. Put the semi-sweet chocolate and the shortening (if using) in a microwave safe bowl. Heat it in the microwave in 30 second increments, stirring after every 30 seconds. When the chocolate looks almost melted, microwave the chocolate for only 10-15 seconds more.",
      "5. Take the truffles out of the freezer, and dip each one in chocolate, dripping off the excess. Place the dipped truffles back on the baking sheet lined with foil or parchment paper. After each 2 or 3 truffles, decorate the tops of the truffles with sprinkles, if desired.",
      "6. Freeze for at least 20-25 minutes before serving, and then store in the refrigerator. Serve cold. Enjoy!",
      "Notes:",
      "1. I add a little bit of shortening to my chocolate because it makes the liquid chocolate a little more fluid, causing the chocolate coating to be a little less thick and harden a little bit better. If this doesn't appeal to you, it is totally okay to leave it out. Also, if you use shortening, it does cause the chocolate coating to harden faster. So be sure to decorate the tops of your truffles every 2 or 3 that you dip, because the chocolate does harden a bit quickly, and once it does, the sprinkles will not stick well.",
      "2. Your hands will get messy making these truffles. Use good food-grade gloves if you'd like, but if you don't, make sure you wash your hands every 4-5 truffles because your hands will get warm and sticky and it will make rolling the truffles difficult. If your truffle filling starts to feel too soft, pop it back into the freezer for 5-10 minutes to harden up again."

Starting on low and quickly increasing to high, beat until the mixture thickens and forms soft peaks when the beater is removed, about 2 to 3 minutes. Add pumpkin and a few drops of food coloring (optional) and mix to combine. Mixture will become slightly loose again. Beat for a minute or so until it thickens.",

Cook until the bottom sets and tiny bubbles form on batter (about 1 minute). Flip the crepe using a spatula. Cook the second side until set, about 30 seconds. If crepe browns too quickly, reduce heat. Place cooked crepe on a flat surface. Continue making crepes until all the batter is used up. Place the newly made crepes on top of the previous one, separated by a piece of parchment paper.",

Start with a rounded 1/4 teaspoon of each which should produce a pale orange. To get a more intense shade, add more food coloring. If the color is a bit pink, add more yellow. If it is sallow, add a little more red.",

    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "1. In a microwave safe bowl, add the whole milk and the first amount of sugar. Cut 1/2 cup of butter into small pieces and add it into the milk and sugar mixture. Microwave for about 2 to 3 minutes until butter is just about melted. If there are any pieces floating, mix with a whisk and the butter will melt down.",
      "2. Pour mixture into a large mixing bowl and let it cool for a few minutes. Add the egg (adding it sooner will cause it to scramble) and kosher salt. Allow the mixture to sit and cool for a few more minutes. Meanwhile, in a small bowl or cup dissolve the yeast and second amount of sugar in the warm water. Let it sit for a few minutes until bubbly. Add 2 cups of flour to the milk mixture to help cool it down further. Once the mixture has cooled down and is no longer boiling hot, add the yeast, sugar and water mixture.",
      "3. Gradually add about 8-9 cups of flour in 2-cup increments, being sure to mix well in between. This dough comes out much better when mixed with your hands, however if you'd rather use a wooden spoon, that will work too! You may not use all of the flour. You'll know you've added enough flour when dough is dense and somewhat sticky. Once all the flour is incorporated, cover with plastic wrap and place a towel over the plastic wrap. Leave in a warm place and let dough rise for about 3-4 hours. You will know the dough has risen enough when it has quadrupled in size.",
      "4. When the dough is just about done rising, soften 2 cups of butter. Use some of the softened butter to grease 2 cookie sheets. Set aside (you will use the rest of the butter later). Create a large working space either on your counter or on a large cutting board. Cover the area with plenty of flour to prevent sticking while rolling out the dough.",
      "5. Remove the dough from the bowl and split into 4 balls. These don't have to be perfect so just guess by eyeballing the size and the weight of each one. Leave 1 ball of dough on your floured work space and place the others aside. Using a rolling pin, roll out the ball into a circle that is no thicker than 1/4 of an inch. Once the dough is completely rolled out use a pastry brush to spread butter on the entire piece of dough.",
      "6. Using a pizza cutter cut the circle of dough into quarters. Then cut each quarter into 3 wedges, which would give you 12 slices from each ball of dough. Now you get to roll the rolls! Starting with the wide end of the triangle, roll up each slice of dough and place on buttered cookie sheet with the pointed end of the triangle tucked underneath. Depending on the size of your cookie sheet, you will make 3 rows of 8 rolls giving you 24 rolls per pan. If you have a smaller or larger cookie sheet, adjust this number so the rolls are slightly touching when placed on the pan. Continue this process with the remaining 3 balls of dough.",
      "7. Preheat your oven to 350 F and allow your rolls to rise again by putting them in a warm place and covering each pan with a lightweight towel. Once the rolls are very full and touching, they are ready to bake! Place pans in the oven and bake for about 15-20 minutes until golden brown. Check the rolls at 10 minutes just to be sure they aren't burning. When rolls are done baking, remove from oven and immediately brush the tops of the rolls with the remaining softened butter. Enjoy!",
      "Notes:",
      "1. Of course the rolls taste the best when eaten immediately but they will last for about a week in a sealed bag or container.",
      "2. If you are gluten-free, these rolls turn out great using Pamela's Products Gluten-Free Artisan Flour Blend, 4 Pound! They don't rise as much, but they are pretty tasty regardless!"

Stop shaking only when you can't hear the liquids jostling around in the jar anymore, and it feels like you're shaking a thick cream inside the jar. Chill the whipped cream in the refrigerator while you cook the waffles.",

      "6. When a waffle is done, use tongs to remove it from the waffle iron. Sprinkle the cinnamon and sugar on the waffles immediately. Don't wait for the waffles to cool off because the cinnamon and sugar will not stick as well. Set waffle aside and cook the remaining batter. You probably will not use all the sugar, so save the leftovers in a sandwich bag.",

Priorities. After a few tweaks, I am very happy to say that this soup turned out perfectly in the end! This soup is now in my standard rotation and I have made it dozens of times. It's pretty foolproof and turns out every time. Enjoy!"

      "While your pie is cooking lightly spoon the flour into a measuring cup then use a knife to level everything out. Combine the flour and brown sugar in a bowl. Mix with a fork or your hands to combine. Add your super chilled butter and cut it into the flour mixture using the fingertips of your hands, ensuring the butter is completely covered and coated with your mixture. Finally, add in the pecans and toss to combine.",

While being careful to avoid the crust, sprinkle your crumble topping across the entire surface of the pie. Put it back in your oven for an additional 40 minutes, or until the center has set. Remove it from the oven. Let your pie cool on a wire rack for 10-20 minutes before cutting, serving and devouring."

With piping tip 1/2 inch above the template , pipe 1 1/2 inch circles onto parchment paper lined baking sheets.

      "Brush the tops of each macaron with a light coat of glaze and sprinkle with about an 1/8 teaspoon or less of cinnamon sugar each. Set aside and let the glaze dry.",
      "FOR THE FILLING:",
      "In a stand mixer, beat the butter until fluffy. Add the powdered sugar and salt and mix until well combined. Then add 1/4 cup dulce de leche and mix until fully incorporated. Place the mixture in a piping bag or Ziplock bag with the tip cut off.",

    "title": "how to make perfect meringue",
    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "1. First start out with eggs that are 3-4 days old preferably.",
      "2. Separate the egg yolks so that your egg whites are clean and there is no yolk in the egg whites. The smallest amount will ruin the egg whites. Put the whites in a medium sized glass, stainless-steel or copper bowl.",
      "3. Bring the egg whites to room temperature for 20 minutes before beating. Room temperature egg whites will foam 6-8 more times their original volume, compared to cold eggs.",
      "4. Next, beat the egg whites on medium until they begin to form peaks. At this point the peaks will curl over when the beaters are lifted.",
      "After the egg whites have begun to form a peak that curls over when the beaters are lifted, add the sugar. A general rule to follow is adding 1/4 cups of sugar per egg, adding it one tablespoon at a time. The sugar must be added gradually as the egg whites are beaten to stiff peaks (tips stand straight). Adding the sugar too quickly will knock air out of the egg whites and make them difficult to mix thoroughly. Beat eggs on high speed until the sugar has dissolved. To test rub a small amount of meringue between your fingers or taste a small amount and if it feels gritty it is not completely dissolved. Keep whipping until it feels smooth without any grit feeling.",
      "5. The meringue is done when it is not runny, there are no bubbles and when it's stiff enough that when held upside down on a spoon it will not drop off and peaks stand straight. You can also tell if it holds its shape on the beaters or swirl meringue with a spatula and see if it holds it shape.",
      "This is very easy to do, I have done it 100 times but make sure that you do not over-beat the egg whites or they will turn yellow when you bake it.",
      "6. It is best to pour meringue onto a hot pie filling so that the bottom of the meringue begins to cook. The heat from the pie filling cooks the base of the meringue making it less prone to leaking or shrinking.",
      "7. You want to cover the entire area of the pie making sure you completely cover the edge of the crust. This helps the bottom of the meringue cook and stick to the filling so it will not slide off the pie when it is cut. Use a small spoon or spatula to make high peaks and decorative swirls before baking by curling and twisting the meringue peaks.",
      "Bake the meringue on top of your pie at 325 F for 20 to 30 minutes. It's best to cook the meringue at a lower temp (325 F) and bake longer, than at a higher temp and bake quicker.",
      "8. To cut the pie and meringue use a knife dipped in cold water."

      "This soup is so easy, and you really can change it around to suit your taste!",
      "Combine seasonings in a small bowl. Sprinkle chicken breasts with half of the seasonings. Heat a large soup pot over medium high heat. Once it's hot, add the chicken and sear a nice crust on both sides. Do this by only turning them once per side. Cook for roughly 5-6 minutes per side or until no longer pink (time will depend on thickness of chicken). Remove chicken to a plate and let it rest while you prepare the soup base.",
      "Add the onions, carrots and potatoes into the pot and saute on medium until golden, then add the second half of the seasonings and stir. Add the pumpkin and the applesauce to the veggies.",
      "Put the whole chicken breasts back into the pot and coat with the veggies.",
      "Add the chicken stock or water. I really have no idea how much I added, I lost count after the third addition! I say go by the size of the pan and your preferred soup consistency. Add a dash or two of additional salt to compensate if you added water and not stock.",
      "Add 3/4 of the cornstarch into a cup with a dash of water. Mix to combine. Then add it into the soup pot.",
      "Bring to a boil, then turn down to simmer and cook for a good 45 minutes to an hour. You want that chicken breast to get as tender as possible so it will just fall apart with a folk in a bit.",
      "Now you will want to take the lid off, remove the chicken from the pot to a cutting board and shred the chicken with a folk. Add it back into the pot.",
      "Keep the lid off, turn heat to low and let the soup cool a bit. Now the scary part: incorporating the milk without curdling it! Let the soup cool down while you heat up the milk in a small saucepan to medium-hot, then stir in the remaining cornstarch. Ladle some of the hot soup mixture into the milk, stir to combine then add it back into the whole soup pot. You can also use heavy cream. If you do just use less than the amount I have listed for milk. The more fat the milk has the less likely it is to curdle. Good excuse for using cream!",
      "Add the pasta, broccoli and the green peas, and keep the lid off; let it cook for another 30 minutes or so, stirring often so the pasta doesn't stick together. Gluten-free pasta has a tendency to do this!",

With a grapefruit spoon or regular spoon take out the orange pulp by scrapping the insides of the wall of the orange. I also found that using your fingers to pull out the pulp works great. You need a little patience here. Be careful to not poke through the skin-otherwise it won't work as a cup. Some oranges are easier to get the pulp out than others. Put the orange pulp into a bowl to eat or put into a smoothie or other.",

      "1. Place the warm water, yeast and half of the sugar into the bowl of a stand mixer or other large bowl. Let it sit for 10-15 minutes, until frothy and foamy. Add in the salt.",
      "2. With the paddle attached, turn the mixer on low and add in the flour 1/2 cup at a time (or, stir vigorously with a wet wooden spoon if not using a mixer).",
      "3. Once you've added the flour and the mixture has come together and is pulling away from the sides of the bowl, switch to the dough hook and knead on medium-low for 5 minutes. Or you can turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead by hand for five minutes.",
      "4. Place the dough in a bowl oiled with the teaspoon of olive oil, cover with a towel and let it sit for 90 minutes or until doubled in size.",
      "5. Once risen, preheat your oven to 450 F. Prepare a baking sheet by lining it with parchment paper then greasing it lightly with cooking spray. Divide the dough into 8 pieces. Take one piece of dough, dust very lightly with flour, then roll it out on your counter or a large cutting board into a long strip. It's best to use two hands and start in the center, rolling the dough and moving your hands in opposite directions out onto the ends. This helps keep the strip even, rather than being too heavy in the middle and thin on the ends. Pick up the rolled out strip by both ends so it makes a large U. Gently touch the bottom of the \"U\" shape down onto the greased parchment paper, then cross the left end over to the right side, and the right side over to the left side to make a pretzel shape. Gently press down the ends to help it stick to the base of the pretzel. Repeat with remaining 7 pieces of dough. Let the pretzels rest for 15 minutes to rise.",
      "6. Meanwhile, bring a shallow pot of water to a boil over high heat, then add in the baking soda and remaining half of the sugar. Reduce the heat to low as soon as the 15 minutes of rise time is up. Place four pretzels into the water and let them cook for 1 minute. Flip them over using a slotted spoon or pancake turner and let the other side cook for one minute. Use the slotted spoon to remove the pretzels from the water and place back onto the prepared baking sheet. Repeat with remaining four pretzels.",
      "7. Pour the garlic powder and 2 tablespoons olive oil in a shallow bowl. One by one, dredge the poached pretzels through the oil so they are nice and coated. Return to baking sheet. Dust the oiled pretzels with paprika, oregano, and sea salt.",
      "8. Bake in the preheated oven for 12 minutes. After 12 minutes, turn off the bake setting and turn the broiler on low. Let the pretzels broil for 2 minutes. Remove from oven and let the pretzels cool on a wire rack. Serve warm.",

    "ingredients": [],

      "1. Preheat oven according to the pumpkin bar mix box instructions. Get out an 8x8x2\" baking dish and grease evenly with cooking spray. Line dish with parchment paper so that it covers the bottom and hangs over two sides by about 2\". This will make \"handles\" which will make lifting bars out of the pan super easy, once baked.",
      "2. My box mix just called for melted butter. Why not kick the flavor up a notch and brown it? So, brown that glorious stick of butter.",
      "To do this: In a small saucepan, add your stick of butter. Over gentle heat, about medium level, melt the butter. Once butter is all the way melted it will boil and froth. At this point, watch carefully because things will move quickly now. You can swirl the pan around a bit. Once the bubbles die down and leave only froth, you will start to smell a nutty scent! Almost there! Swirl pan around again-you should see a light golden brown color and smell a very nutty scent. Once that happens cook another 5-10 seconds and remove pan from heat. Pour into a bowl to cool (and stop the cooking). You're looking for a gorgeous golden amber color!",
      "3. Prepare pumpkin bar batter according to your box's instructions. For this particular box mix, I needed 2 large eggs and 1 stick of melted butter (which I browned). I also love this mix because there's little chocolate chips throughout the batter! Yum! Pour batter into the prepared dish and smooth top. Throw pan into oven and bake, again according to your box's instructions.",
      "4. As soon as your bars are done, remove from oven and sprinkle the top with your entire package of mini chocolate peanut butter cups! Feel free to move the cups around a bit as they melt, so that the entire surface is covered evenly. I chose to let the cups retain some shape, so I could show my friends what was on top. If you're not into that, just swirl melting cups around to your liking.",
      "5. Allow bars to sit until cool to the touch, then gently lift out of pan with those parchment \"handles\" hanging from the sides. With a clean, sharp knife, cut bars into 15-16 squares and place on a platter to cool completely.",
      "Enjoy slightly warm or at room temperature! Bars are best served the day of, but can be stored in an airtight container in fridge, for up to 24 hours.",
      "Makes approximately 15-16 bars."

My perfect time for beating the egg whites is 2 minutes on speed 4, then 2 minutes on speed 6 and then another 2 minutes on speed 8. At this point they should stay put if you hold the bowl upside-down.",

Then fold mixture onto itself until it becomes shiny again (another 30-40 strokes). When you lift up the spatula, there should be solid, thick ribbons that run off (this whole process should take no more than about 50 strokes).",

      "Notes:",
      "- Makes about 50 macarons.",
      "- If using parchment paper (as opposed to a silicone mat) using small magnets help keep the paper flat while piping the batter. If you do this just be sure to remove magnets before baking.",
      "- Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 5 days (or freeze them for up to one month), Then allow them to come to room temperature before eating.",
      "- The shells only can also be frozen before adding any filling; allow them to come to room temperature before filling.",

      "Start by cooking the chicken. Heat the the olive oil in a pot over medium heat. Add the chicken and cook until it starts to turn just slightly white. Add the coconut milk, chicken broth, red curry paste, and brown sugar, and bring to a boil. Then turn heat down and add the peppers, onions, ginger, cashews, lemon juice, reserved pumpkin chunks and mashed pumpkin. Add garlic salt, salt and pepper, and ground red pepper, to taste. The more red pepper, the spicier it will be. Allow to simmer for about 15 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender and the chicken is thoroughly cooked. You will especially want to check the pumpkin; make sure it is still somewhat firm on the outside but soft on the inside (like a cooked potato). Garnish with fresh basil leaves and enjoy!"

      "For mixing the filling and baking the pie you will also need:",
      "1. A blender or food processor.",
      "2. A standing mixer and bowl or a large mixing bowl and a hand mixer.",
      "3. A 9-inch pie pan.",
      "4. Aluminum foil.",
      "5. A cooling rack.",
      "For the filling and baking the pie:",
      "1. Preheat the oven to 450 F.",
      "2. In the bowl of the mixer or in a large mixing bowl, mix together the pumpkin and brown sugar.",
      "3. Add the cinnamon, salt, ginger, cloves and beaten eggs and mix well.",
      "4. Mix in the milk and then mix in the powdered gingersnaps.",
      "5. Pour the filling into the partially baked pie shell. See the directions for the pie crust below. Fold strips of aluminum foil around the pie crust to lightly enclose the edges. An illustration is provided in the related link. Covered in this way, the crust will brown without burning.",
      "6. Bake the pie at 450 F for 10 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 350 F and continue baking the pie for 25 minutes more. Then remove it from the oven.",
      "7. Cool the pie completely on a wire rack before cutting it into slices. As mentioned above in the timing note, the pie is best made a day in advance, covered and refrigerated overnight before serving it the following day.",
      "You will also need for making the pie crust (in addition to the 9-inch pie pan):",
      "1. A food processor fitted with a rotary chopping blade is not essential but is a very convenient way to mix the pastry; it may also be mixed by hand.",
      "2. A pastry board and rolling pin.",
      "3. A piece of parchment paper about as large as the pie pan.",
      "4. Dried beans or a pie pan that will fit down inside the one used for the pie.",
      "5. A cooling rack.",
      "For the pie crust and blind-baking it:",
      "1. Preheat the oven to 400 F. Mix together the flour, salt and baking powder and pour them in the bowl of the processor. Add the butter, which has been cut into bits, and the shortening. Cut the butter and shortening into the flour by pressing the Pulse button on and off until the mixture is well combined. The butter and shortening may instead be worked into the flour by hand until it has a crumbly texture.",
      "2. In a small cup mix together the cider vinegar and ice water. Turn on the processor and, with one hand pressed firmly down on the lid of the processor, pour the liquid slowly through the tube. Pressing down on the lid prevents any jerky motion of the processor as the dough forms. As soon as the mixture pulls away from the sides of the processor and forms a cohesive mass, turn off the machine. If making the pastry by hand, the liquid may be added gradually while stirring with a fork or wooden spoon. As soon as the dough becomes cohesive, stop mixing it.",
      "3. Flour your hands a little. If the dough is made in the processor, remove the blade, scraping off any pastry that clings to it. Collect the dough into a ball and turn it out onto a floured pastry board. Sprinkle it with a little flour.",
      "4. The dough rolls out well without first chilling it. But if you do not wish to roll the dough out right away, wrap it in waxed paper and refrigerate it. Chilled pastry made with a combination of shortening and butter will need to rest for about 5 minutes at room temperature before rolling it out in order for the butter to warm up a bit.",
      "5. Roll out the dough to a size large enough to fit into the pan with a small overhang. Trim off any overhanging edges of the pastry and press all around the rim with the tines of a fork to form a decorative edge on the crust or make a crimped border with your fingers.",
      "6. Place the parchment paper in the empty unbaked shell. Fill the parchment-lined shell with dried beans to weigh down the bottom of the pastry and prop up the sides of it during 'blind' baking (i.e. the preliminary baking before the filling is added). A pie pan that fits snugly inside the larger one holding the pastry may be placed on the parchment and used instead of beans for blind-baking the crust. (A photo in the related link illustrates using a pan instead of beans as a weight for the crust.)",
      "7. Bake the shell for 12 minutes at 400 F. Then take the pie shell from the oven and remove the parchment and beans (or the parchment and smaller pie pan). Set the partially baked shell on a cooling rack to cool and use for making the pie.",
      "Acknowledgements: This Gingersnap Pumpkin Pie recipe is adapted from Mrs. Earline Hicks' recipe in 'A Date With a Dish'. The pie crust recipe is an adaptation of one from The King Arthur Flour website.",
      "A final suggestion: You may go to a free online version of Freda DeKnight's cookbook 'A Date With A Dish' (1948). You'll find this on the related link. The book was republished in 1962 under a new title ('The Ebony Cookbook'), but Mrs. DeKnight's vivid sketches of the personalities behind the recipes which appear in the original are omitted from the later version.)"

      "3. In a medium sized bowl whisk your egg whites and salt until your whites are frothy. This should take about 3-5 minutes of hand whisking. If you choose to do so in a stand mixer (or use a hand mixer) just beat until frothy, not soft peaks.",
      "4. Once your egg whites are frothy, mix in your melted and cooled coconut oil and your honey. Combine well.",
      "**If you are doing this recipe egg-free, just omit step 3 and 4 and add your salt, oil and honey directly into your oat mixture.",
      "5. Pour your egg mixture over your oat mixture and combine completely and thoroughly. There will be a tendency for dried oats to sink to the bottom so make sure you mix very very well.",
      "6. Once combined, divide your granola between your two cookie pans (or more if your pans are on the smaller side) and spread it out so that it's a nice 1/4-1/2\" layer. No need to press down really, just make sure it's spread out nice and evenly.",
      "7. Bake 15-20 minutes on that upper rack, turning your pan halfway through baking time to insure even browning and baking. Remove pans from oven, and flip and toss granola in the pans breaking up any large pieces with a spatula. Make sure to bring the sides into the middle (they will want to brown quicker than the middle) and move the middle out. Stir and mix up well. Then spread it out so it's a single layer again.",
      "8. Bake another 10 minutes or until your granola is crispy and a golden brown throughout. Again, watch the sides of bottom of the granola. If it's darkening too much, simply remove pan from oven, stir it up again, and put the pan back in the oven.",
      "9. Remove pans from oven and allow granola to cool completely. Once cooled, add granola to a large bowl and mix in your cranberries as well as your raisins. Then simply put it into a large airtight container and munch away!",

      "For the whipped cream topping:",
      "In a food processor, process heavy cream until slightly thickened. Add vanilla bean powder and maple syrup, and process until thick and firm enough for piping. Making the whipped cream in the food processor results in a much firmer topping that is perfect for piping decoratively, but if you are going to serve the cheesecake right away, you can certainly make the whipped cream in your stand mixer.",
      "Pipe whipped cream on top of cheesecakes, and sprinkle with a dash of cinnamon, colorful sprinkles, Biscoff cookie crumbs or pecans. The cheesecakes keep for 3 days covered in the fridge.",
      "If you aren't using all of the cheesecakes right away, place them (without whipped cream) in single layers separated by parchment paper, in an airtight container, and freeze for up to one month. Thaw in the refrigerator before topping and serving.",

This is also suitable for vegetarians, just omit the red food colouring. In Thailand, green colouring can be derived from Pandan leaves-not only is the colour good, but the smell is also divine. We also use freshly grated coconut for this sweet treat back home."

Once melted pour one of the bowls of eggs into the skillet and swirl to coat the pan completely. Once the eggs are almost set, either slice the circle of egg in half and flip each half or flip the whole thing carefully and cut in half once removed from the pan.

      "1. Preheat your oven to 425\u00b0F and line your baking sheet with parchment paper.",
      "2. In a large mixing bowl add flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, and ginger. Mix together on very low speed just until incorporated.",
      "3. Add the chopped, cold, butter and mix on low until the butter mixes in and the clumps are about the size of large peas. You may need to use a fork at first and then the mixer paddle.",
      "4. In a small bowl mix together the pumpkin, milk or half-and-half, and egg. Stir together. Slowly add the mixture to the flour mixture at a low speed. Stir until just mixed together.",
      "5. Lightly dust your counter with flour so that the dough won't stick. With a rubber spatula, stir the dough in the bowl to be sure all the flour is mixed in from the bottom, and shape the dough into a ball (or clump in my case). Pour the dough onto the floured counter and gently press into circle, about an inch thick. You may need extra flour on the top, or re-flour the counter during this.",
      "6. Once your dough is in a flat circle, 1 inch thick, take a knife (I put a little flour on the blade) and cut a '+' in the circle so that you have divided it into 4 large pieces. Then cut an 'x' on that, so that it's divided into 8 pieces.",
      "7. Gently lift each piece out and place it on the parchment paper baking sheet; leave room between each piece. Bake 15-17 minutes, until lightly browned. Transfer to a wire rack and let cool completely.",
      "8. Once the scones are cool, prepare the icing. Heat the milk in a heat proof bowl or cup in the microwave for 30 seconds or until hot. Place the chai tea bag in the milk and let steep for about 5 minutes.",
      "9. In a small bowl add the confectioners sugar and chai-flavored milk and stir together until the sugar has dissolved completely. (Here's my new trick: Let the icing stand for 3-5 minutes until it starts to get thick.) Now ice your scones in whatever design you'd like: drizzle, dunk, whatever.

It's much easier to slice the blondies if you chill them well in the refrigerator first, otherwise the gooey marshmallow just kind of drags all over the place. Slice with a sharp thin knife and serve at room temperature. Blondies will keep at room temperature in an airtight container for 4 days.",

      "In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, cinnamon, ginger, allspice, and salt. Set aside.",
      "In the bowl of a stand mixer, beat together the sugar, brown sugar, pumpkin puree, eggs, and sour cream. With the mixer running on low speed, slowly add the flour mixture. Add the brown butter and mix until it is fully incorporated and the batter is smooth.",
      "Divide the batter between the prepared cake pans. I use a scale to weigh the pans and make sure they are even. Smooth the tops of the batter and place the pans in the oven to bake. Bake until the tops turn a light golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the middle of each cake comes out clean, about 30-40 minutes.",
      "Remove the cakes from the oven and let sit in the pans for 10 minutes. Carefully remove the cakes from the pans and remove the parchment paper from the bottom of each cake. Place the cakes on a cooling rack to cool completely.",
      "While the cakes are cooling, make the toasted marshmallow filling. Turn the oven temperature up to broil, or 500 degrees F if you don't have a broiler. Place the marshmallows on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or a silicone mat.",
      "Broil the marshmallows until the tops turn a light golden brown. Remove the baking sheet from the oven and carefully turn the marshmallows over. Place the marshmallows back in the broiler and bake until they turn golden brown. Remove the marshmallows from the oven and let sit until cool (they will deflate while cooling).",
      "In the bowl of a stand mixer, beat together the butter and confectioner's sugar until light and fluffy. Add the vanilla and mix until incorporated. Add the toasted marshmallows and marshmallow fluff and mix on medium-low speed until the filling is smooth and fluffy.",
      "Set the filling aside, and then make the cinnamon Swiss meringue buttercream. In the bowl of a stand mixer, combine the egg whites, sugar, and salt. Place the bowl over a pot of simmering water. Whisk constantly (I use a hand mixer) until the sugar is dissolved and the mixture reaches about 150 degrees F.",
      "Take the bowl and attach it your mixer, fitted with the whisk attachment. Whisk the egg white mixture until it reaches room temperature and stiff peaks have formed, about 5-10 minutes. At this point the mixture will be thickened and white.",
      "With the mixer on low speed, add the butter, 2 tablespoon as a time. Once all the butter is added, raise the speed to medium high and mix until the mixture starts to come together. Remove the whisk attachment and replace with the beater attachment. Beat until the buttercream comes together fully and is smooth. This can take time, sometimes 2 minutes, and sometimes up to 10 minutes. Don't worry if you think you did something wrong, it will come together and create a smooth and creamy buttercream.",
      "Once the buttercream is silky and smooth, mix in the vanilla. Then add the cinnamon and mix until it has spread throughout the whole buttercream.",
      "Before assembling the cake, wrap each cake in plastic wrap and place in the freezer for about 20 minutes, just to firm it up. Cut each cake horizontally in half using a large serrated knife. This will create 4 even layers.",
      "To assemble the cake, place 1 cake on a cake stand or plate, bottom side down. (I assembled my cake on a cake turntable with a small cardboard on the bottom of the cake.) Spread 1/3 of the marshmallow filling on top of the cake. Place another cake on top, bottom/flat side up and spread 1/3 of the filling on top. Repeat with the third cake.",
      "Top with the last cake and using the cinnamon buttercream, frost a thin layer around the sides and top of the cake to seal in the crumbs (this is a crumb coat). Place the cake in the refrigerator, or freezer, to harden the crumb coat. Finish by frosting the cake with an even layer of buttercream on the sides and top of the cake, leaving about 1 cup of buttercream for decoration. Evenly smooth the buttercream with an offset spatula.",
      "To create the decoration on top, place the leftover buttercream in a piping bag fitted with a medium petal tip. Starting at one point on the top of the cake, hold the piping bag with the larger part of the tip facing in towards the center of the cake. Lightly applying pressure, move your piping bag in a back and forth motion, about 2-3 times upwards. Move onto the next row and do the same motion until you finish ruffling around the sides of the top of the cake.",
      "To create the dots on the bottom of the cake, change the tip of the piping bag to a small round piping top. Pipe small dots around the bottom of the cake.",
      "Place the cake back into the refrigerator or freezer to slightly firm up. Slice, serve, and enjoy!",

The dough should feel a little like Play Doh. Place dough into prepared springform pan, press dough into the bottom and up the sides of the pan. Once dough is pressed down, prick the dough in many places with a fork. This prevents the dough from forming air bubbles while cooking.",

Place foil-covered pan into a jellyroll pan and add enough water to cover the entire jellyroll pan but not enough to spill over the sides. Very carefully place in the preheated oven. Bake for 75 minutes. Turn heat off, crack open the oven door about 4 or 5 inches. Leave cheesecake in there for an additional 30 minutes. Once the 30 minutes are up, remove from the oven and cool in the pan on a wire rack for 30-45 minutes. Cover with plastic wrap and place in the refrigerator for at least 6 hours (overnight is best) before serving.",

      "You can do this one of two ways, depending on your personality. If you like things organized, work in layers, starting with half of the Greek yogurt and moving on with half of the sliced banana, blackberries, pomegranate arils, granola, and maple syrup. Then repeat with the remaining ingredients. You end up with a pretty winter parfait that is just as nice to look at as it is to eat.",
      "I'm all for organization and esthetics, but I hate fighting through the layers to get a little bit of every ingredient in one spoonful. I'm all about functionality when it comes to breakfast. I prefer to scoop all of the Greek yogurt into a bowl and then top with all of the topping ingredients. Which, in my opinion, is still pretty. And much less frustrating."
