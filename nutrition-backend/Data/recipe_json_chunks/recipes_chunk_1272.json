      "For the Meringue: Place egg whites in a mixer bowl. Boil the corn syrup, sugar and water in a saucepan using a candy thermometer. When the syrup reaches 240 degrees F remove it from heat. Turn the mixer on to medium and pour the syrup over the egg whites. Whip until the mixture cools. Keep meringue cool in the refrigerator.",
      "Assemble: Spoon the meringue into a pastry bag. Center a chocolate cake disk on individual serving dishes. Top with a small scoop of raspberry sorbet. Generously pipe meringue around the cake and ice cream, starting at the outer edge of the cake, and working your way up around the sorbet to a dramatic peak. Once all plates have meringue, use a mini blowtorch to lightly carmelize the meringue (may be found at most cooking supply stores). Garnish plate with fresh raspberries and chocolate shavings. Serve before your Alaska begins to melt!"

Put the egg yolks and castor sugar into a large bowl, and whisk them until pale in colour. Remove the vanilla pod from the cream, and pour the infused cream through a sieve into the egg mixture, whisking continuously until well blended. Return the mixture to the saucepan and cook over a low heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon for about five minutes, until the mixture has slightly thickened. Place six or eight small ramekins in a deep roasting dish and pour the custard into the ramekins. Place the roasting dish into the oven and carefully pour hot tap water into the tray so that the water rises three-quarters of the way up the sides of the ramekins. Bake in the oven for about 25 minutes, or until the custards have achieved a wobbly set. Remove the custards from the oven and set them on a rack for 20 minutes to cool. Place them in the fridge for at least two hours, to chill fully. One at a time, dust each cold custard with one tablespoon of sugar and immediately take a brulee branding iron or gas torch and caramelise each top.

Stir in Fontina cheese and cayenne and cook until cheese melts, about 5 more minutes. Spread some cheese sauce on the bottom of a medium baking dish and set the quenelles in a single layer. Cover with remaining sauce and bake 20 minutes or until bubbly and golden. Serve hot garnished with mushroom ribbons, a light dusting of nutmeg and shaved Parmesan cheese. Tomato roses are also a nice optional garnish"

Add peppercorns, mustard seed and teaspoon of horseradish Rinse the kirby cucumbers and remove any stems by carefully slicing off ends of cucumbers Slice either in halves or in quarters - your preference Quartered cucumbers will pickle faster so if you are in a rush this works best. Add slices to empty clean salad bar containers or glass mason jars The containers must be filled to the top and as air tight as you can make them I prefer mason jars with a sealing lid but in a pinch the quart containers from a salad bar work great too. Seal and let set on counter at room temperature for 48 hours and then refrigerate for 48 hours Pickles dont take longer than 5 days and only get better with time Enoy!"

With the machine running, add vodka and 2 tablespoons ice water and process until the dough just holds together, about 30 seconds. Squeeze a small amount of dough between your fingers -- if it is very crumbly, add more ice water, 1 tablespoon at a time (2 tablespoons maximum). Do not over process.",
      "Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and push together into a rough ball. Knead a few times to combine, then place on a piece of plastic wrap and push together using the plastic wrap to form a 5x7-inch rectangular slab. Refrigerate at least 1 hour (or overnight).",
      "Assemble the tart: Preheat oven to 375\u00b0F. In a small saute pan, heat 1 1/2 tablespoons each olive oil and butter over medium-low heat. Add the leek, salt, sugar and a pinch of pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, until soft and slightly caramelized, about 10 minutes. Transfer leeks to the bowl of a food processor and let cool slightly.",

      "Bring a large pot of well-salted water to a boil. Add the vegetables (if using red beets, cook in a separate pot so they don't bleed). Bring to a boil then turn down to a simmer and cook until tender but still holding their structure, about 10 minutes. Drain and set aside to cool slightly.",
      "On a floured piece of parchment paper, roll your dough to 12x15-inch rough rectangle. Place 1 1/2 to 2 cups of filling in the center of the dough and spread out, leaving a 2-inch border on all sides. Arrange your vegetable rounds in a shingled pattern over the filling, then gently fold up the sides to create a border. Brush the vegetables lightly with oil and brush the pastry edges with egg wash, sprinkle the galette with coarse sea salt. Bake until vegetables are lightly golden and pastry is golden brown, 45 to 50 minutes. Transfer baking sheet to a wire rack to cool.",
      "In a small bowl, combine the mustard, vinegar, lemon, garlic, and sugar. Gradually whisk in the oil and blend until emulsified. Taste and add 1/2 teaspoon warm water if necessary to balance flavors. Stir in the tarragon.",
      "Once galette has cooled, brush the vegetables with the mustard vinaigrette. Sprinkle with chopped tarragon, cut into squares, and serve warm or at room temperature.",
      "DO AHEAD: Dough can be made and refrigerated up to 3 days in advance, or frozen for up to 3 months; thaw in the refrigerator before using. Tart can be assembled and frozen for up to 3 months. Tarragon vinaigrette can be made up to 1 day in advance and refrigerated."

When nicely brown, add the onions and garlic, and steam-sautee until the onions are translucent. If the onions begin to stick add 1/4 cup of water or chicken broth and work some of the caramalized sugar off of the bottom of the pan (it is oh so tasty).

      "Butterfly tenderloin 3/4 of the way through so that when you fold it over you have one flat cut of meat. Place meat between two pieces of plastic wrap and pound out until it is between 1/4-1/2 inch thick. It should almost be a perfect rectangle. Roll it up in the plastic and place in the refrigerator. Next slice the onion into strips and cook in olive oil until they begin to sweat. Add the garlic & cook until it becomes arromatic. Throw in the mushrooms and brown slightly. If using fresh spinach, add it to the mixture & cook until it is wilted. Pour in brandy and cook the alcohol out. Remove from heat and cool. In a separate bowl mix sundried tomatoes, cheese and defrosted spinach. Add the cooled ingredients and salt and pepper to taste. Remove the tender from the frig and lay flat. Start by spreading all of the stuffing on one side of the meat, leaving enough room(1/2-3/4 in.)on the ends for it to spread out when you roll it. Begin to roll the meat evenly and as tight as posible. You should be rolling with the grain of the meat. Have some butcher string ready so you can tie it off after you have rolled it. Coat liberally with coarse salt and pepper(this is a very important step to ensure a good flavor profile of the meat itself). Either refrigerate or get a pan with olive oil and a pat of butter very hot without burning it. Preheat broiler to 450 degrees. Place tender in pan and sear on all sides to seal in the juices and flavor of the meat. Place pan in oven and broil until preferred doneness by using a meat thermometer. I usually cook it medium rare as it tends to cook a little more when you take it out of the oven to rest. Let sit for at least 10-15 minutes before cutting. Slice meat into desired thickness. I prefer 1/2 inch slices. Fan slices out on platter for the most beautiful presentation of your party entree. If you would like to serve with a sauce. Heat pan dripping on stove and add some red wine to it. Serve on side or drizzle over meat."

Off heat, add Marsala; return pan to high heat and simmer vigorously, scraping browned bits from pan bottom, until sauce is slightly syrupy and reduced to about 1 1/4 cups, about 5 minutes. Off heat, add lemon juice and any accumulated juices from chicken; whisk in butter 1 tablespoon at a time. Season to taste with salt and pepper, and stir in parsley.

      "Getting those hard-boiled eggs out of the shell can be quite a chore. I've found that the best way begins with the cooking. Boil your eggs for exactly ten minutes, then transfer them to a bowl of cold water immediately and leave them there for at least another ten minutes. This will stop the cooking of the eggs and ensure the easy removal of the shells. Once your eggs have cooled, take one and crack the shell, starting at the large end, where the little pocket of air usually is, and continue all the way around. Then, under running water, find or make a small tear in the membrane beneath the shell and let the water run between the membrane and the egg. The water will do most of the work for you and the egg will practically peel itself!"
