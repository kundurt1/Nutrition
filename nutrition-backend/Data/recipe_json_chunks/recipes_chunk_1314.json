Cook over medium heat until the gelatin dissolves and the mixture is very hot but not boiling, about 2 minutes. Whisking continuously, slowly drizzle the gelatin mixture into egg yolks. Return mixture to saucepan and cook, stirring constantly, until slightly thickened, about 2 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the creme de menthe and creme de cacao.

Scrape the mixture into the cooled pie shell, smooth the top, and refrigerate until firm, at least 6 hours or preferably overnight.

But once it boils do not cook for longer than 1 minute or you risk the curd thinning out again. Remove from heat and strain into a bowl. Whisk in butter, olive oil and lemon zest.",

Sprinkle with confectioners' sugar and flaky sea salt right before serving."

After the first rise, turn the dough on to a work surface and gently work into a round loaf. Don't knead it or over work the dough. Let the loaf rise for 1-2 hours. Preheat a dutch oven at 550F. When the second rise is done, bake the loaf at 500F for 30 minutes covered. If you want a hearty crust, bake uncovered for 5-10 minutes. Once it is done, let the loaf cool on a rack for 30 minutes."

Spread each slice of bread with 1 teaspoon of butter, then sprinkle each slice with one teaspoon of the cinnamon-sugar mixture. Toast the trays of bread in the oven until the bread is golden, and until the cinnamon-sugar makes a caramelized crunch on top, for about 7 to 10 minutes.

(You might have a little butter leftover but I wanted to build in some leeway in case, understandably, you weren't buttering your bread with precise teaspoon measurements!) Cut two slices of the cinnamon toast in half horizontally. Arrange the cinnamon toast down in two rows along the width of the pan. Begin with the bottom half of one slice of toast, then fan 7 more slices in a row, finishing with the top half of the slice. This ensures that those served the end pieces of the baked French toast are not stiffed with thin slices! Repeat with another 7 full slices and 1 halved slice of cinnamon toast in the second row. Whisk the milk, eggs, salt and vanilla in a medium bowl and pour evenly over cinnamon toast in baking dish. Let sit for 15 minutes (or overnight, if you're preparing this ahead of time) so that the custard absorbs a bit.",

Bake for 30 minutes, until puffed and golden and until no liquid seeps out of the toasts when they are nudged about in the pan. Cut into squares and serve plain, or with a dollop of plain yogurt and fresh berries, or maple syrup."

Think of 15 minutes per lb as about 33 minutes for every 2lbs. I usually do 15 minutes per lb and then add on an extra 5 minutes so that those who don't like rare meat have a bit of slightly more cooked beef from the ends. Those who don't like blood don't have to get it: the rest of us gratifyingly do. If you want it medium rare, I should reckon on 20 minutes per pound or 44 minutes for every 2lbs.",

      "In a medium saucepan over medium-high heat, saute the onion and garlic in the oil until translucent, 3 to 4 minutes. Add 3 tablespoons salt after the onion and garlic have cooked for 30 seconds or so. Add the rosemary and cook to heat it, 30 seconds or so. Add the water and lemon, squeezing the juice from the wedges into the water and removing any seeds. Bring the water to a simmer, stirring to dissolve the salt. Remove from the heat and allow the brine to cool. Refrigerate until chilled.",

Refrigerate for 8 to 24 hours, agitating the bag occasionally to redistribute the brine and the chicken.",

The chicken can be refrigerated for up to 3 days before you cook it, or it can be cooked immediately.

Pour the buttermilk into a third bowl. Set a rack on a baking sheet/tray. Dredge the chicken in the flour, shake off the excess, and set the dusted pieces on the rack. Dip the pieces in the buttermilk, then dredge them aggressively in the second bowl of flour and return them to the rack.",
      "Heat oil in a pan for deep-frying to 350\u00b0F/180\u00b0C. Add as many chicken pieces as you can without crowding the pan. Cook the chicken, turning the pieces occasionally, until they are cooked through, 12 to 15 minutes depending on their size. Remove to a clean rack and allow them to rest for 5 to 10 minutes before serving."

Stir thoroughly, and allow to boil covered for another 5 minutes. Stir again (an oven mitt will be useful to prevent burns from splatters), reduce heat, and simmer until desired thickness, stirring often, about 1 hour. Put in jars and process as desired."

Next stir or whisk in preserves, vinegar, sugar, mustard, and berries, and cook until about half of the berries burst and mixture is bubbling, about 10 minutes. Lower fire slightly and simmer until compote thickens and coats the back of a spoon. Stir in butter slowly until melted. Serve over your cut of choice. The juice released in your mouth by the whole berries is such a nice, decadent surprise."
