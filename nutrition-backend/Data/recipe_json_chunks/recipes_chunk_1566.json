      "First, set your raisins to soak. If you do not want raisins and orange peel, or just want plain raisins, just skip this step. In a Ziplock baggie, add the raisins and rum and allow raisins to soak. Set aside. Dice up the orange peel and set aside.(See my TastyKitchen recipe box for my Candied Orange Peel).",
      "Preheat the oven to 375 F. I use 2 pie tins lined with parchment for the loaves. (I have tried free-form but it spreads a little too much for my taste).",
      "I like to pulse my oats in the food processor about 6-8 times. So do that next. Into the food processor bowl add the other dry ingredients (flour through salt on the above list-not the fruit). Pulse a couple times to blend.",
      "Dice your cube of butter and add it into the dry ingredients. Pulse about 6-8 times until it is in small bits in the flour mixture. If you do not use a food processor, use a pastry cutter to cut the butter into the dry ingredients. Pour all this into a large mixing bowl.",
      "Now you can add your raisins, rum and all, and the candied orange peel. Mix thoroughly into the dry ingredients.",
      "Pour the buttermilk in and mix, either with a Danish whisk or wooden spoon. Mix it until it is a whole cohesive mass. Like biscuits and scones, you do not want to over-mix. If it looks too dry, drizzle in more buttermilk until it comes together.",
      "Put some flour onto a counter or cutting board. Flip the dough out onto the floured surface. Knead a few times, just 3 or 4 turns, adding fingers full of flour as needed if it is too sticky. It should be tacky, but not too goopy. Only knead enough to bring it together and give it shape.",
      "Here is where I cut the dough in half to make 2 smaller loaves, and I will tell you why. I have made this many times and it says it makes 1 loaf. But what happens is the outsides get very done and the middle is still doughy. I end up cutting out the middle and end up with an Irish donut! So now I cut the dough in half and shape each into a nice round. Place each round into a parchment lined pie pan. Cut a large cross on top, about 1/2 inch deep or so. I sometimes sprinkle a little flour or sugar over the top. Place both pans onto a cookie sheet and put in the preheated oven.",
      "Set the time for 30 minutes. After that, check the loaves. Make sure a straw inserted in the center comes out clean. It will probably have to go back in for another 5-8 minutes or even more, depending on your oven. I always use an instant read thermometer and bake it until it is approximately 180 F. Usually that means putting it back in the oven a couple times. It should have some browning on top and not look wet in the cross part. Let cool in pans 5 minutes, then set on wire racks. It tastes even better the next day."

      "Note: Making the Pavlovas on the day they are going to be used is best because of their soft, moist consistency. Keeping them in a cool place after they are baked is also preferable. Put the Chocolate Pavlovas together right before serving them so that the soft meringues don't become soggy.",
      "1. Preheat the oven to 250 F. Cut a piece of parchment paper to fit a baking sheet. Streak the baking sheet with butter so that the parchment paper doesn't move around then line the sheet with the paper.",
      "2. Mix the sugar and cornstarch together. Set aside. Beat the egg whites and lemon juice until they begin to froth, then gradually add the sugar and cornstarch. When the egg whites become stiff, beat a little more and add the vanilla. When they are stiff enough, the egg whites will not move in an upturned bowl.",
      "3. With a large ice cream scoop or spoon, place 6 balls of the Pavlova mixture (about 1/2 cup each) on the baking sheet. Then, with the rounded side of a small ladle or spoon, press down and around to form a hollow in the center of each of them. This will transform the balls into discs of about 4-inches in diameter ... and if they aren't all quite that size, don't worry about it.",
      "4. Place the Pavlovas in the preheated oven. Leave the oven door half open and bake the Pavlovas for 1 hour and 30 minutes. At the end of that time, they will have a thin, crisp outer layer. The insides will be soft. For Pavlovas, this is how it should be. Take them out of the oven and place them on a cooling rack.",
      "5. Break the chocolate into pieces and put it in the top part of a double boiler or in a homemade one made by fitting a heatproof bowl into the top of a pot partially filled with water. (The water should not quite touch the bottom of the bowl placed over it.) Melt the chocolate over the pot of simmering water. Once melted, set the double boiler aside off the heat-still with the chocolate sitting over the hot water. The chocolate will cool but not harden. If for some reason the chocolate is left until it begins to solidify, warm it a little just before folding it into the whipped cream.",
      "6. Whip the heavy cream and as it forms soft mounds, gradually add the powdered sugar. The cream is done when it does not slide up the side of a tilted bowl.",
      "7. Fold in the melted chocolate and the salt.",
      "8. Cover and refrigerate the chocolate mousse until you put together the Chocolate Pavlovas-that is, just before serving them.",
      "9. To assemble the Pavlovas, place a Pavlova meringues on each dessert plate and place a scoop of chocolate mousse in the middle of each meringue. Sprinkle some toasted almonds over the mousse and sieve cocoa powder and powdered sugar over each plate. A fresh dark cherry at the side of each dessert looks pretty."

      "Combine sugar, Karo syrup and hot water. With the heat on high, boil that stuff with a candy thermometer alongside of it.",
      "Once it starts to boil, it should take 15 minutes to get to 260 degrees. If you get there too soon, it might burn it- that's the reason for the heavy pot. Watch your temperature as it climbs. It'll take longer to get to the last 15 degrees or so.",
      "At some point in all of this, you'll need to beat 4 large egg whites in your mixer. You can start this near the end of the boiling stage or begin now and leave the syrup cooking on low. You want stiff peaks.",
      "With the mixer still running, pour the syrup mixture in s-l-o-w-l-y, but consistently and keep that joker on high.",
      "After you've put in the syrup, and while it's mixing away, add baking powder and salt.",
      "After it's mixed for about five minutes and is thickening, add vanilla. If you like pecans in yours, put some in and mix by hand so you don't tear up your mixer.",
      "Now, my mom makes hers by dropping them by rounded tablespoonfuls onto waxed paper. That's fine, but the stuff gets firm pretty quick and dropping them by spoonfuls is time consuming, so I pour mine onto a baking sheet covered in waxed paper to cut into bars. I've also learned a trick to grease the bottom of the baking sheet before I line it with waxed paper. That way, the paper adheres to the pan and doesn't slide around while I'm trying to wrestle the quickly hardening candy out of the bowl.",
      "And it really doesn't want to come out of the bowl, but if you work quickly and don't worry about scraping the bowl clean, you will get most of the candy onto the waxed paper. Spread it around as quickly as you can, to even it out. I sometimes use an offset spatula to try and cover it evenly.",
      "You can either flip that joker over and cut into squares, or you can cut it right in the pan. I like to let it cool to room temperature before cutting. Plus, I'm probably making another batch while this one cools. I peel off the waxed paper before cutting, so I don't cut the wax paper too. Plus remember there's grease on the backside of it, and I don't like to have to peel off little squares. A pizza cutter works nicely to make squares.",
      "You can get tiny cookie cutters and cut out shapes if you want; grease the cutters with butter or put them in warm water before each cut. That is rather tedious though, and it can be difficult to get the candy out without distorting the shape."

      "Third: Measure flour into sifter or sieve along with baking powder, espresso powder and cocoa powder. Sift together. (Note: Cocoa and espresso powder are optional, but I think it intensifies the chocolate flavor in a good way so I highly recommend them.)",
      "Fourth: Add dry ingredients to cream cheese mixture; mix thoroughly.",
      "Fifth: Heat oven to 375 degrees F. Force dough through a cookie press onto an ungreased baking sheet using a template of choice. Practice a few times until you get the hang of it. Return ugly cookies to the cookie press and try again.",
      "Because these are sandwich cookies, I use my finger, slightly dampened, to flatten the middle of half of the cookies so they will lay flat when turned upside down. Do this after you have pressed the cookies out on a cookie sheet. You'll see why when you start to assemble cookies.",
      "Note: If cookies won't stick to the tray when you squeeze the gun, the dough may be too warm; chill it a bit. If the dough is too cold, it will crumble. The cookie sheet should be cool, not warm out of the oven. The cookie sheet or silicone liner must not be greasy.",
      "Sixth: Bake for 10-12 minutes or until slightly browned. Cool.",
      "Prepare the filling by combining the butter and shortening, mixing well. Gradually beat in the sugar, espresso, and vanilla extract. Beat on high for 2-3 minutes until light and fluffy.",
      "Making the cookies:",
      "First: Fill pastry bag or zippered plastic bag (my preference) with filling. Use a 1/2-inch round or star tip or snip the corner of the plastic bag.",
      "Second: Pipe cream in teaspoon-sized blobs onto the bottom of the cookie halves you flattened in the fifth step above. (You could also do this with a knife, but it takes longer and isn't as pretty.)",
      "Third: Make a sandwich by topping with another cookie that was not flattened and press lightly to squash the filling evenly to the edges."

      "Let the crumbs cool completely before using in this recipe. The cookie recipe only calls for half of the cake crumbs, which is a heaping 1-cup full. Store extras in an airtight container for up to 1 week at room temperature or up to 1 month in the refrigerator or freezer.",
      "For the Confetti Cookies:",
      "Combine the butter, sugar and glucose in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment and cream on medium-high speed for 2-3 minutes. Scrape down the sides of the bowl and add the eggs and vanilla and mix for 7-8 minutes. At the end of 7-8 minutes the mixture should be very pale yellow and doubled in size. It should be very shiny, homogenous, fluffy and resemble a cloud.",

Note: don't walk away during this step, just to make sure that you don't over mix the dough. Scrape down the sides of the bowl.",

      "Scoop the dough onto a parchment- or Silpat-lined sheet pan using a 2 3/4 ounce ice cream scoop (mine is a #16), or use a 1/3 cup measuring cup. Flatten the cookies slightly and wrap the pan in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for at least one hour. I refrigerated mine overnight. Do not bake at room temperature or they won't bake correctly.",
      "When ready to bake, heat the oven to 350 F.",
      "Arrange the chilled dough a minimum of 4 inches apart on a parchment- or Silpat-lined baking sheet. Bake for 18 minutes. The cookies will puff, crackle and spread. After 18 minutes they should be very lightly browned on the edges. The centers will just slightly show a change in color. Leave the cookies in the oven for another minute or so if they seem doughy or the colors aren't quite right. Mine were perfect at exactly 18 minutes; I rotated the pans once, halfway through cooking.",
      "Cool the cookies completely on the sheet pans before transferring to store. At room temperature the cookies will keep for 5 days. They'll keep for 1 month in the freezer.",

Taste the sauce and add freshly ground pepper and also salt if necessary.",

The idea here is that it will cook quickly and give almost the illusion of macaroni and cheese if small enough. Toss cauliflower with sauce in a bowl and pour into a casserole dish. Cover with aluminum foil.",
      "Place the casserole dish on a cookie sheet to prevent any spills and bake for 30 minutes. After 30 minutes, remove the foil and bake uncovered for another 15. You can broil it briefly to encourage a browning on top. Let cool for 10 minutes before serving."

Whisk mixture constantly about 10-15 minutes until it reaches a temperature of 180\u00b0F and the custard coats the back of a spoon. (Unlike creme brulee, this custard will not go into the oven, so make sure you bring it to this temperature to be sure the eggs are cooked.) Remove the bowl from the heat and allow it to cool completely. The custard will also thicken as it cools. Once cooled, cover with plastic wrap, pressing the plastic directly onto the top of the custard to keep it from getting a skin, and then chill in the refrigerator overnight.",

Place them in a dish or pan so that you can easily move them to the refrigerator for chilling. Carefully remove the peach pits with a spoon and hollow the peaches out a bit. Make sure there is not much juice in the bowl of the peach or the custard will get runny. Spoon or pipe the custard into the centers of the peach so that the mixture is even with the top of the peach. Refrigerate until ready to serve.",
      "Sprinkle a thin layer of sugar; about 1 teaspoon each, on top of the custard filled peach. Caramelize the sugar using your kitchen torch. Remember to keep it moving for even coloring. Best served within an hour of caramelizing."

      "For the Meringata:",
      "Preheat oven to 225 degrees F. Position racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven.",
      "Line two baking sheets with parchment paper. It is helpful to double up your baking sheets if they are very thin-place the second sheet under the sheet lined with parchment paper.",
      "In the bowl of a stand mixer using the whisk attachment, beat egg whites and cream of tartar on medium speed until foamy. Increase the speed to high and beat until soft peaks form. Add the sugar, about a tablespoon at a time, and beat for 5 seconds between additions. Add the vanilla extract and continue to beat on high speed until stiff peaks form and meringue is glossy. This will take about 4 minutes.",
      "Transfer half of the meringue to a pastry bag fitted with a 1/2\" plain tip. Pipe the outline of a circle about 11\" wide on each cookie sheet-just eyeball it. Spoon the remaining meringue evenly into the center of each circle and spread to the edges making an even layer 1/2\" thick.",
      "Bake the meringues for about 1 1/2 hours, until pale but very dry. They shouldn't brown. Turn off the oven, prop the door open and let the meringues cool in the oven for several hours, until they are dry and crisp. If you are not filling the meringues right away you can go ahead and place each between pieces of parchment paper, wrap in plastic and freeze.",
      "For the mousse:",
      "Whisk together the lime zest, lime juice, eggs, sugar and salt in a small saucepan. Add the butter and whisk, cooking over medium-low heat, until it is thick enough to hold the marks of the whisk in the pan, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat.",
      "Press the mixture through a fine mesh sieve into a small bowl to remove any lumps. Quick chill the bowl of mousse by placing the bowl in a larger bowl filled with ice. Stir occasionally until room temperature, about 5 minutes.",
      "Whip the cream on medium speed until thickened. On low speed add 2 tablespoons powdered sugar and 1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract. Beat on high speed until stiff peaks form. Fold 1/2 of the cream into the lime mixture to lighten it, then fold in the remaining cream until just incorporated. Gently fold in the white chocolate chunks.",
      "For the topping:",
      "Combine blackberries, water and sugar in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil on high heat, stirring until sugar dissolves. Stir occasionally and continue to boil until sauce reduces slightly and thickens. Then remove from heat, cover the pan and refrigerate.",
      "For the sugared blackberries:",
      "Combine Just Whites and warm water in a small bowl, whisking for 2 minutes until whites are completely dissolved. Wash and dry the blackberries. Dip blackberries halfway into the egg white mixture, then into a small bowl of the granulated sugar. Lay them on a parchment lined baking sheet and allow to dry before using.",
      "Assembly:",
      "Place one meringue shell on a serving platter. Gently spread the lime mousse to within 1/2\" of the edge with a spatula. Top with the second meringue shell and press gently to adhere. Place in freezer for 15 minutes until slightly firm, then cover with plastic wrap and freeze 4-6 hours or up to 3 days ahead. Slice and serve as is or with blackberry sauce and sugared blackberries if desired."

Bring the water to a boil and remove the pan from the heat. Let sit covered for twelve minutes. Immediately submerge in ice water. To peel, crack the shell all over, start at the fat end and peel under cool running water. This method produces hard boiled eggs without the overcooked green ring around the yellow yolk."

    "title": "coconut flour pancakes with blueberry honey compote",
    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "Start by preparing your blueberry topping, as it can simmer while making the pancake batter. In a small saucepan over low heat, add the frozen blueberries and honey or agave nectar and cover with a lid. If you are using fresh blueberries, add about a tablespoon of water. After about 3 minutes, check on the blueberries-once juices begin to seep out, add the cinnamon and stir well. Cover again and continue to heat blueberries for about 10 to 15 minutes, checking occasionally. The topping is ready when the juices formed are syrupy and the blueberries are plump and hot. If you're looking for thick syrup, simply mash the blueberries with a fork while they are cooking in the saucepan. This time, I kept the blueberries whole. Once ready, remove from heat and leave the cover on to keep warm.",
      "While blueberries are on the stove, prepare pancake batter. In a mixing bowl, combine all wet ingredients and beat together. Add the coconut flour, baking powder and salt and continue to mix until all clumps are smoothed out and you're left with a very thick batter. If you are using a mixer, you might need to scrape the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula to get the coconut flour fully integrated. Allow batter to sit for about 5 minutes.",
      "Heat a large skillet on medium-low. Once warm, spread a dollop of butter evenly over the skillet. Using a spoon or rubber spatula, portion out about 1/3 of the batter and shape it into a pancake on the skillet. Coconut flour pancakes need to be manipulated more than the standard all-purpose flour pancakes, as coconut flour tends to hold its shape. (Note: If your pancakes begin to melt around the edges, it is because there is not enough coconut flour in your batch. Add more coconut flour a teaspoon at a time until the batter stays together on the skillet.)",
      "Repeat this step for the remaining 2/3 of the batter (this recipe makes 3 medium-sized pancakes), giving each pancake plenty of space for flipping. Allow pancakes to sit on the skillet for about 7 to 10 minutes (yup, that's how long these bad boys need before flipping). Carefully work a large spatula under each pancake and gently flip (it is easy to \"break\" coconut pancakes, so the flipping process is the most difficult part about this recipe). Allow the pancakes to cook an additional 2 to 3 minutes then remove from heat.",
      "Top pancakes with the blueberry topping and confectioner's sugar (you know, to make them pretty). If you are looking for more sweetness, drizzle agave nectar, honey or pure maple syrup over the tops of the cakes."

      "For the cheesecake ice cream (yields about 3 cups):",
      "Cut cream cheese into small pieces and place into a blender or food processor. Add the lemon zest, sour cream, half-and-half, sugar and salt. Puree until very smooth. No chunks!",
      "Chill the mixture thoroughly in the refrigerator for 1 hour, then freeze it in your ice cream maker according to the manufacturer's instructions.",
      "Line a 9\" square pan with parchment paper (make sure some of the paper hangs over both ends of the pan-you'll use it as a handle to remove the frozen ice cream from the pan) and then spread the ice cream into the prepared pan, smoothing it out as much as possible. Freeze ice cream in the pan until it is completely frozen. This will take at least 2 hours.",
      "For the red velvet shortbread stars:",
      "In the bowl of a stand mixer, beat butter and sugar until the mixture is a bit fluffy. Add in the salt and flour and mix until just incorporated. Then add the cocoa powder and mix again. Carefully add the food coloring and vanilla, stirring until red coloring is evenly distributed. Divide dough into 2 equal portions and pat each into a 4\" round disc. Wrap each disc in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 2 hours.",
      "Once the dough is chilled, heat oven to 350\u00b0F. Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper and set aside.",
      "Lightly flour your work surface and rolling pin. Remove one dough disc from the refrigerator and roll to about 1/4\" thick. If the dough is sticky, just pick it up and pat into a round, flour your surface again, and roll out the dough again. I found that this second rolling did the trick every time. With a small star shaped cookie cutter (mine measured 2-1/4\" across), cut out star shapes and place them on your parchment lined cookie sheet. Sprinkle with red sugar. Bake for 11 to 13 minutes, taking care to not let the cookies brown. Let cookies rest on cookie sheet a couple minutes before removing them to a wire rack to cool completely.",
      "To assemble the patriotic ice cream sandwiches:",
      "Cut the ice cream around the edge of the pan and then gently remove the frozen slab of ice cream from the pan using the parchment paper overhang. Dip the same star cookie cutter you used for the cookies into a shallow bowl of hot water and start cutting out ice cream stars, dipping the cutter into the hot water in between each cut.",
      "Turn a star cookie upside down and place an ice cream star on top of the cookie (make sure to line up the edges). Top with another star cookie (right side up) and gently press together to make a sandwich. Repeat until all of the ice cream stars are used. You will have more star cookies than you need. Immediately place the ice cream sandwiches in the freezer to freeze thoroughly. Keep frozen until ready to serve.",

      "Make a very small (2 mm) hole at the bottom of each bag. By making a smaller hole, you get more control over where your chocolate goes. Pipe the chocolate into the center of your hearts. Then twist the lollipop sticks 360 degrees once done so that the stick is covered in chocolate all the way around. You can make some with white chocolate, some with milk chocolate and some with a combination. Again, this step will make sure your pops have a little more stability. They can be a little heavy in comparison to the sticks, and you don't want them falling off after all your hard work!",
      "Immediately top with decorative sprinkles and set them aside to cool completely before packaging in cello bags. (They should set for around 2-3 hours before packaging).",
      "And there you go-the perfect little sweet for your sweetie this Valentine's Day!"

You want the top to just be set, with still a bit of jiggle when you move the pan. At this point, remove the cake from the oven.",

      "This recipe makes four 1-pound loaves, and the dough will keep for 5 days in the refrigerator, or 4 weeks frozen.",
      "To make the dough, mix the yeast, salt, eggs, honey, melted butter or oil, and water in a bowl or container (at least 5-qt in size) that you can cover later. Using a wooden spoon (or a food processor or mixer with the dough attachment), mix in the flour. No need to knead. Mix until there are no more dry streaks of flour left.",
      "Cover (but not airtight) and let rest at room temperature for about 2 hours. The dough will rise and then fall down a bit. When it does, it's done and you can either use it immediately or store it in the refrigerator. The dough is quite sticky and easier to handle cold.",
      "When ready to bake, take a cookie sheet and either grease it, line it with parchment paper, or lay a silicone mat in it. Dust some flour on the surface of the dough and take a 1-pound chunk of dough (about the size of a grapefruit). Dust it with a bit more flour and quickly shape it the way you would a boule, gently pulling the sides of the dough toward the bottom while rotating the dough. It should take you less than a minute to do this.",
      "To make a braided loaf, divide the dough into three portions and roll each portion into a long rope. If the dough resists shaping, let it rest for 5 minutes and try again. When you have the ropes shaped, braid them starting from the center and working toward one end, then turn it over and work again toward the other end. This gives you a more evenly-shaped braid.",
      "Let the loaf rest and rise on the cookie sheet for at least 40 minutes if fresh, and at least 1 hour and 20 minutes if it was refrigerated. Twenty minutes before baking, preheat the oven to 350 degrees. If baking it in a cookie sheet and not a stone (which is what I did), the oven only needs to preheat for about 5 minutes. Brush the dough with the egg wash, then sprinkle it with the poppy or sesame seeds.",
      "Bake the loaf near the center of the oven for about 25-35 minutes, adjusting the time if you are baking different-sized loaves. When done, the challah will be golden brown, and the braids near the center of the loaf will give resistance when pressed. Challah doesn't have the hard crust of a boule because of the fat in the dough. Let it cool first before eating, but I don't follow that last step.",

You can add any fruits you like but I chose kiwis, pineapples and oranges because they keep well on the fruit pizza if you aren't going to be serving it right away. Also, using 2 or 3 varieties of canned fruit can be considerably less expensive than using all fresh fruit, especially if it is out of season."

Still whisking, add the remainder of the milk in a steady stream. Then put the pan with the milk and egg mixture over medium heat and bring the mixture to a boil, making sure to continuously whisk. When mixture starts to boil cook it for another 1 to 2 minutes-keep whisking! Then remove pan from heat and let it stand for 5 minutes before whisking in the vanilla and butter. The custard should be thick and smooth.",

After chilling in the freezer, start scooping out small portions and rolling the mixture into balls, (about the size of a small meatball), and place on a tray lined with parchment paper. Place the cake balls back in the freezer for about 30 minutes or long enough to prepare the melted chocolate.",

Likewise, in two separate bowls add the white chocolate and the pink melting chips. Place in the microwave for 1 minute and stir, continue heating at 30 second intervals until all the chips are melted. And make sure to stir in between the 30 second heating intervals. You want the chocolate to be warm.",

Use a spoon to make sure the cake ball gets covered completely, then scoop out the cake ball with your spoon and tap the spoon on the side of the dish/measuring cup so that the excess chocolate runs down. Replace the cake ball back on the parchment paper by tapping the tip of the spoon on the tray, this will help the cake ball slide of the spoon. Repeat.",

An easy test to see if the crumbs have been moistened enough is to press the mixed ingredients together in your fist. If the crumbs hold together then your crust is ready to be pressed into the pan.",

Reduce the speed of the mixer to medium and add the eggs and egg yolks, 2 at a time. Mix well. Scrape down the bowl and beater as necessary. With the mixer on low, add the sour cream, lemon zest and vanilla. Mix thoroughly and pour into the cooled crust.",
