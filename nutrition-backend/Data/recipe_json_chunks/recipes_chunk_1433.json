New Zealand makes many of the best unoaked chardonnays. One fantastic example is Kim Crawford Unoaked Chardonnay 2005 from Marlborough, New Zealand ($17). -Karen MacNeil"

The pasta sheets are ready when they are 1/16- inch wide. Continue until all the dough has passed through the machine and is the same thickness. Cover the sheets of dough with a kitchen towel and work with one sheet at a time to fill. Dab the top of the sheet you are about to fill with a wet kitchen towel or with a water-egg yolk wash. This helps create a sticky texture to help close the ravioli after you fill them. Using a 2-inch round cutter, cut out as many circles as you can get from the sheet. Set half of the circles aside, covering them with a kitchen towel so that they don't dry out. Place 1 tablespoon of filling in the center of each of the remaining circles. Top with the reserved circles. Carefully press the edges of the top and bottom circles together. To seal the ravioli, firmly press down the edges with the tines of a fork held horizontally. To prevent the ravioli from bursting when boiling, carefully poke a tiny hole in the center of each, taking care not to pierce the dough entirely. Arrange the ravioli in a single layer on a tray lined with a kitchen towel. Cook within the hour, or refrigerate up to six hours.",
      "Bring 5 quarts of water to boil in an 8 quart pot over high heat. Add 2 tablespoons of salt. Add the ravioli and cook until they rise to the surface and are tender around the edges, about 3 to 5 minutes. Drain, reserving a cup of the pasta water.",
      "Melt the butter in a large saucepan over low heat with 1/2 cup pasta water and the sage, being careful not to let the mixture boil. Add the drained ravioli and the caciocavallo. Toss gently to coat the ravioli with the sauce. Taste and adjust salt if needed. Serve immediately."

      "Wine note: Crab and chardonnay are a classic match because crab is meaty, rich, and sweet and chardonnay is buttery, rich, and a touch sweet, too. The key with these crab cakes is choosing a chardonnay that's not so oaky or toasty that it will overwhelm the finesse of the crab. A good simple one is Sonoma Vineyards Chardonnay 2006 from Sonoma County, California ($15). -Karen MacNeil"

      "There's no question: Fresh-ground beef, lamb, or turkey yields a superior, juicier burger. That includes meat you've had ground to order in a butcher shop or at a supermarket and loosely wrapped (tight wraps compress the meat). At home, a grinder attachment for your stand mixer is ideal, or an old-fashioned hand grinder. Or you can use your food processor; in that case, be sure to work in small batches, pulsing the meat 8 to 10 times or until the meat is finely chopped but not pureed.",
      "No matter what grinding tool you use, it's important to keep the meat and the grinding equipment as cold as possible. If the meat gets too warm, it will begin to smear rather than grind cleanly, giving the finished product a nasty mashed texture. Putting the meat and grinding equipment in the freezer for 15 minutes beforehand helps guarantee optimum results.",
      "No time? In a pinch, you can of course use preground beef, lamb, or turkey for these recipes. The spices and condiments will still produce a better, lighter burger."
