I keep chopped garlic in the big jar at all times and so if you happened to as well then just pour A1/2 teaspoon of just that into the sauce. Set aside.",
      "Now you need dough. If you make your own? Fine! If not then let me clue you in to a little hint. I've never lived anywhere in the U.S. where there isn't at least one pizza restaurant that won't let you buy dough from them. Call around, starting with your favorite pizza parlors and ask them. I usually buy 2 LARGE pizza balls and have never paid more than $1 for each of them. Keep the dough wrapped in plastic wrap and chilled until you're ready to use it!",

Now take a brush with your basting sauce and dab it all around that outside border to the crust. This will add flavor and get a nice buttery- brown crust. Just before putting it in the oven I dusted with Paprika.",

      "A complete Salvadoran pupusas has many components.",
      "1 - Filling - Fillings will vary based on your taste but the two most popular fillings are pupusas de queso, pupusas made of cheese only, or pupusas revueltas, pupusas made of a few different fillings. The most common revueltas are made of beans and cheese or chicharron and cheese - see my post on making chicharrones to make this one. My personal favorite is pupusas de queso con loroco, which are pupusas filled with cheese and a type of edible green flower called loroco that is quite similar to asparagus in both look and taste.",
      "2. Masa dough - This is the standard dough used to make corn tortillas - see my recipe for tortillas de maiz here.",
      "3 - Curtido - A mix of fermented cabage with a little bit of onion, shaved carrot, and hot chile peppers mixed inches Curtido is either served on the side or put on top of the pupusa to be eaten together in same bite.",
      "4 - Salsa Roja, or \"Red Sauce\", served on the side or poured over the curtido and pupusa to be eaten together in same bite.",
      "Now for the secrets to making authentic Salvadoran pupusas! Are you ready? Sshhh! Don't tell anyone!",
      "Make your own refried beans. Handmade refried beans carry much more flavor and are less greasy and watery than the canned refried beans you can buy at the store. To make your own refried beans, simply prepare small Central American red beans the way you would to make arroz curtido. When the beans are done cooking, blend some of them up in a blender and cook them in a saucepan with a few tablespoons of oil over low heat for about 30-40 minutes.",
      "Add butter or margarine to your Mozzarella cheese. When you pour out the amount of mozzarella you will use, add a few scoops of cold butter or margarine to it. The butter/margarine makes the flavor pop and will prevent you from needing to grease the pupusas with oil when you cook them. I personally use margarine because the extra oils in it create a better pupusa than butter will.",
      "Only use Mozarella cheese for your cheese filling! This is a very important secret. Some international stores sell what they call \"queso para pupusas\", or \"pupusas cheese\". This cheese is an imposter! A fake I tell you, run as fast as you can from it! This cheese looks like Mozarella cheese but tastes terrible and if you read the ingredients you will find that it doesn't even contain any milk at all. This cheese is made out of nothing but hydrogenated oils and trans fats. This cheese is cheaper than buying real Mozarella cheese but it destroys the taste and also destroys your health. I have also seen a lot of videos on the web that add all sorts of other dairy products to their mozarrella filling - crema, hard cheese, and panella cheese are just a few I have seen. While these videos say they are making authentic Salvadoran pupusas, I can assure you that this is not an authentic pupusa and will surely not taste like one either.",
      "Cook your pupusas over a gas stove or skillet, not on an electric one. The reason for this is that gas stoves and skillets can get much hotter than electric ones. When the heat is too low, you will get cracks on the outter tortilla skin of your pupusa. You want to cook each side of the pupusa for about 30 seconds, and flip on each side about three times. Once the pupusa starts to puff up and fillings begins to ooze out of, they are done cooking.",
      "Directions:",
      "-Prepare the re-fried beans the day before by boiling Central American small red beans until soft, (takes about three hours, see my post for Arroz Curtido for exact directions).",
      "- Blend about half of the soft red beans in a blender and cook this puree in a skillet on low heat for 30-40 minutes.",
      "-The day you make the pupusas, mix all ingredients for red sauce in blender and blend until pureed.",
      "-Pour red sauce into a small skillet covered with a tablespoon of oil and heat on medium-high until boiling.",
      "-Once sauce boils, turn off heat but leave pot on burner so sauce will be remain warm when you serve the pupusas.",
      "-Prepare the tortilla dough in a bowl using directions found on my tortillas de maiz post.",
      "-Place Mozzarella, butter, and refried beans into a bowl and mix with hands until well mixed.",
      "-Turn your gas skillet to medium-high, (high if have to use an electric stove), and place a pancake skillet (we are pretending this is our comal) on top of the gas burners so it can start to get hot.",
      "-Wet your hands in the small bowl of water you have near you and then grab a ball of tortilla dough in your hand.",
      "-Flatten the dough into a flat circle using your hands and then put about 2 small spoonfuls of the bean/cheese mix in the middle.",
      "-Once you have placed filling in center of dough, close the dough back up using your hands to form a ball again that surrounds and covers your filling.",
      "-While reforming the ball, pinch off any extra dough at the top to prevent an over-sized pupusa. You want just enough dough to completely surround your filling and no more.",
      "-Place ball of dough with filling inside between two plastic baggies, flatten with a plate or your hands, and then peel off flattened pupusa and place onto the hot skillet.",
      "-Cook each side of the pupusa for about 30 seconds each, flipping total about six times so that each side gets the heat about three times.",
      "-Once the pupusa begins to puff up or fillings begin to ooze out of it and burn on surface, remove the pupusa from the heat and place onto a big piece of aluminum foil.",
      "-Repeat process until you have used up all your dough and filling. If you run out of either, just make more.",
      "-Serve the pupusas with curtido and red sauce.",

If the dough is looking too wet and is sticking to the side of the bowl, add extra all-purpose flour 1 tablespoon at a time until the dough is smooth and only slightly sticky.",
      "Remove the bowl from the mixer and pour in 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil. Lift the dough up and turn it to coat with oil - this will prevent it sticking to the bowl. Cover with a damp tea towel and let sit somewhere warm until doubled in volume, about 1 to 2 hours.",

      "Take one ball and roll out into a snake about 20 inches long with your hands. Use a lightly floured rolling pin to roll this into a rectangle about 3 inches wide. Pipe a narrow strip of the beer cheese filling along the length of dough. Fold the dough in half along its length to seal the filling inside, pinching it together at the top firmly and giving it a gentle roll with your hands to smooth the snake out.",
      "Repeat with the rest of the balls.",
      "Take the two ends of each filled snake and bring them up to form a 'U' shape. Cross the ends over each other then fold down over the base of the 'U' to make a pretzel shape. Repeat with the remaining dough snakes so you have 8 pretzels.",
      "Place the shaped pretzels onto two baking sheets lined with parchment paper.",
      "Mix the boiling water and baking soda in a medium bowl (it may fizz up when you do this). Use a pastry brush to brush the solution over the shaped pretzels - make sure you keep stirring the solution as you do this as the baking soda will settle at the base of the bowl if you don't.",
      "Crack the egg into a small bowl and beat lightly with a fork. Brush this over the pretzels too then sprinkle with the grated cheddar.",

      "Let cool for 5 minutes, sprinkle with sliced scallion and serve with any leftover beer cheese for dipping (you can blend it with a bit more cream to make it into a dippable consistency).",

Use either a 3 inch round cookie cutter to cut out circles of dough, or cut out rectangles of dough to fit your desired tins. A tip: try to cut out pieces of dough that are as similar in size and shape to the pan as possible (this applies to full-size tarts as well) so that they are easier to maneuver and fit in, and are less likely to warp and tear as you're moving them around.",
      "Press the dough gently into the tins, prick dough with a fork all over, and let chill for 5-10 minutes or until the dough is firm enough to trim off the excess easily. Buttery doughs like this one always need to be chilled before baking so they bake up evenly, and I also find that it's easier to trim off the dough cleanly when the dough is firmed up. Chill longer if necessary. When I trim off the excess dough, I usually use an offset spatula and run it flat against the top of the tart tin. Scraps can be re-rolled and re-used.",

Cover the dough with a towel, and set the dough aside to rise to about double in size, approximately 1 to 1 1/2 hours.",

Place the balls at least 1 inch apart, and brush them liberally with the melted butter. Set them aside to double in size again, about 45 minutes to 1 hour.",
      "With your thumb, gently indent the top of the dough. Make the holes especially deep if you plan to use the poppyseed or creamy peach filling.

      "FOR THE PRUNE FILLING: Put the prunes into a saucepan, and cover them with water. Add the vanilla, and simmer until the prunes have softened, about 15 minutes. Drain and pit the prunes, and chop them in a food processor with the sugar, lemon juice, and lemon zest. Or chop the prunes by hand, and then add the sugar, lemon juice, and lemon zest.",

With flexible spatula, spread a tiny amount of butter in pan (an alternative method is to brush the pan with melted butter using a pastry brush) and heat until butter just begins to smoke.

Once you have a gotten a feel for the procedure (you will probably have to tinker with the heat and cooking time, since every pan behaves slightly differently), you can save time by using two pans at once. Stagger the process so you are pouring the batter into one pan while a crepe is cooking in the other. This way, you will be able to closely attend to both but will finish in half the time."

Basting is only required when you overcook the meat (aka meat thermometer), or if you want a particular flavor to the turkey (basting with stock, juice of some sort, butter mixture, BBQ sauce, etc.) Turkey, when done well, may be nice with seasonings, but has a great flavor on its own. If you left in the meat thermometer, you should not see it pop out. The bird is still safe to eat and YUMMY!"
