With machine running, drizzle in 6 tbsp. oil. Add parmesan in batches, pulsing after each batch (pesto should be thick). If cheese begins to clump, add water, 1 tsp. at a time, until it loosens. Cover with plastic wrap, smoothing it against surface of pesto.",
      "Finish salad: In a small bowl, whisk 2 1/2 tbsp. oil, vinegar, 1/4 tsp. sea salt, and 1/8 tsp. pepper; set aside. Put asparagus tips, arugula, spring onions, roasted garlic cloves, and lemons in a large bowl.",
      "On a floured surface, dust balls of dough with flour. Working with 1 ball at a time and keeping others covered, roll or stretch until 9 to 10 inches across. \"If you have trouble rolling them out, let them rest 30 seconds to relax,\" says Chiarello.

      "Grill dough until it bubbles and is browned underneath, about 2 minutes. Using long tongs, flip over, brush with more oil, sprinkle with salt and pepper, and grill another 2 minutes, moving over lower heat if necessary (push coals to one side to make a lower-heat spot). Stretch and grill remaining dough rounds the same way. Don't worry if they're not perfectly round. \"I like my crusts sort of free-form, deformato.\"",

      "\"You can do anything on this. It's a little like camping in the middle of your day,\" says Napa Valley chef Michael Chiarello. All you need is bricks arranged to fit under your cooking grate and some sand.",
      "Build the pit: Spread a double layer of heavy-duty foil on the ground (\"not grass,\" warns Chiarello, since it may scorch). Make it big enough to extend a foot beyond your cooking grate in all directions. Build a brick rectangle 3 layers high, leaving a couple of bricks out of the top layer on opposite sides, to encourage airflow. (For a standard 21-in. round Weber grate, the rectangle should be 2 bricks by 3 bricks.) Fill with about an inch of sand.",
      "Light the fire: Put several balled-up sheets of newspaper in the center and position kindling into a tipi around it; lean larger kindling and then 5 to 6 small logs (preferably oak). Light the fire. \"The tipi lets every bit of flame go up past 3 or 4 logs,\" says Chiarello, so the fire starts fast. Once the logs have caught, add several larger logs to the perimeter. Let them burn down to ashy chunks with low flames (1 1/2 to 2 hours). Because there's less smoke and char than cooking over a flaming fire, Chiarello says, \"it makes your food taste much cleaner, gives nuanced flavor, and is better for wine.\"",
      "Start cooking: Keep another log burning at the back of the pit. When it's ashy chunks, rake it into the main fire to maintain heat."

      "Keep live crabs loosely covered in the refrigerator up to 12 hours. Grasp crabs carefully from the rear end, between the legs, and put in a pan to make sure they fit, with 3 to 4 inches of clearance below pan rim. Remove crabs and fill pan with enough water to cover crabs by 2 to 3 inches. Cover pan and bring water to a boil over high heat.",

If desired, scoop soft, golden crab butter and white crab fat from shell into a small bowl to eat by the spoonful with crab or to stir into a dipping sauce. If using back shell for garnish, break bony section (mouth) from front end of shell and discard. Rinse shell well and drain.",
      "On the body section, pull off and discard reddish membrane that covers the center (if it hasn't come off with the back) and any loose pieces. Scoop out any remaining golden butter and add to bowl. Pull off and discard long, spongy gills from sides of body. Rinse body well with cool water.",

One cooked, cleaned 1 3/4- to 2-pound crab (with back shell) yields 7 1/2 to 8 ounces (1 1/3 to 1 1/2 cups) of meat; heavier crabs do not always have more meat."

      "Wine note: One of the best wines for roast turkey (and poultry in general) is pinot noir. In this case, the seasonings--sage, Parmesan, garlic--underscore that choice. Pinot noir's earthy flavors provide a delicious backdrop for the meatiness of the turkey, the herbal quality of the sage, the salty-nuttiness of the cheese, and the pungency of the garlic. As an added boon, pinot noir has a supple, silky texture--just the ticket for a savory bird. Be forewarned: Great pinot noirs are expensive, but this is the time of year to splurge. Try Merry Edwards Estate Pinot Noir 2003 from California's Sonoma Coast ($48). -Karen MacNeil"

      "Cook roast: Pat dry, then -season generously with salt and pepper. \"The bigger the piece of meat, the harder it is to overseason, so go crazy on the salt and pepper.\" Heat a large cast-iron skillet or dutch oven over medium-high heat. Swirl in oil and sear roast, turning every few minutes, until evenly browned all over, about 15 minutes. Transfer to a plate. Add thyme, garlic, and butter to pot and cook, stirring occasionally, until butter foams up and garlic is lightly toasted, about 2 minutes. Pour seasonings over roast. \"This gives the butter a chance to cool before it goes with the roast into the bag. Otherwise it'll melt the bag.\"",
      "Meanwhile, using a sous vide circulator and following its instructions, heat a large pot of water to 133\u00b0 for medium-rare with a tender, steaklike texture. Set the time for anywhere from 18 to 24 hours. \"Once the meat is done, it holds for a remarkable length of time without compromising the results.\"",

They're 100 percent polyethelene and totally inert--no funny chemicals.\" Fold top into a cuff--\"it keeps the seal cleaner.\" Lower bag into water, opened, just until meat is submerged but opening is above water. If bag floats, drizzle in a few tablespoons of olive oil. \"It'll expel the air trapped in the herbs, and that helps the meat sink.\" Seal bag and clip to side of pot with a clothespin.

Lift bag out of sous vide pot and, keeping roast in bag, carefully pour juices and seasonings into sauce pot; return roast in bag to water to keep warm. Cook peelings, stirring occasionally to scrape up browned bits, until juices evaporate, about 20 minutes. \"You want to reduce the juices until they start to fry. Then you're browning the proteins and really making flavor. Also, it makes a clean, glossy sauce.\" Add wine, thyme, and some pepper and cook until reduced to 1/4 cup, about 15 minutes.",

If you want to use gelatin for a classic, stick-to-your-lips texture, spoon a few tablespoons of sauce into a small bowl, sprinkle in gelatin, and stir to dissolve; then stir back into sauce. Season with salt to taste and stir in 2 tbsp. butter. Cover and keep warm over very low heat.",
