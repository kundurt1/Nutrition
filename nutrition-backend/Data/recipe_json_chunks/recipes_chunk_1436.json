Best bet: a soft, thick, fruit-driven red that will act to \"cushion\" all the spice. Try Geyser Peak's 2001 Shiraz from Sonoma County, California ($18). -Karen MacNeil"

Part of the reason it's so satisfying is because each tablespoon of peanut butter contains about 4 grams of protein and 8 grams of fat, most of which is heart-healthy monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fat. When buying peanut butter, be sure to choose one labeled \"natural\" to avoid the trans-fatty acids that come from partially hydrogenated oils, which can increase the LDL, or bad cholesterol, levels in your body. Another bonusnatural peanut butter has much less added sugar and salt."

      "Build the pit: Spread a double layer of heavy-duty foil on the ground (\"not grass,\" warns Chiarello, since it may scorch). Make it big enough to extend a foot beyond your cooking grate in all directions. Build a brick rectangle 3 layers high, leaving a couple of bricks out of the top layer on opposite sides, to encourage airflow. (For a standard 21-in. round Weber grate, the rectangle should be 2 bricks by 3 bricks.) Fill with about an inch of sand.",
      "Light the fire: Put several balled-up sheets of newspaper in the center and position kindling into a tipi around it; lean larger kindling and then 5 to 6 small logs (preferably oak). Light the fire. \"The tipi lets every bit of flame go up past 3 or 4 logs,\" says Chiarello, so the fire starts fast. Once the logs have caught, add several larger logs to the perimeter. Let them burn down to ashy chunks with low flames (1 1/2 to 2 hours). Because there's less smoke and char than cooking over a flaming fire, Chiarello says, \"it makes your food taste much cleaner, gives nuanced flavor, and is better for wine.\"",
      "Start cooking: Keep another log burning at the back of the pit. When it's ashy chunks, rake it into the main fire to maintain heat."
