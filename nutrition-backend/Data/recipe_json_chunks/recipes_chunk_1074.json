      "I used canned coconut milk which resulted in a slightly coconut flavored kefir. I understand you can use the coconut milk that comes in the dairy case in 1/2 gallon containers and that kefir made from it does not have a coconut flavor - I have not tried this yet.",
      "Be sure that you use a glass jar or plastic container and non-metal spatulas or spoons.",
      "If you are using kefir grains that have been kept in milk, rinse them with non-chlorinated water to remove milk residue. You do not need to do this if you are not sensitive to lactose.",
      "Shake the can of milk to combine the cream with the milk, then open and pour into the jar.",
      "Add the kefir grains to the jar. Cover with a clean cloth or coffee filter or something similar, and leave on a counter away from direct sunlight or in a cupboard.",
      "Coconut milk turns into kefir somewhat more quickly than does milk, 12 to 24 hours. In a heat wave, it was done in about 9 hours for me. The longer it stands, the tangier it gets.",
      "Stir the kefir and then strain it in a nylon mesh or stainless steel strainer. A spatula is helpful to gently lift the curds and pick out the kefir grains. Don't press down on the grains.",
      "Refrigerate the kefir for a day or so, where it will continue to thicken.",
      "I used it to make delicious smoothies. If you prefer a yogurt type of consistency, drain through a coffee filter or in a yogurt strainer to make a thicker consistency.",
      "Put the grains into a clean jar and start over. If you do not want to make more at this time, place in a container and cover by 1 inch with milk or cream it should be ok for a week or so.",
      "You can make coconut kefir for about two weeks, but after two weeks, rejuvenate the kefir grains in cow's or goat milk. Kefir grains will not grow and multiply in coconut milk, and they need the dairy milk to stay in peak condition."

Then add the lard and butter and, using only your fingertips, lightly and gently rub the fat into the flour, again lifting the mixture up high all the time to give it a good airing.",
      "When everything is crumbly, sprinkle in about 1 tablespoon of cold water. Start to mix the pastry with a knife and then finish off with your hands, adding a few more drops of water, till you have a smooth dough that leaves the bowl clean. Then pop the pastry into a polythene bag and let it rest in the refrigerator for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, pre-heat the oven to gas mark 5, 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C) and pop the baking sheet in to pre-heat on the centre shelf.",
      "After that, roll the pastry out into a circle on a surface lightly dusted with flour, giving it quarter turns to keep its round shape; it's a good idea at this stage to put the tin lightly on top of the pastry - the size needs to be 1 inch (2.5 cm) bigger all round. Now transfer it, rolling it over the pin, to the tin, and press it lightly and firmly around the base, sides and rim. Now take a sharp knife and trim the overlapping pastry. Then press the rim of the pastry so that about 1/4 inch (5 mm) overlaps the edge.",
      "Next, roll the trimmings and cut out about 24 leaves, making veins in them with the blunt side of the knife. Now brush the whole surface of the pastry case with some of the beaten eggs, arranging the leaves all around the rim, overlapping them. Brush these, too, with beaten egg. Now prick the base of the tart with a fork, then place it on the baking sheet and bake on the centre shelf for 20 minutes, until the pastry is crisp and golden. Check after 4 minutes to make sure that the pastry isn't rising up in the centre. If it is, prick it again a couple of times, pressing it back down with your hands. After 20 minutes, remove it from the oven, leaving the baking sheet there, and reduce the temperature to gas mark 3, 325\u00b0F(170\u00b0C).",
      "Now place the cream in a saucepan and bring it up to a gentle simmer, then whisk the beaten eggs and sugar together in a large heatproof jug using a balloon whisk - but not too vigorously because you don't want to make bubbles. Then pour the hot liquid over the beaten eggs, add the vanilla extract and half the nutmeg and whisk briefly again.",
      "Now place the pie tin back on the baking tray with the oven shelf half out and have ready the rest of the grated nutmeg on a piece of foil. Carefully pour the filling into the pastry case (it will be very full) and scatter the rest of the nutmeg all over, then dot with the softened butter and bake in the oven for 30-40 minutes, until the filling is golden brown, firm in the centre and slightly puffed up. Serve it warm or slightly cooled at room temperature."
