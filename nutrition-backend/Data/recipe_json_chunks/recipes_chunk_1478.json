      "Pulse the flour, sugar, and salt in a food processor until combined. Add the butter and pulse until the mixture resembles coarse sand with some pea-size pieces of butter. Add the cream cheese and sour cream until the batter comes together into a rough dough. Turn the dough out of the bowl onto a floured work surface and divide into 4 portions. Pat each portion into a disk, wrap in plastic wrap, and chill in the refrigerator, about 45 minutes. Meanwhile, make one of the three fillings to follow.",
      "Put the raisins in a medium saucepan and cover with the water. Add the sugar, salt, cinnamon, and vanilla. Simmer over low heat until almost all the water is absorbed and the raisins are plumped. Transfer the raisin sauce to a blender or food processor and pulse. Add the walnuts and process again to form a paste. Add the rum to taste, and set aside to cool.",
      "Put the apricots in a medium saucepan and cover with the water. Add the sugar, salt, cinnamon, and vanilla. Simmer over low heat until almost all the water is absorbed and the apricots are soft and plumped. Transfer the apricot sauce to a blender or food processor and pulse. Add the walnuts and marmalade, and process again to form a paste. Add the brandy to taste, and set aside to cool.",
      "Grind the walnuts until fine in a food processor, and set aside. Place the chocolate in the top of a double boiler. Add the sugar, vanilla, and butter, and melt over low heat. Remove from the heat and stir in the jam and walnuts. Add the liqueur to taste, and set aside to cool.",
      "Preheat the oven to 375\u00b0F. Line two half-sheet pans with parchment paper.",
      "Roll 1 portion of the dough into a rectangle about 1/4 inch thick. Spread on the filling. Starting with the long side, roll up the dough to make a tight cylinder. Flatten it a bit, and wrap in plastic wrap. Place the cylinder in the freezer or refrigerator, and continue this process with the remaining portions of dough.",
      "Slice the cylinders into 11/2-inch pieces, and place each piece seam side down on the prepared pans. Whisk the egg yolks and brush over the tops. Sprinkle with sugar. Bake about 25 minutes, or until golden and crispy. Cool for a few minutes on the pans. Transfer the rugelach to a wire rack to cool completely."

      "Preheat oven to 350\u00b0 and line 2 sheet pans with parchment paper. With a hand or stand mixer, cream together butter, sugars, salt, baking soda, powder, espresso, and vanilla on medium speed. Mix for about two minutes, just until combined.",
      "Then (with the machine still running) add in the yolks, one at a time. During this process, shut off the mixer and scrape the bowl down with a rubber spatula once or twice. Reduce mixing speed to low and dump in the flour and cocoa all at once. Mix until the dry ingredients have fully incorporated.",
      "With the mixer still running on low, drizzle in the hot coffee a little at a time. About halfway through, stop the mixer and scrape the bowl down. Continue drizzling in the coffee to transform the dough into a paste.",
      "In the end, it should have a smooth cake-batter like consistency. If you notice any lumps, crank up the mixer speed to medium and beat until the lumps have disappeared. If a few remain, don't worry; they'll bake out.",
      "Divide the batter evenly between the two sheet pans (roughly 15 ounces each). Use an offset spatula or the back of a spoon to spread the batter into a thin layer; you don't need the batter to reach to the very corners, it only needs to cover a 10\" by 14\" area. Rap the sheet pans against the counter to help level the batter.",
      "Bake for about 7-10 minutes, or until the cookie-sheets have puffed up and become firm to the touch. Cool thoroughly.",
      "For greatest ease of handling, refrigerate or freeze the wafers before proceeding. If you're quite careful, it's not necessary, but it does make the process easier.",
      "Line a 9\" x 13\" brownie pan with parchment paper. The paper should overhang the long sides by 4 inches or so.",
      "Use a knife to cut the two cooled chocolate wafers into 9 x 13\" rectangles. Set aside the excess scraps.",
      "Fit one of these giant wafers, shiny side down, into the bottom of the parchment lined brownie pan. Once you've fitted it in, peel off the parchment paper stuck to the bottom. If the wafer cracks or breaks in any place, use some of the trimmings to patch up the hole. The wafers will meld together nicely just by pressing two pieces together firmly.",
      "Store the pan and remaining chocolate wafer in the freezer until needed.",
      "If you're opting for homemade ice cream, you will want to use it immediately after it's finished churning in your ice cream maker. If you're using store bought, store it in the refrigerator for 30 minutes or until it has become soft and spreadable.",
      "In either case, spread the ice cream into the brownie pan, atop the first chocolate layer. Use a spoon or offset spatula to push the ice cream up into the corners of the pan, and to distribute it evenly.",
      "Invert the remaining frozen chocolate wafer onto a cutting board. Peel of the parchment paper and then place it shiny side up on top of the ice cream.",
      "Cover the wafer with a piece of parchment or plastic wrap, then use your hands to gently press the top wafer down and seal it against the ice cream. If you notice there are any thin or uneven places, gently push on the chocolate wafer to redistribute the ice cream below.",
      "Return the pan to the freezer and allow it to freeze for at least 12 hours before proceeding.",
      "Of course, you don't have to make wrappers. But it's fun and easy. Simply take a sheet of tin foil, shiny side up, and use a pastry brush or paper towel to coat it lightly with oil. Then press a sheet of parchment paper against the oiled surface of the foil. Use your fingers to smooth the parchment down, pressing out any air bubbles. If you have a bench scraper, that's also a good tool for removing air bubbles.",
      "Cut the newly formed wax/foil into 7\" squares with scissors or an xacto knife. Repeat until you have 12 squares altogether. Set aside until needed.",
      "Pull the brownie pan from the freezer. Run a knife around the edges to loosen, then take hold of the overhanging parchment and lift the whole thing out. It may take a bit of tugging on one side, then the other.",
      "Transfer this giant ice cream sandwich to a cutting board.",
      "Use a large chef's knife to cut it into 12 pieces. It's easiest to first cut it into quarters, then to cut each quarter into three pieces. I",
      "Wipe your knife clean with a hot, wet towel between slices for the cleanest cut.",
      "Store the sandwiches in an airtight container or, to make the most out of your ice cream sandwich nostalgia, wrap each in the prepared foil.",
      "Remove half of the ice cream sandwiches from the freezer. Place each on the center of the foil or parchment square.",
      "Wrap much like you would a Christmas present: fold the long sides to the middle. Then at each edge, fold the short sides to the middle. Then fold the long sides. The foil will crease and stay in place without tape.",
      "Return to the freezer, and repeat with the other half. They will keep quite well for about a month, if they last that long, which I doubt."

With mixer still running, add in egg yolks one at a time. Once incorporated, shut off mixer and scrape bowl down with a rubber spatula.",
      "Turn mixer to its lowest setting. Dump in flour and cocoa all at once. The mixture will be stiff. Continue mixing until uniform. Shut off mixer. Use a spatula to scrape the dough from the bowl and knead lightly to form a smooth ball. Use your hands to flatten into a disc.",
      "You may begin rolling the dough right away, or you may wrap it with plastic and refrigerate for up to a week.",
      "If you've kept the dough refrigerated, let it sit at room temperature to soften before starting to roll.",
      "Preheat oven to 350\u00b0 F. Sift some cocoa powder onto the counter (using cocoa instead of flour gives the Fauxreos their uniquely dark color). Use a rolling pin to roll the dough to 1/8\" thickness (as thick as 3 dimes, stacked).",
      "When finished, slide a metal spatula between the dough and counter to loosen. This will prevent the cookies from sticking.",
      "A 2\" round cutter makes perfect \"Oreos\" but use any cutter you like. Cut out the cookies and use a metal spatula to lift and transfer to cookie sheet.",
      "Arrange cookies on ungreased cookie sheet. (If the cookie sheet is dinged up or uneven, line with parchment paper first.) The cookies will not spread during baking, so they may be arranged quite close together. Set the sheets aside.",
      "Gather up, knead, and re-roll the remaining dough scraps, likewise cutting and arranging on a cookie sheet.",
      "To pipe a design on the cookies, place any remaining dough in a mixing bowl. Mix with a hand or stand mixer and add about 1 tsp of hot water. Continue adding hot water, a teaspoon at a time, until the dough has thinned into a paste. You can always add more liquid, but you can't take it away. Add slowly and let each addition mix in fully before adding more. When the mixture reaches a frosting-like consistency, use a spatula to scrape it out. Transfer to a piping bag fitted with a very small tip, or a heavy duty Ziploc bag with a tiny hole poked in the corner.",
      "Holiday Oreos have winter-themed designs atop them, like snowflakes and ice skates.",
      "Once the cookies have been decorated, bake for about 12 minutes, or until quite firm to the touch. If your oven has an uneven heating element, rotate the cookie sheets after six minutes. Once the cookies have baked, cool thoroughly, directly on the cooling rack.",
      "To make the filling: With a hand or stand mixer, cream together shortening/butter, powdered sugar, vanilla and salt. Cream on medium speed for five minutes; use a rubber spatula to scrape the bowl down periodically. The long mixing time aerates the filling, making it especially white and less gritty.",
      "Using a spatula, transfer half the filling to a small pastry bag fitted with a plain tip. Alternately you can use a Ziploc bag with the corner snipped off as a makeshift pastry bag.",
      "Add the peppermint oil and the food coloring to the remaining mixture and beat until evenly colored (or don't! It looks really nice kinda swirled and uneven). Likewise transfer this mixture to a piping bag.",
      "To assemble the cookies: Flip half the wafers upside down. Onto each, pipe a swirl of vanilla filling, like you're making a yin-yang symbol. After, pipe on the other half with the peppermint. To finish, sprinkle each cookie generously with crushed candy cane bits, then top with remaining wafers. Press down with your fingers, applying very even pressure so the filling will spread uniformly across the cookie.",
      "Transfer cookies to an airtight container and refrigerate for several hours. This is crucial. After whipping the filling, it will be quite soft. Refrigerating it will solidify the filling, restoring its proper texture, and bonding it with the wafers.",

      "To make the white chocolate coating:",
      "In a small sauce pan, bring cream to a simmer. Shut off the heat and begin adding white chocolate a little at a time, while whisking. Continue whisking until white chocolate has melted completely. If the mixture becomes too thick or too cool and it seems the white chocolate has stopped melting, turn the heat to low and whisk until melted. Whisk in the salt.",
      "Transfer this white chocolate mixture to the smallest bowl you have that will accommodate it. (This creates more depth, making dipping easier.) Let the white chocolate stand, stirring occasionally to prevent a skin from forming, until it is no longer hot. It should be about body temperature.",
      "Dip the cookies:",
      "Have a parchment lined sheet pan standing nearby.",
      "Drop one cookie into the center of the bowl. Use a fork to submerge it completely. Lift it from the ganache and tap the fork against the edge of the bowl quite firmly to encourage excess ganache to drip off. Drag the cookie bottom across the edge of the bowl to scrape off any excess from the bottom, and transfer to the parchment lined pan.",
      "Continue dipping all the cookies; if the ganache becomes too thick, microwave for just 10 seconds and stir with a fork to restore fluidity, then continue dipping.",
      "Refrigerate the cookies for about 20 minutes, until the ganache has set. Dip the cookies a second time, warming the bowl of ganache in the microwave as needed. Return the cookies to the fridge to set, and then? Dig in.",
      "Store the dipped cookies in the fridge for several days. Undipped cookies will last, refrigerated, about two weeks."

      "Add oil to a wok and heat over high heat until oil reaches 350\u00b0F (180\u00b0C) on an instant-read thermometer. Set the wok's spatula in the oil as it heats so that the spatula is heated as well; this will help prevent the black bean sauce from sticking to the spatula when it's added.",
      "Add black bean sauce and fry, stirring constantly, until black bean sauce begins to look just slightly curdled. Immediately transfer to a heatproof container, along with all the frying oil. It's better to err on the side of less frying if you're unsure, as over-fried black bean sauce will clump up and be difficult to work with later.",
      "In a small saucepan of simmering water, poach shrimp until just pink on the outside and still undercooked in the center, about 30 seconds. Drain. Shell shrimp and cut into 1/4-inch dice.",
      "In a clean wok, heat about 3 tablespoons (45ml) vegetable oil over high heat until smoking. (You can use some of the vegetable oil from the bean-frying step, if you stir-fried the beans.) Add pork belly and spread in an even layer. Allow to sear for 30 seconds, then begin stirring and tossing constantly until pork is browned all over, about 30 seconds longer. (If you're working over gas, you may get some flare-ups; they'll die down quickly and enhance the flavor of the stir-fry.)",
      "Add scallion, ginger, and about 3 tablespoons diced onion, then cook, stirring and tossing, until fragrant, about 20 seconds. Add soy sauce, pouring it down the side of the wok to make it sizzle. Cook, stirring, for 10 seconds longer.",
      "Add potato and squid and cook, stirring and tossing constantly, until potato is about half cooked, about 3 minutes. Add remaining onion and cook, stirring and tossing, until onion has softened, about 1 minute. Working in 1-tablespoon (15ml) additions, add black bean sauce (without too much of the oil it was fried with), tossing to coat all the ingredients; exactly how much you add will depend on your taste, but your goal is a rich black bean character and very dark brown color throughout. (We ended up adding about 5 heaping tablespoons of the black bean sauce we used.)",
      "Add shrimp and toss to combine. Add oyster sauce and sugar and stir well to incorporate. Season with black pepper. Add water, 1 tablespoon (15ml) at a time, until the mixture has thinned enough to create a thick but flowing sauce. Continue cooking until potato is just cooked through; stir often and lower heat as needed to prevent scorching.",
      "Add more water as needed, roughly 1 tablespoon (15ml) at a time, to reach a saucy consistency; if sauce becomes too thin, add 1 teaspoon (5ml) potato-starch slurry and bring to a simmer to help thicken the liquid. Repeat this process, adjusting with small amounts of water and slurry as needed, until the sauce is glossy and thick but slowly pourable. Adjust seasoning with more oyster sauce or soy sauce as desired.",
      "Meanwhile, boil jjajangmyeon noodles following the manufacturer's instructions. Drain and portion into serving bowls. Spoon the jjajangmyeon sauce on top, garnish with cucumbers, peas, or scallions, and serve."

    "ingredients": [],

      "Start out by peeling the wrappers off of your cupcakes, and spear each one with a popsicle stick, so that it is embedded into the frosting but does not poke through to the top. Freeze them for at least 2 hours, or even overnight--you want them to be like little rocks.",
      "When your cupcakes are nearing the end of the chilling period, it's time to start heating the oil for frying. I poured about 6 cups of vegetable oil into a medium saucepan, so that it was about 4-5 inches deep. The exact quantity of oil required will depend on the size of your saucepan. Turn the heat to medium-high, and insert a candy or frying thermometer. The oil needs to reach 375\u00b0F on the thermometer, which will take about 10-12 minutes.",
      "While the oil heats, prepare the batter. Place 1/2 cup of flour in a shallow bowl and set aside for the moment. Place 1 cup of flour in a small bowl and stir in the baking powder and salt. In a mixing cup, stir together the milk, vinegar, and oil. Whisk the wet ingredients into the dry until smooth and free of most lumps. The batter should be thicker than a pancake batter--if it seems too liquidy (as if it might drip off when you dip the cupcakes in it), whisk in the remaining flour until it has reached the desired consistency.",
      "Remove the cupcakes on sticks from your freezer. I found that it is best to fry one cupcake at a time, so you could take them out of the freezer a couple at a time so that the cupcakes fried later on don't get too warm while sitting out.",
      "First, dredge your cupcake in the flour, covering it completely. Tap off excess and roll into the wet batter mixture until it is completely coated on all sides (the bottom may be bare; this is okay).",
      "Quickly dip the battered cupcake into the oil, holding the stick from the very end (do not drop it or you might get oil spatter!). You will only be dipping each cupcake for a very short time, so keep a careful eye on it.",
      "I did not wear gloves for this part and I didn't get burnt or spattered, but since the oil is very hot, it might be a good idea to wear an oven mitt to decrease the likelihood of getting spatter on your hands.",
      "Once the batter has reached a pleasing golden hue, remove the cupcake from the oil and transfer to a plate covered with paper towel to soak up the excess grease. Repeat the battering and frying process with the remaining cupcakes, battering them one at a time directly before dipping in the frying oil. While frying, be sure to monitor the temperature of the oil and adjust your heat up or down accordingly so that it remains at 375\u00b0F. If the oil is too cold it won't fry quickly enough and the cupcakes will soak up too much grease; if it is too hot, the outside will get dark before the inside is fully warmed, leaving you with a delicious shell but a partially defrosted cupcake inside.",
      "I had a tiny bit left after frying all of my cupcakes, so I used it to deep fry a couple of peanut butter cups. It was delicious."

      "Position a rack in the center of the oven, and heat the oven to 350\u00b0F. Butter and flour two 8-inch round cake pans.",
      "Using a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment (or a handheld mixer), cream together the butter and granulated sugar on medium speed for 3 to 4 minutes, or until light and fluffy. (This step will take 8 to 10 minutes if using a handheld mixer.) Stop the mixer a few times and use a rubber spatula to scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl and the paddle to release any clinging butter or sugar.",
      "In a small bowl, whisk together the eggs, egg yolks, and vanilla just until combined. On low speed, slowly pour the egg mixture into the butter mixture and mix just until incorporated. Scrape the bowl and paddle again, then beat on medium speed for 20 to 30 seconds, or until the mixture is homogeneous.",
      "In a medium bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. On the lowest speed, add about one-third of the flour mixture to the egg-butter mixture and mix just until barely combined. Immediately pour in about half of the buttermilk and continue to mix on the lowest speed until the buttermilk is almost thoroughly incorporated. Stop the mixer and scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl well. Again on the lowest speed, add about half of the remaining flour mixture and mix just until barely combined. Add the rest of the buttermilk and mix just until combined. Be careful not to overmix.",
      "At this point, it is best to finish the mixing by hand. Remove the bowl from the mixer stand and, using the rubber spatula, fold in the remaining flour mixture just until the batter is homogeneous. As you fold, be sure to incorporate any batter clinging to the sides and bottom of the bowl. Divide the batter evenly between the prepared cake pans.",
      "Bake for 40 to 50 minutes, or until the tops are golden brown and the cakes spring back when pressed in the middle with a fingertip. Let cool completely in the pans on wire racks. (The cooled cakes can be tightly wrapped in plastic wrap and stored in the freezer for up to 1 week. Thaw at room temperature, still wrapped tightly in plastic wrap.)",
      "While the cake layers are cooling, make the frosting. To make the ganache, put the chocolate in a medium heatproof bowl. In a small saucepan, scald the cream over medium-high heat (bubbles start to form around the edge of the pan, but the cream is not boiling). Pour the hot cream over the chocolate and let sit for about 1 minute, then slowly whisk the chocolate and cream together until the chocolate is completely melted and the mixture is smooth. Let sit at room temperature for 1 to 2 hours, or until completely cool. (Or, refrigerate the ganache until cool, about 30 minutes, whisking every 10 minutes.)",
      "Fit the stand mixer with the paddle attachment (or use a handheld mixer) and beat the butter on medium-low speed for 10 to 15 seconds, or until smooth. Add the confectioners' sugar, salt, and vanilla and continue to beat on medium-low speed for about 2 minutes, or until the mixture is fluffy and smooth. Stop the mixer a few times and use a rubber spatula to scrape the bowl and the paddle to release any clinging butter or sugar. On medium speed, add the cooled ganache and beat for about 2 minutes, or until completely combined. Stop to scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl. Turn the mixer speed to medium-high and beat for about 1 minute, or until the frosting lightens in color and thickens. You should have about 4 cups. (Use the frosting the day you make it, or cover and store in the refrigerator for up to 1 day, then bring to room temperature and paddle again for a few minutes until smooth before using.)",
      "Remove the cooled cakes from their pans. (Be sure they are completely cool. If they are even the slightest bit warm, the frosting will melt and you will have a mess.) Using a long, serrated knife, trim the top of each cake to level it (the layers will have rounded a bit in the oven; the trimmed scraps make great nibbles). Place 1 cake layer on a cake plate or cake pedestal (if you have a revolving cake stand, use it). Spoon about 1 cup of the frosting on top and use an offset spatula to spread it evenly to the edges.",
      "Carefully place the second cake layer, top side down (so the even, sharp edges will be on the top of the finished cake), on top. Spoon about 1 cup of the frosting on top and spread it over the top and down the sides of the cake, smoothing the frosting as well as you can and covering the entire cake with a thin layer. This is the crumb coat, which will keep any loose crumbs from migrating to the surface of the finished cake. Spoon a heaping cup of frosting on top of the cake, and spread it evenly across the top and down the sides. This is the finishing layer of frosting. If desired, spoon any remaining frosting into a pastry bag fitted with a small round or star tip and pipe a decorative line along the top and/or bottom edge of the cake.",
      "The cake can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days."

Toast in the oven until fragrant and pale gold, like white sand, stirring thoroughly every 20 minutes or so to circulate sugar away from the edges of the pan. The whole process will take about 1 hour, but it can vary significantly depending on oven temperature accuracy, skillet size and shape, and frequency of stirring. Pour warm sugar into a 2-quart glass baking dish (or similar) to speed cooling and let it cool to approximately 70\u00b0F (21\u00b0C) before use. The cooled sugar can be used right away, or it can be stored in an airtight container indefinitely.",
      "In 3-quart stainless steel saucier, melt butter over medium-low heat until fluid. Increase to medium and simmer, stirring with a heat-resistant spatula while butter hisses and pops; adjust heat as needed, so that dairy solids will not scorch before all the water can boil away. Continue cooking and stirring, scraping up any brown bits that form along the pan, until butter is golden yellow and perfectly silent (an indication the water has entirely boiled away). The entire process should take about 15 minutes; substantially shorter or longer times may indicate improper heat settings.",

This can be done passively over the course of several hours, or in about 20 minutes with a cold-water bath using a few ice cubes. Alternatively, the brown butter can be refrigerated up to a week in an airtight container and then warmed to about 70\u00b0F (21\u00b0C) before use.",

About halfway through, pause to scrape the bowl and beater with a flexible spatula.",
      "With the mixer still running, add eggs one at a time, letting each fully incorporate before adding the next. Reduce speed to low and sprinkle in about 1/3 of the cake flour, then drizzle in 1/3 of the milk. Repeat with remaining flour and milk, working in thirds as before.",
      "When the batter looks smooth, scrape the bowl and beater with a flexible spatula; then fold the batter once or twice from the bottom up to be sure everything is well-combined. The batter should look creamy and thick but not stiff.",
      "Divide evenly between prepared cake pans (about 27 ounces or 765g). Stagger pans together on one oven rack and bake until puffed, firm, and pale gold, about 35 minutes. If oven has uneven heat, pause to rotate the pans after about 16 minutes. Alternatively, bake two layers at once and finish the third later.",

Repeat with second and third layers and then cover the sides of the cake with another cup of buttercream, spreading it as smoothly as you can (tutorial",
      "). Refrigerate cake until buttercream hardens, about 30 minutes.",

Let the cake sit out until it reaches an internal temperature no cooler than 70\u00b0F (21\u00b0C) before serving, otherwise it will be too cold and seem greasy and dense. Cut with a chef's knife to serve and cover exposed edges with leftover buttercream to keep the cake moist. Under a cake dome, the frosted cake will keep for 3 days at room temperature."

Remove the weights and the liner, turn the pie, and bake until the bottom crust is a light golden brown, about 10 minutes more. Remove the pie shell from the oven and allow it to cool completely.",

In a separate bowl, whisk egg yolks and the remaining 1 ounce of sugar until they are pale and light, about one minute. Place the orange juice mixture over low heat and whisk constantly. It will begin to thicken to a gooey consistency. Turn off the heat, and temper the egg mixture with the orange mixture. Combine the two in the saucepan and whisk constantly over low heat. Once the mixture begins to bubble, it should be whisked for two additional minutes. Turn off the heat and add the butter. Whisk until and butter solids disappear. Pour the mixture into the cooled pie shell and press plastic wrap on the surface (avoid covering the crust with the wrap). Allow the pie to cool on the counter for 15 minutes, then transfer it to the fridge to cool and set up completely, at least 2 hours.",
      "Just before serving: Fill a medium saucepan one quarter full with water. Set the saucepan over medium heat, and bring water to a simmer. Combine egg whites, cream of tartar, sugar, and salt in the heatproof bowl of electric mixer, and place over saucepan. Whisk constantly until sugar is dissolved and whites are warm to the touch, 3 to 3 1/2 minutes. Test by rubbing between your fingers, you should feel no grit. Transfer bowl to electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, and whip, starting on low speed, gradually increasing to high until stiff, glossy peaks form, about 8 minutes. Add vanilla, and mix until combined. Remove the plastic from the top of the chilled pie and top with the meringue (you may choose to pipe the meringue using a star tip for a different look). Place the pie under the broiler and watch it carefully, the top should brown but not burn, and it changes quickly. Chill for 10 minutes, then serve."

Place an 8 inch springform pan in the middle of the dough and cut a circle one inch larger than the pan around it. Remove the pan and center the dough in it, smoothing it into the bottom.

Place kumquat mixture over medium heat, whisking constantly, until the mixture boils, about 5 minutes. Once mixture begins boiling, turn on the timer. Whisk constantly while the mixture boils to cook the cornstarch, being careful not to scorch on the bottom. Once timer goes off, immediately remove from heat and whisk in butter and olive oil. Once incorporated, press through strainer into bowl, discarding the solids. Scrape filling into crust and spread evenly with a small offset spatula or the back of a spoon. Place in refrigerator and allow to set for at least two hours before slicing.",

Keep your fingers spread apart while you roll the breadsticks, gently stretching the dough as your roll. If the dough resists, wait a few moments and let it relax, then continue rolling and pulling gently.

Spread some of the remaining sesame seeds on your work surface in a narrow pile, about the length of the breadsticks and double the width. Holding the end of a breadstick, gently put it on top of the seeds and then turn it over once to coat the dough generously with the seeds.

      "Stir the yeast and malt into the 1/4 cup of warm water in a small bowl; let stand until foamy, about 10 minutes. Place the flour and salt in a standard food processor fitted with the dough blade or a large (over 7-cup capacity) processor fitted with the steel blade and process with several pulses to sift. Mix the 1 cup of cold water and the oil. With the machine running, pour the water mixed with oil and the dissolved yeast through the feed tube and process until the dough comes together. Process 45 seconds longer to knead. Finish kneading by hand on a lightly floured surface.",
      "Pat the dough with your hand into a 14 by 4-inch rectangle on a well-floured surface. Lightly brush the top with oil. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise until doubled, about 1 hour.",
      "Sprinkle the dough with semolina flour before cutting and stretching. The baker's method of shaping breadsticks is ingenious, simple, and quick, for he certainly doesn't have time to roll out individual grissini. Cut the dough crosswise into four equal sections and then cut each section crosswise again into five strips, each about the width of a fat finger. The dough is so elastic that you can simply pick up each piece, hold each end with your fingers, and pull and stretch to fit the width (or length) of a baking sheet. Place the breadsticks several inches apart on lightly oiled baking sheets (I find it easier to use the backs of the baking sheets, unless you have rimless sheets). There is no need to let them rise.",
      "Preheat the oven to 450\u00b0F. If you are using a baking stone, turn the oven on 30 minutes before baking. Bake the breadsticks for 20 minutes. If you like crunchy breadsticks, bake directly on the baking stone, which has been sprinkled with cornmeal or coarse semolina, for the last 5 minutes. Cool on racks.",
      "For grissini siciliani, sprinkle the dough with 1/2 cup (2 oz / 60 g) of sesame seeds instead of semolina flour before cutting and shaping.",
      "For grissini al papavera, sprinkle the dough with 1/2 cup (1 oz / 28 g) of poppy seeds instead of semolina flour before cutting and shaping."

      "In a medium mixing bowl, whisk together dry ingredients. While using a scale to measure ingredients is the most accurate method, most American home bakers use cup measures. And so do I! (Just don't tell my professional baker friends. It can be our little secret.) The best way to fill a measuring cup is to \"fill and level.\" Using a scoop, or a smaller size measuring cup, pour the flour into your measuring cup. Be sure to use a nested set of \"dry\" measuring cups. If your flour has been sitting around, it's a good idea to whisk it before measuring. This will lighten it and break up any clumps. Overfill the cup and then run a straight edge tool over the top of the cup. I like to use a small cake decorating spatula. This is what you are looking for: a level cup of flour. Use this method for any gluten-free flours and starches.",

      "On a well-floured surface, shape the dough into a rectangle with your hands and then roll it out in one direction, away from you, so you end up with a rectangle about 1/2 inch (1 cm) thick. Fold the far third towards you, then fold the nearest third over that (rather like folding a business letter), so that you now have a rectangle made up of 3 equal layers. Give the pastry a quarter turn, then repeat the rolling, folding, and turning process 5 more times. Wrap the pastry in plastic wrap and rest in the fridge for about 30 minutes or up to an hour.",
      "Preheat the oven to 375\u00b0F / 190\u00b0C. Roll out the pastry on a lightly floured surface to a thickness of about 1/4 inch / 5mm. Take an ovenproof frying pan (or a tarte tatin dish) roughly 8 inches / 20cm in diameter, place it upside down on the pastry, and cut around it. Wrap the pastry disk and place it in the fridge.",
      "Melt the butter with the oil in the frying pan (or tarte tatin dish). Add the cider vinegar, sugar, and some salt and pepper, stir well, then add the halved beets and toss to coat. You want the beets to fill the pan snugly, so add a few more if you need to. Cover the pan with foil, transfer to the oven, and roast for 30 to 40 minutes, until the beets are tender.",
      "Take the pan from the oven and rearrange the beet halves neatly, placing them cut side up. Lay the pastry disk over the beets, patting it down and tucking in the edges down the side of the pan. Return to the oven and bake for 20 minutes, until the pastry is fully puffed up and golden brown.",
      "Leave the tarte to cool in its pan for about 15 minutes, then turn it out by putting a plate over the top and inverting it. Pour any juices left in the pan back over the beets.",
      "Put the ingredients for the vinaigrette into a screw-topped jar, season well with salt and pepper, and shake to combine. Trickle over the tarte tatin and serve."

Pipe the batter into quarter-size circles onto the prepared baking sheet, leaving about 1 inch in between each macaron. The macarons should have a uniform size. Let them sit out at room temperature for 15 minutes, until a skin forms. This will transform into a beautiful crust on the finished macarons.",

Let the mixture cook and when it comes to a boil, add the pumpkin puree and spices. Mix well. Pour the mixture over the white chocolate, and whisk until the chocolate is melted and the mixture is smooth. Let the ganache cool, stirring occasionally with a silicone spatula until it reaches about 40\u00b0F and then add the butter.",

Wash and dry the strainer, then push the batter through the strainer with a rubber spatula. Cover the batter and allow it to rest in the refrigerator for 48 hours.",
      "Set the oven to 350\u00b0F and place the metal (either copper or aluminum) Canele molds inside for 10 minutes. While the molds are heating, place the beeswax in a plastic, microwave-safe container and microwave in 30-second increments, swirling each time, until the beeswax is fully liquified. Add the butter and microwave until it has fully melted, then stir until you have a solution of butter and beeswax. (This may also be done on the stovetop in a saucepan, but cleaning beeswax from pots is an unsavory activity, using the microwave is highly recommended.) Remove the molds from the oven and allow them to cool for one minute. Set up a cooling rack with plastic wrap underneath. Grasp the molds one at a time with the tongs, coat the insides of the molds with the wax mixture using a pastry brush (silicone is recommended, you will need to boil the pastry brush to get the wax off later) then invert the molds on top of the cooling rack and allow the excess wax to drip off. Once the wax has cooled back to opaque, place the molds in the freezer for two hours.",
      "Set a baking stone on the bottom rack of the oven and place a sheet tray on top. Preheat the oven to 500\u00b0F. When the oven is ready, remove the molds from the freezer and fill them almost to the top, leaving a centimeter of space at the top of the molds. Remove the preheated sheet tray from the oven, line with parchment, and then place the filled molds on the heated tray, spacing them evenly and far apart. Place the tray of molds onto the stone in the oven, and watch it carefully for the first 30 minutes of baking. The canele will start to bubble, then rise up out of the molds. When they rise more than one centimeter above the rim of the mold, use tongs to remove the mold and allow the canele to sink all the way back down into the mold, then return it to the oven. You will need to do this for the first 30-45 minutes of baking, until you notice that the canele have developed an outer skin and a space has formed between the mold and the canele on all sides.",
      "Once this has happened, drop the temperature of the oven to 400\u00b0F and allow the canele to finish baking, approximately 45 more minutes (there is no exact time, since the temperature has fluctuated so much with the oven being opened and closed and the canele spending time, as needed, out of the oven). Watch for the tops to completely turn a deep golden brown and bubble (this is the butter in the batter) around the edges and middle. When the desired color is achieved on the tops, remove one from the oven using the tongs to test. Allow it to cool for several minutes, then invert the mold onto the cooling rack. If you are pleased with the color of the canele, then remove the rest from the oven and allow them to cool for several minutes before unmolding. If you are not, return the canele to its mold and bake the batch longer. The canele should cool on the rack for 30 minutes before eating, and are best if consumed no more than 5 hours after baking."

Scrape the powder off the sides of the bowl and resume processing. Repeat these steps for 20-25 minutes, scraping the bowl every few minutes as needed. After 10-12 minutes, the powder will begin to clump into a crumbly dough; after 15 minutes the clumping should be more evident and even audible; after 20 minutes or so, the crumbly dough will miraculously coalesce into a mass of green clay.

      "Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0 F and have two parchment lined cookie sheets at the ready, plus to extra sheets of parchment. In the bowl of a food processor, combine the flour, oats, cocoa and dried apples. Set a timer to two minutes and process continuously for that time. Sift and reserve and large bits of oats or apple that remain. Process the large remaining bits another 2 minutes. They will still not be small enough to sift, but they should by now be incredibly small. I've found 4 minutes of total processing is perfect to get this texture: it's important that no visible oat flakes remain and that all apple bits have been ground to pieces smaller than, say, a lentil. Combine with the previously sifted ingredients. Set dry ingredients aside.",
      "With a hand or stand mixer, cream together the butter, oil, sugar, molasses, corn syrup, baking soda, baking powder, salt, ginger, cinnamon and mace until thoroughly combined and lightened; about two minutes. Add in the egg and beat another minute more. With mixer set to low, add in the dry ingredients all at once and mix until homogenous. Drizzle in the milk and mix until fully incorporated. Shut the mixer off, scrape down the bowl and beater thoroughly with a rubber spatula. Use a",
      "(a two teaspoon scoop) to portion the dough about 15 per cookie sheet. Be sure to give the cookies ample room, they will spread considerably during baking.",
      "Bake for about 8 minutes, or until the cookies have puffed and set. You may want to bake one tray by itself to determine the optimal bake-time for your oven. The cookies should seem a little underdone, but will firm up as they cool. If they cool to a crisp, bake the next batch a few minutes less. Bake off remaining cookie dough. Cool the cookies thoroughly, then flip half over to await filling. Should they stick to the parchment, use a metal spatula to gently loosen them.",
      "In a medium bowl (or the bowl of a stand mixer) combine the gelatin with half the water, 1 1/4 ounces. Mix with a fork to ensure no lumps of gelatin remain. Set aside. In a very small pot, combine the remaining water, corn syrup, sugar and salt over medium heat. Stir gently with spatula to ensure the sugar dissolves, but avoid splashing the mixture onto the sides of the pot. Cook until the mixture registers 240\u00b0 F on a candy thermometer. When it does, immediately shut off the heat and cool to 210\u00b0. It is very important the mixture cools all the way to 210\u00b0 before proceeding! Once cool, add the sugar syrup to the gelatin mixture and whip on low speed until the gelatin has fully dissolved. Increase the speed to medium high and whip until light, fluffy and tripled in bulk. While still mixing, add in the vanilla and the butter, a teaspoon at a time. Scrape the bowl down, if necessary, and whip until no specs of butter remain. Use a spatula to transfer the mixture to a pastry bag. The filling is more of a \"cream\" than a \"fluff.\" If you find it tricky to work with, let it stand for an hour before piping. Pipe a quarter sized dollop of filling onto half the cookies (less than you think!), then sandwich with the remaining cookie halves.",
      "The cookies are delicious to eat right away, but will gain a more authentic texture the following day, when the gelatin has had a chance to set. Store in an airtight container one week at room temperature."

      "Pour the vodka evenly over the dry ingredients, a few tablespoons at a time, using a rubber spatula to press the dough together. Similarly, add the water, and continue to press the dough together to form a large ball. The dough should be fairly wet and sticky; if for some reason it seems particularly dry, add a little extra ice water a tablespoon at a time until everything comes together easily. (Be careful to work the dough as little as possible; otherwise the crust may be tough.)",

On a lightly floured surface with a lightly floured rolling pin, roll one piece of dough into a rough 12-inch circle about 1/8 inch thick. Transfer the dough circle to the baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining dough disk, placing it next to the first dough circle on the baking sheet.",
      "Give the pear mixture one final stir and arrange 1 cup of pears in the center of the first dough circle, leaving a 1-inch edge all around (if your pears are very juicy, you may wish to strain off half of the liquid first). Crumble half of the goat cheese evenly over the fruit filling.",
      "Starting on one side, fold the edge of the crust up and over the edge of the filling. Make your way around the circle, folding up the extra crust and pleating it as you go. The crust should not meet in the center; the edges just have to be tucked up toward it. The look you're going for by the end is a very rustic tart.",
      "Repeat the filling, topping, and folding with the remaining pears, goat cheese, and dough circle.",
      "Bake until the crusts are golden brown and the cheese has browned on top, 30 to 40 minutes. Serve warm."

Cover the pastry case with plastic wrap, fill with baking beans and lightly fold the cling film over the top of the beans. Bake in an oven preheated to 375F until the pastry is golden brown around the edges. Remove the plastic wrap and beans and return the pastry case to the oven until golden brown. Lightly beat one of the egg yolks. As soon as the pastry case comes out of the oven, brush all over the inside with the beaten egg to seal any little holes.",

Put the seeds and pod in a saucepan with the double cream and bring slowly to the boil to infuse the cream with the vanilla. In a large bowl, mix the 9 remaining egg yolks and the sugar together just for a minute with a whisk. Then pour the boiling cream onto the mixture, whisking constantly to prevent curdling. Pass through a fine sieve. If there is lots of froth on top, just spoon it off and discard. Pour the custard mix into the baked pastry case, then grate some nutmeg on top (do not use ready-ground nutmeg). Place carefully in the oven without spilling any of the filling down the sides of the pastry case; if you do, you will end up with soggy pastry, which is a no-no for custard tart.

Add the eggs one at a time, scraping down the sides and bottom of the bowl between additions. Blend in the molasses. Add the dry ingredients all at once and combine on low speed, scraping down the bowl as needed to create a unified dough.",

Using a 21/2-inch round cookie cutter, cut out disks and place them 1 inch apart on the prepared baking sheet.",

Blend the mascarpone, cream, and sugar in the cold bowl on low speed until combined. Increase the speed to medium high and whip just until the cream becomes thick and fluffy and holds a stiff peak (warning: overmixing will cause the contents to curdle.) Blend in the vanilla or brandy on low speed until just incorporated.",

Remove the tart shell from the fridge, trim the overhang off of the edge of the tart, patch any thin parts or cracks with excess dough. Line the tart shell with foil and fill with weights or beans. Place the tart in the center of the bottom rack of the preheated oven. Bake for 20 minutes, rotating halfway through. Remove the weights and foil, and continue to bake until the bottom is golden brown, about 15-20 additional minutes. Cool the shell completely before removing from the pan or filling.",
      "When you're ready to serve, beat the pastry cream with the paddle attachment of a stand mixer on high speed until it is smooth and creamy. Select the 4 nicest looking pineapple rounds and set aside. Chop the rest of the pineapple rounds into 1/2 inch pieces. Line the bottom of the cooled tart shell with the pieces. Spread the whipped pastry cream over the top, so it leaves a few centimeters of room for the pineapple rounds. Press the rounds into the surface of the tart, so the pastry cream and pineapple are flat across the surface. Sprinkle with sugar all over, brulee the top so the sugar burns and caramelizes. Serve immediately."

Never pour water directly on top of the curds, but pour water along the sloped side of the bowl to gently envelope the curds. This brings the curds to temperature gradually.",
      "Let stand for a few minutes until the curds warm through. (Test by picking the largest piece of curd in the bowl and splitting it open. If it still feels cold on the inside, let stand for a little longer.) Warming the curds through helps them melt evenly once",

Use a wooden spoon to gently fold the curds over each other in the bowl. When you get one smooth, homogeneous mass, you are ready for the next step!",

      "Keeping the curd mass submerged in super hot water, gently pull one end of it away from your body (while guiding the remainder in the bowl with your other hand). Imagine you are guiding a fire hose or straightening a long stocking. Keep as much of the ball submerged under water as possible. (This will keep the curd smooth and silky.)",
      "Once the curd is loosely elastic and stretched, roll one end of the hose until it meets the other end-as if you are coiling a stocking. Then, take the mass in one hand and pass it through your other hand cupped in the shape of a \"C\".",

      "Repeat steps 5 through 8 with the remaining curd mass.",
      "Serve and eat as soon as possible! Fresh mozzarella can kept unrefrigerated overnight or for a few days longer in the fridge. Note that refrigeration will cause the cheese to seize up and lose its pillowy softness."

Tuck 2 cloves of garlic, one small thumb-sized piece of ginger, and the scallion into the cavity. Tie the legs together with kitchen string, keeping the cavity closed. When the water reaches a boil, add the chicken to the pot. Bring the water back to a boil, then reduce the heat to very low, cover the pot, and let cook for 30 minutes. Once done, remove the chicken and toss in enough ice water to completely cover the chicken. (At least 2 ice cube trays full should work.) The point is to cool down the chicken for 10 minutes, as much as possible. Drain and set aside.",

      "Combine the scallion, egg, and milk in a small bowl and whisk well. Gently fold the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients. Do not overmix. Cover the batter and allow it to rest at room temperature for 25 minutes.",
      "Preheat the oven to 200 degrees. Line a baking sheet with paper towels. Heat 2 inches of oil to 350 degrees in a large deep skillet (at least 12 inches in diameter).",
      "While the oil is heating, skewer each hot dog lengthwise, stopping about 1 inch from the top. When the oil is hot dip a hot dog into the batter, using the stick to twirl the dog and coat it evenly; make sure the bottom end of the hot dog is sealed, but try not to get too much batter on the stick. Remove the dog from the batter and twirl it once to let excess batter drip back into the bowl, then holding the stick end, lower the corn dog into the oil, keeping it suspended about 5 seconds before letting go (this will prevent the corn dog from sticking to the bottom of the pan). Dip 2 or 3 more hot dogs and add to the pan (do not fry more than 3 or 4 dogs at a time). Turn the dogs occasionally with tongs to make sure they cook evenly, and fry until the corn coating is a deep rich brown, 4 to 5 minutes. Lift them out of the oil one at at a time with a Chinese wire-mesh skimmer and transfer to the lined baking sheet, and then into the oven. Dip and fry the remaining dogs, making sure to let the oil come back to 350 degrees between batches, using a candy thermometer. (As you get near the end of the batter, you may need to spoon it over the dogs to coat them evenly.)",

Pour the milk over the yeast to soften, 1 to 2 minutes. Add 2 cups of the flour to the milk mixture, without stirring. Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and set aside in a warm place until the surface of the flour cracks, about 30 to 40 minutes.",
      "In a small bowl combine the egg yolks and sugar. Add the cider, melted butter, salt, cinnamon, vanilla extract, and 1 1/4 cups of the flour and mix until combined. Add this mixture to the yeast. Using the paddle attachment of an electric mixer, mix on low for half a minute, then turn up to medium for about 1 minute. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons of flour and mix on low for half a minute, then on medium for another half a minute. The dough will be very sticky.",
      "Sift an even layer of flour onto the work surface; scrape the dough out of the bowl, onto the work surface. Clean the mixing bowl and lightly coat it with vegetable oil. Gather the dough and return it to the oiled bowl. Cover it tightly with plastic wrap, and set aside in a warm place until the dough has doubled in size, about 1 1/2 hours.",
      "To prepare the apples: In a large skillet over medium heat, melt the butter. Using a small paring knife, split the vanilla bean lengthwise. With the back of the knife, scrape out the pulp and the seeds of the vanilla bean, and add the scrapings and the pod to the butter. Heat the butter until bubbly. Add the chopped apples, tossing to coat them with butter. Add the cinnamon and sugar, and saute 3 to 5 minutes until slightly softened and the majority of the apples are deep golden. Add the vinegar ad cider, and reduce over medium-high heat. If the apples are becoming too mushy, turn the heat up, so the liquid reduces quickly. If they are still very firm, turn the head down to reduce slowly. The apples should be cooked, but still slightly firm to the touch. Remove the vanilla bean and place the apples on a baking sheet to cool.",
      "Scrape the dough out onto a floured surface and stretch into a rectangle about 2 inches thick. Spread half of the apples over the dough and fold into thirds by bringing the bottom up and the top down, patting with your hands to flatten slightly. Scatter the remaining apples on top and fold into thirds again. Gather the dough together by tucking under the edges and return it to the oiled bowl. Cover and allow to rise until doubled in size, about 30 minutes.",

Dip the cutter in flour and, cutter as closely together as possible, cut out the fritters. Place them on a floured surface and allow to rest for 10 minutes, no longer.",
      "To prepare the glaze: In a small stainless steel bowl set over a pot of gently simmering water, combine the powdered sugar, cream, vanilla extract, and salt. Heat until just warm, stirring frequently. The glaze should be thin and translucent; if necessary, thin it down with more cream.",
      "Dip your hands in flour, and stretch the fritters by pulling them gently elongating the round shape into a 4-inch oval. Don't worry if you puncture the dough as you stretch it. Drop directly into the hot oil and fry according to instructions (link to the introduction about frying).",

Working in batches, add masa rounds and fry, flipping once, until well-browned and crisp, about 4 minutes per side.

Drain on a paper-towel-lined baking sheet. Continue until all masa shells are fried, adding more oil to the pan if necessary.",

Patience-this will take a few minutes. Once the sugar has melted, continue to cook, still stirring without stop, until the sugar caramelizes-you want the color of the caramel to be deep amber. Now, standing away from the stove so you don't get splattered, slowly pour in 1 cup of the cream and the milk. Don't panic-the caramel will immediately seize and harden-it will all smooth out as the liquids warm and the sugar melts again. Bring the mixture to a boil and, when the sugar has melted and everything is smooth again, pull the pan from the heat.

Carefully slide the pan into the oven; then, using a pitcher, fill the roasting pan with enough hot water to come halfway up the sides of the espresso cups.

To ensure that the sugar melts evenly, stir with a metal spoon. After two minutes when the sugar is relatively smooth, stop stirring and let the mixture cook undisturbed. Small bubbles will form at the edges of the pan and grow larger, migrating towards the center. After approximately 7 minutes from when you started cooking, the bubbles will cover the entire surface and the mixture will be simmering vigorously. At this point, the liquid should be completely clear.",

When the bubbles on the caramel become very orange, the caramel will turn the color of black coffee or molasses: at this point, immediately plunge the pot into the sink of cold water to stop the cooking. Rotate the pot around, checking the color and consistency of the syrup. (You may even want to remove the pot 10 seconds before the syrup turns the color of coffee, just to be safe.) Add the remaining 1/2 cup of water and wait for a few minutes. After the bubbling subsides, return the pan to the stove over medium heat.",
