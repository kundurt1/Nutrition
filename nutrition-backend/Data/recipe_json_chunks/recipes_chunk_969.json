Be sure to ask your guests how big they want their piece when you cut it. I don't usually serve it with the bone (it takes up too much room on the plate.",
      "3. Prepare the Roast by inserting slivers of Garlic all around, oil, then rub lots of Salt, Pepper, and Blacken into the meat, lay the sliced onions on top after you have placed it on a rack in a baking dish. Insert a meat thermometer into the thickest part of the meat in such a way that you will be able to see it through the window in the door without having to open it.",

Cook an additional 1 3/4 hours or until the meat thermometer reads 110 - 120 degrees, 110 degrees will give you a rare roast, pictured, and 120 degrees will end up med rare. If you like well done meat, don't waste your money on a prime rib, purchase a chuck or a top round and make a pot roast out of it.",
      "Cooking time should not change because you have a larger piece of meat, because, although the meat will be longer, the diameter will usually remain about the same. This timing works good for a roast that is 6\" - 7\" in diameter.",

      "6. Take the roast out of the oven and let it rest for 20-30 minutes loosely covered with alum. foil; this allows the roast to finish cooking and the juices to re-distribute. Don't worry about letting it rest too long because there isn't such a thing with Prime Rib (it's usually served at room temperature). Letting it rest, covered, lets it finish cooking. If you leave the thermometer in, you'll notice that it will actually go up about 10 degrees. If you wish to make gravy (sauce), you can set the meat on a separate platter, cover with aluminum foil, and use the pan drippings for the base of a sauce.",
      "7. If you don't have a rack to place the meat on, you can use rough cut carrots and onions. Make sure you spray some Pam on the pan prior to putting the vegetables inches Later, you can place these vegetables into the pot you're making the gravy in, and grind them up with an immersion blender to become part of the gravy / sauce."

Check dough consistency after 5 minutes of kneading. The dough should be in a soft, tacky ball. If it is dry and stiff, add water, 1/2 to 1 tablespoon at a time. If it is too wet and sticky, add 1 tablespoon of flour at a time. At end of cycle, remove dough; follow \"Rising, Shaping and Baking\" instructions below.",
      "Mixer Methods: Combine yeast, 1 cup flour, and other dry ingredients. Combine water, buttermilk and oil; heat to 120\u00b0 to 130\u00b0 F.",
      "Hand-Held Mixer Method: Combine dry mixture and liquid ingredients in mixing bowl on low speed. Beat 2 to 3 minutes on medium speed. By hand, stir in enough remaining flour to make a soft dough. Knead on floured surface until smooth, about 2 minutes.",
      "Stand Mixer Method: Combine dry mixture and liquid ingredients in mixing bowl with paddle or beaters for 4 minutes on medium speed. Gradually add remaining flour and knead with dough hook for 5 minutes or until smooth.",
      "Food Processor: Have all ingredients at room temperature. Put dry mixture in processing bowl with steel blade. While motor is running, add liquid ingredients. Process until mixed. Continue processing, adding remaining flour until dough forms a ball.",
      "Rising, Shaping and Baking: Place dough in lightly oiled bowl and turn to grease top and cover the bowl. Turn on oven to lowest setting for 1 minute, then turn it OFF. Place dough in oven to rise for 15 minutes. Press dough evenly into greased 9-inch square cake pan. Sprinkle top of dough lightly with flour. With sharp knife, cut dough into 12 rolls, cutting almost to bottom of pan. Cover; let rise in warm place until indentation remains after touching. Bake in preheated 400\u00b0 F over for 15 to 20 minutes until golden brown. Remove from pan. Break apart into rolls; serve warm.",
      "Notes & Tips: You can substitute Instant (fast-rising) in place of Active Dry Yeast in your recipes. When using Instant Yeast, expect your dough to rise faster. Always let your dough rise until ripe. Use equal amounts when baking using traditional methods. When using the Bread Machine, use 1/2 tsp Instant Yeast OR 3/4 tsp Active Dry Yeast per cup of flour in your recipe."

      "Place your water in a medium saucepan and add your unwrapped jolly rancher candies. Bring the water to a boil, then reduce to a simmer, stirring occasionally until the candy dissolves completely. Simmer for an additional 10 minutes, then set aside to cool to room temperature.",
      "-Prepare Your Buttercream-.",
      "Whip up some Milkmoon Meringue Buttercream (recipe #536136), you'll need 2x the amount listed in the recipe. Reserve 5 cups of this buttercream for your filling, and set the rest aside.",
      "Combine the 5 cups buttercream with your mascarpone, beating well to combine thoroughly. Add drops of Watermelon food coloring gel until you reach the same shade as the cakes you baked (cut a small amount off the top of one of your cakes to take a peek at the color inside).",
      "Take 1/2 of your reserved white buttercream and add Super Black food gel into it until you achieve a strong black. Hot tip: this color will deepen as it stands. Set aside.",
      "-Prep Your Layers-.",
      "Start by trimming the domes off your cakes. We want flat disks of cake so we can accomplish a tall build!",
      "Now torte your layers out. Torting is the process of cutting a large cake into smaller layers, and I like to torte my layers super thin. You can choose instead to just trim the domes and leave the cakes as-is for a four-layer cake, or torte each cake in half for eight layers. The more layers, the cooler the seed affect in the slice reveal, however!",
      "-Build Your Cakes-.",
      "Prepare two disposable piping bags, one filled with your black buttercream and the other with your red. Cut off the tips of each to create a hole that is roughly 1/8 of an inch wide, fairly small.",
      "Using a turntable as a base, center your first layer on an 8\" round cake drum with a small dab of buttercream in the middle to anchor the cake. Brush the layer with a small amount of jolly rancher syrup. Then, pipe a spiral of buttercream in the very middle of the layer, measuring about 1-1 1/2 inches wide. Smooth this buttercream, then pipe another spiral of buttercream starting about 1/8 inch away from the buttercream at the center, and extending all the way to the edges of the layer.",
      "Pipe your black buttercream into the opening left, creating a black ring in the middle of the layer. Smooth your red buttercream, being careful not to disturb the black ring. Place your next layer of cake on top, doing your best not to drag it around too much as you center it. Repeat until you reach your final layer of cake, at which point you can wrap the whole thing in plastic and refrigerate stack until firm, at least an hour.",
      "Remove from the refrigerator when the cake doesn't wiggle when you shake it, and place it on a turntable on the counter. Using a serrated knife, go around the cake trimming off those crusty sides. Wrap the nude cake in plastic, and put it back in the refrigerator.",
      "-Frost Your Cake-.",
      "You can start by crumb-coating the sides of your cake with a small amount of your white buttercream and refrigerate 10-20 minutes to set, or skip the crumb coat if you're confident diving right inches Leave the top un-coated! This will help with the watermelon slice illusion.",
      "Begin frosting your cake by placing about a 1/2 cup dollop of buttercream on top of your cake, and smoothing it out to the edges, making sure the buttercream overhangs the edges of the cake by at least 1/2 inch all the way around. Refrigerate until the buttercream is firm. Using a paring knife, trim the buttercream back so it's perfectly flush with the sides.",
      "To create the white layer of rind, place about two cups of your white buttercream in a disposable piping bag and cut a 1/4 inch hole in the end. Pipe the buttercream in rings up the entire cake, making sure to over-pipe at the top so the white buttercream sticks up in a ring around the top. Use a straight-edge to smooth your buttercream on the sides-I use a 14\" quilting ruler!-and refrigerate about 10-20 minutes.",
      "Take your remaining white buttercream and, using mostly Electric Green with a few squeezes of Leaf Green to deepen, create a bright green watermelon rind color.",
      "Repeat the piping process with the light green buttercream, working your way up the sides and then smoothing them down. Put the cake back in the refrigerator to firm up.",
      "-Paint Your Rind-.",
      "Melt down your remaining green buttercream in the microwave until it's a paintable consistency. Stir in more green coloring, including a few drops of Forest Green to deepen the hue. Using a flat or fan brush, brush your buttercream up the sides of your cake, creating loose, imperfect stripes. You can go for perfection if you like! You'll get a more cartoonish, less realistic look to your watermelon cake, which can be fun too. When you're finished, put the cake in the fridge again.",
      "-Trim the Top-.",
      "After 10-20 minutes when the buttercream is totally firm, use your paring knife to trim the white and green buttercream down from around the top of the cake, making it totally flush with the smooth watermelon red buttercream on the top. You'll reveal a perfectly smooth watermelon cross-section that will have your guests scratching their heads!",
      "Pipe about eight black seeds in a circle around the top using an Ateco 8\" round tip, piping teardrop shapes by piping a small pearl and drawing it to the center while releasing pressure on your bag.",
      "-Drumroll, Please!-.",
      "Create a picnic spread and get ready to blow your guests' minds-it's time to slice your watermelon! Using a non-serrated knife, line the point up with the middle of the cake and, holding the knife completely level, slice down in a clean, confident motion until you hit the board. Remove the knife, wipe with a paper towel, and repeat to cut a slice that is perhaps 1/4-1/5 of the entire cake if you want it to be able to stand freely. Then, push an offset spatula under the slice, and lift up, using your other hand to stabilize the top of the slice. Pop the slice out from the bottom up, and remove to reveal... a slice of watermelon, complete with seeds and a perfect rind!",
      "Enjoy!"

I've placed a heating pad in-between a layer of blankets and have rested the loaf pans over the blankets. Cover pans with towel or blanket away from drafts. Basically provide a warm environment. Be careful not to try to speed it too much because this can develop a yeasty taste in bread when rushed to rise."

Remove the tomatillos from the broth (take off the stems if they're still attached) and put into a food processor, along with the chipotle pepper and onion mixture. Puree until almost smooth.

Roll the tortilla around the filling, and place, seam side down, into a greased 9x13 baking dish. Repeat with the rest of the tortillas and filling, arranging them in rows in the pan, however you can fit them inches If you have any filling left over, you can sprinkle it over the top of the enchiladas. Pour the rest of the sauce over the whole thing, and then sprinkle with the grated cheese. At this point you can refrigerate them overnight or until you're ready to cook them, or move them directly to the oven.",

A little labor-intensive, but worth the wait. Hope you enjoy them!"

Afterwards, I place the eggs in cold water (which I also added ice cubes to it), and let the eggs sit for 15 minutes.

      "As the brisket cooks the water will go away. You may need to add a little water during the cooking process, but near the end when the meat muscle fibers begin to break down the water will just sort of dissolve and the meat will be very tender. Cooking time is determined by size of meat and heat. You could speed it up some with a higher setting, but I cook on big burner on a setting of about 3-4 (out of 10max) after bringing it to a boil. A typical trimmed brisket flat works great for this because it fits in a stovetop pot, and doesn't take too long- should be ready in 4-5 hours cooked slowly until the meat is easily pulled apart with two forks."
