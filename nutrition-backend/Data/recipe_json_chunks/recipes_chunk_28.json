      "Preheat oven to 300\u00b0. Quickly rinse the beef under running cold water and pat dry with paper towels. Cut into 1-inch cubes and season to taste with garlic pepper and salt. Transfer to a Dutch oven or other heavy ovenproof casserole dish. Add the onions, garlic, potatoes, carrots, celery, mushrooms and peas. Pour in enough tomato juice to cover the ingredients by about 1/2 inch. Cover tightly and place in the oven above a baking sheet or large piece of foil set on a lower rack to catch any juices that overflow. Cook until meat is tender, about 4-6 hours. Serves 8."
