Heat 1/4-inch of fat or oil in skillet until a drop of water sizzles. Start with meaty pieces first; slip in slimmer parts as meaty pieces brown. Don't crowd pieces. Reduce heat gradually when browning begins. Turn 2 or 3 times with tongs. Never pierce with fork. When chicken is light tan, add 1 to 2 tablespoons of water; cover tightly. Browning will continue. As a guide to doneness, allow 50 to 60 minutes after chicken is covered. For extra crispness, uncover skillet for the last 10 to 12 minutes."
