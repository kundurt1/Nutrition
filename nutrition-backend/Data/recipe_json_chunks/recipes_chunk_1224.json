Using the dough hook, add gluten flour and process 3 - 4 minutes until smooth and forms into a rubbery ball. Remove dough and divide into two parts. Shape each part into a log shape approximately two inches around. Slice each log into 1/4 inch slices. Drop steak slices into boiling broth. When all steak slices are in the broth, turn heat down to a slow simmer and cook approximately 1 - 2 hours. Steak pieces will almost double in size and become lighter in color. Remove from broth and use in any recipe asking for gluten steaks or grind steaks and use in place of burger. Enjoy!",
      "Brenda Walsh, one of the sisters, says she likes to use this recipe for so many things, such as placing the steaks on a baking sheet sprayed with non-stick cooking spray and baking for 30 minutes. This changes the texture to a slightly more \"chewy\" consistency. Then placing them in a baking dish and pouring mushroom soup over them and baking for 1 hour. Delicious and easy! She also likes to make \"steak\" sandwiches with them. Try frying these with onions, placing them in a baking dish, pouring canned tomatoes over them and baking for one hour."

      "You do not want to use any colored vinegar, because they will give the veggies a dull, muddy color.",

      "Rinse any veggies that haven't been done, and spin or pat them dry, or whatever seems appropriate.",
      "Place the squash and eggplant pieces in a colander, sprinkle the cut sides generously with kosher salt, and set aside for their juices to drain.",
      "Bring a medium saucepan, half full of water, to a full rolling boil, and fill your sink half full of ice and water; lots of ice.",
      "Drop the unpeeled pearl onions in the boiling water for 50-60 seconds to loosen their peels, and transfer to sink using a slotted spoon.",
      "When cooled, cut off the ends, squeeze gently, and the onions should just pop out.",
      "If you want to keep the different veggies separated so you can compose the jar (s) of pickled stuff, have someone help you transfer stuff from the sink to a colander to drain, then into baggies or to small dishes as soon as cooled.",
      "Otherwise, just keep dumping them into the sink, adding more ice whenever necessary.",
      "Blanch the peeled garlic in boiling water for 30 seconds, then transfer to sink.",
      "Repeat with mushrooms, bell peppers, daikon, radishes, green beans, carrots, banana, jalapeno, and cherry peppers, and asparagus spears.",
      "The cauliflower should be blanched for about 60 seconds, and the celery and grape tomatoes for 10 seconds each, just long enough to set their color.",
      "Wash salt off squash and eggplant, and blanch them for 30 seconds, then transfer to sink just long enough to cool, then blot dry.",
      "If you have no one to help, it will just take twice as long to do the blanching stuff.",
      "If you would prefer, steam the veggies, and double all the cooking times.",
      "Steaming is my preference, as it maintains more of the natural flavor.",
      "Regardless of other considerations, don't let any of the veggies soak in the cold water for too long, or they will get soggy, which we don't want.",
      "They will get somewhat soggy while pickling, and we don't want them to be any worse than necessary.",
      "If desired, don't blanch anything, or blanch for 10 seconds to kill any surface critters on the veggies, but the veggies will lose color faster.",
      "Some veggies will lose all color within hours, others will take longer; the bright red radishes will turn almost white, and the brilliant purple eggplants will become a pale pastel lavender color, but they still taste good.",
      "The green stuff will slowly turn grayish, which is the only reason broccoli isn't included in the recipe (other than the fact that Mom can't have it. Otherwise it would be listed as an optional ingredient. Go ahead and include it if you like it and don't plan to store the giardiniera for too long).",

      "Remove from heat, and allow to cool for 20-30 minutes, but still quite hot.",

      "While doing all this, you should have been sterilizing your canning jar (s).",
      "The easiest way is to run the jars and lids through the dishwasher on longest, hottest cycle, including the full drying cycle, and then put them on a towel in a 225 degree F oven so they can dry, and the heat can kill any bugs that didn't die in the dishwasher.",
      "We use 2 rubber-gasket one-gallon jars, but you can use smaller canning jars if desired.",
      "This will be kept in the fridge without being processed in a boilingwater bath, and it will still keep for months.",
      "Rinse, dry, and stem your chives, basil, dill, and oregano, if you haven't already done so.",
      "Break out the thawed artichoke hearts, and cut them into bite-size piece.",
      "Arrange all the other veggies on the kitchen counter if you are going to try to make the jars look pretty; otherwise, just throw everything in a giant bowl, and toss to combine.",
      "Pack all the veggies into the jar(s) fairly tightly, arranging them as desired; don't forget to insert the herbs as you go.",
      "If you end up with a few extra veggies that won't fit in the jars, throw them in a lidded plastic bowl that is just large enough to hold them; this shouldn't happen, though; ingredient amounts are pretty precise.",
      "Divide the brine equally between the jars of veggies; it's probably best to use a measuring cup, one cup here, one cup there, saving a little for the leftovers if desired.",
      "Top up the jars to the brim with distilled white vinegar.",
      "Use a chopstick, skewer, or skinny spoon to remove air bubbles from the jars, and tap the jars on the counter to help remove bubbles, repeating a couple times.",
      "Add more vinegar if necessary. Wipe off the top of the jars, and seal them.",
      "After 12 hours, gently shake or roll jars, turn them upside down, and allow to set for another 12 hours at room temperature.",
      "Place jars in refrigerator for 1-2-3-4 weeks to age and mellow, though they taste pretty good after just 1-2 days; it's up to you!",
      "They should keep in the fridge for at least 6 months... probably longer... but the colors will get uglier, and the veggies will get mushier.",

Cut apple sticks to this size and place on top of the rice followed by a piece of duck which should be just smaller than this."

    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "Estimate which slow cooker the drawerful of apples in the fridge will fit into. Note1: Wrinkled apples are not necessarily \"bad\". Granny Smiths can look nearly new but be mealy and browning under the skin (toss them), while Braeburn and especially Gala apples may look terrible, but the flesh is still unblemished and evenly colored. Cut out any bad spots, and often an apple browning on one side is fine on the other half. Use the other half. A slow cooker will hold this at 180F or higher for the first couple of hours, then at least 140 for a long time after that. After you cook, mill/sieve, season, cook and reduce by a third, there isnt much original apple shape left. Don't be obsessive. :-). Note 2: The flavor is in the peel, the pectin is in the core and the sugar is in the flesh. Don't peel or core the apples, just wash them, remove the stems and loose seeds, then cut out the \"flower\" parts opposite the stems, there tends to be powdery dirt and mold there.",
      "re note 2: Wash the apples, quartering most of them. Pick out any loose seeds. Toss the quarters in the slow cooker. Quarter and add the others if it looks like they will fit, otherwise set them aside.",
      "Set the cooker on high for at least an hour or two.",
      "Quarter and add any apples that did not fit, forcing them below the surface. Cook on high an additional hour or two. Skip this step if there were no extras.",
      "Place a food mill over a large bowl and ladle a portion of apples into it. Crank them through using downward force on the crank, reversing now and then to clear the screen. Pick out the seeds as you go. Repeat until all apples have been milled. You can use a sieve, but it will take a while. Discard the flakes of skin, seeds and stringy bits. Clean the mill IMMEDIATELY, the pulp is acidic and will stain the plating and rust any exposed steel.",
      "Blend the \"applesauce\" smooth with the stick blender if it makes you feel good. Clean the blender too.",
      "Dump them back into the slow cooker. Add: 1/4 tsp allspice, 1/8 - 1/4 tsp (scant) cloves, 1/2- 3/4 tsp cinnamon. Stir and taste. Cook on low for 8 - 12 hours. This should taste good with balanced flavors, but not strong. The seasoning will be concentrated as it cooks and you can adjust later. Note on sugar: Most recipes use double to triple the spices, then add somewhere between 1/2 cup to a full cup of sugar PER PINT of pulp. I suspect a lot of this sugar is to to preserve the butter in pre-refrigeration days and to counter the bitter undertaste of the spices. I tend to use less spice and little if any added sugar. You can always add more later.",
      "Taste and adjust seasoning, remove lid and cook another 2-4 hours. Keep a close watch and stir the thickened/solids at the edges into the rest. The pulp will darken from an over-cinnamoned applesauce color to chocolate or dark chocolate brown.",
      "Blend smooth with stick blender or that ice-crushing powered daiquiri pitcher on the counter.",
      "Chill and eat. Great on crepes, good on toast and I'm told even on steak."

If the gravy was on the thick side even when it was hot last night at dinner, thin it down with a little chicken stock. If you do not have enough turkey broth or leftover turkey gravy, measure what you have and add some chicken broth until you have approximately 4 total cups of liquid. When I made it last time, I had to add nearly 1 cup of chicken broth because I only had 3 cups of leftover turkey gravy. It tasted just fine.",
      "In a 10\" skillet with straight sides, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the scallions, peas, and carrots and cook for 2 minutes. Add the garlic and cook 1 minute longer. Add the turkey then the turkey broth/gravy/chicken broth and stir to combine. Bring to a simmer and taste for seasoning. Add salt and pepper to taste. Don't under season the broth. Once the dumplings are added, the flavors will be muted so season the broth a little more robustly than you normally would.",
      "While you are waiting for the broth to come to a simmer, make the dumplings by whisking together the flour, baking powder, and salt. When the broth mixture comes to a simmer and you have adjusted the seasonings, add the milk and melted butter to the flour mixture and use a spoon to stir everything together until it is just combined. Don't over mix or you'll toughen the dumplings.",
      "I use two soup spoons to add the dumpling dough to the broth. I scoop up some of the dough with one spoon and push it off into the broth with the other. Continue adding dough as quickly as you can - leaving a little room between dumplings, if possible. It'll be a tight squeeze to get all of the dough into the broth but it'll fit. IMMEDIATELY cover the dumplings with a tight fitting lid and cook for 20 minutes. Whatever you do, DON'T PEEK while they're cooking. The dumplings should lightly simmer while cooking. I normally reduce the heat to someplace between medium low and medium after the first 5 minutes of cooking so the liquid does not simmer too aggressively.",
      "After 20 minutes, take the skillet off the heat and serve piping hot. This is an EXCELLENT way to use up Thanksgiving leftovers. Delicious and easy!",
      "TIP: This recipe has a high ratio of dumplings to broth - which means that it is not particularly soupy when fully cooked. If you like a lot of soup with your dumplings, use the same amount of gravy base but halve the dumpling recipe."

Drop in half the pelmeni and cook, stirring occasionally with a wooden spoon to prevent sticking, until they rise to the surface and are cooked through, about 8 minutes. With a slotted spoon, carefully remove the pelmeni to a colander and drain well. Transfer to a deep serving bowl and toss with the butter.",

      "Note about Cream Puffs (Pate a Choux) - The Pate a choux dough is baked immediately in a well preheated oven to ensure the greatest expansion and lightness. When baked, the starches in the flour and proteins in the egg coagulate and eventually brown on the outside. During baking, the crust traps steam inside, generated from the moisture in its ingredients and hot air from the oven, plus leavening from the beaten eggs. It is this principle, that causes them to become inflated, hollow and stay puffy. A properly baked choux retains its puffy shape, with a hollow interior with an outside that is crisp and fairly dry, with an all over golden color. When broken apart, it should have a slightly moist crumb on the inside. However, if they are removed from the oven too soon, the structure of the shell has not solidified, and it will collapse. However, when you think they are done take one out of the oven and check it by breaking open and checking the interior walls. If wet and eggy, return to the oven as necessary. Remove when done and cool on a wire rack."

      "FOR THE WATERZOOI: Rub the chicken inside and out with salt and pepper. Butter the bottom of a large, heavy casserole with 2 tablespoons of the butter. Layer it with the onions, shallots, leeks, celery, carrots, and parsley roots. Lay the chicken pieces on top of the vegetables. Pour the wine and chicken broth over everything, season with salt and pepper, and bring to just below a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer very gently, without letting the broth come to a boil, until the meat on the chicken nearly falls off, about 2 1/2 hours. Remove the chicken and set aside or bone it, if you desire. Continue to simmer the remaining ingredients until the parsley roots are soft, another 30 minutes.",
      "In a medium size bowl, beat together the egg yolks, heavy cream, the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter, and a few tablespoons of the broth from the casserole. Remove the parsley roots and pass them through a food mill or mash them. Stir them into the egg mixture. Slowly pour the egg mixture into the stew, whisking all the time so the eggs don't curdle. Add the parsley and lemon juice and stir. Ladle the broth over the chicken pieces and serve immediately. Makes 6 to 8 servings.",
      "CHICKEN BROTH:",
      "This is a nice homemade broth that can be used for recipes calling for chicken broth. For duck broth, replace the chicken bones and meat with a duck carcass and for rabbit broth, replace with rabbit bones. For recipes calling for a rich chicken broth, first roast the chicken bones in a 425\u00b0F oven until golden before proceeding with the recipe.",
      "Put all the ingredients, except the salt and pepper, in a stockpot, and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to a simmer and skim off the foam from the surface until no more appears. Partially cover the pot and simmer over very low heat for at least 6 hours.",
      "Pour the broth through a strainer (a chinois, or conical strainer, would be ideal) and discard all the bones, vegetables, and bouquet garni. Now line the strainer with cheesecloth and pour the broth through again. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Place the broth in the refrigerator until the fat congeals and remove. The broth can kept, refrigerated for up to 1 week, or frozen for up to 6 months. Makes 3 to 4 quarts.",
