      "Special equipment: a grill, kitchen twine and 8 long skewers.",
      "Split the lamb belly into two pieces, crosswise. Season both sides well with salt and let sit uncovered in the refrigerator for 24 hours.",
      "For the cashew date romesco:",
      "Add the olive oil, garlic and shallot to a large skillet over medium-low heat. Slowly toast the garlic and shallot, being careful not to burn, until the garlic is a light golden brown, about 5 minutes. Remove the garlic and shallot with a slotted spoon and set aside. Add the tomatoes and dates and gently heat until softened, about 5 minutes. Strain the oil and reserve.",
      "Combine the garlic, shallot, tomatoes, dates, cashews, vinegar and 1/4 cup of water in a blender and puree. Slowly stream 1/2 cup of the reserved oil into the blender to emulsify the ingredients. Add up to 1 /2 cup more of the oil, if needed, in order to reach a smooth puree the consistency of room temperature peanut butter. As an alternative, set aside some of the ingredients before blending, then hand-chop and fold them into the romesco to create a chunky texture.",
      "Adjust the seasoning with more salt and sherry vinegar if needed.",
      "Prepare a grill for indirect heat, maintaining a temperature of 200 to 225 degrees F.",
      "Brush one piece of lamb with 1/2 cup of the cashew-date romesco, roll it up as tightly as possible and secure with kitchen twine. Repeat with the second piece of lamb.",
      "Place the lamb on the grill and frill uncovered until it reaches an internal temperature of 140 degrees F, about 1 hour. Remove and let cool to 110 degrees F. Wrap each roll tightly in plastic wrap to compress it and transfer to the refrigerator to cool completely.",
      "For the pea and fava bean salad:",
      "Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Blanch the English peas and fava beans separately in the boiling water until they are tender and bright green, about 30 seconds for the peas and 1 minute for the favas. Shock in an ice bath to stop the cooking.",
      "Combine the English peas, fava beans, sugar snap peas, dates, lemon juice, olive oil, pickled onions, yogurt and some salt in a medium bowl. Toss well to coat evenly.",
      "To serve:",
      "Increase the grill to high heat. Cut each roll of lamb into 6 to 8 slices, about 1 1/2-inches thick. Thread 2 slices on each skewer so that the skewer is holding the pinwheel together. Brush with some of the cashew-date romesco. Grill the lamb over high, indirect heat until the outside of the lamb is charred and some of the fat is rendered.",
      "Brush each plate with some of the remaining cashew-date romesco; top with some pea and fava bean salad and 2 slices of lamb. Squeeze the lemon over the lamb and garnish with the mint. Reserve the remaining lamb for another use."

      "If you're going to make your own cake, proceed as follows. Preheat the oven to gas mark 4/180\u00b0C Butter and line the bottom of a 23cm springform tin.",
      "Sift together the flour and cornflour, and add the cocoa, pushing it through a sieve. Whisk the separated yolks with half of the sugar - you can judge this by eye - until the mixture becomes pale and moussey.",
      "In a separate bowl, whisk the egg whites with a pinch of salt until firm, then whisk in the remaining sugar, one spoonful at a time, until you have gleaming white peaks.",
      "Gently fold the yolk mixture into the whites, and then add the flour, cornflour and cocoa, folding gently again until combined. Pour this moussey liquid into the tin and bake for 30 minutes. The cake will be almost silicon-springy on top. Unclip the tin and let the cake cool on a rack, right side up.",
      "Meanwhile, to make the syrup, bring the sugar and water to a boil in a small saucepan and let it bubble for a scant minute before taking the pan off the heat and adding the coffee or espresso powder made up with water, and the rum. Stir - just with a fork or anything - pour the hot syrup into a jug or bowl and let it cool.",
      "To make the filling, put the yolks, sugar and rum into a bowl that will fit over a saucepan of barely simmering water. Whisk (I use a hand-held electric mixer for this) until the mixture has thickened airily and then lift the bowl off the pan and let it sit on a cold surface while you whisk for another few minutes to help it cool down. Don't agitate yourself too much about whether it's thick enough or not: as long as it has thickened, the marscarpone and cream will give it the right texture to fill the cake with later.",
      "Make sure your rum-zabaglione mixture is pretty well cool before whisking in the mascarpone. Softly whip the cream in a separate bowl and beat or fold that into the filling as well.",
      "To assemble the rococoa cake, cut the cake you made into thin vertical slices, that's to say as if you were slicing a round loaf of bread rather than a cake. If using the bought loaf cakes, cut into slices along the length of the cakes, as thinly as you can. Don't worry about breakages: you are, after all, able to wodge everything together with the syrup in the tin. So: brush a 23cm springform tin with some of the syrup and then layer a third of the sliced chocolate cake, laid horizontally, to line the bottom of the tin. Brush again with the syrup to dampen the cake and seal the joins.",
      "Spread the layer of chocolate cake with half of the zabaglione using a rubber spatula and a light hand to coat evenly, and then add another layer of cake slices to cover.",
      "Dribble again or brush with the syrup until the cake is damp as before, and then spread over the final half of the filling.",
      "Cover with the final third of chocolate cake slices and drip, pour or brush over the syrup to give the cake a smoothish layer, which can be iced later; if the cake is damp, there's no call to drench it. And if the top of the cake is quite wet, don't be tempted to use all of the syrup; the bought chocolate cake is often damper and denser (and needs less syrup) than the homemade cocoa-sponge.",
      "Put the cake, covered with clingfilm, in the fridge overnight to set. You can ice the cake ahead of your dinner party and put the cake back in the fridge again (though see the caveat in the final paragraph below), but do let it set overnight first.",
      "To make the icing, put the sugar, syrup, rum and espresso powder into a small saucepan and bring to the boil. Turn off the heat and add the chopped chocolate, swirling it around so that the chocolate melts in the hot liquid. Leave for a few minutes and then whisk everything together in the pan (just using a little hand whisk) to make a smooth shiny glaze. Moving quickly, spring open your tin, taking care with the sides as the cake will be damp and delicate; you might want to run a small spatula around the inside first.",
      "Sit the cake on a plate or stand (don't even think of trying to loosen it from the tin's base) and pour over the icing, not worrying if it dribbles down the sides too much. You may need to ease it over the top of the cake while it is still malleable. It will set quite quickly - the fridge will have made the layer it sits on very cold - and you will ruin the finish if you try and spread the icing after your initial pouring.",
      "Scatter with gold sprinkles, nibbed or chopped pistachios, wafer roses, sugar flowers or any other decorations of your choice. The glaze will dull a little if you put it back in the fridge, so on the whole it's best to ice the cake and decorate it about 20 minutes before you want to eat it, or just before you sit down to dinner."

      "Alternative baking method - if your oven has the capability to do so, preheat oven and baking stone to 600 degrees. Adjust cooking time to 5-10 minutes, or until crust is crispy and golden brown. This method can also utilize bread flour, as it cooks at a high enough temperature to allow the bread flour to rise properly during cooking, yet not allow the glutens to break down during cooking and cause the dough to collapse, thus making for a soggy pizza. This is my preferred method, as it allows for a reduced cooking time and more of a \"brick oven pizza\" flavor and crispiness. It's also the preferable method to cook pizzas with more liquid ingredients, such as tomato sauce, fresh tomatoes, etc."

      "Bake the 2 cake pans for 25 minutes or cupcakes for 20-23 minutes. (Toothpick will come out clean when cake is done.).",
      "After cake has cooled, remove and frost with your favorite icing. (I like Magnolia Bakery's Buttercream Frosting, recipe #139518).",
      "TIP: I've found that the cupcakes get even more moist when stored overnight in a Tupperware container.",
      "Frosting Instructions: It is really easy to create the two-tone icing as shown in the photo above. Make your favorite buttercream icing recipe and divide it into 4 equal batches. Then add a dab of food coloring to each batch (I like Wilton's Icing Colors gels, purchased my local Michael's Craft Store). I used 4 different Wilton colors -- yellow, pink, sky blue and leaf green. Use a long metal spatula to fill a pastry bag with 2 colors. Put one color down each side of the bag. When you twist the top of the bag closed, the colors will form \"striped\" icing. Use the Wilton 2D Drop Flower tip to decorate the cupcakes, starting on the outer edge of the cupcake and working your way to the center in a circular motion. Each cupcake will be unique and beautiful!"

      "Preheat oven to 325\u00b0 F. Prepare two loaf pans by lining each with parchment paper, spraying with cooking spray and dusting them with flour. Set aside. In a medium bowl combine the flour, baking powder and salt. Set aside.",
      "In the bowl of an electric mixer, fitted with the paddle attachment, beat together the butter, cream cheese, and finely ground pistachios. Allow the ingredients to cream together for about 5 minutes, on medium high. Reduce speed to low. Slowly stream in the granulated sugar and continue to beat on medium-high until the mixture is light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl to ensure even mixing. Once the mixture is completely smooth, add the eggs, one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Add the vanilla extract and mix once more.",
      "Reduce speed to low and carefully add the reserved flour mixture; beat until just combined. Do not overmix the batter at this point. Fold in the chopped pistachios. Divide the batter among the prepared pans, and smooth out the tops with a rubber spatula. Bake for about 1 hour and 35 minutes, rotating the pans halfway through baking. The loaves should be golden brown and a toothpick inserted in the middle should come out clean. Let the cakes cool on a rack for about 20 minutes. Unmold and discard the parchment paper. Allow the cakes to cool completely before frosting.",
      "To make the glaze: Combine the powdered sugar, heavy cream and lemon juice in a bowl. Whisk until completely smooth. Drizzle cakes with icing and sprinkle with chopped pistachios, if desired. Serve right away. Any leftovers can be wrapped well with plastic or stored in an airtight container, at room temperature for a couple days. Enjoy!"
