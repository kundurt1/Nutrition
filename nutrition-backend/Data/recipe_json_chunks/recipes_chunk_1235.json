Have proper containers -- a wide mouth works perfect to scoop out the oils/salt mixture. Try and keep the oils from obtaining any bacteria and a longer shelf life, retrain from putting your fingers into the mixture. This mixture can be used on the rest of the body (except the face and sensitive areas) so use extreme caution if applying these areas. Vitamin E works as a preservative, so please include this. If gifting this to someone, mark the expiry date on the container and that this product contains nuts (allergies). This should last 1 - 1-1/2 years.

      "Prepare a bowl of water to use as sealant. Gently separate the lumpia wrapper as they are very frail and thin. Then place them one at a time on a flat surface or on the large plate. Place a heaping 2 to 3 tablespoon of the filling diagonally near the one corner of the wrapper - leaving 1 1/2 inch space on each corner. Take the bottom and top edges of the wrapper and fold them towards the center. Take the left and right sides, and fold them towards the center. Moisten the last edge of the wrapper to seal. Now repeat using the rest of the wrappers. You can cook the lumpia right away or you can freeze them. I usually line the lumpia with an inch distance from each other on a cookie sheet and freeze them then when they are hard, put them together in a zip loc. It will prevent the lumpia from sticking to each other. You do not need to thaw the lumpia when you are ready to cook them.Cook 3 to 4 pieces at a time by deep frying. Make sure to cook it in medium fire and that it is cook through in the inside. Sometimes, I have to re cook the Lumpia because of this."

And while it works, it wasn't going to work for me last weekend when we were having a bunch of family over for dinner. I wanted to prep as much as I could ahead of time so that I could enjoy them while they were at our house, instead of running around my kitchen like a chicken without a head (sorry, bad visual!) -- so this is what happened.",

      "Ready for the grill. (Or refrigerator, in my case -- as I was making them up early in the afternoon long before everyone arrived. This is what happens when there is a baby in the house -- you get stuff done while they are sleeping, even if that means making dinner at 2pm!).",

You'll see these especially if you press gently on the food. But don't just look for signs of fermentation; also get close with your nose and sniff for that clean but tangy pickled smell that means the safe, tasty and healthy transformation you're after is happening. Because of the spices, your fermenting fruit salsa will be more aromatic than plain vegetable ferments are.",
      "9.\tOnce the apple salsa has been actively fermenting for at least 24 hours, transfer it to the refrigerator or a cool, dark cellar. You won't need the plate under the jar any longer, because the cold storage temperature will slow down fermentation so much that there shouldn't be any overflow. If you opt for the refrigerator, store the apple salsa on the top shelf of the main compartment where it is the coolest. This will help the apples keep their crunch longer. Wait at least a week longer before eating the salsa."

      "Saute the chicken pieces in olive and sesame oils until browned. Drain and set aside.",
      "In a very large bowl, stir together the dressing ingredients well.",
      "Add the browned chicken and coleslaw mix or shredded cabbage to the dressing and toss well to coat. Set aside.",
      "Into a bowl, break up the ramen noodles into smaller pieces. In a saucepan, heat the amount of water according to package directions to a brisk boil and add the seasoning packets. Add the bowl of noodles all at once to the boiling seasoned water and cook, stirring occasionally, for 90 seconds. (You want the noodles slightly cooked, but not as limp as ramen will get if you cook it fully.) When noodles have cooked for 90 seconds, remove from heat and immediately drain.",
      "Add the semi-cooked drained ramen noodles to the coleslaw and toss again to combine well.",
      "Place salad in a large container and chill in refrigerator for at least 2 hours (it helps to cool and chill them if you stir the slaw a couple of times during chilling).",
      "Makes 4 entree-size servings. You can always stretch this salad by adding additional meat or packages of ramen! We've even added more semi-cooked ramen the next day to the leftovers. :).",
      "Note: for folks who like their salad spicy, the addition of crushed red pepper is nice, or a bit of Tabasco in the dressing. A bit of minced fresh sweet basil is also nice in this recipe. My husband sometimes adds sliced black olives to his serving. I also use about a 1/2 cup of slivered almonds, because I love their taste and texture in the salad.",
      "Note #2: if you don't have yogurt, you can use sour cream instead, but yogurt is preferred.",
      "Note #3: if taking to a picnic or potluck and you're concerned about the mayo in it, you might consider using Vegenaise instead of regular mayo, which has no eggs in it. Tastes just like old fashioned mayo, but lower fat and no eggs. See http://www.followyourheart.com for more info."

The unbaked dough freezes really well, enabling you to store the unbaked scones in your freezer and bake them up fresh when desired. Just cut the dough into wedges, place them on a tray in the freezer for an hour and then transfer the frozen wedges to a plastic freezer bag. On the day you want to bake them, take them directly from freezer to baking sheet lined with parchment paper (do not thaw first) and brush with milk. You will need to bake the frozen dough a bit longer, adding about 4 or 5 minutes onto the regular baking time."
