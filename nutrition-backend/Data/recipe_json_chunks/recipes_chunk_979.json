      "Wash a 4 to 5 pound chicken; twist wing tips and fasten so wings are akimbo and flat against back of chicken. Or if wings tips are cut off, skewer or tie chicken. Pat dry and rub about 1/2 teaspoon salt in body cavity. Dice the bacon and fry until crisp and brown in a Dutch oven or heavy, deep frying pan. Brown the chicken in the hot drippings, turning to brown sides, breast, and back. Brown giblets, if desired, or save for another use. Sprinkle with another 1/2 teaspoon salt while browning. Remove chicken from pan.",
      "Clean and slice leeks very thin, using just a small portion of the green tops. Add to bacon bits along with diced carrots. Cook until lightly browned; stir in flour and brown lightly. Add coarsely chopped cabbage, remaining 1/2 to 1 teaspoon salt, and pepper. (Amount of salt will depend on saltiness of stock.) Stir to mix thoroughly and when cabbage is slightly wilted, add chicken stock. Cook, stirring frequently, until simmering. Add chopped parsley; crush fines herbes and stir into vegetables. When stew is simmering gently, arrange chicken on top. Cover and simmer very slowly until chicken is tender, 1 to 2 hours depending on its tenderness. (A very old stewing chicken may take even longer.) Turn chicken several times and spoon sauce over it occasionally.",
      "To serve, cut slices from breast and cut legs, thighs, and wings into pieces. Arrange chicken pieces on beds of vegetables. Serve with potato cakes and spoon the broth over vegetables, chicken, and potato cakes. Makes 4 servings, perhaps with some leftovers.",

Don't add the liquids too rapidly or they will slosh out of the bowl. Continue mixing on low until the ingredients are completely incorporated and then beat on high speed for 4 minutes.",
      "Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and allow the dough to ferment at room temperature for 2 to 2 1/2 hours, or until it reaches the top of the bowl and doubles in volume.

Without pausing, carefully scoop up 1 piece of the dough, using the dough cutter and your free hand to hold each end, and lay the dough on a pieces of parchment paper, allowing the dough to stretch as it falls to form an oblong shape approximately 8 x 10 inches in area and 1 1/2 inches thick. It's more important to get the proper thickness than the right width or length. Repeat the procedure with the second piece of dough.",

Turn the temperature down to 450\u00b0F Spritz the oven with water 2 more times during the next 5 minutes. Refrain from opening the oven door for 15 minutes.",
      "After 15 minutes, slide the peel between the bread and the parchment paper and remove the paper. Return the bread to the baking tiles and rotate if necessary to ensure even baking. Continue baking another 5 minutes. With the peel, flip the bread upside down to allow even browning. Bake another 5 to 8 minutes for a total of 30 to 33 minutes. Remove the loaves from the oven and place them on a cooling rack. When the bread is cooled, dust off excess flour."

      "TO MAKE THE CAKE: In the top of a double boiler, over hot water, melt 6 oz. of the butter with the 6 oz of the unsweetened chocolate. When this is melted, remove it from the heat and transfer the mixture to a mixing bowl to cool to room temperature. While the chocolate and butter are cooling, lightly butter the bottoms of two 9-inch round cake pans and line the bottoms with parchment paper.",
      "Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F When the chocolate is cool, add the eggs, sugar, salt and vanilla and whisk together until well combined. Stir in the flour and pour the batter into the prepared baking pans and bake for 35 minutes or until a toothpick, when inserted in the middle comes out clean. Remove the cakes from the oven and cool them in the pans for 30 minutes. With a knife, loosen the edges of each of the cakes from the pans and turn them out onto a cake rack to cool completely.",
      "TO MAKE THE ICING: While the cake is baking, prepare the icing. In a small saucepan, combine the sugar, instant coffee and heavy cream. Bring this to a boil, and boil gently for 6 minutes. Remove from the heat and add the unsweetened chocolate. After the chocolate has melted, add the butter and vanilla and cool to room temperature.",
      "TO PUT THE CAKE TOGETHER: Set one of the cakes, top side up, on a plate and cover with a bit of the icing. Set the second layer upside down so the bottom is facing up and ice the top and sides. Pat the chopped nuts onto the sides of the cake, and center some in the middle of the top layer.",
      "Refrigerate the remaining icing until firm. Transfer the icing to a piping bag fitted with a rosette tip and pipe rosettes around the edges. Store the cake in the refrigerator, but bring it back to room temperature before serving."

      "PREPARE the SAUCE: HEAT 1/3 cup corn oil in a medium saucepan over medium-low heat; CHOP 1 medium onion together with 4 cloves of garlic in a food processor; SAUTE the onion and garlic mixture in corn oil until translucent and golden, and almost caramelized. ADD 1/3 cup flour to the saute mixture, until flour is lightly browned (the color of brown mustard); SPREAD the mixture evenly as it cooks. PLACE into the large bowl of a food processor enough fresh ripe Roma tomatoes to yield approximately 1 1/2 cups pureed, and one stem-removed seeded fresh jalapeno pepper; PROCESS both until pureed. SCRAPE the sauteed onion and garlic mixture from saucepan using a flexible spatula into the bowl of the food processor with the tomatoes and jalapeno, submerging the onion and garlic roux into the puree. PROCESS mixture until all ingredients until finely pureed. POUR pureed mixture into the same medium saucepan. STIR into the sauce mixture 5 cups water, 2 teaspoons salt, 1 1/2 teaspoons crushed Mexican oregano (crush between fingers) 1/4 teaspoon finely ground black pepper, and 1 large bay laurel leaf (and 1 pinch ground cinnamon and 1 pinch ground cloves if desired). BRING mixture to boiling while whisking; REDUCE heat to medium and cook for about 45 minutes, or until desired consistency is reached, whisking occasionally. COVER slightly vented so steam can escape; KEEP sauce warm over lowest heat, whisking as needed to refresh consistency until served, or reheat and stir before serving.",
      "ROAST fresh peppers if not using canned; KEEP stems intact; PLACE under broiler and broil on each side until evenly blistered slightly blackened; IMMEDIATELY place peppers into a large plastic ziplock bag and allow to steam for a few minutes; REMOVE skins from each pepper (they should slide off easily now); CUT a slit lengthwise down the middle or side of each (just big enough to slide in a stick of cheese or a mound of shredded cheese); CUP each pepper with one hand and pour gently running water into slit to flush out seeds.",
      "SOAK fresh or canned chiles in brine for a few minutes; CUT cheese into 6 long thin sticks (OR) shred cheese then thinly mound and mold 6 portions; REMOVE chiles from brine and blot with paper towels.",
      "STUFF each chile with one cheese portion then slip into pepper slit (if a chile tears don't worry, flour and egg batter will seal it well enough).",
      "POUR oil into an electric wok or an electric skillet (or enough oil into deep fryer); SET heat control to 265\u00b0F.",
      "MEASURE flour into a sifter or fine mesh collander; DUST each of the chiles well with flour on all sides and set aside (for torn chiles, apply extra flour at the seam then overlap slightly).",
      "BEAT egg whites in a medium bowl with one pinch salt, using an electric mixer until stiff peaks form; BEAT egg yolks in another bowl with one tablespoon flour and 3/4 teaspoon salt; ADD yolk mixture all at once to egg whites; FOLD together lightly but thoroughly while keeping the egg mixture fluffy.",
      "COAT one chile evenly with egg mixture, using rubber spatula if necessary to \"frost\" chile; HOLD chile by the stem; PLACE place carefully onto the hot oil; REPEAT with the remaining chiles, frying no more than 2 or 3 at a time.",

Put in a large baggie and let marinate at least 4 hours or all day. Remove and bring to room temp before grilling or you can pan sear. It will take just 4-5 minutes per side on high heat with good grill marks until you get good grill marks. This steak does not take long. Take off with rare and then cover and cover with foil to rest.",
      "Balsamic glaze -- As the steak is coming to room temp, start the balsamic glaze. In a small pot, heat up the oil and add the shallot. Cook until slightly soft or translucent and then add the balsamic and cook 10-15 on medium low until it reduces by half. Add the honey and thyme and a dash of pepper.",
      "Pea Puree -- Also before cooking the steak, make the bean and pea puree mix. In a saute pan, add the garlic, peas (thawed) and beans and stir on medium heat until well combined, add the chicken broth and cook another 3-4 minutes. Transfer to a food processor and do a quick puree, not smooth, just a rough puree but there is still some texture. Return to the pan and add the parmesan and rosemary and any additional chicken broth if needed. to make a nice puree.",

Remember to cut against the grain to make a very flavorful and tender cut. Against the grain is the secrete -- Top with the balsamic glaze and put small amount of the potato and bean puree on the side. The balsamic glaze not only goes well with the salad but with the bean and pea puree. All the components make for a great dish.",
      "OPTIONAL. I use a little balsamic, olive oil, dried oregano, and s/p that I brush on some good tomato slices and grill right before serving. It just tops all the whole dish. Even a little olive oil, s/p will work just fine."
