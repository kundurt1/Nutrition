      "Combine all of the ingredients in a mixing bowl.",
      "If using a mixer, use the paddle attachment and mix on the lowest speed for 1 minute.",
      "If mixing by hand, use a large spoon and stir for about 1 minute, until well blended.",
      "The dough should be coarse and slightly sticky.",
      "Let the dough rest for 5 minutes to fully hydrate the flour.",
      "Switch to the dough hook and mix on medium-low speed, or continue mixing by hand, for 2 to 3 minutes, until the dough is smoother but still soft, supple, and somewhere between tacky and sticky.",
      "Spread 1 teaspoon of olive oil on a work surface, then use a bowl scraper to transfer the dough to the oiled surface.",
      "Rub your hands with the oil on the work surface, then stretch and fold the dough one time, reaching under the front end of the dough, stretching it out, then folding it back onto the top of the dough.",
      "Do this from the back end and then from each side, then flip the dough over and tuck it into a ball.",
      "Divide the dough into 5 equal pieces, each weighing about 8 ounces (227 g).",
      "Form each piece into a ball, then place each into a separate sandwich-size freezer bag misted with spray oil.",
      "(Or, if you have room in the refrigerator, you can form the dough into tight balls and refrigerate them on a pan, as described below.)",
      "Seal the bag and refrigerate overnight or for up to 4 days, or in the freezer for several months.",
      "About 90 minutes before you plan to bake the pizzas, place the desired number of dough balls on a lightly oiled work surface.",
      "With oiled hands, stretch and round each piece into a tight ball, then place them on a pan thats been lightly oiled (preferably with olive oil).",
      "Loosely cover with plastic wrap and let rest at room temperature until ready to bake.",
      "About 1 hour before baking the pizzas, preheat the oven and a baking stone as high as the oven will go.",
      "If you dont have a pizza stone, you can assemble the pizzas on baking sheets covered with parchment paper and bake them on the pans.",
      "While the oven is preheating, prepare your cheeses, sauce, and toppings (see page 70).",
      "When ready to assemble and bake, put about 1 cup (4.5 oz / 128 g) of flour in a bowl.",
      "Use some of it to dust the work surface, your hands, and the peel, if you have one.",
      "Put one of the pizza dough balls in the flour to coat the bottom.",
      "Transfer to the work surface and gently tap it down with your fingers to form a disk.",
      "Slide the backs of your hands under the dough, then lift it and begin to rotate it, using your thumbs to coax the edges of the dough into a larger circle (see page 25 for photos of this process).",
      "Dont stretch the dough with the backs of your hands or your knuckles, let your thumbs do all of the work; your hands and knuckles merely provide a platform to support the dough.",
      "If the dough starts to resist and shrink back, set it on the floured work surface and let it rest for a minute or two.",
      "You can move on to another dough ball, repeating the same gentle stretching.",
      "Continue working the dough and resting it as need be until it is about 10 to 12 inches in diameter.",
      "It should be thicker at the edges than in the center and the center should be thin but not paper-thin.",
      "If the dough rips, you can try to patch it, or you can form it back into a ball, move on to another dough ball, and try again in 15 to 20 minutes.",
      "When the crust is ready to be topped, place it on the floured peel.",
      "Use flour rather than cornmeal or semolina, as it doesnt burn as quickly in the oven.",
      "Top the pizza as desired, then slide it onto the baking stone.",
      "If you arent using a baking stone, just put the panned pizza in the oven.",
      "Bake for about 4 minutes, then use the peel or a spatula to rotate the pizza.",
      "It will take anywhere from 5 to 7 minutes for the pizza to fully bake, depending on the oven (convection ovens bake faster).",
      "The edge should puff up and be a deep golden brown, perhaps even slightly charred.",
      "Remove the pizza, garnish as desired, then let it cool for 1 minute before slicing or serving."

      "This is nothing short of alchemy: you take the vilest, crunchiest supermarket strawberries, top them with an almondy, buttery rubble, bake and turn them into the taste of English summer on a cold day.",
      "Naturally, serve with lashings of cream: I regard this is obligatory not optional.",
      "Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Put the hulled strawberries into your pie dish (I use a round one) and sprinkle over them the sugar, almond meal, and vanilla extract.",
      "Give the dish a good shake or two to mix the ingredients.",
      "Now for the crumble topping: put the flour and baking powder in a mixing bowl and rub in the cold, diced butter between thumb and fingers (or in a free standing mixer).When you've finished with it, it should resemble rough, pale oatmeal.",
      "Stir in the sliced almonds and turbinado sugar with a fork.",
      "Tip this over the strawberry mixture, covering the strawberries in an even layer and giving a bit of a press in at the edges of the dish.",
      "Set the dish on a cookie sheet and bake in the oven for 30 minutes, by which time the crumble topping will have darkened to a pale gold and some pink-red juices will be seeping and bubbling out at the edges.",
      "Let stand for 10 minutes before serving, and be sure to put a pitcher of chilled heavy cream on the table alongside.",
      "Make Ahead Note: The crumble can be assembled 1 day ahead.",
      "Cover with plastic wrap and store in the refrigerator until needed.",
      "Bake as directed in recipe, but allowing extra 5 to 10 minutes cooking time and check crumble is piping hot in the centre.",
      "Freeze Note: Crumble topping can be made and frozen in resealable plastic bags, for up to 3 months.",
      "Sprinkle topping direct from freezer over fruit, breaking up large lumps with your hands.",
      "The assembled but unbaked crumble can be frozen, wrapped in a double layer of plastic wrap and a layer of aluminum foil, for up to 3 months.",
