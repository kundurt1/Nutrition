Add the water and continue to mix on low speed for 20 to 30 seconds, or until the dough comes together. It will be somewhat damp and sticky, with some drier spots. Transfer the dough to a lightly floured work surface and shape it into about a 5-in/12-cm square. Transfer the dough to the baking sheet and cover it loosely with plastic wrap.

Using the rolling pin or your palms, press, spread, and shape the remaining 1 cup/225 g butter into a rectangle that covers the entire right half of the dough; it should measure about 4 in/10 cm wide and 5 in/12 cm from top to bottom. Fold the left half of the dough over the butter and press down to seal the butter between the dough halves. Turn the dough 90 degrees clockwise so that the rectangle is 5 in/12 cm wide and 4 in/10 cm top to bottom, and generously flour the underside and top of the dough.",

Slowly begin rolling the dough from side to side into a long rectangle about 15 in/38 cm wide and 10 in/25 cm from top to bottom. The dough may be a little sticky, so be sure to flour the dough and the work surface as needed to prevent the pin from sticking. Using the bench scraper or a knife, lightly score the rectangle vertically into thirds. Each third will be 5 in/12 cm wide and 10 in/25 cm from top to bottom. Brush any loose flour off the dough. Lift the right third of the dough and flip it over onto the middle third. Then lift the left third of the dough and flip it on top of the middle and right thirds (like folding a business letter). Your dough should now be about 5 in/12 cm wide, 10 in/25 cm from top to bottom, and about 1 in/2.5 cm thick. Rotate the dough clockwise 90 degrees; it will now be 10 in/25 cm wide and 5 in/12 cm from top to bottom, with the folded seam on top.

      "4. Repeat the process once more, rolling out the dough into a long rectangle, again about 15 in/ 38 cm wide and 10 in/25 cm from top to bottom, and proceeding as previously directed to give it another turn. This time the dough will be a bit tougher to roll out and a bit more elastic. Try to keep the dough in a nice rectangle, flipping it upside down as needed as you roll it back and forth.",

This time, roll out the dough into a rectangle about 27 in/68 cm wide and 8 in/20 cm from top to bottom. Be firm with the dough. It may be a bit tough to roll out, and you'll need to have patience. Once again score the dough lengthwise into thirds, and then give it another business-letter fold (fold the right third over the middle third, and fold the left third over the middle and right thirds).",

To make the bread, over a sheet of waxed paper, sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, ginger, nutmeg, allspice and cinnamon. Set aside. In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the flat beater, beat together the butter, brown sugar, granulated sugar and orange zest on medium speed until well-blended, about 2 minutes. Add the eggs and pumpkin puree and beat until incorporated, 2 to 3 minutes. Using a rubber spatula, fold in the flour mixture in two additions just until smooth. Pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 55-60 minutes. Transfer the pan to a wire rack and let cool for 15 minutes. Meanwhile, make the glaze: in a small saucepan over medium heat, whisk together the water, orange zest, ginger and granulated sugar. Bring to a simmer and cook until slightly thickened, 3 to 5 minutes. Pour the glaze through a fine-mesh sieve set over a heatproof measuring cup. Tap the loaf pan gently on a work surface to loosen the bread. Set the rack over a sheet of waxed paper, invert the pan onto the rack and lift off the pan. Turn the loaf upright. Using a pastry brush, brush the bread with the warm glaze. Let cool completely or serve slightly warm. Serves 10."

      "In a cereal bowl, cover the nuts with water and let sit 4-8 hours. Drain, and pat dry very well with a paper towel. Combine all ingredients in a blender, and blend until all cashew bits have disappeared and mixture is completely smooth. If you have a Vita-Mix: Pour blended mixture into two ice-cube trays, and freeze until solid. Once frozen, pop out the ice cubes into your Vita-Mix by pushing a knife down one side of each section. Blend on high, using the tamper, until completely smooth with a soft-serve texture. Scoop out into individual bowls, using an ice-cream scoop for authentic presentation. Eat immediately, or freeze each bowl up to an hour for the perfect ice-cream consistency and texture. The best texture is achieved with a Vita-Mix, but if you don't have one you can still get a pretty good result with an ice cream maker. (If you don't have an ice cream maker either, just turn the blended mixture into really delicious popsicles! Also, a reader had success with a food processor by thawing the ice cubes a little extra, and it turned out like soft-serve.) Ice-cream-maker method: Pour the blended mixture into a large container, and freeze 30 minutes or refrigerate at least 4 hours. Pour chilled mixture into your ice cream maker, and follow the manufacturer's instructions. Once a smooth texture has been reached, scoop out into individual bowls, using an ice-cream scoop for authentic presentation. Eat immediately, or freeze each bowl up to an hour for a firmer texture."

You may also use some of the pickling juice to thin the hummus (I prefer to use the juice myself). Process the hummus until smooth and add salt if necessary. Transfer the hummus to a bowl. On the stove, heat 1/8 cup of oil until almost smoking. Once the oil is smoking, turn off the heat and then add the hot pepper flakes. The oil may sizzle. Let the oil cool to room temperature. You may choose to strain the oil, but I prefer to keep the pepper flakes in the oil. Once the oil is prepared, mince the jalapeno. Top the hummus with the jalapeno and chili oil. The hummus and the parsley oil may be made 3 days in advance and kept covered and chilled. Divide the hummus between shallow serving dishes and smooth the tops. Drizzle the hummus with the chili oil and jalapeno. Serve the hummus with the pita wedges and vegetables."

Place chicken thighs in the pan, skin side down, and cook 8 to 10 mins, until the skin is a deep golden brown. Turn the thighs over and cook a minute or two on the other side. Place chicken on the leeks. Turn off heat and discard the fat. Add chicken stock to the pan, and scrape to release the crispy bits. Pour the chicken stock over the braised leeks. Toss the chicken thighs in the bowl with the mustard mixture, slathering them completely, and then rearrange them over the braised leeks. Spoon any remaining mustard mixture over the chicken thighs. Top each thigh with breadcrumbs, patting with your hands to make sure they get nicely coated. (You want lots of mustard mixture and lots of breadcrumbs.) Bake about 40 mins, until the chicken is just cooked through. Turn the oven up to 475\u00b0F and cook the chicken thighs another 10 mins, until the breadcrumbs are golden brown."

      "1. To make the apple butter: In a large saucepan, combine the apples, butter, sugar, and salt. Split the vanilla bean in half lengthwise and scrape the seeds directly into the pan (save the pods for adding to a canister of granulated sugar for vanilla sugar). Place over low heat and cook, stirring occasionally, for 30 to 40 minutes, or until the apples break down and the mixture thickens and turns golden brown. The mixture will release a lot of water at first and bubble a lot and then it will slowly start to caramelize and get a bit darker; there may still be some pieces of whole apple, which is fine. Remove from the heat and let cool. (The apple butter can be stored in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 4 days or in the freezer for up to 2 weeks.)",
      "2. Line the baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside. On a well-floured work surface, roll the puff pastry into a rectangle about 24 in/61 cm wide and 12 in/30.5 cm from top to bottom. The dough may seem pretty tough and difficult to roll out at first. Don't be afraid to be firm with the dough as you roll it into the rectangle, flip it upside down, turn it side to side, pound it with the rolling pin to flatten it. Use a chef's knife to trim away any rough edges. Then, using the knife or a bench scraper, cut the dough in half vertically. You should have two 12-in/30.5-cm squares.",
      "3. Set one square aside and place the other square on the prepared baking sheet. In the center of the square, draw an 8-in/20-cm circle with your finger or lightly with a paring knife (without cutting all the way through). Using the offset spatula or the back of a spoon, spread the frangipane evenly on the pastry, filling just the circle. Top the frangipane with an even layer of the apple butter.",
      "4. Crack the egg into a small bowl and whisk with a fork. Using the pastry brush, brush some of the egg over the pastry around the circle.",
      "5. Again on a well-floured surface, roll the second puff pastry square so that it is slightly larger than 12-in/30.5-cm square. Drape the second square directly over the top of the first square. Using your fingers, press firmly all around the edges of the pastry to seal the two squares together. There will be a big mound in the center where the frangipane and apple butter are. Again, using your fingers, press firmly all around the circle; you want to enclose the frangipane and apple butter as much as you can within the circle.",
      "6. With a small paring knife, cut a scalloped petal pattern around the edge of the puff pastry to create a circle with a total of six or seven petals. Discard the puff pastry scraps (or save them for a quick treat: sprinkle with cinnamon-sugar and bake until golden. Refrigerate the pastry for at least 30 minutes or up to 2 days to allow the puff to chill and relax. (If chilling for longer than 30 minutes, cover the pastry with plastic wrap to prevent it from drying out. At this point, you can also wrap the unbaked pastry well with plastic wrap and freeze it for up to 2 weeks.)",
      "7. Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F/180\u00b0C, and place a rack in the center of the oven.",
      "8. Using the pastry brush, brush the entire top of the pastry, including the petals, with the remaining egg wash. Poke a hole in middle of the circular mound at the center of the",
      "and then, starting from the center of this hole, use the tip of the paring knife to trace a curved sun-ray pattern into the mound, spacing the rays 1/2 to 1 in/12 mm to 2.5 cm apart and covering the entire mound with the curved rays. You should have eighteen to twenty-four rays. Don't cut all the way through the puff; just lightly score the dough with the tip of the knife. Trace a crosshatch pattern on the petals.",
      "9. Bake for 1 hour to 1 hour and 10 minutes, or until the dough is entirely golden brown and baked through. Look at the sides of the",
      "where the puff pastry has puffed up to make sure the sides are also golden brown. Remove from the oven and let cool on the pan on a wire rack for at least 1 hour before serving to allow the filling to cool. This pastry is best served the same day, but you can hold it in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days and then refresh it in a 300\u00b0F/150\u00b0C oven for 5 to 8 minutes before serving."

    "title": "pan-seared ribeye with miso butter",
    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "For the miso butter, combine the softened butter and miso together in a small bowl. Add the green onions and pepper and combine. Keep at room temperature or roll into a 1 1/2-inch (3.8-cm) wide log in plastic wrap and refrigerate. Cut into slices before serving.",
      "There is one key difference to this method for thick steaks. The first step is to slightly warm the steaks in the oven before cooking on the stove. Adjust the oven rack to the center position and preheat the oven to 275\u00b0F (135\u00b0C). Add your cast-iron skillet to the oven to warm up. I like to use a preheated cast-iron pan because it retains heat very well for searing. Place a wire rack on a rimmed baking sheet, and set aside.",
      "Pat dry the steaks with paper towels, pressing out as much surface moisture as possible. Season both sides of the steak with salt and pepper. Transfer the steaks to the wire rack and place in the oven. The heat helps to dry the free moisture on the surface of the steaks for quicker browning and cook time in the pan.",
      "Cook the steak until the internal temperature reaches 90 to 95\u00b0F (32 to 35\u00b0C) for medium-rare, or 100 to 105\u00b0F (38\u00b0C to 41\u00b0C) for medium, about 15 to 20 minutes. The time will vary depending on the thickness of the steaks. Remove the steaks from the oven.",
      "In the warmed 12-inch (30-cm) cast-iron skillet, heat the vegetable oil over high heat until just beginning to smoke. Carefully add the steaks and sear until browned with a nice crust, about 2 minutes. Flip the steaks with tongs and sear until browned, 11/2 to 2 minutes, or until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of steak registers 120 to 125\u00b0F (49 to 52\u00b0C) for medium-rare or 130\u00b0F (54\u00b0C) for medium.",
      "Reduce the heat to medium and add the butter, garlic and white and light green parts of green onion. Turn the steaks onto their sides to cook and render any remaining fat, about 1 to 2 minutes. Briefly baste the steaks with the butter, garlic and green onion mixture. Basting the steaks as they cook with oil helps distribute any aromatics like herbs in the pan and evenly browns the surface. The butter is added toward the end to add flavor, mouthfeel and encourage more browning due to the milk protein solids in the butter.",
      "Immediately transfer the steaks to a clean wire rack set on a sheet pan to rest for 10 minutes. Serve the steaks topped with the miso butter, green onions and cilantro.",
      "Preheating the steak at low temperature activates enzymes called cathepsins in the meat that help to tenderize the beef, which occurs below 122\u00b0F (50\u00b0C). The goal with searing is to achieve a quick sear to create a thick brown crust on the steak without overcooking the interior."

      "Dust 2 baking sheets with semolina flour and set aside.",
      "In a large bowl, mix the squid ink, egg, and 120 grams (about 1/2 cup) water. Place the flour on a dry, clean work surface, forming a mound about 8 to 10 inches in diameter at its base. Sprinkle the salt in the middle of the mound. Using the bottom of a measuring cup, create a well 4 to 5 inches wide, with at least a half inch of flour at the bottom of the well.",
      "Slowly and carefully add the wet ingredients (squid ink, egg, and water) into the well, treating the flour as a bowl. Using a fork, gently beat the eggs without touching the flour walls or scraping through the bottom to the work surface. Then, still stirring, begin to slowly incorporate the flour \"walls\" into the egg mixture, gradually working your way toward the outer edges of the flour, but disturbing the base as little as possible. If the eggs breach the sides too soon, quickly scoop them back in and reform the wall. Once the dough starts to take on a thickened, paste-like quality (slurry), slowly incorporate the flour on the bottom into the mixture.",
      "When the slurry starts to move as a solid mass, remove as much as possible from the fork. Slide a bench scraper or spatula under the mass of dough and flip it and turn it onto itself to clear any wet dough from the work surface. At this point, with your hands, start folding and forming the dough into a single mass. The goal is to incorporate all the flour into the mass, and using a spray bottle to liberally spritz the dough with water is essential. It is a very dry dough, and it cannot be overstated how important it is to generously and constantly spritz to help \"glue\" any loose flour to the dry dough ball. When the dough forms a stiff, solid mass, scrape away any dried clumps of flour from the work surface, which, if incorporated in the dough, will create dry spots in the final product.",
      "Kneading is an essential step in the dough-making process: it realigns the protein structure of the dough so that it develops properly during the resting stage that follows. Kneading is simple: Drive the heel of your dominant hand into the dough. Push down and release, and then use your other hand to pick up and rotate the dough on itself 45 degrees. Drive the heel of your hand back in the dough, rotate, and repeat for 10 to 15 minutes. This is how Italian grandmas get their fat wrists.",
      "Pasta is easy to underknead but virtually impossible to overknead (unlike bread, where each type has its sweet spot or ideal kneading time). That said, even though the dough cannot be overkneaded, it can spend too much time on the worktable-and, as a direct result, start to dehydrate and be more difficult to form into its final shape. For best results, I think a 10 to 15 minute range is a solid guideline. When the dough is ready, it will stop changing appearance and texture. The dough will be firm but bouncy to the touch and have a smooth, silky surface, almost like Play-Doh. Tightly wrap the dough in plastic wrap.",
      "At this stage, the flour particles continue to absorb moisture, which further develops the gluten structure that allows pasta dough to stand up to rolling and shaping.",
      "If you plan to use the dough immediately, let it rest at room temperature, wrapped in plastic, for at least 30 minutes prior to rolling it out (the next step). If resting for more than 6 hours, put the dough in the refrigerator. It's best to use fresh dough within 24 hours. Under proper refrigeration, the dough will hold for 2 days.",
      "Rolling is the last phase of the mixing process. Rolling out pasta by machine-whether it's a hand-crank model or an electric one-should be a delicate, almost Zen-like art. You can only roll out dough that has rested for at least 30 minutes at room temperature. If it has rested for longer in the fridge, give the dough enough time to come back to room temperature. The fat content of pasta dough is so high that it will solidify when cold, so it needs to come back to room temperature to be easier to roll.",
      "The process for rolling sheets of pasta dough is the same whether you have a hand-cranked machine or an electric one, like we have in the restaurant.",
      "To start, slice off a section of the ball of dough, immediately rewrapping the unused portion in plastic wrap. Place the piece of dough on the work surface and, with a rolling pin, flatten it enough that it will fit into the widest setting of the pasta machine. You do not want to stress the dough or the machine.",
      "It's crucial to remember that whenever the pasta dough is not in plastic wrap or under a damp towel, you're in a race against time. The minute you expose the pasta to air, it starts to dehydrate. This creates a dry outer skin that you do not want to incorporate into the finished dough; the goal is to create a dough of uniform consistency.",
      "Our dough is purposely very dry. We do not add any raw flour in the rolling process. Extra flour added at this point sticks to the dough and, when cooked, that splotch turns into a gooey mass, a slick barrier to sauce. It dulls the seasoning and flavors of both the dough and the finished dish.",
      "Begin rolling the dough through the pasta machine, starting with the widest setting first. Roll out the dough to the thick setting, slightly over 1/16-inch. When handling the sheet of dough-especially as it gets longer-always keep it taut and flat. Never grab or flop or twist the pasta. The sheet should rest on the inside edges of your index fingers with your fingers erect and pointed out.",
      "The hands don't grab or stretch the dough; instead, they act as paddles, guiding the sheet of dough through the machine. Handling the dough with your fingers pointed straight out alleviates any pressure on the dough, which stretches and warps it. Use the right hand to feed the machine and use the left hand to crank. Once the pasta dough is halfway through, switch hands, pulling out with the left hand. If you have trouble doing it alone as the dough gets longer and thinner, find a friend to help juggle the dough, or roll out a smaller, more wieldy batch. Once you roll out the dough, immediately form it into shape.",
      "If you are cutting the dough with a",
      ", first cut a section of rolled dough that is the same length as your",
      "and place it atop the strings. Using a rolling pin, lightly press (but don't cut) the dough, forming a slight indentation-enough to set it so it won't slide. Then, press with more force to cut the dough through the strings into noodles. Put the noodles on the prepared baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining dough.",
      "If you are cutting the dough by hand, cut a 2-foot section of the rolled-out dough sheet, and cover the rest of the dough with plastic wrap. Using a knife, cut the dough into 12-inch segments. Make two stacks of strips, with four strips per stack and dusting between layers with semolina flour. Allow the dough to dry until it has a leathery texture, 30 to 45 minutes. It should still be pliable. Fold each stack like a letter, forming three even layers. Cut individual square-edged, long noodles by slicing segments off the edge of the folded dough that are the same width as the dough's thickness. Shake off the excess semolina and form into small nests on the prepared baking sheets."

Or use the meat and sauce to make a very simple pasta dish. Whatever you do, be careful not to overcook the chicken. And serve it right after cooking, when its aromatics are most intense.",

This recipe as I read and reread it over the years pushed me to learn more about cooking. Why not brown the chicken pieces? (Giobbi does not.) What about putting it all together and sticking it in the oven? What if I chopped the seasonings and put them in the cavity and under the skin of a roasting chicken and then, well, roasted it? The recipe with its time-proven flavors (back to the Renaissance at least?) has never failed.",
      "\"For me, this is one of those recipes that permutes endlessly as the seasons, the occasion, or the cook's mood changes. Sometimes (often) I do brown the chicken, sometimes use pancetta instead of prosciutto, sometimes add a little chopped tomato, sometimes introduce porcini mushrooms. If the company at dinner have dietary restrictions, oil-cured black olives can stand in for the pork. I have tried it with boneless chicken breasts only-satisfactory-and with guinea hen-excellent.\"",

Not nice to eat once you know what it is! Coat the pan in a little Spanish olive oil, extra virgin tends to give it a little more a metallic taste so I prefer just simple virgin olive oil. Saute the prawns in the garlic and chili for 3 minutes or until all coloration has changed from translucent to pinky red then season with salt and sweet pepper. Deglaze the pan with the brandy. Do a little flambe if you wish. Then add your chocolate pieces, squeeze the juice of 2 oranges into the pan and simmer until the chocolate has melted and the sauce is hot and bubbling. Use the third orange to taste if its a little strong on the chocolate, or use it to garnish the plate."

Cook, stirring occasionally, until the meat has browned and the moisture has evaporated. Mix in the flour and curry powder, turn the heat to low and cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, to make a porky roux.",

      "3. Stir in the chicken broth and cook, partly covered, over low heat for about an hour, stirring occasionally. If needed, add a bit more stock to loosen the sauce.",
      "",
      "4. Prepare the pork: Heat 1 inch of oil in a frying pan and set a candy thermometer in the oil. Place the eggs in a wide shallow bowl and the panko in another. When the oil temperature reaches 320 degrees, season the pork chops all over with salt and pepper. Cover them, one by one, in the egg and then in the panko, and fry in batches in the hot oil until browned, for about 4 minutes per side. Transfer to a paper-towel-lined plate and let drain for 5 minutes. Slice the pork chops against the grain. Serve the curry sauce over cooked Japanese rice. Top with the sliced pork and serve with a small handful of sliced cabbage. If you choose, drizzle the cutlet with a little tonkatsu sauce. Serves 6.
