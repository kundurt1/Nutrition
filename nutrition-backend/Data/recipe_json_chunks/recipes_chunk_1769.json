      "The method of twice-frying potatoes is also attributed to Belgium, where, in the mid-nineteenth century, a man named Coudelier recorded a process he called \"double friture,\" in that the potato strips are first blanched in vegetable oil to cook the insides, then left to cold completely, and fried again at a much higher temperature to crisp the outsides and give them a rich golden brown color.",
      "Belgians are passionate about these frites, that are commonly sold in small shops along city streets and served in paper cones with a sprinkling of salt and a generous dollop of mayonnaise."
