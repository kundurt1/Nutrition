      "Start with the pasta...I would like to start by saying, I do not have a pasta roller. I made mine with a good ol' rolling pin and some elbow grease. But to being, on a flat surface, scoop on your two cups into a flour into a mountain-like shape. Make a well in the flour. Slowly (VERY slowly) add water to the center, slowly bringing the flour together with the water with either a fork or your fingers, until it comes together into a dough ball. It may look craggily and like a mess, but fear not. Everything will come together when you start kneading the dough...there you'll pick up any stray pieces of dough and flour. Kneed until smooth and elastic, around 10 minutes. Now let the dough rest of a half an hour under a moist rag.",
      "Meanwhile, make your sauce by mixing everything together in a bowl, and setting aside. Next, in a slightly larger bowl, mash up your tofu. Add in your lemon juice, onion and garlic powders, and salt. Make sure you taste your ricotta while making it to make sure it is flavoured to your liking - you are really making it to taste...my measurements are only suggestions. Once it is flavoured to your liking, stir in your kale and set aside.",
      "Now back to the pasta. Once it has rested, divide the dough in two, roll each dough ball into a very thin rectangle, and cut into six lasagna-noodle-looking strips. So in all, you'll have 12 noodles. In a pot of salted, boiling water, boil noodles (I do 3 at a time) for ONE MINUTE. They will float to the top when done. Preheat your oven to 400F.",
      "Once you have your pasta boiled, it's time to assemble to lasagna. In an 8x8 sprayed with cooking spray, ladle in enough sauce to coat the bottom. Layer on 3 or 4 noodles. On the noodles, layer in 1/2 of the tofu-kale ricotta, a little bit of sauce, and then 3 or 4 more noodles. Repeat with the rest of the ricotta, a little bit of sauce, and then 3 or 4 more noodles. Pour on the rest of your sauce, spreading it all over the top. Sprinkle with the mozzarella if using, or drizzle on the bechamel if you're doing that. Bake for 30 minutes, let sit for about 5 (or dig in right away!) and enjoy!"

It should be a creamy and think composition. Add 2/3 of the milk and gently blend ( be careful as mixing the liquid into this cream may be a little dirty if you don't pay attention).

      "Apples: Slice the apples as thinly as possible - a mandoline is good for this. Toss gently in the sugar, cinnamon and lemon. Leave to soften for 10 minutes or so. Arrange in a layer on top of the custard. Start by laying overlapping apple slices all the way round the edge. Next create the 'rose' - arrange the slices in a spiral, standing the apple slices a little on their edge, until the centre hole is completely filled in. Save the smallest, thinnest pieces for the very centre as they will have to bend the most. Cover the tart with tin foil and bake in a preheated oven set at 190c for 30 minutes (this step helps soften the apples). Remove the foil and bake for 15-25 minutes longer, until the custard is puffed and the apple edges are lightly browned.",
      "Glaze: When you take the tin foil off the apple tart, start making the glaze. Melt the sugar in a small saucepan over medium-high heat and cook until rich and golden. Add the butter and salt and stir to combine. Add the cream and continue to cook, stirring constantly, until the ingredients have formed a smooth, unified caramel. When the tart looks nearly ready, remove it from the oven and brush with the glaze. Return to the oven and cook for a further few minutes until the glaze is gently bubbling. Cool to room temperature. Can be kept in the fridge for several days - store in the baking tin and wrap well."

      "After about 10 minutes of hard, full body kneading-I like to stand on a mini step-stool to give me full leverage)-the stiff dough will become smooth and elastic. Even with an easy dough-hook kneading process Nigella says it will take a good ten minutes.",
      "Lightly oil a new bowl, form the dough into a ball and place in the bowl, turning the dough once-over to fully coat with a light film of oil. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and leave it to rise for about 1 hour. The dough, after that time, will be almost twice its size, and when you poke it with your finger a dent should remain.",
      "Again, on a very lightly floured surface (the dough is oiled and not too wet, so it won't be too sticky anyway) dump the ball of dough out onto your counter. Punch the dough down, HARD, and knead a couple of times. Divide the dough into 3 pieces, and roll these 3 segments into even logs. Divide each log again, this time into 5-6 pieces. Roll each piece between your palms into a nice ball (this is where I started having some problems coercing the dough into the smooth shapes I wanted).",
      "Roll these balls into a thick rope, curling it around so the ends meet into a ring. Seal the ends by overlapping slightly and pinching them together. I've also ready that with these balls, you can flatten them into a dish and using any pointy-tip objects (hello, chopsticks) create a hole in the center. That's a method I will try next time...",
      "Take out two large baking pans, and brush with a good amount of oil. Set the bagels onto the sheets, cover with tea towels and let sit for about 20 minutes. In the meantime, set one or two large pots of water onto the stove, and turn to a boil. When the water begins to boil, add the sugar. (2 tbsp for each pot)",
      "At this time the bagels should be plump, and have risen to actually look like pre-cooked bagels (because they are, duh). Start poaching them. Drop the bagels into the boiling water, boiling for about 1 minute. Using two cooking tools- in my case a spatula and a plastic egg flipper spatula- turn over itself, making sure the bagels get coated in the nice sweet boiling bath.",
      "As the bagels are finish poaching, place them back onto the well-oiled baking sheets. Dust with sesame seeds or any other top-garnish, spacing them about 1 inch apart. Bake for 10-15 minutes until shiny and golden."

Add the water, olive oil, salt, red pepper flakes, and a generous amount of black pepper and bring to a full rolling boil over high heat. Using tongs, stir and turn the pasta frequently to prevent sticking. Cook until al dente, approximately 9 to 10 minutes. Remove the skillet from the heat. (If there is still a little bit of cooking water pour some, but not all, into a separate bowl.)",

Serve with grated Parmesan and a swirl of good olive oil. (If the pasta does seem to need liquid, add back a few splashes of reserved cooking liquid.)"

Turn the mixer to medium-low speed, open the ingredient valve, and sift the flour mixture into the mixing bowl. Turn the mixer off.",

As the flour gets absorbed, turn the mixer to medium-low and knead the dough until it looks sticky and shaggy, 1 to 2 minutes. Make sure all the water is incorporated into the flour mixture, scraping down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula, if needed. Remove the bowl from the mixer. Transfer the dough to a medium bowl brushed with olive oil. Cover the bowl loosely with plastic wrap, drape a clean dish towel over top and set the bowl aside. Let the dough rest at room temperature (about 70\u00b0F/21\u00b0C) for 18 to 24 hours. The dough is ready when the surface is dotted with bubbles.",

Try to coax it out of the mixing bowl in one piece, using a rubber spatula, if needed. Using your hands, dusted with semolina flour, pull the perimeter of the dough ball towards the center and pinch it together. (The dough will be very sticky; use a light touch.) Without deflating the dough, flip the dough over so the smooth side is up. Lift up the parchment paper, with the dough in the center, and transfer it to a wide, medium-sized mixing bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and drape a clean dish towel over top. Let it rise for 1 to 1 1/2 hours, to give it time to rise a bit more.",
      "One hour before baking the bread, position an oven rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 475\u00b0F/240\u00b0C/gas 9. Set the cast-iron or enameled cast-iron pot with lid in the oven while the oven preheats.",
      "When the dough is ready, carefully remove the heated pot from the oven. Working quickly, uncover the dough, use the point of a sharp knife to make a slash across the top of the dough ball. Carefully, lift the lid off the heated pot, and then pick up the parchment with the dough in the center and place it in the pot. Wearing oven mitts or using a heatproof spatula, push any excess paper towards the sides. Place the lid on top, with any excess paper remaining inside the pot. Bake the bread for 35 to 45 minutes or until an instant-read thermometer registers between 200\u00b0F to 205\u00b0F/93\u00b0C to 96\u00b0C when inserted into the center of the loaf. The bread should be evenly golden and the bottom and sides nicely browned. Turn the bread out onto a wire rack, remove the parchment, flip the bread right side up, and let cool.",
      "While the bread is still hot but cooling, warm the remaining 2 tablespoons (30-ml/1-oz) of olive oil in a small saucepan over medium-low heat. Add a small sprig of rosemary and let the oil infuse for 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside for 5 minutes. Brush the top of the loaf with the olive oil and then sprinkle generously with flake sea salt. Let the loaf cool for at least an hour before slicing."

      "Preheat your oven to 180 degrees. I actually waited till I had creamed the butter and sugar before I did this. (I feel it's a waste of gas to start preheating before anything. But please, if you don't have any issues with this, preheat the oven first). Grease pans. I normally use non-stick pans so I grease lightly but for this I had to buy a local pan because I did not see the non-stick heart-shaped pans. In this case, you grease your pan with butter, margarine or vegetable oil. After that, coat the pan with flour by sprinkling flour on the grease and shaking it to evenly distribute. This will help it not to burn and it will come out easily from the pan after baking.\n\n Shortening refers to butter or oil. Traditional Red Velvet cakes make use of oil but I decided to use butter because I am not too sure how vegetable oil (Turkey Brand) will taste in cake. I have soya oil which is relatively odorless and tasteless but the recipes I saw specifically stated vegetable oil with the only substitute being butter.\n\n Cream the shortening and sugar together until light and fluffy. I used the good old hand-and-spatula method.(Planning to buy an electric mixer soon, there are affordable ones that can serve you for little quantities of batter).\n\n Add eggs one by one. Mix well before adding the next one.\n\n\n Make a paste of cocoa and red food coloring. I did not use as much coloring as the recipe required and it turned out red enough. Add to creamed mixture.Mix salt, 1 teaspoon vanilla and buttermilk together. To make buttermilk, put one tablespoon of vinegar in a measuring cup (1 cup), and then add enough milk to fill the cup. Let it stand for 5-10 mins. One tin of peak milk was exactly enough. Peak milk is evaporated milk and it's not the kind of milk they refer to but na naija we dey, all join! :-D. I used one cup of this my homemade \"buttermilk\" and one cup of yogurt. You can use 2 cups of plain yogurt instead if you don't have buttermilk.",

I used one cup of this my homemade \"buttermilk\" and one cup of yogurt. You can use 2 cups of plain yogurt instead if you don't have buttermilk.\n\n Add the milk mixture alternately with the flour to the creamed mixture. Divide the flour into three parts and the milk into two. Add flour, add milk, add flour, add remaining milk, and then add flour. Always end with flour.\n\nMix soda and vinegar in a cup. It will start foaming quickly. Gently fold it into the cake. Folding means adding ingredients without beating or mixing vigorously. Just run the spatula around the sides of the bowl and gently raise the spatula so it's like trying to scoop the batter or turn it over. (My dear, I no know the English wey I go use again o. For those of us who are learners we might need to see it first to understand)\n\n Put the batter into the pan and bake until a knife or toothpick inserted into it comes out clean. The original recipe said 30 minutes but I don't know the kind of oven these oyibo people use. At 180 degrees, I baked this cake for almost an hour and 3o minutes."

    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "Take a big bowl and mix the sun-dried tomatoes, parsley, chilli, basil, lemon zest and garlic inside. Stir them well and crumble the Feta inside, mixing the products well again. Flavour with very little sea salt and enough black pepper, and stir again. Divide the stuffing into 4 equal portions and proceed to further preparations of the dish.",
      "Lay the chicken breasts on a plastic chopping board, with the skin side down. Use a knife to cut something like a pocket into the fillets. Fill the stuffing into the pocket of each chicken breast, press it a bit and fold the meat to cover it. If you want you can stick through the meat with rosemary springs to make sure the stuffing won't go out, but that is not obligatory if you manage to form good pockets.",
      "Heat up a deep pan and pour 2 glugs of olive oil in it. Put the meat in the pan with the skin side down. Cover the chicken bits with a wet piece of heat-proof paper. You have to crumble the paper under the tap to get it wet, and then to flatten it out to turn it into a lid. The wet paper will keep the moisture in the breasts and they will remain juicy on the inside. Fry until the skin gets a bit brown, then turn the breast over and cover with the wet piece of paper again. When you get a nice brown skin on the bottom side of the meat, turn the chicken bits with the skin side down again, cover with the paper and press with a heavy lid on top, so the skin makes full contact with the pan. The skin will get very crispy and delicious in not more than 2-3 minutes.",
      "When the dish is ready, take the chicken out on a wooden chopping board and cut each breast into nice 1 inch slices, so that the stuffing is visible. Squeeze about two tablespoons lemon juice into the pan where you cooked the chicken while it is still on the stove and stir to mix the flavours. Pour the juices over the chicken breast slices afterwards and you're done. You'll lick your fingers from delight! The chicken meat is soft and tender on the inside and crisp on the outside. It has a mild chilli flavour mixed with the sun-dried tomatoes and herbs. The Feta cheese adds an additional milky flavour which kills the hotness of the chilli, a little bit, together with the freshly ground lemon zest."

      "Pour 1/3 cup batter into each cupcake liner. Bake, rotating once, until tester inserted in center comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes. Let cakes cool in pans on a wire rack for 20 minutes, then remove from pans and cool completely, right-side up on rack.",
      "For the Swiss Meringue Buttercream: Combine egg whites, sugar, and vanilla in the heatproof bowl of an electric mixer. Set bowl over a pan of simmering water. Whisk constantly until sugar has dissolved and whites are hot to the touch, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer bowl to the electric mixer. Using whisk attachment, mix on low speed, gradually increasing to high speed, until stiff, glossy peaks form, about 10 minutes.",
      "In a separate bowl, beat butter until creamy and fluffy. At low speed, add butter to egg whites, mixing until smooth. Add vanilla, and continue mixing until incorporated. Use immediately.",
      "Note: You might need to make another half recipe if you choose to make elaborately decorated cupcakes.",
      "To construct the cupcakes: Divide frosting into 5 small bowls, and tint each batch a different color with food coloring.",
      "Use a serrated knife to evenly cut the domed top off each cooled cupcake. Cut each top in half. Then use a small offset spatula to evenly spread 1 1/2 tablespoons of colored frosting over each flat cupcake top.",
      "Position halved cupcake tops on top of frosted cupcakes, pressing gently to affix the wings to the soft frosting. To make bugs, attach tops with the domed side up and points meeting just inside the edge of the cupcake and extending off the opposite side. To create butterflies, attach pieces, cut-side up, with rounded edges in the center of the cupcake (the domed shape will create angled wings). Refrigerate until frosting is firm and the wings are secure, about 30 minutes.",
      "Prepare gumdrop and licorice heads: Snip licorice strings on a diagonal into 1 1/2 inch lengths. Use a toothpick to make 2 two holes in the top of each gumdrop on opposite sides. Insert the pointed end of one licorice strip into each hole to create antennae. Using extra frosting as adhesive, attach a gumdrop head to each cupcake.",
      "Decorate wings as desired with assorted colored frostings: Place frosting in pastry bags fitted with couplers and round tips, and pipe over surface of wings. Alternatively, gently spread frosting with a small offset spatula over the surface of the wings as desired. If you prefer lots of frosting, spread each wing with a base coat of frosting first and pipe out decorations in a different color; minimalists may pipe simple decorations onto the bare black wings."

    "ingredients": [],

      "Have all the ingredients at room temperature. Position a rack in the lower third of an oven and preheat to 350F. Grease and flour three 9-inch round cake pans and place a round of parchment paper inside each pan.",
      "Over a large sheet of waxed paper, sift together the flour, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.",
      "In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the flat beater, beat the butter on medium speed until smooth and creamy, 1 minute. Add the sugar in a slow, steady stream and beat until the mixture is light and fluffy, 4 to 5 minutes; stop the mixer occasionally and scrape down the sides of the bowl. Add the eggs 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. Continue beating until fluffy, white and increased in volume, 3 to 4 minutes; stop the mixer occasionally to scrape down the sides of the bowl. Beat in the vanilla. Reduce the speed to low and add the flour mixture in four additions, alternating with the milk and beginning and ending with the flour, beating until smooth after each addition; stop the mixer occasionally and scrape down the sides of the bowl.",
      "Pour about 1/3 of the batter (4 1/2 cups) into a medium bowl, add the chocolate and stir until blended.",
      "To form the checkerboard pattern, place the divider ring in one of the prepared pans and spoon the plain batter into the outer and center rings, filling them half to two-thirds full. Spoon about 1 cup of the chocolate batter into the middle ring. Gently lift the ring out of the pan and scrape any remaining plain batter from the ring into the large bowl of plain batter; scrape any chocolate batter into the bowl of chocolate batter. Then place the ring in the second pan and repeat the procedure with the plain and chocolate batters.",
      "For the third cake pan, reverse the procedure: place the ring in the pan and spoon the chocolate batter into the outer and center rings. Spoon about 1 cup of the plain batter into the middle ring. It's important that each layer have approximately the same amount of batter so that they are the same thickness when baked. Gently lift the ring out of the pan and scrape any remaining plain batter from the ring into the other circles of batter, if needed to even out the layers. Do the same with any remaining chocolate batter, if needed.",
      "Set the pans on the same rack in the oven, if possible, and bake until the tops of the cakes spring back when gently pressed without leaving an impression, 25 to 30 minutes. The chocolate cake will done a bit sooner than the plain; that's okay. Do not over bake, or the chocolate cake will be dry. Transfer the pans to wire racks and cool for 10 minutes. Tap gently to see if the cakes are releasing from the sides. Place another rack on top of one cake pan, invert, and carefully remove the pan. Place the other rack on the cake again and invert right-side up. Follow the same procedure for the other two cakes. Cool the cakes completely before assembling and frosting. Serves 10 to 12.",
      "To make the frosting, in a food processor combine the confectioner's sugar, salt, and butter and process to combine. Add the milk and vanilla and process until smooth. Add the chocolate and process until well blended, smooth, and creamy. Use the frosting immediately.",
      "To create the checkerboard effect, stack the cake layers so the outside colors alternate. The frosting between each layer should be thin enough to complete the checkerboard pattern. To assemble the cake, place a cake layer, bottom side up, on a cake circle and spread about 2/3 cup frosting all the way to the edges of the layer. Place a second layer, top side up, on top and spread about 2/3 cup frosting all the way to the edges of the layer. Place the third layer on top, top side up, and spread the remaining frosting on the sides and top. Decorate the cake as desired."
