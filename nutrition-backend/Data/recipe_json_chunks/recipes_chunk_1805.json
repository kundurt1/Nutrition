      "After waiting the 8 - 10 minutes mentioned above, combine the 2 mixes (Wet and Dry), and blend just until the bread quits sticking to the bowl and stop mixing -- The dough should look stringy and not be completely blended together.",

      "Reform and oil the ball with the last remaining tablespoon of olive oil and place back into the bowl and allow the dough to rise again until it has doubled in size a second time.",
      "After it has risen the second time punch down the dough and dump the doughball back onto your lightly floured work surface and sprinkle the doughball lightly with flour and roll out the dough to roughly form a 10\" to 12\" square --",
