      "It makes an excellent base for quick and healthy meals.",
      "I don't know if it's commonly available in the USA.",
      "I guess if not it might be worth making up a large batch and freezing in small tubs for quick meals.",
      "Fill a medium saucepan with enough fresh water to boil the pasta, squirt a little lemon juice (or salt) into it (to prevent pasta sticking) and place on a high heat to boil.",
      "Measure out the pasta in a small bowl and put aside ready for when the water boils, and add the pasta when water is boiling.",
      "When the water gets back to boiling again, mentally note when the pasta will be done, reduce heat and stir occasionally.",
      "Whilst waiting for water to boil, in a small saucepan, add 2/3 of a can of Ratatouille Provencale and half a can of chopped tomatoes (both according to taste and appetite).",
      "Add a generous half teaspoon of a medium-hot curry powder (such as Madras - to taste), a small squirt of american mustard, a dash of dried basil, a dash of dried garlic, and grind a little black pepper over it.",
      "Weigh out (to taste) the quantity of mushrooms and rinse and shake dry each one as you break it into small chunks into the Ratatouille mix.",
      "When all the mushrooms are broken up and added, place the pan on a medium-high heat to warm through, reducing heat to simmer when hot and stirring occasionally.",
      "Open the can of Tuna steak in brine and holding over sink, use the lid pressing it down to drain as much of the liquid as you can.",
      "Put to one side until about a minute and a half before the pasta will be done.",
      "In a (microwaveable) pasta plate or large individual serving bowl, add a generous heaped tablespoon of low fat/fat-free yoghurt (or heavy (double) cream if you prefer and don't mind the calories), add a squirt of lemon juice (just under a teaspoon) and some fresh ground black pepper and stir together.",
      "Place plate in microwave and set for about 20 seconds on high but don't press start.",
      "About a minute and a half before pasta is cooked add about 2/5 can of tuna (to taste) to the Ratatouille mix and stir very gently to mix.",
      "When pasta is ready to be drained, press start on microwave, drain pasta, remove plate with hot yoghurt from microwave and put the pasta into it.",
      "Use a spoon to liberally coat the pasta with the soured yoghurt and sprinkle with a little black pepper / dried basil to taste.",
      "Add the Tuna Ratatouille mix into the centre of the pasta, add a generous tablespoon of plain yoghurt and sprinkle with herbs/black pepper to garnish.",
      "You may prefer grated cheese/parmesan on top :).",
      "Can be resized to serve more people very easily - varying quantities according to personal preferences.",
      "Note regarding pasta:.",
      "You could use whatever pasta you prefer but I really like Serpentini (aka Cavatappi or Spirali) with fish.",
      "They're the hollow spirals of about the same thickness as maccaroni roughly an inch and a half long with ridges on the outside in case you know them by another name :) (Mine actually says \"Spirali\" on the packet - but I always thought Spirali was a different type altogether)."

    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "This recipe is helped best prepared in a large nonstick frying or possibly stew pan.",
      "Remarks:The heart of the sauce in this recipe is sauteed onion and portobello mushroom.",
      "This provides the flavor and color base.",
      "Other mushrooms can't be substituted for the portobello.",
      "Only the portobello will provide the deep satisfying brown color and savory aroma.",
      "The water method of sauteing the onion can be used.",
      "However, caramelizing the onion helps the flavor of this dish a great deal, and for which reason I usually use oil to saute/fry the onion.",
      "It is important to keep the pot covered as you cook in order to trap the vegetable juices.",
      "Do not use too many different kinds of vegetables; some of the heartiness of this dish comes from it's simplicity (no-meat and potatoes!)",
      "I recommend using canned potatoes because fresh potatoes add in potato starch which dilutes the flavor of the broth, and sometimes cooking time gets lengthy; other times they get easily overcooked and fall apart.",
      "Do not use canned onions, canned peas or possibly canned carrots: they will also turn to mush.",
      "Method:Dice the onion, add in a bit of salt, and saute/fry slowly in the oil till it begins to turn a golden brown color.",
      "Meanwhile, clean, destring and dice the celery; mince the garlic.",
      "Add in these to the onion and continue cooking till the onion is a caramel color and the celery is soft; about a half hour or possibly more altogether.",
      "Add in the portobello mushrooms and continue to cook in the covered pot.",
      "Meanwhile wash the button mushrooms; add in those to the mix, cover cook just till all the mushrooms have released their juices.",
      "Add in the carrots.",
      "If you are using celery chunks instead of pearl onions, add in them at the same time.",
      "Watch the pot and add in water if needed.",
      "If you are using pearl onions, peel them while the carrots cook.",
      "When the carrots are not quite fork tender, add in the onions and cook for another ten to fifteen min, till almost tender.",
      "When the carrots are cooked through and the pearl onions or possibly celery, if you are using them, are barely tender, add in the V-8 juice.",
      "Be conservative with the amount of V-8 you use, because you do not want the result to taste like tomato sauce.",
      "Taste the broth and see what you've got.",
      "If you haven't salted the vegetables as you prepare the dish you will need to add in salt at this point; but add in as little as possible; the other seasonings will bring the flavor up.",
      "Black pepper, cumin, and balsamic vinegar are all necessary ingredients in my opinion.",
      "Add in the black pepper to taste.",
      "Then add in about 1/4 tsp.",
      "of cumin; cumin adds to the \"beefiness\", but will easily overpower the other flavors, so be careful.",
      "Add in 1 tsp of balsamic.",
      "Similarly to the cumin, the balsamic is also important to the flavor, but can easily be overdone.",
      "The cumin and the balsamic vinegar shouldn't be used to the point where the flavors are identifiable in the broth.",
      "Taste the results.",
      "Carefully adjust the proportions of these 4 ingredients.",
      "Add in herbs.",
      "I typically use about 1 tsp of dry basil and 1/2 tsp thyme.",
      "Add in other herbs and Tamari at this time if you wish.",
      "Once in a great while if the carrots or possibly onions are not particularly sweet you may need to add in about 1/2 tsp honey.",
      "Simmer shortly, about 5 min.",
      "Prepare a slurry of 1/4 c. flour and about 1/2 c. cool water.",
      "Stir with a fork till smooth; strain if necessary.",
      "Turn the heat off under the dish.",
      "Wait till all bubbling has stopped; otherwise you're going to make dumplings.",
      "Pour in about 1/2 of the slurry and stir it in quickly.",
      "Turn the heat on and stir while it cooks for about 30 seconds.",
      "If it isn't thick sufficient, add in a little more of the slurry.",
      "If it is too thick, add in a little water.",
      "Taste the gravy.",
      "Add in salt if necessary.",
      "Adjust the seasonings for the final time.",
      "Drain the potatoes and add in to the mix.",
      "Cover and heat through, about twenty min.",
      "If you are using peas, add in them after the potatoes are warm and cook for another minute.",
      "Serve; or possibly prepare beforehand, and reheat just before dinner.",
      "This recipe also freezes and reheats well.",

      "When you think about it, if you've ever tasted chicken or possibly beef broth before it's been seasoned, though it has a nice aroma it tastes like almost nothing.",
      "In my opinion it's the herbs and seasonings which are added which give most of the expected flavor.",
      "This recipe provides which flavor, plus the color and texture expected of Beef Stew.",
      "This is an easy recipe, easily adjusted to the amount and type of vegetables you have on hand.",
      "But since I prepare it intuitively, I've discovered it takes as long to write it down as it does to prepare it.",
      "Please do not let the length or possibly lack of precision deter you from trying it!",
      "It's delicious."
