Squeeze a little lemon juice over the top of each fillet. Preheat the barbecue on high for at least ten minutes. Turn the barbecue to medium heat, place the plank with the salmon on the grill, and cover. Keep a spray bottle handy in case the planks catch on fire (they will). Cook until the internal temperature of the salmon is 120 degrees (8 to 10 minutes). The fish will turn pink and smoky brown, and the plank will be completely charred underneath.

Continue to gently whisk the mixture until it is very hot to the touch (130\u00b0F on a candy thermometer).",

Kick the mixer back up to medium-high speed and add the butter one piece at a time, adding the next piece just as the previous one has been incorporated. Stop the mixer every so often to scrape down the escaping buttercream from the sides of the bowl. At some point, the buttercream will take on a curdled appearance; don't worry, this is normal. Just keep on mixing until it comes together. Once all the butter is incorporated and the frosting is fluffy and creamy, blend in the vanilla and salt until fully combined.",

Transfer the dough to the bowl, turning to coat all sides with the cooking spray. Cover the bowl with the plastic wrap with the sprayed side down.

Cover the pan with plastic wrap or aluminum foil, and freeze the dough. After the dough is frozen, about 4 hours, remove it from the pan and wrap it tightly in plastic wrap, then in aluminum foil. When you are ready to bake, unwrap the dough and place it in a sprayed loaf pan. Cover the pan with lightly sprayed plastic wrap with the sprayed side down and let the dough thaw and rise at room temperature in a draft-free place (the thawing and rising will take 4 to 5 hours) or let the dough thaw overnight in the refrigerator and rise as directed.

      "Slice eggplant in 1/2 inch slices across & salt lightly on both sides. Let eggplant rest in a colander over the sink & allow to sweat. Meanwhile, prepare a marinade (in a jar or shaker) with equal parts olive oil and vinegar (2-3 T of each depending on size of eggplant). Salt & pepper to taste. Once marinade is mixed, rinse salt from the eggplant & pat slices dry. Let eggplant rest in a shallow pan or dish. Drizzle marinade over the eggplant slices evenly. Set aside & allow to rest for 20-30 min. Slice the tomato with care, also in 1/2 inch slices across & set aside. Open the goat cheese & try to make 1/4 inch slices with a very sharp knife(wiping knife with a damp cloth or washing it to remove cheese residue). The cheese slices should cover the same surface area as the vegetable slices since the cheese will go between the eggplant and tomato in the salad as the 2nd, 4th & 6th layers. Depending on the goat cheese packag & the tomato/eggplant size, 2-3 slices should be enough for 1 layer. 3 layers of cheese will be used for each salad. After the cheese has been sliced & set aside, prepare a skillet to sautee eggplant. Sautee slices over M-H heat (adding extra oil if needed, but shouldn't be oily). After each slice is cooked through, remove the slices from the pan and let cool. The eggplant can be lukewarm or room temperature, but not hot when preparing salad. To assemble salads:using 2 med. sized plates, add 1/4-1/2 cup baby salad greens topped by 1 slice eggplant on each plate. (hint: Use largest eggplant slices on the bottom of each salad). Add a layer of goat cheese on top of each slice of eggplant, then a tomato slice on top of the cheese. Add another layer of goat cheese for a total of 4 layers. Repeat layers another time omitting the last cheese layer for a total of 7 layers per salad (ending with a tomato slice on top). Serve salad by drizzling with olive oil & vinegar, salt & freshly ground pepper. Garnish with fresh chopped herbs & enjoy!"

Use the back of a hand to form and simultaneously pack an 8-inch well in the center of the flour leaving a small amount on the bottom. Gently pour the milk into the well-packed enter of the well. Scoop 1/3 cup of room-temperature lard into the milk. Using the fingers of one hand, mush together the milk and fat until it looks like thick lumpy pancake batter. Making a massaging motion with the fingers of one hand, slightly akin to playing the scales on a banjo, move the batter around the well in a whirlpool. Continue moving the fingers steadily around the bowl as a rotary mixer would, like a centrifuge. The batter will gently pull in the packed flour. After a few rotations, it will have pulled in sufficient flour to make a very wet dough in the center of the bowl, cradled by the rest of the flour.",
      "Re-flour both hands in the remaining flour and scrape the wet mess of the gooey hand back into the dough. Re-flour both hands and slide under the dough, turning it completely over in the remaining flour with the wet portion of the flour at the bottom of the dough and the top portion completely floured. Re-flouring hands as needed, pinch off an egg-sized portion of the dough sufficient for a 1 1/2-inch biscuit. The portion pulled from the dough will be wet. Dip it into the flour so the total exterior of the dough will be wet. Dip it into the flour so the total exterior of the dough is now floured. Cup one hand, making sure the palm is floured, and move the dough on top of the palm. Use the palm of the second hand to smooth the top of the dough with pinkie and thumb to keep it round. Using a metal spatula if necessary, move the biscuit to an iron skillet or small baking sheet. Repeat with subsequent biscuits, nestling close to each other to keep upright. When pan is full and dough is all used, re-sift flour into the bowl, discarding any pieces of dough left in the sifter, and cover flour with a clean tea towel to use the next day.",
      "Bake the biscuits on the top rack of the oven for a total of 10 to 14 minutes until light golden brown. After 6 minutes, rotate the pan in the oven so that the front of the pan is now turned to the back, and check to see if the bottoms are browning too quickly. If so, slide another baking pan underneath to add insulation and retard browning. Continue baking another 4 to 8 minutes until the biscuits are light golden brown. When the biscuits are done, remove from the oven and lightly brush the tops with softened or melted butter. Turn the biscuits out upside down on a plate to cool slightly. Serve hot, right side up."

Cook, stirring every 15 minutes and regulating the heat to keep the mixture bubbling gently, for about 1 hour, or until the onions have wilted and released a lot of liquid. At this point, you can turn up the heat slightly to reduce the liquid, but it is important to continue to cook the onions slowly to develop maximum flavor and keep them from scorching. Continue to stir the onions every 15 minutes, being sure to scrape the bottom and get in the corners of the pot, for about 4 hours more, or until the onions are caramelized throughout and a rich deep brown. Keep a closer eye on the onions toward the end of the cooking when the liquid has evaporated. Remove from the heat.

In a chilled bowl add the heavy cream, the vanilla, and the sugar, and beat it until it becomes whipped cream. Take the whipped cream and incorporate it into the marscapone mixture. Add the Kahlua to the coffee. Dip lady fingers quickly in and out of the coffee mixture (don't let them become soggy), and then place in rows in an 8 by 10 inch cake pan. Spread a layer of the marscapone/creme mixture over the ladyfingers. Shave half the chocolate bar over the top of the ladyfingers. Repeat the entire process, starting with laying a new layer of ladyfingers on top of the first set. After adding the marscapone/creme to the second layer, shave the second half of the chocolate bar on top to complete. Feel free to continue adding layers until the ingredients run out. Cover and chill overnight. Serve the next day."

      "You will now have about 1 cup/8.5 ounces/240 grams of active starter. (You may feel the impulse to give it a name. Give in to it: I named mine Billo.) Cover it with plastic wrap and let it sit at warm room temperature (75 to 80\u00b0F) for about 4 hours or until it has almost doubled. You can now \"expand\" it (feed with flour and water) for baking bread or refrigerate it overnight and start expanding it the next day. If you don't plan to use it for several days, feed it again to double it, let it sit for 1 hour, and then refrigerate it.",
      "This starter will mature over the next couple of weeks, gaining in strength and flavor. For the first 2 weeks, store at least 1 cup (8.5/240 grams) of it and feed it at least three times a week. After two weeks of regular feeding (equal weights flour and water or, by volume, 1 1/2 times flour to water, to at least double it; when the jar gets half-full, pour off half), at least three times a week, the culture is mature and bread made from it will be more mellow and complex. You can now switch to once-a-week feeding if you only make bread once a week.",
      "Once your starter is mature, all you need to store is enough for 1 or 2 loaves plus enough to start the next batch (about a full 3/4 cup/7 ounces/200 grams). If you plan to bake in larger quantities, simply increase the amount you store by throwing out less of it before each feeding."

    "title": "deviled eggs with cucumber, lemon and herbs",
    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "Kathy's Note: Deviled eggs are such fun picnic food. The trick is making them ahead of time and figuring out a safe, secure way to transport them. You can pack them tightly in a covered shallow plastic container (use paper towels rolled into cigar shapes to create a buffer if there's room in the container and they are going to move around) These deviled eggs have a little makeover. I stuff the bottom of the cooked whites with a few surprises: cucumber, fresh herbs, and lemon. Then I top the fillings with a creamy egg mixture, so that each bite reveals a burst of flavor inside. Place the eggs on top of a bed of arugula, baby watercress or pea greens. Once you get the hang of these devilled egg surprises, you can create your own flavors; see below for some ideas to get you started. [sidebar title=\"Egg Tips: Hard Boiled and Cracking Secrets\"] Place the eggs in a single layer in a large saucepan. Add cold water to cover the eggs by about an inch, and bring the water to a boil over high heat. When the water boils, cover the pan tightly, reduce the heat to low and cook 4 minutes. Remove the pan off the heat. Let the eggs sit for 10 minutes. Drain the water you cooked the eggs in out of the saucepan, keeping the eggs in the pan. Shake the pan back and forth and up and down a few times, so that the egg shells crack just a little. Then fill the pan with cold water; the water will seep into the cracks in the shells and separate the eggs from the shells, making them easier to peel once they've cooled.[/sidebar] Serves 8 to 12. Ingredients: 12 hard-boiled eggs (see below), peeled 1/4 cup mayonnaise 1 teaspoon Dijon-style mustard Salt and freshly ground pepper 1 cup cucumber, peeled and finely chopped 1 tablespoon lemon juice 1 tablespoon finely chopped scallions 1 tablespoon fresh minced chives Instructions: Using a small, sharp knife, cut each egg in half lengthwise. Carefully remove the yolks and place in a small bowl. Mash the yolks with a fork, and add the mayonnaise, mustard, and salt and pepper to taste. Place a tiny bit of the cucumber, lemon juice, scallions and chives into the bottom of the egg whites. Add the remaining cucumber, lemon juice, scallions and chives into the egg yolk mixture and gently stir. Fill each egg half with a spoonful of the yolk mixture. Favorite Variations: Substitute 1 cup of any of the following for the cucumber-lemon-scallion-chive mixture above and proceed with the recipe: Thin slices of pitted green and/or black olives Chopped roasted red pepper Crumbled blue cheese or goat cheese with scallions Cooked crumbled bacon and scallions Chopped smoked salmon (or bluefish) with fresh dill and grated lemon zest"
