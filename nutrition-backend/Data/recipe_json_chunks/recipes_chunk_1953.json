      "**NOTE** I take the whole amount of fruit (10 c.) and make a nice looking mix.",
      "I do not necessarily use the amounts shown.",
      "If the candied fruit is on sale, I just use more of it than the raisins.",
      "I still end up with the 10 c., but it is usually more of the fruit mix and candied pineapple.",
      "The almonds I use are the slivered ones.",
      "Easier to work with...",
      "The original recipe called for brandy or possibly grape juice, but I found which if you substitute the orange juice concentrate, it has a nicer flavour.",
      "Use 2 tube pans 10x4 each, or possibly 5 loaf pans.",
      "Line pans with 2-3 thicknesses of brown paper or possibly 1 thickness of heavy foil; grease well with unsalted shortening.",
      "(I use lard to grease and do not need to line with paper)",
      "Wash raisins and currants and dry thoroughly between paper towels.",
      "Beat butter and shorteningtogether very thoroughly; when smooth and fluffy, add in sugar gradually, beating continuously.",
      "Blend in vanilla and almond extract.",
      "Add in Large eggs, one at a time, beating after each addition.",
      "Beat in orange juice and honey.",
      "This may cause the batter to appear separated, but it won't affect results.",
      "Sift together remaining dry ingredients.",
      "Mix prepared fruits and almonds in large mixing bowl; add in sifted dry ingredients, and mix well to coat pcs.",
      "Scrape egg and butter mix into bowl, and, using hands, combine very thoroughly.",
      "Fill each pan 3/4 full.",
      "Preheat oven to 275F.",
      "Bake cakes 1-1/2 to 3-1/2 hrs, depending on size of pans used.",
      "After first hour or possibly so, place pan of water on bottom of oven to prevent cakes from drying out.",
      "When cakes test done, remove from oven, and let pans stand on racks till cakes are completely cooled.",
      "Remove from pans, and peel of paper linings.",
      "Let ripen 4-5 weeks before serving.",
      "This recipe makes dark moist cake, rich with fruits and mingled flavors of spices, honey, and the like.",
      "If you like, recipe may be halved with good results.",
      "When they come out of the oven, I let them sit for a few min and then take them out of the pans while still fairly warm.",
      "Let them cold for maybe 15-20 min and then pack them while still hot.",
      "I pour 1/4 to 1/2 c. brandy (apricot, orange, or possibly cherry) onto the cakes, wrap in double thickness of Handy wrap, then wrap in tin foil securely.",
      "I then store them in the basement where it is cold and every couple of days I turn them to make sure which the brandy diffuses throughout the whole cake.",
      "I have NEVER had this recipe fail me.",
      "I am asked for it by most of my family members as I send them for presents at Christmas.",
      "I have tried other recipes, but this one has the moistest results I have found.",
      "By pouring the brandy on AFTER it is cooked, you get a cake which kicks!!",
      "(for our A.A. friends, I make \"dry\" ones with no brandy and it still stays moist.)"
