Add the cognac and thyme and cook until almost all of the cognac has dissolved. Add the veal/beef stock, salt, and a few cracks of fresh pepper, lower the heat to medium-low and cook until almost all of the liquid has evaporated. Take off heat and set aside.",
      "For the burgers, form 6 ounce portions of ground veal (use a scale or eyeball it) into a large meatball. Using a ring mold, lid of a peanut butter or mayo jar, or your hands, form the burger patties into a uniform size. Chill the burgers in the refrigerator until right before you cook them.",
      "Meanwhile, to make the cheese crisps, preheat your oven to 400 degrees F. On a KitchenAid(R) Nonstick 13\"x18\" Jelly Roll Pan, measure 1 heaping tablespoon of grated cheese and use your finger to spread that pile out into a circle. Add a touch of cracked pepper on top and repeat 4 more times. Bake for 10-12 minutes until golden brown and keep an eye on these because they burn quickly. Take the pan out of the oven and set aside, the cheese will harden into crackers within 10 minutes. You may want to make extra because they are snack-worthy.",
      "Preheat a KitchenAid(R) Grill and Panini Press over medium heat. Grab the burgers from the refrigerator and season one side with 1/4 teaspoon salt and a couple cracks of pepper. Place seasoned side down in the pan. Use your fingers to make a wide dimple in the middle of the burgers, this will prevent them from plumping up like a football while cooking. Season the top side of your burgers with same amount of salt and pepper and let cook for 7 minutes on the first side. Flip burgers; you should have a beautiful crust. Cook 1 more minute then add a small handful of grated cheese on each burger, toss 2-3 ice cubes in the pan and cover with a lid. The ice will help the cheese melt evenly and add extra moisture to the burger. Cook 4 minutes and move cooked burgers to a plate to rest for 2 minutes.",
      "Meanwhile, in a small bowl, mix the mayonnaise and mustard together and set aside, and toast your buns if you desire. To build your burger schmear some mayo-dijon mixture on the bottom bun, top with a piece of lettuce, the burger, a generous amount of cognac braised onions, the cheese crisp, and the top bun. Enjoy!"

    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "If there is any dish in Italy that comes close to being a part of every family's repertory, it is probably this exquisitely simple pan- roasted veal. There is an infinite number of ways of roasting veal more elaborately, but there is none that produces more savory or succulent, tender meat. The success of this method lies in slow, watchful cooking, carefully regulating the amount of liquid so that there is just enough to keep the veal from drying out but not so much as to saturate it and dilute its flavor.",
      "The best-looking roast comes from the top round, which some butchers will prepare for you. Rolled, boned shoulder of veal also makes an excellent and considerably less expensive roast.",
      "1. If the roast is to be rolled, spread on it the garlic, rosemary, and pepper while it is flat, then roll and tie it securely. If it is a solid piece, pierce it at several points with a sharp, narrow-bladed knife and insert the rosemary and garlic. (You will season it with pepper later.) Tie it securely.",
      "2. Choose a heavy-bottomed saucepan or casserole, preferably oval, just large enough for the meat. Heat the oil and butter over medium-high heat and when the butter foam begins to subside add the meat and brown it well on all sides for about 15 minutes. Sprinkle the meat with salt and, if it was omitted before, pepper.",
      "3. Cook just long enough to turn the roast once and then add the wine. As soon as the wine comes to a boil, lower the heat so that it is barely simmering, set the cover askew, and cook until the meat is tender when pierced by a fork, about 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Turn the roast from time to time, and if the cooking liquid dries up add 1 or 2 tablespoons of warm water.",
      "4. When the roast is done, transfer it to a cutting board. If there is no liquid left in the pan, put in 1/2 cup of water. Evaporate the water rapidly over high heat while loosening the cooking residues stuck to the pan. All together you should have about a spoonful of sauce per serving, so, if there is too much liquid left, concentrate it quickly over high heat. Cut the roast into slices no more than 1/4 inch thick. Arrange them on a warm platter, spoon the sauce over them and serve immediately."

      "The first job is to fry off the meat in a hot frying pan with just a little oil. Once the pan is smoking hot, in goes the beef. Before it browns, the meat will release its water content. Allow that to evaporate. Only then can you get true caramelisation - and therefore, flavour - into the mince. Otherwise, it's just boiled beef. The problem is many people don't cook the mince for long enough.",
      "Transfer the beef to a sieve to strain off the fat.",
      "Fry the onion and garlic in a little oil until they have just a little colour.",
      "Return the beef to the pan, stir in the flour and tomato puree, then add the Worcester sauce.",
      "Add the Knorr Beef Stock Pot diluted in approximately 350ml of water. Add the bay leaf and fresh thyme. Bring it the boil.",
      "Transfer the contents to a casserole pan and simmer it slowly with the lid on at 140\u00b0C, Gas Mark 1, for approximately 1 hour and 15 minutes. Never allow time to dictate the finished result. If it needs another 15 minutes, let it have another 15 minutes. The mince should be not too wet, not too dry, so when the potato is added, it doesn't sink.",
      "Meanwhile, prepare the mashed potato. Instead of using boiled potatoes, I prefer to use cooked potato flesh scooped from baked potatoes. Because they haven't been cooked with water, the finished result won't end up being wet. It takes a little more effort but the results are worth it. Alternatively, you could boil the potatoes, then dry them in a colander on a tray in the oven. I mash my potatoes using a potato ricer to get smoother results, then gradually introduce hot milk, followed by an egg yolk and softened butter or olive oil. There's no need to season the potato as the meat will be seasoned quite enough.",
      "Another job you can do while the mince is cooking is to blanch the diced root vegetables for about 12 minutes. Root vegetables work very well with shepherd's or cottage pie but you could add peas if you prefer; I've used swede and carrot. There's no recipe for this step - just add as little or as many vegetables as you like.",
      "Take the mince out of the oven and add the blanched root vegetables, removing the bay leaf when you find it. Transfer the mix to a pie dish and pat it down. Distribute the creamed potato evenly over the top using a spatula knife and smooth if off. Create a design on the surface using a fork dipped in a little milk.",
      "Now it's ready for baking for about 15 minutes in a hot oven at 180\u00b0C, Gas Mark 4. The top of the pie should be golden brown.",
      "All that's left to do now is brush the top with a little oil to give it some sheen."

      "In a large mixing bowl (or stainless steel mixing bowl), mix together the egg yolks, sugar, the Marsala (or espresso/ coffee), vanilla extract and lemon zest. Whisk together until the yolks are fully blended and the mixture looks smooth.",
      "Transfer the mixture to the top of a double boiler or place your bowl over the pan/ pot with simmering water. Cook the egg mixture over low heat, stirring constantly, for about 8 minutes or until it resembles thick custard. It may bubble a bit as it reaches that consistency.",
      "Let cool to room temperature and transfer the zabaglione to a bowl. Cover and refrigerate at least 4 hours or overnight, until thoroughly chilled.",
      "For the pastry cream: Mix together the sugar, flour, lemon zest and vanilla extract in a medium heavy-bottomed saucepan. To this add the egg yolk and half the milk. Whisk until smooth.",
      "Now place the saucepan over low heat and cook, stirring constantly to prevent the mixture from curdling.",
      "Add the remaining milk a little at a time, still stirring constantly. After about 12 minutes the mixture will be thick, free of lumps and beginning to bubble. (If you have a few lumps, don't worry. You can push the cream through a fine-mesh strainer.)",
      "Transfer the pastry cream to a bowl and cool to room temperature. Cover with plastic film and refrigerate at least 4 hours or overnight, until thoroughly chilled.",
      "For the mascarpone cheese: Bring 1 inch of water to a boil in a wide skillet. Reduce the heat to medium-low so the water is barely simmering. Pour the cream into a medium heat-resistant bowl, then place the bowl into the skillet. Heat the cream, stirring often, to 190 F. If you do not have a thermometer, wait until small bubbles keep trying to push up to the surface.",
      "It will take about 15 minutes of delicate heating. Add the lemon juice and continue heating the mixture, stirring gently, until the cream curdles. Do not expect the same action as you see during ricotta cheese making. All that the whipping cream will do is become thicker, like a well-done creme anglaise. It will cover a back of your wooden spoon thickly. You will see just a few clear whey streaks when you stir. Remove the bowl from the water and let cool for about 20 minutes. Meanwhile, line a sieve with four layers of dampened cheesecloth and set it over a bowl. Transfer the mixture into the lined sieve. Do not squeeze the cheese in the cheesecloth or press on its surface (be patient, it will firm up after refrigeration time)",

      "In a small bowl, beat the egg yolks lightly with a fork and fold them into the meringue, using a wooden spoon. Sift the flour over this mixture and fold gently until just mixed. It is important to fold very gently and not overdo the folding. Otherwise the batter would deflate and lose volume resulting in ladyfingers which are flat and not spongy.",
      "Fit a pastry bag with a plain tip (or just snip the end off; you could also use a Ziploc bag) and fill with the batter. Pipe the batter into 5\" long and 3/4\" wide strips leaving about 1\" space in between the strips.",
      "Sprinkle half the confectioner's sugar over the ladyfingers and wait for 5 minutes. The sugar will pearl or look wet and glisten. Now sprinkle the remaining sugar. This helps to give the ladyfingers their characteristic crispness.",
      "Hold the parchment paper in place with your thumb and lift one side of the baking sheet and gently tap it on the work surface to remove excess sprinkled sugar.",
      "Bake the ladyfingers for 10 minutes, then rotate the sheets and bake for another 5 minutes or so until the puff up, turn lightly golden brown and are still soft.",
      "Allow them to cool slightly on the sheets for about 5 minutes and then remove the ladyfingers from the baking sheet with a metal spatula while still hot, and cool on a rack.",
      "Store them in an airtight container till required. They should keep for 2 to 3 weeks.",
      "For the whipped cream: Combine the cream, sugar and vanilla extract in a mixing bowl. Beat with an electric hand mixer or immersion blender until the mixture holds stiff peaks. Set aside.",
      "To assemble the tiramisu: Have ready a rectangular serving dish (about 8\" by 8\" should do) or one of your choice.",
      "Mix together the warm espresso, rum extract and sugar in a shallow dish, whisking to mix well. Set aside to cool.",
      "In a large bowl, beat the mascarpone cheese with a spoon to break down the lumps and make it smooth. This will make it easier to fold. Add the prepared and chilled zabaglione and pastry cream, blending until just combined. Gently fold in the whipped cream. Set this cream mixture aside.",
      "Now to start assembling the tiramisu.",
      "Workings quickly, dip 12 of the ladyfingers in the sweetened espresso, about 1 second per side. They should be moist but not soggy. Immediately transfer each ladyfinger to the platter, placing them side by side in a single row. You may break a lady finger into two, if necessary, to ensure the base of your dish is completely covered.",
      "Spoon one-third of the cream mixture on top of the ladyfingers, then use a rubber spatula or spreading knife to cover the top evenly, all the way to the edges.",
      "Repeat to create 2 more layers, using 12 ladyfingers and the cream mixture for each layer. Clean any spilled cream mixture; cover carefully with plastic wrap and refrigerate the tiramisu overnight.",
      "To serve, carefully remove the plastic wrap and sprinkle the tiramisu with cocoa powder using a fine-mesh strainer or decorate as you please. Cut into individual portions and serve."

Cut two rounds of parchment paper to fit inside of a nine inch springform pan. Grease the bottom and sides of the springform pan, lay one of the parchment rounds in the bottom of the pan (set the other one aside for the cheesecake portion) and grease the top of the parchment paper. Use a rubber spatula to transfer the brownie mix to the prepared springform pan. Set the springform pan on a baking sheet then bake according to directions, approximately 35-45 minutes.",
      "Once the brownie layer has baked, allow it to cool completely at room temperature on a wire cooling rack. Once the brownie layer has completely cooled, carefully release it from the pan and set it on your final serving dish and cover it with plastic wrap to keep it moist and fresh. Clean the springform pan to prepare it for the cheesecake layer.",
      "In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the cream cheese until it is smooth, soft and creamy. Add the sugar and mix until completely incorporated. Add the eggs, one at a time, just until incorporated. Add the vanilla extract, peppermint extract, cognac and heavy cream. Mix and taste to adjust any of the flavorings to your liking. With a rubber spatula, stir in the peppermint Andes baking bits, just until evenly distributed.",
      "Prepare the springform pan by greasing the bottom and sides. Lay in the last parchment round and grease the top of that. Cut four large pieces of aluminum foil to wrap your pan. Carefully wrap and mold the aluminum to create a barrier for the pan from the water bath that we will bake the cheesecake in. Make sure the foil edges at the top of the pan are folded over, away from the pan so that it doesn't interfere with the baking of the cheesecake, as it will rise above the top of the pan during baking.",
      "Find a baking dish that the springform pan can rest evenly with enough depth that you can fill the baking dish with water, rising halfway up the side of the springform pan. I had to use a large roasting dish for this. Get your water boiling and preheat the oven to 325F.",
      "Use a rubber spatula to transfer the cheesecake mixture to the springform pan, carefully smoothing the top. Once the oven has come to temperature and the hot water is boiling, set the cheesecake in the roasting dish then pour the hot, boiling water in the roasting dish, around the springform pan until the water rises halfway up the sides of the dish. This helps to insulate the pan and cheesecake mixture from the extreme temperatures of baking and allow the cheesecake to bake slowly and evenly. Carefully slide these pans into the oven taking care not to slosh the water around onto the cheesecake.",
      "Bake the cheesecake for 1.5 HOURS at 325F.\nLet the cheesecake cool in the oven with the door cracked for one hour; this prevents the top of the cheesecake from cracking. Once it has cooled sufficiently, do not remove the cheesecake from the pan yet. Set the springform pan, removing the insulating aluminum layers, on a plate. Cover the top of the pan with foil, but don't let the foil touch the cheesecake and chill for at least four hours or overnight.",
      "When your cheesecake has chilled, get the brownie layer uncovered and spread the dark chocolate frosting on top with an angled spatula. Set the brownie layer close to your workstation then remove the foil on top of the cheesecake then run a blunt edge knife around the outer edge of the cheesecake, helping to release it from the pan. Release the spring on the springform pan and carefully ease the base of the pan with the cheesecake out. Run a blunt edge knife around the circumference of the cheesecake between the parchment round and the bottom of the pan to aid in releasing it from the pan completely. Quickly and carefully set the cheesecake later on top of the brownie & frosting layers, removing the parchment round as you go.",

Pour this melted chocolate on top of the cheesecake, using the back of a spoon to spread the melted chocolate to the edges of the cheesecake and letting it drip down the sides, haphazardly.
