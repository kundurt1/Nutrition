Divide it into 4 and, with wet hands, roll each piece into a ball, then press into flat patties roughly 5 inches wide and about 3/4 inch wider than your buns. Place on an oiled plate and chill in the fridge. Next, finely slice the red onion, then dress in a bowl with the vinegar and a pinch of sea salt. Slice the gherkins and halve the buns. Finely chop the lettuce and mix with the rest of the burger sauce ingredients in a bowl, then season to taste.",
      "I like to cook only 2 burgers at a time to achieve perfection, so get two pans on the go-a large non-stick frying pan on a high heat for your burgers and another on a medium heat for the bacon. Pat your burgers with oil and season them with salt and pepper. Put 2 burgers into the first pan, pressing down on them with a slotted spatula, then put half the bacon into the other pan. After 1 minute, flip the burgers and brush each cooked side with a 1/2 teaspoon of mustard and a dash of Tabasco. After another minute, flip onto the mustard side and brush again with another 1/2 teaspoon of mustard and a second dash of Tabasco on the other side. Cook for 1 more minute, by which point you can place some crispy bacon on top of each burger with a slice of cheese. Add a tiny splash of water to the pan and place a heatproof bowl over the burgers to melt the cheese-30 seconds should do it. At the same time, toast 2 split buns in the bacon fat in the other pan until lightly golden. Repeat with the remaining 2 burgers.",
      "To build each burger, add a quarter of the burger sauce to the bun base, then top with a cheesy bacon burger, a quarter of the onions, and gherkins. Rub the bun top with a teaspoon of ketchup, then gently press together. As the burger rests, juices will soak into the bun, so serve right away, which is great, or for an extra-naughty experience, wrap each one in parchment paper, then give it a minute to go gorgeous and sloppy."

    "title": "how to make kadai mushroom recipe",
    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "the kadai mushroom recipe can be made spicy and hot depending on the kind of red chilies you add. dry red chilies are added to make the kadai masala. so if you use hot chilies, the curry will be hot. if you use less hot and pungent chilies, the gravy will not be hot. so depending on the heat in the chilies, you can decrease or increase their amount. here i used byadagi chilies which are less hot and give a deep color. the indian kadai is like the chinese wok but much deeper than the wok. the whole recipe is cooked in the kadai and hence the name kadai mushroom. in india the kadai or kadhai is used for cooking semi dry or dry veggie dishes, making sweets and also for deep frying. it is one multi purpose pan which is found in every indian kitchen. whenever you make any kadai recipe from any veggie or paneer or tofu, then always always freshly pound or powder the spices. they add such an aroma and flavor to the food that is not possible when you use ready made or store brought spice powders. in this kadai mushroom recipe, as mentioned above the kadai masala is also freshly made from roasted spices. the kadai mushroom has been adapted from the popular restaurant style kadai paneer recipe on the blog. to make this dish onion-garlic free, you can easily skip onion and garlic. it will still taste delicious. kadai mushroom goes excellent with some rotis or naan and accompanied by a salad. In my experience, the only way to prevent the stains from leaving there forever is to use a local Total Carpet Cleaing Melbourne."

Use a slotted spoon to transfer from frying pan to pot to cut down on extra grease and salt. Add stock and spices. As with all recipes, you can jack this around to suit you. I have jacked it to this point. Simmer covered until you are starving or 3-6 hours whichever comes first. If you want to thicken it further, add a small handful of massa. I don't because I like it with cornbread on the side.",

Al dente is good for beans and pasta. Add the beans and chili together on plates. Don't combine the beans and chili until you serve. This will feed about 8 moderately hungry people. I like to make a cornbread to go with it too. Get a House Autry Yellow Cornbread mix and it is easy. This is great camp fare. It can be frozen for a few months. Mine never lasts that long."

Add 1 1/2 tsp. salt, 1/2 tsp. pepper, and the nutmeg. Sauce should be thick enough to coat a spoon; if it isn't, cook over medium-low heat, stirring, until thickened, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in garlic, 2 tbsp. parsley, and 1/2 tbsp. thyme. Keep covered. 3. Preheat oven to 375\u00b0. Heat a deep, wide pot over medium-high heat 2 minutes. Swirl in 1 tbsp. oil and add leeks. Cook until tender but not browned, 3 to 4 minutes, stirring occasionally. Scoop leeks into a bowl and set aside. 4. Swirl 2 tbsp. oil into pot. Add mushrooms, season lightly with salt and pepper, and cook over medium heat, covered, until mushrooms are tender and beginning to release juices, about 5 minutes. Uncover and cook until edges start to brown. Stir in leeks and remaining 1/2 tbsp. thyme. Remove from heat. 5. Mix parmesan with asiago. 6. Assemble lasagna: Oil a 9- by 13-in. baking dish. Spread a few spoonfuls of bechamel over bottom. Arrange 3 noodles crosswise in dish, then spoon on about 1/2 cup bechamel, followed by a third of the mushrooms and 1/3 cup cheeses.

An old-fashioned iron kettle was specified by Mr. Ellis, but any heavy aluminum or metal kettle with a tight-fitting lid will do. Let this come to a hard boil, reduce the heat, and simmer about 2 hours with the lid on. Add potatoes, onions, and at intervals of 10 minutes, the butterbeans, carrots, green peppers. Then add corn and simmer for 2 hours or until mixture seems very thick. Watch carefully so that it does not stick. Add more water from time to time if necessary, but use as little as possible. Add okra and tomatoes and the garlic and let simmer another 1 1/2 hours, or until these vegetables too are done and blended with the others. Mr. Ellis insisted that the stew should cook for 7 hours, but 4 to 5 hours should be quite sufficient. As soon as soup is taken from stove, stir the parsley into it. This soup improves by standing and can be kept for a long time in the refrigerator. It is delicious when reheated. Serve with corn pones and follow it with a piece of pie-a most satisfactory repast, Kentucky style."
