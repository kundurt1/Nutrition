      "Choose the Right Rice:",
      "Risotto's characteristic creaminess and chewiness come from the rice itself, and risotto rice is no ordinary rice. It contains two different starches: an amylopectin exterior, which softens faster--especially under the pressure of constant stirring--to create a creamy sensation in the mouth; and an amylose interior, which stays relatively firm during cooking to give you that al dente bite.",
      "Arborio is the starchiest of the three popular risotto types, and it's the most prone to getting gummy as it cooks; inside, the grains tend to be chalky and crumbly. Widely available.",
      "Our favorite, Carnaroli has longer, narrow grains that cook the most evenly and have the best texture-creamy without being gluey, and a good chewy interior. Find at Whole Foods Markets, A.G. Ferrari Foods (agferrari.com), and gourmet grocery stores.",
      "Vialone Nano grains are smaller, oval-shaped, and produce a delicate risotto with a nutty flavor. Find at A.G. Ferrari Foods (see above) and specialty stores.",
      "Surprise: Sushi rice. Medium-grain Nishiki brand is creamy and chewy, and so much like Arborio that half our tasting panel couldn't tell the difference. Plus, it costs less than any Italian risotto rice.",
      "Note: Nutritional analysis is per 1-cup serving."
