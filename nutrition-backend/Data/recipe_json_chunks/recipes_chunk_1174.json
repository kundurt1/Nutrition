I also added about 1/2 teaspoons of thyme, and about 1/2 bag of frozen mixed vegetables. I increased the cooking time to about 45-50 minutes, so that the added vegetables would get cooked.

Then I browned it over fairly high heat in butter and olive oil, removed the chicken and set aside. Added about 1/2 cup chicken broth to the pan and scraped up all those yummy bits, then added the chicken back to the pan and covered & cooked till done. Remove chicken and reduce broth by half (1/4 cup). I cooked the noodles in water and the remaining chicken broth from the can, drained & added the cut chicken to the noodles. Mixed cr. of chicken w/ herbs soup & mush soup w/ sour cream & added the reduction. Mixed that w/ a little more herb seasoning. Added chicken & noodles & combined well. Topped w/ shredded cheddar and cracker crumb mixture. WOW! My son ate 3/4 of the casserole and my grandchildren LOVED it! A definite add to the rotation!"

Set the pan over medium heat (if the pan isn't flameproof, pour the juices into a small skillet) and scrape up any stuck-on juices.

Shape into a ball and place in a lightly greased bowl. Cover with a damp cloth and let rise in a warm place for 1 hour or until doubled. Meanwhile, soak mushrooms in enough warm water to cover for 30 min; drain. Cut off and discard stems; coarsely chop caps. Set aside. place wok or wide frying pan over high heat until hot. Add oil, swirling to coat sides. Add green onions, garlic, and mushrooms; stir-fry for 1 minute Stir in water, hoisin sauce, and sugar; mix well. Add cornstarch solution and cook, stirring until sauce boils down and thickens. Add pork, mix well. Remove from heat and let cool. Punch down dough, then roll on a lightly floured surface into a 12-inch cylinder. Cut cylinder crosswise into 1-inch pieces. Shape each piece into a ball; let rest for 5 minute To shape each dumpling, flatten each one ball with a rolling pin to make a 4-6-inch circle, keeping dough covered to prevent drying. Place one heaping Tbs. of filling in the center of each circle. Gather the edges of the circle over the filling; close top by pleating, pinching and twisting edges together. Place buns, pleated side down, on a baking sheet, allowing enough room for rising. Cover with a damp cloth and let rise in a warm place for about 30 minute or until light and puffy. Brush tops of buns with egg yolk. Let rise for 15 more minute Bake in a 350* oven for 18-20 minute or until golden brown."

      "Put the sugar into a bowl.",
      "On a spoon, put a little dab of the color(s) you want to use. A little goes a long way; gel colors stain much more deeply than liquid.",
      "With a toothpick or the tines of a fork, mix the dab with a few drops of water-- no more than 4-5 drops of so. Be really careful with this step because if there's too little water, it won't diffuse enough. Too much water and the color won't stick. I like using a medicine dropper for this.",
      "Carefully stir the spoon into the bowl of sugar, mixing thoroughly.",
      "Shake the bowl occasionally to properly disperse the coloring.",
      "Let the bowl of sugar sit in a safe area that is cool and dry for at least 10 minutes so the color can dry.",
      "If using the LIQUID METHOD:",
      "How many drops you use determine how deep you'd like the color to be or how many are required to get a certain hue. About 4-5 are medium shade depending on which one you use, ie you only need about 2 or 3 of red to get pink but about 8-10 for red.",
      "Put the drops on a spoon, and mix thoroughly through the bowl of corase sugar.",
      "Shake the bowl a few times to disperse all the dye. If it looks like \"spotting\", add another 2-3 drops of coloring to the spoon and mix again.",
      "When you are satisfied with the color, let the bowl sit in a cool dry area for about 5-10 minutes to let the color seep in and dry.",
      "FUN TIPS:",
      "For rainbow sugar using the liquid dyes, don't put the dye on the spoon. Randomly put a few drops in the bowl and quickly stir it up, careful not to blend the colors together.",
      "Put the sugar into separate bowls to get different colors instead of having to buy a whole container of colored sugar if you only want just a little bit."

      "Fill the eggs. I find the easiest way to do this is with a ziptop bag. Open the bag and fold the top over the outside. Scrape the filling into the bag, pushing the filling well into a bottom corner of the bag. Close the bag, making sure to get out as much air as you can. Cut a small hole in the bottom corner and gently squeeze the filling into each egg white. Top each appetizer with a sprinkle of chopped chives. Refrigerate until ready to serve.",
      "TIPS: Everyone has their own methods of cooking and peeling eggs. I follow the steps on this site: http://whatscookingamerica.net/Eggs/BoiledEggs.htm It has all the info from the Incredible Edible Egg site, but all in one place. * Most people cut the eggs in half lengthwise. For a different presentation, cut them crosswise, then cut a tiny sliver off the bottom of each piece so it will sit without wobbling. (If a piece seems very shallow, you can hollow it out a bit more with a melon baller.) This is great if you don't have a serving platter specifically for deviled eggs. * I use a fork to make the filling because I like texture, and I want the little onion bits to show. If you prefer a perfectly smooth consistency, you can use a food processor. * If you're bringing the eggs somewhere, you can prepare the filling in advance, store it in the ziptop bag, then fill the eggs at the location. * Also, you can hard-cook the eggs ahead of time; hard-cooked eggs will keep in the fridge for several days.",
      "SUBSTITUTIONS: I use nonfat plain yogurt in an effort to use less fat, and Greek style because it's thicker. You could use mayonnaise, sour cream, or a combination. * The chives add a little flavor zing, and indicate that it's an onion-flavored dish. The measurement is approximate; I just put a pinch on each egg. Instead of chives you could use sliced green onion (scallion), and if you want to get fancy you could make green onion flowers."

Set to the side until you are ready to make the cabbage. I like to make mine a day ahead and store in a small ziplock back in the refrigerator.",

Melt the butter ahead of time to cool slightly and use something like a microwave safe measuring cup or bowl, makes it much easier to pour with a handle. In a heavy bottom pan on a low setting, put the 3 egg yolks with the water and fresh lemon juice in pan. Whisk together while heating up. When it starts to get \"custardy\" (sauce sticks to the back of the spoon and you can start to see the bottom of the pan from whisk strokes), take off heat and start adding the melted butter in a slow stream while whisking until completely incorporated into the egg yolks.",

I have a good rule of thumb that works for me that for every stick of butter, it will serve generously two people. Also, keep the heat low! If you see the yolks starting to curdle, you have it too high! It does require alot of whisking.",

      "For the filling: In a medium (3 to 4-quart) saucepan, bring about 1 quart of water to a boil. Add the cubed potatoes and heavily salt the water (about 2 teaspoons), Simmer until the potatoes are fully tender, about 10 minutes. Drain.",
      "In a large (12-inch) heavy well-seasoned or nonstick skillet or griddle set over medium heat, combine the chorizo and onion; stir regularly, breaking up any clumps of sausage, until the onion is soft and the sausage cooked through, about 10 minutes. If the sausage has rendered more than a light coating of fat over the bottom of the skillet, pour out the excess.",
      "Add the potatoes to the skillet and continue to cook over medium heat, stirring regularly, until the potatoes begin to brown, about 8 minutes. As the mixture cooks, mash everything together a little with the back of a spoon or spatula, scraping up any crusty bits of potato, so that it roughly holds together (it'll look a little like hash). Cover and keep warm over the lowest heat.",
      "For the salsa: As the filling finishes cooking, make the salsa: In a food processor, combine the tomatillos, garlic and chiles. Pulse the machine until everything is finely chopped. Peel and pit the avocado, add the flesh to the processor and pulse until everything is well blended (the salsa will be the consistency of a light mayonnaise). Scrape the salsa into a serving bowl, taste and season with salt, usually about 1/2 teaspoon.",
      "Serving: Scrape the warm chorizo filling into a serving bowl and set on the table along with the avocado salsa and a basket of steaming tortillas.",
      "Note: If you are using store-bought tortillas, drizzle a clean kitchen towel with 3 tablespoons water and wrap your cold tortillas in it. Slide the package into a microwaveable plastic bag and fold the top over, but don't seal it. Microwave at 50% power for 4 minutes to create steam in the package. Let stand for 2 or 3 minutes before serving."

This should take about 15 minutes. When the mushrooms are browned and most of their liquid has evaporated, pour in the sherry and stir in the thyme, scraping up the brown bits on the bottom of the pan. Continue to saute the mushrooms until the liquid has reduced and thickened. Taste and add salt and fresh-ground black pepper as desired.",

      "In a large pot, heat the butter over medium heat until it is melted and begins to brown. Add the onions and cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until they are soft and browned (about 20 minutes). Onion soup, unsurprisingly, is all about the onions. Make damn sure the onions are a nice, dark, even brown color.",
      "Increase the heat to medium high and stir in the port wine and the vinegar, scraping all that brown goodness from the bottom of the pot into the liquid. Add the vegetable stock. Add the bouquet garni, and bring to a boil.",
      "Reduce to a simmer, season with salt and pepper, and cook for 45 minutes to an hour, skimming any foam off the top with a ladle. Remove the bouquet garni.",
      "For the croutons and cheese:",
      "When the soup is finished cooking, ladle it into the individual crocks. Float two croutons side by side on top of each. Spread a generous, even heaping amount of cheese over the top of the soup. You want some extra to hang over the edges as the crispy, near-burnt stuff that sticks to the outer sides of the crocks is often the best part, once it comes out from under the heat.",
      "Place each crock under a preheated, rip-roaring broiler until the cheese melts, bubbles, browns, and even scorches slightly in isolated spots. The finished cheese should be a panorama of molten brown hues ranging from golden brown to dark brown to a few black spots where the cheese blistered and burned. Serve immediately-and carefully. You don't know pain until you've spilled one of these things.",
      "If your broiler is too small or too weak to pull this off, you can try it in a preheated 425\u00b0F/220\u00b0C oven until the cheese is melted. A nice optional move: Once the mound of grated cheese starts to flatten out in the oven, remove each crock and, with a propane torch, blast the cheese until you get the colors you want."
