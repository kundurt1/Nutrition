Use your finger to give little gaps between pieces in order to ensure uniform cooking and beautiful color.

      "Turn the mixer off and, without removing the dough hook or bowl from the mixer, cover the bowl loosely with plastic wrap. Let the dough rest for 20 minutes. (This allows protein in the dough to relax, making for a stronger dough that can rise higher, with a better crust.).",
      "Remove the plastic wrap over the dough, and add the biga and salt to bowl. Continue to knead on the lowest speed until ingredients are incorporated (dough should clear the sides of the bowl but should stick to the very bottom), about 4 minutes.",

If you want two smaller loaves, split the dough into two equal halves. Use a knife or bench scraper.",

      "Using a single-edged razor blade, or sharp chef's knife, cut a slit 1/2 inch deep lengthwise along top of loaf, starting and stopping about 1 1/2 inches from the ends. Lightly spray the loaf with water. Slide parchment sheet with loaf onto baker's stone or cast iron griddle in the oven.

Pour the wet mixture into the well in the dry mixture and begin mixing the two together with dough hook, gradually incorporating the dry into the wet. After about 3 minutes, when the wet and dry are well combined, turn off the mixer and let it rest, uncovered, for 15 minutes. This allows time for the flour to absorb the moisture.",
      "Turn the mixer back on and knead the mixture for about 3 minutes. The dough will be moist and sticky, but after a few minutes of kneading it should come together into a smooth mass; add a teaspoon of flour at a time if it seems too wet. Divide the dough into 2 pieces, shape them gently into balls, and wrap them in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for at least 24 and up to 48 hours before using. This process, called proofing, allows for the fermentation that gives the dough structure-which means a chewy, pliable crust-and flavor. One ball with make one thin-crust 12\" pizza, enough to serve 2 people generously. The other one can be frozen and used another time; thaw in refrigerator for several hours.",

When dough is a puffy, after about 30 minutes, gently press with fingertips and stretch it into a 12\" circle - it will most likely be uneven in shape. Don't roll with a rolling pin, as that flattens all the bubbles and lightness in the dough. Lift the round, stretch the top edge gently, and let the weight pull it larger. Sprinkle a peel or rimless baking sheet with some semolina or cornmeal and AP flour. Place stretched dough onto peel, allow to rest 5 - 10 minutes. Spread crust with 3-4 oz. pizza sauce, any meat or veggie toppings, and 4 oz. grated mozzarella. Slide from peel onto heated stone , bake for 8-10 minutes until cheese begins to brown and crust is nicely browned. If you are using cooked meat topping, you can bake it without cheese for about 5 minutes to heat through and firm up the crust, then add cheese and bake for another 5 minutes."

      "After about four minutes, add the garlic and stir to blend.",
      "After two minutes add the cauliflower, potatoes and carrots.",
      "Add water and black pepper. Add salt to taste or 3-4 bouillon cubes (chicken or vegetable). I usually add the bouillon cubes.",
      "Bring the liquid to a boil over high heat, reduce heat, cover and simmer for up to an hour.",
      "Let the soup cool for about 20 minutes, then puree.",
      "Thin the soup as needed with broth, milk or cream. Adjust seasonings.",
      "Variations: 1. When making the cauliflower soup, I usually add about 1 cup grated cheese after pureeing the soup. 2. To make zucchini soup, replace the cauliflower with zucchini and add 1/4-1/2 teaspoon dried thyme. 3. To make asparagus soup, replace the cauliflower with 2 bunches of fresh chopped asparagus and 1/4-1/2 teaspoon dried thyme. 4. To make spinach soup, replace the cauliflower with 1 pound spinach, and reduce the water. The spinach flavor was a little strong for me, so I added extra cream. 5. To make bean soup, replace the cauliflower with two 15 oz. cans of cannellini beans and add 1 teaspoon dried Italian seasoning blend. Cannellini beans are sometimes called white kidney beans and are often used in Italian cooking. Great northern beans or navy beans would also probably work well. 6. You can replace the cauliflower with broccoli, but I haven't enjoyed the soup when making it this way, as the soup tasted a little bit bitter. I have successfully made the soup using half broccoli and half cauliflower as the dominant vegetable 7. To make chickpea soup, replace the cauliflower with two 15 oz. cans of chickpeas (also known as garbanzo beans) and add 1 teaspoon of dried Italian seasoning blend. When making this soup with beans or chickpeas, I sometimes also add 2 celery ribs if I happen to have them on hand. I usually peel the back of the celery rib to remove the tough stringy part, but that probably isn't necessary. 8. To make the soup with cabbage, use 1-2 onions, 1-2 leeks (optional), 2 celery ribs, 1/3 lb. carrots, 2 minced garlic cloves, 5 potatoes, 1/3 of a cabbage and 1/2 teaspoon black pepper. 9 Finally, one of my favorites is to make the soup with the cabbage (#8), but I usually reduce the potatoes to 2-3. Do not puree the soup this time. Add 1/4-1/2 cup tomato sauce to the broth and 1 diced tomato (optional). Add one packed cup spinach or kale and one 15 oz. can chickpeas or white beans the last 2-3 minutes. After ladling soup into a bowl, add 2 teaspoons of pesto on top of each bowl for garnish, which adds an excellent fresh flavor to the soup."

      "Spatchcock the chickens: Place the chicken on its breast. Using poultry shears, start at the neck and cut lengthwise down one side of the backbone to the tail. Next, repeat that cut along the otherside of the backbone. Remove the backbone and save it for stock.",

      "Turn the skin side up and trim the wingtips and any loose skin. The chicken is now spatchcocked. Place the chickens in a nonreactive roasting pan.",

With the machine runing, add the oil, lemon juice, salt, pepper and 3/4 cup water. Taste for seasoning, adding salt and pepper as necessary; the pesto shuld be highly seasoned. Set 1/2 cup pesto aside. pour the remaining pesto over the chickens, spreading it on the meat with a rubber spatula. Turn the birds so you coat both sides. Let the chickens marinate in the refrigerator, covered, for as little as 2 hours or as long as overnight, turning once or twice to coat with marinade; the longer the chickens marinate, the richer the flavor will be.",
      "Set up the grill for direct grilling and preheat to medium. When ready to cook, brush and oil the grate. Arrange the chickens on the grate, skin=side down. Grill for 12 to 15 minutes per side, turning once with tongs and a spatula. the chickens can be a little awkward to turn; you'll need to use both utensils. When you turn the chickens, spread the reserved 1/2 cup pesto on top. You'll probably get flare-ups as the melting fat hits the fire. Keep the birds moving to dodge the flames. If the skin browns to much, lower the heat or move the chickens to a cooler section of the grill. The chickens are done when an instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of a thigh (but not touching the bone) registers about 180 degrees F.",
      "Transfer the chickens to a plater, let rest for a few minutes, garnish with the dill sprigs and lemon wedges, and serve.",

      "Meanwhile, melt the butter in a saucepan. Let it cool down to room temperature.",
      "Set aside about 1/4 cup of the egg whites for glazing the bread. Beat the rest until fluffy but still slightly wet (NO STIFF PEAKS). Divide these beaten egg whites in half. Put one half in the refrigerator.",
      "Beat the egg yolks, and add to the room temperature butter. Mix well, and then add the vanilla, lemon rind, and the rest of the sugar. Mix until it is creamy and well-blended. Fold in the half of the beaten egg whites that is not in the refrigerator.",
      "Your yeast, milk, and flour mixture (i guess its a sponge) should be growing and bubbly. Mix the butter/egg yolk/sugar mixture into the sponge.",
      "Now its time to get the dough finalized. Put the remaining flour into a very large mixing bowl and make a well in the middle of it. Pour in the liquid/sponge mixture and begin slowly mixing together. Work slowly and gently, incorporating the flour from around the edges with a wooden spoon. You will get a rather sticky dough eventually and you are now ready to knead!",
      "Flour your table well and put on some good music. This will take a while.",
      "Put the dough on the floured table and begin kneading. Sprinkle on more flour to keep the dough from sticking, but do so gingerly -- you don't want the dough to be too dry. Knead for 20-30 minutes. No, really! It might be painful, but this long kneading process is really what will make for a light, tender bread. You will know the dough is ready when it begins to be smooth, elastic, and shiny.",
      "Clean out your large bowl, butter it, and put the dough inches Cover with a towel and let it rise for about an hour. I like to let it rise in an unheated oven.",
      "While the dough is rising you can make your filling. This part is easy -- get the other half of the egg whites from the refrigerator and beat them up again if they look deflated. Add the walnuts, sugar, cocoa, and lemon rind. Mix it until it forms a cohesive paste.",
      "You should also butter 5 loaf pans during the rising time.",
      "Once the dough has doubled in bulk bring it back to your floured table. Divide the dough into five equal sized pieces and begin working.",
      "You can make a very simple cozonac by just shaping the dough into loaves and baking them -- but the fillings are more fun and charming.",
      "Divide each of the five pieces into two equal sized pieces. Stretch each piece into a loose rectangle, about 7 by 3 inches or so. Spread the two rectangles with your nut or poppy seed filling, leaving about a 1/2 inch margin around the edges. If you are using Turkish Delight just sprinkle the cubes on top of the dough. Roll the two rectangles up like jelly rolls, avoiding any filling squeezing out.",
      "Now take the two filled pieces of dough and twist them together to make a loaf shape. Place your loaves in the baking pans and let them rise again until double in bulk.",
      "If you want to make a fancy two-colored cozonac, when you have your two dough pieces for your loaf, take one of them and sprinkle it with cocoa. Begin kneading it until it is uniformly chocolate colored -- this takes about 5 minutes.",
      "Roll out your white dough into the 7x3 rectangle. Roll the chocolate dough into a slight smaller rectangle. Sprinkle the white dough rectangle with raisins and Turkish Delight. Place the chocolate dough over it, and press down so that the two pieces of dough stick together. Roll the dough up like a jelly roll. This will make a lovely two-colored spiral loaf. Place your loaf in its greased pan and cover and let it rise like the others.",
      "Preheat the oven to 375.",
      "Once the loaves have doubled in bulk, glaze them with the reserved unbeaten egg whites. Sprinkle each loaf with granulated sugar. You can sprinkle each loaf with a something to remind you of the filling; chopped walnuts on the nut filled one, poppy seeds with the poppy seed, granulated sugar on the Turkish Delight, etc.",
      "Bake the loaves for 15 minutes at 375, then lower the heat to 350 and bake for another 30-35 minutes. Breads will be done when a knife inserted comes out clean. The loaves should be a rich golden brown color.",
      "Remove the cozonaci from their pans as soon as they are done, and let them cool on a rack or a towel overnight. These are best the next day, and will last for a week or so.",
