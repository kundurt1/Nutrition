While waiting for this to cook, start on the sauce.\nIn a small sauce pan over medium heat, stir all of the ingredients but the cornstarch and water. One the sugar is dissolved, allow the sauce to come to a boil. While you're waiting for it to boil, make the slurry of the cornstarch and water mixture, stirring well to combine. Once it's boiling, add the cornstarch and water mixture. Stir and allow to simmer for one minute. Take off the heat to allow to thicken.\nOnce the chicken and veggies are cooked, pour the sauce on top. Mind you--this makes a lot of sauce, so only add as much as you want. Toss in the pineapple and serve over brown rice.",

Snow peas, bell peppers, or zucchini would also be great. \n\nThis is so filling that it can be vegan if you want to omit the chicken altogether.\n\nLeftover teriyaki sauce can be refrigerated up to two weeks in an air-tight container."

      "If you have time - remove your chicken from the fridge 20-45 minute before you will cook it to allow it to warm up a little. You can skip this step if you do not have the time. \n\nAfter 20-45 minutes. Heat up your oven on grill at 225 C degrees Celsius \nAnd place in the roasting pan now in the oven. \n\nPrepare a small bowl and add your butter. Place it in your microwave for 30 seconds on high heat to melt. Add all remaining ingredients apart from the water and stir it all well together.",
      "Place your chicken on a cutting board and with a sharp knife cut out the whole spine of the chicken (this will help your chicken to cook faster and more evenly). \nYou can use the spine to create a chicken broth for a soup or sauce. \n\nMassage in your marinade in your chicken. Rub it everywhere even under the skin in you can. \nTake your hot roasting pan from the oven and place the chicken with the breast up. You will not be turning your chicken so you do not have to worry about breaking the skin while turning it. Cover with cooking aluminium foil add a half of a cup of water to the pan and place in the middle of the oven. Leave it there for 35 minutes.",
      "Now it is time to remove the foil and ad 1 cup of water to the pan and bake your chicken for an additional 35 minutes (you will need extra time if your chicken is larger). \nCheck that the internal temperature has 75 degrees Celsius or that you can easily remove it from the bone. \n\nLet your chicken rest for about 10-15 minutes outside of the oven for the juices to combine inside of the chicken. It is better if the legs of the chicken are higher up so more of the fatty juices also go to the breast.",
      "Your chicken is ready.\n\nEnjoy. \n\n\nTIPS: if your skin is not crispy as you wishes just put it in on higher heat the last 5 minutes (you can also add some extra oil to the skin to help the chicken crisp up) - you should not need these tips with this recipe."

      "Continue to scrape the pan until most--if not all--of the browned bits have dissolved into the glaze. Then dissolve a teaspon of the roux into the glaze. After a little stirring and bubbling, the roux should have tighten the glaze into a creamy-looking sauce that's not runny.",

After \"a deck\" of protein, \"a deck\" of veg, and \"a deck\" of starch, I'm usually satisfied. For this recipe of four \"generous main course\" parcels, the filling is equivalent to two decks of cards. That's just filling; the phyllo shell and the tomato sauce are extra.",
      "Preheat oven to 375\u00b0F.",
      "Build the parcels. Unwrap and unroll your phyllo sheets, and cover the stack with a damp cloth towel. Have your cutting board clear, the fat for the phyllo ready, as well as a pastry brush for painting the fat onto each layer of phyllo. Bear in mind that you should have enough fat to paint each layer, and also to paint any dry phyllo surface after the parcels are built.",
      "Uncover the stack, peel off a sheet of phyllo and place it on your cutting board. Cover the stack to preserve the moisture. Use the pastry brush to evenly paint the entire surface of the phyllo sheet with fat. Sprinkle half the remaining parsley, mint, and chives evenly over the lubed sheet.",
      "If the phyllo tears during the process of movement or brushing, simply push and arrange the tear closed. You can't bind the sheet back together, but it won't matter in the long run.",

      "Uncover the stack of unused phyllo, roll it back up, wrap it back up, and store it in the fridge. Use what's left soon or it will dry out in the fridge. Or, throw it back in the freezer, and maybe it will defrost into separate sheets again next time.",
      "Back to the lubed and herbed stack of phyllo. Use a knife and slice the stack down the center like a book so you two even halves. Then slice across both halves so you now have four rectangles."

      "Note: I like a mild blue cheese for this like a gorgonzola dolce which is a younger gorgonzola that is milder and creamier than a fully aged gorgonzola but any blue cheese will work so use your favourite.\nNote: Add the blue cheese a bit at a time, you want it's flavour to be present in the soup but not to overpower the pears delicate flavour.\nOption: Garnish with crispy fried pancetta or bacon. (This is a must in my books as the salty pancetta perfectly complements the creamy, sweet and savoury soup!)"

In the same water, boil the asparagus tips for 2 minutes. Meanwhile brown a crushed clove of garlic in 3 tablespoons of olive oil. Now, drain the asparagus tips and in the same water boil the jumbo shells pasta. Use a mixer to blend the asparagus stalks with 3 tablespoons of olive oil, Parmigiano Reggiano cheese, parsley and boiled garlic.",

Sprinkle cut sides evenly with one-half teaspoon salt. In small bowl, combine goat cheese, rosemary, thyme, parsley and lemon zest. Stir in one teaspoon lemon juice. Divide goat cheese mixture into four parts; spread each over a piece of chicken. Place three asparagus spears on long side of each breast half. Roll up each breast half to enclose asparagus, allowing tips to extend outward. Secure with toothpicks. Sprinkle the outside of the roulades evenly with one-half teaspoon salt and one-fourth teaspoon pepper. In large, non-stick skillet, warm canola oil over medium heat. Add chicken and cook, turning every 4 - 5 minutes, for about 15 to 20 minutes total. Remove chicken from pan, cover with foil and set aside. In large bowl, combine spinach and arugula. In medium skillet over medium heat, warm olive oil. Add garlic and saute, stirring, 1 minute. Add remaining lemon juice and honey, remaining salt and pepper; saute 1 additional minute. Pour warm vinaigrette over greens; toss gently to wilt. To serve, place wilted greens on serving platter. Remove toothpicks from chicken and discard. Slice chicken roulades crosswise into 1-inch thick rounds. Arrange roulades on greens and sprinkle with pine nuts."
