      "> Put 1 1/2 cups all purpose flour, salt and sugar(optional)in a mixing bowl.",
      "> Mix the 2 TBSP Cold Milk with the 1/2 cup Sunflower oil, until the milk has dirtied the oil and there are thousands of milk beads floating in the oil.",
      "> Add Milky Oil to the bowl and using your hands, mix together until all the flour is dampened by the milky oil mixture.",
      "Form it into a ball, and place in the center of your 9\" pie pan.",
      "Spread the dough over the pie plate, patting down the dough to cover the bowl.",
      "DO NOT let the crust go over (or even too close to) the edge of the pan.",
      "> Although if we were not making pumpkin pie, and were just using this as a shell, the next step would be using a fork to poke holes liberally to avoid having the dough bubble under the filling as it bakes.",
      "But with pumpkin pie, that only makes the crust weak, so don't do that.",
      "> Pat the fork on the crust portion lightly.",
      "It will give texture to the crust, but don't make the grooves too definite or they may burn unless covered with foil.",
      "Also, don't let any portion of the crust be too thin or it will burn.",
      "The crust should be even all the way around, and lightly patted with a fork.",
      ">Place this in the fridge to chill the pie crust, as long as you want.",
      "STEP 2--- MAKING PUMPKIN PUREE: As it is rare to find Pumpkin Puree on the shelves in China, we must begin the pumpkin filling by making our own home-made Pumpkin Puree.",

      "(it's best to use a sheet with a lip around the side because this will be juicy and that avoids the juice spilling over later.",
      "> Sprinkle the 1/3 cup loose sugar over the oil.",
      "> Place both halves of pumpkin face down in the oil on the cooking sheet.",
      "Avoid doing this if possible but, if both do not fit, cut the halves it into the fewest pieces necessary to fit it all in the pan.",

      "The chunks can be a few inches big, not too small, not too big.",

      "Add brown sugar to taste after all the spices as the sugar will thicken the filling, making it difficult to blend properly.",

      "If you don't like pies too sweet, add brown sugar to taste.",
      "The brown sugar also adds color that looks good once baked.",
      "I once used white sugar, and the appearance wasn't as traditional.",
      "The taste that you have in your blender at this point (after the sugar) is the taste you will have in your pie, so keep playing with it until you find a good combination.",
      "Finally, once you are satisfied with the taste, add the eggs to the blender.",
      "LAST STEP--- ADDING FILLING TO CRUST AND BAKING PIE.",
      "> Take crust from fridge and pour the filling into the crust in a circular motion until the pan is filled.",
      "Do not over fill.",
      "Just a bit below the crust edge is perfect, even if it means wasting some of the filling.",
      "Though the filling shouldn't be very runny, it is still a very thick liquid, so avoid letting the filling slosh onto the crust as you place the unbaked pie into the oven.",
      "Put the rack on the lowest level to avoid burning the pie and heat the pie from the top and bottom burners.",
      "Leave it to cook for about 40 minutes, checking on it to make sure it is not burning.",
      "If crust begins to get too dark, foil the crust next time.",
      "As it heats, toward the end, the filling will puff up.",
      "Fear not.",
      "It will settle down again as it cools and transform into the worlds best pumpkin pie after refrigeration for a few hours."
