      "Drain the beans, dump them into a medium saucepan, and cover with water. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and simmer, partially covered, until the beans are tender but still hold their shape, about 45 minutes. Drain and set aside.",
      "Meanwhile, heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium heat until it shimmers. Toss in the chourico and cook until browned, 7 to 10 minutes. Fish out the slices with a slotted spoon and transfer to paper towels. Pour off all but 3 tablespoons of the fat from the pot, or if the pot is dry, drizzle in more oil so you have 3 tablespoons. Add the onions and bay leaf and cook, stirring often, until the onions are deeply golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes. Adjust the heat as necessary to prevent the onions from burning.",
      "Add the garlic and red pepper flakes and cook for 1 minute. Pour in the beef stock and 5 cups of water, add the potatoes, and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to low and simmer, covered, until the potatoes are just tender, 10 to 12 minutes.",
      "While the soup is simmering, spoon a third of the beans and a bit of the soup broth into a food processor. Pulse to make a loose paste, then, if desired, pass the paste through a sieve. Straining the paste gives the dish extra body without errant bean skins floating in your soup. It's entirely optional but, I think, preferable.",
      "When the potatoes are cooked, stir in the collards, chourico, bean paste, and beans. Turn off the heat and let the soup sit for 10 minutes to marry the flavors.",
      "Remove the bay leaf, season the soup with salt and pepper to taste, and ladle into warm bowls."

Put the nuts in a food processor fitted with the metal blade attachment and pulse on and off several times to begin the grinding process. Add the confectioners' sugar and process until they are as finely ground as possible. Scrape into a fine-mesh strainer set over a bowl and shake and press as much of the fine powder as possible through the strainer. Return what is left in the strainer to the food processor and grind again. Repeat the straining and processing one or two more times. You should be able to grind almost all of it into a fine powder; there might be a scant tablespoon of coarse nut-sugar mixture left in the strainer, which you should discard. Set the fine powder aside. Do not bother to wash the food processor; it will be used for the filling, and any leftover nut particles are fine.",
      "In a clean, grease-free bowl of a stand mixer, whip the egg whites on low speed using the wire whip attachment until frothy. Increase the speed to medium-high and add the salt. When soft peaks form, add the sugar gradually. Continue whipping until stiff peaks form. Remove 2 tablespoons of the pistachio powder and set aside. Fold in the remaining pistachio powder into the meringue in two batches until evenly combined, Dollop about 2 tablespoons of batter onto a prepared pan. It should not completely hold its shape, nor should it puddle out into a flat disk, but rather should be somewhere in between. It should relax and soften slightly, losing any pointed \"kiss\"-like peak on top. Add the reserved pistachio powder if necessary to achieve proper texture.",
      "Scape the batter into a pastry bag fitted with the tip and pipe mounds, about 1 1/4 inches across, at least 2 inches apart on the pans. Rap the pans firmly (and flatly) on the counter to release any air bubbles. Allow to sit at room temperature for 1 hour.",

Cool completely on the pans set on racks.",

Use a small offset spatula to spread a small amount of filling on one cookies bottom, then sandwich together with another cookie (matching the cookies by size, if there is some variation). Macarons may be served immediately, but I like to let them sit overnight at room temperature in an airtight container. Their flavor and texture seem to improve. Store at room temperature for up to 4 days in an airtight container. You may also experiment with freezing them. Many baker do, but I think they suffer a little."

(As necessary to prevent over-browning, cover the top with foil.) Then bake for 5 to 10 minutes longer to ensure the center is baked through. Cool in the pan on a wire rack for 10 to 15 minutes. Remove the loaf to the rack; cool thoroughly.",
      "This tastes good warm, but will cut much better when cool. Cool completely before storing. The bread will keep at cool room temperature for 3 to 4 days, and may be frozen, airtight, for up to 2 months."

      "Using a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook (or a hand mixer), mix together the milk and yeast on low speed for 5 to 10 seconds to dissolve the yeast. Add the all-purpose flour, bread flour, salt, sugar, and the 2 tablespoons soft butter and continue to mix on low speed for 3 to 4 minutes, or until the butter is fully incorporated and the dough is smooth. Remove the dough from the mixer bowl, place it on a tray, and cover it loosely with plastic wrap. This dough block is called the detrempe. Place the tray in the refrigerator for at least 6 hours or for up to 12 hours. The dough will firm up and the yeast will take some action and proof a bit.",
      "At least 6 hours later, put the",
      "on a well-floured work surface, and then press down firmly to create about an 8-inch square. Rotate the square so that, as you face it, it looks like a baseball diamond. Use the sides of your palm to mark a 7-inch square in the middle of the diamond, creating triangular flaps at the 4 corners.",
      "As best you can, roll out each of the triangular flaps into a squarish shape (about 3-inch squares). You will have to tug a bit at the edges to pull the flap into a square as you roll. When you are done, the entire piece of dough will be about 12 inches wide and tall, with a 6-inch-square lump in the middle and one squarish flap off of each side of that lump. The 6-inch-square lump will be about 1 inch thick, and the 4 squarish flaps will be about 1/4 inch thick.",
      "Place the 1 cup cold butter in the stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, and beat on medium speed for 15 to 20 seconds to break up the butter, yet still keep it quite cold. (Alternatively, pound the cold butter with a rolling pin to soften it and shape it into a 6-inch square.) Scrape the butter out of the bowl directly onto the 6-inch-square lump in the center of the dough, and pat it with your fingers into a square that covers the 6-inch-square lump. The butter should be about the same consistency as the dough.",
      "Fold one of the flaps up and stretch it over the butter square to cover it entirely. (The dough is quite stretchy, so you can stretch it to cover the butter completely.) Fold and stretch a second flap over the first flap, then repeat with the third and then the fourth flap. Tug at the flaps to keep them in a square that covers the butter. You will now have a butter square that is entirely encased in dough above and below. Using the palms of both hands, firmly press down on this dough package to create about an 8-inch square.",
      "When the dough package is relatively flat, switch to a rolling pin and continue to flatten the dough by pressing up and down on the package with the pin. Roll out the dough into a rectangle about 16 by 10 inches. As you work, flour the dough and the work surface as needed to prevent the rolling pin from sticking to the dough.",
      "Position the rectangle so a long side is facing you. Using a bench scraper or a knife, score the rectangle in half vertically, to create two 10-by-8-inch rectangles. Brush any loose flour off the dough. Lift the right side of the dough and fold it in, so the right edge meets the scored line in the center. Then lift the left side of the dough and fold it in, so the left edge also meets the scored line in the center and meets the right edge, as well. Square off the folds as much as possible so the edges meet neatly, then fold the right half of the dough on top of the left half. This is called a book fold. Your dough will now be 4 inches wide, 10 inches from top to bottom, and about 2 inches thick. Rotate the dough pile clockwise 90 degrees; it will now be 10 inches wide and 4 inches from top to bottom. The process of folding and rotating is called \"turning the dough.\"",
      "Now, roll out the dough into a rectangle about 18 inches wide and 8 inches from top to bottom. The dough might be a little sticky, so, again, be sure to flour the dough and the work surface as needed to prevent the pin from sticking. Using the bench scraper or knife, this time lightly score the rectangle vertically into thirds. Each third will be 6 inches wide and 8 inches from top to bottom. Brush any loose flour off the dough. Take the right third of the dough and flip it over onto the middle third. Then take the left third of the dough and flip that third on top of the middle and right thirds. (This is like folding a business letter.) Your dough should now be about 6 inches wide, 8 inches from top to bottom, and about 2 inches thick. Rotate the dough pile clockwise 90 degrees; it will now be 8 inches wide and 6 inches from top to bottom.",
      "Place the dough on a baking sheet and cover it completely with plastic wrap, tucking the plastic under the dough as if you are tucking it into bed. Refrigerate for at least 1 1/2 hours and no more than 3 hours.",
      "Remove the dough from the refrigerator and place it on a well-floured work surface, with a long side of the rectangle facing you. This time roll out the dough into a rectangle about 18 inches wide and 12 inches from top to bottom. If the dough resists rolling, let it sit and relax for up to 15 minutes and roll again. Once again score it vertically into thirds, and then give it another letter fold (fold the right third onto the middle third, and fold the left third on top of that). Return the dough to the baking sheet and again cover it completely with plastic wrap. This time let it rest in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours or up to 16 hours.",
      "Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.",
      "Remove the dough from the refrigerator, and place it once again on a well-floured work surface, with a long side of the rectangle facing you. Roll it out into a long, narrow rectangle about 30 inches wide and 6 to 7 inches from top to bottom.",
      "Starting at the bottom left corner of the rectangle, make a mark along the bottom edge of the rectangle every 5 inches until you reach the bottom right corner. Then, starting at the top left corner of the rectangle, mark along the top edge exactly midway between the notches on the bottom edge. Your first notch will be 2 1/2 inches from the left corner and then continue to notch every 5 inches. Use a chef's knife to cut the dough rectangle into triangles by cutting on the diagonal from notch to notch. You will end up with 10 triangles and a few edge pieces of scrap.",
      "Starting at the edge, cut a 1-inch vertical slit at the center of the base of each triangle. Turn all of the triangles so the base is at the top, farthest from you, and the point is directed toward you. Pick up a triangle and hold it by its base with one hand and gently stretch it and stroke it lengthwise with your other hand to elongate it to 10 to 12 inches in length.",
      "Place the lengthened triangle on the work surface. Fan open the base at the 1-inch slit into a Y, and then roll the dough down to the point. Place the rolled triangle, point-side down, on the parchment-lined baking sheet, so the point is touching the parchment. Repeat with the remaining dough triangles, spacing the pastries 2 to 3 inches apart on the baking sheet.",
      "Cover the croissants lightly with plastic wrap and leave them in a warm place for 2 to 2 1/2 hours, or until they are somewhat poufy and airy.",
      "In a small bowl, whisk the egg until blended. Gently brush the croissants lightly with the egg.",
      "If you are baking the croissants the same day, cover them again with plastic wrap and let them finish proofing for another 1 hour to 1 hour and 30 minutes. They will get even more poufy and jiggly when you nudge them.",
      "Position a rack in the center of the oven, and heat the oven to 400\u00b0F.",
      "When the croissants are done proofing, brush them again with the beaten egg. Bake at 400\u00b0F for the first 5 minutes, then turn down the oven to 350\u00b0F and bake for another 25 to 35 minutes (for a total baking time of 30 to 40 minutes), or until they are golden brown all over. Let cool on the pan on a wire rack for 30 to 40 minutes. Serve warm.",
      "If you are baking the croissants the next day, after the first 2- to 2 1/2-hour proof, brush them lightly with the beaten egg as directed, wrap them in plastic wrap and place in the refrigerator. The next morning, remove them from the refrigerator and let them sit at room temperature for 30 to 40 minutes. Then heat the oven, brush them again with the beaten egg, and bake as directed.",
      "The croissants taste best the day they are baked. They can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature overnight, and then refreshed in a 300\u00b0F oven for 5 to 8 minutes before serving."

Pound the butter flat, gather it back up into a mound, and pound it out again, until it is cold and pliable. Place butter between two sheets of plastic wrap or parchment paper. Using a rolling pin, roll out the butter into a 7- by 10-inch rectangle. Transfer to the refrigerator to chill.",
      "On a floured surface, press the dough into a large rectangle, fold into thirds, and allow it to proof on the bench for 20 minutes. Roll the dough out into a 21- by 10-inch rectangle. Place the butter sheet in the center of the dough. Fold the long dough flaps over the top to seal in the butter. Turn the dough 90 degrees so the line where the two flaps meet is vertical. Carefully roll the dough out into a large rectangle. Fold the sides towards the center in thirds like a business letter, wrap in plastic, and chill for 30 minutes. Repeat rolling and folding steps two more times. Wrap the dough in plastic and chill weighted under a heavy pan overnight.",
      "Carefully roll out the chilled dough into an approximate 22- by 9-inch rectangle, taking care not to press the brittle, chilled butter through the dough. Trim edges to make a 21- by 8-inch rectangle, then make small marks every three inches along the top edge of the dough. Do the same on the bottom, offsetting the marking 1 1/2-inches from the edge of the dough (connecting the top markings and bottom markings should create long skinny triangle). Cut diagonal lines between the marks, forming triangles.",
      "Working with 1 triangle at a time, place the triangle on a lightly floured work surface with the point facing away from you. Cut a 1/2-inch slit in the center of the base and spread the dough gently apart. Begin rolling the croissant from the two flaps of dough created by the cut, and roll up to the point of the triangle. The point should end up tucked under the croissant. Bring the two ends together to form a crescent shape. Transfer to a parchment-lined baking sheet. Repeat with remaining croissants, leaving 3 inches of space between each croissant (you will need two trays total). Set in a warm spot and let rise until roughly doubled in size, about 45 minutes longer.",
      "Preheat the oven to 400\u00b0F. Carefully brush the croissants with egg wash. Bake for 20 minutes, rotating halfway through, then reduce the heat to 375\u00b0F and continue baking until the croissants are golden brown, 10 to 20 minutes longer. Remove from oven and allow to cool before serving."

      "In a large skillet, heat the remaining 1/4 cup olive oil over medium-high heat until hot but not smoking. Crack the eggs into the skillet and season with salt and pepper. Reduce the heat to medium and cook the eggs until the whites are just set, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat.",
      "In a large bowl, toss the greens and croutons with the dressing. Divide the salad among six serving plates. Top each with an egg and garnish with grated cheese.",
      "Always taste dandelion greens before buying them; sometimes they can be too bitter. Just tear off a tiny piece of a leaf (most vendors at the farmers' market will let you do this) and take a bite. The greens should have a hint of bitterness, but it shouldn't be overwhelming."

Spread the spicy paste over the pork, coating it on all sides, then tightly roll up the pork inside the foil, tucking in the sides as you go, as if you're making a burrito. Use another long strip of foil to create another layer, being sure to seal the pork tightly inside the foil.

      "Seasoning the chicken (1 to 3 days before serving; for 3 1/4 to 3 1/2 pound chickens, at least 2 days): Remove and discard the lump of fat inside the chicken. Rinse the chicken and pat very dry inside and out. Be thorough--a wet chicken will spend too much time steaming before it begins to turn golden brown.",
      "Approaching from the edge of the cavity, slide a finger under the skin of each of the breasts, making 2 little pockets. Now use the tip of your finger to gently loosen a pocket of skin on the outside of the thickest section of each thigh. Using your finger, shove an herb sprig into each of the 4 pockets.",
      "Season the chicken liberally all over with salt and the pepper (we use 3/4 teaspoon sea salt per pound of chicken). Season the thick sections a little more heavily than the skinny ankles and wings. Sprinkle a little of the salt just inside the cavity, on the backbone, but don't otherwise worry about seasoning the inside. Twist and tuck the wing tips behind the shoulders. Cover loosely and refrigerate.",
      "Preheat the oven to 475 degrees. Depending on the size, efficiency, and accuracy of your oven, and the size of your bird, you may need to adjust the heat to as high as 500 degrees or as low as 450 degrees during the course of roasting the chicken to get it to brown properly. If that proves to be the case, begin at that temperature the next time you roast a chicken. If you have a convection function on your oven, use it for the first 30 minutes; it will enhance browning, and may reduce overall cooking time by 5 to 10 minutes.",
      "Choose a shallow flameproof roasting pan or dish barely larger than the chicken, or use a 10-inch skillet with an all-metal handle. Preheat the pan over medium heat. Wipe the chicken dry and set it breast side up in the pan. It should sizzle.",
      "Place in the center of the oven and listen and watch for it to start sizzling and browning within 20 minutes. If it doesn't, raise the temperature progressively until it does. The skin should blister, but if the chicken begins to char, or the fat is smoiking, reduce the temperature by 25 degrees. After about 30 minutes, turn the bird over (drying the bird and preheating the pan should keep the skin from sticking.) Roast for another 10 to 20 minutes, depending on size, then flip back over to recrisp the breast skin, another 5 to 10 minutes. Total oven time will be 45 minutes to an hour.",
      "Remove the chicken from the oven and turn off the heat. Lift the chicken from the roasting pan and set on a plate. Carefully pour the clear fat from the roasting pan, leaving the lean drippings behind. Add about a tablespoon of water to the hot pan and swirl it. Slash the stretched skin between the thighs and breasts of the chicken, then tilt the bird and plate over the roasting pan to drain the juice into the drippings. Set the chicken in a warm spot (which may be your stovetop), and leave to rest. The meat will become more tender and uniformly succulent as it cools. Tilt the roasting pan and skim the last of the fat. Place over medium-low heat, add any juice that has collected under the chicken, and bring to a simmer. Stir and scrape to soften any hard golden drippings. Taste--the juices will be extremely flavorful.",

Set over medium heat and stir gently with a fork, taking care not to splash, until sugar dissolves and the mixture begins to simmer. Simmer, undisturbed, until the mixture reaches between 280 and 290\u00b0F on a candy thermometer. Due to the molasses, the mixture will have a sketchy burning smell, but remain within the recommended temperatures and rest assured that it's not actually burning. Cooking molasses just smells funky.",
      "While the syrup is cooking, grind the peanuts and powdered sugar together in a food processor until the mixture forms a thick, damp mass with a texture like wet sand. Set aside.",
      "When the syrup comes to temperature, immediately pour the mixture onto the silicon mat in the sheet pan, taking care to keep the syrup within the center of the mat. Wearing a pair of oven mitts, tilt the pan left and right to help the syrup evenly coat the silicon mat into a roughly 14\" by 10\" rectangular shape.",

Wait a few moments for it to cool, then peel the silicon away; no rush. Now fold this double-thick section up and over the remaining piece. You will now have a 3 layer candy packet roughly 11\" x 5\".",
      "Place the sheet pan in the preheated oven for 5 minutes, or until the candy has become warm and pliable. Remove it from the oven and lift out the silicon mat, setting it on the counter. Use a rolling pin to gently roll it out to a 14\" x 10\" rectangle; it will take some elbow grease. If at any time the candy begins to make a cracking sound, or feels too stiff to roll, return the pan to the oven for a minute or two. Take your time! Once you've rolled it out, fold it into thirds again just as you did the first time.",
      "Return the candy to the oven for another 4 minutes, then roll back out to a 14\" x 10\" rectangle. Sprinkle this rectangle with corn flakes, as you did with the peanut mixture.

Return folded packet to the oven for another 4 minutes.",

Set stand mixer speed to medium-low, then check that the pasta-roller attachment is set to its widest setting.

Fold the dough sheet in half, making it half of its original length. Press down on the seam to flatten it, then run the sheet seam side first through the second-widest setting, followed by the third-widest setting. The dough should now feel cohesive and strong, not pebbly or grainy.",
      "Fold dough sheet in half again, making it half its original length. Press down on the seam to flatten it and cut off both corners of the seam diagonally, so that the dough sheet fits easily into the rollers. Run the sheet seam side first through the widest setting of the pasta rollers, then through the next-widest setting, then through the next-widest setting, and finally again through the next-widest setting. Fold in half lengthwise, press down on the seam, cut off the corners, and repeat the process. If this is done correctly, longitudinal lines will form on the sheet of dough. If you do not see these longitudinal lines, repeat the process until they appear-they are an indication that the gluten has been properly developed.",
      "Wrap dough sheet in plastic wrap or place it, folded, in a zipper-lock bag, then repeat the process with the remaining 2 portions of dough. Let dough sheets rest for at least 30 minutes before proceeding.",
      "Working with 1 dough sheet at a time, fold sheet in half, press down on the seam, cut off the corners of the seam, then run the sheet seam side first through the widest setting of the rollers, then through progressively narrow settings on your pasta machine, until it reaches the thickness you desire (~1 to 1.5 mm). Run the final dough sheet through the spaghetti-cutting attachment. Dust noodles with potato starch or cornstarch to prevent sticking, shake off excess starch, and fold noodles into loose nests.",
      "Place noodles in a zipper-lock bag, seal almost completely, and refrigerate at least overnight, but preferably for 4 to 7 days.

If using noodle baskets, add noodles to baskets and plunge into water, rapidly stirring noodles with tongs or chopsticks to prevent sticking. If not using noodle baskets, add noodles directly to boiling water and stir vigorously with tongs or chopsticks to prevent sticking. Cook, stirring occasionally, for about 2 minutes. (The exact cooking time will depend on your preferences for doneness and on the thickness of the noodles; see note.)

      "Wipe rims of jars with a damp towel. Place lids on top, then screw on rings only to finger-tightness. Over-tightening lids can prevent the canning process from working.",
      "Set a rack on the bottom of a stockpot, making sure the pot is large enough to hold the jars and allow at least 2 inches of water above them. Fill pot about halfway with water. Bring to a rolling boil. Meanwhile, bring a kettle of water to a boil as well.",
      "When water is boiling, carefully lower jars into pot using jar-lifting tongs. When all jars are in the pot, if water does not cover them by at least 2 inches, add more boiling water from kettle until they are covered by 2 inches.",
      "Cover pot and return to a rolling boil. Process tomatoes at a boil for 85 minutes at sea level; add 5 minutes to this time for every 1,000 feet above sea level. Remove jars when processing time is complete.",
      "Set canner's rack in the bottom of pressure canner and add about 4 inches water. Using jar-lifting tongs, carefully lower jars into pressure canner. Seal canner lid following manufacturer's instructions. If using a weighted-gauge pressure canner, bring to 10 psi and process for 25 minutes. If using a dial-gauge pressure canner, bring to 11 psi and process for 25 minutes. If above an elevation of 1,000 feet, increase pressure setting to 15 psi for a weighted-gauge canner or 12 psi for a dial-gauge canner. (Follow manufacturer's instructions exactly for specifics on how to operate your canner.)",
      "Allow pressure canner to depressurize by venting it following manufacturer's instructions. Once fully vented to 0 psi, let stand for 10 minutes. Attempt to remove lid only once canner has fully depressurized and has sat for 10 minutes. Attempting to open a pressure canner before it has depressurized is extremely dangerous; do not do it. The 10-minute rest at 0 psi allows the jars to acclimate to lower pressure; skipping this by attempting to move the jars too soon can cause siphoning (loss of liquid in the jar). When ready, carefully remove pressure canner lid. Let jars rest 15 minutes inside canner before removing with the jar-lifter.",
      "Let jars stand for 24 hours, then check their seal. Lids should be taut, with no flex or give when you press down on them, and each jar should be at least halfway filled with liquid. If your jars do not pass the test, transfer to refrigerator and use tomatoes within 1 week. If they do pass the test, tomatoes can be stored in a dark, cool place for 12 to 18 months."

      "The wings are traditionally cut into three pieces. Using a heavy knife, cut through the joints in the wings to separate then into three pieces. A sharp knife should slide through the joint easily; there is no need to cut through any bone. It's easiest to see the joints with the underside of the wings facing up.",
      "The tips of the wing, which contain little to no meat, can be discarded or saved for the stock pot. Rinse the wings and pat them dry, then toss in a bowl with the oil and a good pinch each of salt and pepper.",

      "Depending on your method, the next step is to either toss the wings with a quarter of the sauce and refrigerate for an hour, or toss them in a bowl with the flour. The former method will infuse the wings with flavor, while the latter will create a crisp exterior that will eventually soak up lots of sauce. It's up to you.",
      "Preheat the oven to 400\u00b0F. Grease a baking sheet with a neutral oil such as canola, using a paper towel or brush to ensure it coats all of the surface. Arrange the wing pieces skin-side-up. They should be snug, but not too crowded. Keep in mind they will shrink as they cook.",
      "Cook undisturbed for 30 minutes until golden brown, and until the wings release easily from the baking sheet. Using a pair of tongs, turn the pieces over and return to the oven to bake for an additional 15 to 20 minutes, until crisp.",
      "When the wing are finished cooking, pour the Buffalo sauce into a shallow bowl (you'll probably have to do this in batches) and add a few wings at a time. Turn them in the sauce until well-coated, then transfer to a platter. Repeat with the remaining wings.",

Continue to wash down the sides with the brush dipped in clean water. After about 10 minutes, the mixture will begin to darken and turn amber. Begin swirling the pot over the burner to evenly distribute the caramelization. When the caramel grows darker and begins to smoke, immediately remove from heat and add the cream. Stand back, the mixture will grow and sputter. Once it dies down again, whisk in the vanilla and salt and continue to whisk until the mixture is smooth. Place in a heatproof container and allow it to cool for half an hour at room temperature before covering it and transferring to the fridge to cool completely, for at least one hour.",

Mix on low speed to combine. Add the buttermilk mixture and continue mixing just until the dough comes together. Remove the bowl from the mixer and use a spatula gently to fold in the 2 cups of flour you set aside. The dough will be very sticky.",
      "Transfer the dough to a 12 x 14 inch sheet of waxed or parchment paper. Put a second sheet of paper on top and roll the dough between the paper to an 8 x 10 inch oval 3/4 inch thick.

Transfer the doughnuts to the prepared baking sheet. Re-roll the scraps and repeat to make a total of 13 doughnuts and 13 holes. Cover with plastic wrap and chill in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes or up to 1 day. (If making dough ahead, bring it to room temperature before frying. I also experimented with freezing the dough, wrapped in parchment, at this point and defrosting completely before frying; the resulting doughnuts were excellent, but it was very hard to pry the defrosted dough from the parchment paper. I should have transferred the frozen donuts to a greased baking sheet, covered with plastic wrap, and defrosted in the refrigerator.)",

I adjusted the heat to keep the temperature between 365 and 375 when it threatened to climb past 380. Use your skimmer to remove the doughnuts to the paper towel-lined plate to drain for a second and immediately dip one side of each doughnut into the glaze. Put the doughnuts, glaze side up, on the rack; let set until the glaze sets, about 3 minutes.",

Remove with a slotted spoon, drain on wire racks, an cool for 10 to 15 minutes. With a sharp knife, slit the donuts open, working to free a pocket at the core. Ladle in berries and syrup, stuffing until the donuts are just shy of overflowing."

Add the egg, vanilla, and salt; beat until completely blended and smooth, about 1 1/2 minutes. On low speed, mix in half of the flour and then the melted chocolate just until evenly incorporated. Mix or stir in by hand the remaining flour until evenly incorporated. Set aside for 10 minutes; the dough will firm up slightly.",

Vigorously stir the ice-water mixture into the dry ingredients, scraping down the bowl sides completely and mixing until the dough is thoroughly blended. If it is too dry to mix together, gradually stir in just enough more ice water to blend the ingredients; don't over-moisten, as the dough should be fairly stiff. If necessary, stir in more flour to stiffen it. Brush or spray the dough top with oil. Tightly cover the bowl with plastic wrap. If desired, for best flavor or for convenience, you can refrigerate the dough for 3 to 10 hours. Then let rise at cool room temperature for 12 to 18 hours; if convenient, vigorously stir once during the rise.",

      "In the bowl of the stand mixer, combine 1 1/2 cups (360 ml) tepid water and the yeast and let sit for 20 to 30 seconds to allow the yeast to dissolve and activate. Dump the all-purpose flour, bread flour, sugar, and salt into the water. Carefully turn the mixer on to low speed and mix for about 10 seconds. (To prevent the flour from flying out of the bowl, turn the mixer on and off several times until the flour is mixed into the liquid, and then keep it on low speed.) When the dough is still shaggy looking, drizzle in the olive oil, aiming it along the side of the bowl to keep it from splashing and making a mess.",
      "With the mixer still on low speed, knead the dough for 4 to 5 minutes, or until it is smooth and supple. The dough should be somewhat sticky but still smooth and have an elastic, stretchy texture. (If it is much stiffer than this, mix 1 to 2 tablespoons water; if it is much looser than this, mix in 2 to 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour.)",
      "Lightly oil a large bowl. Transfer the dough to the oiled bowl, cover with an oiled piece of plastic wrap or a damp lint-free cloth, and place in a draft-free, warm (78\u00b0 to 82\u00b0F (25\u00b0 to 27\u00b0C) is ideal) area for 2 to 3 hours. An area near the stove or in the oven with only the oven light on is good. The dough should rise until it is about double in bulk. (This is called proofing the dough.)",
      "Once the dough has risen, flour your hands and the work surface and turn the dough out onto the work surface. Press the dough into an 8-inch (20-cm) square and fold the top edge of the square down to the center of the dough. Fold the bottom of the square up to the center of the dough and press the seam firmly with your fingers. Now fold the right side of the square into the center and the left side into the center, and again press the seam firmly. Turn the dough over, seam-side down, and shape the dough with a tucking motion so that it is about 6 inches (15 cm) square. Transfer the dough to the prepared baking sheet, generously flour the top of the dough, and then cover the dough loosely but completely with a damp lint-free cloth or a piece of plastic wrap. Place in a warm area (78\u00b0 to 82\u00b0F (25\u00b0 to 27\u00b0C)) for another hour or so, or until the dough rises a bit and gets puffy and pillowy. (This is proofing, again.)",
      "Preheat the oven to 400\u00b0F (200\u00b0C), and place a rack in the center of the oven. Sprinkle the baking sheet with the cornmeal and set aside.",
      "When the dough is ready, remove the cloth or plastic wrap. Using all ten fingers, press and poke and elongate the dough three or four times along its length so that you press and stretch it into an almost-square log that is about 10 inches (25 cm) long, 8 inches (20 cm) wide, and about 2 inches (5 cm) tall. Bake for 35 to 45 minutes, or until completely golden brown on the top and bottom. Lift the loaf and make sure the underside is browned before pulling it out of the oven, or you will end up with a soggy loaf. Let cool on the pan on a wire rack for about 30 minutes, or until cool enough to handle, then cut into slices 3/4 inch (2 cm) thick for sandwiches. The focaccia loaf will keep in a closed paper bag at room temperature for up to 3 days, or tightly wrapped in two layers of plastic wrap in the freezer for up to 2 weeks. If using day-old bread kept at room temperature, I suggest toasting it in a toaster to refresh it. If using bread that has been previously frozen, thaw it at room temperature for 3 to 4 hours and then refresh it in a 300\u00b0F (150\u00b0C) oven for about 5 minutes."

It is best if the dough is kept soft, but if it is difficult to handle, either add another tablespoon or two of flour or knead it in the food processor.",

Taste for salt, pour the contents of the pan into a bowl, and set aside to cool.",

      "Put the oil, butter, and chopped onion in a heavy-bottomed pot and turn the heat to medium. Cook and stir until the onion is translucent. Add the celery and carrot and cook for about 2 minutes, stirring to coat the vegetables with fat.",
      "Add the meat, a large pinch of salt, and some freshly ground pepper. Break the meat up with a fork, stir well, and cook until the meat has lost its raw color.",
      "Add the milk and let it simmer gently, stirring frequently, until it bubbles away completely (this took quite a while). Stir in about 1/8 teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg.",
      "Add the wine and let it simmer away (this took a while, too, but I did not want to raise the heat and boil the meat hard). When the wine has evaporated, stir in the tomatoes. (Cooking the meat in milk before adding the wine and tomatoes protects it from the acidic bite of the latter.) When they begin to bubble, turn the heat down so that the sauce cooks at the laziest of simmers, with just an intermittent bubble breaking through to the surface. Cook, uncovered, for 3 hours (or more-she says more is better), stirring from time to time. If the sauce begins to dry out, add 1/2 cup of water whenever necessary to keep it from sticking. At the end, there should be no water left, and the fat must separate from the sauce. Taste for salt.",
      "Toss with cooked, drained pasta and the remaining tablespoon of butter. Serve freshly grated cheese at the table.",
      "Hazan advises you to mix the dough on a flat work surface by building a mountain of flour, making a crater in its peak, dumping the eggs into the crater, and mixing them gradually with the flour. Since this method has, in my kitchen, led to unstoppable egg rivulets and much frustration more than once, now I mix pasta dough in a big bowl. Mound the flour in a big bowl and scoop out a deep well in its center. Crack the eggs into the well (I add a little pinch of salt to the eggs; Hazan says it is unnecessary, but I am a compulsive salter). Beat the eggs lightly with a fork for about 1 minute. Then gradually begin to draw flour into the eggs, mixing it in as you continue to beat. Keep going, little by little, until the eggs are no longer runny. Now comes one of those situations where you are supposed to use as little flour as possible, the kind of thing you can judge only with time and experience (I'm not there yet, but my pasta is still quite edible): \"Draw the sides of the mound together with your hands, but push some of the flour to one side, keeping it out of the way until you find you absolutely need it. Work the eggs and flour together, using your fingers and the palms of your hands, until you have a smoothly integrated mixture. If it is still moist, work in more flour.\" When you think the dough is right (i.e. does not need any more flour), wash your hands, dry them completely, and plunge your thumb into the dough. If it comes out clean, with no sticky matter on it, no more flour is needed.",
      "If your dough still doesn't seem quite right, it probably will after you knead it. Knead for 8 minutes, pushing the heel of your palm into the dough, folding it in half, giving it a half turn, and repeating. After 8 minutes, the dough should be \"as smooth as baby skin.\"",
      "Now it's time to roll out the pasta. Cut the dough into 6 equal parts (if you started with 2 eggs; 12 equal parts if you started with 4, and so on) and spread out clean, dry dish towels for the pasta to rest on. Begin by putting each lump of dough through the widest setting on the pasta machine. Fold it into thirds like an envelope and feed the narrow end through the widest setting again. Repeat 2 or 3 times, then lay the strip of dough on a dish towel and move on to the next lump. Once each bit of dough has been through the widest setting, decrease the roller width a notch and put them all through again. Continue to decrease the rollers' thickness until the dough is quite thin-I go to the arbitrarily-named setting \"7,\" which is the third-thinnest setting on my machine. The gradual progression from thicker to thinner is, Hazan says, one of the things that makes homemade pasta so good, so don't try to speed things up by skipping some of the intermediate thicknesses.",
      "Let the sheets of pasta dry for at least 10 minutes, turning them over from time to time. The pasta is ready to cut when it no longer sticks to itself but is not yet so dry that it cracks. For Bolognese sauce, you should hand-cut tagliatelle. Fold the properly-dried sheets of pasta loosely along their length so that you end up with a flat roll about 3 inches wide at its sides. With a cleaver or similar knife (I used my pastry scraper), slice the roll into 1/4 inch wide ribbons. Cut parallel to the original length of the pasta strip so that when you unroll the noodles they are the full length of the strip. But don't stress out about this-the pasta will be delicious no matter what shape it is.",
      "Cook the pasta in lots of boiling salted water for 1 1/2 - 2 minutes, until it is al dente. Drain and toss immediately with the hot sauce and butter."

      "Heat the butter and oil over a medium high flame in a heavy-bottomed pot that will accommodate the pork snugly. When the butter foam subsides, put the meat in, fat side facing down. As it browns, turn it every few moments for even coloring all around. If you should find the butter becoming very dark, lower the heat.",
      "Add the salt, pepper, and 1 cup of milk. Add the milk slowly, or it will boil over. Allow the milk to come to a simmer for 20 or 30 seconds, turn the heat down to a minimum, and cover the pot, leaving the lid slightly ajar.",
      "Cook at a very lazy simmer for about 1 hour, turning the meat from time to time, until the milk has thickened, through evaporation, into a nut-brown sauce. (The exact time it will take depends largely on the heat of your burner and the thickness of your pot. In my case, there was such a thick layer of fat on top of the milk that I couldn't really tell what was going on beneath it. It didn't seem to me it was ever going to turn nut-brown, and so eventually I forged ahead anyway, which may explain my sauce's less than successful final aspect.) When the milk reaches this stage and not before, add 1 more cup of milk, let it simmer for about 10 minutes, then cover the pot tightly. Check and turn the pork from time to time.",
      "After 30 minutes, set the lid slightly ajar. Continue to cook over minimum heat, and when you see there is no more liquid milk in the pot, add the other 1/2 cup milk. Continue cooking until the meat feels tender when prodded with a fork and all the milk has coagulated into small nut-brown clusters. Altogether it will take between 2 1/2 and 3 hours. (If, before the meat is fully cooked, you find that the liquid in the pot has evaporated, add another 1/2 cup of milk, repeating the step if necessary.)",
      "When the pork has become tender and all the milk in the pot has thickened into dark clusters (again, this didn't look as if it was ever going to happen for me), transfer the meat to a cutting board. Let it settle for a few minutes, then cut it into slices about 3/8 inch thick or slightly less, and arrange them on a warm serving platter.",
      "Tip the pot and spoon off most of the fat-there may be as much as a cup of it-being careful to leave behind all the coagulated milk clusters. Add 2 or 3 tablespoons of water, and boil away the water over high heat while using a wooden spoon to scrape loose cooking residues from the bottom and sides of the pot. Spoon all the pot juices over the pork and serve immediately.",
      "Cut the chard stalks into pieces about 4 inches long, and wash them in cold water. Bring 3 quarts water to a boil and cook the stalks at a moderate boil until they feel tender when prodded with a fork, about 30 minutes according to author (I cooked them for only about 15). Drain and set aside.",
      "Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.",
      "Smear the bottom and sides of a baking dish with butter and place a layer of chard stalks on the bottom, laying them end to end and trimming to fit if necessary. Sprinkle lightly with salt and grated cheese and dot sparingly with butter. Repeat the procedure, building up layers of stalks until you have used them all. The top layer should be sprinkled generously with Parmesan and thickly dotted with butter.",
      "Bake on the top rack of the preheated oven until the cheese melts and forms a light, golden crust on top. You might begin to check after 10 or 15 minutes, but in my experience it takes 20 or 25 minutes. When the gratin comes out of the oven, let it settle for a few minutes before bringing it to the table.",

Simply spoon the sorbet into the shells, then return the stuffed tangerines to the freezer and wait 45 minutes to serve. My tasting panel thought the sorbet could have been less sweet, but then we wondered if decreasing the sugar would have given the frozen sorbet a less lovely texture; it was bright and effervescent, though nothing bubbly had been added!"

Knead with the dough hook until the mixture is smooth and elastic.The dough should completely gather around the hook and the bowl should be clean.

Add the olive oil and continue kneading until the oil is completely incorporated into the dough. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and set aside until doubled in size, about an hour. Meanwhile, line a baking sheet with parchment paper and sprinkle cornmeal on the sheet.",
      "Flour your work surface and turn out the dough. Knead it briefly. Cut off a piece of dough that's about 1/4 of the dough, form it into a rectangle, and roll it to about 3 inches wide by 12 inches long. Using a pastry cutter, pizza cutter, or sharp knife, trim the edges, then cut it into 4 strips - this will form the 8 legs. Lay the strips on the baking sheet to form the legs of the spider. Stretch them longer, if you like or trim them so they're shorter - it's your spider, so make it look however you like. Take the trimmed pieces, and add them to the unused piece of dough. Divide that piece into two, with once piece about 1/3 of the dough and the other piece 2/3 of the dough. Form those pieces into to rounds, and arrange them on top of the legs you formed to make the head and body of the spider. Make sure the two pieces are touching each other. Adjust the legs so they look the way you want them to. Cover the completed spider with plastic wrap and set aside until doubled in size, about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F with the rack in the center of the oven.",
      "Uncover the spider. If you're using several types of seeds, it's best to eggwash one part of the spider at a time. I eggwashed the legs first and sprinkled them with poppy seeds, then I eggwashed the body and sprinkled that with brown sesame seeds. Before you sprinkle the head section, cut the dried fruit (if needed) to the shape you want and apply them to the eggwashed head section. Then sprinkle the head with the seeds you choose. I used a combination of toasted sesame seeds and poppy seeds for the head. Make a vertical snip to create the mouth, and if you like, make small snips at the ends of the front feet for a little extra character. Bake at 350\u00b0F until the bread is nicely browned, about 30 minutes. Rotate the pan in the oven so it bakes evenly during baking, if necessary."

The best way to do this is to place each peach half cut side down on a cutting board and slice it crosswise into thin slices, keeping the sliced half intact. Then lift each half on a spatula, press down on the half lightly to fan it just a bit and place it in the crust, with the edge of the outer peach slice almost touching the edge of the crust, so you have 5 peach \"spokes\" and an empty space in the center. Trim the remaining unsliced peach half so it will fit into the center of the tart and, using the tip of your knife, cut a little tic-tac-toe pattern in the center of the peach. Set aside while you make the creamy filling.",
      "Whisk the cream, egg, sugar and almond extract together in a small bowl. When blended, rap the bowl on the counter to knock out the air bubbles, and pour the filling over and around the peaches.",

Carefully pull the baking sheet to the front of the oven (if you can manage to get the streusel onto the tart without removing the tart from the oven and jostling the delicate filling, so much the better, but pull it out completely if it's easier) and sprinkle the streusel evenly over the creamy parts of the tart.",
      "Bake for another 20 to 25 minutes (total baking time is 50 to 55 minutes), or until the filling is set and the streusel is golden. Remove the tart from the oven and transfer t he pan to a rack to cool until barely warm or at room temperature.",

Scatter the pieces of butter over the dry ingredients and pulse until the butter is coarsely cut in-you should have some pieces the size of oatmeal flakes and some the size of peas. Stir the yolk, just to break it up, and add it a little at a time, pulsing after each addition. When the egg is in, process in long pulses-about 10 seconds each-until the dough, which will look granular soon after the egg is added, forms clumps and curds. Just before you reach this stage, the sound of the machine working the dough will change-heads up. Turn the dough out onto a work surface and, very lightly and sparingly, knead the dough just to incorporate any dry ingredients that might have escaped mixing.",
      "Butter a 9-inch fluted tart pan with a removable bottom. Press the dough evenly over the bottom and up the sides of the pan, using all but one little piece of dough, which you should save in the refrigerator to patch any cracks after the crust is baked. Don't be too heavy-handed-press the crust in so that the edges of the pieces cling to one another, but not so hard that the crust loses its crumbly texture. Freeze the crust for at least 30 minutes, preferably longer, before baking.",
      "Center a rack in the oven and preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.",

Put the tart pan on a baking sheet and bake the crust for 25 minutes. Carefully remove the foil. If the crust has puffed, press it down gently with the back of a spoon. For a partially baked crust, patch the crust if necessary, then transfer the crust to a cooling rack (keep it in its pan)."

      "Poach the quince first: Make a syrup of 1 cup water, 1/2 cup sugar, and the bit of vanilla bean in a non-corroding saucepan. Quarter, core, and peel the quince, cut it into 1/2-inch slices, and add it to the syrup. Bring to a simmer, cover, and cook, barely simmering, for about 2 1/2 hours, until the slices are a deep rose color. Don't stir: instead, push them gently under the liquid from time to time so the slices don't break up. When cooked, chill the quince slices in their poaching liquid.",
      "Poach the pears: Make a syrup of 2 cups water, 2/3 cup sugar, and the strip of lemon zest. Halve, peel, and core the pears. Put them into the simmering syrup and cook, barely simmering and covered, for 20 to 30 minutes, or until they are tender and translucent but not falling apart. Chill them in all but 1 cup of their syrup.",
      "Poach the figs: Take 1 cup of the syrup the pears were poached in and heat it to a simmer. Rinse the figs, cut off any tough tips from their stem ends, add to the syrup, and again barely simmer for 10 to 12 minutes, or until they are heated through. (Be careful not to overcook; I did, and they got a bit mushy.) Then chill the figs in their syrup.",
      "When you are ready to serve the compote, slice the pears lengthwise into pieces about 1/3 inch thick. Arrange the poached fruits and the raspberries as prettily as you can. Add enough of the quince syrup to the pear syrup to turn it pale pink and add lemon juice to taste. Pour some of the syrup over the fruit and serve cold."

Carefully place a second rectangle on top of the first, and press to seal the edges together. Repeat with remaining rectangles, then crimp the edges with the tines of a fork. Using the fork tines, puncture the top layer of the pastry a few times. Refrigerate, uncovered, for at least 15 minutes or up to 2 hours. Repeat the rolling, cutting, filling, and crimping with the second half of the dough. Gather the dough scraps from both halves, form into a ball, and roll out to make a few more pastries.

      "Liberally butter two 6-by-3-inch regular or contour cake pans and dust with sifted cocoa powder. Tap out the excess cocoa. Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F.",
      "Sift together the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, baking powder, and salt into a bowl and set aside.",
      "Put the chocolate in a heatproof bowl and pour the boiling water over it. Whisk until the chocolate is melted. Let the mixture cool for 15 minutes.",
      "In a separate bowl, whisk together the buttermilk and vanilla. Set aside.",
      "In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, whisk the eggs on high speed until foamy, about 2 minutes. Reduce the speed to low and slowly pour in the oil, whisking until combined, about 30 seconds. Raise the speed to medium and whisk until fully incorporated, about 30 seconds longer.",
      "Reduce the speed to low and slowly pour the cooled chocolate mixture into the egg mixture. Slowly pour in the buttermilk and vanilla mixture. Add the sugar and whisk until the batter is smooth and liquid, about 2 minutes.",
      "Stop the mixer. Remove the bowl and add the sifted dry ingredients and mix until just incorporated, preferably by hand, lifting and folding in from the bottom center. Using a rubber spatula, scrape down the sides of the bowl and mix again just briefly by hand. The batter may still look a little lumpy, but stop mixing.",
      "Pour the batter through a medium-mesh sieve into a large measuring cup or bowl to remove any lumps. Press against the solids in the sieve with a rubber spatula to push through as much batter as possible, then discard the lumps. Divide the batter between the prepared pans. Bake until the tops spring back when lightly pressed and a tester inserted in the centers comes out clean, about 45 minutes.",
      "Transfer to wire racks and let cool in the pans for about 20 minutes. When the cakes are cooled enough to handle the pans but still a tad warm to the touch, carefully run an offset spatula around the edges of the pans to loosen them, then invert the cakes onto the racks and remove the pans. (Note: If you are making the Old-Fashioned Cake and therefore using a contour pan, just invert the pans and drop them sharply onto the racks; they should fall out cleanly. Using an offset spatula in a contour pan will mar the edges of the cake.) Let cool for about 20 minutes longer. Wrap the cakes tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate to ensure that the interiors are completely cooled before decorating, at least 1 hour or for up to 3 days. To freeze, wrap tightly in a second layer of plastic and store in the freezer up to 2 months.",
      "Combine the sugar, cream of tartar, and water in a small saucepan fitted with a candy thermometer. Stir the sugar to dissolve and begin to heat it over medium-low. Have a heatproof measuring cup sitting nearby.",
      "Put the egg whites and vanilla in a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. When the sugar reaches 240\u00b0F, immediately pour it into the measuring cup to prevent it from getting hotter. With the mixer on medium speed, slowly pour the sugar syrup into the egg whites, aiming for the side of the bowl rather than the whisk. When all the syrup is added, turn the mixer to medium-high and whisk until the icing becomes thick and holds a firm peak. Continue to whisk until the icing is just slightly warm and very thick, about 10 minutes total. Do not continue to beat, or the icing will become too thick to spread and pipe. Use immediately on an Old-Fashioned Cake or on any other cake. Boiled icing must be used fresh and cannot be stored.",
      "Make the Double Chocolate Cake as directed, using a contour pan, and make sure it is cool inside and out. (If frozen, let thaw in the refrigerator, 3 to 4 hours. If time demands, you can thaw on the countertop, 1 to 2 hours, but be careful not let it sit too much longer before you begin working with it, as the texture will lose quality.)",
      "Center the cake on a presentation plate or platter, dome-side up. Clear a space in your refrigerator large enough for the cake on its platter.",
      "Fit a pastry bag with a medium (1/2- or 5/8-inch) round tip and fill halfway with the Boiled Icing. Pull up the cuff and twist it to seal and tighten the frosting down into the cone. Purge the bag of air bubbles by squeezing the bag until there is a burst of air and frosting sputters out of the bag. Keep the bag tightly twisted so that the frosting doesn't come back up on your hands. Holding the piping tip at a 90-degree angle about 1 inch above the center of the cake, squeeze firmly to release a large mound of icing. Keep the tip slightly submerged in the icing and continue. Begin to slowly squeeze the bag again, more gently this time, so that the icing continues to flow outward (like lava) and move the bag slightly in tiny, smooth, uniform circles to increase the flow until you make a mound that tops the cake, about 2 to 3 inches thick. Stop about 1/4 inch from the edge to show off the contour of the cake. When the icing process is complete, pull the tip straight up to make a point in the middle for the final flourish.",
      "Gently squeeze the cherry to drain it of any excess syrup, and wrap it in a paper towel for about 10 minutes. This will keep it from bleeding on the icing.",
      "Place the maraschino cherry in the center of the cake with the stem raised attractively at a 45-degree angle. Refrigerate the cake for at least 30 minutes and up to 8 hours. Remove from the refrigerator 30 minutes before serving. It is best to eat the cake the same day you make it."

      "At this point the eggs are cooked enough for me and Kenny, but he and I like our eggs soft. But as Kenny says, \"I like my eggs soft, with different levels of cookedness within them.\" If you like your eggs more cooked, cook them more. Serve with the toast."
