This was a quick, easy recipe that I will be working into my OAMC routine. Today, I added garlic and chopped onion to the hamburg, like always.

      "Place dry ingredients in a 4 to 6 quart bowl; make a well in the middle and pour in liquids (reserving tsp of olive oil). Combine ingredients. Lightly oil your hands and begin kneading the dough; knead for 5 minutes. When done the dough should be slightly tacky (that is, it should be barely beyond sticking to your hands).",
      "Lightly oil the dough ball and the interior of a 1-quart glass bowl. Place the dough ball in bowl and seal bowl w/ food wrap. Set aside at room to rise until double in bulk - about 1 1/2 to 2 hours.",
      "Punch down the dough, re-form a nice round ball and return it to the same bowl; cover again w/ wrap. Refrigerate overnight, airtight.",
      "About 2 hours before you are ready to assemble pizza, remove the dough from refrigerator. Divide dough into 2 equal portions (or 4 equal portions if making appetizer-sized pizza or if smaller 6-inch pizzas are desired).",
      "Roll the smaller doughs into round balls on a smooth, clean surface; be sure to seal any holes by pinching or rolling.",
      "Place the newly formed dough balls in a glass casserole dish, spaced far enough apart to allow for each to double in size. Seal the top of the dish airtight with clear food wrap. Set aside at room temperature until the dough balls have doubled in size (about 2 hours). They should be smooth and puffy.",
      "To stretch and form the dough for pizza: Sprinkle a medium dusting of flour over a 12x12-inch clean, smooth surface. Use a metal spatula or dough scraper to carefully remove a dough ball from the glass casserole dish, being very careful to preserve its round shape. Flour the dough liberally. Place the floured dough on the floured smooth surface. Use your hand or rolling pin to press the dough down forming a flat circle about 1/2-inch thick. Pinch the dough between your fingers all around the edge of the circle, forming a lip or rim that rises about 1/4-inch above the center surface of the dough. You may continue this outward stretching motion of the hands until you have reached a 9-inch diameter pizza dough.",
      "To dress the pizza:Lightly sprinkle cornmeal, semolina or flour over the surface of a wooden pizza peel. Arrange the stretched dough over the floured peel surface. Work quickly to dress the pizza so that the dough won't become soggy or sticky from the sauces and toppings.",
      "When you are ready to transfer the pizza to the pizza stone in the preheated oven, grasp the handle of the peel and execute a very small test jerk to verify that the pizza will come easily off the peel. If the dough doesn't move freely, carefully lift the edges of the dough and try to rotate it by hand. Extreme cases may require that you toss more flour under the dough edges.",
      "Once the dough is moving easily on the peel, open the oven and position the edge of the peel over the center of the stone about 2/3 from the front of the stone. *Jiggle and tilt the peel to get the pizza to start sliding off. When the pizza begins to touch the stone, pull the peel quickly out from under it. Don't attempt to move the pizza until it has begun to set (about 3 minutes). The peel can be slid under the pizza to move it or remove it."

While it goes in, drop by drop, you must not stop beating until the sauce has thickened. A speed of 2 strokes per second is fast enough. You can switch hands or switch directions, it makes no difference as long as you beat constantly. Add the drops of oil with a teaspoon, or rest the lip of the bottle on the edge of the bowl. Keep your eye on the oil rather than on the sauce. Stop pouring and continue beating every 10 seconds or so, to be sure the egg yolks are absorbing the oil. After 1/3 to 1/2 cup of oil has been incorporated, the sauce will thicken into a very heavy cream and the crisis is over. The beating arm may rest a moment. Then beat in the remaining oil by 1 to 2 tablespoon dollops, blending it thoroughly after each addition.",

Store the roasted garlic in an airtight container in the fridge.",

Please the roast in a 1 gallon zip-top bag, and then pour marinade into bag. Remove as much excess air as possible, and then seal bag. Massage the roast in the bag to make sure the meat is fully coated in the marinade. Place in refrigerator and let marinate for 5-6 hours.",
      "About 30 minutes before you are ready to cook, remove the meat from the bag , allowing as much of the excess oil to stay behind in the bag. Leave the meat on a plate lined with paper towels, so that residual marinade will drain off. You can now also preheat your grill to high (if using gas), with the cover closed to help the inside of the grill get as hot as possible.",
      "Now that the meat has \"tempered\" (taken off the chill from the fridge), pat any residual marinade dry with a paper towel, then liberally season all sides of the roast with salt & pepper. Carefully place meat onto the grill, close the lid, and cook on high for 5-7 minutes, or until a good sear with visible grill marks. Flip meat over, close the lid, and grill the other side and additional 5-7 minutes. Reduce the flame directly under the roast to low, and keep the other side of the grill at medium. Flip the roast back to the first side, then close the grill and cook an additional 8-10 minutes (4-5 minutes on each side). A 2-pound roast will need about 20-25 minutes of total cooking time - but play it safe and use an instant read thermometer to check the temperature, pulling it from the grill when the thickest part reaches 130&deg;F.",

Refrigerate for another 10 minutes, if necessary. Finish with a smooth layer of melted chocolate. Refrigerate the pie until the chocolate is firm, about 30 minutes.

      "After a few minutes add in the mushrooms and bell pepper and let those simmer with everything for a few more minutes.",
      "Once the veggies are just tender, stir in the artichokes and peas. Simmer about 5 more minutes and adjust salt to your taste, turn the pepper grinder over the pot a few times and it's done. I like to let this simmer on a little longer so that the flavours really blend together. Serve topped with olives and parsley if you choose, and maybe some crusty bread on the side."
