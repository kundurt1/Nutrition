When ready to bake, place in the oven unthawed and add 10-15 min to the baking time.\r\nAdditionally, this pie can be filled with apples (Almas Pite). Use about 5 large tart baking apples, shredded into a colander and allowed to drain (toss with a few teaspoons of lemon juice to prevent browning). Squeeze out the excess liquid, add 1/2 c sugar, 1 tsp cinnamon, and the lemon zest. No need to cook this filling as the apples have a great deal of pectin.

You want the sauce to be quite tart so it can cut through the pork and butter in the final dish, so don't be tempted to make it very sweet. Set aside or jar up if making ahead.",

Brown the meat and break up the lumps with a wooden spoon. Add the oregano, chilli and season very well with lots of ground pepper and salt. After a couple of minutes, stir in the tomato paste and add the white wine. After another minute, add the chicken stock. Cover the pan and cook for 10 minutes on a low heat.

With a rolling pin, work from the centre outwards, rotating the dough often. Roll until it's very thin (about 2.5mm). If it tears, repair with pasta from the outter edge and water. With a pasta machine, start with the widest setting and feed the dough through to make sheets. Repeat the process, decreasing the width by one stop each run until you end up with a long, almost translucent sheet of pasta. Repeat with each ball of dough. It's a lot easier to do this with someone than by yourself.",
      "Once rolled, cut into more manageable lengths. Place one sheet on to a floured surface. With the first sheet, lightly score into rough squares to mark the ravioli. We like them quite big, but others prefer smaller ravioli - it's a personal preference. Place a teaspoon or so of filling in the centre of each ravioli square. Depending how wide your sheets are, you may get two alongside, or three, or even four. Then add 1/2 teaspoon of applesauce to each filling too. Once each square is filled, brush the beaten egg along the scored lines around the filling.",

      "Set the ravioli aside on a parchment lined tray, ensuring the ravioli are well spaced out and not touching. Place in the freezer for 10 minutes or so.",
      "Meanwhile, chop the chestnuts and heat the butter on a low heat. Once the butter is hot, add the sage leaves and chestnuts and fry for a couple of minutes. Also get a saucepan of boiling salted water on the go. Once water is boiling add the ravioli to the water and cook until al dente - with fresh pasta it shouldn't take more than 5 minutes, more like 3.",

      "Put the diced squash and carrots in a big bowl. Drizzle with olive oil and season with the spices. I put much less in this soup than I would for a curried vegetable soup, to let the naturally subtle flavor of the butternut squash come out. I added just enough so I could lightly smell the spices. The cinnamon adds a beautiful semi-sweetness - I really suggest trying it. Cinnamon is used in a lot of Morrocon dishes with red meat (which is often cooked with pumpkin - so this is a very well-tested flavor profile!)",
      "Spread the carrot and squash onto a lightly oiled cookie sheet and roast at 450F for about 7-10 minutes, then turn over and roast the other side for the same amount. In about 20 minutes total, depending on how small you've cut the vegetables, they should be soft enough to smoothly poke a fork through.",
      "At this point, turn the broiler on and give the vegetables some color. This part is not necessary, but it adds another layer of flavor.",
      "While the vegetables are roasting, heat some olive oil in a pan and add the onions. (Just the onions!). For this soup, I caramelize them. Stir to combine the onions with the oil, then spread in a single layer. Cook over medium-low heat for about 5-10 minutes, then sprinkle with sugar (brown or white) and cook for about 20 minutes.",
      "After about 15 minutes, you can add the garlic too, since we'll need it for this soup. While we're caramelizing, might as well get some sweetness into the garlic as well! You'll see the onions start to get golden brown and very soft. Taste as you go and get them as dark as you want (or have time for - truly caramelized onions can cook for an hour or more.)",
      "Once the onions are sweet and caramelized, add the white beans to the pot. Also add the diced tomatoes. If you want the soup more tomato-flavored, use two cans. Let the beans and tomatoes simmer till the beans are tender, about 15 minutes.",
      "Add the roasted vegetables back into the pot. At this point, you've got a thick stew to eat over couscous, with some grilled steak. Stop here, if you like.",
      "Pour half or more of the vegetables into a blender. Add 1/2 quart of stock and blend until smooth. You can leave it half chunky, or blend it all completely smooth. Add more stock until it is the consistency you like it. I usually end up using the whole quart of stock.",
      "That's it! Roast veggies, cook onions, cook beans, puree. How easy is that?! I've even roasted the veggies the day before and just cooked the rest up the day of serving. If you dice the vegetables beforehand and keep them in the fridge, this soup can be on the table in 30 minutes. Freeze it in ziploc bags for a hot dinner on a cold day. When you reheat, you might need to add more stock, so have a little extra in the fridge (or you could use milk for something creamier)."

      "Poach the eggs: Bring a wide pot of water to a boil, reduce heat to a simmer, and poach the two whole eggs for about 3 minutes and 45 seconds, or as desired. Remove the eggs to a bowl of warm water and set aside.",
      "Beat the remaining egg white briefly with a fork. Beat the egg white briefly with a fork. Break up the leftover risotto with a spoon or fork and mix it with the egg white until well combined. The mixture should look wet but not runny, and a spoonful of rice should hold together.If the mixture seems too runny, you can add some grated Parmesan, breadcrumbs or even a little flour to help hold it together. If it's too dry and the rice won't stick together, beat the egg yolk and add it a little at a time until you get the right consistency.",
      "Heat the oil over medium to medium-high heat in a large cast iron or nonstick frying pan (I use a ceramic nonstick pan). When the oil is hot, use an ice cream scoop or a large spoon to carefully drop about 1/3- to 1/2-cup scoops of risotto into the pan. Press down gently to form the mounds of risotto into disks, and press any risotto clumps that fall off back into the sides of the cakes.",
      "Let the risotto cakes cook undisturbed until you can slide them around as complete units the pan (if the cake is breaking apart or clumps of rice are falling off when you slide it, it's not ready yet). When the cakes move easily and the bottoms are golden brown, carefully flip them over. Here's my method, which is a little bit like dealing with very small frittatas: Position a large spatula on one side of the cake. Place a second spatula on the opposite side of the cake and wiggle it underneath. Quickly flip the cake onto the first spatula, then use the second to slide it off back into the pan. Push any bits of rice that have fallen off into the sides of the cake.",
      "Continue to cook until the second side is golden brown and the cakes are cooked through. Season the outsides with salt and pepper (optional, but it adds another dimension of flavor to the crispy exterior). Divide cakes between two plates and top with poached eggs.",
      "Combine the oil, vinegar, mustard, honey, basil, and salt and pepper to taste in a jar and shake vigorously until combined.",
      "Divide the salad greens between the two plates holding the risotto cakes and eggs. Drizzle the dressing over everything."

Cut the butter into chunks, add it to the flour mixture, and (using a fork or a pastry cutter), cut it into the flour mixture until it is in pea-sized pieces. You really need to keep the butter in little bits -- this is what makes the flakes in the biscuit!",
      "Pour the milk into the bowl and, using a fork or spoon, stir the milk until it is incorporated. The dough is going to feel much too dry in some places -- that is okay. [OPTIONAL: You can also add in a beaten egg with the milk. I like biscuits both ways. It just makes them a little more buttery if you add the egg here.]",
      "Now, using clean hands, start folding together the dough in the mixing bowl. The goal here is to incorporate all the dry ingredients without overworking or overwarming the butter. Just keep folding it over itself a few times. The idea is to keep the little bits of butter distinct and not let it all melt together, so you need to have a very light touch. The more your dough has visible bits of butter, the better your biscuits (say that 3 times fast).",
      "Now turn the dough out onto a floured surface and fold it over on itself, pressing down gently to knead it together as you go. Once it is all well-mixed, roll it out into a disc about 2 inches high. Using a pastry cutter or some other metal round, punch out circles of dough (make them as big as you want!)",
      "Place the dough circles on an unlined baking sheet. Brush the tops lightly with a beaten egg (this is optional but it makes them prettier). Bake them for about 10-15 minutes...keep an eye on them after 10 minutes and pull them out as soon as they start to get golden brown."

Cook, stirring, just until cranberries begin to pop and release their juice, about 3 minutes. Drain cranberries in a sieve set over a bowl to catch the juice; you should have about 1 cup. Place cranberries in a small bowl, and stir in your reserved 1/2 cup of cranberries. Set aside.",
      "Return strained cranberry juice to a saucepan and add ginger and orange rind. Simmer liquid over medium-low heat until thickened and reduced to 1/4 cup, about 15 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool before removing the ginger and orange to impart more flavor. Using a fine-mesh strainer, pour syrup over cranberries. Discard solids.",
      "TO ASSEMBLE AND BAKE: Remove the dough from the refrigerator. Spread gingersnap crumbs on a clean work surface (I like using a sheet of parchment paper). Roll out dough on top of crumbs, coating both sides, into a large rectangle about 1/8-inch thick (or slightly thicker), about 16-inches long and 12-inches wide. Smooth out crumbs from time to time to distribute evenly; you may not need all of the crumbs. Transfer dough onto a large baking sheet. Spread about half of the apples and pears over the dough and top with about half of the cranberry-syrup mixture, leaving a 2 1/2-inch border around the edges, then repeat with remaining apples, pears, and cranberry-syrup mixture. Fold the edges of the dough over the filling, pleating it in the corners to hold in the filling. (If your dough is getting too warm at any point and is difficult to manage, return it to the refrigerator for 10 to 15 minutes, then proceed.)",
      "Bake for 40 to 45 minutes, until fruit is bubbling and the crust is golden. I like to check the galette after 25 minutes; spoon off any excess liquid, if needed. Cool for at least 30 minutes on wire rack. Serve warm or at room temperature."

When they're cooked, drain, and peel the chickpeas, if you wish. Alternatively, to cook the chickpeas per Yotam Ottolenghi's (genius) method found in the very excellent \"Jerusalem,\" add the drained chickpeas and 1 teaspoon of baking soda to a medium saucepan. Cook over high heat for about three minutes, stirring constantly. Add about 6 cups of water and bring to a boil. Cook, skimming off any foam or skins that float to the surface. This should take anywhere from 20 to 40 minutes, depending on the type and freshness of your chickpeas. Once done, they should be very tender and almost but not quite mushy. When cooked like this, the chickpeas are impossible to peel because they're so tender, so I usually do not bother peeling them.",
      "To prepare the roasted fennel: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Trim the stalks and greens from the fennel bulbs. Save the green fronds for garnish. If the outer thick leaves of the bulbs are fibrous and tough, remove them and set them aside for another use (soup?). Slice each bulb in half lengthwise and cut each half crosswise into 1/2? thick slices. If the stalks are not too fibrous, slice the stalks into 1/2? thick coins and add them to the mix. Spread the sliced fennel out on a large baking sheet in a single layer and add just enough olive oil so that it doesn't stick to the baking sheet. Sprinkle with the dried oregano and a little bit of sea salt and freshly ground black pepper. Roast for about 20 minutes or until the fennel is completely soft and lightly browned. Set aside to cool and try not to devour it.",
      "Once the fennel and chickpeas have cooled, place the vegetables in a food processor and process until you have a smooth paste. Add the tahini, garlic, and lemon juice. With the machine running, add water, one tablespoon at a time, until the mixture becomes creamy and smooth. Taste for seasoning, adding more salt or lemon juice, if needed.",

Make sure to take the hummus out of the fridge at least 30 minutes before serving. For optional garnish, drizzle with olive oil, and scatter reserved fennel fronds and dried fennel seeds on top.",
      "This makes a lot of hummus but hummus freezes very well. Throw 1-cup or 1/2-cup portions into small freezer bags or wrap up in little wax paper or Press'n'Seal packages. Left in the fridge, though, it should be consumed within a few days."

With the help of a plastic spatula, carefully lift edge and flip disc for a few seconds before turning out onto a plate. Repeat with second egg sheet.(Don't worry if they are a little wrinkled and not perfectly flat.)They can be stacked and can be made days in advance. * If you want a little more flavor in the egg sheet, you could add 1 Tablespoon of the celery braising liquid to the 2 whisked eggs.",

With wet hands, gently spread 1 cup sushi rice in a thin even layer over the sheet of nori, leaving the top 1/2 inch free of rice. Keep dipping your hands in water so rice won't stick to them. About 1/4- 1/3 of the way up the nori from the bottom, horizontally place two pieces of celery, end to end and cupped side up. Fill the 'trough' of the celery with tobiko or kanikama.Top the filling with 2 pieces of braised celery, cup side down, pushing down to join the top and bottom pieces of celery.

Bend back the mat and roll the maki forward with the mat back on top, squeezing as you go, til you reach the empty top strip of the nori. Wet this strip lightly with water and roll the maki over it, pressing firmly to secure the roll. Turn and squeeze the roll along its full length- four times .Continue making rolls.",

In place of the tobiko or kanikama fillings. you could use strips of firm pressed tofu or smoked tofu, or an egg sheet rolled up tightly, or sliced and braised shiitake mushrooms or..... Also, there are many maki rolling videos on the www. Try to find one with an Asian sushi chef. Once you are comfortable with the roling, you will have lots of fun ideas to try out!"

      "THE DAY BEFORE COOKING: If chicken is wet, pat it dry so spices adhere easily. Season thighs evenly on both sides with the kosher salt and pepper.",
      "Place chicken thighs into a gallon size Zipock bag (or a large dish or bowl), add the smashed garlic, thyme sprigs, and bay leaves. The benefit of the bag is that it uses up the smallest amount of space and is much easier to fit in the fridge. Also, you can easily rearrange the chicken in the bag so it gets evenly flavored by the garlic and herbs, without having to open up the dish and dirty up another utensil.",
      "Close bag, squeezing all the air out. Use your hand to mix ingredients slightly, so they are dispersed somewhat evenly. Place in fridge (I like to rest the bag on a small plate) for at least 12 hours or, preferably, overnight. If possible, at some point mix the chicken up slightly to move the garlic and herbs around.",
      "ON THE DAY OF COOKING: Preheat oven to 225\u00b0F if slow roasting. Otherwise, get your slow cooker out.",
      "Remove the chicken from the bag and place in a colander, reserving the aromatics. Rinse to get some of the salt off and pat dry very well.",
      "Place the thighs into a roasting pan large enough to hold all the chicken, but not so big you can't cover it with oil. Or place chicken into the slow cooker.",
      "Disperse all the aromatics you used when brining. Add rosemary, if using, and scatter the sliced onion over. Add a 50/50 mixture of olive oil and canola oil until the chicken is completely submerged. It has to be totally covered with the oil, or it will not cook evenly.",
      "Cover and roast in the oven for 6 to 8 hours. You can check the chicken at the 6 hour mark, it should be really tender. If using a slow cooker, cook on low for 3 hours, then increase heat and cook on high for another 2 hours.",
      "Let the chicken and pan come to room temperature. You can pull out some thighs right away if you want to use them immediately, or cover and place in the fridge. It might be easier to move the thighs to another bowl, just make sure they are always submerged in the oil and covered tightly. The chicken will keep for 5 or 6 days. Also, strain the oil and reserve to fry the chicken in it, or other foods like potatoes.",
      "When you want to use the chicken, just remove the desired amount and fry in the reserved oil, starting skin side down over medium heat. Let the skin get really golden before flipping, so it doesn't stick.",
      "Alternatively, shred the chicken and use in salads, on a pizza, tacos or pasta.",
      "Enjoy!"

Yes, 2 at least, 2 1/2 even better! One of the special points of this dish is that the long simmer gives such tenderness to the meat. Turkey wings are bigger, tougher and thicker than a chicken wing. Don't worry, they won't fall apart, but they WILL be just about fall-off-the-bone tender at 2 hours.",
      "Stir occasionally to make sure all the wings are cooked evenly. During the last half hour, add the chopped bell pepper, then put the lid back on and let it finish cooking. When done, take the wings out and place on a platter. Stir up all the bits from the bottom of the pan and mix with a little water if needed. Put the cornstarch in a cup with a cup of COLD water and stir with a whisk, then pour into the pan and keep stirring over low-medium heat until gravy thickens. Serve with rice, a nice steamed green veggie like cabbage with onions."

Once cooked, drain the potatoes and put them back in the pot. Cover the pot with a clean dish towel and then cover the towel with a pot lid. (If you don't have a lid that fits, use a cookie sheet.)

Spread as many eggplants as you can fit across a sheet of tinfoil. \r\nStep 2. \r\nWhen the eggplant feels soft on one side turn it over for several minutes.The skin of the eggplant should be soft enough that once it has cooled down you will be able to peel it right off. \r\nStep 3. After the eggplants have finished broiling set aside into a large bowl to cool off. Once it has cooled, peel of the skin of the eggplant and put it inside a large mixing bowl or Cuisinart. \r\nStep 4. Only use the Cuisinart for 2 or 3 turns. You do not want the eggplant to turn into a paste. Just enough to get it smooth without chunks. Add only a bit of eggplant to the Cuisinart at a time. \r\n\r\nYour eggplant is now ready. Place into a large mixing bowl and add 1 finely chopped red or green onion. Add 1-2 TBS of canola oil. Squeeze in 1/2 a lemon and add kosher salt and pepper to taste. \r\n\r\nNote* you do not need to add oil to the eggplant when it's broiling in the oven. Just place it on a sheet of tinfoil."

Pop them back in for another few minutes, then repeat the flattening process. Believe me, it's worth the extra effort, they look so cute!

Now, imagine that you're folding four edges of the circle towards the center, effectively creating a square. Do that. Then fold the 4 points of the square to the center. Your cheese should be completely enfolded in the dough. Carefully turn the dough over and use your hands to gather the edges into a ball again.",
      "Line a baking sheet with parchment. Set the dough on it and drape it with your piece of plastic. Let proof again until doubled, about 30 minutes.",
      "About one half hour into the proofing time, preheat oven to 375 degrees. If you use a baking stone, set it in the oven when you turn it on. Just before placing bread in oven, remove the plastic and slash it decoratively with a serrated knife held at an acute angle. Some of the cheese should bubble out dramatically while baking.",
      "If using a stone, simply lift the sheet of parchment with the bread on it and slide it onto the stone. Otherwise, set the baking sheet in the oven. Bake for 30 minutes, rotating bread 180 degrees at the halfway point.",

      "No mixer? No problem. Start with step 2 in a mixing bowl. Add the dry ingredients in step 3, and stir with a wooden spoon until you can't stir any longer. Turn dough out onto a floured surface, pat your hands in some flour, and knead until dough comes together, but still feels a bit soft and tacky. Add the nuts and sage and continue kneading until they're well incorporated. At this point, pick up with step 5 and continue the rest of the way through!"

      "Day Two, Evening",
      "Arrive home, open a beer. Relax. Take the dough out of the fridge and let it come to room temperature, about two hours. It should have grown a little, but don't worry if it doesn't look as if anything has happened.",
      "After two hours, pre-heat the oven to 500\u00b0. Take the dough and stretch and fold three or four times. If the video upload on this site would be working I'd show you how to do that, but it doesn't, so I can't. Take it up with the authorities.",
      "Put into a floured banneton (or brotform) for the last rise. After an hour, drop the dough into an earthenware cloche or on a pizza stone and bake for 40 - 45 minutes or until the bread has an internal temperature of 200\u00b0. Let rest for at least an hour and enjoy.",
      "When I first started exploring this formula, I started out with a mixture of 300 g bread flour, 200 g rye. The starter I feed whatever I have on hand, bread flour before it goes back to sleep in the fridge, rye if I need activity fast. Ever now and then, as a special treat, I throw in a handful of wholewheat flour, which is the yeast equivalent of feeding tequila to teenagers. I am pretty certain that sourdough purist will faint dead away at this laissez faire, laissez aller attitude but so far the yeast and bacteria population of my starter seems to be both enthusiastic and healthy. Which, in the end, is really all that counts.",
      "While we're ruminating on the subject, sourdough is one of these things that a fair number of people get far too mystical about, at least for my personal liking. Before the development of commercial yeast not that very long ago, naturally leavened bread was the only bread there was. Which means that great bread has been produced for millenia by people who a: thought the earth was flat and b: who's idea of personal hygiene was a bath at Christmas time, and then only if you really needed it.",
      "What I am saying is, don't sweat it. We're surrounded by everything we need to create leavening cultures. All we need to do is create the environment the little critters like to move into. A clean glass jar, clean to make sure the undesirables won't take hold before the yeasts move in, some, ideally, organic wholewheat flour and water, as well as a source of gentle acidity is all you need. The acid is ideally being supplied by fruit juice, with natural pineapple juice being, apparently, the best and most effective choice. Mix, stir, cover with cheese cloth and wait for a couple of days. Chances are that after a week or so you'll have your very own bread starter."

Pour in the ice water and mix for 10 to 15 seconds, or just until everything comes together in a shaggy and rough-looking dough. It will start out looking like crumbs and floury butter and turn into more of a rough and shaggy dough as you beat it.",

Using a rolling pin, roll the dough from left to right as well as you can into a rectangle about 18 by 8 inches (46 by 20 centimeter) and 1/2-inch (1-centimeter) thick. Flour the dough as needed to prevent the rolling pin from sticking. Don't worry if it seems really messy and not at all smooth. Just do your best to roll the square shape into a rectangle.",
      "Lightly score the rectangle into thirds with a bench scraper or knife. Each third should be roughly 6 inches (13 centimeters) wide and still 8 inches (20 centimeter) from top to bottom. Brush off any loose flour from the dough. Take the right third of the dough and, as best you can, flip it over onto the middle third. Then take the left third of the dough and, again as best you can, flip that third on top of the middle and right third. You should now have a messy pile of dough about 6 by 8 inches (13 by 20 centimeter) and about 2 inches (5 centimeters) thick. Turn the entire dough pile as best as you can 90 degrees clockwise so that now it is 8 inches (20 centimeters) side to side and 6 inches (13 centimeters) up and down. (This process-folding the dough in thirds and then rotating it 90 degrees-is called turning the dough.) The dough should still be rough looking and you'll see bits of butter throughout.",
      "When rolling out laminated dough like puff pastry, your goal is to keep the layers directly on top of one another and even, to preserve the layering. In between turns you have three layers of dough, one on top of another. Rather than immediately rolling these out with a back-and-forth motion, first flatten the dough with your rolling pin by firmly pressing down on the dough and then moving your rolling pin up and down and pounding along the length of the dough-use your rolling pin to create ridges as it compacts the dough. Once the dough is pressed down all over, then use the pin to roll back and forth, smoothing out the ridges while flattening and rolling the dough into the shape you want. By pressing down first before rolling, you preserve the layers. If you were to start rolling immediately after folding the dough, the very top layer would take all the pressure from the rolling pin and stretch out way over the very bottom layer. Using this technique to compress the dough first helps to keep the layers even, making for a flakier end product.",
      "Again, give the dough a turn by dividing it into thirds, flipping the right third into the middle, and then the left third on top of that (it's like folding a business letter), and then turning the entire piece of dough 90 degrees. Dust off any loose flour in between folds.",
      "Once again, roll this out into a rectangle about 18 by 8 inches (46 by 20 centimeters). This time the dough should be a little more cohesive, and you should find it a little easier to roll it out. Make sure your work surface and dough are well floured. Do your best to roll the dough into as even a rectangle as you can with sharp corners.",
      "Repeat this process twice more, for a total of four turns. By the time you get to the fourth turn, the dough should be completely cohesive and almost smooth. There may be small chunks of butter in it, but it should no longer be shaggy and difficult to work with.",
      "Place the dough on a baking sheet and cover it completely with plastic wrap, tucking the plastic under the dough as if you're tucking it into bed. Refrigerate for 1 to 2 hours.",
      "Remove the dough from the refrigerator and place it on a work surface with the long side of the rectangle close to you. Turn the dough as described (roll it out into a long rectangle, fold it in thirds, then rotate it 90 degrees) twice more. Flip the dough over occasionally during the rolling process to make sure the top and bottom layers are getting equal attention from the rolling pin. When you are finished, the dough will have gone through six turns total-four initially and then two more after resting in the refrigerator.",
      "The puff pastry dough is now finished but needs to rest before you can use it. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least\r\n1 hour or up to 2 days. Or store in the freezer, well wrapped in plastic wrap, for up to 1 month. Pull the dough out the night before you plan to use it and thaw in the refrigerator."

Add the lamb and allow to marinate overnight.",
      "Prepare your hazelnuts. If you can find \"pre-skinned\" hazelnuts you can probably skip this step, but the ones that I had still had the skins on them. To remove the skins, toast in a dry skillet, moving the nuts around frequently, for about 5 minutes, until you see dark spots developing and the skins start to crack. Remove from heat, and allow to cool. The skins should be easy to remove just by rubbing them. Place the nuts into a spice grinder or food processor, and chop finely. This can be done in advance to save time on cooking day.",
      "The next day, when you are ready to cook, heat your oven to 450. Heat the oil in a heavy skillet over medium high heat. If you have a skillet large enough to hold all of the chops at once that is also oven safe, all the better. If not, you will need to have a baking dish ready to accept the chops.",

      "Sprinkle a hazelnut crust on both sides of the chop (get some on the bone handle as well...) and pan sear each side of the chop for about 1 minute, to get a nice crust going. As I said, if your skillet is large enough to fit all of your chops then you can do this all at once and put the whole skillet into the oven. If not, transfer the seared chops to the baking dish.",
      "Cook the chops until they register an internal temperature of 130-135 degrees for rare, flipping once. They will cook a little more as you plate, so unless you like your lamb on the more well-done side (for shame!) pull them out. This will depend on your cooking method (a hot skillet going into the oven will cook them faster than a cold baking dish) but it will be about 10 minutes or so.",
      "Meanwhile, in another skillet, make the brussel sprout hash. Heat the oil over medium heat and add the pancetta. Cook for 2-3 minutes to brown, and add the garlic. Cook for another 2 minutes. Add the onions, cook for 2-3 minutes, and then add the brussel sprouts and cook for about 3-4 minutes. If you want your sprouts on the crunchier side, turn the heat down earlier.",
      "Season with salt and pepper, and add a good squeeze of lemon juice at the end. Sprinkle the fresh mint and about 1/2 T of lemon zest on just before serving, and toss to incorporate. Plate 2-3 lamb chops over the bed of brussel sprouts, and dinner is served!"

Most of the liquid should be gone and what is left should look like a soft gel. Stir in the liqueur and the crystallized ginger (more or less, to taste) and cook for another minute or so.",

      "Note: Crystallized and candied ginger are much easier to chop if you sprinkle a teaspoon or two of sugar on your work surface, and then another teaspoon on top of the ginger, before chopping. Add more as you chop, if necessary, to keep the ginger from sticking to the knife blade. ;o)",
      "Please also note that, if you plan to put this marmalade in sealed jars (which won't be refrigerated), the zest is mandatory, not optional. Apart from providing a lot of great flavor, the zest adds to the acidity of the marmalade, which is essential for safe preserving. ;o)"

      "Crepe batter: First, combine all the wet ingredients (eggs, milk, water, butter) for the crepes, and then stir in the flour and salt. You can do this by hand whisking or by pulsing for a few seconds in the food processor. If you are in a hurry you can make the crepes immediately. However, allowing the batter to rest covered in the refrigerator for an hour or so is recommended for easier crepe making. While the batter is resting, you can proceed with making the filling and the tomato sauce.",
      "Making the crepes: Heat a small flat pan, coat lightly with butter and place about 1/8 cup of crepe batter. Immediately, swirl the pan around so that a fairly thin 5-6-inch crepe forms. When the edges start curling up, and the crepe seems set in the center, flip the crepe over. Cook on the other side for a few seconds. Remove, and lay to cool. When cooled, you can stack the crepes and store in the refrigerator for a day or two if not using immediately.",
      "Making the mushroom filling: Heat the butter in a pan. First, saute the garlic for a few seconds. Next, add the onions and cook until the onions are soft. Add the chopped mushrooms and cook for a little while, until the mushrooms are tender but retain a plump shape and some snap. Sprinkle the flour on the mushrooms and stir. Add the milk and bring to a boil on medium heat, stirring occasionally. Add salt and some freshly ground pepper to taste. Remove from the heat when the mixture begins to thicken and starts to coat the sides of the pan. Note that the filling will thicken further upon cooling, but it shouldn't be too watery otherwise it will not hold well inside the crepes. Toss in the chopped parsley and keep aside until the mixture cools a little.",
      "Tomato sauce for topping: You can make your own tomato sauce or use your favorite mild marinara sauce for the topping. I like to blanch about 3 medium tomatoes for a few minutes in hot boiling water and then put them into cold water so that the skin of the tomatoes peels off. I puree the peeled tomatoes, and then cook them for a while in olive oil, with chopped garlic and a bay leaf or two. Add salt and a pinch of sugar to taste. This sauce can be made ahead of time.",
      "Finishing: Place a little mushroom filling inside a crepe and roll it up. Place in a large baking dish which has been lightly dabbed with tomato sauce on the bottom of the dish. Continue until all the crepes are filled. Top the crepes with smears of tomato sauce (not too much, as the sauce shouldn't overpower the delicate flavor of the crepes and mushrooms), sprinkle the cheese generously over the top along with the chopped parsley, and bake in a 350F oven for about 10-15 minutes until the cheese has melted. Serve hot."

You'll know it's carbonated when the bottle feels rock-solid.",

You may even have to twist a little bit, wait a minute, twist a little more, wait a minute, and so on, until you're in the clear to remove the cap completely.

If left out at room temperature, more carbon dioxide will be produced, and you definitely do not want the bottle to explode when you open it. Yeast is a powerful thing, people. I can attest to this.\r\n\r\nIt went a little something like this: I strained the soda into a glass bottle, apparently under the impression that I'm some kind of magician (I'm not) who can magically catch every little bit of yeast in the soda. (I didn't.) And so without thinking, I made the mistake of leaving the bottle out on the kitchen table for a few days. I went to open it last night, just to be matched with a force that can only be compared to a broken, spewing fire hydrant. I was covered, as was the wall, the floor, the clean dishes that were still in the dish rack from last week, and pretty much anything else within a two foot radius. \r\n\r\nThis ginger ale should keep in the refrigerator for at least a week without going flat. I have a couple of batches in the back of my fridge that I've only opened a few times since I made them two weeks ago, and they're still fully carbonated."

Scrape into the greased cake pan (I do not believe in dividing 2 layer cakes between 2 pans, I think they have much better texture if you bake it all in one thick layer and then cut it in half horizontally. It gives a much better surface texture in the middle for interfacing with frosting.).",

Loosen edges with a knife and invert onto a plate, then place a serving platter over the cake and holding the cake between the plate and the serving platter, flip it again so that it is right side up on the serving dish. Or if you are using a springform pan, just remove the outside. If desired (which, of course it is), allow to cool completely then frost with your favorite recipe of cream cheese frosting. I usually cut the cake in half and spread the frosting in a layer on the bottom half, then put the top half back on, but leave that unfrosted and sprinkle it with powdered sugar to decorate before serving. You could also just frost the top (and if you made a bundt, that's kind of the only surface available for frosting). I don't think it needs frosting on more than one layer though, unless you feel like popping from sheer richness.",

Arrange the fruit in one layer in a cast-iron skillet or other deep-sided baking dish.",

Incorporate the butter into the flour mixture with a fork (I find smooshing some of the bigger pieces of butter against the side of the bowl helps separate it into flaky pieces). Finally, add the buttermilk and briefly stir until just incorporated (don't overmix; the dough will be sticky).",
      "Use a spoon to portion the biscuit dough over the prepared fruit. Organizing this is easier if you start with a ring of biscuits around the outside of the skillet, finishing with the biscuits on the interior portion of the cobbler. Bake in the oven until the biscuits are browned on top and the fruit is bubbly, about 35 minutes, rotating the skillet halfway through. Allow to cool slightly before serving (the fruit filling will be quite hot)."

      "Cut the potatoes in half, without peeling them, and put them in a pot. Pour in enough cold water to cover them by about 1 inch, then bring the water to a boil and cook the potatoes until very tender, about 10 minutes. Turn off the heat, then let the potatoes sit in their cooking water until cooled. Reserving the water, remove the potato halves with a slotted spoon. Peel the halves with your fingers or with a small paring knife, and discard the peels. Transfer the potatoes to a large bowl if kneading by hand, or to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook. Mash the potatoes using a potato masher or a fork. You should have roughly 1 1/2 cups.",
      "Proof the yeast in 1/4 cup warm water (no hotter than 110\u00b0 F) with the sugar for 5 to 10 minutes.",
      "Pour the cooled cooking liquid from the potatoes into a liquid measure, then add enough milk to measure 3/4 cup total. You should have a ratio of roughly 1/2 cup potato water to 1/4 cup milk. Pour the milk/potato water mixture into the bowl of mashed potatoes. Add the honey and the olive oil. Mix well to blend.",
      "If kneading by hand: Add the yeast mixture and 3 cups bread flour to the potato mixture. Using a sturdy wooden spoon, stir to bring the dough together. Add the salt and continue to work the dough until all the ingredients are well incorporated. Cover the bowl with a tea towel and let sit for 20 to 30 minutes. If using a stand mixer with a dough hook: Add the yeast mixture into the bowl. Add 2 cups bread flour and run the mixer for 1 to 2 minutes with dough hook, scraping down the sides as you go. Add the salt and and 1 cup additional bread flour. Run the dough hook to incorporate. Cover the bowl with a tea towel and let sit for 20 to 30 minutes.",
      "Once the dough has finished resting, begin to knead it. If using a stand mixer, add the flax seeds all at once. If kneading by hand, flour your work surface generously, then add only as much flour as necessary to keep the dough from sticking to your hands. Add the flax seeds a few tablespoons at a time while you knead. Knead the bread for about 10 minutes, until stretchy and supple.",
      "After 10 to 12 minutes, determine whether your dough is smooth and elastic using a windowpane test. If it's not, keep kneading for 5 more minutes, or as needed.",
      "Wash and dry your bowl. Put about 1 teaspoon olive oil in the bottom, and place the dough in. Turn to coat.",
      "Cover the bowl with a damp tea towel and set in a relatively warm, draft-free place to rise for 1 hour 30 minutes. *See note about rising below.",
      "Punch the dough down gently, knead it a few times, and shape it into a loaf. Preheat the oven to 325\u00b0 F for a convection oven, or 350\u00b0 F for a regular oven. If using a pizza stone, put the stone on a shelf in the bottom third of the oven at the same time that you turn the heat on.",
      "This recipe works well either as a free-standing oval on a pizza stone, in a clay pot, or in a loaf pan. If using a clay pot: Fill the lower half up about 3/4-full with water, then turn the lid over and fill it with water as well. Place both the water-filled lid and base in the oven while the dough rises. Shape the dough and let it rise in a parchment-lined loaf pan approximately the same size as the clay baking pan. Once the clay pot is warm, remove it from the oven and empty it, but leave the water-filled lid in the oven while baking. Make a sling with the parchment paper to transfer the dough into the clay pot, with the parchment paper still attached. If using a conventional loaf pan: Lightly oil the pan with olive oil, gently shape the dough into an oval, and place it inside of the pan with the parchment paper. If using a pizza stone: Shape the dough into an oval on the parchment paper. Slide a baking sheet under the parchment.",
      "Regardless of the baking method, use the sides of your hands to stretch the dough down from the top to create surface tension over the top of the loaf. Cover with a tea towel and allow the dough to rise again for 30 to 40 minutes.",
      "Using a bread knife or bakers' lame, cut one deep, long slit lengthwise or several shallow diagonal slits across the loaf. Brush the top of the loaf generously with olive oil. This gives the bread a beautiful, fragrant crust.",
      "Place the loaf in the oven to bake for 50 minutes, or until the bottom sounds hollow when tapped. Checking it after about 25 minutes: Convection ovens can often make the crust a bit dark, especially loaves made with milk, so if the crust is looking too brown after 25 or 30 minutes, cover it very lightly with a piece of foil.",
      "When it's done, remove the bread from the parchment and it let cool on a rack for at least 1 hour, preferably 3 or 4 hours.",
      "*A note about rising: Your bread dough won't rise easily if it's cold or subjected to drafts. My favorite place for protecting it from both is in my microwave. To create an ideal rising environment in your microwave: Put a small cup of water in your microwave, and turn it on high for 2 minutes. Remove the cup and put your covered bowl of dough in there and shut the door. This is only practical if you don't expect there to be much activity with the microwave for the hour or so that the bread will rise. Or, you can warm up your regular oven to no more than 120\u00b0 F (turning it off as soon as it is finished preheating so it doesn't get any hotter), leave the door open just a crack for a minute or so, then pop your bread bowl in there, covered lightly with a tea towel, with the door closed."

      "A brief word of advice: To get the most bay flavor into the berries, it's a good idea to make the sauce and let the berries sit for at least several hours. (Overnight may be too much, however, if your bay leaves are very fresh.) I've had great success with Jeni Britton Bauer's recipe when making the base and letting it chill in the back of my fridge overnight - not bothering with the bowl of ice water -- and then churning it in the morning. I leave the sauce at room temperature until an hour or so before I plan to swirl it into the ice cream, then I put it into the fridge (even the freezer for 10 -15 minutes) to chill.",
      "Measure into a small bowl the 2/3 cup of white sugar. Lightly score the vanilla bean with the tip of a sharp small knife and scrape out the tiny seeds, into the sugar. Rub the seeds into the sugar, taking care not to leave any on your fingers.",
      "In a small bowl, make a slurry by combining 2 tablespoons of the milk with the cornstarch. Stir it well.",
      "Put the scraped vanilla bean in a medium heavy saucepan with the remaining milk. Tear the edges of 2 of the bay leaves in five or six places each (to release more flavor) and add them to the same pan with the pinch of nutmeg. Over medium heat, bring the milk just to scalding. Turn off the heat and let the infused milk sit for at least 1/2 hour.",
      "Put a small metal bowl in the freezer to chill. In a small but heavy saucepan, cook the blueberries with the remaining 2 bay leaves (also torn on the edges), cinnamon stick and brown sugar over medium heat. When the berries start to sizzle just a bit - some will seem about to explode - use a potato masher to crush them. This will release the juices quickly. Keep smashing as you continue to cook the berries, stirring occasionally, until you have crushed most of them. Turn the heat down to medium low and simmer, stirring frequently so they don't scorch, for 10 - 15 minutes, until you have a fragrant, slightly jammy-looking, rough sauce. Immediately remove the cinnamon stick. (If you don't, its flavor will overpower the bay leaf.) Pour the sauce into the chilled bowl and set it aside. Stir it occasionally to help it cool down.",
      "Proceed with Jeni's basic recipe (which I've transcribed below), using the infused milk, and leaving the bay leaves and vanilla bean in as you boil the milk, cream, sugar and corn syrup. Follow the next steps, adding the slurry and then mixing the milk and cream in with the cream cheese (see my note below, please) and chilling in a zippered plastic bag. I leave the vanilla bean and bay leaves in the base while chilling it. (Make sure to remove the bay leaves and vanilla bean before churning. Rinse and save the vanilla bean for another use, e.g., making vanilla-scented sugar.)",
      "Churn in your machine according to the manufacturer's instructions. Before putting the ice cream into your freezer container to harden, remove the bay leaves from the blueberry sauce, and smear about 1/3 of the blueberry sauce on the bottom of the container; add half of the ice cream, followed by another third of the blueberry sauce. Then gently spoon on the remaining ice cream and on top of that, the last of the sauce, swirling just a bit.",

      "To make Jeni's (Truly Splendid) Ice Cream Base, which I quote directly from Jeni Britton Bauer's post on FOOD52:\r\n \r\n\"24 hours before you want to make the ice cream, wash the canister, dry it well, and place it in the coldest part of the freezer. Do not remove it until you are ready to pour the chilled cream into it.\r\n\r\nPREP THREE BOWLS:\r\nIn a small bowl, mix about 2 tablespoons of milk with the cornstarch to make a slurry. In a medium bowl, add the salt and room-temperature cream cheese and whip all the bumps out. In a large bowl, make an ice bath (heavy on the ice) and set aside.\r\n\r\nCOOK:\r\nPour the milk, cream, sugar, and corn syrup into a saucepan. Bring to a boil and set a timer for precisely 4 minutes-the timing is critical. Turn off the heat and add the cornstarch slurry to the ice cream base in the pan.\r\n\r\nCHILL:\r\nIncorporate the hot cream mixture into the cream cheese. Do this a little bit at a time so that you can whip out any lumps of cream cheese. [AJ's comment: Please see my note below. If you don't have an immersion blender, put the cream cheese in a bowl with a broad, flat bottom; use a dinner fork to start, and add only a couple of tablespoons of the cream mixture, and pressing down with the tines hard as you pull it across the bottom of the bowl. This gets the lumps out really nicely, as you create a smooth sauce with the fork.] Pour the hot ice cream base into a Ziploc bag and seal. Submerge in the ice bath until very cold. [AJ's note: Or, you can put it into a regular storage container and put it in the back of your refrigerator for the afternoon or overnight, as I do when I have the time.]\r\n\r\nFREEZE:\r\nCut the corner off the bag, pour the chilled base into the ice cream machine, and turn on the machine. When finished, transfer to a storage container and freeze until firm, about 4 hours.\r\n\r\nHOW TO TELL WHEN YOUR ICE CREAM IS DONE:\r\nThe ice cream is finished at the exact moment when the machine isn't freezing the ice cream anymore; the ice cream will begin to pull away from the sides (about 25 minutes). If you stop too soon, there will be a thin layer of really dense ice cream on the sides of the canister.\"",
      "Here are a couple of tips I learned while working in an ice cream parlor as a teenager. You get the nicest looking scoop if you scrape the ice cream across the top of the container and then roll it into a ball with the scoop. For that reason, I always store the ice cream I make in a wide, shallow container. Also, make sure to dip your scoop into cold water between rolls and while shaping and packing the ice cream into the scoop itself. And of course, always serve it with a smile! ;o)",
      "N.B. I use freshly picked blueberries from my own bushes for this. I've found that the fresh blueberries available commercially -- even in the farmers' markets -- are not nearly as flavorful as our blueberries. If you don't have intensely flavored fresh blueberries, consider using frozen wild blueberries instead. I bought some once, just to compare, and based on that, I think they'd work well. Use about 8 ounces of the frozen ones for this recipe, and add a teaspoon or two of lemon juice if their flavor isn't just a bit tart. ;o)",
      "After using Jeni's recipe for several different batches, I've concluded that the easiest way to incorporate the cream cheese into the milk and cream without any lumps is not to bother putting the cream cheese into a bowl. I drop it into the bottom of the plastic vessel that came with my immersion blender, along with the salt. Then I pour about 1/2 cup of the hot milk and cream on top of that, let it sit for a few seconds, and blend for about 10 or 12 pulses. Swirl it around to confirm that it's nice and smooth; buzz it for a few more seconds, if it's not. Then pour it back into the saucepan in which you boiled the milk, and give it a good stir. ;o)"

      "Start by making a corn broth: Cut kernels from 4 ears of fresh corn. You should have about 3 cups, maybe a little more. Set aside one third for the garnish, and reserve the other two thirds for the soup. Put the corn for the soup in a bowl and, working over it, scrape the cobs with the back of your knife to extract the sweet corn \"milk.\" Set the bowl aside. Break the scraped cobs up into pieces that will fit comfortably in a saucepan and pour the vegetable broth over. Pluck enough leaves and soft stems from the cilantro to make about 1/2 cup finely chopped. Set aside 2 tbsp for the garnish, and the rest for the soup. Take a handful of the cilantro stems and toss them in with the corn cobs and vegetable broth. Simmer slowly, covered, on a back burner over low heat while you do the rest of your prep.",
      "Next, make the crab, corn, and pepper garnish: In a medium skillet (a 10-incher is good) over medium heat, warm 1 tbsp coconut or olive oil (or butter). Add the 1/3 of the corn kernels you reserved for the garnish, along with the green onions, the bell pepper, half the minced jalapeno, and your reserved 1/2 cup of finely diced zucchini. Saute 5 minutes or until lightly browned and the corn is tender, but not mushy. Remove from heat and season with salt. Let cool slightly, then gently fold in crab meat and cilantro. Adjust for seasoning and set aside until ready to serve.",
      "Now make the soup: Melt butter or coconut oil in a large soup pot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add onions and saute until tender and translucent and beginning to brown, 5-10 minutes. Add potatoes and cook for a minute or so. Add the remaining corn kernels (and accumulated corn milk), the remaining jalapeno, zucchini, ginger, curry powder, and a good pinch of salt. Stir well and cook for another minute or so, then strain your corn-and-cilantro-infused vegetable broth into the pot. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer until potatoes are tender, 15 minutes or so. Stir in coconut milk, the juice of half a lime, the mint, and the remaining cilantro (retain a few pinches for additional garnish). Remove the pot from heat and let cool.",
      "Puree in batches in a blender or food processor, or directly in the pan using an immersion blender. Put pureed soup through a fine-mesh sieve to remove any stray solids (such as corn or zucchini skins) and ensure a velvety-smooth consistency. Add a little water or additional broth if soup is too thick. Adjust for lime juice and salt. Cool to room temperature, then chill in refrigerator several hours before serving, but preferably overnight, as this is definitely better the next day. (Taste again for salt once the soup is properly chilled--cold soups often need more salt than warm ones.) When ready to serve, ladle soup into shallow bowls and garnish each with a heaping spoonful of the crab, corn, and pepper mixture. Scatter additional cilantro and mint over and serve."

Once all the batter is piped onto both pans, grab one pan at a time and while holding the sides firmly, smack it down hard on a table top or counter surface from a few inches above. This will pop any remaining air bubbles and allow the cookies to settle and flatten. Let the pans sit for 30 minutes to allow the cookie surface to dry slightly.",
      "For the ganache: In a microwave-safe bowl, heat the white chocolate and butter in short 15 second bursts, stirring in between, until melted and just warm. Stir until smooth.Transfer to a tall container that will easily fit an immersion blender/stick blender.",
      "Heat the corn syrup in a small dish for 15 seconds. Pour into a tall container and stir in the warm corn syrup. Mix the chocolate/corn syrup mixture on high with an immersion blender until the mixture is smooth. Stream in the cold heavy cream slowly, and continue to blend on high speed. The mixture should become smooth and shiny.\r\n\r\nPour the chocolate mixture into a bowl and add the pumpkin puree, salt and cinnamon (and food color, if using). Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let the ganache chill until set.",
      "To finish the cookies: Once the macarons have rested for 30 minutes, put both pans onto separate shelves in the preheated oven and cook for 9-10 minutes. Swap the pans to their opposite shelf and allow to bake for 9-10 minutes more. The cookies are done when you touch the surface lightly and the cookie doesn't wobble from side to side. If the cookies are still too soft and wobbly, continue baking for 3-5 minutes more. Allow the cookies to cool for a few minutes, and peel gently from the parchment paper while still slightly warm. Let cool completely before decorating.",
      "Pair up the cookies with ones that are like in size. Put half the cookies flat-side up on a sheet pan, and the other half with their rounded sides up on another sheet pan. Using the black food color pen, draw creepy jack-o-lantern faces on the cookies.",
      "Grab the chilled ganache, microwaving briefly just to make it a slightly less firm texture. Transfer the ganache to a piping bag (or a gallon sized zip top bag with a tiny piece of one bottom corner cut off) and pipe about a 1 teaspoon mound onto the flat-side up cookies. Sandwich them with their like-sized pairs that have been decorated.\r\n\r\nAllow the cookies to sit in an airtight container at room temperature for at least 12 hours, to let the cookies properly soften before eating."

Over medium heat, toast the spices for several minutes, shaking or stirring, until fragrant. Add the ginger and onion. Stir until aromatic, 45 to 60 seconds. A tinge of brown is okay.",
      "Add 4 cups (1 L) of the cold water to arrest the cooking process. Add the apple, celery, carrot, cabbage, cilantro, salt, and the remaining 3 cups (720 ml) cold water. Lock the lid in place. Bring to high pressure (15 psi) over high heat on a gas or induction stove, or medium heat on an electric stove. Adjust the heat to maintain pressure, signaled by a gentle, steady flow of steam coming out of the cooker's valve. Cook for 15 minutes, or slightly longer if your cooker's high setting is less than 15 psi.",
      "Meanwhile, in a small liquid measuring cup, combine the nutritional yeast with the hot water. Let sit about 10 minutes, until separated into two layers. Carefully pour the yellow liquid into a bowl and set aside. Discard the khaki sludge.",
      "When the broth is done, slide the cooker to a cool burner and allow the pressure to decrease naturally, about 20 minutes. Remove the lid, tilting it away from you for safety. Let rest for 5 minutes, then strain through a muslin-lined mesh strainer positioned over a pot (see page 28 for guidance); briefly cool, then twist and press the muslin to yield more broth. Discard the solids. You should have about 8 cups (2 l) total.",
      "To use right away, season the broth with the nutritional yeast liquid, sugar (or maple syrup), and up to 1/2 teaspoon extra salt. Aim for a savory-sweet, somewhat chicken-like flavor; warming the proteins in the broth later on will add depth, so go light on the saltiness here. (If cooking in advance, partially cover the unseasoned broth, let cool, then refrigerate for up to 3 days or freeze for up to 3 months. Prep the nutritional yeast and season the broth before using.)",
      "Notes: To make the broth without a pressure cooker, use a 6- to 8-quart (6 to 8 l)stockpot. Ready the same set of broth ingredients but increase the water to 9 cups (2.25 l) total. Toast the spices, saute the aromatics, then add the water, produce, and salt. Partially cover and bring to a boil. Lower the heat to a simmer and cook, uncovered, for 1 hour to yield a golden-hued broth. Strain and season with the nutritional yeast liquid, sugar (or maple syrup), and salt. Prep and bowl assembly is the same as above.",

      "Cook over medium heat until sizzling, seared, and dry looking, about 5 minutes. There will be little moisture visible in the skillet. Drizzle the oil over the tofu, then use a spatula to flip the pieces.",
      "Let cook for 4 to 5 minutes to sear and brown the second side. Shake the skillet to check if the tofu will dislodge from the bottom. When there is a little movement, use a spatula to flip the tofu over to add extra color and character to the first side, if needed. Aim for a rich, mottled brown surface with dark brown edges. When satisfied, transfer to a rack to cool and dry for about 5 minutes before using. Notes The tofu can be refrigerated for up to 5 days. Let warm up to room temperature before using. Gently refry to return a bit of crispness to the tofu, if you like.",

When the noodles are soft, 5 to 60 seconds, pull the strainer from the pot, shake it to release excess water, then empty the noodles into a bowl. Top each bowl with the tofu. Crown with onion, green onion, and cilantro. Sprinkle on some pepper.",

Rather than give exact amounts here, it is better to go by how it looks: you want the chicken breasts to be nicely coated, but not overwhelmed. Add cayenne if you want some heat. Drizzle some olive oil over each chicken breast and put them in the oven. Roast until the internal temperature reaches 165 degrees, roughly 20-25 minutes, flipping them once.",

Once the caramel reaches 260*F immediately submerge the bottom of the pan into the bowl of ice water to cease the cooking of the caramel. Stir to cool evenly.",

      "Let excess caramel fall off the fruit then coat the bottom of the dipped fruit in the chopped hazelnuts. Place finished fruit on a parchment lined sheet tray and then into the refrigerator until caramel is firm, about 15 minutes.",
      "*Tips for Success*\r\n- If using pears use ones that are firm to prevent the popsicle stick from sliding out.\r\n- Wait to dip the fruit until the caramel is cool. It will be quite thick and sticky but it helps to prevent the caramel from sliding right off.\r\n- Use fruit that is not waxed.\r\n- Chill the fruit before dipping. This sets the caramel immediately. You could also dip then refrigerate.\r\n- Let the excess caramel drip off for at least one minute before dipping into the nuts.\r\n- Because this is a honey based caramel there will be some dripping and sliding off of the caramel. I forgive the caramel for doing this because it has such an incredible flavor but if this will be an issue for you you may want to stick to a recipe that uses granulated sugar.\r\n- Using a candy thermometer is important in this recipe as you will want to reach the proper temperature to ensure the caramel will set firm, but not too firm, when cool. If you don't have a thermometer boil the caramel for at least 20 minutes then watch for these visual clues: The finished caramel will be deep golden in color, the bubbles will be small and covering the entire surface of the caramel and the viscosity will be much thicker than when you started, resembling caramel sauce. You can also test the caramels density by placing a small amount in a bowl of ice water. The cooled caramel should feel like caramel candy - slightly firm with a good bit of chew."

      "PREP THE PANCAKE BATTER: \r\nIn a large mixing bowl, stir the dry ingredients together: the flour, baking soda, ginger, cinnamon, cloves, and salt. In another mixing bowl, blend the wet ingredients together: the apple juice concentrate, water, melted butter, and eggs. Mix them until they are combined. Now, gently combine the wet ingredients with the dry. Using a wooden spoon, stir just until everything is moist and there are no powdery pockets in the batter.",
      "COOK: Heat a large heavy griddle over MEDIUM HIGH heat. Keep the butter nearby and don't be afraid to use it! Melt about 1/2 Tbsp of butter or enough to generously coat the pan or griddle. (These pancakes tend to stick, see note below). Working in batches, pour 1/4 - 1/3 cup of the batter at a time onto the hot griddle. Space the pancakes so that they cook without running into each other. When bubbles appear, lift up a corner to make sure that the bottom is golden brown. If it is ready, flip it and cook the other side until golden brown. As they are done, stack the pancakes on a plate with a little butter on top of each one.\r\nWARNING: Flipping these pancakes is tricky. They stick to the pan. You will either need to use a huge spatula or 2 regular-sized ones to be successful. These don't flip like regular pancakes. You'll need to make sure every square inch of the pancake is off of the griddle before flipping. Once you get the hang of it, this is easy. If your first one gets messed up, use more butter next time.",

      "Preparing chestnuts for cooking whole: Like many a treat, they do require time, especially when you want them to remain whole. You must strip off the shiny brown outer shell, then peel, poke, and scrape off the thin brownish covering skin. To remove the shells and inner skin, cut a strip of shell off the outside curve of each chestnut. Cover with cold water in a saucepan and boil 1 minute. Set the pan aside. Remove 3 chestnuts from the hot water and strip off the outer shills. Peel and scrape off the covering brown skin. Some nuts will refuse to peel; heat and try again.",
      "Place the chestnuts in a saucepan with the bay leaf, onion, celery, and enough stock to cover them by 1/2 inch. Season lightly to taste and bring to a simmer. Cover partially and simmer slowly-watch that the liquid does not boil and disintegrate the chestnuts. This will take about 40 minutes, or until the chestnuts are tender but hold their shape.",
