Combine flour and baking powder; sprinkle over egg yolk mixture and gently fold in just until combined. In another bowl, beat egg whites on medium until soft peaks form. Gradually add remaining sugar; beat until stiff peaks form. Gently fold in egg yolk mixture. Line a greased 15x10x1-in. baking pan with waxed paper; grease and flour the paper. Spread batter evenly into pan; sprinkle with jimmies. Bake at 375\u00b0 for 12-15 minutes or until cake springs back when lightly touched. Invert onto a linen towel dusted with confectioners' sugar. Peel off paper and roll up cake in towel, starting with the long end. Place seam side down on a wire rack; cool completely. Unroll cake; spread jelly to within 1 in. of edges. Roll up cake without the towel. Cut cake roll into three longs measuring 3 in., 5 in. and 7 in. Stand cakes vertically on a serving plate. Combine the first four icing ingredients; mix well. Divide icing into thirds; color a third blue and another third red. Spread white icing on top of 3-in. cake, blue on 5-in. cake and red on 7-in. cake, allowing icing to run down side. Insert a candle in the top of each."
