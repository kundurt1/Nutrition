Spoon shaved chocolate in a 2-inch band around edge of filling. Garnish with peanut halves. Freeze at least 1 hour or until firm."

If you plan to cook your pizza on a baking sheet, just place a rack in the middle of the oven (you do not need to preheat the baking sheet). Preheat the oven to 500\u00b0F (or the highest temperature your oven will allow, if using a pizza stone/steel) and let it heat up for at least 30 minutes while you make the dough and/or prepare the toppings. 2. To prep the toppings: Bring a large pot of water to a boil and blanch the broccoli rabe for 2 to 3 minutes. Immediately drain it in a colander and run it under cold running water to stop the cooking. Spread the cooled broccoli rabe on a clean kitchen towel and pat dry. 3. In a food processor, combine the ramps, nuts, lemon juice, and salt. Pulse until the mixture is finely chopped, then, with the motor running, stream in the olive oil and process until smooth. Taste and add more salt or lemon juice as desired. 4. To stretch/roll out the dough: Place the dough on a clean work surface and, using your hands, gently stretch it into a 12-inch square or disk, making sure that it retains the same thickness throughout (more or less). If you want a thinner-crust pizza, dust the dough with flour and roll it out with a rolling pin. 5. If you're using a pizza stone or steel: Dust a pizza peel or the back of a baking sheet generously with flour or cornmeal. Place the dough disk on the prepared peel. 6. If you're using a baking sheet: Spray the baking sheet with cooking spray. Place the dough disk on the prepared baking sheet. 7. To top the pizza: Spoon 1/2 to 2/3 cup pesto onto the dough and spread it out evenly, leaving a 1/2-inch border of dough all around. Arrange the broccoli rabe on top of the pesto in whatever pattern you like, then sprinkle on the cheese. 8. To bake the pizza: If you're using a pizza stone or steel, 10 minutes before you are ready to cook the pizza, increase the oven heat to broil. Slide the pizza from the peel (or inverted baking sheet) to the hot stone or steel using quick shimmying movements. Broil the pizza for 6 to 8 minutes until the crust is golden and the cheese just begins to brown. Using the peel or inverted baking sheet, transfer the cooked pizza to a cutting board. If you are making more than one pizza, allow the pizza stone or steel to reheat under the broiler for 5 minutes before you cook the next one. 9. If you're using a baking sheet, do not increase the oven to broil. Place the baking sheet on the rack in the middle of the oven and bake for about 10 minutes, until the crust is golden and the cheese just begins to brown. 10. Remove the pizza from the oven and immediately arrange the cured meat on top. Let it rest for 5 minutes (the cured meat will melt on the hot pizza); slice and serve."

Lightly dust a work surface with flour and place the pasta sheet on it. Using a star-shaped plunger cutter in any size you prefer, make star cutouts all over the sheet of pasta. I recommend spacing the star cutouts as close together as possible, because the sheet will get re-rolled and the stars will expand (doesn't stars expanding blow your mind?). Cover this sheet with a kitchen towel. If you wish, save the tiny cutout stars to make pastina.",

Alternating the sides of the sheet you put through the pasta machine will ensure that the stars don't skew too much in one direction. Keep reducing the rollers until you've rolled the pasta sheet through the middle thickness on the pasta machine. Your stars will look wide! Don't worry; we're about to fix that.",
      "Lay the pasta sheet flat on your work surface and cut the whole sheet crosswise in 5-inch widths (or wider, up to the width of your pasta machine rollers). The star pattern has so far been skewed only side to side, making really wide stars, so now we'll run the 5-inch sheets crosswise through the pasta machine, to stretch the stars back toward symmetry.",
      "Feed the 5-inch widths of pasta through the pasta machine crosswise this time, perpendicular to the direction you had been feeding them through initially.

Heating the oil can also be done over the edge of the cooker top so that it is done as gently as possible. When the oil is warm, place the separated, unpeeled garlic cloves in the oil and poach them gently for approximately 2 hours. They should be tender, easy to peel and thoroughly impregnated with oil. When ready, drain the oil, peel the garlic cloves, crush them, then pass them through a chinois and set aside.",
      "Place the kaolin, lactose, black dye and salt in a bowl and mix together, gradually adding the water. The mixture may seem too dry at first, but if left for an hour or so will liquefy and develop a yogurt-like texture suitable for coating the boiled potatoes, thick but not runny.",
      "Gently clean the potatoes with a soft brush. Do not peel. Bring the salted water to a boil in a large saucepan, then add the potatoes. Boil for 15-20 minutes, depending on the size of the potatoes, without overcooking them. Drain them and place on a baking sheet.",
      "Pierce the flattest side of each potato with the tip of a skewer. Remove the skewer and insert its blunt end in the same hole until it reaches roughly the centre of the potato. Stir the kaolin mixture until thoroughly combined and of the correct consistency. Dip the potatoes into the mixture, completely covering them. Insert the ends of the skewers into the holes of a perforated baking sheet so that they are held in a vertical position. Place the sheet in a stove or oven at a low temperature-50\u00b0C (120\u00b0F)-for approximately 30 minutes or until the coating has dried out to a crisp texture. This will contrast with the smoothness of the potato inside, which will be tender and creamy thanks to the protection of this 'shell'.",

The stones will add the finishing touch to the presentation and keep the potatoes hot for longer. Serve the potatoes in between the stones. Serve a heaped portion of alioli in smaller, individual dishes. The potatoes should be eaten with the fingers and the first bite should be taken without the sauce. This will accentuate the difference in the texture between the coating and its content. After that, the potatoes should be dipped into the alioli."
