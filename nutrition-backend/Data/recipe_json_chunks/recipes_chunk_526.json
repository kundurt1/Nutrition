Shape dough into a long, thin cylinder and with a floured knife cut off pieces of about 2/3-inch. Roll with hands on an unfloured board into a long, thin oval shape. Melt butter and let cool slightly. Dip each roll in melted butter and place close together in 2 loaf pans, or 3 if pans are small. Cover; let rise again until doubled. Preheat oven to 425\u00b0 and bake for about 12 to 15 minutes or until golden brown. If bottoms of rolls are not sufficiently browned, remove from pan and place in oven, on rack, for a few minutes.
