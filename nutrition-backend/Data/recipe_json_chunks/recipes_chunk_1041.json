Remove it from the oven and run a blunt knife between the sides of the pan and the cake. Carefully turn the cake out onto a serving platter. If any of the berries stick to the pan-as they might-just scrape them off with a table knife and return them to the cake.",

      "Pour 2 c liquid into large mixing bowl. I usually make use of anything I want to use up: --the tail end of a container of milk or chocolate milk or hot cocoa or soy milk or rice milk (milk makes a soft tender bread, especially nice in whole grain breads; a bit of chocolate gives it a darker look), --the end of a container of yogurt (I don't use fruit-flavored, but plain or sweetened is OK), --the end of can of beer (you won't taste it, but it produces a bread that won't mold), --the last bit of coffee in the pot (Gives the bread a darker look. Pumpernickel recipes are sometimes darkened with some coffee or cocoa), --potato-cooking water (whenever I boil peeled potatoes, I save the water for bread-baking, because it makes such a light dough). I use a two cup measure, pour in anything I want to use up, and then fill to the two cup mark with water if needed. If I'm out of milk, but want the richness of milk (say in a whole grain or squash bread) I sometimes add milk powder.",
      "If you want the bread to rise quickly, heat the liquid to lukewarm. If you have time to wait for a slow rise, cold is fine, too. Professional bakeries use a slow rise, which yields a wonderful texture.",
      "Stir in up to 1 c of cooked oatmeal, rice, cream of wheat, grits, wheat berries, millet, mashed potatoes, mashed sweet potatoes, mashed squash, etc. Cooked grains give texture. Mashed potatoes make a light, high-rising bread. Sweet potatoes or squash yield a lovely yellow color. You can combine more than one of these, but I don't recommend more than a cup total. I don't take time to prepare these ingredients especially for bread-making, but include them when I have leftovers I want to use up.",
      "It's OK to whisk in an egg or two. When I baking for vegetarians, and want to kick up the protein, I'll do that. Or when I've made French toast for breakfast, and have a little of the egg-milk mixture left over, I'll include that in the day's bread rather than throw it away.",
      "Stir in 2 T sugar, honey, molasses, brown sugar, sorghum, etc. Up to 4 T works fine, or you can leave it out entirely. Honey creates a wonderful aroma when the bread comes out of the oven. Molasses makes a darker bread.",
      "Stir in 2 T olive oil or melted butter or lard or bacon grease or other fat. You can leave the fat out entirely if you plan to eat the bread the first day--fat-free bread is quickly stale. Four T fat makes a nice rich bread. Butter is my own favorite--it works best if you have lukewarm liquid; with cold liquid it turns to lumps.",
      "Whisk in 2 T yeast for a quick process. Or use just 2 t yeast and allow time for a long sponge phase (described below). It is up to you and the time you have.",
      "Whisk in 2 t salt. (My family is happy with just about any variety of bread I make, except on those occasions when I forget to add the salt!)",
      "Whisk in 2 c flour: I like to use whole wheat or rye, but white is fine. And I often use up to 1/2 c of some other grain--cornmeal or buckwheat or soy flour or whatever. But these flours don't contain gluten, and are best used in small amounts.",
      "At this point, you have a sponge. You can set it aside for a while, to let the gluten develop, and the yeast to begin its bubbling. If you use cold water and a small amount of yeast, you can let the sponge sit all day while you are at work, or overnight. If you use warm liquid and the full 2T yeast, the sponge will start bubbling within a few minutes. Once you have a nice bubbly sponge, you can go on to the next step.",
      "Stir in chopped nuts or dried fruits. I rarely do this, because it's not very popular at my house, but like the texture of 2 T sunflower seeds on occasion, or the sweet bursts from a handful of raisins, especially in dark breads.",
      "Stir in 2 c flour. I normally use white flour at this stage. If you used milk for the liquid, and included 2-4 T fat, whole wheat or rye flour can also work well.",
      "Add the last 2 c white flour gradually, stirring and then kneading to form soft dough. Knead several minutes. Since the amount of liquid in the recipe may vary, you may need to use additional flour. This yields larger loaves.",
      "Allow dough to rise in bowl until double. (It will rise faster in a warm place.).",
      "Punch down and allow to rise a second time. (If I had a long sponge phase, I skip the second rise.).",
      "Grease 2 bread pans; divide dough in half; shape two loaves and place in pans. Preheat oven to 350.",
      "When dough no longer bounces back when lightly touched with a fingertip, bake the loaves 1 hour."

    "title": "fresh rhubarb pie",
    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "1. Preheat oven to 450*F.",
      "2. Combine sugar and flour. Sprinkle 1/4 of it over pastry in pie plate. Heap rhubarb over this mixture. Sprinkle with remaining sugar and flour. Dot with small pieces of butter. Cover with top crust.",
      "3. Place pie on lowest rack in oven. Bake for 15 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 350*F., and continue baking for 40 to 45 minutes. Serve warm or cold, with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.",
      "My Note: My 10-year-old grandson was determined to make this by himself, never having done anything like this before. This was the best pie! (and not just because I'm his Grpa). So simple -- so easy! I thought for sure that it would turn out too sweet because it seemed like a lot of sugar. But it was perfect! You still get that tart zip of the rhubarb that I love! I also added some cinnamon to the sugar mixture.just because I love that flavor. Make sure to put some of the sugar mixture on the bottom like the recipe states. This forms a layer under the rhubarb while baking, so that the crust doesn't get soggy. My D/W, late dad said that this pie tastes almost identical to the one his Mom used to make. That alone will make me use this recipe over and over again! Update 1/05 Don't bother with the butter; you don't need it at all. And do NOT----mix up the flour/sugar mixture with the fruit before adding the fruit to the pie shell. The reason you want copious amounts of sugar both on the bottom and on the top of the fruit (rather than mixed amongst it) is that while baking, the bubbling-hot sugar carmelizes in contact with the bottom and top crusts, a process which makes the crusts rather crispy in the final product. If you mix the sugar up with the fruit, you don't get that crispy crust, and the large amount of water in the rhubarb will definitely make the bottom crust sodden. Don't worry: the sugar makes its way through the fruit anyway, so you won't have parts of the pie too sweet and other parts too tart. Update: I won $100 for 1st prize in a rhubarb pie baking contest with this recipe. The only thing I did different, since I used green rhubarb, was tint the sugar with 2 drops of red food coloring before adding the flour. I also sprinkled a little sugar on top the crust. I used Pie Crust I from this site. Update 5/20/07: I won the rhubarb pie contest and the $100 prize again yesterday with this recipe. Since I made a 10 inch pie, I used 5 cups rhubarb, 1 2/3 cups sugar, 7 1/2 T flour, and 1 T butter. I added 3 drops red food color to the sugar. This pie is definitely a winner!"

BUT I DO Play with me food, and the only changes I would make is the cornstarch. Try only 1/2 T. The Germans do have a thinner sauce. I loved this dish. It most authentically should be served with a cucumber/yogurt dressing salad and pommes frites (french fries) or spaetzle. And served with spatzee which is orange crush and coke. You'll feel like you're at a German fest. I've also made this with turkey or chicken breasts (pounded real thin). But My D/W have to admit she added a bit of onion powder and garlic powder to my flour/bread crumb mixture, and instead of using a can of mushrooms, She fried up fresh mushrooms in butter with the onions till soft, then added the cornstarch and followed with the water, bouillion and sour creme. My family of 9 loved this! SOOOOO much flavor. She also went all out German and served a German Spaetzle Dumplings (she got from this site) along side this Jagerschnitzel. The two dishes went together beautifully. This is easy to prepare, smells and tastes wonderful cooking-a winner of a recipe She like to do!"

      "If you don't want to save the left over for another treatment use whatever is left over as a moisturizing face mask. Also can be used on dry elbow and knees (for best results, this should be used immediately after making and not saved. It will still work, but won't be as effective as when it's fresh).",
      "Do NOT shampoo afterwards, just rinse it really well. Do this on a day when you are not going to go out. Any oil that clings to your hair after you rinse it out, will continue to condition your hair until the next time you shampoo it out.",
      "*** for best hair conditioning purposes, use immediately after making without refrigerating first. The reason is, the fats and oil will penetrate your hair follicles better if it is not cold. Tip to remember for all hair care: Warm/Hot opens the hair follicles so that conditioner can penetrate deeper. And cold water closes the hair follicles. So after you shower your hair, after you rinse every thing out, rinse again with a blast of very cold water. The coldest you can possibly stand. This cold water blast will also make your hair super shiny!***."

Frozen crabmeat won't work as well, as the texture of these cakes relies on the large, succulent chunks of crabmeat. If using frozen crabmeat make sure you drain it well, squeezing to extract as much excess moisture as possible. Make breadcrumbs by pulsing stale bread in a food processor until crumbed."
