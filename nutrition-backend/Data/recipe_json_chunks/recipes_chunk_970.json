      "They were also incredibly easy to make and a will definitely be a new staple breakfast item whenever I need to serve a crowd. I served them with warmed tortillas and an assortment of sauteed vegetables for people to make their own breakfast burritos. Everyone at my brunch commented on how delicious the eggs were.",
      "Make scrambled eggs perfect every time! We have used this recipe countless times when cooking for a men's breakfast for 60 men. We found some great additions to be chopped green chilies and cream cheese that we cut off the bar with a knife and stir into the egg mixture. The eggs came out moist and fluffy and we have no left overs to show for it! It's also great because you can add any extras you want! **A couple tips though: *If you down scale this recipe; use your judgement for the milk, you may need to add a little less. *Also, if you use a smaller glass dish (ie 9x9) you will have to up your cooking time between 5-10 minute",
      "This time I only made half the recipe and baked it in an 8x8 baking dish. Stirred it several times so mine came out more like scrambled eggs but fluffier than scrambled eggs cooked on the stove top.",
      "This makes perfect scrambled eggs, soft and fluffy, but thoroughly cooked, and it is so much easier than standing over the stove making them. I halved the recipe since it is just me and added ham. I love the versatility of this recipe. Next time I will try adding salsa and using slightly less butter. You could also try adding cheese or vegetables.",
      "A very simple scrambled eggs recipe for a large crowd. This dish has become my go-to brunch dish when my family comes over. I usually add the real bacon bits that you can get in a jar and a handful of cheddar cheese if I want to make them extra special. They come out perfect every time. I've even scaled them down to 2 servings for my LOVE ONE and me and they were still delicious."

Let the broth warm up and cook another 5 minutes on medium (not boiling, just a light simmer).",

      "NOTE: As one reviewer mentioned they didn't make the bread, but did suggest that you do. The pasta and bread is key for this. It is a thinner sauce almost like a Japanese noodle bowl so the pasta and bread are used to soak up all the sauce and flavors. Even though it is creamy, the sauce is thinner which is why the bread and pasta are key for this."

      "When ground beef is browned, make sure nothing is stuck to the pan and turn the heat to high. Immediately pour egg mixture over the top of the onions, peppers, and beef. Immediately begin swirling contents of pan vigorously in a circular motion until contents become congealed and are moving together as one freely in the pan. Turn heat down to medium and cook until AT LEAST everything in the pan seems like it is solid enough to \"flip. Continue moving contents in the pan in a circular motion every 10-20 seconds to make sure it doesn't stick. I usually cook for about ten minutes on the first side. That amount of time will create a nice, brown \"crust\" and makes the fritatta more solid and easier to flip. Flip the eggs, immediately turning heat back up to high and swirl vigorously until moving freely as you already did for the other side. Also repeat the medium heat cooking, but this time can be less as the mixture is pretty thoroughly cooked through by this point. Feel free to substitute different veggies or protiens, but this combo is the best imho. Enjoy!"

Let the machine work until the doughball forms, then let it work five more minutes and have another look at your doughball. Have some extra flour or extra milk handy should you need to adjust the moisture. Your doughball should be just formed enough that the paddle isn't smushing through the bottom of the ball, but not so dry that the ball just spins without touching the walls. (If it's really way too dry, the doughball won't form at all!) The optimal texture is a ball that spins but also smacks the walls of the pan, too. Once you have a firm grasp on what the optimal doughball looks like, and the basic proportions of liquid/flour/salt/sugar/yeast, you're free to wing it with recipes and invent your own."

Remember that you cook on reflective heat in a fireplace, not the fire itself, so coals are important. Once a coal bed has been established, keep 1 log burning on the back of the fireplace to sustain the coals.",
      "PREP FISH: Completely scale the fish, leaving the head and tail intact. Remove the gills and rinse the inside cavity. Using a sharp paring knife, cut 3 slits on each side of the fish to the bone.",
      "Rub the fish with olive oil and season inside and out with salt, pepper, and hot sauce. Place chopped herbs in a small mixing bowl and blend thoroughly. Rub herb mixture in each of the 6 slits and on the outside of the fish. Fill the belly cavity with whole mixed herbs.",

Place the fish head-side up against the side of the fireplace Or lean it almost vertical on a rock inside the fire-pit. Be careful that the plank does not get near an open flame, as the board will ignite.",
      "Turn the fish every 30 minutes, first head up and then tail up. The fish will need to cook about 1 hour, depending on heat. Test the flesh for doneness with a kitchen fork. The underside of the fish will cook at the same rate since the plank is picking up the heat of the hearth. Remove from fire and serve on the plank for a unique presentation.",
      "CONVENTIONAL OVEN METHOD: Preheat oven to 275 degrees F. Cure the plank as described above and then follow seasoning instructions for fish. Place the fish lengthwise on the hot plank and place a cookie sheet on the lower rack underneath to catch any drippings that may run off during cooking. Bake on the center rack of the oven for approximately 20 minutes, or until fish is flaky. There is no need to turn the fish during the cooking process.

    "title": "old school santa maria tri-tip",
    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "Cover the tri-tip with a THICK layer (a \"rub\") of garlic/salt/pepper. You can use \"garlic salt\" but purists prefer to use garlic powder and then salt, separately. (If you wish, leave it covered and refrigerate overnight.) If you don't have the time, no problem! give it a thick covering and throw it on the grill.",
      "One hour before starting to grill, take the tri-tip out of the refrigerator and let it sit, so that the temperature rises about to room temperature. (the internal temperature difference between the refrigerated and room temperature tri-tip is at least 30F -- between 40F and 70\u00b0F The difference between a rare tri-tip and well-done tri-tip is only 20F -- 140F for rare, and 160F for well-done.)",
      "The outside of the tri-tip will sear and attain the perfect flavor and texture in about 7 minutes per side (there are 5 sides on a tri-tip, so the total cooking time should be around 25 minutes (note that this will vary because of differences in the quality of the meat, the outside temperature, humidity and wind etc etc.] Back to the reason to let the meat's internal temperature rise to room temperature: In 7 minutes per side of cooking, the internal temperature -- about 3 inches into the meat -- will climb about 70\u00b0F If the internal temperature begins at 70F, then in 7 minutes it will be a perfect 140F for rare-meat lovers. But if the meat starts at only 40F internally, then its internal temperature will be only 110F after 7 minutes, so it won't be done. So the meat will have to stay longer on the fire -- perhaps another 3 minutes per side, or 15 minutes total -- in order for its internal temperature to reach 140\u00b0F But by then the outside 1\" of the meat will be over-cooked and dry. That's the reason to let the meat come up to room temperature: in effect, you are pre-cooking the inside.",
      "When ready to grill, make sure that the coals from burned down wood -- red oak is the traditional choice in Santa Maria, because that's what's there -- or charcoal (lump is best) is VERY VERY hot and that the flames have died down. The charcoal should be covered with a light gray ash. To get a very hot grill, you'll need to use lots of charcoal -- for one good sized tri-tip, use about 5 pounds of lump. Here in environmentally aware California, to start our charcoal fire, we use a \"chimney\" rather than charcoal lighter fluid, and the chimney that I use holds about 5 pounds of lump. I use a Weber Kettle and put the lump in the charcoal holders so that the charcoal is about 4\" deep. After the fire is perfect, put on the grill and let it get very hot. Just before putting on the meat, brush the grill with some olive oil.",
      "Start with the fat side up (in truth it makes no difference.\"If you put the fat side of the tri tip on the fire first, the moisture will come up through the meat and make it tender.\") The problem I have with this is that, as the fat warms, it will drip down into the fire and will not evaporate until it's in the fire. But it doesn't make any real difference, because you have to turn the tri-tip after 1 or 2 minutes per side so that you sear it on all sides. Note that, in order to sear the thin edges, you have to figure out a way to balance the tri-tip on one end.",
      "If you're cooking several at once, it's easy to lean them against one another, but if you're cooking only one, you'll have to use a long wooden spatula or some other jerry-rigged device to balance the tri-tip on its thin edges.",
      "The BIG SECRET: when you first put the tri-tip on the grill, the fire might start flaming. This is GOOD to a point: the fire will totally blacken the meat (which is what you want). Let the flames blacken one side of the tri-tip for 30 or 45 seconds, and then rotate the tri-tip to do a different side. (There are a total of six sides.) But don't overdo the flames: the idea is to sear the juices in and to create a wonderfully delicious crust, but not to dry out the meat. After the flames have seared the meat so that it's black all around, then move the meat to the side or back of the grill, where it is still VERY HOT but not directly above the fire so that it will NOT FLAME.",
      "The total cooking time varies, and there is no absolute. Tri-tip is best when seared (blackened) on the outside, which is crunchy with the garlic and salt, and when it's red rare in the center. Cooking time depends on how big the tri-tip is, how rare you like it, the heat of the fire and the distance from the coals to the meat. For a 3 pound tri-tip, I'd plan for a total of about 30 minutes, with constant attention, but keep in mind that I like it very rare. Be careful with timing, though.",
      "When you think that the meat is done, remove it from the fire and cut it in half (to check that it's done). Remember that, even after you take the meat off the grill, it is continuing to cook. So, when you cut into the meat to check that it's done, it should be even rarer than you want. If it's done, leave it for 7 minutes (not 5, not 10) -- so that the juices settle into the meat (otherwise, when you slice it, you'll have a plate full of juice that should have stayed in the meat). If it's not done, put each half back on the grill for a few minutes -- but be sure not to overcook it.",
      "After the tri-tip has rested exactly 7 minutes, trim the fat and then slice it VERY thin -- not quite \"paper thin\" but as thin as you reasonably can with a sharp knife. Cut across the grain, which is across the triangle. An illustration: if you can imaging that the tri-tip is in the shape of a pyramid, then cut it starting at the top of the pyramid and slice horizontally. Thus, the slices will not all be the same size, but the meat will be the most tender."
