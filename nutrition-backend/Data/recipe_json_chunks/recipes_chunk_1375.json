I'm a lover of shortcuts, but for aioli, I prefer to whisk it myself. The call is up to you if you prefer a food processor.",

While blade is running, slowly add olive oil, drip by drip. After olive oil has emulsified with the other ingredients, add canola oil at a slightly faster pace - but never quicker than a slow steady stream, or the emulsification may break. Aioli should be slightly thinner than store-bought mayonnaise. If you need to thin it, add teaspoons of warm water one at a time. Stir in harissa and minced preserved lemon. Refrigerate aioli until you are ready to use. It will keep refrigerated for 3 to 4 days.",

Cover again for 2 to 3 more minutes to bring the grates back to that piping hot level.",

After about 2 minutes, you will see the lower half of the fillet closest to the heat starting to turn opaque. It's time to flip. Use a fish spatula (one that is wide and has a tapered end) to gently loosen the underside of the fillet from the grill and flip quickly. Cook for another 2 to 4 minutes, depending on the thickness of the fish. To test if the fillet is done, gently use the fish spatula to pry open the middle flakes of the fish.

If it barely holds together, crack another egg into the bowl, and add another 1/3 cup flour.

The mound of batter will look pyramidal or gumdrop-like in shape. Gently flatten with a spatula. After about a minute, check the underside to ensure it is lightly browned. Flip the fritter, and cook for 1 to 2 minutes more or until evenly golden. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate, season with sea salt, and let cool briefly. Taste.

If it is thicker, you can parbake the dough for a few minutes before adding the toppings. You can also sometimes buy fresh dough from your favorite pizza joint!",

      "Tuna packed in olive oil is one of the genuinely great things in life. It has a tenderness that the water-packed varieties lack utterly. It costs a bit more, and is worth every penny. The daughter and I became hopelessly addicted to it last summer in Italy and France. We'd buy small cans in 3-packs. We used it in pastas, on salads, and carried it in a backpack for impromptu lunches, knowing we could always score good bread with which to eat it. It's become a pantry staple I wouldn't want to try to do without. To use it here, don't drain the oil off too aggressively. Leave about half of it in the can; it will contribute a lovely silkiness to the filling. Scrape the tuna and oil into a mixing bowl.",
      "May I tell you about an easy way to break down a bell pepper? Stand it on end, position your knife at the bump of the \"shoulder\", and slice down, following the curve of the pepper. You'll take off about a quarter of it, and leave the seeds and white pith attached to the center. Slice the pepper into strips, then lay a few at a time on their sides to chop. A knife will cut through the skin much more easily from the side than if you lay the strips skin-side down or up. Especially if your knife isn't, ahem, as sharp as it probably should be. Add the peppers to the bowl.",
      "Slice the scallions and add them to the bowl. Roughly chop the capers (you're just trying to break them up a bit) and add them to the bowl. Mince the thyme (the stems on my plant in the kitchen window are so tender that I don't even need to pull the leaves off) and add it. Eyeball the mayo, but don't use a heavy hand. You want just enough to bind the mixture. Squeeze in the lemon juice and add the red pepper flakes. Gently stir everything together.",
      "Turn on the broiler. Set a rack a notch below the one right under the broiler; that will let the filling warm and cheese melt without either burning. I prefer broiling the outsides of the bread, then adding the filling and cheese, and passing everything under the broiler again. I love the additional layer of flavor that comes from allowing the cheese and edges of the bread to brown on the inside, rather than simply melt, as they would in a skillet or press. Lay bread slices outsides-up on a baking sheet NOT lined with parchment, for what I trust are obvious reasons. Brush them with olive oil and place under broiler. Don't walk away. They should brown nicely within about a minute. Remove the baking sheet and use tongs to turn over slices of bread. Divide filling between two slices, and arrange cheese on the others. Return to broiler. Heat for about 2 minutes, until cheese is bubbly and golden brown, and filling has heated.",

      "Cut the roots off the radishes near the base; if they have a plump tail base cut where it gets narrow and thread-like. Cut the greens off the radishes leaving about a half-inch of stem attached. Rinse and gently scrub the radishes to remove any dirt. Cut into halves or quarters, from stem end to root end. Place cut radishes into a bowl of ice water.",
      "Remove roots and battered leaves from onions. Cut root ends into 2 approximately 2-inch long segments. Cut 5 or 6 2-inch long sections from the dark green portions. Using a sharp knife cut a slit lengthwise into each piece so they can be unrolled into flat sheets. Discard any spongy central layers. Stack the onion sheets and cut into very thin matchsticks. Place the sliced onions into the ice bath. They will begin to curl as they chill. Let radishes and onions chill for at least 10 minutes before proceeding.",
      "Combine 1/3 cup olive oil, colatura, vinegar, lemon juice, mustard, and pepper in a small bowl. Whisk to combine. Set aside.",
      "Combine ricotta, 1 tablespoon olive oil, and 1 tablespoon milk or half-and-half in another smallish bowl. Whisk vigorously until smooth, and ricotta has lost most if not all of it's graininess. Add more milk or half-and-half as needed to thin so the ricotta is fluffy and spreadable.",
      "Drain the radishes and onions, then spread them onto a clean kitchen towel to dry more thoroughly.",
      "Transfer the ricotta mixture to a serving plate (or plates), and using the back of a spoon spread into a fairly even layer. Try to estimate how much surface area the salad will take up and cover about that area with the ricotta. It's nice to have a little ricotta peeking out after the salad is plated, but it is not necessary.",
      "Combine radishes, onions, peas, and farro in bowl. Sprinkle on 2 to 3 generous pinches of salt then stir. Rewhisk the dressing, then add to the radish mixture. Toss to coat. Season with salt and white pepper to taste. Use a slotted spoon to place the salad evenly on the ricotta bed. Stack several mint leaves together then roll lengthwise and cut crosswise into thin strips (aka chiffonade). Repeat with rest of mint. Sprinkle salad with the sunflower seeds, feta, and mint. Serve.",
      "*It is pretty easy to sprout whole grain farro, and once sprouted it has a pleasantly chewy texture with a fresh nutty flavor. Soak a half cup farro in water overnight, then drain, rinse, and transfer to a shallow container lined with a damp paper towel. Loosely cover until the grains have developed little tails (mine took about 24 hours). Covered and stored in the fridge they will last for several days. 1/2 cup yields over a cup of sprouted grain."

    "title": "clams casino",
    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "Ideally, this recipe starts with you, the cook, going out at low tide to dig some clams on the Atlantic coast. If you're in the right place in the right season and you happen to have a shellfish license, dig out your tide charts and go get your toes in the mud! (If not, then just skip all this and go on to step 2.) Bring your clams home in a bucket of seawater. Your best bet is to start these the night before you want to serve them. Put your bucket of clams and water someplace where the clams' spitting won't dampen anything important (they're champion spitters, you know), scatter a generous amount of cornmeal over the water, and leave the clams overnight. They will take the cornmeal in and put out most of the sand and grit they've accumulated-it helps to clean them out and makes eating them more pleasant.",
      "30 minutes to an hour before you want to eat your clams (depending on how many clams you have to deal with-more clams take more time, of course!), scrub the outsides of the shells clean and put them on the stove in your biggest pot with an inch or two of water in the bottom. Cover the pot and steam the clams until their shells open (it's hard to predict how long this will take, but I've found it can be up to 15 minutes sometimes). As the topmost ones open, remove them, in their shells, to a bowl so that the ones underneath aren't too weighted down to open. If some of the shells don't open at all, discard those clams; they aren't safe to eat if they don't open.",
      "Get out some baking sheets, and start setting out your opened clams. Twist the shells apart, and put each clam in a half-shell on a baking sheet. If you have really big clams, you may want to cut them in half and split them between two shells. You don't need to worry about spreading them out-fill the baking sheets as full as you like.",
      "Into each half-shell with a clam in it, place a few bits of sweet pepper. Then, cover the the clam with a piece of bacon, and squeeze some lemon juice over the top.",
      "Turn on your broiler, and broil the trays of clams until the bacon is crisp and sizzling (it takes a few minutes, but the exact time will depend on your broiler. Keep an eye on them while they cook and you'll be fine). Remove the trays, and serve the clams immediately! The shells will be hot, so be careful, but they are at their best straight out of the broiler."

Allow this rhubarb sauce to cool to room temperature.",

      "Remove the whipped custard from the heat and continue to beat it with the handheld mixer for another 6 to 8 minutes, until it has cooled to room temperature.",
      "In a separate bowl, whip the cream and mascarpone to stiff peaks, about 5 minutes. Gently fold 1/3 of the custard mixture at a time into the whipped cream until fully combined. Then, gently fold in the rhubarb sauce until it is partially mixed in-there should still be streaks; the mixture doesn't need to be uniform. Transfer this mixture to a 2-quart (or so) container, lightly press plastic wrap onto the surface to cover and freeze until completely frozen, about 6 hours (or overnight).",
      "In a heavy-bottomed saucepan, melt the butter over medium-high heat. Continue to cook it, stirring frequently, until it has browned and smells nutty, about 6 or 7 minutes (it will foam a bunch in the process, which is fine, just keep stirring). Scrape the butter (making sure to get all the brown sediment) into a mixing bowl. Set it aside to allow it to cool down to room temperature.",
      "Preheat your oven to 350\u00b0 F. Once the butter is cool, stir in the brown sugar, salt, and vanilla extract until well combined. Then, stir in the eggs until just combined. (The mixture won't look smooth, but you don't want to over-mix it.)",
      "In a separate bowl, stir together the flour, baking soda, baking powder, and candied ginger. Stir these dry ingredients into the wet ingredients until they just come together.",
      "Form the cookie dough into 24 equal-sized balls (about 1 1/2 tablespoons each) and place them, evenly spaced, onto two baking sheets. Press each cookie flat. (I found my cookies really didn't spread at all during baking so I had to smoosh them down to proper thickness, but they may spread by themselves in a more humid environment where the dough is moister.)",
      "Bake each sheet of cookies in the oven until they just barely start to harden, about 8 to 10 minutes. You want them to be fairly undercooked so they stay chewy. Transfer to a cooling rack.",
      "If you want to eat all of your ice cream sandwiches immediately with friends (a highly-recommended way of eating ice cream sandwiches!), take out the semifreddo and let everyone scoop a big helping of semifreddo out and smash it in between two somewhat-warm cookies and chow down. To assemble the sandwiches to save for later, allow the cookies to cool to room temperature. Remove the semifreddo from the freezer and allow it to soften just enough so that it is easy to scoop. Sandwich a generous scoop between two cookies, press together lightly, wrap tightly in plastic wrap or aluminum foil and place back in the freezer to harden. Repeat with all of the cookies to make 12 sandwiches (you'll have some semifreddo left over-yum!). Keep them tightly wrapped in the freezer for up to a couple of weeks. Also, if your cookies aren't underdone enough, they might be tough to bite through without squirting all of the semifreddo out from between them. If this happens, don't worry! Just twist the two cookies apart and eat each as an open faced ice cream sandwich with half of the semifreddo on each."

Then stir in the flour until all incorporated, and stir in the raisins at this point too, if using (which you should. I think boller are decidedly best with raisins. My brothers would disagree, though.). The dough should still be a bit sticky or tacky, but not stick too terribly to your fingers if you tap it with a knuckle. Adding flour as needed to keep the dough from being irretrievably sticky, knead with the bread hook or by hand until supple (but probably still slightly sticky!), about 8 minutes.

To serve, dip the popsicle molds into a bowl of very hot water for a few seconds -- the fudgesicles should slip out easily."

      "To make the dough: Put the flour, confectioners' sugar, and salt in a food processor and pulse a couple times to blend. Scatter the pieces of butter over the dry ingredients and pulse until the butter is cut in coarsely-you'll have some pieces the size of oatmeal flakes and some the size of peas. Stir in the yolk just to break it up and add it a little at a time, pulsing after each addition.",
      "When the egg is incorporated, process in long pulses-about 10 seconds each-until the dough, which will look granular soon after the egg is added, forms clumps and curds. Just before you reach this clumpy stage, the sound of the machine working the dough will change-heads-up. Turn the dough out onto a work surface.",
      "To incorporate the butter more evenly and to catch any dry ingredients that might have escaped mixing, separate small amounts of dough from the pile and use the heel of your hand to smear each piece a few inches across the counter. In French, this is called frisage, and it's the ideal way to finish blending a dough.",
      "To make a rolled-out crust: Shape the dough into a disk and put it between two sheets of parchment paper or wax paper. Roll the dough out evenly, turning it over frequently and lifting the paper often so that it doesn't roll into the dough and form creases. Aim for a circle that's at least 3 inches larger than the base of your tart pan. The dough will be 1/8- to 1/16-inch-thick, but it's the diameter, not the thickness, that counts. Slide the rolled-out dough, still between the papers, onto a baking sheet or cutting board and refrigerate for 2 hours or freeze it for 1 hour. The dough can be refrigerated overnight or frozen for up to 2 months; wrap it airtight to freeze.",
      "When the dough is thoroughly chilled, put it on the counter and let it rest for about 10 minutes, or until it's just pliable enough to blend without breaking. Remove the dough from the paper, fit it into a buttered tart pan, and trim the excess dough even with the edges of the pan. (If you'd like, you can fold the excess over and make a thicker wall around the sides of the tart.) Prick the crust all over with a fork and freeze for at least 30 minutes, preferably longer, before baking.",
      "To make a press-in crust: Butter the tart pan and press the dough evenly over the bottom and up the sides of the pan. You won't need all of the dough if you want to make a thin crust, but I think it's nice to make a thickish one so that you can really enjoy the texture. Press the pieces of dough in so that they cling to one another and will knit together when baked, but don't use a lot of force-working lightly will preserve the crust's shortbready texture. Prick the crust all over with a fork and freeze for at least 30 minutes, preferably longer, before baking.",
      "When you're ready to bake: Center a rack in the oven and heat the oven to 400\u00b0 F. Butter the shiny side of a piece of aluminum foil (or use nonstick foil) and fit the foil snugly into the crust. If the crust is frozen, you can bake it as is; if not, fill it with dried beans or rice.",
      "To partially bake the crust: Bake for 25 minutes, then carefully remove the foil (and weights). If the crust has puffed, press it down gently with the back of a spoon. Transfer the crust to a cooling rack (keep it in the pan).",
      "To fully bake the crust: Bake the crust for 25 minutes, then carefully remove the foil (and weights). If the crust has puffed, press it down gently with the back of a spoon. Bake the crust for another 7 to 10 minutes, or until it is firm and gold brown. Transfer the crust to a cooling rack (keep it in its pan)."

      "Preheat oven to 275\u00b0 F. Line a 9- by 13-inch glass baking dish with parchment paper. (Note: A 9- by 13-inch dish will yield a thin layer of mochi, only about 1/4-inch thick. For thicker mochi, use a 9- by 9-inch glass dish and bake for longer, about 90 minutes.)",
      "In a large bowl, whisk together the mochiko, sugar, and baking powder. In a separate bowl, whisk together the water and coconut milk. (Note: Be sure to use full-fat coconut milk. You can usually find it in cans, and it should be quite thick.) Add the wet ingredients to the dry and whisk until the mixture is smooth and no lumps remain. Unlike most baking, you don't need to worry about over-mixing the ingredients, since mochi is dense and chewy to begin with. So whisk away! Some recipes even call for mixing all the ingredients, dry and wet, in a food processor all at once, and call it a day.",
      "Pour the mixture into your lined baking dish. Cover with foil and bake for 60 minutes. The mochi is done when it is soft and gelatinous but holds its shape when touched. (NOTE: A few people have reported that their mochi did not set. A few notes on softer mochi -- using low-fat coconut milk may result in a softer consistency. You may also want to check your oven to make sure it's at the right temperature. Also, if you want extra insurance, you can add another 1/4 cup mochiko flour to the dry ingredients, which should result in significantly firmer mochi, but in my opinion, is a bit more \"floury\" or \"pasty\" in flavor. If you've already baked it for an hour and it doesn't appear to be set, raise the temperature to 300\u00b0 F and remove the foil. Bake for an additional 10-15 minutes, uncovered. Also, note that even if it's soft and gel-like when it first comes out of the oven, the mochi will set as it cools.)",
      "Let cool completely or overnight. Dust a surface with your starch (alternatively, you can simply use more mochiko flour) and turn the mochi onto the surface. Sprinkle starch over the mochi. Wrap a knife in Saran wrap to prevent the mochi sticking. Using the wrapped knife, cut the mochi into small pieces, then dust again with starch or flour, and serve!"

      "If you're using the ganache as a filling for a tart or glaze, use it immediately. If you're using it to fill and frost a cake, you'll have to wait for it to thicken. You can leave it on the counter, stirring occasionally (it thickens slowly), or you can set the bowl into a larger bowl filled with ice cubes and water, in which case, stir often and stay close -- it thickens quickly. Alternatively, you can put it in the refrigerator, checking on it and stirring frequently. If you miss the moment, you can always reheat the ganache (see below).",
      "Storing: The ganache can be covered tightly and kept in the refrigerator for up to 5 days or frozen for up to 2 months. You'll have to bring it back to the consistency you need before using it, either by leaving it out at room temperature or warming it. Heat it in 5-second spurts in a microwave or put it in a bowl set over a pan of simmering water. With ganache (especially white chocolate ganache), the keys to success are very low heat and a very light touch."

It should take about 2 minutes to finish cooking the fish. The flesh should be uniformly firm and a skewer inserted in the center of the fillet should come out warm to the touch; do not overcook.",

      "Make the preferment. Whisk the yeast into the water and add the flour. Stir to blend. It will be a bit stiff. That's okay; it will loosen up as it proofs. Cover tightly with plastic and let proof at room temperature until it has visibly risen and even looks a bit bubbled beneath the surface of the dough. This will take a few hours. Refrigerate overnight.",
      "The next day, remove the preferment from the fridge at least an hour before you plan to mix your bread dough so it can lose its chill.",
      "When ready to mix, add the water and yeast to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook. Whisk to blend, then whisk in the honey and the warm milk (nuke it for a few seconds).",
      "Add the preferment, bread flour, all-purpose flour, salt, and olive oil. Mix until all ingredients are well blended and no visible streaks of flour remain, about 3-4 minutes. Turn off the mixer and cover the bowl with a piece of plastic. Allow dough to rest for 20 minutes. This is called an autolyse. It permits the protein strands to become fully hydrated without the stress of mixing at the same time. By the time you turn the mixer back on, you'll be amazed by how quickly the dough comes together around the hook, and you actually see long, thin strands of gluten as they leave the sides of the bowl. After turning the mixer back on, knead for 5 minutes. This can a difficult dough to windowpane because it is so tender, but you will be able to tease a walnut-sized piece over your fingertips to a good thinness.",
      "Turn the dough out onto a floured surface. Pan-spray the mixing bowl and return the dough, turning it over once. Cover the bowl with your same piece of plastic and allow to proof at room temperature until doubled, about 1 1/2 hours.",
      "Now you have some choices. I frequently shape, proof, and bake one loaf on the same day I mix the dough. It's my way of having my so-to-speak cake and eating it too. I get a gorgeous, light, crusty loaf of fresh bread to have with dinner, and the next day get 1 to 3 MORE loaves (depending on how you shape them) of even lighter, crustier, more gorgeous bread. The overnight retarding of the dough permits yeast and bacterial action to produce a bread of great character and flavor, so it is definitely worth doing so with at least part of your dough. So, once the dough has doubled after its first proofing, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface. Divide off a piece of it: a half or a quarter, depending if you want to make 2 large loaves in total, or 4 smaller baguette-sized loaves. Re-spray the bowl and return the balance of the dough to it, and cover it with a fresh piece of plastic. Shape the piece of dough as you wish: into a round boule, a long thin baguette, or an oval batard. Set it on a baking sheet lined with parchment, or if you have an oven stone, just proof it on a sheet of parchment. Dust the top with flour and cover lightly with your piece of plastic. Let proof at room temperature until doubled, about an hour.",
      "When the dough is about half-proofed, set your oven to 450 degrees. If you have a baking stone, set it in the oven at the same time. I long ago sacrificed a small cast iron skillet to the oven. I just leave it on the floor of the oven all the time, so that when I bake bread that needs the crisp, crackly crust, I add a cup of boiling water (very carefully, mind you) to the skillet and shoot the bread that I've proofed on a sheet of parchment right in onto the stone. Give both some thought. Together they make a significant difference in the quality of the final bread.",
      "This part goes fast: just before you put the bread in the oven, pour the hot water into the skillet if you have one, and carefully set it on the oven floor. Slash the bread diagonally 3 or 4 times with a serrated knife held at an acute angle. Get the bread into the oven. Set a timer for 15 minutes. Don't open the oven until it goes off. Then, re-set the timer for another 15 minutes, open the oven and quickly rotate the bread 180 degrees. The bread is done when it reaches an internal temperature of between 200 to 205 degrees. A boule will take about 5 minutes longer than a baguette shape.",
      "When done, remove from the oven and cool on a rack for about 15 minutes before slicing. It's worth the wait."

Add the grated potatoes, minced garlic, 2 eggs and then slowly add 2 cups warm water, being careful not to beat it too much (which makes the waffles tough). Let sit for 5 minutes while your waffle iron heats up. Spray the iron and leave on High for 2 cycles to ensure the potatoes inside are done. Transfer each waffle to a warmed plate.",
      "Eggs: Mix 8 eggs with the heavy cream and minced garlic, salt and pepper, then whisk until blended and cook slowly in a well-oiled pan. Gently scramble until done--don't let the bottom brown--you want them softly yellow and fresh looking! Divide the scrambled eggs between the 4 waffles, placing a good mound of them in the middle of each waffle.",
      "Spicy Queso Sauce: In a blender add the crushed crackers, evaporated milk, crumbled Queso, minced cilantro, minced japalenos, and salt. Pulse until fully blended but you don't want it soupy--you are aiming for a medium thickness, rather like a good mayonnaise. Add a little water or more milk if needed, but keep the mix fairly thick. Pour into a bowl and set in the fridge for one hour to let thicken.",
      "Garnish: Sear the yellow and orange pepper strips in a lightly oiled skillet. Garnish with a slice of Cheddar on top of the hot scrambled eggs, then the grated Gouda, then pour over about a 1/2 cup of spicy Queso sauce and garnish with seared pepper strips. Serve with smoked bacon and dilled fresh tomato slices for a real treat!"

      "Heat your oven to 150F (65.6 celsius). You will be using the oven at this temperature simply to place the dough on top in order to quicken the rise. \r\n\r\nIn a stand mixer bowl with a dough hook attachment, mix the bread flour, yeast, and sugar thoroughly. Then add melted butter, warm cream+water, salt, and eggs. Turn up the motor to medium speed and knead until well mixed, scraping sides as needed. The dough should be very elastic and slightly sticky, but not to the point where you can't get it off your skin. Sprinkle flour if it's too wet. Form dough roughly into a uniform sphere and move it to another bowl. Cover with damp towel and place on top of 150F heated oven FOR ONE HOUR. If you choose to rest the dough much slower, you can place it on top of the fridge for about 2-3 hours. Meanwhile, move on to the other steps.",
      "Punch out the air out of the dough. Tear into six equal pieces and put back into the stand mixer bowl with a dough hook attachment. Add the yeast, sugar, egg white, and salt and knead until well incorporated and it's elastic and smooth. Cover with damp towel and let it rise in room temperature for 15 minutes, but it shouldn't double up in size fully, only to about 80-85% its fullness.",
      "***When handling raw taro, always keep in mind that it contains toxic crystals that can eventually cause ailments and itchy skin. It's completely healthy and good for you when it's cooked, but do use gloves when handling.*** Once again, I recommend making the taro filling a day in advance to lighten up the work load. Boil the peeled and cubed taro in water with salt. It's fully cooked when it's mushy and easily mash-able. Drain the water and mash with sugar and butter. Set aside.",
      "For the topping of the bread, you will knead two different doughs, but it's simple so not to worry. Start with the water dough. In a mixing bowl, knead all the ingredients in the stated order. Make sure not to over mix. Then tear into 6 equal pieces and set aside.",
      "For the oil dough, mix the flour and salt in the stand mixer bowl with paddle attachment. You can do it by hand but it will be much harder to mix in the food coloring. Add the purple (or 5 drops blue+5 drops red) food coloring to the oil and mix as much as possible, keeping in mind the oil will make the colors trap in bubbles so they won't mix perfectly, but that's okay. Tear into six equal pieces. Place both doughs in the freezer until the yeast dough is ready.\r\n\r\nOn a lightly floured surface, roll out each water dough into disks of about 5 inches in circumference. They won't be thin like dumpling skin--a bit thicker. Now form one purple oil dough into a ball and place it in the middle of one water dough disk. Wrap the disk and seal it around the purple dough completely. Sprinkle flour and roll it out into a thin oval. I had a hard time doing this because I was running out of time, but try to make it really thin. Roll the flattened out doughs into a cigar, cut in half lengthwise, place both parts on the surface with the spiral pattern upwards, and press them down. Again, roll each dough flat and repeat this process with the rest. Set aside.",
      "Now for assembling, Heat your oven to 350F (177C degrees). Tear the milk yeast dough into 12 equal pieces. Roll the pieces as big as possible. Spoon a good amount of taro filling onto one oval disk, leaving about 1/2 inch room on edges. Cover it with another oval disk and roughly seal them. Roll into a log and place one of the rolled out oil+water crust disks on top. Dust with flour lightly on top. Repeat this process with the rest and you should end up with 6 large buns. Bake for approximately 26-28 minutes or until the yeast dough is lightly golden and springy. Enjoy straight out of the oven! Later wrap with plastic wrap and refrigerate, then serve heated slightly. Keep in mind taro can go rancid quicker than it looks. \r\nRelated Posts Plugin for WordPress, Blogger..."

Next, make the mushroom filling. Heat some cooking oil in a large skillet over medium heat, then add 2/3 of the chopped onion. Cook until they are just softened, about three minutes, then add 2 of the garlic cloves and cook another minute. Mix in the mushrooms and cilantro and season with salt and pepper. Cook until all the water has been cooked out of the mushrooms and they have started to brown (about 10 minutes). Remove from heat and set aside.",
      "To make the sauce, you get to have a little fun with fire. Charring the poblano pepper over (or under) a direct flame makes the skin blister and easy to remove. It is edible, but it's a little bit tough so especially in this application, where the chile is blended into the sauce, it's better to remove it. Turn on the broiler to high and place the poblano pepper as close to the flame as possible (exactly how you do this will depend on your broiler set-up). It's probably a good idea to put the chile either on a baking sheet or a piece of foil so that you can move it in and out easily. Keep an eye on the chile and as soon as the skin starts to blister and bubble, use tongs to turn it over and expose another side to the flame. Keep rotating the pepper until most of the skin is blistered. Transfer it to a plastic or paper bag and close the bag; let it sit for about 10 minutes.",
      "Remove the pepper from the bag and peel off the skin with your fingers. Roughly chop the chile and set aside.",

Add the remaining 1/3 of the onion and let it cook until softened (3 minutes), then add the remaining 1 clove of garlic and cook one more minute. Mix in the flour and cook until the mixture is bubbling (2 minutes).",
      "Whisk in the milk and turn up the heat to medium. Continue stirring until the milk has thickened. Pour the mixture into a food processor and add the poblano chile, chile powder, cayenne, and salt and pepper. Blend until smooth.",
      "Finally, put everything together. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees and get out a baking dish (our 8 inch square was a little too small; we had to put some overflow enchiladas in another little dish so if you have something bigger use that). Spoon some of the poblano sauce into the bottom of the dish (just enough to lightly cover the bottom and keep the enchiladas from sticking).",
      "Divide the mushrooms into 8 portions and scoop one portion into a tortilla. Add a light sprinkling of cheese (to hold everything together), then roll the tortilla and place it in the baking dish with the seam down. Continue doing this until you've filled all the tortillas, packing them in side by side. Spoon the rest of the sauce over the enchiladas, then sprinkle the corn on top and cover with cheese. Bake until the cheese is bubbling and beginning to brown (about 30 minutes). Serve with refried beans or rice or whatever catches your fancy."

      "Tips: A. The chemicals in chili peppers that cause that wonderful feeling of heat on the tongue can cause a not-so-wonderful feeling if they get into your eyes-and can share the love with other foods on your menu. To avoid cross-contamination, avoid touching your face or eyes after cutting and trimming hot chilies. Change work surfaces and knives. Some cooks wear plastic gloves.\r\n\r\nB. Chipotle chili is the name for the fiery smoked jalapeno. It is sold in a variety of formats, often canned in adobo sauce, a condiment made of chilies and spices. For a milder flavor, you can just use a little less. The remaining chipotles in adobo will keep, refrigerated in an airtight container, for 2 weeks.\r\n\r\nC. Ask your butcher to separate the drummettes and wings and remove and discard the inedible wing tips. \r\n\r\nD. Discard the marinade when you are ready to cook, as it may harbor dangerous foodborne bacteria. Some recipes suggest that you can kill any bacteria by boiling a marinade for 15 minutes but this is not true-and not safe."

Transfer to the oven and roast until the internal temperature is between 135\u00b0-140\u00b0 (it will continue to rise as it rests), 15-18 minutes.

Transfer the pork to a cutting board and tent with foil while you make the sauce.",

Remember this pan has been in a very hot oven and the handle is hot-I only remind you because I always seem to forget!! Add the minced onion and saute until translucent, about 1 minute, scraping up any brown bits crusted to the bottom of the pan as you go. Add the wine, bring to a boil and allow to reduce slightly. Now add the stock, bring to a boil, and reduce to a saucy consistency, 3-5 minutes. Whisk in the Dijon mustard, taste, and season with salt and pepper.",

      "Remove the saucepan off the heat and add a tiny stream of the hot cream mixture into the egg mixture, whisking the egg mixture quickly and continuously as the tiny stream of hot cream is incorporated. Do this until approximately 1/4 cup of the hot cream mixture has been whisked into the egg mixture. Quick and continuous whisking prevents the egg mixture from scrambling upon contact with the hot cream mixture.",

      "Heat the saucepan containing the custard mixture on medium, whisking frequently, until the mixture just reaches 180 deg F (just barely reaching boiling). Immediately remove the saucepan from the heat and give the mixture another few good whisks off heat.",
      "Strain the hot custard mixture through a fine sieve lined with 2 to 3 layers of cheesecloth into a large bowl (ceramic, glass or stainless steel, not plastic), making sure to capture all the coarse coffee grounds in the cheesecloth layers. The cheesecloth and coffee grounds can be discarded or composted or re-purposed for other uses.",
      "Allow the filtered custard base to cool to room temperature, and then cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours (preferably overnight). Prepare your ice cream maker canister if it requires 24 hours to pre-freeze before use. I use the Cuisinart ICE-21.",
      "When you are ready to churn the ice cream, set up and turn on the machine. Slowly and carefully pour the chilled custard base into the churning canister through the opening at the top. Meanwhile, finely chop the bar of dark chocolate on a parchment-paper lined surface (chopping diagonal one way, then diagonal the other way) until you have pieces of chocolate smaller than chocolate chips. After the ice cream has been churning for about 15 minutes, add the finely chopped dark chocolate to the ice cream. Continue to let the mixture churn for another 5 minutes, or until the texture of the mixture thickens into a soft-serve consistency.",
      "Turn the machine off and unplug it (safety first!). Using a wooden spoon or rubber spatula, quickly transfer the ice cream into freezer-safe airtight container(s) and freeze for at least 4 hours (preferably overnight). Label your container(s) with the date and flavor if you desire. Enjoy some of the freshly churned ice cream by cleaning what's left in the canister! The sugar and egg (along with the little splash of liqueur) help preserve the ice cream's creamy texture when it freezes, so that you can scoop without thawing the container. You can use instant coffee/espresso granules in place of the coarse coffee grounds, but I like the original flavor of freshly ground coffee beans."

    "title": "spatchcocked roast turkey",
    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "If you want to roast a spatchcocked turkey, you really should buy your bird from a butcher who will \"butterfly\" it for you. Make sure you have her or him give you the backbone and other parts that are removed, as they are perfect for roasting and making a rich stock for gravy.",
      "If you must butterfly the bird yourself, get the sharpest kitchen shears you can find and patiently snip (it may feel like hacking) down each side of the backbone. A good sharp cleaver or a good sized butcher knife may be necessary to cut into the pelvis, if you're roasting a larger bird. Then cut deeply into aptly-named keel bone between the two breast halves - it does look just like the keel of a ship - which will allow you to flatten the breast. This is important in roasting the bird evenly. Don't worry about removing the keel bone altogether; snipping the cartilage along one side should allow you to spread the two breast halves apart.",
      "Wrap up the turkey back and neck in butcher paper or put them in a plastic bag; refrigerate until you need them. They are perfect for roasting separately, to make gravy.",
      "Blitz the salt in a food processor with the leaves and slender stems of the herbs.",
      "Thoroughly pat the bird dry inside and out, and then rub the salt gently into the skin, using a bit more on the thickest part of the breast. Sprinkle the herbed salt evenly over the inside areas of the turkey as well.",
      "Put the turkey into a large plastic bag, with the two back edges together, so that it looks rather like it did before you removed the backbone. Squeeze out as much air as you can from the bag, and secure it shut. Then, sit the turkey in the bag, breast side up, in a large bowl. Put it in the fridge for three days, rubbing the salt into the skin gently every day, and turning it upside down in the bowl 24 hours before you plan to cook the bird. (I strongly recommend using a bowl because, no matter how good your re-sealable bag may seem, it's likely to leak. So let it leak into the bowl, and not into your vegetable drawer.)",
      "The night before you plan to roast the bird, remove it from the bag, and put it on a large plate with the back pieces together and the breast up. (If your fridge is stuffed, like mine usually is the night before I roast a turkey, you can also wash and dry the bowl to use instead.) Put it in the fridge until an hour before you plan to begin roasting. If you're getting up very early on T-Day, you can do this in the morning, as long as the bird has at least 6 or 7 hours to sit uncovered before you remove it from the fridge.",
      "An hour before you plan to start roasting the turkey, take it out of the fridge and put it on a rack set inside a large roasting pan, spread out of course. Pull the legs forward, as shown in the photo. For some reason, I don't own a decent flat roasting rack, so I set my largest cookie cooling rack on three sturdy stalks of celery, to give it a bit more stability.",
      "Heat your oven to 450\u00b0 Fahrenheit. When it's been at 450\u00b0 for at least 20 minutes, put the turkey in. I usually add about a cup of water, to keep the pan juices from browning too much in the early stages. For a small or medium bird-up to 18 pounds-roast at 450\u00b0 Fahrenheit for 30 minutes, then lower the temperature to 400\u00b0. For larger birds, start at 425\u00b0 degrees and lower it to 375\u00b0. Knock all of these down 25\u00b0 for a convection oven.",
      "The turkey is ready to take out of the oven when a thermometer stuck into the thickest part of the breast, without touching the bone, reaches 150\u00b0 and the thickest part of the thigh hits 165\u00b0. It's okay if the thigh temperature exceeds 165\u00b0; dark meat isn't as noticeably affected as breast meat by a bit of over-cooking.",
      "Figure on roasting the turkey for about 6 minutes per pound, total (including the time at the higher temperature). You may need more than 6 minutes per pound, depending on how true to the dial your oven heats, how often the oven door is open, the temperature of the internal turkey meat when you put the bird in the oven, etc. I heard of one 30-pound turkey needing 3 1/2 hours, while another was ready right at 3. We start with 6 minutes per pound because you can always cook it a bit longer if necessary. You can't do much to fix turkey\r\nmeat that's roasted too long.",
      "Check the internal temperature after the bird has roasted for 4 minutes per pound, e.g., for a 12-pound bird, after 48 minutes. It probably won't be anywhere near done by then, but a smaller bird could be, if the oven is running hot. If you don't have one of those handy-dandy leave-in thermometers that let you know when you've reached the desired temperature, continue to check occasionally. How often you should check depends on the size of the bird, the readings you get, and how hot your oven actually is.",
      "Cover the breast with foil after about 45 - 50 minutes, or whenever it starts to look very dark. I usually pour a glass of white wine over the bird at this point. Then I pour myself one. This is optional but recommended. Based on the comments of others, I suggest putting foil on the legs of larger birds, if the drumsticks seem to be getting too crisp.",
      "Once the internal temperature of the breast at its thickest part has reached 150\u00b0, take your beautiful turkey out of the oven, remove the foil and let that bird rest for at least 30 minutes before carving. An hour of rest works, too, while giving you more time to finish preparing your sides and to enjoy your company.",
      "Meanwhile, use the pan drippings in very small quantities to season your gravy. (The drippings may be too salty to form the basis of your gravy, so unless you have a better method for making gravy, roast that turkey back separately and use its drippings instead. See my \"Make Ahead Turkey Gravy\" recipe for more detailed instructions.)",

Place the butter and chocolate in a small bowl and place in the hot water so that it floats in the hot water without touching the bottom of the pan. After about 10 minutes, remove and stir gently with a spatula. Return to the hot water for about 5 more minutes and stir gently with a spatula. Keep doing this until the chocolate and butter are completely melted and combined. Set aside to cool slightly (As you're doing this be careful not to get any drops of water in the chocolate mixture.)",
      "While the chocolate is melting, place the egg yolks and sugar together in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Beat on high until the mixture becomes slightly thickened and turns a pale yellow (about 4 minutes). Scrape down the bowl, add the salt, vanilla extract and rum. Mix on high for another 2 minutes.",

      "If you are only making this recipe, then you will want around 4 quarts of unshucked clams. The easy direction is to scrub the shells well and steam just until they open. If you are not familiar with clams, and you want more help, then you may want to soak them in a gallon of cool water with about 1/3 cup of kosher salt dissolved (do not use iodized salt!) and 1 cup of cornmeal for 2-3 hours to tease out any sand. Then scrub the shells and rinse clean under cold running water. Discard any that aren't tightly closed. I usually just scrub and steam. Put the clams in a stockpot and cover with cool water. Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Cover the pot and cook just until the quahogs open, about 5 minutes. Don't overcook. Immediately remove the quahogs from the pot. Save the broth to use in a chowder base. When clams are cool, mince into 1/8 to 1/4 inch chunks. Make sure there is no sand in the bellies. Clean and rinse if needed. Sometimes I use more clams and less corn in this recipe. The total combined amount should not exceed 2 cups, but be at least 1 cup.",
      "Mix the eggs, milk, broth, and beer together. Stir in the minced clams and corn. If I have leftover corn on the cob, then I use cooked. If I have fresh corn, then I use it raw off the cob, as long as it is a tender kind of corn.",

These puff up quickly, within 5 minutes. When each has turned golden brown and floats to the top, drain on paper towels. Serve in parchment cones while hot, about 6 per person. I do not like to keep these warm and serve later. So be ready to gobble them right after you cook them. Serve these up plain or with some bread and butter pickles for our odd New England tradition."

      "To a 36\" paella pan, over the appropriate sized heat source- preferably a three ring, 28\" propane fire ring for paella (or a large fire pit if you have experience cooking over an open fire) add your olive oil and a few pinches of salt and saute the extra large prawns until almost done. Remove to a platter",
      "In the same oil saute the squid. if needed add more oil. When done push the squid to the outer edges of the pan.",
      "Add the tomatoes and sliced garlic and saute 10-15 mins over medium heat until the color deepens and most of the liquid has cooked off. Add the smoked paprika. This reduced tomato mixture is called the Sofrito and this is but one version. Note: At the start of this step it is a good idea to determine if your pan is level by watching to see how the tomato liquid sits in the pan. Adjust the pan until this liquid sits evenly in the center of the pan. You could alternately level your pan before you start cooking using a cup of water. Either way it will be harder to deal with after this step and more stuff is added to the pan.",
      "Next add the U16-20 shrimp and gently toss them in the Sofrito you made in step 3 until the shells have just changed color.",
      "Add the lima beans, sugar snaps, and sliced peppers and toss everything together. Let everything get warmed-up and cozy for a few minutes.",
      "Carefully add the stock (and make sure the stock is hot when you do), the minced garlic, parsley, tarragon and saffron. Make a note of the level of the stock in the pan.",
      "Allow the stock to reach a gentle simmer and take in the flavors of all the ingredients for a few minutes. There should be little bubbles everywhere. Now taste it and add salt (and anything else you deem needed) until the stock is flavorful and slighty over-salted (otherwise the final paella will taste under-salted). If the stock taste great at this point the paella should taste just as good! Add a little more stock if a noticeable amount has evaporated, to return the stock to it's original level.",
      "Now sprinkle in the rice and distribute it as evenly as you can. Divide all the ingredients evenly throughout the pan and tease any visible rice into the stock. Wait a few more minutes and sprinkle on the green peas. Do not stir or arrange the rice after this point. From this point on the paella progresses quickly and you should be there to tend it for the next 20-30 mins it will likely take to finish. Have a glass of wine and make sure it is cooking evenly; that the heat is not too high or too low and that nothing is burning.",
      "When the stock appears to have been mostly absorbed start checking for doneness.This is done in three ways: 1. By taking a spoon, pushing it to the bottom of the pan and scraping it back and forth about a 1/4 inch to feel for resistance or rather sticking. Start in the middle of the pan because the sticking usually starts in the middle of the pan 2. Smell for any signs of burnt rice (get your face very close). Hopefully you will never know the smell of burnt rice but sooner or later it will happen if you make a lot of paellas and try to get a socarrat (see next step). Just stop the cooking and finish as you normally would 3. Taste a few grains from the top layer of rice. They should still be a bit under done in the center.",
      "By this point the sound of the paella will also have changed to more of a crackling/sauteing sort of sound. When the very top layer of rice is still a little under done to just done, and you feel resistance from the bottom layer of rice with your spoon over the whole pan, the paella is done and you should even have a nice layer of slightly to very caramelized (but not burnt) rice on the bottom called the Socarrat. Some feel this \"layer\" is the best part of the dish and making a good Socarrat layer, without burning the rice, is considered one of the marks of a well made paella. Tip: If you are using a propane burner made for a paella pan of this size with several rings, once you feel the middle area start to stick on the bottom you can turn off the center ring for the rest of the cooking. This will give the outer areas time to form a socarrat without the center burning. If you are working over a firepit push all the coals out to the edges of the pit. Some books recommend increasing the heat at the end but I would not try this until you have made a lot of paellas(at least 20). The heat can only be raised for a very short time and only at the right moment or you will get burning.",
      "When you feel the paella is done remove it from the heat and decorate the paella with the extra large prawns and mussels. Gently cover everything with a towel(s) for ten minutes to allow the paella to rest and the less done grains of rice on top to finish. Finally remove the towels and finish decorating with the flowers (if you decided to use them). By now your guest will be very hungry!",
      "Serve with lemon wedges and a nice salad. It is always best (and traditional) to sit around a paella and eat it directly from the pan if possible, with each person starting on the outer edge and eating their way toward the center. In this way one can best experience the various layers and textures of rice in a paella. However with a large paella it is fine to serve it on plates. Just remember to scrape up some of that caramaelized rice! If you plan to do this paella for a special event and you don't normally do paella for 33- I'd advise you to make a practice, perhaps smaller version for your friends beforehand. For a smaller paella it is just fine to divide the ingredients and proceed otherwise normally. Remember:Paella is first and foremost a rice dish! Don't worry if some of the vegetables or shrimp come out a little over done by your usual definition. That's actually normal. The rice is the star and everything else is there to make that rice the best it can be. Speaking of rice- Bomba rice is not cheap but it is easy to find on line and it really makes a big difference! I usually by a least a 5kilo bag at the start of the summer but I like to cook for a lot of people (and the price is cheaper per kilo than the one kilo bags). Count on about 1/3 to 1/2 cup of rice per person.",

Mix the yogurt with the soft cheese and dollop onto the veggies. Top with gnocchi, aprox 12 per person for side dish, 6 for appetizer....\r\ndistribute grated hard cheese over all. Place in 275 oven for 25 min on upper third of oven. The gnocchi should puff and slightly brown. My oven is gas and has a high heat top but 5 min under the broiler for most ovens at the end of heating will toast perfectly."

Store the muffin mix in an airtight jar, container, or gallon-sized ziploc bag at room temperature until ready to use. Alternatively, evenly portion the muffin mix into three bags or containers. For one batch of muffins, you'll need 448 grams of muffin mix. (This roughly equals 3 cups minus 1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon, but I'd highly recommend measuring by weight.)",

      "MY FAVORITE VARIATIONS:",

      "For cinnamon-chocolate chunk muffins: add 1 cup chopped dark chocolate (or chips) + 3/4 teaspoon cinnamon to the batter. (Or add 1/4 cup chopped nuts and reduce the chocolate to 3/4 cups!)",
      "For orange, currant, & poppy seed: add 1 tablespoon finely grated orange zest + 1 tablespoon orange juice + 2/3 cup currants + 4 teaspoons poppy seeds.",

      "Mix the flour, 2 teaspoons of the salt, the yeast, honey, and the water until everything begins to form into dough. You can use a mixer if you like, but it's simpler by hand. It'll be a stiff dough, as there's not much water, but this makes it sturdy enough to withstand a dunk in boiling water later. Feel free to add a bit more water if necessary, but you shouldn't need much.",
      "Let the dough rest for 5 minutes while you find a place in your tiny apartment on which to knead.",
      "Knead on a floured surface for about 3 minutes -- the dough will get smooth, a little tacky.",
      "Now put your lovely little dough ball into an oiled bowl, cover it with plastic wrap, and let it hang in the fridge for a few hours, or at least an hour. (I've left it for both 45 minutes and 4 hours, and both batches turned out fine.)",
      "When you're ready to shape the bagels, line a baking sheet with lightly greased parchment paper. Then remove the dough from the fridge, and cut it into 6 or 8 pieces, depending on how large or small you'd like your bagels to be. (I find that 6 pieces yields my kind of bagel: not puny.) Form each piece into a ball, and then each ball into a 10-inch log, with tapered ends. (Don't use any flour on your surface! You'll need the dough to stick just slightly in order for it to change shape.)",
      "To shape the bagels, place one end of one dough log in between your thumb and forefinger, and then wrap it around the rest of your fingers -- the dough ends should overlap by an inch or two -- and squeeze it slightly to bind it together. Once you do this, you can also roll the ends together on a surface to enhance the seal. Extra security is never a bad thing.",
      "Repeat for all of the bagels, then lightly oil them and cover with plastic wrap. Put them in the fridge to proof overnight. Invite guests over for brunch.",
      "About an hour an a half before you want to bake them, pull the bagels out of the fridge to come to room temperature, and fill a large pot (I use a Dutch oven) to at least 4 inches deep. Cover and bring it to a boil. When it boils, add 1 teaspoon of salt and the baking soda, then turn it down to a simmer.",
      "Crank the oven to 500\u00b0 F.",
      "Now test the bagels by using the float test: fill a bowl with cold water, and place one bagel in it. If it floats, they're all ready to go. If not, you haven't failed: just return it to the baking sheet and let proof for 15 to 20 minutes more, then do the test again.",
      "Working in batches that will fit in your pot, carefully drop each bagel into the simmering water, let poach for 1 minute, and flip with a slotted spoon or a spider. Poach 30 seconds more, and then return each bagel to the baking sheet.",
      "And, the fun part: sprinkle your bagels with whatever topping you want. To help your toppings stick, use an egg white wash, but the residual water from the poach should do the trick, too. Seeds are great, as is big flake or rock salt.",
      "You're so close: slip them in the oven and reduce the heat to 450\u00b0 F. Bake for 8 minutes, rotate the sheet, and bake 8 to 12 minutes more, until the bagels are golden brown. Feel free to check the bottom of the bagels as they cook -- if they're getting too brown, just stick another baking sheet underneath them (a baking stone works, too).",
      "Pull them from the oven, and wait an excruciating 30 minutes before you eat them."

Add the onion, garlic, and carrots; cook 2 to 3 minutes, until the onions are lightly golden. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the vegetables to a bowl.",

Raise the heat to high, and let the pot get very hot, so it'll be ready to brown the beef properly. Swirl a bit more oil into the pot, just enough to cover the bottom, if necessary. Add the meat, and cook until deeply browned all over. Transfer the beef to the bowl with the vegetables.",

Sprinkle in the flour, and whisk until the mixture is smooth (this is called making a roux, in case you ever wondered what that term means). Cook, whisking constantly, 1 to 2 minutes, until the color deepens a bit (this cooks the flour so it doesn't add a raw taste to your sauce). Slowly pour in the stock, whisking constantly, until it becomes a slightly thickened gravy.",

In a large mixer bowl, combine the yeast mixture with remaining honey, 1/3 cup olive oil, and eggs. Add the salt and flour, and mix until dough begins to hold together. Switch to a dough hook, and run at low speed for 5 to 8 minutes. Transfer the dough to an olive-oil coated bowl (or rest the dough briefly on the counter and oil your mixer bowl to use for rising, so that you'll use fewer dishes), cover with plastic wrap, and set aside for 1 hour, or until almost doubled in size.",
      "Meanwhile, make fig paste: In a saucepan combine sugar with 1/4 cup water and stir over medium heat until sugar dissolves. Add the figs, red wine, port and cinnamon stick. Bring to a boil and then reduce heat to a simmer and cook until figs are very soft and liquid has reduced by about half (takes about 25-30 minutes). Take figs off the heat and let cool. Take out the cinnamon stick. Once cool, place figs and their liquid in a food processor and process until very smooth. Add the soft butter and process again. Set aside.",
      "Insert filling: After your dough has risen, turn it out onto a floured counter and divide it in half. Roll the first half of the dough into a wide and totally imperfect rectangle (really, the shape doesn't matter). Spread 1/2 cup Nutella evenly over the dough, stopping short of the edge. Repeat with 1/2 cup fig butter and spread evenly over the dough. Roll the dough into a long, tight log, trapping the filling within. Then gently stretch the log as wide as feels comfortable (I take mine to my max counter width, a pathetic three feet), and divide it in half. Repeat with remaining dough,1/2 cup Nutella and 1/2 cup fig butter.",
      "Weave your challah: Arrange two ropes in each direction, perpendicular to each other, like a tight tic-tac-toe board. Weave them so that one side is over, and the other is under, where they meet. So, now you've got an eight-legged woven-headed octopus. Take the four legs that come from underneath the center and move the leg to their right - i.e., jumping it. Take the legs that were on the right and, again, jump each over the leg before, this time to the left. If you have extra length in your ropes, you can repeat these left-right jumps until you run out of rope. Tuck the corners or odd bumps under the dough with the sides of your hands to form a round.",
      "Transfer the dough to a parchment-cover heavy baking sheet, or, if you'll be using a bread stone, a baker's peel. Beat egg until smooth, and brush over challah. Let challah rise for another hour, but 45 minutes into this rise, preheat your oven to 375\u00b0F.",
      "Bake your loaf: Before baking, brush loaf one more time with egg wash and sprinkle with sea salt. Bake in middle of oven for 30 to 40 minutes. It should be beautifully bronzed; if yours starts getting too dark too quickly, cover it with foil for the remainder of the baking time. The very best way to check for doneness is with an instant-read thermometer - the center of the loaf should be 195 degrees. Let cool at least 20 minutes before cutting into it."

Keep an eye on the pot - don't let the dates stick to the bottom! Blend into a smooth sauce. The sauce should be quite thick. Taste for seasoning - if you like things really tart, you might want to add a bit more tamarind paste or if you like things spicy, add a pinch more cayenne powder. Make sure you blend it really, really well. Set aside about 3/4 cup of the sauce in a separate container as we will be using it later to slather on the meat.",

Drizzle with vegetable oil (don't add too much oil as the chicken will also release a lot of fat). Sprinkle the chaat masala over everything and mix well. (The chaat masala already has a lot of salt in it, so you don't need to add any additional salt). Bake for about 45 minutes until the meat and vegetables are cooked through, tossing the vegetables around about half way through.",

(Remember: Your baking sheet should be in the middle rack or the sweet sauce might burn under the broiler!) Broil for about 5 minutes or so, until the edges of the vegetables start charring a bit. Keep checking every minute or so; this is not the time to walk away from the oven!",

Each layer should be wide and long enough to cover the bottom of the pan without leaving any gaps. You need to create a water-tight seal so that when you bake the cheesecake in a hot water bath, none of the liquid seeps into the pan.",
      "In a large bowl, stir together the first 4 ingredients (crust ingredients), then with your hands, press the crust mixture firmly into the bottom of the springform pan. Be careful to make an even, well compacted layer on the bottom of the pan. Chill for 1/2 hour to set the melted butter, and then pre-bake the crust for about 15 minutes in the pre-heated oven to ensure a nice crisp crust. Let cool before filling with the ricotta - cream cheese filling.",
      "For the filling:\r\nIn a small saucepan, combine the honey and the thyme, heat to a gentle simmer and cook/steep for 10 minutes. Pour through a fine mesh strainer into a small bowl to remove the thyme leaves, pressing on the solids to extract all their flavor. Reserve.",
      "Blend the ricotta in a food processor until smooth. Add the cream cheese and sugar and blend well, stopping the machine if needed to scrape down the sides of the bowl. Blend in the thyme infused honey and lemon zest. With the processor running, add the eggs through the feed tube one at a time and process until completely incorporated and the mix is very smooth.\r\n\r\nPour the cheese mix over the cooled ginger snap crust in the springform pan. Place the springform pan in a larger roasting pan, and pour enough hot water into the roasting pan to come halfway up the sides of the springform pan. Bake until the cheesecake is golden and the center of the cake moves only slightly when the pan is gently shaken, about 1 hour.\r\n\r\nRemove the springform pan from the water bath, remove the aluminum foil wrapper and place it on a rack to cool. Once at room temperature, refrigerate until the cheesecake is cold, at least 6 hours, but ideally overnight.",
      "For the sauce:\r\n\r\nHeat the cream, sugar and lavender flowers in a medium sized pan until it simmers. Keeping the heat very low, let it cook-steep for 5 minutes, then strain through a fine mesh strainer into a 2 cup measure to remove the lavender.\r\n\r\nPour the infused cream back into the pan, and heat to simmer. Pull from the heat and add the chopped chocolate. Let it sit for a few minutes to melt, then stir to a sauce consistency. Add the butter, and stir to melt and incorporate. Use warm, or let cool completely. If the sauce is too thick when cooled, reheat gently before serving with the cheesecake.",
      "Once fully chilled, the cheesecake should have pulled away from the side of the pan enough for you to release the springform's side ring and remove it. If necessary, run a thin knife between the pan and the cheesecake to loosen it prior to removing the ring. Serve sliced, with a garnish of fresh fruit and a drizzle of chocolate sauce if desired."

Turn off heat and remove pan from stove to allow to cool.\r\n\r\nNote: It can take a long time for the milk/butter mixture to cool in the pan, so I like to transfer it to the mixer bowl or any other bowl that is already chilled. Keep watch, you want the milk mixture to be at 110 to 115\u00b0 F when you mix in the yeast because it will further activate it. But it can't be warmer than 115, because it will stop growth.",
      "While the milk mixture cools, prepare the yeast: Heat the 1/3 cup of water until it is in the range of 105 to 115\u00b0 F (I tend to get better results when it is closer to 115), add the remaining 1 tablespoon sugar, and mix. Then add the yeast by sprinkling it on top and gradually stirring it in with a spoon. Let it sit for 10 minutes until the yeast is activated or very bubbly/foamy. If yeast did not bubble, it is either bad yeast or the water temperature is not correct and you'll have to do this step over or your rolls will not rise.",
      "Place the milk and butter mixture into a mixing bowl (either part of a mixer or a regular freestanding bowl) if you have not already and add 1 1/2 cups of the flour. Mix first with a spatula or wooden spoon until combined (otherwise it can get messy) and then turn mixer on low (or use a handheld mixer) and mix for about 30 seconds. Halfway through, turn off mixer or handheld mixer and use a spatula to scrape the sides of the bowl back into the center and then continue mixing. It is very important to scrape the bowl occasionally when mixing so everything is combined evenly.",
      "Add the bubbly yeast to the bowl and mix on medium high for 3 minutes. In the meantime, crack eggs and beat with a fork. Then add the eggs to the bowl and mix for 30 seconds, scrape bowl again, and mix another 20 seconds or so. Don't over-mix! You want the eggs to be well mixed in and the batter to be dripping from the mixer attachment as in the picture.",
      "Add 1 cup of flour and mix on low for 10 seconds, just to blend. Now comes the hard part: Adding just the right amount of flour. Add another 1/2 cup and mix another 10 seconds or so. The dough should be getting sticky and heavy. If it is sticking so much that you can't pull it away from the bowl, add another 1/4 cup flour and mix about 5 seconds, just to incorporate. If you are able to pull it off the bowl and if it looks like the dough in the photo, you added enough flour. If it is just too sticky, add another 1/4 cup, but that should do it. The dough should really be sticky and BARELY pulling away from bowl when probed with the spatula.",
      "Scrape dough off of the mixer hook and into the bowl. Pull it off of the bowl and gather into center. Cover with a slightly damp towel or napkin. Let it rise in a warm area (basically room temperature, just not where there is a draft) for 1 hour.",
      "Now, you need to form a fist with your hand and give it one and ONLY onet punch right down the middle. Then remove dough from bowl and place on a lightly floured surface. Pat the dough into a rectangle about 10 inches wide. You'll be surprised how easy it is to work with the dough... it's like Play-Doh!",
      "Now for the fun part! Time to shape your hard work into a roll.\r\n\r\nCut the dough lengthwise in half. Then cut into thirds and then cut all the pieces in half once more, yielding a total of 12 pieces. Try to make them as equal in mass was possible, but it's ok if they are not perfect... someone will get lucky at the dinner table with a bigger roll ;)\r\n\r\nNow pick up each pice of dough and fold it onto itself creating a ball and pinching everything together. This part is hard to explain and takes a little bit of practice, but once you get the hang of it, you'll crave doing it! Just make sure the dough is pinched tightly so no air can escape.",
      "Spray or brush a 9- by 13-Pyrex pan with oil or oil spray (I think canola is the best!). After you shape each roll, arrange them one by one in the pan as in the picture. Cover again with the damp towel and let them rise another half-hour to 45 minutes max. I'm serious! DON'T forget about them or they will get HUGE! Unless you want huge rolls, then do it ;)",
      "You did it! You are ready to bake the rolls! Preheat your oven to 375\u00b0 F.",
      "TO GARLIC THEM: Mix 2 tablespoons melter butter, 3/4 teaspoons granulated garlic, and 1/2 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley in a small bowl. Brush the garlic mixture over the tops of the rolls.",
      "TO PRETZEL: Boil the 1/2 cup water in a small saucepan and add the 1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda. Stir with whisk or spoon until combined, it will bubble vigorously, which is what you want. Brush on the baking soda mixture in a light layer, trying not to get too much of the mixture to drip in pan or rolls will be slightly soggy (not a huge deal). Just coat the top lightly. Then brush the beaten egg over. Sprinkle with some Maldon (the BEST flaky salt on earth!) or kosher salt. It HAS to be thicker than regular tale salt. Also, make slits on top of rolls with a sharp knife in an X pattern. Not necessary, but makes them look like pretzel rolls.",
      "FOR PLAIN ROLLS: Beat 1 egg in a small bowl with 1 teaspoon water. Brush the rolls with egg and sprinkle on salt. (You can also skip this step and just leave them as is: I like the egg wash, my hubby like them better without.)",
      "Bake the rolls in preheated oven for 15 to 20 minutes. It usually takes mine about 19 minutes, but start checking them after 15, because all ovens are different. You want the tops to be a perfectly even golden brown, like in the pictures.",

    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "Make a simple syrup by combining 1/2 cup water, 3/4 cup sugar and a pinch each of salt and cardamom in a medium sauce pan over medium heat. When all of the sugar is dissolved, remove the pan from the heat. \r\n\r\nFill a second saucepan half full of water and two pinches of salt and put it over medium high heat and bring it to a boil. You need to blanche each slice of grapefruit in this water for about 3 minutes a piece to take a bit of the bitterness out of the pith. The typically white pith turns transclucent after about 3 minutes and, as far as I can tell, signals that much of the bitterness has been zapped. \r\n\r\nGently remove the grapefruit slices from the boiling water and place them into the hot syrup, taking care to make sure all of the slices are submerged in the syrup. \r\n\r\nSet the pan aside to cool for at least an hour (these can sit in the syrup for quite a while -- even overnight -- and get sweeter the longer they are sitting in there.)",
      "To make the curd, combine the eggs and the egg yolks in a small boil and beat them until they are a solid yellow color. Put eggs, 1/4 cup white sugar, grapefruit juice, corn starch and a pinch of salt into a medium saucepan and whisk the ingredients together well.Put the pan over medium low heat and stir it until it thickens and looks like, well, curd. The temp should be about 170 degrees in order for it not to taste like raw eggs. When it hits that point, whisk in the three tablespoons of butter, one at a time. Push the curd through a fine mesh strainer to get the white stringy bits out. If you are in a hurry cool the curd in a bowl over an ice bath. Store the curd in the fridge while you make the crust. It thickens considerably as it sits in there.",
      "To make the crust combine flour, 1 cup unsalted butter cubes, brown sugar, vanilla and cardamom (if desired) in the bowl of a food processor and pulse until the mixture forms a dough ball on the top of the blade.",
      "Butter the inside of the tartlet pans (life is much easier if you've got the kind with the removable bottoms!). Divide the dough among the eight pans (or just plop it in the middle of the big one if you are going that route) and press the dough to fit the pan, taking care to have it be pushed well into the ridge sides so that you can press around the edge and have a nice, squared off top edge. You only need a thin crust on the bottom. Put the pans in the fridge for 15-20 minutes to set. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Bake the tartlets for 12-14 minutes until they are nicely browned (the big tart might take upwards of 20 minutes). No worries about the middles rising up at around 3-4 minutes as they fall back into place around the 10-minute mark. Remove from the oven and set them on racks to cool completely.",
      "To caramelize your candied grape fruit slices (which I do right before I assemble them so they are still a bit warm and crackly), pull them out of the syrup and spread them out on a rack placed on top of a baking sheet. Sprinkle them all liberally with white sugar on both sides. \r\n\r\nIf you have a torch and like the power that gives you, singe the top face of each grape fruit slice like you would a creme brule. No torch? Just put them under your broiler to the same effect. But just a note of caution for the latent pyros that lurk in all of us, just singe the pulp of the grape fruit and not the rind. Singing the rind makes it bitter and you just spent a chunk of your life trying to make these things less bitter.\r\n\r\nUse a sharp knife to cut each one into bite-sized segments. If you are serving a crowd who is generally afraid of a bit of bitterness, you can cur the segments between the membranes, leaving the membranes on the cutting board. But that is very fiddly, so you really have to love them to to that.",
      "To assemble these tarts, take a shell, fill it with curd (not too much as the weight of the grape fruit will cause a little spread), arrange the candied grapefruit on top. These do best if you leave them in the fridge to set up before serving."

When you have a nice brown crust, flip them over and season liberally with salt. Sear for another 4 to 6 minutes, long enough to form a brown crust on the other side. Turn the heat down and cook a little longer to the desired internal temperature. I like my steak at medium-rare, so it's just a few more minutes depending on the thickness of the steak.",

Slice the steak in 1-inch wide pieces (if you slice the steak at an angle it will look prettier as you will show the contrast between pink inside and crusty brown outside) and arrange on the platter with the endive. Pour the cooking sauces over it all and garnish with a dollop of the creme fraiche horseradish sauce, passing more at the table."

Roll each piece out into a thin coil, twist the coil around your hands into a knot, and place on a lightly greased baking sheet.",

Place the dough into a covered/oiled bowl and leave for 2 hours in a warm-ish place. After this time, take the dough and quickly knead it again (knock-back) for about 30 seconds. From here, roll it into balls. I made 2 from this mixture but you could easily make 4 smaller ones. Cover the balls and leave for another hour. After this, you will need to steam the buns over the highest heat on the hob for about 8-10 minutes depending on the size of the bao.",

Then add 1/3 of the remaining egg whites, sift in 1/3 of the remaining flour, fold until partially blended, and repeat. Then add the last of each and half of the tepid, melted butter. When partially blended, fold in the rest of the butter but omit the milky residue at the bottom of the pan. Do not overmix; the egg whites must retain as much volume as possible.",

The cake is done when it has puffed, is lightly brown, and has just begun to show a faint line of shrinkage from the edge of the pan. (I think this last indicator is really key; it's a helpful visual cue to look for.)

Cook on each side for a minute or two until bread is colored a lovely golden brown. Remove bread from pan and while it is still warm, rub both sides of bread with garlic cloves. Let bread cool on a plate or cutting board. When cool, slice bread into bite sized pieces. You should have roughly 12 croutons. Set aside.",

Add basil to bowl.",

I use the Alice Waters method of making a vinaigrette. First, add vinegars to a small jar. Then add a three-finger pinch of sea salt to jar. Put lid on jar and shake thoroughly to dissolve salt. (Adding the salt at this point rather than later, helps tame the astringency of the vinegars.) Remove lid and add honey, remaining 3 tablespoons olive oil, garlic salt, and a grind of freshly ground black pepper to jar. Top with lid again. Shake jar, then taste vinaigrette and adjust seasonings, if flavors do not seem balanced. Add small amounts of salt, honey, olive oil or vinegar, if needed. Pour dressing over tomatoes, cucumbers and herbs.",

      "I cannot help myself but I need to make Julia's onions and mushrooms with this. No tampering with these recipes. This is when I do it.",
      "After three hours, the meat will be falling off the bones (if you left the bones on) and the meat will be incredibly tender. Strain the mixture over a large bowl. Pick the meat and those vegetables still intact out of the strainer and return to the casserole. Toss the herb sprigs and bay leaves and any bones that may have separated.",
      "Check out the sauce in the bowl. It should be rich and thick enough to coat a spoon. It almost always is. Decant the sauce into one of those handy fat separator measuring cups and pour the defatted sauce into the casserole (or else just tilt the bowl and try to spoon out any extra fat that rises to the top). If the sauce looks a little thin to you and you are feeling particularly virtuous, pour the sauce into a sauce pan and reduce it at high temperature for a few minutes. But don't obsess about it, it will taste delicious anyway. Return the casserole to the oven on warm - about 170 degrees - until you are ready to eat."

    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "Separate the ramps, bulbs and white parts from the leaves. Very finely mince the bulbs and white parts and coarsely chop the greens. Set greens aside. In a small saute pan, heat the olive oil until shimmering. Briefly saute the ramp bulbs until just fragrant, about 45-60 seconds. Set aside to cool.",
      "Add flour to your food processor, along with the ramp greens. Pulse until the flour starts to turn a little green from the ramps, about 8-10 1-second pulses. Add eggs and yolks, as well as the salt and the sauteed ramp bulbs and process until dough just comes together, about 20-30 second. Transfer dough to a well-floured surface. Knead until smooth and elastic, 5 to 8 minutes. Place on a piece of parchment, and cover with an inverted bowl, or wrap tightly in plastic; let rest for 1 to 2 hours. At this point, the pasta dough can be refrigerated for up to 48 hours, tightly wrapped in plastic wrap. Let it come back to room temperature before rolling.",
      "Divide the dough into four equal portions. Dust the portions with flour and cover with a clean dishtowel. From this point on, keep everything well-floured to prevent the pasta from sticking to itself or the roller as you work. If the dough starts to feel sticky as you roll it, sprinkle it with flour. Also sprinkle flour on any pasta you're not working (rolled, cut or otherwise) with and keep it covered with a dishtowel. Set your pasta machine to the thickest setting (usually marked \"1\"). Flatten one piece of dough into a thick disk between your hands and feed it through the pasta roller. Repeat once or twice. Fold this piece of dough into thirds, like folding a letter, and press it between your hands again. With the pasta machine still on the widest setting, feed the pasta crosswise between the rollers. Feed it through once or twice more until smooth. Begin changing the settings on your roller to roll the pasta thinner and thinner. Roll the pasta two or three times at each setting, and don't skip settings (the pasta tends to snag and warp if you do). If the pasta gets too long to be manageable, lay it on a cutting board and slice it in half. Roll the pasta as thin as you like to go. For fettuccini, I normally go to 6. Cut the long stretch of dough into noodle-length sheets, usually about 12-inches. Switch from the pasta roller to the noodle cutter, and run the sheet of pasta through the cutter. Toss the fettuccine with a little flour to keep them from sticking and gather them into a loose basket and cover with a towel while you finish rolling and cutting the rest of the dough.",
      "Bring a large pot of water to a boil, salt the water, and cook the pasta until al dente, 3-4 minutes. While the water is coming up to a bowl, finely mine the remaining ramp (both bulb and leaves) and the pancetta. In a medium pan over medium heat, render the pancetta. Once the pasta is cooked, drain and add to the saute pan, flipping and tossing to coat the noodles with the pancetta fat. Add approximately half of the parmesan and flip a few times. Plate 4 portions of pasta with the pancetta sprinkled evenly over all the portions, then sprinkle with remaining Parmesan and ramps. Serve immediately."

You want to create an herb- scented broth, as well as the caramelized juices released by the squash.",

Remove from heat and allow to cool for 10 minutes.\r\n\r\nReturn the seasoned breadcrumbs back to the food processor, adding everything from the pan, including the herbs and garlic to the food processor bowl.

Some of the meatballs may stick, so use a flexible spatula or spoon to nudge the meatball from underneath.

If the pan is not wide enough to cook all of the meatballs at once, sear the meatballs in batches.",

Reduce the heat to a low simmer, shift the lid to allow steam to escape, and cook for 30 minutes. Add salt and pepper to taste. Carefully stir without breaking the meatballs, and adjust the seasoning as needed.\r\n\r\nCover the pot, lid ajar, and continue to simmer for 2 hours. The sauce will reduce and thicken. Adjust seasoning as needed.",

It may take less time for this batch of syrup to become darker. Pour this syrup immediately into the apple mixture, and stir the mixture well. Don't worry if the caramel seizes a bit - keep stirring and the caramel with soften and meld with the apple mixture. Allow to cook for another 15 minutes, stirring constantly.",
      "Depending on the apples you use, some of the chopped apples make break down towards the end of the cooking process. If that is NOT the case, take a potato masher, and smash about 50% of the apples in the mixture - retaining some pieces for chunkiness, but allowing half of the mixture to take on a jam-like texture. At this point, almost all liquid should be evaporated.",
      "Fill jam jars, making sure that you pack the jam well, and process in a hot water bath according to your preferred instructions. I process for 15 minutes. Take out of the hot water bath, wait for the \"ping\" sound that indicates that the jams are sealed, and allow jams to sit for a day.

Spread the Champagne mousse over the peach chiffon filling and refrigerate the pie until it is cold and set, about 4 hours (or up to overnight), before serving. (Store any leftovers in the refrigerator.) The pie is best eaten within 2 days."

Saute the sliced onions in the olive oil for a few minutes until they are a bit tender, and then I add the tomatoes and let them cook together over a medium heat for a few minutes, stirring frequently. Then add the blistered Padron peppers (whole), and just a tiny amount of tomato paste.",

(Once again, check your instant-read thermometer; the internal temperature of the pie should read 205 degrees.) If the edges of the pie begin to brown too much during baking, you can cover the edge of the pie with aluminum foil strips. Aunt Chick and Jessie both indicate in the recipe that the pie is \"jelled\" when it's time to remove it from the oven. The pie must rest for several hours before slicing. Torturous, but well worth it."

Add an additional 2-1/2 cups of flour and, using the dough hook, knead the bread on medium speed for about 5 minutes or until the bread starts to become stretchy.

Fold the dough once more and gently form it into a loaf-shaped log. Place the dough into a greased loaf pan (8.5\" X 4.5\" X 2.75\") and cover loosely with plastic wrap.

Cool in the pan on a cooling rack for ten minutes and then remove each loaf from the pan to continue cooling on their own. Once cooled completely, wrap in a bread bag or a large sheet of aluminum foil to keep fresh! Loaves can be frozen after baking if desired."

If the water seems to be evaporating before the carrots are close to being done, you can add a little more. At the same time, if the carrots seem to be getting too done, remove them from the pan. Reduce the glaze, and then at the end, add the carrots back to warm them and to cook the lettuce.",

It is timing, and you can always use a toothpick to test the fattest part of the carrot-it should yield with pressure. As the water gets close to being gone, add the lettuce. Let the lettuce wilt and get soft (this will only take about 30 seconds). You want it to be vibrant green but tender like cooked spinach. Taste and adjust the seasoning.

      "-SLICE-\r\nThinly slice your oranges, aiming for slices about 1/4 inch thick. \r\n\r\nUse the poles of each orange (the top and bottom wedges that are difficult to continue slicing thinly) to make half slices, rather than complete circular ones.",
      "-BLANCH-\r\nBlanch the orange slices. Immerse slices in a pot of boiling water for 30 seconds, then transfer to an ice bath. \r\n\r\nThe reason for blanching is to remove some of the bitterness from the citrus pith. If the pith is thicker (ie: grapefruit in comparison to clementine), repeat this step one or two more times.",
      "-MAKE SUGAR SOLUTION-\r\nIn a saucepan, bring the 3 cups of water to a low boil. Lower the heat and begin to stir or whisk in the sugar. Add sugar gradually and in batches. Once sugar is fully dissolved, add the blanched orange slices.",
      "-COOK SLICES-\r\nSimmer the orange slices in the sugar solution over low heat, taking care to keep the syrup from reaching a boil. All slices should be immersed in the solution. If you are using a smaller pan, and the slices are forced to overlap, simply turn them over several times during the cooking process.",
      "-GET READY TO DRY-\r\nWhile the slices cook, prepare a wire cooling rack over a sheet of parchment paper. If you don't have a wire rack, simply set up a double layer of parchment paper on which you can let the slices cool.",
      "-FINISH COOKING SLICES-\r\nCook slices until translucent. Depending on their thickness, this could take anywhere from 30 to 90 minutes. \r\n\r\nI found that an easy way to test their translucence, without the disturbance of removing them from the solution, was to gently slip a dark, metal slotted spoon under the slice. If I could see the spoon (however opaquely) through the pith, the slice was done. \r\n\r\nWhen done, remove slices and set on wire rack/parchment paper to cool and dry.",
      "-STORE SIMPLE SYRUP-\r\nAfter removing the slices from the solution, pour the syrup into a clean glass container (i.e. a mason jar, a well washed glass bottle). \r\n\r\nTo facilitate this transfer, and keep from spilling sugar water all over my kitchen, I made a simple funnel out of parchment paper. Fold a long sheet of paper in half (so that it is doubly thick) and roll into a cone, keeping a hole at the tip slightly smaller than the mouth of your glass bottle. Use tape to secure the paper in this shape. Place the bottle or jar at the base of your sink, hold the paper funnel in place with one hand, and pour the syrup out of the saucepan with the other. \r\n\r\nAllow the syrup to cool slightly before capping the bottle or jar. If it is too hot, the contained pressure (from sealing the top of the container) could potentially break the glass.",
      "-DEHYDRATE SLICES- \r\nAfter letting slices sit at room temperature for several hours, place on fresh paper or clean rack atop a baking sheet and transfer to an oven preheated to the lowest allowed setting. For me, this was 175. Allow slices to dehydrate in the oven for several more hours. Check occasionally (every 1/2 to 1 hour) and test stickiness by lightly pressing the top of the slices with your finger. Turn over slices that are no longer tacky to touch and return pan to oven. \r\n\r\nDehydration serves as a way to further preserve the slices by removing the excess water. Additionally, it keeps them from sticking together when stored. The resulting pieces are still chewy and flexible (think fruit leather), but less so than if they were not dehydrated and rather tossed with additional sugar once dry, as is often done with candied orange peels.",
      "-STORE SLICES- \r\nOnce dehydrated, the orange slices can be stored more or less indefinitely. Mine have always been consumed within the first few months, so I can't speak from experience, but other sources have cited anywhere from 6 months to a year when kept in a cool, dry place. \r\n\r\nFor personal use, I suggest a glass container such as a mason jar. As long as the slices are no longer sticky, the glass will keep them protected from moisture and humidity.\r\n\r\nIf you wish to share the candied slices with a friend, an easy, pretty way of presenting them is layered between sheets of parchment paper. Cut circles from the paper slightly larger than the circumference of the slices, and stack the oranges on top of the. Make sure there is a paper circle on the top and the bottom of the stack, and tie with twine the way you would tie ribbon on a present. A stack of 6-10 slices should fit perfectly in one of the smaller mason jars, keeping the candied protected in transit and allowing the recipient to store any (hypothetical and unlikely) leftovers."

Cover the bowl with a dry kitchen towel and put it in a warm place and let the dough rise until it doubles in size, about 1 hour 15 minutes.",

This will be messy and you will probably want to open a window, but it really makes a difference in terms of flavor. If its summer and you have an outdoor grill, you may as well do this out there. The eggplant should be soft and blackened on the outside after you've roasted it. This takes about 10 minutes.",

      "Divide batter evenly into pans. Arrange red and green cherries and/or nuts decoratively on top of batter, if desired. Bake on the middle rack of the oven for 2 hours, checking for doneness after 1 hour and 30 minutes. The cakes will show cracks and will have risen slightly; a skewer inserted through a crack should come out fairly clean, with no wet dough clinging to it. Let cakes cool about 20 minutes in pans, then remove from pans and allow to cool completely before removing parchment and wrapping cakes very tightly in plastic. Store at a cool room temperature."
