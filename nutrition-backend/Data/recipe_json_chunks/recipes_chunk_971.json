      "Preheat oven to 400&deg;F.",
      "Remove the green outer leaves from the cauliflower as well as the thick white stalk, taking care not to break off the florets. Cut a deep cross in the bottom of the stem and steam it whole over a pan of boiling water until slightly tender but not cooked through. The cauliflower florets should still be firm. Remove the cauliflower from the heat and leave to cool.",

Remove 1 tablespoon of the leeks and keep to one side. Add the flour to the remaining leeks in the pan and stir. The flour will become lumpy, but continue to stir for 2 - 3 minutes. This will cook the flour and soften it to make a better sauce. Add the large pinch of salt and the mustard powder and stir again. Turn up the heat to medium and add the milk all at once. Stir briskly until a smooth sauce forms. Continue stirring until the sauce is thick and glossy - about 4 - 5 minutes. If the sauce thickens too much, add a little more milk. It should be thick, but still a bit runny. At this point, add the grated cheese and stir until melted. Remove from heat.",
      "Break or cut the cauliflower florets away from the thick, central stalk, taking care not to break it into tiny pieces. Place these florets in a greased baking dish large enough to hold all the florets in just one layer. Pour the cheese and leek sauce over the cauliflower making sure to cover all the florets. Sprinkle the extra grated cheese evenly over the top and scatter the reserved softened leeks over the top as well. Finally, grate some fresh pepper over the top.",
      "Bake in the preheated oven until the sauce is bubbling and golden brown on the top, approximately 20 minutes. Test the cauliflower to make sure it's cooked through by piercing with a sharp pointed knife, cook a little longer if necessary. Serve warm."

(You can peel before you cook if you prefer. I tend to peel some while waiting on the water, and the rest after. You can even skip this step by buying pre-cooked shrimp, but I find they often taste a little funky.).",
      "Bring hot water, sufficient to cover the mussels, to boil. Drop in the mussels -- there were enough of these that I divided the lot and did this step twice -- and let them cook. When foam starts rising, after about 3 minutes, you can reduce the heat to a strong simmer, and fish out (using tongs) the mussels whose shells are opening, and place in a separate bowl. By seven minutes, all the mussels that will open should have done so, unless your pot was too tightly packed. Run cold water over the retrieved mussels. Best is to put the mussels in a bowl that is directly under running cold water as you retrieve them. Discard any mussels that do not open. The opening size should be over 1/8th inch for it to count for something I'd serve to others, not to mention eat myself.",

      "Dressing: the juice of 1.5 large lemons (slice lemons into segments and squeeze, removing seeds as you go). Add the vinegar and the olive oil, mix, and pour over your salad. Toss the salad up. Try to get everything coated, lightly. Feel free to add a little bit more of the oil and the vinegar, if you think this needs.",
      "Optional garnish at the end: 1 tomato (from a roadside stand, a farmer's market, or your own garden, NOT the supermarket) sliced and laid invitingly atop the salad."

      "Reduce the heat to low, so that you barely hear hissing from the pot. Cook for 45 minutes.",
      "Release the pressure using the cooker's release device (read the manual!) or cool the cooker by running cold water over the lid for 5 minutes. Open carefully. Remove the hen from the broth and set aside to cool. The meat should be tender and falling away from the bone. Once the hen is cool enough to handle, pull the meat from the bones in small pieces, cover and set aside. Discard the skin and bones.",
      "Set a cheesecloth-lined colander in a shallow, wide, 6-quart pot and strain the broth, discarding the solids. Taste and season the broth with additional salt, if needed.",
      "Put 1/2 cup of the broth, the butter, and remaining 1/2 teaspoon of salt in a 2-quart saucier, set over high heat, and bring to a boil. As soon as it boils, add all of the flour at once and stir with a wooden spoon until the mixture starts to come together, approximately 1 minute. Decrease the heat to low and continue stirring until the mixture forms a ball and is no longer sticky, approximately 3 minutes. Transfer the mixture to a medium bowl and mix, on low speed, for 5 minutes with an electric hand mixer. Beat until cool and there is no more steam rising. Continue to mix on low, and add the eggs, 1 at a time, making sure each is completely incorporated before adding another. You may need to stop occasionally and scrape down the sides of the bowl. Before adding the last egg, check the mixture for consistency: It should tear slightly as it falls from the beater, creating a \"V\" shape. Transfer the dough to a 1-gallon resealable plastic bag. Cut off 1 corner of the bag to make a quarter-sized opening.",
      "Bring the broth to a slight simmer over medium heat. Pipe 1-inch of the mixture and cut with kitchen shears directly over the broth. Repeat with the remaining batter. Cook, covered, until the dumplings are cooked through, about 8 to 10 minutes. Turn off the heat, add the meat and wait for 2 to 3 minutes before serving. Serve in bowls with freshly ground black pepper."

      "10 TIPS FOR PERFECT RISOTTO FROM USA RICE:",
      "Choose the right rice. Risotto is best with U.S. Arborio or medium grain rice. The starch in these grains absorbs flavors easily and takes on a creamy texture.",
      "Use a heavy pan with a thick bottom and sides to help distribute heat evenly. Make sure it's large enough to hold the cooked rice. The rice will expand to about three times its original volume.",
      "Don't rinse the rice. This removes the starch which gives risotto its wonderful creamy consistency.",
      "Saute the rice in butter or oil. This coats each grain, allowing the rice to slowly absorb moisture and resulting in a creamier risotto.",
      "Use a simple, dry white wine. Sauvignon Blanc or Chardonnay always works well in risotto recipes. Risotto dishes also pair well with these wines.",
      "Keep the broth at a simmer when adding to the rice. Hot broth keeps the temperature at a more constant level, ensuring even and continuous cooking.",
      "Add broth one cup at a time, allowing the broth to fully absorb before adding more. The gradual addition of broth and slow cooking helps produce creamy risotto.",
      "Stir often. This keeps the grains in contact with the liquid for even cooking, prevents the rice from sticking to the bottom of the pan, and helps to develop a creamy consistency.",
      "Get creative! Stir in additions such as asparagus, peas, cooked shellfish, ham or mushrooms at the end for a hearty, delicious risotto.",
      "Risotto is done when the rice is al dente -- creamy, yet firm in the center. Never let rice dry out when making risotto. For a creamy texture, the rice should always -- from start to finish -- be kept under a \"veil\" of broth."

    "title": "pumpkin pie made from a real pumpkin",
    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "Pie pumpkins \"are smaller, sweeter, less grainy textured pumpkins than the usual jack-o-lantern types. Grocery stores usually carry them in late September through December in the U.S. Note: the Libby's can of cooked pumpkin is just there for reference - it is the small can, so that gives you an idea of the size of a typical pie pumpkin. They're only about 6 to 8 inches in diameter (about 20 to 24 inches in circumference). If you're in a pinch and can't find a pie pumpkin, here's a tip: butternut squash taste almost the same! Commercial canned pumpkin is from a variety of butternut, not true pumpkins! If you DO use a regular Jack O' Lantern type pumpkin, you may need to add about 25% more sugar and run the cooked pumpkin through a blender or food processor to help smooth it out.",
      "Just like selecting any squash, look for one that is firm, no bruises or soft spots, and a good orange color. One 6\" pie pumpkin usually makes one 10 inch deep dish pie and a bit extra; or 2 9 inch shallow pies!",
      "Wash the exterior of the pumpkin in cool or warm water, no soap.",
      "Cut the pumpkin in half. A serrated knife and a sawing motion works best - a smooth knife is more likely to slip and hurt you! A visitor suggests using a hand saw.",
      "And scrape the insides. You want to get out that stringy, dangly stuff that coats the inside surface. I find a heavy ice cream scoop works great for this.",
      "Note: SAVE THE SEEDS:",
      "The seeds can be used either to plant pumpkins next year, or roasted to eat this year! Place them in a bowl of water and rub them between your hands. then pick out the orange buts (throw that away) and drain off the water. Spread them out on a clean towel or paper towel to dry and they're ready to save for next year's planting or roast.",
      "There are several ways to cook the pumpkin; just choose use your preferred method. Most people have microwaves and a stove, so I'll describe both of those methods here. But others make good arguments in favor of using a pressure cooker or baking in the oven. At the end of this document, I've included alternative instructions to replace step 4, if you'd rather use a different method.",
      "Method 1 - Put it in a microwaveable bowl.",
      "Remove the stem, and put the pumpkin into a microwaveable. You may need to cut the pumpkin further to make it fit. The fewer the number of pieces, the easier it will to scoop out the cooked pumpkin afterwards.",
      "Put a couple of inches of water in the bowl, cover it, and put in the microwave.",
      "Method 2 - Steam on the stovetop.",
      "You can also cook it on the stovetop; it takes about the same length of time in a steamer (20 to 30 minutes). I use a double pot steamer, but you could use an ordinary large pot with a steamer basket inside.",
      "Either way, cook for 15 minutes on high, check to see if it is soft, then repeat in smaller increments of time until it is soft enough to scoop the innards out. Normally it takes 20 or 30 minutes in total.",
      "Whether you cook the pumpkin on the stove, microwave, or even the oven, once it is cooked until it is soft, it is easy to scoop out the guts with a broad, smooth spoon, (such as a tablespoon). Use the spoon to gently lift and scoop the cooked pumpkin out of the skin. It should separate easily an in fairly large chucks, if the pumpkin is cooked enough.",
      "Many times the skin or rind will simply lift off with your fingers. I'll bet you didn't realize making your own pumpkin glop -- err, \"puree\" was this easy!",
      "Note: there are many varieties of pumpkin and some make better pies that other (due to sugar content, flavor, texture and water content. Drier, sweeter, fine-grained pies; the small (8\" across) ones called \"pie pumpkins\" are best.",
      "Watery pumpkin?.",
      "If your pumpkin puree has standing, free water, you may want to let it sit for 30 minutes and then pour off any free water. That will help prevent you pie from being too watery! Beyond, that, I have not found that the water makes a difference - I wouldn't be TOO concerned about it!",
      "Tip from a visitor: \"I make my own pumpkin pies from scratch all the time. To eliminate watery pumpkin I strain my pureed pumpkin through a cloth overnight. If I use frozen pumpkin I do the same again as it thaws out. It works great and my pies cook beautifully.\".",
      "Another visitor reported success using coffee filters in a sieve to drain out excess water.",
      "Again, don't go to great lengths to remove water; the recipe accounts for the fact that fresh pumpkin is more watery than canned!",
      "To get a nice, smooth consistency, I use a Pillsbury hand blender. By blending it, you give the pie a smooth, satiny texture; rather than the rough graininess that is typical of cooked squashes.",
      "A regular blender works, too (unless you made a few frozen daiquiris and drank them first.). Or a food processor or even just a hand mixer with time and patience.",
      "With the hand blender, it just takes 2 or 3 minutes!",
      "Another visitor says using a food mill, like a Foley Food Mill, with a fine screen, accomplishes the blending/pureeing very well, too!",
      "The pumpkin is now cooked and ready for the pie recipe. Get the frozen daiquiris out from step 7 and take a break! :) You may freeze the pie filling.",
      "Yes, I know there are ready-made pie crusts in the frozen section at the store, but they really are bland and doughy. A flaky crust is easy to make! Again, note that unless you use large, deep dish pie plates, you may have enough for 2 pies.",
      "It is also time to start preheating the oven. Turn it on and set it to 425\u00b0F (210\u00b0C, for those in Europe) (see my pie crust recipe).",
      "All the hard work is behind you! Here's where it gets really easy. If you start with a fresh 8\" pie pumpkin, you will get about 3 cups of cooked, mashed pumpkin. The right amount of ingredients for this is as follows:",
      "1 cup sugar - or 1 cup Splenda, or 3/4 cup honey (honey may make a heavier pie, though).",
      "1.5 teaspoon ground cinnamon.",
      "1 teaspoon ground cloves.",
      "1 teaspoon ground allspice.",
      "one half teaspoon ground ginger.",
      "one half teaspoon salt (optional, I don't use any).",
      "4 large eggs.",
      "3 cups pumpkin glop (ok -- \"sieved, cooked pumpkin\").",
      "1.5 cans (12oz each) of evaporated milk (I use the nonfat version).",
      "Mix well using a hand blender or mixer.",
      "Notes: The vast majority of people tell me this is the best pumpkin pie they've ever had. It's light and fluffy - however -- if you want a heavy, more dense pie, use 3 eggs instead of 4 and 1 can of evaporated milk instead of 1.5).",
      "like a deep, full pie, so I fill it right up to about one quarter to one half inch from the very top.",
      "Don't be surprised if the mixture is very runny! It may start as a soupy liquid, but it will firm up nicely in the oven! Note: the pie crust is brown because I used whole wheat flour! Tastes the same, but is healthier.",
      "TIP: What do you do if you end up with more filling than will fit in your pie crust(s)? Easy! Of course, you can make another, smaller pie crust and fill a small pie pan -- or just grease any baking dish, of a size that the extra filling will fill to a depth of about 2 inches (see the photo at right), and pour the extra filling inches then bake it. It will be a crustless pumpkin pie that kids especially love!",
      "Bake at 425\u00b0F (210\u00b0C ) for the first 15 minutes, then turn the temperature down to 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C) and bake another 45 to 60 minutes, until a clean knife inserted into the center comes out clean.",
      "And enjoy! Warm or chilled, with whipped cream , ice cream or nothing at all - it's great!",
      "I use a blunt table knife to test the pie. The one at left has already been stuck in the pie, and you see it comes out pretty clean, when the pie is done."

      "Cut the kernels from the cobs as near to the core as possible. You should have 4 cups of kernels.",
      "Put the kernels into the blender with the water and salt and grind them until they are very smooth. It will be much easier to do in 2 lots. You will have to keep stopping the blender and releasing the blades; but do not add more water.",
      "Making the uchepos: Smear a thin coating of the corn mixture over the broadest part of the cornhusk, allowing for turning down about 1 1/2-inches at the bottom broad part of the husk and about 3-inches high at the pointed top. Fold the sides of the husk together firmly. Turn up the pointed end of the leaf and fold the broader over it.",
      "Cooking the uchepos: The most convenient way to cook uchepos is with a conventional steamer. Fill the bottom of the steamer with water up to the level indicated and bring it to a boil. Line the top of the steamer with cornhusks, covering the bottom and sides well. Stack the uchepos upright. For the best results, they should be packed firmly but not too tightly, because the husks swell out as the dough cooks.",
      "Cover the uchepos with more cornhusks. Cover the top of the steamer with a thick cloth a piece of old toweling is best to absorb the condensation from the lid of the steamer. Cover the steamer with a tightly fitting lid.",
      "As the water in the bottom part comes to a boil, put a coin into it, put the top part of the steamer on, and let the uchepos cook for about 2 1/2 to 3 hours over a medium flame. Keep the water bubbling, but not boiling violently. That is the reason for the coin. You will be able to hear it dancing about, and it will tell you if the water goes off the boil or is getting dangerously low. It the water is allowed to go off the boil the uchepos will be heavy. Keep a kettle of water simmering so that you can refill the steamer when necessary.",
      "To test the uchepos for doneness, remove 1 from the center, and 1 from the side of the steamer. As you open the husks, the dough should come away easily from the husks and be completely smooth. To make doubly sure, open up the uchepos and see if they are spongy and well cooked throughout.",
      "I serve them with sour cream and salsa, red or green, whatever you prefer."

      "Preheat oven to 100\u00b0C - 120\u00b0C Do not use the oven fan if possible.",
      "Beat the four egg whites with the cream of tartar using an electric mixer. Bring to 'soft peak' stage.",
      "Add 1/3 of the sugar and continue to beat to 'firm peak' stage- approx another 3 minutes. Then add the remaining sugar one spoon at a time whilst continuing to beat.",
      "Continue beating until the mixture is shiny and the sugar has totally dissolved. Feel the meringue mix with your fingertips and you should not be able to feel any gritty sugar. Continue to beat until the sugar has dissolved, if required.",
      "Sift the cornflour over the meringue and add the vinegar. Fold in gently.",
      "Use a spoon or pipe the mixture to form meringues onto a cookie tray lined with baking paper.",
      "Bake approx 60 minutes, or until firm and dry. During cooking reduce the oven temperature if the meringues are browning rather than drying out. When cooked, turn the oven off and leave the oven door slightly ajar. Allow the meringues to cool in the oven for about an hour, or leave overnight.",
      "Store in an airtight container. They should keep at least a few days.",
      "____VARIATIONS ____.",
      "Flavoured meringues-add some vanilla or other essence of your choice whilst folding in the cornflour.",
      "Coloured meringues- add some food colouring of your choice and beat through before folding in the cornflour.",
      "Chocolate meringues- sift in 2 tablespoons of Dutch cocoa with the cornflour. You can also add ground or finely chopped nuts if desired.",
      "Coconut meringues- lightly fold through 1/2 cup of shredded or dessicated coconut with the cornflour.",
      "Almond meringues- fold through 1/2 cup ground almonds with the cornflour. You can also add some almond essence if desired.",
      "Lime or Lemon Meringues- fold through finely zested lime or lemon zest with the cornflour. A teaspoon of juice can be used instead of/substitute for the white vinegar.",
      "Sprinkled meringues- sprinkle meringues with finely chopped nuts or 100's and thousands prior to baking.",
      "For a Large Pavlova- Draw a 22-25 cm (9-10 inch) circle on the baking paper. Turn paper over and place on a large cookie sheet/tray. Use the entire mixture to pile onto the circle. Smooth over the surface and bake for 90 minutes. Turn the oven off and leave the pavlova in the closed oven for another hour. After an hour open the oven door and leave the pavlova in the oven to cool. Serve topped with whipped cream or vanilla yogurt. Top with some fruit or grated chocolate. Can also be served with lemon butter/curd instead of cream.",
      "Small Pavlovas/Individual pavlovas- make as for large pavlova but use 6-8 spoonfuls of meringue per pavlova. Pile the meringue as high as possible. Bake for about 45 minutes."

      "Early in the day, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and generously butter the bottom and sides of one 9-inch springform pan (preferably a nonstick one). Wrap the outside with aluminum foil, covering the bottom and extending all the way up the sides.",
      "To make the cheesecake layer, put one package of the cream cheese, 1/3 cup of the sugar, and the cornstarch in a large bowl and beat with an electric mixer on low until creamy, about 3 minutes, scraping down the bowl a couple of times. Blend in the remaining cream cheese, one package at a time, scraping down the bowl after each. Increase the mixer speed to medium and beat in the remaining 1 cup sugar, then the vanilla. Blend in the eggs, one at a time, beating well after adding each. Beat in the cream just until it's completely blended. Be careful not to overmix!",
      "Gently spoon the batter into the foil-wrapped springform and place it in a large shallow pan containing hot water that comes about 1 inch up the sides of the springform. Bake the cake at 350 degrees F until the edges are light golden brown and the top is slightly golden tan, about 1 1/4 hours. Remove the cake from the water bath, transfer to a wire rack, and cool in the pan for 2 hours, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate (while still in the pan) until it's completely cold, about 4 hours. Place in the freezer until ready to assemble the cake.",
      "Meanwhile, prepare the devil's food cake layers. Check that the oven is preheated to 350 degrees F and that the water bath has been removed. Generously butter the bottom and sides of three 9-inch round layer cake pans. Very important: Line the bottom of all three pans with parchment or waxed paper (don't let the paper come up the sides).",
      "Sift the flour, baking powder, and salt together in a small bowl. Cream the butter and both sugars together in a large bowl with the mixer on medium until light yellow and creamy. Add the egg yolks, one at a time, beating well after each. Beat in the melted chocolate and vanilla. Using a wooden spoon, stir in the flour mixture, alternately with the milk, mixing well after each until blended.",
      "Put the egg whites and cream of tartar in a clean medium-size bowl and beat with clean, dry beaters on high until stiff (but not dry) peaks form. Fold about one-third of the whites into the chocolate batter until they disappear, then gently fold in the remaining whites. Don't worry if you still see a few white specks--they'll disappear during baking. Divide the batter evenly between the three pans. Bake until a toothpick inserted in the centers comes out with moist crumbs clinging to it, about 30 minutes. Cool the cakes in the pans on a rack for 15 minutes, then remove the cakes from the pans and gently peel off the paper liners. Let cool completely, about 2 hours, then cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight or until ready to assemble the cake.",
      "Early on the day you plan to serve the cake, make the chocolate curls and lay them out on the marble or baking sheet to dry. Now make the frosting: In a large bowl, sift the confectioners' sugar, cocoa, and salt together. In another large bowl, cream the butter with a mixer on high until light yellow and slightly thickened, about 3 minutes. With the mixer still running, beat in the chocolate, corn syrup, and vanilla. Reduce the mixer speed to low and beat in the sugar-cocoa mixture in two additions, beating well after each. Blend in the cream until the frosting is a spreading consistency, adding a little more cream if needed. Whip the frosting on high until light and creamy, about 2 minutes more.",
      "To assemble the cake, remove the cheesecake from the freezer and let stand at room temperature about 10 minutes. Place one layer of devil's food cake, top side down, on a cake plate and spread with some of the frosting. Release and remove the ring of the springform, then remove the frozen cheesecake from the bottom of the pan. Place top side down on the frosted cake layer and spread with some frosting. Top with the second devil's food layer, top side down. Spread with more frosting and cover with the third devil's food layer, top side up. Brush away any crumbs from the sides and top of the fudge cake layers. Frost the sides and top of the cake with the remaining frosting, spreading the top with frosting about 1/2 inch deep. Use a long metal spatula that has been warmed under hot running water to smooth out the frosting on the sides and top of the cake. Coat the sides with the chocolate curls, placing them where you want. With a small spatula or table knife, swirl the frosting on top into a decorative design. Or, if you wish, decorate with a crosshatch design: Make about 6 vertical lines, 1 inch apart, then crisscross 6 more horizontal lines the same distance, swirling the icing a little as you go.",
      "Refrigerate the cake for at least 2 hours to allow the cheesecake to thaw enough to easily slice. Use a sharp straight-edge knife, not a serrated one, to cut it. Cover any leftover cake with plastic wrap and refrigerate, or wrap and freeze for up to 1 month."

      "Add the softened cream cheese, sour cream, melted butter, butter rum flavoring, 1 teaspoon vanilla and 2 tablespoons rum (optional) and mix on medium speed for 1 - 2 minutes, until well-blended.",
      "Spread batter into a 9 x 13 inch cake pan. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, just until a toothpick inserted into the middle comes out clean.",
      "While the cake is baking, make the milk 'syrup' that will soak into the cooled cake: In a bowl, whisk together the condensed milk, the evaporated milk, and the whipping cream (the three kinds of milk, or 'res leches), 1 teaspoon vanilla, a pinch of salt, and 1 tablespoon rum (optional).",
      "Once the cake is out of the oven, use a fork or small skewer to gently poke holes in the cake, Slowly pour the milk mixture over the entire cake.

      "When the temperature of the sugar syrup reaches about 238 degrees Fahrenheit (after about 3 minutes), turn on the mixer and start beating the egg whites. When the temperature reaches 242 degrees Fahrenheit (117 degrees Celsius), remove the syrup from the heat. (The total cooking time is about 4 minutes, and the sugar syrup should make thin threads if you drizzle it off of a fork, and will have thickened.).",
      "The egg whites should be forming medium stiff peaks. Slowly and carefully pour the syrup down the side of the mixer bowl, into the beaten egg whites. Continue to beat the meringue for 1-2 minutes longer. Stir in 1 teaspoon vanilla and 1 teaspoon rum if desired.",

Add bacon to Dutch oven and cook over medium heat until crisp, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer bacon to plate lined with paper towels and pour off all but 1 teaspoon fat from pot. Return pot to medium heat, add onions and bell pepper, and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Stir in garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds.",
      "2. Add beef, 2 teaspoons salt, and 1 teaspoon pepper. Increase heat to medium-high and cook, using wooden spoon to break up beef into 1/2-inch pieces, until just slightly pink, about 5 minutes. Drain beef and vegetables in colander.",
      "3. Add tomato puree, diced tomatoes, and toasted spices to empty pot and bring to simmer over medium-high heat, scraping up any browned bits from bottom of pot. Return drained beef and vegetable mixture and bacon to pot, stir to combine, and bring to simmer. Transfer contents to slow-cooker insert.",
      "4. Set slow cooker to low, cover, and cook until tender, 6 to 8 hours, stirring in beans during last hour of cooking. (Alternately, cook on high for 3 to 4 hours.) Adjust seasonings and serve. (Leftovers can be refrigerated for several days or frozen for several months.).",
      "Make Ahead: If you'd prefer to just dump the chili ingredients into the slow cooker before running off to work, you can do all the work the night before. Follow the recipe through step 3, but continue to simmer the assembled chili for 10 minutes. Transfer the chili to an airtight container and refrigerate overnight. In the morning, simmer the chili in a Dutch oven for 10 minutes, then transfer it to your slow cooker and proceed with step 4."
