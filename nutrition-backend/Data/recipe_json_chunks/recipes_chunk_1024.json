      "If you're not going to freeze the cake for long-term storage, it should be transferred to the refrigerator to defrost after its 2 hour freeze. Remove the dessert ring. Using a long metal offset spatula, spread ganache over the top and sides of the cake. If you want to repeat with another one or two layers of ganache, go ahead-you've got plenty of ganache to play with. If the ganache is firm enough to hold a design, you can decorate the top now. If the ganache is still very soft, return the cake to the refrigerator for a few minutes to set it enough to hold a line drawn across its surface with a knife. (Keep the leftover ganache at hand so you can cover up any design attempts that don't pass muster.) Decorate the top of the cake using the blade of a long, serrated bread knife. Hold the handle of the knife with one hand and the tip with the other. Starting at one edge of the cake and holding the knife almost perpendicular to the cake, gently slide the knife from one side of the cake to the other. Without \"losing your place\" at the edge of the cake, shift the blade about 1/16 inch and slide it 1/16 inch back to the opposite edge of the cake. You will have created the first V in a herringbone pattern. Continue until you have decorated the entire top of the cake. If the knife blade becomes clogged with ganache, clean the blade before continuing the pattern. Return the cake to the refrigerator for a few minutes to set the design. If you prefer, the cake can be finished with a flat-top-that is, a smooth coating of ganache-or you can decorate the top with swirls, ridges, or any other pattern that pleases you. \r\nThe last step is to press the toasted almonds against the sides of the cake. (If the ganache has set so it's very firm and the almonds won&#65533;&#65533;&#65533;t stick to the sides, just warm the sides ever so slightly with a hair dryer-lightly melting the ganache will help the almonds to adhere.) The cake can be served now or chilled until serving time. If the cake is very cold and firm, let it rest at room temperature for 15 to 30 minutes before serving.",
      "PREPARE ALMONDS: Center a rack in the oven and preheat the oven to 325 degrees.",
      "Toss the almonds with the cocoa, then toss with the syrup to coat, and spread them out on a parchment-lined baking sheet.",
      "Toast the almonds, stirring every 3 to 4 minutes, until they are deeply and evenly browned, about 10 to 12 minutes.",
      "Transfer the sheet to a rack and cool the almonds to room temperature.",
      "(The almonds can be used immediately or packed into an airtight container and stored at room temperature for about 4 days.) PREPARE GANACHE: Place the chocolate and cocoa in a medium bowl.",
      "Bring the cream to a boil and remove it from the heat.",
      "Pour the cream into the chocolate in three additions, using a rubber spatula to stir the mixture in concentric circles, starting each time with a small circle in the center of the bowl and working your way out into larger circles.",
      "You'll have a smooth, glossy ganache.",
      "Allow the ganache to rest uncovered and undisturbed (don't stir it) at room temperature until it sets, 40 to 60 minutes, depending on the room's temperature.",
      "When the ganache is properly set, it will hold a ribbon for a second or two when stirred.",
      "It is ready to be used now or covered and refrigerated until needed.",
      "If the ganache is chilled, it must be brought back to its proper consistency by leaving it at room temperature until spreadable, or by heating it over hot water or in a microwave oven at low power.",

If fryer has a basket, simply lift it out to remove the fried potatoes. Otherwise, use a long-handled skimmer to lift out the potatoes. Be sure to bring the temperature of the oil back to 325\u00b0F in between the batches. At this point the frites can rest for several hours at room temperature until you are almost ready to serve them.",

Drain on fresh paper towels or brown paper bags and place in a warmed serving bowl lined with more paper towels. Sprinkle with salt and serve. Never cover the potatoes to keep them hot as they will immediately turn soft and limp. If you are inclined to perfectionism, leave some potatoes to fry halfway through the meal so you can serve them crisp and hot."

      "Bacon Bits: Finely chop leftover cooked bacon and place in a zip-top bag, pressing out all the air when you seal it. Form into a flat, thin layer and freeze; simply break off a few pieces and crumble them when you need bacon bits. Freeze for up to 3 months.",

      "Packaged Bread Crumbs: In a 300 oven, dry slices or cubes of any type of bread about 15 minutes. Crush in a food processor or with the bottom of a pan. For seasoned bread crumbs, add dry herbs like oregano or thyme (a little garlic powder tastes great, too). To make flaky panko-like crumbs, mince fresh bread by pulsing it in a food processor, then dry the crumbs in a 250 oven."

      "Take off the lid (if the steam valve hasn't dropped, make sure you move the steam value away from \"Sealing\"). Let the pork cool slightly, then use two forks to shred the meat. It may look like you have way too much liquid, but it will absorb it after you shred the pork.",
      "Once shredded, use the pork however you like. I like to toast a few tortillas and top them with the pork, pineapple salsa, fresh cilantro, and a squeeze of fresh lime juice. Carnitas make a great salad topping, and are also excellent mixed into rice, in a sandwich (try it! trust me!), or reheated until crispy and served with eggs and hot sauce and avocado.",
      "Note: If the pork is too liquid-y even after shredding and sitting, transfer it to a large pan and cook it on the stovetop until some of liquid evaporates. This is also an excellent way to get the meat golden and crispy (you can also spread it on a sheet pan and broil it for a minute or two)-for tacos and salads, I like to take this extra step to get those crunchy edges."

      "Finally stir in all the chopped vegetables into the cottage cheese and mayonnaise mixture mixing everything thoroughly.",
      "Taste test the resulting salad after letting it sit for at least a couple hours to let the flavors settle and blend together. Then, after tasting, if you find that the amount of indicated seasoning isn't adequate to your preferences, whichever spice is lacking incrementally. The whole cottage cheese salad taste won't come out to its peak flavor until having sat in the refrigerator a while, even though it is actually good even without letting it sit.",
      "I recommend letting the salad rest four or more hours in the refrigerator (best if overnight) before you do a final re-adjust on any needed additional seasoning.",
      "Note: This is a very simple salad but very versatile, extremely tasty and quite popular whenever it has been made. It can double as either a salad on its own, or as a dip for raw vegetables or crackers. Start with a half cup of mayonnaise to begin with and use Best Foods or Hellman's not runny mayonnaise. And then increase mayo to taste if more is needed to make the salad rich and creamy. You don't want to overdo the mayonnaise though. And if you like a dry cottage cheese consistency, then get some cheese cloth and strain the whey off the cottage cheese before making the salad. It won't taste as nice as the original unstrained recipe in my opinion because you lose part of the cottage cheese flavor if it is strained too much. I use low fat cottage and not high fat because the high fat is more creamy and will make the salad more \"liquidy\". If you use high fat cottage cheese,that has more liquid cream in it, use a little less mayonnaise. Don't expect this salad to be the consistency of cream cheese as some might do who don't want it 'wet'. It is cottage cheese and the finished salad should have about the same consistency. Also be sure you shake all the water off the vegetables before adding them to the cottage cheese mixture . After the salad sits a long time, some whey will come to the top after flavors blend. That is normal. Enjoy."

It will NOT work with firm waterpack tofu. The texture and the taste will change because the medium will change. An example of the correct tofu is: http://www.morinu.com/ Please feel free to visit the Vegetarian forum and ask if you aren't sure. We don't bite. Honest but we do have great ways to make stuff taste even better. I host there so you can ask anytime. As to the Almond, add a bit, taste and add more. Don't add all at once. You may need less than we use because brands vary. [Do the same with other flavorings too] Also I have added chocolate extract. It does well with that in place of the Almond.",

Those with a sweet tooth may want to tweak that. Simply add the 1/4 and taste. Then add to your taste. Syrups such as honey, maple syrup and Kings Molasses have been used but I personally wasn't pleased with it. However tastes may vary. Also note it MUST BE FIRM SILKEN. IT CANNOT BE WATERPACKED [can be low fat, organic or regular]. Soft is for smoothies and Cotton or waterpacked is for other methods.",

      "For Candy Core and Exterior- In a medium sauce pan or double boiler, heat candy melts until just liquid. 110 degrees is their ideal temperature in a liquid state.",
      "Blow up several balloons and make sure you have ample room in your freezer. Slowly dip or paint candy melts onto balloon working in small sections until completely covered. Once ready, set on flat plate and place in freezer.",
      "Here are TWO helpful hints to avoid trouble at this stage: The balloon should be slightly under inflated and the temperature of the candy melts being too warm can cause the balloon to pop and splatter difficult to clean candy all over you and your kitchen. I can't guarantee this won't happen anyway, which is why I mentioned you should blow up several and make your peace with disaster before it happens. Layer the balloon several times and keep frozen until ready to use. When desired shape is achieved punch small hole in balloon and slowly begin to remove using your fingers to separate the balloon from the frozen candy. If any large pieces of your pumpkin core break, simply heat the edges and put it back where it broke from. Keep remaining candy melts to brush on final cake to create delicious seal.",
      "For Pumpkin Cake- Pre-heat oven to 350. In a large bowl, mix flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt and cinnamon, set aside. In stand mixer, combine 4 cups white sugar. 2 1/2 cups vegetable oil, 2 teaspoon vanilla extract and 4 cups canned pumpkin. Beat until smooth and then add one egg at a time. Slowly incorporate dry ingredients into the wet. Butter and flour six 7\" round cake pans and pour two cups batter into each. Bake three at a time at 350 for 30 minutes. Some cakes are finicky, but these are pretty foolproof and so delicious!",
      "Once removed from oven, wait 10 minutes, then remove from baking dishes, wrap loosely in wax paper and refrigerate until ready to use. At which point you will slice the rounds into thin moon-like crescents with a serrated blade and any additional pieces can be used later for pumpkin cake pops or just eating fresh.",
      "For Buttercream- In a stand mixer, beat room temp butter until light and the gradually add confectioners sugar. Beat until fluffy, then add 2 tbs heavy whipping cream, 4 tbs canned pumpkin, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, 1 tsp Pumpkin spice, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp Orange food coloring, 3/4 tsp brown food coloring and taste to ensure the flavor is to your liking.",
      "Remove cake crescents from fridge and candy core dome from freezer and frost and apply in two layers. Initial layer should start horizontal and the last layer should be vertical. Keep in mind pumpkins are somewhat irregular, so don't worry too much about imperfections. Refrigerate often to ensure cake is structurally sound and never work in a warm kitchen.",
      "Once built, frost with remaining buttercream and pipe stripes from top to bottom and blend for added dimension and flavor. Seal with leftover candy melts and finalize by painting additional shadows and highlights. Use a flame-heated blade to carve the jack-o-lantern. Cut a small mouse hole in the back and light with either a candle or a plug-in light. This cake has no supports, so know it must be kept cold as it could collapse if left at room temperature.",
      "Note: You'll need 3 batches of buttercream for this cake."

Add in the wine and on medium heat, cook until reduced by half, another 3-4 minutes if that. Then add in the cream and again, cook 3-4 minutes until reduced by half. Slowly stir in the butter and cook another minute until creamy and slightly thickened. Add in the tequila, lime juice, and season with salt. Reduce the heat to low and put on the back burner so you can finish your skewers. This is a butter dipping sauce, it is not supposed to be too thick.",

I wrap the shrimp (slightly curled around the outside of the scallop). They don't go all the way around, but close. This way, the skewer goes through the tip of the shrimp, then through the scallop end to end and comes out through the tail of the shrimp. Again, this way the shrimp and scallops lay flat and cook more evenly and quicker.",
      "Cook -- Whether you use your outdoor grill, inside grill pan make sure to lightly oil. If using your boiler, I cook mine on foil. but either way, there is oil in the marinade, so you should not have to add any oil. to your seafood or vegetables. Just season lightly both the seafood and vegetable skewers with salt and pepper.",
      "I start the vegetables first as they will take a minute or two longer than the seafood. Grill the vegetables until slightly tender and the tomatoes start to burst. And for the seafood, you want the scallops lightly firm and the shrimp will just begin to turn pink and curl. DON'T overcook.",
      "Serve -- Plate up the kabobs on a big serving platter and brush each skewer lightly with some of the butter sauce. Add a small cup or dish on each plate with a little extra of the sauce for dipping, you don't need much. Black beans and rice are the perfect side dish to this meal. ENJOY!"

Scrape the batter into the pan, rap the pan on the counter to debubble the batter and smooth the top.",

      "Cover tightly with aluminum foil and refrigerate overnight. (Dough balls may be frozen for up to 6 months. Freezing seems to make the dough even more tender when baked. Thaw in refrigerator overnight, not at room temperature.)",
      "Remove 1 dozen balls from the refrigerator at a time. If dough is too warm or too cold it is difficult to roll out. Roll each ball into a 4\" circle. Circles will be tissue paper thin. Use as little flour as possible to keep dough from sticking to pastry board. It is best to make a mixture of 6 tablespoons flour and 2 tablespoons confectioners' sugar for sprinkling the board.",
      "Lay rolled out circles of pastry on a large tray just barely overlapping so they will not stick together. Use waxed paper between layers. When a dozen balls have been rolled, refrigerate the tray so dough does not become too soft. If this happens kieflies will not be attractive.",
      "It is easier to assemble if you roll out about 36 balls, fill and bake. All the balls may be rolled at one time, but keep pastry circles refrigerated until ready to fill. Work with only as many circles as will it an one cookie sheet at a time.",
      "To assemble kieflies, place a semi-heaping tablespoon of filling across the middle of each circle, but not quite to the edge. Fold 1/3 of the dough over filling, overlapping about half way; fold the remaining 1/3 of the dough so it overlaps the first 1/3. Use a gentle hand when overlapping the filling so that when it bakes the filling will have room to expand. Shape the rolls into crescents, using thumbs and fingers. When forming the crescents the edges might curl up slightly. Do not try to smooth out the dough. To do so would not allow the dough to expand and become flaky.",
      "Always place filled kieflies on a cool, ungreased cookie sheet. Bake no more than 1 sheet at a time. Preheat oven to 400 degrees, reduce heat to 375 degrees and bake 10 to 12 minutes or only until lightly browned.",

      "Filling; Beat egg whites until stiff peaks form. Gradually beat in confectioners' sugar and lemon juice. Use a spatula to fold in ground nuts until thoroughly blended. If filling seems a bit \"weepy\" add about 3 crushed graham crackers.",
      "NOTE Kieflies will keep up to a week if kept in a cool spot. DO NOT cover tightly.",
      "These kieflies freeze beautifully. They will thaw at room temperature (uncovered) in about 3 hours. Freshen with confectioners' sugar when ready to serve."
