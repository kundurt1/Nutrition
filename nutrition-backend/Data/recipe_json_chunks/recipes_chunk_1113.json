Beat butter and sugar with a mixer until light and fluffy. Add eggs one at a time, scraping bowl thoroughly between each addition. Beat in vanilla and lemon zest. Add in 1/3 of flour just until combined. Add 1/2 of sour cream just until combined. Repeat with 1/2 of remaining flour, then remaining sour cream, ending with flour. Beat in bananas. Divide batter evenly between pans and bake for 1 hour or until toothpick comes out clean. Cool cakes on a rack for 20 minutes before removing from pans.",
      "Pastry Cream: Heat half-and-half, 3 tablespoons sugar, and salt in small heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium heat until simmering, stirring occasionally to dissolve sugar.",
      "Meanwhile, whisk egg yolks in medium bowl until thoroughly combined. Whisk in remaining 1 tablespoon sugar and whisk until sugar has begun to dissolve and mixture is creamy, about 15 seconds. Whisk in cornstarch until combined and mixture is pale yellow and thick, about 30 seconds.",
      "When half-and-half mixture reaches full simmer, gradually whisk simmering half-and-half into yolk mixture to temper. Return mixture to saucepan, scraping bowl with rubber spatula; return to simmer over medium heat, whisking constantly, until 3 or 4 bubbles burst on surface and mixture is thickened and glossy, about 30 seconds. Off heat, whisk in butter and vanilla. Transfer mixture to medium bowl, press plastic wrap directly on surface, and refrigerate until cold and set, at least 3 hours or up to 48 hours.",
      "Buttercream: Whisk egg whites and sugar together thoroughly in a heat proof bowl. Set bowl over a pot of boiling water. Whisking constantly, heat mixture until sugar has dissolved and mixture is just too hot to dip your finger inches (Careful not to scramble the eggs!) Pour into bowl of a standing mixer and beat on high speed to make a stiff meringue (this is a swiss meringue). Continue beating on slow speed until cooled to room temp, about 10 minutes. Gradually beat in butter a few cubes at a time until all is incorporated. Beat in vanilla and rum. You can refrigerate this for up to 10 days or freeze up to a month. Bring to room temp and whisk before using.",
      "Caramel Sauce: In a small to medium saucepan, combine the sugar and water and cook over medium heat stirring until sugar dissolves. Stop stirring, increase heat to high, cover and bring to a full boil. (The steam will wash the sides of the pan to remove any sugar crystals.) After a minute or so, remove the lid and cook without stirring until it begins to turn a golden brown around the edges (it should take 5 to 10 minutes depending on the size of your pan). In the meantime, heat the cream until it begins to simmer. Set aside for a moment. As soon as you start to see the sugar syrup turn golden, carefully swirl the pan to redistribute the caramel. (Do not stir! The sugar will crystallize.) A few moments longer is all it will take -- just until it is an even golden color. Now, remove from the heat and slowly pour in the cream while stirring with a long-handled wooden spoon. It will bubble up furiously, so be careful not to let it overflow. Stop for a second and let it die down if necessary. Keep stirring until the mixture is smooth. Stir in salt and let cool to room temperature.",
      "Assembly: Spread cold pastry cream between cake layers. Ice sides and top with buttercream. Pipe a decorative border around the top edge of the cake to create a dam for the caramel. If the caramel has cooled too much to pour, warm it just until it's more fluid, but not warm enough to melt the buttercream. Pour an even layer of caramel onto the top of the cake. Save the rest for serving along side or over ice cream, or eat it with a spoon -- it's amazing!",

    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "Start by preparing the potatoes. This can be done well in advance. Bring a large pot of water to the boil. Add the potatoes, whole and unpeeled and boil, uncovered, for 25 minutes or until very soft. Remove potatoes from the water to a plate until needed. It doesn't matter if they get cold.",
      "Now, divide each bunch of herbs roughly into four: one quarter to go between the skin and the breast; one quarter to go in the cavity; one quarter to scatter over the chicken; and one quarter reserved for garnish. Strip the leaves from one quarter of the oregano and one quarter of the thyme discarding any woody stalks. Leave the remaining herbs intact.",
      "Now, wash the cavity of the chicken with cold running water and dry the chicken very well, inside and out, with paper towels. Using a pair of kitchen shears or a sharp pair of scissors, trim the wing tips from the chicken as these will burn at the high temperature you're going to cook at.",
      "Preheat your oven to 240C or 230C fan-forced and make sure there's a rack in the centre, or just below the centre and plenty of room above for the chicken.",
      "Place the chicken on a plate and, carefully, working from the neck end, slip your finger between the skin and the flesh on the right breast of the chicken, breaking through the membrane and separating the skin from the flesh, being careful not to pierce the skin with your fingernail. Try to wriggle your finger down near the drumstick and separate some of the skin from it too. Repeat for the left breast.",
      "In a bowl, roughly mix together the butter cubes, the herb leaves you've stripped from their stalks, and the chopped, peeled garlic.",
      "Using your fingers, push this mixture carefully into the pockets you've formed between the skin and the flesh of the chicken breasts and, if possible, a little way down towards the drumsticks. It doesn't matter if a bit falls out, you can just shove that into the cavity later.",
      "Put the chopped, unpeeled garlic and one, 'one-quarter' bunch each of the oregano and thyme into the cavity of the chicken. You should now have two bunches each of the oregano and thyme left, and one bulb of unpeeled garlic cloves.",
      "If using a large lemon, cut in half and squeeze the juice from one half only. If using two small lemons, squeeze one whole lemon. Drizzle the lemon juice over the top of the chicken, and place the squeezed portion/s of the lemon into the cavity.",
      "Thinly slice the unsqueezed large lemon half, or whole small lemon, and set slices aside.",
      "Line a large baking pan with silicone (baking) paper. (Be sure to use a pan that will withstand a high heat. Non-stick pans are probably not suitable for this as you may ruin the coating.) Lining the pan is optional, but it makes washing up a lot easier and stops stuff from sticking.",
      "Place the sliced onion in the base of the pan and place the chicken on top.",
      "Now, arrange the lemon slices over the top of the chicken, and scatter the unpeeled garlic cloves over the top, being sure to tuck some of the garlic and the lemon slices down between the breast and the leg.",
      "Sprinkle generously with sea salt and cracked black pepper.",
      "Now, take the potatoes you cooked earlier and, using a potato masher, push down on each one gently until the skin splits and the potato inside breaks up a bit. Don't worry if they fall apart a little bit. It's supposed to look rustic! They should look squashed but not flattened.",
      "Now, arrange the potatoes around the chicken in the baking pan and sprinkle them with salt and pepper, then drizzle the potatoes and the chicken generously with olive oil. By all means use extra virgin olive oil if you like it, but it's not essential, ordinary olive oil will do.",
      "Finally, scatter the remaining herbs over the chicken and the potatoes.",
      "Spoon four tablespoons of water into the baking pan then place it into the pre-heated oven on the centre shelf.",
      "Roast for at 240C or 230C fan-forced, for about 50 minutes to 1 hour or until the chicken is cooked.",
      "Remove chicken from oven and place on a plate to rest for 10 minutes.",
      "If potatoes are not quite crisp enough, place them in another pan and return to the oven while you prepare the sauce.",
      "Now, pick out any obviously burned bits or herb stalks from the baking pan, as well as the onion rings and any bits of lemon that have fallen off the chicken. Discard these bits.",
      "Using the back of a teaspoon, squash any unpeeled garlic cloves which are still soft and extract the soft garlic pulp from inside and discard the papery bits. Transfer the garlic pulp to a heat proof jug.",
      "Now, pour the drippings from the pan into the same jug. Don't worry if you haven't got a lot of liquid at this stage, you'll get quite a bit when you cut the chicken.",
      "Add the chicken stock to the jug.",
      "Allow this mixture to stand for a few minutes then skim or spoon the excess oil off the top.",
      "Now, check the potatoes if they're still in the oven and remove if ready, or leave them there if you want them even crispier.",
      "Now, dust off any burned bits of lemon, garlic or herbs on top of the chicken, divide the chicken into serving portions and pour off any liquid into the jug.",
      "Add extra lemon-juice, salt and pepper to the jug to taste.",
      "Heat the sauce in the jug in the microwave until hot.",
      "Serve chicken, drizzled generously with the hot lemony, garlicky sauce, along with the crispy smashed potatoes and garnish with the reserved herbs.",

I buttered rye bread slices on one side and spread Thousand Island dressing on the other side. On the dressing side I placed a slice of swiss cheese, sliced Pastrami from the deli and then topped with sourkraut. I cooked them on my grill until the cheese was melted and the bread was nice and toasted. They were delicious! I only gave the four star rating because the sourkraut in the middle wasn't very warm. Next time I make these I will warm the sourkraut in the microwave first and maybe add another slice of swiss too! I made was to heat the sauerkraut in the microwave for 20 seconds before adding to the sandwich. I like my sandwich warmed all the way through. I would recommend keeping a good eye on your bread and toast it to your liking. If you like Rueben sandwiches you will love this one!"

This will get the wood as wet as it can get and give you the time you need to get your fish completely cooked before the board starts really burning. If you notice that the board has caught fire while you are grilling, spray it down with water to put out the fire. This isn't to say that you don't want the board to burn a little. The smoldering of the wood is what creates the smoke and flavors the fish."
