      "Repeat the above for all loaves of bread used, whether 2 or 5! You can freeze the rolls once they are cut and placed in cake pan. They will keep well in freezer for up to 3 months. Be sure to get as much air out of the freezer bags before you freeze. You can also flash freeze and place rolls in a Tilia vacuum pack machine to get all the air out. This prevents freezer burn."

      "Peel, core and chop the apples. After you have chopped the first couple, put them in a very large heavy pot and toss them with the lemon juice - this will keep them from browning. Add and toss each apple as you go. ** if you are canning - sterilize your jars now too! **",
      "When they are all chopped put the pot on the stove - add the apple juice and bring it to a boil. Turn the heat down to simmer. Add the cinnamon, and 1/4 c of sugar. Let the mixture simmer for several minutes, then taste the liquid. Add the sugar 1/4 cup at a time until you get to the level of sweetness that suits you - again, this is going to vary according to your taste and your apples. I added a bit, cooked a bit, tasted. The tuaca add sweetness too so don't add all of the sugar just yet. After about 15 minutes the apples should be getting tender. Add in the tuaca, vanilla and butter. Simmer for a few more minutes, then get out a stick blender (easy) or a hand masher (workout) and start to mash / mix the jam. Taste again! Adjust the sugar again if needed!",
      "Now blend or mash - I kept my jam a bit chunky, I was looking for some apple texture in mine. You could also decide at this point to blend the daylights out of it and go apple butter instead. Up to you.",
      "If you are not canning, you're done! If you are canning - put the lids in hot water, scoop the jam into sterilized jars, wipe the rim and put the dried lids and rings on, and into the canning pot - boil for 10 minutes and then remove, make sure each jar pops to seal. Leave them alone for at least 12 hours, then check the seals. If they did not seal properly, put them in the fridge. Do not accidentally mail an unsealed jar to your brother - he will think you are trying to kill him.",
      "For more detailed info on canning - this is one of many great sites - remember to be careful with sanitation and safety when canning! There are loads of books available too - I have Putting Up The Harvest and The Blue Chair Jam Book. http://www.pickyourown.org/"

Remove the neck from the pan and set both aside. Keep the kitchen vultures off the neck-whether or not you let them eat the bacon is up to you. Give the turkey a good basting and put him back in the oven to finish cooking. The common thought is thigh meat needs to be 180-I stop before that (around 165-170) because it will keep cooking as it rests. My turkey took just under 4 hours. When he is finished cooking and golden brown, take him out and make the gravy while he rests.",

Now whisk the milk in slowly - it's going to get super thick - don't worry. Start whisking in the broth and brandy, and the gravy will relax again. Now start pouring in the drippings carefully from the separator (try not to get too much of the plain old fat in there - a little is OK)-this is where you add a little, whisk a little, taste a little. Decide if you want more salt and pepper, or maybe a bit more drippings or broth. Get the thickness the way you like it-this is your gravy not mine! Finally-stir in the chopped turkey neck (and giblets and bacon if you want) and stir until warm. That's it! Carve that turkey and serve up!"

Or, sprinkle the mixture into long-simmering meat-based soups or stews. The bacon releases its flavorful fat into chicken as it roasts to act as a powerful moistening agent. No extra butter or olive oil needed. You can vary the herbs, or even add curry powder to taste.

I favor white eggplants from the farmers market, but thin Asian or Graffiti work well, too. The object is to use a variety with thin skins that becomes tender rather quickly. Once you've done with the knife, throw eggplant into bowl and coat with seasonings. Or hand a wooden spoon to a child and let him do it; it's fun.",
      "Meanwhile, place the enameled Dutch oven you bought for No-Knead bread on the stove to heat a few minutes, then raise heat to medium high and add enough olive oil to coat the bottom of pan. When you think the fat is hot enough, toss in a piece of eggplant just to make sure it sizzles. Okay? Then start adding the rest of eggplant bit by bit. Stir with your wooden spoon from time to time. The eggplant should turn golden and soft in 10 minutes or so.",
      "Then, read this carefully: reserve soaking water from tart cherries as you drain them. Add a little more water if necessary to measure half a cup and add this to eggplant. Turn down heat to medium low and cover, letting eggplant stew until tender. Check in 5 minutes, then again in 10. Uncover and let any excess water evaporate before turning off burner and draining eggplant on paper towel.",
      "As eggplant cools, prepare the quinoa. I recommend running it under cold water and straining the grains just like everyone else does. I also belong to the toasting school and think a minute of stirring the strained quinoa in a pot with a thick bottom until the tiny seeds that didn't remain stuck to your strainer, fingers and stove top become dry. No need to coat them with oil first, though, you could. Add 2 cups boiling water and simmer, covered, 15 minutes. When water is fully absorbed and you see your cute little spirals, remove lid briefly to place clean dishtowel in between top of the pot and the lid. Let this contraption sit a spell off the burner as steam rises to become one with fabric and as you move on to final things.",
      "Mix dressing. Here's where I am going to leave matters up to you and ask you to just keep stirring vigorously as you emulsify and combine ingredients to your liking. Start with only a wee bit of pomegranate molasses as recommended and the same, trifling amount of Spanish vinegar. A strong, bitter olive oil is going to make this taste ghastly, but do not despair. Pinch of sugar and a glug of neutral oil (Bittman dislikes canola, but not me) evens out disparate elements and as you adjust, there will be a joyful \"ah!\" moment. Go with that. The point is to retain that original citrus accent and don't let the molasses play more than a very minor role.",
      "Assemble salad by dressing a bed of greens first. Pour the remain dressing over the cooled eggplant and combine your nightshade family-member with fork-fluffed grains. Coarsely chop cherries and mix with the remaining ingredients before serving all on the bed of greens."

      "Once you have browned all the meat, add a bit more oil to pan, and then add the chopped onions. Cook onions until they are fragrant and start to become translucent. If you find that your onions start to burn, add a splash of chicken stock. Return meat to pan. Add 1 1/2 cups chicken stock and spice bundle. Cover pot, bring mixture to a boil and then reduce heat to low. Allow mixture to simmer for one hour.",
      "Preheat oven to 400\u00b0F.",
      "When beef-spice mixture has simmered for 50 minutes, get your root vegetables roasting. Place carrots and celery root on a large rimmed half sheet pan. Zest orange and lemon over vegetables on pan and season mixture with salt and a few good glugs of olive oil, and then toss to combine. Add smashed garlic cloves to pan as well. Roast until tender, about 20 minutes, shaking pan and tossing vegetables with a wooden spoon half way through. Slice your zested orange in half-crosswise, and then cut each half in two.",
      "At 70 minutes, when your root vegetables are roasted, taste your meat; if you cut pieces into 1-inch cubes, they should be soft and tender. If they need a little more time, continue to simmer stew, checking after another 10. Once meat is tender, add roasted vegetables (be sure to scrape pan to get all the zest), porter, orange juice - squeeze the quarters right into the pot, prepared kumquats and shiitakes. Gently stir to combine. Cover pot, bring mixture to a boil and then reduce to a simmer. Allow stew to bubble away for 30-35 minutes more. Taste for salt and adjust as necessary. The stew will be on the thin side. If you prefer a thicker sauce, mix cornstarch and water in a small bowl and then stir it into the bubbling stew. Remove spice bundle and discard. Serve stew over rice with cilantro on top if desired. This is delicious immediately, but also excellent the next day. Enjoy!",
      "Note: You can make the stew through step 2 one day ahead. Allow mixture to cool slightly before refrigerating overnight. When ready to make stew, skim top of any excess fat before proceeding with step 3."

    "title": "chanterelle mushrooms and speck risotto.",
    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "First, pre-cook the chanterelles. This is necessary for three reasons. First, chanterelles are very fleshy mushrooms, so they need some cooking time before they become soft. Second, while they cook, they release a lot of water that you don't necessarily want in your risotto because it could complicate the management of the rice's cooking time. Third, due to the water loss chanterelles may decrease significantly in volume, so you want to measure them cooked rather than raw, to avoid surprises.",
      "Clean and cure the chanterelles, taking away any earthy residue but without trimming them to much. Put them in a pot with just 2 tablespoons of water, cover with the lid and cook on medium-low heat for about 30 minutes. Do not add salt or spices until they are cooked, you want to preserve their original flavour as much as possible. Drain the excess water remaining in the pot after cooking",
      "When you are ready to cook the risotto, bring the vegetable stock to a boil in a pot. Once it's boiling, lower the heat so that it remains hot but does not evaporate quickly.",
      "In a large, heavy-bottomed saucepan, melt 1 tablespoon butter over medium heat. Add the diced onion, thyme, pepper and the chanterelles. Cook stirring regularly, until the onions begins to soften and turn translucent (don't let them brown).",
      "Add the rice to the pot and toast it over medium heat, stirring regularly for a minute (or until the rice feels warm to the touch). Then turn the heat to high and after a few seconds throw in the 1/4 cup of wine. Let it evaporate, while constantly stirring.",
      "When the wine has almost fully evaporated, add one large ladleful of boiling stock to the rice. From now, cook on medium heat for about 18-20 minutes without ever stop stirring the rice (you need to stir frequently because this allows the rice to release starch, which is what ultimately yields a creamy risotto). Add stock whenever you see that the stock in the pot is almost evaporated, but just enough to prevent the rice from sticking to the bottom of the pot. You don't want to \"boil\" the rice, so it should never be fully drowned in water.",
      "After 10 minutes, add the speck to the pot and stir it into the rice. The reason for not adding it at the beginning is that speck tends to become very salty, when cooked for a long time. Keep adding water and stirring until the rice tastes al dente (ideally you should get to this point without having too much liquid left in the pot).",
      "At this point add the parmesan and the remaining tablespoon of butter. Cover with the lid and let it rest (without stirring) on low heat for a few seconds (this will allow the butter to melt on top of the rice). Take off the lid and stir very energetically for a few seconds, until butter and parmesan are incorporated and your risotto reaches a proper creamy texture. Serve with a sprinkle of freshly crushed black pepper .",
      "[ Note: If you substitute shiitake for chanterelles, you do not need to pre-cook them. Just add them in the pot with the onion and follow all the other steps in the same order.]"

Stretch 1/2 of the dough circle over it and seal it on top of the other 1/2 of the dough circle. As you seal it, make sure you are fitting the dough around the cheese as tightly as you can. Any air trapped in there will expand with the heat of the oil, and while the bubbly surface is desired from the air expansion, you don't want so much expansion that the cheese starts to leak out. If the dough is not sealing well, brush a little water on the bottom half of the semi-circle and stick the top half of the semi-circle to it.

Keep the oil between 375F and 385F for the best results and fry for 1 minute on each side or until they are a golden brown. I was able to fry 3 at a time in my pot.

Lay them out on the baking sheets about 2cm/3/4in apart.\r\nCarefully brush the surface of each biscuit with the egg. \r\nBake for 10 minutes, or until golden brown.\r\nCarefully lift the biscuits off the tray using a palette knife and place on a rack to cool. \r\nStore in an air-tight container for a few days ... if that's possible!",

Cool completely in pan.",

Turn them to medium high right before adding syrup for a few seconds, then proceed with the recipe.

Be sure to bring the syrup back up to temperature before proceeding with the recipe.",

      "Preheat a waffle iron (we like a Belgian waffle maker, but any will work). Whisk together the flour, quinoa, chia seeds, sugar, baking powder, and salt. In a separate bowl, whisk together the milk, oil, eggs, and vanilla. When your waffle iron is hot and ready to use, stir the milk mixture into the flour mixture until just combined; the batter will be loose, the consistency of heavy cream.",
      "Spray or brush the waffle iron very lightly with oil. (If your waffle iron is seasoned or nonstick, you should only need to do this once before you begin, not between every waffle, which makes them taste greasy.) Ladle 1 heaping cup (240 ml) of the batter into the waffle iron and cook until golden brown, 12 to 14 minutes. Set aside on a rack while you cook the remaining waffles to keep them crispy (stacking will make them steam and get soggy). Serve the waffles warm with berries, a dollop of yogurt or a fried egg (if desired), and a drizzle of maple syrup, or anything else you desire.",
      "Keep prepared batter in the refrigerator, covered, up to overnight. Or bake the waffles, cool, and freeze them in batches of two in large resealable freezer bags. To eat, bring to room temperature for 5 to 10 minutes, and toast to warm through. If you are making them fresh to order, you should know-as my kids and guests do-that waffle cooking is a one-by-one affair; everyone is allowed to eat their waffle hot and fresh off the press, when they're best, while the rest cook."

      "In a stand-mixer with a dough hook, add the yeast mixture to the dry ingredients, and knead on medium speed for approximately 30 seconds until it comes together to form a rough dough. Then, add the shortening or oil and knead on low for about 5-7 minutes, until the dough becomes smooth and elastic. At this point, the dough should no longer stick to the sides of the mixing bowl, but if it does, add one tablespoon flour at a time and mix for 30 seconds or so, until it no longer sticks. (You could also do this whole step with your hands and lots of elbow grease.)",
      "Cover the mixing bowl containing the bao dough with a towel. Leave it to proof until it doubles in size. (This should take at least 30 minutes, or up to 2 hours depending, on the room temperature.) Meanwhile, prepare 10 square pieces of parchment paper, roughly 4-inches long on each side.",
      "When the dough is proofed, punch it down and portion into 10 roughly equal pieces. (They should be around 50g apiece.) Knead the individual pieces of dough 2-3 times, just to squeeze out any extra air pockets.",
      "Then, on a well-floured surface, roll out the dough into a rectangular shape with rounded ends, roughly 6 inches long and 3 inches wide. Fold the dough in half lengthwise, and place on the parchment squares. Cover lightly with a towel, and let it proof for 30-45 minutes. It won't quite double in size by the end of the proofing time, but should be slightly puffier than when you left it.",
      "Ready a pot of boiling water (it should be at a steady boil; more than a simmer, less than a raging boil) with a steamer rack/basket. Transfer the baos onto the steamer setup, cover the pot with a lid, and steam the baos for 12 minutes. They should be all soft and pillowy when done. The baos can be stored in the fridge for up to 3 days. Before eating, re-steam it for roughly 3 minutes to get it all soft and fluffy again.",
      "Next, make the pork. Bring a pot of water to the boil (the same one you used for steaming, if you like, and add in the slices of pork belly. Cook the pork belly for 5 minutes, then take it out of the water. Discard the water.",
      "Add the oil and brown sugar to a pan or skillet and heat on medium-high. When the sugar completely dissolves, add the pork belly slices and sear both sides until brown. This should take roughly 2-3 minutes on each side. (Be careful not to let it burn!) When the pork belly is nicely browned, add in the shaoxing wine and light soy sauce to deglaze the pan.",
      "When done, transfer the pork belly and pan sauce into a pot or dutch oven, and add in the dark soy sauce, slices of ginger, garlic, scallion and star anise. Add water into the pot until the pork belly is half-submerged. Bring this to a boil, then turn it down to a slow simmer. Taste the braising liquid to test for seasoning; Add more light soy sauce or brown sugar until the sauce is to your liking.",
      "Braise the pork belly on a super low simmer, covered, for 60-90 minutes. Stir it occasionally (every 15 minutes or so) to prevent any bits from sticking and burning on the bottom. When done, the pork belly should be spoon-tender and the fat near-gelatinous. Check the consistency of the sauce, it should be the consistency of a saucy glaze, or as thick as honey; Boil and reduce the sauce separately if it's too runny.",
      "To assemble the bao, pull the bao bun apart in the middle,and brush some of that pork belly sauce in between the buns. Wedge a slice of pork belly in it (or two, if you're feeling particularly gluttonous). Finally, garnish with some chopped scallions, a few sprigs of cilantro, toasted sesame seeds, and you're good to go."

Add the water little by little into the flour and keep working with one hand until the the flour and water turn into a slightly sticky dough. If the the feels too sticky, add a little more flour. If the dough is not moist and soft, add a little more warm water.",

Repeat this press-fold-turn sequence for the as long as your hands can go (about 10 minutes).",

Use a knife to cut the dough into 10 pieces (or to seven small rolls and two little chalas) and shape each piece into a roll or braid, or any shape you like. Place the rolls on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper - and leave to rise for a second time until the rolls double in size again, about 30 - 45 minutes. Second rising time will give the rolls a great soft texture.",

Bake for 25 - 30 minutes or until the crust is golden brown. You can tell if the rolls are baked well by tapping on the bottom of a roll, if it sounds hollow, it's baked. If not, put it back in the oven for a little longer. Let it cool on a wire rack."

Then gently press against the sides to slightly flatten (as in make skinny) and make the sides of the tart dough rise up a tiny bit over the top of the tart pan.

Serve warm with rice and japchae. I'm very fond of Maangchi's version of japchae, though when I make it as a side I will simplify it, for instance by not adding meat."

      "Before you begin, check the boiling point of water with a temperature, as it can vary depending on altitude. If it boils at 212\u00b0 F, which it will at sea level, then you can follow the recipe as is. If it boils at a higher or lower temperature than 212\u00b0 F, add or subtract that temperature difference to or from 235\u00b0 F to determine your target final temperature for the syrup. (For example, if the water boils at 210\u00b0 F, the final syrup temperature would be 233\u00b0 F.)",
      "Pour the syrup into a heavy saucepan with high sides. (The syrup will bubble and rise as it boils, so choose a pan that fits at least 2 quarts so that it doesn't boil over.) Clip a candy thermometer to the side of the pan so it's submerged in the syrup, but not touching the bottom.",
      "Without stirring, heat the syrup to 235\u00b0 F. When it begins to bubble up and come precariously close to the top of the pan, add the cream. Once it reaches 235\u00b0 F with the cream, immediately remove it from the heat. Leave the syrup undisturbed until it has cooled to 190\u00b0 F. Remove the thermometer and begin stirring the cooler syrup slowly with a wooden spoon. After a minute or so, you'll notice the syrup begin to lose its glossy look, and you should feel some crystallization on the bottom of the pan. Continue stirring until you can see crystallization throughout the syrup. As soon as it begins to turn a light, creamy color, start pouring it into your molds.",
      "Let the sugar cool in the molds for at least 1 hour, then gently remove the pieces from the molds. The candy can be stored in an airtight container for several months, though they're best when eaten within the first month."

Cut the portions off the rack: leave 3 bones together when cutting the broad part and 4 or 5 when cutting the thinner one\r\n4. Season each portion on both sides, then fry on a pan with 30gr of oil on a high heat until golden brown on both sides. Set aside\r\n5. Coat the ribs with the sweet pimenton and then with the Salmorejo sauce\r\n6. Melt the pork butter over a medium heat, mixing with the sunflower oil. Then, coat the ribs with the mix\r\n7. Cover the ribs with oven paper and place in an over tray. Ribs need to be covered at all times while cooking to retain the juices of the butter\r\n8. Cook in the oven for 3 hours and a half at 130\u00b0C\r\n9. To check if the meat is cooked, it must easily fall off the bone\r\n10. Remove the fat with a laddle and set it aside for 10 minutes\r\n11. Separate the bone from the meat, being careful not to break the meat, and cut it into portions of about 120gr\r\n12. Filter the fat which was set aside on step 10, keeping only the Salmorejo sauce, which will be used as sauce for the ribs\r\n13. Heat the Salmorejo sauce up, season to taste with water and salt if necesary and set aside.",
      "TO SERVE\r\n1. Pre-heat the oven to around 220\u00b0C and heat the ribs on both sides for 2 minutes\r\n2. Cover the ribs with the hot Salmorejo sauce and serve\r\n3. Serve the hot Salmorejo sauce on top"

I always do the same: start with ham and lay it on the center about 1 inch apart, cover the blank strip with salami, and so on with the pepperoni, then mozzarella, then provolone. Place about 8-10 strips of green pepper. Then, starting at one end, fold the sides together and pinch them together - then end will be a nice doughy part. I always like to stuff some extra filling on the end so its a really good piece.",

    "title": "glass wrapper shrimp dumplings",
    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "NOTE: www.bobsredmill.com makes both potato starch and tapioca starch. Despite the mystery, the wrapper-doughs is very easy to make, but has NO ELASTICITY to work with, meaning they DO NOT STRETCH at all. That makes it less forgiving when it comes to wrapping but after the first couple of trials, you should get the hang of it. I understand how wary some people are towards cooking in grams, but this is really where you want to start. These are conversions I grabbed from the internet which may or MAY NOT BE 100% accurate, but enough to give you a reference for a rough idea of quantities. But please, DO NOT rely on them completely. Do the grams: \r\n\r\n119 grams of water = 1/2 cup. 160 grams of cornstarch (which weights similarly to potato starch) = 1 1/4 cup. ***I recommend using shelled/deveined tiger shrimps in frozen bulks available in wholesales like Cosco, or big supermarkets. They have a very distinctive \"crunch\" or \"snap\" to their meat, and when sold frozen, are almost always guaranteed to be fresh and affordable.",
      "MAKE THE DOUGH: Set a large bowl on a digital scale, and weight/whisk together potato starch, tapioca flour, sugar and salt. Bring a pot of water to boil, then pour it into the bowl until you have 100 grams of boiling water incorporated. Stir the mixture using chopsticks into a lumpy, dry and floury dough. Cover with plastic wrap until it's cooled enough to handle, then add the vegetable oil and 30 grams of cold water. Knead the dough with your hands until perfectly smooth for a couple of minute. The dough should be slightly sticky and will probably stick to your hands when you're kneading it, but not impossible to work with. Add a bit more potato starch if too wet, or little more water if too dry. Cover the the dough with plastic wrap until needed.",
      "MAKE THE FILLING: Place fatty ground pork, 35 grams (2 large) of tiger shrimps in the food processor and puree into a sticky paste. Then add the chopped cooked spinach, 110 grams (6 large) tiger shrimps, salt, sesame oil and ground white pepper, and pulse until the shrimps are chopped into large pieces. Transfer to a bowl, cover and chill in the fridge until needed.",
      "TO WRAP AND STEAM:Lightly dust the working surface with potato starch/cornstarch (depends on which you're using). Take a piece of dough, about 1 1/2 tbsp, and roll it lightly in potato starch/cornstarch so it doesn't stick. Roll it out into a circle about the size/thickness of normal dumpling wrappers. Place about 1 tbsp of filling in the middle and close the wrapper up with three pointy corners (or whatever shape you find easy to work with). Make sure to pinch the seams tightly together. Repeat until your are done with all the fillings (you may have more dough left). The process could significantly speed up if you've got a 2-people assembly-line set up.\r\n\r\nYou can steam them immediately, or wrap them individually and freeze for up to 1 week.\r\n\r\nBring 2 cups of water to boil in a large wok, or the bottom-pot of a steamer. Brush oil over the bamboos on the steamer surface where you're placing the dumplings (to prevent sticking, or even better if you have one of those steamer-fabric specific for this purpose, or a sheet of cabbage works fine, too). Place the dumplings into the steamer and place it over the hot water. Cover and steam on high heat for 5 ~ 6 minutes. The glass wrapper would seem more opaque when it's hot, and turn more translucent once cooled down slightly.\r\n\r\nThe best condiment to serve with is, yellow mustard and sriracha sauce."

Starting with the bottom piece of bread, lay down the carrots, followed by the cauliflower. Tear the basil leaves with your hands and place them on top of the cauliflower. Next, add the provolone, followed by the roasted red peppers. Place a handful of arugula onto the top piece of bread. If there is excess oil leftover from your olive mixture, drizzle some of this over the arugula. Close the sandwich, slice it into wedges, and enjoy."

      "In the same skillet, melt another 2 tablespoons of butter and add the chopped mushrooms. Salt and pepper the mushrooms and saute until they are tender and all the liquid exuded by the mushrooms has evaporated, 5 minutes. Remove from the heat.",
      "While you are cooking the onions and mushrooms, peel and quarter the potato(es) and place in a small pot. Cover with cold water, bring to a boil, then lower heat and simmer until soft and mashable, 15 to 20 minutes. Drain and place in a large mixing bowl.",
      "If you want the filling a bit richer, melt the extra 2 tablespoons of butter and add to the potatoes. Mash and whip the potatoes until smooth and fluffy. Fold in the cooked mushrooms and the caramelized onions until well blended. Salt and pepper again to taste.",

      "Using a 3-inch (7 1/2 cm) round cookie cutter (they can be made larger if you like) carefully cut out circles, trying not to deform the circles of dough too much, although this dough is easy to work with and \"correctable\". I lifted up the circles, 2 or 3 at a time, and made sure they were on a floured section of the table before trying to fill and fold. With floured fingertips, I tapped each circle a bit to stretch out the circle. Place a mounded teaspoon of filling just off of the center of each round of dough.",
      "Now, gently pull the wider half over the mound of filling and place the side edge-to-edge with the side with the dough. Nith the edges matching/meeting, just press with the side of your floured index finger, pulling the dough and pressing to seal. The edge should be a bit less than a finger's-width. This will also keep the edge from being too thick. Be very careful not to rip the dough covering the filling.",
      "As you form the pieorgi, 1, 2 or at the most 3 at a time, place them on a floured or lined and floured plate or baking sheet until you are ready to cook.",
      "Bring a pot of water to a boil. Once it is boiling, lower a bit to a healthy simmer and drop in the pieorgi just 6 or 7 at a time (they shouldn't crowd or overlap in the pan). Allow to cook for 6 to 7 minutes. They should float to the top and, when lifted out with a slotted spoon, should look puffy. Cook the rest in batches. Place on towels to drain.",
      "To fry, simply heat olive oil or a mixture of butter and olive oil in a skillet and fry the pierogi for a few minutes per side, in batches, again, not overcrowding. They should be golden on each side.",

For a visual how-to, please see my flicker photostream, start here: http://www.flickr.com/photos/heathersage/5867264872/in/photostream.",

With a sharp knife (I love my Global GS-5 for this, and most, tasks, though a paring knife works well, too), cut off both ends, slicing only until you hit the fruit; place on one of its ends so it's nice and non-rolly. Following the curve of the fruit, carefully slice off the peel, leaving none of the bitter pith behind. Pick up grapefruit and carefully cut out the segments by cutting on either side of the membrane separating them. (Don't stress if there seems to be a lot of fruit left behind, attached to the membrane. It's not a waste since you'll juice that part for use in the dressing and to prevent the avocado from turning brown.)",

Mix with a wooden spoon until the dough comes together and pulls away from the side of the bowl. Knead in the oil. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth. Clean out your mixing bowl, and lightly grease it. Return the dough to the bowl, turning it to coat it in oil. Cover and let rise until doubled, about an hour.",

Roll out the dough into a rectangle about the size of say, a 9x13 sheet pan. You want the dough to be thin, but not so much so that it is transparent. Brush it with a thin layer of vegetable oil. Sprinkle on some of the sugar-cocoa mixture brushing it so that it spreads and becomes paste-like. Add more filling until it no longer forms a paste and you have a layer of sandy looking sugar-cocoa mixture. Starting from the edge of the width closest to you, tightly roll the dough. Once the dough is rolled, tuck the edges in on the themselves so that the filling doesn't spill out, and lay the roll, seam side down, on a baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining pieces of dough. Cover and let rise until doubled. This will take anywhere from 30-45 minutes.",

The loaves can also be frozen whole. They'll stay a good while in your freezer-about 2-3 months."

Then, on a medium high speed, add the eggs one at a time, mixing very well after each addition. When you get to last egg, whisk it seperately and add half first, if the dough is still too stiff, add the other half. The right consistency is when you dip the paddle into the dough and, when you lift it up, it forms sort of a V shape on the tip, it's not so loose that it will fall off the paddle and not so stiff that wouldn't stick to the paddle enough.

Sprinkle some of the chopped pistachios on top.",

Then turn off the heat, close the oven door and leave it there for 10 minutes to dry out. Let it cool completely.",

But a gratin is a very accommodating thing; a little more or less celery root, potato or apple won't hurt anything.\r\n\r\n- You can make this in a 13 x 9-inch baking dish if you like. The gratin will be thinner and there will be more of the crispy, golden-brown top to go around. This is an especially good option if you're going to serve the gratin as part of a holiday buffet for a lot of people. I prefer to make it in a smaller roasting pan (the one pictured measures 8 x 12 inches), which yields thicker slices. \r\n\r\n- This dish has always been a crowd-pleaser for me and I've had many sworn blue cheese haters ask for seconds. If you're serving this to anyone who claims to dislike blue cheese (!), I have two recommendations: First, use a mild, creamy and salty blue cheese rather than a dryer, more pungent one. I recommend Fourme d'Ambert or Bleu d'Auvergne. These two French blues are delicious, fairly mild and have the added bonus of being inexpensive as far as cheeses go. A second, sneakier, option is to fail to mention that the gratin contains blue cheese. A lot of people never even realize it's there.\r\n\r\n- If you really, REALLY hate blue cheese, just substitute another sharp, salty cheese. Sharp white cheddar or an aged gruyere would be delicious."

For ghee, you can also buy this premade, or you can make your own by simmering a pound of butter in a heavy saucepan for about an hour, then straining out the solids.

When it's melted (do not let it brown), saute the pineapple rings in batches until caramelized, about 3-5 minutes per side. Remove the pineapple rings to a plate and cover to keep warm. Once the pineapple is finished, move on to the bacon. Using the same skillet, pan-fry the bacon in batches until just crisp. Remove from heat to a plate (separate from the pineapple) and cover to keep warm.",

Form the seasoned meat into patties that will fit nicely on your rolls, about 2-3 inches in diameter. Arrange the patties on the prepared baking sheets. Cook in the oven for about 4 minutes on each side for medium-rare, melting the slices of cheese 1 minute prior to desired doneness. You can cut samples open, or check the temperature of your burgers with a thermometer: 130-135\u00b0F for medium rare, 140-145\u00b0F for medium.",

Spread steak sauce on the bottom bun of each burger, then top with bacon, cheeseburger patties, pineapple wedge, and one or two candied jalapenos, in that order. Cover with the top buns and secure the ingredients together with a toothpick. Arrange on a big tray and serve to happy guests before you eat them all yourself."

After doing this with a few pieces of meat, gently shake the bread crumb bag so that they don't stick to each other. Continue doing this until every piece is breaded. Evenly arrange the breaded pork on a baking sheet.",

Add the pork to the top rack of the oven after flipping the delicata and cook for 15 minutes, flipping midway. The delicata is done when soft and beginning to brown, and the pork is done when golden brown and cooked through. Check for doneness by cutting through a piece after 15 minutes.",

Do the same from the opposite end, then from side to side, for a total of four stretch-and-folds. Divide dough into the number of pies you plan to make: I divided into 5, as Reinhart recommends, but the dough also divides nicely into 3, for bigger pies. Form each piece into a ball and either put each into an oil-sprayed plastic bag, or set them atop parchment-lined baking sheets and cover tightly with plastic wrap. Refrigerate overnight or up to 4 days, or freeze up to several months.",

      "Meanwhile, prepare ramps: rinse in several changes of water, pat dry, and remove bulbs from leaves. Slice bulbs into thin disks, and slice leaves lengthwise into 2 or 3 slices. Heat a small pan with a couple inches of water over medium heat until water boils. Blanch bulb slices for 45 seconds, then leaves for 30 seconds, removing each immediately with slotted spoon and setting aside.",
      "Coat your hands with flour. Choose one dough ball, sprinkle a bit of flour on top, then flip over onto baking sheet and use your thumbs to slowly coax the edges of the dough into a larger circle. Work from the edges, not from the middle; the middle will spread as the edges are drawn out. Keep turning and stretching, turning and stretching, about 13 times (according to my pizza hero Jim Lahey), until dough is quite thin. If dough resists or shrinks back, let it rest a few minutes, then return. Do your best to preserve the little gas bubbles in the dough as you stretch it; they'll make lovely charred lumps in your pizza.",
      "At this point, you're ready to top your pizzas. Start with mozzarella slices. Then grate parmesan onto pies. Top with ramp bulbs and leaves, and dot fresh ricotta overtop. Finish each pizza with a swirl of olive oil and a light sprinkle of flaky salt.",

Remove pies, and try to wait a couple minutes before taking a bite, or the roof of your mouth will not be happy!"

      "First, you'll need to pre-scoop your ice cream and freeze the individual balls. I found it was easy to freeze them in a plastic wrap-lined egg carton, which cradles the mini scoops and gives you an idea of how big each should be. Take the ice cream out of the freezer to soften for a few minutes; meanwhile, line an egg carton with plastic wrap. Use a small scooper (I used a cookie scooper) to divide the ice cream among the divots. Send back into the freezer for a couple of hours or until rock-solid. (If you'll be freezing the ice cream scoops any longer, you'll want to go back in and wrap the whole carton in more plastic to ward off freezer burn.)",
      "When the ice cream balls are good and frozen, it's time to make mochi! In your microwave. Whisk the flour and sugar together in a microwave-safe bowl. Add the water and whisk to combine.",
      "Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and microwave for 1 minute. Use a wet rubber spatula to stir the mixture, then re-cover and microwave for 1 more minute. Stir again, cover, and microwave for 30 final seconds. The color should now be translucent.",
      "Lay down a piece of parchment on your work surface, then use a fine-mesh sieve or sifter to cover it with potato starch (or cornstarch, or additional rice flour). Transfer the mochi to the parchment, sift over more starch, and wait for it to cool down enough to handle.",
      "Use a rolling pin to roll the mochi out so that it's about 1/4-inch thick. Applying more starch as you need to. Transfer the parchment to a baking sheet and refrigerate for about 15 minutes, until firm and cool to the touch.",
      "Use a 3- or 3 1/2-inch cookie cutter to cut rings out of the mochi. (Err on the big side-it's better to have too-big circles than too-small ones.) You can mush the scraps back together and reroll to form additional circles, though they may be a bit tougher and therefore harder to work with later on. Dust the excess starch off the circles with a pastry brush, then stack them on a plate so that there is a layer of plastic wrap below each one.",
      "Now put on a pair of plastic gloves if you have them. Working preferably with one ice cream scoop at a time (and in close proximity to the freezer!) take a mochi circle, with the plastic wrap beneath it, place the ice cream on top, and move quickly to wrap and smoosh the mochi around it. Use the plastic wrap as a guide to tie everything together (I twist it very tightly at the seam to hold all the parts inside-almost like a harness!). Transfer the mochi ball to the freezer, then proceed until you've gone through all the ice cream. Freeze the balls for at least a couple of hours, until frozen solid. Before serving, let the mochi sit at room temperature for about 5 minutes, until the outer layer has returned to its soft, smooshy state."

      "Using a heavy knife, crush your peeled garlic into a cutting board until you reach a paste consistency. (This can be done in a small food processor if you're in a hurry.) Do the same with your anchovy fillets and combine in a mixing bowl. Add 2 T egg yolk, 6 T grated parm, 3/4 cup olive oil, and 2 T lemon juice. Whisk well to emulsify. Taste and adjust seasoning as necessary.",
      "Cut hearty slices of the sourdough bread, about 1\" thick. Brush both sides well with olive oil and throw them on the grill. When you have dark grill marks and charring on one side, flip it and do the same to the other. Remove from heat and slice a garlic clove in half. Scrape the cut side of the garlic over the surface of each toast. Reserve.",
      "In a small mixing bowl, toss the cherry tomatoes with 2 T extra virgin olive oil and season to taste with salt and freshly ground black pepper. If your grates are narrow enough or if your tomatoes are big enough, throw them right on the grill, turning periodically until blistered and bursting at the seams. If the tomatoes are at risk of falling through, place a sheet of foil on the grill and do the same.",

      "To plate: Place a piece of grilled toast on each plate. Lean the two romaine heart quarters against the toast so that they cross over each other like an 'x'. Toss a few blistered tomatoes on each plate. Spoon dressing over the romaine hearts to taste. Using a vegetable peeler (I find the 'y'-peelers work best), shave curls of Parmigiano Reggiano to place over the center of your crossed romaine hearts."

You can either call it a day here-you'll have a pourable, more liquidy caramel-or continue to whisk it over medium heat for 5 to 8 minutes, until golden bubbles seem to rise and fall under the surface of the caramel, for a thicker caramel sauce that will be spoonable cold from the fridge (my preference). At any point, you can test how thick the caramel is by dripping a bit onto a cool plate and tilting the plate. (This is a good opportunity for taste tests, too.) Keep in mind that, either way, it will thicken a bit as it cools.",

Take half the dough, shape it into a chubby sausage with a 1 1/2\" diameter, and wrap it tightly in your covering of choice. Repeat with the remaining dough. Refrigerate until totally firm (overnight is best).",

Set the rounds of dough onto one of the prepared sheets, leaving a few inches between (they will spread). Bake 12 minutes -- the cookies should be set enough to have something of a crust, but won't feel totally set. Remove from the oven, and let cool on the sheets. Repeat with remaining disc. The cookies will remain slightly soft when warm, but firm up upon cooling. They're delicious either way."

Once the mixture comes to a simmer, stop stirring. If there's any of the mixture on the sides of the pan, use a pastry brush dipped in water to wash down the sides of the pot. Cook until the mixture reads 300\u00b0F on a candy thermometer. Let the mixture cool to 275\u00b0F, then dip a fork into the sugar mixture. When the sugar syrup begins to stream from the fork, whip it back and forth over the handles of the wooden spoons-it will form thin ribbons of sugar. Let them collect until there's a large amount, then gently remove from the wooden spoon and form into a ball. Place it on top of the cake."

      "Note: Annatto seeds (also known as achiote) are small seeds that are naturally covered in a red pigment. The seeds are fried in oil, which turns the oil a deep orange color. This oil is a necessary ingredient in many Latin American dishes, including sopa seca. If you cannot find annatto seeds, a teaspoon of ground annatto powder will suffice. Add it to the pot after you have added the aji panca paste. Aji panca paste is made from a dried red chili that has a mild, chocolatey sweetness and smoldering heat. It forms the backbone of many Peruvian dishes. You can find it at many Latino stores or online."

      "Place the figs in a bowl and pour boiling water over them; let them sit for at least 15 minutes to soften. Drain figs and remove the stems with a sharp knife before chopping roughly. Place in a food processor and blitz until you have a paste, then transfer to a bowl.",
      "Place the walnuts and pistachios in the food processor and chop finely-but leave them a little rough; don't go so far as to turn this into a paste too. Add to the figs, along with the rest of the filling ingredients. Combine well and chill in the fridge for a couple of hours at least, but it's better to leave it overnight to let the flavors develop.",
      "For the pastry: Place first four ingredients in a bowl. Rub the butter into the flour mixture (or pulse in a food processor) until it resembles bread crumbs. Add the eggs and yolk and combine until you have a smooth dough. If it is a little too sticky, add a small amount of flour until it no longer sticks to your hands. If it's dry or crumbly, add some cold water, a little at a time, until it comes together. Wrap firmly in plastic wrap and place in the fridge to rest and chill, at least 1 hour but better overnight.",
      "To assemble: Cut the chilled dough into 4 to 6 smaller portions and work one portion at a time (keeping the others wrapped in plastic and chilled). Roll first into a sausage shape, then flatten and roll out on a lightly floured surface to a long rectangle, no more than an 1/8-inch thick. Place filling along the middle of the rectangle lengthways in a long, thin log shape, no more than an inch wide. Roll the pastry around it to enclose completely, overlapping the dough just a little bit. Trim off the extra pastry. Roll the log gently with the palms of your hands to seal the edges and tighten and lengthen the log ever so slightly. Cut 3-inch pieces of the log with diagonal cuts. (It helps if both the pastry and the filling are chilled, so if possible, work a bit at a time and keep chilled anything that you are not using).",
      "Prepare a baking sheet lined with baking paper. To make an \"X\" shape, use a very sharp knife to cut about 1 1/4-inch incision from top and bottom of the logs (leaving about 3/4 inch uncut in the middle) and separate gently to form an \"X.\" To make an arch, make 1/2-inch incisions along the side of the log, then gently bend to form into an arch. Place cookies on baking sheet and bake at 350\u00b0 F (180\u00b0 C) for about 15 to 20 minutes, or until the pastry is just beginning to turn golden. Remove from the oven and let cool.",
      "In the meantime, prepare the glaze (if using). With a fork, beat the whites until they become frothy. Add the 2 1/2 cups confectioner's sugar until you have a smooth paste the consistency of honey. Add more sugar if not thick enough and, if necessary, you can strain the mixture through a sieve again to make it perfectly smooth. Spoon or brush the glaze over the tops of the cookies and either leave as they are or top with a pinch of chopped pistachios or colored sprinkles. You could also simply dust with confectioner's sugar.",
      "Place the glazed cookies back on the baking tray and return to the oven for a further 5 minutes or until the glaze feels dry and set. Let cool completely before serving. Keep in an airtight container."

It's similar to the method of dicing onions, keeping the onion intact at the root end. Turn your apple quarter to the other flat side and make a few long cuts again. Now rotate your apple piece sideways and dice. For me, this is much easier and quicker than stacking unwieldy slices. But you dice or chop your apple any way you like; it's your apple, and it'll taste great any which way.",

Flip the orange over and remove remaining pith using the same technique. Now turn the fruit on its side, so that the core is facing you. Cut between the membranes to achieve juicy segments that are pith and membrane free. Place segments in a bowl and set aside until ready to use."

      "About 1 1/2 - 2 hours before you'd like to bake (depending on how warm your kitchen is), take the dough out of the refrigerator, and allow to come to room temperature for ~45 minutes to take the chill off. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper, or brush them heavily with olive oil. Gently divide the dough into two balls (they might be a bit more like blobs then balls), and place them on the prepared sheets. Let sit 10 minutes to relax, then, with oiled or wet hands, use your fingertips to sort of pat-and-push the dough out into 9\" circles from the inside out, dimpling them without totally compressing them (if they resist, you can pat them out a little, let the dough rest ~5-10 minutes, then pat them out a little more and repeat as needed-it's important you press the dough out to out least this diameter, otherwise it will be too thick to cook properly). Let rise for ~30-45 minutes (depending upon the heat of your kitchen, and how warm/risen the dough was when you started working). While the dough is rising, preheat the oven to 500.",
      "When the dough has risen, scatter the lemon slices and rosemary needles over the top, and drizzle with the remaining 2 Tbsp olive oil, and scatter on the remaining 2 tablespoons sugar and 2 teaspoons coarse salt. (that's 1 Tbsp/tsp per focaccia). Place the trays in the oven, then turn down the heat to 450. Bake for ~20 minutes, until the focaccia has cooked to a golden brown (it may seem a little underdone in some parts, especially around the lemons, but as long as their are no large uncolored spots you'll be fine). Let cool slightly, then serve warm or at room temperature (ideally as soon as possible)."

      "In a 5 quart bowl or lidded Food Storage Container, dump in the water and add the yeast and salt. Dump in the flour all at once and stir with a wooden spoon. Stir it until all of the flour is incorporated into the dough, it will be a wet rough dough. Put the lid on the container, but do not snap it shut. You want the gases from the yeast to escape. Allow the dough to sit at room temperature for about 2 hours to rise. When you first mix the dough it will not occupy much of the container. But, after the initial 2 hour rise it will pretty much fill it. DO NOT PUNCH DOWN THE DOUGH! Just let it settle by itself.",
      "The dough can be used right after the 2 hour rise, but it is much easier to handle when it is chilled. It is intended for refrigeration and use over the next two weeks, the flavor will deepen over that time, developing sourdough characteristics. The next day when you pull the dough out of the refrigerator you will notice that it has collapsed and this is totally normal. It will never rise up again in the container.",
      "Dust the surface of the dough with a little flour, just enough to prevent it from sticking to your hands when you reach in to pull a piece out. You should notice that the dough has a lot of stretch once it has rested. (If your dough breaks off instead of stretching is probably too dry and you can just add a few tablespoons of water and let it sit until the dough absorbs the additional water.)\r\nCut off a 1-pound piece of dough using kitchen shears and form it into a ball. For instructions on how to form the ball watch one of our videos. Place the ball on a sheet of parchment paper.",
      "Let the dough rest for at least 40 minutes, (letting it go 60 or 90 minutes will give you a more open hole structure in the interior of the loaf.) You will notice that the loaf does not rise much during this rest, in fact it may just spread sideways, this is normal for this dough.",
      "Preheat the oven to 450 degrees with a Baking Stone on the center rack, with a metal broiler tray on the bottom (never use a glass vessel for this), which will be used to produce steam. Cut the loaf with 1/4-inch slashes using a serrated knife. Slide the loaf into the oven onto the preheated stone and add a cup of hot water to the broiler tray. Bake the bread for 30-35 minutes or until a deep brown color.",
      "If you used parchment paper you will want to remove it after about 20-25 minutes to crisp up the bottom crust. Continue baking the loaf directly on the stone for the last 5-10 minutes. Allow the loaf to cool on a rack until it is room temperature. If you cut into a loaf before it is cooled you will have a tough crust and a gummy interior. If you have any leftover bread just let it sit, uncovered on the cutting board or counter with the cut side down. If you cover a bread that has a crust it will get soggy."
