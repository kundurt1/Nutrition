Wash beans again to make sure they are clean enough to eat. Using a large open pan, cook beans by covering them with water in the pan. Cook until their color changes and they are tender when tested with a fork. Let cool. Drain the water off. Pack into a stone churn in approximately 2-inch layers. On top of each layer, sprinkle heavily with salt, approximately 3 tablespoons of salt per layer of beans. Use all the beans and fill churn as full as possible. Top the beans with a saucer turned upside-down and a clean rock from the creek on top of the saucer to keep it weighted down. Tie a clean cloth around the top of the churn and put a lid or a heavy plate on top of cloth. This protects the brine from gnats, also known as Lewis Grizzard's fruit flies which people in the south inherited."
