      "- My trick for making perfect pancakes: I start out with the pan over medium heat. Once hot, I add a little bit of butter or oil and spread it around. Then I add the batter and once it's in the pan, immediately turn the heat down just a touch. Cook the pancakes until golden on both sides (flipping once), then remove the cooked pancakes and wipe out the skillet. Then turn the heat back up to medium, and repeat the entire process with the next batch of batter."

      "Preheat the oven to 350 F. Lightly grease a springform cheesecake pan.",
      "Combine the cookie crumbs and melted butter in a small bowl. Toss with a fork to moisten all of the crumbs. Using a flat-sided glass, press the crumb mixture into an even layer covering the bottom and sides of your cheesecake pan (you want it to be tall so try to get to about 2.5-3 inches up the side of the pan-and a little thicker than for your usual cheesecake-maybe 1/4 inch thick so it won't crumble). Bake the crust for about 6 minutes and then remove it from the oven and let it cool as you make your cheesecake filling.",
      "In a large bowl, beat the cream cheese and sugar on medium-high speed until well blended. Beat in the flour. Add in the vanilla and beat until well incorporated, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed. Beat in the eggs one at a time, scraping down the bowl between each addition. Pour the filling into your crust.",
      "Bake until the top is lightly browned, puffed and cracked at the edges, and the center moves only very slightly when the pan is lightly shaken (about 40 minutes). Check periodically while baking and put a pie shield (or strips of foil) around the top of your pan to protect the crust edges if they're getting too dark. Just don't let the shield/foil touch the crust-it's delicate and might crumble.",
      "When you pull the cheesecake out of the oven, you can use a sharp knife to score a circle around the top of the cheesecake about an inch inside the crust so that as it cools and chills/sinks, it won't pull the crust in too much. Don't worry if the circle you cut isn't pretty, because you won't be able to see it in the finished product! Let cheesecake cool completely on a wire rack before chilling it in the fridge for at least 3 hours.",

Fill a plastic zip bag with the mixture and cut off the corner. Pipe the cheesecake mixture into small swirls on a silicone mat or wax paper. Freeze these until firm (mine only took about 45 minutes).",
      "Make frosting: Whip cream cheese until fluffy. Mix in all other frosting ingredients and mix on medium-high speed until combined.",
      "When cake is cooled and crumbled, start mixing frosting in. Start with about 1/2 cup of frosting and mash/stir with your fingers, pressing together to feel the texture. You're looking to reach a playdough-like consistency. I think I used about 3/4 cup of frosting total, but the amount you use will depend on how much cake you have crumbled in your bowl.",
      "Make cake balls: Once your cake mixture is ready and your cheesecake middles are frozen firm, you're ready to assemble your cake balls! Take a frozen cheesecake middle and pack some cake around it. Roll it into a ball and place it on a silicone mat or wax paper. Continue until all cake balls are rolled. Chill these in the refrigerator overnight. I don't freeze mine like some sites suggest, because I find chilling them in the fridge instead reduces cracking after I dip them.",
      "Dip cake balls: After cake balls have chilled overnight, melt candy melts or candy coating according to the package directions. I keep my bowl of candy melts situated in a bigger bowl of hot water to keep them warm and fluid, but be careful no water gets into the melts or they'll seize!",
      "To dip cake balls, insert a toothpick into the center and dip them in the candy coating, using a spoon to help coat them. Then hold the cake ball over the bowl, gently bouncing and turning it to drain the excess coating off (this is how you avoid having a huge chocolate \"foot\"). When well-drained, gently wiggle the cake ball off the toothpick onto a sheet of wax paper and add any sprinkles. I noticed my cake balls cracking (because I used an oilier cake), so I stuck them in the fridge as soon as they were dry to prevent this (it always helps for some reason). Serve immediately or store in an airtight container in the refrigerator.",
      "Variations:",
      "-You can leave the cheesecake middles out of this recipe and roll the cake into a solid ball if you want traditional cake pops.",
      "-You can use any flavor of cake (or even a cake mix) for your cake.",
      "-You can add chopped berries to your no-bake cheesecake mixture or even add in chocolate or other flavoring to produce different flavors of cheesecake in the center.",
      "-You can use lollipop sticks or pretzel sticks to make these into cake pops.",
      "-You can decorate with chocolate drizzle instead of (or in addition to) sprinkles."

      "There are people who like to believe that some things never change. But I like to believe that anything can change. Case in point: my passionate feelings toward oatmeal.",
      "Just one short year ago, I hated oatmeal. It literally made me nauseous to think of eating hot mush at breakfast or any other time of day.",
      "And then I went on a 3 month road trip around the country. And it was not fully funded by the Travel Channel. So there were times in which eating whatever was cheapest was the best option. Slowly, reluctantly, I choked down my first few bowls of \"Gas Station Oatmeal\". What's that, you ask? Oh, it's a fine delicacy created by heating a 50 cent package of oatmeal with hot water from the gas station. Desperate times call for desperate oatmeal!",
      "Somehow, I literally don't know how, this odd beginning forged a deep and meaningful relationship between me and oatmeal. One year later, I eat it nearly every day. But I don't drive to the local gas station for the 50 cent variety anymore. No siree. Nowadays, I am ALL about elaborate oatmeal creations. My most recent favorite is this fall breakfast in a jar.",
      "For the oatmeal: combine one quarter cup oats with one half cup water. You can cook it on a stove top over medium heat until thickened, but I am usually rushing to get out the door in the morning so I microwave it for 4 minutes while I do 8,000 other things. Once cooked, add in spices and milk. (You can also add in protein powder, which I usually opt for if this jar is accompanying me to the gym in the morning.) Scoop the oatmeal into a medium sized mason jar.",
      "Next, layer your toppings. For this jar: pumpkin butter, walnuts, banana, and roasted apples (don't tell...but I just used a scoop of apples from the Individual Apple Crisps recipe that I posted here the other day). Top with a lid and run out the door!",
      "Now, here's the beauty of this particular recipe. It's delicious hot, but it's also delicious cold! Unconventional, but true. When heated, it takes on the warm and comforting notes of banana bread. I usually stir everything together when I heat it. But when I eat it cold I like to keep the layers separate. The flavors are so distinct and refreshing!",
      "I've made this for breakfast for three days straight - four, if you count tomorrow. Four hundred, if you count every day for the next year or so. I'll probably still be eating this for breakfast by the time next Christmas comes around."

You can easily omit this step and still wind up with a delicious cheesecake, so feel free to leave it out.

When the butter melts, whisk in the brown sugar, syrup, and salt, stirring until the brown sugar melts. Remove the pan from the heat and whisk in the powdered sugar. Drizzle the glaze over the top of your cooled braid. Sprinkle the braid with the remaining toasted pecans and a dusting of cinnamon. Serve immediately.

(Give them a mix about halfway through with a spoon or spatula, so they don't get burned on the bottom.)",
      "3)Cook the sweet Italian sausage by crumbling it into a hot pan drizzled with just a touch of olive oil, and cook through until golden brown for about 5-6 minutes; let stand, covered.",
      "4)While the pumpkin and apples roast, begin the risotto by preheating a heavy-bottom pan (roughly 3 quart) over medium/medium-high heat; add the 2 Tablespoons of butter and the remaining light oil to the hot pan to melt, then add the chopped onion and sweat for about 2 minutes until translucent;",

      "6)Add the white wine to the rice and onions (careful if cooking with flame), and give a gentle stir; allow the wine to reduce until almost absorbed, but not quite completely;",
      "7)Begin adding the hot chicken stock to the rice mixture, about 1/2 cup to 3/4 cup at a time (about 1 to 1 1/2 ladles), stirring gently to incorporate and allowing the rice to slowly absorb the stock; (adjust your flame if necessary, so the rice is at a gentle simmer, not bubbling too harshly, evaporating the stock too quickly);",
      "8)Once this first increment of stock is mostly absorbed (roughly 3 minutes), add another 1/2 cup to 3/4 cup of stock, stirring and allowing it to almost absorb, repeating this process until the rice is soft and creamy, but not mushy - about 23 minutes or so, total. (*You don't have to stand over the risotto guarding it the entire time, just don't walk away for too long as the stock can absorb fairly quickly.)",
      "9)Once the arborio rice is soft and creamy, turn off the heat; finish with the remaining 1 Tablespoon of butter, the shaved parmesan, the sweet Italian sausage and the roasted pumpkin and apples; gently fold all ingredients together in the pan, and sprinkle in about 1/2 of your chopped fresh sage (about 2 leaves). Check and adjust your seasoning, as far as salt and pepper go, if necessary.",
      "10)Voila! Spoon into bowls or onto plates, and garnish with remaining fresh sage. Enjoy!"

      "For the dough: In a saucepan, brown two Tablespoons of butter over medium heat. You want it to have a nutty aroma and have brown flecks in it. Remove from heat and slowly (very slowly) pour in milk. Stir together, then pour mixture into the bowl of a stand mixer. Allow to sit for about 15 minutes, until the temperature reaches about 105 degrees F.",

Mix together with dough hook attachment. Once combined, add in additional flour. Add flour until the dough has come together into a nice ball shape and is not too sticky. I ended up using a little over 2 1/2 cups of flour, which is what the extra two tablespoons is for.",
      "Remove dough ball and put in a slightly oiled bowl. Place a clean tea towel over the bowl and let the dough rise for about 90 minutes. The dough should nearly double in size.",

Pour filling over the dough and press it down using the back of a spatula. Once filling is spread out, cut dough into about 7 horizontal strips. Stack dough strips on top of each other, then cut strips down the center, horizontally, then cut each strip into 6 pieces vertically, creating small pieces.",
      "Once it is chopped into pieces, place them into a greased loaf pan.",

Stir until everything is combined. Remove from heat and whisk in vanilla and powdered sugar. Pour over the top of the loaf once it is out of the oven.",

      "Stir the sugar and yeast into the warm milk/butter mixture and let it sit for a few minutes. Then stir in pumpkin, salt, and 1 cup flour. If you haven't already, fit your mixer with a dough hook. Start to mix and add the rest of the flour 1/2 cup at a time, stirring between each addition. When the dough is combined, knead on low speed with a dough hook until smooth and elastic (about 4 minutes with a mixer).",
      "Place the dough in a greased bowl and cover it with a damp cloth. Let it rise in a warm place for about an hour until it doubles in size. (After it rises, you can put it in the fridge overnight to use it in the morning, but let it sit out for half an hour before rolling if out if you do.)",
      "Make the filling: While the dough is rising, whisk the sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg together in a small bowl. Toward the end of the dough rising time, melt the 2 tablespoons of butter for the filling - melt it in the saucepan over medium-high heat and brown it as directed above. Put it in a small heat-safe bowl to cool for use later.",

Roll it out to a 20 inch long and 12 inch wide rectangle, lifting corners periodically to make sure it's not sticking. If it seems to be snapping back, cover it with your damp towel and let it rest for 5 minutes before continuing (I had to do this twice during the process).",

Joy the Baker encourages you to use it all even though it seems like a ton, but I admit I got squeamish at the amount and used only most of it. It was fine despite my nerves. Go ahead and pile it on.",

Stack these strips on top of one another and cut the resulting stack into 6 even portions (again, cut it in half, and then cut the halves into equal thirds). Place these portions one at a time into your greased loaf pan, pressing them up against each other to fit them all in. Cover the pan with your damp cloth and place it in a warm place for 30-45 minutes to double in size.",

When it's risen, place the loaf in the center of the oven and bake for 30-35 minutes until dark golden brown on top (if you take it out at light golden brown, it's liable to be raw in the middle, so let it get good and dark). Cool for 20-30 minutes on a cooling rack in the loaf pan while you make the glaze.",
      "Make the glaze: In your saucepan, bring the butter, milk, and brown sugar to a boil over medium-high heat. Remove it from heat, add the powdered sugar and rum, and whisk it to a smooth consistency.",
      "Assemble and serve: Use a butter knife to loosen all sides of the bread from the loaf pan and gently turn it out onto a plate. Place another plate on top and flip it to turn it right side up. Drizzle glaze over top. Serve each piece slightly warm with a drizzle of glaze."

      "1. Cut the butter into small pieces (I do quarter tablespoons), and place in the freezer along with the vodka for about 30 minutes, or until it just starts to freeze.",
      "2. In a small bowl whisk together the flour, sugar, and salt. Dump the mixture out onto a large cutting board or clean counter. Using a bench scraper (a rolling pin also works), work in the frozen butter by smooshing the flat side of the bench scraper into the flour, scooping and mixing it often. When the butter pieces are all flattened and well incorporated, use your fingers to break up any large pieces until they are pea-sized. Sprinkle the vodka over the dough and mix, then 1 Tablespoon at a time, add enough water until the dough just comes together, and all the flour is incorporated. Knead the dough into a ball and cover tightly in plastic wrap. Smoosh the dough flat into a hockey puck shape and refrigerate for 1 hour.",
      "3. After the dough has chilled, preheat the oven to 325 degrees (F) and place the dough on a well-floured cutting board or clean counter. Turning often, and using as much flour as you need to keep it from sticking, roll the dough into an even layer about 1/4\" thick, or until it is large enough to fit into your 9\" pie plate with 1/2\" overhanging. Move the dough to the pie plate and trim any excess dough, leaving that 1/2\" overhang. Fold and pinch the edges of the dough around the pie plate so it's nice and pretty.",
      "4. Lay a sheet of aluminum foil over the dough and carefully scatter pie weights (I use dried beans). Bake on the middle rack of your oven for 12 minutes. Remove the pie weights and the foil, prick the bottom of the crust with a fork, and bake for another 10 minutes.",

      "2. In a small bowl, beat the egg yolks lightly with a whisk for about 30 seconds. Add the sugars and beat until they're a creamy light yellow color, about 2 minutes. Add the egg mixture to the pumpkin mixture and stir until the eggs are fully incorporated. Add the flour a little at a time, stirring after each addition until thoroughly incorporated. Add the buttermilk and bourbon and stir until incorporated.",
      "3. In the bowl of an electric mixer, beat the egg whites to soft peaks in a clean, dry bowl. With a spatula, gently fold the egg whites, one-third at a time, into the sweet potato-buttermilk mixture until thoroughly combined. Pour the mixture into the pre-baked crust and bake on the middle rack of the oven set at 375 degrees (F) until the center is firm and set, about 35 to 40 minutes. Cool the pie completely on a rack, then chill for at least 4 hours before serving.",
      "To make the whipping cream:",
      "1. In a stand mixer, add the cream, maple syrup, and bourbon. Start the mixer at a low speed and work up to high to avoid splashing. Whip the mixture until it is thickened. Taste the whipped cream and add more cream, maple syrup, or bourbon according to your preference. If you're shy, you might want to start with just a teaspoon or two of the bourbon."

      "1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees (F). Grease two 9-inch cake pans with baking spray, line the bottoms with parchment paper, then spray the parchment paper.",
      "2. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, cloves, and allspice. In a large bowl, whisk together the sugar, brown sugar, butter, eggs, pumpkin puree, and vanilla. Add the dry ingredients to the wet, and whisk until just incorporated and smooth.",
      "3. Pour the batter evenly between the two prepared cake pans. Bake for 25-30 minutes, rotating the pans halfway through, until a cake tester (i.e. toothpick) inserted in the middle comes out clean. Transfer the cakes to a wire rack and cool completely.",
      "For the butterscotch sauce:",
      "1. In a medium skillet, melt the butter over low heat. Add the sugar, brown sugar, corn syrup, and salt, and increase the heat to medium to bring the mixture to a boil. Let it boil for 2 minutes, then remove the pan from the heat and stir in the heavy cream and vanilla. Allow it to cool at room temperature. It will seem too thin at first, but don't worry, it'll thicken as it cools.",
      "For the buttercream:",
      "1. In the bowl of your electric mixer (or a medium heatproof bowl if you're using a hand mixer), combine the egg whites and sugar, and place the bowl over a small pot of gently simmering water. Whisk the mixture constantly until the sugar has fully dissolved, about 2-3 minutes. Rub a little between your fingers, and if there is no hint of a grainy texture, it's done (or when it reaches 160 degrees in temperature).",
      "2. Place the bowl in your mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, and set at high speed, beat the egg mixture until stiff peaks form. Continue beating until the eggs are fluffy and the mixture has cooled, about 5-6 minutes. Make sure the stiff peaks don't become dry, you want them to stay glossy.",
      "3. Switch to the paddle attachment and with the mixer on medium-low speed, add the butter 2 Tablespoons at a time, waiting until it is fully incorporated into the mixture before adding the next addition. If the buttercream begins in separate, turn the mixer up to medium-high speed and beat for a few minutes, until it is smooth again. Add the vanilla, salt, lemon juice, and butterscotch sauce (make sure it's cool, you don't want to melt your buttercream), and beat until incorporated. Again, if the mixture separates or thins out too much, beat on medium-high speed until it is light and fluffy again. Taste the buttercream and add more salt, lemon juice, or butterscotch if you think it's needed. Reduce the mixer speed to low and beat for 2 minutes to eliminate any air bubbles.",
      "To assemble:",
      "1. Trim the tops of the cake layers so they are totally flat. Stack the first layer onto a cake plate and using a spatula, spread about 1/2 cup of buttercream in an even layer over the top. Place the second cake layer on top, making sure the two layers line up. Spread a very thin layer of the buttercream around the cake for a crumb layer. This will glue the crumbs to the cake, so they don't show through the light colored buttercream. Then apply a regular, thick layer of the buttercream, until the cake is evenly covered. Sprinkle the top with the toasted pecans and enjoy!"

      "Praline Topping:",
      "1. In a small heavy saucepan, combine brown sugar, butter, and 1/4 cup heavy whipping cream.",
      "2 Cook over low heat until the brown sugar just dissolves, stirring occasionally.",
      "3. Pour mixture into two 9 x 1.5-inch round cake pans.",
      "4. Sprinkle mixture evenly with pecans.",
      "5. Allow to cool slightly, about 20 minutes, while you prepare the cake batter.",
      "Cake Batter:",
      "1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees (F).",
      "2. In a medium bowl, combine flour, baking powder, pumpkin pie spice, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.",
      "3. In a large mixing bowl, beat granulated sugar, oil, and eggs with electric mixer on medium speed until well combined.",
      "4. Add the pumpkin puree and dry ingredients alternately, beating until the mixture is just combined.",
      "5. Carefully spoon the batter over the praline topping in the cake pans, spreading evenly.",
      "6. Place the pans on a baking sheet (to prevent burning the praline topping).",
      "7. Bake for 35 to 40 minutes (or until toothpicks inserted into the centers of the cakes come out clean).",
      "8. Cool cakes in pans on wire racks for no more than 5 minutes. Then invert the pans, allowing the cakes to fall to the wire racks, and replace the praline topping that remains in the pans. (The less time the cakes stay in the pan, the easier it will be to scrape the praline topping from the pan and spread it back onto the cake, but don't remove the cakes so soon that the cakes themselves fall apart. DO NOT allow cakes to cool completely in the pans or your praline topping will be unusable.)",
      "9. Allow cakes to cool completely on the wire racks before assembling.",
      "Whipped Cream Topping:",
      "Note: Make this topping and assemble the cake no more than 1 1/2 hours before serving the cake so that the whipped cream does not break down.",
      "1. Beat the remaining 1 3/4 cups heavy whipping cream with electric mixer until soft peaks form (the tips will start to stand up but then curl over at the top.)",
      "2. Add the sifted powdered sugar and vanilla. (Sifting makes the final whipped cream that much lighter in texture.) Beat until stiff peaks form (the tips will stand straight).",
      "Assembling the Cake:",
      "1. Place one cake layer, praline topping up, on a cake platter.",
      "2. Spread half of the Whipped Cream Topping on the first layer.",
      "3. Add the second cake layer lightly, praline topping up. Do not press down heavily or you will begin the breakdown of the cream.",
      "4. Spread remaining Whipped Cream Topping on the second layer.",
      "5. Sprinkle the top layer of cream with additional pumpkin pie spice, if desired.",
      "6. Chill until serving, no more than 1 1/2 hours to prevent whipped cream from breaking down."

Pour butter and maple syrup mixture over rolled dough and spread out to moisten entire surface. Sprinkle brown sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg on top of the dough and press down lightly. Roll dough up lengthwise into a long, skinny log. Pinch edges of dough together. Using a sharp knife, cut entire log in half (to get 2 pieces). Cut those halves in half again (to get 4). Cut those halves in half again (to get 8 ) and then again (to get 16). Place rolls in prepared pans. (12 rolls in the 9x13, 4 in the other.) If some of the filling oozes out onto your board while cutting, scrape it off and place on top of the rolls to bake (we don't want to lose any filling!). Cover rolls to rise again for 1 hour or until they have almost doubled in size. Bake at 350 degrees for 20-25 minutes or until top of rolls are golden brown. (Check them after 18 minutes just to be sure you don't over bake them.)",

With the mixer on low, slowly incorporate the butter pieces. Mix for 1-2 minutes, until butter and dry ingredients reach an almost sandy consistency. Press mixture into the bottom of a cookie sheet, and bake at 350F until crust is golden brown and slightly crispy. Allow to cool and break into chunks.",

Once fully incorporated, transfer to a large bowl. Fold in the remainder of the cream cheese mixture to create cream cheese ribbons throughout the ice cream. Gently add and mix in half of the pie crust. Save the other half for topping."

      "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Slice pumpkin in half and remove stem. You can cut it in quarters if you want, or just leave it halved. Using a spoon, scrape out all of the stringy stuff and the seeds. (Save the seeds if you want to toast them). Spray a foil-lined baking sheet with non-stick spray. Place your pumpkin cut-side down on the sheet. Cook pumpkin in a 350 degree oven for about 45 minutes or until it's tender when pierced with a fork. When done, remove from oven and let cool on the baking sheet.",

I used the blade attachment of my Cuisinart hand mixer. You can also just mash it with a fork or potato masher. If your pumpkin is on the dry side, you can add a little water to the pumpkin to get the consistency you want.",
      "I drizzled in about 1/4 cup of water until it had the right feel. At this point you can use it in any recipe that calls for pumpkin puree or canned pumpkin. I froze mine in 2 cup measures in zip lock freezer bags. Most recipes I use call for a whole can which is 15 ounces. If the pumpkin puree has a little water in it just place the puree in a strainer and strain off the water before storing.",

Once it has a dark, rich amber color, take it off heat. Working quickly and carefully, pour enough caramel to thoroughly coat the bottom of each ramekin. Evenly divide the caramel among the ramekins. Set aside to cool and harden.",
      "Meanwhile, remove all oven racks except for the lowest one. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Put a kettle of water on the stovetop to boil, and line a roasting pan large enough to hold your ramekins. (Line it with either with a kitchen towel or a silicone mat.)",

Cover each ramekin tightly with foil, then pour hot water into the pan to about halfway up the height of the ramekins. Cook flan in the water bath for about 35 minutes, or until only slightly jiggly.",

      "First off, for me the softball stage is 232 F, and so that's the temperature indicated in the recipe. If you live closer to sea level, adjust as needed. (See note below.)",
      "In a large heavy-bottomed pan, place all the ingredients together except for the vanilla; whisk until smooth. You're mostly trying to incorporate the pumpkin and the spices. Bring the ingredients to a boil over medium-high heat. I usually just put it on high, but I have to watch a little closer so it doesn't scorch. Once it starts to boil, it takes quite a while for the temperature to go anywhere. Be patient. Finally, the temperature will start to move up. Watch it closely from this point. The caramel will start to burn if you don't stir constantly with a wooden spoon.",
      "As the temperature starts to close in on 230 F, I turn the heat down. I want the caramel to come to temperature slower so I can control it better. If you bring it up fast, it has a tendency to keep going and it gets too hot too fast. I bring my thermometer to 230 F and then turn the heat to low so it goes up to 232 F very slowly. At 232 F, I take it off the heat and add the vanilla. Stir until combined and pour the caramel out into a greased 9x13 inch pan. It must be greased or you'll have a big mess that is un-usable. Let it set for an hour or two until cool and firm. Cut into squares and wrap in waxed paper. You could also add toasted pecans or pumpkin seeds to the pan before pouring in the caramel.",
      "Note: at sea level, you would cook the caramel to the softball stage, which is 240 F, but at my house it's not. To check where your softball stage is, you can boil a pan of water. Place the candy thermometer in the water and note what the temperature is when the water starts to boil. If you're at sea level, it should be 212 F. So if your water boils at 204 F like mine does, then your softball stage is now 8 degrees lower than 240 F, meaning 232 F. That's how I got my number. Is it clear as mud? Sometimes that's why candy is a little difficult. You know it's always better to err on the side of underdone (rather than hard) when making caramel. You're teeth might appreciate it."

      "1. Preheat oven to 375F.",
      "2. Cream the butter, sugars, and extracts until light. Stir in eggs. In a separate bowl, mix together dry ingredients, then gently add to the butter mixture. Pour oil over the top and mix just until combined.",
      "3. Drop by cookie-scoopfuls onto a parchment-lined cookie sheet.",
      "4. Bake for 8-10 minutes, just until the edges are very barely browned. The cookies should be puffy and very pale. You definitely don't want to over-bake these, or the cookies will become hard and crunchy. We want soft and chewy.",
      "5. Remove from the oven and slide the parchment paper onto a clean countertop where they can cool completely.",
      "6. To make the royal icing, beat the meringue powder, 10x sugar, and water with an electric mixer for 10 minutes. It should be silky smooth, thick and spreadable when it's done. I use my KitchenAid for this and work on the candy canes while waiting.",
      "7. Unwrap and crush the candy canes until mostly powder and small chunks. I used a mini food processor, but you can use a rolling pin and a plastic bag if you need to get some frustration out.",
      "8. When the cookies are cooled, ice a few at a time, then immediately sprinkle with crushed candy canes (if you try to do them all at once, the icing will set and the candy canes won't stick).",
      "These keep very well if stored in a cool place. Perfect for making a few days ahead of time for your gift baskets and cookie trays.",

Chill in the fridge or freezer for 15-20 minutes or so (you can skip this step, but it makes the dipping a little easier).",

Pour the melted chips into a squeeze bottle for drizzling (if you don't have one, a freezer Ziplock bag works just fine with a small hole snipped off the corner). Drizzle. Allow to set for a few minutes until hardened before packaging. You can stick them back in the fridge or freezer if you like, but it's not necessary.",

Or you have to blend and plunge, blend and plunge, etc. You know the drill, right? So if you have any trouble with your blender, I would recommend blending everything but the ice cream first and then mashing it into the ice cream by hand. If your scooped ice cream sits out at room temp while you measure the other things and get them all ready, then by the time you mash it all together it should be a good consistency."

      "Lightly grease a baking sheet, or use a silicone tray liner. Flouring your hands as needed, form a log about 14 inches long and 6 inches wide. I flatten mine out a bit so it is almost square on top.",
      "Bake for about 30 minutes or until the loaf is light brown and the top is just firm to the touch. Cool the biscotti for 15 minutes, and then using a serrated knife, cut into 1/2-inch slices. Reduce the oven heat to 300 degrees F. Lay the slices flat onto the baking sheet and bake for an additional 7 to 8 minutes until one side is light brown. Turn the slices and bake for an additional 5 minutes. Cool. Store in an airtight container.",
      "Note: I roasted fresh pumpkin to enhance the flavor, pureed it, then left it to drain in a sieve over a bowl in my refrigerator overnight to eliminate the excess liquid. We can't buy canned pumpkin here in Umbria, or at least I've never found it, but you can certainly use canned pumpkin instead of the fresh roasted pumpkin I used. To toast the walnuts, place on a baking sheet and bake in a preheated 350 degree F oven for about 10 minutes. The biscotti do continue to crisp up as they cool, so do be careful not to over-bake them. They should be just lightly browned when removed from the oven."

      "Now for the apple. I used Fuji, but almost any apple will do. Granny Smith would be fantastic. I would not recommend using Red Delicious as they can be kind of mealy. It does not matter at all if the apple turns brown, so don't sweat it. Peel, then chop in medium-sized pieces. Use a mini chopper or food processor to finely chop or even puree the apple. I like little bits of apple in the donuts, so I don't puree. I used a large apple and ended up only using about 3/4 of it. (If you absolutely had to, you could substitute applesauce, but try to get some of the excess moisture out of it first.)",
      "In a large mixer bowl (I used my KitchenAid with the whisk attachment), whisk together the egg, brown sugar, apple, maple syrup, cider, yogurt, and oil. (Note: do not substitute butter for the oil. Using butter will cause the batter to create gluten and you will end up with a cakey donut. Oil keeps the donuts tender and airy like a fried donut.)",

      "I do not miss the greasy fried donut when I eat these! And they are every bit as tender and light and even more flavorful. There is also a lot less guilt when you think about the yogurt and whole wheat. So eat two! I did.",
