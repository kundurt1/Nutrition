Keep wonton wrappers from drying; cover remaining with a damp towel. Place rounded teaspoonful of sausage mixture in the middle of the wrapper. Fold wrapper over filling to form a triangle, sealing edges and removing air bubbles. Repeat with remaining wrappers and filling. Heat 4-inches of oil in a deep-fryer to 350\u00b0. Fry wontons a few at a time until golden, about 1 minute. Serve hot. Makes 30."

Place dough in a greased bowl and turn over to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until double in size (about 1 hour). Punch down dough. Turn out onto a floured board and divide into 12 pieces. Shape each into a smooth ball by gently kneading. Then roll each into a smooth rope (about 18 inches long) and twist into a pretzel shape. Place slightly apart on a greased baking sheet turning loose ends underneath. Let rise uncovered until puffy (about 25 minutes). Meanwhile in a 3-quart stainless steel or enameled pan (not aluminum) bring baking soda water to a boil. Adjust heat to keep water boiling gently. With a slotted spatula, lower one pretzel at a time into pan. Let simmer for 10 seconds on each side, then lift from water, drain briefly on spatula, and place on baking sheet. Let dry briefly; then sprinkle with coarse salt and let stand, uncovered, until all have simmered."
