Set a large electric griddle at its highest setting; brush the tenderloin with the olive oil and sear on all sides until well browned, approximately 10 minutes. Rest the meat for at least 5 minutes or until it is cool to the touch so as not to melt the dough. Place the tenderloin in the center of the dough. Fold top part of dough over, flipping back about 1-inch of dough onto itself. Repeat with the bottom half of the dough. Press together the 2 flaps of dough and seal. Make sure the dough is not too tight around the tenderloin. At the ends of the tenderloin, press together dough to form a seal and cut away any excess. Transfer to a sheet pan, place in the oven and roast to an internal temperature of 125 degrees F, approximately 25 to 30 minutes. Remove from the oven and allow to rest for 30 minutes or up to 1 hour. The tenderloin will continue to cook 10 to 15 degrees more.

      "Melt 3 TB butter in large saute pan or pot. Add garlic and onion, saute over medium heat until fragrant and golden, about 5 minutes.

Remove chicken from pan and cool slightly. Shred chicken and return to pan. Add parsley, figs, cilantro, almonds and olives or preserved lemon. Check seasoning and adjust with salt and pepper. Let cool to room temperature. Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Lay two sheets of filo on a cutting board, short edge towards you. Brush with butter. Lay two more on top of that. Put about a 1/3 cup of chicken about 3\" from edge closest to you. Fold edge up, sides over, and roll up, brushing with a little butter. Place of a parchment lined sheet pan and continue until you run out of filling or filo (they never seem to match up - don't stress it. Filling can be used for lots of stuff, and the filo can be re-frozen.) Brush tops with more butter. Bake 15-20 minutes until well browned. Place on a serving platter, sprinkle tops with powdered sugar and cinnamon and serve. Nice with couscous pilaf as an entree or as a first course by itself."

Spoon into loaf pan and lightly smooth out the top with a spatula. Bake about 1 hours and 15 minutes, or until cake tester comes out dry and clean. Cool thoroughly. It'll seem like the loaf doesn't want to come out. Just give it a few good slaps on the bottom of the pan, and it'll come right out. Great to bake ahead and freeze. Wrap in plastic, then foil. Defrost at room temperature. If you'd like to make three large loaves, triple the ingredients, use a 29 ounce can of pumpkin puree, and mix in a great big bowl. Bake for 1 1/2 hours.

This is done by rolling a suitable amount for each pie and shaping the crust round the base of a glass or jar approximately 3-31/2 inches (7.5-8.5cm) in diameter. Make sure there are no cracks in the pastry - you can trim round the top of the case to make it even. As the pastry cools and gets cool, remove the glass and continue until you have about a quarter of the pastry left to make the lids.",

Reduce the oven temperature to 325\u00b0 and bake for about 45 minutes longer, until the meat is very tender. Let the pork cool, then cover and refrigerate until chilled, at least 2 hours.",
      "3.In a saucepan, cook 1/4 cup of the sugar over moderately high heat until it starts to melt, 2 minutes. Swirl the pan and cook over moderate heat until it is completely melted, 5 minutes. Using a wet pastry brush, occasionally wash down the side of the pan to release any sugar crystals. Add the remaining 1/4 cup of sugar and cook, swirling, until a richly brown caramel forms, 5 minutes. Turn off the heat and pour in 1/3 cup of water. Turn the heat to high and cook, stirring, until the caramel is smooth. Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the fish sauce, tamarind, chile and lime juice.",

      "5.Preheat the oven to 400\u00b0. Cut the cold pork belly into 1 1/2-inch cubes. In a medium cast-iron skillet, heat the caramel over moderate heat. Add the pork and turn to coat with caramel. When the sauce starts to bubble, transfer the skillet to the oven and bake for 20 minutes, turning the pork 3 or 4 times until the cubes are evenly crisp.",
      "6.Using a slotted spoon, transfer the pork belly to plates. Spoon the caramel over the pork. Add the basil to the honeydew salad and spoon it next to the pork. Sprinkle with the cashews and serve"
