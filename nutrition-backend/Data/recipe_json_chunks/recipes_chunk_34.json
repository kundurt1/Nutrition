Check for doneness every 30 minutes, beginning at 2 1/2 hours, by pricking deeply with a cooking fork. When juice running from the hole is clear, not pink, the bird should be done. (Depending on the bird's size and the smoker's temperature, cooking time will vary considerably.) Keep the fire low and smoky, so the turkey cooks and throughout without drying too much on the outside. A small pan of water placed inside the smoker helps keep the bird moist."
