Then poach the raw shrimp for 1 to 2 minutes in boiling water, remove from pan with a slotted spoon, and rinse under cold water to stop the cooking. If you are starting with frozen cooked shrimp, you can defrost them in a bowl of ice water or lemon juice with ice. 2 Place strained cooked shrimp in a bowl. Add lime or lemon juice, some chopped fresh jalapeno or serrano chile and/or a dash of chile powder (can also use chipotle chiles or chipotle chili powder) to desired level of heat, green onion, and cilantro. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Let marinate for 10 to 30 minutes. Strain out the juice. 3 Heat a cast iron or stick-free skillet on medium high. Add a small amount of oil (about 1/2 teaspoon) and spread it around the bottom of the pan with a spatula (you could use butter as well). Place one flour tortilla on the skillet. Flip the tortilla over a few times, 10 seconds between flips. Air pockets should begin to form within the tortilla. Remove the tortilla and repeat with the second tortilla. Leave the second tortilla in the pan and reduce the heat to medium. 4 Sprinkle the tortilla with the grated cheese. Distribute the shrimp mixture on top of the cheese. Place the other tortilla on top. Using two spatulas (one to hold the top in place) flip the quesadilla over when the bottom tortilla is nicely toasted and the cheese has begun to melt. Remove the quesadilla from the pan when the now bottom tortilla has toasted sufficiently. You can also use just one tortilla instead of two, and fold the tortilla over itself like an omelette. 5 Cut like a pie into six pieces. A pizza wheel works well for this. Place on a serving plate. Serve with avocado slices and sour cream. Garnish with chopped fresh cilantro."

Dissolve the squid ink in a little of the remaining stock. Add this to the rice, and then continue adding the rest of the stock. Cook the rice for another 12 minutes, stirring frequently. Add the picada and continue to cook for another 2 minutes, or until the rice has absorbed most of the liquid and is just tender to the bite. Season with salt, then serve."

It will spit very far and yes, it hurts if it makes it to your skin. I included the garlic cloves in this step, which gave them a good chewy texture in the finished dish. The garlic has cooked long enough to become incredibly sweet, but if you'd rather not bite into a clove of garlic, they'll be tender enough to combine into the dish with a fork. This will take just a couple of minutes. When the skin is crispy, remove the chicken to a plate and set aside.",

The blackberry sauce is going to make the risotto a bit thicker than usual but still follow usual risotto instructions. You should get to the point when you use a wooden spoon to divide the risotto and only a film of liquid is left - don't let it burn. Add more broth until you taste a piece and it is al dente (a bit of crunch but not mealy). We used all four cups of broth. Remove from the heat. Add the herbs and stir to mix. Add the duck and the artichokes and parmesan. Stir to mix the flavors. Let stand off heat if you like for a few minutes for the flavors to mingle, stir and serve.

Cook it in a crossing pattern of 2 and 4 on a wall clock to give it the nice grill patterns. I would say depending on the thickness you will cook it about 3-4 minutes each side. You will want to serve this steak rare to a medium rare so it will be on the more delicate side for a tougher cut of meat. Once it is cooked you will remove it and let it rest for about 5 minutes to let the juices circulate back through the meat. while the meat is resting you will finish the shallot sauce.",

You wil take a new sauce pan, or clean the one you just used and add the Port, the shallots and the demi over a medium to medium high heat and reduce by half. When it is reduced by half remove from the heat. You will begin to cut your steak cross the grain and into about 1/4 inch slices and plate. You will then add your roasted shallot sauce. This is an excellent meal served with a starch of some sort such as a baked or fried potato wedges. Enjoy!"

      "1 . In a bowl, sift the flour, cocoa, and baking soda. Put the butter in the bowl of a mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and beat on medium speed until the butter is soft and creamy. Add both sugars, the salt, and vanilla extract and beat for another minute or two. Reduce the mixer speed to low and add the sifted dry ingredients. Mix only until the dry ingredients are incorporated-the dough will look crumbly. For the best texture, you want to work the dough as little as possible once the flour is added. Toss in the chocolate pieces and mix only to incorporate.2. Turn the dough out onto a smooth work surface and squeeze it so that it sticks together in large clumps. Gather the dough into a ball, divide it in half, and shape each ball into logs that are 1 1/2 inches in diameter. Make sure you haven't got an air channel. Wrap the logs in plastic wrap and chill them for at least 1 hour. (Wrapped airtight, the logs can be refrigerated for up to 3 days or frozen for I month.) 3. Center a rack in the oven and preheat the oven to 325\u00b0F. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper. 4. Working with a sharp thin-bladed knife, slice the logs into rounds that are 1/2 inch thick. The rounds might break; just squeeze the broken-off bit back onto the cookie. Place the cookies on the parchment-lined sheets, leaving about 1 inch between them. 5. Bake only one sheet of cookies at a time, and bake each sheet for 12 minutes. The cookies will not look done, nor will they be firm, but that's just the way they should be. Transfer the baking sheet to a cooling rack and let the cookies stand until they are only just warm or until they reach room temperature - it's your call. Repeat with the second sheet of cookies. NOTE: The dough can be made ahead and chilled or frozen. If you've frozen the dough, just slice the logs and bake the cookies 1 minute longer. Packed airtight, baked cookies will keep at room temperature for up to 3 days; they can be frozen for up to 1 month."

Close the air intake to just a sliver and cook for 12 to 15 minutes, depending on the thickness of the fillet and intensity of the fire. When the fish is cooked, it will have a beautiful rusty hue and the meat will flake under gentle pressure. Gently remove the filets to a platter and serve immediately. I like to remove the skin of bluefish and the underlying darkly colored bloodline just beneath it, as these can have strong flavors that some guests do not appreciate. It also helps to remove some of the toxins that are a concern with bluefish, as they tend to aggregate just under the skin."

Using bench scraper to help, turn rectangle 90\u00b0 and repeat rolling and folding, gathering loose bits of dough from outer edges into the center and flouring surface as needed. Repeat rolling and folding a third time. Dough should be somewhat homogenous and creamy-looking with some dry bits around edges. Squeeze a bit in your palm; it should loosely hold together.

Roll dough onto your pin, then unfurl it on a sheet of parchment paper. Slide onto a rimmed baking sheet and chill while you prep the filling.",

      "3. Do not let the temperature of the chocolate exceed 120\u00b0F for dark chocolate or 105\u00b0F for milk or white chocolate. When the chocolate has fully melted, remove the bowl from heat. Wipe the bottom of the bowl to get rid of any condensation.",
      "4. Stir in the remaining third of the chocolate a little at a time. Let it melt before adding more.",
      "5. Let the chocolate cool to about 82\u00b0F. It it is warmer, keep stirring and let it cool some more. If it is cooler, begin reheating in the next step.",
      "6. Once the chocolate is 82\u00b0F, place it back over simmering water. For dark chocolate, reheat to 88\u00b0F to 91\u00b0F. For milk and white chocolate, reheat to 85\u00b0F to 87\u00b0F. Remove the bowl from heat once you have reached the right temperature.",
      "7. Spread a small spoonful of chocolate on a piece of wax paper. If it looks dull or streaky, re-temper the chocolate, starting with step 2. If it dries quickly with a glossy finish and no streaks, the chocolate is in temper.",
      "Once melted chocolate has been tempered, it must be used before it cools and sets. If it cools to about 84\u00b0F to 86\u00b0F and is still fairly liquid, it can be reheated to a liquid consistency. If it has completely cooled and solidified, it should be re-tempered. Heat it for 5 to 10 seconds at a time, stirring and checking the temperature before reheating. For dark chocolate, reheat to 88\u00b0F to 91\u00b0F. For milk and white chocolate, reheat to 87\u00b0F to 88\u00b0F. If you keep your chocolate within these temperature ranges, it will stay in temper and be liquid enough to use.",
      "Several products exist for those who do not want to temper chocolate. They are called",

      "They are usually made of vegetable fats that melt smoothly and set up quickly to a finish that is very similar to tempered chocolate. They may not contain actual chocolate. Nothing can perfectly duplicate the taste and mouth-feel of tempered chocolate, but quality coatings can be good substitutes. They can be cooled and reheated quickly, and as often as necessary."

      "Peel all potatoes and slice lengthwise in half. Soak in water until ready to prepare. At this point, remove pork roast and shred into another pan with one stick of butter. Let this simmer for additional 2-3 hours, adding butter as needed to moisturize. Using a hand-grinder, grind all of the potatoes(catching excess starch to discard). Once all potatoes are ground, add Egg and Baking Powder. With clean hands, begin adding flour 1/2 cup at-a-time and mixing with your hands(it IS messy). At approx. 2- 2 1/2 cups, the Kumla ball should be able to be formed into half size baseballs.(The amount of flour differs for all situations, but adding to much results in overly dry kumla. Trial & Error) With the remaining pork broth still simmering on the stove on medium heat, start dropping kumla balls in as you form them. Balls will sink to the bottom,this is correct. Once you have filled the bottom of the roaster pan with formed kumla balls, cover, and place into a pre-heated 350 degree oven. At the 1 hour mark, remove roaster from oven. Kumla should be floating, and by pushing down on each ball individually, lightly, they will turn over automatically. Place back in oven for an additional 1- 1 1/2 hours. Kumla will be done, when you can slice down the middle and view air pockets and a uniform color throughout. Remove all Kumla from broth and place on serving tray... My family served the Kumla with Shredded Pork and a bowl of melted butter to ladel over plate. Salt and Pepper to taste. And Please. Enjoy. (A nap directly after usually helps the feeling of fullness you will have :)"
