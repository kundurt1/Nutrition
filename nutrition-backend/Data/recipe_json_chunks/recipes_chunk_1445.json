      "Wine Recommendation: To contrast with the cheese here, look for a wine with both good acidity and well-delineated fruit flavors. The earthy red-berry flavors and refreshing tartness of a Bourgogne Rouge, the basic red wine of Burgundy, will be perfect."

      "Get to Know Your Coals and How They Burn. Start by following the directions on the package (seriously). Kingsford's new grooved coals, for instance, burn hotter and longer than the smooth kind, so a single layer of coals puts out a lot of heat. Hardwood charcoal pops and sizzles and burns unevenly, but gives great flavor.",

      "Measure the Heat Constantly. Use your grill's thermometer or, if it doesn't have one, your hand. Low heat (250\u00b0 to 350\u00b0) means you can keep your hand 5 in. above the cooking grate for 8 to 10 seconds before you have to yank it away. For medium heat (350\u00b0 to 450\u00b0), you can keep your hand steady for 5 to 7 seconds; for high (450\u00b0 to 550\u00b0), 2 to 4 seconds; for very high (550\u00b0 to 650\u00b0), 1 to 2 seconds.",
      "Move Your Food Around. Once you've identified which spot on the grill has the desired heat, get your food over there (often the emergency spot will have just the temperature you need, if only for a little while). You may have to move food several times before it has finished cooking. The exception: food that cooks in a flash over a super-hot fire.",
      "Manipulate the Fire. Need it hotter? Push coals together or throw on a few more. Cooler? Separate the coals or cover the grill with the lid. Close lid vents to cool it off even more. (Don't close vents under the firegrate, though, or the fire will go out.)",

      "Toast until someone in the next room asks what you're cooking--2 minutes. Remove from the heat.",
      "Transfer the toasted cashews, spices, and the methi to a mortar and pestle, a mini food processor, or a coffee grinder. Crush or process the spice mixture until it's finely ground.",
      "SEASON AND SEAR THE CHICKEN",
      "Rub the spice mixture into the chicken thighs. Let them soak up the flavors for about 3 to 4 minutes.",
      "Heat a large, high-sided pan appropriate to handle the rest of this braising process. You're cooking 6 thighs and well over a quart of \"stuff.\" medium-high heat.",

      "When the pan has that hot, hazy look, add the chicken thighs in a single layer.",
      "Sear for 2 minutes on each side. Turn off heat and transfer the chicken to a plate.",
      "START THE TOMATO SAUCE",
      "Add the tomatoes, the red onion, 1/2 cup of water, the ginger, the garlic, and the chile. Turn the heat back on and stir to deglaze. (See Step By Step below.)",
      "Simmer for 30 minutes, covered, over low heat.",
      "While the sauce is cooking, let's learn something. Grab a small saucepan.",
      "MAKE A BEURRE FONDUE",
      "Heat up the other 1/2 cup of water to about 190\u00b0. Those little bubbles form on the bottom of the pot, but no bubbling takes place per se. Makes sense? Now, turn off the heat.",
      "Now, using a small wire whisk, stir in the butter, followed by the creme fraiche. This is a version of beurre fondue, an emulsified butter and water \"sauce\" popularized by Thomas Keller when he wrote his French Laundry Cookbook. The creme fraiche makes it a quickie cream sauce. Have fun with that.",

      "Pour the tomato mixture into the blender, put the lid on, and remove the center piece. Further cover with a tea towel, and give a couple of quick pulses. Now, progressively raise the speed, clicking through all the buttons like a 5-year-old, until you get to \"frappe or liquefy,\" favorite 1970s kitchen blender terms.",
      "With the motor running, remove the lid. You're safe. The blender has created a vortex.",

      "1) Dry-heat cooking leads to lovely crusty bits on the pan.",
      "2) You don't necessarily have to add a liquid to start the deglazing process--just something wet (like these tomatoes).",
      "3) Allow the heat to cook down the vegetables, releasing their moisture, and gently scrape the bottom of the pain while you stir. Voila."

Cook over medium-high heat, swirling occasionally so sugar cooks evenly, until sugar is dissolved and syrup is pale golden and as thick as honey, 8-15 minutes. Do not stir; stirring will make the sugar seize up into crystals. Meanwhile, prepare a large bowl of ice and cold water.",
      "When syrup is golden and thick, remove pan from heat and set bottom in ice water 5 seconds to stop the cooking. Set on baking-sheet-lined work surface or a trivet near work area and let cool until syrup forms thin threads (rather than droplets); test by dipping a fork in and lifting.",

(It helps to hold the saucepan in one hand and the fork in the other.) Repeat once or twice, then let sugar cool a few seconds. Quickly ease threads off bowl, starting from the bottom, with your hands (they will be barely warm) and shape into a loose sphere 3 to 4 in. wide. Put sticky fork in glass of water to dissolve sugar. Using a new fork each time (or until it's too gummy to use), repeat sugar-flinging to form 12 to 15 airy sugar cobwebs. You'll probably have to do a few before you get the hang of it, but once you do, it's magic. Also, if the caramel gets too thick, reheat over low heat until thin enough to use.",
