Pour in the milk mixture. Place the combination unit on the 6-hole poacher rack over boiling water in the skillet. Cover the dome cover. Cook for 25 minutes. The cover should rattle slightly. Remove the combination unit from the skillet and let stand until cool. Place a large serving plate over the combination unit and invert onto the plate. Serve warmed or chilled. This recipe is an excellent choice for stack cooking. Cook the Flan on a 6-hole rack above any meal that is cooked in the Dutch-oven, increasing the cooking time to 50 minutes to allow for the lower heat: Yields: 8 servings."
