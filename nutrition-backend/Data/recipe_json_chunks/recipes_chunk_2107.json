      "Slice it medium-thin, brush it with olive oil (garlic infused, if you like, or use garlic butter), and toast it under a broiler or in a saute pan over medium-high heat until crisp.",
      "Then top it with your favorite topping, the most popular being fresh chopped tomatoes marinated in chopped fresh basil, extra virgin olive oil, coarse salt, and pepper.",
      "Another option is to simply rub a slice of the bread with a clove of garlic, and then toast it.",
      "You can return the topped slices to the broiler if you want to melt cheese or heat up the topping.",
      "There are no rules governing toppings except one, the classic culinary law: flavor rules.",
      "Smoked eggplant puree is a topping that we love at home.",
      "To make it, buy 3 or 4 large eggplants and fire up a charcoal grill (this will not work as well on a gas grill, since you need the intense heat of hot coals).",

      "If the roast came without skin, turn it over and also trim away some of the fat from the top side if need be.",
      "All pork bellies have prodigious amounts of fat; how much you leave in place is a matter of personal preference.",
      "Ideally you want a layer just under 72-inch thick, so if the butcher has left more than this, use a large chefs knife to pare it down.",
      "(The fat can be saved for rendering or other use.)",
      "If youve got a separate pork loin and pork belly, check that the outermost fat layer of the pork belly is less than 72-inch thick.",
      "If needed, trim it down.",
      "Next, drape the belly (skin side up) around the pork loin (without tying it), just to get a sense of how it will fit.",
      "It doesnt have to be perfect, but if it extends more than 1 inch over the ends of the loin, trim it down and save the trimmings for another use.",
      "If theres a gap on the underside because the belly doesnt reach all the way around, thats fine.",
      "Also, if youve got a separate piece of pork skin, drape this over the roast and trim it to fit (poultry shears or utility scissors are useful here).",
      "Now arrange the belly, whether separate or attached to the loin, so it is skin side up on a stable surface and, using a box cutter, utility knife, or other razor-sharp knife, carefully (but firmly) score the rind in parallel lines about 1/2-inch apart, cutting through the rind and just into the fat (about 1/4-inch deep) without cutting through to the meat.",
      "The lines can go in any direction that appeals to you.",
      "Season and tie the roast: In a small bowl, combine the garlic, 1 1/2 tablespoons salt, 2 teaspoons black pepper, the rosemary, sage, thyme, fennel, zest, and red pepper flakes.",
      "For the single-piece roast, unroll the belly flap and sprinkle the seasonings evenly over the belly and the roast, rubbing lightly so the seasonings adhere.",

      "For the 2- or 3-piece roast, sprinkle half the seasonings all over the loin and the other half on the meat side of the belly, rubbing lightly so they stick, and then wrap the belly (skin side out) over the loin, so the belly covers the top side (fat side) of the roast thoroughly and any gap is on the bottom (or rib side).",
      "If the skin is a separate piece, drape it over the top.",
      "Secure the entire ensemble with kitchen string, tying loops at 1- to 2-inch intervals.",
      "Season the surface of the roast lightly but evenly with salt and pepper (about 3/4 teaspoon each), getting some into the score marks as well.",

      "Roast for 25 minutes and then reduce the oven temperature to 325 degrees (300 degrees convection), Continue to roast until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of the roast registers 140 to 145 degrees, another 3 hours or so-but its a good idea to start checking the temperature after another 2 hours.",
      "Rest and Carve: Transfer the roast to a carving board, preferably one with a trough.",

      "Combine the flour, salt, pepper, and nutmeg and stir them into the ricotta mixture, combining all into a thick paste.",
      "Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and permit it to rest in the refrigerator at least 4 hours, or as long as overnight.",
      "Roll portions of the rested, chilled dough into ropes about 3/4 inch in diameter and 10 inches in length.",
      "Cut the ropes into 1-inch lengths and place them on a tray lined with a clean kitchen towel sprinkled with chestnut flour.",
      "Roll the gnocchi about in the flour.",
      "Repeat the process until all the gnocchi are coated.",
      "Cover the gnocchi with another clean kitchen towel and permit them to dry while you make the sauce.",
      "In a large saute pan over a medium flame, heat the olive oil and cook the garlic until it is transparent, taking care not to color it.",
      "Add the mushrooms, sprinkling with sea salt and generous grindings of pepper.",
      "Toss the mushrooms about in the fat, until they give up their juices.",
      "Add the wine and bring to a quiet simmer.",
      "Cover the pan with a skewed lid and, over a gentle flame, permit the mushrooms to absorb their juices and the wine until they are plumped and soft, about 1/2 hour.",
      "Mince the parsley leaves and stir into the mushrooms.",
      "Cover the pan and let the mushrooms rest for a few minutes while you cook the gnocchi.",
      "In a large pot, bring abundant, sea-salted water to a boil and drop in the gnocchi.",
      "As the gnocchi begin to rise to the surface, remove them with a slotted spoon and place in a warmed, shallow bowl.",
      "When all the gnocchi have been cooked, pour over the barely reheated mushrooms and all their juices and portion onto plates or shallow bowls."
