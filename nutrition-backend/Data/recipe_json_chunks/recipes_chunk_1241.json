      "Freezing storage of sausage and cured meat is relatively limited: after more than 2 to 4 months at Zero F / -18C, the salt in the fat causes it to become rancid.",
      "This is why country-dwellers wait for winter weather to slaughter hogs and beef for there own table.Once in cure, meat should be held 36-38 F/2-3 C: for the largest pieces this means a thermometer inserted to the center of the meatiest part.",
      "Below 36F/2C: salt penetrates the tissue too slowly. If the temp of the storage drops below freezing and stays there for several days, increase the days of salting time by the number of freezing days."

In a spice mill or clean coffee grinder, grind the toasted spices together, with 1 1/2 teaspoons of kosher salt and the brown sugar. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.",
      "Rinse the chicken with cool water, inside and out, then pat it dry with paper towels. Massage the chicken skin with the spice rub; make sure you don't miss a spot. Season the inside of the chicken generously with salt and pepper. Stuff the lemons halves, cilantro, and garlic in the cavity and place the chicken in a roasting pan fitted with a rack. Fold the wing tips under the bird and tie the legs together with kitchen string. Drizzle the oil all over the chicken. If you have time, let the chicken marinate for 30 minutes to really get the flavors down deep into the meat. Roast the chicken for 1 hour; pop an instant-read thermometer into the thickest part of the thigh; if it reads 160 degrees F, it's done. Allow the chicken to rest for 10 minutes so the juices can settle back into the meat. Remove and discard the skin from the chicken. Pull the chicken from the bone and shred the meat, with your fingers or 2 forks. Put the shredded chicken in a large bowl and squeeze the lemon halves that have cooked inside the bird over the meat to moisten.",

Cover and let sit for 10 to 15 minutes, then uncover and fluff with a fork.

Add lemon juice, drizzle with olive oil, and season with salt and pepper. Toss gently to combine.",

      "Sometime I used frozen meatballs. Most jellied cranberry sauce come in 16 oz cans so if you decide to use the whole can you'll need to double all the other ingredients. Typical chili sauce comes in 12oz. bottle so you'll need two bottles if you use the full can of cranberry. Hope this helps your shopping.",
      "I have made these numerous times and am ashamed to admit I'm just now reviewing them. Wonderful addition to the regular grape jelly recipes out there with great meatballs -- Based on experience and personal preference with these cocktail meatballs I offer the following suggestions: 1.) Add one packet of Lipton onion soup mix to the meatball mixture if you do not have time to mince or grate the onion. 2.) Bake meatballs over a drip pan to reduce the fat before adding to the sauce. 3.) If using frozen meatballs ENSURE you DO NOT use Italian meatballs as this upsets the balance of the meatballs and sauce (yuck)! 3.) Make the sauce the day before to let the flavors marry - I can't stress what a difference this makes! This recipe gets better the next day. 4.) The Heinz sauce in the round bottle seems to be the best chili sauce for this mixture. Reviewers: I seriously dislike people that rate a recipe based on the changes they have made to the original. I want to state that I rated this recipe on the recipe Lara submitted. The changes I suggested were based on my family's personal preference."

The meat should take about 5-7 minutes until brown on each side. Remove to a plate while you prepare the vegetables.",
      "Vegetables -- In the same pot as you cooked the meat, add a little more olive oil and saute the onions, parsnips, celery root, mushrooms, and garlic. Cook 10 minutes until they begin to soften.",
      "Broth -- Add the beer to deglaze the pan and stir up all the good bits on the bottom of the pan. Add in the beef broth, seasoning and simmer 1 hour covered and 1/2 hour uncovered so the broth reduces a bit. You want a nice thick stew, not too runny. After 1 1/2 hours, the meat should be falling apart.",
      "NOTE: If you like your stew a bit thicker, just mix a little corn starch and water to make a slurry and add to a medium heat stew and it will thicken right up. Just a tablespoon or so should be plenty.",
      "Topping -- Now transfer the stew to a 13x9 baking dish, sprayed with Pam. Now roll out your crescent rolls (1 can at a time) on a counter top with a little flour so they don't stick or on a cutting board. Press the seams together and then I take my rolling pin and just roll it a couple of times to make a nice flat sheet.",
      "Now I like to cut my flat sheet of dough into 8 strips and then lay them across the pie like a checker board. The two crusts make a really pretty presentation. Now if you don't like the checker board pattern, just add it in strips. Anyways you like. Just remember if you put on a solid piece of crust, poke some holes with a fork on the top so the crust can breath. Just like a pie crust.",
      "Butter and Cheese Glaze -- The best part, just melt for 10 second in the microwave the butter and blue cheese with the seasoning. Just enough to make it soft but not liquid. Then brush the blue cheese butter on the crust.",
      "Bake -- 400 for about 17-20 minutes until the crust is done and golden brown. Then just ENJOY! Rich hearty stew, falling apart with a golden flaky crust."

Here are some changes I made based upon other family reviews and my own taste. 1) Instead of boiling chicken, I bought an herb-roasted chicken from the grocery store. I sauteed the onions and peppers alone and added about 2 teaspoons of taco powder at the end. After shredding the hot chicken, I added it to that pan. 2) I put some refried beans in each enchilada. 3) For a beautiful look, I sprinkled the top with sliced black olives. 4) I used about 2 cans of enchilada sauce. Very important! Spray the bottom of the pan and pour some sauce on it before adding the rolled enchiladas. 5) I used flour instead of corn tortillas. I moistened each tortilla with the enchilada sauce before putting it together. (Pour some sauce in a deep bowl and wipe the tortilla on both sides.) This helped keep the enchilada moist and tasty. This is beautiful! Let stand about 5 minutes before serving."

In a large mixing bowl, sprinkle the yeast over the warm water and add the remaining teaspoon of sugar, stir and set aside for 10 minutes, until the mixture is bubbly. Add the lukewarm milk mixture and the eggs, beating until well combined. Add the flour a cup at a time, stirring and using enough flour to form a stiff dough. Turn out onto a floured board and knead until smooth and satiny, approximately 10 minutes. (Or place in the bowl on a heavy duty electric mixer and knead with a dough hook until the dough cleans the sides of the bowl, approximately 5 minutes). Place the dough in a very large buttered bowl, turn to butter the top and allow to rise, covered loosely with a kitchen towel, in a warm place until doubled in bulk, approximately 1 hour. Punch the dough down and roll out to a large rectangle, 24\" x 36\". Butter two 9\" x 13\" baking dishes.",
      "For the filling- beat together the brown sugar, butter and cinnamon until well combined. Spread evenly over the surface of the dough. Roll up lengthwise and cut at 2\" intervals to make 12 rolls. Place 6 rolls in each buttered dish. Cover loosely with a kitchen towel and allow to rise until doubled in bulk, about an hour.",

      "For the frosting- beat the cream cheese, cream and vanilla until well combined. Add the confectioners sugar and beat until smooth and soft, not stiff. Frost the rolls and serve immediately.",
      "To make using Splenda - For the dough, still use 1 teaspoon of real sugar in the yeast as it feeds it. Use 3/4 cup Splenda in place of the sugar that you add to the butter/milk mixture after melting the butter. Do not use the little packages of Splenda, use the pourable kind. For the filling - Use only 3/4 cup of butter and add 2 1/2 cups of the Brown Sugar Blend Splenda. You will not have quite as much filling as with regular sugar but trust me it is plenty. A little of this goes a long, long way. I don't put any frosting on the rolls when making them with Splenda products as they are rich enough as is."
