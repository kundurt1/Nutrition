You cannot un-do mint once added so be very, very careful to not over-do it and end up with a bottle of Listerine-tasting food. There are different kinds of mint extracts available and are labeled as \"mint, \"peppermint\", \"spearmint\" and more. For this recipe I used store-brand (Kroger/Ralph's) \"peppermint extract\" sold in a small 1 ounce bottle. Select the version of \"mint\" you think sounds best as not all types are available in all areas.",

After all crackers have been dipped, place baking sheet in refrigerator."

Add the dates and water to the mixture; pulse until nearly smooth (specks of dates should remain visible)3.Pour the mixture into the baking dish and bake for about 30 minutes, until just firm to the touch. (When the pudding has finished baking, remove from the oven and heat the broiler. Put the rack about 4 inches from the heat source.)4.Meanwhile, make the topping. Melt 5 tablespoons butter in a small saucepan over medium heat, then slowly add 1 cup cream and 3/8 cup dark brown sugar, whisking continuously until the mixture bubbles gently and comes together to form a smooth mixture; turn off heat5.In another small saucepan over medium heat, make the extra sauce. Melt 3 tablespoons butter, then slowly add 11/4 cups cream and 3 tablespoons dark brown sugar. Repeat the process above.6.Pour the topping (careful not to use the extra sauce) over the cooked pudding and place the whole thing in the broiler until it bubbles and looks sticky, 3 to 4 minutes. To serve, spoon into bowls and cover with the extra sauce. If you like, add a dollop of whipped cream.",

Pulse to combine mixture, about five 1-second pulses. Add butter and half of nuts; process until mixture clumps together into large, crumbly balls, about 30 seconds, pausing halfway through to scrape down sides of workbowl. Sprinkle remaining nuts over mixture and combine with two quick pulses. Transfer mixture to parchment-lined baking sheet and spread into even layer (mixture should break up into roughly 1/2-inch chunks with some smaller, loose bits). Bake on middle rack until chunks are lightly browned and firm, 18 to 22 minutes.",

Sprinkle remaining tablespoon sugar over top and place on lower oven rack. Increase oven temperature to 375 degrees and bake until well browned and fruit is bubbling around edges, 25 to 35 minutes. Cool on wire rack until warm, at least 15 minutes; serve."

Cover them with a second sheet of paper or wrap and, with a flat (not textured) wooden mallet, lightly beat them until flattened to a uniform thinness of less than 1/4 inch. Set aside.",

      "Three: Lay the chicken pieces on a flat work surface skinned side down. Lightly spread the inside of each breast with a little mustard (don't use too much or the mustard will overpower the other flavors). Stack 2 slices of cheese and a slice of ham (2 if they are very thin) in the center of each breast. Fold over the small side of the breast, then fold each end up, like an envelope, and finally fold over the large side. Make sure that the filling is completely encased. Roll the chicken first in the flour, shake off the excess, and dip each breast in the egg, allowing the excess to flow back into the bowl. Lay it in the crumbs. Roll it carefully so that it doesn't open up (crumbs should not get inside the folds or they won't stay closed when it cooks), patting the crumbs into all sides. When the piece is coated, lay it on a clean, dry plate and repeat until all the pieces are breaded. Set aside for at least half an hour to allow the breading to set. (You may make them several hours or even a day ahead up to this point. Cover and refrigerate, but take them out at least half an hour before cooking.)",

In a large wide pot, on high heat, heat oil, and sear the ribs, until brown on all sides, 4 to 5 minutes per side.

Let them caramelize by leaving them to sit without tossing, for a few minutes, then toss to turn them, and let sit a bit longer. Return the ribs to the pot, and place them over the vegetables. In a large bowl, combine the Worcestershire sauce, ketchup, cider vinegar, soy, and maple syrup. Add the chipotle peppers with their adobo sauce, to taste. Stir. Add the liquids to the cooking pot. Add the wine, and add enough water, if needed, to ensure that the ribs are just barely covered. Bring the mixture to a boil. Cover the pan with foil, and place in the oven until the ribs are barely fork tender - but not so tender they are falling off the bone, about 1 1/2 hours.",

      "Bread - Preheat oven to 350F. Spray two 8-by-4-inch loaf pans with floured cooking spray; set aside. Bread may be baked in one 9-by-5-inch pan at your own risk; or bake as muffins, mini loaves, or in a Bundt pan, adjusting baking times accordingly.",
      "In a heavy-bottomed large pot or skillet, melt 1/2 cup butter over medium-low heat, stirring nearly continuously or swirling the pan. Butter will melt, foam, turn clear, golden, turn brown, and will then smell nutty. As soon at the butter begins to turn brown, take the pan off the heat, and continue to stir for about 1 minute, to ensure carryover heat doesn't continue to cook and subsequently burn the already browned butter. Pour butter in large mixing bowl.",
      "To the butter, add the eggs, buttermilk, sugars, vanilla, cinnamon, and whisk to combine.",
      "Add the bananas and stir to incorporate. Increasing mashed bananas to 1 1/2 cups and also increasing flour to 2 cups is optional if you prefer more intensely banana-flavored banana bread.",
      "Add the flour, baking power, baking soda, optional salt (buttermilk is already salted, and if using salted butter, and then adding salt, bread could become too salty so use caution here), and stir until just combined, taking care not to over-mix or bread will be tougher as the gluten will over-develop.",
      "Turn batter out into prepared pans, smooth tops lightly with a spatula, and bake for 35 to 42 minutes (I baked 37 mins for 1 loaf, 40 mins for the other), or until top is golden and set, and a wooden skewer, cake tester, or knife inserted in the center comes out mostly clean (banana bread is gooey and it won't come out perfectly clean). If bread is browning too fast on the top, you may wish to lower your oven temperature to 325F in the second half of cooking or tent the pan with foil although I don't suspect this will be an issue.",
      "Allow bread to cool in pan for at least 10 minutes before removing and transferring to a rack to finish cooling."
