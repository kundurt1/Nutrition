This cool-climate wine also offers plenty of citrus and melon, along with bright acidity. -Jeffery Lindenmuth"

      "Add Heat to Taste: You can control the heat of a salsa by adjusting the heat of the chiles. Slice off the top of each chile, being sure to cut through the ribs and seeds, where the heat-producing compound capsaicin is concentrated. Test the chile's fire by touching the top to your tongue (each chile has a different heat level). Adjust the heat, if you want a milder salsa, by splitting the chile and scraping out some or all of the ribs and seeds. If your skin is sensitive, wear kitchen gloves or hold chiles with a fork-and don't touch your eyes.",

Spoon 1/3 cup of fruit mixture onto the breadcrumb mixture about 2 inches from one short end, spreading fruit mixture to form a 4 x 2-inch rectangle. Fold one long side on phyllo over filling, and repeat with other long side, overlapping phyllo. Starting at short edge with filling, roll up phyllo jelly-roll fashion. (Do not roll tightly, or the strudel may split.) Place strudel, seam side down, on a baking sheet coated with cooking spray. Lightly coat strudel with cooking spray. Repeat procedure with the remaining phyllo, margarine mixture, breadcrumb mixture, and fruit mixture. Bake at 350\u00b0 for 30 minutes or until strudel is golden brown. Serve warm or at room temperature."

Before you make the cookies, drain the figs of the liquid, except for a few tablespoons. Put the figs and remaining liquid in a food processor and blend to make a thick paste, somewhat like a tapenade consistency.",
      "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.",
      "Mix all of the dry ingredients in a medium-size bowl. Set aside.",
      "Put the softened butter into a mixer (if you don't have a stand mixer, you really should splurge on one. It makes all the difference in the world). Add the brown sugar and organic cane sugar to the butter and cream together. Cream only until well blended, then turn off the mixer.",
      "Add the egg, vanilla, and molasses. Mix until just blended. Add the dry ingredients and mix until thoroughly blended.",
      "Refrigerate the dough in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour. This is key with gluten-free doughs.",
      "After you have chilled the dough, roll out half the dough to a 1-inch thickness. (Be sure to flour the board with gluten-free flour and be patient. Gluten-free dough can be hard to roll.) Lay this dough onto a baking sheet that is covered with parchment paper or a Silpat. Slather the fig spread over the surface of the dough, stopping about one inch from the edges. Roll out the rest of the dough and lay it over the fig spread. Crimp the edges to seal in the fig spread.",
      "Slide the baking sheet into the oven for 15 minutes, checking occasionally to make sure the cookies aren't browning too much. Take the cookies out of the oven when they are firm to the touch and just starting to brown. Let them cool on a wire rack for 10 minutes.",
      "When the cookies have cooled slightly, cut the edges off to make even lines. (Don't throw them away! These are delicious, too.) Slice the giant cookie into small squares, and they will look like those fig cookies of your youth."
