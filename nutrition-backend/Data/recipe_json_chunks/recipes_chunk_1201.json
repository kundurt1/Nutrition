Do not overmix ingredients and when in doubt with your measurements, err on the side of too much moisture rather than too little-working with a dry pie crust is never fun. For a golden crust, baste with egg yolk just before baking.",

In a small bowl, mix 1 cup sugar and 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon and pour over apple slices. Mix in green food coloring and cover until ready to pour into pie crust.",

I attached the eyes using this method and then painted on a pupil using edible powder paints. The eyes are simple sugar beads sold at any Michaels or cake supply. I adhered them with the tiniest bit of heated caramel. Once completed, place about the top of your pie and even insert a few halfway into the crust."

      "Kneading for gluten. By hand, or course - and I find that using a work surface instead of a bowl works better for me. At first it may be difficult to figure out what the dough should feel like, so use your watch - this should take 7 to 8 minutes. At this time it's also important to observe the dough to make sure you're not putting too much (or too little) flour in it - it's quite normal that you need more or less than in the recipe. Dough is good to go when you can spread little out between your hands and it streches to a very thin skin without breaking (also called \"window test\"). The dough should be a little sticky at all times, as well as smooth and elastic.",
      "Leave the dough to rise. Put in into an oiled bowl and cover with a cloth - if you put it into a warm place it will rise more quickly, but you can put it into the fridge too (only it will take days then). This can actually be quite useful too - you can put your dough into the fridge, then go out and take it only out when you're ready to bake it. The dough has risen enough when it's doubled in size.",

      "Second rising. Again, leave for about half an hour in a warm place - this is also one of those things you need to practice with. Remember that bread doesn't rise in the oven anymore like cakes that use baking powder - so you need to let them rise enough to get nice and puffy bread.",
      "Bake in 225 C for 10 - 15 minutes as a guideline but as always nothing beats experience. Generally bread is cooked when you tap the bottom of it with your finger and it sounds hollow - this can be difficult to judge in the beginning though, so use the recipe's guidelines and learn to judge what a good bread sounds like.",

Add lemon juice by tablespoons until frosting is runny enough to pour over bars ( not thick like icing, but more like runny pancake batter).

      "Line pan w/ aluminum foil or parchment paper before pressing flour mixture into it. Make sure foil goes up the entire side of pan and overlaps the sides. This makes it easier to get the bars out when completely done. Let cool and place on cutting board to cut instead of leaving them in pan to cut. (Neater edges too!).",
      "Also, I personally like my bars extra chewy and crunchy. I achieve this by baking them quite a while longer the second time they are put into the oven. Usually around 45 minutes or longer. If I do it this way then I will bake them at a lower temp, say 300-325 so they don't brown so quick.",
      "Try replacing the white sugar w/ 1/2 brown and 1/2 white sugar and add 1 teaspoon of vanilla. They taste richer and chewier as well!"

      "TIPS: If humidity is high, reduce the amount of water in the recipe to avoid over rising. Many gluten-free bakers experience the frustrating situation in which a beautiful loaf of bread deflates once removed from the oven. You will need to experiment a little to get just the right amount of water in your bread depending on the humidity in the air. If in question, use less water than the recipe calls for."

      "My Note: This is an easy tip and makes a big difference in taste - in a medium pan over low heat, heat up the canned pumpkin puree, spices, and salt. Heating the pumpkin puree up takes out the \"canned\" taste of the pumpkin and melds the spices together nicely. Then, pour the mixture out into another bowl, and let it cool a bit before adding the condensed milk and eggs. This little change makes the pumpkin taste much fresher! My family loves this recipe, and I use a ready-made graham cracker crust.",

My wife loved it but she thought it needed more cinnamon. So I made the next one with 2 teaspoons of cinnamon and she loved it. If you like a lot of cinnamon, that's the way to go. For me, I preferred 1 teaspoon, but I'd eat it either way. Thanks EAGLE BRAND, I do make two pies."

Cook, stirring, until the butter melts and the mixture just comes to a full boil; immediately start timing and cook for exactly 1 minute, stirring occasionally. Remove from the heat; let cool slightly.",
      "In a large bowl, using a stand mixer or electric hand mixer on low speed, combine the flour, cinnamon, ginger, cloves, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Working carefully to avoid splashes, add the butter-molasses mixture. Beat on low speed until the ingredients are blended. Increase the speed to medium, until very well blended; if the mixer motor labors, stop and complete the mixing by hand. (The dough will seem too soft at this point.) Cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes or until the dough has stiffened and is barely warm.",
      "Divide the dough into thirds. Roll out the portions a generous 1/4 -inch thick between sheets of baking parchment or waxed paper. Stack the rolled portions (paper still attached) on a tray or baking sheet. Refrigerate for at least 30 to 40 minutes, or freeze for 20 to 25 minutes or until cold and firm. (The dough may be refrigerated for up to 12 hours, if preferred.).",

(That will make it easier to lift cookies from the paper later.) Flip the dough over, then peel off and discard the second sheet. Using a 4- to 5-inch gingerbread girl or boy cutter, cut out the cookies. Using a spatula, transfer cookies to baking sheets, spacing about 2 inches apart. (If at any point the dough softens too much to handle easily, transfer the paper and cookies to a tray or baking sheet, and chill until firm again.) Gather up and reroll the dough scraps between sheets of paper. Continue cutting out cookies until all the dough is used. Very firmly press raisins into the cookies for eyes and front buttons.",
      "Bake for 9 to 14 minutes, until the cookies are slightly colored on top and slightly darker at the edges; it's better to overbake than underbake. Set aside to firm up about 4 minutes; then, using a wide spatula, transfer to wire racks set over a sheet of waxed paper. Have all the cookies lined up and slightly separated before beginning the glaze.",
      "For the glaze: In a medium saucepan, combine the confectioners' sugar, oil and water until well blended. Bring to a boil, stirring, over medium-high heat, for 30 to 45 seconds or just until the mixture is smooth and becomes translucent. Stir to recombine the glaze, then use immediately while it is still hot. (If the glaze is allowed to stand and cool, it may thicken and become sugary. In that case, add a teaspoon of hot water to thin it again, place over medium heat and continue stirring until the sugar dissolves. Immediately remove from the heat and use.).",
      "Using a pastry brush or a paper towel dipped in the glaze, brush the cookies until their tops are coated all over with an even layer, not too thick or too thin. Stir the glaze frequently to prevent it from separating. Let the glazed cookies cool completely, at least 1 hour; the glaze may become slightly sugary and flaky."
