      "There are many things important, but you can better find it out yourself.",
      "Notice that ingredients that have to be browned (like mushrooms) should be put on the cake at the end, else it wont touch the pan when turned over.",
      "Ingredients like apple and onions also should be put on the cake somewhere at the end of the order, instead of the beginning, because else these ingredients wont be baked good enough, and they will stay hard and tough.",

      "You should have baked the pancake as I described above, and it should already by flipped over (the top is already browned, but the bottom is still raw!).",
      "The heat is still off.",
      "First you put on the cheese, spread it carefully.",
      "Then, put on the ham.",
      "Next, put on the onion, and finally put about 3 pieces of bacon on top.",
      "Now, and this is very important, get the spoon of the liquid dough and spread some dough over the ingredients (not an entire spoonful, just use what comes of the spoon when you take it out of the bowl, and spread it in stripes over the ingredients).",
      "This way the ingredients wont fall off that easily.",
      "Now you should turn up the heat.",

      "Notes/updates: In the interest of TK happiness, I have researched alternate methods (in frantic desperation) and added some tips for the laziest and latest of cooking chicken.",
      "These techniques work well with very frozen chicken!",
      "First method: It is possible to crank up the oven to 375 F to 380 F if the chicken can be fully encased by an upside down 13 X 9 clear glass oven-safe cake pan, so as to retain as many of the juices and to prevent overheating while steaming the chicken, thereby skipping defrost of chicken.",
      "If a crispy skin is desired, uncover it in the last few minutes and broil on high for just a couple of minutes, to prevent drying out the chicken.",
      "Second method: If using the suggested (manufacturer provided) 2 piece broiler pan, pour a cup or so of tap water in the bottom of the pan, cover with the top of the broiler rack, and load and cook the chicken as in the original recipe.",
      "The only difference for this method is that you should set oven to 375 F. The steaming action is great, but take care when removing pans from the oven to avoid hot water burns.",
      "Ahem.",
      "Third method: If chicken pieces are too large, or too many pieces are crowded on the pan, this may cause the chicken to take longer than an hour to cook.",
      "This can happen if trying to make Lazy Chicken into 2 Night Lazy Chicken.",
      "Ahem.",
      "This makes more work for you, but if you watch the temperature, and when chicken has internal temperature of around 150 F crank the oven to Broil/High, move to a lower rack in the oven and broil for a few minutes until skin is browned to your liking.",
      "Tips: No matter the method, an hour is typically what it takes for safety, at least with bone-in chicken.",
      "I always use a meat thermometer, but if it getting close to done, take the chicken out to rest to prevent drying.",
      "Often it will reach the right temperature in a few minutes, or if not a quick High/Broil will finish the job.",
      "Always verify with your thermometer!",
      "Bone-in (and cheaper) pieces often are the tastiest using this method.",
      "Also, smaller pieces, like drumsticks, cook especially fast in a pinch.",
      "If small pieces are mixed with other larger cuts, put them in the center of the pan if possible, and bigger bulges of meat towards the outside.",
      "The important thing is that you didnt have to think too much to make it happen, and picky people have their mouths filled with food and cannot complain much.",
      "Yeah, You!",
      "Now go take a nap, since I did the work for you so you wouldnt have to!",
      "Note regarding the spices: Rosemary, thyme, oregano, parsley, paprika or favorite spice blends or flavored salts, like garlic salt (very popular) work well.",
