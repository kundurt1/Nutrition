      "Notes:I'm using Canadian AP (Robin Hood, Bakery Standard) so check your dough and adjust accordingly.",
      "The dough should be soft and slightly sticky.",
      "I used extra virgin olive oil, regular light, the kind with practically no taste.",
      "Canola should do fine.",
      "Lecithin and Lemon Juice, not in the original recipe, are there because I add in them to all my baking.",
      "I get a lighter product, higher rise, and better keeping qualities, and my finished product freezes well.",
      "I have seen people when following this type recipe, add in the egg to the liquid and beat, then add in the slurry to the container.",
      "I have done this as well and can tell you which for whatever reason, the end product does not measure up.",
      "Add in your liquids, break the egg into the container, and let the ABM do the blending, you will get a lighter better result.",
      "Where I call for 'oleo', butter can of course be substituted.",
      "Also while this recipe is 'halved' from the original, I found it made more caramel then I needed.",
      "I was going to cut it still further, but enjoyed the leftovers on my ice cream so much (and still have some left in a jar) which I left it as is.",
      "Another thing, I used a flat (1/2 inch or possibly so rims) pan for this recipe and because I tipped it slightly when placing it into the oven, I have a well caramelised oven floor.",
      "I'd advise pans with an inch, inch and a half rim instead, and so I will do, next time.",
      "Also, the original recipe called for the caramel to be made 'stovetop' and so you can make it.",
      "I use the microwave because it cuts the constant stirring, danger of burning, It's just faster and easier.",
      "As to the filling, I confess I never measure when making them.",
      "Just do as you do or possibly refer to the original if you need guidance.",
      "The original called for Currents by the way, I prefer the succulence of raisins, currents I save for scones.",
      "Now what you've been waiting for ...",
      "These buns are delicious ... positively great!",
      "In spite of all the stuff I've written (just trying to be clear), they are fast and simple to make.",
      "They are what we up here would call a 'Chelsea Bun' although to some a CB would contain candied fruit, that you could certainly add in by the way.",
      "Dough:Place in container in the order best for your ABM Run on Dough setting.",
      "Allow to rise till well doubled (about 3/4 hr) .",
      "Caramel:Place in container and microwave med high (70%) till oleo is melted, stirring occasionally.",
      "Spray (Pam) baking pans and pour in caramel, tipping to spread proportionately over surface.",
      "Filling:Roll dough out on lightly floured surface making a rectangle approx 15\" wide by 11\" tall.",
      "Spread oleo or possibly brush with melted butter, leaving a 1 inch border at top.",
      "Sprinkle with cinnamon, brown sugar, raisins, and pecans.",
      "Roll up from the bottom, pinching the dough to seal well.",
      "Cut into 12 pcs a little over an inch wide and place in the pan fairly close together.",
      "Cover loosely and allow to rise in a hot oven for about 45 min to one hour.",
      "Bake at 350* or possibly till they are golden, about 30 min.",
