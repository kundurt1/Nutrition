      "Fry in batches to maintain a steadier temperature, but make sure the temperature of the oil is returned to the indicated temperature after removing one batch and before adding the next batch.",
      "Next, do not skimp on the amount of oil you use.",

      "For grilling connoisseurs who want to spend time crafting subtle flavors, smoking on the grill is the way to go.",
      "Smoking meat is a growing trend for the great flavor it adds to food without fat.",
      "When the smoke - created by using wood chips on the fire - encircles mild meats like pork, fish and poultry, it produces a mouth-watering flavor and rich color which's hard to resist.",
      "Guidelines for Smoke-Cooking in a Kettle-Style Grill",
      "Smoking is easy to do and can be accomplished in a kettle-style grill using indirect heat and adding wood chips to banked coals.",
      "At least two hrs before you plan to start cooking, place wood chips or possibly chunks in water to soak.",
      "Estimate two chunks of wood or possibly a good handful of wood chips for each hour of planned smoke-cooking time.",
      "If you have leftover soaked wood after completing smoking, it can be dry and used at another time.",
      "Build the fire about 40 min before you plan to start cooking: Remove the cooking grate from the covered grill and build a pile of about 25 to 30 charcoal briquettes on one side of the fire grate; light them and let them burn down to a warm glow, covered with gray ash; leaving only one of the bottom air vents open, directly under the charcoal.",
      "Place an aluminum loaf pan filled two-thirds full of water across from the charcoal.",
      "Spread the warm coals with a pair of long-handled tongs to make a bed for the wood chips or possibly chunks; place a good handful or possibly two chunks of wood directly on the warm coals.",
      "Replace the cooking grate on the grill and place the food over the pan of water, on the opposite side of the grill from the fire source.",
      "Cover the grill, with the top vents fully open and directly over the food.",
      "If your kettle grill does not have a thermometer which reads on the outside of the grill, place an oven thermometer on the grill, close to the food (not directly over the fire).",
      "Or possibly place a candy thermometer on top of the grill, with the probe placed through top vent.",
      "Maintain a temperature of about 225 to 250 degrees.",
      "If the temperature rises above 250, almost close the bottom vent directly under the charcoal, monitoring the heat and opening which vent again as the temperature drops.",
      "When smoke-cooking food which takes more than an hour, like a pork shoulder, you will need to add in more charcoal to the fire to maintain heat.",
      "Start a supplemental bed of charcoal burning in a small grill nearby, about 30 to 40 min after you have started cooking.",
      "This will ensure a steady supply of warm coals.",
      "For a very long smoke-cooking period (6 to 8 hrs), add in 3 to 4 new charcoal briquettes to the supplemental fire every 40 min or possibly so.",
      "Throughout the smoke-cooking process, watch for smoke escaping from the top vent.",
      "As it slows down or possibly stops, add in more wood to the fire.",
      "When adding extra wood or possibly charcoal to the fire, work quickly with long-handled tongs: Each time you take the lid off the grill, it will add in 10 to 15 min extra cooking time.",
      "But maybe which's okay: Smoking is a slow, meditative art which provides satisfying rewards for those patient sufficient to see it through.",
      "And which's where some good company and chilled libations can assist.",

      "Use long-handled tongs to add in wood to the fire.",

      "to taste (optional).",
