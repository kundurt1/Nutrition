Set your meat aside. \n\nCut all your vegetables and let your pan heat up to medium and with oil start to add your vegetables - carrots, chilli, coriander, grated ginger and stir well for about a minute.\nSeason with your sea salt, black and white pepper. \nNow add - red onion, white onion, yellow paprika and stir well for about an additional minute and a half. \nNow add the rest - mushrooms, tomato and grated garlic and stir well for an additional minute and a half . Set all vegetables aside.",
      "In the empty pan add your oil and on medium heat fry your curry spice for few seconds and then add your couscous. Pan fry it for about a minute but do not let it get brown or black! And start to add your water little by little. Always wait for the couscous to absorb the water before you add some more. Stir well. Add little by little until your couscous is nice, moist and soft. Taste it so it is for your own preferences. \n\nNow is the time to combine all your ingredients together. Mix in your meat and vegetables. Stir well. Taste. Add extra seasoning if necessary. \n\nPlate and add extra scallions to decorate and for taste. \n\nEnjoy.",
      "TIP: this meal is perfect to even prepare a day ahead. You can even serve it cold and of course you do not have to use leftover meat but you can use fresh chicken breast or tights. \nIt is a wonderful meal for parties and barbecues. \n\nAlso you can create a version with no meat fro your vegetarian friends and you can add some Portobello mushroom to replace the meat."
