      "Repeat 20 to 30 times occasionally folding widthwise to fit between the guides.",
      "This kneads and smoothes the dough further, creating silky and supple pasta.",
      "Now you can roll the pasta into thin sheets by feeding it through each successive setting of the pasta machine until you have passed it through the second thinnest opening (dust with just enough flour as necessary to keep the dough from sticking).",

      "If the sheet of pasta becomes cumbersomely long cut it crosswise into 2 pieces to make it more manageable.",
      "Repeat with the second half of the dough.",

      "Yield: about 1 pound of pasta",
      "Try to make lasagna noodles as wide as your pasta machine allows (4 to 5-inches); cut the lengths the most appropriate size for the pan you plan to use--anywhere from 8 to 12-inches long (longer if you like, or shorter if smaller noodles are easier for you to handle.",
      "Lasagna noodles can be cut and patched together in assembly).",

      "After you have cut the noodles, you can cook them right away or lay them out in a single layer without touching on a lightly floured surface or on clean, dry kitchen towels until ready to cook (flour dusted or towel lined baking trays work well if you don't have counter) If you are not using the pasta the same day, allow it to dry completely, then transfer to long, shallow containers with lids.",
      "You can keep it in a cool, dry place for 1 week."

      "Ive found that I can get beautiful results whether I mix the dough by hand, with a steel blade, in the food processor, or in the bread machine.",
      "The trick is to create a dough that is moist enough to form big bubbles inside so that the baked loaf has an open texture.",
      "Moistness also contributes to a crunchy, chewy crust.",
      "The second important thing is to produce steam in the oven.",
      "I do this by preheating a pan of 1-inch rocks on the bottom shelf of the oven.",
      "I use a 12 1/2 x 17 1/2-inch rimmed pan filled with river rocks or landscape rocks.",
      "To create the steam, I squirt about a cupful of water onto the hot rocks, creating a burst of steam after I place the loaves in the oven.",
      "Third, hot air in the convection oven circulates the heat and steam around the baking loaves to create a crunchy crust.",
      "Rustic loaves require stabilized high heat.",
      "This can be accomplished by preheating tiles in the oven (on a rack in the center) to mimic a brick oven.",
      "The tiles help to maintain a high heat.",
      "Plain unglazed tiles from a flooring supply store work well.",
      "You can also place a baking stone into the oven if you have one.",
      "A kit called the Hearthstone kit works beautifully but is expensive.",
      "Because it is sometimes difficult and messy to transfer loaves directly onto preheated tiles or stones, I simply place the shaped loaves on a dark, noninsulated, rimless cookie sheet to rise and then set the cookie sheet right on the preheated tiles to bake.",
      "If you do not have the pan of rocks or tiles, at least be sure to use a dark, noninsulated, rimless cookie sheet for baking the bread and spray the oven and risen loaves with plain water before and during baking.",
      "This does not produce as nice a crust as outlined in step 4 but is a good compromise."
