      "Cover eggs with water in a small saucepan and set on high heat. When the water comes to a rolling boil, turn off the heat and let the eggs set in the water until they are cool enough for you to handle them. Bring a large pot of water to a boil and add salt to taste. Cut off the bottom 1 to 1 1/2-inches of the asparagus. Peel the asparagus, starting very lightly at the tip and gradually increasing pressure towards the base. Boil the asparagus just until tender enough that a knife slides in easily, 4 to 5 minutes. Remove from hot water to a pan of cold water to stop the cooking. When almost ready to serve, shell the hard-cooked eggs and separate the whites from the yolks. Chop separately as fine as possible and them combine them in a mixing bowl (chopped them together smears the yolks). Add the parsley, mixed herbs, lemon juice and vinegar and stir together. Stir in the olive oil. Add 1/4 teaspoon salt, then taste and add more if necessary. Pat the asparagus dry and arrange it on a platter. Spoon the dressing on top in a swatch pattern across the middle of the spears. Serve at room temperature. Serves 6 to 8."
