Drop slightly rounded teaspoon full of thick batter for each cookie on a greased cookie sheet. Spread the dough very thin using the back of the spoon, make rounds about 3 inches in diameter. Bake for 5 minutes or until edges turn light brown. Place on wire rack. Working quickly place a fortune in each cookie, fold opposite sides together, crease crosswise at the center of the straight edge to form a flattened side, then bend backward to form the traditional shape. Cool in muffin tins to hold shape. Yields 4 dozen."
