      "The goal is to get the onions to caramelize, but at the same time get a certain crisp to them.",

      "Reserve the skillet for making the chicken mixture.",
      "Strain the rice in a colander and set aside for a moment.",

      "Once the rice has boiled for about 6 minutes, strain it again, and lay into a large baking dish, spreading out, and fanning if possible, to quickly cool.",

      "Heat the combined over the hot water in the meantime.",
      "Keep beating for a total of 10 minutes at high speed, until the batter forms ribbons when lifted.",
      "Mix at low speed to even out the texture.",

      "Hit the pan lightly on the countertop, and draw lines through the batter up, down, left and right to eliminate air pockets.",

      "Lower the heat again to 285F/140C for 45 minutes.",
      "If you cool the cake out in the open, it will have a light texture like the type of castella sold at an old fashioned sweet shop.",
