      "With a pastry blender or two knives (using two knives is actually easier) cut the flour and the 3 sticks of butter together until combined but do not let the butter become warm. The butter should never be allowed to become warm the entire to time you are working with this dough.",
      "Tear off a sheet of waxed paper and dump the butter on to it. Place another sheet of waxed paper on top.",
      "Beat the the butter between the two sheets of waxed paper with a rolling pin until it becomes malleable. Make sure it stays cold though.",
      "With a spatula, a knife or whatever, shape the mound of butter into an 7\"x9\" rectangle. It doesn't have to be perfect but try to get it into a rectangular shape as best you can.",
      "Set aside in a cool spot or place back in the refrigerator while you make the dough, but don't let the butter re-harden. You want the butter to be cold but still soft and pliable. If it's too hard it will break through the dough when you roll it out.",
      "For the dough combine the packages of yeast with the warm milk and let sit 5 minutes to soften.",
      "Mix in the salt, sugar, and eggs.",
      "Add the 3 1/4 cups flour all at once and stir until thoroughly combined. You should have a very soft and sticky dough.",
      "Chill dough in the refrigerator for about 10 minutes.",
      "If the block of butter is in the refrigerator remove it when you place the dough in there to chill. You don't want the butter to re-harden and it's best if the dough and the butter are approximately the same temperature.",
      "Sprinkle your work surface generously, and I do mean generously, with flour. I use a shaker to evenly distribute the flour and completely cover the area I'm going to be rolling the dough out on. A simple dusting won't do. You need a good thick layer of flour, maybe as much as a 1/16 to an 1/8 of an inch thick. Don't worry about using too much flour because any excess will be brushed away with your pastry brush.",
      "Roll dough out into a 11\"x16\" rectangle.",
      "With a pastry brush brush all the excess flour off the top of the dough. Excess flour will interfere with layer formation.",
      "Place the block of butter on one side of the dough leaving a small border around the edges.",
      "Fold the other half of the dough over and pinch the seams together slightly to seal to encase the block of butter. If dough sticks to the table when you try to fold it then simply brush it with flour. Don't worry if the dough doesn't look too pretty at this point. It will get better.",
      "Turn the dough 1/4 turn so the part of the folded dough that opens up is on your right(like a book). Brush away the excess flour that's on top of the dough.",
      "Roll the folded dough into an 8\"x20\" rectangle. When you roll out the dough you want to make sure you use even strokes and roll from one end to the other. Avoid quick back and forth movements with the rolling pin and do not roll over the edge of your dough. This will destroy the layers you're trying to make. If the butter breaks through the dough simply sprinkle a little bit of flour over the spot.",
      "Brush away all excess flour off the top of the dough.",
      "Fold 1/3 of the dough over and brush off the excess flour and then fold the other 1/3 of the dough over that so the dough resembles a business letter.",
      "Roll out the dough again and fold it in thirds like a business letter just like you did before.",
      "Wrap dough in plastic wrap and chill in the refrigerator for 1 hour. This completes the first two \"turns\". Each time you roll out the dough and fold it you are doing what's known as a turn. A turn gets its name because after you fold the dough you have to turn it a quarter turn when you go to roll it out again. Each time you roll out the dough you want to make sure that the part of the dough that opens up is always on the right (like the way a book opens). It can open on the left if you want but the important thing is to be consistent.",
      "Meanwhile, take your pastry brush and a sheet of paper and sweep up all the flour on your work surface so you can use it again. You'll find that very little of the flour you used to roll out the dough actually gets worked into the dough.",
      "After the dough has chilled, sprinkle your work surface with your recycled flour and place the dough on it.",
      "Roll out and fold the dough in thirds exactly as you did before. (turn #3).",
      "Chill dough for 1 more hour.",
      "Repeat this rolling and folding one more time (turn # 4). You should now have a dough with 162 flaky layers (2x3x3x3x3). You started with two layers of dough separated by a layer of butter. Each time you rolled the dough out and folded it in thirds you increased the number of layers by a factor of 3.",
      "Chill dough for at least 3 hours or overnight if preferred. At this point you have a basic Danish pastry dough.",
      "With a sharp serrated knife, cut the dough in half.",
      "Keep one half in the refrigerator while you work with the first half.",
      "Roll the half of dough into a 9\"x16\" rectangle.",
      "Sprinkle the top of the dough with the cinnamon topping which consists of 2 tablespoons of melted butter, 1/2 cup brown sugar, 2 teaspoons cinnamon, 2 tablespoons flour, and 1/2 cup finely chopped pecans.",
      "Roll dough into a tight 16\" long log.",
      "Cut dough into 16 pieces. The easiest way to do this is to cut the log in half and then cut those halves in half and so forth. If dough is too soft to slice wrap it up and refrigerate it for an hour or place it in the freezer for 10 to 15 minutes.",
      "Place cinnamon rolls on ungreased baking sheets at least 3 inches apart so they have room to rise and expand.",
      "Repeat with the other half of the dough.",
      "Cover the trays of cinnamon rolls with towels and set aside to rise until the rolls are ALMOST doubled (about a 75% increase in size). Don't put them in a warm spot because you don't want the butter to melt. Rising time may take a few hours or more. After a couple hours the surface of the rolls may start to dry out, especially if the air is dry. If this happens, cover the tray of rolls with a damp paper towel and then put another towel on top of that.",
      "Brush rolls lightly with egg wash and bake in a preheated 400\u00b0F oven for 12 to 15 minutes or until they are golden brown. Be sure to watch them carefully so they don't burn. If rolls are browning too fast on top lower the oven temperature about 15 degrees. If you have thin or dark colored baking sheets you may want to double-pan them so the bottoms of the cinnamon rolls don't get too dark.",
      "Drizzle powdered sugar icing over the rolls while they are still warm.",
      "To make icing simply combine powdered sugar with a teaspoon or two of vanilla and enough milk so you can drizzle it. I usually use about 3/4 to 1 pound of powdered sugar. As far as the amount of milk goes, I just kind of eyeball it."

      "DUCK STOCK: Quarter the onion, cut the celery stalks in half and place into a medium stock pot with the three ducks. Cover the ducks and vegetables with two quarts of water, add salt and bring to a low boil for approximately 90 minutes. After cooking, remove the ducks from the stock and put aside to cool. Strain the broth and set aside, this will be the stock for the gumbo. Discard the onion and celery; it was only there for flavor. After the ducks have cooled, pick all meat from the bones and set aside to be added to the gumbo later.",
      "ROUX and TRINITY: Start the roux by pouring the oil in the bottom of the stock pot or Dutch oven you plan to make your gumbo in and set to medium heat. When the oil is hot enough that a pinch of flour causes it to sizzle like it is frying begin adding the flour to the oil while stirring constantly with a whisk or wooden spoon. The roux requires constant stirring while cooking to prevent it from burning and it may be necessary to reduce the heat during cooking several times to prevent the roux from burning. You will notice the roux slowly beginning to get darker as you stir it with your whisk. The correct shade for a gumbo roux will look like a dark melted chocolate. It could take 30-45 minutes for the roux to reach its desired shade, be sure to keep an eye on the heat during the cooking process so that the roux does not burn. Once the roux has reached its correct shade add the onions, celery and bell peppers (trinity) to the roux, add the garlic and set heat to low. Allow the mixture to simmer for about 10 minutes.",
      "GUMBO: Add the wine, strained duck stock, duck meat and sausage to the pot with the roux/trinity and set heat to medium. Add all seasonings and remaining ingredients to the pot and stir gently until the roux and stock blend together. When the pot begins to boil reduce heat to low and cook over low heat for 2 hours. The gumbo may look thin when all the ingredients are first added to the pot but it will cook down into a very nice consistency over the next two hours.",
      "During the cooking process some oil from the roux and fat from the sausage will float to the top. You can use a big gravy spoon or something similar to skim it off the top. It makes for a better finished product.",
      "Any gumbo is best served over white rice with a big piece of French bread and your favorite beer or wine.",
      "Enjoy!"

      "Add the flour and mix on low speed until well combined. Increase the speed to medium and knead until the dough is smooth and pulls away from the side of the bowl, approximately 4 to 5 minutes. Kneading the dough can also be done by hand.",
      "Remove the dough from the bowl, clean the bowl and then oil it well with vegetable oil. Return the dough to the bowl, cover with plastic wrap and sit in a warm place for approximately 1 hour or until the dough has doubled in size.",
      "Knock the air out for 30 seconds by punching it down. You can now shape the dough into a ball, then place it onto a flour-dusted baking tray lined with parchment paper. Brush the top of the cornbread with egg wash, sprinkle the top with flour and coarse salt. Let it sit in a warm spot for 1 hour.",
      "Preheat the oven at 400 degrees F.",
      "Bake the cornbread for approximately 30 minutes or until the crust is golden brown. You can tell if it's cooked by tapping its bottom. If it sounds hollow it's done, if it doesn't then pop it back in for a little longer.",
      "Once cooked, place the bread on a rack and allow it to cool for about 1 1/2 hours.",
      "For the stuffing:",
      "Cube up the cooled cornbread and set aside. In a large skillet, heat the oil over medium-high heat. Add the Morteau sausage and cook for about 5 minutes, until golden brown. Add the onions, celery, pepper, and garlic and continue cooking until translucent, about 5 minutes.",
      "Deglaze with the veal stock. Add in the cornbread. Transfer to a large bowl. Add the oysters and their liquid, parsley, paprika, and melted butter. Season the stuffing with salt, and pepper, to taste.",
      "Reserve the stuffing in the refrigerator until ready to use.",
      "To assemble the turducken: Spread the deboned turkey, skin-side down on a flat surface, exposing as much meat as possible. Sprinkle the meat generously and evenly with a total of about 3 tablespoons of the smoked paprika, patting the seasoning in with your hands. Be sure to turn the leg, thigh and wing meat to the outside so you can season it too. Season the turkey with salt and pepper. Then stuff some of the stuffing in the leg, thigh and wing cavities until full but not tightly packed. If too tightly packed, it may cause the leg and wing to burst open during cooking).",
      "Spread an even layer of the stuffing over the remaining exposed meat, about 1/2 to 3/4-inches thick. You should use a total of about 4 cups of stuffing.",
      "For the duck:",
      "Remove some of the fat and keep aside. Place the duck, skin-side down, on top of the stuffing, arranging the duck evenly over the stuffing. Season the exposed duck meat generously and evenly with smoked paprika, using about 1 tablespoon, and pressing it in with your hands. Season the duck with salt and pepper.",
      "Then spread about 1 cup of the stuffing evenly over the exposed duck meat, making the layer slightly less thick, about 1/2-inch thick. Repeat with the chicken and the remaining stuffing. Place an Italian truffle in the center, optional.",
      "Enlist someone's help to close turducken. Fold the sides of the turkey together to close the bird. Have your helper hold the turkey closed while you sew up all the openings, making the stitches about 1-inch apart. When you finish sewing up the turducken on the first side, turn it over in the pan to sew closed any openings on the other side. Then tie the legs together, just above the tip bones. Leave the turducken to cook, breast-side up, in the pan, tucking in the turkey wings.",
      "With the assistance of your helper, carefully lift the turducken into an ungreased 15 by 11-inch baking pan that is at least 2 1/2-inches deep. This pan size is ideal because the turducken fits snugly in the pan and stays in the proper shape while cooking.",
      "Place the turducken pan in a slightly larger pan with sides at least 2 1/2-inches deep, so that the larger pan will catch the overflow of drippings during cooking.",
      "Season the exposed side of the turducken with the remaining smoked paprika, patting it in with your hands. Brush with melted butter. Bake the turducken at 325 degrees F, about 4 hours, until done, or until a meat thermometer inserted through to the center reads 165 degrees F.",
      "When done, remove the turducken from the oven and let rest for about 15 minutes.",
      "For the gravy:",
      "Place the turducken drippings in a pot over medium-high heat. Add the stock, fresh thyme, and beurre manie. Season the gravy with salt, and pepper, to taste. Let the gravy come to a boil. Turn down heat to medium-low and let the gravy simmer for 10 minutes.",
      "Remember there are no bones to support the birds' structure. With strong spatulas inserted underneath the bird, carefully transfer the turducken to a serving platter and present it to your guests before carving. Be sure to make your slices crosswise so that each slice contains the stuffing and all 3 meats. Serve additional bowls of the dressings on the side and serve with the gravy.",
      "Cook's Notes:",
      "Stuffing and assembling the turducken can be done 1 day ahead and kept in the refrigerator. Beurre manie is 2 tablespoons butter and 2 tablespoons flour. This is used to help thicken sauces."

While you are bringing it to room temperature, have it resting in a pan, so that if the plastic covering leaks for any reason, the juices will remain in the pan. If you get a frozen turkey, you will need to defrost it in the refrigerator for several days first.",
      "Remove the neck and giblets (heart, gizzard, liver). Use the heart and gizzard for making stock for the stuffing. The neck can be cooked along side the turkey or saved for turkey soup.",
      "Note that if your turkey comes with a plastic piece holding the legs together, check the instructions on the turkey's package. Most likely you do not need to remove those plastic ties for cooking (unless you plan to cook your turkey at a very high temperature). If you remove the plastic ties, you will need to use kitchen string to tie the legs together.",
      "Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.",
      "Wash out the turkey with water. Pat the turkey dry with paper towels. Lather the inside of the cavity with the juice of half a lemon. Take a small handful of salt and rub all over the inside of the turkey.",
      "For flavor, put in inside the turkey a half a yellow onion, peeled and quartered, a bunch of parsley, a couple of carrots, and some tops and bottoms of celery. You may need to cap the body cavity with some aluminum foil so that the stuffing doesn't easily fall out. Close up the turkey cavity with either string or metal skewers. Make sure that the turkey's legs are tied together, held close to the body, and tie a string around the turkey body to hold the wings in close.",
      "Rub either melted butter or olive oil all over the outside of the turkey. Sprinkle salt generously all over the outside of the turkey. Sprinkle pepper over the turkey.",
      "Place turkey BREAST SIDE DOWN on the bottom of a rack over a sturdy roasting pan big enough to catch all the drippings. This is the main difference. Cooking the turkey breast down means the skin over the breast will not get so brown. However, all of the juices from the cooking turkey will fall down into the breast while cooking.",

The dark meat in the thigh should be about 175\u00b0F The white meat in the breast should be 160 F to 165\u00b0F The turkey juices should be clear, not pink.",

      "Pack the cabbage mixture into the crock as tightly as you can, eliminating air bubbles. Continue packing the cabbage into the container until it is completely submerged by liquid. Then evenly place the remaining kefir grains over the surface of the compressed ingredients. Placing a weight on it helps keep it submerged.",
      "Be sure the ingredients are submerged by 1 inch of liquid be it organic apple, carrot, cabbage juice or filtered spring water. Cover loosely and allow it to sit at room temperature, undisturbed, for at least 4-5 days testing the Kefirkraut every few days until it is done to your liking up to 10-11 days. Transfer to the refrigerator or other cold storage where it should keep for at least six months.",
      "On day 3, check the surface of the liquid for signs of scum seen as froth, foam or possibly kahm yeast and remove this by skimming with a spoon. However, in most cases kahm yeast should not form when Kefir grains are used as a starter-enhancer, for the expedient fermentation does not allow such yeasts to form.",

      "Or, a few kefir grains may be pounded together with amounts of fresh veggies, and filling the brewing vessel as you go. Any of these methods produce a superior kefirkraut in little time.",
      "Fermentation Time:",
      "As a general guide, kefirkraut with 1/2% salt is fermented for 7 to 11 days during winter and 7 days during summer and then the kefirkraut must be refrigerated to mature under cold storage. Although the young kefirkraut may be consumed right away, flavour of 1/2% kefirkraut improves after one week of cold storage. Do sample a small portion of immature kefirkraut before refrigeration. Dom and I prefers the flavour after 1 or 2 weeks. Yes, ripening under cold storage definitely improves flavour, similar to a well aged good wine or room temperature ripened kefir.",

Flip them over and roast the other side-5 or 6 minutes more will give you splotchy-black and blistered tomatoes that are cooked through. Cool. Working over your baking sheet, pull off and discard the blackened tomato skins and, for round tomatoes, cut out the hard \"cores\" where the stems were attached. Transfer tomatoes and chiles to a food processor or blender, along with all the juices on the baking sheet. Blend to a smooth puree.",
      "For canned tomatoes: In a small dry skillet, roast the chiles over medium heat, turning regularly, until they're soft and splotchy-black, about 5 minutes. Place in a blender or food processor along with the drained canned tomatoes. Blend to a smooth puree.",
      "In a medium-size (4- or 5-quart) pot (preferably a Dutch oven or Mexican cazuela), heat the oil or lard over medium heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring regularly, until golden, about 7 minutes. Raise the heat to medium-high, and, when noticeably hotter, stir in the tomato puree. Cook, stirring, until darker in color and thickened to the consistency of tomato paste, about 10 to 15 minutes. Stir in the broth, partially cover and simmer 15 minutes. Taste and season with salt, usually about 1/2 teaspoon. The sauce should be a slightly soupy consistency-not as thick as spaghetti sauce. If it is too thick, stir in a little additional broth. Keep warm over low heat.",
      "Other preliminaries. Stir the crema (or one of its stand-ins) into the sauce. Put the chicken in a bowl and stir 1/2 cup of the sauce mixture into it. Taste and season with additional salt if you think it needs it. Have the cheese at the ready.",
      "Heat the oven to 350\u00b0. Smear about 1/4 cup of the sauce over the bottom of 4 to 6 nine-inch individual ovenproof baking/serving dishes or smear about 1 cup of the sauce over the bottom of a 13x9-inch baking dish. Lay the tortillas out on a baking sheet (2 sheets if you have them, for more even heating), and lightly brush or spray both sides of the tortillas with oil. Bake just to warm through and soften, about 3 minutes. Stack the tortillas and cover with a towel to keep warm.",
      "Working quickly so the tortillas stay hot and pliable, roll a portion of the chicken into each tortilla, then line them all up in the baking dishes. Douse evenly with the remaining sauce, then sprinkle with the cheese. Bake until the enchiladas are hot through (the cheese will have begun to brown), about 15 minutes. Garnish with onion rings and cilantro sprigs. These are best served piping hot from the oven.",
      "MAKE AHEAD The sauce can be made a day or two ahead; refrigerate covered. Once the tortillas have been heated in the oven, you need to work quickly and steadily toward serving in order to preserve their beautiful texture. Once out of the oven, the finished dish softens to near mush over a period of 15 to 20 minutes."

      "In a skillet, heat oil over medium heat. Add onions, carrots and celery and cook, stirring, until softened. Add garlic, rosemary, salt and peppercorns and cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Transfer mixture to slow cooker stoneware. Add cooked beans, vegetable stock or chicken stock and white wine and stir well. Cover and cook on Low for 8 hours or on High for 4 hours, until vegetables are tender.",
      "Drain cod. In a heavy pot with a lid, bring 4 cups water to a boil. Add lemon juice and bay leaf. Add cod and cook until water almost reaches a simmer (it should not boil). Cover and remove from heat. Let fish stand for 15 minutes, until it flakes easily. Using a slotted spoon, lift out cod. Remove any skin, bones or dark pieces and flake cod into small pieces.",
      "Add cod and cream to slow cooker. Cover and cook on High for 1 hour, until mixture is hot and bubbling. Serve piping hot. Serves 6 to 8.",
      "TIP: Salt cod is easy to cook, although it requires a long period of soaking with several changes of water. Planning ahead and cooking the dried beans in conjunction with soaking the fish can make this a relatively time efficient recipe.",
      "MAKE AHEAD: You can soak and cook the beans for this recipe while the cod is de-salting. Soak the beans for at least 8 hours, then cook overnight in the slow cooker. In the morning, continue with step 2.",

      "While the duck is frying, bring to a boil a pot of water deep enough to completely submerge the duck.",
      "Into the pot, add a bouquet garni made of 1 teaspoon fennel seeds, 4 whole star anise, 6 whole cloves, salt and white pepper, dried peel from 1/2 of a tangerine, about 2 oz. sliced ginger root, 4 green onions (tied in knots), and water.",
      "After the stock has simmered for about 20 minutes to release the essences from the bouquet, take the fried duck and place it into the stockpot.",
      "At this point, lower the heat and poach the duck for exactly 1 hour.",
      "This causes the thick fat layer in the duck to dissolve and be extracted from under the skin.",
      "When the allotted cooking time is done, remove the duck from the stockpot, drain it well, and allow it to cool.",

      "With the burner set to medium, cover and steam the duck halves for 20 minutes.",
      "As soon as they come out of the steamer pot, transfer the duck halves to a preheated 375 degree oven.",
      "In about 15 to 20 minutes the oven heat will cause the water from the steaming process to evaporate from the duck meat, consequently crisping up the skin in the process.",
      "This is probably the most critical part of the entire recipe, because a miscalculation here could completely dry out the duck and make it stringy instead of crispy and juicy.",
      "So, it is important to watch the halves carefully while they are in the oven.",
      "You'll now make the Mandarin Sauce from these ingredients listed in the ingredients section: 1 small onion diced, 2 ribs celery (coarsely chopped), 2 cups of the poaching stock, 2 tablespoons soy sauce, 3/4 head of crushed garlic, 4 tablespoons all-purpose flour, and 2 tablespoons cornstarch.",
      "While the halves are crisping, take about 1/2 cup of the oil from the skillet you originally browned the duck in and pour it into a wok.",
      "Then over high heat, fry down until the veggies are richly browned.",
      "When all the veggies have caramelized (which intensely flavors the oil and which should take about 5 minutes or so), spoon into the wok about 3 or 4 tablespoons of all-purpose flour and cook it into the oil to make a roux.",

      "When you steam the duck halves, rest them on top of strips of green onions or carrot slices so that the steam can circulate under the meat. Otherwise, the duck will not cook consistantly.",
      "Be careful when adding the poaching stock to the hot roux. If this is done carelessly, the oil could splatter and cause severe burns! When doing this, I wrap a thick towel around my arm."
