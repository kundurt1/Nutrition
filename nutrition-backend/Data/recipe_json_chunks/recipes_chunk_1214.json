Add in 4 1/2 cups of the flour and salt gradually until the mixture comes together into a soft dough. Fold in the blueberries gently. Add the remaining flour 1/4 cup at a time until the dough is stiff but not dry. Turn out the dough on a lightly floured surface and knead until the dough is elastic and no longer sticks to your hands, adding flour as needed, about 7-10 minutes. Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, turning to coat, cover with a clean dish cloth and set in a warm place to rise until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour.",

Place the bagels on the prepared sheet as you work, then cover with the clean dish towel and let rise for an additional 25 minutes.",

Working in batches (about 3-4 at a time), gently submerge the bagels into the boiling water and boil until they rise to the top, about 3-5 minutes. Transfer the bagels to the prepared baking sheet and repeat until all of the bagels have been boiled. Bake for 35 minutes, flipping after the first 5, until golden brown.

      "Heat cooking oil in a cast iron skillet and cover the bottom of the pan with beef chunks. Make sure to not crowd the pan and brown until at least a couple sides of each chunk are good and browned. Remove to a bowl that will fit all the beef, easily be covered and can go in your refrigerator. Repeat with the rest of the meat When all the meat is browned deglaze the pan with red wine, stir and scrape the browned bits off the bottom and simmer for a minute or two to reduce the liquid. Scrape the liquid into the bowl with the beef. (I did two batches of meat in my 12 inch cast iron and then deglazed the pan, rinsed it and did a third batch. I didn't want the browned bits to get too burned but your pan/stove/etc may be different).",
      "Wipe or rinse the pan and heat up another tablespoon or so of fat. Sautee the onions and celery until tender, seasoning with salt, pepper and maybe some thyme, or ground rosemary or even more ground sage.

Pour the tomato and all the stock into the crock pot. I added beef broth until it was just under the level of the beef. Tuck the bay and rosemary in the liquid. I wrapped my rosemary in cheesecloth so I wouldn't have to fish out individual rosemary leaves.",
      "Turn heat to low and cook for 8-10 hours. Mine cooked for 9 hours and was perfect.",
      "In the evening:",
      "Turn the oven to 375. Place chopped root vegetables in a baking pan and coat with olive or coconut oil. Salt and pepper liberally and stir to combine everything. Roast until the veggies are tender and browned. Feel free to crank the heat to 425 if they are tender but not yet brown and you are hungry. Should take 20-30 minutes depending on how big your chunks are.",
      "Stir the stew, remove bay and rosemary and taste for seasonings. Mine didn't need any more salt but yours might. I did add a tsp of red wine vinegar and it really perked things up. I recommend you do the same :) I also left the cover off while the veggies roasted to allow everything to thicken up a bit more.",

      "Alternative if you don't own or don't use a crock pot:",
      "Instead of putting beef and carrots and stock in a crock pot, put it in a heavy stock pot. Simmer on the stovetop for a couple hours, or bring to a boil and then place in a 350 degree oven for a couple hours. Proceed as above."

      "3) Prep the chicken - take skins off if you bought chicken with the skin on. Rinse the chicken with water and pat dry. Create slits in the pieces randomly with a knife so that the spices can get into the meat.",
      "4) Take about 4 spoons of the onion, garlic, ginger paste and the spices (Indian chili powder, turmeric, cumin) and coat the chicken with it all. Add the salt as well. NOTE RE SPICES: we never measure these spices, but ratios help. For this part of the recipe, smaller amounts of each chili powder, cumin, and turmeric are fine - let's say one spoon of each, more of the chili powder if you want it spicy.",
      "5) Place a 6-8 quart pot on medium-high heat. Add a turn or two of canola oil, enough to evenly coat the bottom of the pot. When the oil is heated through, add cloves, cardamom (try to open them up a bit), and cinnamon bark. Stir the whole spices around a little until fragrant.",
      "6) Once you start smelling the whole spices, add the rest of your onion/garlic/ginger paste. Cook until the paste starts to take on a slightly reddish color. Add larger amounts of the spices now. I will do two generous shakes of the chili powder (I like my curries spicy), one shake of ground cumin, and one shake of turmeric. If it looks too brown, I will add some turmeric and chili powder because I want it to be a little brighter.",
      "7) Add the chicken after the paste and spices incorporate. Stir frequently so the chicken does not stick to the pot. Once all the chicken turns opaque on the outside, cover with a lid, lower the heat to medium and let everything cook together for about 20 minutes.",
      "8) After 20 minutes, check the pot to see if any liquid has come out. This is the curry! If it looks dry, add some a couple cups of hot water to the pot, but only if it looks totally dry. Stir the chicken and recover the pot, lower the heat a little more, and let it all simmer/stew together for another 20 minutes.",
      "9) 15 minutes into the second 20 minutes, add the Thai chilies. Make sure they are washed. If you want more of the heat to come out of the chilies, make one diagonal slit in each chili. Adding the chilies is optional.",
      "10) At the end of the 20 minutes, check your pot. There should be ample curry. Give it all a final stir and check the chicken to make sure it is all cooked through. It should be by now, but you can never be too careful! Have some cooked rice handy and serve with some saag bhaji (another recipe!). This recipe is easy to scale up or down and if you have leftovers, you can eat this up to 4 days after you make it, at least."

Taste the broth of the stew at this point and decide if it needs a little salt or pepper. Also decide if there is enough broth, and at this point you can add more wine or beef broth.",

      "Now you need to thicken the broth just a bit. Easiest way is to take about two tablespoons of flour, in a small bowl, and add about a tablespoon of oil. This will make a paste - add enough of the broth from the stew to this mixture to thin it out, to make it almost pourable. Add this mixture to the stew, stirring constantly as you pour it in (or it will lump up). When it's mixed in well, put the cover back on and let it cook about 10 more minutes."

But please, follow the directions faithfully and you will be rewarded! These loaves are gorgeous- beautiful- very crusty and brown and smell soooooo good. When I first made them I couldn't wait until they cooled completely so I cut off an end piece and bit into it. It was fantastic! I was surprised that the potato peel didn't make any distinct difference to the texture. I thought it would.The resulting bread was very distinctly tasting of potato. It was soft, as potato breads are, but yeasty and a little dense(in a good way) and had a wonderful crusty exterior.It was fantastic! I think you are going to love these.",

      "Strain sauce; reduce some more (I found this step unnecessary; it had reduced quite a bit cooking with the stock). Combine butter and flour. In stages, whisk in the butter/flour mixture until sauce is the proper consistency (you want it to be a little thickened -- just imagine it on a plate with salmon. you will probably use all of the mixture). Whisk until butter is melted before adding more. Add just a bit of butter for a sheen, if desired.",
      "Heat light olive oil in pan over medium-high heat. Mix salt, paprika, onion and garlic powders. Coat one side of salmon filet with spice mix; place in pan spice side down. Sprinkle other side of fish with spice mix. Cook until seared (maybe 2-3 minutes each side, depending on thickness); salmon will have a wonderful crust. Flip and cook until other side is seared. If you like your salmon more done, you can cook longer, but the absolute worst is to have it overcooked, and it will cook a bit after you remove it from the pan. Seriously, you're not gonna die from some slightly rawish salmon. This whole searing salmon thing is not something I'd done before, and it's a fantastic way to prepare it. The fats and sugars ooze out and combine with the spice rub to make this just perfect crust.",
      "To serve, coat plate with red wine sauce; add salmon filet. Add veggies -- Mr. Stellino added steamed, sauteed baby bok choy; I found broccoli works well too with that sauce. Add mashed potatoes if you're into starch. Anything else will absorb too much of the sauce. Serve with glasses of the same wine you used in the sauce.",
      "Note: another thing Mr. Stellino did was to chop and fry up some slab bacon (apparently this kind he gets is as expensive as foie gras -- it made me want to eat bacon, and i am a vegetarian except for fish), and sprinkle some on top of the salmon when done. This is not necessary but might add some nice flavor."
