Depending on the pepper, you may have to slice around the stem of the pepper to create a manageable opening to squeeze the filling in. Fill either a pastry bag or use something that will allow you squeeze and put your filling inside the jalapeno pepper. Be careful to not overfill the pepper; it may squirt while cooking. Wrap each pepper with 1 to 2 strips of bacon, securing the opening in the pepper to soak toothpicks first to prevent burning in the barbecue.
