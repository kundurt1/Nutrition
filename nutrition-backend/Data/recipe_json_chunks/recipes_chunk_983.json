      "Flavor -- Remove from the microwave and add in the flavoring and any other additions such as nuts or dried fruits, etc. Anything you want. Stir to combine.",
      "Add to your pan. At this point you can add some additional nuts or toppings it you want. Cover with plastic and cool in the refrigerator about 1 hour. Remove from the pan by just turning it over, it will come right out, pull off the foil, parchment paper or wax paper, and cut into squares. You can let it cool right on the counter, but I like to chill mine before cutting, it just makes it a bit easier.",
      "Favorites -- 1) Dark chocolate, vanilla flavor, walnuts; 2) White chocolate, amaretto flavor, almonds; 3) A layer of milk chocolate (1/2 recipe), vanilla flavor, a layer of peanut butter fudge (1/2 recipe) with 1/2 cup strawberry preserves and peanuts; 4) Milk chocolate, vanilla flavor, marshmallow cream, peanuts; 5) White chocolate, almond flavor, dried cherries; 6) Milk chocolate, peppermint flavor, mint chocolate cookies, walnuts; 7) Butterscotch, vanilla flavor, pecans; 8) White chocolate, mint flavor, candy cane pieces; 9) Mint chocolate, hazelnut flavor, white morsels to swirl in, hazelnuts; 10) White chocolate, almond flavor, PayDay candy bar crunched up; 11) White chocolate, rapsberry liquor, raspberry preserves, walnuts; 12) Dark chocolate, orange preserves, amaretto flavor, pecans.",

If you don't have one of those, drop the batter off of a serving spoon into the center of the can. Try to smooth the tops a little with a narrow rubber spatula.

Strain the sauce in a colander and remove the carrots, onion, celery, thyme, garlic, and bay leaf. Return the sauce to the pot, place over medium heat, and reduce by 1/3. Depending on how much liquid you actually began with, this should take 20 to 45 minutes.",

    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "Prep: Two days before cooking:",
      "Turkey must be thoroughly thawed before preparing for the oven unless you are using a fresh turkey.",
      "I finished thawing mine using the cold water method two days before cooking.",
      "Remove turkey parts from cavities and use as you desire.",
      "Wash cavities well with cold water and drain as well as you can.",
      "Snake your hand carefully between the skin and meat to create a pocket in which to put the spices. I got up to the neck, although didn't break through, and down the sides to the hip joint. I also made a pocket in the inner thigh of each leg. I really took my time with this so I wouldn't break through the skin. I didn't do the back, but I suppose you could?.",
      "Mix Salt, Pepper, Garlic powder and Onion powder in a bowl.",
      "Using a spoonful of this mixture at a time in your hand, reach in to the pockets you have created and rub into the bird, and some in the cavity as well. When all the mixture has been used, move your hands around on the outside of the skin, and massage the bird to break up the tissues to allow the meat to absorb the rub.",
      "Place the whole bird in a large SEALED food safe bag. I used a Reynolds Oven Bag-Turkey Size. Refrigerate turkey for 1-2 days (I refrigerated mine for about 36 hours). (Note: I don't use the oven bag to cook the bird!).",
      "On the day you will serve the bird, preheat oven to 400\u00b0F I know this sounds nuts, just go with it!",
      "Prepare a roasting pan with a rack. I greased my rack with bacon grease. Mmmmm -- bacon -- !",
      "Pour 3 cups of chicken broth in the pan.",
      "On the stovetop, boil about 2-3 quarts water (must be scalding hot.).",
      "Remove the turkey from the oven bag (which you can now throw away) and place the bird in a clean sink.",
      "Pour hot water over the entire turkey including in the cavities. The skin will shrink tightly to the turkey, squishing in that yummy rub you put in 2 days ago! It will also help hold the natural juices in the turkey while it is cooking. I poured half of the water on the bird's back, then turned it over to pour on the breast.",
      "I did not stuff my bird, and since I've never stuffed a turkey, I'll defer to Uncle Bill here, and he states in his recipe to stuff the bird, line the inside of the cavity with cheesecloth, then stuff LOOSELY with your favorite dressing.",
      "Tie legs with a good meat wrapping twine. Alternately, some birds have a spot pre-cut at the base of their spine to push their legs through.",
      "Lightly salt and pepper the outside of the bird, front and back.",
      "Drizzle 1/4 cup olive oil across the front of the bird. Using a basting brush, your hand or a paper towel, lightly coat the bird, careful not to remove the salt and pepper (I suppose you could do these steps the other way, this is just how I did it.).",
      "Place the bird BACK SIDE UP (really, trust me!) on the rack. I'll warn you, this will leave lines in the breast of your bird, but a beautiful bird that's dry and tasteless is NOT going to make you the holiday hero!",
      "Pour the other 1/4 c of olive oil on the back of the bird, and using a basting brush, your hand or a paper towel, lightly coat the bird.",
      "Cover the turkey completely with aluminum foil, pinching the foil tightly to the roasting pan which will create a wonderful moist, hot, convection within the pan. Be careful to tent the foil enough so it doesn't touch the bird (it will stick) or use a layer of the non-stick foil to avoid this problem.",
      "Place turkey on lower rack in oven and cook for 1 hour.",
      "Reduce heat to 325 F and continue to cook for 45 minutes.",
      "Now, flip the bird over! This might take two people. My hubby used heavy work gloves covered with Ziploc bags. It was a sight! Make sure you have the roasting pan on a steady level surface where it won't slip around. Some folks talk about doing this with the pan placed on the floor.",
      "Re-cover and pinch the foil back down (as best you can since your pan will be hot!) Be sure to keep it from touching the bird, or use the layer of non-stick foil if you have it.",
      "Continue cooking the bird covered for another 90 minutes.",
      "Remove the foil and baste the bird. Leave a triangle-shaped piece of the non-stick foil over the breast, but leave the legs exposed. The dark meat takes longer to cook through, and covering the breast (supposedly) helps keep the leaner white meat protected from drying out.",
      "Baste every 15-20 minutes for the next 45 minutes.",
      "Take a temp reading using a meat thermometer in the thickest part of the breast, and another spot in the thickest part of the thigh, without touching bone. You want a reading of 155\u00b0F If you aren't there, continue to cook the bird until you reach 155\u00b0F",
      "When you reach a reading of 155\u00b0F, remove the bird, baste once more, and cover it again with foil. WAIT 30 MINUTES BEFORE CARVING. During this 30 minutes, \"carryover\" cooking will continue and the temperature of the bird will continue to rise. Safe cooked temperature for a turkey is 165\u00b0F as of this writing. If you make the mistake of cooking to 165\u00b0 or heaven forbid 175\u00b0, you risk turning your beautiful turkey into something that's tragically desiccated.",
      "There is no need to baste the turkey until the last part of cooking, this saves you a lot of time as you do not have to remove the foil tent during the first few hours, and you will keep your oven at a more consistent cooking temperature allowing your bird to cook faster.",
      "These are Uncle Bill's COOKING TIMES (my 21.5 pound bird was in the oven 4 1/2 hours so I think these might be a bit long, but it may depend on your oven. I would err on checking the bird sooner rather than later - you can't uncook something!).",

Storing the fruit at or below 40 degrees deactivates an enzyme that breaks down its pectin during ripening. If this happens before the flesh is ripe, the pectin will remain intact and the flesh texture will be mealy. The lesson: Store peaches on the counter."

Mix 3/4 teaspoon natural coconut rum and 1/4 teaspoon pure vanilla extract with 2 tablespoons ice water and pour evenly over mixture. Process on high for 5 seconds. Add remaining 1/3 cup flour. Process high for 5 seconds. Place mixture on flat surface covered with waxed paper. Roughly mold into disc shape. Cover dough with waxed paper and roll just until dough is an evenly thick circle, about 1/8-inch thick or less. Remove top half of waxed paper. Turn dough-side down into 10-inch deep dish pie plate. Peel away remaining waxed paper. Fit dough evenly into pan without pressing too hard in any area.Trim pastry slightly larger than the pan and flute edges using forefinger and thumbs (if dough becomes too soft, temper in the freezer for 2 minutes and continue until finished). Lightly move a rolling pin over top surface of finished fluted edge to give a uniform appearance; Pierce dough with fork every 2-3 inches over pie plate surface and place into freezer for 10 minutes. Preheat oven to 375\u00b0F Remove shell from freezer. Place small, light butter plate over middle of frozen dough. Bake shell for 15 minutes. Remove small plate from center of crust with tongs.

    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "Begin by making sure that all your utensils, pots and supplies are very clean. Put the milk into a pot over medium heat. Heat it to a low boil, but keep careful that it doesn't scorch. Cook it for about 5 minutes then set it aside to cool down until 'warm to the touch'. Dilute the Pitia in the water and stir it into the warm milk. Stir in the salt and cover the pot with a clean, cloth towel and set it aside to thicken and curdle in a warm place. This can take anywhere from 6 to 12 hours.",
      "Pour the thickened milk into a basket or strainer that has been lined with cheese cloth or fine tulle/netting. Cover the basket with another piece of net to keep the insects off and hang it over a sink, or outside so it can drain thoroughly. Check on the draining cheese. If it seems that the chunks of curd are too big, you can slice through them with a knife to break them up so more of the water will drain out. It takes about a full day for the cheese to drain to 'Feta' consistency, but if you prefer a harder, dryer cheese, you can let it drain longer. You can also weight down the draining cheese with a dish and a heavy rock placed over it to aid in squeezing out more water and will also give you a thicker cheese.",
      "Make the Brine: You will need enough brine to cover the cheese completely so put an adequate amount of water into a pot and bring it to a boil. Boil it for 5 minutes, then remove it from the heat. Add some salt to the water. You will be using the egg as a gauge for the salinity of your brine. Float the egg in the brine. Some of the shell should float above water level, if not, remove the egg and add more salt to the brine. Put the egg back in to test it again. You want 1-2cm of shell to be exposed at the water level. The more shell that floats, the saltier the brine. Keep floating / adding salt until you get the salinity that you want. Cover the brine and set it aside to cool down completely.",
      "Invert the basket with the drained cheese onto a clean work surface and remove the cheese cloth. Cut the cheese into large blocks and put them into a clean and sterile container. Pour the cooled brine over the cheese. Keep in mind that Feta has to be completely submerged in the brine or else it will go bad. Use an inverted plate with a heavy rock placed on it to keep the Feta under the brine level."
