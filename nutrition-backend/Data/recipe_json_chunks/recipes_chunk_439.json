In a large mixing bowl, combine remaining sugar and the oil and mix until smooth. Add salt, 1 cup of flour and the yeast mixture. Stir well. Add the remaining 5 cups of flour, 1/2 cup at a time, until the dough pulls away from the side of the bowl. Turn the dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth, supple and elastic, about 10 minutes. Lightly oil a large mixing bowl. Place the dough in it, turning once to coat all sides with oil. Cover with a damp cloth or plastic wrap and let sit in a warm place until the dough has doubled in volume, about 1 hour. Turn the dough onto a lightly floured surface and divide into 4 equal parts. Form each piece into a cylinder and roll out until the \"log\" is 1/2-inch in diameter. Using a sharp knife, cut each log into 1/2-inch pieces. Place the pieces flat side down onto 2 lightly greased baking sheets. Gently press down each piece to flatten."
