      "Add the 2 tablespoons butter; when it melts, swirl it around the pan until its foam subsides, then pour in the egg mixture.",
      "Cook, undisturbed, for about 30 seconds, then use a rubber spatula to push the edges of the eggs toward the center.",
      "As you do this, tip the pan to allow the uncooked eggs in the center to reach the perimeter.",
      "Continue this process until the omelet is mostly cooked but still quite runny in the center, a total of about 3 minutes (you can cook until the center firms up if you prefer).",
      "There are several ways to proceed.",
      "You can try rolling the omelet out of the pan to form a cylinder; this is the most traditional, elegant (and, of course, difficult) method; to do this, hold the pans handle at about a 45-degree angle above the plate and begin to roll from the handle end.",
      "Or you can fold the omelet in thirds, which is almost as nice, using a large spatula.",
      "The easiest thing to do, and its not only acceptable but lovely, is to fold the omelet in half and slide it from the pan.",
