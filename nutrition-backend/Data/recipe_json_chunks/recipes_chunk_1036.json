      "Spray inside of crockpot with spray cooking oil (I do this because it makes cleaning the crock so much easier).",
      "Place pork in crockpot along with about 1/4 cup of water and cook on low all day or high for about 3-4 hours (cooking time varies according to your crockpot and the size of your pork loin -- if it is large and I need it to be done faster, I will cut the loin into smaller chunks). You will know when it is done, when you can shred it with a fork.",
      "About 15-20 minutes before I want to serve, in a pot on the stove, I bring the cans of broth to just the point of boiling and then I add the bag of noodles and cook basically according to the directions on the package. Hopefully, most of the liquid will be absorded, if any is left, you might want to drain it off. For this dish, the noodles should NOT be soupy.",
      "While the noodles are cooking, remove your pork loin from the crockpot and gently shred the pork. We like it not to be stringy and not to have chunks that are too big. Just nice bite sized pieces.",
      "When the noodles are done, add the pork to the pot of noodles and stir so pork is distributed throughout. If pork wasn't warm when you added it, let the noodles/pork reheat. Taste - if bland, you'll need to add more salt and pepper.",
      "Serve with warm bread and a salad. Nice comfort food.",
      "NOTE - my mom cooks the pork on the stove in a pot. After salt/peppering the pork, I think she browns all sides of the loin and then turns down to low and cooks for 2-3 hours - with a little water or broth in the bottom of the pan. Then she removes the pork to be shredded and in the same pot cooks her noodles and then adds pork back.",
      "TIP - if you aren't worried about watching fat, add the juice/drippings that are in the bottom of the crockpot to the cans of broth - the drippings add an extra depth to the flavor of the dish!",
      "NOTE - if your pork loin is on the small side (closer to 1 pound), you will want to use less noodles and less broth. You should be able to get pork with every bite of noodles."

      "Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Rinse Pork Top loin then pat dry. Apply barbecue rub to the outside of the pork loin, use as much rub as you see fit. I keep it to where it is lightly coated more like a heavy salt and pepper consistency. Next, lightly apply the brown sugar so that it coats the top of the rub and covers the loin. Place pork loin on a raised rack in a 13x9 cooking dish and slide in the oven. Let it cook until you see that the brown sugar is just starting to roll off of the pork loin and onto the bottom of the cooking dish, then add 3/4 cup of water and 3/4 cup of apple juice along with the 1 1/2tbs of liquid smoke to the bottom of the cooking dish. Cook until the internal temperature of the meat is around 140 degrees and drain the sauce from the cooking dish and into a warm pan on the stove, \"Place loin back in the oven and continue to cook\", add the red bell pepper, mushrooms, and onion to sauce on the stove and reduce the sauce until it is the consistency you want. combine the 5tbs of ketchup and the 1/4 cup of apple juice and Baste the loin with the glaze 2-3 time before the loin is finished cooking. This is not a real thick glaze! More like a mop sauce. Remove pork loin when internal temperature is 165-170 degrees and let it rest for 8-10 minutes. Slice pork loin into 3/4 inch slices and top with the sauce from the stove, and serve while hot. This dish goes well with white rice also."
