      "Bake blind for 20 minutes then remove the baking beans/rice and parchment and bake for a further 5 minutes or until the pastry is golden",
      "Let cool and if you're not using loose bottomed tins, release the pastry now before you fill them",
      "Meanwhile, drain the canned pineapple, reserving 100mls of the juice.",
      "Put the juice in a small saucepan",
      "If your pineapple is in chunks, crush it with a fork or potato masher and drain off any more juice that comes out.",

      "The pineapple will begin to soften the pastry bases within 24 hours if not drained well enough these are best eaten the day you make them.",

      "TOOLS YOU NEED: safety goggles, a very sharp knife that can handle tough foods, a cutting board, a mini food chopper or a standard food processor, and freezer bags.",
      "I use gallon-size Hefty One-Zips.",
      "OPTIONAL- Allergan tear drops or other natural tears, rubber gloves.",

      "If you use a strong food processor, you can just throw the peeled onions in and pulse until they are chopped to the consistency you like.",
      "Store in the freezer bags, making sure you label it with the date you packed it.",
      "I use a gallon size bag for this amount of onions, sometimes two gallon-size bags.",
      "Use the tear drops in case the goggles slip or you feel any burning after cleanup!",
      "If you use the mini food chopper, cut the onions into pieces that will fit in the chopper's cup, then pulse until chopped, and repeat until you use up all the onion pieces, spooning the chopped onion out into the freezer bags.",
      "If you're cooking with onions the same or next day, put some aside (see next step for amounts.",
      ").",
      "When a recipe calls for a \"small onion\", I use 1/4 cup.",
      "If it calls for a \"regular\" onion, 1/3 cup.",
      "\"Large\" onion = 1/2 cup.",
      "Otherwise, just follow what the recipe says for the amount of chopped onion if they give you an actual measurement.",
      "FOR FUTURE USE AFTER FROZEN: Simply open the freezer bag and measure out what you need with the cups or spoons.",
      "You may need to add just a wee bit extra to make up for frost crystals taking up space.",
      "You can thaw it out over a couple hours or overnight, but I prefer to microwave for about 30 seconds then blot off the excess frost and water.",
      "The onion usually lasts indefinitely once frozen, but I find that after about 6-7 months it starts to lose potency from freezerburn.",
      "This is why it's important to label the bags with the dates you packed them.",
