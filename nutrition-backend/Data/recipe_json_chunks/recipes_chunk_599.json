Add potatoes and leeks and cook until leeks are wilted, stirring occasionally, 5 minutes. Add water and bring to a boil over medium high heat. Reduce heat to medium low and simmer until potatoes are tender, 15-20 minutes. Stir in 1 cup milk, mustard, salt and pepper. Working in batches, puree soup in food processor until smooth, about 20 seconds per batch. Return soup to sauce pan and stir in remaining milk. In a small bowl whisk together the egg yolk and cream, then stir into soup and simmer until hot. Garnish each serving with chopped parsley, and black pepper if desired. Makes 6 servings."
