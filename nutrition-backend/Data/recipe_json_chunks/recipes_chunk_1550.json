      "Add 4-6 cups of water and chicken parts. Boil chicken for about 15 minutes until the meat is tender and falls off the bone.",
      "Remove chicken, but continue to simmer broth. Remove meat from bones and place in a bowl for later use. Put the skin and bones back into the pot and continue to simmer for at least an hour. Add the tablespoon of salt, or season to your taste (leave the pepper for later). If your heart desires it, add a cube of oxo or something, for a little extra pizazz. I generally think the chicken adds great flavour to the stock so I don't really bother.",
      "In the meantime, you can go ahead and chop up your zucchini and your potatoes.",
      "When you think the stock is ready (taste it!), use a colander to strain the broth, thereby catching the bones and skin of the chicken- these are not things you want in your finished product. I usually just strain it into a new pot, but if you have fancy double decker pots with the strainer inside this would be a good opportunity to use it",
      "With your lovely fresh broth continuing to simmer on the stove, go ahead and add your zucchini, potatoes and chicken. When the potatoes are fork tender, add your fresh noodles. It won't take long for them to cook.",
      "When the noodles are soft and slippery, it's time to add the pepper! This broth is really peppery so add as much as you can handle. Pour into bowls and garnish with green onion, or dried seaweed. Enjoy!"

      "For the sponge:",
      "1. Preheat the oven to 180 C/160 C fan. Line a Swiss roll tin (23cm x 33cm) with parchment paper.",
      "2. Melt the chocolate in a heat safe bowl over a pan filled with a little water which should be just about at simmering point. Allow the chocolate to melt slowly and make sure that the water doesn't touch the chocolate in the bowl. Once it has completely melted, carefully remove it from the heat and allow it to cool. Chocolate is quite sensitive and the first time I did this, I didn't allow it to cool for long enough and the chocolate seized up. What I find quite useful is to transfer the melted chocolate from the bowl which has been suspended over the water to another bowl. This may add to the washing up but it helps cool the chocolate and prevent you wasting a whole bar of chocolate. Make sure to use a spatula if transferring it to another bowl to make sure you don't leave any chocolate behind.",
      "3. While the chocolate is cooling, whisk the eggs, vanilla extract and sugar in a large bowl using a mixer or whisk, until thick, frothy and pale yellow in colour. You will know that it is ready when the whisk leaves a trail when run through the mixture. This will take about 10 minutes by hand and about 5 minutes if using an electric mixer. Carefully fold in the cooled white chocolate and then the flour. Remember that you want the sponge to be light so be gentle and try to keep in as much air as possible.",
      "4. Pour the mixture into the lined tray, smooth the top so that the batter covers the entire pan, and bake in the oven for 15-20 minutes until it feels spongy. It won't look like a traditional sponge cake so don't be alarmed by this and don't be tempted to continue cooking it as this will likely lead to a cracked Swiss roll. While the sponge is baking, place a large sheet of parchment paper on a work top and sprinkle with caster sugar.",
      "5. Once ready, remove the sponge from the oven and quickly flip the tin over onto the sugared paper. Remove the tin and then gently peel off the paper from the bottom of the sponge. From the short end, loosely roll up the sponge and sugared paper together to form the traditional roll. Leave it rolled up to cool completely.",
      "For the filling and topping:",
      "1. Melt the white chocolate over a pan of hot water as before. Again allow the melted chocolate to cool a little. Lightly whip the double cream. You don't want it to be too thick but you also don't want it to pour out of the sides. Then gently fold the white chocolate (holding back about 1-2 tablespoons for drizzling on top) and the seeds from the vanilla pod or vanilla bean paste (if using) into the cream. Next fold in half of the pistachio pieces.",
      "2. Unroll the Swiss roll and spread the cream over the sponge leaving about a 1cm gap around the edges. Next take the raspberries (holding back 5-6 full raspberries to put on top of the Swiss roll) and lightly break them in your hands over the cream. You don't want a pulp but just some bits of raspberries and some of the juice scattered over the cream. Finally, sprinkle over half of the remaining pistachio pieces and then carefully re-roll the Swiss roll.",
      "3. To decorate, using a spoon or fork, drizzle over the remaining melted chocolate. Scatter over the remaining pistachio pieces and top with the reserved whole raspberries."

      "First, make the crust dough. All in all it takes a lot of chilling time and patience, but it's very simple. Set up a food processor and combine the flour, salt, peach yogurt, and cold butter in its bowl. Pulse it all together until it is like pebbly wet sand. Then run the processor while you pour in the ice water until it comes together into a big ball of dough. Divide it in half and press each half out lightly into a disc. Wrap each disc in plastic and let it chill in the fridge for 45 minutes. When the time is up, line a sheet tray with a silicone mat or parchment. Roll each disc out on a clean and floured surface to about 1/4 inch thick. Use a 4 inch biscuit cutter to cut 6 circles out of each half of dough to get 12 total and line them up on the sheet tray. Chill the dough circles again on the tray for 30 minutes.",
      "While the dough chills, make the easy filling. Combine the peaches, brown sugar, cinnamon and bourbon in a pan and heat it up over medium high heat. Let it gently bubble and cook for about 10 minutes until it becomes thick and syrupy. Let it cool until the dough discs are done chilling. Then take the chilled dough discs out and scoop a tablespoon of filling onto one half of each disc. Brush a little water around the edge of each disc, then bring the other half over to enclose the filling. Pinch the edges together really well, then use a fork to make pretty tine marks around each edge. Refrigerate the formed pies again for 30 minutes.",
      "Pre-heat the oven to 375\u00b0F and get the egg wash and sugar out. Take the formed pies out and brush them all generously with the egg wash. Use a small paring knife to make three little cuts across the top of each pie to vent them. Then sprinkle them all generously with sugar on top. Let them bake for about 30-40 minutes, until the dough is completely golden and crisp. Let them cool for a few minutes, then serve warm! These also keep well sealed in the refrigerator, then heated up in the toaster oven."

Press the zucchini fritters out in your hands and then place 4 to 5 into the basket at a time, spraying the tops with oil spray. Cook until the edges are golden brown and the top is crisp, about 10-15 minutes. Use a spatula to flip (the bottom will stick to the basket, which is why I prefer the oven) and cook an additional 5-7 minutes."

      "1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees and line a standard muffin pan with paper liners. In a large bowl, sift together the cocoa, instant coffee, flour, sugar, baking soda, baking powder and salt. Whisk in the eggs, then buttermilk, oil, warm water and vanilla. Stir gently to combine completely. Pour batter into lined muffin pan, filling cups 3/4 full. Bake for 20 minutes or just until the tops spring back when touched. Cool for 5-10 minutes in the pan and transfer to a wire rack.",
      "2. For the filling, in a blender, puree the thawed raspberries and strain through a fine wire strainer to remove the seeds. Transfer to a small saucepan, add the sugar and cornstarch and bring to a boil over medium low heat. Cook until mixture thickens-you want it thick enough to pipe into the cupcake centers. Remove from the heat and allow to cool.",
      "3. For the frosting, in the bowl of a mixer fixed with the paddle attachment, beat the two sticks of butter until soft and smooth. Add half of the milk, half of the powdered sugar, the cocoa and vanilla and beat to combine. Gradually add more sugar and/or more milk until you reach the taste and consistency desired.",
      "4. Fill a piping bag fitted with a medium round tip with the cooled raspberry filling. Gently insert the piping tip into the cupcake and squeeze out a small amount of filling. Continue with remaining cupcakes and clean any filling that may have oozed out the top with a butter knife or offset spatula.",
      "5. Fill a piping bag fitted with a large star tip with chocolate icing. Decorate to your liking. I used sugar flowers I picked up from a local cake supply store. They can also be purchased online at various cake supply websites."

And in my house with two children, one of which is an etenally starved male teen, this is quite impossible to accomplish. More often than not I give into the request to dump the bread out of the pan before it is cool and slice. This leads to a somewhat mashed and crumbly cut of bread. If you, like me, cannot wait, I suggest cutting one loaf before it is cool. Let the second loaf cool completely, loosen the edges with a spatula and knife, and then place on a cutting board. Read below for cutting instructions.",
      "2. One of the best parts of this bread is the crunchy top crust. However, that can be hard to cut through without pushing down and mashing the bread. If you flip it over, making the top of the bread rest on the cutting board, you can slice with much ease as the cooling in the pan creates a very moist bread.",
      "3. This is an optional idea, but I like to cook my Strawberry Pecan Bread in my clay bread pans. They are the same size as those listed in the recipe but the clay seems to make a better outer edge on the bread."

They will brown a little on top and that's ok. Insert a toothpick in the center of each to make sure it comes out cleanly. Let them cool for 10 minutes, then pull them out by the parchment flaps and place them on a cooling rack to cool completely.",
      "While the cake loafs bake and cool, make the marzipan. Whisk the almond flour, powdered sugar and granulated sugar together in a large mixing bowl. Add the egg and almond extract and stir it all together until it starts to all bind together in almost a dough. Bring it together with clean hands and knead it for a few minutes to make sure it is smooth and uniform. Form it into a rectangle, cover it in plastic and refrigerate it until you are ready to assemble the cake.",
      "Take the cooled cakes and trim the edges and top so that they are perfect, flat rectangles. Then cut each of them in half lengthwise so that you now have 4 thin little rectangles. Heat the apricot jam in the microwave for 30 seconds to a minute. Brush the long side of one rectangle with the jam and sandwich it with a rectangle of the opposite color. Then brush the top of the sandwich with more jam and place the rectangles of the opposite colors on top of them. Brush the inside edge of the top rectangles so that they stick together. Then brush the rest of the jam all over the outside before you wrap it in marzipan.",
      "Roll out the marzipan between two pieces of parchment paper to be a long, thin rectangle. The short side should be long enough for the cake, while the long side should be long enough to wrap it up. Place the cake along the the short side of the marzipan near the edge and bring the long side over gently to tightly enclose it. Pinch the edges together and smooth them out and trim away the excess. Use a fork to gently score criss cross marks on the top for some visual interest. Serve with tea! It will also keep for days covered in the refrigerator since the marzipan keeps the cake from drying out."

      "Get out two sheet trays and line them with either silicone mats that have macaron templates on them, or parchment paper. If using parchment paper, draw 30 equal circles on each piece to make yourself a template and turn them over to have the ink face down. They should be the size of the palm of your hand. Then take the almond flour and powdered sugar and press them through a fine mesh strainer into a large mixing bowl. This will take a little time and elbow grease but it is completely necessary for the texture of the cookies. Whisk them together in the bowl to blend them. Then pour in half of the egg white liquid, the lavender extract and purple food coloring. Use a spatula to fold and mash the mixture together into a uniform paste. Set the paste aside.",
      "Combine the sugar and water in a small saucepan and heat it up over medium high heat. Use a candy thermometer to make sure it reaches 243\u00b0F. While it heats up, set up a stand mixer with a whisk attachment and pour the remaining egg whites into it. Whip up the egg whites on high speed until they hold stiff peaks. Turn the speed to low and keep whipping the egg whites while the sugar comes to temperature on the stove. When the sugar reaches temperature, slowly and carefully pour it into the stand mixer with the egg whites and let it get mixed in. Turn the speed to high and let the meringue whisk together thoroughly until it becomes white, shiny and comes down to room temperature for about 10 minutes.",
      "Take the meringue and fold it in thoroughly with the paste in the mixing bowl. You will need to mash it together a little too to break up the paste into the meringue. It should become a smooth, shiny and pretty lavender colored mixture. Scoop half of it into a pastry bag with a 1/2 inch opening. Hold the opening over the center of the first circle on your sheet tray template and gently squeeze until it is filled. If there is a little point on top don't worry, it will dissolve. Fill the first sheet this way, then repeat with the second half of meringue on the other sheet tray.",
      "Now this is the heart stopping but necessary part. Lift each filled sheet tray about 8 inches above the counter and let it drop onto the counter. This will get out all of the air bubbles to make a really smooth, shiny top. Let the trays sit out for 30-40 minutes to dry out and firm up a little. When the time is almost up, fit a rack in the center of the oven and preheat it to 350\u00b0F. Bake the first tray for 6 minutes, then rotate the tray to ensure even baking and let them bake for another 6-7 minutes. Take that tray out and let the cookies cool completely and bake the second tray in the same way. Let that tray cool completely too. You can even chill them in the refrigerator for a couple of hours to really set them and firm them up. It makes them easier to remove.",
      "While the cookies cool, make the easy filling. Simply stir the mascarpone and honey together thoroughly until it is smooth. Set it in the refrigerator until you are ready to form them. Assemble the macarons by spreading a heaping spoonful of the mascarpone honey filling on the flat side of one of the cookies. Then place another cookie of the same size on top and gently twist to make sure the filling spreads to the edge and the sandwich holds together. Chill them in the refrigerator in sealed containers until you are ready to serve them! Let them sit out for a few minutes before you serve them and enjoy."

Don't toss the bacon drippings. You should have about a 1/4 cup of drippings left in the pan if your bacon was fatty enough (*). Finely chop the onion and saute them (over medium heat) in the bacon drippings until onion is clear (it will brown up a little too from frying in the bacon fat). If you used very lean bacon (which I don't recommend) then you may have to add a tablespoon or so of oil. But the bacon fat is really what adds the flavor here.",
      "Now mix all the remaining ingredients together in a large bowl and add the onions (with any remaining bacon fat) and the crumbled bacon and pour the mixture into a 9x13 glass baking dish (or similar size casserole dish) and bake covered with foil, for about an hour.",

    "title": "irish bombay potatoes (the best curried potatoes in the world)",
    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "Heat oven to 200\u00b0C (390\u00b0F).",
      "You can peel the potatoes or leave them unpeeled. Quarter the potatoes and place in large bowl. Add salt, tomato paste, curry paste, curry powder, and oil. Give it all a good mix and make sure each potato is well covered.",
      "Layer the potatoes over a large oven tray and place in oven.",
      "After 15 minutes, remove from oven and (if using) add dried basil and garlic. Roughly flip potatoes and ensure the basil is mixed in. Cook for another 10-15 minutes-the potatoes should be easy to pierce with a fork. If using fresh basil and garlic, add them about 5 minutes before the end of cooking, once again making sure it is all mixed in.",
      "Serve (with malt vinegar if desired) as a side dish or with dips like yoghurt, hummus or creme fraiche.",
      "Alternate method:",
      "To get an even crispier yet still fluffy texture to the potatoes, follow the first steps of preparation as above. After cooking for 15 minutes, remove the potatoes from the oven. Add the dried basil and garlic (if using) Let cool for 5 minutes, then put them back in the oven for another 5 minutes. Remove again and let cool, followed by another 5 minutes of cooking. Repeat twice more, adding the fresh basil and garlic (if using) before the final 5 minutes of cooking. These Bombay potatoes are unbeatable.",
      "Notes:",
      "1. If you think the potatoes need it, add more oil while cooking. Don't let them get too crispy (or black).",
      "2. If the spices/paste/herbs start to burn on the baking tray, move the potatoes individually across to a new tray or new baking paper and continue cooking. It won't take long and the outcome is more than worth the effort."

At this point, a real test of patience begins. The idea is to cook the milk low and slow until all the moisture evaporates and you are left with just milk solids. Scrape the sides of the pan and keep stirring occasionally. The milk will start reducing in quantity and changing color from white to more off-whitish/creamish or pale yellow. As the milk starts to thicken, keep stirring until it starts to come together into a glob (for lack of a better word) or a sticky, almost semi-solid mass. It will leave the sides of the pan and come together. Your fresh khoya is ready. This process will take close to one hour or more. Let it cool and store in the refrigerator for 3-4 days or freeze.",

At this point, add ghee and start mixing. Keep stirring the ghee and flour mixture until flour is little brownish in color and fragrant, about 7-8 minutes. After the flour has turned golden brown in color, add khoya. If you are using store-bought khoya, it would be best to grate it with a box grater. Grating the khoya helps to mix it evenly in the flour mixture without having to break apart big lumps. Stir khoya in until it is completely incorporated, about 5 more minutes. Add cardamom, mix, and turn heat off.",
      "Let mixture cool slightly (you should be able to touch it without burning your hands) and then add sugar. Mix and give it a taste. Add a few tablespoons, up to 1/4 cup more, to achieve desired level of sweetness. Stir in nuts and make sure everything is evenly incorporated and there are no lumps. It is best done using your hands.",
      "If mixture is cool enough to handle, take about 1 1/2 tablespoon of mixture and start pressing and rolling it into a small ball. Put on a cookie sheet lined with parchment. You might have to keep at it, but the balls will start coming together. If you think the mixture is too crumbly and it is hard to roll it into balls, sprinkle a few drops of milk into it. For me, this mixture worked just fine and I did not have to add any milk. Repeat until all the mixture is used up.",
