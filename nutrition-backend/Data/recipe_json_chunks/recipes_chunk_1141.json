      "Wash, cut and dice (and remove seeds if using a seeded melon) melon into 1-inch chunks. Place diced watermelon in a blender or food processor.",
      "Cover and blend or process until smooth.",
      "It should reduce to approximately 2 cups of watermelon puree. That (2 cups after the blender) is the amount you will need for the recipe. Pour it into a large pot. Bring watermelon juice to a slow boil.",
      "Add the 3 Tablespoons of lemon juice to the pot.",
      "In a small bowl, mix the dry pectin with about 1/4 cup of sugar (or other sweetener). Keep this separate from the rest of the sugar. If you are not using sugar, you'll just have to stir more vigorously to prevent the pectin from clumping.",
      "Stir the pectin into the watermelon juice and put the mix in a big pot on the stove over medium to high heat (stir often enough to prevent burning).",
      "It should take about 5 to 10 minutes to get it to a full boil (the kind that can not be stirred away).",
      "When the berry-pectin mix has reached a full boil, add the rest of the sugar (or other sweetener). I recommend using some real sugar or honey, as jellies made with no added sugar, or just Splenda turn our rather flat tasting and runny.",
      "After adding the sugar or sugar/sweetener blend, then bring it back to a boil and boil hard for 1 minute. Depending upon which type of jam you're making (sugar, no-sugar, Splenda, mix of sugar and Splenda or fruit juice) you will need to use a different amount of sugar and type of pectin.",
      "I keep a metal tablespoon sitting in a glass of ice water, then take a half spoonful of the mix and let it cool to room temperature on the spoon. If it thickens up to the consistency I like, then I know the jam is ready. If not, I mix in a little more pectin (about 1/4 to 1/2 of another package) and bring it to a boil again for 1 minute.",
      "IF YOU DO NOT OWN A CANNER/PROCESSOR -- While melon is coming to a boil, place 4-5 jars in a shallow baking pan and pour water to the half way point of pan. Place over electric eye (large) and bring to a boil. Place caps in small saucepan and cover with water and bring to a boil.",
      "Fill jars to within 1/4-inch of the top, wipe any spilled jam off the top, seat the lid and tighten the ring around them. Continue to boil in pan for 10 minutes.",
      "Lift the jars out of the water and let them cool without touching or bumping them in a draft-free place (usually takes overnight) You can then remove the rings if you like. Once the jars are cool, you can check that they are sealed verifying that the lid has been sucked down. Just press in the center, gently, with your finger. If it pops up and down (often making a popping sound), it is not sealed. If you put the jar in the refrigerator right away, you can still use it. Some people replace the lid and reprocess the jar, then that's a bit iffy. If you heat the contents back up, re-jar them (with a new lid) and the full time in the canner, it's usually ok.",
      "Once cooled, they're ready to store. I find they last up to 12 months. But after about 6 to 8 months, they get darker in color and start to get runny. They still are safe to eat, but the flavor and texture aren't as good. So eat them in the first 6 months after you prepare them!"

      "You can also just dump the oil, carefully wipe out the skillet, and start each batch with fresh oil, but make sure that oil had heated to 375 degF (shimmering and almost smoking) before adding the next batch of veggies.",
      "If deep frying, heat oil to 375 degF as measured on a frying thermometer, and drop 6-8 pieces into the hot oil, less if this crowds them.",

      "Let oil reheat to 375OF before frying next batch.",
      "A neat trick to use if your deep fryer has a basket is to NOT put the veggies in the basket; put them directly in the oil, and after they have fried for 30-40 seconds, gently place the basket on top of them to hold them submerged-- no turning needed.",
      "Serve hot, just plain, or with ketchup, tartar sauce, lemon wedges, whatever sounds good to you.",

You can add the slices right into the pepper stew and let it stew together if it's not too dry. Other sausage variations like Debrecen are ideal, but the drier ones, like the Gyulai sausage are exceptionally delicious. Note: if the sausage is too dry - stew beforehand in 1/2 cup water in a shallow saucepan for 10-15 minutes before adding it to the peppers. (Add both stewing liquid and sausage to the peppers).",

    "directions": [
      "Prepare the chicken:Preheat the oven to 425\u00b0F (220\u00b0C). Take a large casserole pot and add your olive oil and butter.",
      "Add the chicken, leeks, carrots, celery, and thyme and cook slowly on the stove for 15 minutes. Turn the heat right up, add the flour, and keep stirring for a couple of minutes before adding the wine, a wineglass of water, and the milk. Season with a little salt and freshly ground black pepper, then cover with a tight-fitting lid and simmer very slowly on the stove for 30 to 40 minutes until the chicken is tender. Stir it every so often so it doesn't catch on the bottom of the pan. The sauce should be loose but quite thick. If it's a little too liquid, just continue to simmer it with the lid off until it thickens slightly. (At this point you can let it cool and keep it in the fridge for a couple of days if you want to - it can also be eaten as a stew.)",
      "Assemble the pie: Pour the chicken mixture into an appropriately sized pie dish. Squeeze the meat out of the sausage skins, roll it into little balls, brown them in a little oil and sprinkle them over the stew.",
      "Roll out your pastry to about 1/4 inch thick. Egg-wash the rim of the dish and drape over the pastry, using a knife to trim the edge of the dish. Egg-wash the top of the pastry to make it go golden while cooking, then pinch it to crimp it round the edges (there's no need to do this, but I like to as my mum always does it and it makes it look pretty). I use the back of a knife to lightly crisscross the top - this allows the pastry to go crisp and flaky. Cook the pie in the center of the oven for about 30 to 40 minutes, until golden on top. I like to serve this with corn off the cob and mashed potato."

      "Place your preferred meat into a large mixing bowl. In a separate bowl beat eggs until smooth. Add half measured seasoned bread crumbs and half of beaten eggs to meat and mix thoroughly. Add the remainder of all measured ingredients including the eggs and bread crumbs. You may need to mix everything with your hands to make sure that all ingredients are well incorporated into the meat. The consistency of the meat should be wet, not sticky or pasty. If the meat wants to stick to your hands while rolling a meatball then you should add another egg, one extra egg won't hurt the end result no matter the amount of meat being used.",
      "Once you have a wet consistency of meat cover and refrigerate for at least 3 hours(overnight is best).",
      "To prepare meatballs have a small bowl of lukewarm water handy to keep the meatballs from sticking to your hands while rolling. Scoop meat with a tablespoon to keep size consistent and timing for frying. When rolled into a ball the meat should be about the size of a golf ball. Fry meatballs in a 12 inch skillet in olive oil. Cook on medium heat for 2 minutes per side or until browned on both sides. Please note that the fry time is one quarter the time of being fully cooked since these meatballs finish cooking in a 2 hour tomato sauce. When all meatballs fried drop into your tomato sauce.",
      "Note: If you prefer you may bake the meatballs as well. Place on a lightly oiled cookie sheet in a preheated 350\u00b0F oven for 10 to 15 minutes or until nicely browned. Again the cook time is for meatballs that are halfway cooked since they again go into a tomato sauce for final cooking. Also ground turkey will cook faster than pork and or beef so be sure to test the doneness of the ground turkey. Any over cooking before dropping your meatballs into your sauce will result in dry over cooked meatballs."

    "title": "a quick and easy stove top recipe for boneless pork ribs, with s",
    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "For more than 60 plus years I have ate pork ribs and sauerkraut with mash potatoes on New Year's Day. The sauerkraut and pork always cooked for many hours whether by stove top or in the crock pot (8 to 12 hours on low) until the meat fell off the bones, and the bones were bleached white from the overcooking. At time of serving, the stove top or crock pot still contained quarts of fluid. As usual, we all thought the meat and kraut tasted great because this was the way it had always been. However, the meat was tough and dried out even though it was submerged in liquid. Now I know from some studying of cooking that all the nutrients had been boiled off. In addition, all the pork fat liquefied and now coated all the meat and sauerkraut you put on your plate. Once again we assumed this was normal. (This liquefied fat solidifies when cooled and is the thick whitish goo you remove from your pot before washing.).",
      "Since retiring and as a hobby I have been studying the science of cooking and discovered, years after the fact, that the USDA says fresh pork is safe to eat at an internal temperature of 145 degrees; a point where it still contains many of its nutrients. Based on this I came up with the following recipe.",
      "Remove the pork from the refrigerator about an hour prior to cooking. This time I used 2.01 lbs. of pork loin country style boneless ribs.",
      "Pat the meat dry on both sides and place on a cutting board.",
      "Coat both sides of the meat with the dry rub of your choosing and rub in with your fingers. I use a pre-packaged rub that you can normally purchase for less than a dollar. This way you do not have to deal with mixing up a batch of rub from multiple spice jars.",
      "If it is a slab of a two rib set cut them apart and also complete the partial cut between each rib.",
      "Turn each rib on its side and push them together on the cutting board so they hold each other up.",
      "Apply the dry rub to this side, then flip over and do the opposite side. Do not feel obligated to use the entire package of rub. Some of these rubs can be quite potent, so only use the amount you and your family are comfortable with.",
      "Depending upon your local room temperature let the meat sit out for 30 to 45 minutes to let the spices absorb into the meat. Do not let the meat sit out very long if your room is already warm. As an alternative, you may also place the meat back into the refrigerator for a little while.",
      "While this is going on pour your 1-qt. jar of sauerkraut (un-drained) into at least a 2-qt pan. If you do not care for the tartness of sauerkraut then drain and rinse it before placing in the 2-qt pan. Cover the kraut completely with water and simmer. On a gas stove the flame should be barely visible at the burner. Cook it for about 45 minutes; if you like it to be very soft. Check the kraut frequently to insure it does not boil dry.",
      "To cook the pork, pre-heat a large skillet with high sides that has a non-stick coating and also a lid. Heat the skillet with lid on for about five minutes over a medium heat. DO NOT ADD ANY COOKING OR OLIVE OIL TO THE SKILLET. You will normally smell the skillet when it gets very hot. Now it is ready.",
      "Place all the ribs into the skillet and rapidly brown all four sides; approximately five to ten seconds each side. Then immediately turn down the heat until the flame is barely visible at burner level and cover the skillet. Note, since there is no oil in the skillet when you are browning the pork it will not splash grease all over your stove top and the meat will not stick due to the non-stick coating.",
      "The meat should reach 140 to 145 degrees in ten to fifteen minutes. Monitor the meat closely every five to eight minutes using a digital thermometer. Turn off the heat when the temperature reaches 140 degrees; do not let the meat go past 145 degrees. Even though the heat is off the meat will continue to cook and rise in temperature. While the meat is resting make a package of your favorite instant potatoes which take about five minutes. For this meal I used a package seasoned with roasted garlic. You may also make mashed potatoes from scratch just start them earlier in order that the meat, kraut, and potatoes are all done at the same time. Now just serve, enjoy, and wait for the compliments."
