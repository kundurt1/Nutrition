Discard the seeds. Add the ground beef to the skillet and cook, breaking up the meat with a wooden spoon, until no pink remains, about 3 minutes. Add the garlic, onion and bell pepper and cook over moderate heat until the onion is softened, about 5 minutes. Add the tomato, tomato paste and chicken stock and simmer over moderate heat until the liquid has nearly evaporated, about 3 minutes. Stir in the cilantro and season with salt and pepper. Let cool.",

Reroll the dough scraps and stamp out additional rounds if possible. Brush the excess flour off the rounds. Working with 1 round at a time and keeping the rest covered with plastic wrap, form the empanadas: Spoon 2 teaspoons of the filling on one side of the dough round. Fold the dough over to enclose the filling and crimp the edges with a fork to seal. Cover with plastic wrap while you form the remaining empanadas.",

      "Notes: I love a combination of dried fruit with this dish. I have used dried apricots, pears, cherries, raisins, blueberries, goji berries, currents and dates (not all at once, but hey why not?). Raisins are by far the easiest as they are a staple in many kitchens (and they're great in this dish).",
      "Notes (for serving an adult and a young child): Divide the dry couscous between two bowls: 1/2 cup and 1/4 cup. Make sure to chop the dried fruit into bite-sized pieces. When dividing the water between the bowls, add 5-oz boiling water to the adult portion and 3-oz to the child portion (using a measuring cup makes this easy). Skip the nuts if your child hasn't been introduced to them yet or if the pieces are large enough to present a choking hazard. Also, make sure your child has gotten an OK from the doctor to eat honey (typically given at 1 year)."

They may just take a bit longer to cook. Get your pan on the burner and pre-heat it to medium-ish. I start closer to medium low, then move it to medium when I'm there cooking the eggs.",
      "Now, the bacon. Ever used a microwave for your bacon? It's too easy, trust me. Take 2-3 slices and place them evenly on a paper towel. Cover with another piece of towel and get them on a microwave safe plate. Times may vary for this, but my oven is 1000 watts and the bacon gets nice and crispy how I like it in two minutes, thirty seconds. Adjust according to yours.",
      "Bread. Simple. Just place two slices in the toaster ready to go.",
      "Cooking: You've got your eggs next to the stove and your pan on and heated, your bacon is in the microwave, and the bread is standing by in the toaster.",
      "Set the microwave to 2:30 and hit start, press down the plunger on the toaster, put some butter in the pan to melt, and break the eggs into the pan. Don't worry about the toast or bacon getting done early, as they will keep warm from residual heat in their respective cooking implements. We're going to concentrate on the eggs.",
      "You've cracked them in there and they're beginning to turn white. At this point, I salt them and crack some liberal pepper over them. To taste, of course.",
      "Next, you'll see a sort of raised ring, about a half inch to inch around the yolk, of white. I constantly take the corner of my spatula and break through this to the cooking surface. What that does is expose more and more white to the heat and I like this part cooked and not runny, but the yolk really runny. Once this has set up, you're basically done. Shake the pan and look to see if you have any jiggly, clear bits. No? Put the eggs on a plate.",
      "Careful getting the bacon out of the microwave and towels. HOT. Put them on the plate as well.",

      "2. In a large bowl, combine the yeast mixture, milk mixture, eggs and 1 1/2 cup flour; stir well to combine. Stir in the remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time, beating well after each addition. When the dough has pulled together, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes.",
      "3. Lightly oil a large bowl, place the dough in the bowl and turn to coat with oil. Cover with a damp cloth and let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.",
      "4. While dough is rising, melt 3/4 cup butter in a small saucepan over medium heat. Stir in 3/4 cup brown sugar, whisking until smooth. Pour into greased 9x13 inch baking pan. Sprinkle bottom of pan with 1/2 cup pecans; set aside. Melt remaining butter; set aside. Combine remaining 3/4 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup pecans, and cinnamon; set aside.",
      "5. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface, roll into an 18x14 inch rectangle. Brush with 2 tablespoons melted butter, leaving 1/2 inch border uncovered; sprinkle with brown sugar cinnamon mixture. Starting at long side, tightly roll up, pinching seam to seal. Brush with remaining 2 tablespoons butter. With serrated knife, cut into 15 pieces; place cut side down, in prepared pan. Cover and let rise for 1 hour or until doubled in volume. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 375*F.(190*C.).",
      "6. Bake in preheated oven for 25 to 30 minutes, until golden brown. Let cool in pan for 3 minutes, then invert onto serving platter. Scrape remaining filling from the pan onto the rolls.",
      "My Update Note: Here is how we rolled tight buns. Make sure you roll your dough out to 1/4\". Apply butter evenly, then sugar/cinnamon mixture. Holding the rolling pin, gently roll over the sugar/cinnamon mixture. At the beginning of the roll only 1/2\" of dough and pinch down. Now you must begin rolling from each corner, middle, working your way back and forth. Curve your corners toward the center to avoid too much overlap (exess) IMPT: after about 2-3 rolls, carefully lift up each portion and pull away from you, this will \"tuck\" in the dough, be careful not to tear the dough. A lot to remember, but after you get the hang of it, it's like second nature and you will have picture perfect cinnamon rolls and sticky buns.",
      "Here's a trick for cutting the rolls without mashing the dough: take a piece of thread, slide it under the roll, cross the thread and pull quickly. It works like magic, and you don't have a sticky knife to clean up afterwards!",
      "Just a tip: the longer you let them rise, the fluffier and better they taste!",
      "I didn't add the pecans to the brown sugar/cinnamon mixture that went inside the rolls. I would suggest not melting the butter that you spread on the inside before you roll it up. If you just spread on a thin layer of softened butter you should end up with a more ooey-gooey feel because you'll have more butter on the inside to melt, which will make the caramel more gooey. When you use the melted butter you don't get a lot of butter on the inside & I found this tended to give me a dryer--but still good--caramel roll. I will try again, but next time I won't melt my butter. Have made a couple more times & it definitely works better not to melt the butter for the inside and then I double the caramel for the bottom. But does need some adjustments.",
      "I did used a 9 X 13 baking pan and I made a little extra filling. In addition I made some simple white icing and I have to say this is one of the best sticky buns I have ever had; and I've had quite a lot over the years. I never thought I'd make a world class sticky bun but I was wrong. I would highly suggest taking extra time and being extra careful when reading the directions. In addition, I allowed my first rise to go for approximately 2 hours and it came out perfect. If you want great sticky buns that will knock the socks off your friends and family, this is it! Happy Holidays.!"

      "1. In a slow cooker, combine the meat, soup, onion, Worcestershire sauce and water.",
      "2. Cook on Low setting for 8 hours, or on High setting for about 5 hours. Stir in cream cheese just before serving.",
      "My Note: (1) add salt, pepper, and garlic, (2) double the sauce but keep the cream cheese and worcestershire the same, (3) use Golden Mushroom, not Cream of Mushroom or don't make this at all, (4) reduce the cooking time to about 5-6 hours on low, (5) add a \"dollup\" of sour cream when you add the cream cheese to get an extra \"tang\", (6) add a bullion cube, (7) add a half packet of onion soup mix, (8) serve over egg noodles, (9) add sauteed mushrooms about 1/2 an hour before serving. I know this isn't true to the original recipe, but I trusted others and I think it helped. Great slow-cooker recipe. I froze the leftovers (egg noodles and all) in my Seal-a-Meal and then just boiled the bag to reheat. It was great the second time around!",
      "Make sure you do 5 things, however: 1. Use \"Condensed Golden Mushroom\" soup. The regular Cream of Mushroom doesn't have the larger pieces of mushrooms. 2. Substitute 1/4 cup beef broth for 1/4 water. 3. Use 4 oz. sour cream instead of cream cheese. 4. Add 1/2 t. pepper for a tiny little (but necessary) kick. 4. Just before adding the sour cream, mix 1 T. corn starch with 2 T. cold water, then add this mixture to stroganoff. This gives it the necessary extra thickness. I do like to play, so I did.",
      "**UPDATE: I am going to make this short and sweet. The recipe that is posted originally is really only a 1 star meal to me. After all the adjustments, substitutions, etc . its 5 star fabulous. I have taken all the suggestions and advice from all the reviews from the Family and created this: INGREDIENTS 2 pound cubed beef stew meat or chuck roast 2 (10.75 ounce) can condensed golden mushroom soup 3/4 cup chopped onion 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce 1/4 cup water (more if needed) 1/4 cup low sodium beef stock (more if needed) 1/3 cup sour cream 2 ounces cream cheese (reduced fat works well) 1/2 pack French onion soup mix Salt and pepper, to taste 3 cloves garlic, minced 8oz. mushrooms, sliced Pat of butter DIRECTIONS 1. In slow cooker, combine meat, mushroom soup, chopped onions, minced garlic, Worcestershire, dry soup mix, pepper, stock and water. 2. Cook on low setting for 5-6 hours. 3. During cooking time, saute the mushrooms in butter about 4 minutes 4. Put sauteed mushrooms in slow cooker last 30 minutes of cooking time 5. Check sauce if it needs salt or extra pepper. 6. Best served over buttered egg noodles. I think this came out fantastic. But again, its all about personal opinions and tastes. Let me know how this works out for you."

    "ingredients": [],

      "Seriously, read this thoroughly first. Cooking planks is a fire hazard if handled carelessly. Your home is not worth the best salmon you'll ever have. Almost, though. Also important, farm raised salmon has been consistently found to be the MOST TOXIC meat produced for consumption. Don't trust me, Google it! This makes preserving wild salmon runs that much more important.",
      "An hour and a half prior to cooking soak your plank in water for at least 45 minutes. hot water's best. This is important to keep it from catching fire in the BBQ.",
      "After soaked, place rinsed salmon on plank skin down. No flesh should be hanging off the edges, this makes picking a fillet's size really important because it is easier to pick the size of fillet than find or cut a plank to fit the fish. I use planks packaged and marked for this. Don't waste your time with cedar BBQ envelopes/pockets. These products are crap.",
      "Again, with the skin down, spread your mustard over the pink flesh to cover but not to smother.",
      "Sprinkle paprika or cayenne pepper on fillet to your taste preference.",
      "Let rest until cooking time. Meanwhile, prepare BBQ to a high heat and get together the tools/instruments you are going to use to remove the burnt plank from the grill. Keep these close by and ready. Also, consider where are you going to let the plank with an underside covered in red hot embers rest? Think this through thoroughly!",
      "You're going to lay the plank directly on the grill to cook the fish. As the damp wood starts to burn it will smoke the fish. It creates a lot of smoke, so BBQ placement might have to be evaluated.",
      "When your grill is ready place planked fish on grill and cover. Vent the BBQ medium, you want to retain as much smoke around the fish, but not suffocate your heat source. Cooking takes about 10 to 20 minutes depending on the thickness of your fillet. If you know how to test steak for rareness, the fillet should feel medium. Remember to let the meat rest and allow for it to finish cooking off the grill, so pulling it a little early is a good thing.",
      "Now, removing the plank is serious business! ITS UNDERSIDE WILL BE BURNING RED HOT AND WILL CATCH OTHER WOOD ON FIRE IF YOU LET THEM STAY IN CONTACT! I use a heavy duty spatula to support one end and a strong pair of cooking tongs that allow me to really grip the plank tightly for the other end. Your goal is to find something that will hold the plank so tightly WITHOUT DAMAGING FISH that you can hold it with one hand if necessary, and it will likely be necessary. Let the meat rest 5 minutes before serving. I put mine on the hot-plate burner cover of my gas grill. Its metal, making it safe.",
      "Alternatively, you do not need to use mustard for a good plank salmon. It's better with it, even on premium king fillets. It just is. And, cedar planks are likely easier to find. I have used a 1X9X2' of cedar I bought at a local hardware store to cook this recipe and it worked beautifully. the guys at the store assured me that the processing of the wood did not include toxic chemicals."
