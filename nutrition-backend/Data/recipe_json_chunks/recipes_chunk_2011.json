      "You can do this also, if youve got a gas stove, just by holding them with a long fork over the burner, but it can get tiresome to say the least.",
      "When the peppers are black and charred, remove them (trying not to burn yourself) to a large bowl and cover immediately with plastic wrap.",

      "Leftovers can be stuffed into pita breads, as with the lamb, but the sweet, salty mix is also lovely as a sauce for pasta (better without the almonds, though Id bet theyd all be picked off anyway by the time you got to leftover stage).",
