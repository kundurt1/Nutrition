Maybe 25 % fat, ( I recommend 1 lb of ground venison, and 1/2 lb of deer sausage for fat content), otherwise your results will be poor. I don't know about some of the other game meat some are using. Please consult an expert. The recipe is delicious as it stands! Enjoy! Nita Holleman."

      "Place slices on their sides back on the baking sheets. Place in the still-warm oven with the temperature off and the door closed for 30 to 60 minutes. The longer they stay in the oven, the harder they will become. Remove from oven and cool completely before storing in an air-tight container, preferably a metal tin, which helps keep them crisp. Stored properly, biscotti will last up to a month."

      "Before you start: The secret to this desert is to have your ingredients measured and ready. It makes the process move along quickly. Prepare your favorite baked pastry shell. Cool on wire rack. Separate the egg yolks from the whites. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.",
      "Make custard: In a medium saucepan over medium heat, bring 2-1/2 cup of the milk almost to simmering (watch closely so milk doesn't boil). Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, with a 12-inch or larger balloon whisk, stir remaining 1/2 cup milk into the 3 egg yolks. In a second bowl, combine 1 cup sugar, the flour, cocoa powder and 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt; whisk in egg egg yolk mixture until smooth. Gradually whisk in hot milk; return the mixture to saucepan.",
      "Bring to boiling: Over medium-high heat, cook and stir mixture until it comes to a full boil. You want large bubbles from the middle, and while you're whisking, be sure to get the whisk into the corners and weep the bottom so you won't have to worry about scorching -- which would require starting over! Boil for 30 seconds and remove from heat.",
      "Fill pie shell: Whisk in chocolate and butter until melted and smooth. Stir in 2 teaspoons vanilla. Strain mixture through a sieve, pushing it through with a spatula as needed. There is a good chance there will be tiny pieces of cooked egg in your custard. Straining them out is a small, easy step that makes a big difference.",
      "Prepare egg whites: Wash both bowl and whisk. Dry them with a clean towel. Any grease is going to give you trouble in a big way. Set whites - in bowl - over a bowl of hot (110 degrees F) water. You'll get more volume. Five minutes should do it. Keeping your elbow firmly against your side, whisk rapidly until white begin to mound. Move only your wrist. Whisk in superfine sugar, 2 tablespoons at a time, sprinkling the sugar over the whole bowl. Continue to whisk until whites are moist, glossy and do not slide when bowl is inverted. Plan on 7 or 8 minutes the first few time you try this. Tips of the whites should curl over slightly when whisk is lifted from the bowl.",
      "Cover the pie with the meringue: Turn meringue out all at once on top of hot pie filling. With spatula, spread meringue from center to edges, making sure meringue seals to crust all the way around. Bake 15 minutes at 350 degrees or until top is golden. Ovens vary, and if you overbake, the meringue can weep.",
      "Cool on wire rack for one hour. Refrigerate at least two hours before serving. Store leftovers (as IF!) in the refrigerator.",
      "Note: If you don't want to whip the egg whites by hand, you can use an electric mixer on medium-high speed. :-)."

For fluffier pancakes, use only 2 cups of liquid, and use slightly lower heat so the pancakes cook slower and the inside has time to cook by the time the outside is done. TIP: If the outside is done before the inside is cooked, turn the heat down -- even way down, and cook them more slowly. And don't flip until there are bubbles on the top."

      "Dough should be soft yet firm enough to handle. Knead on floured board until elastic and smooth. Avoid too much flour. Turn dough into well oiled bowl. Let rise for 1-1/2 hours.",
      "Press dough down and divide into workable size. Roll dough out into a rectangle. Cover with melted butter. Layer with a generous thick layer* of brown sugar. Sprinkle on cinnamon* as desired. If you like raisins, layer on a layer of raisins. Roll up jellyroll fashion.",
      "Using a scissors or a piece of string, cut off slices about 1 to 1-1/2 inches thick. Place slices in an 8 or 9 inch round greased cake pan. Place one slice in the middle and other slices around it. Press rolls down to even out and fill pan. Let rise until rolls fill the pan generously -- about another hour.",

      "Spread over warm rolls as soon as they are placed on a plate to let the frosting melt and run into the rolls.",
      "My Notes: I was pretty generous with both the brown sugar and cinnamon. I ended up with about a 1/2 inch layer of brown sugar completely covered with cinnamon.",
      "I made a few changes to the recipe for personal preference: I used 3/4 Silk almond milk and 1/4 sweetened condensed milk (I still added the 1/3 cup white sugar). I used 4 cups of bread flour and I kneaded the dough for about 45 mins by hand. I let the dough rise in the sunlight with plastic wrap tightly covering the bowl. This extra heat helped the dough rise much faster. Then I punched it down and prepared the rolls by using 1/2 stick of room temp butter and smeared it over the dough by hand. I pat down the brown sugar / cinnamon mix and then began to roll it tightly. I placed the cut up rolls into a baking dish and placed it in the sunlight for an hour to let rise (double / triple in size). Baked in the oven for 20 mins at 350*F and as soon as they came out, I brushed melted butter on top. I also used store bought Pillsbury cream cheese icing and melted it in the microwave before putting it on top of the baked rolls. This recipe is well worth the time and effort required to make this dessert. You'll be glad you did.",
      "I am a seasoned baker and have been making Cinnamon Rolls for at least 25 years. Thought I had a great recipe for my bread machine (zojurushi) but it always was a little on the light and dry side. I have been looking for a dense gooey recipe where the dough has some substance to it.found it! These were wonderful! I made them in the bread machine and it took just 4 cups of flour.as a matter of fact I added an extra 1/4 cup scalded milk as it seemed a little stiff to me once it started mixing. Rolled them out and cut into 8 large rolls.Let rise again. Baked in a 9x13 for 26 minutes @ 350*F. Frosted lightly immediately and then a little heavier when they cooled off with cream cheese frosting.They were gone before dinner! Dangerously good warm or cold.",
      "With one batch I added apples, raisins, and nuts -- the other batch I did plain with just the brown sugar. I also did a cream cheese frosting for both batches instead of the plain sugar frosting suggested. I think this has to be the easiest, tastiest recipe for cinnamon rolls I have ever had the pleasure of baking!"

Its important that you get the mozzarella in the brine because it makes the pizza fresher tasting. I mix it with the pre-shredded 2% milk mozzarella because it reduces calories & shredding time. Also make sure to get the freshest best looking tomatoes you can find -- this will really make the pizza much better. This pizza is best in the summer when produce is freshest!"

      "Stir the sizzling onion. Add the chicken. Keep the heat high, and although there won't be space for all the pieces to lie flat, no matter. Let the pieces below fry until they start browning, then stir the whole lot around with a wooden spoon with a long handle. Let bottom pieces brown -- but not every piece needs to be fried first. This frying is just to get extra flavour.",
      "In the meantime you have opened the tin of tomatoes. Hopefully it's of good quality, solid, with thick liquid -- not just a few tomato bits and thin juice. (If it's the latter -- add a few splotches of ketchup to the pot).",

      "Turn heat to low, put lid on, make sure nothing burns and the stew bubbles gently. Now walk away for 20 minutes and do something else, or put the rice on to cook.",
      "Return to the stew, take off the lid, and add the potatoes, mushrooms, Worcestershire sauce, garlic and pepper sauce or hot pepper flakes -- not too much. You want a bite, not Jaws.",
      "Add more salt at this stage, and taste. There should by now be a satisfactory sort of sauce in the pot. If you think a flavour is missing, add it, it's your stew.",
      "Put the lid back on, and simmer for another 15 minutes or so, until the potatoes are cooked through.",
      "With a large spoon remove the entire saucy stew to an oven dish. If you have too much sauce, keep the rest, cool and refrigerate, and use as a soup base -- it's delicious and can't go to waste. If you don't have enough sauce it's your own fault, as you probably let the liquid all cook away.",

      "To make the meatballs: Place the bread and milk in a medium bowl and let soak for 5 minutes.",
      "Heat a 7- to 8-quart Dutch oven over medium heat, and when it is hot, add the olive oil. Add the onion and cook until soft and golden, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove the pot from the heat and set aside.",
      "Place the veal, beef, pork, and sausage in a large bowl and, using your hands, mix well. Add the oregano, cheeses, eggs, parsley, and bread one at a time, mixing until thoroughly combined after each addition. Add the onion and mix until very well combined. Add the salt and pepper. Set aside.",
      "To make the sauce: Heat a 10-quart casserole over medium heat, and when it is hot, add the olive oil. Add the onion and garlic and cook until wilted. Add the tomato paste and stir for 1 minute. Add the wine, tomatoes, 1 teaspoon of salt, and red pepper flakes and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and simmer gently for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. Season with salt and red pepper flakes to taste if necessary.",
      "While the tomato sauce is cooking, form the meatballs: Take a piece of meat the size of a golf ball and roll it between the palms into a ball. Add it to the sauce, and repeat with the remaining meatballs.",
      "Return the sauce to a simmer and simmer gently until the meatballs are cooked through, about 11/2 hours. Be sure to cook the meatballs at a very gentle simmer; if the sauce boils, the fat will separate from the meat and they will dry out. When you think they are done, remove one from the pot and cut into it with a paring knife. If it is still pink in the middle, continue to cook until done, another 10 to 15 minutes.",
      "Just prior to serving, fill a 10-quart stockpot with 7 quarts (6.5 liters) of water and bring to a boil. Add the 2 tablespoons of salt and spaghetti and cook until al dente. Drain, add to the pan with the meatballs and sauce, and carefully toss to coat. Serve immediately.",
      "Tips: To see if you've added enough salt and pepper to the meatball mixture, before shaping the meatballs, bring a small pot of water to a boil. Pinch off a grape-sized piece of meatball mixture, roll it into a ball, and drop it in the pot. When it is cooked through, in about 2 minutes, taste it and adjust the seasoning before rolling all of your meatballs.",
      "To roll nice round meatballs without having the meat stick to your hands, moisten your hands with cold water before you start, and then again as necessary.",
      "Wine: This calls for a solid but not murderously expensive Chianti. No need to buy a Riserva; just don't buy anything in a straw-covered bottle. If an American wine is in order, try a good Zinfandel from Ridge Vineyards."
