      "After dough is ready, preheat oven to 450 degrees F. Place your Dutch oven, uncovered, into the preheated oven for 30 minutes.",
      "While your Dutch oven preheats, turn dough onto a well-floured surface. With floured hands, form the dough into a ball. Cover dough loosely with plastic wrap and let rest.",
      "After the 30 minutes are up, carefully remove Dutch oven. With floured hands, place the bread dough into it. (You can put a piece of parchment under the dough if your Dutch oven isn't enamel coated.)",

      "Carefully remove bread to a cutting board and slice with a bread knife.\n\nEnjoy!",
      "Uncovered baking time depends on your oven. In my oven, the bread only needs 7 minutes uncovered until crusty and golden brown, but this can vary. Just keep an eye on it!\n\nPreheating your Dutch oven to 450 degrees F will not damage it, or the knob on top.\n\nI've let this dough rise anywhere between 8-24 hours and it has baked up beautifully. Just make sure it has risen and appears to \"bubble\" to the surface.\n\nThere's no need to grease the Dutch oven/baking dish/pot. My bread has never stuck to the pot. If you are concerned though, put a piece of parchment paper under your dough before placing into your pot.\n\nI do not recommend using whole wheat flour or white whole wheat flour in this recipe. The resulting bread will be very dense, and not as fluffy and delicious.\n\nI used a 5.5 quart enameled cast iron Le Creuset pot, but you can use any large oven-safe dish and cover. All of these also work: a baking dish covered with aluminum foil, crockpot insert, stainless steel pot with a lid, pizza stone with an oven-safe bowl to cover the bread, and old cast iron Dutch oven.\n\nAdd any mix-ins you like - herbs, spices, dried fruit, chopped nuts and cheese all work well. I recommend adding them into the initial flour-yeast mixture to avoid over-working the mix-ins into the dough. The less you \"work\" it, the more you're encouraging soft, fluffy air pockets to form!"

      "Prepare the crust:\nStir together the water, yeast and the sugar. Let rest until the yeast blooms, about 7 minutes.\nPlace 3 cups of the flour and the salt in a mixing bowl. Add the yeast mixture and the olive oil and stir together to form a sticky dough. Place ball on a clean countertop or a large cutting board and knead, adding the remaining flour a little at a time until the dough becomes a smooth, elastic ball, about 5-8 minutes. If you prefer to use an electric mixer, combine the ingredients with the paddle attachment and then change to the dough hook. Add the flour a little at a time until the dough is smooth and comes away from the sides of the bowl, about 2-4 minutes. Turn the dough into a lightly greased bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Let rise for 30- 40 minutes in a draft free spot to double in bulk.",
      "Prepare the Pizza top:\nWhile the crust is rising, begin making the topping for the pizza. Season the chicken tenders with salt and pepper and then dust them with 2 tablespoons of flour. Put enough olive oil just to coat the bottom of the pan over medium high heat. Cook the chicken in the pan for about 4 minutes per side. Remove from the pan and set aside. Melt the butter in a sauce pan then add 2 tablespoons of flour to the pan and cook 1 minute. Stir in the milk and whisk until the milk thickens and is slightly bubbly. Turn off the heat and stir in the creamy jack cheese. Let sit while you slice up the tomato thinly. Then pull or cut your cooled chicken into bite size pieces. When your crust has risen (about double in size), place it on a lightly floured very large board or on a clean counter top. Punch it down and then begin to roll it out. Being Sicilian, I like a thick crust for a pizza with sauce on it, so I used the whole ball of dough. If you like a thinner crust pizza, I suggest you cut the dough in half and freeze half for later. I use a rolling pin and then stretch it with my hands. Shape the crust however you feel most comfortable. Put your crust on a pizza pan or a baking sheet. Push down on it with your fingertips so you have small indents in the crust and then drizzle with olive oil.",
      "Melt 2 tablespoons of butter in a small bowl and stir in the hot sauce, and then pour the hot sauce mixture over the prepared pizza dough. Put the pizza in the oven for 5 minutes to prebake the crust slightly. Remove from oven and spread the pizza with the cheese sauce. Depending on how big you stretched your crust will depend on how much of the cheese sauce you use. Make sure you put enough on to cover the pizza and then add extra to make it saucy. Then add the slices of tomato, the chicken, the crumbled blue cheese and then the mozzarella to the pizza. Drizzle again with a small amount of olive oil over the top, salt and pepper as desired. Place the pizza in the oven and cook approximately 9 - 14 minutes depending on your oven. You want the top to be bubbly and slightly golden. As soon as the pizza comes out of the oven sprinkle it with the celery leaves. Serve while cheese is gooey, hot and Mangialicious!",

Pour through a strainer into the prepared cake pan. Place the pan inside a large roasting pan and pour very hot tap water into the pan so that it comes halfway up the sides of the cake pan. Bake for about 1 to 1 1/4 hours, or until the center is slightly jiggly but not wavy. Cool to room",

The caramel sauce will run out around the edges of the platter. Garnish the top of the flan with violets or other edible flowers."

Rub the flesh with olive oil and place cut side down on a heavy cookie sheet. Roast for 30-40 minutes, until fully soft. While the squash is roasting, cut up the onion or shallot and sautee in olive oil or butter until translucent, stir in the crushed dried sage.

Start by pouring the flour onto the tray, gathering it into a pile, adding the salt, and forming a well in the middle of the flour. Crack the eggs into the well.",

Use the heel of your hand to push the dough away from you, then fold the flap back towards you and give it a quarter turn. Press down on another section of the dough and do the same thing. The dough will be stiff-textured (much more so than bread dough) and hard to work with. Knead it for 10 minutes (this is where the sweating comes in) or until the dough is smooth.",

It may not sound important but you must not skip this step -- it's crucial! By this point, YOU will also probably need a little rest, as well as a chance to clean up a bit to get ready for the next step.",

Then begin to feed the dough through on successively narrower settings until you've reached your desired thickness (for ravioli, this will probably be the machine's smallest setting since you don't want the pasta to be too thick.) The dough will get quite long and ribbon-like during this process. You may find that you need an extra set of hands to either \"catch\" the dough or to turn the crank while you catch it (though you can also do this by yourself, it's just a bit trickier.) Don't freak out if the edges are rough or torn or if the dough is not perfect (it probably won't be). You ca",

You may also need to cut it into two or more pieces in order to fit it on a cookie sheet or towel at this point -- just make sure to match them up in size when you're making those cuts since you will very shortly be using one as the top of your ravioli and one as the bottom.",

Lay two roughly equal-sized ribbons of rolled pasta dough on the sheet length-wise. If one is larger, make that one the bottom sheet.",
      "Using the spoon, place a dollop of filling at equally-spaced intervals along the bottom ribbon of dough. If the ribbon is tall enough, you should be able to fit two rows of filling on it, if not, just go for one. Be careful not to add too much filling or to place the dollops too close to each other or too close to the edge of the ribbon of dough since you will need adequate space to seal each one and then cut it apart from the others.",
      "Once your drops of filling are in place, dip either your finger or a pastry brush (I used my finger) into the bowl of water and wet a grid pattern around each dollop of filling. It is essential to wet the dough thoroughly (though you don't want puddles of water or to make it soggy) around each drop of filling as this is what will make the seal between the bottom and top pieces of dough. An incomplete seal will make a ravioli that is much more likely to explode in the pot while cooking.",
      "Once you've finished moistening the bottom ribbon of dough, lift the top piece of dough and position it over the bottom, taking care to match them up as well as you can. Lay the top ribbon of dough carefully over the bottom one, gently pressing each mound of filling with your fingers to push the air out of each pillow before pressing the top strip of dough to the wetted area of the bottom strip to make the seal. Air in the pocket will also cause the ravioli to explode while cooking so you want to avoid that as much as possible (though some casualties are inevitable.)",
      "I think this part is the most fun of all! Using your ravioli cutter (you can also use a regular paring knife, the only difference is that the cutter will make those trademark fluted ravioli edges), cut carefully down the middle of each row in both directions to separate them. Be sure to leave equal room on each side and avoid cutting too close to the filling. Place the cut ravioli on another cookie tray that is lightly dusted with semolina so that they do not stick. You can also stack them in layers on pieces of lightly floured parchment paper if you have too many to lay out on the cookie sheets. Ravioli freeze well so I strongly suggest making enough to freeze as this is a pretty time-consuming process and it's nice to have something more than one meal's worth of fo",
      "When you're ready to cook the ravioli, boil a large pot of salted water and drop them in, cooking for just 5 or so minutes (remember, they are fresh so they will cook very quickly!) Meanwhile, melt a hunk of butter in a frying pan, add a handful of whole fresh sage leaves (washed and dried) and some pinenuts and sautee for 1-2 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the cooked ravioli directly from the pot of boiling water to the frying pan and toss to coat. Sprinkle with sea salt and freshly ground black pepper and top with fresh parmesan."

Using the foil to form the \"bowl\", work with it until it resembles a bowl and the edges are all up and cupped over, leaving room to pour everything inside. I recommend doing this on a baking sheet, so you don't have to transfer it once all the goodness is inside. I made the mistake of doing that the first time and I was left with a huge mess.",

In a separate bowl combine all your liquid ingredients and then distribute evenly between both pouches. Fold up your pouches so that a tiny opening is left to allow a bit of steam to escape.",
