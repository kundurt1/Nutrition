Before cooking/prep day, I would prepare the tomato sauce and sausage/spinach filling mixture and chill (I would prepare the tomato sauce anyway to serve as a pasta sauce--I could literally drink the stuff!). Make the bechamel sauce the day of your big session. Fill the tubes and prep the pans. Cook 45 minutes (Covered!), wrap in foil and freeze. On \"eating day,\" cook at 375 until tubes are al dente (they probably already will be) and bubbly and cheese is melted. I would keep it covered for most of the cooking time. This is a very very rich recipe, so I would serve with a salad of bitter greens tossed in a sharp vinaigrette. It says it serves 8, but, as I said, the sauces are so rich that I can't really eat more than one tube, so I would say it serves 14."

      "FOR THE MEAT SAUCE:",
      "Pour the oil into a deep large pan and heat it slightly. Crumble the minced beef into the oil together with the onion and garlic. Brown everything well, stirring constantly so the beef does not clump. Pour in the wine and allow everything to boil until the wine evaporates. Add the fresh tomato, oregano, bay leaf, salt and pepper and stir regularly while waiting for the tomato to soften well. Pour in the tomato juice, stir everything and allow it to cook and thicken. Finally, pour in the water and, over a medium flame, allow the sauce to cook until the beef is tender and the liquids have evaporated by at least 2/3 and the sauce is thick.",
      "WHILE THE MEAT SAUCE IS COOKING PREPARE THE VEGETABLES:",
      "Cut the eggplants into medium slices and soak them in salted water for 1 hour before your commence your sauce so everything will be more conveniently timed. This soaking removes the bitterness in the eggplant skins and also helps them not to absorb so much oil while frying. Remove the eggplants from the eater, strain them well and then dry them on a kitchen towel to absorb any excess water. Fry the potato slices and then strain them on kitchen paper. Oil your moussaka plan with the tablespoons of olive oil and created a layer with the fried potatoes taking care not to leave any gaps. Fry the eggplants and again strain them on kitchen paper and place then in a layer on top of the sliced potatoes. Sprinkle some salt, pepper and 1 tablespoon of the grated cheese on the eggplant layer.",
      "Strain the meat sauce of any excess oil (otherwise your moussaka will be too greasy) and then pour it evenly on top of the eggplant. Sprinkle the sauce with the 2nd tablespoon of grated cheese and then prepare your Bechamel Cream.",
      "FOR THE BECHAMEL CREAM:",
      "This is an age old recipe handed down from mother to daughter, in my family, and then finally from my mother down to me. I strongly recommend that you avoid the temptation to adjust it as the extraordinary delight you will get when you taste it atop of traditional country moussaka, will leave an aftertaste that will linger in your memory for days.",
      "Melt the butter in a pot, over a low flame, and add the flour stirring with a wooden spoon until the flour and butter combine to make a roux. Quickly add the 4 of the cups of milk and keep stirring with a whisk until the mixture becomes almost creamy and when it starts to thicken a lot, add the remaining milk and the beaten eggs (after the milk). Continue stirring until everything has combined evenly and is a thick creamy texture - this may take some effort (if you have lumps, use an electric hand mixer in it for a couple of minutes and they will dissolve). Add the sugar, mix it in well, the salt, pepper, cinnamon and cheese and mix everything well until it acquires its creamy texture again. Allow it to bubble over a low flame for about 1 minute, while stirring constantly. If your cream is too thick, add a little more milk or water and stir it in well until it obtains the desired thickness. If, on the other hand, your cream is a little too thin, let it stand for about 5 minutes and it will thicken as it cools, and then use it.",
      "Pour the Bechamel cream evenly on top of the meat sauce and add the dabs of margarine to the surface of the cream in various places. Bake the moussaka in a medium preheated oven at 180\u00b0C - 350\u00b0F, for about 30 minutes, or until the cream unevenly gently browns in places. Allow the moussaka to cool for about 20 minutes and then cut it into servings."

In St Lou they range from $1.59 each to $3.99 each for the same kind of coconut depending on where you buy them. These are not the small, brown hairy looking coconuts, but the shaved white big coconuts. The meat inside them is soft and gelatinous. You use a cleaver to cut a small square in the top, and drink the coconut water out with a straw (or dump it into a glass). It's full of electrolytes -- nature's Gatorade. You can also use it in the ice cream instead of filtered water. When the water is emptied out you hack the coconut in half and scoop out the meat. The amount of meat in the coconut varies greatly -- try to pick coconuts that seem heavy for their size. I will drink the water and freeze the meat until I have enough meat to make the recipe and then defrost it while I soak the cashews. It does require some effort especially when you haven't done it before, but it's worth it!",

    "title": "lemon infused honey(with variations)",
    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "Lemon Honey:",
      "Pour 1 cup of honey into your pan and add 1 tablespoon of freshly grated lemon peel. Toss in 2 slices for boosted flavor if you like. Heat these together for about 10 minutes, making sure to keep the heat relatively low. Burned honey doesn't taste as bad as some other things do burned, but you still want to avoid it. Around 115 degrees Fahrenheit releases the flavors nicely, but it will depend on your stovetop. After you've heated the mixture, let it sit for 1-2 hours or up to 1-2 weeks. After its infused strain if you'd like, and place in a glass jar with a tightly fitting top. Know the longer it sits for the stronger it will taste.",
      "Good to use: If you have a bad cough or cold, place a healthy dollop of your lemon infused honey at the bottom of a cup. Pour freshly boiled water over the top, drop in a teabag, and give it a good stir. The lemon can loosen phlegm, while the honey soothes irritation. You can also slowly heat the lemon infused honey while adding the juice of one freshly squeezed lemon. When it's still hot and liquid, sip slowly.",
      "Cinnamon Honey:",
      "Pour 1 cup of honey into the saucepan, and drop in the cinnamon sticks. Push them down with a spoon to submerge them. For 10 minutes on low heat let the mixture heat up, and then let it sit for around 2 hours or up to 1-2 weeks. Strain if you'd like and store in glass jar.",
      "Good if used: In tea, just like the lemon-honey, or eaten straight off the spoon. It's also delicious spread on a plain piece of toast. Cinnamon is chock full of anti-oxidants, possesses antifungal properties, and helps break up congestions/clear the sinuses. Even just a half a teaspoon a day has been shown to lower cholesterol levels.",
      "Ginger Honey:",
      "Pour 1 cup of honey into a saucepan and add 1 tablespoon of finely chopped gingerroot. You can add a small pinch of ground ginger if you'd like as well, but it does have a strong flavor. On low heat let the mixture sit for 10 minutes. When it's done let it infuse for 2 hours or up to 2 weeks in a glass jar with a tightly fitting lid. Strain when it's finished if you'd like.",
      "Best used: In your tea when you're feeling ill-especially with an upset tummy, since both ginger and honey are known to soothe your stomach and chase off \"bugs.\" The added ginger helps circulation, flushing toxins through your systems and helping get rid of aches and chills. If you're in a pinch and have wound up with a minor abrasion, applying this cooled and then covering with gauze can help it heal , and the ginger fights inflammation.",
      "Not to be confused with clover honey, clove honey is made by infusing whole cloves with honey, whereas clover honey is made from the nectar of clover flowers. Cloves are great at numbing pain (sore throats, toothaches, etc.) and the honey makes a happy, healthy, medium to ingest it with.",
      "Pour 1 cup of honey into a saucepan, and then add 5-10 whole cloves. On low, heat for 10 minutes before letting it infuse for 2 hours or up to 2 weeks, putting it in a jar with a tightly fitting lid. Strain when it's finished if you'd like.",
      "Best used: In tea when you have a sore throat or a toothache, or dabbed directly on the gum by a sore tooth. The eugenol in the clove is a powerful numbing agent that was used by dentists before modern painkillers were created, and is so effective it is still used in modern dentistry in an extracted form. If you have a little cut or sore in your mouth, the honey may help it heal faster and keep bad bacteria out while the cloves take care of the discomfort.",
      "Apple Cider Vinegar Honey:",
      "Add 1 cup of honey to a saucepan, and then pour in 2-3 tablespoons of apple cider vinegar. Let it heat over low heat for 10 minutes, stirring well about halfway through. Place in a jar and let it sit for as long as you like-its taste and benefits are all there pretty quickly, and it doesn't need to sit as long as something like cinnamon sticks or cloves would.",
      "Best:If you make the Braggs apple cider vinegar health drink you can try adding this for an extra kick. While this is subject to opinion, I think it tastes good stirred in to tea or a glass of lemon water in the morning. Apple cider vinegar can help neutralize and correct excess acidity in our bodies (counterintuitive, but often times true) and helps a number of issues from an upset stomach to easing sore throats to showing promise in treating diabetes.",
      "Storage:",
      "The shelf-life, if stored in a glass jar with a tightly fitting lid, is 6 months. Some people say it can last years, but I have never experimented with that. Even with plant matter, it can go a long time (microorganisms have a hard time surviving on/in it) without needing to be refrigerated. Simply store in a cool place away from direct sunlight. Straining is more for looks/taste, and is easiest when the honey has been warmed slightly after sitting for a few hours so it is runnier. If you want to let it infuse for longer than several hours, pour it into your jar so it's not sitting out in the open for a super long time. When it's infused enough, simply re-heat before straining by placing the jar in warm water if you'd like.",
      "Tips:",
      "-If crystals form, set the honey (in its jar) in a pot of gently simmered water. The crystals will \"melt\" and your honey will be smooth again.",
      "-A nice touch for flavor is to add 3 tablespoons of diced or roughly chopped fruit. Apple-strawberry is one of my favorite flavors for eating on toast with butter. I don't strain it at the end either.",
      "-Flavored honey makes an awesome gift in a nice decorative jar, and you can actually get \"honeystix\" at many craft/party stores.",
      "-Freely adjust to taste, and experiment. It's not an exact science, and it's all about what you like and what's good for you."

      "This has been the only time I could play with my food today! I grabbed everyone's hints and here's what I did: 1/2 cup butter; 1/4 cup oil; 1/4 Celsius applesauce and 1 Celsius brown sugar with 2 cups of white sugar. Then while it was hot, I poked holes in the bread (cooked in a tube pan) and drizzled the cinnamon, sugar and butter combo over the holes. This is dangerous! It is so yummy, I froze sections of it right away so I wouldn't overdue the eating part.",
      "I ended up making a dozen Pumpkin muffins and a Pumpkin loaf as well. It is simply scrumptious! Below is how I ended up re-writing the recipe - it turned out moist, spicy, and DELICIOUS! My family has already asked me to make this at Christmas! 15 Oz Can Pumpkin; 4 Eggs; 1/2 Cup Veg. Oil; 1/2 Cup Applesauce (I used sweetened); 2 Cups Sugar; 3 1/2 Cups Flour; 2 teaspoons Baking Soda; 1 1/2 Tsp Salt; 1 teaspoons Cinnamon; Splash of Vanilla; 1/4 Tsp Pumpkin Spice; 1 Cup Walnuts; 1/2 Cup Raisins; 1 Tsp Nutmeg; 1/2 Tsp Cloves; 1/4 Tsp Ground Ginger; Blended and cooked as described in original recipe. Both placed in the oven at the same time, the Muffins were done in 40 minutes and Bread was done in 1 hr 10 minutes. While on Cooling rack, poked holes in top of muffins and bread, and poured seperate hot Cinnamon Sugar Butter combo over holes, allowing it to seep down inside.",
      "I also used one cup of packed light brown sugar and two cups of regular sugar. I baked mine in one pyrex loaf pan(only one I have) and also made 12 muffins. The one cup of oil was not a problem for me at all, nothing came out greasy. I also sift all my dry ingredients together(not sugar). I will be making this again for Thanksgiving and Christmas. Update: 12/06- This was so yummy my kids actually asked for more the other day. This also freezes really well. I froze most of the 12 muffins I made and when defrosted, they were still really good. 11/08- Yes, I am still making this recipe, today in fact! We now like to add chocolate chips. About 1 cup does the trick, as we don't like many, just enough to give it a chocolate taste. Tip: Freeze the chocolate chips before hand if you want them to retain some of their shape when done cooking."

Work quickly at this point; the longer the mixture sits, the firmer it becomes.",

Cool in the pan on a wire rack for 30 minutes. Run a knife around the edge to loosen and turn out of the pan and cool completely.",

It will keep, well wrapped, in a cool, dry place for up to 2 weeks, or indefinitely in the refrigerator. To serve, slice into quarter- to half-inch slices."

Stir flour to loosen and spoon into a measuring cup. Level off with the back of a knife. Put this in the freezer. In a separate bowl cube the butter and put in the refrigerator to keep ice cold. Measure your water and put it in the freezer to get ice cold. Do not freeze. The key to a flaky crust is keeping the ingredients cold and not over mixing.",
      "Using the paddle attachment on low speed mix your flour mixture just to incorporate. Add the cold butter and mix on medium low speed until your mixture is sandy looking with some chunks of butter left. It will resemble sand that's drying out with the chunks of butter throughout. With the mixer off add 1/2 cup of the cold water and mix on low. Add remaining water 1 tablespoon at a time until the mixture is crumbly and still some chunks of butter. You may not need the entire cup of water so stop adding and mixing when you can form a crumbly dough in your hand.",
      "Lightly flour your work surface. I use a pastry mat that has pie measurements on it but it's not required. Dump your crumbly dough pieces onto your floured surface and bring pieces together by patting them down, not kneading. Flatten the mixture with your hands and fold. Do this a few times until you have a solid dough with some chunks of butter throughout. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour. While your dough is resting start on the filling.",
      "Hamburger filling:",
      "In a large skillet brown hamburger meat until no pink is left and drain. Peel the potatoes, dice them into small chunks and put them in a bowl with cold water. Rinse potatoes well to remove the extra starchyness and boil. Do not cook them all the way because you dont want mashed potatoes. You want them to stay in small chunks, so remove them and drain right before they are fully cooked. They will finish cooking in the oven. Put them in a bowl and place in the refrigerator so they stay firm and stop cooking. Next chop the onion and celery and mince the garlic. In your skillet with a little butter sautee the onion and celery until translucent. Add the matchstick carrots and sautee about 2 more minutes, then add the garlic and sautee on low about 3 more minutes. In the same skillet with the onion mixture add the cooked hamburger meat and combine. Add the soup mix, water, salt, pepper and garlic powder and stir. I use Lipton Recipe Secrets, beefy onion soup mix. The box contains 2 envelope and I add both to the meat mixture. Once this is all combined remove from heat and add your potatoes and lightly stir. You can leave this in the skillet until ready to use or put it in a bowl, as long as it cools down.",
      "Rolling your pie crust:",
      "Remove dough from the refrigerator and remove plastic wrap. Cut dough in half with a bench scraper or knife. Starting with 1 half, on a lightly floured surface roll your dough. Roll dough away from you and turn it to roll in another direction. Do not continue to roll by turning your body. Roll and turn dough, this will keep it from sticking to your work surface. Continue rolling until the dough is big enough for a 9 inch deep dish pie pan, so about 11 inches. Repeat this step with the other half of your dough.",
      "Assembling your potpie:",
      "Lightly spray a 9 inch deep dish pie pan with cooking spray. Lay half of your pie crust in the pie dish and lightly form crust to dish with your hands. You will have some over hanging and that's what you want. Add your meat filling to the pie dish then carefully place the top crust over the filling. Cut off extra dough if any by leaving about 1/4 inch overhang. This will give you a nice thick, buttery outer crust. Using your fingers, gently fold top crust over bottom crust to seal the pie. Make sure it is sealed all the way around your dish to prevent the filling from bursting out. Once it is completely sealed you can flute the edges with a fork or use your fingers to flute. Since I make a thick outer crust for this pie I like to use my fingers instead. Using your index finger press against the pie edge and use your thumb and index finger on the other hand to push the dough up around your index finger on the other hand. Do this around the entire edge of your pie to form a bigger flute for thick crust. Cut 4 small slits in the top of the dough to allow steam to escape during cooking to prevent the pie from bursting out of the sides. Place the pie in your freezer for about 20 minutes prior to cooking. This will keep your pie crust flaky and soft.",
      "Cooking your potpie:",
      "With your oven rack on the bottom position closest to the burner preheat your oven to 350\u00b0F. Beat 2 eggs in a small bowl. Remove your pie from the freezer and brush the entire top crust with the egg wash with a basting brush. Bake on bottom rack just until top crust starts to slightly brown. Turn oven up to 375\u00b0F and move oven rack to middle position. Finish baking pie on middle rack until top crust is done and golden brown. Remove from oven and let cool about 10 minutes, slice and enjoy!"

      "IMPORTANT NOTE #1: This recipe makes a product that's quite salty, and meant to be used as a seasoning agent in small amounts (8 ounces) in jambalaya, beans and rice, or other Cajun-style savory foods. This tasso should not be considered a main dish the way a traditional ham would be. A 7-pound bone-in pork shoulder roast will yield about 4 pounds of usable tasso.",
      "IMPORTANT NOTE #2: Be sure to buy a bag of Morton brand \"Tender Quick\" home meat cure before making this recipe. Use 2 cups of the Morton cure and 8 cups of water to prepare the brine. Food,com does not recognize the Morton cure as an ingredient, so I couldn't list it in the \"Ingredients\" section. It's usually found in the spice aisle of larger supermarkets, in a dark blue paper sack, near the regular table salt.",
      "IMPORTANT NOTE #3: You also will need 7 to 9 chunks of throughly dried hickory wood, about 4 inches x 4 inches each. These are usually available wherever smokers are sold, like Home Depot where the Brinkmann smoker is sold. Soak the chunks in very hot water for about 20 minutes. You may need to put a weight on them to ensure they're completely submerged. Put the soaked chunks in a sealed plastic bag, so they stay moist until needed.",
      "RECIPE DIRECTIONS:",
      "Follow the directions on the bag of Morton cure for making a wet brine, but use 2 cups cure and 8 cups water. Mix until cure is completely dissolved. Leave the skin on the pork shoulder. Submerge the meat in the brine. Weight it, if necessary, to keep it fully submerged. Cure, under refrigeration, for 24 hours.",
      "If you can't find the Morton cure, you can use 1 cup plain table sugar and 1 cup plain table salt to make the brine. The Morton cure usually is located in the spice aisle of larger supermarkets, near the regular salt.",
      "Remove the meat from the brine and dry thoroughly. Remove the tough outer skin, but leave the fat layer that's underneath the skin. Combine the spices, maple syrup, oil and water to make a wet rub that should have a spreadable consistency like thick heavy cream. Coat the meat evenly on all sides with the wet rub, just before putting it into the smoker. Use a brush or your hands to apply the rub. If you don't have maple syrup, substitute honey or dark corn syrup.",
      "Insert a heat-proof thermometer into the thickest part of the meat. Prepare the smoker according to the manufacturer's directions, being sure to include the pan of water. You can add aromatics to the water pan, if desired, for example: lemon zest (yellow part only), whole peppercorns (black, white or pink), bay leaves, dry sherry wine or dry marsala wine. If using wine, replace 1 to 2 cups of the water in the smoker's bowl with 1 to 2 cups wine. Use the zest of a least 2 lemons, 10 to 20 peppercorns and 4 ro 5 bay leaves and add to water in pan. This will give the meat an extra dimension of flavor as it smokes. Place the meat in the smoker, according to manufacturer's instructions.",
      "Add 3 large, well-soaked hickory chunks to the smoker, per manufacturer's directions. Wood should not touch the heating elements. Put the cover on the smoker and smoker and smoke for 6 to 6 1/2 hours or until meat reaches an internal temperature of about 165 degrees.",
      "A rough estimate is to smoke 45 to 60 minutes per pound of meat. Add 2 or 3 more well-soaked hickory chunks at 2 hour intervals, or as the wood in the smoker depletes. Figure on 2 addtions of 2 or 3 chunks over the entire cooking time.",
      "When the internal temperature of the meat reaches 165 degrees, remove it from smoker and tent with aluminum foil. It should rise another 5 degrees to the food-safe temperature of 170 degrees. Let the meat cool at room temperature for at least 1 1/2 hours. Remove the strings and refrigerate, uncovered, until completely cooled. Portion the meat only after it's thoroughly cooled, so any juices are retained."

      "First, make your filling. Heat 1 Tb of the vegetable oil over medium-high heat in a wide, shallow skillet. Cook the diced potatoes according to the package's stovetop directions, stirring occasionally, until they begin to turn crispy and golden-brown. Sprinkle the curry powder over the cooked potatoes and transfer them to a large mixing bowl.",

      "Now Assemble your samosas! Lay an egg roll wrapper in front of you so that a corner is facing toward you. Place 2 Tb or so of filling off-center in the wrapper. Now fold the wrapper over to cover the filling and press to seal the edges. If the edges are a bit dry, you can use a bit of water (a dab will do!) to help you seal the edges. Work your way through all of the wrappers, setting each filled samosa aside on wax paper, and covering them with a moist paper towel. Now you're ready to cook.",
      "Retrieve that skillet you were using, and add the remaining portion of oil. Heat this over medium. When it's ready, add 3-4 samosas, giving each samosa an inch or so of room in the skillet. Allow these to cook until golden brown on one side, then turn them over and do the same. Remove fried samosas to a plate lined with paper towels. Serve fresh, with or without a dipping sauce. Enjoy!"
