      "Immediately begin adding the water to the well in a slow, steady stream, rotating the bowl with one hand while simultaneously mixing the water into the dry ingredients with your other hand.",
      "Stop often as you work to scrape the bowl and your fingers with your bowl scraper, making sure that all of the ingredients have been gathered into the dough mass.",
      "The bowl should be quite clean.",
      "The dough will be soft, slightly wet, and extremely sticky.",
      "Pinch off a bit of dough and taste to see whether you have forgotten the salt.",
      "If so, add it now and mix for another minute or so to fully incorporate it into the dough.",

      "If it is not, make the necessary adjustments.",
      "It is particularly important that you record the time you finish this step as you will need to note the time required for the first (bulk) fermentation, in this case about 1 hour.",
      "Lightly dust a large bowl (preferably glass to allow observation of the process) with flour.",
      "The bowl should be large enough to allow the dough to rise without coming in contact with the plastic wrap that will cover it.",
      "Transfer the dough ball to the bowl, smooth side up, taking care to retain the round shape of the dough.",
      "Cover the bowl loosely with plastic wrap.",

      "Lightly flour the top of the dough to ensure that the plastic wrap does not stick to it.",
      "Transfer to a warm (75F to 80F), draft-free place.",
      "Record the time in your Dough Log, as well as the exact time required for the final fermentation in your Dough Log, and set your timer.",
      "It should take about 1 hour for the final proofing; however, you should keep a close eye on the dough, because if it is overproofed it will be unusable.",
      "If you are using the stainless-steel bowl method for baking, about 30 minutes before you are ready to bake, move one oven rack to the lowest rung and remove the other.",
      "Place a large baking stone on the rack, and preheat the oven to 450F.",
      "To determine whether the dough is ready to be baked, uncover it and gently make a small indentation in the center of the dough with your fingertip.",
      "If the indentation slowly and evenly disappears, the bread is ready to bake.",
      "7 BAKING",
      "Place the dough, seam side down, on a cornmeal-dusted bread peel or the back of a sheet pan lightly coated with cornmeal.",
      "For a rustic look, lightly dust the top of the loaf with flour.",
      "Working quickly with a lame or single-edged razor blade, score the top of the loaf in a traditional manner or use your own signature score.",
      "Cut in quick decisive slashes, marking into the dough by no more than 1/8 inch.",
      "Carefully slide the loaf, top side up, onto the center of the stone, taking care to not touch the hot surface.",
      "Quickly cover the dough with the stainless-steel mixing bowl.",
      "Immediately close the oven door.",
      "Bake for 10 minutes; then, lift the edge of the bowl with the tip of a small knife and use oven mitts to carefully remove the hot bowl.",
      "Continue to bake until the bread is a deep golden brown with a crisp crust and sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom, another 25 to 30 minutes.",
      "(It is a good idea to check after the bread has been baking for about 20 minutes to make sure it is browning evenly.",
      "If not, rotate the bread.)",
      "If you are concerned about the breads doneness, insert an instant-read thermometer from the bottom of the bread into the center.",
      "If it reads 185F to 210F, the bread is fully baked.",
      "Transfer the bread to a cooling rack.",
      "Let cool for at least 1 hour before cutting with a serrated knife or wrapping for storage.",
      "The baguette is the classic shape you see everywhere in France, peeking out of a burlap shopping bag or carried under the arm of a shopper in those iconic photos of Parisian life.",
      "Although not officially called a baguette until the early part of the last century, long, thin loaves were made in France for generations but did not supplant the huge, round loaf of the village bakery until after World War."
