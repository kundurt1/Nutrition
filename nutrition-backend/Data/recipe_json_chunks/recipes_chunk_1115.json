Gradually beat in 3 tablespoons milk and 1 teaspoon vanilla. beat until light and fluffy. Fill a pastry bag with a small tip. Push tip through bottom of paper liner to fill each cupcake.",
      "My Notes: Here is the EASIEST tip for filling the cupcakes. Take an APPLE CORER and use that to pull a cylindrical plug of cake out of each cupcake (once they've cooled). Save the plugs on the side while you pipe filling into each hole you've created. \"Plug\" up each hole using the plugs/caps you had removed with the apple corer. Simple and fast!",
      "I'd use a different recipe for that part next time. The cream filling was great, so I wound up using a double batch of filling for one batch of cupcakes. I didn't like the idea of pushing it in from the bottom (sounded way too messy for me). So I used a knife and cut a cone shape out of the top, spooned the filling in, and replaced the top. (Just be sure to wait until the cupcakes have cooled, or the cream filling just melts!) Then I frosted them using the great chocolate frosting recipe mentioned, and you can't tell they're anything but chocolate cupcakes until you bite into them.",
      "All you need is a pastry bag and tip. Each cupcake takes about 10 seconds to fill. I made my cupcakes in the pan without wrappers, filled them after they were cool, then arranged a dozen or so to a platter and drizzled them with chocolate ganache. They looked surprisingly elegant for cupcakes. Everyone loved them and ate seconds and thirds. I can't wait to try the same cupcake recipe with different fillings. UPDATE: I have made these cupcakes dozens of times since my first review because they are always requested. I like to ice them with Satiny Chocolate Glaze. I have also filled them with chocolate cream cheese frosting, nutella, and whipped peanut butter frosting. I like to fill them from the top and then spoon the glaze on. After the glaze is set, I pipe a small flower in the center of each cupcake with whatever filling I used."

      "For the fortune cookie:",
      "In a medium bowl, whisk together the sugar and egg whites until combined. Whisk in the melted butter, then the flour and then the ginger (or extract or spice of your choice). Place the batter in an airtight container and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight. (The batter will keep in the refrigerator for up to a week in an airtight container.).",
      "Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Line a very flat, level baking sheet with a silicone baking mat or parchment paper, and liberally spray with nonstick cooking spray.",
      "Spoon about a tablespoon of batter onto the baking sheet and, using the back of the spoon or an offset spatula, carefully spread the batter into a circle 6 to 7 inches in diameter. Your first few times you should probably stick to making these one at a time but once you get the hang of it, try making 2 to 3 at a time. Bake until the tuile is completely golden brown all over, 12 to 14 minutes.",
      "As soon as the tuile is done, remove it from the oven and immediately start to slide a spatula underneath the tuile to loosen it from the sheet. The tuile will go through several stages before it gets to its final cooled and crispy state. Directly out of the oven it is too hot and delicate to handle. After about 10 seconds it firms up enough to hold its shape so you can handle it and shape it. It stays pliable for 10 to 15 more seconds; this is your window of opportunity to work with the cookie. Once you've worked the spatula under the whole cookie, pick it up and shape into a fortune cookie. If you wait too long the cookie starts to harden and cool and then your attempt to shape it will result in a shattered mess. You can place the cookie back into the oven for a few seconds to re-warm it into a pliable state. However, with each reheating, the cookie cools down even faster so I recommend only 2 re-heatings. Use a new cool baking sheet for each batch or cool your baking sheet under cool water before reusing. If you try to spoon the batter onto a hot sheet it will immediately start to melt and become un-spreadable. Continue with all of the batter until you have 8 to 10 cookies. Let cool for 30 minutes. Cookies hold for about a day in an airtight container.",

      "In a medium, nonreactive saucepan, combine the lemon juice and butter, place over medium-high heat and heat to just under a boil. In a medium, heatproof bowl, whisk the eggs and egg yolks until blended, then slowly whisk in the sugar until combined. Remove the lemon juice mixture from the heat and gradually whisk a little of it into the sugar/egg mixture. Continue whisking the hot liquid into the sugar/egg mixture, a little at a time, until all of it has been incorporated. When all of the hot liquid has been incorporated, return the contents of the bowl to the saucepan and return the saucepan to medium heat. Cook, stirring continuously with a wooden spoon and making sure to scrape the bottom of the pan frequently to prevent the eggs from scrambling, for 5 to 8 minutes, or until the mixture thickens and coats the spoon thickly. To test, draw your finger along the back of the spoon; the curd should hold the trail for a second or two before it fills. Remove the curd from the heat and strain it through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl. Whisk in the vanilla and salt. You should have about 3 cups. Cover tightly and refrigerate for 1 to 2 hours, or until cold. (The curd can be made up to 5 days in advance and stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator.)."

      "Lay one side of the greased pie iron face up and lay a slice of bread on it, pushing it in a bit to fit. The edges will extend beyond the perimeter of the pie iron slightly but that's okay.",
      "On the bread, sprinkle on a good bit of mozarella cheese, then layer on about 10-12 thin slices of pepperoni. Next, pour on just a little of the tomato sauce, (use regular tomato sauce if you don't want it spicy), and then top it with a tomato slice. Cover this with another slice of bread and close the pie iron with the greased top half of the unit.",
      "You will have to compress the pie iron a bit to close it and you'll find that there's a hook attached to the handles to keep it closed while baking in the hot coals.",
      "Now, lay the pie iron firmly down in the hot coals for TWO MINUTES. Then flip it over and allow it to cook on the second side for TWO MINUTES. Time is pretty critical to avoid burning the calzone.",
      "At the end of the second two minutes, take the pie iron to where you can open it and extract the calzone to a plate. You can use a butter knife to loosen any stubborn ones. Be careful to not burn yourself -- an adult should do this step of the process.",
      "With a sharp knife, carefully trim off any burnt edges (the calzone should be golden brown -- adjust your time on subsequent servings to achieve the desired doneness), allow to cool for a couple of minutes and then cut the calzone in half on the diagonal -- serve warm.",
      "NOTE: You can vary the ingredients all you want -- here are some great variations: You can use 4 small tortillas instead of the bread, with butter or cheese in between layers, 2 flour tortillas and 2 corn tortillas make for a nice flavor and presentation; for different fillings, try canned Skyline Chili and hot dog slices with cheese and fancy mustard; any sort of pizza toppings with pepperoni; thick sausage gravy; scrambled eggs, a canadian bacon slice and syrup, or; blueberry pie filling. Also, vary the cheeses to add more zest -- I like adding freshly grated parmesan to the mozarella sometimes. Hot pepper cheese and Swiss Cheese are also good choices. You are limited only by your imagination on the fillings that you choose -- Enjoy!",

Then get all the air out of the bag and zip it tight. Let it sit on the counter to finish thawing and soak up the quick marinade, flip it a few times too. The beef will soak it up.",

I didn't want the broccoli mushy and it'll go there quickly. I just wanted it steamed through. I did stop it at 1 minute because once the pressure came up, it was really already done.",

      "Chef's notes: This loaf can be made with red or pink salmon. Red is tastier. For the health-conscious, use the salt-reduced or salt-free varieties. And omit - or reduce - the salt in the recipe. I made this again recently, after MarieAlice's review - I hadn't made it for years and years. And not being very good at following recipes exactly whether they be mine or someone else's, I just HAD TO make some changes. I added several grated baby carrots (they are just so sweet and flavoursome at the moment) and several tablespoons of wheat germ. Then in order to retain the moistness, I added some extra lemon juice. And I discovered also that this is one of those recipes that is tastier cold!"

    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "Making the Dough- In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook, pour in water, yeast and 1 tablespoon of the granulated sugar. Stir and proof 5 minutes. Once mixture looks bubbly and frothy, pour in remaining sugar and salt. Stir on low for 15-20 seconds. In a small bowl, measure buttermilk, oil and egg. Whisk ingredients together until egg is incorporated to other two ingredients. Pour contents into the water and yeast mixture. Stir another 20 seconds in the mixer. Pour 2 cups of flour into mixer and stir on low until incorporated. Sprinkle flour in by 1/4 cup increments until dough cleans the sides and bottom of the bowl. Dough should be sticky but not sticky enough to stick to your hands when touched. Once it has reached this stage, turn mixer on and knead for 5 minutes. Remove dough from bowl, grease and replace back into same mixing bowl {since it's practically clean anyways.} Cover with plastic wrap and a dish towel. Rise 1-2 hours or until dough has doubled in size.",
      "Filling and Cutting Rolls- In a medium size bowl, stir brown sugar, cinnamon and cornstarch together until combined. Set aside. Punch down dough. Flour a large clean table liberally with flour. Lightly flour dough as well. Roll dough out to be a 20x30 rectangle {or as close to that as possible} while moving dough around to ensure it's not sticking to your work surface. If it's a little short or uneven, feel free to cut off the edges to even it all out. {FYI-I cut off some dough on one side and filled in a spot that needed more dough on the other side to make a more even rectangle.} Spread softened margarine over dough, being sure to go right to the edges leaving a 1-inch strip untouched on one of the longer sides of dough. Dump brown sugar mixture onto the middle of the dough and spread with your hands, creating an even layer over top of the margarine, still leaving that 1-inch strip of dough untouched. If you have any filling that falls off the sides of the dough, use a bench scraper to replace. Lightly press the sugar mixture into the margarine using a rolling pin. Roll the dough up into a tight log, finishing with the plain dough on the bottom to seal the entire thing together. Cut off the uneven ends to even out the log. Score log every 2 inches and then slice your rolls using those marks. Place into parchment paper lined, margarine greased pans. 12 into a 9x13, 3 remaining into a loaf pan, or 8x8 with the small ends. Cover pans with plastic wrap and dish towels. Let rolls rise another 1-2 hours or until they are touching and have risen almost double. My rolls always spread out more than up, so just be aware that they will most likely spread out more than up. Bake in a preheated 350 degree for 17 minutes, or until tops start to brown. Watch them carefully!",
      "For the Frosting- While the rolls are baking, whip cream cheese and margarine together. Stir in vanilla, corn syrup and lemon juice. Scrape sides and mix again. Pour in powdered sugar and stir slowly until it starts to incorporate. Then mix on high for 5 minutes or until frosting starts to lighten in color. Scrape sides and mix again briefly. Once rolls have been removed from the oven, frost using half the amount made. Then after they have cooled a few more minutes, frost again with remaining frosting. The first frosting will melt down into the rolls and the second layer should stay put. Serve warm."
