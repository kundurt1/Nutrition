Serve with pan juices.",
      "My Note: I cheated. I browned the roast then put it in the crock pot and dumped the minced garlic, you know the stuff in a jar and the rosemary on top of the roast and then cut holes in it a kinda pushed the stuff inside and left some on top too. I didn't make a paste. Then I drizled a little olive oil on tbe top added salt, pepper and accent. Threw some dehydrated minced onions on top. Added the wine and cooked it in the crock pot for 8 hours It came out just as good if not better then the first time. This is the absolute best pork roast. I'm not even sure if I used a loin. I used that big giant pork roast and cut it and made 3 roasts out of it. Not the small loin cut.",
      "I've made a couple of adjustments to it. The first time I made it, I made exactly like the directions stated. Although, I used a meat thermometer, because my loin was perfect in 1 1/2 hours The second time I made this, I pureed 4 cloves of garlic, 1/2 of the rosemary, and enough olive oil to bind it together. I rubbed my pork loin w/ the paste, then put in a ziploc bag in the fridge for a few hours to marinate. YUM! I threw in some veggies with my loin (carrots, onions and celery) and poured about 1/4 cup of wine in the bottom of the pan. Roasted for about 1.5 hours covered, and everything was perfect! I scooped out the veggies, and then used a can of chicken stock and some cornstarch to make a gravy out of the pan drippings. I served with buttered herb rice and the roasted vegetables. BIG hit!"

For any Aussies out there, 250ml is close enough, though. Malt Extract can be bought from any brewery store. Just make sure it is sourced from barley (not wheat), and that it is NON-diastatic! Also, make sure it is pure, with no additives whatsoever. Xylitol and/or dextrose can be subbed equally with the sugar (i.e. sub sweetener on a 1 to 1 basis). Finally, whilst the colour will be identical to the MILO we're all familiar with, the granulation will be completely different! MILO is made with a unique process that really can't be repeated at home, but fear not; for it's the taste that matters! Enjoy, my friends!"

They keep well for several weeks sealed in an airtight tin.",
      "Note: From The Oregonian: The basic method, which we cribbed from an old recipe called Rooster's Famous Fire Crackers, calls for placing a layer of saltines on a baking sheet, sprinkling it with shredded cheese and spices, and baking briefly in a super-hot oven. The cheese melts, then crisps up as it cools. The spices -- any blend of you can dream up -- give it zing, and the results are addictive. After falling in love with Fire Crackers, we couldn't stop there. We tried different cheeses -- some mellow, some sharp -- and different spices, from barbecue rubs to lemon-dill. After lots of testing, we found a handful of great combinations, such as Smoky Cheddar and Barbecue, and Lemony Parmesan and Red Pepper. Don't wait for a party to try them.",

      "In a high speed blender combine the eggs, milk, and vanilla, and blend until foamy. Add the sugar, flour, and salt, and blend just until combined (with no visible lumps).",
      "Transfer to a medium sized bowl, cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours or overnight.",
      "You can make the marshmallows while the crepe batter rests! Begin by combining the marshmallow coating powder ingredients in an airtight container. Set aside.",
      "Line a baking tray with wax paper and sift the coating powder over the top. Fit 2 piping bags with the round piping tips. Set aside.",
      "In the bowl of a stand mixer, add 1/3 cup cold water, sprinkle the unflavored gelatin on top, and stir to combine. Allow the gelatin to bloom while heating the sugar mixture.",
      "Add the sugar, corn syrup, 1/4 cup cold water, and salt to a medium sized saucepan. Cook on medium heat, stirring until the sugar dissolves then add the candy thermometer, and raise the heat to high. Cook on high (without stirring) until the temperature reaches 240\u00b0F.",
      "With the mixer on low speed, VERY carefully and slowly pour the hot sugar into the softened gelatin. Gradually increase the speed to high, and continue to whip until soft peaks form and hold their shape (about 8-10 minutes).",
      "Add the vanilla extract and mix again just until combined. Transfer the marshmallow to the prepared piping bags.",
      "Use the bag fitted with the large round piping tip to first pipe an oval shape onto the wax paper pulling and releasing into a point for the hedgehog's nose. You can use water to smooth any lumps or peaks. Just dip a clean finger into a bowl with a little water and smooth the marshmallow. Try to work fairly quickly as the marshmallow starts to set fast (I like to make 3 hedgehogs at a time).",
      "Once you have 3 bodies piped you can sprinkle on any color of jimmies, that you'd like, for the spines. Then use the piping bag fitted with the small round tip to pipe an ear onto each side of the face. I like to use a little water to flatten and mold it a bit into the right shape. Allow the marshmallow to set for at least 7 hours or overnight before handling. Once set you can use the coating powder to dust any sticky spots. .",
      "When the crepe batter is ready divide it evenly into 3 bowls. Use toothpicks to color each as vivid or softly as you would like with the icing gels, combining the pink and blue gels to make purple. .",
      "Heat a large nonstick skillet, or crepe press, over medium-low heat. Lightly brush with the melted butter, and scoop about 1/3 cup of the crepe batter onto the middle of the skillet or press.",
      "Swirl the batter around the pan to evenly coat the bottom (or follow the crepe press instructions). Cook until the bottom of the crepe feels set - about 1-2 minutes. Then use chopsticks or a spatula to very carefully lift and flip the crepe. Cook for 45 seconds to 1 minute more until set. You will want to add a little more butter between every crepe to keep them from sticking. If the crepes are spreading too thin or tearing lower the heat and cook a little longer. Make about 6-7 crepes in each color, working with one color at a time. .",
      "Once all crepes are cooked transfer them to the refrigerator to cool while working on the filling.",
      "Place your mixing bowl and whisk attachment in the freezer for 15 minutes. Once they are fully chilled add all the heavy cream, sugar and vanilla to the mixing bowl, and mix on low slowly working your way up to high speed (so it doesn't splatter). Then continue to beat for about 5 minutes until the filling is light and fluffy. Crush the Oreos, and fold into the whipped cream (you can reserve some whipped cream without cookies for the top of the cake if you would like).",
      "Time to build the cake! Start with the purple crepes, and place one onto your cake plate or stand. Use an offset spatula to apply a thin layer of the cookies & cream whipped cream on top (leaving a thin border around the edge). Continue to add the crepes, using all of one color at a time, while adding the cream in between each layer working from purple to pink. When you get to the top crepe, cover and refrigerate for at least an hour.",
      "While the cake chills you can finish up those cute hedgehogs :). Melt 1/4 cup chocolate chips and use a toothpick to dot the nose and eyes onto each marshmallow.",
      "When you are ready to serve the cake add the rest of the whipped cream and decorate the top with the hedgehog marshmallows and sprinkles (party hat optional), enjoy!"
