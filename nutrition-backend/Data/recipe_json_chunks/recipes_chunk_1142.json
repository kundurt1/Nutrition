      "Start off by sauteing the garlic, carrots, and celery for a few minutes You dont want they cooked however. Just enough to start the process. Then add the two cans of S&W Italian Stewed Tomatoes. It is important that you use Italian Stewed Tomatoes (preferably S&W brand if you can) rather than canned tomato sauce as it will effect the taste a great deal. If you cant find Italian Stewed Tomatoes -- just wing it. Make it your own! The pieces will be in large chunks. DON'T blend it up! Just simply poor it out onto your hand on the way into the pan (obviously have well washed hands) and crush the chunks with your hands as it goes it. That's the fun part!",
      "When it gets to a simmer again, add 1 1/2 cups of red wine. I recommend swirling the red wine around the cans of I.S. Tomatoes so that you can get every last bit of it out. It might seem like a lot of wine, but remember the amount of time it will be simmering will help reduce it a lot.",
      "Then add the seasonings starting with the whole bay leaves EXCEPT the fresh chopped parsley. Stir it all up, and allow to come to a high simmer. Just bellow a boil. Then turn it down again. At this point I recommend putting the lid on and weighing it down for a firm fit. If you have a pressure cooker, use that! Slow cookers work great too, but I recommend starting off in a pot and then switching over to the slow cooker.",
      "Allow to cook for approx and hour, then test the flavor. Remember, it WILL change after cooking the full time. You can usually tell at this point if its going to be bland or just right though.",
      "Put the lid back on at an angle (to allow venting). Pour the remaining 1/2 cup of wine into a glass for yourself, go sit on the couch and look extremely exhausted. After all, cooking a fancy dinner requires A LOT of work. Make sure your family knows it too as the aroma of your homemade sauce wafts around the house. Put in a movie, I recommend something like Chocolat, or Under the Tuscan Sun -- You will like it, and it will keep the men folk out of the kitchen while you cook. If you ARE a man--football or something--I don't know? What do men who cook watch?.",
      "Stir frequently. If it appears to be getting too hot (IE burning to bottom of pan) TURN IT DOWN. Love your sauce, don't leave it injured. Allow approx 6 hours to cook over the stove top (more if your using a slow cooker, after all -- it's ummm -- \"slow\"). Taste regularly. I also take a loaf of French bread, slicing it open so it hinges at the side, add minced garlic and olive oil, wrap it in aluminum foil and heat in the oven for a few minutes right before dinner is to be served.",
      "When sauce is ready, start water boiling for the noodles. I recommend whole wheat noodles, but you can use any kind your heart desires.",
      "You will know the sauce is ready when it thickens up and is still nice and chunky. If you have a thick paste that's stuck to the bottom of the pan, then you had too much red wine and forgot about your sauce. Don't panic--add water and talk to it, beg it to be ok. Sometimes it comes around. If all has gone well however, you will have a glorious sauce whose aroma fills your house and it will bring your family to the table on its own--no ringing bell necessary.",
      "To serve, strain noodles (DON'T rinse!) put them back in the pot in which they were cooked. Ladle in about 2-3 ladles of sauce (depending on how much noodles you cooked). Remove the bay leaves as you find them. Toss the noodles to coat them with sauce. Plate out the noodles. Put a little sauce on the top. Chop the fresh parsley; toss over the top of each one. Shave fresh parmesan cheese over the top. Cut up bread if you desired to make it, put it in a basket wrapped in a towel.",

Then when the threads have 'puffed' in the hot oil, IMMEDIATELY remove these puffed noodle threads with tongs or a slotted spoon and place them on paper towel to drain. Don't let the puffed noodle pieces stay in the oil or they'll burn. Continue this process until all the cellophane noodle threads you cut up are puffed in the hot oil.

Please do not forget to rinse your vegetables thoroughly before steaming them. When the vegetables are steamed, set them aside.",

(Don't overcook your chicken to the point that the meat is seemingly dry.).",

In a rice cooker, you will need 3 cups of chicken broth to cook the 1 1/2 cups of brown rice. If you use a regular pot and lid to cook the rice, keep an eye on the level of the broth as it cooks because you may or may not need to add a little broth as the rice cooks to keep from burning or drying out the rice. Better that the rice is a little moist than too dry.",

Simply placing a small amount in the microwave will melt all the fats and oils in it again and leave your dog's tastebuds jumping!"

You may use the additional oil or oil spray at this time if your food is sticking to the skillet. Thinly slice the cabbage while the onions are cooking. Add the cabbage to the top of the potato and onion mixture. Crumble the bacon over the cabbage. This will give it that smoked flavor. If you are using the sugar, sprinkle it over the cabbage mixture at this time. Also add the pepper and garlic powder. The steam and heat created will rehydrate the bacon so it will not end up crunchy.",

Turn the cabbage so that it is now on the bottom of the skillet getting most of the heat and the potato mixture is on the top. Essentially you are surrounding the raw cabbage in a cocoon of heat. Let this cook for about 8-10 minutes. You may lengthen this time if you like your cabbage softer or shorten this time if you like your cabbage a little crunchy. During this time, turn the mixture once or twice. You don't want to turn it too much because your potatoes will begin to fall apart. Season with sea salt to taste. Enjoy!",

      "Using the blunt knife to stir, gradually add enough water to make a soft dough. Do not make too sticky. Using a little of the remaining flour, gently roll out the pastry until about 1cm thick. Fold the pastry into thirds by bringing the bottom edge up to about two thirds, and the top edge down to cover. Then fold the sides in the same way. If not using straight away, wrap in foil and store in the fridge for up to 24 hours.",
      "To form the pasties: Roll out the pastry to about 1cm thick and cut into 4 rounds about the size of a large tea plate. Pile filling into the centre of each circle and top with a piece of the remaining margarine. For each pasty, dampen the edge of the pastry with a little water, then fold pastry over the filling to form and half circle. Try to stuff as much filling in as you possibly can.",
      "To make the traditional edging, beginning at the right side, use the forefinger and thumb of your right hand to pinch the pastry together while using the forefinger and thumb of your left hand to fold over the section of pastry next to it. Move along to the next section of pastry, and repeat. Continue in this way along the edge of the pastry, making a rope-like join.",
      "Place the pasties onto the prepared baking sheet. Brush each one with soy milk, and prick with a fork to let the steam escape.",
      "Bake in the preheated oven for about 45 minutes until golden brown. Serve piping hot. The pasties should not split open, but if they do, it's not a problem, they are merely called 'laughing pasties'!"

Bring to a boil over medium heat and cook until the berries are tender and beginning to split but not mushy, about 1 3/4 hours. (Add more water to the pot when the liquid reduces to the level that the wheat no longer floats, and stir from time to time so the berries don't stick to the bottom.) Drain and set aside in the strainer to cool and dry for at least 1 hour or up to several hours.",
      "Place the cooled wheat berries in a large mixing bowl. Add the sesame and anise seeds, walnuts, slivered almonds, raisins, cinnamon, and the pomegranate seeds. Sift in 1 cup of the confectioners' sugar and toss it all together.",
      "Transfer the mixture to a large platter or tray. Sift the remaining confectioners' sugar over the top to coat it thickly, almost like a frosting. Decorate the top with the whole almonds and the dragees.",
      "To serve, present the platter of decorated kolyva. Then, just before eating, mix it all together. Serves 40.",
      "NOTES: Pomegranate is not always in season, but there really is no substitute for the seed in taste, texture, or symbolism. If it is not available, simply omit it.",
      "Dragees are available in any well stocked large supermarket, usually in the baking aisle.",
      "Kolyva is traditionally prepared the day before the memorial serve, but the wheat berries can ferment if left at room temperature overnight and the sugar can crystallize in a refrigerator's moist environment. The best pre-preparation method is to boil and refrigerate the wheat berries ahead of time, then add the other ingredients and decorate the kolyva just before it's needed.",

If top of iron sticks to batter when lifting, hold it down a few more seconds. When cooked properly, they should just have a slightly golden glow.
