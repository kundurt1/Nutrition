Once thoroughly cooked, add the nut mixture and stir well. This step should take about 20 minutes. Use this time to start boiling a large pot of water.",
      "Once the meat mixture has cooled enough, stuff each zuchini as full as possible without breaking them, especially if some were poked through during the coring process. Stuff all of the zuchinis. This step should take about 20 minutes.",
      "In a large frying pan, add some cooking oil on medium heat. When hot, add the zuchinis and fry them until they start to brown, turning so both sides are more brown than green. You will know when they are done. This should take about 15 minutes.",
      "Directly after browning, add zuchinis to the waiting pot of hot water, about an 8 quart pot. If your pot is not big enough, you can do them in batches. Boil them for 10 minutes then transfer to a plate. Some meat mix may come loose, this is normal.",
      "To make the yogurt sauce, mix one container of yogurt, one egg, half cup of milk and one tablespoon of corn starch in a blender. Pour into an 8-qt non-stick pot. Repeat with second container of yogurt.",

You will know the sauce is done when it begins to stick to the pan and coats your stirring spoon. DO NOT LET IT BOIL! Salt to taste. This step should take about 15 minutes.",
      "Add the zuchinis to the yogurt sauce and let them cook on medium-low heat for about 20 minutes. Again, no boiling.",
      "Now for the rice. Add the butter or ghee to a 3-qt or larger pot. Heat just until the butter begins to melt and add the vermicelli noodles and stir until all noodles are coated. Turn up the heat until they begin to fry and turn brownish in color. This should take about 7 minutes.",
      "Add the white rice to the pot and stir to ensure even distribution of the noodles and rice. From here on out, follow the directions on the bag of rice. If you are going to salt it, do so when you add the water. This step should take about 25 minutes.",

      "Fire-cooked: First; if you're making this in camp, it's best to use natural tools. Locate a flat rock (slate is best, of course), sheet of birch bark or similar flat surface. You can use a bowl or a frypan but it's not as much fun. :) Next, find a Y-shaped stick about 2 feet in length; fairly stout - the branches should be about the width of your thumb and should be about two fist-widths apart.",
      "Pre-mix the dry ingredients prior to departure. Don't worry; the seemingly miniscule amounts of salt and baking powder are more than enough.",
      "Pour a small mound of dry mixture onto your flat surface; add water a few drops at a time until a thick dough is formed. Keep adding mixture and water until all mixture is used (or until you have enough. If you're wise you'll carry a fairly large bag of mixture; enough for several days).",
      "Be careful - consistency is critical. The dough must be thick enough to braid. Add water slowly and add less than you think you need.",
      "Form dough into a ball and let it rise 10-15 minutes; use this to build up the fire to cooking temperature.",
      "Roll the dough into a 'Plasticene snake' about 2 inches across. Braid the snake around the ends of the Y-shaped stick tucking the ends in at the bottom. Then simply roast it in front of (not over) the fire, flipping every 1-2minutes until golden-brown. (If you hold it over the fire you'll cook it too fast).",
      "Let cool for a few seconds and tear pieces off. Serve with butter, but it's better dipped into meat juice. In winter, dip into white bacon fat and roast until the fat is brown - good fuel at 30 degrees below zero.",
      "Pan-cooked: Exactly the same preparation except add more water until it forms a very thick batter - twice the thickness of pancake batter. Let rise for 10 minutes. Pour into frypan and cook slowly until golden brown. Serve as above."

Quickly fry for 2-3 minutes, then add the dried shrimp and toss it about until you smell all the great aromas and much of the oil from the sausage has come out. Tip the sausage pieces and shrimp into a dish, taking care to leave most of the oil behind in the wok, and put aside.",

You may use mor less water than 2 cups.",

      "Apple Cabbage Filling -- In a large saute pan, add the butter and bring to medium high heat. Add the onion and saute until lightly brown, just 3-4 minutes. Then add in the cabbage, water, salt and pepper; cover and simmer 10 minutes, stirring often. If needed, you can add a bit more water if it dries out. Finally, add in the apple and continue cooking (covered) for another 6-8 minutes until the apple is tender. Remove from the heat and let cool. Finally, add in the ricotta cheese and mix well until everything is combined.",
      "Ravioli -- Now, I use ravioli sheets which make this easy; and I made mine in triangles, but you can make squares if you prefer. Personally, I first cut mine in squares and lay all the squares out to make a little assembly line, this just works best for me. Then I add 1 heaping teaspoon of the filling in the center, brush the edge with egg white, and then fold over to make a triangle. I use a fork to seal the edges. Make sure to seal them well. You can also just use your fingers to seal the edge too if you prefer.",
      "I like to lay mine out on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and then very lightly dust with flour; cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1-2 hours before cooking. I just think they cook better after then have been chilled. You can also freeze them and use at a later date which works great.",
      "Broth -- Start your broth as it will take a bit longer than the ravioli. In a medium sauce pan, add the bacon and saute on medium heat until golden brown, then remove to a plate lined with a paper towel to let it drain. In the same sauce pan, pour out the drippings and wipe clean. Add in the garlic, broth and thyme, and bring to a boil. Reduce and let simmer 5 minutes. Then mix the cornstarch with the water to make a slurry and stir into the broth. Bring back up to a light boil until the sauce thickens. Remove from the heat and add the bacon in and stir to combine.",
      "Ravioli -- As the broth is simmering, bring a large pot of water to a light boil (medium heat) and add the ravioli. They don't take too long, about 5-8 minutes. The ravioli will begin to float when they are done.",
      "Serve -- I prefer to serve these in a large bowl so you can have the broth. Add 4-5 ravioli per dish and pour over the broth and top with grated swiss if you like. The swiss really is a nice accent to the dish. ENJOY!"

It will turn into a delicious golden crust, the hallmark of Persian rice dishes.",

Try to shape the rice into a hill inside the pan so it will have room to expand.",

The rice at the bottom of the pot will form a delicious golden crust, crunchy and flavored with saffron. This is the part Persians all desire, they call it tah-dig.

You can taste 1 or 2, to see if they're okay.",

Cook for 10 to 15 minutes until roux reaches a medium-tan color, then slowly add the chicken stock and heavy whipping cream. Whisk together and cook for 2 minutes, then whisk in Worcestershire sauce and hot sauce. Set aside.",

Then fold from 6 o'clock up, tucking the edge of the tortilla up and aroundthe fillings and sort of curling it under the filling a bit. Then roll forwards, pulling towards you a bit as you go, and ending with the loose edge of the tortilla on the underside of the roll. I hope that makes sense! Spreading a very thin layer of dressing or sauce over the tortilla before adding the filling makes it hold together better. But you can use toothpicks. I like to slice wraps into 2 halves, but that's just presentation."

      "If you don't have an ice-cream maker, you can still make ice-cream. After you have made up your mixture, transfer it to a lidded plastic box (a shallow one enables the freezing to happen more quickly and also makes whisking easier as the beater can go down straight into the box) and put it in the coldest part of the freezer for two hours, or until the contents become firm at the edges. At this stage, empty out the box into a mixing bowl and whisk the ice cream with an electric hand whisk to break down the ice crystals. Return the box to the freezer and freeze for another two hours, then repeat the whisking process. Refreeze the ice-cream ( if making a sorbet that contains a generous quantity of alcohol, freeze overnight ) until 30-45 minutes before you want to serve it, at which time you should transfer it into the fridge to soften. Incidentally, it's a good idea to arm yourself with a digital kitchen timer to remind you to remove the ice cream and whip it at various stages."

      "Try to make the stock the day after the turkey was cooked, but if you have to wait another day or so, that's okay; it'll taste best, though, if you can get to it soon.",
      "Let's get started; first, get out a large pot.",
      "Next, start to strip off any meat clinging to the carcass; put this in a container and set aside; note that this is a hands-on job and you will get a little messy; that's okay, both your hands and your counter wash up easily.",
      "As you are stripping off the meat (don't fret, you won't get it ALL, some stubbornly clings to the bones and that's okay, it too flavours the stock), continue to break up the bones and put them in the pot; also put in the pot any turkey skin and all the other assorted\"bits\" that aren't edible meat.",
      "When you have the pot full of bones, pour the cold water over and turn heat to high; bring to a boil.",
      "Now wash up and prepare the veggies and parsley; make sure to leave the onion skin ON as it gives your stock a lovely rich colour.",
      "When the stock comes to a boil, add all remaining ingredients and turn heat down to a lightly bubbling simmer, the type where the bubbles barely break the surface.",
      "Now let it simmer for 3 to 4 hours, stirring every once in a while.",
      "I much prefer letting it reduce down to where I'll only get 7 or 8 cups of stock; I find the flavour much better and stronger, even if I have to add water when making the soup.",

Add more oil to the pan if necessary for the next batch, although the ham will usually make it's own in the pan from the previous batch. You only need enough to cover the bottom of the pan.",
      "EGGS: (about 15 minutes to cook) To a *nonstick* skillet, melt butter over medium-low heat (slow cooked scrambled eggs turn out extremely smooth and creamy). Beat eggs and seasonings until very well blended. When butter has melted, pour in the eggs. As they begin to firm, push them around a bit using a spatula. Continue cooking eggs low and slow while ham is cooking in the iron skillet. The ham should be done first, just place a piece of foil over top to keep warm.",

      "For pastry:",
      "Stir together flour and salt. Cut in the shortening in a bowl with two knives or a pastry blender. The shortening should be cut into pieces about the size of peas. If they are too small, the crust will be crumbly instead of flaky. Each of the cut pieces must be coated with the dry flour mixture so that the pieces will not recombine. The bowl and knives or pastry blender should be dry to prevent lumping of the flour.",
      "Next, add the minimum amount of cold water required to just moisten, not wet the flour. From this point on, great care must be used. The water must be distributed throughout the mass, and air incorporated without developing the gluten of the flour by pulling or working. First, partially distribute the water throughout the flour mixture in the bowl by gently tossing with two forks. Just lift up and gently turn over. (Do not use a stiffing motion, which would cause one layer to rub against and pull another.).",
      "As soon as the mixture has attained crumb consistency (pellets of shortening coated with moist flour mixture), turn out of the bowl onto a pastry board. (I use a Tupperware plastic sheet instead of a board.) Very gently shape the mixture into a mound with the hands. Cut the mound in half with a knife. Pick up one half, set it upon the other, and gently form it into a new mound. (Too heavy a hand makes a tough crust.) Cut the new mound in half and stack again. Repeat this until the dough holds together, about 10 times. This operation completes the mixing and incorporates air. (Since pastry dough contains no other leavening agent, this air is required to lighten the pastry.)",
      "Finally, roll the dough to the required diameter and thickness, using very light pressure and working from the center towards the edges. (Do not pull the dough.) Sometimes one must flour the Tupperware plastic sheet and the rolling pin very lightly with flour during this last stage.",
      "The pastry circles for both the bottom and top crusts should be about 1/8 inch thick and 2 inches larger in diameter than the outer edge of the pie plate.",
      "For a 1-crust pie, roll pastry around the rolling pin, loosening the pastry from the Tupperware plastic sheet carefully with a knife. Place it over the pie plate and unroll. Gently press the pastry against the inside walls of the pie plate to expel air bubbles, pushing the edges toward the center rather than pulling from the center out. The pastry should extend about 11/2 inch beyond the rim of the pie plate. One should trim any additional pastry. Turn the edge under and press against the under side of the rim. Flute the top edge.",
      "For a 2-crust pie, place the bottom crust in the pie pan as described above, except cut the excess crust off at the edge of the pie plate with the knife. Put the pastry in the pie pan in the freezer about 30 minutes (at least 15 minutes). After adding the filling, lay the upper crust over the filling in the same manner as before, press the edges of the 2 crusts together, turn them under, and flute the double thickness. Cut the gashes (steam vents) in the upper crust after placing the top crust over the filling.",
      "For the filling:",
      "Combine the first 5 ingredients. Mix with lemon juice and blueberries. Turn into a 9-inch pie plate lined with unbaked pastry. Dot with butter or margarine.",
      "Top with pastry rolled to 1/8 inches thickness. Trim, turn under, and flute edge. Cut a vent in top crust to allow for escape of steam. Bake in a preheated 450 degree oven 10 minutes and then reduce the temperature to 350 degrees for 30 minutes or until crust has browned. Cool before serving."
