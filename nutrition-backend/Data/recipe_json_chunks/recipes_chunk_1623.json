Pour the other can of enchilada sauce over the burritos and sprinkle shredded cheese on top. Bake at 400 for 20 minutes until cheese is bubbly. Serve with garnishes and enjoy!"

      "1. For the Maple Blood Cake: Preheat the oven to 325\u00b0F. Grease two glass or ceramic loaf pans and line with plastic wrap (if using metal pans, line with additional parchment to prevent any reactive flavors.) Bring 21/2 cups of water to a simmer in a small saucepot. Dry-toast the oats in a sautoir for a few minutes over medium heat until they start to smell nutty. Add the hot water and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 15 minutes until just tender, not mushy. Remove the cooked oats and cool completely. Using a stand mixer, whisk the blood and 1 tsp. salt until fully incorporated. Pour the blood through a fine sieve into a large bowl to remove any lumps. Add in the fat, onion, milk, pepper, allspice, maple syrup and remaining 11/2 tsp. salt and stir to combine. Add the oatmeal and mix to combine. Divide the mixture between the two loaf pans, seal the plastic wrap, and cover with foil. Bake for 1 hour in a water bath until firm and the Blood Cakes have reached an internal temperature of 155\u00b0F. Remove from the oven and place a piece of foil-covered cardboard cut to fit the internal length and width of the loaf pan to press against the surface of the Blood Cake. Place a few cans on top to weigh and press the Blood Cakes. Refrigerate and cool completely",
      "2. For the Lard Pie Crust: Place the butter and lard in a freezer for 15 minutes. When ready to use, cut both ingredients into small pieces. In the bowl of a food processor, combine flour and salt by pulsing 3-4 times. Add butter and pulse 5-6 times until the texture looks mealy. Add the lard and pulse another 3-4 times. Remove the lid of the food processor and spritz the surface of the mixture thoroughly with water. Replace lid and pulse 5 more times. Add more water and pulse again until the mixture holds together when squeezed. Place the mixture into a large zip-top bag, squeeze together until it forms a ball, and then press into a rounded disk. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes",
      "3. For the Pie Filling: In a 2-quart saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the ground pork and saute until fully cooked. Remove the pork with a slotted spoon and reserve. Add the shallot and garlic and cook for 2 minutes, stirring frequently. Add the morel mushrooms, carrots, and potatoes and saute for a few minutes. When the vegetables are warmed through, deglaze with white wine and reduce slightly. Stir in the flour, salt and pepper until well blended. Allow the flour to cook for several minutes, as you would for a roux. Gradually add in the hot stock and cream, stirring to prevent lumps. Add back the cooked ground pork and simmer until bubbly and thickened. Taste, re-season as necessary, and remove from the heat. When the filling has cooled down, carefully fold in the Blood Cake, making sure not to break it apart too much",
      "4. To assemble: Preheat the oven to 375\u00b0F. Roll out the Lard Pie Crust and punch out circles that are 61/2-inch in diameter. You can either cut slits into the crusts or punch out a decorative shape to release stream during baking. Brush one side of the crust with egg wash. Spoon the Pie Filling mixture into individual 6\" x 2\" ramekins and top with a circle of crust, egg wash-side down. Press the egg wash against the ramekin to form a seal. Brush egg wash on the tops of the pie crusts and bake the ramekins for 15-25 minutes until completely cooked and nicely golden brown",

This should take about 10 to 15 minutes, but of course it depends on the thickness of your duck and the intensity of the heat you use to cook it. You can do this in your pan if it has a metal handle, or you can transfer the duck to a roasting tray if your pan has a plastic or other unsuitable handle which won't withstand the heat of the oven. I do the latter. If you are planning to do this too, heat the roasting tray in the oven beforehand. The easiest way to do this is to place it in there whilst you wait for the oven to reach temperature. The duck should be placed in the oven skin side down.",

Next day drain the water ,cover with a muslin cloth and keep covered for 2 days to sprout them.\n\n2-**Misal masala, is easily available in Indian stores and you can substitute it with garam masala.\n\n3-You may substitute moth/matki sprouts with mungo (moong), black gram, dried green peas or with mixed sprouts.\n\n4- You may also add some boiled potato cubes, crispy potato chips, roasted salted peanuts on top of the misal.\n\n5 -If you are short of time then you may use readymade goda masala or Kolhapuri masala instead of freshly roasting and grinding the spice mix. \n\n6 -Add yogurt and sweet chutney if you find the broth a bit too spicy for your taste. \n\n7-Misal also tastes great with steamed rice ."

      "In a food processor, combine flour, 2 eggs, and salt. Cover and process until well mixed. If necessary, with processor running, add 1 to 2 tablespoons water through feed tube until mixture forms a dough. Remove dough and shape into a ball.* On a lightly floured surface, knead dough about 1 minute or until smooth. Wrap dough in plastic wrap and let stand for 30 minutes.",
      "Divide dough into four portions. On a lightly floured surface, roll each portion into a 12-inch square. (If using a pasta machine, pass each portion through machine according to the manufacturer's directions until dough is 1/16 inch thick.)",
      "To shape ravioli, in a small bowl, combine 1 egg and 1 tablespoon water; set aside. Cut rolled dough into 2-inch-wide strips. Brush strips lightly with egg mixture. Leaving a 1/2-inch border around the edges, place about 1 teaspoon of filling at 1-inch intervals on one strip of dough. Lay a second strip of dough, brushed side down, over the first. Using your fingers, press the dough around each mound of filling so that the two moistened strips stick together. Cut dough between filling to make individual ravioli. Repeat with the remaining dough and filling.",
      "To cook ravioli, in a Dutch oven, bring a large amount of salted water to boiling. Gently drop about one-fourth of the ravioli, one at a time, into the boiling water and stir to prevent them from sticking to the bottom of the pan. Simmer gently for 3 to 4 minutes or until tender. Using a slotted spoon, transfer ravioli to a serving dish.",
      "From the Test Kitchen\nFor herb-flavored pasta dough, add 1 to 2 tablespoons desired snipped fresh herb(s) with the flour.\n\nTo mix the dough by hand, in a medium bowl, combine flour and salt. Make a well in center of flour mixture. Lightly beat 2 eggs with a fork. Add eggs to flour mixture; mix well. If necessary, stir in 1 to 2 tablespoons water until mixture forms a dough. Shape into a ball. Continue as directed.",
      "SHORTCUT TIP:\n\nUse a ravioli frame to shape homemade ravioli: Cut a sheet of rolled dough so it is a little longer and wider than the frame. Place dough over frame, making sure it completely covers frame. Using your fingers, lightly press dough into hollows of frame. Fill each hollow with about 1 teaspoon of filling. Moisten the dough around filling by brushing it with water. Cut another sheet of rolled dough so it is a little longer and wider than frame; place on top of filled dough. Using a rolling pin, roll over top of dough, pressing firmly to seal and score ravioli. To remove ravioli, carefully invert frame onto a floured surface. (You may need to tap one end of the frame against the surface to dislodge ravioli.) Cut dough into individual ravioli, trimming excess dough. Repeat with the remaining dough and filling."

      "Heat a second medium saucepan (3 quarts) or skillet over medium heat. Add bacon or pancetta and cook until it renders its fat, and is tender and just barely crisp. Remove with a slotted spoon to a bowl and set aside, leaving whatever dripping you can in the pan. Add a tablespoon of oil to the bacon fat if needed, then add the leeks. Cook leeks on medium-low for 10 to 12 minutes, until softened and mostly tender. Transfer to bowl with bacon and set aside, leaving stove on.",
      "Add butter to pan and, once melted, cook onion in butter until translucent and tender, about 5 minutes. Add rice and cook saute until faintly toasted, about 4 minutes. Add wine or vermouth and cook until it almost disappears, about 2 minutes. Ladle 1 cup of hot broth into the rice mixture and simmer until it absorbs, stirring frequently. Add remaining broth 1/2 cup at a time, allowing broth to be absorbed before adding more and stirring frequently until rice is al dente, about 25 to 30 minutes. What you're looking for in well-cooked risotto is a creamy but loose dish. When ladled onto a plate, it should spill into a creamy puddle, not heap in a mound. You might need an extra splash of broth to loosen it. When you achieve your desired texture and tenderness, stir in the cheese, bacon and leeks. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Ladle into serving bowls.",
      "Then, quickly, in a small skillet, heat a pat of butter over medium-high and swirl it to coat the pan. Crack one egg into the skillet, season with salt and pepper and reduce heat to medium. I like to cover the skillet with a small lid at this point, as it seems to help the egg cook faster and more evenly. In one minute, you should have a perfect sunny-side-up egg. Transfer to your first bowl of risotto and repeat with remaining eggs. Garnish each with an extra bit of grated parmesan and eat immediately."

To form the latkes, grab a scant 1/4 cup of sweet potato mixture and squeeze the liquid out into an extra bowl. Form a 3-inch rough patty, and place it on the griddle. Cook about 3-5 minutes per side, until each side is nicely browned. Try not to flip these too many times - figure out how long it needs to cook per side, and flip only once. Set aside while cooking the rest of the latkes. I found that the easiest way to form latkes is to use a 1/4 cup sized ice cream scoop that has a squeeze release mechanism. Scoop up some sweet potato mixture, squeeze the water out into an extra bowl, and release the sweet potatoes into the griddle. Carefully flatten the latke with the back of the ice cream scoop.",

      "Preheat the oven to 176 c /350 F, combine all the spices, prepare the bouillon, clean and prepare the chicken.",
      "The first step is the trick to getting the spices to give the chicken a lot of the flavor. Breast side up, either with a knife or using your hand ( if they are small enough) you need to separate the skin from the breasts. With either your hand or a couple of fingers rug some of the spice mixture into both the chicken breast, and then rub spice mixture on top directly on the skin. Next try to do the same on the drumsticks, make a small incision for a couple of fingers and rub as well and as much spices underneath the skin. Use the remaining spice mixture to rub and cover the entire chicken top and bottom. Cross the drumsticks then put it in the roasting pan.",
      "Dilute the bouillon in the water making sure it breaks up. Pour only a quarter of the liquid into the pan. Reserve the rest of the bouillon, you will add it gradually as the chicken cooks and the liquid in the pan begins to absorb. Check the chicken every 30 minutes and don't let the bouillon dry out, keep adding it. I cooked this chicken for 2 hours ( cooking time depends on weight, higher weight = longer cooking time. Please double check proper cooking times for the weight you use). I check on it every 30 minutes, the fat will begin to melt off and collect in the pan. Spoon up that liquid/fat mixture and pour it over the top of the chicken. Half way through the cooking time, flip the chicken over and cook for 30 minutes ( pour some of the collected liquid from the pan again), after 30 minutes flip again then finish roastin"

Place the other butter slab on one half of the folded dough and fold the remaining dough over top. You will now have a rectangular packet of dough-enclosed butter. Pinch the edges together to close the 'packet'.",
      "Now roll the dough (with the enclosed butter) into a rectangle, about 10 inches by 24 inches. Fold each side into the center; then fold one side over the other. It will look again like a rectangular packet, about 6 inches by 10 inches. Lightly flour the top of the dough and wrap in plastic wrap. Chill dough for about 20 minutes so the butter rests.",
      "Remove the dough from the fridge and roll it out again into a rectangle. Fold the rectangular into thirds as before and then fold the dough in half. Wrap in plastic wrap and chill dough again for at least 2 hours or overnight.",
      "For filling",
      "While the dough rests, prepare the filling. In a KitchenAid(R) Tri-Ply Stainless Steel 12\" Nonstick Skillet, cook the bacon over medium heat on a KitchenAid(R) 30\" Electric Convection Slide-In Range with Baking Drawer until crispy. Add in the spinach and eggs and cook until spinach wilts and eggs scramble, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside.",
      "Remove the dough from the fridge and divide it into two halves. Roll the first half into a rectangle, about 12 inches by 6 inches. Cut off the two top corners of the dough and make small triangles at the bottom. (See above and this video for visual).",
      "To fill the pastry, sprinkle half of the cheese down the middle of the dough and then top with the cooked eggs, bacon and spinach. Finish with another sprinkle of cheese down the middle.",
      "Cut slanting strips along both sides using a sharp knife (pictured above). Fold in the bottom end (where you cut two triangles out) to seal the filling and braid the dough using alternating strips.",
      "Repeat with the other half of the dough. Cover both braided danishes with plastic wrap and let rest on a KitchenAid(R) Professional-Grade Nonstick Sheet Pan for about an hour at room temperature before baking.",
      "When ready to bake danishes, brush the danishes with egg wash and bake them in your KitchenAid(R) 30\" Electric Convection Slide-In Range at 400 degrees F until golden brown, about 18 minutes."

Drain and rinse out the pot and return to the stove over medium high heat. Add the canola oil and sear the cubed pork shoulder in batches to prevent crowding (remove the meat from the pan using a slotted spoon or spider in order to reserve the fat for the next batch of searing.)While the shoulder is cooking, cut the cooled pork belly into the same 1\" dice. Once the shoulder is seared, continue by searing the pork belly in batches until all the meat is nicely browned.",

      "3. Add the Shaoxing cooking wine to the pot (be careful, the mixture will sputter and seize!) Add the pork stock and raise the heat to medium high. Bring to a simmer and using a wooden spoon or spatula, scrape the bottom of the pot to incorporate the seized caramel. Add the sliced ginger, garlic, scallions, star anise pods, dried chilies, cinnamon stick, bay leaves, soy sauces, red food dye and few twists of fresh cracked black pepper. Add the cubed pork back to the pot and lower the heat to maintain a gentle simmer. Cook for one hour, stirring occasionally until pork is fully tender. Add the soft cooked eggs, submerge them as best possible and cook for an additional 15 minutes, rotating as needed to cover.",
      "4. Remove the cooked eggs and reserve. Check the sauce consistency and raise the heat to a boil to reduce to desired consistency until sticky and velvety (alternatively add more pork stock if you prefer a looser sauce.) Taste and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper as needed."

Line with the puff pastry, trim to fit, place dish oven tray, prick pastry light with fork, cover pastry with baking paper and fill with weights.",
      "Bake for 15 minutes with weights on, remove the weight and bake further until the pastry is browned lightly. About 10 minutes.",
      "Meanwhile, briefly boil cut asparagus in lightly salted water. Boil until just tender, drain and set aside.",

      "Add asparagus, salmon and onion into the egg mixture. Mix well and pour in pastry case. Sprinkle with bacon and then mozzarella cheese. Initially I mix the bacon into the egg mixture as well, but I think by sprinkling them I will be able to get the crunchy taste of it.",
      "Bake for 25 minutes or until just set."
