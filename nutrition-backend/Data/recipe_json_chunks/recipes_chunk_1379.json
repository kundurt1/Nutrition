      "Rinse and pat dry the potatoes, but leave them whole, skins on. It helps for cooking time if they are roughly of similar sizes. Place the rock salt in a baking tray in an even layer. Place the potatoes on top of the salt layer and bake at 350\u00b0F for 1 hour, or until a fork can easily pierce the potatoes.",
      "Remove from the oven and let cool ever so slightly so they are warm, but can be handled, and remove the skin with a small sharp knife. Place the potato flesh in a large bowl and, while hot, mash or put through a potato ricer so you have a smooth, fluffy consistency. Spread the mixture out with a fork to allow the heat (and steam) to escape and allow to cool without covering (this ensures the mixture does not retain too much liquid).",
      "Add the egg yolk and 1/2 teaspoon of salt to the cooled potato and and mix to combine. Then, fold through flour until you have a soft dough. Pinch off fist-sized portions and with the palm of your hand, roll into a 1 centimeter-thick log, then cut the log into 1 centimeter pieces and roll each one until round. If needed, dust surface with potato starch.",
      "*Note: Baking the potatoes with the salt layer helps to absorb any excess moisture, all helping to make that fluffy, airy potato filling. Using potato starch (note, not potato flour; you can substitute cornstarch) helps makes these not only fluffy and light, but also happens to be gluten-free. You can use regular wheat flour if you don't have a problem with wheat, although you will likely need to use more-double and even up to 250 grams, depending on the humidity of your dough.",
      "Put a large pot of salted water on to boil the gnocchetti.",
      "Finely grate the lemons with a microplane for their zest (careful not to use any of the white pith, it is bitter), then, cut them in half and squeeze all the juice from them. Set aside.",
      "Place butter and olive oil in a skillet to melt over medium heat. Once melted, add the lemon zest and let infuse for about 1 minute, stirring. Do not let the lemon burn; add the lemon juice and let simmer 3 minutes. Add the goat cheese, about half the Parmesan, and season with salt and pepper; cook a further 1 to 2 minutes, or until thick. Add the chiles and parsley, if using, then remove from the heat.",
      "Cook the gnocchetti in the simmering water for about 2 to 3 minutes, or until they float. Drain carefully (save about 125 ml of the cooking water), and place the gnocchetti in the pan with the lemon sauce, swirling to coat. Add some extra cooking water if it is looking dry. Serve with the rest of the grated cheese (and more if desired).",
      "*Note: Seek out organic lemons, as they haven't been treated with pesticides or waxed; since the flavor of this dish relies mostly on their zest, those kind of treatments are the last thing you want to taste. Do give them a good rinse under running water and pat dry before using, though. You can also use single cream instead of the goat cheese."

      "Use your preferred roasting method, or use what we did: Preheat your oven to 450\u00b0F, then reduce the temperature to 350\u00b0F and roast the turkey for 80 minutes, basting intermittently. Check on the turkey and roast for another 35 to 40 minutes-or until breast is 150\u00b0F and the thighs are 165\u00b0F. Let rest 20 minutes before carving.

      "for the ice cream base, it's my usual egg custard base. in a medium saucepan add in 2 1/2 cans of coconut milk, reserving the remaining for later. heat up the milk with the sugar until fully incorporated. add in a few healthy sprinkles of lemon zest. in a small bowl, separate your eggs. whisk the yolks, and then with a ladle pour in the hot coconut milk all the while whisking the yolks. this is tempering the yolks so it doesn't scramble. if you want, add in another ladle-full. then slowly add in the warmed through yolk mixture into the saucepan, still whisking. you want the mixture to be fully incorporated. keep the heat on medium and keeping mixing until the mixture has thickened, about 10-15 minutes. at this point, with the remaining half can of coconut milk stir in the potato starch, then add mixture to the custard. this will thicken the custard even more, while also preventing full on ice crystals from forming when the ice cream is in the freezer.",

You don't need to keep all the liquid when you serve it if you'd rather have a less watery presentation, but the liquid is delicious stuff, so you might also just serve it all with good bread to soak up some of the juice. Alternatively, you could throw in some cubed, dry bread and call it a panzanella!

You can mix in a bit more butter if you like, but remember that you just the meat dressed, not drowning. Gingerly mix in the avocado pieces.

      "Mix together the evaporated milk, coconut milk, condensed milk, and sugar. Add the water/gelatin mixture, and cook over low medium heat until the sugar and gelatin are dissolved. Do not let simmer. Remove from heat, and add the vanilla extract and (optional) the lime zest. However, please note that if you are going to unmold this dessert, you may see some of the zest (as in picture) at the top of the dessert (bottom of dessert if not unmolded). If you don't like this, just skip the zest.",
      "Pour mixture onto either a lightly sprayed pyrex dish if you want to serve it right from the dish (the usual 9x13 pyrex is too big so look for a smaller one; sorry I do not know exact size) or onto a lightly sprayed mold if you want to unmold it. Put in refrigerator for at least 24 hours . Of course, for presentation purposes, unmolding it is better but it can be tricky. In the picture I used a 9 cup ceramic bundt-like dish. To serve unmolded, carefully loosen the edges with a knife until you can feel that the dessert is shaking loose from the edges. Invert onto a plate. Right before serving, sprinkle 1/4 cup or more of the toasted, coconut flakes on the unmolded blancmange; and leave the rest aside for people to add more on their individual slices if they want. I myself love to add LOTS of it. But note that once you put leftover in fridge, the coconut flakes may not be as crunchy due to the wet surface of the dessert. So this is why I prefer to leave most of the flakes in a separate dish for people to use right before eating.",
      "For the sweetened coconut flakes, you can either toast in a pan, or (like me) put it in a 350 degree heated oven and occasionally stir the flakes so that all sides are evenly and very well (meaning very brown*) toasted. This may require a bit of patience; and (off the top of my head) about 15+ minutes in the oven. The flakes can get too dark very easily, so be careful. Do not be distracted while you are toasting the flakes, particularly if you do so inside oven. Let cool (uncovered) before using. * I like my flakes really really brown because this makes them more crispy."

Add the butter and, using your fingers or the spatula, mix everything together until you've got crumbs of different sizes. It's nice to have a few big pieces, so don't overdo it. Set the crumbs aside. (The crumbs can be made up to 3 days ahead, covered and refrigerated.)",
      "To make the cake: Whisk together the flour, baking powder, salt, cardamom, and espresso powder in a large bowl. Turn the dry ingredients out onto a sheet of wax paper, and put the sugar and zest in the bowl. Rub them together with your fingers until the sugar is moist and the fragrance of orange strong, then return the dry ingredients to the bowl and whisk to blend.",
      "Put the remaining ingredients in another bowl and whisk them to blend. Pour the wet ingredients over the dry and stir - don't beat - to mix. Stir only until you've got an evenly moistened batter. Scrape the batter into the prepared pan and top with a thick, even layer of the crumbs. Pat the crumbs ever so gently into the batter.",

      "Serving: Cut the cake into squares and serve warm or at room temperature.",
      "Storing: This cake is best served the day it is made. It can be wrapped airtight and frozen for up to 2 months; once it defrosts, it benefits from a quick warm-up in a 350-degree-F oven.",
      "Playing Around: I often make just the crumbs and use them to top ice cream and desserts like Chocolate Pudding (page 383), Coffee Caramel Pots de Creme (page 389) or Lemon Cup Custard (page 387). Make the crumbs as directed and refrigerate them for 2 hours. Crumble up the mixture, spread the crumbs out on a baking sheet lined with parchment or a silicone mat and bake in a 350-degree-F oven for about 15 minutes, or until golden and baked through. Let cool. The crumbs can be wrapped airtight and kept at room temperature overnight or frozen for up to 2 months."

This will help the egg white absorb into the other ingredients. Then, add the whiskey, espresso, lemon juice, and simple syrup. Next, grab your shaker, a box of matches, and the rosemary.

Let it sit for about 30 seconds, so that the ingredients are infused with smoke, while you assemble your other ingredients.",

    "title": "second helping celery soup",
    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "for the soup:\r\nBring the chicken stock to a boil. While you wait for it to boil pull the stalks of celery apart and set the hearts aside for another use. If you like a little texture in your finished soup ( I sure do!) leave the celery as is; if you want a smoother finished product, peel it to get the strings off.",
      "Roughly chop the celery, garlic, and the onion, and put them in the stock.\r\nTurn the heat down to medium and simmer for 10-20 minute or until the celery is cooked through.",
      "While your waiting for the celery to cook, small dice (tiny!) the potato and apple, and finely chop the bacon. ( I just happened to have a little leftover bacon hanging out in the fridge and decided to throw it in; if you don't have pre-cooked bacon around, this soup is still delicious without it.)",
      "Warm some oil in a small frying pan and quickly sautee the bacon. This will get it crispy again, and flavor your cooking oil. with a slotted spoon, remove the bacon and put it in a bowl.",
      "Add the diced potato to the bacon oil and sautee until crispy and golden brown. With a slotted spoon, remove the potatos and add them to the bacon in the bowl. \r\nUsing the same oil, saute the apple until tender and add them to the bowl, too.\r\nKeep that oil, you'll need it in a minute. \r\nSalt the bacon-potato-apple mix, and add a few dashes of vinegar until it has a bright, tangy flavor.",
      "In the same sautee pan, melt the butter with the remaining flavorful oil and add the bread crumbs. Stir continuously over med-high heat until the bread crumbs are toasted and brown. Dump them into another container and set them aside for a minute. (I usually have a large batch of these in a resealable container to use for topping pretty much anything, they keep really well.)",
      "By now the celery should be done, so use a hand blender to puree the vegetables and stock. Return it to the heat and add the milk, then salt and pepper to taste. If you didn't peel the celery this should be a mostly smooth mixture with a lot of small celery fibers in it.",
      "Ladle the soup into bowls and put a little pile of the potato-apple mix in the center of each one. If you don't use it all, store it separately from the soup so it doesn't get soggy and add it when you eat the rest of the soup.\r\nLTop that with a generous amount of the toasted bread crumbs and you have a killer celery soup. If you want to take it even further, a dollop of sour cream or some parmesan is a great addition."

      "Dissolve the yeast, salt, and sugar into the water. Mix in the olive oil.",
      "Mix in flour with a spoon until you have a soft dough, but not so sticky that it's unmanageable.",
      "Place the dough in a clean, well-oiled bowl (cooking spray can work well for this) and let sit at room temperature for an hour. Then refrigerate for another hour or as long as overnight. While the dough is in the fridge, make the sauce and get the toppings ready.",
      "When ready to make the pizzas, punch down the dough and divide in two. Spread the pizza to the desired size and let rest on a surface dusted with coarse semolina or cornmeal. If you don't have either of these, then flour works fine as well, though I like the rough texture that the semolina provides.",
      "If using a fresh squash, cut it in half, lightly rub with olive oil, and roast at 350 degrees F until easily pierced with a fork at the thick ends (~30 - 45 minutes). Also roast the roma tomatoes if using fresh ones (so that the skin is easy to remove).",
      "When soft, scoop the squash from the skin with a spoon. Place in a bowl.",
      "Skin the roast tomatoes or open the can of tomatoes.",
      "Dice the garlic and shallot and fry in a little bit of oil (2 - 3 tsp) until translucent or very lightly browned. If you don't have a food processor, do this step in a medium sauce pan.",
      "The next step can be done one of two ways: If you have a food processor, add all the ingredients to the food processor and make a puree. If you don't have a food processor, add all remaining ingredients to the pan with the garlic and shallots and squish the squash and tomatoes into a sauce with the back of a wooden spoon. Let simmer until it looks well combined. I've never been a fan of oregano or thyme, but if you like those, you could add those here. If I didn't have fresh basil to put on top of the pizza, I might be inclined to mix some into the sauce at this point.",
      "Now the sauce is ready to use! Simple toppings will allow you to taste the sauce more, but it works equally well with flavorful toppings. In the picture above it is topped with 3/4 units shredded mozzarella, 1/4 unit shredded parmesan, blobs of herb-encrusted goat cheese, anchovies, and spinach leaves (which I put under the cheese so it doesn't get dried out when I bake it)",
      "Bake the pizza at 400 - 450 F on a pizza stone for about 15 - 25 minutes, or until the cheese is nicely browned. Cooking time will depend partly on how much topping you put on the pizza (less is often more)."

I have accidentally added the almond mixture at the wrong stage and the cookies did not spread. \r\n2) Cool your tray with water each time you remove it from the oven (it will not warp your tray) or get three trays handy because if you drop your batter onto a heated tray the cookies will start to spread instantly and will be oddly-shaped. \r\n3) If you end up with any oddly shaped cookies, just take some scissors and cut the edges into a nice shape before the cookies have completely cooled.\r\n4) These can be made ahead and chilled in the fridge.",
      "Preheat your oven to 350 F and line two baking trays with parchment paper; set aside. Bring the butter, sugar, milk, vanilla, and honey to a boil, stirring continuously. Once it reaches a rolling boil, wait one minute and then remove from the heat.",
      "In a separate bowl, mix the flour, almonds, cinnamon and orange zest together and then add them slowly to the heated mixture, making sure everything is incorporated well. Let sit for about 20 minutes or until the mixture is cool enough to be handled, even though you won't be handling it. If the mixture is stiff when you return to it, warm it up over a low flame for a minute or two.",
      "Drop teaspoon-sized balls onto your parchment paper, leaving about three inches space between each of the cookies because they will spread a lot. While the cookies are in the oven, create a double-boiler to melt the chocolate or melt it in the microwave.",
      "Leave them to cook for 6-8 minutes. If you want them more like toffee brittle leave them in on the longer end. I like mine slightly chewy in the center and crispy on the outside. Once the centers are bubbling and they have a goldeny-brown color, remove them from the oven. Immediately remove the parchment paper from the tray and let them cool on your countertop. After about three-five more minutes, you'll be able to remove them from the parchment paper without a problem; any sooner and they'll still be soft and will break.",
      "Once you're able to remove them from the parchment, you can wrap however many you want around the handle of a wooden spoon and create a flute. OR, you can fold them to create a bowl for ice cream. OR, you can teaspoon chocolate onto the flat side of a cookie and sandwich it between another, which is my preference. Place them in the fridge for about 15 minutes to get the chocolate hard. Enjoy!"

Transfer your dough to the pan and gently stretch it to fit the dimensions. It will feel like the consistency of soft chewing gum. Sprinkle 1/2 cup of green onions and a large pinch of salt across the top. On top of the green onions, use your fingers to slather the tomato puree, avoiding the edges where the dough meets pan (the sauce will burn). Loosely cover and let the dough proof in the pan for 30 minutes, until it's puffed up.",
      "Meanwhile, heat your oven to 475\u00b0 F. Once the dough has puffed up, it's time for the most fun part of making focaccia: poking it all over with your fingertips to make dimples. Do this, then bake for 20 to 25 minutes, until the un-sauced edges are a toasty color where they touch the pan, and the pizza-like bubbles that have puffed up across the surface are tinged dark brown in the centers.",
      "Remove from the oven and sprinkle with the remaining green onion, a drizzle of olive oil, and more salt to taste. You can slice and eat it as soon as it cools a bit. Refrigerate to store."

Most widely available mussels are farm raised and generally beardless and sand-free, but if you get the \"wild\" kind, you'll need to pull the beards off. They're edible, but generally not appetizing nor attractive. Mussels (and other shellfish) with open shells may be dead. Rap on the shell with your knuckles or the blunt end of a knife-then try to close them. If these methods don't work, discard. Only live shellfish are safe to eat"

(Make sure your bowl is at least three times the size, or more, of the ball of dough.) You don't need to grease the ball, because it stays moist enough with the bowl over it.",

Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and a tea towel, and set it in a draft-free place that's not too warm. You don't want it to rise too quickly.",

Take a look at photo #10 to see what the batards look like after the second rise, and at my note below, about the chopstick.",

Stretch it into a long rectangle shape that's a few inches longer on each side than the rectangle with which you started. Then let it rest for at least ten minutes. Fold the dough in half lengthwise, then press it together, pushing firmly with your flattened hands and stretching it outwards. You'll be pressing CO2 out as well as making the rectangle larger. Pinch the long edge together, then repeat. Roll the dough between your hands to even out the roll. It should be about 15 inches long.",
      "Cover the baguette with the floured towel while you shape the other piece. Transfer each shaped baguette to a large piece of parchment. It can go on the diagonal of a 12 x 12 inch square. Bring the two loaves close enough together so you can cover them with the floured tea towel. Let them rise for another 45 minutes.",

At the same time, put baking stones on the shelves of the oven, if you are using stones, and a cast iron skillet on the bottom shelf. Preheat with enough time for the stones to continue to get hot for at least 20 minutes after the oven has reached 425 degrees. Put on a cup or so of water to boil.",
      "When the dough has risen, slide one of the sheets of parchment and its baguette onto a large cookie sheet with one open end, or an inverted baking sheet if you don't have one with an open end. (Or, if you like using a peel instead, feel free. I find the open-ended cookie sheet much easier to manage.) Generously brush the baguettes with olive oil.",
      "To form the rolls, use kitchen shears to cut into the dough at about a 40 degree angle, just down to the bottom of the baguette, but not all the way through. Gently move the cut piece to one side. Repeat, moving the cut pieces to alternate sides. Brush the open cut pieces of dough with olive oil. Sprinkle with coarse salt.",
      "If you are using a standard pizza stone which is round, bend your dough in a semi-circle as you go, or you can bend it before you start cutting. It doesn't really matter. The wreath you are making will fit nicely on the stone.",
      "Slide each ring of shaped dough, with the parchment paper, from its cookie sheet onto a pizza stone. Pour one cup of hot water into the skillet on the bottom shelf of the oven.",
      "Immediately close the door and set the timer for 6 minutes. Check the rolls after six minutes and tent them lightly with foil if they seem to be browning too quickly.",

      "NOTES ON THE PHOTOS: The photos are in reverse order of operation, between numbers 2 and 10. In #10, I included a chopstick, which is the short kind the give you when you order take-out from many Asian restaurants. I keep one in each of my large flour canisters to use for leveling the flour when measuring. (\"Sweeping,\" I think, is what some call it.) You don't have to use a table knife this way. It's very handy!",
      "In #9, I've included my olive oil cruet, which I use only for cooking and baking, and most often, for bread. I bought the cruet at a restaurant supply store. (I have nearly a dozen others, filled with vinegars of all kinds, plus sesame oil, for when I need a \"splash\" while cooking. I keep them on a lazy Susan in a cabinet that's handy to my stove.) I like the cruet for the oil because it allows me to dribble drops in a controlled way on the loaves; if I need more, I can put a number of drops on my pastry brush. It's much more convenient than conventional stoppers generally available for bottles of oil, because it releases much less at a time.",
      "Photo #8 just shows the baguettes rising, covered. I put each on a separate piece of parchment and then snuggle the two pieces up next to each other, overlapping the corner of one sheet, so I can cover them both with the same floured towel I used for the second rise.",
      "Photo #7 simply shows how I curled the baguette around so to fit on a standard pizza stone. Then I brushed it lightly with olive oil. The specks you see are toasted wheat germ. They'll get a bit browner when cooked, giving the bread a lovely fragrance and a nice taste.",
      "Photo #5 shows all the steam coming out of the oven when I lightly tented the rolls after about 8 minutes. I checked them through the glass window on my oven door at 6 minutes and they looked fine. I was using convection, which tends to brown baked goods faster than a conventional oven. Tenting works perfectly to control that. I re-use the pieces of foil cut for tenting, keeping them folded in my favorite bread pan, which is kept in a lower cabinet right next to the oven.",
      "Photo #4 shows the cut dough on the parchment, after I slid it onto the hot pizza stone. I wanted to take a photo of sliding the bread and parchment off, but that's best done with two hands, so I couldn't get that shot. I use my left hand for guiding the edge of the paper on the left, while lifting and pulling back the large, open-ended cookie sheet with my right hand.",
      "Photo #3 (out of order) shows the dough after brushing with more olive oil and sprinkling on the flaky salt.",
      "Photo #2 shows how to cut the dough with scissors to make the rolls. See, I said it was easy. ;o)",
      "One other point: If you can get a gliding rack for your oven (one on rollers or a smooth track that comes out very easily and stays firm and in place while the rack is pulled out), do so. It's your best friend when making bread or pizza on a hot stone. It's nice to have for all of your other baking and roasting, too, especially basting and other processes like it. ;o)"

To ascertain doneness use your sense of hearing: when you first add the beans, they will make a bright, dry thud against the sides of the pot when stirred. As they absorb water, they quiet down and make a softer, duller sound (test several beans by slicing through with a knife on a small dish to see that all are fully cooked through).",

My mom used to get them from the local village fisherman in Egypt, but you can get them from any meat/fish butcher. Make sure to ask them to clean them fully (inside and out), preserving their skin and meat, if you don't know how to properly clean them. (Most people don't, and I wouldn't blame you for not wanting to-it's very intense and not recommended if you're squeamish.) If you do decide to clean them yourself, make sure to remove the insides, scales, and as much bone as you can. Sardines have tiny bones so it's hard to get everything, and this is not a particularly easy dish to eat for that reason, but trust that it's worth it.",

If you'd like, you can leave it out for a couple hours to really soak into the fish and marinade. There should be plenty of juice in the dish. Cover the dish with aluminum foil and place in the oven for 35 minutes. Take the dish out of the oven and carefully remove the aluminum foil, then bake the fish for an additional 5 minutes without the cover. After 5 minutes, remove from oven and immediately sprinkle parsley over fish so that the flavor gets absorbed into the heated fish.",

During this process, reduce the heat if the onions are sizzling or scorching or raise the heat if onions are not browning at all after 15 minutes or so. Be sure to check in on the onions and give them a stir every 10 minutes or so. Make sure not to mix the onions too much. You want to make sure they have enough time to chum it up with the heat of the flame so that they start to caramelize. Note: the exact cooking time can vary depending on the size of the onions, their liquid and sugar content, and their age. That's why it's important to check in on them regularly.",
      "If you're like me and fear getting focused on something else I'm doing or preparing and forgetting our dear onion slivers, you'll set a trusty kitchen timer both to keep you honest and to make sure you actually get to eat the onions without burning them. Took another pix of how it's starting to look all golden one hour into cooking. Mix well and cook for 5 minutes at a time. Mix well and cook for 5 minutes at a time. The onions are fully caramelized when they develop a molasses-like color and flavor. Then season them with sea salt and fresh-cracked pepper and mix well.",

      "The night (or at least six hours) before making the pie, steep the tea leaves in 1 cup of just-boiled water, off the heat, for four minutes. Strain the tea and, in a small bowl, cover the prunes with it. Press down on the prunes to make sure they are fully immersed, at least to start. Let them sit at room temperature until ready to use.",
      "Prepare the crusts: Roll out the bottom to create a 1/2 inch overhang; put in the pie plate, cover well and refrigerate. Roll out the top crust, large enough to create a 3/4 inch overhang; wrap with plastic and refrigerate until ready to use. (If I'm not using my rolling pin for other things, I wrap it around the pin, leaving on just the bottom/outer layer of wrap.) Refrigerate until ready to use.",

When done, put half of them immediately into the prepared pie shell, and the rest into a bowl. They will continue to cook on the baking sheet if you don't.",

      "Brush the top crust with egg wash. Lightly sprinkle with the sugar and cinnamon mixture. If you do this from about 16 inches above the pie, you'll get a more even distribution of it.",
      "Make 6 or 8 vents around the outside, and cut in the middle of the pie a vent that's about 1 1/2 inches in diameter. You can make it square or circular, or any other shape you like.",
      "Bake for 12 minutes at 425 degrees Fahrenheit on a shelf in the bottom third of your oven.",
      "While the pie is baking, mix in a glass measuring cup with a spout the egg and second yolk, cream, vanilla, almond extract, 1/4 cup sugar, allspice and 1 1/2 tablespoons of Grappa.",
      "Once the pie has baked for 12 minutes, turn the heat down to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.",
      "Remove the pie from the oven and slowly pour the custard, a tablespoon or two at a time, into the vent hole. Tip the pie gently in each direction to allow the custard to fill the whole pie.",
      "Bake in the center of the oven for another 30 minutes.",
      "Check for browning after the pie has been in for a total of 25 minutes and put on a foil frame, or use whatever other method you prefer, if necessary to prevent the edges of the crust from getting too dark.",
      "Allow the pie to sit for at least an hour before cutting. Shortly before serving, mix together the creme fraiche, 2 tablespoons of Grappa and sugar. Serve each slice with a generous spoonful.",
      "Enjoy!! ;o)",
      "N.B. I substitute a tablespoon of Grappa for one tablespoon of water in my pie crust. It works like a charm in my mother's old-fashioned hot-water crust recipe, which is included in my Fidget Pie recipe on food52.",
      "Also, if you don't care much for Grappa, you could use Armagnac in this instead, or brandy.",
      "About the figs: If you can't get fresh figs, used dried, but plump them up in a cup or so of smoky tea, made just as you made the tea for the prunes. Or, substitute another quarter pound of prunes.",
      "N.B.: The custard is adapted from that in the Apple and Custard Pie in Phyllo Pastry recipe in Susan G. Purdy's \"As Easy as Pie\" (Atheneum, 1984)"

      "Before slicing the peppers in half, take a look at them to determine the most sensible side to do this from - they need to sit flat on the tray. Pointed peppers tend to be sort of flat and wide - they have a narrower side which is where they are best sliced from. I find that if I lay one down so that it lies flat and then give it a quarter turn, that is the best place to slice them in half - it gives me two fairly stable and wide halves. After you have sliced them in half, remove the seeds and the white membrane but try and leave the stems on as they look rather pretty. If there are any rogue seeds, hold the pepper half over the sink, cut side facing down and give it a little tap or two with the flat of the knife and the seeds should fly out. Nestle the prepared peppers in a baking dish which will hold them snugly. The tin that I use is 7\" x 10\" (which is 26cm x 17cm) and comfortably holds 4 halves.",

Take a ball of dough from the plate, smear another tablespoon of butter on top of it, and gently press and spread it out into a paper-thin 12- or 13-inch square.

I roll it starting on first(widest) setting and end with the next to the last notch (#5) on my machine. Using a 3 inch biscuit cutter cut rounds of dough. Place a small amount of ricotta mixture in center, with fingertip wet the edge of the circle and press another round on top. Press to seal and place on sheet pan with floured tea towel keeping it covered while you are working on the other ravioli. After you are done refrigerate covered if you are not going to boil them right away.",

Add the shredded duck and keep warm on low heat.\r\nWhen water comes to a boil add some salt, add the ravioli and boil for approximately 5 minutes or until ravioli float to the top. Remove the ravioli with strainer. Place ravioli on serving platter top with the shredded duck and vegetables. I garnished with a little chopped parsley."

Be sure to heat the cooked chorizo for about two minutes, and the onions for about 2 minutes. Feel free to reheat them together for 5 minutes, if that's more convenient. \r\nIf you're serving lime crema, that can also be made in advance. Give it a good stir and test for salt right before serving. \r\nIf you're serving cheese, you can grate it up to 3 or 4 days in advance. \r\nIf serving rice, you can make that up to 4 days beforehand, or take some out of the freezer and warm it up, if you've got some already made.",
      "If you are prepping the chorizo ahead of time (cutting and microwaving), you can reserve the cooking liquid, chill it, remove and discard the fat that rises to the top, and use the liquid to replace part of the water to be added to the slow cooker. Heat it in the microwave to near boiling before adding to the pot."

      "A note about the tuna: Italian tuna packed in olive oil is heavenly. There are many brands available. Ortiz is heavenly; Roland offers a decent one. That said, I live in Montana. When I want pasta, I don't want it when Amazon or anyone else can get tuna to me. I'm happy to to stop into World Market and buy Tonnino yellowfin for $2.95 a can. \r\n\r\nAnd a note about the cheese. No, it is not traditional to serve fishy pastas with cheese. But if you have to have Parm with your pasta, by all means go ahead. Just use it sparingly.",
      "Start heating a large pot of generously salted water (it should taste like the ocean). This comes together fast. Good for evenings when you need dinner to almost make itself.",
      "I had this over a spaghetti that was more like what we consider bucatini, so if you can find bucatini, grab it. No delicate, frail pasta allowed. The pasta has a front and center seat here. It's not a mere conveyor of other flavors, it's right out there with its arms around them all. Pull out about 1/2 of it from the package. Check the cook time. Set a timer for 3 minutes less than the recommended cook time. Drop the pasta into the water and begin making the sauce. Multi-tasking necessary here: keep a set of tongs to hand to gently move the pasta around so that it doesn't sink and stick, and also to move the sauce ingredients about.",
      "Set a skillet over medium-high heat. It should be large enough to hold the sauce and pasta at the end. Force yourself to add 2 or 3 times as much good olive oil as you usually would.; we're not \"filming\" any pans here. This is all about the bold flavors of delicate ingredients. Use a good 5 ounces.",
      "When the oil is hot (it'll shimmer, or ribbon), add the halved tomatoes. They'll cook along quickly, releasing those precious juices to concentrate in all that lovely olive oil. If the skillet is too spattery, turn the heat down a bit. As the tomatoes begin to soften, add the garlic. When it's very fragrant, add the tuna and its oil. Break up any large chunks with a wooden spoon. Turn down the heat to a good simmer.",
      "When the timer goes off for the pasta, use tongs to lift it out of the boiling water and drop it directly into the skillet. Please trust me, it wants to be way more dente than al. It's going to cook some more in the skillet. Dip out a couple of good ladles of pasta water and add to the skillet. Move everything around and together with your tongs. Toss in the spinach and add the lemon juice. Move everything around until spinach is just wilted. Taste the sauce before you season to taste with salt and pepper. Use your tongs to lift pasta out onto plates. Divide any remaining sauce between them. Grate some good cheese over the top. Serve with slices of focaccia or baguette so that not one drop of sauce is left behind. You'll be a happier person for it.",
      "As noted, this all comes together very quickly, so be on your toes. Thank God I didn't have to make anything my first night in Florence, and thank heaven the daughter took me to it. It was worth the price of the entire trip to have tasted it. With my daughter. I was in heaven. George was on his own."

If you're short on time you could probably put the pot in an ice bath or something; otherwise, just do the pears and cream in advance and move on to the rest of the steps right before you want to bake. When the cream is cool you can strain out the ginger; pressing it a bit in a sieve will help get all the cream and more of the gingery flavor.",

Then, toss 2 tablespoons of them (reserving 1/2 tbsp for visual effect) in a blender or food processor with the sugar and pulse until they're in somewhat smaller pieces.

Then, add 1/4 c of the cream, the egg, and the pear chunks, and stir. It may seem crumbly and dry, but you don't need more liquid-just keep stirring until it is all dampened (the slight smushing of the pears adds moisture more gradually, you just have to wait for it). If you feel like you've been stirring forever and it's still crumbly, by all means, add more cream, but with the moisture from the pears it's easy to over-do on liquids so it's best to try and hold back a bit.",
      "Pat the dough out gently on a floured surface into a circle about 6 inches in diameter and cut it in 6 wedges (2 smaller rounds and 12 smaller wedges also works fine). If you like, you can lightly brush the tops with some of the extra cream sprinkle the tops with sugar. Set on a parchment-lined baking sheet with about 2 inches between scones (12 scones may take 2 trays) and bake at 375F until done. 6 scones took me about 30 minutes, and 12 scones, 20 minutes; ovens vary a lot, so just watch for gently browning on the bottoms.

While mixing the dough at a slow speed, slowly add water, a 1/8 cup at a time, but do not exceed 3/4 cup, until the dough comes together. Turn the speed to medium and continue mixing for about 5 minutes, until you have a smooth, elastic dough.",
      "Shape the dough into a ball, transfer to the oiled bowl, and cover the whole thing with a tea towel. Leave the dough until it has doubled in size, about 1 hour. While the dough rises, make a makeshift baguette tray -- unless you already have one. To make a baguette tray, find three paper towel holders (or roll up three kitchen towels) and place them equi-distance apart on a baking tray, then cover them with baking parchment. The two gaps between the rolls will form pockets to hold your dough as it rises, helping the baguettes keep their shape, as shown in the photo below.",
      "Once your dough has risen, tip the dough onto a floured work surface and cut it into two equal-sized pieces. Try not to knock too much air out -- this is what will create those lovely air pockets in your baguette.",
      "Gently flatten one piece of dough into an oblong shape and, starting at one end, fold one third into the center, then fold the other third so that they two ends meet in the middle without overlapping. Then, fold in half lengthwise, like a hot dog. Place the dough seam-side down and gently roll it out so that the ends taper slightly. Place it on the prepared baguette tray. Repeat with the second piece of dough.",
      "Preheat your oven to 425\u00b0 F (220\u00b0 C). Put the tray inside a clean plastic bag to keep it warm and leave to proof for an hour.",
      "When the baguettes have doubled in size, remove the tray from the plastic bag, and remove the rolls or tea towels, unless using a baguette tray. Score the tops with five diagonal cuts and bake for 20 minutes or until lightly golden -- you don't want too dark a color as you'll be baking them again with the garlic butter. Remove the bread from the oven and cool on a wire rack.",
      "While the baguettes are baking, make your garlic butter. In a medium bowl, use a fork to mash together the butter and garlic. Stir in the parsley until well combined, then shape the mixture into a cylinder 1 to 1/2 inches in diameter. Wrap in cling film and refrigerate until ready to use.",

      "Remove your garlic butter from the fridge, unwrap it,and cut it into thin slices. Wedge a slice between each slit in the bread, then loosely wrap each baguette in tin foil. Bake for 10 to 15 minutes, opening the foil for the last few minutes to crisp the top.",

For more golden crust and less fluffy stuffing underneath, use a 9 x 13-inch baking dish or larger. You can even bake it in a sheet pan if you are crazy about the crispy top.",

Add two tablespoons of butter or olive oil for sauteing the onion, celery and sage.\r\n\r\n- For a dairy-free version: replace the butter with olive oil and the milk with either unsweetened nut milk, additional stock or water.\r\n\r\n- For a gluten-free version: replace the bread with either gluten-free bread or 6 cups of cooked and cooled quinoa.",

Bring to a bare simmer and cook, covered, stirring occasionally until the chestnuts are very tender but not falling apart, about 40 minutes. If your chestnuts soak up a lot of the milk, add a bit more milk or water. If you are using store-bought, pre-cooked chestnuts, you will need to reduce the cook time. Drain the chestnuts, reserving the milk they were cooked in. When the chestnuts have cooled a bit, roughly chop them and add them to the bowl with the bread.",

Not too many nuts, or the balls might fall apart.",

If you're feeling adventurous, and are interested in adding more \"superfood\" type ingredients or simply want to up the flavor profile, mix a pinch or two or three of turmeric and/or other spices into the sugar before rolling. I used turmeric and a bit of Yemenite coffee spice that I bought in Israel -- a quick google search says it (Hawaji) is a mixture of ground cardamom, ginger, anise and fennel seeds. For easy rolling and storage, mix the sugar in the bottom half of a sealed storage container -- such as those plastic takeout dishes -- add the balls, put the top on, make sure the seal is tight and shake. Warning, though the tumeric and spices lift these out of the ordinary they give the balls a slight yellow-greenish color that's not quite as attractive as the plain ones. The upside is they are easily distinguishable from the plain if you want to make both. Enjoy!"

It should be at least 1.5 inches (4cm) high.",

Continue poaching over LOW heat for another 12 minutes or until potatoes are tender (but not falling apart).",

Cook over medium/low heat, moving the skillet around so the egg and potatoes distribute evenly. With a spatula, tuck in the borders, rounding the sides of the Tortilla, to get the typical rounded shape of the sides.",
      "When the top is set, the bottom should be golden brown - more or less 3 to 4 minutes. Put a flat plate or flat pan lid on top of the skillet and, holding with both hands, invert the skillet over the plate or lid. Carefully slide the Tortilla back into the skillet to cook the other side, always on medium/low heat. Tuck in the sides again for that typical round look and cook another 3 to 4 minutes.",

      "Tortilla keeps well for up to 1 day in fridge, covered with cling film.",
      "Enjoy with a glass of Sangria or a cold beer!",
      "Adding extra ingredients:\r\n\r\nThe extra ingredients are added a couple of minutes before the end of cooking the potatoes and onion, depending on the cooking time of the ingredient. \r\nSay you want to add chorizo, pepper and a little rosemary. \r\nCook the potatoes, then add the onion as per the recipe. \r\nTwo minutes before the end of the cooking time, add the chorizo, preferably sheddred, so it's easier to cut the Tortilla. When you beat the eggs, add the pepper and rosemary to the eggs. When the potatoes have strained and cooled, add them to the eggs and proceed as normal.\r\n\r\nIf the ingredient cooks quickly, saute it with the potatoes the last minute, to mix the flavors. If it's a vegetable that needs more cooking time, pre-cook or roast it and add it to the eggs with the potatoes. \r\n\r\nUse your judgment!"

Heat some sunflower or groundnut oil in a wok until smoking. Add the ginger and chilli, stir frying quickly for one minute until fragrant. Now add the choi sum stalks, along with the garlic, fish sauce, wine vinegar and light soy sauce. Stir fry for 2 minutes, when the stalks should have softened. Throw in the leaves with the dark soy sauce and toss together until the leaves have wilted.",

It will have shrunk slightly, which makes for tricky presentation, but the taste is worth it!",

This takes about 11 minutes, don't rush by turning your mixer too high.",
      "Fold in by hand with a spatula the almond flour, confectioner's sugar and cinnamon mixture. Once it is about 50% mixed drop in your pink food coloring. Keep folding until color is smooth (no streaks) and batter is fluffy but slightly holds it shape when dropped off the spatula. Spoon into a disposable pastry bag or gallon size storage bag with the zip cut off. Cut off the tip leaving a 1/2\" opening. You could also use a pastry tip with a similar size (but I don't have such fancy equipment ;)",
      "Pipe onto your parchment or silicone mat following your guide by squeezing firmly directly into the middle of the circle until it is full and about 1/4\" tall, then release and pull up on bag to release. If you cannot fit all your cookies on one tray, just leave the batter in the pastry bag set in a tall glass with the top folded over so you don't develop a skin on your batter. Very firmly whack your sheet tray on the counter five times to get rid of any air bubbles. Sprinkle the tops of half of your cookies with a pinch of aleppo pepper. Then let sit on the counter for about 20 minutes, to aid in developing a smooth shell. Turn on the oven to 200.",
      "Bake at 200 for 15 minutes, turning sheet halfway through. Then raise oven temperature to 350 and bake for 9-11 minutes. After about 4 minutes at the higher temperature, stick a wooden spoon in the door of the oven. This helps prevent over browning. Turn the sheet again if you notice any unevenness in browning or rise. The cookies are done when firm to the touch (with a shell) but with some inner give. Better to take them out a bit early than too late as a chewy cookie is better than crispy."

Sear without disturbing for about 3 minutes or until nicely browned, then flip and repeat on the other side. Season to taste with salt and pepper. (Repeat the process with any remaining mushrooms.) Return the full batch of mushrooms to the skillet and stir to combine. Lower the heat and add butter, Italian seasoning, and balsamic vinegar. Cook for another minute, stirring well. Remove skillet from heat and adjust seasoning and acidity, to taste.",

On a large platter or individual plates, spread an even layer of whipped ricotta, going close to the edges so some of it will peek out. Top with fregola salad. Serve warm or at room temperature."

      "Meanwhile, wash the chicories. I like to tear chicories into large, two- or three-bite pieces after removing the root end with a knife. For the frisee, trim the darkest green parts and the root, and then separate all of the leaves into the chicory mix and wash and spin together. The flavor of frisee is more delicate than the bitter chicory, and its structure will provide a little lift to the salad. Wash and spin it all, and place in a large bowl with the croutons.",
      "Now, get to preparing the olive oil for poaching. The smaller the pot you can find, the less olive oil you'll need to use. Add enough oil so that the egg you drop in will be completely submerged.",
      "Drop in two garlic cloves and a few black peppercorns, and heat the oil over low heat to 140\u00b0 F. If you don't have a thermometer, carefully use your finger to gauge how hot the oil is, starting when it's still at room temperature. You should be totally comfortable leaving your finger in the oil for a few moments when it's at 140\u00b0F. If the idea of dipping your finger into a pot of oil scares the bejeesus out of you (totally understandable), then try dropping one of the croutons in. Barely any bubbles should appear. If there is serious bubbling, the oil is too hot. Turn off the heat and wait for the temperature to drop.",
      "Before you start to fry, have a slotted spoon and a plate lined with a clean towel ready. Depending on the size of your pot, you'll be able to cook the eggs one or two at a time. When the oil is ready, gently crack the eggs into coffee cups and slip them in. Cook for about 2 minutes, or until the whites are set, then remove from oil and place on landing pad. If they stick to the bottom of the pot, use a metal spatula to gently release them.",
      "When the eggs are done, use 1/2 cup of the oil to make a vinaigrette. Smash the remaining garlic with the side of your knife, and drop it into the oil, then add a healthy pinch of salt and 2 tablespoons red wine vinegar. Whisk to combine, and adjust with salt and more vinegar as needed, remembering that the chicories will want a healthy dose of acid to balance out their bitterness.",
      "Toss the chicories, croutons, Parmesan cheese, freshly cracked black pepper and enough warm vinaigrette to coat generously. Adjust salt and acid as needed. Then, heap generous piles of salad on 4 plates, place an egg on top of each pile, and sprinkle with sea salt and cracked black pepper. Carefully lay a slice of speck over each egg and serve immediately.",

Remove the neck and giblets from the duck, rinse him and pat him dry. Cut the top off the bulb of garlic. Salt the duck inside then put the garlic inside. Prick him all over with a sharp fork - pierce the skin but not the meat. Sprinkle him all over with salt and paprika, tuck his wings behind his back (I got a one armed duck so he only had one tucked). Spray the rack of your roasting pan or wipe it with oil, and put the duck on breast side down. Throw the neck in the pan too. Put him in the oven.",
      "Put the flour in a baking dish - I just use a 9x13 black metal one. I also do 4 cups at a time, you will use 1/2 cup for the gumbo and the rest can go in a jar in the pantry for future rouxs and gravies. Put the flour in the oven too. For 3 30 minute intervals pull out the flour and stir it, and re-poke the duck skin with a fork. After the third time (you are an hour and a half in now) flip the duck over and repeat - 3 more 30 minute intervals with flour stirring and skin poking at the end of each one.",
      "NOW - turn the oven up to 350. The duck is going to roast for another 30 minutes until it is nice and brown. Then pull him out and set him aside to cool. Put the andouille links on a cookie sheet (I spritz with no stick) and into the oven. After about 10 or 15 minutes flip them - they should be browning and spattering. Give them a little poke with the fork too to let out some of the fat. Stir the flour and cook 10 or 15 more minutes, Pull the andouille out, and stir the flour. Put the duck and andouille on a big cutting board where you can process them and let them cool all the way. Chop the veggies while you wait and stir that flour every 10 or 15 minutes until it is a nice toasty brown. You won't think it's dark enough but when you add it to the oil in awhile it will be. I am attaching a photo of what you are looking for.",

Break down the duck - this is what I do - first, pull off the breast skin which will still be a little soft - SAVE IT. Then I get a stock pot and literally pull the meat off with my hands and rip it up and throw the bones in the stock pot (duck and grilled steak bone stock is awesome). I pick what I can off the neck and add that to the duck pile and throw the neck bones in the stock pot. It's all completey barbarian. But it's fun.",
      "Wash your hands. Put vegetable oil and 1/2 c toasted flour in the gumbo pot on medium heat. Stir until it's hot - see how dark it got? Once it's hot add the onions and stir for a 2-3 minutes. Add the celery, peppers and garlic and cook for a few more minutes. Add the broth and the beer. It's going to look odd and lumpy - never fear it will smooth out as it simmers and you stir. Bring it to a simmer, then add the spices EXCEPT the gumbo file - that goes in last. Also, start with 1/2 tsp of cayenne and then taste it in about 15 minutes for heat. You can always add more.",
      "Add the duck and the sausage and the vinegar. Let the pot simmer away - now is a good time to clean the kitchen a bit. You could probably use a beer or a glass of wine or a giant iced tea. Cook the rice, too. Chop up the green onion. The gumbo is best if you can give it an hour to simmer on low, so do other stuff. Taste it now and then to see if it needs salt or cayenne.",
      "You are almost done! Now for a little lagniappe - get the duck skin and cut it up into small pieces. Fry it in a heavy skillet on medium heat until it is very brown and crispy. Drain it on to paper towels ... try not to eat it all right then. Now, right before serving, turn the heat up a bit and stir in the gumbo file.",

      "Prepare the veg: Heat the oven to 400F. While you're waiting it for it to warm, scrub the radishes clean and trim the ends. Peel the sweet potato. Dice both into small, bite-sized pieces. Toss them with a few healthy glugs of olive oil, salt and pepper.",
      "Move the cubed radishes and sweet potatoes onto a baking sheet, and then move the baking sheet to the oven. Bake the vegetables for 30-35 minutes, tossing the vegetables every 10 minutes or so as you go, until they are very soft inside and partly blackened on the outside. Set the vegetables aside.",
      "Prepare the lentils: Like you would with beans, pick over the lentils, and remove any rocks or bits that shouldn't be there. Rinse the lentils, and then move them to a pot with 2.5 cups of water. Smash one of the garlic cloves, and add that to the water, along with the bay leaf.",
      "Turn the range to medium high, and let the water come to a boil. Once it does, reduce the heat to a simmer. The lentils will take anywhere from 20 minutes - 1 hour to cook, and you will likely need to add more water to the pot during cooking time. The lentils are done when they are softened and chewable. Strain the lentils, and add salt to taste.",
      "Prepare the shallots: Remove the skins from the shallots, and then slice them thinly crosswise, into rings. Meanwhile, heat a few tablespoons of olive oil in a pan over medium heat. When the oil is warm, add the shallots. Stir as you go: you don't want the oil so hot that the shallots burn too quickly. You want the oil just hotter than if you were sauteing until transparent. This time, cook them past transparency, until they are soft (but browned) in some parts, and crisp in others, about 7-9 minutes. Turn the heat off, and set the shallots aside.",
      "Make the vinaigrette: Spoon the Dijon into a small bowl. Run the remaining garlic clove through a microplane, and add this to the bowl. (I find this helps soften the harshness of fresh garlic. If you do not have a microplane, you can simply mince the garlic finely, and run some water over it.) Add a pinch of salt and pepper to the bowl, along with the sherry vinegar. Give everything a stir, to combine and to help dissolve the salt. Add the Meyer lemon juice and zest, and stir again. Finally, drizzle in 1/4 cup olive oil, whisking as you go to emulsify.",
      "In a large bowl, mix together the radishes, the sweet potatoes, the lentils, and the shallots. Gently fold in the vinaigrette. At this point, I used a vegetable peeler to shave ricotta salata on top; add as much as you like. Add the pepitas. Stir gently to incorporate all the ingredients.",
      "You can eat the salad right away, or wait a few hours. It is good warm or cold."

Continue cooking and when the sugar is dissolved, swirl the pan occasionally until the mixture is an amber-caramel color, about 3 minutes. Carefully add the 1 cup of the fresh blueberries.

In another bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, ricotta, sugar, the 4 Tbs. butter and the vanilla. Pour the wet mixture into the well of the flour mixture and, using a rubber spatula or a large spoon, stir until just combined. You will see plenty of small lumps, which is a sign that the batter has not been overworked. Let the batter rest for about 5 minutes before cooking.",

If you end up with a bare spot on the cake side, use a hand to scoop glaze from the sheet pan and gently ease it onto the bare spot-do all of this while the glaze and chocolate are all still warm and fluid.

      "Make the dough the day before you want to make the rolls. In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the dough hook, mix the flour, sugar, yeast, and salt to combine.",
      "Add the eggs and milk and mix on low speed until the mixture forms a ball around the hook, about 4 minutes. Increase the speed to medium and mix until the dough is very smooth, 5 more minutes.",
      "Continue mixing the dough on medium speed and add the butter 1 tablespoon at a time, mixing well to incorporate after each addition. All of the butter should be added over about 3 minutes of mixing.",
      "Transfer the dough to a large, oiled bowl and let rise at room temperature, covered, for 1 to 1 1/2 hours. The dough is very enriched, so it may not expand much.",
      "While the dough rises, prepare the peach butter. In a large pot, combine the peaches, sugar, honey, vanilla bean, cinnamon, nutmeg, salt, and vinegar. Heat the mixture, stirring occasionally, until the peaches are very tender and begin to break down, about 25 to 30 minutes. Remove the vanilla bean and discard.",
      "Use a hand blender, blender, or food processor to process the mixture until it's smooth, then return to the pot and continue to cook until the mixture thickens slightly, 30 to 45 minutes more. Stir in the almond extract, if using. Refrigerate overnight.",
      "Transfer the dough to a parchment-lined baking sheet and pat out into a rectangle with about 1-inch thickness. Cover directly with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight.",
      "The next day, preheat the oven to 375\u00b0 F. Grease a large casserole or 9 x 13-inch baking dish generously with softened butter.",
      "Lightly flour your work surface, then turn the dough out onto it. Remove the parchment from the dough, and flour the top surface of the dough. If the dough feels particularly sticky (sometimes in the summer it can give you a little trouble since it's so rich and buttery!), you can pat it out on parchment paper. Use your hands to pat out the dough into a rectangle about 1/2-inch thick (it should be about 10 x 15 inches). If the dough feels really soft at this point, refrigerate it to firm it up before proceeding (5 to 10 minutes).",
      "In a medium bowl, whisk the chilled peach butter with the 1/3 cup flour to combine. Spread the filling in an even layer all over the dough-all the way to the edges!",
      "Starting with one of the long sides, begin to roll the dough into a tight spiral (if you're using parchment, you can use it to help you roll the dough up, too). Use your thumbs to prop the dough off the work surface and use your fingers to keep the roll tight while you work. If the dough feels really soft at this point, you can refrigerate it again before slicing (10 to 15 minutes).",
      "Slice the finished roll into 9 even pieces (these are big rolls). Arrange the rolls inside the prepared baking dish, leaving about 1/4 inch between each one. Cover the rolls loosely with plastic wrap or a clean kitchen towel and let rise in a warm place for about 30 minutes.",
      "Brush the top of the rolls with egg wash and bake until they are golden on the surface and the filling is bubbly, about 35 to 40 minutes.",
      "While the rolls bake, whisk the powdered sugar, cream, and vanilla to combine.",
      "When the rolls are baked, let them cool for 10 to 15 minutes, then spread or drizzle the icing on top. Serve warm."
