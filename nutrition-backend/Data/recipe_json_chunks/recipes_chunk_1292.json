A few at a time, place the chiles on the griddle and let them heat, turning occasionally with tongs, just until any clinging moisture is evaporated and the aroma is released. Allow approximately 30 to 45 seconds in all per chile for most kinds, slightly less for guajillos (which are very thin-skinned). The chiles should just become dry, hot, and fragrant; do not allow them to start really roasting or they will have a terrible scorched flavor. Remove from the griddle and place in a deep bowl as they are done, cover with boiling water, and let soak for at least 20 minutes.",

For Garlic and onions, cook, turning frequently until somewhat softened - about 15 to 20 minutes for the onion, and 8 minutes for garlic. Remove from the griddle to a bowl as they are done in order to catch any juices that escape. When cool, peel or remove husks over the bowl to catch the juices.",

Add one cup of hot chicken broth and stir, constantly, until liquid is almost fully absorbed. Repeat this process until you have added six cups of broth. In the meantime, bring a medium sized pot of water to a boil and cook the shrimp for two to three minutes, or until just slightly pink. Drain and set shrimp aside. When the six cups of broth have been added, toss in the shrimp, spinach and a seventh cup of broth. Stir until the broth is 3/4 of the way absorbed. The risotto should be thick with a slightly soupy base. Remove from heat. Spoon into shallow bowls and sprinkle with three to four teaspoons of the grated cheese. Serve immediately."

When done add a large glass of marsala wine and keep moving the pan to soak all slices well. Be careful, the wine might catch fire so keep your face away! Don't worry though, flambee slices will be even more tasty! After 2 minutes approx. turn the fire off, add salt and pepper. Serve hot. If there is enough butter juice from the meat you may use it as condiment for the salad so you won't need to use olive oil...enjoy!"

      "Preheat the oven to 500 and place a rack in the lowest slot in the oven. Line a baking sheet with parchment. Peel the butternut squash, cut in half lengthwise and remove the seeds. Cut each squash half in half widthwise, right where the slender part curves out to the bulge. Cut each quarter into about 1 inch wedges (see picture) and place in a bowl. Toss squash with olive oil, sugar, salt, and cayenne. Place in a single layer on baking sheet. Roast for 10-15 minutes until caramelized. Remove from oven and flip over. Bake another 10-15 minutes until caramelized on the other side and cooked through. The pieces on the edges of the baking sheet will caramelize first so you want to move around during the baking time. While the squash is roasting, make the pesto: (1) warm 3 TB olive oil, sage, and garlic in a small pan over very low heat just until the oil bubbles. Pour in a small bowl, reserving the garlic clove. (2) Place the toasted hazelnuts in mini food processor along with the garlic clove and process until a fine crumble and add to the bowl (alternatively, you can do by hand or in a mortar and pestle). (3) add the cheese to the bowl along with 1-2 TB more olive oil and stir until combined and salt to taste. This is not a traditional pesto - more nutty than herby and not so much oil. Once the squash is roasted, place in a large bowl and toss with pesto to taste. Dig in."

    "ingredients": [],

      "Sprinkle the yeast over the warm water in the bowl of a stand mixer or in a large bowl. Add the barley malt syrup, stirring until it is dissolved. Allow the yeast to bloom until it is foamy, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in the flour, beer, butter, and salt and continue stirring to form a shaggy mass. Attach the bowl and the dough hook to the stand mixer and begin kneading on medium-low speed. After about 1 minute the dough will form a smooth ball. The dough should be quite firm and may be slightly tacky, but not sticky. (If it is sticky, add a little more flour, about 1 tbsp at a time, and knead it in until the dough is smooth. If the dough is too dry to come together, add more water, 1 tsp at a time.) Continue kneading the dough on medium-low speed until it is elastic, 5 to 7 minutes. Alternatively, turn the shaggy dough out onto an unfloured work surface and knead it by hand.",
      "Choose a bowl that will be large enough to contain the dough after it has doubled in size, and grease it lightly with butter. Transfer the dough to the greased bowl and cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap. Put the dough in the refrigerator to rise for at least 8 hours, and up to 24 hours, for optimal flavor.",
      "For quick pretzels, allow the dough to rise at room temperature (in a warm spot) until it has doubled in size, about 1 1/2 hours.",
      "Line two 12-by-17-in/30.5-by-43-cm rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper; set aside.",
      "Turn the dough out onto an unfloured work surface and firmly press it down to deflate. To form the classic pretzel shape, cut the dough into eight equal portions. Work with one piece of dough at a time and keep the rest covered with a damp, clean kitchen towel. Pat a piece of dough down with your fingertips to form a rough rectangle about 3 1/2 by 5 1/2 in/9 by 14 cm. Beginning on a long side, roll the dough up tightly, forming it into a little loaf. Pinch the seam together. Shape the dough into a rope by rolling it against the work surface with your palms and applying mild pressure, working from the center of the dough out to the ends. If you need more friction, spray the counter with a little water from a squirt bottle or drizzle a few drops of water and spread it with your hand. Once you can feel that the dough rope doesn't want to stretch any farther (usually when it is between 12 to 16 in/30.5 to 40.5 cm long), set it aside to rest and begin shaping another piece in the same manner. Repeat this process with the remaining pieces of dough.",
      "Return to the first dough rope and continue rolling it out to a length of 24 to 28 in/61 to 71 cm, leaving the center about 1 in/2.5 cm in diameter and tapering the ends thinly by applying a little more pressure as you work your way out. Position the dough rope into a U shape, with the ends pointing away from you. Holding an end in each hand, cross the ends about 3 in/7.5 cm from the tips and then cross them again. Fold the ends down and press them into the U at about 4 and 8 o'clock, allowing about 1/4 in/6 mm of the ends to overhang. Place the pretzel on one of the prepared baking sheets and cover it with a damp towel. Repeat this process with the remaining dough, spacing out the pretzels on the baking sheets at least 1 in/2.5 cm apart and covering them with a damp towel.",
      "Allow the covered pretzels to rise at warm room temperature until they have increased in size by about half, 20 to 30 minutes. (The pretzels can be refrigerated at this point, covered tightly with plastic wrap, for up to 8 hours before dipping and baking them.)",
      "At least 20 minutes before baking, position one rack in the upper third and another rack in the lower third of the oven and preheat it to 500\u00b0F/260\u00b0C/gas 10.",
      "Prepare the lye solution or",
      ".",
      "Use a large skimmer to gently dip the pretzels in the lye or baked baking soda solution, one or two at a time. Leave them in the solution for about 20 seconds, carefully turning once after 10 seconds. Remove the pretzels from the liquid, drain, and return them to the baking sheets, spacing them at least 1 in/2.5 cm apart. If the ends come detached, simply reposition them. Repeat with the remaining pretzels.",
      "Use a sharp paring knife or razor blade to cut a slit about 1/4 in/6 mm deep in the thickest part of each pretzel (the bottom of the U). Top them as you choose, if desired. Bake the pretzels until they are deep mahogany in color, 8 to 12 minutes, rotating the pans from front to back and top to bottom halfway through the baking time. Transfer the pretzels to a rack to cool for 10 minutes before serving. The pretzels are best enjoyed the day they are made, ideally warm from the oven or within an hour of being baked.",
      "To store the pretzels, allow them to cool completely and then wrap each one individually in plastic wrap. Store them at room temperature for up to 2 days, or put the plastic-wrapped pretzels in a resealable plastic freezer bag and freeze them for up to 1 month. Reheat the pretzels in a 350\u00b0F/180\u00b0C/gas 4 oven for about 5 minutes, or for 10 to 12 minutes if frozen."

It is best to refrigerate mixture overnight or for at least 6 hours.",

A variation on this recipe is to make tostados with soft tortillas and melt your favorite cheese over the top. Just add a tall glass of frosty iced tea or lemonade to make this meal complete. You can't miss with this one. I consider this one singles friendly."

Add eggs one at a time, beating after each; mix in dry ingredients. Form dough into a disk; halve. Roll each half on a floured work surface until 1/4\" thick; chill. Cut out 11/2\"-wide diamonds from dough; transfer to paper-lined rimmed baking sheets. Bake until golden, 12-15 minutes. Meanwhile, boil honey and 1/3 cup water in a saucepan. Place all cookies in a single layer on one of the baking sheets; pour over honey. Let sit for 10 minutes before serving."
