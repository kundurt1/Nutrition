      "Heat a small heavy skillet over medium heat.",
      "Add in the cumin seeds, and when they begin to color, add in the oregano leaves, shaking the pan frequently so the herbs do not scorch.",
      "As soon as the fragrance is strong and robust, remove the pan from the heat and add in the paprika and the cayenne.",
      "Give everything a quick stir; then remove from the pan-the paprika and the cayenne only need a few seconds to toast.",
      "Grind in a mortar or possibly a spice mill to make a coarse pwdr.",

      "Prepare the garnishes.",
      "If you are using fresh green chiles, roast them over a flame till they are proportionately charred.",
      "Let them steam 10 min in a bowl covered with a dish; then scrape off the skins, throw away the seeds, and dice.",

      "I do know which the operative word in bitter melon is \"bitter.\"",
      "It has a very pungent taste which takes some getting used to.",
      "But in a vegetable stew such as Pinakbet it really provides a fabulous mix of flavors, when combined with blander (see recipe) vegetables such as okra and eggplant.",
      "Another good way to cook bitter melon is to slice it into 1/4 inch slices",
      "(after it has been cut in half lengthwise and seeded) and then sauteed briefly with sliced onions and tomatoes to that are added scrambled Large eggs and other seasonings to taste.",
      "This is actually my favorite way to eat it."

      "Combine the seed powders and the whole sesame seeds, rye flour, salt, vegetable oil, honey, and water in a mixing bowl.",
      "If using a mixer, use the paddle attachment and mix on slow speed for 1 to 2 minutes.",
      "If mixing by hand, use a large, sturdy spoon and stir for 1 or 2 minutes.",
      "The dough should quickly form a firm ball and shouldnt be sticky.",
      "Stir in flour or water as needed to adjust the texture.",
      "Transfer the dough to a lightly floured work surface and knead for about 30 seconds to be sure all of the ingredients are evenly distributed and that the dough holds together.",
      "It should be slightly tacky but not sticky.",
      "Preheat the oven to 300F (149C), or 275F (135C) for a convection oven, and prepare 1 baking sheet for each quarter of the dough that you plan to bake, lining them with parchment paper or a silicone mat.",
      "You dont need to oil the paper or liner.",
      "Divide the dough into four equal pieces.",
      "(For any that you wont be baking right away, wrap them well, and refrigerate for up to 1 week or freeze for up to 3 months; the flavor actually improves after a day or two in the refrigerator.)",
      "Use a rolling pin to roll out one portion of the dough on a floured work surface, frequently lifting the dough with a metal pastry scraper or bowl scraper to be sure it isnt sticking and dusting with more flour underneath if need be.",
      "You can also flip the dough over and continue rolling with the bottom side up.",
      "The goal is to roll it to about 1/16 inch in thickness.",
      "If the dough resists, gently set it aside and begin rolling out another piece, or let it rest for about 2 minutes.",
      "When you return to it, it will roll more easily.",
      "Brush the surface of the dough with an even coating of whichever wash you prefer, then sprinkle the surface with whatever garnishes you like (see the variations below).",
      "Use a pizza cutter to cut the rolled dough into rectangles, diamonds, or other shapes.",
      "You can also use a small biscuit cutter dipped in flour to make round crackers, but this takes longer, and then you have leftover dough.",
      "The crackers need not all be the same size.",
      "Transfer the crackers to the prepared pan.",
      "They can be nearly touching, as they wont spread or rise.",
      "If making more than one pan of crackers, you can bake them all at once.",
      "Place the pans on different shelves and bake for 10 minutes, then rotate the pans and bake for another 10 minutes.",
      "Rotate the pans once more and continue baking until theyre donetypically 25 to 30 minutes altogether, but it depends on how thin you roll them and on your oven.",
      "The crackers are done when they have a rich golden brown color and are fairly dry and crisp.",
      "Leave them on the pans to cool so theyll crisp up even more.",
      "To get a little more browning on the crackers, increase the heat to 325F (163C) after theyve dried sufficiently to be crisp (20 to 25 minutes).",
      "If they dont snap cleanly after they cool, return the pan to a hot oven for a few more minutes until they dry sufficiently to snap when broken.",
      "Cool for at least 15 minutes before serving.",
      "Once thoroughly cooled, the crackers can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for about 8 days, or in a ziplock bag in the freezer indefinitely.",
      "Sesame seeds and poppy seeds are the best garnishing seeds because theyre light, and because their flavor isnt so strong that theyll overpower the taste of the cracker, as something like cumin or anise seeds would.",
      "Flaxseeds are a little too hard to chew, especially when baked on top of crackers, but some people do like them as a garnish.",
      "Other savory garnishes include garlic salt, lemon pepper, and other common spice blends and rubs.",
      "You can make wonderful toppings by combining herbs and oil, such as herbes de Provence covered with just enough oil to make a paste.",
      "In this case, dont use a glaze; simply brush the oil on the cracker dough just prior to baking.",
      "Flavored herb and garlic oils can also be brushed onto the crackers as soon as they come out of the oven, to shine them up and add flavor.",
      "If you try this, return the crackers to the oven for 5 minutes more to set the glaze.",
      "This recipe uses rye flour for a unique flavor, but you can substitute either regular whole wheat flour or the newly popular white whole wheat flour, which is a lighter color and has a slightly sweeter, less bitter flavor than traditional red wheat.",
      "You can also use all-purpose flour if you prefer a lighter cracker, and reduce the water by 1 tablespoon for every 2 ounces of white flour that you substitute.",
      "To make the garnishes stick to the dough, you need either an egg white wash for savory crackers or a sweet wash for seeds or a sweet garnish.",
      "To make the egg wash, whisk 1 egg white with 2 tablespoons of water.",
      "To make the sweet wash, whisk 1 tablespoon of honey or agave nectar with 3 tablespoons of water."
