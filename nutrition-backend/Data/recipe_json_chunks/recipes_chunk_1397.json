      "I used a mortar and pestle to make the pistou, on the advice of a well-known Mediterranean slow food chef, not to identify anyone. I found it to be a miserable, time-consuming experience and wouldn't wish it upon anyone; the basil took forever to mash, and I had to pound each little piece of garlic into submission in order to get it smaller. I ended up just chopping everything into smaller pieces anyway and then transferring them to the mortar and pestle. However, it did produce an interesting thick, pasty pistou and was enjoyable to eat. But I'm pretty sure that you could produce something pretty similar in a food processor and it would be much more efficient. To make the pistou, you combine everything together and mash it up. If you choose to use a mortar and pestle, you can try pretending that you are a rustic from the south of France and you never measure anything. Maybe that will make the process more enjoyable.",
      "I was a little more precise with my measurements in this half of the recipe because this is what I used, but you can use whatever quantities you like in yours. You can adjust the color profile easily by adding a little here or subtracting a little there. Either way, the spread is going to be beautiful! If using dry beans, soak in water overnight or for at least 3 hours before using. After soaking, rinse beans, pour into large pot and cover with water. Bring to a boil and then simmer for 30 minutes or until beans are soft, but not mushy. Drain and set aside.",
      "While beans are simmering peel and chop onions and carrots into medium, but equal sized pieces. Chop red pepper, zucchini into same-sized pieces. Remove any stems from the green and wax beans and cut on bias. Chop tomatoes into medium-sized cubes.",

Add zucchini and red peppers, and green and wax beans and saute for 5 minutes. Then add tomato, vegetable stock, and herbes de provence. Let simmer for 10 minutes, or until carrots are tender, but not mushy. I used homemade veggie stock that I had saved in my freezer in convenient little veggie ice cubes. I strongly disadvise using store-bought veggie stock as I have found it to be mostly terrible. I used a variation of the recipe found at Veganyumyum, a popular vegan recipe blog.

      "Pour the stock and soy sauce into a 1 1/2 quart sauce pan and heat to a simmer. Place 12 inch cast iron enamel coated skillet over high heat and add the canola oil. Once it is hot add the rice and stir thoroughly coating the grains with oil. I cooked them until a few of the grains became lightly toasted. Watch out for this next step because there is a good chance the stock will splatter when it hits the hot pan. Add a cup of hot stock to the rice. Stir the rice and reduce the heat to medium. Add a 1/2 cup more of stock and continue to stir the rice. Continue to cook only adding more stock as the rice starts to become dry. Only add enough stock to be even with the level of the rice. It is important to stir the rice almost continually. This coaxes out the starch and keeps it from burning. It takes about 17 to 20 minutes to finish cooking depending on your rice. Near the end of the cooking process add the edamame to heat them through. Once the rice is al dente add the miso butter and pine nuts and stir until the miso butter has melted into the rice. Ladle a nice sized portion into the middle of a warm plate and top with the bacon, chives and just a little red pepper. Drizzle a few drops of sesame oil over it and serve."

Fill 3/4 of a ladle spoon with the batter and pour it over a corner of the griddle.

      "Add the yeast, milk, butter, sugar, cardamom, nutmeg, grated orange zest, and 2 1/2 cups of flour to the bowl of a stand mixer that's fitted with the paddle attachment. Beat until everything comes together in a smooth batter--2-3 minutes. Turn off the mixer, cover the bowl loosely with a towel, and let stand for 10 minutes.",
      "After 10 minutes is up, switch the paddle attachment to the dough hook, add the salt and enough additional flour to make a soft dough. Knead for 8-10 minutes on a low speed, until the dough is satiny smooth, elastic, and pulls away from the sides of the bowl, adding more flour by the tbsp as needed.",
      "Place dough in a large greased bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Let rise in a warm draft-free place until doubled--90 minutes or so if you're using the SAF Gold yeast, 2 - 3 hrs otherwise.",
      "Punch down the dough. At this point, you can go either of two ways--the easy, fast way that results in some burned fruit/nuts poking out of the stollen's crust, which you'll want to remove before coating with the sugar topping--or the slightly fiddly way of preventing burned fruit and nuts. For the easy way, knead the fruit, nuts, and whatever rum is left in the bowl into the punched-down dough, and shape it into three oval loaves. You can skip the next step.",
      "For the fiddly way, you're going to divide the dough into fruited and plain portions, then cover the fruited dough with the plain. To start, set aside 1/3 of your punched down dough. Add the fruits, nuts, and any remaining rum in the fruit bowl to the remaining 2/3 of the dough and knead to combine. Divide the fruited dough into 3 equal pieces and shape them into ovals. Divide the plain dough into three equal pieces, and roll each one into a thin sheet large enough to completely cover the fruited loaf. Drape the dough sheets over the fruited center, then flip the loaves and cover the bottoms, pinching the seams of the plain dough closed. Flip the loaves right-side up again and firmly shape them into their final oval forms, pressing to make sure that the plain dough is adhered to the fruited dough and you don't have any air pockets between them.",
      "Set the shaped loaves on a parchment lined sheet pan and drape them with plastic or a damp towel to keep them from drying out as they rise. Let them sit in a warm, draft free spot until roughly doubled in size. This should take an hour or so if you used yeast formulated for high sugar dough, or 90 minutes to two hours if you used regular yeast.",
      "When the loaves are nearly risen, preheat the oven to 300 degrees.",
      "Bake the loaves for 1 1/2 - 2 hrs, until golden brown and baked through. Keep an eye on them. If, at the 1 hr mark, They are already well-browned, turn the oven down 25 degrees. Very light gold at that point means the oven temp is probably good as is. You're shooting for an internal temp of 190 degrees. Use an instant-read thermometer to make sure, otherwise it's nearly impossible to know whether the stollen is completely cooked in the center (Don't worry about the holes from taking the loaves' temps--they'll get covered up with sugar coating in a later step.).",
      "Cool the stollen on a rack. As they're cooling, prepare the sugar topping.",
      "Set up your stollen-topping station by lining a large sheet pan with a sheet of parchment and setting a cooling rack inside the sheet pan--this keeps the mess to a minimum. Carefully move the stollen to the topping station.",
      "Mix the brown sugar and confectioner's sugar until thoroughly combined.",
      "Melt the butter, and brush the stollens generously with it. The stollens should still be a bit warm when you do this, but don't do it straight out of the oven--the bread is too delicate and the loaves will break.",
      "Use a sieve to sift the sugars in a generous coating all over the buttered stollen.",
      "Let the stollen cool completely, then wrap tightly for storage. I vacuum seal mine, stopping the sealer just before it sucks all the air out of the storage bag and crushes the bread. They freeze well if carefully wrapped--just let them thaw overnight before you eat them."

      "TO MAKE THE FILLING: Heat up the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add the anchovies and break them apart with a wooden spoon, and cook until they've melted into the oil. Add the minced garlic and cook until fragrant. Turn off the heat and let the mixture cool down completely. In a food-processor, puree 4 1/2 ounces (about 130 grams) of shrimp with ground pork, fat-slabs, and cornstarch into a smooth paste. Then add the remaining 6 ounces of shrimp and pulse just a few times until they are cut into large chunks. (Careful not to over-chop them because you want large pieces of shrimps throughout.) Transfer to a large bowl and add the cooled anchovy/garlic oil, grated ginger, diced scallions, fish sauce, and ground white pepper. Mix until evenly incorporated.\r\n\r\nYou can make the filling the day ahead, covered with plastic wrap and kept refrigerated.",
      "Slice the baguette very thinly with a serrated knife, about 1/8-inch thick. Fill a generous amount of the shrimp filling in between two slices of baguette (I'd say the ratio between the bread and the filling is 1:2), and press it gently to help the bread stick to the filling. Repeat until you're finished with all the fillings. Smear a good, shameless layer of unsalted butter on both sides of the toasts, and sprinkle lots of white sesame seeds on both sides.",
      "Heat up a large, flat-bottomed skillet over medium heat. Cook the toasts until golden brown on both sides, and until the filling is just cooked through. Careful not to over-heat the skillet -- if you do, the bread will burn before the filling's cooked.\r\n\r\nServe the hot, crispy, and buttery shrimp toasts with a few wedges of lemon."

    "directions": [
      "Start by cooking the pinto beans according to package directions: soak them overnight, or boil and do a quick 1-hour soak, and then simmer them in fresh water until they're almost cooked. You can buy canned beans and skip this step, but if you have time, I tend to prefer dried to canned. If using canned, just rinse the beans before you add them (later on); if you cook dried beans, once they're at the almost-cooked stage, drain them to stop them from getting mushy while you cook the veggies, but save the cooking liquid.",
      "Take out a big soup pot and heat the olive oil in it. When it's hot, add the onion and garlic and saute for a few minutes; when the onion gets soft, add the parsley and stir. Then, dump in the carrots, sweet pepper, and tomatoes. Break the bay leaves in half and throw them in, too. Watch until the tomato juice heats up and starts to bubble, and then let it all cook for 3 or 4 more minutes to start the carrots softening.",
      "To the tomato-y base, add bean cooking liquid (or a cup or two of water or stock, if you used canned beans) and let it all come back to a boil. Then, with the heat up high, add the turnip greens by the handful, stirring them in and waiting for each handful to begin to collapse before adding the next. It may take a while to incorporate all the greens, and you may need to add more liquid to the pot to make sure they're all covered; go ahead and add what you need. Once they're all in, stir in the cooked pinto beans, bring the whole pot back to a boil, and then turn the heat down to a simmer level. Taste for salt and pepper, and adjust the seasoning to your liking. I find the amount of salt I add often depends on the brand of canned tomatoes I use, but it's a safe bet that you'll need to add *some* salt. Stir in the lemon juice now, too.",
      "Simmer the stew, stirring occasionally, until the carrots are tender and the liquid is as reduced as you like. Serve hot, maybe with a poached egg on top or some toast on the side. I find that the leftovers, reheated or just eaten cold, get better and better throughout the week, too."

      "Grinding your own meat: For meatballs, you want to use light, airy, delicate ground meat, which is why I like to grind it myself. Often the ground meat you see on supermarket shelves is already over-mixed, paste-like and sticky. You can use either a dedicated meat grinder or the attachment for your stand mixer. Before I form my meatballs, I like to roll a tester and fry it in a pan to check the seasoning (and because it makes a nice little snack).",
      "Put the lamb in a large mixing bowl, cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and pop it into the freezer until the edges get crunchy, about 1 hour.",
      "Toss the lamb well with the salt, then add the bread crumbs and toss again. Use a meat grinder (or the grinder attachment of a stand mixer) to grind the mixture through a medium die into a bowl. Put the mixture through the medium die once more.",
      "Take a bit of the mixture in your hand, give it a few firm but still rather gentle squeezes, and roll it into a ball (you're shooting for each one to be a little bigger than a golf ball). Overworking the mixture is bad and leads to tough meatballs, but this warning often makes cooks too timid when they form the balls: the outside of each ball should be smooth, with no big cracks or crags. Gently pinch any cracks closed so the ball doesn't fall apart in the pan. Repeat with the remaining mixture.",
      "Add the oil to a 8- to 9-quart Dutch oven with a lid, set the pan over high heat, and swirl the oil in the pan. When it just begins to smoke, cook the meatballs in batches to avoid crowding, turning them occasionally with tongs, so they develop a beautiful, shiny, deep-brown crust on all sides. You don't want to cook them too fast. If you see any black spots, turn your heat down a little. Keep at it until you're happy with the color of each one, transferring them to a plate when they finish browning. It'll take 12 to 15 minutes per batch. Drain half the fat remaining in the pot.",
      "To make the sauce, lower the heat to medium-high, add the onion, garlic, and salt, and cook, stirring often, until the onion is soft and lightly browned and the garlic smells toasty and is a deep golden brown, about 5 minutes. Add the coriander, cumin, and chilies and cook for a minute, stirring constantly.",
      "Turn the heat to low, add the tomatoes, and simmer gently until the tomatoes begin to stick to the bottom of the pot, about 10 minutes.",
      "Add 4 cups water and raise the heat to bring the sauce to a boil, then turn it down to maintain a gentle simmer and cook for 5 minutes more. Transfer 2 cups of the sauce to a blender, give it a whiz until it's smooth and airy, and stir it back into the sauce in the pot. (I always freak out at this point, because the sauce seems so bland, but don't worry -- it'll taste amazing after you're done.)",
      "Return the meatballs and their juices to the pot and stir gently to coat them in the sauce. Cover the pot, tweak the heat if need be to maintain a gentle simmer, and cook for about 30 minutes to let the flavors come together.",
      "To finish, turn the heat to low, add blobs of the yogurt, and crack the eggs here and there into the sauce. Tear and sprinkle in the mint leaves and cilantro, and add a good drizzle of olive oil. Cover the pot and turn the heat to medium. Cook until the egg whites have just set (I like my yolks a little runny), 10 to 15 minutes. Eat it right away, from the pot or divided among shallow bowls, making sure everyone gets an egg and some yogurt."

      "Working in batches, take your pickle slices and dredge them in the flour. Next, dip the pickles in the egg wash, so that the outside of each pickle is completely covered in egg. Next, coat the pickles in the panko mixture. When the pickles are fully coated in panko, lay them out on a rimmed baking sheet.",
      "Set a large pot over high heat, and add enough oil to fill the pot approximately 1 inch full. You want to heat the oil to between 350\u00b0 and 375\u00b0 F. When the oil approaches 350\u00b0 F, turn the heat down to medium. Fry the pickles in batches. When they are golden brown on the outside, remove them to a rimmed baking sheet lined with paper towels, and season them lightly with salt. Serve with lemon and/or your favorite dipping sauce and enjoy."

Vigorously stir with a balloon whisk until the ingredients are well distributed. In a separate bowl, combine the butter, oil, milk, orange zest, juice, vanilla, and the 8 egg yolks. Using a whisk, vigorously stir the wet ingredients together until they are uniform in colo",
      "Place the 4 egg whites and the cream of tartar in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. Beat on high speed until soft peaks start to form and the egg whites are opaque. With the mixer still on, sprinkle the remaining 1/3 cup (67 g) sugar into the egg whites, continuing to beat until the sugar is incorporated and the egg whites are glossy white. Scoop the egg whites out into a separate bowl.",

Drizzle the wet ingredients into the bowl, increasing the speed slightly to medium-low as more liquid is poured in.

If butter begins to smoke excessively or steak begins to burn, reduce heat to medium. To baste, tilt pan slightly so that butter collects by handle. Use a spoon to pick up butter and pour it over steak, aiming at light spots. Continue flipping and basting until an instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part of tenderloin side registers 120 to 125\u00b0 F (49 to 52\u00b0 C) for medium-rare or 130\u00b0 F (54\u00b0 C) for medium, 8 to 10 minutes total.

Porterhouse, T-bone, ribeye, or New York strips will all work. Avoid using tenderloin steaks, as they are likely to overcook.

      "Using a Japanese grater or a microplane zester, grate the ginger nub into a small bowl. Then cover it with about 2 tablespoons of hot water, set aside to steep.",
      "For the dashi stock, rinse the kombu pieces under cold water to get rid of any extraneous salt. In a medium sized pot, rehydrate the kombu in 5 cups of cold water. Allow to sit for about 30 minutes.",
      "While the kombu is rehydrating, preheat your oven to 400\u00b0F. Using a sharp knife, cut the skin off your squash and divide into 1 1/2 inch chunks. Do not cut too small or else they will not hold together well. Lay the squash on a large sheet pan, making sure not to overcrowd. Sprinkle with a few pinches of salt, freshly ground black pepper and grapeseed oil. Roast in the oven for 15 minutes, flipping halfway into the cooking time.",
      "After 30 minutes, set the pot with your kombu and water over high heat. Right before it reaches a boil, remove the kombu pieces. Add the katsuobushi and dried sardines. Bring to a boil, and turn off the heat immediately. Allow to steep for 15 minutes. With a fine mesh strainer, strain the liquid. Use a spoon to press out as much of the liquid as possible. Don't let any go to waste! Reserve the stock",
      "For the meatballs, combine the pork, salt, white pepper, egg, and scallions into a medium sized mixing bowl. Put the tofu into a separate bowl and use a fork to gently mash the tofu so that only a few small chunky pieces are left over. Add the tofu and the ginger along with its water into your meat mixture. Mix using a large spoon until thoroughly mixed. Your mixture should be mixed to the point where the meat fibers are no longer separated and pronounced.",
      "Since we are making four poached eggs, we are going to make them ahead of time. Set a medium sized pot filled 3/4 of the way with water to boil. Now gently crack an egg into a small bowl. Using a large metal spoon, stir in one direction until you make a rapid whirlpool. Quickly but carefully slide the raw egg into the water. As the water continues to turn, most of the egg whites should stay together. Cook for 2-3 minutes for a runny yoke. Remove the egg using a slotted spoon and place in an ice water bath to stop the cooking. Do this for the other 3 eggs. Reheat the eggs in warm water before serving.",
      "Using a medium pot, bring your dashi stock back up to a boil. Add the shiitakes and potatoes, cook for 5-8 minutes over medium-high heat. Then, add your roasted squash. To form the meatballs, take a large metal spoon and scoop up about a tablespoon worth of meat. Wet your left hand so that the meat doesn't stick. Using the metal spoon and a scooping motion, roll the meat into a ball. The meat should stick together easily. Don't overwork. Gently place into the soup. Once all the meatballs are in the pot, bring to a boil and then turn down the heat to medium high. Cook for about 8-10 minutes, until the meatballs are cooked through.",
      "While the meatballs are cooking, combine the two types of miso in a small bowl. Ladle some of the hot soup in. Use a spoon to work the miso into the liquid, making sure no clumps are left. Turn your stove off. At this point, I like to add about half of the miso liquid initially. Give it a taste. Add more of the miso little by little, until the flavor is perfect.",
      "Serve immediately topped with a poached egg and scallions."

Pour the mixture onto a lightly floured work surface and knead a few times until the dough completely comes together. Flour your work surface again and flour the top of your dough. Roll out the dough to a 16 by 10 rectangle. If you are having trouble with the dough being sticky, sprinkle a little more flour on top and bottom.",
      "In a small bowl mix the melted butter, cane sugar, spices and espresso. It will be a little bit chunky. Spread this mixture evenly over the dough, leaving a 1-inch border at the far end of your dough. You are going to be rolling the larger side of the dough. Tightly roll your dough towards the border and press firmly down on the border to seal the edges. Cut into two inch pieces, which should give you 8 pieces.",
      "Place the scone pieces on the baking sheet, flatten out a bit with a gentle push from your fingers and sprinkle the top with a little cane sugar. Bake for 12-15 minutes until the tops are lightly golden brown. Let cool on a wire wrack on the baking sheet. Enjoy warm. Scones keep refrigerated for a few days in the fridge and are good if they are reheated in the microwave for 30-45 seconds."

      "\"Or Burgers\" Step: If grain salads don't do it for you, or you'd like a closer approximation to \"meat\" on Meatless Monday, these can quickly become terrific patties. Cook the chickpeas down a few more minutes until they form a paste, then stir in the paprika, cumin and a little of the reserved chickpea liquid to make it a good binding paste, then combine with the egg yolk. Stir that into the couscous, oil your hands and form small patties. Fry these in olive oil or butter until just crisp. Serve on their own, on a slice of hearty bread or -- my favorite -- broil a pita to just charred and smear on a tablespoon of garlicky hummus."

If using cod, wait to add it with the shrimp. Let the stock come to a boil again and cook but do not stir for 10 minutes. Adjust the taste for salt, add the shrimp (and cod, if using), placing evenly over the pan and pushing them down into the rice. Let cook, still not stirring, until most of the stock has been absorbed, clams have opened, and fish is cooked. Adjust heat if needed; when done cooking there should be a nicely browned, caramelized crust on the bottom of the paella pan, but it should not be heavily charred or blackened.

Use the pastry tip to cut out one or more windows in each cookie. Fill the cutouts with crushed candy, keeping the candy level with the cookie. (After I cut out the windows with the small end of the pastry tip and clean away the little plugs of dough, I insert the tip in each hole and use it as a funnel to fill the cutouts with the candy-it's a neat trick.) Sprinkle 2 or 3 seeds onto the candy in each window, if you're using them. Using a pastry brush, brush the dough very lightly with the egg wash, avoiding the candy. If you're using herbs, \"paste\" them onto the dough. Finally, lightly sprinkle the cookies with sugar. (Save the dough scraps to combine with the scraps from the other piece of dough.)",
      "Bake for 8 to 9 minutes, or until the cookies are almost firm and the candy has melted but not turned brown. You'll want to bake these longer because the cookie part will be pale, but resist. (I've over-baked them so that every candy color went to brown. They weren't as attractive as they might have been, though the golden cookies were still good.) Transfer the baking sheet to a cooling rack and allow the cookies to cool until the candy hardens, then lift them off the sheet with an offset spatula and put on a rack. Repeat with the remaining dough: Gather the scraps together, re-roll them, chill, and make more cookies, cooling the baking sheet before using it.",
      "To serve, put these on a white or clear glass plate so that their colors sparkle. These will keep for 1 day in a cool, dry place. Bonne Idee: Stained Glass Cookie Decorations: If you'd like to use these cookies as ornaments for a Christmas tree, cut the cutouts larger and, right before you slide them into the oven, poke a small hole in the top of each cookie-I use a drinking straw to do this-so that you'll be able to run ribbons through the baked cookies.\r\n\r\nIf you make plain cookies, they will keep for about 4 days-it's the candy that has a tendency to turn soft and sticky."

      "Notes: Green Tea powder can vary in quality,strength and texture. To develop this recipe, I used green tea powder purchased through Amazon in 8.8 ou. foil packs. Whatever matcha you use, make sure it is in a powder form. If granular, grind to a powder. Depending upon the brand, you may want to increase or lessen the amount of sugar.\r\n* This dough can sometimes be a bit finicky. You may want to first roll and bake (unfilled) just a few cookies as a test batch. If, after cooling 1/2 hour, they fall apart when you try to eat them, sprinkle1-2 T more brandy over all the dough and work it in as you roll or re-roll each ball.I have worked hard to assure that this recipe does not require fixing, but one never knows the variables in another kitchen!\r\n\r\n**Comments: The truffle filling is optional but I prefer that version because of the added sweetness and the surprise of a creamy chewy center in a melty sandy cookie. If you choose to make unfilled cookies, add 1/8 cup more sugar and 1 T. more brandy when you make the dough.",

The hotter the cookies, the more fragile they will be, so you don't want them to fall apart as you remove them from the pan. This recipes makes about 18-20 yummy cookies."

      "Preheat the oven to 450 degrees. Using a chef knife, remove and discard the top of each carrot. Wash the carrots in cold water, but do not peel them (they look beautiful when roasted with the skin on). Cut the carrots into bite size pieces. Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Place the carrots on the rimmed baking sheet in a single even layer. Toss the carrots with olive oil to coat, and season them with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Cook for 10-12 minutes, until the edges begin to caramelize. When the carrots are just cooked through and beginning to brown, remove them from the oven and set them aside to cool.",
      "While the carrots are cooking, set a large skillet over medium heat, and add enough olive oil to barely cover the bottom of the skillet. Add the shallots, and season lightly with salt. Cook the shallots until they become soft and start to turn translucent, stirring occasionally.",
      "While the shallots are cooking, separate the cilantro leaves from the stems. Save the leaves in the refrigerator for later. Organize the stems into a single even pile (like a bunch of chives) and slice the cilantro stems into very thin slivers. By the time you finish dicing the cilantro stems, the shallots should be soft and translucent. Add the diced stems to the skillet, along with the sumac, coriander, cumin, ginger, and aleppo chile. Stir, cooking for 1-2 minutes, until the oil smells fragrant.",
      "Add the chickpeas, and stir to coat them in the flavorful oil. Cook for 2 minutes, to allow the chickpeas to take on some of the flavor of the skillet. Add the kale, and stir to help the kale begin to wilt. Season lightly with salt. When the kale has begun to wilt, remove the skillet from the heat. You do not want to overcook the kale (it will shrink too much). The moment when the kale leaves are no longer raw is the time to remove the skillet from the heat (the kale leaves will soften and darken slightly in color).",
      "Add the lime juice and stir. Add the creme fraiche and stir. The residual heat from the skillet should melt the creme fraiche and create a delicate sauce. Taste a few chickpeas and a small piece of kale. Adjust with more salt and/or lime juice as necessary. Add the roasted carrots, and gently stir to incorporate. Serve immediately, or serve at room temperature. Garnish with a handful of chopped cilantro leaves. Enjoy.",

Keep the cream in the fridge until it's time to whip it up. If you'd like even more of a citrus kick, add the zest of another orange to the cream before mixing.\r\n\r\nThe cake can also be baked in a 9x9 square pan. This is great if you need to portion it into smaller pieces to serve a bigger crowd. But baking time may decrease by a few minutes or so and you'll need to add 1/4 cup more cranberries."

Either way, choose something with a good crust.",

If they are just right or under ripe, add about a tsp of honey. Gently stir the mixture together. Cover with plastic and let it sit at room temperature for at least 30 mins. Two notes here. First, I suggest honey because it's natural and I don't really enjoy the thought of adding sugar to fruit. However, because it's necessary for this recipe, I think it's better to at least use a natural sweetener. Second, the longer you let the cherries sit, the more tender they will become. If you have more time, feel free to let them sit for an hour or two but it is in now way obligatory.",
      "7. Once the toasts are cool, the cherries have macerated, and you're ready to serve, take the block of goat cheese and spread a healthy amount on the toasts. If you want an extra kick, add a few granules of sea salt on to the goat cheese (not too much though!).",
      "8. Top the goat cheese with a spoonful of the cherries. For something extra and for some color, chop your favorite fresh herb and sprinkle a few pieces on top. Mint for coolness, parsley for bite, basil for earthy...etc. Just make sure that you use the herbs sparingly so as not to over power the cherries.",

Make pancake batter (or if you have leftover batter from breakfast use that) according to recipe be it store bought or my personal favorite 'The Kitchen Lofty's Buttermilk Pancakes'. Instead of frying said batter on a buttery sizzling hot griddle start by heating oven to 350 degrees. While oven is warming, scoop pancake batter into pre-lined and greased muffin tin using a scoop of choice (regular ol' ice cream scoop is what I use) to ensure equal amounts for even cooking time. Place muffins in oven for 8minutes to begin,checking for a nice golden brown color, cooking longer as needed until center of muffin is set. Cool slightly if you can wait that long and enjoy with a variety of fruit and nut toppings or a drizzle of pure maple syrup or dollop of sweetened whipped cream. The additions are only limited by your imagination. Or be like my 8 year old son and grab two just as they are while the school bus roars to a stop on the dusty gravel road right outside our home.

      "NOTE: The stock I used is homemade and unsalted. If you are using store-bought, you may need to reduce the salt accordingly. A fast and easy way to get enriched stocks, plus making the boiled chicken needed for this recipe, you can do this:",
      "Bring a large pot of water, with a few slices of ginger and scallion, to boil. Submerge the chicken in the boiling water and cook for 5 min, until there's no more scums/blood coming out of it. Rinse and clean the chicken thoroughly, and place in a stock pot (this will give the stock a \"cleaner\" taste). Peel the onion and scorch the surface over direct flames (on stove-stop) until roughly charred. Add the charred onion and sliced ginger into the stock pot with the chicken, and add 6 cups of chicken stock. Keep the soup on simmer until the chicken is cooked through. Remove the chicken and strain the stock (do not skim off the fat as you'll need it later). Keep the chicken submerged in the strained stock until needed.",
      "TO MAKE THE RICE-THICKENED CHICKEN SOUP: Sweat the onion with 1 tbsp of olive oil, salt and ground black pepper in a stock pot over medium heat, until translucent and soft, but not browned. Add the chicken stock and rice, and simmer for 10 ~ 15 min until the rice is very soft. Transfer to a blender and blend until completely smooth. Return the soup back to the pot and keep warm with the lid on.",
      "TO MAKE THE BROWNED AND CRISPY CHICKEN BITS: Add the finely shredded chicken, chicken fat, olive oil, salt and ground white pepper in a skillet and cook over medium-high heat. Some moisture mixed inside the chicken fat will be cooked off, and keep stirring occasionally until the chickens are crispy and browned on all edges. Add the grated ginger and cook for a few seconds only, then turn off the heat completely. Set aside until needed.",
      "TO SERVE: If the soup appears to be too thick to your liking (it may thicken slightly over time), add a little bit more stock to thin it out slightly. Serve the soup with a soft-poached egg, a good dose of browned and crispy chicken bits, plus a drizzle of chicken fat and a dab of ground white pepper."

Create a hill with the crumble and with 1 finger make a hole on top of it, add the salt and pour the water. Mould first with a single finger and then with the whole hand to create a ball being careful not to over mix. Wrap the dough in a plastic foil and refrigerate for at least 30 min (you can also keep the dough for 1 day and make the tart the next day).",
      "In the meanwhile make the filling: Slice the leeks very thinly. Overcook them in a covered pan with the water and the salt for 30 minutes over medium-low heat. Sprinkle with the flour and keep stirring over medium-low heat to create a mixture similar to besciamelle, if it is necessary add a little milk to adjust the thickness. When the mixture is dense (about 10 min) adjust salt and add the diced bacon and optional grated parmigiano cheese. Set it aside.",
      "Preheat the oven at 375-400 F.\r\nDust a wooden surface with flour and roll the dough into an about 1/8\" thick round. Grease a 9-10\" round baking tin using oil or butter, dust it with a little flour and put the dough in. With the tines of a fork pierce several times the dough for it not to bubble while baking. Pour the leeks mixture over the crust. Fold the borders of the crust over the mixture making pleats as you fold it, if needed. Bake the tart at 375-400 F for about 30 minutes or until the crust is golden brown.",
      "Serve warm with a mixed greens or fennel salad seasoned with extra virgin olive oil, fresh erbs, and a little salt or let the tart cool and serve the next day."

Next morning take it out, let it warm up (about 30-45 minutes), and roll it about 0.4cm thick, cut and roll to croissants.\r\nBrush with a mixture of 1 egg, half tea spoon of cream and a pinch of salt. Cover the pan with cling foil; it shouldn't stick to the croissants. Proof till puffy and about 2 times (2.5x) their original size. At 21 degrees Celsius it took about 8-9 hours.",

      "IMPORTANT: Italian rolled Pancetta is usually spiced with cloves, nutmeg, pepper and other spices. If you cannot find this kind of flavored pancetta, use any kind of bacon you like - or skip it altogether, and consider adding the extra spices. See part 2 of the recipe.",
      "Slice all the ingredients: Slice the pancetta into small cubes and the onion into half moons. Wash and thinly shred the cabbage. Cut it in 4 wedges to make slicing easier.",
      "Heat the oil in a large pan and add the Pancetta. If you're using sweet bacon or unflavored pancetta, see the second part of the recipe (but don't add the spices yet). \r\nFry the pancetta in the oil until it starts to get crispy, about 5 minutes.",
      "Add the onion and let it sweat until traslucent, about 10 minutes. Add the sugar, half the salt, and vinegar. Let the sugar melt, then let them cook, half covered, for 15 more minutes, until they start to brown. Give them a stir every now and then.",
      "Add the cabbage, a splash of water (about 1/3 cup) and put the lid on the pan. It will look like a lot of cabbage, but it will wilt like crazy. Leave it to cook undisturbed for 10 minutes. Just make sure there is enough liquid so that it doesn't stick to the bottom.",
      "Add the pepper (and spices, if using - see the second part of the recipe) and the rest of the salt. Give the cabbage a good stir. Put the lid back on and leave them be for another 10 minutes - 5 if you like them crunchier.",
      "Finally, take the lid off and let them finish cooking for 5 more minutes, stirring every now and then. At this point, everything should be nicely flavored. Check for seasoning, and adjust to taste if necessary.",
      "If you are not using the kind of Pancetta flavored with all the spices, or want to stick to a vegetarian version, add the spices above. Start with a little, and add more to taste if you like spices. It should be a very subtle flavor."

The water should be boiling away, so chuck your noodles in and keep a close eye on them -- ramen can take as little as 4 minutes to cook.",
      "Drain the noodles, then toss them in with the garlic and chile, and add the diced ginger. Mix so that the sesame-garlic oil is evenly spread throughout the noodles, and add a bit more sesame oil if necessary (I found that it was necessary at this point). Season generously with salt and pepper. Remove from heat, and hit the noodles with a squeeze of lime. I like serving these noodles slightly chilled/below room temperature, so I put them in the fridge to cool for about 20 minutes before serving.",
      "Just before serving, remove the noodles from the fridge, and top with the cucumber slices as well as the toasted sesame seeds. Done! Super simple, and a really nice addition to any asian-inspired meal."

I have another trick though - I prefer to dip the top of the cookies in the glaze, swirl them around a bit, very gently, lift them out and let the excess drip off, then return to the cooling rack. I find this gives you a nice even coat of glaze. Leave the cookies until the glaze sets. The cookies can be kept in an airtight container for one day."

      "Set aside the thick, outer leave of the cabbage. Prepare the vegetables as directed above and add them all to the 2 gallon jar or crock (or two 1 gallon jars). Just do this as you go along to make sure have the right amount of vegetables. You want enough to fill a two gallon jar about 2 inches from the top. This will eventually shrink down as the vegetables wilt and release their juices. Since vegetable sizes vary, if you need more simply add more until you have enough! The ratio when all is said and done is equal amounts of carrot, radish and onion comprising 1/4 of the entire mix of veg. The rest was cabbage. The nice thing about this kraut though, is you can add whatever you like as long as the consistency is about the same. Things like Kohlrabi, brussels sprouts, parsnips, red radishes would all do very well. \r\n\r\nYou also want some consistency in the shredding and slicing. I use a mandolin to get my root vegetables all julienned evenly; and to slice my cabbage and onions evenly as well as the lemons to the right thickness. That way they all ferment consistently.",
      "Once you have all your vegetables prepared, dump them all in a big bowl and toss them to distribute everything evenly. You can hold out the lemons to layer in but I like it all mixed up.",
      "Mix the spices together and toss with the vegetables.",
      "Mix warm water and salt; stir until dissolved. If you like your kraut a little less sour, you can add 2 Tbs of sugar at this point. Add Kombucha. \r\nNote: I use my homemade kombucha brew that's fermented to the vinegar stage. You can use bottled kombucha or you can substitute 1 cup of cider vinegar mixed with 1 cup of water.",
      "Add vegetable mixture back into the crock. Pour the brine over the mixture. Really push the vegetables down with clean hands to get them as submerged as possible. If you find you don't have enough to cover, you can add more water and salt (1 1/2 teaspoons per quart of water).",
      "Add the tea bag. The tannin from the tea will keep the vegetables crunchy while they ferment. You can also use grape, oak or horseradish leaves. Just be sure they haven't been sprayed with anything.\r\n\r\nNow cover the entire thing with the clean, outer leaves of the cabbage and again, push down to make sure it's all covered with brine. This is the thing that will keep mold out. Now weight it all down. I used a smaller jar filled with water on top of the cabbage leaves.",
      "Cover the entire thing with a thin dishcloth; one that will allow air in like a tea towel. I'm a rubber band hoarder so I always have those big thick ones to use to keep the towel on; but you can tie it down with twine or ribbon. Whatever works for you.",
      "Here's the hard part. Let it sit in a quiet, dark corner of you kitchen or pantry until the magic happens. Start tasting it after two weeks. I tend to check mine daily for signs of mold. If that happens then just remove the mold and stir everything back in. I know it sounds gross, but the fermentation process will kill the mold as long as there's plenty of brine. And that's why 1) you want to keep it weighted down; and 2) you want to be sure you touch it with clean hands and implements; and 3) keep it covered with something breathable. The cloth will keep out mold spores, but allow enough oxygen for fermentation to occur. If the brine starts to evaporate, you can add more water at the same ratio of 1 1/2 teaspoons of salt per quart of water.",
      "When it gets to the stage you want, move it to the refrigerator. I usually take out part after 2 or three weeks to start eating while it's tangy but still firm (in the picture); and leave the rest another several weeks until it gets softer. I put it in smaller fido jars in the fridge. If you keep it outside the fridge, with plenty of brine, there's no need to process it and it will continue to ripen and get soft and krauty like the stuff you buy but better. Refrigeration slows down the fermentation process and I've kept batches happily for months until sadly it's all gone.",
      "About the lemons and bigger cabbage leaves -- waste not want not! Pick them out and use them. I store the lemons with brine in the fridge. You can chop them up and throw them in anything you want to add a citrusy kick to. I've put them in potato salad; greens; lima beans; roasted brussel sprouts and escargot. \r\n\r\nYou can use those big, pickled cabbage leaves for making cabbage rolls with your stuffing of choice. In fact if you know you're going to do that, just throw in a few extra whole leaves at the beginning of the process. The extra flavor from the pickling is amazing and keeps the stuffing nice and moist! By the way, I have been known to pick up stray cabbage leaves in the produce department left behind by uneducated shoppers who want only the bright green heads. No one minds and I never get charged for them.",
      "Note on Photos: Photo 2 shows the pressed kraut after two weeks of fermentation. Photo 3 is how it looked after it was pressed down into the brine on day 1. I'll post additional pictures as the ferment continues."

      "Measure the flour and seeds into a mixing bowl. Add the boiling mushroom water and the sesame oil. Stir quickly to blend. When stirring no longer is effective, turn dough out onto a work surface. Press it together with your hands, then begin kneading it. Kneading this warm, soft dough is pure pleasure. When dough begins to stick to your hands, add a tablespoon or so of flour. Continue kneading and adding bits of flour until dough is no longer sticky. You probably won't need the entire 1/4 cup of additional flour, but keep it handy because you'll use some for rolling the pancakes. The whole process of mixing, kneading, and shaping only takes about 5 minutes.",
      "To shape into a cylinder, roll dough into a general log shape. Stand it up on each end and press gently against the work surface to square off the ends, creating a uniformly shaped cylinder about 2\" in diameter and about 6 inches long. Wrap with plastic and allow to rest for 15 minutes.",

Press it flat and thin with the palm of your hand. With a rolling pin, roll each out to about 7 inches in diameter. Set each aside with a piece of parchment between them. This will also take about 5 minutes.",

Use tongs to turn them over and remove from the skillet. Stack them on a plate with the pieces of parchment between them. Once all have been cooked, wrap a kitchen towel around them to keep them warm while you cook the eggs.",
      "Use the same skillet to cook the eggs that you used to cook the pancakes. Warm it, with some olive oil to film the bottom, over medium heat. Add the eggs, salt and pepper, and a pinch of red pepper flakes. Move them around very gently. When they are half done, add the mushrooms and scallions. Continue moving everything around gently. Remove the skillet from the heat before the eggs are completely dry. They want to be very tender, and will finish cooking on their way to being wrapped up.",
      "Lay out 4 pancakes. Arrange 2 whole sprigs of cilantro along the center of each one. Divide the eggs between them, and place a spring of cilantro on top. Roll the pancakes up into cylinders. Tie closed with the whole pieces of scallion green. Garnish plates with some drops of Sriracha. Consume immediately. The pancakes should be chewy, but tenderly so, and with a subtle crunch from the seeds. And the eggs should be as gently soft as can be.",
      "Wrap the remaining pancakes in plastic and store in refrigerator, or freezer. To reheat, lay between 2 damp (not wet!) paper towels, and warm in a microwave on medium setting."

Add the black pepper and sugar. Whisk mayonnaise into the mixture until smooth. Slowly whisk in the olive oil. Taste and adjust with salt, sugar, pepper, or lemon juice as desired.",

One short cut is to buy ready-made crispy onions at an Indian or Arabic shop. Its a garnish, so what the heck, but you're being cheap, right?\r\n\r\nSalt your onions and leave them out in a colander or on paper towels to shed some of their water. Give them a good squeeze after 20 minutes or so and roll them around in a towel to get as much water out as you can. \r\n\r\nHeat a good half-cup of ghee (or oil) over a medium-hot flame. Once it's hot, add the onions, stirring regularly until they go brown. Then keep cooking them a bit, really just before you're going to burn them. Remove with a slotted spoon and spread out on paper towels. They should crisp as they cool. If not, they'll still taste good, just pretend you meant for them to be like that. I mean, how many of your guests will have eaten koshary in Egypt anyway?",

Bring to a boil, cover and reduce the heat to low and cook until done, about 20-30 minutes, depending on your rice.",

Stir for a few minutes more and once the garlic has released it's flavour, but not browned, add the tomato paste and water. Simmer for 15-20 minutes, until the sauce has darkened and cooked. Add the 1/4 cup vinegar and season with salt and pepper. Cook for a few minutes longer. The sauce can be made a day in advance, but should be hot when you dish out.",
      "To make the garlic vinegar, simply add the 8-10 chopped cloves to the remaining vinegar and let steep for a day or so. The vinegar should be on the table for guests to help themselves, so if you have a pretty bottle, feel free to use it.",
      "You should also have a bottle of hot sauce on the table. I use a store bought, but don't know what brands you have access to, so can't make a specific recommendation. I would stay away from sauces with very distinctive flavours, such as Tabasco or anything with chipotle peppers. You want guests to be able to add a bit of heat, that's all."

They have a great variety of gourmet products, specializing in cheeses and pastas, and lots of stuff they make from scratch. Definitely a great place to get relatively inexpensive spices also! Cook noodles according to package directions for al dente, mine were in there for about 5-6 minutes.",

Then add in cream, nutmeg, salt, pepper, and 1 cup of cheese. Make sure your heat is low enough that the cream does not bubble or boil. If it does this, your sauce is \"breaking\"... and you don't want that. It's a slow and nurturing process, but just keep constantly stirring until sauce thickens a bit and cheese is melted throughout.",

Just slice a fresh italian loaf in half (I used a pretty small one since there's only the two of us) and top the slices with the remaining minced garlic. Coat each half with a light layer of butter/margarine and top with remaining 1/2 cup cheese. Can also opt to add some oregano for a finishing touch. Bake in oven at 400 F for about 5-10 minutes, depending on how crunchy you want your bread. I found that 5-6 minutes gave it a nice crusty exterior and still a soft interior.",

Place a steamer basket in the bottom on the pan and steam the cauliflower florets until just barely tender, about 3-4 minutes. Spread the steamed cauliflower on a sheet pan and let cool to room temperature.",

Transfer the chopped cauliflower to a large bowl. Add the remaining quarter of the cauliflower to to the food processor and pulse 15 to 20 times until finely ground, almost bordering on being a paste, and add to the rest of the coarsely chopped cauliflower.",
      "Add the grated cheese, eggs, chopped green onion, garlic, hot sauce, smoked paprika, breadcrumbs, salt and pepper to the cauliflower and stir to combine. Let the mixture sit for 10-15 minutes (this will allow the breadcrumbs to soak up some of the moisture of the rest of the ingredients making it easier to mold into tots).",

      "While the buffalo cauliflower tots are baking, make the blue cheese dipping sauce. Combine all the dipping sauce ingredients in a medium bowl and whisk to combine. Set aside.",
      "Remove the buffalo cauliflower tots from the oven and let them sit to cool slightly, about 5 minutes. Pile on a platter and serve alongside the blue cheese dipping sauce."

If you are more of a Sichuan peppercorn-beginner, you can start with 1 teaspoon first and see how that suits you. Moreover, the recipe is based on the assumption that store-bought salted peanuts are usually lightly salted. If for some reason your roasted salted peanuts are potato chips salty, you might have to reduce the 1/2 teaspoon of salt to 1/4 teaspoon.",
      "Preheat the oven on 350\u00b0 F (175\u00b0 C).",
      "Finely crush the sichuan peppercorn in a stone mortar or spice-grinder. In a large bowl, first fold 2 tbsp of beaten egg white and salted peanuts together until evenly coated, then add the crushed peppercorn, chili flakes and salt, and fold again until evenly mixed. Spread over a parchment paper-lined baking sheet and bake in the oven for 6 ~ 7 minutes, scrambling them with a fork once in between, until the surface of the peanuts are dry (remember, the peanuts were already roasted. we are just applying more flavours). Let the peanuts cool COMPLETELY inside the baking sheet.",
      "Cover the peanuts with 2 layers of plastic wrap, then smash them with a hammer to crush about 1/3 of them into small pieces, leaving the rest of the peanuts whole or in large pieces. Transfer the peanuts to a bowl and mix with the baking soda. Put the unsalted butter on top (this will make it easier to add the peanuts to the caramel). Set aside. Apply a little bit of cooking-spray over a sheet of parchment paper and a spatula, or rub both with a bit of oil. Set aside.",
      "In a large pot (the caramel will bubble and foam later so you'll want enough room for this to happen), add granulated sugar, water, corn syrup and salt, and cook over medium-high heat. Stir gently with a wooden spoon only occasionally, and cook until the mixture turns from completely clear to a light amber color. This will take very roughly 15 to 20 minutes, but watch carefully. Once the sugar turns light amber, turn off the heat immediately. Give it a couple more seconds (the color will continue to darken very fast), then add the peanuts with the baking soda and unsalted butter. Quickly stir the mixture with a wooden spoon until it's evenly mixed, and that the foaming has subsided.",
      "Pour the mixture onto the oiled parchment paper and spread it with the oiled spatula. If it's cooling too quickly and becomes unspreadable, cover it with another piece of parchment paper and a kitchen towel on top (so that you do not burn your hands), and press it down with your hands. Once flattened, chill in the fridge for 15 minutes to cool down.",

I washed the chicken inside and out and pat it dry. I covered it's legs with kitchen towel and placed it in a plastic back. Here comes the hard part, I had to secure the hen with it breast to the back of the fridge without pressing the legs against it as well.

Fry about a cup or so of the chicken at a time (I like to fry it in a large metal strainer so that I can lift all the chicken out at once and don't have to worry about burning.)

Take the dough out of the fridge and roll it with a rolling pin over a surface sprinkled with flour to form a circle a little wider than the baking dish.

Fill with the apples (with a little cooking liquid), then with the chestnuts (pellicule removed and coarsly crumbled) and finally pinenuts.",

Place the aubergine (one at a time) over the moderate flames of your hob head. Use metal kitchen tongs to turn it over quite frequently for even smoking. The skin will start burning and the flesh will become piping hot and soft. It takes roughly 10-15 min to smoke one aubergine. Make sure the aubergine doesn't catch fire. It will get a little messy so I recommend to line the space around the hob head with foil. Set the aubergines aside to cool down.",

      "Add a layer of white asparagus spears, and then green asparagus spears, alternating the stems and tips. If you have enough chive stems for another layer of chives - add them in about halfway up the pan.

After 20 minutes, uncover the container and lift the edges of the dough mixture with wet fingers, stretching upwards and folding into the center, going around the entire mixture until all the edges are folded over towards the center. Turn the dough over so the folded edges are now on the bottom. This is a basic stretch and fold technique you will repeat two more times, every 20 minutes, for a total of three times. You don't need to remove the dough from the container for the stretch and fold-just do it right in the container. As you do this, you will notice the gluten beginning to develop and the dough developing more structure and elasticity. Be sure to keep the container covered in between each stretch and fold.",
      "During the time you are doing the stretch and fold with the dough, place the pizza stone in on the middle rack in the oven. Preheat the oven to 500\u00b0F. Be sure to preheat the oven about an hour before the dough is ready to bake.",

Sprinkle a little flour on top of the dough and roll into a loose ball in between your hands. Place a little extra flour underneath the ball of dough, and cover with the container placed upside down over the dough. Let rest for at least 15 minutes and up to 30 minutes.",
      "After the dough has rested, remove the container. Sprinkle flour over the dough and lift from underneath, gently flipping the dough so the top is resting on the palm of your hand. With your free hand sprinkle a generous amount of flour on your work surface. Place the dough on the floured surface, and gently turn and stretch evenly from the center until it's about a ten-inch round. Transfer dough to a lightly floured 15 X 15-inch piece of parchment paper. Continue to stretch the dough by pushing and pulling the edges until it is 13 to 14 inches in diameter. Slide a pizza peel underneath the parchment paper and dough, and slide both onto the pizza stone in the oven. Bake for 3 minutes. Slide pizza peel underneath the parchment paper to remove and place on a large cooling rack. Slide parchment paper from underneath the crust. Let cool and store well-wrapped in refrigerator or freezer for future use, or use immediately for pizza."

Insert a meat thermometer into the thickest part of the roast. When the oven is ready, place the roast, uncovered, into the oven. Immediately reduce the oven temperature to 350. Cook until the thermometer registers 125 degrees, about 15-20 minutes per pound, or 2 1/2 hours for an 8 lb roast. Check the temperature of the meat in several other places.
