I've had great success with small madarin orange slices or cut up strawberries! Perhaps try switching lettuce for spinach, or another green.

      "once it's risen punch down the dough and kneed a little more, you might need to add a bit more flour to keep it workable and not too sticky but don't add so much that it becomes hard to knead. it takes some practice to get the feel for the texture thing but this is a fairly forgiving recipe so don't worry about it too much.",
      "divide in two and form into two smooth, round loaves about 1 inch thick, coat in a bit more olive oil and place on a greased cookie sheet, remember that they'll double in size again so give them room to expand. if you want you can freeze the dough at this point and when you thaw in the fridge it will do it's second rise at the same time.",

One of the best ways to cook asparagus is to steam it upright in a small amount of water; this way, the delicate tips of the stalks will cook at the same rate as the thick bottoms. Use a tall, lidded pot, or a double boiler (invert the upper portion over the lower). There are also special asparagus cookers designed for this purpose. Or, you can lay the stalks flat in a collapsible vegetable steamer placed in a large skillet.",

(You can add a clove of garlic, a slice of onion, or a lemon wedge to the water.) Cooking time: five to eight minutes, depending on the thickness of the spears.",

      "Cook tortilla's one at a time on a medium hot cast iron skillet or griddle for about 1 to 2 minutes on each side, or until the tortilla gets brown specks. Black specks mean your pan is too hot. Reduce heat so the tortilla puffs and browns. It should puff up underneath if done right. Do not worry if it does not though. Practice will get you to that stage.",
      "NOTE: Here are some tips as to technique: Do not use bread flour. You want flour with a low gluten content. You don't want to over-flour your work surface, but you don't want your rolled-out tortilla sticking to it either. I found that the dough adhered less to an unvarnished wood surface (like an old cutting board) than any other surface I tried. A flat dough scraper, or \"bench knife\" is perfect for removing the rolled-out tortilla from the work surface. When rolling out tortillas, dust your rolling pin with flour, and don't be afraid to apply some pressure. Flour tortilla dough is pretty sturdy; but not to the point of rerolling. You don't want tough tortillas. Making perfect circles is harder than it sounds; the dough wants to draw up. So if perfectly circular shapes are important, you can trim away the excess with a sharp knife."

      "First off, I have one thing to say about spices: I am not about to tell you how to season your chili; what you see here is what I do, but please adjust the spicing to suit your own tastes, whether you want to tone it down or spice it up.",
      "Also, for the past couple of years, I have been using Penzeys medium-hot chili powder; if there's a Penzeys store near you or you order over the Internet from them, I highly recommend that blend.",
      "To make the chili, you'll need a large heavy pot, like a Dutch oven.",
      "Over medium-high heat, heat the oil in the pot and add the onion; saute for a couple of minutes, then add the garlic and mushrooms; saute for a couple more minutes.",
      "Next, crumble the beef into the pot and stir well--the idea here is not to completely brown the beef, just take away the raw colour.",
      "While beef is cooking, sprinkle with 1 tbsp of the chili powder; stir well.",
      "After the beef has lost the raw red colour, spoon out any fat should you feel you need to.",
      "Take one of the tins of drained tomatoes and dump into the pot, using a wooden spoon to break up the tomatoes into chunks.",
      "Take the other tin of drained tomatoes and squeeze the tomatoes with your hand, to crush them; add these crushed tomatoes to the pot and combine well.",
      "Stir in the well-drained kidney beans.",
      "In a small bowl, using a fork or a small whisk, combine the brown sugar, flour and cocoa; set aside.",
      "In a large measuring cup, stir together the tomato sauce and tomato paste, then stir or whisk in the cocoa mixture; when combined, add this mixture to the pot and stir well.",
      "Now add the remaining 4 tbsp chili powder, oregano, cumin (if using, sometimes I leave it out), salt and pepper; stir well.",
      "Let mixture start to bubble furiously, then turn the heat way down; after it's simmered for about 15 minutes, taste it; add more spices if you wish.",
      "Let chili simmer, uncovered, for at least one hour, stirring occasionally (longer is better; best is to make it the day before you want it and let it simmer some more on the second day).",
      "If you find it is cooking down too much or getting too thick for your tastes (this is not a thin chili), add some water or, even better, beef broth; best is a slug of beer should you happen to have some (I often don't).",
      "Before serving, make sure you taste the chili and adjust the seasonings as required; I often find it needs more salt.",
      "I serve this with sour cream on the table and usually some chopped raw green onion and shredded cheddar, plus a side of cornbread or cornbread muffins."

I wasnt sure about how this marinade was going to turn out, although I did think that the ingredient combinations were interesting enough to give this a go. Now on to the review: What I noticed was the aromatic citrus flavour of the meat, it was not overly strong in flavour but it was not subtle either. It had a definite taste and flavour. Now I like to eat my steaks medium rare with the centre pink and some blood, this worked actually quite well because the blood had a lemon with a subtle garlic kind of flavour to it which was quite refreshing. I would recommend this marinade to anyone who wants a refreshing, citrus, lemon + subtle garlic with hints of herb flavoured steak. I had sauce on the side but honestly the steak tasted better without it, the marinade was that good.",
      "I combined the ingredients and only had them combine for 1/2 hour; marinate the pre-cut chicken breasts for 2 hours and the chicken was wonderfully tasty! The meat turned out so tasty thanks to this marinade! I didn't let the marinade sit at all before putting the steaks in, but I let the meat soak for 8-10 hours. I had made it to make beef tacos and almost decided to just eat the meat plain instead!"

      "Place a seasoned (or oiled) pizza stone in the middle of the oven and preheat to 450\u00b0 F, at least 30 minutes.",
      "Roll and spread the dough into one 13-inch or two 9-inch circles and place on a floured pizza peel. If you are more comfortable working with one piece of dough at a time, you can shape and dress the second piece while the first is in the oven. If making 2 pizzas, split all the topping measurements in half.",
      "Brush the dough with olive oil to within an inch of the edge, and spread the grated mozzarella to within 1/2 inch of the outer edge. Distribute the chicken over the cheese.",
      "Transfer the pizza(s) to the oven and bake for 8 to 10 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese at the center is melted and bubbly.",
      "Meanwhile, prepare the Greek Salad and Tzatziki Sauce. Place the sauce in a squeeze bottle or syrup dispenser.",
      "Use the peel to remove the pizza from the oven. Slice as desired. Spoon the dressed salad over the pizza. Sprinkle with feta cheese, then drizzle with half the Tzatziki Sauce. Sprinkle with chopped parsley. Serve immediately, with the remaining sauce on the side.",
      "To Make Traditional Pizza Dough: In a small bowl, dissolve the yeast in the water (1 cup plus 1 tablespoon). Make sure the water is not too hot, as this will kill the yeast and prevent the dough from rising.",
      "If using a stand mixer, use the paddle because the dough hook will not mix this size batch efficiently. In the mixing bowl, combine the flour, sugar, salt, and 1 tablespoon of the olive oil and stir by hand just to distribute. Add the dissolved yeast and place the bowl and paddle on the mixer. Start mixing on the lowest speed to mix. Increase the speed slightly and mix for 2 to 3 minutes, until the dough is smooth and elastic. Do not over-knead, as this will build up too much gluten and make the dough difficult to shape. If using a food processor, be sure to use the plastic blade, the metal knife will cut through the gluten strands and keep the dough from developing any \"body\". Proceed as for the stand mixer making sure to stop kneading as soon as the dough forms a smooth ball. Over-kneading could overheat the dough because the mixing bowl is directly above the motor. If mixing by hand, place the dry ingredients in a 4 to 6 quart bowl, and stir to combine. Make a well in the middle and put the liquids, reserving 1 teaspoon of olive oil. Use a wooden spoon to combine the ingredients. Once all the flour is mixed in, turn the dough onto a lightly floured work surface and, with lightly oiled hands, knead the dough for 5 minutes. It should be smooth and elastic, but will still be slightly sticky.",
      "Place the remaining teaspoon of oil in a 1 quart mixing bowl and spread it with your fingertips. Place the dough ball in the bowl, move it around in the oil, then turn it over so that the oiled side is facing upward. Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and allow the dough to rise until doubled in size, 1 1/2 to 2 hours.",
      "About 2 hours before you are ready to assemble your pizza, remove the dough form the refrigerator. If making individual pizzas, use a sharp knife to divide the dough into 2 or 4 equal portions.",
      "Roll each portion of dough into a round ball on a smooth, clean surface, making sure to seal any holes by pinching or rolling.",
      "Place the newly formed dough balls in a glass baking dish, spaced far enough apart to allow for each to double in size. Seal the top of the dish with clear plastic wrap. Set aside at room temperature until the dough balls have doubled in size, about 2 hours. They should be smooth and puffy. Dress the pizza according to the recipe.",
      "For Grilled Greek Chicken: Place the chicken breasts between sheets of waxed or parchment paper and gently pound to a thickness of 1/2 inch. Do not pound them too thin; this is just to ensure that they will cook evenly.",
      "Combine the olive oil and seasonings in a large mixing bowl. Stir to mix. Add the chicken breasts to the bowl, one by one, turning each in the marinade. Place the chicken in the refrigerator for 10 to 20 minutes.",
      "If you have a hot grill available, grill the chicken for 3 to 4 minutes on each side. Do not overcook. If no grill is available, preheat the over to 350 degrees and bake the chicken, skin side up in a pan, for about 30 minutes. The internal temperature should be 165 degrees.",
      "Use the chicken immediately, as desired; or let it cool and refrigerate for up to 3 days.",
      "For The Greek Salad: Combine the cucumber, tomatoes, onion, and olives in a large mixing bowl. Whisk together the remaining ingredients in a small bowl and add to the vegetables. Stir well. Makes 3 cups.",
      "To Make The Tzatziki Sauce: Place all the ingredients in a blender or small food processor and process until smooth. This sauce will keep for up to 5 days in the refrigerator. Whisk before using. Makes 3/4 cups."
