Pat into the base and sides of a well-oiled pie dish. (No size was included in the recipe, but judging from other recipes, my guess is a 10\" pie dish.) Bake in a moderate oven for 10-15 minutes until lightly golden.",
      "FILLING: Cut the pumpkins in half lengthwise and bake, cut-side down in a hot oven for 30 minutes, or until very soft when tested with a skewer. (I'd have them in the oven while the crust was cooking, then once the rice crust has been removed from the oven, I'd increase the heat for maybe 10 minutes.).",
      "Allow the pumpkin halves to cool and when they are cool enough to handle, scoop out the insides, discarding the seeds, and puree the pulp in a blender. If adding ricotta or tofu, add it while pureeing the pumpkin; it will make for a firmer texture.",

      "Pour the vegetable mixture over the rice crust and spread the pumpkin puree over the top of this.",

Tahini is made from ground sesame seeds and is used as both for its binding qualities and for flavouring; it is rich in minerals, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus and iron. Tahini is an ingredient in most hummus recipes. Tamari is pure, top quality soy sauce, and is free from chemicals and preservatives. It can be used for flavouring in place of added salt or stock cubes in soups, vegetable dishes, pies, casseroles and dressings. Tahini and tamari are available at health food stores and large supermarkets."

Start with the uncooked rice in a large bowl, and add several cups (no need to measure) of cold water. Shake and stir the rice around with your hands; you'll see the water turn white. Drain the water from the rice, and keep repeating this step until the water stops turning completely white. Finally, add water to the bowl to cover the rice and let it soak for at least 6 hours (overnight is best).",
      "If you have a rice cooker, use it to prepare the rice. If not, add the rice and 1 cup of water to a medium pot. Bring the water to a boil, then cover the pot and turn the heat down to medium-low. Let the rice cooked undisturbed for 20 minutes, then check to see if it is done. Cook longer if needed. When the rice is ready, set it aside to cool.",

      "Add the cooled rice into the pot with the coconut milk mixture. Stir to combine, and continue to cook over medium-high heat until the mixture is the consistency of thick porridge. Remove from heat. You could serve this mixture by itself or with some mango as a dessert rather than continuing with the recipe -- we eat it this way from time to time.",

      "Rinse the banana leaves and cut them down to around the size of a standard sheet of paper (8.5 in x 11 in).",
      "To make the khao dome, lay out a single banana leaf (sideways, or wider than it is tall). Plop a small dollop of the rice mixture in the center, then lay a slice of plantain on it, and add another dollop of rice on top of the plantain. Wet your fingers and use your hands to form the rice and plantain into a rectangle (taller than wide, opposite of the banana leaf). Now fold one side of the leaf over the rice, then fold the other side of the leaf back over the rice. Continue to wrap the leaf around the rice until you run out of leaf. Fold the top of the leaf down and the bottom of the leaf up; now you should have a nice little leaf package. You could tie it closed with some string, but I don't think it's necessary.",
      "You'll need a steaming basket for this step. You can easily pick one up at a local asian market for a few dollars; I think it's a great investment! Stack the khao dome in the steam basket and cover. Fit the basket over a large pot with 2-3 inches of water in it, and heat the water to boiling over high heat. Steam the khao dome for 40 minutes and then remove them from the basket to cool.",

      "2) Please do your homework on making a safe recipe free from bad bacteria. That is, a good sauerkraut, which is fermented and then refrigerated (which can keep up to 1-2 months). This recipe is not intended for the canning process which uses a hot water bath to seal the sauerkraut and can keep for an extended period of time. This recipe is only written as a general guide only and specific quantities of ingredients are not listed. Because it is important for you to search and follow the written/proper proportions (from a published recipe within an established website or cook book) for the cabbage, salt, vinegar, water, etc and recommended \"times\" for fermentation.

      "While the grease is heating beat the egg in a shallow bowl. Beat in the milk, seasonings, and finally the flour. The batter will be thin and may have a few lumps.",
      "Toss a skillet's worth of squash sticks in the batter and coat thoroughly.",
      "When the grease is ready carefully drop in the battered sticks, being sure not to drop them right on top of each other. If you are in doubt of your ability to do this without burning yourself use tongs.",
      "Yes, the thin batter will have drippy bits that dangle from the sticks and there will be a lot of little, batter crispies in the grease. The drippy bits are what makes this batter light and crisp where a thicker batter might be heavy.",
      "If necessary turn the pieces over partway through so as to brown them evenly.",
      "When nicely brown transfer the sticks to the prepared pan and put them into the oven while you fry the next batch. Do not try to fry too much at once or the temperature of the grease will drop and the coating will end up soggy and greasy.",
      "When the squash is done serve with grated Parmesan at the table.",
      "Some people might like ranch or blue cheese dressing instead or a simple dipping sauce made from sour cream, fresh dill, and a bit of lemon juice to thin it.",
      "This recipe doubles nicely. But if you need more than that I suggest making separate, additional batches since the rising power fades after long sitting.",
      "Leftovers can be reheated on a baking sheet in a 450 degree oven. The microwave would make them soggy and unpleasant.",
      "This batter is also good on eggplant, onion rings, and chicken tenders.",
