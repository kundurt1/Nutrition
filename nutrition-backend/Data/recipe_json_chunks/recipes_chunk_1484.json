When this happens, lift the pan off the heat, swirl it until the bubbles subside, and then continue cooking; reduce the heat slightly if the mixture refuses to simmer down. When it is the right consistency, the bubbles will be very thick, large, and foamy and you'll have between 1/2 and 2/3 cup of syrup.

Note that the dough will not pull so much that it completely cleans the bowl, but if the dough is too sticky and is not pulling away from the sides at all, throw a small handful of flour into the bowl to make it less sticky.

Mix for about 30 seconds, or until the batter becomes loose and liquidy, with the consistency of heavy cream.

While the tempura is cooking, check the oil temperature with a candy thermometer. Regulate the heat to maintain a constant 360\u00b0F oil temperature. If the oil is too hot, the tempura will burn; if too low, the tempura will come out soggy and greasy.",

Strain the curd through a fine-mesh strainer set over the container of a Vitamix and blend on low speed for a few seconds, then add the butter 2 or 3 pieces at a time, blending until incorporated. Add the zest, if using, and blend to incorporate. Let the curd cool to room temperature.",

Bake for 8 minutes, then rotate the pan and bake for another 8 minutes, or until the dough is set and no longer sticks to the parchment paper. Remove the parchment and rice (store the rice for future use), return the pan to the oven, and bake for another 12 minutes, or until the dough is cooked through and golden brown. Set the pan on a cooling rack and cool completely. Run the tip of a paring knife between the top of the crust and the ring to loosen the crust, then lift off the ring.",
      "Meanwhile, make a Swiss meringue: Place the egg whites and sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer and set over a saucepan of simmering water. Whisk until the mixture reaches 160\u00b0F/71.1\u00b0C, then immediately put the bowl on the mixer, attach the whisk attachment, and whip at medium-high speed for about 5 minutes, until the whites hold stiff peaks and are cool. Transfer to the pastry bag fitted with the 1-inch tip.",
      "Use the round cutter to cut the frozen madeleine layer into 6 rounds.",
      "Fill the pastry bag fitted with the 1/2-inch plain tip with the lemon curd.",

Hold the pastry bag vertically over the center of each cake, about 1 inch from the surface, and pipe the meringue to cover about two-thirds of the surface (20 grams each), then pull the bag up to form a dome with as much additional meringue as you'd like.",
      "Hold a small offset spatula at the tip of the domed meringue and pull it to the edges of the crust, forming a smooth line from the tip to the outside of the shell. Wipe off the spatula and continue around the tart to form a cone shape, then use the spatula to form irregular peaks in the meringue. Using the propane torch, brown the top of the meringue.",
      "The tarts are best the same day they are assembled. They can be refrigerated for 4 to 6 hours; remove them from the refrigerator 20 minutes before serving."

Cover tightly with plastic wrap and let sit at room temperature for 12 to 16 hours. The biga should double in size.",
      ": At least a day before you plan to bake, combine the dried cherries, bourbon and lemon zest. Allow to sit, covered, at room temperature overnight until the fruit absorbs the alcohol. Shake periodically to make sure your cherries hydrate evenly.",
      ": Place the remaining 200 grams flour, all of the biga, the egg yolks, the remaining 50 grams buttermilk, and the yeast in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook attachment. Mix on low speed until the dough is fully incorporated and smooth. About 4 minutes.",
      "When the initial mix has come fully together into a smooth ball, add the salt and sugar. Continue mixing on slow speed until the dough is once again smooth, about 4 minutes.",
      "When the dough has once again come together, turn the mixer to medium-high speed and knead until the dough forms a slightly stiff, but stretchy and elastic ball, about 4 minutes.",
      "Return the mixer to slow speed and add the butter in small pieces. Mix until butter is fully incorporated into dough, scraping down the sides of the work bowl with a spatula as necessary. When the butter is fully incorporated, the dough should feel looser, and stretchier than before, but not greasy. About 10 minutes. If the dough continues to feel greasy but you can't see any pieces of butter in the bowl, allow dough to continue to mix on slow speed until the oily feel has fully dissipated, up to 5 minutes longer.",
      "With the butter is fully incorporated, drain any excess liquid from the soaked cherries. Add the cherries and toasted hazelnuts to the dough. Mix low speed until your dough re-forms into a coherent ball with cherries and nuts evenly distributed throughout.",
      "Using a dough spatula, transfer dough to a lightly floured work surface, shape into a ball, and place the ball seam-side down into the panettone mold. If you wish to make smaller panettona, divide dough now into the number of pieces you desire and place into appropriately sized molds. The ball of dough should fill somewhere between a quarter and a third of the mold.",
      "Beat egg well and brush over the top of the panettone. Lightly but securely cover your filled panettone mold with plastic wrap. Allow to proof in a warm, slightly humid place until the dough fills the mold roughly 2/3 high, 10 to 12 hours.",
      "1 hour before you plan to bake, adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and preheat oven to 350\u00b0F (325\u00b0F for a convection oven). When the panettone is appropriately risen, apply a second coat of egg wash, place it on a rimmed baking sheet, and place in oven.",
      "Bake the panettone until the tops are a deep, golden brown, and a pastry tester or knife pushed into the center comes out clean, approximately 45 minutes, rotating the loaf midway through the bake.",
      "When done, allow to cool for at least 2 hours and up to overnight. Stored in a plastic bag, the panettone will stay moist and fresh for at least 4 days."

Cook the okonomiyaki in batches. Spoon the cabbage and batter mixture into the skillet to form a pancake about 6 inches in diameter and about 1 inch thick. Don't push down on the cabbage; you want a fluffy pancake. Gently lay about one-fourth of the pork belly slices on top of the pancake, trying not to overlap.",

Gently press down on the pancake with the spatula (don't push too hard, you don't want batter spilling from the sides). Cook for about 5 more minutes, then flip the pancake again, so the side with the pork belly is now facing up. (If the okonomiyaki comes apart when you flip it, don't worry; use a spatula to tuck any stray ingredients back into the pancake.) Cook for about 2 more minutes. When it's ready, the pancake should be lightly browned on both sides, the pork cooked through, and the cabbage inside tender.",

When it's ready, transfer the cabbage to a clean kitchen towel or large cheesecloth. Roll up the cloth and wring out the liquid in the cabbage, like you're wringing dry a wet towel. This is a key step so the gyoza doesn't become watery. Wring out as much liquid from the cabbage as possible. Do this in batches if it's easier.",

Use your hands to mix the ingredients together for about 2 minutes. Mash and mush the mixture together, squeezing it through your fingers, so it turns into a sticky filling that will hold together when you spoon it into a dumpling skin.",
      "To make the dumplings, prepare a tray by lightly dusting it with katakuriko. Place a gyoza skin in the palm of one hand with the floured side down. (The skins are sold with one side floured.) Dip a finger in the katakuriko mixed with warm water and wet the entire edge of the skin. This water-starch mixture is the \"glue\" that will hold the skin closed. Add about 1 tablespoon of the filling to the center of the skin. Use the index fingers and thumbs of both hands to fold the skin and pinch it together. Place the completed gyoza on the tray, fold side up. Repeat until you've used up all the filling.",
      "To prepare the dipping sauce, combine the soy sauce, vinegar, and rayu. A classic proportion is 4 parts soy sauce to 2 parts vinegar to 1 part rayu. Adjust to your own taste. Pour the dipping sauce into individual small bowls and set aside.",
      "To cook the gyoza, preheat a nonstick pan or cast-iron skillet over high heat for about 5 minutes. (We like to use a 12-inch-diameter skillet with a cover to prepare gyoza.) When the skillet is hot, add 1 table-spoon of the sesame oil, making sure the entire surface is coated (you can use a wadded-up paper towel to carefully spread the oil). Begin adding the gyoza, one at a time, in neat rows, with the seam side up. A 12-inch skillet will hold about 20 gyoza. Once all the gyoza are added, fry them for about 10 seconds. Now quickly pour in the water over the gyoza and cover the skillet tightly. Cook over high heat for about 4 minutes. Uncover the skillet; there should be little or no water remaining. Cook for 1 minute more. Drizzle the remaining 1 tablespoon sesame oil over the gyoza and cook for an additional 1 minute, for about 6 minutes total cooking time. The gyoza should look glossy with the skins cooked through. Turn off the heat and use a thin fish spatula to transfer the gyoza to a serving plate, this time with the seam side down (you want to show off the beautifully crispy, browned bottoms of the dumplings). Serve the dumplings steaming hot, with the dipping sauce on the side. Dip in the sauce to eat.",

You want it rather soft and smooth, but not so thin it can't hold a shape. If you have leftover mayonnaise, it is delicious for dipping fresh vegetables. Or on toast. I like it on toast.",

      "When the chicken is halfway through cooking, peel and halve the cucumber and scoop out the seeds. Set on a board and bang the pieces gently with a pestle or rolling pin. This should break them up a little. Now break them into chunks with your hands.",
      "Crush the garlic with a pinch of the salt and massage this-and the rest of the salt-into the cucumber. Put in a small plastic bag, squeeze out the air and put in the fridge for 10 minutes. When you're ready to eat, tip the cucumber into a sieve so the juices can drain away. Add the shredded ginger. You can add shiso leaves if you can find them (I can't, I have no Japanese shop nearby). Nothing else really tastes like it, but I sometimes add mint. Serve the chicken with brown rice or rice vermicelli (the rice vermicelli is good served cold) and the cucumber."

Transfer them to a salad spinner and spin them dry.",

Once the oil appears to shimmer, add the mustard seeds, cover the pan, and cook until the seeds have stopped popping (not unlike popcorn), about 30 seconds. Add the ginger and chiles and stir-fry until the ginger is lightly browned and the chiles are much more pungent, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the beet greens, the cubed beets, and salt and stir well to coat them with the mustard seeds. The liquid in the beet greens will start to pool at the bottom of the pan and boil instantly, loosening the stuck-on bits of ginger and chiles, effectively deglazing the pan and releasing those flavors into the beets. Reduce the heat to medium, cover the pan, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the beets are tender when pierced with a fork, 10 to 15 minutes (the beets also will sweat, releasing some liquid, in which they will braise).",

    "title": "favorite buttermilk skillet-fried chicken from 'mastering the art of southern cooking",
    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "Pour the buttermilk and salt into a nonreactive container or a plastic ziplock bag. Add the chicken pieces. Close the bag and refrigerate for 1 to 2 hours.",
      "Remove the chicken from the buttermilk brine, lightly shake, and move to a colander over a bowl or sink so that the excess buttermilk drains off yet leaves the skin moist enough for the flour to adhere. Larger chickens take longer to cook, so they should be rinsed to prevent burning. If there is not time to brine, sprinkle the damp chicken lightly with salt, then add salt, freshly ground pepper, and hot red pepper to the flour.",
      "Meanwhile, melt shortening in a 9- to 10-inch heavy-bottomed or cast-iron skillet. Add the butter in increments to the melted fat, making sure that the melted mixture will go only halfway up the chicken and that the skillet is no more than half full. While the fat is heating, pepper the chicken on both sides with the two peppers. Spread flour on a rimmed baking sheet and lightly add a bit of black pepper. Pat the still damp chicken in the flour on both sides. Knock off any excess flour by lightly tapping the bone-edge of the chicken on the counter and arrange around the sides of the colander in a single layer.",
      "A bit before the fat registers 375 degrees on a deep-fat thermometer (or sizzles when the exposed end of the leg bone is inserted in the fat), flour the individual chicken pieces again, tapping the bone-edge of the chicken pieces on the counter to remove excess flour as desired. After each piece is floured, start adding the largest pieces to the hot fat, usually the dark meat, skin side down, to the hottest spot in the skillet, reserving the white meat for cooler spots, small pieces in last. It is helpful to add them in a pattern, such as clockwise, so removal is guess-free, with first pieces in/first pieces out. Try not to crowd the chicken in the skillet, as too much chicken in ratio to the fat will cool down the fat. The pieces may touch but not overlap. The rule of thumb is that the bottom of the pan should be visible in places. Keep a watch on the chicken, moving the pan as necessary over the heat so that all the pieces of the chicken are browned evenly. This is particularly important if the pan and burner are different sizes, as they usually are, and the heat is concentrated in one area.",
      "Carefully maintain the heat of the fat while chicken is being added to the pan, preferably with the help of a deep-fat thermometer.",
      "Partially cover the pan with a lid for 6 minutes. The temperature of the fat should be at least 325 degrees; remove the lid and continue to cook 3 to 4 minutes more, until the pieces are deep golden brown on the bottom. Turn the browned chicken with tongs and cook uncovered to brown the second side for 8 to 10 minutes more. Listen and look for the sizzle around the chicken pieces. Smaller pieces will finish cooking before larger pieces, so remove these from the pan as needed. The internal temperature of the chicken should register 165 degrees when an instant-read thermometer is inserted into the flesh of the chicken, not touching the bone. The juices of the chicken will run clear and the sizzling sound will have greatly diminished.",
      "Drain the chicken on crumpled paper towels on a rack. Perfect fried chicken is divine either hot or cold.",
      "Add a chunk of bacon or other pork fat to the oil for more flavor, removing it if it seems to be burning."

Or, instead of frying, they can be briefly broiled before simmering. And if you don't want the sauce, just finish the cooking in the skillet and serve the panfried meatballs crisp and hot."

If, after 1 minute, the smell of jasmine is not pronounced, add more jasmine. It's a really subtle flavor and has a habit of hiding under the rhubarb, so make sure it's really present in the simple syrup to begin with. Steep for 10 minutes and then strain out the jasmine, pressing down on the flowers to extract as much liquid as possible. Let cool. Can you still smell it? If not, add more and reboil.

Bring the liquid to a gentle boil over medium-high heat. Cover the pot and reduce the heat to low. Simmer very gently (do not let the mixture come to a boil) until the nectarines are tender when pierced with the tip of a knife, 5 to 10 minutes. Carefully remove the nectarines with a slotted spoon and transfer them to a bowl of ice water until completely cool. Drain the nectarines and pat them dry; peel the skin away with your fingertips and thinly slice the fruit into wedges, discarding the pits.",

      "In a medium pot, combine corn and water; pick out any stones that may be hiding among the corn kernels. Add pickling lime and set over medium heat. Bring to a simmer, adjusting heat to maintain simmer. Cook until corn is tenderized but not overly soft, about 45 minutes. (You can chew a kernel up to test, or break one open: It's done when the kernel looks mostly hydrated but still has a tiny core of visible starchiness.) The timing can vary based on corn type, so start checking at 30 minutes and continue cooking beyond 45 minutes if it's still too raw. Top up with water as needed to keep corn submerged.",
      "Remove from heat, cover pot, and let corn stand at room temperature overnight. The bran on the corn should now rub off easily. Drain corn in a colander, set under running cold water, and rub kernels vigorously between hands to remove most of the bran; corn should turn a brighter shade as bran comes off. Allow to drain well, then transfer corn to a food processor.",
      "Process corn at high speed, adding as much water as you need, little by little, to help the blades process the corn, about 10 minutes; scrape down the sides of the bowl at least a few times during processing. The dough is ready when no large corn chunks remain and the puree has the texture of a thick hummus.",
      "Scrape corn dough into a mixing bowl and add masa harina, little by little, working it in with your hands, until corn dough has the texture of Play-Doh: soft and supple, but not wet. To test texture, roll a small ball of dough between your hands, then press it between your fingers: If the edges crack, it's too dry, but if it sticks to your skin, it's too wet. Work in more water or masa harina, little by little, until you hit that sweet spot.",
      "Cut 2 sides plus the zipper-top off of a zipper-lock bag, leaving it attached on only 1 side; line tortilla press with the plastic and trim to fit. Preheat well-seasoned griddle or cast iron skillet over medium-high heat. Working with one piece at a time, roll a portion of corn dough into a golf ball-sized ball, then flatten slightly. Set portioned corn dough between the sheets of plastic, then press flat using the tortilla press. Try not to press so hard that the tortilla edge becomes too thin; about 1mm in thickness or slightly less is what you want. Rotate plastic 180 degrees and press again to ensure even thickness.",
      "Carefully peel tortilla from plastic and place in preheated skillet. Cook until bottom side is dried, about 30 seconds, then flip using a thin metal spatula and cook other side until dried, about 30 seconds longer; tortilla may puff up and brown lightly in spots, which is fine. Adjust heat as necessary to prevent scorching. (If tortillas start to stick to griddle or skillet, rub cooking surface with a paper towel lightly moistened with vegetable oil, then buff away any excess oiliness.)",

      "Set a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 350\u00b0F.",
      "For the cake batter, combine the flour, 3/4 cup of the sugar, the baking powder, and salt in a bowl and stir well to mix.",
      "Put the cream and vanilla in a large bowl and whisk by hand until thickened and stiff. Whisk in the eggs, one at a time. Whisk in the remaining 3/4 cup sugar. Whisk in the flour mixture in 3 separate additions, whisking smooth after each addition.",
      "Divide the batter between the 2 prepared pans and smooth the tops. Bake the layers until they are well risen, deep golden, and firm in the center when pressed with a fingertip, 30 to 35 minutes.",
      "Cool the layers in the pans on racks for 5 minutes, unmold them, and cool them right side up on the racks.",
      "While the layers are baking, prepare the caramel whipped cream. Combine the sugar and water in a heavy saucepan and stir well to mix. Put 1/2 cup of the cream in a second small saucepan. Place the first pan on medium heat and cook undisturbed until the sugar begins to melt and caramelize-you'll see a few wisps of smoke coming out of the sugar. Reduce the heat to low and stir occasionally so that the sugar melts and caramelizes evenly. Remove it from the heat when the caramel is still very pale (the sugar will continue to darken off the heat). Slide the pan with the cream off the burner. As soon as the cream has some bubbles around the edge, add it to the caramel at arm's length, averting your face-the caramel will boil up and may splatter out of the pan. Pour the diluted caramel into a medium bowl and cool it to room temperature. Stir in the remaining 2 1/2 cups cream and the vanilla and chill until you are ready to finish the cake (this can be made the day before).",
      "To finish the cake, whip the cream mixture by hand or with an electric mixer until it holds a firm peak. Place one of the cake layers on a cake cardboard or platter and spread it with a little less than half the whipped cream. Invert the second layer onto the cream and spread the outside of the cake with the remaining whipped cream, swirling it with the point of the spatula."

Cover loosely with plastic wrap and let rise at room temperature for 12 hours, or until almost tripled in volume. Now, it's ready to use. (Keep the timing in mind. If you plan to bake bread in the morning, get the starter going early the night before.)",
      "When making bread daily, store the starter at room temperature and feed three times a day. If baking less frequently, store it in the refrigerator and feed every other week. To feed the starter, scoop out 2 cups (bake with it, give it away, or trash it) and replace it with 2 cups high-protein flour and 2 cups warm water (100 to 110\u00b0F), stirring until blended. Most of the bread recipes in this book call for 1 to 2 cups of starter, so you can use that amount to bake with, then replace it with a 50-50 mix of flour and water.",
      "Put the flour, starter, and water in the bowl of a stand mixer. Crumble in the yeast.Using the dough hook, mix on low speed until everything is moist, about 4 minutes, scraping the bowl as needed with a rubber spatula. Increase the mixer speed to medium and mix until the dough clings to the dough hook, about 3 minutes more. Add the salt and mix until the dough is very soft and stretchy, another 3 minutes.",
      "Put the dough in an oiled bowl, turning to coat it with oil. Cover with plastic wrap and set in a warm spot (90\u00b0F) until doubled in size, about 1 hour.",

      "To roll out each ball of dough, remove the dough from the refrigerator about 1 hour before using. It will stretch more easily when it's warm. Flatten the ball on a floured work surface, then hold the disk in your hands in the air and circle your fingers around the edge, pinching gently around the edge to make a border. It's easier to start stretching pizza dough in the air instead of on a work surface, because in the air gravity will pull down the dough, stretching it from where it's held in your fingers. Once it's stretched to about 8 inches in diameter, put the dough on the counter and pat it out with your fingertips from the center toward the edge to fully stretch the round of dough. Gently push your palms into the center of the dough to gently stretch it away toward to the edges. Pat and stretch to a round about 12 inches in diameter and a little more than a 1/4 inch thick, with a thicker rim. Top and bake as you like.",

      "To make the biga: At least 1 day before cooking the muffins, combine the flour, water, and yeast in a small bowl to make a sticky dough. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 12 hours or up to 24 hours. The biga will rise slightly.",
      "To make the dough: Combine the biga, water, yeast, olive oil, and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer. Affix the bowl to the mixer and fi t with the paddle attachment. Mix on low speed until the mixture looks creamy, about 1 minute. Mix in 3 cups/435 g of the flour to make a soft, sticky dough. Turn off the mixer, cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and let stand for 20 minutes. (To make by hand, combine the water, biga, yeast, oil, and salt in a large bowl and break up the biga with a wooden spoon. Stir until the biga dissolves. Mix in enough flour to make a cohesive but tacky dough. Cover and let stand for 20 minutes.)",
      "Mix in enough of the remaining flour to make a soft dough that barely cleans the mixer bowl. Replace the paddle with the dough hook. Knead on medium-low speed (if the dough climbs up the hook, just pull it down) until the dough is smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes. Turn out the dough onto a lightly floured work surface to check its texture. It should feel tacky but not stick to the work surface. (To make by hand, knead on a floured work surface, adding more flour as necessary, until the dough is smooth and feels tacky, about 10 minutes.)",
      "Shape the dough into a ball. Oil a medium bowl. Put the dough in the bowl and turn to coat with oil, leaving the dough smooth-side up. Cover with plastic wrap. Let stand in a warm place until almost doubled in volume, about 2 hours. (The dough can also be refrigerated for 8 to 12 hours. Let stand at room temperature for 1 hour before proceeding to the next step.)",
      "Using a bowl scraper, scrape the dough out of the bowl onto a lightly floured work surface. Cut into twelve equal pieces. Shape each into a 4-in/10-cm round. Sprinkle an even layer of cornmeal over a half-sheet pan. Place the rounds on the cornmeal about 1 in/2.5 cm apart. Turn the rounds to coat both sides with cornmeal. Loosely cover the pan with plastic wrap. Let stand in a warm place until the rounds have increased in volume by half and a finger pressed into a round leaves an impression for a few seconds before filling up, about 1 hour.",
      "Melt 2 Tbsp of the clarified butter in a large, heavy skillet (preferably cast-iron) over medium heat until melted and hot, but not smoking. In batches, add the dough rounds to the skillet. Cook, adjusting the heat as needed so the muffins brown without scorching, adding more clarified butter as needed. The undersides should be nicely browned, about 6 minutes. Turn and cook until the other sides are browned and the muffins are puffed, about 6 minutes more. Transfer to a paper towel-lined half-sheet pan and let cool. (It will be tempting to eat these hot off the griddle, but let them stand for at least 20 minutes to complete the cooking with carry-over heat.) Repeat with the remaining muffins, wiping the cornmeal out of the skillet with paper towels and adding more clarified butter as needed.",
      "Split each muffin in half horizontally with a serrated knife. Toast in a broiler or toaster oven (they may be too thick for a standard toaster) until lightly browned. Serve hot. (The muffins can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days.)",
      "Melt the butter in a small saucepan over medium heat until completely melted and boiling. Cook until the butter stops sputtering, about 1 minute. Remove from the heat and let stand for 5 minutes. Skim the foam from the surface of the butter.",
      "Line a wire sieve with dampened, wrung-out cheesecloth and place over a medium bowl. Carefully pour the clear, yellow melted butter through the sieve, leaving the milky residue behind in the saucepan. (Discard the residue.) Pour into a small container and cover. Refrigerate until ready to use."

Using a sharp knife, trim the top and bottom of the orange (by either a 1/4-inch or 1/2-inch). Do this over a bowl to capture the juices. Then, carefully cut away the peel, making sure to remove the pith just under the peel as well. (Do this by cutting from the top down.) Then, remove the wedges by cutting as close to the white membrane as possible, through the fruit to the center, then following through along the very next membrane. This should result in nice, juicy-looking segments."

      "Measure 16 ounces of powdered sugar (4 cups; 450g) and place in the bowl of a stand mixer, then add egg whites, rum, vanilla, salt, and cream of tartar. Stir with a flexible spatula to form a smooth paste, then set over a gently simmering water bath in a 3-quart saucier and stir until paste is hot to the touch, or about 150\u00b0F (66\u00b0C) on an instant-read thermometer. Transfer to stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, add remaining 2 ounces powdered sugar (1/2 cup; 60g), and mix at low speed to combine. Increase speed to medium and beat until thick and frosting-like, about 20 seconds or until the mixing bowl feels cool to the touch. Use immediately as a thick frosting or to make chunky decorations, like the buttons on a gingerbread man or little rosettes on a cake; color, if desired, according to instructions in step 3. For a thinner royal icing, used to make an even glaze for the tops of cookies, or to attempt a more ambitious, elegant design, thin according to instructions in step 2.",
      "Reduce speed to low, add cream, and continue mixing until smooth. Remove bowl from mixer and lift paddle attachment, moving it in a figure 8 pattern as icing streams back into bowl. If the figure 8 disappears in exactly 8 seconds, the icing is ready to use as a cookie glaze. If it melts away faster, thicken by adding a spoonful of powdered sugar. If it takes longer than 8 seconds to disappear, thin by adding a few drops of cream. Repeat this test, making adjustments as you go, until the figure 8 takes exactly 8 seconds to disappear.",
      "Divide icing among several small bowls, one for each color you'd like to prepare. Cover each with plastic wrap pressed directly against the surface. Working with one bowl at a time, stir in a few drops of gel paste. When your desired color has been achieved, immediately transfer to a disposable pastry bag fitted with a",

Work quickly if topping with sprinkles or a secondary icing color, as royal icing will form a crust within 90 seconds. If you'd like to read more on the basics of decorating, check out my",
      "for lots of photos, videos, and ideas. For cookies to keep around the house, allow royal icing to air-dry until firm, about 4 hours. For cookies to package and ship, allow royal icing to dry until hardened through and through, about 6 to 8 hours more.",
      "Cookies frosted with royal icing can be stored up to 1 week at room temperature; in a pinch, their shelf life can be extended to about 10 days with refrigeration. Unfortunately, cookies with royal icing should not be frozen, as the water in the royal icing will form ice crystals that will melt as liquid water when thawed, creating a blotchy appearance on the surface of the frosting."
