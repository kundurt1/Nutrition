The next day, making gumbo along with a good bottle of wine will be a happy thing. Start with two stainless steel skillets. In one start the roux by combining 3/4 cup oil and 1/2 cup flour over a low fire, and stir constantly. It usually takes an hour and 15 min. to make the roux. You may also need to add a little more oil so that it is like a medium thick gravy. Stir it until it becomes brown and the flour sort of separates from the oil. At the same time, in the other skillet, put in the remainder of the oil and saute the okra and the white onions until they are wilted. Add the remaining vegetables with the salt and pepper and stir them until they are wilted and soft. When the roux is ready, add it to the vegetables and mix well. Transfer your gumbo to a soup pot. Start adding your boiling water, Rotel, chicken broth, shrimp and remaining ingredients. Cook on a low heat for about 4 hours. About 30 min. before serving add your crab meat. Serve over rice and let the GUMBO PARTY BEGIN!"
