      "Now test if the mixture has warmed to body temperature, taking care that it does not exceed 110 degrees.",
      "Attach the bowl to the mixer, and with the whisk attachment, whip on medium speed (#5) until the mixture has cooled and increased considerably in volume (tripled or more), appears light in texture and almost white in color, and has thickened to the consistency of a whole egg meringue (about 3 to 4 minutes).",

      "With a rubber spatula, smooth the top of the batter, working from the center outward, until a slightly raised ridge forms around the outside rim.",
      "(Since the cake bakes faster near the metal rim, mounding the batter around the edges assures a more evenly baked layer.)",
      "Bake for 25 to 27 minutes, or until the top springs back slightly when lightly touched, sounding spongy when tapped, and the sides begin to contract from the pan.",
      "Place the cake on a rack to cool for 5 to 10 minutes.",
      "With mitts, tilt and rotate the pan, and gently tap it on the counter to see if the cake is releasing from the metal sides.",

      "Cutting the Cake:",
      "The genoise is cut in such a fashion that its exterior is left intact, but a core is removed.",
      "Imagine a 1/2-inch thick border around the outside edge of the cake.",
      "Now, using the tip of a shortbladed paring knife, cut along the imaginary line with a sawing motion around the entire cake, stopping short of the cake's bottom by 1/2-inch.",
      "Loosen the 6 1/2-inch circle or inner core of the cake without disturbing the outer shell.",
      "Using a small serrated knife, such as a tomato knife, insert the blade into the side of the cake 1/2-inch from the bottom, creating a small slit.",
      "Keeping the knife horizontal and level, pivot the serrated edge in one direction, trying not to cut through the outer shell of cake.",
      "(This will eventually loosen the entire bottom of the inner core.)",
      "Remove the knife, insert it back into the slit with the serrated edge facing the opposite direction, and pivot the other way.",
      "Repeat three more times, rotating the cake a quarter turn each time.",
      "After completing four cuts, you should have loosened the core sufficiently to lift it out.",
      "Test it gently with a fork around the edge of the core; if you meet resistance anywhere, insert the serrated knife back into the nearest slit, and pivot the blade again.",
      "Be patient and keep pivoting as well as tracing the top circle, and soon you'll be able to lift the core with the aid of the fork.",
      "Remove the center core of the cake; it should measure about 6 1/2 to 7 inches in diameter and be about 1-inch thick.",
      "Place the core on a flat work surface.",
      "Mentally divide it in half horizontally.",
      "Now, using the paring knife, cut all the way around the side of the cake about 1/2-inch deep on that imaginary line.",
      "Slide a 12-inch knife into the cut.",
      "Holding the knife steady in that path, rotate the cake in a circle into the knife blade, cutting in a slow sawing motion all around, until the cake is evenly split into two 1/2-inch thick layers.",
      "Remove the top 1/2-inch layer, wrap it in plastic, and save for future use.",
      "Split the remaining 1/2- inch layer into two 1/4-inch thick layers, using the same cutting procedure as above.",
      "Remove the top 1/4-inch layer and set aside.",
      "(Use a removable quiche bottom to aid in lifting, if necessary.)",
      "In a 2 to 3 quart mixing bowl, manipulate the cream cheese with a rubber spatula until smooth.",

      "Detach whisk and remove bowl; set whisk close by to use later.",
      "Combine the water and sugar in a heavybottomed saucepan or sugar pot.",
      "Place over low heat, swirling the pot occasionally to distribute heat until the sugar completely dissolves (about 2 minutes).",
      "Keep a pastry brush in a small glass of water to wash down any sugar crystals that form along the sides of the pot.",
      "As soon as the sugar has dissolved, increase heat to high and boil until it registers 238 degrees (soft ball stage) on a mercury candy thermometer (about 5 minutes).",
      "Quickly pour the syrup into the center of the whipped yolks and whisk vigorously by hand to combine, using the mixer's whisk attachment.",
      "Reattach the bowl and its whisk to the mixer and whip on medium speed (#5) until the egg yolk mixture thickens, increases in volume, lightens in color and texture and cools to room temperature (about 4 minutes).",
