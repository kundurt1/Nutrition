      "Maria sent it to me, for that I shall always be grateful.",
      "It's a rich and unusual soup - thickly white from lowfat milk and dark rye flour; sour from fermenting the flour into traditional barscz kwaszony zytni (the Russian kvass), tart from freshly grated horseradish, and highly textured from minced egg and smoked kielbasa and rye bread.",
      "Maria says, \"it's something you have to acquire a taste for, but once you do, there's no substitute for it.\"",

      "Continue slapping dough, lightly flouring the surface if necessary to prevent excessive sticking, until the dough is smooth and elastic and holds together in one piece.",
      "Its all right if the dough is still slightly sticky but it should be much less sticky than it was before kneading.",

      "Conventional Method of Kneading:",
      "Put the dough on the work surface.",
