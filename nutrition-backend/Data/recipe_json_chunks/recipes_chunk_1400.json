      "Pre-heat your oven to 180*C, 360*F and set aside a Dutch oven (such as a Le Creuset) or tagine. If you don't have either, you can also use a medium-sized 100% metal saucepan with a lid.",
      "Toss the chicken with salt, pepper, and 2 Tbsp of the tagine spice mixture. Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a frying pan until just before it smokes, then add the chicken skin-side-down (if any) to sear, about 2-3 minutes. Stir-fry until just-cooked on all sides then transfer with tongs to your Dutch oven/tagine/saucepan along with all the pan juices. Add the raw cauliflower, carrots and zucchini to the pot and toss it with the chicken.",
      "Cover the pot of chicken and vegetables with its lid and put the pot on a low rack inside your preheated oven. Set your timer to 20 minutes, then prepare the tomatoes: slice from the tomatoes vertically from the \"steam\" area downwards, into six wedges, then remove the pulp from the middle of each wedge to get tomato \"petals\".",
      "When 20 minutes is up, carefully open the lid and add the raisins, tomatoes, olives and preserved lemons (or lemon juice & olive juice mixture). Cover the pot and set your timer for a further 20 minutes.",
      "Voila: your bubbling, beautifully spiced tagine is ready to be topped with coriander and almonds, and served with couscous. This tagine be prepared one day ahead, chilled and and re-heated the following day for dinner party glory.",
      "My favorite way to make couscous: pour 1 large mug dry couscous into a heat-proof salad bowl, then add 1 large mug of boiling-hot chicken stock (or boiling water). Cover immediately with a plate and let it rest for 3 minutes. Remove the cover, add 2 teaspoons of olive oil and use a fork to fluff up and separate the grains (if you used hot water instead of stock, I would also add a hefty pinch of sea salt), then mix in some finely chopped cilantro or parsley."

Into the well, put the oil, the unbeaten egg, and the water. Mix together until smooth, but don't overmix. The batter should be the consistency of pancake batter.",
      "Spread some of the melted butter in the bottom of a roasting pan. I use my 11 x 14 All Clad lasagna pan. The size of the pan will determine the thickness of the finished batsaria. I like mine thick-ish, while my mother liked hers very thin, almost cracker-like. Spread some of the batter thinly on top of the butter.",
      "Beat the 4 eggs until they're light and airy, then add them to the spinach mixture, stirring gently. My Aunt Elizabeth (she who was named Freedom in Greek) said that adding the well-beaten eggs at the last minute is one of the secrets to a good outcome for this dish. Spoon the spinach mixture into the baking pan, spreading it as evenly as you can.",
      "Now spoon the rest of the batter onto the top of the spinach. There will not be enough to cover the spinach, but you don't want it to. Glop it here and there, leaving areas of spinach exposed. Sprinkle the rest of the butter over the top of the spinach and the batter. (Don't try doubling the batter to get more complete coverage -- I did it once and the end result was way too bready.)",
      "Bake at 350\u00b0 F until golden brown, about 50 minutes to an hour.. The aroma as it bakes is heavenly! Let the batsaria cool a bit before you cut it into squares or rectangles to serve. It is delicious warm, but like so many Mediterranean foods, it is also good at room temperature. Leftovers are wonderful reheated or cold."

    "directions": [
      "To make the cilantro-tamarind paste, in your food processor, combine the cilantro, garlic, 1 tablespoon of soy sauce, 1/2 of the onion, the anchovy paste, and the juice of 1 lime. Using your fingers, divide the cube of tamarind pulp (it often comes in a tube as a stiff block of pulp) into 5 to 6 smaller pieces and drop them into the food processor on top of the other ingredients.",
      "Process for about 10 seconds, scrape down, process again, scrape down, and, if necessary, process a third time for a total of 30 seconds. You want the pieces to be small and the mixture well combined, but you do not want a puree.",
      "To prepare the chicken, remove as much visible fat from the chicken as you can without tearing the skin. If you like, set some of it aside to render it for sweating the onions used in the sauce later.",
      "Very gently, pull the skin away from the flesh at the top of the neck on the back, across the breast, and down into the cavities between the wings and the body and the legs and the body. You can either use your fingers do to this, or, if necessary, use the tip of a very sharp knife to cut the inner membrane. Do this carefully to prevent tearing the skin.",
      "With your fingers, slowly and carefully put the tamarind-cilantro paste into the pockets you've created between the skin and the meat of the bird. I use a stainless dessert spoon, bowl side toward the meat, to coax the paste into places my fingers can't easily reach. Pull the skin up over the neck.",
      "Set a tube cake pan into a shallow, ovenproof dish. (Do not use a glass pie plate for this recipe.) It should sit easily on the bottom of the plate.",
      "Place the chicken over the tube section of the cake pan, as you would with a vertical roaster, with legs on the bottom, pulling them away from the body. Tuck the wing tips behind the neck. If it appears that the paste is in danger of coming out at the bottom of the chicken, use a skewer or a couple of toothpicks to pull the skin at the bottom under the bird.",
      "Pat salt all over the chicken and put it into the refrigerator for 3 to 4 hours, if you have time (highly recommended).",
      "To make the sauce, render about 1 tablespoon of chicken fat (about the size of a medium strawberry) into a heavy saucepan over medium heat. Stir it around, pressing it down with the end of your spoon, to facilitate the release of the fat. Once the pan is covered with a fair bit of fat, turn the heat down and finely chop the remaining half of the onion. Keep an eye on the pan, however, stirring occasionally and pressing down, to release more of the fat. (If you don't want to render the chicken fat, just use 1 - 2 tablespoons of neutral oil here.)",
      "Put the chopped onion into the pan with the rendered fat, or oil if you prefer. If the fat hasn't rendered completely by the time you're done chopping the onion, just put the onion in with the piece of fat and let it render as you sweat the onion. Turn the heat up to medium-high and stir the onions around. Watch carefully lest they burn.",
      "When the onions are clear and glistening, turn the heat down. Add the rice wine and stir it about, then add the remaining 1 tablespoon of soy sauce and the juice of half of the remaining lime.",
      "Stir well and cook over medium-low heat for about 5 minutes. Put the mixture aside until ready to complete the sauce, after the chicken has fully roasted.",
      "Place an oven rack on the lowest shelf of your oven, then preheat your oven to 425\u00b0 F. To roast the bird, take the chicken out of the refrigerator to let it warm up to room temperature as the oven preheats. When the oven's hot, put the chicken in on the bottom shelf.",
      "After about 10 minutes, check the bottom of the metal tube pan. Add a bit of warm water if juices from the cilantro-tamarind paste are caramelizing too quickly. The sauce will be bitter if those juices are allowed to burn. Keep an eye on it and add water if necessary. If the skin begins to get too dark, put a bit of foil very loosely over the top of the bird.",
      "After 1 hour (or more if your chicken weighs more than 4 pounds), the bird should be cooked through. Take it out to let it rest.",
      "As the chicken rests, finish the sauce. Pour the pan juices from the cake pan into the pan with the onion sauce. Scrape out any hardened bits, adding a few tablespoons of water if necessary to loosen them. Add juice from the remaining 1/2 of lime to the sauce. Add salt to taste and freshly ground pepper. Stir well. Cook over medium heat and reduce to your desired thickness.",
      "Carve the bird and serve it alongside the sauce. I hope you like this as much as we do. Yours sincerely, AntoniaJames ;o)",

With each aerator, it's best to \"temper\" the mixture by adding a small amount-about 25%-of the given aerator to the base and mix to combine. During this time, it's okay to mix slightly more vigorously. Add the remaining aerator in 2 or 3 additions and gently fold, just until the aerator is incorporated.

If your goose is more beastly say... around 10 ~ 12 lbs, double the recipe and add 3 hours more to the cooking-time. This low-and-slow overnight method not only retains juice inside the meat, but hot-air-dries the skin during the process, preparing it to be crisped up perfectly. I like to keep the head on during roasting because a) It helps keep the breast moist by creating a completely sealed off skin-suit around the meat, and b) Are you kidding, the meats on the neck is the best part! But if your goose doesn't come with neck and head (which is highly possible), just pull the skin around the \"neck hole\" together and close it with a wooden skewer or toothpick.",

If the sticky rice stuffing appears to be a little undone, it will completely cook through during the roasting anyways. But if you want to make extra sticky rice stuffings on the side, just place the extras inside a bowl and cover with cheese clothe. Steam the extra stuffing for another 20 min in a steamer. If you have a favorite stuffing in mind, feel free to try it.",
      "THE DAY BEFORE - MAKE THE STUFFING: Rinse/wash the sticky rice through a fine sieve until the water runs clear. Set aside on a kitchen towel.

Let soak for a couple of min, then remove the mushrooms (squeeze dry slightly) and reserve the soaking-water.",
      "In a heavy-bottom pot, heat 1 tbsp of oil on medium heat and cook the diced Cantonese sauce and porcini mushrooms until slightly browned, and that the sausage starts to render out its fat. Add the minced garlic and cook until fragrant. Then add the sticky rice, stir to coat the grains with oil and cook until they starts to stick slightly to the pot. Add the water, 1/3 cup of mushroom soaking-water (careful not to include the dirt/sand that may have sinked to the bottom), grated ginger, soy sauce, five spice powder and ground white pepper. Once all the ingredients are evenly mixed, cover the pot with a lid and cook on medium heat for 15 min. Then turn off the heat completely and leave it to continue to steam for another 25 min (it's ok if the sticky rice appears to be a little uncooked because it will be during the roasting).\r\n\r\nThe stuffing can be made a few days ahead and keep in the fridge.",
      "THE NIGHT BEFORE AT 11:30 PM - ROAST THE GOOSE: Preheat the oven on 230\u00b0F/110\u00b0C.\r\n\r\nRinse the clean the goose (especially the cavity) inside-out until there are no blood-clogs or internal organs left behind. With your hands, carefully separate the skin away from the meat on the chest/breast, all the way down to the inner thighs. DO NOT tear the skin, and at times a sharp paring-knife may help separating tough tissues/membrane. Mash 2 tbsp of unsalted butter and 1 1/2 tsp of salt together, and rub the mixture evenly in between the skin and the meat. This will deliver both saltiness and flavour to the meat because we are not brining. Stuff the goose-cavity with sticky rice stuffing, then with a wooden skewer or toothpick, completely close up/seal the skin (like sewing) around the cavity-opening. Do the same on the skins around the neck as well. It should be a tight, hole-less skin-suit.",
      "Then mix the soy sauce, honey and five spice powder evenly, pat the skin dry with paper towel and brush it over every inch of the skins (including the neck). This will create beautiful color for your roast. Season the entire goose with salt and some black pepper and place it, breast-side up, on baking-rack over a large baking-sheet. Roast on the mid-level in the oven for 7 hours for 7~8 lbs goose (add 1 hour to each pound more). Yes. Why so low and why so long? Because it not only gives you succulent meat but it dries the skin for perfect crispiness during the process as well (very much like air-drying peking duck before roasting, only that it's done simultaneously this way).\r\n\r\nThen Go. To. Sleep.",
      "NEXT MORNING AT 7~8 AM: After roasting, let the goose cool off completely for at least 1 hour (no more steam) then cover it loosely with foils to prevent drying.",
      "AT 6 PM, OR 40 MIN BEFORE SERVING - TO FINISH: Preheat the oven on 400\u00b0F/200\u00b0C.\r\n\r\nWash and slice the assorted wild mushrooms and scatter them evenly on a large baking-sheet. Evenly mix with 1/4 cup of rendered goose-fat (if you don't have enough, just add olive oil), salt and black pepper. Place a baking-rack over the baking-sheet and place the goose (foil removed) breast-side down first on the rack. Roast in the mid-level in the oven for 10 min, then turn the goose breast-side up and roast for another 15 min, until the skins are golden browned and crispy. Remove the goose and the baking rack, and let it rest for at least 25 min.",
      "Turn the oven to high broil, and move the mushrooms to the middle-upper level in the oven. Toast the mushrooms, scrambling them occasionally, until golden browned and crispy on the edges.\r\n\r\nServe the goose over a bed of goose-fat mushrooms and enjoy the applause."

      "Basil-Lemon Meringue: Heat the oven to 225 F.",
      "Wash the basil and dry it well, and then move the leaves to the bowl of a food processor. Zest the lemon (directly into the food processor, for ease). Add 2 tablespoons of the sugar. Set the bowl aside.",
      "Empty the eggs whites and the lemon juice into a metal mixing bowl. Set the mixing bowl over a simmering pot of water, and beat the whites using an electric mixer on medium-low speed; whisk for about 3 minutes, or until the egg whites begin to froth. Add 3 tablespoons of the sugar, and increase the speed to medium; whisk until the egg whites are a bit stiff, 4 to 5 minutes. Now add the remaining 3 tablespoons sugar, and whisk again, another 4 to 5 minutes. Turn off the heat under the water bath, and move the bowl to the countertop.",
      "Pulse the food processor for about 20 to 30 seconds, until the basil and the lemon zest have incorporated into the sugar. (Wait to do this, until just before you add this sugar to the egg whites -- you don't want the basil to brown.) Add the basil-lemon sugar to the egg white bowl, and beat on medium speed, another 2 to 3 minutes. The egg whites should be tinted lightly green, flecked with basil, and stiff enough to form peaks.",
      "Move the meringue into a piping bag -- I simply used a large, zip lock bag with a hole snipped into one corner. (You could also just use a spoon to scoop little clouds, if you're going for a more rustic look.) Pipe the meringue onto a parchment paper-lined baking sheet; my batch yielded 16 meringues, but you choose how large or small to make them.",
      "Move the baking sheet to the oven for 1 hour, and then turn off the heat. Without opening the oven door, let the meringues rest for at least 1 hour, but up to overnight.",
      "-------------------------------------",
      "Gin and Rhubarb Quick Jam: Cut the ends off the rhubarb stalks, and also cut away any bruised bits. Now slice the rhubarb into pieces, about 1/2-inch long.",
      "Move the rhubarb to a medium saucepan, along with the lemon juice, the sugar, the gin, the pinch of salt, and 1/4 cup of water. Turn the heat to high, until the liquid starts to bubble, and then lower the heat to medium low. Stir occasionally. Cook the rhubarb for about 20 minutes, or until the rhubarb is jammy, but retains its shape a bit. Let the jam cool; it should fall apart a bit when you stir it.",
      "-------------------------------------",
      "Prepare the strawberries: Slice the tops off of the strawberries, and then slice the strawberries into halves or quarters, depending on the size of the strawberries, and your personal preference. Move the strawberry pieces into a medium bowl, and stir in the brown sugar, until the strawberries are evenly coated. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and let it sit for at least 30 minutes, or until strawberry syrup collects at the bottom of the bowl.",
      "Prepare the cream: Whip the heavy cream. I like to keep the cream on the runny side, the consistency of stirred yogurt, but it's up to you. The cream should be cold when you whip it. Move it to the fridge for a little while after you whip it, so that it's also cold when you serve it.",
      "Put everything Together: There are really no rules for how, or in what order, you put together the meringue, the jam, the strawberries and the cream. You can crack the top of each meringue (for example, to fit them into a jar), or not. I recommend drizzling some of the strawberry syrup over the top of each, to finish."

Heat a thick-bottomed saucepan on medium low heat, add 2 sticks of sliced up butter - melt and cook, check often, give the saucepan a shake; the milk solids will rise to the top and start to foam up. 2.

Cook the liquid over medium high heat until it comes to a boil. Reduce heat, simmer for 5 minutes, and then remove from heat and allow it to cool completely.",
      "For the Coffee Granita:\r\nPrepare 2 cups of strong, dense espresso and pour it into a pan that can go into the freezer. As we mentioned above, we used a bread pan. Add sugar syrup gradually until your mixture reaches the sweetness you prefer.",
      "For the Cherry Granita:\r\nWash the cherries, and remove their pits and stems. Chop the cherries finely in a food processor, and place them into a pan. Mix sugar syrup into the cherries to taste. If you'd like, you can add a few teaspoons of almond extract, or a few tablespoons liquor such as Cointreau, or both.",
      "Freezing the Granita:\r\nPlace the pans of granita into the freezer uncovered. Check on your granita every half-hour or hour, depending on the depth of the pan you used. As it freezes, ice crystals will form around the edges of the pan. Each time you check on the granita, stir the mixture, breaking up the icy edges. Gradually, your granita will become thicker and slushier. When it reaches a soft, solid consistency, it is ready. This may take a few hours, again depending on the depth of your pan.\r\n\r\nAs long as you have been stirring periodically, you can allow the mixture to freeze solid. Before serving, allow it to thaw for about 30 minutes, stirring from time to time until the granita reaches the correct consistency. You may lose some of the icy, crystalline texture, but if you are entertaining this is a more reliable method from a timing standpoint.\r\n\r\nServe with whipped cream and dessert spoons."

      "Line a 9- by 13-inch baking dish with parchment paper, so the paper is only going up 2 opposite sides (essentially forming a sling to remove the caramels with later). Spray with neutral-flavored cooking spray.",
      "Combine coconut milk, butter, and salt in a 1- to 2-quart saucepan. Heat over medium-low heat while preparing the sugar mixture.",
      "Dissolve the cream of tartar in the water in a 6-quart stockpot. Add in the sugar and corn syrup, and bring to a boil over medium-high heat, swirling the pan occasionally to dissolve the sugar. Once the sugar is dissolved and the mixture is boiling, you will need to keep a pretty close eye on the pan. If you are using a candy thermometer, you will notice the mixture hovers near the boiling point for a while then starts to climb fairly rapidly. As the mixture approaches 310 degrees F, you will want to start swirling it fairly frequently as caramelization is imminent. Once the caramel color is to your liking, remove the pan from heat. The pan will retain some heat, so I like to remove the caramelized sugar mixture from the heat at about 325-330\u00b0 F, or when it is a golden brown color.",
      "Slowly pour the warm coconut mixture into the the sugar mixture. It will boil violently and create hot steam, so use caution. Stir with a wooden spoon until the sugar syrup has completely dissolved into the cream.",
      "Return the caramel mixture to medium-high heat and bring the mixture up to 244-245\u00b0 F, or lower end of firm ball stage (if you drop about a 1/2 teaspoon of the mixture into a bowl of refrigerator cold water it should form a ball, that is not soft but still malleable.) Stir often, scraping the bottom of the pan. As you get close to your target temperature, you may want to turn the heat down to low if you are using a gas stove, or completely off if you are using an electric stove to slow things down. Your caramels can go from too soft to tooth-breaking within a short timeframe. You will also want to stir almost continuously as you get close to your target temperature to prevent burning.",
      "Remove from heat and quickly stir in the vanilla and coconut extracts. Pour the caramel mixture into a prepared 9- by 13-inch pan. Immediately sprinkle the surface of the caramel with an even layer of the toasted coconut; lightly press the coconut into the surface of the caramel using a pancake turner to help get maximum adherence. Allow to cool at room temperature until barely warm to the touch. Use parchment paper to remove from the pan, then cut caramel into 1-inch squares, or whatever size pieces you prefer. I find the caramels easier to cut if they are slightly warm, and I spray my knife with a little bit of cooking spray. Wrap individually with waxed paper, and store in an airtight container.",
      "Note: Caramel making is a bit trial-and-error, based on humidity and other factors. If your caramels come out too soft, modify the final temperature up 1 to 4 degrees. If they come out too hard, modify down. This recipe scales down by half to an 8-inch square pan if you want to make a smaller amount or feel like experimenting!"

Place the squash cut side down onto a sheet tray with foil. Roast for about 45 minutes, or until the squash is fork tender.",

Add the cold cubes of butter, working with your fingertips until the butter is pea-sized and the mixture resembles a coarse and sandy meal. Put the bowl in the fridge and let the flour/butter mixture chill for 15 minutes.",

Put it back in the oven at 350 and bake until the bottom of your pie crust is just starting to crisp, but is still slightly undercooked.",

      "Get out two saucepans. In one, start your custard by combining cream, milk, cinnamon and star anise pods over medium-low heat. You really do not want this any higher because you just want your mixture to steam (this took about 12 minutes on my stove). In your second saucepan, add the Malbec, raspberries, and heat over medium. Once this gets bubbling, monitor heat to keep it at a consistent, but slow simmer, stirring occasionally and breaking up the berries. Continue cooking this mixture in this manner until you are ready to add it to the custard (step 4).",
      "Meanwhile, whisk your egg yolks in a medium bowl until combined. Add sugar and whisk vigorously until mixture is thick and pale. You can use a hand mixer, but it comes together quickly and easily with a whisk. Set bowl aside.",
      "Once your cream mixture is steaming, remove pan from heat. Stir and let mixture cool for a minute. Slowly temper your eggs by adding a small amount of the heated cream (a ladle is good for this) into the eggs and whisking quickly to combine. Pour tempered egg mixture into remaining cream, quickly whisking to combine. At this point, I could have really used a third arm, to scrape the remaining egg-sugar mixture from the bowl effortlessly. Having someone hold the bowl while you are trying to whisk the custard (to prevent scrambling the eggs) and scrape the bowl simultaneously is helpful. Return custard to heat and cook, stirring, until the custard coats the back of a spoon and will hold a line drawn with your finger, about 5 minutes.",
      "Carefully add wine-raspberry mixture to your custard. Stir to combine and then strain mixture through a fine meshed sieve into a large glass container (I used my quart Pyrex), pressing down on solids with a spatula. You should have about a quart of custard. Cool slightly and cover with plastic wrap. Transfer to the refrigerator for 6-8 hours, preferably overnight.",
      "When you are ready to make your wine scream, get your swirls ready. For the raspberry swirl, combine washed and drained raspberries (it is okay if they have a little water clinging to them), sugar and creme de cassis (or framboise or lemon juice) in a small saucepan. Get your mixture bubbling, breaking up fruit with a spatula. After 10-12 minutes, your mixture should still be loose, but also a little jammy. Strain through a small sieve into a small container with a lid, pressing down on seeds and scraping back and forth to get out all your jammy pulp. Scrape the pulp off the bottom of sieve into your container. Stir to combine. You should have about 2 ounces of raspberry swirl. Transfer to refrigerator to cool.",
      "Prepare chocolate swirl by placing in a glass bowl or Pyrex. If using a bar, cut into small pieces. Microwave for 10 seconds at a time until chocolate is glossy and just melted. Check between each time, stirring as it melts, to make sure your chocolate does not seize. Add canola oil, stir well to combine and set aside to cool completely.",
      "Pour your custard into your machine and process according to manufacturer's directions. When your ice cream is about the consistency of soft serve (20-25 minutes depending on your machine), carefully pour cooled, melted chocolate into machine. Allow mixture to churn for a bit more before shutting off.",
      "In a 1.5 quart airtight container, or two smaller containers, fill bottom third with ice cream. Spread an even layer of raspberry swirl. Repeat layering with remaining ice cream and raspberry swirl for two more layers of both. Freeze for at least 3 hours before enjoying. Enjoy!"

Scoop out the flesh into a bowl (set flesh and seeds aside) and brush the pumpkin pieces with olive oil. Sprinkle each piece with salt (about 1/2 tsp) and freshly ground black pepper (about 1/4 tsp).

I find it easiest to place everything into a colander, run it under water, while manually removing the fleshy parts and plucking as many seeds as possible out. It is a tedious task, but the fresh roasted seeds are a must on the flatbread! Pat the seeds dry with a paper towel, removing as much water as possible, then mix in 1 tbs olive oil, 1 tbs melted butter, 1/4 tsp salt, some fresh pepper and a pinch of cayenne pepper. Spread the seeds in one layer on a baking sheet and roast on a lower layer in the oven along with the pumpkin, until seeds are golden. This takes about 40 to 50 minutes. Remove seeds and set aside (and go ahead... munch on this incredibly delicious and healthy snack!).",

Whisk the liquids and then add the dry ingredients. Switch to a spoon and mix everything together until a dough starts to form. Turn out onto a clean surface and knead for 6 or 7 minutes with your hands until dough becomes elastic. Coat with some olive oil, place in a bowl and let the dough rise for 1 and a half or 2 hours, while the pumpkin cooks.",
      "Place a skillet over a medium flame and add 2 tbs olive oil. Thinly slice the red onion and add to the pan, along with the grated garlic, 4 large chopped sage leaves, the 1/2 tsp sugar and a little salt and pepper. Cook for about 10 minutes, until onion is soft and slightly caramelized. Set aside.",
      "In a medium bowl, mix 1 tbs olive oil, the 1.5 tbs of honey, 1/4 tsp cinnamon, 1/8 tsp nutmeg and a pinch of cayenne pepper. Whisk all ingredients to combine. When pumpkin is tender enough, remove from oven, let it rest until cool enough to handle and scoop out the flesh into the bowl with oil, honey and spice. Mash very well with a spoon, or use an immersion blender to get a thick puree and mix in the seasonings. It should still be somewhat chunky. Taste the puree and add more salt and pepper if necessary.",
      "Raise the oven heat to 500 degrees and place an a baking sheet into the oven to warm it.",
      "Cut the dough in half, place one piece back into bowl and cover. Place the other piece on a large sheet of parchment paper big enough to hold the flatbread. Use a rolling in to roll it out into a thin layer. It can be round, square, or any shape you like...because it's a flatbread! You can even pick it up and use your hands to gently stretch it. But it should be about 14 inches wide and long.",
      "With gloves, carefully remove the hot baking sheet (be careful...it's hot!), turn it upside down and lift the parchment paper with the flatbread unto it. Place back into the oven and cook for 5 minutes. Remove the baking sheet and with the help of a spatula, slide the flatbread off of the paper. Return to oven, rotating it, and cook another 4 to 5 minutes.

Dip a spoon into the glaze - if the glaze clings fully to the spoon, but still drips off thickly, the glaze is perfect (if the glaze doesn't drip off the spoon, it's too thick - add more milk; if the glaze is very runny, whisk in more powdered sugar). Whisk in the orange zest and orange water, if using. When the doughnuts are cool, drop 1-2 drops of each color of food coloring onto the surface of the icing.

(Using a fork instead of a whisk or electric beaters will minimize the amount of air incorporated into the batter, giving you denser and fudgier brownies. The dissolved sugar that binds with the egg forms a skin as it dries during the beginning stages of baking - similar to the smooth shell of macarons.)",
      "In a small saucepot, melt the butter over medium low heat, swirling occasionally. As soon as the butter is melted, add all of the chocolate and turn off the heat. Let the mixture sit for 30 seconds, then stir gently for about 2 minutes until the chocolate is completely melted and the mixture is smooth. (Butter melts at 35\u00b0C, and chocolate melts at 30\u00b0C. Since the eggs only coagulate at around 60\u00b0C, you should have no problem combining the two directly.)",
      "Pour all of the chocolate mixture into the egg mixture and mix with a fork until smooth and shiny. Add all of the buckwheat flour and fold it in gently with a fork, making sure you get rid of any lumps. (The finished batter should be smooth, shiny, and considerably runny for a brownie. Don't worry, it only seems very runny because it has tons of melted fat and un-coagulated protein.)",
      "Line an 8-by-8 inch square baking pan with parchment extending up the sides and pour in the batter. Tap it firmly against your counter for 5-7 times to get rid of any air bubbles. (Air bubbles will rise to the surface during baking and break the craggly skin you want.)",
      "Allow the mixture to rest for 20-30 minutes as you preheat the oven to 325\u00b0F, placing the rack slightly above the middle of the oven. (Most recipes will give 350\u00b0F as the temperature setting, but the same ingredient transformations such as proteins denaturing, sugars rearranging, and starches gelatinizing can all happen at a lower temperature. In addition, the low temperature ensures that the cooking is more even since heat travels through mediums at a constant speed regardless of the difference between the surrounding temperature and the medium's temperature, and a slower and lesser rise which will not disturb the delicate wafer-thin skin that forms at the top nor turn the brownie cake-y.)",
      "Bake for 28-30 minutes, or until the middle is puffed up, shiny, but still jiggles when you shake it gently. (The middle only puffs up because the moisture there is heated through, becoming steam which rises, but it is still wobbly which means that the starches haven't completely expanded and set up. In other words, it's cooked but not over-baked.)",
      "Place directly on the counter and cool to room temperature. If you would like, now is the time to sprinkle on some fleur de sel - while it's hot and still giving off steam so it sticks. (You want to cool the brownie down as quickly as possible so that the center stops cooking immediately, contracts back down, and turns the smooth shiny skin into the craggle-top. Air is a poor conductor of heat, so cooling it on a rack is about as ineffective as you can do. If you have a marble countertop that is the best way to go.)",
      "Chill completely in the refrigerator, uncovered, for about 2 hours. Once chilled, lift the brownie slab from the pan by holding the extended sides of parchment. Cut into 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, or 16 slices - whatever you fancy. I like to cut them into 6 pieces, makes the perfect breakfast size for me. (Chilling the brownies before slicing solidifies the butter and chocolate fats, giving you cleaner edges.)"

Flip the quail and add the Aleppo pepper, thyme, honey and wine. Now turn the heat down a bit and let this all reduce to a nice glaze. Flip the quail back and forth a few times so that they get glazed all over, and taste for salt. They will look like an odd shiny little dance troupe in the pan, which makes it more fun to cook them.

Using a sharp small knife, cut a slice in the challah's crusty top, and around the sides, without piercing the other side or cutting through the bottom crust at all. Gently open the bread, butterfly style, making sure it does not break. Take 11/2 to 2 teaspoons of dark chocolate mixture and spread generously across one side of the bread, coating it almost to the edge. (Make sure it does not go right to the edge, or over, because it will burn). Fold the two sides back together, so it looks like a sandwich with one connected edge. Place each slice of challah in the egg mixture, one at a time, allowing each side to soak for 2 to 3 minutes until the bread is soft and liquid soaks through to the center. (Use a spatula to pick up the bread, not a fork, so it stays together well).",
      "Heat the oil in a large skillet over high heat until shimmering. Add the soaked challah to the pan, no more than two slices at a time. Cook until light brown on both sides, flipping once. Transfer to a tray and cover with foil to keep warm. (Or keep warm in a 300\u00b0F oven for up to 10 minutes). Repeat with remaining slices.",
      "Heat the sauce on high and add the bananas slices, flat side down. Cook until fully heated through, then flip and cook until hot. Dust with the chocolate shavings, if using. Serve immediately on top of the warm French toast."

They stay in the freezer for at least one hour. Once the bowl and wands are cold enough take them out. Pour the whipping cream in the ice-cold bowl put the wands into the electric mixer. You can start whipping the cream. While you are whipping the cream, add the 8 tablespoons of sugar to sweeten your Chantilly. Once you have stiff peaks on the Chantilly you can stop mixing.

      "Mix the dough on low speed to combine the ingredients, stopping the mixer if the dough climbs up the hook or if you need to work in dry ingredients that have settled on the bottom of the bowl. Scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl as needed. It should take about 2 minutes for the dough to come together. If there are lots of dry bits in the bottom of the bowl that just aren't getting worked in, add a tablespoon or two of water. On the other hand, if the dough feels very soft, add a few pinches of flour.",
      "Note: Eventually you'll be able to feel the dough and know if you need to add water or flour; it's always better to adjust the ratios when the dough is first coming together at the beginning of mixing rather than wait until the end of the kneading process, since it takes longer for ingredient additions to get worked into the dough mass at this later point and you risk overworking the dough.",
      "Increase the speed to medium and knead until a smooth dough forms, about 4 minutes. You want the dough to be a bit firm.",
      "Stretch and fold the dough: Lightly dust your work surface with a little flour, and use a dough scraper to transfer the dough from the mixing bowl to the floured surface. Use your palms to push and tear the top of the dough away from you in one stroke, and then fold that section onto the middle of the dough. Give the dough a quarter turn and repeat the push/tear/fold process for about 1 minute. Then push and pull the dough against the work surface to round it into a ball.",
      "Let the dough rise: Lightly dust a bowl with flour, add the dough, sprinkle just a little flour on top of the dough, and cover the bowl with plastic wrap. Set the bowl aside at room temperature.",
      "Once the dough has risen by 70% (after about 40 minutes, depending on how warm your room is), divide the dough in half and gently press each piece into a square. Wrap them individually in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 hour.",
      "While the dough chills, make the filling: Place the butter, brown sugar, granulated sugar, and cinnamon in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, and cream the mixture on low speed until it is combined. Scrape down the bottom and sides of the bowl as needed and continue to beat until well combined without creating any volume, about 30 seconds.",
      "Fill the dough: Remove 1 square of dough from the refrigerator and place it on a lightly floured work surface. Press or roll the dough into a 12-inch square, and then spread 1/2 cup of the cinnamon-sugar filling over the left half of the dough. Fold the right side of the dough over the left so the edges meet, and then use a rolling pin to roll and lightly flatten the dough. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate while you repeat with the second piece of dough. Refrigerate the second piece.",
      "Place the first piece of dough on the lightly floured work surface so the seam is at the top. Roll the dough to a 12-inch square. Use your hand to make 2 vertical indentations in the dough, dividing it into thirds. Spread 1/2 cup of the cinnamon-sugar filling over the left-hand third of the dough. Then create a simple fold by folding the left-hand side over the middle, then the right-hand side over the middle, so the dough is folded like a business letter. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 hour. Repeat with the second piece.",
      "Unwrap the first piece of dough and set it on a floured surface, seam at the top. Lightly flour the top of the dough and then roll it into a 12-inch square that is about 1/4 inch thick. Spread half the remaining cinnamon-sugar filling over the dough (leave a 1/2-inch border at the top) and then, starting at the bottom, roll the dough into a cylinder, pressing down on the seam to seal it. Repeat with the second piece of dough.",
      "Shape the dough: Place the cylinders onto a parchment paper-lined rimmed sheet pan. Starting at the top of one of the cylinders, use kitchen scissors to slice the dough on an angle and in 1-inch alternating intervals about three-quarters of the way through (so make your first snip on the left side on an angle, then the next snip on the right side on an angle, and leave the very bottom attached). Starting at the top, flip one piece over. Skip the next piece, then flip the next one over and continue. Cover the sheet pan with plastic wrap and set aside in a warm, draft-free spot to rise until they have doubled in volume, 30 to 40 minutes.",

      "Meanwhile, make the simple syrup: Combine the sugar and water in a small saucepan and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally to dissolve the sugar. Turn off the heat and set aside to cool. Remove the challah from the oven and immediately brush with the simple syrup. Cool completely on the sheet pan or serve warm."

      "If using leftover sweet potatoes, including whatever you have stirred into them (except of course marshmallows) because it will only make the bread more interesting, warm them up a bit before adding to the dough. If using freshly cooked and mashed, let them cool to where they are comfortable to the touch.",

      "Turn mixer off and drape a piece of plastic around the top of the bowl. Let the dough rest (autolyse) for 20 minutes. This allows the large particles of whole wheat flour to fully inflate themselves with water. Without that time, your dough will tend to look dry and broken. You'll be tempted to add water, and just at the point where it's all absorbed, suddenly it turns into too much, and the dough goes all limp and sticks to the bowl. So then you'll decide to add more flour, and by that time, you will have firmly lodged yourself right behind the 8 ball. So go for the rest period and leave the 8 ball where it belongs.",
      "After the rest period, remove the sheet of plastic and turn mixer on to lowest speed. I never get tired of seeing the miracle of a dough gather its skirts under itself, and come together in a beautiful waltz around the dough hook. That, my friends, is all because of the rest period. Continue kneading for a couple of minutes. Stop mixer. Pull off a walnut-size piece of dough. Round it up quickly between your palms. Then gently tease it out over your fingertips. You are trying to achieve a *windowpane*. In other words, you want to see how thin you can get the dough without it tearing. This tells you if you have adequately developed the gluten - something that won't happen well in whole grain breads without the rest period. If your dough tears, return your piece to the bowl and knead for a couple of minutes more. Repeat windowpane. You should be there by now.",
      "Turn dough out of bowl. Oil bowl and return dough, turning it over from top to bottom. Cover with your piece of plastic and allow to proof until you can gently press the surface with a finger, and the indentation remains.",
      "Gently turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and divide in half. Either shape and drop into 2 conventional loaf pans, or shape into hearth loaves that you'll set onto baking sheets lined with parchment. Dust the surface of each loaf with flour and gently drape with plastic. Again allow to proof until the surface holds the indentation of your finger.",
      "Meanwhile, preheat oven to 375 degrees. Just before placing loaves in oven, slash each 3 or 4 times a good 1/4\" deep with a serrated knife held at an acute angle. Bake them for 40 minutes, rotating and the 20-minute point. Bread is done when you get a temperature reading of 185 degrees at the dead center.",

Some people say include the ginger peel and don't wash it so that you get natural yeasts. I chickened out and peeled mine first. Cover with fabric, cheesecloth or a paper towel and rubber band it.\r\nThe first time I used the jar's accompanying lid and left it on but not screwed tight. This worked for fermentation but I read that this can cause a vinegar-y taste.",
      "Store jar in a darkish warm place. The ideal temperature is close to body temp but not much warmer than that. I put my jar in a cardboard box with a cheap drugstore heating pad in it and a towel over the whole box. I turn the pad on and off occasionally and definitely off at night. It is really hot so we have the AC blasting through our house, so the ambient air temp is pretty cool which would mean slow fermentation. In the winter I might be able to keep a ginger bug near a radiator. It is OK if the temps swing a little but too hot will kill it and too cold will slow or stop the fermentation, for now I am saying between 82 deg. F. and 100 deg. F.",

      "* You can measure your water by filling the intended container, pouring out for headroom, and then pouring out another half-cup. See step 9 below and sources in above headnote for bottling options.\r\nBring the water to a boil in a large pot.",
      "Peel the lemon with a vegetable peeler and remove any white pith by scraping with a small sharp knife. Add peels and sugar. If you have other flavor ideas add them now. Lower heat and simmer for 10 - 15 minutes. Turn off heat.",
      "Juice lemon and add to liquid. Allow to cool to 100 degrees F or to room temp; strain into a large glass container and add the ginger bug.",
      "Cover with a towel. Linzarella advises stretching two long pieces masking tape over the container in a cross configuration to keep the towel from slipping if necessary. Store this in a warm place, same temperatures listed under ginger bug directions for two - four days.\r\nOr you can skip this step and go straight to bottling. One source tells me it will be fizzier if you bottle it right away.",
      "For my first time I chose to use one re-used plastic container. I used a clean, dry two quart plastic bottle (from Trader Joe's lemonade I think) and the accompanying lid. [The lid had no waxed paper disc, if it did I would remove it.] Fill bottle and leave 1\" minimum headroom. You can staring before bottling or not.",
      "Leave bottle in the same warm location for 24-48 hours or until the bottle feels very firm. Refrigerate at once and keep chilled for several hours. Open very carefully.",
      "I will update this recipe as I try other flavors and bottling methods. This recipe is fairly dry but it does not have the strong bite of some Jamaican ginger beers I've had. More ginger could be added to either the bug or the tisane if a hotter ginger flavor is preferred. \r\nIf my math is correct this recipe has between 1/4 and 1/3 the amount of sugar in commercial ginger ale. Some recipes call for twice the amount of sugar; those probably have the sweeter taste of commercial ginger ales. I love the idea of using honey, maple syrup, or other less refined sugars and I will update if I get good results.\r\nLast, about flavorings, I have found some people like to add cayenne, vanilla, lime, or other flavors. Again, I will post any good flavor combinations I find."

      "Light the barbecue. While the fire burns down or it heats up, make your aioli and set aside to let the flavors blend. Place garlic and salt in bowl of a food processor. Pulse to blend. With the machine running, add yolks 1 at a time, letting each blend for a few seconds before adding the next. Next, add the canola oil a tablespoon at a time - one you'd use to eat soup is fine. Afterwards, add olive oil in a slow, steady stream. Finally, add the lemon zest and juice. Aioli should be gentle and soft, perfect for dipping. If it appears to custardy, add some more olive oil in the same manner as above. Turn out into 2 small, pretty bowls. Think of them as skirts for the sisters. Color up one with a couple of tablespoons of pesto (I freeze mine in ice cube trays - 1 or 2 cubes would be fine) and perfume the other with the anchovy fillets. Stir each, taste, and adjust seasonings as you like - I like to punch up the lemon in the anchovy aioli. Set aside and let sit at room temp while you clean and grill the vegetables.",

      "Now to the grill. Take along the platter on which you plan to arranged your vegetables so you can transfer them right to it as they come off the grill. Spread out your coals, set the rack on, set your grilling pan on top and let it get hot. Grill each vegetable with its mates, moving them around so that they grill up fairly evenly. This goes pretty fast because, really, all you're trying to do is get a good char on them without cooking away their crispness. Arrange each on your platter as they finish; they are all intrinsically beautiful, so don't fret the perfect distribution. Add your bowls of aioli, grab a large stack of napkins. Don't even think of using forks. Pour a crisp white wine. Toast your party, even if it is you and your perfect other."

Add the ramps, walnuts, basil and lemon (juice and zest) to the food processor and pulse them a few times before adding the cheese, salt, pepper and oil. I like to add the olive oil slowly until it looks, well... pesto-y.",

When the skillet is hot enough that a drop of water skitters on the surface (probably after about 3 minutes), add a tablespoon of olive oil. Tilt the pan to coat the bottom evenly and heat until the oil is almost smoking (about 30 seconds). Season the salmon with the salt and pepper and add to the skillet, skinned side down. Cook until you see that the fish is about 1/3 cooked from the bottom, about 4 minutes. Turn the salmon, lower the heat to medium and sear until you see that it cooked about 1/3 of the way again.

      "Halloween Monster Cake Pop\r\n\r\nOctober 29, 2014 by Fanny | 0 comments\r\nIMG_1650_web\r\nKids love cake pops. Like crazy! My son doesn't like to eat cakes in general. You convert them into a form of cake pops, he will easily finish a dozen in a heart beat. I've made cake pops for his school events all the time. His friends are always amazed, and that makes him happy. And I would say there is nothing to make myself prouder than this.\r\nLast year I did these cake pops for Halloween. And I realized I'm not a big fan of edible decorating pen. The major reason is that the \"ink\" seems to be fading very soon after you use it for a while. I would suspect that maybe the candy on the cake pop starts to coat the tip of the pen, and it kind of blocks the \"ink\" from coming out. Also the tip is not thin/sharp enough to create finer graphics on the cake pop. I've started to go with piping melted candy with a very tiny round tip.\r\nThese monster cake pops are relatively easy to make. Pick one or two bright colors. Put on the dramatic eyeballs. Add a little hair. You are done. I know it might be easy said than done. But if you've been making cake pops like myself, you know what I mean when I said EASY!\r\nIMG_1654_web\r\nIngredients (about 45 pops): \r\nChocolate Cake\r\n1 cup granulated sugar\r\n3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour\r\n1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder, sifted\r\n3/4 teaspoon baking powder\r\n3/4 teaspoon baking soda\r\n1/2 teaspoon salt\r\n1 large egg, room temperature\r\n1/2 cup sour cream, room temperature\r\n1/4 cup canola oil\r\n1 tablespoon vanilla extract\r\n1/2 cup boiling water\r\nChocolate Buttercream\r\n2 sticks unsalted butter, room temperature\r\n2 cups powdered sugar, sifted\r\n1 teaspoon vanilla extract\r\n2 tablespoons heavy cream\r\n1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder, sifted\r\nOthers\r\n1 bag candy melts of your preferred color (for body)\r\nhalf bag candy melts of your preferred color (for hair)\r\ncandy eyeballs\r\n \r\nDirections:\r\nTo prepare the cake, preheat oven to 350F. Grease and line an 8-inch square cake pan.\r\nIn a large bowl, mix together sugar, flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda and salt.\r\nCrack in the egg, spoon in the sour cream, and pour in the oil and the vanilla. Mix with a wooden spoon until just combined.\r\nPour in the boiling water, and slowly mix until smooth and liquidy.\r\nPour batter in the prepared pan, and bake for 20 to 25 minutes. Transfer pan to a wire rack and let cake cool in pan for 15 minutes. Then invert it onto a greased rack. Let cool completely.\r\nTo prepare buttercream, beat butter for a few minutes in a standing mixer with the paddle attachment on medium speed. Add powdered sugar and turn the mixer on low, beat until the sugar incorporates with the butter. Add vanilla, heavy cream and cocoa powder, beat on medium speed for another 3 minutes, or until buttercream becomes light and fluffy.\r\nTo assemble cake pops, prepare two cookie sheets lined with parchment paper.\r\nBreak the cooled cake into a few big trunks by hand, place them into the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and mix on medium speed until the big pieces turn into crumbs.\r\nAdd frosting gradually into the cake crumbs and blend until the mixture becomes a dough, about 1 to 1 1/2 cups of frosting.\r\nUse a small cookie scoop, roll dough into evenly sized balls and place them on the prepared cookie sheets. Refrigerate for 30 minutes.\r\nMelt small amount of candy melts (body color) in the microwave gradually, 10 second intervals and stirring in-between. Dip one end of a lollipop stick in the melted candy and insert into the cake ball. Repeat until you are done. Refrigerate again for 15 minutes.\r\nRemove the cake pops from the refrigerator. Melt all the candy melts (body color) in the microwave. Dip each cake pop in the candy melt and gently tap off excess. Carefully place one or two candy eyeballs on the cake pop. Place cake pop onto a piece of wax paper. Let it dry completely. Repeat with the remaining cake pops.\r\nPlace the other batch of candy melts (hair color) in a microwavable Ziploc bag. Microwave on high for 20 to 30 seconds to completely melt the candy melts. Push the melted candy toward one corner of the bag. With a pair of scissors, snip off a very small opening, and start piping the candy on the top part as hair."

      "Fill a big pot with water (at least 6 quarts), cover, and set on the stove over high heat.",
      "While that comes to a boil, pan-fry the shallots: Find the largest skillet you have (mine is 12 inches in diameter) and add enough vegetable oil to create a thin (figure about 1/4-inch) layer coating the bottom. Add the shallots in an even layer, then set on the stove over high heat. (Yep, this means you're starting the shallots in room-temp oil. It's on purpose!) When the shallots start hissing and bubbling, lower the heat to medium. Cook until deeply golden brown-lowering the heat and stirring as needed to ensure even cooking-about 15 minutes. Remove to a paper towel-lined surface to cool. Season with a pinch of salt.",
      "Discard the oil and wipe out the skillet to remove any excess. Add the butter and set on the stove over medium-high heat. When the butter has melted, add the mushrooms. Season with a big pinch of salt. Use tongs or a wooden spoon to toss the mushrooms, making sure they're evenly coated. Cook, stirring once or twice, for about 10 minutes-until all the mushroom-y liquid is gone and they're beginning to brown and stick to the bottom of the pan.",
      "Pour the cream into the pan with the mushrooms. Add 1 teaspoon salt plus the black pepper, and stir to combine. Bring to a boil. Continue to boil, stirring frequently to prevent burning, for about 13 minutes, slowly reducing the heat toward the end. (Psst: For most of this time, the boil should be rolling and exciting, not timid. This intense heat not only reduces the cream, but also infuses all that great mushroom flavor and color.) By the end, the sauce should be chestnut-y in hue, intensely flavored, and so thick that if you drag a wooden spatula or spoon across the bottom of the pan, it leaves a distinct trail for a couple seconds, like with a thick gravy.",
      "While the cream is reducing, cook the green beans: Add 6 tablespoons salt to the boiling water. (This is estimating 1 tablespoon Morton's kosher salt per 1 quart water. If you're using Diamond Crystal, use 2 tablespoons. And, of course, this can be adjusted to personal taste. This is the ratio I like best.) Now add the green beans. Cook for 3 1/2 minutes until bright green and just tender. Drain immediately and spread out on a towel to dry as much as possible. You don't want them at all wet when they go into the cream sauce.",
      "When the mushroom sauce is as thick as you want it, cut the heat and season with salt to taste. Add the green beans and toss to coat completely. Top with the crispy shallots and serve."

If you own a large food processor add the extra virgin olive oil slowly while it is running. I only own a small cuisinart where removing the top to add an ingredient is required, if that is the case, add the oil in 3 batches at a time. Similar to a salad dressing recipe, adding the oil slowly ensures that it is well incorporated. Now, add the parmesan cheese and pulse a few times. Before you add salt, give it a taste to see if you need it. To make this a vegan pesto, substitute the cheese for nutritional yeast, also known as the vegan's cheese!",

      "Next, you will slice the mango in similar size pieces. I really should have taken pictures of this, but this is the easiest way to do it in my opinion: hold the mango on a cutting board with the stem part up. The seed is oval shaped, and runs down the middle of the wide part of the mango. You want to cut the sides of the mango off the seed, cutting as close to the seed as you can to get the most fruit off. Once you have cut these two main parts off, slice as much fruit off the seed as possible, and throw that in the bowl. Discard the seed. Place the mango pieces skin side down on a cutting board. Slice the fruit from top to bottom in 1/4 inch slices, being very careful to cut all the way through the pulp but not to cut the skin. Then make one similar cut (not cutting the skin) going perpendicular to the other cuts, to make the correct size slices. Now cut the pulp away from the skin around the edges of the mango slice. Next, turn the skin inside out, and using a sharp knife, cut the fruit away from the skin. It should be perfectly cut. Repeat with the rest of the mangoes, and throw all the pulp in the salad bowl and toss.",

Place the sugar in a bowl, add the cornstarch and baking powder (adding both ensures a completely dry and crisp meringue), and gradually-a tablespoon at a time-add the sugar to the egg whites.

Raise the piping bag as you pipe, so that they are about 2 inches/5 cm high and you create a fine tip at the top. Once all the meringues have been piped, place both baking sheets in the oven at once. Immediately lower the oven temperature to 250\u00b0F/120\u00b0C-you want it to be slightly hotter when they go in, to give the meringues a crunch-and bake for 2 1/2 hours.

I used four rows in my recipe. As such, create a weave by using four bacon slices, which when split in half create a total of 8 bacon strips.",
      "Begin by laying out 4 bacon strips, side by side and as close together as possible, on the prepped baking tray. Flip two alternate strips (ones that aren't touching each other) one third of the way over on themselves. Lay the 5th strip perpendicularly (vertically) to the horizontal rows of bacon, directly over the side with the flipped-over bacon strip. Straighten out the flipped over bacon strip. Doing so will partially cover the 5th strip that you just added.",

Straighten out the folded-over bacon strips to cover the 5th strip that has just been added to the baking sheet. Repeat this pattern two more times.",

Remove from the oven and allow to cool slightly before removing the bacon from the pan.",

      "Using a #16 ice cream scoop, or similar instrument, scoop out equal-sized balls of dough, and space evenly on the prepared baking sheet. Flatten each dough ball lightly with the palm of your hand.",
      "Bake the cookies for 14 to 16 minutes, or until the cookies have noticeably darkened in color and their edges are a darker shade of brown. These cookies will not spread much, and will still be quite soft while hot. Remove the pan from the oven, and let it stand for 10 minutes.",
      "Transfer cookies to a wire rack to cool and crisp up before you begin the process of turning them into cookie butter.",
      "Place the speculoos into a food processor and grind on high power until cookies are finely crushed. Measure out enough ground cookies to equal 1 1/4 cups of ground cookies, loosely packed. Save the leftover crumbs for other uses like sprinkling over ice cream or topping over your soon-to-be-made cookie butter.",
      "Add the confectioners' sugar, granulated sugar, nonfat dry milk powder, and spices. Process just to combine, then add the oil and process some more. At first, it will look like nothing's happening, just a silly tumble of spicy cookie crumbs going round and round. Be patient and remember that good things take time.",
      "After 3 to 4 minutes, stop the food processor. Depending on how powerful your machine is, the mixture will have turned from crumbs to paste. Scrape the bowl down with a fork or rubber spatula, if necessary, and then taste the mixture. Add more sugar or spices as necessary. Put the lid back on and process for another 1 to 2 minutes.",
      "At 5 to 6 minutes (again, time will vary depending on your machine's motor power), the paste will have started clumping to the sides of the bowl. Ah, the sweet sight of imminent success! At this point, if the mixture is not as fluid or as incorporated as you'd like it to be, add in another 1/2 tablespoon of oil.",
      "Continue to process the mixture. If you added more oil, the mixture will begin to resemble a runny paste similar to old-fashioned peanut butter where the oil floats on top. You can add more oil a 1/2 tablespoon at a time after every minute of processing, depending on how runny you want your cookie butter to be -- I've tried this recipe using up to 1/2 cup of oil.",
      "After 8 to 10 minutes of processing, you know the end is near when the paste clings to the sides of the bowl. By now, depending upon how much oil you've put in, the consistency will range from that of commercial cookie butter to a very runny cookie butter. Both are desirable ... and delicious!",
      "Transfer cookie butter to a sterilized glass jar with a screw-top, rust-proof lid. Cookie butter will firm up as it cools and some oils may surface. Stir before enjoying, and store at room temperature away from direct heat for up to 5 days."

Pour the wet ingredients into the dry and use your hands or a spoon to gradually incorporate the dry ingredients into the wet. When they are thoroughly combined, cover and set aside for 20 to 30 minutes to hydrate the flour.",
      "Lightly flour about about a square foot of counter space. Transfer dough to the floured area, then knead it for several minutes, flouring your hands or the counter as needed. It will be fairly sticky at first, but should become a smooth dough after several minutes of kneading. Divide the dough in half, and form each half into a smooth ball. Place the dough on a floured quarter sheet pan (or similar), then lightly dust with flour. Cover the pan with plastic wrap.",
      "Allow dough to rest at room temperature for 3-4 hours, until it has approximately doubled in size, then refrigerate for at least 30 minutes (or up to 36 hours). Alternately it can be refrigerated immediately and used between 24 and 48 hours later. It will develop more flavor if it's made a day or two ahead, but if you decide late Saturday morning that you want pizza Saturday evening you can definitely make it happen.",
      "Place a pizza stone or steel on a middle rack in your oven, so the broiler is about 8-inches from the top of the stone/steel. Heat your oven to 500\u00b0 F (or 550\u00b0 if your oven goes that high). Allow the oven to heat at least 45 minutes before baking the first pizza.",

      "Meanwhile, crush the garlic clove, then skin and chop it. Combine the garlic and olive oil in a small skillet and place over medium low heat. Once it gets fragrant and bubbles are forming around the garlic bits, lower the heat to as low as your stove goes. Continue to heat for 8 to 10 minutes, then remove from heat and let cool for several minutes. Strain the oil through a mesh strainer into a small bowl. Save the garlic!",
      "Thinly slice the eggplant crosswise while the oil and garlic are heating. You are shooting for slices between 1/16th and 1/8th inch. Use a sharp knife or a mandolin. Using the kosher salt, lightly sprinkle one side of each slice, then arrange the slices in a colander, fanning them around so they are overlapping but none are stacked directly atop another. Allow to drain for 10 to 15 minutes, then wipe the moisture and excess salt away with a clean, lint-free kitchen towel, or paper towels.",
      "While the eggplant is draining slice the cheese balls into halves and grate the parmesan. Make the sauce by adding 1 tablespoon of the garlic oil, the reserved garlic, fine sea salt, oregano, and pepper flakes to the blender with the tomatoes. Blend until smooth.",
      "Heat the remaining garlic oil in the small skillet over medium heat for several minutes. Add the bread crumbs, stir well to combine, and saute until golden brown, stirring occasionally. Remove pan from heat. As long as the bread crumbs are only golden brown, they shouldn't burn from the residual heat. If they got a little browner just transfer them to a plate to be safe.",

Lightly flatten it with your fingertips starting at the center and working your way to the edges. Flip it over and repeat. Pick up the dough by the edge and rotate it vertically to allow gravity to help stretch it. Once you feel like you're on the edge of losing control of the stretch, place the dough over both of your fists in a horizontal orientation, and rotate it until it has formed a 12-inch circle. Transfer the dough to the pizza peel.",
      "Spread about 1/4 cup sauce over the dough in a thin layer avoiding the outer 1/2-3/4 inch of dough. Sprinkle with about 1/4 of the grated parmesan and 1/4 of the basil. Place an eggplant slice in the center, then use about half of the eggplant slices to cover most of the sauces, shingling them in slightly overlapping circles. Drizzle-dollop 3 to 4 more tablespoons of sauce onto the eggplant, then evenly arrange half of the mozzarella and sprinkle 1/4 of the grated parmesan on.",
      "Jiggle the pizza on the peel to make sure it is sliding easily. If it is stuck anyplace, gently raise the dough and sprinkle a pinch of flour under the sticky area(s) until the pizza is nicely mobile.",
      "Transfer the pizza with a quick forward shake so the edge of the pizza is toward the back of the stone/steel. Once it hits the stone/steel, you will be able to slide the peel out from under it. If you are using a stone change the oven setting back to bake, and allow the pizza to cook for 4 to 5 minutes before change the setting back to broil for another 1-2 minutes. (The crust rim should be poofy and the mozzarella balls about half melted before you switch to broil.) The pizza is done when sauce is vigorously bubbling, the cheese is melted, and there are some deep brown spots on the rim of the crust. If you are using a steel, only allow the pizza to bake for 2 to 3 minutes before changing the setting to broil or the bottom of the crust may get overly charred (a \"leopard\" crust is good, solid black is not).",
      "Use the peel to remove the pizza from the oven. Sprinkle it with about 1/4 of the basil, and about half of the bread crumbs. Slice and eat. Repeat the process to make the second pizza."

On the pan, toss all the vegetables with a generous amount of olive oil, coating them well. (I find it easiest to do this with my hands.) Sprinkle on generous amounts of coarse salt and freshly ground black pepper (and herbs or fennel, if using). Nestle sausage pieces among the vegetables.",
      "Roast this dish, uncovered, in the oven for one hour. You may turn the vegetables with a metal spatula once or twice during roasting, and I do if it's convenient, but you really can leave this dish unattended for the entire hour.",
      "After an hour the potatoes should be soft, the sausage cooked, the softer vegetables crisp-edged, and the pan juices concentrated into a lovely sauce. Use a metal spatula to loosen vegetables from the pan and give them a final toss in their pan juices.",
      "This is now ready to serve, right out of the pan. Optionally, sprinkle on cheese, chopped fresh herbs and additional coarse salt and freshly-ground pepper.",
      "You can vary this almost infinitely. In winter we might pair bratwurst with root vegetables and add caraway seed. In spring, try lamb sausage with eggplant, zucchini, feta or goat cheese and oregano. If you don't have sausage, omit it (here a nice cheese on the side is lovely) or use cubed tofu. I've served this over plain pasta when bread wasn't available. If there are vegetables languishing in your refrigerator, toss them on. If you don't have an hour, raise the temperature to 400 degrees F. and it should be done in 30 minutes. If you want to leave the house for two hours, roast this at 250. If you want to minimize cleanup, line the pan with parchment paper. (Even without a liner, the pan cleans up easily after a good soak.) You might think you need to cook different vegetables for different amounts of time, but you don't! Shove everything in the oven together, and the first vegetables to cook will give up their juices and acquire a crisp or leathery texture. The variety of textures, flavors and colors makes this dish seem far more complex than it is."

While meat is chilling, get your buns going.",
      "In a small bowl or Pyrex measure, dissolve yeast in warm water. Add sugar and gently stir. Let mixture soften for 5 minutes. Mixture should foam and double in volume. This means your yeast is alive and ready to make your buns. If it does not double in volume, discard and start again.",

Cover bowl with plastic wrap and let the dough rise in a warm, draft free place for about an hour, or until doubled in bulk. I have had good results by heating one cup of water in a microwave for one minute and then placing the covered bowl in the microwave with the heated water.",
      "When you are about 15 minutes away from filling buns, remove filling from refrigerator. Add the chopped cilantro to the shredded duck and place it near wherever you are going to fill your buns. Place apricot preserves into a small bowl and set it next to the duck filling. Cut 16 pieces of parchment, about 2\" x 2\" and lay out on a large rimmed baking sheet. Set aside.",
      "When dough has doubled, punch down and divide into 16 portions. Gently flatten each dough ball into a circle by pulling out the sides of the circle with the tips of your fingers. You want the very center of the circle to be thicker than the edges - imagine a sunny side up egg. Place a heaping tablespoon of duck filling onto the center (the thickest part of your circle). Top with 1/2 teaspoon of apricot preserves. Carefully gather up the edges around the filling and pinch and twist to seal the bun. Gently transfer bun to prepared baking sheet with parchment paper, pinched side down. Repeat with remaining dough and filling. Let the buns rise for 30 minutes.",
      "While filled buns are rising, preheat oven to 350 degrees. Make an egg wash by combining egg, a splash of water and pinch of salt. Gently brush bun tops with egg wash and bake for 18-20 minutes. Enjoy immediately or allow buns to cool completely and then freeze. I have had good results reheating manapua in the microwave, on the defrost setting for 30 seconds and then an additional 10 seconds. NOTE: As shown in the photo, all 16 will fit on one baking sheet, although most likely the manapua will puff up and fuse to the one next to it. While I thought they might leak, I used a knife to separate them without any problem."

      "To make the cookie dough, put the oat and rice flours, sugar, salt, and baking soda in the bowl of a food processor fitted with the steel blade. Pulse to blend. Add the butter, cream cheese, egg, and vanilla. Process until well blended: The mixture may come to a ball before it begins to spread out again in the bowl. The dough will be very soft and sticky.",
      "Scrape half of the dough onto a sheet of parchment paper and spread it roughly. Cover with a large sheet of plastic wrap. Use a rolling pin and very gentle pressure to roll and smooth it to an even thickness of 1/8-inch. Slide the dough (including the parchment and the plastic wrap) onto a baking sheet and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, preferably overnight. Repeat with the remaining dough and slide it on top of the first piece.",
      "Meanwhile, to make the filling, melt the butter with the unsweetened chocolate in a stainless steel bowl set directly in a wide skillet of almost simmering water. Stir frequently until the mixture is melted and smooth. Remove the bowl from the skillet. Stir in the sugar, vanilla, and salt. Stir the eggs in one at time. Stir in the rice flour. Stir briskly with a spatula until the mixture is thick and smooth and glossy pulls away from the sides of the bowl. Let cool. Stir in the chocolate chips. Refrigerate until needed.",
      "Position racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven and preheat the oven to 325\u00b0 F.",
      "Remove one sheet of dough from the fridge. Flip it parchment side up. Peel off the parchment and place it on the counter next to the dough. Grasp the plastic wrap and flip the dough back onto the parchment. Peel off the plastic wrap. Working quickly, cut out 3-inch or 2 1/2 -inch cookies and place them 1/2 inch apart on the lined pans. (If the dough becomes too soft to handle, slide it onto a pan and return to the fridge to firm up.) For 3-inch cookies, scoop and place a heaping (13-gram) teaspoonful of filling in the center of each cookie; for 2 12-inch cookies use a rounded teaspoon (11 grams). Bring 3 sides of each cookie up to partially cover the filling and press the edges together to seal them-the dough is quite sticky so that the seam will not open up in the oven! If the dough gets too soft to handle, put the pan in the fridge to firm it up. Repeat with the second sheet of dough.",
      "Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until the cookies are golden brown. Rotate the pans from top to bottom and front to back about halfway through the baking time to ensure even baking.",
      "While the cookies are baking, press all of the dough scraps together and reroll them between parchment and plastic wrap. Chill until firm enough to cut and fill. Since there is no gluten in the dough, you can reroll scraps as many times as you like without making the cookies tough.",
      "Set the pans, or just the liners on rack to cool. I like to serve them with a little nutmeg grated directly over the top. Cool cookies completely before stacking of storing. Cookies are best on the day they are made, but they keep for 2 to 3 days in an airtight container."
