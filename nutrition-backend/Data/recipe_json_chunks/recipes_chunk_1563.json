Using a spoon or your dough hook, beat in the bread flour, one cup at a time, until combined. Knead until the dough is smooth and pliable, about 8 minutes. Place dough in a bowl that has been lightly coated with oil or cooking spray. Cover and set in a warm, draft-free place to rise until doubled in size, about 2 hours.",
      "3. When dough has risen, turn it out onto a floured counter and roll into a very large rectangle (about 10\" by 24\") which should be just about 1/2 an inch thick. Slightly longer and thinner is OK, too. Spread the remaining stick of melted butter over the dough, being careful to leave a 1\" border on all sides. Combine the cinnamon and brown sugar in a small bowl and distribute evenly over the butter.",
      "4. In a medium bowl, combine the cream cheese, 3/4 cup confectioners' sugar, and the whole egg. (I would recommend a hand mixer for this. When I mix it by hand, it tends to come out clumpy/watery.) Spread in a thin layer over the brown sugar/butter/cinnamon mixture.",
      "5. Working from the long end that's closest to you, roll the dough into a tight cylinder. Carefully crimp the seam together with your fingers. Transfer the dough to a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and arrange so the seam is on the bottom, touching the parchment. Bring the two ends together to meet and form a large ring. Pinch tightly to seal. (It is VERY important you make sure all your pinching together sticks. Otherwise your filling will run right out.) Let it rise until doubled, about 30 minutes.",
      "6. Preheat the oven to 350 F. Bake the cake for 30-40 minutes, until dough is browned and sounds hollow when tapped. I would say that it's better to slightly under-bake this dough than to over-bake it. It can get a little dry. Let cool completely.",
      "7. To prepare glaze: In a small bowl, stir 2 cups of powdered sugar, 1 teaspoon of lemon juice, and 1/4 cup milk or water until smooth and lump-free. I like a thick glaze that's almost frosting-like, but you may feel free to thin the glaze if you like yours runnier. Spread on the top of the cooled cake and let the glaze run down the sides of the cake. Sprinkle immediately with the colored sugar. Let the glaze set for at least an hour before serving.",

Once they are well-combined, transfer the mixture to your ice cream maker and mix according to the manufacturer's directions. I use the ice cream attachment that goes with my KitchenAid mixer. After churning the ice cream, place it in the freezer to solidify it. (Note: You will only need about 2/3 of this ice cream for the sandwiches. You can store the rest in the freezer in an air-tight container or snack on it as you're working.)",

Remove the cookies from the pans and cool completely on a wire rack.",

Place one of the sandwich bases (top side down) on a piece of plastic wrap and spread 2/3 of the ice cream evenly on it. You can save the rest of the ice cream in the freezer for another time. Put the other sandwich base on top of the ice cream (top side up) and wrap the whole thing with plastic wrap. Freeze for at least 2 hours to let it solidify. Remove from the freezer and cut it in half. Then, cut each section into 6 sandwiches for a total of 12 sandwiches. Enjoy immediately or wrap the sandwiches individually and return them to the freezer.",

When mixing in the flour, use an on/off pulsing motion until it's blended in a little before putting it on low speed - it will save you a lot of mess!",
      "6. Use a small scoop (about 1\"), or a tablespoon to drop dough onto the prepared sheets. Be sure to leave at least 2 inches between the cookies - they will spread. Bake about 6-8 minutes, until the edges are just set, and have just a slight tinge of golden. You'll know they're ready if you press lightly on the tops of them with your finger and they spring back. Bake only one sheet of cookies at a time. To make these even more adorable, scoop teaspoons of dough (or use a 1/2\" size scoop) onto the baking sheet so the cakes will be bite size, but remember your baking time will be less (probably 4-6 minutes), just keep an eye on them.",
      "7. Remove cookies to a baking rack and cool a couple of minutes, then slide the parchment paper onto a baking rack to cool the cookies completely.",
      "For the Vanilla Bean Butter cream Frosting:",
      "Make sure your butter is at room temperature when you whip it - this is the key to achieving fluffy butter cream frosting!",
      "Using the whisk beater on your stand mixer, whip butter, vanilla bean seeds and 2 tablespoons of cream on high speed until light and fluffy, scraping down sides of bowl occasionally. Add 2 1/2 cups sugar, and salt; mix on low until sugar is fairly well blended in, then beat again until fluffy. If filling seems too stiff, add cream, one tablespoon at a time,and whip, until you get it to the desired consistency. If filling seems a little thin, add a couple tablespoons of confectioner's sugar at a time and beat it until you reach the desired consistency. If you plan to pipe the filling between the whoopie pies, you'll want it more firm.",
      "You can use this immediately, or save it for up to 3 days in the fridge. If you're using it later, you'll want to let it sit out at room temperature about 10 minutes before frosting the cookies, and give it a quick stir to make sure it's smooth.",
      "To assemble:",
      "Flip one whoopie pie cookie upside down, so the flat side faces up. Spread or pipe a couple of tablespoons of filling on it, and top it with another cookie, flat sides facing each other. Gently press the two cookies together so filling barely oozes out sides.",
      "Have your glittering sugar or other decorations in small bowls, and roll the edges of the cookies in it.",
      "Serve immediately, or cover and store in the refrigerator for up to 1 day. These also freeze beautifully, and can be either frozen with or without filling. It's best to wrap each one in waxed paper, then place them in a single layer in a vacuum Ziploc freezer bag, or squeeze as much air as possible out of a regular freezer bag - air is not your friend when freezing treats.",

      "7. Bake 15-20 minutes on the upper rack, turning your pans halfway through baking time to insure even browning and baking. Remove pans from oven, and flip and toss granola in pan breaking up any large pieces with a spatula. Make sure to bring the sides into the middle (they will want to brown quicker than the middle) and move the middle out. Stir and mix up well. Then spread out so it's a single layer again.",
      "8. Bake another 10 minutes or until your granola is crispy and a golden brown throughout. Again, watch the sides and bottom of granola. If it's darkening too much, simply remove pan from oven, stir it again, and add back to oven. Don't wander off at this point. Granola can burn quickly so continue to check pans every now and then to prevent said burning.",
      "9. Remove pans from oven and allow to cool completely. Once cooled, add granola to a large bowl and mix in your remaining 1 cup of coconut flakes. Then simply add to a large airtight container and munch away!",

It made it go by faster and it was a lot easier. Once all the flour is added, form dough into a ball and wrap in plastic wrap. Place in the refrigerator for 15-20 minutes (the longer you keep in the refrigerator the colder the dough becomes meaning the harder it is for the dough to be rolled).",

I divided the dough in half because there was so much but if you have a big enough surface you don't have to do that. Roll the dough out to about 1/4 inch thick. If the dough is too hard, you might want to let it come to room temp just a little bit. Use your cookie cutters to make shapes in the dough and place the cookies on top of the baking sheet. Bake for 10 minutes and repeat this cycle until all dough has been baked. Allow the cookies to completely cool before you begin to ice them.",

If you would like to use multiple colors separate the icing into ramekins and add a different food color into the separated icings. Decorate as desired. Feel free to add edible sprinkles or colored sugar on top. Once finished decorating place on a drying rack with napkins or parchment paper placed under to catch excess icing."

I apologize in advance for your new frosting addiction!",

In our family, we place a chuck roast in a slow cooker along with some water, chicken bouillon cubes, and allow it to cook a good 6 hours on high heat. And then lower it to low heat as we throw in some spice - a WHOLE bottle of Pepperoncini and allow it to cook for a few more hours. If you'd like the recipe, leave a comment and maybe you'll find it here the next time. If not, use your own favorite recipe.",
      "2) Now, to the salad! For this salad, you make your own dressing by combining the sour cream, milk, horseradish, and Dijon mustard in a small bowl and mix until thoroughly combined. Done! Now wasn't that easy? Set that off to the side, you won't need it until the end.",
      "3) Set a small pan over your stove top and add a little bit of oil. Turn it up to medium-high heat and let it sit there until you can hold your hand over the pan and feel the heat. (Reminds you of \"Chestnuts roasting over an open fire..\") Throw your onions in and let them cook, stirring every once in awhile until they look semi-transparent. Toss in the pot roast after that, mix, and allow it to cook until both look, smell, taste (your preference) hot and raring to go. Turn off the stove.",
      "4) Pour your spinach into a serving bowl, and then pour that wonderful looking pot roast-onion mixture in over it. (You're so close..!) Add the diced Roma tomato on top, and then add in that dressing you made in the beginning. Toss your salad until it's well covered, sit back, and enjoy!",

Once boiling, turn down to medium heat and continue to boil for 10 minutes. This allows the bones to release any impurities. The \"gunk\" will rise to the surface of the water and look like a very dirty bubble bath. (Ew. This is why you should use grass fed organic beef, especially when using soup bones. It yields much better broth flavor, too.)",
      "2. While the beef bones are boiling, it's time for some prepping. Turn oven to broil. Cut a large onion in half. Put the onion halves and the ginger pieces on a baking sheet. Broil in the oven for 10-15 minutes, checking and turning halfway through. They should be nice and roasted. Remove from the oven and set aside.",
      "3. Now in goes all the spices. Place the cinnamon sticks, cloves, anise, coriander and cardamom on the baking sheet and broil for 3-5 minutes to a slight char. Remove from the oven and place into a large metal mesh spice/tea ball. Set aside.",
      "4. Remove the bones with tongs, rinse them and place into a clean large stockpot. Place carrot, daikon, garlic, salt, sugar and the spice ball into the pot. Fill the pot with water until it is 1 inch from the top. Turn the heat to high again and bring to a boil. Once water is boiling, turn down to medium-low and simmer for a minimum of 2 hours. The longer the better.",
      "5. When done simmering, turn off heat, remove from the hot burner and let cool. Cover with a lid (or dinner plate) and put into the refrigerator overnight.",
      "Day 2:",
      "1. In the morning when you wake, check on your broth and the fat will have risen to the top and hardened for easy removal. Just scoop it off with a spoon and toss.",
      "2. Place the stockpot back onto the stove and heat over high heat. Once again, when boiling, turn the heat down to medium-low to simmer for another minimum of 2 hours up to all day long.",
      "3. When you are ready to eat, remove the bones from the soup. If there is any meat left on the bones, remove and put back into the soup. Cut meatballs in half and add these to the broth also.",
      "4. It is now time to slice the beef (eye of round, top sirloin, flank steak or tripe beef). Slice paper thin. Put the thawed beef into the freezer for 10 minutes to firm up before slicing. This will allow you to cut the beef very thin without it getting all wiggly and mangled on you-much easier! Use this technique for stir fry too! When sliced, place onto a plate and set aside.",
      "5. Prepare your fresh vegetables/herb plate. On a large plate put some sprouts, cilantro, Thai basil, culantro, the remaining half onion sliced paper thin, green onions, limes and jalapenos. Place your hoisin sauce and sriracha chili sauce on the table.",
      "6. Turn the burner back up to high heat and start putting the bowls together. In a large soup bowl place the prepared refrigerated noodles and desired amount of raw slices of beef. Once broth is boiling, ladle the hot broth and meatballs over the noodles and beef. The beef slices will now cook (don't worry! I would never tell you to eat raw meat).",
      "7. Find your spot at the table and top your bowl with all the fresh vegetables and herbs you wish. Squeeze a bit of lime, hoisin, and sriracha and stir.",

Sift the almond meal several times then sift again with the confectioners' sugar. Pull out the butter and cream cheese an hour or so before making these, so that they are also at room temperature.",
      "1. Cover at least two baking sheets with parchment paper. To ensure consistent sized cookies, trace a cookie cutter or your desired evenly-sized shapes onto the paper (make sure you have an even number and that they are the same shape, because you'll be making sandwiches and need sets of 2 matching) as a template then turn it over before piping. Prepare a pasty bag fitted with a large round tip. Set aside.",
      "2. For the batter: In a large mixing bowl sift together the almond meal and confectioners' sugar. Make a well in the center and add the egg whites. Fold the mixture with a spatula until it becomes a thick, paste-like batter.",
      "3. For the meringue: Place the egg whites in the large mixing bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. Set aside.",
      "4. In a small saucepan over medium-low heat combine the granulated sugar and water. Stir until the sugar is dissolved. Attach a candy thermometer to the pan and heat to 225 F. Once the syrup reaches 225 F, turn on the stand mixer and beat the egg whites on high. Continue to beat the whites while cooking the syrup until it reaches 239 F. You want the meringue to be at soft peak stage so if it reaches that stage before the syrup reaches 239 F, turn the mixer down to low. When the syrup hits 239 F remove it from the heat and slowly pour it into the egg whites while the mixer is running. Try to stream the syrup directly into the whites close to the side of the bowl so it won't cool too quickly. Whip on high for a minute then reduce the speed to low and continue beating until the bowl has cooled slightly and glossy stiff peaks have formed.",
      "5. Add about half of the meringue into the batter, gently folding until combined and smooth. Gradually add the remaining meringue, and food coloring if using, and fold until the batter is smooth. To test consistency, pick up the spatula and if the batter ribbons back into the bowl, it is ready. It should be like lava blending back into itself after about a minute.",

      "7. Fill pastry bags with the macaron batter. Pipe the batter onto the prepared baking trays in a V shape if making hearts. It may take a few times to get the hang of it, but keep at it. Once the first sheet is filled, rap the pan on the counter a few times to rupture any air bubbles trapped in the cookie. Rotate the pan and rap again. Set the baking sheet filled with heart shaped cookies aside to allow a shell to form. This will take about 20-30 sitting out at room temperature. Pipe another sheet of cookies and repeat until the batter is gone.",

      "While the cakes are baking, prepare the syrup. Pour frozen raspberries in a bowl and mash them while pouring the white sugar on them (according to taste). In a pot mix together the water, rum essence, sugar, and vanilla essence. Stir over medium heat until hot. Drain the juice from the raspberries and pour the juice in the syrup mixture.",
      "When the cakes are done, let them cool for a few minutes and then pour the syrup over them. You don't want the cakes to be too wet, but put syrup according to taste. Next prepare the raspberry filling. Start whipping the whipping cream, pouring in the powdered sugar while they're being stirred. Mix the whipping cream with the pudding and add the raspberries. Pour some filling on the bottom cake and spread around with a spatula. Place the next cake on top and repeat with the filling, and then place the third cake on top. For best results, chill the cake until the next day.",
      "To decorate the cake, whip the whipping cream with powdered sugar and have fun decorating your own cake. Enjoy!"

However, you don't want to see dark brown spots unless you have an unusual taste for crispy tortillas. When done remove it from the skillet and set it on a plate.",

You need to work fast as the syrup will harden quickly (if this happens just heat it in the microwave for a few seconds). Once the ramekins are coated, add the milk mixture to the ramekins, filling till nearly full. Cover each ramekin with foil. Place as many foil-covered ramekins as you can into a pressure cooker of boiling water (water should reach halfway up the ramekins). Close the pressure cooker and steam for 8 minutes. After 8 minutes, open the pressure cooker and the tops of the creme caramels should be springy and slightly jiggly. Be careful not to overcook but if you feel that the creme caramel is too jiggly, then cook for a further minute or two only. Remove ramekins and cool on the counter completely before turning out. You can run a cold knife around each ramekin to aid in removal.",

      "If you are going to make these cookies, I highly recommend looking at the related blog post; I put as many details as I could about making these cookies. This recipe is labeled \"difficult\" because of the rolling and twisting. If you choose to make drop cookies, this recipe is no more difficult than any other drop cookie recipe.",
      "Before we begin, there are a few provisos about making koulourakia. I'm not going to lie: these cookies are time-consuming if you make them the traditional way, rolling and shaping them as opposed to just scooping them and dropping them into small rounds. To me, the extra time is worth it, but it is a labor of love to the tune of about 5 hours.",
      "If you decide that you just want to scoop and drop cookies, it will go a lot faster. I'll give some ballpark baking times at the bottom. They are just as tasty round. Using the dough measurements I give, this recipe will yield about 15 dozen cookies twisted or 7 1/2 dozen dropped. It is an incredibly high yield recipe that would be a great choice for a cookie exchange as well.",
      "About the twisting: the dough is dry out of necessity. It is important for the final cookie consistency but it can make rolling a challenge, especially since you roll it to a log of about 3/8\" thickness-pretty thin, actually. The dough can and will crack and break as you roll it occasionally. Sometimes you can just pinch it back together, sometimes you need to re-roll it. And sometimes you just toss it back into the bowl and try again. I try to be as explicit as I can be with the instructions for rolling and baking in my blog. Don't misunderstand me, I don't want to discourage you from making them. They are a fabulous cookie! I just want you to be prepared if you choose to make them the traditional shape (and again, you can always just scoop out the dough and bake it into rounds).",
      "They should be golden brown when they come out-how brown is a matter for your personal preference. My aunt and I like them overdone because we feel it enhances the vanilla flavor but my mom prefers them lighter, so don't be afraid to experiment with different baking times. After all, you will have 15 dozen!",

      "7. Brush with beaten egg.",
      "8. Bake 10-15 minutes (depends on shape). Remove when golden brown. Let cool on the sheet for 1 minute before removing to racks."

Combine the 2 box mixes plus the ingredients specified on the box (water and eggs as listed above - but if your box specifies different amounts of each, make sure to use the ingredients specified on your box mix), and bake in a 9\"x13\" pan at 350F for about 45 minutes.",

      "Now comes the dipping. I'd recommend a variation of vanilla candy melts (the white and colored Wilton melts are all vanilla). Choose your main color and one or two contrasting colors if you wish. I had to lock in set amounts of melts for you to use for the sake of the recipe, but in practice, dipping the balls takes about a bag and a half of your main color melts. Melt the main color, thin it with some vegetable oil, adding a bit of oil at a time, because each color seems to require a different amount of oil to melt smoothly. It will be around two capfuls, maybe 1-2 Tablespoons of oil. The thinned melts should flow nicely and evenly from the spoon, like syrup. Once the chocolates are melted, dip the balls. Wait for the first dipped coating to harden before you drizzle on one or two accent colors.",

Also, toffee chips are available in bags for baking, either Skor or Heath (I prefer the latter), but if you can't find them, you can always finely chop or process a Heath bar in the food processor!",
      "I can not stress this enough, and this is the reason why I labeled this recipe as intermediate: the cookies will not look done when they come out. In fact, they will seem underdone and will still be incredibly soft. They will have lost most of their shininess, but will be so soft it will almost look like they are about to deflate. However, trust me, if your oven is truly 350F, and you use a #40 scoop (scraping off excess dough), they should be ready to come out of the oven at right around 12 minutes, even if they are so soft they are souffle-like.",
      "You need to leave them on the cookie sheet outside of the oven for an additional 5 minutes to continue baking before removing them to a cooling rack to cool and harden further. The thing is, these cookies harden. A lot. And if you don't take them out while they are still underdone, you will end up with chocolate hazelnut hockey pucks. Which isn't tragic-they will still taste good-but the consistency will be off a little. I know, I know, it is a leap of faith for me too every time I pull them out of the oven at 12 minutes, but it always ends up being the right call. Unfortunately, you'll have to wait until the cookies fully cool down to believe this, because they will be soft right up until they achieve room temperature. But trust me.",

      "3. Next add your chocolate chips. You could also use a bar of chocolate. If you do, just make sure you chop it up so that the pieces are about the size of chocolate chips (and equal to 2 cups). Next add your cubed butter.",
      "4. Allow this mixture to melt together and cook about 8-10 minutes, stirring occasionally. You'll want your mixture to smooth out completely and thicken up. Watch your heat-you want a continuous soft and gentle simmer of the water in the pot below. If it's a boil you may scorch your chocolate. If things get too warm, simply remove bowl from pot, turn down heat, and add bowl back once the water in the pot is simmering again.",
      "5. Once your mixture is smooth and thickened, remove the bowl from the heat and pour the mixture into your baking dish. Use a spatula to smooth the top.",
      "6. Allow it to come to room temperature. Once at room temperature, wrap the baking dish with plastic wrap and chill in the fridge for 2 hours or until completely chilled.",
      "7. When ready to cut into squares, remove dish from fridge and remove plastic wrap. Then, run a knife under hot water until it becomes warm and run knife gently around the edges of your fudge and pan. Pull fudge out of dish using the paper overhang as handles. Flip it over onto a cutting board, and gently remove paper. Run a large knife under hot water again and make your slices. Remember to run the knife under hot water and dry it off between cuts. You could even cut this into smaller squares (1.5x1.5-inch squares will get you around 25 pieces give or take)!",
      "8. Store refrigerated in an airtight container for up to one week.",

Do the same with the colored dough using two separate sheets of parchment paper. Keep the parchment on the dough and place both sheets in the freezer to harden. It is easier to do this if they are on a cookie sheet because you want them to be flat.",

Place the colored dough on top of the white dough with the parchment side of the white dough down on the work surface. After the dough is pliable (this will take a little bit if it is truly frozen) gently roll the two sheets together into a log as tightly as you can. Remove the sheet of parchment from the bottom as you go. The dough will probably break so just use your fingers to smooth out the cracks.",
      "After rolling the dough, add the sprinkles to a large jelly roll pan and roll the log in the sprinkles. You will need to press them in to ensure the roll is fully covered in sprinkles. Wrap the dough roll in plastic wrap and either place in the fridge until firm again (about 3 or 4 hours) or put it in the freezer until you would like to bake. You can keep the dough in the freezer for up to two months.",
      "When you are ready to bake, preheat the oven to 350 F. Unwrap the dough and place the log on a cutting board. Slice it using a very sharp knife, into slices about 1/4 inch to 1/8 inch. I would err on the side of 1/4-inch. Work quickly as it is more difficult to cut when the dough warms up. Place the slices of dough on a cookie sheet that you've lined with a Silpat mat or parchment paper. They will spread so be sure to give them enough room.",
      "Bake for 15-17 minutes or just until the edges start to brown. Remove from the oven and let the cookies cool on the cookie sheet for about 2 minutes or until set. Then transfer to a wire cooling rack.",

      "3. Divide the dough into 2 portions and wrap them individually with plastic wrap. Flatten the dough into a disc shape and refrigerate for at least 1 hour or up to 1 day.",
      "4. Remove 1 disc from the refrigerator and place on a lightly-floured surface. Roll the dough out to 1/4 inch (1 cm) thickness, adding a little more flour as necessary to prevent the dough from sticking.",
      "5. Preheat the oven to 375\u00b0F.",
      "6. Cut the dough into matchsticks around 5cm long and 1/2 cm wide and place them on a parchment-lined baking sheet, leaving some room in between each matchstick as they spread a little when baking. Re-roll the leftover scraps of dough and cut out as many matchsticks as possible. Repeat with the second disc of dough. Once you have filled a baking sheet, place the cookies in the refrigerator for 10-15 minutes to prevent the cookies from spreading too much when they are baked.",
      "7. Bake the cookies for 6-10 minutes, keeping a close eye on them as they can quickly burn. For cookies with a little crunch, try 8-10 minutes. They're ready when the bottom and edges brown slightly. For cookies that are softer and chewier, check them at around 6-8 minutes and take them out as soon as there is any sign of browning at the bottom edges of the cookies. Leave them on the baking sheet to cool for 5 minutes before removing them onto a flat plate or cooling rack to cool completely.",
      "For the icing:",
      "1. Sift icing sugar into a bowl. Add corn syrup and milk and stir until thoroughly combined. Add food coloring until you reach the colour you like. I think I had to use about 1-2 teaspoons of red in mine. Add more milk (1 teaspoon at a time) to loosen up the mixture and stir until you reach the consistency of thick but dip-able icing.",
      "2. When the cookies are completely cooled, take each cookie and dip one end into the icing so they look like matchsticks. Place them on a sheet of parchment or wax paper and allow icing to set. After 15-20 minutes, when the icing is kind of set (you'll see that some of the icing has spread out, that's normal), take each cookie and loosen it up from the parchment or wax paper to remove the cookie from the excess icing. Place on a clean sheet of parchment or wax paper and refrigerate to set completely.",

You can test this by dropping a spoonful of the chocolate/peanuts onto a wax paper or parchment-lined countertop. It should be thick and peanut-y (technical term!) and not spread out all over the place. Add more peanuts or chocolate chips as needed to get the consistency you prefer. Drop by spoonfuls (or use a melon baller, if you have one) on the parchment-lined baking sheet and allow to harden. This makes lots and lots of peanut clusters, so be sure to clear off some counter space beforehand. These should harden in about one hour, depending on how big you make them."

      "Using a large, sharp knife, lay the squash on its side, and carefully remove a sliver from the top and bottom of the squash. This allows a sturdier base when slicing in half.",
      "Next, stand the squash upright. Place your knife in the middle of the squash and move it down the squash, slicing it in half. Now the seeds are exposed. Remove them. Using a fork, poke the outside skin in a couple of areas.",
      "With flesh side up, drizzle the one tablespoon of olive oil over the squash, and season with a bit of salt.",
      "Place the squash, flesh side down on the prepared pan. Put the pan in the preheated oven and cook for about 30 minutes, or until fork tender.",
      "Once fully cooked, remove squash from the oven, and let cool.",

      "Now let's get started on the risotto.",
      "A couple of important things here. Make sure your stock is warm. So put it in a saucepan, bring it to a simmer and keep it on a simmer. And more importantly get ready for a workout. This is a stirring challenge but I am confident you will do just fine.",
      "To a medium sized pot, add the butter and 2 tablespoons olive oil, and cook on a medium heat. Once melted, toss in the onion and garlic, and cook for a few minutes, stirring along the way.",
      "Once the onion and garlic are translucent add in the rice and continue to stir for a couple of minutes. This will allow the rice to get coated in the butter and oil and begin to blossom.",
      "Next, add in the wine. Cook the rice until the wine is fully absorbed. Keep stirring!",
      "Next, add in a ladle full of the warm stock. Raise the heat to a medium high heat, and continue stirring until the stock is fully absorbed. Once the rice is almost dry, add another ladle of stock. Add in the squash puree (roughly a cup of it). Keep stirring!",
      "Now what you will begin to notice is that the risotto will begin to blossom and turn into a creamy consistency. This gets exciting. You are almost there.",
      "Add a bit more stock, and season with a dash of salt. Your overall cooking time is going to be around 20-30 minutes, or until the rice is al dente.",
      "Your goal here is to not end up with mushy rice, rather rice that is creamy yet still has a bite to it. Al dente.",
      "When you have reached the al dente part, add in the Parmesan cheese, give another good stir, and remove from the heat.",
      "Plate and serve immediately.",
      "The result is a creamy risotto that is just perfectly balanced with the squash. That white wine adds a great perfume to the dish. That along with the garlic and onions ... Wow. You can tell I am excited just by writing about it. Again, sexy. It's a sexy dish, and one that has comfort written all over it. Give this one a shot. It's a real winner, plus you get a workout in! Hope you enjoy."

Decorate it with the powdered sugar and cocoa shortly before serving. Csudafinom csokitorta will keep well (refrigerated) and continue to be moist and delicious for a week after it is baked.",
      "You will also need:",
      "1. A springform cake pan with a 9 and 1/2-inch (24-centimeter) base.",
      "2. Parchment paper.",
      "3. A double boiler or homemade bain marie made with a pot partially filled with water and a bowl that fits snugly into the rim of it.",
      "4. A mixer: a hand mixer is very convenient since mixing the cake requires two mixing bowls.",
      "5. 2 mixing bowls: one of them may be the bowls of a standing mixer.",

      "7. For decorating the cake: a small sieve and scissors and paper if you wish to draw and cut out a stencil and stencil something pretty on top of the cake. (See the photos in the related link.)",
      "For the cake:",
      "1. Preheat the oven to 350 F. Butter the cake pan and line the bottom with a round of parchment paper. Set pan aside.",
      "2. Melt the chocolate and butter in the top of a double boiler or the top bowl of a homemade bain marie. Once melted remove the bowl from the heat and set the melted mixture to the side.",

      "6. Pour the batter into the cake pan and bake it for 50 minutes. Remove pan from the oven. Cool the cake in the pan set on a rack. As the cake cools, the top will crack. This is the nature of the cake. The 'crackled' surface has its own special texture and is powdered over with sugar and cocoa after the cake cools so that it will look pretty.",
      "7. Once the cake has cooled completely, remove the rim of the springform pan. Leave the cake on the bottom of the pan or shift it off the pan bottom onto the rack. Peel away the parchment paper by carefully lifting the cake a little, first on one side, then on another, detaching and pulling away the parchment from underneath it. The cake is dense enough to lift gently but do not turn the cake upside down on the rack.",
      "For decorating the cake: Photo illustrations are on the related link. Sift powdered sugar and then some cocoa over the top of the cake or make a simple stencil by tracing the form of the cake pan on a piece of paper, drawing a simple design in the middle and cutting it out with a pair of sharp scissors. Sift powdered sugar over the cake. Then, place the stencil over the top of the cake and sift cocoa powder over the cut-out portions, creating a pretty two-tone design.",
      "Serving suggestion: Some heavy cream, lightly whipped and sweetened, goes very well with this cake.",

When the soup has reduced to your liking, put the soup into your serving bowls (about a 8-12 ounces per person). Squeeze some lime juice over the soup after you've put the garnishes on.",

Cake is done when it has puffed and 2 1/2 to 3 inches around the circumference are set so that a toothpick plunged into the area comes out clean. Also, the center should move slightly if the pan is shaken.",
      "Allow the cake to cool in the pan for 10 minutes. Run a knife around the edge of the pan and invert cake onto a rack. Allow it to cool for an hour or two; it must be thoroughly cooled if it is going to be iced.",
      "For the icing :",
      "Place the chocolate and rum in the small pan again and cover and set in the larger pan of almost simmering water. Remove pans from the heat and let the chocolate melt for 5 minutes or so, until perfectly smooth. Lift the chocolate pan out of the hot water and beat in the butter a tablespoon at a time with a wooden spoon. Then beat it over a bowl of ice water until chocolate mixture has cooled to spreading consistency. At once spread it over you cake with a spatula or knife. Decorate with additional almonds if desired.",

Repeat with second piece of dough.",

      "Before end of baking time, begin browning the 1/2 cup of butter. Put 1/2 cup of butter in a saucepan over medium heat; when butter melts, lower heat and cook until browned (roughly 8 minutes). Once dough has cooled a bit on racks, pour browned butter over top of loaves. After butter has soaked in a bit, generously sift powdered sugar over top.",
      "Let cool (roughly 10-20 minutes, depending on self-control) and cut into thin slices and serve warm, making sure to lick your fruity, buttery and sugary fingertips afterward."
