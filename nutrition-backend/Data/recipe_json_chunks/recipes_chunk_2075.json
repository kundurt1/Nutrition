      "Put the skin and fat in a medium saucepan (nonstick, if you have one) with the water and bring to a simmer over high heat.",
      "Turn the burner to low and allow the fat to render.",
      "This will take anywhere from 90 minutes to several hours, depending on how much skin and fat you have and how hot your burner is.",
      "Give the skin a stir now and then so that it doesnt stick to the bottom and burn.",
      "Keep an eye on it.",
      "You dont want to let the fat get too hot and turn brown, which will happen once the water has cooked out of the skin.",
      "One of the keys to supet-lative schmaltz is avoiding a roasted flavor and an overly browned appearance; you want a light, clear, clean schmaltz.",
      "When the chicken skin is golden brown, add the onion.",
      "Continue to cook until the skin and onion are well browned.",
      "The gribenes should be crispy-chewy.",

      "I recommend freezing any schmaltz you wont be using in a day or two.",
      "Its best kept in container, with plastic wrap pressed down onto the surface, covered with a lid or a second layer of plastic wrap, then wrapped in foil if you intend to store for a long time; this careful wrapping prevents other freezer flavors from infiltrating your schmaltz, and the foil will prevent light from damaging the fat over time.",
