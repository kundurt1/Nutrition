Boil for a minute and remove the filling from the heat. If you want it to cool down quickly, transfer the filling to a bowl and put it in the fridge or freezer while you prepare the dough.",
      "To make the dough: In a big bowl, combine the flour, salt and baking powder. Add the shortening. Use your fingers or a fork to mash in the shortening until the mixture is crumbly. Stir in the milk, forming a nice, slightly stiff dough. Knead it about 8 or 10 times to get the gluten in the flour activated a little bit. Put a piece of waxed paper on your counter. Pat the dough into a thick rectangle on top of the waxed paper. Using a rolling pin, roll the dough out into a big rectngle, about 1/2 inch thick, or a little thinner.",
      "Spread the cool filling onto the dough, like spreading butter on bread. Spread it to within 3/4 inch of the edges. It is good to cool the filling down because hot filling is challenging to work with. Warm filling is acceptable. Now, using the waxed paper to help, roll the dough up like a jelly roll, peeling back the waxed paper as you roll. Form a long cylinder of dough and filling swirled together. Throw away the waxed paper when done rolling you cylinder. Slice the roll with a sharp knife into 12-15 pieces. Lay the pieces on an oiled cookie sheet, rearranging them slightly so they are pretty and pinwheel shaped if necessary. Bake at 425F for abut 20 minutes."

      "Eggplant Filling:",
      "Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Sprinkle the eggplant generously with salt and let sit 30 minutes. Drain well in a colander, pressing to remove any excess moisture, and then toss in some olive oil and black pepper. Roast on a sheet pan until completely tender, and then transfer to a food processor. Reduce the oven to 300 degrees F. Puree the eggplant and then spread it onto the sheet pans before returning it to the oven to dry out. The eggplant should deepen in color and become fairly stiff.",
      "Meanwhile, cook the garlic and onions in a heavy-bottomed pan until deeply caramelized. Stir in the eggplant puree and cook, 10 minutes. Spread the eggplant mixture out onto a sheet pan to cool, and then combine with the ricotta, Parmigiano-Reggiano and some parsley in a large bowl. Season with lemon juice, zest, nutmeg, salt and black pepper.",
      "For assembling:",
      "Roll out the pasta dough into very thin sheets, and then cut into 3-by-2-inch rectangles. Transfer the eggplant mixture to a piping bag and pipe the filling down the center of each rectangle, leaving a 1/2-inch margin on either side. Wet your finger and barely dampen the top edge of the rectangle. Roll up each caramelle, starting from the bottom, until you have a tube. Gently pinch the ends on either side of the filling and twist. (You are aiming for a \"Tootsie Roll\" look.) Cook in boiling salted water until the pasta feels tender at the twist and the center is cooked but still with tooth, 4 to 5 minutes.",
      "Warm the Gorgonzola Fonduta over low heat until smooth, adding a touch of cream if needed. Drizzle about 1 tablespoon down the center of warmed plates, lining up the caramelle on top. Sprinkle with toasted pine nuts. This recipe was provided by a chef, restaurant or culinary professional and may have been scaled down from a bulk recipe. The Food Network Kitchens chefs have not tested this recipe, in the proportions indicated, and therefore, we cannot make any representation as to the results.",
      "Gorgonzola Fonduta:",
      "Whisk together the sugar and egg yolks until light in color. Bring the cream to a simmer in a heavy-bottomed pot, and then slowly whisk into the egg yolks, to temper. Pour the cream and eggs back into the pot and cook over low heat until it thickens and coats the back of a spoon.",
      "Whisk in the cheese a few pieces at a time until incorporated and melted. Remove from the heat and season with salt and cayenne pepper."

With a rubber spatula or wooden spoon, gently fold the egg mixture into the chocolate-cream mixture until blended. Cover the mousse and refrigerate until ready to assemble the tiramisu. (You should have about 2 cups mousse. The mousse may be made ahead, covered, and refrigerated for up to 1 day.).",
      "To make the zabaglione:.",
      "Prepare an ice water bath. Combine the yolks, rum, Marsala and 1/2 cup sugar in the top of a double boiler. Place over (nottouching) barely simmering water in the lower pan and whisk vigorously, or beat with an electric mixer, until the mixture begins to foam. Whisk continuously until the mixture triples in volume and thickens to form soft mounds when the whisk is lifted, about 7 minutes. Immediately place the top of the double boiler in the ice water bath to stop the cooking. Let cool, sitrring occasionally.",
      "In a small bowl, beat the 1/2 cup heavy cream until it begins to foam. Add the remaining 2 teaspoons sagar and continue to beat until the cream holds soft peaks. Fold whipped cream into the cooled zaboglione. Cover and chill for several hours before assembling the tiramisu. You should have about 2 cups.",
      "To assemble the dessert:.",
      "In a small bowl or pitcher, add the sugar to the hot espresso. Stir well to dissolve the sugar, then add the dark rum.",
      "Cut off the top of the cake and reserve for another use (see chefs note). Cut the cake in half horizontally. Arrage a layer of cake, cut side up, in the bottom of a deep 2 1/2 quart bowl. Moisten evenly with some of the espresso syrup (can use a turkey baster). Spread half of the mousse on top, and then spread half of the zabaglione on top of the mousse. Arrange the second layer of cake, again cut side up, on the mousse. Moisten well with syrup. Spread the remaining mousse on top in an even layer, followed by the remaining zabaglione. Cover and refrigerate for several hours or overnight before serving. With a vegetable peeler, cut curls of chocolate to garnish the top, or dust with cocoa.",
      "Chefs Note:.",
      "The shiny to of the cake will not readily absorb syrup. If you do not cut it off, you might find dry spots in your tiramisu. But don't throw the top out! Crumble it inot crumbs and place them in a 150 degree to 200 degree oven until thoroughly dry and crunchy. Use to decorate the top of the tiramisu, or save them to add to cookie batters or to scatter in pies and tarts to absorb juices."
