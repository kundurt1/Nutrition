To the slightly cooled butter (so you don't scramble the egg), add the next eleven ingredients - the egg, 1 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup granulated sugar, molasses, oil, vanilla, 2 teaspoons cinnamon, ginger, cloves, salt and whisk vigorously to combine until batter is smooth and silky. Add the flour, baking, soda and stir to just incorporate; batter will be thick (Note regarding flour- I live in San Diego and it's incredibly dry here this time of year and I likely need less flour than other climates. I used 2 1/4 cups plus about 2 tablespoons flour. Depending on your climate and humidity, you may wish to start with 2 1/4 cups and increase to 2 1/2 cups flour, as necessary. The dough should be quite thick, albeit sticky and tacky, courtesy of the molasses)",
      "Fold in the chocolate chips and chocolate baking chunks (I used nearly 6 ounces; using a total of 1 1/2 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips is okay if you don't have baking chocolate or a chocolate bar to chop). Cover mixing bowl or transfer batter to an airtight food storage container and refrigerate dough for at least 2 hours, up to 5 days, prior to baking.",

      "For the Cinnamon-Sugar Coating for Rolling - In a small bowl, combine about 3/4 cup granulated sugar, 1 teaspoon cinnamon, and stir to combine.",
      "Using a cookie scoop, form 2-ounce mounds of dough and roll each ball through the cinnamon-sugar mixture and place on baking trays, spaced about 2 inches apart (I bake 8 to a tray). Allow cookies to bake in fairly domed-up, mounded, ball-like shapes. Bake for about 8 to 9 minutes, or until tops have just set, taking care not to overbake so they stay soft and chewy. Note - The cookies in the photos are baked for exactly 8 minutes, and they're soft with melted chocolate."

      "The one thing I will include here is this: Most people who think they don't like eggplant say it's because it's bitter and seedy. That's because it wasn't made right. To avoid that, first peel the eggplants with a vegetable peeler. Then slice them about a 1/2 inch thick. Next, find a big grill pan and start lining it with layers of sliced eggplant. After each layer, give a liberal toss of the kosher salt. Once they're all on there, top it with an upside-down sheet pan and place some cookbooks or a cast-iron pot on top to weigh it down. This is THE most important step, as it will draw out the bitterness and pack down the seeds.",

Place the pumpkin, cut side down, in the water, cap wedged in near it. Bring to a boil over high heat. Cover tightly and team for 10 to 15 minutes to precook slightly. Remove the pot from the heat and let cool. When cool, remove from the pot. Since the pumpkin will be eaten with the stuffing, I like to season the inside with salt, pepper, a little tamari, Pickapeppa, and brown sugar, rubbing this into the exposed interior flesh after steaming.",
      "1. Place the apricots and prunes in a small, heatproof bowl. Place the apple juice in a small saucepan over high heat and bring to a boil. Immediately pour the juice over the dried fruit. Let stand for at least 2 hours, but overnight or a day or two in advance is fine. Drain the dried fruit, reserving both the fruit and the soaking liquid. Coarsely chop the fruit and set aside.",
      "2. Preheat the oven to 375\u00b0F, then turn down to 200\u00b0F.",
      "3. Set a wire rack on a baking sheet and place a single layer of bread slices on the rack. Place in the preheated oven and bake, slowly, turning once, until the bread is hard, crunchy, and dry all the way through, but not browned. This is a fairly slow process - it might take 45 to 60 minutes, but set the timer at 20-minute intervals to remind you to check. You with either need to do 2 sheets' worth of bread (in which case, reverse their positions in the oven halfway through), or repeat the toasting process again until all bread is prepared. Remove the dry bread from the oven and let cool.",
      "4. Coarsely crumble the bread into a large bowl. Add the onion and leafy celery and toss to combine. Measure the sage (starting with the smaller amount) into your hands and rub the leaves back and forth in your palms until they crumble (this releases the volatile essential oils). Add the sage to the bread mixture. Pour the melted butter over the mixture and toss well to combine. Add the soaked dried fruit and toss again. The dressing should still be dry. Begin adding the liquid, a combination of vegetable stock and the reserved fruit soaking liquid. Use more stock than juice, and use just enough to moisten the dressing without making it soggy. Keep tossing, adding stock as needed. Add tamari, starting with about 1 tablespoon. Taste for salt and add it and plenty of pepper to taste. More sage, maybe? This is also the point at which you can add a little dried basil and oregano, too, if you like. The stuffing can be prepared up to this point and stored, covered and refrigerated, overnight.",
      "5. On the day you plan to stuff the pumpkin, preheat the oven to 375\u00b0F.",
      "6. If not using nonstick, spray a baking dish large enough to accommodate the pumpkin with cooking spray.",
      "7. Stuff the dressing into the cavity of the prepared pumpkin, topping with the pumpkin's cap. Place the stuffed pumpkin in the prepared baking dish. Place in the preheated oven and bake until the pumpkin is slightly brown and looks a bit collapsed in on itself, or, as Ned says, like a plump European duchess, about 40 minutes. Serve whole, at the table."

      "In a large mixing bowl, combine pork with ginger, cilantro, garlic, chives, salt, and pepper. In another bowl, whisk together egg, sesame oil, soy sauce, and cornstarch. Mix this into the pork mixture with your hands, making sure it's well combined. Make sure your wrappers are completely defrosted before starting. Have a small dish of water nearby. Put one wrapper at a time one a clean working surface and place a scant teaspoon of filling in the middle. Using your fingers, dampen the edge of the wrapper and fold it into a half-moon. Push the edges together tightly; you may also decoratively crimp the edges if you like. Repeat until finished (with or without child labor!). Dumplings can be fried, baked or boiled, but the traditional Cantonese method for cooking pot stickers is a hybrid of frying and steaming. Heat a large non-stick skillet on medium high and lightly coat the bottom with oil. Place about 20 or so pot stickers in a tight circle, flat side-down. Allow them to sizzle in the pan for about 1 minute then add about a half cup of water. Cover immediately, as it will splatter. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook until you can see the moisture inside the dumplings boiling, about 10 minutes. Remove lid and increase heat to medium high. Allow the water to boil off and the bottoms to brown, about 5 minutes. Gently unstick the stickers with a spatula. Invert a plate over the pan then flip the whole circle of pot stickers onto the plate, browned side-up. Popo would serve these with a simple dipping sauce of equal parts soy sauce and vinegar, but they're great plain, too. You can freeze any extras before cooking them. You can use the same method to cook them from frozen, but it might take about 5 minutes longer."

If you prefer less heat, you can bypass the chile oil and jalapenos, and instead top the burrata with a drizzle of olive oil and balsamic vinegar reduction (boil 1/2 cup good quality balsamic until it is reduced by half and becomes a thick syrupy consistency; allow to cool before serving). Add a sprinkling of pine nuts to the top of the cheese to complete.",

Some coating may pool around the base of the ball onto the wax paper. If so, simply take a toothpick and use it to draw a line around the base of the cake ball before the coating sets. Once the coating sets, you can break off any unwanted coating.",

      "You can use a mini ice cream scoop to get uniform-size cake balls.",
      "If you don't need or want to make 48 cake balls, simply divide the cake in half for 24 cake balls or in quarters for 12 and freeze the remaining cake for later use. Remember to reduce the amount of frosting proportionally."

You can even add sofrito straight from the freezer to the pan in any recipe that calls for it in this book.",
      "Pantry Notes: Ajices Dulces, also known as cachucha or ajicitos are tiny sweet peppers with a hint of heat. They range in color from light to medium green and yellow to red and orange. They add freshness and an herby note to the sofrito and anything you cook. Do not mistake them for Scotch bonnet or Habanero chilies (which they look like)--those two pack a wallop when it comes to heat. If you can find ajicitos in your market, add them to sofrito. If not, up the cilantro and add a pinch of cayenne pepper. Culantro is not cilantro. It has long leaves with tapered tips and serrated edges. When it comes to flavor, culantro is like cilantro times ten. It is a nice, not essential addition to sofrito. (See Sources for both the above.)"

In a medium saucepan combine 1 cup butter, 1/3 cup cocoa, and 1 cup of water. Bring mixture to a boil, stirring constantly. Remove from heat. With an electric hand-held mixer on medium speed, beat chocolate mixture into the dry mixture until thoroughly blended. Add eggs, 1/2 cup of buttermilk, and 1 1/2 teaspoons of vanilla. Beat for 1 minute (batter will be thin). Pour batter into the prepared pan. Bake in a 350\u00b0 oven about 22 to 25 minutes for the 15X10-inch pan or about 30 to 35 minutes for the 13X9-inch pan, or until a wooden pick or cake tester inserted in center comes out clean. Pour warm chocolate frosting over the warm cake, spreading evenly. Place cake in pan on a wire rack; cool thoroughly before cutting. Makes 24 servings. Frosting: In a medium saucepan combine 1/4 cup butter, 3 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder, and 3 tablespoons buttermilk. Bring to a boil, stirring, over medium heat. Remove from heat; add 2 cups confectioners' sugar and 1/2 teaspoon vanilla. Beat until smooth. Add more confectioners' sugar or a little milk or more buttermilk, if needed, for a spreadable frosting. If desired, stir in 1/2 cup coarsely chopped pecans. Spread the warm frosting over the cake. Note: As reviews have suggested, more frosting might be needed for a larger sheet pan. Increase amounts or double the frosting recipe for the larger cake."

I recommend that if it is an Asian dish you find it in, substitute the other Asian herb standbys - basil and/or mint. If it is a Mexican recipe use oregano or parsley in its place and if it is a Middle Eastern recipe, use parsley. Or just leave it out and don't make any substitution."

      "Defrost frozen puff pastry, if it's not defrosted already. It's easiest to let it sit out on your countertop for 40 minutes. Preheat oven to 400\u00b0 F. Melt butter (or substitute) in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook the diced apples for 2 minutes, stirring occasionally. Juice the 1/2 lemon over the apples and add coconut sugar, arrowroot, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, and lemon zest. Cook for 3 minutes, until apples are knife-tender and sauce is thickened. Remove from heat stir in the vanilla or almond extract. While filling cools, unfold the puff pastry on a lightly floured surface. With a sharp knife, cut it into 4 equal squares for 4 large apple turnovers. (This can also be cut into 8 equal squares for 8 small turnovers.) To assemble, brush the egg wash or almond milk along the edges. This will be a binder for the turnovers. Add 1/4 (or 1/8 if you're making smaller turnovers) of the spiced apple mixture in the middle of each square. Fold pastry in half diagonally and lightly press together. Run a knife along the edges to seal the pastries completely and create a decorative design. Transfer to baking sheet lined with a silpat or parchment paper. Make 1 or 2 small slits on the top of each turnover and sprinkle with additional sugar if desired. Bake for 15 to 18 minutes until top is golden brown. Remove from oven and, this is important!!, let cool for 10 minutes on a wire rack. For the glaze: Whisk all of the ingredients together until combined. Add more milk to make the glaze thinner, or more powdered sugar for a thicker glaze. Drizzle it over warm turnovers and serve immediately."
