Honey can have very distinctive flavor in larger amounts. Add a cinnamon stick or two or a teaspoon of ground cinnamon.

      "This recipe has three parts: a shortbread crust, the dulce de leche filling and the ganache.",
      "First, let's make the shortbread-type crust: Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F. Put together in a large bowl the butter, the self-rising flour and the caster sugar. With very clean hands, rub them together until it resembles coarse meal and everything is combined. Press onto the bottom only (not the sides) of a 10\" x 15\" oven safe cake pan or glass casserole dish. Bake for about 20 minutes, or until the shortbread is a nice golden color. Remove from the oven and let cool completely before proceeding.",
      "Once the crust is cool (room temperature), put the dulce de leche in a small pan and heat slightly over low heat, stirring constantly. You want to achieve an easily spreadable consistency without it getting too liquid or too hot. Once it is nice and malleable, spread the dulce de leche all over the shortbread crust (pour it all on top of the shortbread and then spread it carefully with the back of a metal dinner spoon). Let cool to room temperature and then refrigerate until very cold and firm (at least a couple of hours).",
      "Once the dulce de leche is nice and cold, you can go ahead and make the ganache: finely chop the chocolate and put in a heat resistant bowl. In a separate heat resistant bowl put the butter and the heavy cream, and bring to a boil in the microwave (check it often and only heat it until it boils but don't let it over-boil). Pour the hot heavy cream over the chopped chocolate and very slowly stir and mix until the chocolate is completely dissolved in the heavy cream and you have a nice and shiny chocolate ganache. Add the vanilla and stir. Let it sit for about 5 minutes before proceeding. Then pour the ganache over the shortbread and dulce de leche and - with a light hand - spread it all over (you do not want to overwork the ganache, otherwise it may lose its shine, and you definitely do not want the dulce de leche and the ganache to mix).",
      "Refrigerate for several hours until the ganache is completely set and hard (think truffle material). Cut into bars or squares and enjoy! Keep leftovers refrigerated."

After the 3-4 minutes, remove the crust from the oven and assemble as directed above. You will take a few minutes off of the full 10 minutes cooking time because the crust will be half way done.

Slowly begin adding in the flour mixture a few spoonfuls at a time. When the dough begins to come together, transfer to the prepared tart pan(s) and press the dough into it. Prick the bottom of the dough all over with a fork and place in the freezer for at least 10 minutes to let rest.",
      "Once chilled, line the tart with parchment paper and fill with pie weights or beans. Bake in the oven for 10-15 minutes, until edges are lightly golden brown and set. Next, carefully remove the parchment paper from the pie and place back in the oven for 5-10 minutes until the center of the tart is golden brown. Remove from the oven and place on a cooling rack.",
      "For the filling: Using a double boiler, heat the cream until it's very hot but not boiling. Remove from the stove and add the chocolate. Gently stir the mixture until all the chocolate is melted and combined. Add Framboise (or raspberry extract) and stir until combined. You should have a beautiful glossy mixture when finished. Pour chocolate filling into the thoroughly cooled baked crusts. Carefully tap the side of the pan to even out the filling. Leave the tart on the counter to cool (about 30 minutes) and then move to the refrigerator to chill for an additional 2 or 3 hours. The filling should be firm when done.",

      "1. If using whole rosettes of mache, pluck the individual leaves apart. Wash the leaves well, refresh them in a bowl of ice water, and dry them in a salad spinner or on cotton towels. If the salad isn't being made and served right away, spread the leaves out on cotton dish towels, roll them up in the towels and put them in the refrigerator. The leaves will stay fresh for several hours.",
      "2. On each salad plate, arrange a loose bed of mache leaves (about 1 cup for each person). Sprinkle cubes of mango and cucumber round about over the leaves.",
      "2. With a large spoon, dribble vinaigrette over each salad and, if you like, sprinkle each salad with some pink peppercorns."

Here is where the gentleness comes in. Using a fork, slowly mix in the matzoh meal. Lightly stir in the matzoh meal until it is just combined. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and put it in the fridge for at least 1 hour.",
      "2. For the soup: Place 2 chicken thighs, 2 chicken legs and 2 chicken wings in the bottom of a very large stockpot. Pour enough water in the pot to cover the chicken completely. It should be about 4 cups, maybe more. This recipe is not an exact science when it comes to how much water you add in. Cover the pot and turn the heat to medium heat. Let the chicken boil in the water for about 30 minutes.",
      "3. After 30 minutes, use a slotted spoon to skim off the fat and cloudiness that has separated from the chicken. It will all be on the top, so don't stir before you skim-that will just make it harder on you. Do your best to get as much off as possible and discard it.",
      "4. Next, you want to add enough water to come almost to the top of the pot. It should be another 12 to 14 cups of water. Add in the celery, parsnips, onions and carrots that have been peeled and cut into smaller pieces. Also add the fresh parsley (you can leave it on the stem) and chicken bouillon granules. Put the top back on the soup pot and let it come back up to a boil. Once it is boiling, reduce the temperature to low and simmer for about 2 to 3 hours.",
      "5. After 2 to 3 hours, strain the soup through a strainer into another large pot. Set the broth aside and let the vegetables and chicken cool in the strainer until they are cool enough to work with. Using your hands or a pair of tongs, pull out the chicken and separate the meat from the bones and skin. Put the meat back into the broth. If you'd like, which I do, pull out the carrots, celery, parsnip, and some of the onions and put them back in the broth as well. I tend to leave out the parsley so it doesn't turn the broth green and I don't think the soup needs it. At this point, throw out everything you've discarded and set the soup aside until you're ready to cook the matzoh balls.",
      "6. To finish the matzoh balls: Using a tablespoon measure or a soup spoon, scoop out some of the mixture and put it on your fingertips. Pass the ball between your fingers 3 times to roll it into a ball (I've found that 3 times is the magic number) and then set the ball on a plate and repeat with the remaining matzoh ball mixture.",
      "7. Bring the soup back up to a boil and gently place the matzoh balls in. Reduce the heat to medium and let the balls cook on a gentle boil for at least an hour with the cover on the pot.",
      "8. Serve up and enjoy!"

Cut the dough ball in half and roll each loaf out to about 12 inches long in the shape of French bread. Cut three small slices on top of the bread (this is optional) and place loaves on a greased baking sheet (just spray evenly with Pam).

If you are using yeast from a jar, give your jar a good shake and then measure out 2 1/4 teaspoons of yeast for this recipe. Also, you just need to use table salt for this recipe. Kosher salt granules will be a little too large to use here.",

      "In a medium bowl, combine the flour, baking powder and salt; stir with a fork to blend.",
      "In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream together the butter and sugar on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, 3-5 minutes. Blend in the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition and scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed. Beat in the lime zest, lime juice and vanilla. With the mixer on low speed, mix in the dry ingredients in three additions alternating with the buttermilk, beginning and ending with the dry ingredients. Beat each addition just until incorporated. Batter will be fairly thick.",
      "Divide the batter between the prepared cupcake liners, filling each about 3/4 full. Bake 12-15 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Let cool in the pan for a few minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely before frosting.",
      "For the frosting: Whip the butter in the bowl of an electric mixer, or with a hand mixer, for several minutes. You want to get it very light and fluffy. Slowly add the powdered sugar, a few tablespoons at a time (this will keep the mixture from getting grainy). When the mixture is in small crumbs add the zest and the 1/4 cup of margarita mixer. Blend until smooth. (Add additional drops of margarita mixer if more liquid is needed to reach a frosting consistency). **If you would like to add tequila to the cupcakes, you can substitute it for the margarita mix or you can brush it on the baked cupcakes before adding frosting. Frost or pipe frosting onto cooled cupcakes. Garnish with additional lime zest, sprinkles and/or lime slices as desired."

      "Margaritas are not my favorite drinks, although I can tolerate them - especially raspberry ones. Let's just say that Jose is not always a good friend to me. However, I do love lime. I also love Cinco de Mayo, and baking things with a theme. So this year, I decided to bake Margarita-flavored cupcakes in honor of the 5th of May.",
      "I found the base for my recipe on the Hostess With the Mostess site, and modified it from there. I also switched the icing. Although I'm sure the cream cheese icing would be delicious, I happened to have a full fridge and nowhere to store them overnight, so I went with a lime buttercream frosting, which came out great.",
      "The recipe itself is extremely simple, you only need a few things for the cake: a white cake box mix plus the ingredients necessary to make it (i.e. oil and eggs): about 3 limes (more if you are using key limes); margarita mix (the liquid kind, not the frozen concentrated kind, I used Jose Cuervo Margarita Mix in Classic Lime); tequila; orange liquor (I used Triple Sec because my liquor store didn't have Grand Marnier, and it still tasted great). And for the icing, the only extra ingredients are butter and confectioner's sugar.",
      "1. Combine all liquors and margarita mix into your mixing bowl and swirl it around to combine",
      "2. Add the box cake mix, egg whites, vegetable oil and the zest to the mixing bowl and combine with the liquor/margarita mix. Beat with a mixer until combined and smooth, about 1-2 minutes",
      "3. Divide amongst 24 cupcake wells, filling about 2/3 full",
      "4. Bake at 350F for about 18-20, until toothpick inserted in center is clean, and/or they spring back when touched",
      "5. For the icing, beat 2 sticks of butter until light and fluffy.",
      "6. Add the juice, zest, and margarita mix, and beat to combine",
      "7. Add the powdered sugar gradually, until desired spreading consistency is reached",
      "8. Frost when the cupcakes are completely cooled, and enjoy!",
      "I didn't put a thick layer of icing on, because my icing was delicious but potent. Anywhere from 1/4\" to 1/2\" is all you need, but taste test it first.",
      "Now, I love lime, so my icing had a very strong lime flavor. However, you can always cut down on the lime juice, or omit the margarita mix altogether. If the cake is enough of a margarita-flavor for you, a basic buttercream icing with just the zest would work nicely.",
      "I chose to roll the edges in colored sugar as a garnish, to resemble the salt around the rim of a margarita. If I had more time, I would have loved to garnish with candied lime peel or candied lime slices, but alas, the clock is always against me. Maybe next time...",
      "I have to say, given that I'm not normally a margarita fan, I really enjoyed these cupcakes. The cake itself is super yummy, which is highly unusual for my tastebuds for anything containing tequila. They have a little tang, and they really do taste like margaritas as opposed to just lime cupcakes masquerading as margarita cupcakes. I also used someone who never drinks margaritas (because she hates tequila) as one of my taste testers, and even she really liked them. Having said that, these cupcakes do have a bit of a bite, I wouldn't eat them too early in the day, they are definitely an after-lunch or after-dinner treat!"

      "While grilling your meat or other items on the grill over direct heat, put your bread over indirect heat cooking each side until char marks form. You can put the Texas toast on direct heat (directly above the coals or gas burner) but you will need to watch it very carefully to ensure the pieces do not burn, no more than a minute a side. The Texas Toast is done when the bread starts to get slight grill marks and butter turns golden brown.",
      "The Texas Toast pieces can also be baked in an oven preheated to 350 degrees F until the bread/butter turn golden brown.",
      "For preparing the Basil Compound Butter:",
      "A compound butter is simply butter whipped together with your favorite ingredients. Get creative and use your own herb/ingredient combination to complement your meal!",
      "Let the butter come to room temperature. DO NOT melt it in the microwave, it will change the texture of the butter. Combine butter and the rest of the ingredients in a food processor and pulse to puree the ingredients. Put it into an easy to access container and store in the refrigerator.",

      "When the cakes are cool, take a small sharp knife and make a circular incision in the middle of the top of the cakes about an inch wide pointing the knife at an angle towards the centre of the cake. You are basically cutting out a portion of the top of the cake, so you can fill it with the ganache. Once you've completed the circle you can pull the centre out and you should have a little piece of cone-shaped sponge. Now cut the tips off all of these cones leaving just the top which will go on top of the cake after filled, to work as a plug. Fill the gap in the cake with the ganache (using a piping bag or a Ziplock bag with the corner cut off) and place the plug back on the top of the cakes.",

Cook, flipping occasionally, until chicken is well-browned on both sides and cooked through, about 10-12 minutes, or until the inside reaches 160\u00b0F. Once cooked through, remove from the pan and let cool. Then, dice into bite-sized cubes.",
      "To make the honey mustard salad dressing, in a small bowl, combine yogurt, mustard, raw honey, and freshly squeezed lemon juice. Whisk until very smooth.",
      "To assemble the mason jar salads, start with the dressing at the bottom. This will keep it as far away from the lettuce as possible and will allow us to add in other items later that can avoid getting mushy. You can add about 1-4 tablespoons of the dressing, depending on how much you prefer and how many other ingredients you're going to add.",
      "Follow the dressing layer with grape tomatoes, followed by the diced chicken breast. In the next layer, add cucumber, followed by sliced almonds. Top this layer with the crumbled goat cheese. Finally, for the remainder of the jar and always on top, add as much baby greens as you can squeeze into the jar.",
      "When you're ready to eat your salad, just unscrew the cap and shake the contents out into a bowl. Everything gets pretty compacted in the jar, so some vigorous shaking might be needed. This shaking also helps to toss the salad ingredients with the dressing. Once the salad is in the bowl, you can toss it some more with your fork to make sure everything is evenly coated.",
      "With the lid sealed tightly and packed like I showed you, mason jar salads last 4-5 days in the fridge and are perfect for grab-and-go lunches or dinners during the week."

      "First make sure your basil is washed and trimmed so you only have the leaves. Pat the leaves dry with a paper towel and set to the side. I like to try and practice mise en place which is French for \"everything in place.\" It might make a little more work or an extra dirty dish or two but when everything is measured out, sliced up and ready to go then you just get to have fun and create! It keeps everything organized and will make it so that your cooking experience has a nice flow to it because everything is in place! Mise en Place!!",
      "Next thing you need to do is slice up your cheese. You want it about .5\" thick. You want something sturdy enough to hold the tomato and avocado and thick enough to taste all the wonderful smokey flavor. But this is personal preference so if you find you like it thinner then by all means slice it that way!",
      "Now slice up your Roma tomatoes - with the same thickness as your cheese, about 5\" to 1\" thick. Do the same thing with your avocados.",
      "Place the cheese on a serving platter or plate. Place a tomato slice on top of each slice of cheese. Then top each tomato slice with a slice or chunk of avocado. Once this is done you want to do a sprinkle of salt and pepper over the top of your salads!",
      "Once you have salt and peppered the salads it is time to top with a basil leaf. For the finale you are going to drizzle on some balsamic vinegar! My bottle did not do the drizzle I had hoped for so it was more of a dumping of vinegar! But that is OK - I just tipped the plate into the sink to drain out the excess vinegar. So if your drizzle experience does not go as planned c'est la vie!",
      "To serve I toasted up a couple of pieces of French bread and cut them into bite size pieces and drizzled on a little olive oil and put those on a plate next to the California Caprese Salads. It was lovely having that toasted crusty bread to soak up the balsamic. It complemented the Caprese very well! I hope you try my version of this classic salad and let me know what you think! I promise you are going to love it!"

If you are using store bought, evenly sprinkle two pinches of sea salt on the parchment paper before you lay the dough into the tart pan. The extra salt adds another layer of flavor and really brings out the chocolate and pecan flavors.",
      "You will need: a 9 inch tart pan with a removable bottom, parchment paper, foil, and pie weights or dried beans.",

      "Add rice to the Dutch oven and stir almost constantly (so the rice doesn't stick to the pan) for 2 to 3 minutes. Pour the wine into the rice, and bring up the heat a little at a time so the mixture bubbles just slightly. Stir until the wine has absorbed/evaporated.",
      "Add one ladle or cup full of warm stock to the rice, then stir almost constantly (at least every 30 seconds) until almost all the liquid has absorbed. It's most important to stir when almost all the liquid has absorbed, to prevent rice from sticking to the pan. Once the liquid has mostly absorbed, add another ladle or cup of stock to the rice, and repeat the absorption process. Continue in this manner, adding more liquid and adjusting the heat as needed to maintain a little bubbling.",
      "After adding about 3 cups of stock, start tasting the rice for doneness before adding more liquid. The risotto should be soft, but not mushy-slightly al dente, similar to a good restaurant risotto, if you've had one. I used 4.5 cups of stock added over 25 minutes.",
      "When the liquid is absorbed and the rice is the desired texture, add another 1/4 cup of the stock to the rice, stir to incorporate, then turn off the heat before the liquid has a chance to absorb. This will keep the risotto creamy when adding volume via the potatoes and bacon later.",
      "Stir in the sour cream, grated cheese, and salt and pepper. Start with 1 teaspoon of salt and 1/4 teaspoon of pepper, taste, and adjust if needed. Fold in all but a few of the sweet potatoes and bacon pieces, trying not to smash the potatoes.",

      "There are two types of mashed potatoes I make, one is a roasted garlic and the other is a \"loaded\" mashed potato.",
      "Typically, I make both types with a 5-pound bag of potatoes (Idaho regular potatoes).",
      "Peel and cut potatoes in quarters. Boil with salt in water.",
      "Once soft, drain and mash with an electric hand mixer (this gives it a smooth consistency rather than using a masher). Add one stick of butter (sometimes I use 1 1/2 sticks). Add one tub (8 0z.) of sour cream, milk and chicken stock. (I usually don't measure, so just use a little less or a little more of the liquids to reach your desired consistency.) Mix more with the hand blender.",
      "Once the potatoes are at the desired consistency, use a spatula. Don't over-mix, or it will turn more liquid.",
      "Season with salt and pepper to your liking.",
      "At this point, I separate potatoes into two mixing bowls, one for each variety.",
      "For the roasted garlic variety, roast approximately 4 heads of garlic in the oven for about an hour at 375F with olive oil, salt and pepper. Once done, gather all the roasted garlic out of the bulbs, mash them a little, and dump the roasted garlic (including the oil) into the mashed potato mixture.",
      "For the \"loaded\" variety, cut about 6 to 8 strips of bacon into little strips (or more if you you wish) and saute them till golden brown. Drain and put to the side. Cut up fresh chives and grate cheddar cheese. Then add the bacon, chives, and cheddar cheese to the mashed potato mixture. Garnish with more cheddar on top."

      "1. In a large saucepan, combine the chicken broth, carrots, celery, potatoes and onion. Bring the mixture to a boil, cover and simmer for 10 minutes, until the vegetables are starting to get tender.",
      "2. Add the chopped broccoli. Cover and simmer for another 10 minutes. The pan is going to be very full of vegetables and it might seem like it isn't \"soupy\" enough since the vegetables overpower the broth but I promise it will all work out when you add the cheese mixture.",
      "3. In a separate medium saucepan, saute the bacon until golden and crisp. Remove the bacon to a paper towel-lined plate. Drain the grease and wipe out the saucepan.",
      "4. Melt the butter (in the same saucepan you cooked the bacon in) over medium heat. Whisk in the flour and cook for 1-2 minutes until golden, stirring constantly. Gradually whisk in the milk and cook until the mixture is bubbling and is slightly thickened, 5-7 minutes.",
      "5. Stir in the cheddar cheese one handful at a time, adding another handful after the cheese that has been added has melted. Stir in the salt, pepper and dry mustard.",
      "6. Slowly stir the cheese sauce into the hot broth and vegetables, whisking to combine well. Stir in the reserved bacon and add additional salt and pepper to taste, if needed. If you want the soup a bit thinner, stir in a little extra broth or milk a bit at a time until you get the consistency you are looking for.",
      "Note: Recipe adapted from a recipe my sister-in-law, Melissa, sent me by way of her friend Meredith. I made a ton of changes: decreased butter from 8 tablespoons to 3, increased liquid and used broth instead of water, used real cheese instead of Velveeta and changed up the quantities of vegetables, to name a few."

      "Prepare potatoes: peel and cube sweet potatoes, then add to a microwave safe bowl. Microwave on high power for about 10 minutes or until fork tender, tossing 2-3 times during cook time. If you do not want to use the microwave, throw the potatoes on a baking sheet with a drizzle of olive oil, salt and pepper (you can omit/add less salt and pepper later if this is the case) and roast at 400\u00b0F for about 35 minutes. Using the microwave will help this soup come together in 30 minutes. Roasting the sweet potatoes adds a bit more \"caramely,\" deep flavor.",

Stir in garlic and cook for 1 minute more, then add flour and whisk continuously to create a roux with the onions. Cook the onion roux for about 2-3 minutes, until it starts to turn golden in color a bit and smell nutty. Add in stock, milk, smoked paprika and potatoes, then bring to a boil. Simmer for 15-20 minutes over medium heat, stirring often, especially scraping the bottom. The potatoes will begin to break down at this time-if they are not as broken down as you'd like, mash a bit more with a fork. Turn heat down to low and add salt and pepper. Taste and adjust seasonings according to preference. If you'd prefer a thinner soup, add more stock to thin it out. You can also throw the soup in the blender to make it super creamy.",
      "Serve hot with garnishes of crumbled bacon, mascarpone cheese, goat cheese, and crisped shallots. Makes about 4 servings but it easily multiplied.",
      "Note: to crisp the shallots, slice 2 whole shallots very thinly, add a little canola oil over medium-high heat, and once hot add the shallots. Cook them for about 2 minutes, then remove with a slotted spoon and let drain on a paper towel. So good."
