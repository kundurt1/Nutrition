While we took the trouble to grow our own (blue) corn, I see no reason why one could not start with good ol' yellow corn from the grocery store (domestic 20-row?) In fact, I plan on doing this if only to see what kind of chicha it makes.",
      "Specifics: OG: 1.055 FG: 1.012 Types of Chicha So far, there appear to me to be several main ways in which chicha de jora is made. These range in difficulty from trivial to a process almost indentical to what barley-beer homebrewers are familiar with.",
      "Facil (easy) - Corn is mixed with water and sugar and allowed to sit for several days until the corn begins to germinate. The sugar ferments and the corn, lending nothing fermentable, adds flavor.",
      "Abbreviated - The jora is mashed but the mash is ultimately brought to a boil, allowed to settle, and the clear liquid, or upi, now finished chicha, is drawn off.",
      "Traditional - Similiar to the Abbreviated method, but the jora is mashed and the mash is allowed to settle. The upi is drawn off the mash into a separate vessel for boiling.",
      "Modern - The ground jora is mashed and lautered through some sort of filtering device such as a manifold or false bottom.",
      "This process is helped by the inclusion of some crushed malted barley (Barley Assisted). The first is apparently how much chicha is made in people's kitchens.",
      "Bill Ridgely describes most of the others in his articles.",
      "Also note that the methods that include mashing use a batch sparge. That is, the sweet liquor (upi) is merely drained from the mash and there are no continuous additions of sparge water to the surface of the mash.",
      "Certainly sparging can be performed if desired, but it is neither traditional nor necessary (corn kernels have no husk and therefore do not form a filterbed). Chicha is traditionally allowed to spontaneously ferment. For the last type (Modern), George Duarte suggests that ground, unmalted corn could be mixed with a small amount of crushed 2-row malted barley and boiled for 20 minutes or so to gelatinize the starch in the corn.",
      "This gooey mass would then be added to more water and barley malt and mashed as per 'normal' homebrew procedures.",
      "This could probably be sparged as usual."

Pour the warm dressing with the oranges over the spinach and toss gently to wilt. Remove the chicken from the oven and serve it immediately with the salad and orange wedges."

The water in kernels is what causes popcorn to pop, so all you need to do is re-hydrate the dried kernels. David Woodside, author of What Makes Popcorn Pop? suggests filling \"a one-quart jar three-quarters full of popcorn and adding one tablespoon of water. Cover the jar with an airtight lid and give it a few good shakes every few minutes until the popcorn has absorbed all the water. Store the jar in a cool place.\" Woodside says in two or three days you can test-pop a batch of kernels. If you still get old maids, add a few more drops of water to the jar, shake it, and let it sit for a few more days."

      "Make sure you wear disposable rubber gloves to prepare the jalapenos. Rinse jalapenos, cut off stems, cut in half lengthwise and remove the seeds and ribs. I seed the jalapenos under water in a large bowl of cold water to keep the peppers from spraying on my skin or in my eyes. I chopped the jalapeno peppers and the bell peppers in a food processor a few at a time. (Some like to chop the entire jalapeno including the seeds, to make it hotter, but I find the seeds do not chop very well. If you don't mind the seeds this is a much simpler way to make it hotter and to prepare the jalapenos.).",
      "Optional method if you like hotter spicier jelly and don't want seeds in the jelly; try this method: Place all the seeds and ribs from the jalapenos in the pan you will be making the jelly inches Add the cider vinegar, cover and simmer for about 30 minutes, strain the vinegar to use for the jelly and discarded the seeds and ribs. I prefer not so spicy, but my husbands loves it and I'm always trying to find ways to make it spicier (I even used a few habenero peppers in a batch) !",
      "In a large pan, add finely chopped jalapenos, finely chopped red, green and/or yellow peppers (remember bell peppers are optional. I like them because they add color and tone down the spiciness), and cider vinegar. Bring to a simmer, add food coloring (opt) and stir in 2 pkgs. Sure-Jell (VERY IMPORTANT to use the \"No sugar needed\" style, in the pink box) to the peppers. Turn heat to med/high and bring to a full rolling boil (a boil you can not stir down) and boil exactly one minute. Remove from heat and stir in Truvia Sweetener.",

Place hot lid on top and screw ring on snugly, but not real tight. You want to allow air to escape for better sealing.",

Reduce heat to a gentle boil, cover, and process for 5 minutes. When processed, carefully remove jars from water using tongs or a jar-lifter. Place upside-down on a rack or thick towels, and let cool without moving for 12-24 hours. Jars will make popping sounds while cooling if sealed. Remove ring, wipe jars with a clean damp towel, put ring back on and store in your pantry until ready to use.",
