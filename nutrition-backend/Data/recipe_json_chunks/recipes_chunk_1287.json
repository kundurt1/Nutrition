      "4. In a small bowl, mix 1 1/2 cups water with remaining 3 teaspoons sugar and juice of another lemon. Taste and, if necessary, add more sugar or lemon juice so mixture is both sweet and sour. Pour over Swiss chard and bring to a boil. Cook partially covered until chard begins to wilt, 3 to 5 minutes. Add 1/2 cup water if pan is very wide and there is little liquid on bottom. Poke handle of a wooden spoon into mixture in three places, making holes to let steam rise through chard. Cover, reduce heat to very low, and cook until rice is tender, about 30 minutes. Remove from heat and let rest for 15 minutes. Just before serving, sprinkle with remaining lemon juice and remaining fresh mint."

      "Preheat oven to 500\u00b0. Cut up chicken into separate pieces making 8 pieces in all. I never use the back as I simmer that for broth to freeze for other purposes or it becomes dinner for my dogs. :) Drizzle 1 T. of the olive oil on the bottom of a very large baking/roasting pan (I use a 12 x 15 stainless steel metal pan). I do not recommend glass/ceramic wre for such high temperature cooking. If you don't yet have a really large, good quality stainless steel roasting pan, I think it is one of the single most important investments you can make in your cooking tools. Place chicken skin side up in the pan. You don't want any overlapping or crowding. I do not recommend using a glass or ceramic baking dish at the very high temperature called for in this recipe. Glass can be unpredictable, can even break, above 450\u00b0. Crowding of this chicken and the surrounding veggies will result in deeper pan juices around them and that will impede crisping of the chicken. Place tomato wedges around and in between chicken pieces. Do the same with the onion pieces and add the garlic. If using the root vegetables, cut them up and place them evenly around the chicken. Squeeze the lemon over everything in the pan. Drizzle remaining olive oil over the pan contents as well. Lightly sprinkle some oregano over all (about 1/4-1/2 tsp, I don't measure it). Bake 30 minutes at 500\u00b0. Baste with pan juices, lower heat to 350\u00b0 and bake another 20 minutes or to internal temperature of the chicken is 170\u00b0 on a meat thermometer. Baste with pan juices just before serving if desired. I like to place the juices in a gravy boat and have it on the table for basting the drier breast meat."

Add salt and pepper to taste, then toss to fully coat. Roast in the oven for 20 minutes, tossing once halfway through. Once cooked, remove from heat and let cool for about 5 minutes.",
      "2.While the eggplant is in the oven, cook the amaranth. Combine the amaranth and vegetable broth in a small pot and cover. Bring it to a boil, then reduce to a simmer and crack the lid just a hair. Let simmer until liquid has cooked away, about 10-15 minutes. Fluff with a fork and set aside.",
      "3.Also while the eggplant is in the oven, cook the onion and garlic. In a small frying pan, heat the olive oil over medium heat for about one minute. Add the onions and garlic and saute until onion is translucent. Remove from heat.",
      "4.Combine the eggplant, onion & garlic, along with all of the spices, nutritional yeast, liquid smoke in a food processor. Pulse just a few times until it is broken up and mushy, but not pureed. You want it to still be a tad chunky.",
      "5.Add the eggplant mixture to the cooked amaranth and mix together. Divide the mixture into 4 equal parts and use a biscuit cutter to form into patties on the baking sheet that you used to cook the eggplant (you can use the same parchment paper too). Bake the patties in the oven for about 35-40 minutes, flipping once halfway through.",
      "6.Once they are baked, you can pan fry them on each side for a few minutes to \"brown\" them and make them a little firmer. Just lightly spray the pan with a little bit of olive oil and cook the patties on each side for 3-4 minutes over medium heat. You could possibly try grilling them at this point, but I have not tried that.",
      "7.Now you can make the burgers. Add whatever burger fixings you want, but I recommend spreading some Sriracha Tahini Sauce on either the top or the bottom half of the bun. Serve immediately."

      "WINE-MATCHING SUGGESTIONS Chicken plays demure understudy to challenging layers of the \"c\" spices (watch cardamom's balmy power), oriental garlic and ginger, while turbo-charged chilli confounds. The choice of chicken stock or coconut milk determines the match. Jordan's Blanc Fume delivers a balanced medley of tropical fruit and woodspice without clashing spiky thatch if you select the stock option; coconut cream calls for corresponding power that we found in L'Avenir's Chardonnay 2000 - generous peach, mellow oak and general gravitas offer a foil. Even for the chilli"

      "2 Put cream, 1 cup of the milk, the remaining half of the sugar, and the salt into a medium saucepan over medium heat. Scrape vanilla seeds from beans with the tip of a small knife into pan; add beans. Heat the mixture until just before it starts to simmer (do not let simmer). Remove mixture from heat and let stand 10 minutes.3 While the mixture is standing, prepare an ice water bath in a bowl large enough to set another bowl easily inside of it. Set aside.4 Whisk in 1 cup of the cream mixture in a slow stream into the yolk mixture to temper it. Add another cup of the cream mixture; continue to whisk. Transfer the egg yolk mixture back to the saucepan with the remaining cream, milk and vanilla. Cook over medium-high heat, stirring constantly, until it is thick enough to coat the back of a wooden spoon and an instant-read thermometer registers 180\u00b0, 5 to 7 minutes. (You can run your finger in a line over the back of the coated spoon. If the mixture doesn't run, but stays in place on the spoon, it should be thick enough.) Remove from heat and mix in the remaining 1/2 cup of milk to stop the mixture from overcooking.5 Pour custard through a medium-mesh sieve into a stainless steel bowl set in the ice-water bath. Let cool completely, stirring until completely chilled.",
      "6 Freeze custard in an ice cream maker according to manufacturer's instructions. (Take care not to over churn the ice cream or it will get a grainy texture.) If you serve the ice cream immediately, it will probably be pretty soft. Freeze it for at least an hour in an airtight plastic container to have a firmer texture. If it has been frozen for more than a day, you may need to let it sit at room temperature for a few minutes to soften before serving it."

Remove from heat and strain out the liquid using a fine strainer. (A gold-plated coffee filter works great.) Add the pat of butter to the still warm liquid and stir gently until it has completely dissolved. Whisk briskly to prevent the butter from seizing while you add 1 cup cream and 1 cup milk.
