Add 1/2 cup cooking oil, one of the cans of fruit (including juices), 2 tablespoons lemon juice and the appropriate icing color (red with cherry or raspberries, blue with blackberries or blueberries). You can add a little cinnamon and almond extract if you are using cherries. Use an electric mixer to blend for 2 minutes, scraping down the sides of the bowl a few times to be sure everything is mixed. The batter is thick, the fruit should be broken up, and the color should be intense.",
      "Coat the USA mold on the bottom and sides with cooking spray and pour the batter into it. Be careful to build up the batter in Florida and New England so that it is even with rest of USA. This batter is thick and won't level on its own.",
      "Place in a 1500 watt (= 1.5kw) microwave with turntable and cook for 16 minutes at 70% heat. When finished, open the door of the microwave to check it. Cake should be firm but somewhat tacky on top. Close door quickly and let it rest in the microwave oven for 10 minutes. Remove from oven and place pan on rack to cool. Cake will be fragile, and needs to stay in the pan for about 30 minutes more to firm up. Then carefully turn it from pan out onto a rack and leave to cool. Cake should be completely cooked through. When cool, cover with plastic wrap and freeze, if made in advance.",
      "Repeat with the other cake layer and ingredients, so you have 1 red layer and 1 blue layer.",
      "Move 1 carton of ice cream from the freezer into the refrigerator to soften. After about 1 hour, spoon it into the (now empty) USA mold packing it so there are no air spaces and it is level on top (again, watch out for Florida and New England and make sure they are completely filled). Cover with plastic wrap and press the wrap into the ice cream, making it is as level as possible. Be sure the plastic wrap covers without air pockets, and completely covers the edges, so no air gets in. Return to freezer.",
      "Assembling the cake: Remove cakes from freezer. Split each cake layer horizontally if you are making 2 cakes. If making 2 cakes, set aside 1/2 red layer and 1/2 blue layer for the other cake. Place the bottom cake layer on a serving plate. Remember-California is on the left and Florida/New England, etc, are on the right!",
      "Remove ice cream mold from freezer and take off plastic wrap. Place it in the sink with about 1 inch of very warm water for about 5 to 10 seconds, or until the ice cream separates from the sides of the mold. Work as quickly as possible from this point: The ice cream can then be placed on top of the cake layer sitting on the plate. (A simple way to do this is to place the bottom layer of cake back in the mold on top of the ice cream and turn both out onto a serving plate.) Place the contrasting colored cake layer on top of the rest of the cake. Adjust so the layers line up (check Florida and New England). Press down gently on top so they rest on top of one another. Wrap in plastic wrap and freeze.",
      "If you are going to make a second cake, repeat the mold/freezing process with the second carton of ice cream and then assemble the cake as above.",
      "Just before serving, decorate as desired.",
      "To serve: Place cake in refrigerator 1 hour before cutting so it's softened a bit. The ice cream will be still frozen, but easy to cut.",
      "The picture shows the undecorated cake made with half-layers. This cake is 4\" tall. I found that using the whole layers made a very tall cake (6\") that is difficult to serve. That's why I split both colors of cake in half, horizontally. I have the unfinished layers in the freezer and will make another cake for a friend whose birthday is also 7/4. These layers can remain frozen and used for another cake for Labor Day, Veteran's Day, or any other day you want to celebrate your nation!",

As soon as the water starts boiling, remove the pot from the heat and place a lid on it (I just move the pot over to a cold burner). Let the eggs sit in the water for about 30 minutes.

Remove from heat and add vanilla. Let cool and store in a glass jar. Use 2 Tablespoons of this to flavor the drink. Add this on top of the milk and ice and mix to combine.",

My original Williams-Sonoma recipe called for half-and-half plus heavy cream, but that was way too heavy for our tastes. You can use whichever ingredient you choose, but with the egg yolks also making it rich and creamy, even using all half-and-half was too rich for my taste. My happy medium became the 2 liters of half-and-half, plus 2 cups of whole milk. Go ahead and make it richer if you can handle it!",
      "Heat the cream over medium heat, being careful at all times to stir often and never let the cream burn, because who wants those yucky black bits in their ice cream?",

You may add the bean pieces to the cream to get the most flavor out of them; then you will need to strain the mixture after it steeps to remove the pieces. Bring the cream to a simmer, stirring often; then turn off the heat and let it sit and steep for 1/2 to 1 hour.",
      "Meanwhile, separate the egg yolks from the whites and whisk or beat the yolks until slightly thick. (You won't use the whites - save them for another recipe). Add the sugar to the pot of cream and stir until dissolved. Then whisk some of the cream mixture slowly into the egg yolks so they don't cook all at once. Then slowly whisk the yolk mixture into the pot, put it back on the heat and bring to a boil for a minute or two until thickened, stirring constantly. Patience is needed when making ice cream but you will be rewarded! After a minute or two, remove the pot from the heat.",

      "To make the dressing, mix together the sesame oil, rice vinegar, and 1/8 cup of the Lucky Trio Oil you prepared earlier. In a small bowl, dissolve the sugar in the hot water, then add the solution to the dressing. Stir the dressing very well, then toss it with the cucumber and peppers. Sprinkle the sesame seeds and goji berries into the mix, toss once more, and serve right away.",
      "If you're making this ahead of time, just chill the dressing and the salad ingredients separately. You can combine them right before you serve them."

      "Later, as you are sifting this with the other ingredients, if it becomes moist, just return it to the food processor and dust with a bit more flour and process a bit more.",
      "FOR THE CAKE",
      "This recipe makes 6 (4 inch) cakes or 1 (9 inch) cake.",
      "In a small saucepan over medium heat, melt the butter and continue to heat until it is light brown and smells nutty, about 8 minutes. Remove from the heat and strain into a small bowl.",
      "In a large bowl, sift together the confectioner's sugar, cake flour, pistachio flour and salt. (If the pistachio flour seems moist, and becomes difficult to sift, return it to the food processor, add a dusting of flour, pulse for a few seconds and continue to sift.) Whisk in the egg whites to combine. Whisk in the butter in a slow and steady stream. The batter will already start to feel thick. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and chill in the refrigerator to thicken some more, about an hour.",
      "Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F. Butter 6 mini tart tins or a 9 inch tart pan. (Both should have removable bottoms!)",
      "I used a large ice cream scoop to pour the batter into the tart tins. The batter is very thick at this point. Smooth the surface with an offset spatula if necessary. Sprinkle the berries on top being sure to keep a 1/2 inch border from the edge of the pan. Sprinkle the berries and the cake with the demerara sugar.",
      "Place the tart pan(s) on a baking sheet and bake until the cake(s) are golden and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with a few crumbs. NOTE: The original recipe calls for the 9 inch tart to be baked for 35-40 minutes; and for the mini cakes to be baked for 20-25 minutes, rotating the pan halfway through the baking process. But I found for the 6 mini cakes, my bake time was 37 minutes. The batter is very thick and wet and the strawberries on top may have contributed to a thicker, more wet center. So start with a shorter baking time and keep your eye on it, and continue to check with your toothpick.",
      "Transfer the cakes to a wire rack, and remove the outer ring to cool. Serve the cake warm or cool. Add a dusting of confectioner's sugar if desired. (It just makes it look so pretty!)",
      "The cake is best eaten the day it is made, but can be stored, loosely covered with plastic wrap, at room temperature for up to 2 days!"

    "title": "classic cherry pie",
    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F. Start by pitting the cherries. This part is messy, so be prepared. I think this step is why canned cherries became popular. But it's really not that bad, pretty easy to clean up, and definitely worth it. If you don't have a cherry pitter (like me), there is another way. First, put on an apron or an old shirt (seriously). Dump the cherries onto a cutting board. One at a time, use the flat side of a large knife to gently mash each cherry then set it aside. Do this to all the cherries. Then go through and remove the stems and pits, which should be nicely loosened and easy to pull out. After that, it's simple. Just dump the pitted cherries into a bowl, add the sugar, cornstarch, salt, extracts, and water, and mix well.",
      "Using your favorite pie shell recipe (I used The Perfect Pie Crust from the Pioneer Woman), layer a pastry into the bottom of a pie pan. Pour the cherries into the pie (juice and all) and dot the cherries with the butter. Roll out the top layer of pastry and place it on top of pie. Cut the extra dough off, seal the edges with a pinch or fork, and cut two slits (or a \"C\" for cherry) into the top to vent. As a garnish, I cut out two cherry shapes from the dough then rolled some more dough to make the stems and placed them on top. Then I beat an egg and brushed the top and edges of the pie with it to give it a nice golden brown color. To finish, I sprinkled some coarse sugar on top of the egg wash before putting it into the oven.",
      "Let bake for about 30-45 minutes, or until the crust is a nice golden color. You might want to put a foil-lined baking sheet on the bottom rack, just to be safe. Mine boiled over and now I have baking soda sprinkled on the bottom of my oven. Don't do that."

      "7. Once you're left with scraps, slide the scraps together and press together. I do this as opposed to rolling scraps into a ball and then flattening out again to avoid working the dough very much. Cut as many additional cakes out of the combined scraps as you can. You can do this once more, combining the scraps and cutting.

Drop a nut down into the cone to stop the batter from dripping out of the tip. Then fill your cones about 3/4 of the way full with the cupcake batter. Now you'll have to make this little contraption in order to ensure that your cones stay upright while they bake them. You'll need to buy some disposable cupcake pans. Snip holes in the bottom of each cupcake slot. Make the hole large enough so that the cones sit about half way down into the pan making sure they are secure and won't flop over. * Check out the related link to my blog to see step by step photos of this process.",

You can check to see if they are done by inserting a toothpick into the middle and making sure the pick comes out clean. Remove from oven and let cool. Once cool, trim down the part of the cupcake that bubbled past the top of the cone. That way, the cone will sit flat on the serving plate.",
      "4. Now it's time to decorate!! You can make your own frosting or you can use store bought. Put it in a piping bag and pipe some garland on your tree (see photo). Add a candy star for the top and add red hots and sugar pearls for ornaments. You can use any type of candy for decoration, you can be as creative as you want! After you admire your work, you can eat them which is the best part!!"

    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "1. Bake a Guinness cake by substituting Guinness for the water in a Devil's food cake mix, and including all of the other required ingredients to complete the cake mix. Just follow the directions on the box including cooking time (as a rough estimate - still do the toothpick test to be sure) but substitute the beer for the water that the mix typically requires.",
      "2. Let the cake cool completely. You can even freeze it if you are going to roll and dip the balls on a different day. In fact, I've found that the balls are much easier to form if the cake is cold.",
      "3. Chop up the chilled cake. Add a little less than half of the store-bought tub of icing to the cake and mix it in thoroughly. You can do this by a mixer or by hand. Then add the entire contents of a 50ml bottle of Bailey's into the mixture and combine. Ordinary cake balls use an entire tub of icing, but adding the Bailey's changes this because an entire tub of icing on top of the liquor would make the consistency of the cake mixture too 'loose'. Add additional icing in dollops until the mixture seems to be coming together into something firm enough to hold a ball shape. I think I ended up using around 3/4 of the tub by the time I was done.",
      "4. Roll or scoop the cake mixture into balls. Chill the balls in the freezer for about 30 minutes.",
      "5. Melt some chocolate or candy coating in the microwave for dipping. Microwave for about 1.5 to 2 minutes but make sure to stir every 30 seconds or so - in order to make sure the chocolate doesn't scorch. I normally thin it out with a little shortening, just a cap-full or so (I chose vanilla candy wafers for purely aesthetic reasons, the white on top of the dark looks like a pint of Guinness to me). Dip the cake balls into the chocolate, tap off the excess, place on a sheet of waxed paper and wait for them to set up. If they are nice and chilled, it won't take too long.",
      "6. If you want, drizzle some additional chocolate on the top in a decorative manner. I usually melt candy wafer (with slightly less shortening) and put it in a ziplock bag, snipping a tiny bit off of one corner of the bag. I use it like a decorator's bag, and chuck it when I am done. No mess, no clean-up of decorator's tips - easy. For these balls, I used white for the drizzle because I had my whole Guinness color scheme going on. But normally I drizzle on a contrasting color. It really helps distract the eye from imperfections in the dipping, trust me. I'm a horrible dipper, but drizzle on some extra chocolate and add some decorations, and the cake balls look great!",
      "Remember, almost every step of this process is fungible, and there are tons of variations. I even toyed with the idea of injecting each ball with a Bailey's and Whiskey ganache. I think I might try that next time, a cake ball version of Smitten Kitchen's amazing looking cupcakes. Actually, I'd love to try the cupcakes themselves sometime.",

If you are going to use ganache in place of the frosting, put it into a mixing bowl, and mix it (with the whisk attachment if you have it, although the paddle will do) on medium until fluffy.

      "2. Stir until the chocolate melts. Add in the butter and whiskey. Let cool for about 10 minutes (stir occasionally), and then whisk in the Bailey's.",
      "3. You need some special equipment for this because if you want to actually fill the balls, you need to inject them. The best thing would be a heat-resistant metal baster with the injection tip that you can thread on the end, because the ganache has to be warm enough to still be liquified. If you were filling cupcakes, you would cool it until much thicker, as per Smitten Kitchen's original directions. Fill the baster with the ganache and attach the injector tip. Plunge the tip in to the center of each undipped cake ball, squeeze out some ganache, and repeat. The you can dip the cake balls.",

      "3. When it looks spreadable, add the Bailey's. Then you can combine with the cake (at the point where I used the tub of frosting above) to make the cake balls, but add it in dollops and combine, so the mixture doesn't get too loose!"

Turn off heat, cover the saucepan, and steep 30 minutes. Strain the apple water through a cheesecloth-lined sieve, wringing the cheesecloth to squeeze out all the liquid. Pour the liquid into a large measuring cup. You should have about 4 1/4 cups; if you don't, add enough water so that you do.",
      "2. Line a 9 by 9-inch casserole dish with parchment paper and brush the canola oil onto the paper.",
      "3. Combine the sugar, lemon juice, and 1 1/2 cups of the apple liquid in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil (giving the pan an occasional stir to help the sugar dissolve), then turn heat down and simmer until it reaches 240\u00b0F on a candy thermometer.",
      "4. When the sugar mixture is around 225\u00b0F, start heating the cornstarch mixture. Whisk together 1 cup cornstarch, cream of tartar, and remaining 2 3/4 cups of the apple liquid in a 5-quart pot. Once the mixture is fully whisked (and there are no lumps), turn heat on medium and bring to a boil, whisking constantly. Turn heat off once the mixture turns thick and gluey.",
      "5. Once the sugar mixture reaches 240\u00b0F, whisk it into the cornstarch mixture. Turn heat on medium and bring to a full boil, whisking constantly. Turn heat down to low and simmer 55 to 60 minutes, whisking every 5 to 8 minutes (when it's done, the mixture will be a deep caramel color and become very difficult to whisk).",
      "6. Whisk in the rose water and walnuts; pour into the prepared dish and spread evenly with an oiled spatula. Let the candy sit for 2 days or more (uncovered) at cool room temperature (do not put it in the fridge!). (The top should feel smooth and dry, not sticky at all. If it is still sticky, let it sit a bit longer-a couple days or so-until it doesn't feel sticky.)",
      "7. Remove the slab of candy from the dish, flip it over onto a piece of parchment paper so the bottom side is facing up, and let it sit for 2 days or more (uncovered) at room temperature, or until it feels smooth and dry (not sticky).",
      "8. Use an oiled knife to cut the candy into 45 bite-sized pieces by making 8 cuts in one direction and 4 cuts in the other direction (I recommend cleaning and re-oiling the knife after every cut). Again, let the candy sit for 2 days or more (uncovered) at room temperature.",
      "9. Combine the powdered sugar and the remaining 1/4 cup cornstarch in a medium bowl. Toss the candy in this mixture, and then serve. (Alternatively, once coated in the sugar mixture, the candy can be stored in an airtight container between layers of parchment paper for up to 3 or 4 weeks.)",

      "To make the red velvet whoopie pies, start by preheating the oven to 350 degrees F. Line baking sheets with silicone mats or parchment paper. (You will need around 2-4 baking sheets). Set aside until needed.",
      "Whisk together the flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, and salt in a medium bowl. Set aside.",
      "In the bowl of a stand mixer, beat together the butter and brown sugar until fluffy. Add the egg and beat until incorporated. Mix in the vanilla. With the mixer running on low speed, gradually add the flour mixture in 3 additions - alternating with buttermilk. Add the food coloring and mix until the batter is completely red. If needed, add more red food coloring (only adding a couple drops at a time).",
      "Place the batter into a pastry bag that is fitted with a large round top. Pipe 11/2-inch circles of the dough onto the prepared baking sheets, leaving at least 1-inch in between each whoopie pie.",
      "Bake the whoopie pies until set, about 8-10 minutes. Do not over bake. Remove from the oven and let the cookies rest on the baking sheets for a couple minutes. Then transfer cookies to a cooling rack to cool completely.",
      "While the whoopie pies are cooling, make the buttercream filling. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, cream together the cream cheese and butter. Add the confectioner's sugar in 2 additions, slowly mixing in between each addition. Mix in the vanilla and whisk until the frosting is smooth and creamy.",
      "To fill the whoopie pies, match up the rounds in equal sized pairs. Place each pair next to each other, with one of the shells top side down. Pipe a small round on the whoopie pie that is top side down. Top the filling with the other matching round, creating a sandwich.",
      "Place the green sprinkles in a small, shallow bowl. Roll the side edges of the whoopie pies in the green sprinkles so that the sprinkles stick to the buttercream.",
      "Serve and enjoy!",
      "These last about 3 days in a sealed container.",

Place the bowl over a pot of simmering water and whisk constantly (using a hand held mixer works best) until stiff peaks form, about 5 minutes.",
      "Add the cinnamon to the mixture and then transfer the bowl to a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment and whisk, gradually increasing the speed until the frosting becomes light and fluffy. This will take about 2 minutes.",
      "To assemble the cake, wrap the cakes in plastic wrap and place them in the freezer to firm up for about 10 minutes. Then if needed, slice off the round domes on the top of each cake. Using a large serrated knife cut each cake in half horizontally creating 4 total layers.",
      "Place one of cake layers on a cake stand or plate, bottom-side down. Place about 1/2 cup of frosting on top and spread evenly. Place another cake layer on top, flat side up. Repeat spreading the frosting over the top of this layer. Do the same with the remaining 2 cake layers.",
      "If you are frosting the cake like I did, which is just around the edges of the cake, place the remaining frosting in a piping bag fitted with an open star tip. Pipe around the seams of the cakes and then around the edge of the top.",
      "If you would like to frost the cake by fully covering it after stacking the cakes, use the remaining frosting to cover the sides and top of the cake.",

Once butter is melted, add the semisweet and unsweetened chocolate and stir often, until chocolate is melted and the mixture is smooth. Remove the bowl from the heat and let it stand, stirring occasionally, until cooled slightly but still warm. This should take about 5 minutes",
      "2. Sift together the flour, baking powder, and salt in a medium bowl. Set aside. Whip the eggs in the bowl of a heavy-duty stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. Whip on medium-high speed until the eggs are foamy and lightly thickened, about 30 seconds. Increase the speed to high and gradually add the sugar and then the vanilla. Whip until the eggs are very thick and pale yellow, about 3 minutes. Reduce the mixer speed to medium and beat in the tepid chocolate, making sure it is completely incorporated.",
      "3. Change to the paddle attachment and reduce the mixer speed to low. Gradually add the flour mixture. Mix until thoroughly combined. Remove the bowl from the mixer.",
      "4. Using a wooden spoon, stir in the chocolate chips, pecans, and walnuts, making sure the chunky ingredients are evenly distributed throughout the bowl. The dough will be somewhat soft. Chill the batter for at least 4 hours or overnight. The batter will resemble fudge.",
      "5. Using a 1-inch ice cream scoop, portion the batter onto a baking sheet that has been lined with parchment paper. Place the cookies about 1 1/2 inches apart. Bake the cookies at 350\u00b0F for 10-12 minutes if using a small ice cream scoop (1 1/2\") or 17-20 minutes if using a 2\" scoop. Do not overbake. Cool for 5 minutes on baking sheet before transfering to a cooling rack to cool completely.",

    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "***Before making this recipe, I recommend taking a look at my tips for making macarons, which can be found on the related blog link.",
      "Before starting, have the following equipment out and ready to use:",
      "*Handheld electric mixer",
      "*Rubber spatula",
      "*Piping bag fitted with 1/2-inch round tip",
      "*Baking pans",
      "*Parchment paper or silpat liners",
      "Step 1: Line 2 half sheet pans with parchment paper or silpat liners.",
      "Step 2: Fill a bowl with hot water from the faucet (it should be about 105F); put the eggs (in their shells) in water and let them sit until they come to room temperature. (Turn them over every few minutes so they can come up to temperature on both sides. They're ready when they don't feel hot or cold to the touch. You may need to add more hot water if they're not warming up fast enough.) Once the eggs are the right temperature, remove them from water and dry them off. Separate the yolks from the whites, measuring 2 1/2 ounces of egg whites (you don't need the yolks for this recipe - this should be just about 2 whole egg whites).",
      "Step 3: In a medium bowl, whisk or sift together the powdered sugar, almond meal, powdered white tea, and salt (or you can pulse it together a few times in a food processor).",
      "Step 4: Put egg whites in a medium bowl and use a handheld electric mixer to whip. When egg whites are foamy (this should only take a few seconds), gradually add superfine sugar while still beating. When you have stiff, glossy peaks, beat in the almond extract.",
      "Step 5: Use a rubber spatula to gently fold the powdered sugar/almond meal mixture into the egg whites. Only fold the batter in one direction by sliding the spatula into the center of the batter, then lifting it up and letting the batter fall back onto itself. It generally takes about 50 strokes to work the batter, but this number isn't as important as how the batter looks. The batter is ready to pipe when it has a smooth, shiny surface and flows like lava in one large ribbon off the spatula. Here is an easy way to see if the batter is ready: use a rubber spatula to lift and drop the batter onto itself; if the ribbon gradually disappears into the batter within 30 seconds, it's ready to go.",
      "Step 6: Pour the batter into a pastry bag fitted with a round tip (1/2 inch in diameter); hold piping bag straight (i.e., at a 90 degree angle) above baking sheet and pipe 1-inch circles onto the prepared sheet. (You should get about 40 macarons.) Leave about 1 inch between each macaron. Tap each tray a couple times on the countertop to help flatten out the macarons and get rid of any air bubbles. The macarons should not have points on top.",
      "Step 7: Let macarons sit at room temperature until they form a shell that's dry to the touch (this could take anywhere from 15 minutes to 2 hours or more, depending on the weather).",
      "Step 8: Once the macarons are dry to the touch, preheat oven to 300F; once up to temperature, place both trays in the oven at the same time and bake for 20-30 minutes, rotating trays once. Then remove from oven and let macarons cool completely on parchment paper or silpat liner before removing.",
      "Step 9: To fill the macarons, pair up similar sized cookies. Spoon preserves onto the bottom of one macaron, then place the matching macaron on top of filling. (Just a heads up, I usually fill my macarons with a bit less preserves than I would buttercream for 2 reasons: preserves have more liquid than buttercream and I don't want to make the cookies soggy; and, preserves tend to be much sweeter than buttercream.)"

      "I recommend using a food processor. If you are using a big one, simply drop in the crackers and pulse it until it is a fine, crumb consistency. If your food processor is smaller, you may want to crumble the crackers into smaller pieces using your hands and drop it into the processor, then pulse until fine. If you do not have a food processor, just put the crackers in a clean plastic bag, seal and place over a plate then crumble the crackers by rolling the bag over a thick mug until they are very fine.",
      "Put the prepared crumbs in a medium bowl and mix in the sugar and melted butter. Mix well.",
      "Pour half of the crumbs into 1 springform pan, and pour the rest into the other. Distribute the crumbs evenly in the bottom of the pans and press tightly. Refrigerate while you make the filling.",
      "The Filling:",
      "1. Since I use a standard sized electric mixer, I could only process half of each ingredient, which makes 1 batch of cheesecake. So mix 2 pounds of cream cheese, 1 cup granulated white sugar and 1/4 cup all-purpose flour. Beat until smooth at medium speed for a maximum of 2 minutes. Make sure your mixture is not clumpy, which may cause cracking. Over beating may also cause your cheesecake to crack when baked.",
      "2. Adding eggs. When adding your eggs, break each one first in a separate, small clean bowl. Just to make sure that it is a good egg, otherwise you could be wasting your first ingredients. Add in the five eggs one at a time. Mix well by beating as long as 30 seconds, but not more than that. If it is already well mixed before 30 seconds, that's OK - just stop. Scrape down the sides after each mix.",
      "3. Add 1/3 cup heavy whipping cream, 1 tablespoon (about 3 lemons worth) lemon zest and 1 teaspoon of vanilla. Mix well (about 1 minute or 2).",
      "4. Get the crusted springform pan from the refrigerator. Put it on top of a wider baking sheet (to catch its mess while baking). Pour into the first pan your cream cheese mixture. Level with a spatula. Set aside while preparing the next batch, which won't take long, otherwise put the first mixture back to the refrigerator.",
      "5. Repeat the steps for Filling from 1 to 4. And then fill the second crust.",
      "Baking and Preparing the Topping",
      "1. Position your bottom oven rack at least 7 inches away from the bottom. Bake your prepared cheesecake(s) for 20 minutes at 350F. If you are making only one, bake for 15 minutes.",
      "2. Reduce temperature to 250F. After 30 minutes, change the position of your cheesecake (move the one on top to the bottom and the bottom to the top). Continue baking up to 1 hour. Remove from oven. Your cheesecake may look moist and soft in the middle.",
      "3. Now prepare the sour cream topping. Combine all of sour cream, granulated white sugar, and vanilla extract. Mix well using a spatula. Divide the topping into two and spread it evenly over each warm cheesecake.",
      "4. Return to oven and bake for 20 more minutes, 15 if making only 1 batch.",
      "Storing your Cheesecake",
      "1. Let cool and refrigerate for 1 hour. Carefully remove the sides of the springform pan by pushing its bottom up. If you will serve this the next day, put it on a big plate then refrigerate uncovered. Do not cover this with plastic wrap. It will stick to your cheesecake and it will not look good. The same thing will happen using wax paper - so just leave it uncovered. Trust me!",
      "2. Return to refrigerator and serve the next day.",
      "3. For freezing: Repeat step 1 of cooling above. Remove bottom of pan and slide it to a bigger plate (bigger or same size as the bottom of springform pan), or a hard cardboard wrapped with aluminum foil. Freeze uncovered for 30 minutes. Then wrap with heavy duty aluminum foil, or if you have the regular kind, wrap it doubled. Do not freeze more than 1 month. The night before you are ready to serve it, pull it out to thaw overnight.",

I use a regular teaspoon (not a measuring spoon) and spoon the batter slightly to the back center on each mold. That seems to work well for me. The pizzelles take between 15-20 seconds to cook. When the steaming slows down, that's when I check to see if they're light golden brown. Don't walk away from the iron when they're cooking because they can go from golden brown to burnt very quickly. When cooked, remove to wire racks to cool completely. They crisp up more as they cool. Repeat until all of the batter has been cooked.",

      "NOTE: This recipe is designed for a 10-inch cast iron skillet, but it can also be made in a 10-inch cake pan or a 12-inch cast iron skillet. To make it in a cake pan, prepare the topping in a separate saucepan first, add it to your cake pan, and then continue with the recipe as usual. If you make it in a 12-inch skillet, it'll produce a thinner cake, may require an extra banana or two, and may take about 5 minutes less to bake. Because cast iron can vary, no matter what size of skillet you use, be sure to check the cake's doneness early and often. Start checking it around 20 minutes, with a toothpick inserted into various spots.",

      "Make the topping: In a 10-inch skillet (see note above about using different pan sizes), melt the butter over medium-high heat. Once the butter is melted, stir in the brown sugar, ground ginger, crystallized ginger and salt and simmer for 4 minutes whisking constantly. Be careful-hot sugar is no joke! After 4 minutes, remove the mixture from heat and add the bananas into the bottom of the pan, placing them as close together as possible and fitting in as many as you can. Set aside.",
      "Make the cake: In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder and salt. Add the oil and coconut milk and whisk like a crazy person for 1 minute. Add the egg and vanilla and whisk it in well. Pour the batter over the banana mixture, evening it out with a spatula.",
      "Bake at 350 F for 25-30 minutes or until it's lightly brown on top and a toothpick inserted in various parts of the cake comes out with just a few moist crumbs. Remove cake from the oven and let it cool in the pan for exactly 5 minutes. (Any more and it will harden in the pan, and any less and it might fall apart). Then run a knife around the edge of it and carefully (use oven mitts and hold both sides of the skillet) invert it onto a large serving platter (hold the plate on top of the skillet with the heels of your hands, enlist a spotter, and be careful-did I mention that hot sugar is no joke?).",
      "Make the coconut whipped cream: Using a spoon, remove the cold coconut solids from each can of coconut milk (save the coconut water for other uses). Place the coconut solids in a chilled bowl with the vanilla and powdered sugar. Whisk like the dickens with a chilled beater until it has a whipped cream-like consistency (this probably took over 10 minutes with my electric mixer, but it's worth it).",

Bake the crust for about 6 minutes and let it cool as you make your cheesecake filling.",

Add in the vanilla and beat until well incorporated, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed. Beat in the eggs one at a time, scraping down the bowl between each addition. Pour the filling into your crust.",

Check while baking periodically and put a pie shield (or strips of foil) around the top of your pan to protect the crust edges if they're getting too dark. Just don't let the shield/foil touch the crust-it's delicate and might crumble. When you pull the cheesecake out, you can use a sharp knife to score a circle around the top of the cheesecake about 1 inch inside the crust so that as it cools and chills/sinks, it won't pull the crust in too much. Don't worry if it's pretty, because you won't be able to see it in the finished product! Let cheesecake cool completely on a wire rack before chilling it in the fridge for at least 3 hours.",

Let this cool slightly while you make your whipped cream.",
      "Using an electric mixer, beat the heavy cream to stiff peaks (it helps to use a chilled bowl and whisk). Fold around 1/3 of this cream into the curd to lighten it, and then fold the rest in gently. Pour the mousse over the cheesecake and chill it to set.",
      "Top the cake with candied clementines and serve with fresh whipped cream (I whip up about a cup of cream with about 2-3 tablespoons of powdered sugar to make mine-it's a good use for leftover cake and is lovely with the cheesecake!)."

    "title": "challah (braided egg bread)",
    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "Makes 3 loaves.",
      "NOTE: This dough can be made either in a stand mixer with a dough hook attachment or by hand. I mostly make it by hand these days, after doing it in college so many times without a mixer. Both are equally easy and take the same amount of time.",
      "1. In a medium saucepan, combine the water, butter, sugar and salt. Heat over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the butter is mostly melted and the mixture reaches a temperature of 110-120\u00b0F. (It should feel like hot tap water on your finger.) If the butter isn't completely melted when it reaches this temperature, just remove the pan from the heat and continue stirring until the butter melts.",
      "2. In the bowl of a stand mixer or in a large mixing bowl, measure 7 cups of bread flour. Sprinkle the yeast over the flour and stir briefly to combine. If using a mixer, turn the mixer on low and slowly pour in the warm butter mixture, making sure to scrape out any bits of salt or sugar at the bottom of the pan. If making by hand, pour in a little of the butter mixture at a time, mixing with a sturdy wooden spoon between additions. In either case, mix just until the flour starts to moisten.",
      "3. Add 4 eggs, one at a time, mixing/stirring after each addition to combine. When all 4 of the eggs are added, the dough will seem slippery and wet. Adding about 1/4 cup at a time, gradually add in enough of the remaining 1 cup of flour to form a soft, slightly sticky dough. Go slowly and mix well after each addition! I usually don't have to add the whole cup of flour. To get the best texture possible, you want to add just enough flour. The dough should just start to pull away from the sides of the bowl, whether you're mixing by hand or with a mixer, when it's ready. Add the raisins here, if using. At this point, continue kneading (either with the dough hook or by hand..which I just do directly in the bowl) the dough for about 5 minutes. It should stick very slightly to your fingers when it's ready.",
      "4. Lightly oil the bottom and sides of another large mixing bowl. Turn dough into that bowl, turning to coat the sides of the dough with the oil. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and a kitchen towel. Place in a warm, draft-free area to rise until doubled in volume, about 45 minutes. (Or...use this trick: preheat your oven to 400\u00b0F for ONE minute, then turn off the oven. Place your bowl of dough in the turned OFF oven to rise.)",
      "5. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper. When the dough has doubled in volume, turn it out onto a very lightly floured work surface (it usually has just enough oil from the bowl to prevent any sticking). Divide the dough ball into 3 equal portions. If you have a kitchen scale, feel free to use it...but I always estimate and it turns out fine. No one will complain if one loaf is slightly bigger than the others. Set aside two portions, leaving one to work with.",
      "6. Ok. Time to braid. If you're doing a 3-braid, just divide the dough ball into 3 pieces, roll each piece into a long rope and braid it like you would braid hair. If you're doing a 6-braid, just follow these steps. Don't psych yourself out, it's simple, I swear. Divide your portion of dough into 6 equal portions. Now you want to make 6 ropes, each one about 12 inches long - give or take, this is not an exact science. You can roll them into ropes on the work surface, but I find it's easiest to let gravity do some work. I hold each dough portion up and gently stretch it and squeeze it so that I'm holding the rope lengthwise up and down. If something tears, don't worry! Just smush it up and start over.",
      "7. When you have 6 ropes, lay them all next to each other so the ends are pointing at you. Starting at the far ends, mush the ends together so they won't come apart while you're braiding. Scoot the ropes to the sides a little so you have 2 groups of three, with a wider space in the center.",
      "8. If it helps to think of numbers, pretend the ropes are numbered 1 thru 6 from left to right. Start with the rope all the way on the right, #6 - pick it up, and place it in the center gap, so that it's now #4.",
      "9. Now pick up the second rope from the left, #2, and place it all the way on the right, so that it's now #6.",
      "10. Pick up the first rope on the left, #1, and place it in the center gap, so that it's now #3.",
      "11. Pick up the second rope from the right, #5, and place it all the way on the left, so that it's now #1.",
      "12. Pick up the first rope on the right, #6, and place it in the center gap, so that it's now #4.",
      "13. Repeat...pick up the second rope from the left, #2, and place it all the way on the right, now #6...pick up the first rope on the left, #1, and place it in the center gap, now #3. Continue this process until your get to the end of the braid. Press the ends together to seal the braid. Place the completed braid on one of the baking sheets.",
      "14. Repeat the braiding process with the other 2 portions of dough. I usually fit 2 loaves on one sheet diagonally, and the other loaf by itself on one sheet. Cover loaves with kitchen towels and let rise in a warm, draft-free space until puffy and visibly larger, about 25 minutes. (You can use the oven trick again here, just make sure to take the loaves out before you preheat the oven to bake them!)",
      "15. Preheat oven to 375\u00b0F with racks in the upper-middle and lower-middle positions. Beat together the remaining 1 egg and the 1 Tablespoon of water. Brush loaves with egg wash. Bake challahs (actually plural in Hebrew would be challot, if we're going to get technical here) until they're golden brown and sound hollow when tapped, about 15-17 minutes total, switching the pans from top to bottom racks halfway through. You can let the loaves cool on a wire cooling rack if you want, but there are very few things that are better than warm challah, fresh from the oven.",
      "(Challah freezes very well. Just wrap a loaf tightly in plastic wrap, then freeze in a freezer-safe Ziploc bag.)",

When the chocolate is almost all melted, stir by hand until it is completely smooth. Then add the remaining 2 ounces of chopped chocolate and stir again until completely smooth. This will help to cool down the chocolate. Stir in the shortening until completely incorporated. This will help to thin out the chocolate a bit. Pour chocolate into medium size glass for dipping the pops into.",
      "To assemble the marshmallow pops:",
      "Stack 2 marshmallow hearts on top of each other and press a 6\" treat pop stick down through the center, stopping just before you go all the way through the other side. Repeat with remaining marshmallow hearts until all your pops are assembled.",
      "Dip each marshmallow pop down into the chocolate, leaving just a bit of the white marshmallow showing at the end with the stick. Lift up and gently tap excess chocolate off. Press top of heart into sprinkles of your choice, or just sprinkle the whole coating of chocolate.",
      "Set the chocolate dipped marshmallow pops upright in a glass and allow to completely set. If you're in a hurry, pop them into the refrigerator for a bit to speed up the process.",
      "If you want to give these as gifts, place a pop in a small cellophane treat bag and tie with a ribbon. Talk about a fun gift!!"

Do not skimp and buy the el-cheapo stuff. For the love of all that is good in this world, do not use bottled lime juice here. I understand that a good lime can be hard to find occasionally, but this is one instance where you're better off waiting than settling. The oils in the skin of the lime are crucial to the outcome of the drink. Tonic water is a matter of preference. I like Stirrings for a multitude of reasons: crisp, clean, quinine-centric taste and no high fructose corn syrup or aspartame. Use whichever tonic water flicks your Bic. And as for the cukes, use a nice, firm seedless variety with an edible skin. The skin of the cucumber stays in place for both visual and taste appeal here, so a thick, wax-coated number is going to be a giant sour clunker of a note in your symphonic cocktail."

This makes enough tangzhong for two recipes (two pans) of bread, so double the rest of the ingredients for 2 pans of bread.",

      "1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Lay parchment paper on a baking sheet. Turn a dinner plate upside down on the parchment paper and draw an outline around the plate with a pencil. Alternately, you can do the same with two smaller plates like I did for this.",
      "2. Use a handheld mixer and a large mixing bowl. Add the egg whites into the bowl and whip on high speed until they form stiff speaks.",
      "3. Slowly add in the sugar a bit at a time, all the while whipping. Once the sugar is fully incorporated it should be stiff and glossy. Fold in the cornstarch, vanilla and vinegar and whip on high for 4 more minutes.",
      "4. Spoon the meringue mixture into the circle(s) that you made on the parchment paper and smooth the meringue out. Make sure the sides of the disk are higher than the middle.",
      "5. Bake for 30 minutes at 350F and then drop the heat to 225 degrees F and cook for a further hour, or until the meringue looks slightly brown and stiff. Turn off the heat and let cool in the oven for a couple of hours.",
      "6. After that, remove the meringue from the oven and peel back the parchment paper from the meringue and serve the pavlovas with your desired filling.",
      "For the Vanilla Scented Strawberries:",
      "1. Add half of the strawberries to a blender with the icing sugar and vanilla. Puree until smooth. Push the puree through a fine sieve into a bowl and reserve the sauce.",
      "2. Add the whipped cream to the centre of the pavlova and top with the remaining strawberries. Top with the strawberry sauce and serve.",
      "For the Raspberry Compote:",
      "1. Stir the sugar and cornstarch and half the raspberries into a medium saucepan over medium-low heat. Add in the lemon juice and stir occasionally while bringing to a simmer. Once in a full simmer, remove from heat and add the rest of the raspberries in.",
      "2. Serve the pavlovas with the whipped cream and raspberry compote on top. Add the crushed pistachios over that.",
      "For the Whipped Cream:",
      "In a large bowl, whip cream with a handheld mixer until stiff peaks begin to form. Beat in vanilla and sugar until peaks form."
