      "A food processor and a clean coffee grinder make this much easier to produce. Grind the almonds in your coffee grinder. Combine all the dry ingredient in a food proecessor. Add the butter to food processor and combine with dry ingredients with a few pulses. Add the egg and egg yolk to food processor and combine in same manner. Using your spring form pan with the side wall attached, press some of the dough onto the bottom to form a crust, just like a pie. Start making little round balls of dough by rolling it between the palms of your hands (which I do hope you've washed by now). Make them an inch in diameter, and put a bead of dough balls around the edge of the bottom crust, pressing them against the walls of the spring form pan to make a continuous wall. Add about a tablespoon of water to the 2/3 cup of preserves, then mix the water and preserves (unless you're doing the apricot and lemon juice \"combo\") to make the preserves more spreadable, and heat for about fifteen seconds in microwave to make it more spreadable. The addition of moisture will also make the mixture less likely to become chewy when cooked in the oven. Spread the preserves over the dough in the bottom of the pan, but don't put any on the bead/crust/wall of dough around the sides. Make little strips of dough from the remaining dough (at least four), just like you were a kid rolling modeling clay between your palms. Flatten them slightly. Gently place the strips in a tic-tac-toe (or is that tic-tac-dough?) pattern over the top of the preserves. They should stretch from edge to edge of the preseves, leaving plenty of preserves visible. Put in a pre-heated oven at 350 degrees F for thirty to forty minutes. When the Lindzertorte is done, sprinkle some powdered sugar (using a fine metal strainer) over the top. This will cause the powdered sugar to stick to the lattice on the top and disappear into the hot preserves where it falls in between the crust or lattice."

Switch to the dough hook when it's possible and not too sticky, then add spoonfulls of the remaining flour until it becomes a soft dough. Either knead or use the dough hook on medium-low speed until smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes. Coer and let rest for 15 minutes. Bring the risen dough into a roughly rectangle shape and make the seams at each end by rolling the ends up and pinching a bit. Put this, seams side down, into a loaf pan and let rise for 45-60m in a warm draft-free place. Preheat oven to 375 and bake 35-45m. If you want, put a little butter on the top."

      "Preheat the oven to 300\u00b0 F. In a pie plate, combine the flour, salt, and pepper and stir with a whisk to blend. Set aside. Pat the chicken breasts dry. Place a breast inside a 1-gallon Ziploc bag (or between 2 large sheets of plastic wrap) and pound with a mallet until the breast is about 1/4-inch thick. Repeat with the second breast. Cut each flattened breast in half. Place the 4 portioned breast pieces on a large plate. Sprinkle each portion with equal amounts of marjoram, then spread equal amounts of country mustard on each of the breast pieces. Place a slice of ham on each breast portion, followed by a slice of swiss cheese. Roll up the breasts to form a roulade, or \"kiev,\" and dredge in flour. Place the kievs in the refrigerator to firm up for about an hour. Remove the kievs from the refrigerator 30 minutes prior to sauteing. When ready (the preparation will take about 20 to 30 minutes from this point on), place a large saute pan over medium heat and warm up the butter and olive oil. Place the kievs in the saute pan and brown evenly on all sides. It will take about 10 minutes until the kievs are a lovely golden brown. Place the kievs in an ovenproof baking dish and cover with foil. You will now prepare the sauce.",
      "After removing the kievs from the saute pan, keep the heat on medium and immediately add the white wine and scrape up all of the wonderful chicken bits. Then, add the hard cider. Add the apple cider, and stir well with a whisk. Add the mustard, then add the butter. Raise the heat so you have a nice, popping simmer going. Taste for seasoning and add pepper and/or salt as needed. Keep stirring the sauce, adjusting the heat as necessary, until it is reduced by about half and is unctuous and silky. Plate the kievs, and spoon the sauce over them. Serve the additional sauce in a gravy bowl.",

      "1. Set your oven to 225 degrees celsius (430F).",

      "4. Crush the garlic from above with a thick knife, turn it 90 degrees and split it heightwise (so you have cut through each the cloves)",

      "6. When the vegetables start to brown, thake the tray out and pour your tomato paste over the bones and vegetables. Put it back in the oven.",
      "7. After 15-20 mins, take the tray out. Transfer all the content of the tray to your stock pot.",
      "8. Deglace your tray with water and scrape off all the goodness that got stuck there during the roasting process. Transfer this to your pot.",
      "9. Put in your herbs. I use thyme and parsley. Do not forget the bay leaves.",
      "10. Pour water so it covers everything. Don't worry about the level of water. Putting too much only results in having to reduce a bit more later so it is not a big thing. It is important however that the water you put in is cold. Throw in your peppercorns.",
      "11. Put the lid on and heat up the water. This could take some time if you have a large pot. Once it starts to simmer, try to tune the simmering into a state where you have a few bubbles here and there.",
      "Once you get the simmering going to your liking you can leave the stock to tend to itself. Check it out every now and then and see that the simmering is to your liking.",
      "12. When done, pick up the bones with a tong and put them aside (you can use them to make a second batch with new vetegatbles, this is called remiage). Transfer the stock to a new container through a siv and throw the vegetables and hebs).",
      "For veal stock: Let the stock simmer for 6 to 10 hours and move to step 14. For demi glace, let it simmer for 12-14 hours.",
      "13. Clean the stock pot from any left over meat/vegetables and pour the liquid back in. Heat it up again and remove the lid. Reduce it down to about half. Now you want a lot more heat than during the simmering.",
      "14. Try to chill the stock as quickly as possible. If possible, fill your sink with ice cubes and but the stock in there. Stir the stock frequently but carefully. It is no disaster if you cannot chill it with ice so if you have to place to put the ice or didn't find any ice, skip this step. When cooled down, transfer the stock to smaller container. I usually keep them in 1-2 cup containers."

Stack the leaf halves, about 6 at a time, one on top of the other, and roll them into a tight log. Thinly slice the log crosswise; you will end up with long, slender shreds. When cutting the kale, you can't help notice how strong smelling and grassy it is (no wonder I love the smell of fresh-mowed grass in the summer). Dunk the shreds into the bowl of water to rinse off any grit, then scoop the shreds out and drain them in a colander. Repeat once or twice if the kale does not appear clean.",
      "Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Once the oil appears to shimmer, add the turmeric-smeared fillet to the skillet. The instant sizzle and sear will turn the salmon light brown on the underside, about 2 minutes. Turn it over and repeat with the second side, about 2 minutes. Transfer the fish to a plate. Add the garlic to the skillet and stir-fry it until light brown and aromatic, about 1 minute.",
      "Pour the vinegar-based spice slurry into the skillet and stir to mix with the garlic. Simmer, uncovered, stirring occasionally, about 2 minutes. The pungency will slap you in the face (in a good way-I promise) and the liquid will release all the browned bits of fish from the bottom of the skillet into the thin sauce.",
      "Add the kale shreds and stir to coat them evenly with the liquid. Pour 1/2 cup of water into the skillet and stir. Lower the heat to medium, cover the skillet, and stew the kale, stirring occasionally, until the shreds are tender when tested (and tasted, I hope), 5 to 8 minutes.",
      "Stir the coconut milk into the kale. Let the milk come to a boil uncovered. Add the seared salmon to the liquid, basting it to make sure it continues to poach. Cook, uncovered, scooping up the sauce and basting the fish occasionally, until it barely starts to flake, 3 to 5 minutes.",
      "Transfer the fish to a serving plate. Let the sauce boil, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until it thickens, 3 to 4 minutes. Pour the sauce over the salmon and serve.",
      "A stout bunch, dark green and spritely, Tuscan kale stands for the epitome of winter bravado. Even though it grows all through the year, we often associate kale with cold weather, that brightness among a sea of white, very much like the evergreen Christmas tree. Curly, ornamental (those tight bases of light purple leaves with a frizzy head of green), or Russian kale-all varieties work well for this recipe. Bursting with antioxidants, vitamins A and C, and iron, kale is a nutritional powerhouse among a sea of greens. Its tough leaves make it harder to cook than some greens, but with the right amount of moisture, it turns tender within about 5 minutes.",
      "To grind the chiles de arbol, pulverize them in a spice grinder (like a coffee grinder) until they are the texture of finely ground black pepper. The heat from freshly ground dried chiles is much more intense than preground cayenne.",
      "Before opening a can of coconut milk, shake it well to make sure the thick milk gets dispersed evenly. If the can sits around unopened, the thicker part usually floats to the top and congeals into a creamy mass. If shaking does nothing (usually if the can has been sitting in a cool spot, this will happen), then once you open the can, scrape the contents into a small bowl, and whisk the thicker milk with the wheylike separated liquid to create an evenly thick milk."

Add your seasonings, herbs and spices into it. After this is done, chop your green onions and mix into spice and seasoning bowl. Set aside. Open whole peeled can of tomatoes. Slice each tomato into quarters (4-slice ea.) and make sure the seeds do NOT become part of the pasta sauce. Chop your red pepper into fine pieces and toss into spice and seasoning bowl. Set the tomatoes and sliced mushrooms in a medium bowl. Add a splash of red wine on top of it. Add some flour and the can of evaporated milk. Stir until well blended, but still somewhat chunky. Add extra diced tomatoes if you like stronger and chunkier pasta sauce. Mix sauce with seasonings and herbs. Pour into saucepan on medium heat for 10 minutes, just so the flavors are well blended throughout. Stir persistently and slowly until your time is up. Remove from stove and cover with glass lid. Check on your pasta. If done, go ahead and strain, butter, cover and set aside. Next, insert 1 cheese cube into a good fair sized meatball from the Jimmy Deans' or regular ground beef meat. IMPORTANT!: Make sure all openings stuffed meat ball, are closed off well. Thus the cheese will not leak out. You can choose to pan-fry, deep-fry, or bake your meatballs. When your meatballs are complete, set upon pasta and top off with the homemade pasta sauce. Serve with any appropriate baked or toasted bread, a small side of black olives and a house salad. Enjoy!"
