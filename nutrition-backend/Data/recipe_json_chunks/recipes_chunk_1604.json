      "The Flora Buttery pudding can be prepared to this stage several hours in advance and cooked when needed. Place the dish in a roasting tray three-quarters filled with warm water and bake for 20-30 minutes until the pudding begins to set. Don't overcook it or the custard will scramble.",
      "Remove the pudding from the water bath, sprinkle it liberally with castor sugar and glaze under the grill on a medium heat or with a gas gun to a crunchy golden finish.",
      "When glazing, the sugar dissolves and caramelises, and you may find that the corners of the bread begin to burn. This helps the flavour, giving a bittersweet taste that mellows when it is eaten with the rich custard, which seeps out of the wonderful bread sponge when you cut into it. And if you'd like to be more extravagant, replace half the milk with whipping or double cream."

Just as long as you can but not longer than a day. \n\nBefore you start to cook boil your eggs. Fill your pot with cold water and add a healthy serving of salt and 5 of your eggs.",
      "When your beans are soaked put them in a blender with the water and ad 1-2 onions, 2-3 cloves of garlic, 1 raw egg, sea salt, maggi cube, tomato paste, oil, milk, a knob of butter and your dried crayfish. Blend on high speed for about 5 minutes. The paste should be smooth and not grainy when it is ready (normally this recipe contains a painfully long bean pealing - I do not do that and the taste is amazing).",
      "Meanwhile your blender is working hard with your beans start to prepare your mackerel. Take off the skin and shred the fish with your hands into smaller pieces. They can be chunky as well just make smaller pieces of the smoked fillet. \n\nCombine your blended beans with the fish well together. Remember the fish part is very important and where the taste is so if somehow you ended up with just too much of the bean mixture leave some out so the fish can be the main star here. It will pay of hugely when you will eat it since the taste will be a-maaaziiing. Yum yum can not wait myself. \nNow in your tin containers fill all of them up to the 3/4 and also slice up your eggs and distribute them evenly. \n\nBoil a kettle full of water.",
      "Now back each container well with your foil as you are packaging a gift. You will be steaming it close to boiling water and you do not want the water to get into your bean cake. Do so with all of the containers.\n\nPrepare the biggest pot you have and I hope you really have a big one since it will make it much easier for you. In the bottom of the pot add 2 empty container what will work as a barrier between the water and your containers full of your bean cake and then stack all your bean cakes in the pot. Add the hot water from your kettle and set to boil one more. Make your best so they are touching each other as little as possible as it will make them o steam faster. \nPut your pot on your stove on high heat and cover with a lid. Set a timer for every 20 minutes to top up your water (the smaller pot you have the more often you need to top up) and in total leave them there to steam for 1,5 hours (the smaller container you use the faster it is done). But 1,5 hours should ensure that your bean cakes will be ready.",
      "After 1,5 hours and at least 5 water top-ups place your bean cakes on a plate to cool (you can put them in cold water if you want to speed it up but not so you get your water into your container!). \n\nYour bean cake is ready. Eat is as it is or sprinkle it with sea salt or add it on your bread or slice it to accompany your food. You can eat it hot or cold but I prefer it hot (do not heat it in the foil container but remove it from the packaging before). \n\nEnjoy."

Refrigerate overnight and the rolls will rise while you sleep, so you can bake as soon as the oven is warm.\nOr if you'd like to have the luxury of eating them whenever the mood strikes, consider making a batch or two and freezing them after baking and cooling. (Freeze the frosting separately.) Pack in an airtight plastic container. When you crave one, wrap it in aluminum foil and bake it in a preheated 250\u00b0F oven for 20 to 25 minutes, or until it is warmed through.\n\nEVEN BETTER: Make the dough following the recipe directions, but roll the dough out into a larger rectangle about 221/2\" x 11\". Roll the dough starting with one of the longer ends. You'll end up with a roll that is 221/2\" long. Cut into 15 equal pieces. Place the rolls in a 13\" x 9\" nonstick baking dish. Bake for 18 to 22 minutes. You'll have 15 standard-size cinnamon rolls. Spoon 2 teaspoons of the frosting on top of each. Each roll will have 235 calories, 6 g protein, 47 g carbohydrates, 3 g fat, 2 g sat. fat, 1 g fiber. You'll save 578 calories, 29 g fat, 6 g sat. fat.\n\nBEFORE YOU START: Though this recipe requires a time span of several hours, only part of that is hands-on. They're the perfect lazy-weekend project, especially with kids in the kitchen. Each time you make the recipe, you'll develop more of a \"feel\" for the yeast dough. Or if you have a bread machine that can handle 2-pound loaves with a sweet-dough setting, prepare the dough in it by adding the ingredients in the manufacturer's suggested order.\n\nBy Devin Alexander"

Using your hands, break up and squeeze the pulp from the tomatoes to extract as much liquid as possible. Reserve 2/3 c. of the tomato juice (if needed add enough water to the juices to equal the 2/3 c.). In a small bowl combine the sugar and 1 1/2 t. kosher salt and sprinkle evenly inside the tomatoes. Lay the tomatoes cut-side down on a plate and set aside for 30 minutes.",

Add the couscous and cook, stirring constantly until the couscous is coated in the oil and beginning to brown, about 2-3 minutes. Add the garlic and pepper flakes, stir until evenly dispersed and fragrant. Add the reserved tomato juice and remove from the heat, cover and let sit until the couscous is rehydrated, about 7 minutes. Gently fluff with a fork, stir in the lemon juice, basil and 3/4 c. Parmesan. Season with salt & pepper to taste. Then fold in the diced mozzarella.",

Drizzle the remaining 2 T. olive oil in a 13x9-inch baking dish. Add the tomatoes to the baking dish. Combine the 1/2 c. shredded mozzarella and the remaining 2 T. Parmesan, sprinkle over the tops of the tomatoes. Season the reserved tomato tops with salt & pepper and place in the empty spaces in the baking dish. Bake until the tomatoes are softened but still hold their shape and the cheese on top is spotty-brown, 20-25 minutes. Serve the tomatoes, drizzled with the balsamic reduction."

I have found that turmeric can create a bitter taste if used too aggresively, so add any additional in small amounts and taste between. Don't go for a dark yellow colored rice - that would undoubtably be too much! Pale golden color is the way to go. If you are using pork in the dish, stir it into the cooked rice.

If using canned beans, you can drain and rinse them to control the amount of sodium in the dish since some brands can contain A LOT! Otherwise adding the canned liquid is fine. If the mixture seems too thin, simmer longer, if it seems too thick, add a bit more water. It will naturally vary according to the size of the onion and peppers you use, but it should have just enough liquid to barely cover the mix.",

      "I'd been staring at the spaghetti squash on my counter for over a month when I came across a recipe for a spaghetti squash mock mac & cheese recipe that inspired me. If you've never cooked a spaghetti squash, they're kind of a strange food. I'll take you through the recipe one step at a time.Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Cut squash in half and scoop out the seeds and surrounding membrane. Lay squash flat on a baking sheet sprayed with cooking spray and bake until flesh is tender and can be easily scooped out using a fork, about 45-60 minutes. Set the squash aside to cool while you proceed with the rest of the recipe. While the squash is cooking, diced up one large roasted pasilla or poblano pepper (or use something hotter if you prefer). Heat 2 tablespoons butter and 3 tablespoons flour in a medium saucepan over medium high heat and cook for 3 minutes, stirring frequently. Combine 1 3/4 cups milk and 1/4 cream and slowly pour into saucepan, whisking vigorously to avoid lumps. Add green chile peppers to the sauce and 1 3/4 cups of shredded Monterrey jack cheese. Salt and pepper to taste. Let squash cool until you can handle it, then use a fork to scoop out all of the flesh and discard the shell. Notice how the flesh separates into strands like spaghetti? Shred two cooked chicken breast halves with a fork and combine with the cream sauce and the squash and pour into a buttered 8 inch square baking dish. Sprinkle top with another 1/4 cup cheese and bake until golden brown and warmed through, about 30 minutes. This casserole dish is filling enough for a dinner entree, and packed with nutrition thanks to substituting squash for tortillas or pasta."

Stir into the pan along with the chopped tomatoes.\nBring to the boil then simmer for 10 minutes, until some of the liquid has evaporated and you have a delicious, thick bolognaise.",

Now mix into the flours until well coated.\nWhisk together the eggs, milk, pesto and Sriracha sauce, then pour into the bowl. Gently fold in and mix thoroughly until well combined and you have a smooth, dense, dough-like consistency.\nSpoon into the prepared tin and smooth out with the back of a spoon so the base is covered and the top is even.\nBake for about 25-30 minutes until risen and golden, then remove from the oven. Leave for 10 minutes, then slice into squares, transfer to a wire rack to cool. Keep in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days.",
