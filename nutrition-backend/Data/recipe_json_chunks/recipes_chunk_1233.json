Squeeze the lemon's juice into the bowl (tip: zap the lemon in the microwave for 5 seconds and then roll it on the counter with your palm to get more juice out of it). Add the garlic and basil. Add the olive oil (I base my \"correct\" amount of E.V.O.O. based on the consistency of the dressing- I like it to be about the consistency of salsa). Whisk everything together (and take a big whiff while you're at it- you'll think you've died and gone to heaven). Start chopping the veggies as chunky or fine as you want. Throw them in the bowl with the dressing as you go. When you're done with the veggies, add the pepporicini slices and olives. Then add the well drained tuna and mix everything together just until the dressing is totally incorporated. Now is a good time to adjust the seasonings and/or olive oil, so take a taste test and make your additions (or don't) accordingly. Finally, when the pasta is reasonably cool, add it in gradually and mix thoroughly (and as gently as possible). Let it chill in the fridge for a couple hours and enjoy!"

      "TO MAKE THE DOUGH: In a food processor fitted with the metal blade, process the FLOUR and HAZELNUTS (filberts) until the nuts are ground into a fine powder. Pour the mixture into a large bowl. Stir in the sugar, cocoa, lemon zest, cinnamon, cloves, and salt. Using a pastry blender, cut in the butter until the mixture is crumbly. In a small bowl, mix the yolks and lemon juice. Using a fork, stir into the flour mixture until it clumps together. Press the dough into a ball, and divide equally into two thick disks. Wrap each in plastic wrap and refrigerate until firm, at least 60 minutes and up to overnight.",
      "Position a rack in the center of the oven and heat to 350\u00b0F.",

      "Crumble one of the dough disks into the pan. Press firmly and evenly into the pan, bringing the dough 1 inch up the sides. (If the dough is very cold and cracks while using, the heat of your hands will eventually soften it.) The dough will be quite thick, about 1/4 inch at the sides. Prick the dough with a fork and freeze for 10 minutes. In a small bowl, beat the egg white with a pinch of salt until foamy. Lightly brush the inside of the shell with some of the beaten white. Place the springform on a baking sheet and bake just until the dough is set, about 15 minutes. Cool completely on a wire rack.",
      "Let the other disk of dough stand at room temperature for 5 minutes. Spread the preserves in the shell. Roll out the remaining dough on a lightly floured work surface into a 1/4 inch thick circle. Using a fluted pastry wheel, cut the dough into 3/4 inch wide strips. Arrange the strips over the jam in a lattice pattern, trimming as needed, pressing the ends of the strips to side crust. If the strips crack, piece them back together. Gather up any odd strips and trimmings and press a thin layer of dough all around the edge of the crust, securing the ends of the strips. (Discard any leftover dough.) In a small bowl, beat the egg yolk with the milk. Brush the strips lightly with the egg yolk mixture and sprinkle the top with almonds. Bake on the baking sheet until the preserves are bubbling, about 45 minutes.",
      "Cool for 10 minutes on a wire rack. Run a knife around the inside of the pan to loosen the torte, then cool completely in the pan on the rack, at least 3 hours. Remove the sides of the pan. Invert the torte onto a plate and peel off the parchment paper (it may tear off in pieces, but keep at it). Invert again on a serving plate. Sift the confectioners' sugar over the torte and serve. Makes 8 servings.",
      "MAKE AHEAD: The dough can be made up to 2 days ahead, wrapped tightly in plastic wrap, and refrigerated. Let stand for 10 minutes before using. The tart can be baked up to 2 days ahead, wrapped in plastic wrap, and stored at room temperature.",

Bake at 350 for 75 - 90 minutes, stirring every 20 minutes. Leave pot uncovered for the last 20 minutes to help evaporate off some of the excess liquid.

Add flour mixture to egg mixture, attach dough hook, and mix on low speed for 1 to 2 minutes or until liquid is absorbed and a rough mass has formed. {Note: for both croissant dough and Danish dough, you only want to knead the bare minimum to bring the dough together. You want to keep gluten formation to a minimum, which makes rolling the dough easier. It will get plenty of kneading during the rollouts/turns}. Turn dough out on a floured surface. Knead the dough 3 to 5 times to bring it together. The dough is very sticky. Don't be afraid to flour and/or wet your hands. The dough will not be smooth or elastic. Wrap the dough in plastic and refrigerate for 30 to 60 minutes.",

Scrape butter onto a piece of parchment paper, wrap it up and refrigerate while you roll out dough.",

Roll dough into a 15 by 12-inch rectangle with short side parallel to the edge of your work surface. Make it as straight as possible. Stretch and pull corners if necessary to make nice sharp corners. Visually divide the dough into thirds. Using your fingers (butter is too cold for spatula) spread the cold butter over the top of the upper 2/3rds of dough, leaving a 1/2-inch border on edges.",
      "Use a letter fold to encase the butter: Fold the empty bottom third over the middle third of the dough. Then fold the top third down over the center. Pinch together the seams at the bottom and sides of dough and gently roll your rolling pin over the top 3 or four times to help seal the seams. You've just completed your first \"turn\". If the butter has become warm and squishy, refrigerate the dough for an hour. If not, move on to the second turn.",

Dust the dough with flour and roll it into a 20 by 12-inch rectangle. Brush any flour from the surface of the dough. Fold the dough using the book fold method: Fold the two short edges to the center of the dough, leaving a 1/4-inch gap. Line up edges precisely and square corners as you fold. Fold one side over the other as if you are closing a book. Briefly roll your rolling pin across the top to seal the seams. This completes the second turn. Wrap in plastic and refrigerate for an hour.",

Brush any flour from work surface and fold dough using letter-fold method from step #5. Make sure to square the corners and fold neatly and precisely as possible. Roll your rolling pin over the top to help seal the seams. This completes the third turn and the Danish dough is finished.",

Strain through fine-mesh strainer into small bowl to remove any chunks of fruit. Use while warm and fluid. The glaze will keep in refrigerator for one month. Reheat before using.",

Bake one sheet of Danish at a time, rotating sheet halfway through, for 14 to 16 minutes. The Danish should be golden brown. Transfer Danish to cooling rack and immediately brush with a thin layer of Apricot Glaze. Bake and glaze the 2nd Danish sheet the same way.

      "As written:",
      "Center a rack in the oven and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with a silicone baking mat or parchment, or find a Dutch oven with a diameter that's just a tiny bit larger than your pumpkin. If you bake the pumpkin in a casserole, it will keep its shape, but it might stick to the casserole, so you'll have to serve it from the pot - which is an appealingly homey way to serve it. If you bake it on a baking sheet, you can present it freestanding, but maneuvering a heavy stuffed pumpkin with a softened shell isn't so easy. However, since I love the way the unencumbered pumpkin looks in the center of the table, I've always taken my chances with the baked-on-a-sheet method, and so far, I've been lucky.",
      "Using a very sturdy knife - and caution - cut a cap out of the top of the pumpkin (think Halloween jack-o'-lantern). It's easiest to work your knife around the top of the pumpkin at a 45-degree angle. You want to cut off enough of the top to make it easy for you to work inside the pumpkin. Clear away the seeds and strings from the cap and from inside the pumpkin. Season the inside of the pumpkin generously with salt and pepper, and put it on the baking sheet or in the pot. Toss the bread, cheese, garlic, bacon, and herbs together in a bowl. Season with pepper - you probably have enough salt from the bacon and cheese, but taste to be sure - and pack the mix into the pumpkin. The pumpkin should be well filled - you might have a little too much filling, or you might need to add to it. Stir the cream with the nutmeg and some salt and pepper and pour it into the pumpkin. Again, you might have too much or too little - you don't want the ingredients to swim in cream, but you do want them nicely moistened. (But it's hard to go wrong here.).",
      "Put the cap in place and bake the pumpkin for about 2 hours - check after 90 minutes - or until everything inside the pumpkin is bubbling and the flesh of the pumpkin is tender enough to be pierced easily with the tip of a knife. Because the pumpkin will have exuded liquid, I like to remove the cap during the last 20 minutes or so, so that the liquid can bake away and the top of the stuffing can brown a little.",
      "When the pumpkin is ready, carefully, very carefully - it's heavy, hot, and wobbly - bring it to the table or transfer it to a platter that you'll bring to the table.",
      "Serving:",
      "You have choices:you can cut wedges of the pumpkin and filling; you can spoon out portions of the filling, making sure to get a generous amount of pumpkin into the spoonful; or you can dig into the pumpkin with a big spoon, pull the pumpkin meat into the filling, and then mix everything up. I'm a fan of the pull-and-mix option. Served in hearty portions followed by a salad, the pumpkin is a perfect cold-weather main course; served in generous spoonfuls or wedges, it's just right alongside the Thanksgiving turkey.",
      "Storing:",
      "It's really best to eat this as soon as it's ready. However, if you've got leftovers, you can scoop them out of the pumpkin, mix them up, cover, and chill them; reheat them the next day.",
      "Greenspan's Stuffing Ideas:",
      "There are many ways to vary this arts-and-crafts project. Instead of bread, I've filled the pumpkin with cooked rice - when it's baked, it's almost risotto-like. And, with either bread or rice, on different occasions I've added cooked spinach, kale, chard, or peas (the peas came straight from the freezer). I've made it without bacon, and I've also made and loved, loved, loved it with cooked sausage meat; cubes of ham are another good idea. Nuts are a great addition, as are chunks of apple or pear or pieces of chestnut."

      "A word on cocoa:",
      "The darker the cocoa you use for these, the darker and more like Oreos your cookies will be. I use cocoa powder made by Valrhona; it's very dark brown with hints of red. If you want an even darker color, you can use a combination of black cocoa (available online from King Arthur Flour) and Dutch-processed cocoa powder. As with all cookies, it's the taste that counts. Because cocoa has no fat, it will never have the richness of your favorite chocolate, but it will give rich flavor to whatever you're baking, so choose your cocoa as carefully as you choose your chocolate.",
      "TO MAKE THE COOKIES:",
      "Whisk the flour and cocoa together.",
      "Working with a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, or in a large bowl with a hand mixer, beat the butter, sugar and salt together on medium speed until smooth, about 3 minutes. Add the egg white and mix for 2 to 3 minutes, scraping the bowl as needed, until the white, which will curdle the mixture at first, is fully incorporated and the mixture is once again smooth. Mix in the vanilla. Turn off the machine, add the flour and cocoa all at once and pulse until the risk of flying flour has passed. Turn the mixer to medium and mix until you have a dough that holds together and forms clumps when pinched - it shouldn't come together in a ball.",
      "Scrape the dough out onto a work surface and knead it until it comes together. Divide the dough in half and flatten into disks.",
      "Working with one piece of dough at a time, roll the dough between pieces of parchment paper to a thickness of 1/8 inch. Slide the dough, still between paper, onto a baking sheet - you can stack the slabs - and freeze for at least 1 hour.",
      "GETTING READY TO BAKE:",
      "Position the racks to divide the oven into thirds and preheat it to 350 degrees F. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. Have a 2-inch-diameter cookie cutter (or the cutter of your choice) at hand.",
      "Working with one sheet of dough at a time, peel away both pieces of parchment paper and put the dough back on one piece of paper. Cut the dough and place the rounds on the baking sheets, leaving an inch between them. Gather together the scraps from both pieces of dough, re-roll them and freeze until firm.",
      "Bake for 12 to 14 minutes, rotating the pans top to bottom and front to back after 7 minutes, or until the cookies feel firm to the touch. Transfer the sheets to racks and allow the cookies to rest for at least 5 minutes before lifting them onto the racks to cool to room temperature.",
      "Cut and bake the remaining dough, using cool baking sheets.",
      "TO MAKE THE FILLING:",
      "Working with a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, or in a large bowl with a hand mixer, beat all the ingredients together on medium speed until smooth, about 4 minutes. The filling will look like cream cheese.",
      "TO FINISH THE COOKIES:",
      "Put a spoonful of filling on the bottom of half of the cookies. Top with the remaining cookies, bottom side down, and jiggle the cookies, twisting them in opposite directions, to spread the filling evenly. The cookies can be eaten immediately, although the filling will be soft and squish out at first bite. If you'd like neater cookies (with filling that will still squish, but less so), give the filling a couple of hours to set and firm a little, or chill the cookies for 1 hour.",
      "STORING:",
      "The rolled-out dough can be frozen, wrapped airtight, for up to 2 months. The dough can also be cut into rounds, wrapped airtight and frozen for up to 2 months; no need to defrost before baking. The filling can be made ahead and kept tightly covered in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Once baked and filled, the cookies are best served that day, but they can be wrapped well and refrigerated for up to 2 days. The cookies are good cold or at room temperature.",

Grill for 5 minutes on each side, rotating them a quarter turn after 2 to 3 minutes on each side, to produce nice crosshatch marks. It's good to baste with some of the marinade as the meat cooks. As with all marinated meats, you want to go longer and slower on the grill versus shorter and hotter, because if the marinated meat is charred, it may turn bitter.
