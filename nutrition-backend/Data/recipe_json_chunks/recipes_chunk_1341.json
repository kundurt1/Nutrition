The batter should be the consistency of a thick pancake batter. Add a bit more nondairy milk if you need to thin it out. Stir in the chopped chives.",

Pour approximately 1/3 cup of the batter onto the pan and gently spread out to a 6-to 7-inch circle. Cook on the first side for 4 to 5 minutes; the patty should be bubbling and look slightly cooked through and darker in color before flipping. Flip and cook for another 4 to 5 minutes. Fold the patty in half and then in half again, so it looks like you've folded a thick crepe, and cook for another minute on each side to make sure that the middle is thoroughly cooked. Set each folded patty aside on a plate and cover to keep warm. Butter the pan before pouring the next 1/3 cup of batter into the pan. As you go, you might need to lower the heat or adjust cook times, as the pan will get hotter.",

Generously butter each side of the muffins and place 1 piece of cheese on each of the bottom halves.

The patties can be made ahead and heated through in a pan or the oven or in a microwave before serving. You can also store extra batter in the fridge for up to 4 days."

Puree in blender until well blended, about 1 minute. It's OK if the puree is a little frothy, but don't over-blend. Taste the puree for sweetness. Add more sugar to suite your taste. Keep in mind it will taste less sweet when frozen, so make sure it is a little on the sweet side. I always pass the sorbet through my chinois out of habit, but since very little residue was left behind in the chinois you could skip this step and nobody will notice.",

Repeat, adding another 1/2 cup of the hot cream to the bowl with the yolks. Using a heatproof rubber spatula, stir the cream in the saucepan as you slowly pour the egg-and-cream mixture from the bowl into the pan.",
      "4. Cook the mixture carefully over medium heat, stirring constantly, until it is thickened, coats the back of a spatula, and holds a clear path when you run your finger across the spatula, 1 to 2 minutes longer.",

Remove the container from the ice-water bath, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate the base for at least 2 hours or overnight.",

When the bubbling subsides, gently stir to completely blend the cream into the caramel. If you have lumps of hardened caramel in your pan, simply put the pan over low heat and stir until the caramel is melted.",

      "11. As you transfer the ice cream to the storage container, drizzle in the caramel after every few scoopfuls, using about 6 tablespoons of the caramel (or more if you like). When all the ice cream is in the container, use a chopstick or butter knife to gently swirl the mixture. Enjoy right away or, for a firmer ice cream, freeze for at least 4 hours."

      "After you finish each tray, sprinkle some red pepper flakes over the meat. How much you put on depends on how spicy you like it. If you're not into spicy beef jerky, a bit of black pepper can be used instead. For my dehydrator, I set it to 160 degrees Fahrenheit for about four hours. You will want to check your own macine to make sure it's set for the correct time and temp.",

Cook, shifting pan often for even cooking, until sugar syrup is deep amber, tucking in more apples slices as more gaps form, about 45 minutes. Cool until bubbling stops, about 10 minutes.",
