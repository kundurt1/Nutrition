They all came out tough, and never fully popped, and the sugar always burned. And I am a pretty patient cook! To make matters worse, the cleanup of burnt sugar on my stainless pots was a significant chore!",
      "So, I bought a Whirley-pop. With all the great reviews on-line, I knew I would come to love it. I was right! It makes great popcorn, all kinds! Bonus is that you can use less oil than cooking in a pot, like only 2 teaspoons per 1/2 cup batch.",
      "So, this recipe is for a Whirley Pop, as I haven't personally had any success in a regular pot. If you don't have one yet, and you make popcorn a lot, I highly recommend one! Although they are mostly a \"single-use\" item, they are only about $23. And, personally, I recommend this Kettle Corn recipe over the one in the book."

      "Preheat the oven to 250\u00b0C/gas mark 9/450\u00b0F, and let your gammon come to room temperature.",
      "Line a large roasting tin with a layer of foil, and then sit a wire rack on top of this foil. Tear off a large piece of foil (big enough to wrap around the ham) and place this over the rack on the roasting tin. Tear off a second, large piece of foil and place on top, but in the opposite way to the first, so you have 4 corners of foil ready to wrap your ham inches Sit the gammon on the foil and then pour the black treacle over it, straight onto the rind, letting it run down both sides. Don't worry too much about spreading it over the ham, as once it's in the heat of the oven, it will coat the ham well enough.",
      "Now lift up the sides and ends of the first layer of foil and make a seal at the top, leaving some room around the gammon, then seal the ends. Then take up the other piece of foil and do the same: you are trying to create a good seal around the gammon, so pinch together any open gaps that remain. Finally, tear off another piece of foil and put over the top of the whole parcel, making sure it's well sealed.",
      "Put carefully into the oven and let it cook for 30 minutes, then turn the oven down to 100\u00b0C/gas mark 1/4/200\u00b0F and leave for a further 12-24 hours.",
      "The following day, take the gammon out of the oven and open up the foil seal. It will have made some liquid, which you can reserve to moisten the carved meat later. Carefully lift the gammon out onto a board, snip and remove the string, and peel off the rind to leave a good layer of fat.",
      "Increase the oven temperature to 200\u00b0C/gas mark 6/400\u00b0F. Using a sharp knife, cut a diamond pattern in the fat layer, drawing lines one way and then the opposite way, about 2cm/3/4-inch apart.",
      "Stud the centre of each diamond with a clove, then mix together the black treacle, demerara sugar and Dijon mustard in a bowl and spread over the fat on the ham. It will dribble off a bit, so just spoon it back over the gammon before putting back in the oven for 20 minutes, by which time the glaze will be burnished and blistered in the heat. Remove from the oven, and transfer to a board. Let it rest for 10-20 minutes before carving into thin slices.",
      "NOTE FOR THE US: Fully cooked hams are more common in the US and if you use one of these, then try to choose one with the rind still on and not spiral cut. Smear the rind of the ham with 2 tablespoons of molasses then wrap it in a baggy aluminum foil package with tightly sealed edges. Sit it in a roasting pan and reheat following the producer's instructions for oven temperature and time. When the ham has heated through uncover it and reserve juices and use sparingly to moisten ham once sliced. Carefully remove the rind, leaving a good layer of fat, then follow the instructions for glazing the ham.",
      "STORE NOTE: Cool leftovers as quickly as possible, then cover (or wrap tightly in foil) and refrigerate within 2 hours of making. Will keep in fridge for up to 3 days.",
      "FREEZE NOTE: Freeze in an airtight container (or wrapped in foil, and then put in a resealable bag) for up to 2 months. Defrost overnight in fridge before using."

      "My Notes: Would recommend waiting overnight to eat. Consistency was firmer. I used regular sugar for the main recipe, and turbinado for the glaze. Made it in coffee mugs and topped with berries in vanilla sugar.",
      "I've made this recipe for my family twice now and it has been a hit both times. I seem to always end up with extra, making more like 9 instead of six servings, but extras never seem to go to waste. My family later had a creme brulee at a french restraunt in Vegas and said that they were as close as you could come. I highly recommend the vanilla bean but, I don't do the vanilla sugar. I just add a tablespoon of vanilla extract to the sugar and it seems to work just fine. I would recommend this recipe to anyone. You won't regret it."

      "Add enough of the remaining flour to make a soft dough.",
      "Turn out on a slightly floured surface. Knead for about 8-10 minutes, or until smooth and elastic.",
      "Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease the entire surface of the the dough.",
      "Cover and let rise in a warm place for about 1 1/2 hours, or until double.",
      "Punch down; turn out on a lightly floured surface.",

      "I always make pretty flowers out of bits of fruit and cherries or sliced almonds. Such as a flower made with slices of almonds for the petals, bits of candied cherries for the center and citron or green candied cherries for the leaves and stems. Very pretty.",
      "Let the loaves sit until the glaze has set (it will still be slightly squishy to the touch) and then wrap in plastic wrap to keep them fresh until it's time to serve them.",
      "That's another reason we add so much glaze since it helps keep the bread moist.",
      "Place the loaves in a cool dark place or they even freeze well.",

      "1. Adjust an oven rack to the lower middle position and heat the oven to 325 degrees. Butter the sides of a 9 inch springform pan; flour the sides and tap out the excess. Line the bottom of the pan with a parchment or waxed paper round. Wrap the bottom and sides of the pan with a large sheet of foil.",
      "2. Melt 12 tablespoons butter and the chocolates in a large bowl over a large saucepan containing about 2 quarts barely simmering water, stirring occasionally, until the chocolate mixture is smooth. Cool the mixture slightly, then whisk in the vanilla and egg yolks. Set the chocolate mixture aside, reserving the hot water, covered, in the saucepan.",
      "3. In the clean bowl of a standing mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, beat the egg whites and salt at medium speed until frothy, about 30 seconds; add half of the crumbled brown sugar, beat at high speed until combined, about 30 seconds, then add the remaining brown sugar and continue to beat at high speed until soft peaks form when the whisk is lifted, about 2 minutes longer. Using a whisk, stir about one third of the beaten egg whites into the chocolate mixture to lighten it, then fold in the remaining egg whites in 2 additions, using the whisk. Gently scrape the batter into the prepared springform pan, set the springform pan in a large roasting pan, then pour the hot water from the saucepan into the roasting pan to a depth of 1 inch. Carefully slide the roasting pan into the oven; bake until the cake has risen, is firm around the edges, the center has just set, and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center registers about 170 degrees, 45 to 55 minutes.",
      "4. Remove the springform pan from the water bath, discard the foil, and cool on a wire rack 10 minutes. Run a thin-bladed paring knife between the sides of the pan and cake to loosen; cool the cake in the springform pan on a wire rack until barely warm, about 3 hours, then wrap the pan in plastic wrap and refrigerate until thoroughly chilled, at least 8 hours. (The cake can be refrigerated for up to 2 days.).",
      "5. To unmold the cake, remove the sides of the pan. Slide a thin metal spatula between the cake and pan bottom to loosen, then invert the cake onto a large plate, peel off the parchment, and re-invert onto a serving platter. To serve, use a sharp, thin-bladed knife, dipping the knife in a pitcher of hot water and wiping the blade before each cut. (If you like, dust the cake with confectioners' sugar just before serving or top slices with a dollop of lightly sweetened whippped cream. To make slicing easier, freeze the cake for 30 minutes just before serving.).",
      "Variation: Chocolate-Orange Mousse Cake. Follow the recipe for Bittersweet Chocolate Mousse Cake, reducing the vanilla extract to 1 teaspoon and adding 1 tablespoon orange liqueur and 1 tablespoon finely grated orange zest to the chocolate mixture along with the vanilla and egg yolks."

      "Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F. Grease 2 baking sheets with olive oil.",
      "Prepare the pizza dough according to the recipe. Divide the dough into 4 equal portions.",
      "On a floured work surface, using a rolling pin, roll each piece of dough into a circle. Place the circles onto the prepared baking sheets.",
      "For the toppings:",
      "Place 1/4 of the ricotta, Parmesan, mozzarella and tomatoes on the bottom half of each of the rounds. Season the filling with salt and pepper, tear some basil leaves over the cheese and tomatoes and drizzle with a spoonful of the balsamic glaze.",
      "Fold the dough rounds in half to resemble a half-moon shape, covering the filling with the dough. Starting at one end of the half-moon, begin to fold the dough over on itself pressing down as you go. Continue to fold the dough until you reach the end and then tuck the final end under and pinch it shut.",
      "Brush the calzones with some more olive oil and, with the tip of a knife, make 2 slits in each calzone so the steam can escape.",
      "Bake the calzones until the crust is golden and crisp, about 15 minutes. (See Cook's Note*).",
      "Simple Pizza Dough:",
      "In a liquid measuring cup, combine the warm water, yeast and sugar. Allow the yeast to dissolve and bloom, about 5 minutes. Once bloomed, add the olive oil.",
      "Meanwhile, in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine the flour and salt. Stream in the water/yeast mixture and as the dough begins to come together, switch to a dough hook attachment. Allow the dough to knead, adding a bit more flour if needed, so that the dough releases from the sides of the bowl, 1 to 3 minutes. You should be able to touch the dough and not have the dough stick to your fingers. Once the dough has kneaded and has pulled away from the sides of the bowl, remove the dough from bowl to a floured work surface and, with floured hands, continue to knead it by hand for 1 to 2 minutes. Then form the dough into a round ball and place it into a large bowl sprayed with nonstick spray. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a clean dish towel and let the dough rise in a warm area of your kitchen until it doubles in size, 1 1/2 to 2 hours. After the dough has risen it is ready to be cooked however you'd like! (See Cook's Note**).",
      "Tomato Sauce:",
      "Heat a medium saucepan to medium-high. Add in the olive oil. Saute the onions until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add in the tomatoes, garlic, sugar, red pepper flakes and season with salt and pepper. Continue cooking for 10 to 15 minutes on medium low. Season with salt and pepper and fold in the basil.",
      "Cook's Notes:",
      "* Cutting slits in the top of the calzone will prevent the calzone from leaking and let the steam escape. You can fill this calzone with whatever you like.",
      "**This dough is wet dough, keep bench flour at the ready and make sure to flour your hands when working with the dough. Trust your gut as a chef, if the dough is to wet, add more flour, if it is too stiff, add a little water. Sugar is used to feed the yeast which will help the dough to grow. Bread flour will give you a chewier texture because the flour has more gluten. You don't need to use a thermometer to get the water temperature, it should just feel warm to the touch."

    "directions": [
      "Put yeast in 1/2 cup warm water (100 to 110 degrees F). Do not use hotter water or you might kill your yeast. Stir with a spoon until yeast is completely moistened. It will still be a bit lumpy. Let sit 5 to 10 minutes. Stir to ensure that there are no lumps remaining. If you are not sure your yeast is still alive, add a pinch of sugar. The yeast should foam within 5 to 10 minutes. This whole process is called \"proofing the yeast\".",
      "Meanwhile, beat egg with fork. Add 1/2 cup warm water. Add sugar and salt. Stir until mixed. Add the proofed yeast.",
      "Check your food processor manual to ensure that it is capable of mixing bread dough and what is the maximum amount of flour that it can handle. Note that this amount will be significantly less than the stated capacity of the processor. My Cuisinart Power Prep Plus has a stated 14 cup capacity but it can only handle bread dough made with a maximum of 4 cups of flour. If it cannot handle the full 4 cups of flour in this recipe, process the dough in multiple batches.",
      "If your processor has a separate dough blade, put this blade in the processor. Add the flour (Important: process the dough in separate batches if your processor can't handle the full 4 cups). Add the oil. Process briefly to mix the flour and oil.",
      "Turn the processor on (use the dough cycle if your processor has one). Slowly add the liquid through the feed tube. Process until the dough forms a ball. Then process until the dough is smooth and elastic (my processor takes about 30 seconds to get to this stage, but it could take as long as 90 seconds.). The dough ball will rotate around the processor bowl. Do not overprocess because the dough will heat up during processing and may get so hot that it kills the yeast.",
      "Note that depending on the humidity, the type of flour that you use, and the size of your egg, you may need more or less flour to make the right consistency dough. Most beginners use too much flour. The dough should still be slightly sticky but not so sticky that it \"breaks\" and sticks to a clean hand.",
      "Turn out onto a lightly floured board and form into a ball. This is your opportunity to check the texture and knead in a little flour if necessary. If it is too stiff and dry, return dough to processor and add a little more water, process until incorporated.",
      "Place the ball of dough into a lightly oiled bowl. Turn ball over to ensure all surfaces of the dough are lightly covered with oil. Cover bowl with kitchen towel or plastic wrap. Place in a warm place (80 to 85 degrees F is best) until doubled in size and an imprint made with your finger remains in the dough. (If you have a separate light switch in your oven, turn the light on when you begin your bread making process and let the bread rise in the oven. The light will warm the oven somewhat. You can also jumpstart the oven by warming it to the lowest setting, then turn the oven off and leave the door open until the temperature is reduced to no more than 90 degrees.).",
      "Turn dough out on floured board. Knead gently and cut dough in half. Let dough rest for 10 minutes. Work with one half of dough at a time.",
      "For braid: cut each dough half into 3 equal pieces. Roll each piece into a long strand (each about 1 inch thick). Braid the strands. Pinch the ends of the loaf and tuck under. Place loaf on a greased baking sheet (I use vegetable shortening to grease my pans because it seems to release the bread better than oil).",
      "For traditional loaf: roll each dough half into a rectangle (about 1/2 inch thick). Turn so long edge is facing you. Fold right half over middle and press to seal. Fold left half over middle and press to seal. You should now have a rectangle that is as wide as your bread pan. Roll the rectangle up (starting at the short end), pressing with your fingers to seal the loaf well (If you don't do this step well you will have large air pockets in your bread). Pinch the ends of the loaf to seal. Place loaf in a greased loaf pan (I use vegetable shortening to grease the pan.). I use a slightly small bread pan (8 inches by 4 1/4 inches by 2 1/2 inches high) which yields a 1 lb loaf.",
      "Use your hands to rub oil on the top of the loaves. Cover with loose plastic wrap or a kitchen towel. Let rise until doubled. (Note that the dough will just have reached the top of the loaf pan (or less, depending on the size of your loaf pan)).",
      "If desired, beat 1 egg yolk with 1 teaspoon of water and carefully brush the top of the loaf. Sprinkle with coarse sugar, poppy seeds or sesame seeds if desired.",
      "Bake in a 325 to 350 degree oven for 25 to 30 minutes. In my oven, a 16 ounce loaf takes 27 minutes at 325 degrees. If you bake the bread too long, it will be somewhat dry and crumbly and will go stale faster. If you don't bake it enough, it will be doughy in the center, even when cool. Note that if you cut properly cooked HOT bread, it will seem a bit doughy. Let the bread cool slightly before cutting (I know that it is nearly impossible to wait).",
      "Some tips: If your bread is dry and crumbly you: added too much flour, cooked it too long, or let it get stale. If your bread is too dark you: had the oven too high (breads with more sugar will darken quicker) or baked it too long. If your bread has large holes you: didn't knead enough after the first rising to remove pockets of air or you didn't seal your loaf as you were forming it.",
      "If your braid is very flat you didn't have enough flour in the dough (note that this braided bread should only be about 3 inches tall. If you want a taller braided bread, stack a second (slightly smaller) braid on top of the first and bake slightly longer.",
      "If you find you enjoy making homemade bread, I suggest that you purchase your yeast in a 1 or 2 lb package at a warehouse type store. In my area (Ohio, USA) a 1/4 ounce (2 1/4 teaspoon) packet costs at least $.50 but a 2 lb package (equal to 128 packets only costs $3.49 -- a HUGE savings).",
      "This bread freezes well for up to 2 months. You can even pre-slice it."

      "For the Cran-Cherry Compote: In a small sauce pan, mix all ingredients (except the cherries) with a pinch of salt and cook over medium heat until the cherries just begin to burst. Be sure to stir occasionally. When cranberries begin to burst, stir in the cherries and take the pan off the heat to cool.",

Spoon another third of the cran-cherry mixture on top of the apples in random dollops. Spoon over remaining apples. Spoon remaining cran-cherry mixture on top in random dollops, leaving pockets of apple visible on top (placing the cran-cherry mixture in little pockets keeps the apples from being dyed red). Leave the flat edge of the crust free from filling.",

      "Heat a frying pan on high, add 2 tablespoons of the olive oil and fry the veal until brown all over (be careful not to overcrowd the pan; do it in two batches if necessary). Season with salt and pepper and set aside.",
      "Heat a heavy-based saucepan and add the remaining oil and butter. When frothing, add the onion and garlic. Cook, stirring, for a couple of minutes before adding the carrot and celery, then season with salt and freshly ground pepper. Cook for about 5 minutes on medium until soft and lightly golden. Add the browned veal, the wine, sage leaves and a quarter of a cup of water. When it comes to the boil, reduce the temperature to a simmer, cover and cook for about 35 minutes (you may need to add just a little more water if there is not enough liquid). If you are using fresh peas, pod them and add them now. Otherwise continue to cook for another 10 minutes or until the veal has become meltingly tender, adding the frozen peas for the last couple of minutes.",
      "To serve: cook pasta in plenty of salted boiling water until al dente; drain and toss through the veal and pea ragu. Add a knob of butter and a tablespoon of grated Parmesan cheese. Serve immediately, sprinkled with a little parsley, and offer more grated Parmesan on the side.",
      "Note: This sauce can be made one or two days ahead of time up to the point where you have added and cooked the peas. Then gently reheat and proceed as before.",
      "If using fresh peas, ensure you either pod them yourself or use ones that have been recently podded, as they quickly become mealy."

Gradually add the ice water, 1-tablespoon at a time, just until the dough comes together. Be sure not to add too much water. Empty the dough from the mixing bowl on to a piece of waxed paper. Using the waxed paper, shape the dough into a flat disc. Wrap in waxed paper or plastic wrap and chill in refrigerator for at least half an hour. You may also use your hands to form the dough into a disc but the less you touch the dough, the flakier the crust will be.",

Pour apple mixture into the centre of the dough.",

Make an egg wash using 1 egg and a splash of water. Whisk well with a fork. Brush egg wash over the crust evenly with a pastry brush. Sprinkle the crust with white sugar. Sprinkle chopped pecans over the whole tart, gently pressing into the crust so they stick to the egg wash. Place in oven at 400\u00b0 F and bake for 12 minutes. The high heat will help to cook the bottom of the tart well and to create a flakier crust.",
      "After 12 minutes, turn the oven down to 350\u00b0 F and continue baking for another 25 to 30 minutes or until centre is bubbling and the crust is golden brown in colour. Remove from oven and allow to cool slightly. Serve warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, a sprig of fresh mint and a sprinkling of cinnamon."

Mix in the sausage and sprinkle some more soy sauce over all. Stir in bean sprouts and eggs, mixing well so there are no big chunks. Gently mix in the peas. Season with pepper, and stir in green onions just before removing from the heat. Add more soy sauce, if desired, to taste, and serve. This dish reheats well in the microwave.",

Cook the onions until they have softened and released all excess water (about 10 minutes). Bring the heat down to low and allow the onions to caramelize slowly, stirring often, until they become a deep caramel color. This process should take about 40 minutes (depending on your onions, you might need even more time to color them seriously-be patient). Dust the onions with the flour and cook, still stirring, for an additional 5 minutes to toast the flour. Be sure to incorporate it thoroughly.",

When the dough becomes too thick to stir, knead with your hands -- first in the bowl, then on a well-floured work surface. Initially the dough will stick like glue, but eventually you will get a smooth, shiny and quite heavy dough. Add more flour if needed, but only a bit at a time.",

      "Bake in a 400 degree oven. The cookies should bake in no more than five or six minutes -- watch them carefully, and when the bottom edge begins to brown and the surface looks dry, they should be ready. Take the cookies out of the oven and put the pan on a rack. When the cookies cool, they should be harder and slide off the pan. If they are still moist or stick, pop them back into the oven for another minute or two.",
      "This recipe makes lots of cookies, so it can be halved (or doubled, for that matter). The dough will keep almost indefinitely in the fridge, covered with plastic wrap. When it comes out of the fridge, it will be quite hard, but a bit of kneading and rolling will make it soft and pliable again."

      "pour the ranch dressing mix, onion soup mix and Paprika in a baggie and give it a good shake.",
      "Take about a Tablespoon of the mixture and smush it into 2-3T of the butter and set aside. To soften the butter microwave it for 10-12 seconds. Save at least half the butter without seasonimg.",
      "This will take about 2 minutes. Very carefully pat the Chicken dry with paper towel, then slowly separate the skin from the breast and top of drumsticks. Don't use anything but your fingers. Start at the breast cavity and slowly work your fingers between the skin and breast. Do not tear the skin at all costs! Once you have it loosened from the meat, take the softened, seasoned butter mixture and gently push it up under the skin, especially on the top of the breast and drumsticks. It will melt down into the breast as it cooks.",
      "Make sure you have patted the Chicken completely dry (or the butter won't stick) rub some of the spices into the skin, then take half the remaining butter and rub over the whole Chicken.",
      "Take the remaining spice mix and sprinkle over the whole Chicken, starting at the back, the flip and do the breast. Take the wing tips and bend them back behind the wing to prevent the wing tip from burning, and to keep the Chicken from rolling, and put uncovered in 350 degree oven.",
      "cook at 350 for 30 minutes.",
      "Reduce temp to 250 degrees. Drain whatever juice has accumulated and set aside. Cover the breast loosely with foil -once the skin has become light golden and crisp. (This keeps the spices from burning, especially the onions and allows the skin to keep the breast from drying out.) At this time you should carve the drumstick off the Chicken right at the joint (it will not be done) and put them on the bottom of the pan. This allows the dark meat to cook more efficiently, and keeps the skin nice and crisp all the way along the sides of the breast. For the best flavor, be careful to make sure the skin over the top of the Chicken is not disturbed.",
      "Continue to cook the chicken at 250 until you begin to smell it, probably and hour. Don't rush it, this is the only really tricky part. To test doneness take a fork, insert it INSIDE the breast cavity poke the thigh. Do not poke the skin. If it's done it will drain clear juice, and it will be really obvious if the dark meat isn't ready. Leave it in until you are sure the dark meat is done. As long as you have put foil over the breast and left the rest uncovered you will not burn or overcook the breast.",
      "Once it's done immediately remove the foil and drain the juices. This will be the most flavorful drippings you will ever taste. Save it for later, make a gravy or pour it over your dogs food if nothing else!",
      "dont let the chicken sit in juices, Remove from the oven it tastes much better cold than warm and slimy. The skin will remain crisp until the Chicken is cold. It should still be chewy until you refrigerate it though.",
      "Put the garlic cloves and 1T butter inside the breast cavity. Don't be tempted to put the cloves under the skin, it somehow affects the ability to crisp the skin and therefore causes the breast to dry out."
