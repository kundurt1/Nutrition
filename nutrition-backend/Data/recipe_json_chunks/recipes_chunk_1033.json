If you choose not to use the diced tomatos, you are ready to eat. If you choose to use the tomatoes, add them and mix them gently inches At this point, you can either put it in a casserole dish, and pour two beaten eggs over it, then top it with a layer of spaghetti sauce and bake it until the eggs are done and its hot and bubbly OR you can just eat it the way it is sprinkled with salt and pepper. Either way, I think ist yummy. It is even better the next day heated up in the microwave. But, I warn you, if you don't like Spam, you won't like this!"

      "Place a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 350\u00b0F Line a baking sheet with a silicone baking mat or parchment paper (see last step for stovetop instructions). Using a very sturdy knife, cut a cap out of the top of the pumpkin (like a Halloween jack-o'-lantern) by working your knife around the top in a circle at a 45 degree angle. Cut out a large enough cap to make it easy to work inside the pumpkin. Remove the seeds and strings from the cap and from inside the pumpkin. Season the inside of the pumpkin generously with salt and pepper and put it on the baking sheet.",

The pumpkin should be well filled (you might have a little too much filling or you might need to add to it). In a small bowl, stir the cream and the nutmeg together, seasoning the mixture with salt and pepper, then pour it into the pumpkin (again, you might have too much or too little--the ingredients should not swim in cream but they should be nicely moistened).",
      "Put the cap in place and bake the pumpkin for 90 minutes. Remove the cap and return to the oven for another 20 to 30 minutes, until everything inside the pumpkin is bubbling and the flesh of the pumpkin is tender enough to be pierced easily with the tip of a knife. Remove the pumpkin very carefully (it will be heavy, hot and wobbly) and place it on the table or transfer it to a platter. To serve, either spoon out portions of the filling and pumpkin meat, or dig into the pumpkin meat with a large spoon and mix it into the filling before spooning out portions.",

You may find it easier to peel the tomatoes if you blanch them first for 1 minute in hot water. (For this Greek potato stew recipe, it is best to use fresh tomatoes rather than canned.).",

      "To make the tacos: Remove the skin from the fillets and run your fingers over the fillet to check for and remove any embedded bones, using tweezers if necessary. Cut the fish into 8 strips, each 3 - 4 inches (7.5 - 10 cm) long and 3/4 inch (2cm) and place in a nonaluminum bowl. Sprinkle wiht the lime juice, garlic salt, and ground chile and toss to mix. Let marinate at room temperature for 10 minutes. Pour the oil to a depth of 1 inch (2.5 cm) into a deep-frying pan and heat to 375F (190c) on a deep-frying thermometer. This may take up to 5 minutes.",
      "Meanwhile, heat a comal, griddle, or heavy frying pan over medium heat. When it is hot, stack 2 or 3 tortillas on the heated surface and leave for a few seconds. Flip the tortillas,rotating them every second or so until all are hot. Wrap in a dry kitchen towel and repeat with the remaining tortillas. They should keep warm for 10 minutes. If they are to be held longer, wrap a damp towel around the dry towel and place the packet in a 200f (95c) oven.",
      "Pat the fish strips dry with paper towels. One at a time, dip a strip into the batter, allowing the excess to drip off, and slip into the hot oil. Do not allow the pieces to touch. Fry until the strips are crisp and golden, about 7 minutes. Using a slotted spatula, transfer to paper towels to drain, When all are fried, transfer to a warm serving plate. Put the salsa fresca, cabbage, and limes in separate small bowls and set on the table along with the fish, creamy salsa, tortillas,avocado, and hot-pepper sauce. Let the diners make their own tacos, wrapping the fish in a tortilla and adding the other items."

About 3 inches from the end of the tail (the skinny end), make a crosswise cut, slicing about halfway through the meat. This will enable you to fold the tail back over the rest of the roast, giving the tenderloin a roughly cylindrical shape which will help it cook more evenly. Tie the tail in place with butcher's string. Repeat with the remaining tenderloin(s). Place the tenderloins in a baking dish.",

Let the pork marinate in the refrigerator, covered, for at least 4 hours or as long as overnight.",
      "3. Set up the grill for direct grilling and preheat to medium-high. If using a gas grill, place all of the wood chips or chunks in the smoker box or in a smoker pouch and run the grill on high until you see smoke, then reduce the heat to medium-high. If using a charcoal grill, preheat it to medium-high, then toss all of the wood chips or chunks on the coals.",
      "4. When ready to cook, brush and oil the grill grate. Place the pork tenderloins on the hot grate and grill until cooked through, 3 to 4 minutes per side (12 to 16 minutes in all). To test for doneness, insert an instant-read meat thermometer into the meat: The internal temperature should be about 160 degrees F.",

      "My Note: I used to throw out potato salad after a few days but I never have any leftover now. I never add the carrot or pimento or parsley and only add the celery when I have it. I have though, taken to mixing this dressing in a small bowl beforehand. I have always had a bit of a time, either making my potato cubes too hard, undercooked, or too mushy and they mash up too much when trying to blend in the dressing ingredients. Pre-mixing the dressing in the bowl, I can cook my potato cubes fairly soft and then gently fold in the pre-made dressing only to toss the onions, celery and potato cubes and eggs togehther and just coat with the dressing. A perfect chunky potato salad!",
      "For my family's personal preference I used 5 hard boiled eggs, mashing up the yolks into the mayo mixture, for a eggy tasting dressing. I also added another teaspoon of grey poupon mustard, left out carrots."
