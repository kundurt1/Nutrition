      "(Chilling relaxes the dough so it won't fight back so much when being stretched into shape and the extra time allows the dough to develop a deeper, more satisfying flavor.)",
      "To set up to prebake crusts: Position the oven rack in the lower third of the oven and, if using, place a sheet of quarry tiles or a large pizza stone onto rack.",

      "And if the rim seems too thin, simply fold 1-inch of the edge over onto itself and press to adhere.",
