Lift out with a slotted spoon or wire spatula, and, trying to keep the chestnuts whole, peel off both the outer shell and inner skin, as quickly as you can, while they are still hot. Once cold, the skin begins to adhere to the nut, so keep the unpeeled chestnuts in hot water. Repeat with the rest of the chestnuts, boiling 1/2 lb. at a time. The broken pieces will taste just as wonderful as the whole chestnuts, so it is worthwhile preserving them, as well.",

Put the chestnuts in carefully, bring to the boil again, then turn the heat down so that the water just barely simmers. Cook the chestnuts until nearly tender. This takes 10 to 20 minutes, depending on the freshness of the chestnuts, so check occasionally; if overcooked, they tend to break up in the boiling water.

Using two forks, push the biscuit down into the chocolate then pick it up and pass between the two forks allowing the excess chocolate to drip off. Then place the biscuit on the baking parchment. Some folk place the biscuits on a wire rack over baking parchment to allow more chocolate to drip off. I'm a sinner and like as much chocolate sticking to my biscuits as possible. ;)",

      "Measure out the flours by scooping up gently and scrape off the top of the cup evenly with a knife or spatula. Put flours, cinnamon, allspice, yeast, salt and vital wheat gluten in a large container that has a lid. Whisk all dry ingredients together. This prevents the vital wheat gluten from forming lumps. Mix together the lukewarm water, oil, honey, vanilla, mashed bananas and optional walnuts. Add to dry mixture and stir using a large spoon or you can use your hands. Incorporate well but do not knead. I have nitrile medical gloves at home and use those so the dough doesn't stick to my hands but they are not necessary. Yo",
      "Cover loosely with the lid of the container and let rise at room temperature for 2 hours or until it flattens on top. You can use a portion of the dough at this point but it will be very wet and sticky and harder to work with. It works better if it's fully chilled. My recommendation is to refrigerate overnight or at least 3 hours before you shape a loaf.",
      "When you're ready to bake, lightly grease a non-stick loaf pan**, 8-1/2 x 4-1/2 inch. Sprinkle the dough surface with flour and remove half of the dough, about cantaloupe size or 2 pounds. A serrated knife works well to cut the dough. Once you have the dough in your hands, add a little more flour to keep it from sticking to your hands. Gently stretch the dough surface around to the bottom on all four sides. Rotate the ball a quarter turn as you go then shape into an oval. Place the dough into the pan. It should fill the pan approximately three-quarters full. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and let rest for 1 hour and 45 minutes. If using unrefrigerated dough, let rise for 60 minutes. Keep the rest refrigerated until next time. The lid should remain on the container but loosely covered. THE DOUGH WILL LAST UP TO 7 DAYS REFRIGERATED.",
      "Preheat your oven to 350\u00b0 F. at least 30 minutes before baking. You do not need to use a pizza stone for loaf pan breads. Paint the top of the loaf with the egg wash then sprinkle the top of the dough with raw sugar or light brown sugar. Place the pan on a middle rack in center of oven and bake for 45 to 50 minutes. The loaf should be nicely browned and firm.",
      "Remove the loaf from the pan and let cool on a rack. If you encounter problems getting the loaf out of the pan, let it sit for about 10 minutes. This will allow it to steam free of the pan and you should be able to tip it out. If you still have problems, use a rubber spatula and slide it around all four sides between the bread and the pan. This will help loosen it and prevent you from scratching the pan.",

      "Vital wheat gluten (also known as vital wheat gluten flour) can be found in grocery stores under the brands, Bob's Red Mill or Hodgson Mill. You can also buy the King Arthur Flour brand online. Natural food stores and farmers' markets may carry it , too.",
      "As whole grain type doughs age, they will become dense and in the end, won't rise very much. Whole wheat flours have much less gluten than white flour which means less rising power and a less airy crumb (bread interior). The addition of vital wheat gluten assists with the rise and helps the doughs' storage life in the refrigerator.",
      "Vital wheat gluten should be kept in an air-tight container and stored in the refrigerator.",
      "Non-stick loaf pans are recommended because of the high moisture content in the dough. Wet dough tends to stick to pans more so lightly coating the pan with oil, shortening, butter or margarine is advised."

      "The dough can be mixed by hand or with an electric stand mixer or full size food processor.",
      "To mix by hand\n\nStep 1:\n\nDissolve the yeast and sugar in the warm water in a very large bowl and let stand for at least 5 minutes to activate the yeast action.",
      "Step 2:\n\nCombine the warmed mile (100-115\u00b0) with the melted butter and salt. Add to the proofed yeast and stir well to combine.",
      "Step 3:\n\nAdd the 3 cups of whole wheat flour to large bowl and mix well with wooden spoon. Once combined add 3 cups (1 cup at a time) of the bread or all purpose flour and mix well by wooden spoon or with your hands. The dough will be sticky and get harder to mix. Add enough of the remaining flour to make a smooth firm dough.",
      "Step 4:\n\nTurn the dough out onto the board which has been lightly floured and knead well (yes- get your aggressions out on the dough!) Keep turning and kneading for 5 - 7 minutes (think upper body workout) until it is smooth and elastic.",
      "Step 5:\n\nShape into a ball. Place in a lightly oiled or buttered bowl, turn so that the dough that was on the buttered bottom is now on top. This will keep the dough from drying out during the first rise. Cover bowl with plastic wrap or an absolutely clean towel. Place in a draft free place to rise. Check in about 45 minutes to 1 hour. Set a timer but if it takes longer to rise give it time. Dough should double in size. It is done with the first rise when you poke the dough with 2 fingers and the finger marks don't bounce back.",
      "Step 6:\n\nPunch, yes take your fist and punch the dough down to deflate it.",
      "Step 7:\n\nDivide the dough into 2 or 3 pieces of equal size. (Depending on the pans you're going to use) Shape into a roll and place in buttered or oiled loaf pans. Cover once again and let rise in a warm place again until doubled in size. If you haven't, now is the perfect time to preheat the oven to 425\u00b0 to heat fully while dough is rising in the pans.",
      "Step 8:\n\nMake a lengthwise slit in the very top of breads, place in the preheated 425\u00b0 oven for 10 minutes. (Set the timer please) Then drop the temperature to 350\u00b0 for 30 - 35 minutes. Carefully turn a bread out of pan and rap the bottom, if it sounds hollow it's done. (Doesn't want to pop out easily? Just run a table knife around the edges and that should do it)",
      "Step 9:\n\nLet loaves cool fully to room temperature on a cooling rack. You're going to want to slice that now but please and try it but resist until it's fully cooled down. (Will slice better too)",
      "Step 10:\n\nEnjoy!!! If you're freezing do so within 6 or so hours after baking for best results. (see freezing tip at the beginning)",
      "Mixer Method:\nSo....for those of you using modern electrified conveniences here's the easier way to do this!\n\nStep 1:\n\nDissolve the yeast and sugar in the warm water in a bowl and let stand for at least 5 minutes to activate the yeast action. Combine the warmed milk (100-115\u00b0) with the melted butter add to proofed yeast.\n\nStep 2:\n\nIn the mixer bowl add the whole wheat flour, salt and 3 cups of the bread or all purpose flour. Combine thoroughly so the salt is well dispersed in the flours. Use the dough hook as in the picture above that comes with many stand mixers. If you have a collar for the bowl that came with mixer it's a good idea to use that and start the mixer on the lowest speed to not be dusted with flour yourself, unless you like the dough boy look?",
      "Step 3:\n\nWith the mixer on lowest speed *slowly* add the liquids to the flour and mix about 5 minutes until very well blended. Add 1 cup at a time additional of the white flour to mixer until the dough comes together and is firm smooth and elastic.",
      "Step 4:\n\nShape into a ball. Place in a lightly oiled or buttered bowl, turn so that the dough in the bowl to cover the dough ball with butter. This will keep the dough from drying out during the first rise. Cover bowl with plastic wrap or an absolutely clean towel. Place in a draft free place to rise. Check in about 45 minutes to 1 hour. Set a timer, but if it takes longer to rise give it time. Dough should double in size. It is done with the first rise when you poke the dough with 2 fingers and the finger marks don't bounce back.",

      "For Crema:\nCombine crema or sour cream, with 1/2 a Cup of cilantro, lime juice and kosher salt to taste.",
      "To Assemble the Shrimp Tacos:\nStart with crema on the bottom- that way, it's close to the lettuce and cabbage and sort of acts as a dressing. Next comes the cabbage and lettuce- down at the bottom of the shell, where it won't be falling out all over the place. Next layer on the grilled onions, the shrimp, top with the spicy pickled peppers, and the cilantro.",
      "Notes:\nTo chiffonade: After picking the cilantro leaves from the stems of your cilantro bunch, gather them into a tight ball with your fingertips in your left hand (assuming you're right handed, switch if you're a lefty). Keeping your fingertips curled under the fingers holding the ball of herb, rest the broad side (obviously not the sharp side) of the knife against your knuckles and start cutting the herbs with a forward and back motion, feeding the herbs into the blade as you go.\nFor Skewering: If you are using wooden skewers, make sure to soak your skewers in water before placing the shrimp on them, it will reduce burning. I prefer metal skewers, then don't have to worry about any of that. Now, I want to discuss a couple ways to skewer your shrimp that I have demonstrated here for you: There is always the straightforward method, just skewer them in two places in the shape of a \"c\"- through the head and the tail. This results in a tightly curled, \"shrimpy\" looking shrimp. Or, you can also use two skewers, lay the skewers side by side and thread the head on one skewer and tail on the other. This will result in a straight shrimp, your shrimp will not curl up on you. The final method is my preferred approach, I call it the over/under- it looks cool, it creates a more open curled shrimp and it really packs the shrimp on the skewer tightly to help prevent overcooking. For this method, thread the head of the shrimp onto the skewer, then thread the head of another shrimp onto the skewer, next thread the tail of the first shrimp, and then the second shrimp. Resulting in the two shrimp looking like interlocking letter c's.\nMake sure to salt the cabbage and lettuce for extra flavor."

I find that the pan gets dry quite quickly and you don't want the veg to burn but also don't want to overload on oil, so I add between 100-150ml after about 1 minute. This will evaporate off shortly so won't dilute your food. Stir the vegetables frequently to avoid burning and this should take around 6-8 minutes. Once the veg are soft and tinted golden-brown turn the heat down to the lowest.",
