Scatter the garlic over the tomatoes. Roast until they're softened and warmed through, about 15 minutes. (Underripe tomatoes may take 5 to 15 minutes longer.) Meanwhile, cut the mozzarella into six 1/2-inch-thick slices. Using a spatula, sandwich each cheese slice between 2 hot tomato halves. The heat of the tomatoes will melt the cheese slightly. Drizzle with any juices that collected in the roasting pan and garnish with the basil.",
      "To slice a soft cheese such as fresh mozzarella easily, first freeze it for 30 minutes. Bring the slices to room temperature before continuing with the recipe."

Spring salads of tender greens or asparagus can be dressed with a milder vinaigrette that uses champagne vinegar, and a vinaigrette of sherry vinegar pairs beautifully with woodsy sauteed mushrooms. Citrus juice can be substituted for the vinegar too. If using a sweeter citrus fruit, such as oranges, add a bit of lemon juice to give the dressing a tart edge (taste it to make sure there's enough of a tang). Straight lemon juice is milder than vinegar and is often used in a 1-to-1 ratio with the oil.",

Press on bottom, up sides, and onto rim of a lightly greased (with cooking spray) 9-inch deep-dish pie plate. Bake 10 minutes. Cool on a wire rack. Prepare Filling: Whisk together 3/4 cup sugar and next 3 ingredients in a large saucepan. Whisk together half-and-half and egg yolks in a large bowl. Gradually whisk egg mixture into sugar mixture. Cook over medium heat, whisking constantly, 6 to 8 minutes or just until mixture begins to boil. Cook, whisking constantly, 1 more minute; remove from heat. Whisk in semisweet chocolate and next 3 ingredients. Place plastic wrap directly on warm filling. Let stand 30 minutes. Spread filling in cooled crust; place plastic wrap directly on filling, and chill 30 minutes. Prepare Mousse: Microwave milk chocolate morsels and 3 Tbsp. heavy cream in a medium bowl at MEDIUM (50% power) for 1 to 1 1/2 minutes or until melted, stirring at 30-second intervals. Let stand 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. Beat 1 cup heavy cream at medium-high speed with an electric mixer until soft peaks form. Gently fold half of whipped cream into milk chocolate mixture until blended and smooth; fold in remaining whipped cream. Spread mousse over filling. Cover and chill 8 to 24 hours or until set. Top with Chocolate Whipped Cream just before serving.Note: We tested with Ghirardelli Semi-Sweet Chocolate Baking Bar and Ghirardelli 60% Cacao Bittersweet Chocolate Baking Bar."

Likewise, you can replace the seeded cucumbers in any of our recipes with English.",

      "Bring an 8-qt. pot of well-salted water to a boil. Meanwhile, in a 4- to 6-qt. pot, heat 2 tbsp. oil over medium heat. Add onion and 1 1/2 tsp. salt; cook, stirring occasionally, until translucent, 6 to 8 minutes. \"Salt helps pull moisture out of the onion, so it steams and cooks without coloring.\" Pour in 1/4 cup wine--\"to add acidity\"--and cook, 1 minute. Stir in spinach, plus pepper to taste, and cook, stirring, until wilted (or just until hot if using thawed frozen spinach). Remove from heat and drain in a colander. \"You don't want the liquid--it'll make the lasagna wet.\"",
      "Preheat oven to 400\u00b0. Squeeze sausage from its casing and pull apart into small pieces with a spoon. In a second 4- to 6-qt. pot over medium-high heat, saute sausage in 1 tbsp. oil until browned, breaking up into nuggets, about 10 minutes. Add garlic and cook until lightly browned, 1 to 2 minutes; then pour in remaining 1/4 cup wine and cook another minute. Stir in tomatoes and simmer 15 to 20 minutes, uncovered--but no more. \"You can overcook tomato sauce, and it gets really sweet. For this, you want bright and fresh.\"",
      "Meanwhile, boil noodles, no more than 6 at a time. \"By giving them room, you're making sure they cook evenly and don't stick together.\" Boil until flexible but still a little underdone (pinch off a piece to test), about 5 minutes. \"They'll finish cooking as the lasagna bakes.\" With tongs, gently lift each noodle as done and dunk for a few seconds in a bowl of ice and cold water to stop cooking, then lift to a large bowl, sprinkle with oil, and turn to coat. \"The oil coats the pasta and creates a barrier between noodle and sauce, which helps the texture.\"",
      "While noodles are cooking, season tomato sauce with salt to taste and about 1 tsp. pepper. \"You're basically making a cheater's Bolognese sauce.\" Toss eggplant slices with a bit of oil and salt, spread out on a parchment-lined baking sheet, and roast in oven 10 minutes. Remove and let cool. (If using summer squash, skip this step.) Blend ricotta with egg in a glass measuring cup. \"This stands in for the classic bechamel.\"",
      "First (bottom) layer: Rub 1 tbsp. oil over bottom of a 9- by 13-in. baking dish. Add cooked noodles (4 crosswise if short and fat; 4 lengthwise if long and thin, and use part of a 5th to fill in the end; overlapping is okay). \"Pasta on the bottom, instead of sauce, helps the lasagna cut cleanly.\" Top noodles with 1/4 of ricotta, smearing into a thin, even layer with the back of a spoon. Top ricotta with 1/3 of spinach. Add about 1/2 cup tomato sauce and spread evenly, followed by 1/2 of basil leaves (tear if large). \"Don't put too much tomato sauce. There's nothing worse than a sandwich with messy layers, and I feel the same way about lasagna.\" Top with 1/3 of mozzarella slices, tearing each slice into large pieces to cover more evenly, then 1/2 of jalapeno slices. \"The fresh heat of the chile gives the lasagna a pop.\"",
      "Second layer: Arrange another level of noodles in pan and gently \"smoosh them down. It makes the layers more even.\" Then layer in these ingredients in order, spreading each evenly: generous 1/4 cup ricotta, 1 cup spinach, 1 1/3 cups tomato sauce--\"Double the amount on the first layer, because now you want it to melt down into the other ingredients\"--all of eggplant slices (overlap as needed), and all of salami (overlap as needed).",
      "Third layer: Arrange noodles and press down as before. Spread 1 cup tomato sauce, then 1/2 of remaining mozzarella, rest of jalapeno, rest of spinach, and 1/3 of parmesan.",
      "Fourth (final) layer: Top with remaining noodles and press down gently. Spoon on remaining tomato sauce, followed by basil leaves. Evenly dollop on the rest of the ricotta but don't spread. \"You want nice little pockets, which will souffle up and caramelize.\" Add remaining mozzarella as whole slices, and then rest of parmesan--\"a heavy dusting, both for seasoning and for color. I want it to be nice and golden brown.\"",
      "Bake on center rack 30 minutes, then (keeping lasagna on center rack) turn oven to broil and broil until cheese on top is golden brown and bubbly, 2 to 5 minutes. Remove from the oven and let rest at least 10 minutes before serving.",
      "Make ahead: Through step 8, up to 1 day, chilled, or frozen, up to 3 months. Bring to room temperature before baking."
