    "title": "roasted peach & mint ice cream",
    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "To roast and prepare the peaches: Heat oven to 425 degrees F. Liberally sprinkle cut sides of halved peaches with sugar. Follow with a pinch of salt. Meanwhile, melt butter in cast iron skillet over medium-high heat. Arrange peaches in the skillet cut side down. Without disturbing them, cook until the cut sides begin to brown, about 3 to 5 minutes. (Note - the peaches will throw off juice while they're browning, which will eventually thicken in the oven.) Transfer to the oven and roast for about 10 minutes. Flip, drizzle with butter, and continue roasting another 5 to 10 minutes, or until tender. The total cooking time will depend on the size and ripeness of your peaches. Let cool -- then transfer the contents of your pan into the bowl of a food processor, making sure to scrape up and include any melted butter left behind. Process for a minute or two, or until you have a smooth puree. Set aside and let cool to room temperature. (The peach puree can be prepared up to 2 days in advance, covered, and refrigerated.)",
      "To make the ice cream base: Whisk together the egg yolks and 1/3 cup sugar until the mixture is pale yellow.",
      "Meanwhile, in a large saucepan, whisk together the heavy cream, whole milk, and remaining 1/3 cup sugar. Bring the mixture to a simmer. As soon as it starts to come up the sides of the pan, remove the pan from the heat. Add a little to the egg yolk mixture to warm it, starting with a few drops, then a slow and steady stream, about 1 cup total. Whisk constantly to prevent the egg yolks from curdling. Pour the egg yolk mixture back into the remaining hot milk mixture; whisk together to combine.",
      "Return the custard to the stove and cook it over low heat, stirring constantly with a heatproof spatula, until it thickens enough to coat the spatula, about 7 to 10 minutes. If using an instant read thermometer, it should read around 170 degrees F (77 degrees C). Immediately take the saucepan off the heat, and pour the custard mixture into a large bowl. Stir in the vanilla extract, salt, and mint.",
      "Prepare an ice bath in a large bowl, and in it, place the bowl of custard. Let stand at room temperature for about 1 hour to cool and to let the mint steep. (Taste the custard after about 1/2 hour to see how minty it is -- if it's to your liking, go ahead and discard mint and continue to cool the custard.) Stir the cooled peach puree into the custard, then strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl, pushing down and scraping back and forth with your spatula; you will have just over 4 cups of custard. Discard the mint. Cover the bowl and refrigerate the custard until it's thoroughly chilled, about 3 to 4 hours or overnight. (I sometimes accelerate this chilling process by putting the bowl in the freezer for 45 minutes or so - but set a timer so you don't forget about it. You want it to chill, not freeze!)",
      "To freeze the ice cream: Transfer chilled custard mixture to the bowl of your ice cream mixture, and freeze according to the manufacturer's instructions. Once done, transfer the ice cream into an airtight container, and place a piece of plastic wrap directly over the surface to prevent crystals from forming. Cover and freeze until firm, about 2 hours. Ice cream should keep well for up to 2 weeks."

      "Prepare the salmon fillets by using tweezers to remove the pin bones. These small, thin, spiky bones can be felt by running your fingers along the top of the fish. Pinch the end of a pin bone with the tweezers, push down gently on the flesh with your other hand, and pull the pin bone straight out. You may find as many as 20 pin bones in each fish fillet, but don't be daunted by the task, it only takes a few minutes.",
      "Place the salmon fillets skin side down in a non-reactive container (ceramic or a baking sheet lined in plastic wrap) with high sides to keep any juices released during curing from spilling from the container.",
      "Apply the cure. Stir together the salt and sugar, then rub the mixture evenly over each salmon fillet. Sprinkle the chopped dill over the salmon, and pour 1 tablespoon aquavit over each fillet.",
      "Place one of the salmon fillets skin side up on top of the other fillet. The salmon fillets will be touching flesh to flesh, each with the skin on the outside. Cover the stacked salmon fillets with plastic wrap and place a heavy weight atop the fish. A plate or baking tray weighed down with bags of flour works well. Put the salmon in the refrigerator to cure for 2 to 3 days, turning the fish every twelve hours. The gravlax is finished curing when it feels firm to the touch at the thickest part of the fillet.",
      "Once the salmon has cured, gently wipe the cure off the top of the fillets. Use a long, narrow, flexible, sharp knife to remove the skin from each fillet. With the salmon skin side down, grab the tail end, pinching it with your thumb and fingers. If the skin is slippery, use a paper towel to grip it. Use the knife to slice between the skin and flesh. Keep the knife at an angle, pointed down towards the skin, and use a rocking motion to slice under the length of the fillet and remove the skin. Take your time and be patient, as removing skin from a fish fillet is delicate work, a skill that gets better with practice. Once the skin is removed, flip the fillet over and trim off any pieces of skin still left on the fish. After the skin is removed from both fillets, store them in the fridge, well wrapped, where they will keep for at least a week.",
      "To serve, slice the salmon as thinly as possible by using a sharp knife to shave off pieces, cutting towards the tail end. Wrap any unused salmon and return it to the fridge. Traditionally, gravlax is served with mustard-dill sauce and rye bread. It's also delicious tossed in with boiled potatoes and dressed with a lemon vinaigrette, or atop a bagel with cream cheese and chives."

For me, the grainy texture was never appealing, so I put the livers, onions, 2 eggs, s&p into the cuisenart and blended until smooth adding about 4 tablespoons of fat a pinch at a time until it was incorporated and velvety. I also stirred in some chopped parsley.",

      "The only thing you actually have to make is the sushi rice. There are many options for the toppings, so you are not forced to use raw fish for Temari sushi, but we would still recommend to use sushi rice, since plain rice with food on top will surely taste pretty bland and boring. Follow the instructions from Make My Sushi to get the result needed.",
      "As explained before in the ingredients list, you can choose between so many things to put on top. We bought in sushi grade salmon and red snapper to have contrasting colors, but there is so much you can choose from.\r\nYou can actually use boiled shrimp or crab, smoked salmon or even grilled meat if you are not that into raw fish. Anything that's cooked will work.",
      "If you rather prefer a vegan or vegetarian option, you can also use Temari Sushi with your veggies of choice. Grill them, or roast them so they are tender, or proceed with fresh vegetables as well.\r\nWhatever it is that you end up choosing, though, put that on a plastic wrap, followed by a little bit of sushi rice over.\r\nTwist the plastic wrap and close on the top, making a ball. That's all there is to it!\r\nThe important thing, if you want it to look pretty, is to make it small and let the food cover most of the rice. Use enough rice so that when you stand over it, you won't see it from the top. If you are detail-freaks like us, try also to make each ball the same size. With that, you can easier play with the arrangement of the Temari Sushi and get creative. Make sure to have a little soy sauce on the side, to add some extra flavor to it."

When the oil is hot, add the onions and stir regularly until they become soft, sweet, and translucent, approximately 25 minutes. If you see the onions beginning to caramelize, lower the heat-you do not want them to brown. When the onions are done cooking, set them aside until they cool to room temperature.",

Pulse the fish in the food processor until there are no large pieces of fish visible. Transfer the fish mixture to the bowl with the matzo and stock. Add the egg yolks, salt, and sugar. Use a rubber spatula to thoroughly mix together the ingredients. In a separate bowl, whisk the egg whites until they form soft peaks. Fold the whipped egg whites into the fish mixture.",

Form the fish mixture into oval shapes that are slightly smaller than the size of your fist. You can use a large spoon to help mold the fish mixture into a nice oval shape. Drop the fish into the simmering stock and cook for approximately 25 minutes, until the gefilte fish is fully cooked through. You may need to cook the gefilte fish in batches if it is not possible to fit all the fish in the simmering stock pot at one time. Remove the cooked gefilte fish to a rimmed baking sheet. When the gefilte fish have cooled, store them in the refrigerator. Serve the gefilte fish cold with your favorite horseradish condiment, and garnish with your favorite spring ingredients (I like to use pea shoots and radishes)."

    "title": "swiss chard tortelli with sage-butter sauce (tortelli di erbette)",
    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "To make the ricotta, put the all of the milk and cream in a large, heavy-bottomed pot (I use a dutch oven). Bring this mixture to a boil slowly over medium heat, stirring occasionally. As soon as you see signs of boiling, reduce the heat to low and squeeze in the juice of one lemon. Stir stir stir and watch for the milk to begin to curdle. If nothing happens, increase the heat just a bit and add the juice of half of the second lemon. Once it looks like about half of the mixture is curds and the other half whey, pour it out over a fine mesh sieve (or a sieve lined with cheesecloth if you feel so inclined). This ricotta needs to be fairly dry for the filling, so let a good amount of whey drain out from the curds. Put the ricotta in a bowl to cool, and add half of the handful of kosher salt (or to taste). While it is cooling, put a spoonful on a piece of bread with a little olive oil and try it - you will never buy ricotta in a store again.",
      "To make the filling, first boil the swiss chard. Bring a large pot of water to boil and add a handful of salt, much like you were making pasta. Prepare the swiss chard by removing the tough stem from the leaves, going almost all the way up the center. Put the chard leaves into the boiling water and cook for about 2 minutes, until the chard is soft. I do this in batches of 3-4 leaves at a time. Drain the leaves in a colander or sieve, and press out as much water as possible with the back of a big spoon. Once the chard is cool enough to handle, chop it finely or place it in a food processor for a few seconds. If using a food processor, add all of the ricotta to the processor bowl and whir whir whir until combined and homogenous. Transfer the mixture to a large bowl. If you are not using a food processor, put the finely chopped chard into a large bowl and add the ricotta, mixing well.",
      "Whether using a food processor or not, at this point the chard and ricotta should be in a large bowl and we are back on the same path. Add the egg, grated parmesan, and grated nutmeg to the bowl and mix well. Please use freshly grated parmesan - this is what men are for, and the pre-grated parmesan in stores tends to be too dry and the pieces too large. The final texture of the filling should be moist but dry enough to be spooned onto the pasta without running anywhere. If the filling feels too wet, add more grated parmesan. If the filling feels too dry, add some olive oil. Taste the filling and add salt if needed. Cover and store in the fridge until you are ready to assemble the tortelli. The filling can be made a day in advance and left in the fridge, or a while in advance if you store it in the freezer.",
      "The classic Italian pasta recipe is 1 egg for every 100 g of flour, type \"00\" flour if you can find it. I can't, so I use all-purpose flour and if the end result feels a little dry I add a bit of olive oil. Put all of the flour in a large bowl and make a crater in the center. Put all of the eggs in the crater and throw in a couple pinches of fine salt. (Italian mammas do this on a countertop, but I always make a mess so I use a bowl.) With a fork, beat the eggs in the center and start to slowly incorporate some of the flour at the edges of the crater into the eggs. Slowly but surely, keep bringing in a little more flour into the eggs. Eventually, the mixture will become solid enough that you have to put the fork down and go in with your hands. Incorporate all of the flour into the pasta with your hands. If it is too floury and dry, add a touch of olive oil or water. Put the lump of pasta onto a floured surface and knead it for a good 10 minutes. If you are a weak kneader then make it 15 minutes. After kneading, wrap the pasta ball in plastic wrap and set aside to rest for at least one hour. If you want to make the pasta more than an hour in advance, wrap it and put it in the fridge to rest. Take it out of the fridge about an hour before you are ready to make the tortelli it to give it time to warm up.",
      "Assemble the tortelli. Enlist someone to help with this step! Clear a big space on a countertop and sprinkle flour everywhere. Attach a pasta machine to the counter (I use a cheap hand crank machine), and set the machine to the thickest setting (no. 7 on mine). Unwrap the ball of pasta dough and cut off a 1/2 inch section. Move the remaining dough out of the way and flour the piece that you just cut off. Flatten it down with the heel of your hand or with a rolling pin. The idea is to get this piece thin enough to get pulled into the machine. Roll the pasta through the machine on the thickest setting. Fold it in half and roll it through again. Then move the machine down to the second-thinnest setting (no. 2 on my machine) and send the pasta through the machine once. The result should be a sheet of pasta that is quite thin and about as wide as the machine will allow. Irregular ends are fine, just cut them off and throw into a pile for later. (The scraps can be used to make tagliatelle! No time now, that's for another recipe.) Spoon about 1-inch diameter balls of the filling onto the sheet of pasta in one row, offset slightly toward one of the long edges. These lumps of filling should have about 1 inch of space between them. Take the long edge of the pasta sheet that is farthest from the filling and fold it over the row of filling, trying to match the long edges. Press around the lumps of filling with your fingers so that the pasta forms a tightly-sealed pouch around the filling, pushing out any pockets of air in the process. Take a crimped-edge pasta cutter (rotellina) and cut around each tortello, leaving a border of pasta around the filling (except on the folded side, which will not have a crimped-cut border!). Move the individual tortelli to floured \"holding area\" to wait while you finish the others. As you are moving them individually, give the edges an extra little pinch to seal in the tortelli and keep them from opening while cooking. The end result should look like what Americans call ravioli. Repeat these steps until the filling is gone or until you just can't make any more. Drink a glass of wine.",
      "Bring a large pot of water to a gentle boil. Add a handful or kosher salt to the water. Place the butter and sage into a large pan over the lowest heat possible. This pan is the holding place for the cooked tortelli to stay warm, since they will be done in batches. Drop in about 8-15 tortelli in the gently boiling water (don't overcrowd them) and allow to cook for about 2-3 minutes. I always take one out and eat it (or give it to someone else to eat) to make sure it is cooked but still al dente - there is no better test for pasta. Remove the tortelli from the water with a slotted spoon and place into the butter and sage pan, gently and one at a time. Keep cooking the tortelli in batches in the boiling water, transferring them to the butter and sage pan when ready. Keep the butter circulating over the tortelli so they all get some of the sage and butter goodness. Serve on a plate, and spoon some of the sage-infused butter on top. Finish with some grated parmesan, which each person can do themselves. After all, you worked very hard to make this meal!"

      "Roasting the chiles\r\n\r\nThis is best done on a gas stove, if possible. Place the chiles directly on the burner grills over a med-high flame. (Use two burners with two to three chiles on each.) You will hear the skin blister and pop. Rotate just as it turns black-excessive charring will result in thin-walled chiles. If you have an electric stovetop, you can either use a skillet over high heat or place the chiles directly on the burner. (In this case, choose chiles that have a flatter profile. Some can be rather undulating and are difficult to char thoroughly on an electric burner or skillet.)",
      "Once the chiles are charred all over, place them in a bowl and cover with a tea towel to cool. The towel absorbs some of the steam so the chiles don't get too wet.\r\nWhen the chiles are cool enough to handle, peel and gently scrape the charred skin off, using the back of a paring knife. If some of the skin did not get charred and wants to remain, don't worry about it. Leave the stems intact. Make a slit about 2 inches long in the side of each chile, starting close to the top, and remove the seeds. (It can be helpful to carefully make a cut just at the top of the seeds and remove them as a unit-it's a little less messy). If necessary, rinse very briefly under cold water to remove bits of skin and seeds.",
      "The stuffing:\r\n\r\nStem and wash the greens. If using chard, reserve some of the more tender stems, chop into 1/4 inch pieces and set aside. If leaves are large, chop coarsely. Heat a large, deep skillet or wide saucepan, coat the bottom with about 1 tbsp. of olive oil and toss in the still-damp greens with a sprinkling of salt. Depending on the size of your pan, it may be necessary to do this in two batches. Toss frequently. When greens are wilted (about 3 minutes), remove from heat and drain off the excess liquid. Spinach, in particular, releases a lot of liquid, so use a mesh strainer and press on the greens to drain. Chop the greens down a little more.",
      "Add the remaining oil to the pan over medium heat. Add the minced onion. If using chard stems, add these now and saute until the onion is translucent and the stems softened. It may help to add a couple of tablespoons of water to help soften the stems. When the water has evaporated, add the raisins, pine nuts and greens, and saute these until the greens become quite dry (3 to 5 minutes).",
      "Taste goat cheese for saltiness and salt the greens accordingly.",
      "Transfer the greens to a bowl to cool. Crumble the goat cheese in with the cooled greens and combine. To portion the filling, pat the mixture down into the bowl so the surface is relatively flat and you can divide it into 6 \"pie wedges.\" Scoop out each portion, form into a log and stuff into each chile.",
      "The sauce:\r\n\r\nI use a comal (heavy steel or cast iron griddle) for the following step. If you don't have one, you can use a large skillet. I recommend covering the skillet surface with a sheet of foil because the sugars from the tomato can really make a mess of your pan. The foil allows for easy clean-up.",
      "Heat skillet or griddle over high heat. Cut about 1/3 of the tomatoes in half lengthwise. Place the whole tomatoes, halved tomatoes, onion slices, and whole cloves of unpeeled garlic on the skillet. Turn each as it colors-the cut tomatoes will begin to caramelize on the cut side, and the whole ones will blister black in spots. The onions will turn a dark golden brown, and the skin of the garlic will brown. Transfer each to a bowl as it becomes soft.",
      "If desired, you may remove the core of the tomato, and if the skin is very black, remove some of that, too, but leave some for the flavor. Peel the garlic. Transfer all ingredients to a blender or food processor and blend to a slightly rough puree. Taste the sauce. If it is acidic or bitter, add the sugar.",
      "In a skillet large enough to accommodate the pureed sauce, heat 1 to 2 tbsp. oil over med-high heat. When the oil begins to glisten, pour in the sauce carefully-it may splatter a bit. Cook the sauce down for 3 to 5 minutes or until the liquid at the edges has evaporated. Salt to taste.",
      "To finish the dish:\r\n\r\nPreheat oven to 350\u00b0 F. Place the stuffed chiles in an appropriate-sized baking dish that has been lightly oiled, and cover loosely with foil, matte side out. Warm in oven 12 to 15 minutes. Warm the tomato sauce separately.",
      "Puddle about 1/3-1/2 cup of sauce on each plate, and place the stuffed chile on top. If desired, drizzle with sour cream thinned with cream or milk, or , if you can get it, Mexican crema to serve."

Turn the Brussels sprouts so that they're all cut-side down. Sprinkle salt over both trays, about half a teaspoon on each. Put both trays into the oven and roast until the outer leaves of the sprouts are very dark brown, and the underside of the squash is brown and crispy, about 20 minutes depending on your oven. Pour off excess oil immediately after removing the vegetables from the oven to prevent it being absorbed.",

In a mixing bowl, whisk the garlic with the egg yolk and half a teaspoon of water. Using a hand or electric whisk, keep whisking vigorously while dribbling in the oil, drop by drop. As the oil is absorbed, the mixture will emulsify, becoming opaque and thick. Keep whisking and dribbling until all the oil is incorporated.",

      "While the bread cubes are drying and cooling make your custard. Warm the half-and-half in a microwave safe measuring cup or bowl to about 100-110 degrees, then mix in 2 tablespoons melted butter, coffee, and rum. In a large mixing bowl whisk your egg yolks, remaining sugar, molasses, salt, remaining ginger, and the rest of the spices together. Once combined, whisk in the half-and-half mixture. Add the remaining 8 cups of bread crumbs and toss to coat. Transfer mixture to a 9 by 13-inch baking dish, making sure bread cubes are evenly dispersed. Let the mixture stand for about 30 minutes, occasionally pressing on the cubes to ensure they are fully saturated.",
      "While the custard mixture is standing, break the remaining bread cubes into very coarse crumbs. Once the bread pudding is ready, sprinkle the bread crumbs evenly over the surface, and lightly press them into the custard. Brush the surface with the remaining 2 tablespoons melted butter, then sprinkle the ginger sugar over the top.",
      "Bake on upper middle rack for 45-50 minutes, until most of the pudding has puffed up, and no liquid is released when you gently push on the center of the pudding. Switch oven to broiler setting, and broil top of pudding until it gets golden brown. Once it starts to sizzle, keep a close eye on it so it doesn't burn. Transfer to a wire rack and cool at least 45 minutes. Can be served warm or cold."

Place peppers in a small heatproof bowl and cover with hot water. Allow to soften for about 30-45 minutes.",

Cover with grill lid and cook approximately 20 minutes. Flip pieces over and cook, covered, for about 15-20 minutes more. Stir the sauce and baste chicken parts with brush. You may move parts over coals to finish cooking, turning and basting with sauce (the solids will have settled to the bottom of the sauce; spoon the spices and ground peppers up, draining briefly, to spread over the skin). When internal temperature of breast meat reaches 160\u00b0, (170\u00b0 for thighs), remove from grill to a platter and allow to rest for 5-10 minutes. Discard basting sauce.",

When they soften slightly, add to the oil. Add garlic, minced. Remove chicken from the bone (three to four pieces will serve 3-4 people. When pepper an onions are soft and browning slightly, add the chicken. Sprinkle with salt and freshly-ground pepper to taste. Toss to warm; add 1 cup of chicken broth , water from boiled vegetables or plain water and 1 teaspoon soy sauce; simmer until reduced and thickened.

    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "Heat the oven to 350\u00b0 F.",
      "To make the cake: Cut the banana peels into 1-inch pieces and place them in a small saucepan with 1 cup of water. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce the heat and simmer for 10 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and allow the mixture to cool slightly, then strain the banana peels, reserving 1/4 cup of the cooking water.",
      "Meanwhile, butter and flour the sides of two 8-inch round cake pans and line the bottoms with parchment paper. Butter and flour the pans again to coat the paper.",
      "Transfer the peels and the 1/4 cup of cooking water to a tall, narrow container and puree with an immersion blender until completely smooth (a mini food processor would do the trick, too!).",
      "Cream together the butter and sugar in a large bowl using an electric mixer (or a wooden spoon for an arm workout) until pale and fluffy, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the egg yolks one at a time, mixing until incorporated, and scraping down the sides of the bowl after each addition. Mix in the banana peel mixture, then stir in the buttermilk until well-combined.",
      "In a medium-size bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt. Add the dry ingredients to the bowl with the butter mixture and stir gently, just until combined.",
      "Put the egg whites in another bowl (make sure it's clean and dry!) and whisk until soft peaks form-either by hand or with the whisk attachment on an electric mixer. If using an electric mixer, start slowly and gradually increase speed to medium-high. You're done when you pull out the whisk or beater and a soft peak is formed, but immediately collapses. Gently fold the egg whites into the batter and divide the batter evenly between the two prepared pans.",
      "Bake, rotating the pans halfway through, until the tops are golden and a toothpick inserted into the center of each cake pulls out with dry crumbs rather than wet batter, about 25 minutes. Let the cakes cool completely in the pans.",
      "When the cakes are completely cool and you're ready to assemble, make the frosting: Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over low heat. Stir in the brown sugar and cook, stirring constantly, for 2 minutes. Stir in the milk, raise the heat to medium-high and cook, stirring constantly until the mixture boils. Remove from the heat and let cool to lukewarm. Gradually whisk in 1 3/4 cups powdered sugar, beating until smooth. If the frosting is too thick, add more of the milk; if it's too loose, slowly add the additional powdered sugar, until it reaches a spreadable consistency. Use the frosting immediately, as it will begin to thicken and stiffen as it sits.",
      "To remove the cake from the pans, invert one cake pan on a serving plate, lift off the pan, and peel off the parchment. Repeat for the second cake pan. Put one layer of the cake on a serving platter and spread about one third of the frosting evenly over the top Set the other layer on top, and spread the remaining frosting over the top and sides of the cake.",
      "NOTE: Banana peels contain some of the same proteins found in latex, and could cause an allergic reaction. Those same proteins might also make your immersion blender feel slightly gummy to the touch. Rub the surface down with cooking oil, and then wash it normally. As with any fruit or vegetable where you're eating the peels, it's a good idea to buy organically grown and scrub them well."

Add a pinch of salt and a few grindings of black pepper. Cover with about an inch of water and bring to a boil over medium heat. Decrease the heat so that the stock simmers gently while the turkey roasts, for at least one hour. Just be sure the liquid doesn't boil away (add more if necessary). Strain the stock.",
      "When the turkey is done, remove it from the roasting pan and set it on a platter to rest for a while before carving (at least 30 minutes.) Pour all the drippings--the juices and fat-- from the roasting pan into a large (4 cup) Pyrex measuring cup or glass bowl. Let it rest for about 5 minutes to allow the fat to separate and rise to the top. Skim off and discard the fat.",
      "Pour about 1 cup of the turkey stock you made in step one into the roasting pan and stir with a whisk to release all the brown bits from the bottom of the pan. Add the turkey drippings (now de-fatted) to the pan and stir some more. Strain all of this back into the measuring cup to see how much you have and to rid the stock of any unwanted crusty bits from the bottom of the pan. Add enough turkey stock to the measuring cup to make four cups. If you don't have enough stock, add chicken broth. Pour it into a saucepan.",
      "Mix the flour with 1/3 cup cold water until smooth, using a gravy shaker, or whisking it in a bowl to smooth out the lumps. Strain if you can't get the lumps out. Whisk this slurry into the stock and bring it to a boil. Simmer for at least 5 minutes to rid the gravy of the raw flour taste. The amount of flour depends on your taste. My view on this is that it should be fairly thin; the flour should just add a little body to the stock without making it goopy. If you want thicker gravy, repeat the flour and water exercise, and add it cautiously and in increments to the gravy. It will thicken as it cooks, so give it a little time (5 to 6 minutes) before you jump in with more flour. Season with salt and pepper."

The mixture should be smooth and velvety, not fluffy. Overbeating the batter will incorporate too much air, causing the cookies to spread when baked.",
      "Reduce speed to low and add the flour mixture in 3 batches, mixing just until dough comes together in clumps (stopping and scraping the bowl a few times with your rubber spatula), then mix in cherries and pistachios. You want all of the ingredients to be integrated without overworking / overmixing the dough.",
      "Gather and press dough together, then divide into 2 equal pieces. Form each piece into a log about 1.5-inches in diameter, using plastic wrap as an aid. (If you want rectangular instead of circular cookies, square off long sides of each log). Tightly wrap each log in plastic wrap, then chill in the refrigerator until very firm, at least 2 hours. (Dough can be refrigerated up to 3 days or frozen for a month; if freezing, wrap the logs first in plastic wrap, then in foil -- or place in a freezer bag. Thaw in refrigerator before using.)",

      "Brush egg white evenly over each log, avoiding the ends. On a separate piece of parchment or wax paper, sprinkle coarse sugar and press bars into the sugar, turning to coat well and evenly, avoiding the ends. Cut each log crosswise into 1/4-inch slices. If dough gets sticky or too soft, return to refrigerator until firm. Arrange cookies 1-inch apart on lined baking sheets.",
      "Bake cookies, switching position of sheets halfway through baking, about 14 to 18 minutes, or until light golden; start checking doneness at 13 minutes; be careful not to overbake. When done, remove the baking sheets from the oven and transfer the cookies to cooling racks. I like to do this by keeping the cookies on the parchment, and sliding the parchment onto the cooling rack. (A little trick if your cookies have spread and lost their defined shapes: take the flat edge of a table knife, cookie spatula, or the curved back of a spoon and reshape the dough while it's still hot.) Cool completely. Stored in an airtight container, the cookies will keep for about a week. Like any shortbread, they improve with a little age."

Note: The cooking times will vary depending on how thinly you slice your zucchini-if you slice them less than 1/4-inch thick, you won't need the full amount of cooking time. Know that the timing is forgiving, however-you just need the zucchini to be pliable so that they can roll into a coil.",

      "Because you have used a wire whisk to mix the ingredients, there should be a fine sheet of bubbles at the surface of the mixture. This is the key...

Most often, you will have curdled your cream by the time you realize it is cooked enough. Now follow this trick.",
      "Use a wooden spoon to make the shape of an 8 in your egg mixture in a continuous fashion to scrape both the sides and the bottom of your pan. Watch carefully the bubbles at the surface of your mixture. As the eggs start to heat and coagulate, the liquid will start imprisoning the bubbles and reducing to smaller and smaller bubbles. Watch as the bubbles diminish in size and the cream gets thicker. At the exact moment when all bubbles have completely disappeared from the surface of the milk, your cream is cooked perfectly. Pour immediately into a clean bowl, possibly over a larger bowl filled with ice and, stirring once in a while, allow to cool completely before putting in the refrigerator.",

      "Next, we will get our roast ready. With the fat side down, begin to slice down the center of the roast lengthwise. Slice down until about 1/2 inch from the bottom. Do not slice all the way through! Now spread the roast open and on each half, make two slits evenly apart, slicing down to within 1/2 inch of the bottom. Do this for the left and right sides. You should now be able to flatten your roast open.",

      "Once you have filled the cavities, gently put your roast back together again. Realize that since you've added \"stuffing\", the roast will be fatter around. Take kitchen twine (cotton) and cut 5 or 6 even length pieces long enough to go around the roast. At this point, there is a professional way of twining a roast with one single string; however, I always have problems with that, so I find it easier to just cut separate pieces. Begin by tying the ends about an inch in from each end. Be careful to not tie it too tight around so as not to squeeze the filling out. But be sure it will securely keep the roast closed up. Now that you 've done each end, tie the remaining strings around the roast, evenly apart, like the illustration. Once your roast is all tied up, cut any excess string and turn your roast over, cut side down.",

Cook over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally until the vegetables take on a color of a light caramel (amber) and become very sweet. This will likely take from between 2-3 hours. Remove from heat and let cool. This recipe will make about 4 cups of soffritto, refrigerate or freeze the balance for a future use...it will make practically ANYTHING taste better.",
      "For the lobster and stock:\r\n\r\nPull apart the three lobsters, separating the tails and claws from the bodies. Wrap the claws and tails in two layers of plastic wrap and par-cook in salted boiling water, 4 minutes for the tails, 6 minutes for the claws. Remove from the boil, cool under cold running water, unwrap and using poultry shears, remove the meat from the shells. Refrigerate the meat until ready to use, reserve the shell pieces for making the stock. (If pulling apart live lobsters makes you squeamish, place them head-first in boiling water for about 1 minute to kill them before dismembering, then proceed with the process as written). Split the bodies in half running from the eyes to the tail, remove and discard any tomalley and the head-sack from the carapace, reserve the cleaned bodies for the stock. \r\n\r\nIn a large stock pot, sweat a couple of chopped shallots, a chopped large carrot, a chopped branch of celery, and a few sprigs of fresh tarragon. Add the uncooked, split lobster bodies and cook until they have turned red. Add the reserved cooked claw and tail shells, the chopped fennel fronds (from the 2 bulbs), and a bay leaf. Cover with water, bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer and cook for about an hour, skimming scum from the surface as necessary. When done, strain through a fine mesh strainer, put 4 cups into a saucepan and reserve, freeze the rest for a future use.",
      "For the lobster spice: \r\n\r\nTake 1 teaspoon each of fennel seeds, coriander seeds, and mustard seeds and toast them lightly in a small pan. Transfer them to a spice mill along with 1 bay leaf and a pinch of cayenne pepper and grind to a powder.",
      "Pre-heat the oven to 400?. Core and slice each fennel bulb into 1/4 inch thick slices, toss with EVOO, salt and pepper, place on a baking sheet and roast until caramelized, about 25 minutes, flip slices about halfway through cooking. Place into a bowl, cover and reserve. \r\nCore and seed the red pepper, cut into long thin strips, toss with EVOO, salt and pepper and roast until soft and lightly browned, about 15 minutes. Add to the cooked fennel and reserve.",
      "When ready to make the paella, crush a pinch of saffron and add it to the stock, heat the stock until it boils, then turn the heat to low and keep it at the ready. Sprinkle the lobster meat with salt, pepper and some \"lobster spice\", cook in EVOO in the paella pan set over low-medium heat until it just firms up and is cooked though, remove from the heat and reserve. Turn the heat up to medium, slice the chourizo on a bias and add to the paella pan with another splash of EVOO if needed. Cook until nicely browned, then remove from pan and reserve. Pour off any excess fat from the sausage, then put the pan back on the heat and add the soffritto, the strained crushed tomatoes, the minced ancho chili, the pimenton, and the wine. Let cook until the alcohol from the wine has evaporated.",
      "Add the rice and half of the hot stock and stir gently to incorporate the rice. Let it sit undisturbed until the liquid has been incorporated. Add another 1 1/2 cups of stock, keeping back 1/2 cup in case you need it at the end, stir again gently, then take a quick taste and season with salt and pepper as needed. When the liquid is almost fully absorbed check the rice, and if done to your liking, pull the pan from the heat. If not, ad the remaining stock and finish cooking. When removed from the heat, quickly stir the peas and the roasted fennel into the rice. Lay the lobster, chourizo and red pepper strips on the rice in some sort of fanciful design, press into the rice to warm, then cover the pan and let rest for 10 minutes.",

      "Take the chicken out of the refrigerator, wipe off all the tiny bits of aromatic paste with a paper towel, and allow the chicken to come to room temperature. Meanwhile, put the reserved unpeeled garlic cloves in a mortar or mini chopper (I don't recommend chopping them by hand) and grind until the pulp is in coarse shards the size of a match head. Don't worry if you can't break down the skins into pieces that small. Set the garlic aside.",
      "Pour the oil to a depth of 3 inches in a large wok of Dutch oven and heat to 300\u00b0F. Line a sheet pan with paper towels and set near the stove. When the oil is hot, working in batches if needed to prevent crowding, gently lower the chicken pieces, flesh side down, into the oil, making sure they are fully submerged. When all of the chicken pieces are in the oil, the temperature will drop slightly; adjust the heat as needed to keep it between 260\u00b0F and 280\u00b0F. Deep-fry the chicken, undisturbed, until the pieces feel firm and the skin has turned light brown all over and dark brown around the edges, about 10 minutes. Turn the heat to the highest setting, turn the chicken, skin side down, and keep frying until the skin on each piece is golden brown and small cracks are visible at the \"ankles\" of the chicken, about 10 minutes. Transfer the chicken pieces, skin side up, to the prepared pan and leave to cool. If frying in batches, lower the heat to bring the oil temperature back down to 300\u00b0F and repeat the process.",
      "After the last batch of chicken has been removed from the oil, keeping the heat at the highest setting, sprinkle the pounded garlic evenly over the surface of the hot oil. Be careful, as the oil will foam up 2 to 3 inches high. Once that happens, stir down the oil promptly and swiftly with a mesh skimmer to prevent an overflow. Deep-fry the garlic, stirring constantly, until it turns the color of honey and is thoroughly crisp, less than 20 seconds. Turn off the heat and scoop every bit of the garlic out of the oil onto the prepared pan. You will need to work quickly before the residual heat burns the garlic and turns it bitter.",
      "You can leave the leg quarter whole or separate the thighs from the drumsticks at the joint. If you'd like to serve the chicken the way they do it at Polo, separate the thighs from the drumsticks at the joint and cut each thigh and each drumstick in half across the bones. (In order to avoid crushing the bones and creating dangerous shards, you need to use a large, sturdy cleaver and swift, decisive blows. Do it unthinkingly, unblinkingly like a robot.) By cutting the pieces crosswise, the muscles are shortened, which makes the meat easier to eat.",

Make sure you have some sort of drip pan underneath to catch all of the drippings so you can add them to the beans later. (If you have a big enough grill and can fit it all on, I'd also recommend smoking your chile powders, cumin, salt, pepper, etc.) Smoke until the bacon is dark brown and crispy.",
      "Next come the beans. I have a pressure cooker, so this recipe was written for that. If you don't have one, then cook the beans however you normally would, soaking them overnight or whatever. But with the pressure cooker there's no need for that. Take the unsoaked beans, add the water, smoked meats, guajillos and pasillas (and the other chiles, if you're using them) and add it all to the pot. Bring it up to high pressure, then turn down to low pressure and set a timer for 21 minutes. When the time's up, release pressure using the cool water method and return to the stove over med-low heat. (When you open the pot, it'll probably look like there's not nearly enough liquid, but once the beer, hot sauce and tomatoes come into play, it'll be perfect.)",
      "In a separate pan, saute the pepper and onions until they're brown and crispy, and deglaze with some of the beer. Scrape it all into the beans, pour in the rest of the beer and wet ingredients and add all your dry seasonings. At this point you just let it simmer away happily on low to med-low for awhile until the beans are completely softened (up to 20-30 minutes).",

Add a few good grinds of fresh black pepper to encourage clams to spit out more sand. When you are ready to cook them, remove clams by lifting out of the dirty water, scrub the shells and discard the water. Rinse out the bowl and replace clams. Place bowl near the stove.",
      "While you are cleaning your clams, start your sambal. Using a sharp knife carefully cut the mango on either side of the large oval pit. You should have two meaty halves and a third piece with the pit. Score each half lengthwise and crosswise without cutting the skin. Make the fruit pop out and easy to cut from the skin by pressing the skin side up with your thumbs, while pulling the edges away from each other with your index fingers. Slice the fruit surrounding the pit by making long cuts (stem to end) on either side and making crosswise cuts to release the fruit (see photo). Place fruit (you should have about 2 cups) in the bowl of a food processor.",

Add sake, followed immediately by the cleaned clams. Cover pan and let clams steam for 7-10 minutes (liquid should be simmering), giving the pan a good shake once during cooking time.",
      "Once all your clams have opened (discard any that have not opened) remove pan from heat and spoon in green mango sambal. Gently fold sambal into clams to combine. Serve immediately, with generous amounts of the sambal and starch of choice to soak it all up. Enjoy!",
      "Note: The color and texture of your sambal will vary depending on type and ripeness of mango used. The first time I made this my mangoes were very green - the flesh was hard and sour - but it made a beautiful and delicious lighter colored sambal. The version in the photo was using half ripe mangoes - still very tart but with softer flesh, resulting in a more orange colored sambal. Either is fine, though I think I prefer very green mangoes in it. Just be sure to save your ripe mangoes for dessert!"

      "In a large skillet, toast the sesame seeds until they just start to turn brown. Remove immediately to a small bowl.",
      "Cook the bacon in the skillet. While it's cooking, slice the scallions into 1/4\" pieces and thinly slice the garlic lengthwise.",
      "When the water in the small pot starts to boil, gently slip in the eggs. Once it's returned to a simmer, put timer on for 7 minutes.",
      "When the bacon is done, remove it; pour off all but a tablespoon of the fat.",
      "When the water in the large pot starts to boil, thoroughly rinse the soba under cold water and drop them into the pot of water. Set your timer for one minute less than the package instructions. (Mine usually take 6-7 minutes, total.) Stir the noodles gently to separate all the strands. ** If you're using larger greens, cut them into long strips and set your timer for 2 minutes before the noodles will be done. Throw them in with the noodles so they'll cook a bit before they're tossed in the skillet.",
      "While the noodles are cooking, gently saute the scallions and garlic in the skillet over medium heat. Turn the heat off. Push the aromatics to one side and add the brown sugar; give it a good stir; add the soy sauce and fish sauce and stir to blend. Turn the heat back on to low. Stir in the peanut butter and vinegar. Cook gently for about 30 seconds. Taste and add more vinegar or soy sauce, if necessary. Turn the heat off, for now.",
      "When the timer goes off for the eggs, put them in a medium bowl of very cold water. Run a bit more cold water over them after 15 seconds or so, and then let the eggs sit in the cool water.",
      "Chop the cooked bacon into 1/2\" pieces. Peel the eggs. (I do it under water, in the same bowl I used for cooling them.)",
      "When the timer for the noodles goes off, remove about 1/2 cup of the cooking liquid. Put it in the skillet, give it a good stir, add the greens to the skillet if using tiny greens, and turn the heat on to medium-low.",
      "Drain the noodles. Put them immediately into the skillet and turn the heat up to medium. Drizzle the noodles with the sesame oil and chili oil, if using, sprinkle on freshly ground black pepper, and toss. Put a lid on the skillet and turn off the heat. (This allows the sauce to soak into the noodles, as you would do with any other pasta sauce.)",

Make the sauce in the skillet, add the noodles and greens, toss well and let sit for minute, and then garnish with the eggs, bacon, sesame seeds and cilantro.",
      "If you have already-cooked eggs and bacon (and if not, why not?) simply make the noodles, use some reserved bacon fat for the sauce - or any vegetable oil if you prefer -- and you'll have this on the table, with practically no effort, in the time it takes to cook the noodles and toss with the sauce."

      "This needs to be done the night before you want to cook the jerky. First, place your beef in the freezer for one hour or so, so that it's easier to slice. After about an hour, take a sharpened knife and slice it fairly thinly, about 1/4\" slices, against the grain. Trim off any fat that you see.",
      "Next, prepare your marinade, mix it together in a bowl large enough to hold all of the sliced meat. Once ready, stir the beef into the marinade and make sure it's coated really well. Wrap it up in saran wrap, and store it in the fridge overnight.",
      "Next day, preheat your oven to 170, this is the best temperature for drying, rather than cooking, and will ensure it at least gets hot enough to kill any bacteria in the meat, rather than incubate it and make it worse.",
      "Line the bottom of your oven in tin foil, so that any drips don't make a mess of the oven. Then, lay out your beef on the oven rack as you see. It's a little tedious, but it will be worth it. Cook your beef in the oven for about 4-6 hours, depending on how good your oven works, your exact cut of meat and the slices' thickness, it's going to vary a little bit. Two very important things to keep in mind: The first, is that you must cook your jerky with the oven door held open a bit by either a crushed can or a wooden spoon, so that the air / moisture can get out. Next, about half way, you may want to flip the jerky pieces. They can be a little tricky to rebalance, but the parts touching the metal wrack won't have been exposed to the air enough to dry out. It won't be that hot in the oven, so you can stick your fingers in there alright, for the most part. But seriously, don't burn yourself. If you do, it's not my fault.",

Ideally, if time permits, once the greens are washed, they should be covered with a damp clean dish towel and stored in the fridge for at least an hour. This lets the greens really crisp up. Peel the pomegranate and deseed, removing the white membranes. (If using pomegranate juice instead of molasses, cut the pomegranate in half and juice one half on a manual citrus juicer.)",

Add the lemon juice and pomegranate molasses. Let steep for about five minutes. Add the whole grain mustard and then slowly whisk in the oil in a steady stream to emulsify. Emulsifying a vinaigrette is tricky and is easier to do in a food processor or blender but then you mush and mash up the integrity of the diced shallots. I can never decide which is better and so go back and forth. Make a decision you're comfortable with and live with it! When the dressing is finished, whisk in the herbs.",

If you squash Pavlova meringue lightly with your fingers, it will melt, not break. Ivory colour on the outside and white candy cotton texture inside. To achieve this, you need to whip the eggs to total death and then be super patient and let the meringue cook very slowly in the oven.",
      "You might also ask yourself, where to get lavender sugar? Do it yourself! 1tsp dried lavender flowers per 100g (3.5oz) of sugar... or 1tbsp per 500g (17oz) - this is what I usually do. Crush lavender flowers into dust with hand mixer, than add sugar and keep on crushing and mixing for 30 seconds. Lavender sugar is amazing, fragrance, sweet and delicious. Once you try to use lavender in baking, it opens new horizons for achieving stunning results. You can also add it to your tea instead of usual sugar. A small jar of lavender sugar - is a must have in your kitchen!",
      "Whip the egg whites at the maximum speed until they start foaming",

I use my favourite kitchen robot (max. speed) and the whole process takes only 4 minutes. If you are using a hand mixer, it might take up to 8 minutes. When ready, your mixture will be so thick and silky, so that you can make whatever shape you want and it will not deform. (For the purple colour I added three drops of purple food colorant.)",
      "Move your mixture on to the baking tray and gently form a circle, creating a small groove in the middle to fit in the cream in the end. Preheat the oven 70C/158F/fan and cook for 1.5-2 hours. Slow cooking helps preserve the colour and avoid burning or hardening it. If you are baking the meringue for the first time, just keep on opening the door of the oven and checking the substance with your finger. It should be crispy on the outside, but very fragile and squashy inside. Pavlova meringue should always stay soft and moist inside. You should be able to lift if from the baking paper quite easily; but be carful, do not break it. When ready, switch off the oven and keep it inside for another hour. I kept it there overnight - it does not dry at all.",

Put the garlic cloves in the skillet and toast for several minutes, turning, until they develop some brown spots and start to soften. Remove the rosemary leaves from the stems, chop, and add to the mortar. Add the ground coffee, red pepper flakes, coarse sea salt, and peeled garlic cloves and smash well until the cumin seeds are crushed and you've created a smooth paste. You could also use a spice grinder or small food processor to prepare the rub. Coat the lamb shanks with the paste and let sit for a few minutes to infuse the flavors while you prep the other ingredients.",

Add the ground cumin, coriander, and smoked paprika and cook for a minute until fragrant. Add the diced dates and sundried tomatoes and cook another minute. Add the red wine and cook another minute. Add the rinsed beans, the reserved tomato-flavored water and three additional cups of boiling water. Nestle the lamb shanks into the beans, pouring in any juices that accumulated and add the star anise and cinnamon stick. Salt and add more boiling water if necessary to ensure that the beans are covered by 1 inch of liquid.",

Cook for about three hours, turning the lamb shanks occasionally and adding a little water if necessary, until the beans are tender and the lamb meat is falling off the bones. Toward the end of the cooking period, you could remove the pot lid to allow more of the liquid to cook off. The dish will be quite rich from the lamb fat and benefits from degreasing. You may want to cook this a day ahead, refrigerate it overnight, and then remove the hardened fat from the surface, and the reheat. Alternatively, remove pools of liquid fat from the surface with a spoon.",

Make sure you integrate the gelatin thoroughly or you will have chunks of gelatin in your fillings! Fold 1/2 of the whipped cream into the cream cheese mixture.

Place the bottom half of the cake layer on top of the apples. Spread cream cheese filling over 2nd cake layer. Place remaining cake layer on top. If the cake domed a lot while baking, trim off the dome to make it flatter. Spread custard over the top cake layer. If any of the fillings are still not set, stick the cake into the freezer for 15 minutes. Cover and refrigerate for a few hours or overnight. Top with apples, walnuts and whipped cream garnish. Refrigerate any leftover cake."

Make sure to get off any dirt that might be clinging to the underside of the mushroom cap. Remove just the dirty end of the stem and dice or mince or chop (basically they don't have to be pretty - just chop away to make them smaller) and set aside.",
      "Pour olive oil in a pot (dutch oven, soup pot, etc) and heat on medium til the oil gets shiny - and add leeks, shallots and garlic.",
      "Sweat for 3-5 minutes until soft and opaque and add a finger full of salt and a turn or two of pepper. Then add half the crimini and button mushrooms. (Reserve the reconstituted mushrooms for later) and fold into the leeks. Once all is coated, add the remaining crimini and button mushrooms. (why half at a time? Too many in the pot at once and they get crushed and bruised)",
      "Add the potatoes and cook together - folding every now and then from the bottom to the top - turning to cook evenly another 5 minutes or so. You'll notice more liquid in the pan as the mushrooms release their liquid. Make sure the heat is still set on medium.",
      "Turn the heat up to medium high for - oh - 30 seconds and allow the mixture to settle - then push the mushrooms to one side and add half the vermouth. It should sizzle alittle and smell great. Scrape the bottom of the pan for anything that might have gotten stuck there. If the vermouth disappears quickly - add a little more. You can use the whole amount - or just this little bit.",
      "Drain the reconstituted mushrooms saving the liquid and add that liquid to the pot. Stir so everything combines.",
      "Add the rest of the stock. At this point you may decide to add more stock (for a lighter, thinner soup) or slightly less stock (for a richer, thicker soup). Then add some more salt (mushrooms seem to absorb salt, so you'll likely add more than usual), some more pepper, and half the thyme.",
      "Let bubble just alittle, reduce heat to low, cover... and walk away for a while... 20 minutes or so will do.",
      "Turn off the burner and remove from the heat. Now at this stage you can either use a food processor or as I prefer, the hand immersion blender. Put a dishtowel over half of the pot (to protect you from hot, flying mushroom pieces) and starting slowly - begin to blend mushrooms into the broth. Once you have gotten most of the solids, increase the speed and blend to your desired thickness. I happen to like it more on the chunky side than the silky side. *If you want it to be more \"silky\" - use the food processor. But work in batches and make sure you're closing it tightly as the soup is hot and you can burn yourself with the liquid or the steam.",
      "Now, here comes the thickness choice. If you want it thinner, just leave it alone. If you want it to have a little more uhumph, put 2 tablespoons of flour into a cup, and add alittle soup slowly (maybe 4 tablespoons) and stir quicky - getting rid of any lumps and add it SLOWLY to the soup. This will thicken the soup.",
      "Once you have the desired thickness (if you want it even thicker, add another 2 tablespoons SLOWLY - too much flour will make it taste...floury) it's time to season. Add alittle more nutmeg, salt and pepper - again to taste. Add the remaining thyme. Now - taste it. This next ingredient is absolutely optional - but I like the slight bite of acidity. Add a splash of wine wine vinegar and stir. Taste. If you want more of a bite - add just another SMALL splash. That should be enough.",
      "Remember the other mushrooms? Chop these up into small pieces and toss into soup.",
      "At this point, let it cook on low for another 5-10 minutes so all the herbs and spices relax into it. Then - grab a ladle and serve. If you'd like, add a dollop of creme fraiche - pull a hot loaf of crusty bread out of the oven and enjoy!"

      "Mix the flours to make 1250 grams of 50/50 flour blend. Use this blend to feed your culture and develop your starter.",
      "To make your starter, in a medium bowl, place 300 grams of slightly warm (80 to 85\u00b0 F, 26 to 29\u00b0 C) water. Add 315 grams of flour blend (reserve the remaining flour blend), and mix with your hand or a wooden spoon to combine until the mixture is free of any dry bits. Cover the mixture with a clean, dry kitchen towel or cheesecloth and let stand at warm room temperature until bubbles start to form around the sides and on the surface, about 2 days. It's important to maintain a warm temperature. Let stand another day to allow fermentation to progress a bit. More bubbles should form. This is your starter. It will smell acidic and slightly funky. At this stage it's time to train your starter into a leaven by feeding it fresh flour and water at regular intervals.",
      "Feed the starter: Transfer 75 grams of the starter to a clean bowl and discard the remainder of the starter. To the 75 grams of starter, add 150 grams of the 50/50 flour blend and 150 grams warm (80 to 85\u00b0F, 26 to 29\u00b0C) water. Mix to combine; it should have the consistency of pancake batter. Repeat this feeding process once every 24 hours at the same time of day, always transferring 75 grams of the starter to a clean bowl and discarding the remainder, then adding the flour and water and re-covering the bowl with a clean, dry kitchen towel after each feeding and letting the mixture stand at warm room temperature. The batter should start to rise and fall consistently throughout the day after a few days of feedings. As the starter develops, the smell will change from ripe and sour to sweet and pleasantly fermented, like yogurt. Once this sweet lactic character is established and the fermentation (the regular rise and fall of the batter) is predictable, a few days to one week, it's time to make the leaven from this mature starter.",
      "Leaven is the portion of prefermented flour and water that will go into your final dough and raise the whole mass during the bulk (first) and final rises. Two days before you want to make bread, feed the matured starter twice daily, once in the morning and once in the evening (the process described above) to increase fermentation activity. When you are ready to make the dough, discard all but 1 tablespoon of the matured starter. To the remaining 1 tablespoon, add 200 grams of the 50/50 flour blend and 200 grams warm (80 to 85\u00b0F, 26 to 29\u00b0C) water. This is your leaven. Cover and let rest at moderate room temperature for 4 to 6 hours.",
      "To test the leaven's readiness, drop a spoonful into a bowl of room temperature water. If it sinks, it is not ready and needs more time to ripen. When it floats on the surface or close to it, it's ready to use to make the dough.",
      "To maintain the leaven for regular use, continue feeding daily as described above. To save leaven for long periods without use, add enough flour to make a dry paste and keep covered in the refrigerator. When you want to use it again, keep at warm room temperature for at least 2 days and do three to four feedings to refresh and reduce the acid load that builds up while it is stored in the refrigerator.",
      "To make the dough/premix, in a large mixing bowl, combine the flours and wheat germ. In a second, large mixing bowl, add 700 grams of water. Add the leaven to the water and stir to disperse. Add the flour mixture to the liquid-leaven mixture and stir to combine until no dry bits remain. Cover and let the premix rest for at least 30 minutes and up to 4 hours to hydrate during this rest period, taking care to keep the mixture where it is at warm room temperature. After autolyse (or the rest), add the salt and the remaining 50 grams of slightly warm water, folding the dough on top of itself to incorporate.",
      "For the bulk rise, transfer the dough to a medium bowl and keep covered to maintain a warm dough temperature of 80 to 85\u00b0 F (26 to 29\u00b0 C) to accomplish the first rising time, 3 to 4 hours. During the bulk rise, the dough is developed by folding and turning it in the container. Fold the dough every 30 minutes for the first 2 1/2 hours of bulk rising. To do a fold, dip one hand in water, grab the underside of the dough, stretch it out, and fold it back over itself. Rotate the container one-quarter turn and repeat three to four times. When you are folding the dough, note its temperature to the touch and how the dough is becoming aerated and elastic. Fold in the cooked oat porridge, almonds, and almond oil gently by hand after the first two series of turns, about 1 hour into the bulk rise. After 3 hours and six foldings, the dough should feel aerated, billowy, and softer. You will see a 20 to 30 percent increase in volume. If not, continue bulk rising for 30 minutes to 1 hour longer.",
      "When the dough is 20 to 30 percent increased in volume, billowy, and elastic, remove it from the container with a dough spatula. We don't \"punch\" the dough down tode-gas at Tartine. We strengthen the dough by using gentle folds and turns. As flavor develops during the first rising, it is key to preserve that flavorful gas built up within the dough until the bread is baked. Lightly flour the top surface of the dough and cut into two pieces using the dough spatula. Work each piece gently into a round by drawing the spatula around the side of the dough in a circular motion. Surface tension builds as the dough anchors to the surface while you rotate and work it. Again, take care to work the dough gently to preserve the flavorful gasses that have formed during fermentation. When well shaped, the dough should have a taut, smooth surface.",
      "For the bench rest, lightly flour the tops of the rounds, cover with a kitchen towel, and let rest on the work surface for 20 to 30 minutes. Line two medium baskets or bowls with clean, dry kitchen towels and dust generously with a 50/50 mixture of any wheat and rice flours. Starchy rice flour (whether white or brown) is more absorbent than wheat flour and keeps the dough from sticking to the cloth-lined rising basket. Tapioca flour can also be used.",
      "For the final shaping, slip the dough spatula under each piece of dough and flip it, floured-side down. Pull the bottom of the dough up to fold into one-third of the round. Pull each side and fold over the center to elongate the dough vertically. Fold the top down to the center and then fold the bottom up over the top fold-down, leaving the seam underneath. Let the dough rest for a few minutes, seam-side down, so that the seam seals.",
      "For the final rising, transfer the dough to the floured baskets, flipping the dough over so that the seam-side is facing up and centered. Coat the loaf with the cracked oat flakes by rolling the smooth side of the dough in the coating before transferring it to the floured rising baskets, placing the dough coated-side down, seam-side up. Cover with a clean, dry kitchen towel and let rise at warm room temperature for 3 to 5 hours or overnight in the refrigerator.",
      "Twenty minutes before you are ready to bake the bread, preheat the oven to 500\u00b0F (260\u00b0C), adjust the oven rack to its lowest position, and place a 9 1/2-in/24-cm round cast-iron Dutch oven, 11-inch oval cast-iron Dutch oven, or any other heavy ovenproof pot with a tight-fitting lid into the oven to preheat (with its lid on). Carefully transfer one dough round into the pre-heated Dutch oven, tipping it out of the basket into the pot so it is now seam-side down. Score the top of the dough with a razor blade or cut with scissors. Cover the pot and return to the oven. After 20 minutes, reduce the oven temperature to 450\u00b0F (230\u00b0C). Bake another 10 minutes, then carefully remove the lid (a cloud of steam will be released). Continue to bake for another 20 to 25 minutes, until the crust is a deep golden brown. When it's done, turn the baked loaf out onto a wire rack to cool. To bake the second loaf, raise the oven temperature to 500\u00b0F (260\u00b0C), wipe out the Dutch oven with a dry kitchen towel, and reheat with the lid on for 15 minutes. Repeat the baking procedure as with the first loaf."

      "NOTE: As a time saver, I like to start these biscuits in the bowl of a food processor. If you don't have one, make sure you mix the dry ingredients together thoroughly with a whisk. It's important to make sure the baking powder and yeast are evenly distributed into the flour. Use either a pastry blender, two knives, or your fingers to rub the butter and coconut oil into the flour.",
      "Place the flours, baking powder, instant yeast, and salt in the bowl of a food processor fitted with a blade. Pulse them a few times to evenly distribute the baking powder and yeast through the flours.",
      "Slice the butter into 1/2 tablespoon slabs and add to the bowl, along with the coconut oil. Pulse a few times until the butter is broken into pea-sized pieces. The best way to check this is by dipping a fork into the flour mixture a few times.",
      "Bake the sweet potato until soft (I use the microwave). Spoon out 1/3 cup of sweet potato. Place in a fine strainer and push it through using the back of a spoon. Sweet potato is thick and can be lumpy, and this straining will give you a beautiful smooth result. It should also by cool enough now to add the wet ingredients.",
      "Add the egg, buttermilk, and honey. Stir thoroughly using a whisk. Add the cardamom and whisk a few more times. If your cardamom is older, you might want to add a little more. You should have a nice smooth batter to add to the flour mixture.",
      "Form a well in the middle of the flour with your hand, and pour half of the batter into it. Using a spatula, combine the mixture by folding the flour into the batter. Add the remaining batter and continue to mix into the flour mixture.",
      "As soon as the flour and batter are fully integrated, it's time for the first rise. The dough is very sticky, so don't knead it yet. Cover the bowl with plastic and allow the dough to rise until it's almost doubled (about 1 1/2 hours). My favorite place to put dough for a rising is the microwave. I place a hot cut of water in the microwave with it so that it's nice and warm and safe from drafts.",
      "Lightly oil a clean bowl and move the dough to it. the process of doing this will punch it down. Cover the dough with plastic, fitting the plastic wrap loosely around the mound of dough, and slide the bowl into the refrigerator. I leave it there overnight, but if you're in a rush, leave it in the refrigerator for at least four hours.",
      "Lightly flour a work space and lay the dough on it. Knead it a few times (10 - 20 times at the most) to get a smooth dough, adding a little flour as needed.",
      "Place the dough on a piece of parchment or wax paper and roll it out into a square or rectangular shape, about 3/4? thick.",
      "Line a baking sheet with a fresh piece of parchment paper. Slice the dough into large squares, approximately 3? square. Cut each square diagonally in half to form two triangles per square. Place them on the parchment lined baking sheet, 1? apart from each other. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and place in a warm area of your kitchen to rise for an hour. They should be 1? to 1 1/4? inch high.",
      "Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. I always have a baking stone in my oven, but it's not critical. The benefit of a baking stone is that it can evenly heat the baking sheet and reduce problems with uneven heat. If you're using one, place it on the center rack, or one rack down from the center.",
      "Bake for 10 minutes and increase the heat to 400 degrees F. Bake another 5 - 10 minutes. The surfaces should be a little more than lightly browned. If you have a temperature probe, the internal temperature of the biscuits should reach 200 degrees F.",
      "Allow to cool slightly and serve warm.",
      "I find I don't need any extra honey and butter on them, but you can serve these on the side when you bring them to the table."

While it's warming, build your fire: two equal piles of charcoal briquettes on either side of a grill (barrel grills or other rectangular ones work best, though you can also use a kettle style smoker). Let the coals burn until they're covered with grayish white ash. Put the butt in between the two piles, so it gets indirect heat from both sides.",

You can probably get by with adding coals twice during the period of cooking.",

So please be careful. we can always add water if the batter looks a little bit too thick. We want to fry the batter to make small rounds like doughnuts. After grinding the dals, add green chillies paste, ginger paste, salt and baking soda. Let it rest for sometime. Take oil in a deep pan and pour the mixture with the help of a scoop or spoon slowly in the hot oil. Fry them till they look light golden brown. Remove and keep it on a tissue paper to drain off extra oil. These are known as \"bhallas\" or \"vadas\". Soak them into sufficient warm water for about 5 minutes. After five minutes, take them out of water one by one and squeeze between your palms to drain out the water. Don't worry about the shape from round they would be slightly flat in shape by squeezing.

      "Perhaps the only thing to fuss over here is the type of persimmons to freeze. I wouldn't use the crunchy, hard, and apple-like persimmon commonly known as Fuyu, which is great for snacking because of its sweetness and low astringency that could taste bitter or leave an unpleasant mouthfeel afterwards. A more suitable variety is Hachiya, a heart-shaped persimmon that contains very high levels of tannins, which even after ripening can still present an unpalatable bitterness or mouthfeel. Then there's the soft, mushy, and delicate Chinese persimmon that almost looks identical to Fuyu (it's flatter and apple-shaped). It also contains a certain level of tannin/astringent but less than Hachiya, so once ripened, it delivers a soft, sweet, and almost jam-like flesh with crunchy and chewy carpels.",
      "I wouldn't freeze Fuyu, period. My number one choice would be a relatively low tannin/astringent persimmon such as the Chinese variety. But if unavailable, fully ripened Hachiya will do, too.",
      "Simply freeze the persimmons until they harden (or keep in the freezer until needed). Right out of the freezer when it's still hard, rinse it under water for 10 seconds to soften the skin slightly, then peel the skin off with a peeler, like you're peeling an apple. You may need to hold the persimmon with a towel because it's so cold. Then remove the stem with a small knife.",
      "Microwave the persimmons on low (defrost mode) for 1 to 2 minutes to soften slightly. Pour coconut milk on top and serve."

      "Instructions for the sauce:\r\n\r\nPut your favorite sauce on to simmer or use one or two jars of good quality sauce. You need enough sauce to cover the meatballs. Keep it on a gentle boil.\r\n\r\nIf you're going to make my sauce then start by sauteing the onion and green pepper in a large pot with some olive oil, salt and pepper. Once the onion and pepper are soft, add the tomato products, a splash or two of vermouth, beef broth, bay leaves, oregano and sugar. Season with salt and pepper to taste and bring to a gentle boil. Turn down the heat, cover, and keep on a gentle simmer. Let simmer for at least 20 minutes for the flavors to combine. Stir from time to time.\r\n\r\nAs the sauce is cooking, proceed with making the meatballs.",
      "Instructions for the meatballs:\r\n\r\nGrate the onion and garlic into a large bowl using the smallest holes on a box grater, add all the other ingredients up to and including the salt and pepper. Be careful with how much salt you add because Parmesan cheese tends to be salty. Gently mix to combine. Form the meat mixture into small walnut sized balls.\r\n\r\nHeat a non-stick skillet on medium high heat with some olive oil. Drop the meatballs in the skillet and pan fry until browned on both sides. Don't crowd the pan. Fry in batches if you have to. There's no need to cook the center of the meatballs because they will finish cooking in the sauce. Once the meatballs are all browned on both sides, drop them into the simmering sauce. Make sure the sauce is at a gentle boil. Cook the meatballs in the sauce for about 10-15 minutes or until done in the centers. They don't take long. You want them to be cooked but still juicy. You may wish to deglaze the pan that the meatballs were cooked in with a little vermouth or wine, scraping up the browned bits. Add the deglazing liquid to the simmering tomato sauce. It gives great flavor.\r\n\r\nServe the meatballs and sauce sprinkled with chopped flat leaf parsley. Crusty bread, polenta or pasta make great sidekicks. You can also place the meatballs and sauce in an oven safe pan, top with shredded mozzarella and bake or broil until the cheese is bubbly and melted. Enjoy!"

Using sweetened coconut would, in my opinion, push this bark into cloying territory.\r\n- The chocolate is gently heated to between 100 - 110\u00b0 F in order to keep the temper of the chocolate. Reserving 1/4 of the chocolate to stir in will cool it down more quickly and also help keep it in temper. Once your chocolate it is out of temper it gets a whitish sort of \"bloom\" more quickly and will lose some of it's snap. Of course, it isn't strictly necessary to try to keep your chocolate in temper. For a slightly less fussy version, you can simply heat it all until melted and then proceed with the recipe. This option works better if you or the recipients of your bark are going to be eating it within a 2-4 days.",

Repeat that until all of the squares are filled and formed into the kiffles. Then repeat the process with the next quarter of dough, but use the cherry filling for the second tray. Brush all of the kiffles with the egg wash to help seal them and make them golden, then bake them for 10-12 minutes. They should be golden.",
      "When they are done, take them out and let them cool for 5 minutes before transferring them to cooling racks to finish cooling. While they are still warm, dust them with more powdered sugar. Repeat the whole process with the last half of the dough, making a tray of apricot and a tray of cherry. When they are all completely cooled, store them in sealed tins where they will keep for weeks in a cool place. Enjoy giving them out and eating them for the Holidays!"

Mix in the cooked vegetables and the dried tomatoes, if using.",

Slice stalks in half, once crosswise, and then once lengthwise unless they are already very thin. If needed, trim further to fit across pan. Place rhubarb in skillet in a single parallel pile, then top with 1/4 cup brown sugar, spreading sugar to even it out a bit. \r\n\r\nPlace pan over medium-low heat and cover with lid. Cook 5 minutes, remove lid, and use heatproof tongs to rotate top and bottom layers of rhubarb. (Pull the soft rhubarb up to the top and move the still-firm layer to bottom.) Cover with lid and cook another 5 minutes. Rhubarb should be very soft and juicy. Remove lid, remove pan from heat, and set aside.",

Peel the banana and mash it well with a fork until no longer lumpy, then measure it: you need between a heaping 1/3 cup and a scant 1/2 cup mashed banana (if yours yields much more than this, be sure to use no more than a scant 1/2 cup). \r\n\r\nRinse and finely zest the orange; set zest aside. Juice the orange and measure out 1/4 cup juice, with any seeds discarded. Set aside. Heat a kettle of water.",
      "In a large bowl, beat 2/3 cup brown sugar and 1/3 cup vegetable oil. Add the vanilla, the mashed banana, and the grated ginger root. Mix well. Sift over the mixture: powdered ginger, flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Begin to mix (batter will be thick), gradually adding the 1/4 cup orange juice and the boiling water. Beat well, scraping sides and bottom of bowl with spatula. Finally, fold in the orange zest until evenly distributed. \r\n\r\nJust before pouring batter into the skillet, gently rearrange rhubarb, pulling it to edges of the pan to ensure the bottom of the cake is completely covered in a single layer of rhubarb with no blank spaces. Slowly pour batter over rhubarb and place skillet in oven.",
      "Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center of the cake comes out batter-free (a few moist crumbs are OK). Remove from oven, being careful not to touch hot skillet handle unprotected. Let sit at least 30-45 minutes or until pan is cool enough to grasp. \r\n\r\nJust when ready to serve, loosen edges of cake with a knife, and invert onto a plate. If cake has completely cooled or is the least bit stubborn about coming out of pan, place over medium heat on stovetop for 30 seconds before flipping. The cake is best served right away, but feel free to store it covered and refrigerated, eating within 24 hours."

      "Make the dough - this is a very sticky process, but the stickier the dough, the lighter the gnocchi. Put the mashed potatoes in the mixer using the dough hook. Add the semolina, flour, and the eggs. Mix well. The dough doesn't have to come off the walls of the bowl. It just needs to be firm enough to handle. I would say - look for the consistency of a firm paste. Put in the fridge for 30 minutes or while you are making the custard.",
      "Make the custard\r\nPut the milk and two thirds of the sugar in a pan and gently bring to the boil. In the meantime, whisk the egg yolks and the rest of sugar until they become pale. Gently pour the boiling milk on to the egg yolks, whisking very quickly. Put this mixture back in the pan and simmer gently (do not boil it) stirring all the time. The custard is ready when it has thickened slightly. Leave to cool.",
      "Make the gnocchi \r\nStart by putting a lot of flour on your hands, take one handful of the sticky dough and pat down quickly in one hand. Add more flour to your hands if needed. Take one prune, place it in the middle of the dough and close quickly. Shape the dough in a tight ball. Put aside on a floured plate. Repeat until you use all the dough. The size of the gnocchi should be just a little bigger than a table tennis ball. But it is up to you.",
      "When they are all done, bring a pan of water to the boil. Add one teaspoon of bicarbonate. Submerge 3-4 balls at the time. When they start floating, they are ready. Take them out and immediately roll in breadcrumbs, coating them well. Set aside in a tray.",
      "Tip: don't panic if the dough is too sticky. If this is the first time you make gnocchi, add a little more flour to the point where you are confident you can work with the dough. The end result will just be a bit tighter. In time, you will learn to work with a stickier consistency and notice the difference.",
      "It can get frustrating to shape the gnocchi but remember, there is no right or wrong way, just be persistent, the dessert will come together after the boiling stage.",

      "Preheat the oven to 400F. Peel the squash using a potato peeler. I use the type with a handle in the middle, allowing me to pull the peeler towards me.

Roast until tender - about 20 - 25 minutes.",
      "Rinse the seeds, removing all squash particles from them. Dry them completely. Toss them in enough olive oil to coat them and sprinkle 1/8 tsp salt, chipotle pepper, cayenne pepper and onion salt. Toss with a fork and place in an open foil packet. Roast in the oven with the squash until crispy - about 10 minutes.",
      "Melt the butter in a medium frying pan until simmering. Once the water content of the butter boils off, remove the milk fats floating on top of the butter oil with a metal spoon. Try to remove as much as possible so that you have a completely clear butter. Continue to heat in order to brown the butter a few shades. I go to a soft golden brown. Throw the sage leaves in using a metal spoon to make sure they are completely covered with the browned butter oil. They should be finished frying within a couple minutes. Reduce the heat to low to keep warm. (This step can be done ahead and rewarmed, but keep the butter and sage in the pan - don't try to remove the leaves as they can be quite fragile.)",
      "Remove the squash from the oven when tender and place in a serving bowl. Pour the browned clarified butter with the sage leaves over the squash, getting good coverage. Sprinkle the spicy seeds on top."

Heat 11/2 tablespoons of the olive oil in a pan over high heat. Add the onions (you should hear them sizzle). After a minute or two, lower the heat to medium-low and cook the onions until brown and caramelized, about 10-12 minutes. Stir in the barbecue seasoning, soy sauce, and Worcestershire sauce. Let the flavors blend over low heat for about 10 more minutes. (At this point, the onions are ready to serve. However, you can let them sit longer if necessary. If they start to lose their shape, turn off the heat. You can reheat them over medium heat when everything else is ready.)",
