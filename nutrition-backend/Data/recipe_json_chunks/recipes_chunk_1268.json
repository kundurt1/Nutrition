Remove from the heat, then spoon 2-3 tablespoons into the beaten egg yolks, stirring briskly, then whisk egg mixture back into the saucepan. Return to the stove top, and bring back to a boil over medium heat, stirring all the time, then simmer for 1 min. The custard should be quite thick.",

If the mixture seems too liquidy to support the pastry pieces, then allow it to cool for a while to set. Transfer to the refrigerator and chill for 3 hours. When ready to serve, remove from the refrigerator and dust with powdered sugar. Cut into 8 slices with a sharp knife. Serve each slice on a plate with a dollop of rhubarb compote."
