      "Allow about 20 minutes for the coals to grey evenly before spreading them across the entire surface of your roast box.",
      "At this point you will begin timing the cooking process, allowing an hour before removing the ash by lifting and sifting the charcoal grid, then emptying the ash from the pan.",
      "Now you are ready to add 10 lbs.",
      "of fresh charcoal to your Caja China grill.",
      "Allow another hour and follow the same procedure to remove the ash and add new charcoal.",
      "After the third hour, it is time to flip the pig!",

      "of fresh charcoal to your Caja China / Cajun Microwave.",
      "This time you should only need about 45 minutes to crisp the skin.",
      "A good idea is to score the skin to allow some of the juices to be rendered from the fat during cooking.",
      "Once the skin has reached a bronze tone, you are done!",
      "If you have a meat thermometer, check the temperature of the meat.",
      "The desired temperature for cooking to be complete is about 180 degrees.",
      "One of the greatest attributes of La Caja Asadora (Spanish for The Roasting Box) is its ability to function like a huge pressure cooker, and complete a whole pig roast in just 4 hours!",
