      "Put the bowl in the steamer tray and set aside to marinate for 15 minutes.",
      "Fill the steamer pan halfway with water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat.",
      "Add the steamer tray, cover, and steam the quail for 9 to 11 minutes, or until there is no visible sign of pink rawness at the breast end.",

      "Repeat with the remaining quail, adding the remaining 1/4 cup cornstarch to the bag as needed.",
      "Set the quail aside for about 3 hours.",

      "(If you dont have a thermometer, stand a dry bamboo chopstick in the oil; if small bubbles immediately gather on the surface around the chopstick, the oil is ready.)",

      "With a skimmer in one hand and a large spoon in the other, lower a quail into the hot oil.",
      "Then immediately spoon the hot oil over the quail so that it fries to a nice, even brown.",
      "This only takes 30 to 45 seconds.",
      "To make sure the quail is browning evenly, occasionally use both utensils to lift and dip or rotate it in the oil.",
      "Because the color deepens slightly once the quail is out of the pan, pull it from the oil when it is just shy of a rich brown.",
      "Balance it between the skimmer and spoon as you lift it out, letting any excess oil drip back into the pan, and then return the quail to the rack.",
      "Repeat with the remaining quail.",

      "These quail may be reheated in a preheated 350F oven or toaster oven.",
      "Halve them first and put them cut side down to reheat.",
      "They are ready when you can hear them gently sizzling, usually about 10 minutes.",
