Divide the tin cavity in half by pulling up the centre of the parchment and folding a tall pleat to separate the halves. Make sure the pleat is as close to the centre as possible.",

      "In a separate bowl, combine the flour and ground almonds. Gradually add the dry mixture to the wet mixture until a thick batter forms, then scoop half the mixture into a separate bowl.",

      "Use a serrated knife to trim the edges off the cooled sponges. Carefully cut the sides that have coloured in the oven, as they can look off-putting if used in the Battenberg. Measure the height of the baked sponge with a ruler and slice the cake into strips the same width as the height, forming a square cross section. Mine are usually 2 x 2cm. This will create perfect squares that stack properly on top of one another.",
      "Gently warm the lime marmalade in a small saucepan to loosen it and make it easier to spread, then pass it through a sieve. Stick one lemon strip of cake and one lime strip together using some of the lime marmalade, then stack the alternate colour on top of the bottom layer to create the chequerboard effect with the four strips.",
      "Lightly dust the worktop with icing sugar, then roll out the marzipan into a large rectangle, trimming the edges so the rectangle is approximately 18 x 20cm. Brush the top and sides of the assembled cake with the remaining marmalade, then place top-side down on to the marzipan along the short edge. Brush the face-up side of the cake with more marmalade before tightly rolling it up in the marzipan until it is covered. Press in the final section of marzipan or trim if it looks too long.",
      "Trim the ends of the cake using a serrated knife and transfer the Battenberg to a plate or cake stand. The cake will keep for up to 1 week in an airtight container.",

      "Sang Mi's classic kim chi recipe calls for two Chinese cabbages. (This is kind of a stupid name for a Korean recipe, but that's what they're called.) Rinse the cabbages, then quarter them lengthwise, discard the stems, and then chop the cabbages laterally, which should leave you with the largest pieces measuring perhaps 5 cm on a side. Don't get too carried away while doing this.",
      "Now that we have lots of little bits of cabbage, it's time to salt them. Place the cabbage in a clean plastic bag or equivalent (with no holes) and sprinkle salt over each layer. The best kind of salt is sea salt, although non-iodized table salt will do. This will create a brine solution with the cabbage juice.",
      "To ensure the cabbage is properly salted, sprinkle salt onto your wet hands, then rub it into the cabbage pieces. Press the leaves in your hand to squeeze as much water out of them as possible. Once finished, tie up the bag and set it aside for 5-6 hours. Check it after three hours to ensure that everything is all right, stirring the mixture if necessary.",
      "Take the cabbage out of the salt solution and rinse it if necessary. It should be a lot softer than it was. Again, remove surplus water. Place cabbage in a sealable plastic box. Add the spring onions, chopped into small pieces. Crush the garlic and ginger in a press and mix inches You may also add half an onion, finely diced, if you wish. You can also omit any of these ingredients (if, say, you're allergic to garlic or hate ginger).",
      "It is also recommended to add kim chi sauce. This is the only ingredient that you can't always buy at a non-Korean supermarket. (You might prefer not to know what's in it.) There are several different kinds, many of which contain fish or other seafood such as oysters. You only need one tablespoonful - that's 15 milliliters. This bottle contains 500 ml. Even for kim chi addicts, that's a lot of kim chi. Kimchi will work without the sauce, but it helps things along.",
      "Add the chili powder. Unsurprisingly, the best chili powder for kim chi can be found at a Korean grocery store, which has a bright red color. It is possible to use other kinds of chili powder, or pureed or thinly sliced chili peppers if this is unavailable. If you use hot chili powder, you might want to reduce the amount. Add two tablespoonfuls of sugar.",
      "Mash the chili powder into the leaves as you did in much the same way with the salt. If the color doesn't seem dark enough, add more chili powder. It's a good idea to wear gloves while doing this. (Safety goggles optional.) Koreans use special kim chi gloves.",
      "This can be done as a cooperative effort. In fact, it's a smart idea if you want to avoid carpal-tunnel syndrome. Squishing cabbage can be hard work.",
      "You can make kim chi from many other vegetables. This batch of kakk du gi is made of cubed white radish, prepared in the same way as cabbage kim chi.",
      "Put the containers aside for three or four days in a cool location. No snacking. After that, store it in the refrigerator.",
      "Finally the kim chi is ready. It should be soft in consistency, but not too mushy, with a little crunchiness left in the larger pieces. You can eat it as is, or use it in your favorite Korean recipes. If you don't have a favorite Korean recipe, get one. Like I say, it makes a great stir fry. Someone wrote in to tell me he puts it on hamburgers."

      "So first, we're gonna start on the stock so it can simmer away while we make the dumplings. Take 1 1/2 carrots (saving 1/2 a carrot for later) and cut into big chunks and throw in a medium pot. Now add in 1/2 of a cabbage, roughly cut in half. Cut an onion into sections and throw that in as well. Now chop off the stems from your shiitake mushrooms and add the stems only to the pot. Fill the pot with water to the top leaving about 1 inch on the tip, add a pinch of salt and bring to a simmer on medium heat. Let that simmer for about 25 minutes and then add in the stalks from 2 bunches of cilantro. Keep the leaves for later. Let that simmer for another 20 minutes on low heat. Add more salt to taste!",
      "Step 2: The dumplings!",
      "Now take that 1/2 carrot from before and finely dice, the smaller the better. In a medium mixing bowl, add the diced carrots and diced water chestnuts. Finely slice 1 green onion stalk and add that to the bowl. In a small frying pan, drizzle a little vegetable oil and toss in the shiitake mushrooms whole. Cook until soft flipping the over several times - about 5 minutes total. Turn off heat and set aside. Once cool, finely dice the mushrooms and add to the mixture bowl. Now add in the tofu, using a fork or your hands crumble up the tofu and mix the entire thing until well combined. Add in the white pepper, pinch of salt, and a small drizzle of sesame oil - then mix again! Sprinkle the corn flour on top, toss to combine and we're ready to wrap! Take about 1/2 a tablespoon of filling and put it in the middle of the wrapper, take one corner of the wrapper and fold it so it meets the diagonal corner. Crimp down the wrapper along the filling and set aside. Continue until you run out of wrappers!",
      "Step 3: The cooking!",
      "Okay we're ready to cook everything! Keep your stock slowly simmering in the pot. You can scoop out the veggies and smash through a strainer and keep the juice if you want. Now fill a large pot 3/4 full with water and bring to a boil. This is the order you need to cook everything. Veggies, noodles then wontons. Have your Chinese broccoli cleaned, trimmed and chopped. Throw in the boiling water for about 1 -2 minutes. You just want to make sure the leaves are wilted and the stalks are cooked but still a little crunchy. Scoop the veggies out with a slotted spoon or spider scoop and set aside to drain. Now throw in the noodles to the boiling water. Cook until al dente and then remove with tongs. Drain and portion into serving bowls. Top the bowls of noodles off with the veggies.",
      "Your pot of water should be very foamy now, add in about 2 cups of water and bring to a boil again. Slowly add in your wontons by putting a few on a slotted spoon and dunkink the spoon in the water. Hold it in there for about 30 seconds and then drop them inches If you just throw them in, they will stick to the bottom of the pot! Boil them until they float to the top - that's when you know they're ready! Scoop em out and into the serving bowls with the noodles and veggies.",
      "Step 4: Garnish & serve!",
      "Okay now your serving bowls should have noodles, veggies, and wontons. Sprinkle in some sliced green onions and some ripped up cilantro leaves. Drizzle a little tiny bit of sesame oil. Now ladle in some of your vegetable stalk that's been simmering away. Done!"

Also add salt and MSG according to your taste if desired ). Stir then cover for about 2min Continue to uncover, stir, and recover until everything's cooked (pretty much when green beans are soft).",
      "Once cooked, put everything into a strainer and let drain. Prepare egg roll wrappers. Put about 1-2 spoonfull of the filling into a wrapper and roll it up. To cook egg roll: put some oil and heat up a skillet into medium heat for about 5min. Put egg rolls (with the end corner downwards) and cook until all sides are light brown. Put cooked egg rolls into strainer and dab egg rolls with tissue to remove excess oil. Serve with white rice and vinegar/garlic sauce."

Cook over medium heat for about 5 minutes, until the mushrooms are tender and they release some of their juices. If they become too dry, add a little more oil. Toss occasionally to make sure the mushrooms cook evenly. Repeat with the remaining mushrooms and set all the mushrooms aside.",
