Add the cold rice and the peas and carrots and let it all warm at high temperature and break up the big pieces of rice. It's ok for there to be some clumps of rice remaining. It is important your rice is cold when you start or the fried rice will get gluey and mushy. Day old rice is best, but if you want to make your rice fresh and then fry it, cook the rice and put in a flat baking pan in the freezer to cool for 30-60 minutes first.",

Never use canned veggies, and ones that release water (like tomatoes, mushrooms, zucchini, squash) can be tricky, because your rice can get mushy. Fresh carrots, broccoli, snap peas, bell pepper, frozen/fresh corn have been tried and all work."

Saute the shallot and cook just a minute until it softens slightly. Add the brandy (make sure you remove from the burner when you do this) return and then cook just a few seconds. Then add in the cream and boil for 2-3 minutes. Remove from the heat and transfer to a small bowl. I just keep it at room temperature unless you make it the morning of, then you can refrigerate. But make sure you bring to room temp before you make your scallops.",

At this point, make sure you take your sauce and apples out of the refrigerator if you made them earlier that day. You want to make sure they are room temperature.",

In a small bowl, add the bread crumbs, salt and pepper and dip each side of the scallop lightly in the mixture. Then in large saute pan NON stick heat to medium high to high heat and add the olive oil. Add the scallops (don't over crowd, you want a nice dark brown sear) and cook until nicely brown on each side. They will only take about 2 minutes per side. It may take 2 batches depending on the size of your pan. Remove to a plate and cover with foil as you make the sauce.",
      "Part 2 -- After removing the scallops, reduce the heat to medium and add the apple cider and thyme to the pan and scrape up all the bits on the bottom. Boil 1 minute until the cider reduces a bit and all the bits are scraped up. Then add you room temp brandy sauce and bring to a boil. Cook 1 minute and remove from the heat.",
      "Spinach, Apples and Pears -- Last components. I just reheat my apples/pears in the microwave for just a minute before plating.",
      "And as for the spinach, I just put in a large bowl and toss with a teaspoon of olive oil, salt and pepper. Then toss and cover with plastic wrap and cook 1 minute. You don't want it completely wilted, just lightly sauteed.",

When a toothpick comes out clean from the center, then it's done. The cake should be fluffy, but more cohesive than regular cake. It won't fall apart. Almost reminds me of a sponge, but fluffier -- Tastes good though.",
      "The cake I made was in a glass rectangle pan (not very wide), and it came out an inch thick. For my purposes that was fine, but if you want a taller cake, it would be a good idea to make two and have the cake be two layers to make up height. If you can find a good sugar free frosting recipe or put sugar free pudding in the center between layers that would make it even better. Or if you can double the recipe. I don't know how that works. I think it involves math of some kind, something about not doubling the salt or sugar or something."

      "Notes: The outcome of soup really depends on the quality of the chicken base you use. I have found that broth is too weak for the most part, so I highly recommend avoiding broth for this recipie. I have found better success with bullion. The bullion gives you control over the strength of the chicken flavor. If you have a good chicken base, the soup will be good. If you have bad bullion/broth, the soup will be sub-par. A good test is tasting the broth on it's own. If it tastes like a soup you'd eat on it's own, it's a good place to start!",
      "Place 5 cups of tap water in a large pot. Set pot on stove and heat on Med-High.",

      "Cover the pot with a lid, and turn the temperature of the stove down to simmer. Set a timer for whatever the recommended cook time of the rice LESS 5 minute (So if the rice cooking instructions say 20 min, set the timer for 15).",
      "Now, in a large mixing bowl, break open three eggs and add 3 TBS of lemon juice. Lemon lovers, hold your horses at this step. You can add more lemon at the end to your lemony liking. This is just to set the eggs. Using an electric mixer on LOW, or a handheld manual mixter, thoroughly blend the lemon and egg together until very smooth. The more blended this mixture, the less likely you will have egg separate in the soup. If you are mixing by hand, make sure you get it as smooth as possible mixing very well. Allow the lemon egg mixture to rest in the bowl about 15 minutes stirring occasionally.",
      "When the timer for the broth goes off, remove the pot from the heat source. Take one cup full of the HOT chicken broth and slowly stir it into your mixing bowl containing the lemon egg mixture. Repeat this 3 times, or for as much broth as you can safely transfer.",

Let sit for at least 10 minutes before serving. Should withstand the toothpick check by poking middle with toothpick and coming out clean by the 40 minutes. If not clean then let bake another 5-10 minutes or until done in middle."

      "THE PREP WORD.",
      "1 - Mix all these ingredients together as the rub for your smoked Boston Butt. This will store for weeks in an airtight container in your refrigerator.",
      "2 - Apply a thin coat of mustard to the butt. You can use the cheap stuff or if you like it a little more tangy, use dijon mustard. The mustard provides some flavor, but also provides a base for the rub to stick to.",
      "3 - Generously rub your butt with the rub recipe above. Wrap it up and let it sit overnight in the refrigerator to allow the spices to penetrate the meat.",
      "4 - Buy a cheap spray bottle and fill it with Apple Juice and olive oil. You will spray the Boston Butt during cooking with apple juice to add flavor and to keep it moist as you cook. I recommend the dollar tree because the spray bottle will be done after this and you can buy a new one for $1.00.",
      "COOKING.",
      "1 - Heat your BBQ to 225F degrees and put your butt on the grill. Indirect heat works the best and add your favorite soaked wood chips to add the smoked flavor.",
      "2 - Plan on cooking the smoked Boston Butt about 60-90 minutes for every pound in the roast.",
      "3 - Every 2 1/2 hours, open it up and turn the roast to ensure even cooking. Use the Spray bottle to spray your roast with combination of apple juice and olive oil to keep it moist.",
      "4 - The meat is done when the internal temperature is above 190F degrees. The lower you keep the temperature, the more moist the meat will be.",
      "5 - Don't be afraid to start early because it can take longer than expected. If it gets done early, you can always wrap it in foil and put it in a cooler. It will keep warm for hours after it is done. At least let the smoked Boston Butt sit for about an hour after you take it off the grill so you don't burn your fingers as you pull the meat.",
      "6 - Serve with your favorite sides, salads, and drinks.",
      "You may consider cooking 2-3 smoked Boston Butts as your whole neighborhood will be stopping by to check what is cooking because of smells that will have tempted them all day long.",

Now put in the onions and fry them, stirring, for about 10 minutes or until they get brown and crisp (but not burned). Remove them carefully with a slotted spoon, squeezing out as much of the oil as possible. Reserve all the onion flavored oil, the black cardamoms, and the bay leaves. You will need them later.

Bring slowly to a boil, cover, lower heat, and simmer for 15 minutes. Remove only the chicken pieces, place them in a 5 quart casserole dish, and cover. Set aside. On a medium flame, boil down the marinade paste, stirring, until you have about 9 to 10 tablespoons left. Spoon the paste over the chicken. Cover again.",

After it has come to a boil again, cook 5 minutes, timing very carefully (the rice must not cook through). DRAIN the rice in a colander, then place it on top of the chicken in the casserole. Pour the saffron milk over the rice, streaking it with orange lines. Spoon out the onion flavored oil from the pan, RESERVING a level tablespoon to fry the raisins if you like. Sprinkle the oil, cardamom, and bay leaves over the rice. Cover the casserole dish with aluminum foil, cut 2 inches wider than the rim of the dish. Now put the lid on and use the protruding foil edges to seal the dish as best you can by crinkling it and pushing it against the sides. Bake 1 hour.",
      "GARNISHES: There are several garnishes that can be used for biryani; you can use them all, or only what you like, but the fried onions are a must. If you wish to use raisins, you can fry them in a tablespoon of the onion flavored oil just after you have fried the onions.",
      "TO SERVE: As you lift the cover off your casserole dish you will see beautiful saffron streaks on the white rice. Spoon the rice and chicken out onto a large platter. Sprinkle fried onions and other garnishes of your choice over, and serve hot. With biryani, serve Koftas and some yogurt dish-Yogurt with Tiny dumplings, or Yogurt with Potatoes. If you wish to serve a vegetable, Cauliflower with Ginger and Chinese Parsley would be very good. Serves 6-8.",

      "NOTE: This very expensive stigma of the crocus flower is used in Moghlai meat and rice dishes as well as in desserts. Ideally, saffron stigmas or \"leaf\" saffron should be lightly roasted in a hot skillet, crumbled, and allowed to soak in a tablespoon or so of warm milk for half an hour before being used.",

Don't toast them so darkly that they begin to smoke-that would make the mole bitter. As they're done, remove them to a large bowl, being careful to drain as much fat as possible back into the pot.

With a slotted spoon, remove to the tomatillo bowl, draining as much fat as possible back into the pot.",
      "Add the raisins to the hot pot. Stir for 20 or 30 seconds, until they've puffed and browned slightly. Scoop them out, draining as much fat as possible back into the pot, and add to the tomatillos. Set the pan aside off the heat.",
      "To the tomatillo mixture, add the cinnamon, black pepper, anise, cloves, bread and chocolate. Add 2 cups water and stir to combine.",
      "Blend, strain, cook: Into a large measuring cup, tip off the chiles' soaking liquid. Taste the liquid: if it's not bitter, discard all abut 6 cups of the liquid. (if you're short, add water to make up the shortfall). If bitter, pour it out and measure 6 cups water. Scoop half of the chiles into a blender jar, pour in half of the soaking liquid (or water) and blend to a smooth puree. Press through a medium-mesh strainer into a large bowl; discard the bits of skin and seeds that don't pass through the strainer. Repeat with the remaining chiles.",
      "Return the soup pot to medium heat. When quite hot, pour in the chile puree-it should sizzle sharply and, if the pan is sufficiently hot, the mixture should never stop boiling. Stir every couple of minutes until the chile puree has darkened and reduced to the consistency of tomato paste, about a half hour. (I find it useful to cover the pot with an inexpensive spatter screen to catch any spattering chile.).",
      "In two batches, blend the tomatillo mixture as smoothly as possible (you may need an extra 1/2 cup water to keep everything moving through the blades), then strain it in to the large bowl that contained the chiles. When the chile paste has reduced, add the tomatillo mixture to the pot and cook, stirring every few minutes until considerably darker and thicker, 15 to 20 minutes. (Again, a spatter screen saves a lot of cleanup.).",
      "Simmer: Add the broth to the pot and briskly simmer the mixture over medium to medium-low heat for about 2 hours for all the flavors to come together and mellow. If the mole has thickened beyond the consistency of a cream soup, stir in a little water. Taste and season with salt (usually about 4 teaspoons) and the sugar.",
      "You're now ready to make Lacquered Chicken or you can cool, cover and refrigerate until you're ready to use. When you're ready to proceed, rewarm the mole.",
      "Make the chicken: Heat the oven to 350 degrees.",
      "In a small (2-quart) saucepan, mix together 1 cup of the mole with the agave nectar or corn syrup. Simmer over medium heat until glossy and reduced to 1 cup, about a half hour. On rimmed baking sheets, lay out the chicken in a single layer. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Bake for 45 minutes (the chicken should be tender to the bone at this point-leg-and-thigh portions should register 165 degrees at the thickest part on an instant-read thermometer).",
      "Raise the oven temperature to 400 degrees. Tip off the juices that have collected around the chicken, then brush the pieces liberally with the glossy mole mixture. Sprinkle with the reserved sesame seeds. Bake for 10 minutes to set the glaze.",
      "Remove from the oven, let stand at room temperature for 10 minutes, then slide into a very low oven to keep warm until serving time-preferably no longer than 30 minutes.",
      "Serve each portion of chicken with about 1/2 cup of warm mole, decorated with watercress or flat-leaf parsley and sprinkled with any left over sesame seeds."

    "title": "peanut butter & jellyfish doughnuts",
    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "Before you get started, you will need: non-stick baking spray, a non-stick doughnut pan, a non-stick doughnut hole pan and a pastry or ziploc bag (for the doughnuts). For the glaze, you'll need a pastry bag and wax paper. For the decorations, you'll need a #1 piping tip, a coupler, a 2-inch circle cookie cutter, a rolling pin and toothpicks.",
      "Doughnuts: Preheat your oven to 350F Generously coat your doughnut and doughnut hole baking pans with nonstick baking spray, then set aside. In a medium-sized mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt and brown sugar. In a smaller mixing bowl, combine the peanut butter, sour cream, vanilla, egg, milk and melted butter. Add the wet ingredients to the dry, and mix until just combined (you don't want to over mix or the doughnuts won't be as light and fluff). The batter will be thick.",
      "Transfer the batter to either a large zip top bag or a piping bag (I like to use a wide mouth glass or jar to hold the bag while filling it with batter). Cut a corner off the bag, and pipe the batter into each doughnut cavity filling 3/4 full. You can use the back of a spoon if you would like to carefully smooth out the batter.",
      "Bake each pan for 8-10 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Allow the doughnuts to cool for at least 5 minutes before gently removing from the molds and transferring to a cooling rack to cool completely (I find that a toothpick helps to remove the doughnuts easily without smashing them-just place the toothpick to the side of each doughnut and use it to flip the doughnut out of the pan). I also flip the doughnuts and doughnut holes over and use the bottom to decorate.",
      "Glaze: Place the freeze-dried strawberries in a small zip-top bag, and use either a rolling pin or the bottom of a drinking glass to crush them into a powder-like consistency. In a small mixing bowl, combine the powdered sugar, crushed strawberries, jelly and 2 tablespoons milk (I like to use a fork to whisk them together and also break up the jelly a little). You can add more milk, a tablespoon at a time, if the consistency is too thick. Either gently dip the tops of the doughnuts and doughnut holes into the glaze, or use a spoon to spread the glaze onto each doughnut. Place them onto a baking sheet lined with wax or parchment paper so the glaze can set. This recipe makes extra glaze, so feel free to add a generous amount to each doughnut (you can even roll the entire doughnut hole in the glaze).",
      "Jellyfish Decorations: Now for the fun part! If you haven't already eaten all of your PB&J doughnuts you can turn the doughnut holes into cute jellyfish. I like to work on these while the glaze is setting up.",
      "Start by coloring 5 ounces of the fondant with just a little sky blue icing gel. Separate about an ounce, or a 2-3 inch ball, out and set it aside (cover it with a bowl so the fondant doesn't dry out). Create 6 balls of the sky blue fondant, about 2 1/2 inches in diameter and roll them out until about 1/8 inch thick (you want it thin enough that it's pliable, but not so thin that it'll rip).",
      "Place a doughnut hole, glazed side down, on top of the fondant and fold the fondant around it. Gently roll the covered doughnut hole, in your hands, to smooth the edges. Repeat this process with the other doughnut holes and set them aside.",
      "To create the scalloped edge under the jellyfish, roll the remaining sky blue fondant out to about 1/8 inch (except for the piece you set aside after coloring) and use the 2-inch cookie cutter to cut out 6 circles.",
      "Gather all the fondant scraps into a ball, and add more sky blue icing gel to create a darker blue. Use the darker blue fondant, and the lighter piece that you set aside earlier to create the tentacles (I made 7-8 per jellyfish). Take a small piece of fondant from each color, roll it out into a rope or spaghetti like shape, and then gently curl and twist each strand. If your fondant is sticky you can use a little cornstarch to coat your fingers and the workspace, if it becomes dry you can add a tiny bit of water. Make all of your curly tentacles and set them aside (I like to place the fondant shapes onto wax paper so that they are easy to remove when I'm ready to put the jellyfish together).",
      "Once the glaze is set you can build the jellyfish. Take 7-8 of your tentacles (you want a mix of dark and light blue), and press them down onto the doughnut (close to the center) so that the strands are in a little cluster with the curly sides hanging over the edge of the doughnut. Stretch one of the 2-inch circle cutouts slightly, and place it over the middle of the doughnut. Place a fondant covered doughnut hole on top, and gently press down. This will begin to create a ruffled effect in the circle. Use a toothpick, or your fingers to continue the scalloped edge (almost like you would the sides of a pie crust) all the way around the doughnut hole. Fit the black icing with a coupler and the #1 piping tip, and pipe the faces onto each doughnut hole. Color the leftover white fondant with a little of the pink icing gel, and add cheeks (and tongues if you would like) to each jellyfish.",
      "Enjoy! Your friends will be so jelly of your swarm of jellyfish doughnuts that you'll be glad you made extras."
