      "Place in cooler (refrigerator) until completely set (several hours or overnight).",

      "But you can expect to be watching these anywhere from 25 minutes to 45 minutes.",

      "Stir together the flour, water, and seed culture in a mixing bowl (you can discard the remaining seed culture or give it to a friend to build into his or her own barm).",
      "Make sure the seed culture is evenly distributed and all the flour is hydrated.",
      "It will make a wet, sticky sponge similar to a poolish (see page 232).",
      "Transfer this sponge to a clean plastic, glass, or ceramic storage container twice as large as the barm.",
      "When transferring the barm into the container, repeatedly dip your hand, spatula, or bowl scraper in water to keep the barm from sticking to it.",
      "Cover the container with a lid or plastic wrap and ferment at room temperature for approximately 6 hours, or until the barm is bubbly.",
      "The plastic wrap will swell like a balloon, as will a plastic lid.",
      "When this happens, open the lid or release the plastic to let the gas escape (try not to breathe it as it escapesthe carbonic gas mixed with ethanol fumes will knock you across the room!).",
      "Replace the cover and refrigerate overnight before using.",
      "The barm will be ready to use the next day and will remain potent for 3 days.",
      "After that, or if you use more than half during the next 3 days, you will need to refresh it as described next.",
      "The standard refreshment for barm is to double it at least.",
      "However, you can also quadruple it, as the organisms in the barm are capable of feeding on a large refreshment and converting it into starter.",
      "I double the barm at each feeding if I want a very sour bread, but I triple or quadruple it when I want a less sour flavor.",
      "Remember, it takes longer for the bacteria to work than the yeast, so while a larger feeding dilutes both the bacterial and the wild-yeast communities, the yeast bounces back faster than the bacteria, creating a strong, but less acidic, leavening sponge.",
      "Eventually, the bacterial fermentation does catch up, by the second or third day, and the sponge becomes quite acidic and sour (with a pH level of about 3.5).",
      "It is important to understand what happens when you refresh the barm.",
      "After 4 to 7 days, the acids and protease enzymes in a barm that has not been refreshed break down the gluten, turning what was at first a strong, stringy sponge into a protein-weak, potato-souplike consistency.",
      "There are still plenty of live organisms to leaven and flavor bread, but they will make a flaccid dough.",
      "For this reason, it is advisable to feed your barm 3 days or less before you plan to use it (ideally, the day before).",
      "If you have a lot of barm but havent fed it for a while, discard all but 1 cup and refresh it with 4 cups of flour and 2 1/2 to 3 cups water, stirring until all the flour is hydrated.",
      "If you have been using and feeding your barm regularly, you do not necessarily have to discard any.",
      "However, what you do not want to do is, for example, use 1 cup of barm from your supply to make some bread, then refresh the remaining barm with only 1 cup flour and some water.",
      "You must always at least double the remaining barm.",
      "You can do this by either throwing or giving some away before you refresh it, or using up more before refreshing it (remember, you have a 3-day window before you need to feed it again).",
      "If you do not plan to use the barm for a while, do not throw any away until you plan to refresh it again, and follow the guidance given above to refrigerate or freeze it in a tightly sealed container.",
      "Since you do not want to freeze a glass or ceramic container, you should transfer the barm to a zippered freezer bag that has been misted with spray oil (allow enough room for expansion and gas development).",
      "Use high-gluten flour for the refreshments (except in the case of a rye barm), as it has more gluten than in bread flour to withstand the acid and enzymatic degradation.",
      "You can refresh in two ways.",
      "One is to weigh the amount of barm you plan to refresh and the other is to eyeball it.",
      "I use both methods and find that as long as you stay in the doubling to quadrupling ballpark, you will have no problem keeping your mother strong, active, and clean tasting.",
      "By clean tasting I mean that no off-flavors develop, such as a musty or cheesy flavor caused by overfermenting at warm temperatures or by leaving it out too long.",
      "This allows unwelcome bacteria to join the party or for the yeast to create too much alcohol, resulting in what we think of as a yeasty flavor.",
      "The flavor is a combination of alcohol and glutathione, an unpleasant-tasting amino acid released by yeast as it dies.",
      "The weighing method is simple: Weigh the barm and calculate how much flour and water it will take to double, triple, or quadruple the weight (the easiest way is to figure equal parts water and flour).",
      "Thus, if you plan to refresh 1 pound of barm, you can build it to 2 pounds by adding 8 ounces each of flour (1 3/4 cups) and water (1 cup); or you can quadruple it by adding 1 1/2 pounds flour (5 1/4 cups) and 1 1/2 pounds (3 cups) water.",
      "The larger the refreshment, the longer the fermentation time, usually 4 to 6 hours, depending on the size of the refreshment and how cold the barm was when you started.",
      "If you are using a cold barm just out of the refrigerator, warm the water up to about 90F to compensate and to hasten the onset of fermentation.",
      "Never let the starter actually be warm, however.",
      "It is best for the organisms we want to cultivate, the lactic- and acetic-producing bacteria, if the starter ferments slowly, between 65 and 75F, or at room temperature.",
      "When the starter is bubbly and foamy, put it in the refrigerator overnight before using it.",
      "Technically, though, you could begin using it as soon as it foams up, but I wait for the overnight development because I believe it gives the bread more complexity of flavor.",
      "Either way, with a ripe and ready barm, you are ready to move on to the next build.",

      "The full flavor of the barm will not develop until it has been refreshed 2 or 3 times over a 2-week period, during which time the organisms indigenous to your region will gradually take charge of it.",
      "(This is why a starter made from a seed culture imported from Egypt or Russia will, over time, produce bread that tastes like a starter made locally from scratch.)",

      "However, you can begin using the barm the day after it is made.",

      "If you want to save the barm but do not plan to make bread for a while, you can refrigerate it for at least 2 months in an airtight container, and then refresh it by discarding all but 1 cup and building up from there.",

      "Then refresh again the next day, building back to about 4 to 6 cups barm.",
      "The following day you will have a strong, ready-to-use barm.",

      "Form peaks by repeatedly drawing a knife or spatula across the meringue and then in an upward motion, or by piping with a pastry bag and ending with an upward motion.",
      "Bake for 8 to 10 minutes for a large tart or 5 to 7 minutes for small tarts, until the tips of the meringues are golden brown.",
      "Remove from the oven and let cool 10 minutes.",
      "Remove the sides of the tart pans by carefully lifting the tart from the center of the pan base; the ring should slide right off.",
      "Serve.",
      "Combine the flour, confectioners sugar, and salt in a medium bowl and stir to mix.",
      "Cut the butter into the flour mixture using a pastry blender or two knives in a crosscutting motion until the mixture resembles coarse meal.",
      "Work quickly so the butter remains cool and doesnt melt into the flour.",
      "Stir in the pecans.",
      "Combine the egg yolks, the 3 tablespoons ice water, and the vanilla and stir to mix.",
      "Add the egg mixture to the flour mixture and stir with a fork just until the dough begins to clump together and is moist enough to pat together.",
      "Do not mix any more than necessary.",
      "If the dough is dry and crumbly, add more ice water, 1 tablespoon at a time, just until the dough comes together; do not add so much water that the dough becomes wet or sticky.",
      "Turn the dough onto a lightly floured work surface and, with lightly floured hands, shape the dough into 2 balls.",
      "Form the dough into 2 flat disks, wrap in plastic, and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, or for up to 3 days.",
      "Check the tart recipe for special rolling instructions.",
      "To prepare a basic tart shell, remove the dough from the refrigerator and let sit for about 10 minutes.",
      "Place on a lightly floured work surface.",
      "Dust a rolling pin with flour and roll the dough between 1/8 and 1/4 inch thick.",
      "Fold the dough in half or gently roll it onto the rolling pin and lift it over the tart pan.",
      "Press the dough lightly into the bottom and up the sides of the pan.",
      "Trim the excess dough, leaving about 1 inch of dough draped over the pan.",
      "Roll the extra dough under itself to form a rim around the edge of the pan.",
      "Crimp the rim of dough with your fingers or press with the tines of a fork.",
      "Prick the bottom of the crust two or three times with a fork to create small holes.",
      "Cover the crust with plastic and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, or up to 3 days, before proceeding with a recipe or partially or fully prebaking the crust (see Know-how, page 345).",
      "Follow the recipe for Bittersweet Chocolate Tarts with Pecan Crusts (page 347), but with the following changes: Spread store-bought dulce de leche in the prebaked tart shells in place of (or in addition to) the chocolate filling.",
      "Just before baking, sprinkle a pinch of your best sea salt on top of the meringues and continue with the original recipe for baking the meringues.",
      "If you know a few basic rules, working with meringue is a breeze.",
      "Eggs separate most readily when they are still cold, but for best results you should wait until the whites come to room temperature before beating them.",
      "Always use a glass or metal bowl for whipping the eggs; plastic bowls tend to be greasier, and this residual grease can weigh the whites down and prevent them from whipping to stiff peaks.",
      "When whipping egg whites, start on medium speed and beat until light and frothy; then increase the speed to high and beat until soft peaks form before slowly adding the sugar and continuing to beat until stiff peaks form, about 3 minutes.",
      "You can test the relative stiffness of the peaks by quickly dipping the beaters or a spatula into the whites.",
      "Soft peaks will curl over and begin to collapse when the beaters are lifted; stiff peaks are glossier and will stick straight up.",
      "Do not beat meringue past the stiff-peaks stage or it will separate and become grainy.",
      "Cream of tartar is often added because its high acid content helps stabilize meringue; the same effect can be achieved by adding a teaspoon or so of equally acidic lemon juice.",
      "Wait to add sugar and any other flavoring agents until after youve beaten the egg whites to soft peaks; adding the sugar too soon will prevent expansion.",
      "Add the sugar slowly and beat constantly until the sugar is completely dissolved.",
      "When topping a pie with meringue, mound the meringue in the center of the pie and use a spatula or the back of a spoon to spread it to the edges and make peaks.",
      "You can also use a pastry bag and tip to pipe the meringue and form peaks.",
      "Be sure the meringue touches the edges of the crust all the way around to prevent shrinking.",
      "If topping a baked pie with meringue, place the meringue on the filling while it is still warm.",
      "The heat from the pie will begin to cook the bottom of the meringue and prevent a layer of weeping liquid from forming between the filling and meringue.",
      "Always bake meringue in a preheated 350F oven; temperatures below 325F are too cool, and temperatures above 350F are too hot.",
      "Meringue topping on a 9-inch pie typically takes 8 to 10 minutes in a preheated 350F oven; smaller tarts will take less time, 5 to 7 minutes."
