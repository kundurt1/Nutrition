Dissolve yeast in warm water in a large bowl. Stir in scalded milk, 2 cups flour and next 4 ingredients; beat at medium speed of an electric mixer until smooth. Gradually stir in enough remaining flour to make a soft dough. Turn dough out onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic (8 to 10 minutes). Place in a well greased bowl, turning to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place (85\u00b0), free from drafts, 1 hour or until doubled in bulk. Punch dough down. Cover and refrigerate 1 hour. Punch dough down and place on a lightly floured surface; roll into a 24 x 10-inch rectangle. Place butter on half of dough. Fold other half of dough over butter to form a 12 x 10-inch rectangle; pinch edges to seal. Roll dough into an 18 x 10-inch rectangle. Fold rectangle into thirds, beginning with short side. Cover and chill 1 hour. Repeat rolling and folding process (roll into an 18 x 10-inch rectangle and fold into thirds) 2 additional times, covering and chilling dough 30 minutes between procedures. Wrap dough in aluminum foil and chill overnight. Divide dough into 4 equal portions; chill 3 portions. Roll 1 portion into a 12-inch circle on a lightly floured surface; cut into 6 wedges. Roll up each wedge tightly beginning at wide end. Seal points and place point side down on greased baking sheets, curve into crescent shapes. Repeat with remaining dough. Refrigerate 30 minutes. Combine egg yolk and 1 tablespoon milk; brush over croissants. Bake at 425\u00b0 for 14 to 16 minutes or until golden brown. Yields two dozen."
