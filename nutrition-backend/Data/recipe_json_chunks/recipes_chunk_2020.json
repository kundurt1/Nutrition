      "1) Mix flour, salt and shortening until all crumbs, use a pastry blender or 2 forks, make sure you get this real good",
      "2) From here remember once you add the water at this point the more you mess with your dough the tougher it will get, T ake a large cup or bowl, add a couple ice cubes to it, from this measure out your 7 tablespoons of water, slowly sprinkle all over the flour mixture, one right after the other, when all done using a fork gather dough into a big ball, remembering to be gentle as you can, the more you mess, the tougher it gets, when you have it in one ball divide in to 2 balls, wrap eachbin plastic wrap",
      "3) prepare your area to roll out dough, grab first one and start to roll out, when big enough for your pie plate (to measure for this invert pie plate upside down on top of flat crust if crust is at least 2\" bigger you are good to go)",
      "4) roll dough onto your rolling pin, then lift it over your pie plate and unroll over dish, adjust the pie dough so it fits fine in pie plate",
      "5) If you are using a filling, now is when to fill pie, then if it needs to have a second crust for the top repeat steps above, crimp edges good, and make some cuts in the top crust for vents to let steam escape,",
      "6) If you are needing to bake pie shell by itself, then first take and fill the piie plate with dried beans to prevent pie crust from rising on you, or poke with a fork all over the bottom allowing room for air to escape and crust will bake flat that way",
      "7) Preheat oven to 400^ F or 200^C, bake pie shell for about 8-14 min, For a filled pie its always best to follow the baking instructions for it",
      "8) Tips.",
      "Never put this pie dough in the refrigerator, always use ice cold water, never reroll out your dough it makes it tuff( better to have a not so pretty crust than a tuff one), The less time you spend handling this dough the better it tastes, If you substitute out any ingredient it will not have as good of results"
