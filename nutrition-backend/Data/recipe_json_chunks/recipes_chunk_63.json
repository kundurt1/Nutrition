Meanwhile, prepare sauce. In a small saucepan, over medium-low heat, combine cream cheese, milk and Parmesan cheese, stirring until smooth. Set aside. Spray a large nonstick skillet with vegetable cooking spray. Heat skillet over medium heat. Add mushrooms and green onions. Cook, stirring, until tender, about 5 minutes. In a blender or food processor fitted with the metal blade, combine mushroom mixture, ricotta, chicken and parsley. Process until smooth. Spoon mushroom mixture down center of each noodle and roll up tightly. If you want, you can drizzle a small amount of the sauce down center of each noodle. Place rolls, filling sides up, in prepared dish. Spoon sauce on top. Cover with foil. Bake rolls until heated through, about 25 minutes. Serve immediately."
