      "If you make a whole box of pasta, some of it gets wasted - that is why I suggest using half to 3/4 of the box.",

      "You can experiment with different pastas, but I have found that the angel hair is a nice compliment to the delicate shrimp and the pasta should have a slight flavor of its own than blends in nicely with the shrimp and peppers.",
      "The peppers, if good and fresh will have an almost sweet taste to offset the spices, but be an excellent match with the shrimp's texture.",
