      "Adjust the water or flour as needed.",
      "The dough should be firm but tacky, like firm French bread dough.",

      "Ferment at room temperature for 3 to 4 hours, or until the dough has nearly doubled in size.",
      "Gently remove the dough from the bowl and divide it into 2 equal pieces (about 22 ounces each), or divide it into smaller pieces if you are making rolls, being careful to degas the dough as little as possible.",
      "Gently shape the dough into boules, batards, or baguettes, as shown on pages 7274.",
      "Proof the dough in bannetons or proofing bowls, on couches, or on parchment-lined sheet pans that have been dusted with semolina flour or cornmeal (see pages 3438).",

      "Lean, standard dough; indirect method; wild yeast",
      "Day 1: 5 hours firm starter",
      "Day 2: 1 hour to de-chill firm starter; 15 to 17 minutes mixing; 5 to 7 hours fermentation, shaping, and proofing; 20 to 30 minutes baking (day 2 or 3)",
      "This dough is made with a 3-build method: barm to firm starter (also called the levain or chef) to final dough.",
      "As noted earlier, this process could go on to 4, 5 or 6 builds, but by using cold fermentation (retarding), we develop maximum flavor without all the intermediate builds.",
      "I encourage you to veer from this method and modify either the technique or the ingredients.",
      "Consult the Grace Note for a number of options, but only your imagination limits the full range of possibilities.",
      "Some bakers prefer to work exclusively with firm starters, keeping even the mother starter in a firm state.",
      "Professional bakers like this because they can throw the firm piece easily into a mixer for either refreshing or elaborating.",
      "It is less messy than working with big batches of wet sponge.",
      "One of my baking friends, Keith Giusto of Giusto Mills in South San Francisco, keeps his mother starter as a very dry dough, like bagel dough.",
      "This is not only easy to transport and handle (assuming you have a mixer capable of handling such stiff dough), but also makes a very sour bread, for those who like it extra sour.",
      "Acetic bacteria prefer the denser, less-aerated environment of the firm starter; lactic bacteria prefer the wetter sponge of the barm method.",
      "Home bakers, I find, prefer keeping a wet sponge, as it is easy to refresh and keep track of it in small batches.",
      "However, if you prefer to use the firm starter system, simply reduce the water weight to 50 to 57 percent of the flour weight when you refresh your mother starter and then make your elaborations.",
      "It is also perfectly acceptable to make your final dough directly from the barm.",
      "You will have to diminish the water in the final dough to compensate for the wetness of the barm, but otherwise you can proceed with an equal amount of barm for firm starter.",
      "To spike the dough with commercial yeast, which guarantees a 90-minute first fermentation and a 60-minute final proofing (and a less sour flavor), add 1 1/2 teaspoons instant yeast to the final dough.",
      "You can substitute other types of flour, including whole-wheat flour, for some or all of the high-gluten or bread flour.",
      "A classic French pain au levain includes about 10 percent whole-wheat or rye flour (or a combinationabout 1/2 cup total).",
      "You can make a meteil rye bread (less than 50 percent rye flour), or a seigle rye bread (more than 50 percent rye flour), by substituting the desired amount of rye flour, either white rye or a blend of white and pumpernickel grind.",
      "This can be done either in the final dough or in the firm starter (or you can use a rye barmsee the formula for 100% Sourdough Rye Bread on page 239).",
      "You can add roasted garlic; lightly toasted walnuts, sunflower seeds, pecans, or other nuts and seeds of your choice; raisins and other dried fruit; or cheese.",
      "The standard amount is about 40 percent of the final flour weight.",
      "It is best to add these ingredients during the final 2 minutes of mixing to protect against breaking them up too small.",
      "My all-time favorite is a blue cheese and walnut bread with 25 percent toasted walnuts and 15 to 20 percent crumbled blue cheese (firm, not creamy), adding the walnuts during the last 2 minutes of kneading and carefully folding in the blue cheese by hand at the end of kneading.",
      "You can do this by flattening the dough and sprinkling one-third of the cheese over the top, then rolling it up and repeating this two more times until all the cheese is incorporated.",
      "If you are using salty cheese, such as blue, feta, or Parmesan, reduce the salt in the formula by 25 percent (to 1 1/2 teaspoons).",
      "Incidentally, the oil from the walnuts will turn the dough a burgundy color and the delicious flavor of the walnuts will permeate the entire loaf.",
      "Cooked potatoes can be used to tenderize and flavor the dough.",
      "Use a ratio of 25 percent potatoes to flour in the final build.",
      "Fresh herbs can be used to taste.",
      "Hand roll them into the dough as you would blue cheese.",
      "Dried herbs and spices, such as herbes de Provence, cumin, and oregano, can also be used, but with a gentle touch, as these flavors can easily dominate.",
      "It is just as valid to make rustic, wet-dough breads with wild-yeast starters as it is to use commercial yeast and yeast pre-ferments, or to use the mixed, or spiked, method.",
      "Substitute an equal amount of barm (this is a perfect time to build the dough directly from barm) for the poolish.",
      "You can add commercial yeast (or not) during the final dough stage, bearing in mind that spiking it with yeast will allow you to make the bread on the same schedule as already written in the instructions.",
      "If you make pure wild-yeast bread, you will have to give the dough a 3- to 4-hour bulk fermentation and a 90-minute final proofing.",
