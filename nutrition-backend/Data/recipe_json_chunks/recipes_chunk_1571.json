Stir in the liquid yeast mixture and beaten egg with a wooden spoon until a dough forms (it will be sticky). Using a spatula, scrape the dough onto a clean counter that is well floured. Now comes the fun part: knead the dough, turning it, until it's smooth and elastic. This will take about 8-10 minutes. Try not to add too much flour to your counter even though this dough is sticky. The more flour you knead in, the tougher your buns will be. The dough should be stickier than regular bread dough.",

      "Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Using a very sharp knife (a dough scraper would be ideal but I didn't have one), divide the dough into 8 equal parts. I found it helpful to cut the dough in half, then quarters, then each quarter in half, like you are cutting a pie. Gently roll each piece into a smooth ball and place on the baking sheet about 2 inches apart. Cover loosely with a piece of plastic wrap or waxed paper that is lightly coated with butter or canola oil. Let your buns rise for about another hour or so, until about double in size. Again, this may take longer in your kitchen, depending on how warm it is.",

Make sure the rack is in the center, and preheat your oven to 400 degrees F. Beat the remaining egg with a tablespoon of water and brush it on top of the buns. Sprinkle poppy seeds or sesame seeds on top of the buns if desired. Pop your buns in the oven and bake for about 7 minutes, then turn the sheet and bake for an additional 7 or 8 minutes, until the tops are nice and golden brown. Baking time is about 15 minutes total. Slide the parchment paper with the buns onto a baking rack to cool completely (or serve slightly warm if you want).",

      "1. A springform pan, measuring about 21 centimeters across the bottom (or about 8 and 1/2-inches).",
      "2. A piece of parchment paper to line the pan.",
      "3. Another sheet of parchment paper on which to chill the top crust and a baking pan on which to place the paper and crust while the crust chills.",
      "4. A medium-sized frying pan.",
      "5. 2 bowls.",
      "6. A mixer, hand or standing.",
      "7. A heavy-bottomed saucepan.",
      "8. A whisk.",
      "9. A pizza cutter or knife.",
      "10. A broad spatula.",
      "11. A small strainer.",
      "For the pastry crust: Allow one hour for chilling the dough.",
      "1. Butter the bottom and sides of the springform pan and line the bottom of the pan with parchment paper. Cut another sheet of parchment slightly bigger than the bottom of the springform pan. Place the pan on top of it and trace around it with a pencil. Butter the traced circle and place the sheet on a small baking pan that will fit in the freezer. Set aside both the springform pan and the sheet of buttered paper.",
      "2. Melt the butter in the frying pan over medium heat. Add the ground almonds and stir them about and brown them for a minute or two.",
      "3. Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the flour. Transfer the mixture to a bowl.",
      "4. Mix in the Kirsch (or rum) and the baking powder and set the mixture aside.",
      "5. In another bowl, beat the eggs with the sugar and vanilla until they thicken, become creamy, and turn a pale, white-ish yellow. Then beat them into the bowl of ground almond mixture.",
      "6. There will be almost 2 cups of very soft pastry dough. Pour 2/3 cup of the dough into the traced circle and spread it out to cover the circle's interior. (There's no need to be precise about spreading the pastry exactly out to the edge of the circle.) Place the circle of pastry, on the pan, in the freezer and chill it for 1 hour while you make the pastry cream and form the pastry shell in the pan.",
      "7. Put the bowl holding the remainder of the pastry dough in the freezer for 30 minutes. While waiting for the dough to chill, make the cream for the pie filling.",
      "For the cream:",
      "1. In a saucepan over medium heat, heat the milk until it is hot but not boiling. Then remove it from heat and set it aside.",
      "2. Put the egg yolks, sugar and vanilla in a bowl and beat until they become creamy. Then beat in the cornstarch.",
      "3. Still mixing, slowly add the hot milk.",
      "4. Pour the milk and egg mixture into a heavy-bottomed saucepan and cook the cream, stirring with a whisk, over medium heat until it slowly comes to a boil and thickens. (This may take about 5 minutes or a little longer.) Set the thickened cream aside to cool to lukewarm and then place it in the refrigerator while you work on the chilled dough.",
      "For assembling and baking the pie:",
      "1. Preheat the oven to 400 F.",
      "2. After 30 minutes of chilling, remove the bowl of dough from the freezer. Butter your fingers, turn the dough into the prepared pan and press it over the bottom and about 2.5 centimeters (or 1 1/2 inches) up the sides of the pan. Put the pan back in the freezer for another 20 minutes. (The crust will firm up some more in the freezer and then it will be easy to even the crust out a little more and define the sides of it a little better before filling it.",
      "3. After 20 more minutes of chilling in the freezer, take the crust out. With your fingers, even the bottom and rim of the pastry some more and then, fill it with the pastry cream and arrange a cup of cherries in the cream.",
      "4. By now the round of top crust will have been chilling on the parchment paper in the freezer for about 1 hour. Take it out of the freezer. The dough will still be pliable and too soft to come away from the paper in one piece. But this doesn't matter. With a pizza cutter or knife, divide the dough into 8 sections. The sections are used as a guide as you scrape off and flatten sections of dough and place them on top of the pie.",
      "5. Butter your fingers. Scrape up a section of pastry dough with the spatula. It will not slide onto the spatula in a flat piece; rather, it will wrinkle and bunch up. Lift the piece off the spatula, roughly flatten it out between your buttered fingers, and place it on top of the pie filling. This step isn't easy to visualize. There are photos illustrating it, as well as other parts of the recipe on the related link.",
      "6. Repeat, section by section, until all the round of dough is transferred to the top of the filling, placing the irregular, flattened strips of dough in a single layer over the filling.",
      "7. Finally, spread out the flattened segments of pastry gently with your fingers, until the sections meet and cover most of the filling. (But don't labour over the crust too much. Placing a soft crust over a soft filling is not tricky so long as you realize that the crust need not cover every space and will not be a thing of beauty before it is baked. As it bakes, however, the sections of flattened dough will spread out and fill in most of the spaces, and the powdered sugar and almonds used for decorating the baked pie will fill in the remainder.",
      "8. Bake the pie in the middle of the oven for 25-30 minutes, or until the top crust is golden and does not collapse when gently pressed with your finger. Then remove it from the oven and cool the pie in the pan on a rack. Remove the rim of the pan. Lift the pie gently to peel away the parchment paper, or leave it on the parchment paper and slide the pie onto a serving platter.",
      "9. Sprinkle the pie with thin-sliced, toasted almonds. Sift powdered sugar over it and, just before serving sift a little more sugar over the pie and place cherries around on the top. Once the pie is sliced and placed on dessert plates, add another one or two cherries beside or on each slice.",

      "To start, place an oven rack in the center of your oven and preheat the oven to 350 F. Using a standard 12-count muffin pan, butter each cup of the muffin tin generously. Using parchment or waxed paper, cut a small circular piece of paper to fit the bottom of each muffin cup. Place the paper in the bottom of each cup, then generously butter the paper as well. Option: use 'baking' cooking spray to generously coat the pan.",
      "In a shallow baking pan, toast the pecans and coconut in the oven for approximately 10-12 minutes. Dump them into a food processor with 2 tablespoons of the sugar and pulse until they are coarsely ground, but not dust. If you have a few pea-sized chunks in there, that's fine.",
      "Using a stand mixer with the whisk attachment, combine the rest of the sugar with the eggs and beat on medium-high speed for 5 minutes. Turn the mixer off and add the pecan/coconut mixture, then turn it back to medium-high and beat for one additional minute. At this point, you'll want to stop the mixer and scrape down the sides of the bowl.",
      "Turning the mixer back to medium-high, add the softened butter (you'll want it to be super soft) one tablespoon at a time. Once the butter is incorporated, turn the mixer to low speed and add the coconut rum (or vanilla extract), and beat just until blended.",
      "The batter will look slightly curdled, so don't panic. There's no flour in this recipe to smooth things out, so just go with it. Using a spoon or small ladle, spoon equal portions of the batter into each of the 12 muffin cups. Each cup should end up about half-full.",
      "Sprinkle 10-12 cocoa nibs over the top of each baby cake. The cocoa nibs are optional, but add tremendous flavor. Place the pan into the center of the oven and set your timer for 14 minutes. After 14 minutes, turn the pan around and bake for another 14 minutes, or until the edges are crispy and a toothpick comes out clean from the center. Mine took 28 minutes. Yours may take anywhere from 26 to 29 minutes to bake.",
      "Remove the pan from the oven and invert it immediately. (Hint: I used a flat cookie sheet that was a little larger than my muffin pan. Just turn the cookie sheet upside-down on top of the muffin pan, then grab both pans with hot pads and flip them both at the same time.) Tap the bottom of the muffin tin to help release the cakes, then lift the muffin pan to release them. Allow cakes to cool for a few minutes, and remove any parchment paper that may be stuck to the bottom of the cakes. Using a flat spatula, turn them over so the tops are facing up and allow to cool.",
      "These are best served slightly warm or at room temperature, and are even better with a dollop of whipped cream on top. The recipe makes 12 baby cakes which can be kept in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days, or frozen for up to 2 months.",

This simple strategy will pay off, big time, no matter what you choose to do in terms of flavoring. Feel free to try different herbs, melted butter instead of olive oil, different salts, etc. This combination is one of our favorites, as the mustard gives the potatoes a nice little kick to go with the garlic and smoked salt.",

      "To peel and seed the tomatoes, boil a pot of water on the stovetop. Fill a bowl with cold water and ice. Have a large empty bowl for the blanched tomatoes. Once the water is boiling, gently place 4-5 of the tomatoes at a time into the boiling water using a large pasta spoon. Leave the tomatoes in the water a quick 30-45 seconds and no longer to avoid cooking them. Once the skin starts to wrinkle slightly, remove from boiling water and place immediately into the ice cold water to stop the cooking.",
      "Allow them to stay in the ice cold water for approximately 30-45 seconds then place them in the empty bowl. Continue these steps until all of the tomatoes have been blanched and dipped in the cold water. At this point the skin should just easily peel right off of the tomato. Grab 2 more large empty bowls and put a fine mesh strainer over one. Pull the tomato apart and push the seeds out over the fine mesh strainer and bowl; this preserves the tomato juice. Once all of the tomatoes have been seeded, take the preserved juice and pour into the bowl with the seeded tomatoes. (You will not be able to get all the seeds out).",
      "At this point, the tomatoes are ready to start cooking for the sauces. In a large pot, heat the olive oil and onions on medium heat to brown them. Add the garlic and herbs to the pot and stir for 5 minutes until garlic is aromatic. Deglaze the pan with the red wine and allow cook for a couple more minutes.",
      "Pour in all of the tomatoes and juice and the sugar into the pot and stir with onions, garlic and herbs to combine. Allow to come to a simmer and let the sauce cook on low for 2-3 hours. Bring to a simmer and cook on low, stirring occasionally for 2-3 hours. Once the sauce is done cooking, stir in salt and pepper to taste.",

The salt granules will cut the flesh of the cabbage and allow the liquid to escape while it breaks down the tough texture. You'll notice a lot of liquid coming out into the bottom of the bowl. Massage the cabbage until it looks wilted and weak. Then soak the cabbage in another bowl of water for two minutes to allow some of the excess salt to leach out. Drain off the water and add cabbage to the kidney beans.",

Check it after two minutes. You want the corn to be blackened on at least one side. Shake the pan to loosen the kernels and season with salt and pepper. When the corn is charred and cooked through, remove from heat. Add it to the bowl with the cabbage and beans when cool.",

      "First, food processors are great at getting the job done as quickly as possible, and the more you mess with dough the tougher it becomes. So break out that food processor and add 2 cups of the flour, salt and sugar and give it a quick pulse until it's combined.",
      "Add the cubes of butter and the shortening and pulse until combined, about 1 1/2 minutes. A mixture of butter and shortening gives great texture and great flavor.",
      "Add the remaining flour and process until it's all combined. Move dough to a large bowl, then add the water and the vodka and knead gently until it's all combined. Vodka makes your crust flaky. It cooks off completely, unlike water, so you have a great flakiness that will hold up to whatever you put inside of it. Your dough will be very moist, but you can add a bit of flour if it is too moist to hold together.",
      "Split the dough into two evenly sized disks and wrap in plastic wrap, and chill for at least 2 hours. If you need to, this can be made up to three days in advance, just store the plastic wrapped disks in a large Ziplock bag.",
      "Preheat your oven to 375F.",
      "For the apple filling:",
      "In a large bowl, combine the apples, lemon juice and salt, toss to coat. Let stand at room temp for about 30 minutes. Add the sugar, flour, cinnamon, apple sauce and nutmeg and toss to coat. Set aside.",
      "For the caramel filling:",
      "In a pot over medium heat, add the brown sugar and cream. Stir until the sugar is dissolved and allow to boil, untouched, until it reaches 210F on a candy thermometer. Remove from heat and add the butter and vanilla, stir to combine and allow to cool.",
      "For the assembly:",
      "Roll out one of your pie dough disks in a circle large enough to fit into your greased pie pan with a bit of over hang. Add the circle to the pie pan and press into shape. Poke a bunch of holes in the bottom with a fork. Pour the caramel filling on the bottom, then the apples on top of that. Roll out the remaining pie dough circle. I like to cut out cute shapes with a cookie cutter and layer them on top, adhering them to the top crust with melted butter. You can do this, or you can make a top crust that is your standard round circle with slits cut in the top. Brush the top with the remaining melted butter and sprinkle with sugar.",
