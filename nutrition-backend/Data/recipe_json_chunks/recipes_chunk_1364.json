(My husband had a fit when he saw me adding salt after several vegetables in this dish. I know it seems like a lot of salt when we have been brainwashed in to believing salt is bad for us. Use common sense and your taste buds as a guide - if you do not eat a lot of processed foods, fast foods, or have high blood pressure or other health condition that is aggravated by salt, adding a pinch of salt after each vegetable is not excessive. I just completed a nutrition course in which this topic was discussed extensively and it was emphasized that the salt added to cooking is typically not a culprit to unhealthy salt consumption - its the canned, processed foods and the drive through windows that are killing us!)",

      "Pull the membrane off the bone side by using a paring knife. Carefully slide the knife under the membrane at one end and work it off the ribs. Once you have it started you can grab it with your hand and peel it off. Sometimes it doesn't want to come off so I'll take the knife and slash it apart.This helps the meat absorb the smoke, and you don't want to be pulling tough membrane out of your mouth while eating. Liberally hand rub a good dry rub on both sides of the rack. You can buy a good rub for pork, make your own or use my recipe. Rubs can be made from a vast aray of indegredients. The basics are equal portions of sugar,salt,black pepper and paprika. Then adjust it for your own taste even adding other thing like seasoning salt,garlic power, dry mustard,chili power,etc. It only ends at your imagination. My rub recipe is suitable for my wife's tender palate. The rub should stick to the meat, but you can use a bit of water or apple juce to help it stick. Grill over indirect heat. If you use a grill push the charcoal to one side of the grill, you'll need to turn and rotate the racks to avoid burning the edge closest to the heat. Keep the tempature around 250 degrees. Slow cooking ribs is best for flavor and tenderness. Ribs are done when the meat pulls away from the end of the bone about 1/4 inch usally on both ends of the bone. It takes about 1 1/2 to 2 hours"

    "title": "pumpkin cake with cream cheese icing and caramelized pumpkin seeds",
    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "FOR THE CAKE: Preheat the oven to 325\u00b0 F and position a rack in the center. Butter a 9-inch round cake pan, then line the bottom with a circle of parchment paper and butter that, too (I like to be extra vigilant).",
      "Sift the flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves into a bowl and set aside.",
      "Use the whisk attachment of a stand mixer to combine the pumpkin, oil, sugar, and salt.",
      "With mixer on medium speed, add the egg yolks one at a time, waiting for one yolk to be fully incorporated before adding the next. Scrape down the sides of the bowl.",
      "With the mixer on low speed, add the flour mixture, turning off the machine as soon as the dry ingredients are just incorporated. Scrape down the sides of the bowl.",
      "Whisk the three egg whites until they are frothy and white. Fold them into the batter using a rubber spatula until they were no longer visible (but be careful not to over mix). Pour the cake batter into the pan and bake on the center rack in the oven. Begin checking the cake after 40 minutes (mine took 42 one time, 45 the next -- the middle will set and cook a little longer from the heat of the pan as the cake cools), removing it when a toothpick or thin knife inserted into the cake comes out clean. Let the cake cool in its pan on a wire rack for at least 20 minutes, or until the cake is pulling away from the pan, before inverting it onto a wire rack.",
      "FOR THE FROSTING: Using the paddle attachment of a stand mixer, beat together 8 tablespoons of the butter and the cream cheese until smooth and creamy. Gradually add the powdered sugar and beat until the frosting is smooth with no dry traces of sugar. The original recipe calls for 3 3/4 cups (1 pound) of powdered sugar, but I found that the frosting was plenty sweet (and complemented the cake nicely) after 2 1/2 cups. Add a pinch of cinnamon, and beat the frosting until incorporated.",
      "FOR THE PUMPKIN SEEDS: In a small saucepan over medium heat, caramelize a tablespoon of sugar until it is a rich reddish-brown color. You'll want to stir the melted parts of the sugar towards the middle while avoiding over-stirring, which can turn the mixture dry and crumbly. Once the sugar is dark and fragrant, add the last tablespoon of butter and stir quickly until it has melted and the sauce is smooth. Add the pumpkin seeds and stir until they're evenly coated in sauce. Transfer the seeds to a plate lined with parchment paper so that they cool and harden.",
      "Frost the cake when it is completely cool. I frosted only the top of the cake, and so I end up with extra frosting (keep it in your refrigerator, buy some Teddy Grahams, and enjoy DIY Dunkaroos.) Break up the pumpkin seeds using your hands, and sprinkle them on top of the cake."

    "ingredients": [],

      "To make the dough: Combine flour, yeast, and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook. Stir to combine, then add the water. Mix until dough just comes together, then let dough sit for 10 minutes. Mix at medium-low speed until dough forms a smooth, silky ball that sticks to the bottom of the bowl as it kneads, about 10 minutes more. Take out the dough hook, form the dough into a tight ball and set it back into the bottom of the bowl. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place for 2 hours, or until doubled in size.",
      "You can also do this by hand: Mix the flour, yeast, and sugar in a bowl with a wooden spoon and stir in the water until incorporated. Let rest for 10 minutes. Turn out onto a lightly-floured surface and knead for 10 minutes, or until smooth and elastic. Set back into the bowl, cover in plastic wrap, and let rise in a warm place for 2 hours, or until doubled in size.",
      "Once the dough is risen, prepare your pan(s). [If you don't have a Detroit-style anodized aluminum pan, the traditional choice, Alt-Lopez recommends splitting the dough evenly between two 8x8-inch square cake pans. I like this option because it gives you maximum edges.] Pour a splash of olive oil in your pan(s) and turn the dough around to coat it. Using your fingers, press the dough to the edges (it won't go all the way-don't worry about it). Let the dough rest for 30 minutes, then spread it again. The dough will shrink a bit, so stretch it up beyond the corners so that it will shrink to fit the pan. Once dough is stretched, cover with plastic wrap and set aside while you make the sauce, or for at least 30 to 45 minutes.",
      "Preheat the oven to 550\u00b0F, or as hot as your oven will go. In a medium saucepan, heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil over medium heat until it shimmers. Add in the garlic, red pepper flakes, and oregano, stirring until the garlic is fragrant. Tip in the can of tomatoes, the onion powder, the sugar, and a few pinches of salt, and stir to combine. Simmer, stirring occasionally, until reduced to roughly 3 cups.",
      "To Form the Pizza: Press down on the dough to get rid of any air bubbles. If using toppings, distribute half of them over the dough now. Top with the cheese, making sure to take it all the way to the edge (that's how you get the crispy edges). Add your remaining toppings.",
      "Put pizza(s) in the oven until edges are black and bubbly and the cheese is starting to brown, 12 to 15 minutes. Take out of the oven and transfer to the counter or a trivet. Run a metal spatula around the edges to loosen the pizza from the pan. Carefully lift it out and slide it onto a wooden cutting board. Spoon the warm sauce over the surface of the pizza in three narrow rows. (Lopez-Alt says you'll only need half the sauce, but it depends how saucy you like your pizza.) Slice into generous squares, making sure to keep at least one corner piece for yourself."

Refrigerate for at least an hour before using to allow the flavors to settle and develop. (You can also just stir the lemon juice, zest, garlic, and basil into about 2/3 cup of store bought mayo and it'll still be really good.)"

    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "Prepare the cabbage leaves: Bring a large pot of water to the boil. Meanwhile, remove 3 or 4 of the outer leaves of the cabbage. Wash and set them aside. Using a sharp utility knife, cut the core out of the cabbage to about half the depth of the head. (Don't worry if you can't get it out in one piece; keep working at it and cut it out bit by bit if necessary.) Wash the cored cabbage. When water is boiling, blanch the reserved outer leaves for about 2 minutes; remove them carefully from the pot with tongs, drain, pat dry, and reserve for covering the finished rolls as they bake. Next, lower the entire head of cabbage, hole-side-down, into the boiling water. After about 1 minute, some of the outermost leaves will pull away from the head and float; remove them from the pot, pat dry, and set aside. After 1 additional minute, remove the entire cabbage head to a clean surface. Gently pull away the whole leaves from the head that come off easily, and, as with the others, pat them dry and set aside. Return cabbage head to the boiling water to again blanch it briefly before removing to peel off any leaves that remain attached. Repeat this process until all leaves at least the size of your palm (about 3 inches by 3 inches) have been removed and patted dry.",
      "Make the filling: Heat 2 Tablespoons of olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the onion and fry until it is translucent and golden, about 5-7 minutes. Add garlic and fry 1 minute more. Add rice and fry until it is well coated with oil and begins to turn translucent around the edges. Add stock and turn down the heat to low. Simmer about 5 minutes, until rice has absorbed all the liquid. Remove mixture from the heat and let cool completely. Meanwhile, in another skillet, heat 1 Tablespoon of the remaining olive oil over medium-high heat. Add mushrooms and fry until they have released all their moisture and have browned. Remove from heat and let cool. While onion-rice mixture and mushrooms are cooling, in a large bowl mix together with your hands the pork, dill, thyme, salt, chile flakes, and black pepper. Add cooled onion-rice mixture and mushrooms and mix again until all ingredients are evenly distributed.",
      "Prepare the roaster and assemble the rolls: Spread the remaining 2 Tablespoons olive oil in the bottom of a large roaster or casserole (at least a 7-quart capacity). Spread the bottom of the roaster with 1/3 of the sauerkraut and layer 1/3 of the smoked bacon on top. Take one cabbage leaf and place it on a cutting board. Using a sharp knife (a boning knife works well), shave down the thick centre vein so that the whole leaf is of uniform thickness. Turn the leaf if necessary so that the its base is pointing towards you. Place about 1-2 teaspoons (depending on size of leaf) of filling near the base, and press lightly to flatten it a bit. Fold the right side of the leaf over to cover the filling and then start rolling the leaf up, tucking in the left side of the leaf to seal the roll. Place the finished roll seam-side-down in the roaster. Continue making rolls until the bottom of the roaster is covered. Spread another 1/3 of sauerkraut and bacon on top of rolls and then make another layer. Repeat with final 1/3 sauerkraut and bacon and a third layer of cabbage rolls.",
      "Prepare the sauce and bake: Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F. In a large bowl, mix together the tomato juice and water. Pour over rolls in the roaster. The liquid should reach the top layer of cabbage rolls; pour in more water to reach the required level, if necessary. Tuck the bay leaves down the sides of the pot. Cover the top layer of rolls with the reserved whole cabbage leaves, overlapping them to fit. Cover the roaster with a lid and place in the preheated oven to bake for 1-1/2 hours. Remove the lid and bake for 1/2 hour more. Serve the rolls with a little sour cream or plain yogurt and a sprinkling of fresh dill."

      "First, warm up the milk and sugar in a small pot over medium heat until it reaches about 110 degrees. Make sure you stir the sugar the whole time it's heating, that way it'll dissolve instead of forming clumpy piles of sugar garbage.",
      "Take the milk off heat, stir in the yeast until it dissolves, then let it foam up for 10 minutes. If you don't see the foam; you screwed up. Do it again, or get a new batch of yeast.",
      "Whisk together the flour and salt in your stand mixer bowl. Make a well in the center and add the egg yolks, yeasty stuff, and butter.",
      "If you're lucky enough to have a stand mixer, put on the dough hook and mix it on medium for about 4 minutes. If you're not...guess you're gonna be kneading for a while. Either way, you want to mix until it forms a ball, then cover the top with plastic wrap and put it in a warm place to rise for an hour.",
      "Once the dough's had a chance to rise, put it on a floured flat surface and roll it out to about 3/8 of an inch thick. Use your preferred cookie cutter to cut them into circles, and don't cut out the holes in the middle. Yes, I know you're used to downing entire crates of donut holes on the way to your cubicle hell-hole in the morning, but we're filling these with cream, so you're gonna have to make do.",
      "Put the soon-to-be-doughnuts on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, spray the tops of the doughnuts with non-stick spray, then cover with plastic wrap and stick in a warm place for another 30 minutes.",
      "The dough should be doubled by now (key word: should). Once it is, pour enough vegetable oil in a large pot for the doughnuts to float in it. Heat it to 350 degrees, then fry the doughnuts for about a minute on each side, until they're golden brown.",
      "Let the doughnuts cool on a wire rack (and put some paper towels underneath so you don't go medieval on your kitchen counter with that boiling hot oil). When they're completely cool, start in on the cream and glaze.",
      "To make the filling, cream the butter in a stand mixer at medium speed for 2-3 minutes, then mix in 1 1/2 cups powdered sugar on low until it's combined.",
      "Next, add the cream and bourbon and mix on high for 3 minutes. Like I said up there, if you like bourbon (as every living, breathing human being should), give the filling a taste and add more if you want. Or just put it in a glass and drink it; I don't give a damn.",
      "The glaze is easy: just stir together the coffee and powdered sugar in a small bowl until it magically becomes glaze. You want it to just barely be thin enough to still drip off of your fork, so just add more coffee if it's too thick, and more sugar if it's too thin, until you get the right consistency.",
      "Next, with as little sexual innuendo as you can manage, use a pastry bag to fill the insides of the doughnuts with the cream filling. Make sure you watch the doughnuts while you do it: if they start to crack, that's when you wanna stop pushing the cream in there.",
      "Cover the doughnuts in glaze, check to make sure the kitchen's empty, then lick it off your fingers like the disgusting human being you are.",
      "After that, all that's left is to let the glaze set, and then pop a few in your mouth with a cup of coffee.",

      "Combine the water and apple cider vinegar in a measuring cup. Make a well in the flour/butter mixture and slowly stream 1/2 cup of water into the dough while mixing gently. Mix until the water is evenly distributed and the dough holds together when you squeeze it. It may look dry, and that's okay, just as long as it holds together when you squeeze it. If it is too dry, add more water, one tablespoon at a time. Chill the dough for one hour.",
      "After it has chilled, unwrap the dough and place it onto a lightly floured board. Pat the dough into a rough square, then roll it into an 8-inch x 11-inch rectangle. The dough will be a bit rough and crumbly and that's okay! With the long side of the dough facing you, gently fold the dough into thirds. Then turn the dough so the seam is at the top and parallel to your body. Repeat this process 2 more times then divide the dough in half, wrap each piece in plastic, and chill for at least 2 hours and up to 2 days before using.",
      "To make the pie: When you're ready to make the filling and assemble the pie, preheat oven to 400\u00b0 F.",
      "On a lightly floured surface, roll out one piece of the dough into a 12-inch (approximately) circle about 1/8-inch thick and place it into a 9 or 10 inch pie pan. Place in the fridge while you prepare the rest of the pie.",
      "Roll out the other piece of dough into a rough square, about 1/8-inch thick, and place it on a parchment-lined sheet pan in the fridge to chill. Prepare the filling while the dough chills.",

If the mixture looks extremely juicy, add in the extra tablespoon of flour. (Reserve the egg and coarse sugar to finish the pie.)",
      "Cut the square of chilled dough into 8 to 10 strips using a pastry cutter, pizza wheel, or long knife. I like strips that are about 1-inch wide, but you can make them a bit smaller -- and they definitely don't have to be perfect.",
      "To make a lattice top, starting from the top left corner of the pie, lay one strip of dough horizontally and one strip vertically, so that the horizontal strip is on the bottom. Lay a second horizontal strip about 1/2 inch below the top strip so that it overlaps the vertical strip. Fold the top horizontal strip to the left and lay another vertical strip about 1/2 inch to the right of the first one. Next, fold the top horizontal strip back over it. This way, the second vertical strip will go underneath the top horizontal strip and over top of the second horizontal strip. Fold the first vertical strip up and lay down a third horizontal strip. Fold the vertical strip back down. Next, fold the second horizontal strip to the left and place a third vertical strip. Fold the horizontal strip back over the pie. Fold the middle vertical strip up and lay down the fourth horizontal strip. Fold the top and third horizontal strip to the left and place a fourth vertical strip. Continue until all strips are used and the top of the pie is covered.",
      "Trim the edges of the dough evenly, then fold the bottom dough up and over the lattice strips and crimp the edges of the dough. Slide the whole pie into the fridge or freezer for about 15 minutes before you bake it to firm up the crust. When you are ready to bake, carefully and gently brush the top of the pie with a beaten egg and sprinkle with a healthy dose of coarse sugar.",
      "Put the pie on a baking sheet to catch any drips and bake for 15 minutes on the lowest rack of your oven, then lower the oven temperature to 375\u00b0 F and bake for 35 to 45 minutes, or until the crust is deep golden brown and the juices bubble. Cool the pie completely before serving."

If the dough is too sticky and wet, add 1 tablespoon of flour at a time and knead until the dough is smooth.

Begin tapping the top of the butter with your rolling pin, and then pound more forcefully once the flour sticks to the butter.",
      "Pound the butter flat. (You want to end up with one large piece of butter, so if you're using two sticks of butter, quickly smoosh them together with your fingers between poundings.) Then fold the butter in half using a spatula to avoid warming the butter with your hands. Pound the butter flat and fold it in half again. Repeat another 2 to 3 times until the butter is very pliable, flattens and folds easily. Sprinkle with additional flour if needed to prevent the butter from sticking.",

You will do four \"turns\" before you finish the [i]kouign-amann[/i]. Remember that the butter shouldn't get too warm. If you have to stop the turning process to answer the phone, etc., put it in the fridge for a few minutes.)...Flour the counter, then place the chilled dough on top, and roll it to a rectangle 12 inches by 20 inches.",

If any sugar falls out, press it back into the folds. You have now finished 4 total turns. Move the dough to the baking sheet, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate 30 minutes. Meanwhile, liberally butter the insides of the muffin tins (total of 12 muffins).",

Add nuts on top, if desired. Fold the corners of each square toward the center. Pick up each pastry and tuck it into the muffin tins. Don't worry if it feels like you're squishing them...That's okay.",
      "At this point you can cover the muffin tins and transfer them to the fridge overnight. If you do, bring them to room temperature and let rise about an hour before cooking. Otherwise, loosely cover the muffin tins with plastic and let them rise at room temperature until slightly puffy, about 30 to 40 minutes.",

Put the kouign-amann in the oven and bake for 30 to 40 minutes, rotating the tray halfway through baking. They are done when the tops are deep golden and the tips look like they are just beginning to burn.",
      "Remove the kouign-amann from the oven and let them cool about 5 minutes (just until they're ready to handle or they'll be difficult to take from the pan.) Using a knife and/or spoon, take the pastries out of the muffin cups onto a cooling rack. Serve when cool enough to eat. We actually like them better the day after they're made."

Once you can hear it simmering, remove the lid, and increase the heat to medium high. You will need to keep a pretty close eye on the pan, and swirl the pan occasionally. If you are using a candy thermometer you will notice the mixture hovers near the boiling point for a while then starts to climb fairly rapidly. As the mixture approaches 310 degrees F, you will want to start swirling it fairly frequently as caramelization is imminent. Once caramel color is to your liking remove pan from heat. The pan will retain some heat so I like to remove the caramelized sugar mixture from the heat at about 325-330 degrees F, or when it is a golden brown color.",
      "Slowly pour the warm cream mixture through a mesh strainer into the the sugar mixture. It will boil violently and create hot steam, so use caution.

Stir often, scraping the bottom of the pan. As you get close to your target temperature you may want to turn the heat down to low if you are using a gas stove, or off if you are using electric to slow things down. Your caramels can go from too soft to tooth breaking within a short time frame. You will also want to stir almost continuously as you get close to your target temp to prevent burning.",

Use parchment paper \"sling\" to remove from the pan, then cut caramel into 1-inch squares, or whatever size pieces you prefer. I periodically spray my knife with non-stick spray to help cut the caramels. Wrap individually with waxed paper, and store in an airtight container."

Fennel fronds, tarragon, thyme leaves, small mint or basil leaves, or a few snipped chives would work well.\r\n\r\n- If you don't plan to eat all the soup at once, add the lemon juice and vinegar only to what you plan to eat at one sitting. They will cause the soup to lose its color if added too far in advance. (It tastes fine, but looks a little drab.)\r\n\r\n- For a vegetarian or vegan version, substitute a creamy feta or some finely-chopped pistachios for the prosciutto.",

Cover and cook, stirring occasionally, until very tender, about 20 minutes. You don't want the fennel to brown. Add the zucchini and cook for 5 minutes. Add the spinach, parsley, peas, garlic, the remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt and 3 cups of water. Raise the heat to medium and cook, covered, until the spinach has just wilted and the peas are tender, about 5 minutes longer. Take care not to overcook the vegetable or the soup will lose its bright color.",

Take care not to fill your blender more than 2/3 full so the steam from the soup doesn't blow the top off and burn you. If you don't have a blender powerful enough to puree the soup very fine, strain it through a fine mesh sieve. Transfer the pureed soup to a large bowl, thin with cold water to your desired consistency and place in the fridge to cool completely.",
      "Remove the soup from the fridge 30 minutes to one hour before serving so it can warm up a bit. (When it's ice cold, it looses some of it's depth.) Add the lemon juice and vinegar just before serving. Taste and add more salt and/or acid as necessary.",

      "Warm large heavy bottomed pot (I use a Le Creuset cast iron dutch oven) over medium/low heat and add 2 tablespoons olive oil. Add onion and saute for about 10 minutes. Stir occasionally with wooden spoon. Keep a close eye on the onions. You don't want them to burn. When they have turned a nice golden color and are sizzling nicely, open tomatoes, drain most of the liquid out of the can and reserve. Add tomatoes to pot and bring to a boil, then turn the heat down to a low simmer. Cook for about 25 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add reserved tomato juice to sauce if it is looking too dry, but be careful not to add too much. This sauce creates additional liquid once the shellfish is added, and you don't want the sauce to be too watery when it finishes cooking.",
      "While sauce is cooking, prepare fish. Rinse squid in a colander. If any remaining cartilage or membrane is on the squid, remove with a sharp knife. Cut squid into rings about 1/4-1/2 inch wide. If you are lucky enough to have the tentacles, roughly chop them. Rinse clams in cold water. If any clams have started to open, discard.",
      "Put pot of water on to boil for the pasta. Check on sauce. After the sauce has cooked about 20-25 minutes, add salt, about 1/4 teaspoon at a time. (I add about a teaspoon total of salt.) Keep tasting, until the flavors seem balanced. The tomatoes should have a fresh, but not raw taste. Add a grind or two of black pepper or the crushed red pepper flakes to taste.",
      "Turn heat up to medium/low. Add squid bodies and tentacles. When mixture comes back to a gentle simmer, reduce heat. After about 8-9 minutes, add clams to pot and partially cover with lid. When squid has been in the pot about 12 minutes, start tasting it. I like squid best with an al dente texture, it should taste toothsome, but not raw. But it gets rubbery within seconds, so the minute you think it's done take it immediately off the heat. Clams should open within about 8 minutes or so. Make sure that they are submerged into the sauce. That helps to speed them along. Add parsley and stir into sauce.",
      "While fish is cooking, add pasta to boiling water. Give it a good stir. Then add garlic, remaining 1/3 cup olive oil and basil leaves to cold skillet. Turn heat on low. When you hear the basil leaves crackle and the oil start to bubble, take off the heat. Strain oil and discard garlic and basil. After the sauce is off the heat, add basil and garlic flavored oil to the sauce. Mix in to combine.",
      "Taste pasta. When it is al dente, drain in a colander, reserving about 1/2 cup of pasta water. Add a ladleful of pasta water to big spaghetti bowl or serving platter to warm. Discard water. Add a ladleful of sauce with fish to bottom of the bowl. Sprinkle with cheese. Top with a layer of spaghettini. Add more sauce, fish and cheese to bowl, with another layer of spaghettini. Keep layering ingredients (almost like making a lasagna) until bowl is full. Sprinkle additional cheese and a shower of basil on top. Surround pasta with additional squid and clams.",

      "If using corn husks or banana leaves, take one leaf and tear off strips along the ribs to make ties. Or employ some kitchen string. Place a few tablespoons of filling in the centre of the wrap, add a boiled egg quarter and fold the (width/shorter) sides in, so that one overlaps the other. You will end up with a long, flat 'soon to be' parcel. Fold the top and bottom ends in , overlapping again. . Then use the tie to bind around the middle of the parcel. Continue till all your filling is used up. Place in a steamer and cook or in a pot. Pour in a couple of cups of water - not to cover the wraps but up to a third of the way up. You could always start out with a little and add more water as necessary. They should be ready after half an hour of cooking on the stove top.",

Then push cup in a corner inside microwave and place bowl. Close microwave and avoid opening. The ideal recipe to rise dough is 85F but doing that trick with the microwave helps.

When you are ready to bake it, take pan out and to let the dough stand outside at room temperature until it's doubled in size, then bake as directed.

(If you do not have a steamer pot, checkout Food52, How to Hack a Steamer). Cover tightly with a lid and steam over boiling water for 45 minutes.",

      "About 20 minutes before the tamales are done, start working on the shrimp. Combine the orange juice, lime juice, lime zest, garlic, soy sauce, and sriracha in a mixing bowl. Add the shrimp and marinate for 15 minutes. Heat a large saute pan over medium-high heat and add the olive oil. Remove the shrimp from the marinade and add to the pan. Tossing frequently, cook for 2-3 minutes, or until just cooked through.",

According to Amanda Feifer of Phickle, who frequently cites Sandor Katz's The Art of Fermentation tome, \"The colder temperature will slow but not stop fermentation. The longer it sits, the more acidic it will get. Keeping ferments in fitted containers will help keep them fresh for longer. That sizing down of jars and making sure that the vegetables stay under a thin layer of brine will give you a very long fridge life. Higher salt content will also help preservation. You can also leave them at room temperature and eat them from the jar, but they will continue to sour much more rapidly [than if kept in the fridge]... The test for fermenty goodness is always your senses: if it looks good, smells good and tastes good, it is good.\""

If you need to purge the clams (if they haven't already been purged and de-sanded where you bought them), at about 1 hour before you plan on cooking them, place the clams in a large, wide shallow dish such as a lasagne tray, cover with an inch of salt water (for 4 cups of fresh water, 2 tablespoons of salt, which is similar to the salinity of seawater). Let the clams purge 1 hour at most. Discard the water, being careful not to pour the filtered grit back over the shells. In a wide skillet, open the clams over high heat. A tight-fitting lid helps this along, it should take a few minutes of shaking the pan to move them around and let the ones on the bottom come to the top to open. When they've opened, turn off heat and strain the liquid produced from the clams-set this aside. Remove the clams from their shells (save a handful in their shells for garnish, if you like). Set aside.",

You are looking for a mixture that is the texture of risotto-soupy but not too stiff/solid. You may need to add a splash of water if the mixture gets too thick and the fregola are still too al dente.

Make sure that the baking dish is large enough to hold the pork and half a gallon of apple cider, with extra room to spare (this will keep juices from overflowing onto the oven floor and give you plenty of room for basting).

Dump the cherries into the bowl with the flavor ingredients called for in the recipe and proceed as directed, cooking on high heat to evaporate the juices quickly so that the cherries cook as briefly as possible. After scraping the glazed cherries back into the bowl, add the reserved cherry juice to the skillet and simmer for a minute or two until the juice is reduced and thickened; the bubbles will be large and foamy. Scrape the syrup into the bowl with cherries. Taste and correct the flavor with drops or pinches of extra flavoring from the recipe."

      "(Optional step, skip if you're using ground spices instead of whole)\r\nHeat a large saucepan over medium heat (with no oil) and toast the fenugreek, cumin and coriander seeds, turning regularly with a fork, until they become fragrant, about 3 minutes. You will start to smell their aroma when they are ready. Remove from the pan and grind them in a mortar and pestle. (or a spice grinder if you own one)",
      "In the same pan you used to toast the spices, heat the 2 tablespoons coconut oil over medium heat while you finely chop the onion. Add the cinnamon, ground coriander, fenugreek and cumin, cloves, and both cardamoms to the pan and fry for 2 minutes so they release their fragrant flavours. Add the onions and a teaspoon of salt and saute until they become sweet, translucent and caramalised. About 15-25 minutes. You want them well cooked so they almost dissolve into the sauce.",
      "While the onions are cooking with the spices, skin and deseed a tomato by scoring a cross through the skin of the tomato, plunging it into almost boiling water for a minute, peeling off the skin, removing the seeds and chopping it.",
      "To the pan with the onions, add the ginger, garlic, tomato, and chilli powder and cook over medium heat until they tomato and onions have broken down into a sweet mush - about 5 minutes. Taste the tomato/onion/spice mix and if there is any bitterness add a teaspoon of maple syrup or sugar. \r\nMeanwhile, chop the spinach and kale finely by hand using a large knife and your best rocking-chopping action. Reserve some of the water that has drained from the greens, you might need it later.",
      "Add the spinach and kale to the pan and cook for about 3-6 minutes. At this point, fish out the whole spices with a fork - the cloves, cinnamon stick, and cardamom pods. \r\nBlend the spinach either using a hand blender or a freestanding blender until almost smooth. If you've used a freestanding blender, add the mixture back to the pan. Now you should gauge how much water you need to add. Young spinach contains more water than older leaves so if the sauce looks a little dry, add some of the water you collected from draining the spinach - I add about 1/4 cup, depending on the type of greens I use. \r\nAdd the cream and nutmeg and mix well to incorporate it into the spinach mixture. At this point, check for seasoning and add more salt, pepper and chilli powder to your taste.",

If it's too thin, scoop out the meat and reduce the sauce until you're happy with it by bringing to a boil. Return the meat to the pot.

      "First, get yourself a large pot and pour in the milk, sugar, salt, and a half cup of the cream.",
      "Put the mint in and press it into the sides of the pot with a wooden spoon. You want to get the oils out of those leaves, so make sure you're not gentle. If the leaves look like they were just on the losing end of a boxing match, you're in good shape (in other words: bruise 'em).",
      "Turn up the heat to medium and wait until it starts steaming, but don't let it boil. Once it's steaming, take it off heat, cover it, and let it steep for an hour.",
      "While that's getting tasty, get a big metal bowl and fill it with ice. Pour the rest of the cream in a slightly smaller bowl and put that on top of the ice so it gets nice and cold.",
      "Once the hour's up, put the pot back on medium heat until it's steaming again.",
      "Get another medium-sized bowl and whisk the egg yolks in it, then slowly pour in the hot cream and whisk like a fucking madman while you do it, otherwise you're gonna end up with gross, minty scrambled eggs.",
      "Pour the stuff back into your pot, put it (yet again) back on medium heat, and stir for about five minutes. When it's thick enough that you can run your finger across the back of the spoon and leave a trail, you're good.",
      "Next, pour it through a strainer into the bowl of chilled cream. Make sure you press that mint down again; you want to get every last bit of minty goodness out of those babies.",
      "Stir in the lime juice, lime zest, cachaca, and vanilla.",
      "Let the ice cream chill in the refrigerator overnight, then do what the nice people who wrote the instructions to your ice cream maker say to do.",
      "After your ice cream has actually turned into ice cream, stick it in the freezer while you get started on the macaroons.",
      "Preheat your oven to 350.",
      "Mix together the sugar and coconut in a big-ass bowl, mix in the egg whites and almond extract, and spread it out in a layer about a 1/2 inch thin (I didn't do this, and that's why mine look like someone just piledrived some cookies into a wad of ice cream).",
      "Cook it for 10-12 minutes until the macaroons are just a little golden brown, then take them out, move 'em to a cooling rack, and let them cool completely.",
      "Cut the slab of macaroons into two squares, and put one square in whatever vaguely square-shaped container you have handy.",
      "Let the ice cream sit at room temperature for about five minutes, then spread the ice cream on the first layer of coconut goodness and top with the other layer. Y'know...like a sandwich.",
      "Freeze the whole thing for a couple of hours, let it sit again at room temp for 5-ish minutes, and cut into squares, rectangles, dodecahedrons, or whatever shape you fucking want. It's an ice cream sandwich, not a freaking UN convention.",
      "Wrap them in wax paper, freeze them a little longer, and eat."

Let cool until you can handle them. (Tip: wear gloves or place a plastic baggie over your hand to protect your fingers from getting stained.) Using a paring knife, peel the skin off the beets. It should come off easily. Slice into 1/4 inch rounds. Set aside.",
      "FIGS & BALSAMIC REDUCTION - Heat a small saucepan to medium-high heat. Sear the fig halves, flat side down for a few minutes, just until the surface caramelizes a bit. Remove and set aside. In the same pan, lower the heat and add the balsamic vinegar and sugar. Let simmer until the sauce becomes thick and syrupy. Set aside.",
      "CUCUMBER RELISH - Cut the cucumber into a fine dice. You can leave the skin on if you're using lemon cucumbers since their skin is softer than regular green cucumbers. Mix with rice vinegar, a sprinkle of salt and pepper, and set aside.",
      "FRIED SUMMER SQUASH - In a deep frying pan, heat 2 inches of oil to right below smoking point. I like the taste of olive oil (don't use the expensive stuff), but you can use vegetable oil if you prefer. Prepare your assembly line: squash sliced into 1/4 inch rounds, egg wash, dish filled with bread crumbs seasoned with lavender and a pinch of salt and pepper. I prefer panko because of its extra crunch, but you can use regular dried breadcrumbs as well. Dip each slice of squash into egg wash, then coat with breadcrumbs. To test the oil, drop a little piece of eggy breadcrumb into the pan. If it just sinks, the oil is not hot enough. If it burns quickly, the oil is too hot. If it starts to bubble right away and floats, it is just the right temperature and you're now ready to start frying up your squash. Let the fried squash drain on a plate lined with paper towels. Sprinkle with a little salt while they're still hot. Set aside.",
      "CHEESE - You can use any cheese you'd like, however, fresh goat cheese and beets are a traditional pairing. If you're like me though, and have an aversion to goat cheese (I know, one of my great downfalls as a foodie, I disappoint myself in this respect time after time), try a gooey burrata, or Cowgirl Creamery's buttery Mt. Tam, or a ricotta salata for something sharper and firmer.",

      "MAKE THE BREAD DOUGH: In a bowl, combine the water, fresh yeast and sugar, stirring/mixing till the yeast is dissolved. Combine the flours with the salt then using a dough whisk or a wooden spoon, gently add the bread-salt mix to the yeasty water, stirring till the flour is all used up. Carefully shape the dough into a ball and place in bowl. Gently oil the top of the dough and cover lightly, or with greased clingfilm (oiled side down). Allow dough rise for a couple of hours, then gently turn out onto a lightly floured surface. Alternatively, place dough in the fridge and use later. If using after refrigeration, allow dough rest out of the fridge for 10 - 20 minutes before use",
      "MIX THE FILLING: In a bowl, combine the provolone, pecorino, ham, bacon, boiled eggs, olives and crushed dried chillies and oregano.",
      "MAKE CASATIELLO NAPOLETANO:Oil a large bundt pan/angel food tin with some olive oil. Then lightly flour a surface and roll out the dough into a rectangle 1/2 cm thick. Place the filling in the centre of the rectangle, lengthways and sprinkle some black pepper over to the top.",
      "You will need to roll the dough into a sausage or cigar so pull one side in over the top, holding both ends of the dough and bringing in. Then grab the centre of the other side (and not the ends) and bring over the top to seal (and form a crown). Pinch the ends to seal and bring them together to form a coil.",
      "Gently lift dough and place in greased bundt pan. If you don't have one, place on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Leave to rise at room temperature for 30 minutes to 1 hour, or until risen.",
      "While the dough is resting, preheat the oven to 230\u00b0 C. \r\nBrush the casatiello with olive oil and bake it for 10 minutes at 230 \u00b0C, then lower the temperature to 200 \u00b0C and cook for another 30-40 minutes. The casatiello should be cooked through and golden, though testing it will be toguh as the melted cheesy centre won't give the dry response you seek.",
      "Remove from the oven and allow to cool down for about 10 minutes in the pan. Then remove and let cool on a rack. When cold, tuck in and enjoy some soft, warm melted cheese. If like me, midnight saw this fresh out of the oven with work the following day, allow it to rest overnight in a paper (not plastic) bag, or wrapped with paper.",
      "On the day, pack your basket. Place the bread in an oven on 180\u00b0C and let warm through. Then grab some pesto or chimichurri...if you wish, maybe jars of green salad, wine glasses and a bottle of prosecco with flowers in your hair."

    "title": "squashducken (the mammoth stuffed squash) with sage-hazelnut pesto",
    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "Start with your largest squash. Do not peel the skin of this one, as it is the outermost ring of your squashducken and the skin is vital for the structural integrity. Instead, use a very sharp knife to remove its hat (as if you were carving a jack-o'-lantern) and then scoop out its insides. As you work, I recommend you separate the inedible versus edible innards of your squash into two separate bowls: You'll probably be scooping away a lot of edible squash flesh that you can use later for roasting, soup, etc.",
      "Once you've emptied out the insides of the largest squash, you'll need to see what else needs to be done in order to get the next largest one to fit inside of it. You might need to slice off more of the squash near its top in order to make its bowl wider, or you might need to really go at the insides with a spoon to scrape away excess flesh. But don't panic if things seem like they'll be snug: You will be peeling the skin of the second-largest squash and whittling away its outsides. You can make it work!",
      "Oil the roasting pan, then set the hollowed, beheaded large squash inside of it. (I used our biggest Dutch oven, which cradled the squash nicely.)",
      "Now start on the second largest squash. Peel it, cut off its head, and scoop out the insides. You might need to whittle away at its flesh-thinning it out from both the inside and the outside will help ensure that it fits into the biggest squash. As you work, continue to judge whether your squash will fit inside its larger counterpart. BUT do be careful pressing it into the larger squash before you are certain-they can get stuck that way (it's happened to me).",
      "Repeat this beheading and bowl-ifying process with all of the squash, making to periodically gauge whether they are going to fit inside each other. Once that's done, congratulate yourself: The hardest part is over!",
      "Now you're ready to par-cook. Put the second biggest squash (remember: the largest squash does not need to be par-cooked) in a microwave-safe dish with a bit of water (1/8 to 1/4 inch is sufficient) on the bottom. Heat in the microwave in 5-minute increments until the squash is pliable; you should be able to wiggle it little without fear of breaking or tearing. The largest squash I microwaved took 8 to 10 minutes to reach this stage. Transfer the squash to a cooling rack while you microwave all of the other squash.",
      "PLANNING NOTE: You can (and I did) microwave one squash while carving the next one. But this could result in an issue. If you realize that the squash you've microwaved should have been thinned out further to fit the other squash, you might run into a major problem. So multitask, but with caution.",
      "Once all of your squash (except for that biggest one) have been microwaved, it's time to assemble. PASS GO AND COLLECT $200 i.e. scroll down and make pesto.",
      "Make the pesto: In a small pan over very low heat, warm all but 2 tablespoons of the olive oil, the sage, and the garlic just until the oil bubbles.",
      "Pour the oil into small bowl, fishing out the garlic cloves. Place the toasted hazelnuts in mini food processor along with the garlic cloves and process until a fine crumble. Add to the bowl of the sage and oil, then add the cheese and the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil and stir to combine. Season to taste. This pesto is more nutty than herby or oily, so do not be alarmed in the mixture is dryer than you're used to.",
      "Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0 F.",
      "Put the largest squash (the uncooked one) in the large, oiled roasting dish if you haven't already. Prick it all over its insides with a fork, then rub with olive oil. Sprinkle with salt, pepper, and paprika. Coat in a generous amount of the pesto (I used by hands for this task), then sprinkle with breadcrumbs and Parmesan.",
      "Rub the outside of the second largest squash with olive oil, then gently snuggle it into the largest squash. Continue with the oiling/seasoning/pesto-ing/breadcrumb-ing/chees-ing process until you've reached the innermost squash.",
      "Smear the rest of the pesto into any crevices, sprinkle with Parmesan, breadcrumbs, salt, pepper, and paprika. If you notice any moats or orifices, you can fill these spaces with cubed bread, which will absorb the delicious squash and pesto juices.",
      "Now you're ready to bake. Cover the roasting dish loosely with aluminum foil, then bake for 1 hour and 30 minutes. It will probably take need 2 hours total before the outer squash ring is cooked (make sure it's fork-tender and a texture you'll want to eat!), but I like to keep a close eye on it in the last 30 minutes.",
      "In the last 5 or 10 minutes, you can uncover the squash, sprinkle it with Parmesan and breadcrumbs, and get the top nice and toasty, if you'd like.",
      "Once the squashducken is finished, take it out of the oven and leave it alone until it's cool enough to handle. Then, get a friend to assist you! Get out your largest serving platter and position it near the pan. As one of you holds the pan and tilts it towards the platter, the other should assist with transferring the squashducken onto the platter. Let it cool until warm, then slice it into impressive wedges.",

As the dough comes together add remaining water to the center and stir with the knife to bring in the remaining flour, working from the center outwards, so as to minimize the amount of dough that sticks to the side of the bowl. Dough should be slightly sticky, but not smooth at this point. If it is too sticky add a few pinches of bread flour.",

Right side folded first, then left side over that {stretch and pull, but don't let the dough tear}.

When bread has a nice dark crust, remove to the counter and while holding with one hand (use an oven mitt) check the temperature of the bread by inserting a thermometer in the bottom of the bread. If it reads 200-205\u00b0, it's done! Add back to the oven if any less than 200.",

It should clump into a big ball; if it doesn't, drizzle in another tablespoon of the water. You want to add as little liquid as possible.",

Once they soften and begin to brown on each side, return the flame to low and allow to slowly caramelize. During this time, it is important to make sure the onions are spread as evenly as possible across the pan. Every few minutes, scrape the bottom and redistribute the onions so each gains the maximum amount of surface area. The intention is to slowly crisp the onions by enticing the remaining liquids to sweat out, and for the onions to sweeten by condensing in their own juices. If you stir too often, the onions will turn to mush. This process takes about 40 minutes.",

      "Pour the warm milk into the bowl of a mixer. Sprinkle the yeast over it, then whisk it in. Add the flour and whisk to blend. Cover with plastic and allow to proof at room temperature for an hour. It will rise up fantastically in that time.",
      "While the sponge is proofing, saute the capicola. Warm a skillet with tablespoon or so of olive oil added over medium heat, then add the capicola. It's fine if it crisps a bit on the edges, but it shouldn't overcook, or it will be tough once baked into the bread. Remove it to a plate lined with paper towels. Fry the sage leaves in the rendered fat until they are nicely crisped. Remove to the same plate.",
      "Remove the plastic from the bowl and set it aside; you will use it again. To mix the dough, fit the hook to the mixer. Add the flour, salt, sugar, egg, and olive oil. Begin mixing. Once the dough comes together and leaves the sides and bottom of the bowl, continue kneading for about 5 minutes. Stop the mixer and pull off a walnut-sized piece of dough. Round it up briefly between your palms, then gently tease it down over your fingertips. You want to see if it forms a \"windowpane,\" which will tell you if you have adequately developed the gluten in the flour. If the dough tears before becoming nice and thin, it needs more kneading. Continue kneading in two or three-minute increments until the dough forms a good, strong windowpane.",
      "At that point, add the meat, cheese, and sage leaves and knead until most are incorporated throughout the dough. Add the sage leaves whole; once fried, they become very fragile, and the kneading action will fragment them. Turn the dough out onto your board and knead in the reluctant pieces of capicola and provolone.",
      "You can oil or pan spray the bowl, but honestly, the dough is so silken with olive oil that it isn't going to stick to anything. Cover the bowl again with your piece of plastic. Let dough proof at room temperature until you can poke it gently, and it retains the indentation. If it springs back, it needs to proof some more. As mentioned, this is a heavy dough, so it may take an hour-and-a-half to proof, depending on how warm your kitchen is at any given time of the year.",
      "You don't have to use a paper bag or mold to bake it, though it makes a great story if you do; a n 8\" or 9\" round cake pan will do nicely as well. Whichever you decide to use, oil or pan spray it. If you are using paper, set it on a baking sheet. Gently turn the dough out of the bowl. Shape it into a round ball, and set it in your baking form. Drape the piece of plastic over it and allow it to proof again until it retains the indentation of your finger, about an hour.",
      "While the bread is proofing, preheat the oven to 350 degrees. You don't need to score this bread before baking it. Set the pan or the baking sheet in the oven. and bake for 45 minutes, rotating it at the halfway point. When done, the dough should register 185 degrees on a thermometer. Be sure to take the temperature at the center.",
      "When done, remove from the oven and allow to cool for 15 minutes before slicing. Casatiello is definitely best when warm, and it makes the best toast you'll ever taste."

      "Clean the clams. Even when I get my clams from the market, I'll give them a brief scrub with a brush (without soap) under cold water to remove any lingering sand or grit. I have a method that works for me, which involves dumping all of the clams into the sink, and as they're scrubbed, adding them to a colander.",
      "Pour the wine and 1 1/4 cup water into a large pot. Then place a steamer in there, and add your clams. If you don't have a steamer, that's okay, but you might want to shift your clams around as you heat them so the bottom ones don't overcook on the bottom of the pot. Bring the heat up to medium and cover the pot until they open. The time needed really depends on the size of the clams; bigger ones need more time. Generally this takes around 15-20 minutes.",
      "While your clams are steaming, you can prep the other food by chopping the onions, celery, bacon, and thyme. You can also grate and chop the potatoes. Generally I peel both, chop them in half. One half gets grated and one half gets chopped finely (about 1/4 inch). You want those chopped pieces to be really small so they don't take forever to cook in the soup. Don't be weirded out if the russet potato browns a little as it sits out as you're cooking the other steps of the recipe.",
      "When the clams have opened, remove them from the heat. When they're cool enough to handle, remove their clam bodies and chop them finely. I usually wash my hands again and do a quick massaging of them to make sure there aren't any shell bits. Place these in the fridge while you do the rest.",
      "Pour the liquid in the pan (your salty, homemade stock!) into a pitcher or large liquid measuring cup. Even though you'll only use 2 cups of it, pour it all into something so that the leftover clam bits sink to the bottom.",
      "Give your large pot a quick rinse and wipe. Then add the butter and the bacon on medium heat. You'll want to keep moving everything around with a wooden spoon so that nothing burns at all. You don't want any burned bits taking over the flavor of your chowder; it's all in the same pot from here!",
      "Once the bacon is pretty much cooked, but not crispy, you'll make a roux by adding the flour. This is going to thicken up the soup later, and add a nice toasted flavor. Keep moving the flour around in the grease, bacon, and butter mix until it turns slightly darker. This is called a blond roux. If you do burn this, it's not too late to turn back, rise the pan, and start over with new bacon and butter.",
      "Once the roux is slightly darker (2-3 minutes), add the celery and onion, continuing to stir. It is going to smell heavenly in a minute. Keep stirring slowly for about 3-4 minutes.",
      "Add 2 cups of the reserved stock. Try to do this all at once. There are different opinions out there on whether stock should be hot when added to hot roux, but as there are pros for both sides, I side on the one that doesn't require an additional pan on the stove. I have noticed that you're less likely to clump when adding the stock all at once though. Just add the 2 cups and stir quickly to combine.",
      "Once the broth is incorporated, add the grated potatoes and bay leaf. Push the veggies and bacon so that they are spread out across the pot so that everything is as covered by liquid as possible. Simmer for 12-15 minutes, stirring occasionally to break up any bits at the bottom of the pot.",
      "After the 12-15 minutes, remove the bay leaf and puree what's left in the pot. You can use a blender or a food processor to get the job done, but I love using a handheld blender. If you have one, try tilting the pot so that you can just hold your blender in place and let gravity do the work for you. Be patient and try to blend this as smoothly as you can.",
      "Once the potatoes are soft, add the cream, thyme, and tobasco. Start with 12 dashes or so of the hot sauce, and then taste to see if you want more. Then add the reserved clams.",
      "The stock is really never the same when working with fresh clams, so at this point I usually test the soup liberally, and see if it's too salty. If you think you have too much salt, try adding a teaspoon of fresh lemon juice at a time. I never add more than 3 teaspoons (1 tablespoon). You'll also notice that I prefer my chowder more brothy than other creamy varieties. This is so I can overload it with bread. If you want to thicken and cream up your soup, mix 1 cup of cream with 1/4 cup flour. Then add a little bit at a time to the pot, as it thickens.",

In a frying pan, heat up the olive oil and saute the fennel seeds for about a minute until they become fragrant.

      "To make the sausage rolls, put a long tube of filling on the side closest to you, slightly less than an inch 'tube' will be fine. Dab some water on the pastry along the filling(the side furthest away from you). Next, roll the pastry over the filling, and press gently to seal, and trim it away from the large sheet. Doing it this way ensures the seal is underneath the roll, so it won't burst open when baking. With a sharp knife, slice them to whatever length you prefer, the picture here shows them at 1.5 inches. You'll find you get two rolls out of one sheet, with about 2 inches of pastry left over. Use these bits too, just rotate the pastry and repeat the process.",

      "If you are planning to steam the lobsters yourself, please know that it will take anywhere between 4-6 pounds of lobsters to yield 1 pound of meat. In my experience, steaming lobsters beats boiling every time -- there's less of a chance that the lobsters will be overcooked and they retain more of that \"fresh from the sea\" taste.\r\n\r\nBring about 2-3 inches of water to a boil in a large lobster pot or stockpot. Some people add salt to the water but I never do. When the water reaches a rocking boil, layer the lobsters in the pot and cover with the lid. Resist the temptation to peek for about 10 minutes. Depending on the size of the lobsters, they may need to cook for another 5-10 minutes. The lobsters will be done when the shells are bright red and the meat is white and not opaque. Remove from the pot and place in a colander. Rinse the hot lobsters under cold water to stop any additional cooking. \r\n\r\nWhen the lobsters have cooled, crack the shells and dig out the meat. Feel free to suck on a leg or two while you work.",

      "It's wonderful as a simple lobster salad atop soft butter lettuce leaves lightly dressed with lemon vinaigrette.\r\n\r\nOr if you prefer an old-school lobster roll, generously butter the sides of 4 split top hotdog rolls (Pepperidge Farm makes the best) and toast them in a frying pan until golden brown. Layer a piece or two of lettuce inside the toasted roll and top with a generous helping of lobster salad. A side of good potato chips and a cold beer are musts!"

    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "Begin by soaking your beans: The night before (or 6-8 hours before) you are going to make this dish, put beans in a big bowl. Add enough water so that beans are covered by at least four inches. Let beans soak in water for about 6-10 hours.",
      "Cooking the beans: When you are ready to cook the beans, drain soaking liquid from beans. Put beans in a large saucepan or Dutch oven. Add water, lard, 1 small chopped onion, and oregano. Turn burner on to medium high. When bean liquid starts to boil, turn heat down to low, and simmer for two hours. Add salt, 1/2 teaspoon at a time, until liquid and beans taste well seasoned. If beans are not tender and taste somewhat al dente, keep simmering them on low heat. When beans have finished cooking, remove from heat. (If you are using canned beans, proceed to step 3. Just make sure to drain and thoroughly rinse your beans.)",
      "Beginning the chile -- roasting the bell peppers: After the beans have been cooking for about 1 1/2 hours, you can begin the chile preparations in earnest. Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Put both bell peppers on a foil-lined baking sheet. Roast peppers, turning with tongs, until skin is completely blackened and blistered. (This will take about 10-15 minutes per side). If you are lucky enough to have a gas stove, roast peppers directly on the burner. After peppers are roasted, remove from heat and put peppers in a bowl. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and let sit for ten minutes. Remove plastic wrap and peel peppers, then slice into thin strips.",
      "Preparing the spices: While peppers are roasting and beans are simmering, heat small skillet over medium low. Add red chile, ancho chile, cumin and oregano to pan. Stir constantly with a wooden spoon until chile powders have released their fragrances. When the chile smells pleasantly toasty, remove from heat.",
      "Making the chile: In large dutch oven or big saucepan/stock pot, heat vegetable oil over medium heat. Add ground bison and ground pork. Break up with a wooden spoon and cook meat, stirring occasionally, until it is a lovely brown color. Add large chopped onion to meat and cook until onion has softened (about 10-15 minutes). Add roasted peppers and garlic. After about a minute or two, when you smell the heady garlic aroma, add 2/3 of spice mixture. Coat meat, onions, and peppers with spice mixture, then add broth from beans (remove it a ladeful at a time) from pot and beef broth. Add beans to pot. It is okay if they are not finished cooking. They will continue to cook in the chile.Turn heat up to medium high. When chile begins to boil, turn heat down to low and let chile simmer. After chile has been simmering for about 30-40 minutes, taste and add salt, 1/2 teaspoon at a time until well seasoned. If chile does not seem spicy enough to your taste, add reserved spice mixture. Chile can keep cooking until you are ready to eat or you can serve it now. This makes a perfectly wonderful red chile bowl stew that you can serve in big bowls with lots of warmed corn or flour tortillas. But if you want to make chile tostadas for a party, proceed to the next step.",
      "Make tostadas and prepare garnishes: While chile is cooking, make pesto (below) and get your garnishes ready. Finely dice avocado and tomato. If you haven't already done so, grate cheese. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. About fifteen minutes before your guests are ready to eat, place tostada pieces on baking sheet. Heat tostadas in oven for about five minutes. Top each tostada with a small spoonful of chile and about a tablespoon of grated cheese. Add two or three pieces each of tomato and avocado to each tostada. Top with about a teaspoon of pesto and a teaspoon of sour cream. Add a few pieces of jalapeno. Put them on a nice ceramic platter, serve them to your guests, and watch them disappear!",
      "Combine cilantro, garlic and pumpkin seeds in a food processor. Pulse about five times, and then begin adding olive oil, 1/4 cup at a time, to the food processor, drizzling in a little bit at a time. After you have added a 1/2 cup, check consistency. You want it to be rather thick and not too oily. Add more oil if mixture seems too stiff. Add lime zest and 1/2 teaspoon salt to the processor. Pulse a few more times, and then taste to ensure that flavors are balanced. Add additional salt or lime zest if needed. You should taste a hint of sharpness from the garlic and the citrus should also be prominent. When the flavors are to your liking, set aside."

Leave edges unfinished at this point. Place pie on a foil-lined baking sheet with sides. In a small bowl beat egg whites with water (this is an egg wash). Brush bottom crust and sides with the egg wash. You won't use all of it. (It helps keep the filling from soaking through the bottom crust.) Set aside while you make the filling.",

      "In a bowl combine the sugar, cornstarch, flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt. Stir until evenly blended. Transfer to a 3-quart saucepan and add apple juice, vanilla, and lemon juice (if using). Stir well to dissolve the sugar. Bring to a low boil over medium-high heat, stirring constantly. Cook until thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. Remove from the heat.",
      "Stir the apples into the thickened apple juice and toss until evenly distributed. Set to the side to cool slightly.",

Brush the edges of the bottom crust with water or additional egg wash and press the top and bottom crusts together. Trim so there is about 1/4-inch overhang beyond the edge of the pie pan. Flute the edge of pie crust. Brush the top of the pie with egg wash and sprinkle with the coarse sugar. Using a sharp knife, cut several vents in the top to allow steam to escape during baking. You can decorate with extra pieces of dough if desired, securing them with egg wash or water.",
      "Transfer pie on the baking sheet to the hot oven. Bake until both the top and bottom crusts are golden brown and the juices are bubbling in the center of the pie, about 60 to 75 minutes. You should be able to hear the pie bubbling. If the pie is browning on top too quickly, tent it with a piece of tin foil.",
      "Let pie cool at least 1 to 2 and preferably 3 hours before slicing. The apples will reabsorb some of the juices while the pie rests and your slices will be picture perfect.",
      "* Using a glass pie pan will allow you to see when the bottom crust is cooked all the way through. Raw dough will have a grey'ish color. The main mistake people make is under-cooking their pies."

Spoon 4 tablespoons of the prepared ricotta filling 1 inch from the edge of each crepe. Roll evenly into a log, keeping the filling even as you roll. Repeat with the remaining crepes. Trim each end of the manicotti about 1/2\" so they fit in the pan neatly and don't overlap. Place manicotti seam side down. Spoon 2 cups of sauce over the middle of the manicotti. Sprinkle with grated Grana Padano cheese. Top each manicotti with a whole basil leaf. Spray the top with cooking spray. Cut a 13x9 piece of foil or parchment and coat one side with cooking spray. Cover the baking dish loosely with the sprayed side down. Bake about 20 minutes. Uncover and bake another 15- 20 minutes until the topping is golden brown and the sauce is bubbling on the sides. Let rest about 15 minutes before serving to firm up the manicotti filling."

      "Fold a kitchen towel so it creates a thick nest and the coconut sits on top. Position the coconut so its \"eyes\" (the three holes) are facing up. Place the tip of the screw driver or other sharp pointed item into one eye, and use the hammer to tap the screw driver through the eye, swiveling the screw driver as you remove it to make a bigger hole. Repeat this with the other two eyes, then tip the coconut over a bowl and let the water slowly drain out. Strain this through a fine strainer, and pour into a glass jar. Refrigerate it and use it later for cooking, baking, or drinking.",
      "Now place your coconut back on the towel, or on the floor. Use your hammer and whack around the coconut in a circle repeatedly. I find it really helpful to use a hammer with points on the end. I actually use a meat mallet and it works great. Be patient and just keep whacking the coconut in the same circle -- after 15 to 20 times around, it should crack into two halves.",
      "Once the coconut is broken in half, give the halves another couple of whacks to break them up.",
      "Now use the tip of your knife or the end of your screwdriver to pry the meat away from the shell. It should pop off pretty easily.",
      "If you want to shred your coconut, or plan on using the leftover meat for baking (more on that below), you'll want to peel it. Using a vegetable peeler, peel away the brown skin from the white meat. If you're only going to make coconut milk, though, you can skip this part.",
      "Place a fine mesh strainer over a large, high-sided bowl. Place a super-thin tea towel or cheesecloth over the strainer.",
      "Now add half the coconut meat and 3 cups water to a high-powdered blender or food processor and blend until the coconut seems \"shredded\" and the mixture is milkshake-like. Pour the mixture right on top of the cheesecloth and then gather the cheesecloth by the ends. Squeeze the milk out into the bowl until you feel like all of the milk has been squeezed out of the coconut. Either discard the shredded coconut left in the cheesecloth, or save it and add it to baked goods; if you want to swap it in for regular shredded coconut, dehydrate it in a low oven (or dehydrator) until it's dry, about 6 to 8 hours.",
      "Place the cheesecloth back over the strainer and repeat with the remaining coconut and 3 cups of water.",
      "Once all the coconut milk is in the bowl, you can whisk in the vanilla extract if desired. Pour the coconut milk into glass juice jars and refrigerate for up to 1 week. Be sure to shake the milk up before drinking, cooking, or baking."
