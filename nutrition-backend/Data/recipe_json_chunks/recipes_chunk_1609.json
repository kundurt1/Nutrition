This dries out the dough so that it can better absorb the eggs. Stir constantly to keep dough from scorching, although a sheen will form on the bottom of the pan.",
      "Place dough in bowl of stand mixer and set aside for 5 minutes to cool slightly.",
      "With the mixer on low, gradually add 3 of the warmed eggs, one at a time, waiting until each egg is absorbed before adding the next one. Separate the fourth egg and add the egg white only. (Save the yolk for the scrambled eggs, or discard.)",

On a baking sheet covered with parchment paper or coated with cooking spray, pipe 8 (5-inch) eclair shapes of dough, about 1 inch wide, at least 2 inches apart.",
      "Using a plant spritzer, lightly spray each eclair once with water. This will keep them moist so they'll swell as much as possible before firming up.",
      "Place baking sheet directly on the pizza stone or on bottom rack. Reduce oven temperature to 425 degrees. Bake 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees and bake for another 15 minutes. Do not open the oven door, or the puffs may collapse. After 30 minutes total baking time, remove pan from oven and pierce each eclair with a small knife to allow any steam to escape and to help them bake dry. Return to oven to bake for 10 minutes. Remove to a wire rack to cool.",
      "To assemble the eclairs: Slice each strip of bacon down the middle lengthwise so you have eight long strips. Wrap strips around asparagus spears in a spiral pattern and place on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, leaving at least an inch between them.",
      "Place pan on an oven rack positioned in the top third of the oven. Turn on oven to 400 degrees. (Bacon will hold its shape better if it starts cooking from a cold oven.) Bake for 10 minutes, then turn them and continue baking 10 to 15 minutes or until the bacon is crisp.",

Pour 2 Tablespoons (or so, depending on how big of a pan you use) of oil in the bottom of a medium/large pan. The oil should generously cover the bottom of the pan. Heat the pan over Medium/High heat. Put 3 test popcorn kernels in the pan and put on the cover. After the test kernels pop, add 1/2 cup of popcorn kernels to the pan. Take the pan off the heat when the sound of kernels popping slows down. Easy Peasy. And popcorn cooked this way tastes so much better than popcorn from the microwave.",
      "Once you have the popcorn made, salt it liberally. It is so nice to taste the salty popcorn with the sweet marshmallow coating. It's not quite like Kettle Corn but close. Then make sure you pull out all of the un-popped kernels. You don't want to bite into one of those!",
      "Now make the marshmallow mixture. Melt 1/4 cup of butter in a medium sauce pan. Once the butter is melted add 3 cups of mini marshmallows. Stir until the marshmallows are melted. Turn off the heat. Add a couple of drops of yellow food coloring and mix until the marshmallow mixture is a bright yellow. When you have a good yellow color, add in one very small drop of blue food coloring and stir. This combination of food coloring should get you the perfect \"Grinch Green\" marshmallow mixture.\nhttp://www.twosisterscrafting.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/grinch-popcorn-step2.jpg",
      "Slowly pour the marshmallow mixture over the popcorn. Using a spoon, gently fold the marshmallow mixture in with the popcorn until the popcorn is mostly covered. The amount of marshmallow mixture you want to add is really up to your own taste. The more you add, the stickier the popcorn will be so we suggest that you add it a bit at a time, stir the popcorn and give it a taste before you add more.\nhttp://www.twosisterscrafting.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/grinch-popcorn-step3.jpg",
      "Now pour the popcorn onto a cookie sheet covered with foil or a silpat liner. Drizzle a little bit of the remaining marshmallow mixture over the popcorn but do not mix it up.

Sprinkle the candy and mini marshmallows onto the popcorn, concentrating on the areas with the drizzled marshmallow mixture. Allow the popcorn to cool. Break apart into pieces and serve. This popcorn doesn't keep very well so we suggest that you make it as close to the time you're going to serve it as possible.\nhttp://www.twosisterscrafting.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/grinch-popcorn-step6.jpg"

      "Position one oven rack in the center of the oven. Preheat the oven to 250\u00b0F/121\u00b0C/gas 1. Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Using a pencil, in the center of the parchment paper, lightly trace a 9-inch circle along the bottom of a 9-in cake pan.",
      "For the swiss meringue: Place 1/3 cup chopped chocolate in a small heat proof bowl. Place in the microwave and heat in 30 second intervals, stopping to stir the chocolate with a spatula until it has melted, about 1-1.5 minutes. Set aside to cool.",
      "In a medium heat proof mixing bowl, add 1 1/2 cups sugar and 6-7 egg whites. Place the bowl over a large saucepan filled with 1-inch of simmering water set over a stove. Make sure the water does not touch the bottom of the bowl. Using a hand whisk, gently whisk the mixture until all the sugar has dissolved and the mixture registers to 165\u00b0F/73.9\u00b0C, 5-8 minutes.",
      "Remove the bowl from the saucepan and set over a towel shaped in a ring (this will prevent it from moving on the counter). Fit the KitchenAid(R) 7-Speed Hand Mixer with the whisk attachment. Place the whisk into the warmed egg white mixture, and turn the mixer to speed 7. Mix, moving the whisk in circles to help aerate the meringue, until it forms stiff peaks and has a sheen, 5-8 minutes. Reduce to speed 2, and while mixing, add1 1/4 tsp vinegar, 1 1/4 tsp cornstarch, and 1 tsp vanilla. Turn the mixer back to speed 7 and whip for another 30 seconds. Turn off the mixer.",
      "Using a large spatula, gently fold in 1/2 cup pistachios. Drizzle the melted chocolate (make sure it's not too hot or it will deflate the meringue) over the top of the meringue. Fold about 5 turns, taking care not to completely fold in the chocolate - it will naturally swirl as you shape the round!",
      "Spoon a small amount of meringue onto each corner of the rimmed baking sheet. Press the parchment (marked side down) onto the baking sheet to help secure the paper.",
      "Using a spatula or large spoon, gently mound the meringue in the center of the drawn circle. Spread and smooth the meringue, building a 9-inch round that is slightly higher along the edges. The finished round should measure about 1.5-inch/3.8-cm high.",
      "Place the meringue in the center rack in the oven. Bake until the meringue is light in color, dry, and releases easily from the parchment when lifted with a large offset spatula, 1-1.5 hours.",
      "Turn off the oven, and prop the door open. Let the meringue cool, undisturbed, for another 1.5 hours, then remove the meringue from the oven and let cool completely on the baking pan.",
      "While the meringue is cooling, make the topping: In a small bowl add 1 1/2 cups raspberries, 1 1/2 tsp sugar, and 1/2 tsp lemon juice. Toss to combine. Set aside for 15 minutes to macerate.",
      "For the raspberry whipped cream: In a large mixing bowl, add 2 cups heavy whipping cream, 2 Tbs confectioners sugar, 1 tsp vanilla extract, and 2 Tbs kirschwasser. Fit the hand mixer with the whisk attachment. Place the whisk into the cream and turn to speed 3. Mix until the whisk starts to leave a trail, about 1 minute, then increase to speed 7 and whip until the whipped cream forms medium peaks, another 30-45 seconds. Reduce to speed 3 and gradually add the raspberries. Mix until the raspberries have broken up, then increase to speed 8 and whip for an additional 30 seconds. Place the bowl in the fridge until ready for assembly.",
      "Assemble the Pavlova: Using a large offset spatula (or maybe two, one on each side), carefully remove the meringue from the parchment, and slide the meringue on a serving platter. Mound the raspberry whipped cream onto the meringue, creating an even layer. Then, using a slotted spoon, evenly spoon the raspberry mixture over the whipped cream. Garnish with 1/4 cup chopped pistachios. Let the meringue sit for 10 minutes before slicing and serving.",
      "Chef's Tips: Because the weights of eggs can vary, it is best to measure the egg whites by weight or volume (6 oz or 204 g) to ensure the right ratio of egg white and sugar for the meringue.",
      "Meringue can be tricky to make, so here are a few things to consider when making your meringue: Make sure your egg whites are at room temperature, and that no yolk is present in the bowl. Rain and humidity have a negative impact on your meringue. Add an additional 1/2 teaspoon of cornstarch on rainy, humid days. Make sure you don't overbeat the meringue, or it will collapse when baking.",
      "Weather tip: In humid weather a meringue can turn soft and sticky fairly quick and in really humid conditions you may even find it difficult to bake properly.",
      "Storage: It's best to store meringues, without toppings, in an airtight container at room temp. (Don't store in the refrigerator since that is a very moist environment.) Also make sure the meringue is completely cooled before storage, otherwise moisture will be trapped in the container and soften the meringue. Meringue should be used within 24 hours.",
      "Mix It Up!: For Individual pavlovas, follow these instructions: Line two rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper. Trace six 3-in/7.62-cm circles (3 circles per baking sheet). Once ready to shape the meringue, using two large spoons, scoop a mound into the center of one circle. Use the back of the other spoon to create an indentation in the center. Repeat with the other 5 circles. Bake time will be closer to 35-55 minutes. Divide the raspberry cream and topping evenly between the individual meringues."

      "First we will put our milk and our water into a microwave safe container, and microwave it until the temperature reaches around 105 to 115 degrees F. We are doing this because the yeast needs warm liquid to activate it.",
      "Next we will add our warm liquid to a large bowl and add about 1 tsp of our sugar to the liquid. This will provide a bit of food for the yeast. Then add your yeast and use a fork or whisk to mix it a bit. Then set the yeast mixture aside for 5 to 10 minutes and let it do its thing. (This is called Proofing the Yeast).",
      "While the yeast is proofing, we will mix our salt with our flour.",
      "Next we need to melt our butter. I just melted mine in the microwave for about 20 seconds.",
      "Notice the first picture, how much the yeast has grown. This is what we want to see, this is how we know the yeast is alive and thriving. Now add the melted butter and rest of your sugar and mix together with a whisk or fork.",
      "Now add the egg and mix together completely.",
      "Now we add our flour little by little, I continue to use my whisk for the first cup of flour or so, then I switch to a wooden spoon. You can certainly use a stand mixer to make your dough, but if you don't have a mixer, you can do it all by hand like me. Continue to add the flour, about 80% or so of it, until you get a nice tacky dough, then add a bit more of the flour and kneed it a little bit in the bowl until it gets the access flour of the sides, etc. Then take the down out and put it on the counter with your remaining flour.",
      "Next we need to knead the dough. \"Kneading the dough makes bread and rolls light, airy, and chewy. It's a crucial step in making yeast breads. Without well-developed gluten, your bread or rolls would be flat and tough.\" To knead the dough, take the dough and fold the top over and press in with the palm of your hand, then give it a half turn and complete the process. Knead the dough for about 8 minutes. Then place the dough in a greased bowl and cover with a towel or plastic wrap so it can rise for 1 hr or until the dough has doubled. ***Sometimes I dampen my towel, or add a bit of oil on the top, to prevent the dough from drying out while it rises.",
      "Once the dough has risen and is about double in size, we will roll out the dough in a rectangle shape. You can roll it out as thick or thin as you want.",
      "Now we will mix out filling. Add the brown sugar, cinnamon, and vanilla extract to a bowl and mix together with a spoon.",
      "Next we will take our softened butter (about 2 tablespoons) and brush the top of the dough with the butter. Make sure to get the edges. Then we add the sugar mixture to the top, you can use the back of your spoon to smooth it out.",
      "Now we just roll up the dough. I like to roll it up fairly tight.",
      "This next step is for convenience. I like to take a knife and add marks to the top, so I know where to cut the dough to make about 12 even pieces.",
      "Now this is a neat little trick to cutting your dough, of course you can just use a knife, but I really like this method. You take about a Yard/Meter of dental floss, put it under the dough where your mark is, and then cross it like you were going to tie a knot and then pull each side. It will cut right through the dough, super easy.",
      "Now once we have all of the dough cut and put in a 9 by 13 inch baking pan, we cover it with plastic wrap and let rise for another 45 minutes to an hour, or until doubled.",
      "Now we brush on butter to the tops of the cinnamon rolls, to add flavor and help them brown. Then bake in a preheated at 375 degrees F, for about 15 to 20 minutes, until they are nice and golden brown on top.",
      "Now we need to make our glaze. We will add our powdered sugar, melted butter, and vanilla extract, plus about 2 Tablespoons of milk, you can add another Tablespoon of milk if you want your glaze more runny. I like my glaze a little on the thicker side.",
      "Now just add the glaze to the top of the cinnamon rolls!",
      "These cinnamon rolls are super cheap to make. This batch cost me right around $3.11, or about $0.30 per roll. They generally cost over a $1.50 or more per roll to buy at a bakery, or somewhere. Costs will definitely vary depending on how much your ingredients cost where you live, and what deals you can find. It takes a bit of time, but the majority of that time is just letting the dough rise, so you can definitely do other stuff while that is happening. It takes about 30 minutes of prep time, 2 hrs of rise time, and about 15 to 20 minutes of baking time.",

      "Fry the sage leaves: Heat a 6-to-8-inch nonstick skillet over high heat and add the oil. Have a tray lined with paper towels and a slotted spoon ready. When the oil begins to look thinner and spreads to the sides of the pan, turn off the heat and add the sage leaves. Stir them to coat with the oil and cook, stirring, until the sage pales slightly in color and gets slightly crisp, 45 seconds to 1 1/2 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the leaves to the paper towels. Season them immediately with salt and allow them to cool. Reserve the skillet.",
      "Blend the eggs: In a medium bowl, whisk together the eggs, 1 teaspoon water and 1/4 teaspoon salt. Whisk only enough to integrate the eggs; you don't want to whip too much air into them or make them frothy.",
      "Cook the omelet: Return the skillet to medium heat, remove the excess oil and add the butter, swirling it as it melts so it coats the pan. When the butter is melted (but not browned), reduce the heat to medium low and pour in the egg mixture. Use a fork to stir the eggs slightly, as if you were scrambling them. Then allow the eggs to cook, undisturbed, until they start setting in the middle. Sprinkle the cheese and sage leaves over them. Cook until the eggs look almost fully cooked and only slightly loose, 1 to 2 minutes.",
      "Serve the omelet: Lift the handle of the pan, tilting the pan away from you and toward the heat. This tilting should cause the omelet to slide down in the pan a little. Using a heatproof spatula, fold the edge closest to you toward the center. Fold the other edge in toward the center and invert the pan over the center of a plate so the omelet lands seam-side down. Season with pepper."
