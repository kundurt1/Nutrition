      "Save the foil.",
      "Roast the turkey uncovered for 30 minutes to an hour, to brown the skin and cook the meat to a safe internal temperature.",
      "(Because every oven thermostat is different and turkeys will vary in size, cooking times will vary.)",

      "Set the sieve on the saucepan, and pour everything out of the roaster into the sieve, scraping up all the juices, vegetables, the liver, and flavorful caramelized bits.",
      "Press the vegetables and other solids against the sieve with a big spoon to release their liquid, then discard whats left in the sieve.",
      "You should have 1 to 2 quarts of pan juices (depending on how much stock you started with and the roasting time).",
      "Set the saucepan over high heat, bring the juices to a boil, and let them reduce, uncovered.",
      "To make a glaze for turkey, if you like, mix 1/4 cup of balsamic-vinegar reduction and 2 tablespoons of the pan sauce until spreadable; heat and thin it as needed.",

      "To finish the sauce: Pour into the boiling sauce any turkey juices that accumulated on the baking sheet.",

      "Strain it once again, this time through a fine-meshed sieve into a measuring cup or other narrow container.",
      "Let it rest for a minute, then spoon off the fat layer thats accumulated on top.",
      "Thicken the sauce with bread crumbs if its too liquid.",
      "To serve: for formal occasions, you can present the whole turkey and carve it at the table.",
      "For most family dinners, I cut the bird up in the kitchen as follows.",

      "Bring the platter to the table, and let people serve themselves.",
      "Put the rest of the sauce in a bowl and pass it.",
      "To make the dough, whisk the eggs in a large mixing bowl, add the salt, and then whisk in the bread crumbs.",
      "Stirring with a wooden spoon, incorporate all the remaining ingredients except broth; when the dough gets too stiff to stir, work it with your hands.",
      "Its ready when it holds together, although it will still be slightly sticky.",
      "Shape the dough into a cylindrical loaf about 8 inches long and 4 inches thick.",
      "Cut a 40-inch length of cheesecloth and fold it lengthwise so its 18 inches wide.",
      "Set the loaf at one narrow end of the band, centered, with a margin of cloth on either side.",
      "Roll up the loaf in the cheesecloth, so it is wrapped in many layers.",
      "Twist the open sides of the cloth in opposite directions, tightening them against the loaf like a piece of candy in a twisted wrapper.",
      "Tie the twists on both sides with long pieces of kitchen twine so they cant unravel.",
      "Leave at least a foot or so of twine dangling from each knot.",
      "Now lower the gnoccho grande into a stockpot of boiling turkey brothyou should have enough to cover the gnoccho by 1 inch.",
      "It can be cooked in a pot of salted water like pasta, but it will be a bit less flavorful, although still good.",
      "Tie the free ends of twine to the pot handles or to a big spoon lying on the pot rim, so the gnoccho is suspended in the broth and cant fall to the bottom.",
      "Bring the broth back to a gentle boil, and poach the loaf for 40 minutes or so, then lift it out of the broth and into a bowl (the broth may, of course, be used again).",
      "Untie the twine, and roll the loaf out of the cheesecloth.",
      "Slice into the center to check that the dough is cooked all the way throughuncooked dough will be wet and mushy.",
      "If necessary, rewrap the gnoccho and cook it a bit longer.",
      "You can slice and serve cooked gnoccho grande right away, or let it cool, wrap and refrigerate it, and reheat the slices in a pan of broth.",
      "As an accompaniment to roast turkey or other main courses, slice in 1/2-inch-thick rounds, then in half-rounds or wedges, and serve on a warm platter.",
      "Gnoccho grande also makes a lovely soup garnish: cut the rounds into small cubes and heat them in broth.",
      "The reduced sauce from the roasting pan juices will be fully flavored but sometimes thinner than a typical turkey gravy.",
      "Heres how I thicken the juices and give them more texture (without using flour or starch).",
      "Put the strained and reduced sauce in a pan or skillet, set over medium heat, and whisk in fine dry bread crumbsabout 1 teaspoon for each cup of sauce.",
      "Keep whisking as the sauce starts to bubble; let it cook and thicken for a minute.",
      "Youll have a delicious and natural-tasting gravy in no time.",
      "Strain and serve.",
      "When is the turkey roasted enough?",
      "After 2 1/2 hours total of roasting, insert an instant-read meat thermometer into the thickest part of the thigh (the part that cooks most slowly).",
      "A reading of 165 to 170 will indicate that the thighs are almost done, and you can remove the bird from the oven, make the sauce, and complete the glazing.",
      "If the temperature is lower (likely with a bigger turkey), continue roasting and check again in 15 minutes.",
      "If you dont have a thermometer, check the juices that flow from the thigh when you pierce it near the joint.",
      "Any sign of pink in the juices indicates that more roasting is needed.",
      "When you read this recipeor the ones for roast pork, lamb shoulder, or stuffed veal breast later in this chapteryoull see that my way of roasting involves more than sticking a piece of meat in a hot oven.",
      "In all these recipes, the ingredients list calls for lots of cut-up vegetables, seasonings, and a quart or more of broth.",
      "All the vegetables and liquid go into the roasting pan, underneath the meat, and I seal everything in a tent of aluminum foil for the first hour or two in the oven.",
      "This wet cooking serves to break down and soften the fibers in the meat and vegetables.",
      "As the fibers loosen, they release their flavors.",
      "And as the liquid boils and steams within the closed environment, it permeates the meat with all the flavors it has picked up.",
      "The second stage, dry cooking, begins when the tent is removed and the meat is exposed to the direct dry heat of the oven This uncovered cooking produces the crispy and caramelized exterior that is essential in a roast.",
      "When you simply roast meat, as most recipes suggest, you get the caramelization but not the tenderizing of the meat fibers and the development and exchange of flavor.",
      "And, often, I find that dry heat alone toughens the fibers; lean meat, like the breast of poultry, will quickly dry out.",
      "I roast chicken exactly as I do turkey, with a few small differences: the oven temperature is higher; the vegetables, which are cut smaller, cook with the pan juices on the stove top so they soften up.",
      "For a 3 1/2-to-4-pound chicken: Heat the oven to 425.",
      "Season the chicken with 1 teaspoon salt and 2 teaspoons oil.",
      "Use a third to a half of the vegetables and seasonings given for turkey; chop them all into 1/4-inch pieces.",
      "Add a pint of broth to the pan, and enough water to fill the pan to about 1/3 inch deep.",
      "Seal the chicken in a foil tent over the pan, and roast it covered for 1 hour.",
      "Remove the foil, and scrape all the vegetables and liquid into a saucepan togetherdont strain the vegetables as you do with turkeyand cook over high heat.",
      "To finish the chicken, return it to the oven and roast 20 to 30 minutes uncovered, checking it occasionally and basting with the juices in the saucepan, until the skin is crisp and golden.",
      "To finish the sauce, reduce the pan juices by half, strain out the soft vegetables, and puree them through a sieve into the sauce."
