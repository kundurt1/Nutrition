      "Place ingredients in blender or food processor container in the order listed.",
      "Cover and blend on high 20 to 30 seconds. Scrape sides of container. Blend a few more seconds.",
      "PAN PREPARATION: If using a non-stick spray shortening, spray pan before heating. Before cooking the first crepe put 1/2 teaspoons butter into pan. If the pan is well seasoned it should not be necessary to add more butter for each crepe.",
      "PAN TEMPERATURE: Crepe pan is at the correct temperature when the batter sizzles slightly when poured into the pan, and a crepe will cook on one side in approximately 1 minute. (On my stovetop I set to medium-low). Crepes should be pale in color, not dark brown.",
      "TO COOK CREPES: Two or three tablespoons of batter is usually enough to cover the bottom of a 6 to 7 inch crepe pan. ( I use a 10 inch pan with scant 1/4 cup batter). If necessary adjust the amount needed for the pan you are using.",
      "Pour in the batter and quickly tilt the pan so the batter covers the bottom entirely. If you put in more than just a thin coating, pour the excess back into the bowl. This will leave a small flap on the crepe but it won't be noticed when the crepe is filled and folded. (Caution: If crepe pan is not hot enough, the whole crepe may fall back into the batter when you pour out the excess. It is important to have the pan at the correct temperature before starting to cook.).",
      "WHEN TO TURN: The crepe is ready to turn when it begins to set and crisp around the edges. Loosen around the edge with a long thin spatula or knife so you have a starting place to pick up the crepe with your fingers (or the spatula) then simply flip it over. Should it start to tear when picked up, it may not be cooked enough to turn. Cook a few seconds longer and try again.",
      "Crepe is ready when the second side is set (not wet).",
      "IF PAN STICKS IN ONE SPOT: Put more butter or oil in the pan and wipe with a paper towel. Once a crepe pan is seasoned, it should not be necessary to add more butter or oil for each crepe. It may be necessary to discard the first crepe or two until the pan is properly seasoned and the temperature is right.",
      "AFTER THE CREPES ARE COOKED: Stack cooked crepes on a plate. They will be easier to separate if they are not placed squarely on top of each other. It is not necessary to put foil or waxed paper between each crepe.",
      "PRESENTATION: Crepes can be filled and rolled or folded into quarters."

      "Preheat oven to 325 degrees with the rack in the middle position. Set 8 6-ounce ramekins in a large casserole pan (you can use smaller or larger dishes; the cooking time will vary only slightly).",
      "Divide the custard mixture into ramekins (about 3/4 cup in each). Fill the casserole pan with very hot tap water 1/2 of the way up the ramekins and carefully transfer to the oven. Bake just until set, about 25-30 minutes (time will vary depending on your oven), turning the pan once if the custards seem to be setting unevenly. The custards shouldn't bubble during cooking. If they do, remove immediately.",
      "When done, the custards should be set on the edges and jiggle very slightly in the middle when shaken. You don't want them to be too firm. Remove from oven and allow to cool in water 10 minutes before carefully removing from casserole dish.",
      "If serving right away, keep custards at room temperature. If not cooking right away, refrigerate uncovered at least 2 hours, then cover. If chilled, remove from refrigerator and allow the custards to come up to room temperature, about 45 minutes.",
      "Using a blowtorch: When ready to serve, sprinkle turbinado sugar, about 1-2 teaspoons each, and place dishes on a nonflammable surface. If you do not have turbinado sugar you can use granulated but just use a very thin layer or it may brown too much in some spots.",
      "Following manufacturer's directions, light blowtorch and bring to medium heat. Using a circular motion and being sure to get the edges, caramelize the sugar directly and completely with flame. The crust should turn a deep golden brown color. Garnish with fresh fruit and/or cookies if desired.",
      "Using the broiler: Refrigerate the custards up to a day. Dry the brown sugar (you can do a large batch and save it) on a cookie sheet in a 200-degree oven for 20 or 30 minutes. Let cool and run through a sieve or sifter. It will hold indefinitely.",
      "Preheat boiler. Sprinkle a thin layer of brown sugar, about 2 teaspoons, on each chilled custard, using a finger to gently spread it evenly across the top. Position a rack 3 or 4 inches from broiler. Place sugared brulees one or two at a time under heat, carefully moving dishes slightly to caramelize sugar evenly (a broiler's heat is rarely even).",
      "This takes a little practice and a lot of concentration, so you might want to do one or two as an experiment before you try it with company. When evenly caramelized, set aside and continue with the rest. Garnish with fresh fruit and/or cookies if desired."

Reserve in the refrigerator.",

      "To Build the Dish: Remove the beets, asparagus, vinaigrette & cheese from the refrigerator 1/2 an hour before serving. Add about 2 - 3 ounces of the Dijon vinaigrette to the asparagus and toss well. Season to taste with salt & pepper. In a round mold or free style, divide the asparagus onto the center of 6 plates. Add a layer of the dressed asparagus on top of the beets. (If you are using a mold, you will need to layer the beets and then the asparagus onto one plate before removing the mold and repeating onto the second plate and so forth.) Toss the field greens in some of the blood orange oil and place some of them onto the asparagus. Place 1 piece of Maytag blue cheese on top of the greens. Sprinkle each plate with the almonds. Garnish each plate with drizzles of Dijon vinaigrette, blood orange oil and chopped chives."

Add salt, Milk and Butter mixture and add 1 cup flour. Mix slowly until flour is absorbed and then beat on medium until your dough comes together 4 minutes at least -- if it is slightly stick that is fine, if its very sticky add Flour 1Tbsp at a time. You do not want a hard dough. Remove the dough hook and transfer to a large bowl cover with Plastic wrap and towel. Let rise for 1 hour or until doubled in volume in a warm non drafty area.",

You want to get a crisp on the bottom and top but you also want to cook the dough thru and thru. Add Clarified Butter to make a little layer on the bottom of the pan add your proofed Muffins being careful not to over crowd your pan or to deflate your precious little muffins, I used a very sharp metal spatula. Cook for 7 minutes on the first side and flip, cook for 6 more minutes. I am going to suggest you do what I did since this was my first time making them, I took one muffin and cooked it 7 on one side - if you are smelling something burning your pan is too hot. Flip and try 6 minutes on the second side - if you see its not getting browned adjust your heat according likewise if its smelling burnt lower it. Set this test Muffin to the side, remove your pan from the stove and allow muffin to cool. With a fork separate the muffin in half -- you don't want a doughy center. Adjust all times and temps accordingly. Bring your pan back to temp and repeat for all muffins. I will also suggest you do what I did and just take a paper towel and clean the Cast Iron after each set of your English Muffins. Re add your Clarified Butter and repeat till done. Transfer your cooked Muffins to a cooling rack. I couldn't wait for that first muffin -- but please don't use a knife to cut your muffin or squish it -- use the fork technique and open it gently.",

      "GINGERBREAD CASTLE:",
      "**For my gingerbread structures, I like to build their general shape out of cardboard first. This is a great way to address any structural issues before it's too late. They also give you an amazing stencil to use to cut out your cookie shapes and then later they're great for preventing any mess when you're pouring candy glass windows into your finished cookies.",
      "In a stand mixer beat butter and sugar until creamy, add molasses and eggs. In another bowl, mix all dry ingredients. Once done slowly mix into wet ingredients and stir until dough ball forms. Wrap softball sized portions in foil and chill until ready to use.",
      "Heat oven to 360 degrees fahrenheit.",
      "Line cookie sheets with parchment and roll dough directly onto cookie sheets. Using flour to prevent sticking. Cut out shapes using homemade stencils and save scraps for the next sheet.",
      "Baking time varies depending on how large your cookie is. Large cookies can take 18 minutes and small decorative pieces can be done in as little as 5 minutes. So keep an eye on them. Once baked, remove from oven (and here's my secret to getting a smooth cookie -- immediately after removing a batch from the oven, place a sheet of parchment over the top and using a slightly smaller baking sheet press, slide and swivel the smaller sheet on top until perfect. Allow cookies to cool before removing and place on paper towels. Do any candy glass windows BEFORE assembling.",
      "Advice and pointers: Assembling is my personal favorite part, but be sure to have a lot of patience and go slowly. Don't let go of any pieces unless you're positive they're secure and if you're unsure, use various kitchen items as supports -- things get pretty jenky in my kitchen during this process. Know that cookies will break here and there, make extra of critical pieces if you have the time and keep in mind you're doing something fun and when things go wrong, it's just a lesson for the future -- at least that's what I tell myself when I'm facing a kitchen catastrophe :D.",
      "CANDY GLASS:",
      "Mix sugar, water, corn syrup and tartar in a large pot on medium/high heat. Stir constantly until mixture begins to boil. Stop stirring and place candy thermometer on the edge of the pot with the temp gauge submerged into sugar syrup. This part takes FOREVER (20 or so minutes) so set up a chair next to the stove and grab a magazine/book/laptop and keep an eye on the thermometer. Allow to heat to 300 degrees and immediately remove from heat. Stir and mix in two drops blue food coloring. Have cookies clean and resting face up on a very flat surface covered in a aluminum foil. Use your cardboard stencil over your cookie and pour candy glass into your cutouts using a bent tea spoon or small ladle. Once poured, immediately lift stencil off and clear any sugar strands that occur.",
      "Advice and pointers: This is one of those things you should set a lot of time aside for and prepare yourself with a lot of patience. Having a plate warmer to set the pot of hot sugar on near your workstation is a great way to give yourself a bit more time to work with each batch. Depending on how many windows you have to do, you'll be needing to make several batches. As soon as one batch begins to harden, you need to cut your losses and discard it (I've learned this the hard way). This stuff is also INSANELY hot so be very careful and make sure no pets, children or other obstacles are around when working with candy glass!",
      "ROYAL ICING for GINGERBREAD CASTLE:",
      "( I made this batch probably 6 times throughout the project).",
      "In a stand mixer beat egg whites till frothy and incorporate sugar until smooth. Then mix in the rest of the ingredients little bits at a time until the color you desire is achieved.",
      "Advice and pointers: Because you're using raw egg whites and salmonella is a risk, always use fresh eggs from a reliable source and don't allow unused frosting to sit out for more than an hour or so. Any unused frosting can be covered with a damp towel to prevent drying and retain freshness. Keep in mind the longer you work with a single batch the darker the color will become, so when initially mixing, keep that in mind.",
      "ROYAL ICING FOR HOLLY, WREATHS AND CHRISTMAS TREES:",
      "Using any used gingerbread dough, cut out and shape christmas trees and bake. Using a small star tip (I actually bent mine with a small hammer to get the perfect shape) pipe royal icing all over giver bread and decorate with sugar beads which you'll then need to tediously paint."

I stick the skewer into the center of the meat, wait 5 seconds, then touch the skewer to my cheek. If the metal is warm, the meat is done.
