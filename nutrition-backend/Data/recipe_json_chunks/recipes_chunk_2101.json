      "If it is, drizzle a little oil around the sides of the pan to help loosen it.",
      "Now run the spatula around the edges and under the entire crust to be sure it isnt sticking and has completely released from the pan.",
      "Take the crust out of the pan and let rest on a cooling rack for at least 30 minutes or up to 2 hours.",
      "When ready to finish the pizza, if you have turned off the oven, preheat it to 450 degrees F for 1 hour.",
      "Return the parbaked crust to the pan before topping and baking.",

      "Arrange the soppressata over the cheese, placing 4 slices lengthwise and 3 slices across, so that once the pizza is cut, each piece will have a slice.",
      "Place the pan on the top stone and bake for 7 minutes.",
      "Rotate the pan 180 degrees, transfer it to the bottom stone, and bake for 6 minutes, until the top of the crust is a rich golden brown.",
      "Using a wide metal spatula, lift a corner of the pizza and peek at the bottom.",
      "If you want it darker and crunchier, transfer the pan to the top stone to bake for 1 to 2 minutes.",
      "Keep a watchful eye so the cheese does not overcook.",
      "Run the spatula around the edges of the pizza to make sure it has not stuck in any area.",

      "Lift the pizza on the spatula and transfer it to a cutting board.",

      "In an electric oven, toss 1/2 cup water into the bottom, just before closing the door.",
      "In a gas oven, set a hot cast-iron frying pan on the lowest level as you preheat, and toss the water into that when the time comes.",
      "If you prefer to make the dough entirely by hand, mix the ingredients in a bowl with a sturdy wooden spoon, then turn dough out onto a lightly floured work surface.",
      "For the first few minutes, pick it up with a scraper and slap it down roughly, and continue a number of times, until the dough begins to have body.",
