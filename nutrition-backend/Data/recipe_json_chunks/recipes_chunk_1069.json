Do not adjust the out vent, it should always remain full open. You know your cooking properly when there is very little smoke coming out of the smoker, and the hot air coming out of the top vent is clear for the first foot, then it turns to a grayish white smoke. If smoke is billowing out of every opening, the smoke is cold and the air flow is too low--your brisket will taste like tar. You can let the temperature creep up to 225\u00b0F , but not much over that.",

Pour off drippings from pot; discard. Add wine to pot and bring to simmer, scraping up any browned bits. Return ribs and any accumulated juices to pot; bring to boil.

You want to have enough of the cheesecloth hanging over the edge of the collander to grab and tie for aging the soy cheese. Put the collander in the sink and pour/scrape all the soy milk curds into the collander.",

      "Take the cheesecloth out of collander and bring all the edges together, with the lump of soy ricotta in the middle. Tie the cheesecloth with a string and hang the cheese so that it continues to drain. Don't squeeze it -- let gravity and a little time do the work for you.",
      "When it stops dripping, open the cheese cloth and transfer the ricotta to a covered container. Refrigerate and use as you would use ricotta cheese.",
      "NOTE: When I made this, I used the vanilla flavored soy milk. I think it gave the ricotta product more of that sweet cream taste, and I think I'd rather have that than the straight soy flavor.",
      "NOTE: If you wanted to flavor this, with garlic powder or herbs, do it when the milk is in the saucepan. You can add sun dried tomatos and such after the cheese has been strained, but it gives a different texture and presentation with chunky sized add ons later."
