(Do not move the meat around once you put them in a pan as you want to have a good crust on them) Remove the meat and cover with foil, set aside to rest for at least 10 minuets. Add the reserved marinade liquid and red wine to the pan, scrape all the meat dripping off the bottom with wooden spoon, and let the sauce reduce until thick over low-medium heat, about 10 minutes. Coat the steak with the glaze and serve."

Bring the mixture to a boil, reduce the heat, and simmer until the meat is tender, about 1 hour and 45 minutes.",

      "Place the ground meat in a large bowl. Using a wooden spoon or rubber spatula, mix in the cooked rice, parsley, scallions, and the reserved cooking liquid. Stir vigorously for 5 minutes. When the boudin-rice mixture is first combined, it looks very wet and it's pretty spicy. Don't worry; after poaching, the rice absorbs the excess moisture and much of the spice. The wet texture and extra spice ensure that your final boudin will be moist and full of flavor.",
      "At this point you can feed the sausage into the casings. Poach the links gently in hot (not bubbling) water for about 10 minutes, then serve. Alternatively, you can use the mixture as a stuffing for chicken, or roll it into \"boudin balls,\" dredge in bread crumbs, and fry in hot oil until golden brown."

Tie butcher string around the fish in three or four places to hold the stuffing in. In between the string, make deep incisions with your knife through the thickest part of the fish on both sides, all the way down to the spine. (The fish will cook more quickly, and the smoke flavor will get inside the fish better.) Brush both the fish and the grill lightly with oil, dust the salmon skin on both sides lightly with flour, and place the salmon on the grill.",

      "Grill over medium-hot direct heat, with the cover on and the vents open. When the skin is browned on 1 side, use 2 large metal spatulas to loosen the salmon from the grate and carefully turn over. Continue cooking until just cooked through and an instant read thermometer inserted in the thickest part of the fish registers 135 degrees F to 140 degrees F, about 35 to 40 minutes total cooking time. Remove the fish from the grill and place it on a large platter. Allow the fish to cool for 5 minutes, then remove the butcher string and serve.",

      "*Barbecuing a whole salmon on the grill is a classic Seattle tradition, especially for holidays or special occasions. Tom believes everyone should try cooking a whole fish once in a while- it's not really difficult and it's infinitely more satisfying than always serving boned fillets. Tom strongly recommends using a wild salmon for this recipe, rather than a farmed salmon, because a fish with a nice firm texture is best."

You could use any veggie product, canned cutlets etc. But TVP is good. Add cumin and tumeric. I let that simmer for a while adding water when it was necessary. Maybe it cooked about 35-35 minutes. I let it cool and put it in the refrigerator. I like casseroles and soups to blend overnight. You can season this to taste.

Try to use a straight up-and-down motion, as the more you press on the flour the more tough gluten will develop. Avoid using your fingers, as the heat from your hands will melt the fat and further encourage gluten development. Unlike with pasta or bread, gluten is the enemy of pie dough, so be gentle, and be quick!",

Gently drizzle about half of your milk mixture over the flour, trying to cover as wide an area as you can.

It's not an exact science, as everything from the humidity in the air to the dryness of your flour will affect the consistency of your dough.",

      "In a separate bowl, combine the quince paste and lemon juice to form a smooth paste. (If your quince paste is very firm, warm it gently over low heat to soften [or heat for 10 seconds in a microwave], until the texture is thick like jam but spreadable, then set aside to cool before using).",
      "Take one of the pieces of dough from the fridge and roll out on a lightly floured work surface to form a 9 1/2-inch/24-cm circle, about 1/8 inch/3 mm thick. Use a small spatula or the back of a spoon to spread half of the quince paste evenly over the surface and then sprinkle with half of the sugar-nut mixture. Using a sharp knife or a pizza wheel, if you have one, cut the dough as though you are slicing a cake into twelve equal triangles. The best way to get even-sized triangles is to cut it first into quarters, then each quarter into thirds. One at a time, roll each wedge quite tightly, starting from the wide outside edge and working toward the point of the triangle, so that the filling is enclosed. Place them on the lined baking sheets, seam side down, spaced about 1 inch/3 cm apart. Repeat the rolling process with the remaining disk of dough and filling, then chill the rugelachs in the fridge for 30 minutes before baking.",

      "When ready to bake, lightly brush the tops of the rugelachs with the beaten egg and sprinkle with the demerara sugar. Bake for 20-25 minutes, rotating the sheets halfway through, until golden brown all over. Don't worry if some of the filling oozes out; this will add a lovely toffee taste to the edges of the cookies. Remove from the oven and allow to rest on the sheets for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.",
      "The pastry can be made a day ahead and kept in the fridge, or frozen for up to 3 months (remember to thaw it overnight in the fridge before using). The rolled rugelach can also be frozen (before glazing) for up to 3 months. When you are ready to bake them, brush with the glaze and bake from frozen, adding an extra minute or two to the cooking time.",
      "These will keep for up to 4 days in an open container, separated by pieces of parchment paper, and the whole thing wrapped loosely in aluminum foil. Don't keep in an airtight container; the sugar will weep if you do and turn the rugelach soft and sticky."

Measure the noodles to fit comfortable in your baking dish or choice. When making pasta, hang the finished pieces on a pasta rack. Boil in salted water for 3-5 minutes, or until pieces float to the top and have stayed there for 30 seconds or so. At this point, I drain the pasta then let soak in luke warm water until I separate them to layer.",

Refrigerate overnight before unmolding and leaving it to get back to room temperature. If you need to unmold it long before you want to eat it (I often do just because I like to get all bothersome stuff out of the way before people arrive) then just sit it on its serving plate in the fridge until about 20-30 minutes before you want to eat it.

Do the egg test by pouring the sorbet base into a tall narrow bowl at least 8 inches deep and gently add a well-washed raw egg in the shell. The egg should float to the top and, ideally, show a circle about the size of a nickel above the surface. Too much egg showing means the sugar content is too high, and you should add a little more fruit juice or water. Too little egg showing means not enough sugar, so you'll need to add more. Cover and refrigerate for about 3 hours, or until thoroughly chilled, stirring occasionally to dissolve all of the sugar. Strain the lemon juice mixture through a fine-mesh strainer into a bowl. Freeze in an ice cream maker according to the manufacturers instructions. Pack into a freezer container and freeze for at least one hour before serving. Best served the day it is made."

Stop, scrape down the sides of the bowl, and add the flours, baking soda, salt, and mix until just combined, about 1 minute. Transfer dough to an airtight container and refrigerate for at least 3 hours, up to 5 days. Notes regarding the flour - solely using all-purpose flour will work, the cookies will not be as chewy or rise as well because bread flour creates chewier results and gives greater rise. Also, I live in a dry climate and only need 1 3/4 cups flour total but if you are in more humidity or your dough is very moist or loose, adding up to 1/4 cup of additional flour, for 2 cups total, is possible. The more flour, the more the cookies will stay domed and puffed while baking.",

Bake for 8 to 10 minutes, or until pale golden and edges have just set, even if slightly undercooked in the center, as cookies will firm up as they cool (The cookies shown in the photos were baked for 9 minutes and have chewy edges with soft pillowy centers. For crunchier cookies, extend baking time by 1 to 3 minutes). Allow cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 10 minutes before removing.
