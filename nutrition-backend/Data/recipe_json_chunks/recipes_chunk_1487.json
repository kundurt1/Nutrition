Stir beans twice during the baking process to submerge the top ones, leveling them out each time; over time, a dark, browned crust will form on the surface of the beans (this is good). The goal throughout is to keep the liquid level just high enough that the upper beans don't desiccate, but not so high that the surface doesn't brown. Stop adding liquid during the last hour of baking unless the level becomes perilously low.",

Using bean masher, potato masher, or back of a wooden spoon, smash the beans to form a chunky puree; alternatively, use a stick blender to make a smoother puree. Reduce heat to medium and cook, stirring, until desired consistency is reached; if refried beans are too dry, add more bean-cooking liquid, 1 tablespoon at a time, as needed.

      "In a medium saucepan, bring 1 liter of water to boil over high heat to make starter wort, or unfermented beer. Remove from heat and stir in 2 cups dry malt extract until completely dissolved. Bring back to a boil for 10 minutes, then cool to 120\u00b0F by covering pan with lid and running cool tap water over it. Once cooled, scoop 2 tablespoons Greek yogurt into a sanitized 64-ounce mason jar or glass jug, then pour in cooled wort on top. Cover the top of the vessel loosely with foil, then insulate with a blanket or neoprene sleeve. Hold as close to 110\u00b0 as possible for 60 to 72 hours.",
      "Heat 1.5 gallons water in a stockpot to about 160\u00b0F, then add all grain, stirring to avoid clumps. Cover pan with lid, remove from heat, and hold at temperature for 1 hour by wrapping pot in a thick towel. This is your \"mash tun.\"",
      "Meanwhile, in a separate kettle, heat another 1.5 gallons of water to 170\u00b0. This is your \"hot liquor tank,\" which provides a reservoir of hot water to rinse the grains with in a later state. When hot liquor tank comes to temperature, bring mash tun to 175\u00b0 over medium heat, then turn off heat.",
      "Place a large fine mesh strainer (12\" in diameter has just enough capacity for 5 pounds of grain) over the top of a third 5-gallon brewing kettle. Pour the contents of mash tun through the fine mesh strainer into the kettle. Let stand until grain has fully drained. Ladle all 1.5 gallons of water from your hot liquor tank over the grains in the colander, rinsing off any additional sugars on the surface of the grains. When finished, taste the grains; all sweetness should be gone. If you taste any sugar, heat more water to 170\u00b0 and rinse over the grains until they taste bland.",
      "You should have about 3 gallons of wort in the kettle at this point. Bring to a boil over high heat, then stir in herbs. After 15 minutes, smell steam to ensure no aroma of cooked corn (DiMethyl Sulfide, or DMS). The goal is to sanitize the wort and boil off DMS without losing much yield. If you can detect DMS aroma in the steam, keep boiling until it is no longer apparent.",
      "As you end the boil, switch off heat, and place thermometer in the wort. Pour 2 gallons of refrigerated purified water into the kettle, increasing volume to 5 gallons and dropping the temperature between 120 to 130\u00b0F. Stir vigorously with a large spoon to cool further if temperature is a little on the high side. Once at temperature, pour all liquid and solids from bacterial starter from step 1 directly into kettle. Cover tightly with foil or plastic wrap and insulate with a thick bath towel, holding at temperature for 24 hours to ensure sufficient acid formation. Because fermentation generates heat, the simple insulation is enough to stay above 100\u00b0 overnight, ideal growing temperature for lactic acid-producing bacteria.",
      "24 hours later, sanitize your fermentation carboy by diluting 1 teaspoon of Starsan sanitizer in a gallon of water inside the carboy. Shake up and roll the carboy on its side to ensure the liquid touches all interior surfaces and the opening. Pour out when complete. Pour off 10 ounces of your storebought unpasteurized sour beer (reserve for your well-deserved enjoyment), reserving just over 3 ounces (about the bottom quarter of the bottle) of liquid and yeast and bacteria-rich dregs from the bottom. Using an auto-siphon device, transfer soured wort into carboy, then pour in the remaining liquid and dregs into the carboy. Add an airlock and rubber stopper to the top, then set in a cool location in the high 60s to low 70s to favor yeast activity over further bacterial growth and souring.",
      "Taste periodically, using your pipette reserved for sour beers, starting at about 2 weeks from initial brew day. When beer is both tart and lightly buttery (from diacetyl), add the brettanomyces, dumping the full vial into the carboy.",
      "Taste again with pipette a week or so after brettanomyces addition. If the buttery flavor has dissipated and the beer tastes \"bright,\" use a sanitized hydrometer, testing jar, and pipette to take a sample. If the specific gravity is at or below 1.010, the beer is ready to be transferred to a keg or bottles; if not, continue fermenting until reaching this target. Do not replace beer tested to the carboy.",
      "To carbonate, heat 1 cup of water to boiling, then turn off heat and add 4.5 ounces dextrose (corn sugar) to hot water and stir until dissolved. Pour into carboy through a sanitized funnel and let sit for 10 minutes, then use auto-siphon to transfer liquid into bottles, and adding caps and sealing them as you go. This should yield approximately 48 12-ounce bottles. Alternatively, transfer to sanitized keg and carbonate following keg carbonation instructions. For natural carbonation, the beer should be ready in 2 to 3 weeks."

      "Now sprinkle a little water on the plastic wrapped cutting board. Use a spatula to scrape the fruit paste from the processor and on to the cutting board. If you need to use your hands, moisten them with water before touching the fruit paste to prevent sticking.",
      "Place the fruit paste into center of the plastic wrap and use damp fingers to pat it into a square. Sprinkle it with a few drops of water, then put another sheet of plastic wrap on top.",
      "Use a rolling pin to roll the paste between the the sheets of plastic; aim for a 12 inch square, about 1/8\" thin. Take care to roll evenly, both up-and-down and left-and-right, to maintain a very square-like shape.",
      "Gently peel off the top layer of plastic. Use a dampened ruler (it will stick to the paste if you don't moisten it with water!) to trim the paste into a 12\" square. Peel up the scraps and use them to patch together any gaps and to complete the square shape.",
      "If necessary sprinkle some more water over the paste, reapply the plastic wrap, and roll a little more. This will seal the patchwork together and ensure the paste is uniformly thin.",
      "Use a dampened ruler and a pizza cutter (or knife) to cut out 12, 2 3/4\" x 3 3/4\" pieces. Don't bother trying to lift or move those pieces, just cut them. Refrigerate the paste, uncovered, until needed (the pieces are easier to handle when cold).",

      "Combine all of the icing ingredients in a bowl and mix until a smooth paste forms. Put some of the icing into a piping bag fitted with a small, plain tip. Pipe a boarder of icing around the perimeter of each tart, leaving about a 1/4\" margin.",

Pour a tablespoon of icing onto each tart and use the tip of a metal spatula or spoon to help it reach all of the corners.

Stagger the cookie portions on the lined baking sheets, leaving 2 inches (5 cm) between each. Place two in the first row, one in the second. You will get 5 cookies per sheet.",
      "For a golden cookie that will bend when cool, bake them for 11 minutes exactly. If you prefer a crunchier cookie, bake them for a few minutes more. Repeat until all of your dough has been baked. Let cool on the pan for 10 minutes, then transfer to wire racks to cool completely.",
      "These cookies keep beautifully in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 4 days. The dough freezes exceptionally well, double-wrapped, and can be kept for up to 1 month."

Add the 1 cup + 6 tablespoons Donut & Fritter Blend and stir vigorously with a wooden spoon, scraping the bottom of the pot for about 1 minute. Once the dough pulls easily from the sides of the pan and leaves a thin veil of butterfat on the bottom, it's ready to come off the heat.",
      "Transfer the dough to a food processor fitted with the S-blade. Pulse the dough for 20 seconds to cool it slightly. Pour in the eggs and baking powder (still unwhisked) and process it all to a thick, sticky paste, about 90 seconds more. Add the vanilla and mix just until incorporated. Transfer the dough to a pastry bag fitted with a 1/2-inch (12-mm) star tip. At this point, the dough can be refrigerated: Wrap the pastry tip in plastic and then place a rubber band over the top of the tip so it's snug and keeps the plastic tight. Using a second rubber band, twist the top of the bag shut and fold the excess pastry bag over, pulling the rubber band over the excess flap. This will keep the dough fresh for up to 3 days before frying.",
      "To make the donuts: Scoop the prepared choux paste into a lidded container and refrigerate it for 2 to 3 hours.",
      "Meanwhile, in a medium saucepan, melt the jam over medium heat until it is liquid. Strain the jam through a fine-mesh strainer into a bowl; discard any solids left in the strainer. Set the jam aside to cool completely.",
      "To cook the donuts, in a large skillet (or alternatively, in a deep-fryer), heat the oil over medium heat until it registers 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C) on a deep-fry thermometer. Line a platter with paper towels, or line a baking sheet with a brown paper bag.",
      "Pour the sugar into a shallow dish. Shake the dish slightly to spread the sugar out into an even layer.",
      "Working in batches of three or four donuts at a time, spoon tablespoon-size dollops of dough directly into the hot oil. Be sure not to overcrowd the pan or the oil will get cool. Fry until the donuts are golden brown on both sides, about 1 minute on the first side and a bit less than a minute on the second side. Using a slotted spoon or spider, transfer the fried donuts to the lined plate to drain any excess oil. Repeat with the remaining dough.",
      "When the donuts are cool enough to handle, roll them in the sugar. Transfer the cooled strained jam to a pastry bag fitted with a plain round tip. Pierce a donut with the pastry bag tip and pipe about 1 tablespoon of filling into the donut. Repeat to fill the remaining donuts.",
      "Ideally, eat the donuts right away, before the sugar can absorb any of the residual frying oil. If you have any leftovers, store the donuts in a brown paper bag or in a loosely covered container on the counter for a day or two."

      "Make the Pumpkin Cheesecake Swirl: In a medium bowl, whisk the cream cheese and sugar until smooth and creamy (it should almost look like frosting). Add the pumpkin, egg yolk, flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, and ginger and whisk again until well blended. Cover and refrigerate while you make the brownie layer.",
      "Make the Brownie Layer: Preheat the oven to 350F (175C) and position a rack in the center. Butter the sides and bottom of a glass or light-colored metal 9-by-13-inch (23-by-33-cm) pan. Line the bottom with a sheet of parchment paper with a 1-inch (2.5-cm) overhang on the long sides of the pan, and butter the parchment.",
      "In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, cocoa, and salt.",
      "Place the chocolate and butter in a large heatproof bowl and set it over a saucepan of simmering water, stirring occasionally, until the chocolate and butter are completely melted, smooth, and combined. Turn off the heat, but keep the bowl over the water and add both sugars. Whisk until completely combined, then remove the bowl from the pan. The mixture should be at room temperature. Add 2 eggs to the chocolate mixture and gently whisk until just combined. Add the remaining egg and whisk until combined. Add the vanilla and whisk until combined. Do not overbeat the batter at this stage or your brownies will be cakey.",
      "Sprinkle the flour mixture over the chocolate mixture. Using a spatula, fold them gently together until just a bit of the flour mixture is visible.",
      "Pour two-thirds of the batter into the prepared pan and smooth the top. Pour the pumpkin cheesecake mixture over the brownies and smooth into an even layer with the back of an offset spatula. Drop the remaining one-third of the brownie batter by heaping tablespoons here and there over the pumpkin layer. Use a knife to gently pull through the batters to create a swirl. (The brownie batter is thick, so you might need to pull several times before you start to create the swirl.)",
      "Bake, rotating the pan halfway through the baking time, until a toothpick inserted into the center of the brownies comes out with a few moist crumbs sticking to it, 30 to 40 minutes. Let the brownies cool almost completely.",
      "You can eat the brownies slightly warm or at room temperature, when they have a more pumpkin-y flavor. Or cover and refrigerate them for about 3 hours and enjoy them slightly chilled (this is our favorite). Either way, when you're ready, release the brownies from the side of the pan with a small paring knife. Pull straight up on the parchment to remove them from the pan, place them on a cutting board, cut, and serve."

      "Sift both flours, the baking powder, baking soda, and salt together into a large bowl. Set aside.",
      "In the bowl of a standing mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the butter and shortening on medium speed until creamy, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the sugar and vanilla and beat on medium speed until fluffy, about 3 minutes. Scrape down the bowl, add the egg, and beat until just combined.",
      "In a small bowl, whisk together the ice-cold water, milk, and buttermilk.",
      "Add the flour mixture to the mixer bowl in three separate additions, alternating with the water mixture, beginning and ending with the flour mixture; turn the mixer to low when you add the ingredients, then up to medium for a few seconds to incorporate. Scrape down the bowl, then mix on low speed for a few more seconds. Remove the bowl from the standing mixer, scatter the sprinkles across the top of the batter, and fold them in with a rubber spatula.",
      "In a medium bowl, whisk the egg whites and cream of tartar just until soft peaks form; do not overbeat. Gently fold the egg whites into the batter with a rubber spatula.",
      "Divide the batter among the prepared pans and smooth the tops. Bake for 40 to 45 minutes, rotating the pans halfway through the baking time, until a toothpick inserted in the center of each cake comes out clean. Transfer the cakes to a wire rack and let cool for 20 minutes. Invert the cakes onto the rack, remove from the pans, and let cool completely. Remove the parchment.",
      "Make the frosting: In a medium heavy-bottomed saucepan, whisk the sugar and flour together. Add the milk and cream and cook over medium heat, whisking occasionally, until the mixture comes to a boil and has thickened to the consistency of a light pudding, 10 to 15 minutes.",
      "Transfer the mixture to the bowl of a standing mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Beat on high speed until cool, at least 7 to 9 minutes (you can speed up the process by pressing bags of frozen berries or corn against the sides and bottom of the mixing bowl). Reduce the speed to low and add the butter a few chunks at a time, every 20 to 30 seconds, while the mixer is constantly stirring; mix until thoroughly incorporated. Increase the speed to medium-high and beat until the frosting is light and fluffy, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the vanilla paste and extract and mix until combined. If the frosting is too soft, place the bowl in the refrigerator to chill slightly, then beat again until it can hold its shape. If the frosting is too firm, set the bowl over a pot of simmering water and beat with a wooden spoon until it is spreadable.",
      "Assemble the cake: Place one cooled cake layer on a cake turntable (or a serving platter if you don't own a cake turntable).",
      "Trim the top to create a flat surface, and evenly spread about 11/4 cups (215 g) of the frosting on top. Add the next layer, trim it, and frost it as before, then add the third layer (trim the final layer for a completely flat top, or feel free to leave it domed for an old-school appearance). Spread a very thin layer of frosting over the sides and top of the cake and place it in the refrigerator for about 15 minutes to firm up. (This is known as crumb coating and will help to keep loose cake crumbs under control when you frost the outside of the cake).",
      "Place the turntable on a parchment-lined baking sheet with raised sides. Frost the sides and top with the remaining frosting. Grab a fistful of sprinkles and turn the turntable with your free hand while tossing the sprinkles at the sides of the cake. Using the leftover sprinkles from the parchment (i.e., sprinkles that didn't stick), continue turning and throwing until the cake (including the top) is covered in sprinkles. Chill the cake for about 5 minutes to set before serving.",
      "This cake will keep beautifully in a cake saver at room temperature (cool and humidity-free) for up to 3 days. If your room is not cool, place the cake in a cake saver and refrigerate for up to 3 days, then let it sit at room temperature for at least 2 hours before serving."

      "Pulse together 3/4 cup of flour, 1/3 cup of walnuts, 1 teaspoon of granulated sugar, and salt in the work bowl of a food processor fitted with the steel blade until the walnuts are very finely ground, about 1 minute.",
      "Cut 3 ounces of chilled butter into small pieces and add to the flour mixture. Pulse until the butter is cut into very tiny pieces, about 30 seconds. The texture should be sandy with very tiny lumps throughout.",
      "In a small bowl, combine 1 tablespoon of water, lemon juice, and lemon zest. With the food processor running, pour this mixture through the feed tube. Process until the dough wraps itself around the blade, about 30 seconds to 1 minute. If the dough seems dry, add the remaining 1 tablespoon of water and process until the dough comes together.",
      "Shape the dough into a flat disk and wrap tightly in a double layer of plastic wrap. Chill in the refrigerator until form before using, about 2 hours. If the dough is too cold and firm, it will splinter and break when rolled out. Let it stand at room temperature for 10 to 15 minutes to become more pliable.",
      "Cut the nectarines into 1/2-inch-thick slices and cut each slice in half across the width. You should have approximately 3 cups of sliced fruit.",
      "Place the sliced nectarines together in a large mixing bowl. Add the brown sugar and toss together to distribute evenly. Taste the fruit to see if it needs any more brown sugar.",
      "Pulse the remaining 1/3 cup of walnuts and 1 tablespoon of granulated sugar together in the work bowl of a food processor fitted with a steel blade until the walnuts are very finely ground, about 1 minute. Add the egg yolk and vanilla and pulse to blend.",
      "Cut the softened butter into small pieces and add it to the walnut mixture. Pulse several times until the butter is cut into tiny pieces. Add the remaining 2 teaspoons of flour and pulse until the mixture is smooth, about 15 seconds.",
      "Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 375\u00b0F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a nonstick liner.",
      "On a smooth, flat surface, roll out the pastry dough between sheets of lightly floured waxed or parchment paper to a large disk about 14 inches in diameter. Carefully peel the paper off the top of the dough and brush off any excess flour.",
      "Dip a 4-inch round plain biscuit cutter into flour or use a small knife to cut out 4-inch rounds of dough. Use an offset spatula to lift the dough rounds and transfer them to the lined baking sheet, leaving at least 1 inch of space between them.",
      "Divide the walnut filling evenly among the dough rounds. Use a spoon or offset spatula to spread the filling over the center of the pastry dough, leaving a 1-inch border all around. Mound the sliced nectarines over the walnut filling in the center of each dough circle.",
      "Cut the remaining 2 teaspoons of chilled butter into small pieces and distribute them evenly over the sliced nectarines.",
      "Fold the border of each dough round up so that it partially encloses the nectarines and walnut filling. It will naturally form pleats as it is folded. Brush the borders of each dough round with some of the cream, being careful that it doesn't run down the sides and under the galettes. If it does, wipe it up because it can cause the bottoms of the galettes to burn. Gently lift back the folds of the dough and brush those areas with more cream, then replace the folds. Evenly sprinkle the remaining 1 teaspoon of granulated sugar over the dough borders.",
      "Bake the galettes for 35 to 40 minutes, until the crusts are light golden. Remove the baking sheet from the oven and transfer to a rack to cool.",
      "Combine the apricot preserves and amaretto, Cognac, or water in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium heat. Remove the saucepan from the heat and strain the glaze into a small bowl, pushing through as much of the pulp as possible.",
      "Use a goose-feather pastry brush to lightly brush the top of each galette with the glaze."

Begin rolling the thin end so you end up with a ball about 3 inches in diameter on the fat end attached to a thick rope (think of the shape of a Tootsie Pop) about 6 inches long. Using a bench scraper, pizza cutter, or sharp knife, slit the rope in half all the way up to the ball. Form the two pieces that you just created into ears. Set this aside.",

Form it into a U-shape and slide the U under the narrow end of the egg-shaped piece of dough on the parchment. Leave the loose ends sticking out about 2 inches. (This doesn't have to be exact - arrange it so it looks pleasing to you. The important thing is that the base of that U is anchored under the body.) Those loose ends will be the front paws.",
      "Form the last piece into a rope about 9 inches long. As you roll, leave a fatter bit in the center then thin it out, and leave the ends fatter. Fold the dough in half and form that center fat bit into a ball. This will be the bunny's tail.",

Put the head on the body, and adjust the front paws and ears as desired. Sprinkle the bunny with flour or white rice flour, and cover it with plastic wrap. Set aside until doubled in size - about 30 minutes.",

Cut slits for the eyes, or if you prefer, make tiny cuts to form eyelashes. Pinch the front of the dough to form a nose. If you wish, gently adjust the paws and ears, because they've probably moved a bit during the rise.",

The dough is done when it is sticking to the sides of the bowl and the paddle.",

Wrap each disk in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or overnight for best results.",

Reduce the heat to low and simmer the syrup for 5 minutes, swirling to be sure all the sugar has dissolved. Remove it from the heat and let the syrup infuse for 30 minutes. Remove the vanilla bean and discard it or rinse and reserve it for another use. Let the syrup cool.",
      "In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the butter until it is smooth and free of lumps. Add in the confectioners' sugar and 3 tablespoons of the cooled vanilla syrup and beat the mixture on high speed until it is very smooth. Set it aside in a cool place (not refrigerated), covered so the icing won't harden, until you're ready to use it.",

      "Lightly dust your work surface with glutinous rice flour and knead the dough until it is very uniform and smooth, about 8 turns. Shape the dough into two 4-by-6-inch (10-by-15-cm) rectangles. Roll them out to 1/8 inch (3 mm) thick, maintaining their rectangular shape. Trim each rectangle to 8 by 14 inches (20 by 35.5 cm), then cut each into four 4-by-7-inch (10-by-17-cm) rectangles.",
      "Spread 1 generous tablespoon of preserves onto four of the rectangles, being sure to keep a border of at least 1/2 inch (12 mm) on all sides. Using the tip of your finger or a pastry brush, lightly dampen the dough border with cool water. Top each filled rectangle with an unfilled rectangle and seal the edges by applying smooth even pressure with your fingers or with the tines of a fork. Transfer the tarts to two unlined baking sheets, leaving at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) between each tart.",
      "Bake for 10 minutes, then switch the pans on the racks and bake for about 10 minutes more, until the tarts are browned on the edges.Let cool on the baking sheets for 5 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.",
      "Using an offset spatula, ice each tart with 1 to 2 tablespoons of the buttercream. If desired, dip your fingers in water and run them over the icing to smooth it out for that trademark sleek finish. Garnish each with a dried or dehydrated fruit reflective of the filling. The buttercream will keep for up to 2 weeks in an airtight container in the fridge for that next batch of pop tarts! Simply allow the icing to come to room temperature 1 hour before you plan on using it."

      "Pat the lamb cubes dry on all sides with paper towels and season well with salt and pepper. In a large slope-sided saute pan over medium-high heat, heat the oil until it shimmers. Distribute the meat evenly in the bottom of the pan without crowding it and don't disturb it for several minutes. If you stir the cubes too soon, they will release water and the meat will boil instead of browning. After 3 or 4 minutes, turn the cubes over and brown them on the other side for another 3 or 4 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the meat to a bowl and return the pan to the heat.",
      "Add the onion, carrots, and celery, stirring with a flat-edged wooden spatula. As the vegetables cook, water will release and deglaze the pan. Use the spatula to scrape up brown bits from the bottom of the pan. Sweat the vegetables for 4 to 5 minutes. They should be translucent but still a bit firm.",
      "Stir in the flour and allow it to brown lightly for about 2 minutes. Add the lamb stock, continuing to scrape up any brown bits from the bottom of the pan. Stir in the potatoes, bay leaves, thyme, rosemary, and oregano. Return the meat and its collected juices to the pan. Bring the liquid to a boil. Lower the heat to medium and cover the pot. Simmer for 1 1/2 hours, until the meat is fork tender. Discard the bay leaves and transfer the stew to an 8-cup baking dish.",

      "Drain the potatoes, return them to the pot, and stir them over the heat for a couple of minutes. This ensures that they are dry. Rice the potatoes into a mixing bowl. Add the egg yolks, butter, and cream, whisking until the mixture is smooth. Work quickly while the potatoes are hot so they don't become gummy and starchy. Adjust the salt seasoning to taste and allow the potatoes to cool.",
      "Fit a large pastry bag with a large star tip. Spoon the mashed potatoes into the bag. Moving in one direction, pipe large rosettes of potatoes over the lamb mixture, in neat row or around the perimeter of the baking dish. Go over your work and pipe rosettes wherever you see any holes-you want to create a good seal. Alternatively, you can dollop the potatoes over the stew and spread them with a spatula to seal it.",
      "Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Set the pie on it and bake for 30 to 35 minutes, until the potatoes are nicely browned and the filing is bubbling. Let the casserole rest for 15 minutes; serve with piccalilli on the side if you'd like."

(Whatever you don't cook immedi-ately can be frozen for future use.)",

Working in batches, pan-fry the pancakes until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes on each side. If the sides or middle puff up during cooking, press them down with a spatula to ensure even cooking. (You may also need another tablespoon of oil between batches.) Transfer the pancakes to a plate, cut into wedges, and serve."

With a pastry cutter or pizza cutter (or a knife, but a rolling cutter is easier) trim the edges so they're straight. You'll use those scraps as well. After trimming, my rectangle of dough was about 9 x 18 inches. Cut the dough into 9-inch long strips, about the thickness of a pencil, and place them on baking sheets, leaving a little room between each so they can expand a little during baking. You will need about 3 baking sheets to fit them all. You can twist the breadsticks, or leave them straight. When you're done with all of the uniformly-shaped breadsticks, cut the scraps as well, combining smaller pieces if needed.",

      "Let the breadsticks cool completely on racks, then leave them out for several hours or overnight before you store them in any sort of closed container-any residual moisture can make them soft.

The water will become cloudy and may have some debris like the odd skin from the peas (even though they are skinless) or dust from the packaging. Drain this water. Repeat 3 to 4 times until the water, upon rinsing the peas, remains clearer. Add 4 cups water to the pan with the peas and let it come to a boil over medium-high heat. You will see some foam rise to the surface; scoop it out and discard it.",
      "Drain the potatoes and add them with the turmeric to the peas, stirring once or twice. Reduce the heat to medium-low and cover the pan. Cook the melange, stirring occasionally, until the peas are tender but still firm looking and the potatoes are cooked, 20 to 25 minutes.",
      "Meanwhile, heat a small skillet over medium-high heat. Once the skillet feels hot (when you hold the palm of your hand close to the bottom of the skillet you will feel the heat), usually after 2 to 4 minutes, add the chiles, coriander, and cumin. Toast the spices, shaking the skillet every few seconds, until the chiles blacken and smell smoky hot and the seeds turn reddish brown and smell incredibly aromatic (nutty with citrus undertones), 1 to 2 minutes. Immediately transfer the spice blend to a blender and plunk in the tomato. Puree, scraping the insides of the blender as needed, to make a smooth, reddish brown paste with a smoky aroma that is sure to knock your socks off.",
      "Once the peas are cooked, add the tomato and spice paste to the pan. I usually pour some of the liquid from the peas into the blender and process it for a brief second to make sure I get every last bit of the tomato paste, and then pour it back into the pan. Stir in the cilantro and salt.",
      "Increase the heat to medium-high and let the dal boil vigorously, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the flavors mingle and the sauce thickens slightly, 12 to 15 minutes. If you would like the sauce to be thicker, mash some of the peas and potatoes with the back of your spoon. Serve the dal warm."

You can also use the butter wrapper for this job because it often has butter still adhering to its inside.",

Turn off the heat, remove the top part of the double boiler from the bottom pan, and continue stirring on the counter until the chocolate has fully melted.",

Then beat in the egg yolks one at a time (or close enough if you've already got them together in one small bowl-the real point is to make sure the eggs get fully mixed into the batter). Finally, beat in the vanilla.",
      "Stop the beaters, scrape them down, and remove them. Add the flour mixture and fold it in with a rubber spatula or a wooden spoon, turning it over in the batter just until there are no more bits of undissolved flour. You can overbeat-and even overstir-the mixture at this point, getting that gluten too gooey and stretchy. Once there's no more white flour in the mix, scrape and spread the batter into the prepared baking dish.",

Using a spoon, lightly flatten the top of the scoop to make room for the rounded bottom of the cookie that you'll be placing on top. Place the frosted cookie on top, and gently press down so that the sandwich comes together. Using a butter knife, gently smooth the sides of the ice cream so that it is flush with the edges of the cookie.",

Add the chard ribs, season with salt, and saute for 2 to 3 minutes, until barely translucent. Add the onion, garlic, and chiles, and season with salt. Saute the vegetables for about 10 minutes, adding water to the pan (as much as 1 cup total), stirring often to prevent the vegetables browning. (You add water to the pan so you can saute and sweat the onion without browning it, but you never want the onion swimming in water-just enough so the pan isn't dry.) Add the chard leaves, season with salt, and fold the leaves in with the onion for 1 or 2 minutes to wilt them slightly. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and cook for 15 to 20 minutes, stirring from time to time, until the chard leaves are very dark green and the onion, leaves, and stems are one soft, homogenous mixture. Turn the vegetables out onto a cutting board and chop, cutting first in one direction and then perpendicular to the first direction, until the vegetables are finely chopped to the point of being almost pureed. Measure out a heaping 1/4 cup of the vegetables for the pasta dish. Use the rest as an excuse to prepare this dish again in the very near future, or spoon a heaping spoonful under a piece of grilled fish, topped with a spoonful of Salsa Verde.",

Stir the meat and cook for another 4 minutes, breaking it into pea- size pieces, until it is cooked through. Add the chopped chard and cook for 2 to 3 minutes to warm it through, stirring the chard into the sausage as it cooks.

Add the butter, stir until it melts, and turn off the heat while you cook the pasta.",

About 1 minute before the pasta is done, place the sauce over high heat. Lift the pasta out of the cooking water or drain it and immediately add it to the pan with the sauce. Cook the pasta with the sauce together for 1 to 2 minutes, stirring with a rubber spatula, until the sauce is thick, adding fresh water to the pan if the pasta looks dry or sticky instead of slippery and glistening. Turn off the heat and add the finishing-quality olive oil, Parmigiano-Reggiano, and fennel pollen, stirring vigorously and shaking the pan to emulsify the sauce. Pile the orecchiette in the center of each of eight plates, dividing it evenly, and spoon any sauce left in the pan over the pasta.

Wipe any blood or guts from the board you are working on as you go. The whole frames (i.e., skeletons with heads and tails still on and guts attached) from which the fillets have been taken can be kept and frozen, then used later for pot bait.",
      "Mix together all the ingredients for the cure. Sprinkle some cure lightly over the bottom of your chosen tray, box, or dish, then place the first layer of fillets on it skin side down, with the thin edges just overlapping. Then sprinkle another, slightly thicker layer of cure over. Arrange the next layer of mackerel skin side up and sprinkle over another layer of cure, then place the next layer skin side down (as shown, above left). Keep going until you've used all your fish, or filled the dish.",
      "Put the board/lid/plate on top of the final layer and weight it down with a brick, storage jar, or whatever comes to hand. Place in the fridge. You can eat the gravad max after 24 hours, but 48 is best. For really big fillets, you could wait for 72 hours. Remove the board and lift out the fillets carefully, one at a time. Give them a very quick rinse and then pat dry immediately with a clean cloth or paper towels.",
      "You could serve whole fillets, leaving the problem of cutting it away from the skin and avoiding the pinbones (which are still there, running down the middle of each fillet) to your guests. Or, you could be kinder and trim the fish before serving. So, place the cured fillet on a board, skin side down, and run a flexible filleting knife between the flesh and the skin. Alternatively, you can sometimes just start the process with the knife, then peel the skin off with your fingers.",
      "Now slice the skinless fillet off either side of the pinbone line to give you 2 long fillets - and a very thin waste piece in the middle with the pinbones in it, which you should discard. The belly-side fillet may require a final trim to remove the fine belly bones.",
      "mix the mustard, sugar, and vinegar together. Add the dill, mix well, and leave to macerate for a few minutes. Mix again, then stir in the creme fraiche. Serve the mackerel - 2 whole fillets or 4 trimmed pieces per person - with the creamy sauce on the side and plenty of brown bread and butter."

If the fish sticks, try to gently lift it from below using a thin metal spatula or the tines of a carving fork inserted down between the grill grates. Turn fish and repeat on second side.",
      "For an ideal doneness of rare, cook the fish long enough to sear each side, and no longer. You should be able to watch the heat penetrate the fish from each side because tuna changes color so dramatically, from a deep purple when raw to a beige when cooked. Use the side of the fish to gauge doneness: if you want it very rare in the center, the sides of the steaks should still look purple, with the color of the cooked fish just starting to creep in from above and below. If you want it a little more done, let the cooked color creep up a bit more from both sides. We don't recommend cooking tuna steaks beyond medium-rare."

Unlike the pork rib membrane, which is fresh and thin, the membrane on the underside of the beef rib is thick and a bit of a pain. To remove it, score down each side of the individual bones, being careful not to cut into the flesh. Get a proper butcher's knife with some flexibility and work up the rib, removing the membrane with as little flesh as possible. Try to keep the knife as flat as you can to the flesh, just skinning the membrane from it. The removed membrane should be about 3/4 inch wide and run the entire length of each rib. All that will remain is a small section of membrane on the rib bone itself, which is a fair compromise.",

The internal temperature should be about 192\u00b0 to 197\u00b0F, the meat squishy and soft with a thick dark crust. We like the ribs naked, but if you prefer them with sauce, give them a good basting with Mother Sauce or barbecue sauce 30 minutes before removing them. Alternatively adjust the barbecue for direct grilling and paint them constantly with the sauce while turning them over the heat.",

When the oil is warm, add the sliced onion and fennel to the pot, and season with salt and pepper. Allow the vegetables to sweat for 2 minutes, and then add in the sliced garlic. Cook the vegetables for another 3 minutes.",
      "Next, add in the can of drained petite diced tomatoes and the white wine. Raise the heat to high, and allow the wine to reduce slightly for about 2 minutes.",
      "Add the fish stock to the pot, and add in the saffron and the bay leaf. When the stock comes to a boil, reduce the heat to low, and allow the stock to simmer uncovered for 10 minutes. It is this part of the process from which \"bouillabaisse\" gets its name: the first part of the word means \"to boil,\" and the second, \"to lower.\" The saffron will bloom in the simmering liquid, and will steep like tea in the stock, causing it to turn its trademark marigold color. Season again lightly with salt and pepper.",
      "After 10 minutes have passed, add in the rock shrimp and the mussels, and stir them around in the bouillabaisse broth. They should take no more than 3 minutes to cook; the shrimp will turn from grey to coral in color, and the mussels will open.",
      "While the stock is simmering, cook the sea bass. Begin by seasoning the sea bass well with salt and pepper on both sides. Then cover the bottom of a large nonstick saute pan with olive oil-a typical pan will require about 2 tablespoons. Heat the oil on medium-high heat, and when the oil starts to shimmer, add the four filets of fish. Cook for about 3-4 minutes per side, until golden.",
      "To toast the baguette, arrange the slices in a single layer on a baking sheet, and run into a 350-degree oven until dry and golden, about 10 minutes, but keep an eye on them!",
      "For the rouille, combine the mayonnaise, garlic, lemon juice and zest, and roasted red pepper in a mini food processor, and season with salt and pepper. Blend until pureed and combined. Rouille, which translates to \"rust,\" because of the color it traditionally takes on from saffron and peppers, can be served alongside the bouillabaisse with these little baguette toasts-perfect for dipping and shoveling in the broth."
