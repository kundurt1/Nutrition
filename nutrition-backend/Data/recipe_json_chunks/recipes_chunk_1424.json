      "Note: Wine Suggestion:The tartness of the cranberries, sweetness of the bourbon, and pungency of the horseradish all take this ham in a decidedly different direction than the Ham with Champagne and Vanilla Glaze (page 109). The dramatic boldness of these flavors call for an equally bold and very fruity wine. Gewurztraminers from Alsace, France, fitthebill. Try the current vintage from any of the following producers: Trimbach, Hugel, Domaine Weinbach, or Zind-Humbrecht (about $18 to $22)."

      "Wine note: When a dish has an ingredient that is also a signature flavor in a wine, go with the match. For this pizza, it's viognier, a full-bodied, aromatic white that often announces itself with apricot aromas. Try the Bridlewood 2008 Reserve Viognier from California's central coast ($24). Under its stone fruit flavors lurk layers of citrus-tangerine and tangy grapefruit-with an elegant honeysuckle wrap. Rich enough to love the prosciutto on the pizza, the wine has lovely acidity that works well with goat cheese, too. -Sara Schneider"

      "If using fresh greens, discard any tough stems and chop the leaves. Rinse and shake gently to remove most but not all of the water. Place 2 tablespoons of the oil in a large stockpot with the garlic and cook over medium-high heat. As soon as the garlic begins to brown, add the greens and toss. Add 1/2 teaspoon of the salt. Cover immediately and cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes or until very tender. (If using frozen spinach, press out the liquid, then saute the spinach in 2 tablespoons of the oil and the garlic for about 5 minutes.) Remove from heat and set aside to cool. Meanwhile, in a medium saucepan over medium heat, combine the remaining olive oil, the flour, and the remaining salt. Cook, whisking constantly, for about 3 minutes. Add the milk and increase heat to medium-high. Cook, stirring constantly, until the sauce thickens and boils, about 10 minutes. Stir in all but 1/2 cup of the grated cheese. Heat oven to 350\u00b0 F. Coat a 13-by-9-inch baking pan with cooking spray. Blend the ricotta, eggs, lemon zest, and nutmeg into the greens. Spread about 1/2 cup of the cheese sauce in the bottom of the baking pan. Place 3 sheets of pasta on top. Spread on 1/4 of the spinach filling and 1/2 cup sauce, then another 3 sheets of pasta. Make 3 more layers. End with the pasta and sauce, and sprinkle with the remaining cheese. Cover with foil and bake 45 minutes. Remove the foil and cook 15 minutes more or until golden. Let stand 10 minutes before serving. (Can be made up to 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate. Reheat in a 325\u00b0 F oven for 20 minutes or until a knife inserted in the center comes out hot.)"

      "Variations:: Puree four cups (two ten-ounce packages) of defrosted frozen corn kernels with the milk (not the broth). Since frozen corn is already cooked, stir the puree into the soup when the milk is added in Step 3, bring just to a simmer, and then stir in the crabmeat and chives.: Substitute half a pound of medium peeled shrimp for the crabmeat. Stir the shrimp in along with the milk and cook for three to five minutes.",
      "Wine Recommendation: The complex flavors of crab blend beautifully with those of chardonnay. White burgundies, made from chardonnay, have a more mineral taste and are less fruity than their American counterparts. Choose a Macon-Villages or Saint-Veran for a great match here."
