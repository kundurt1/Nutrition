If you need to add more flour, only add it 1 teaspoon at a time, and rework the dough after each flour addition (before adding more). Form the dough into a smooth ball, brush it with a little oil and place it back in the bowl for about 1 hour at room temperature. Covering the dough with plastic wrap is fine, too.",

      "\"Before beginning the adventure with puff paste there is one thing to be explained that will make its compositions comparatively easy.",
      "(Ha Ha!) The butter used must be washed.",
      "The purpose of washing it is to make it elastic.",
      "It should be soft through being kneaded, but in no sense soft through being melted- quite the contrary, it must be soft and cold at the same time.",
      "In winter turn on the cold water faucet.",
      "Manipulate the butter with the hands under the stream of cold water until it is creamy and waxy.",
      "At other seasons, do this in a quart of ice water placed in a bowl of ice.",
      "The butter may be kneaded with a spoon if preferred.",
      "The final kneading of the butter is done on a board or it is patted briskly in the hands until no water flies.",
      "This is the recipe of a professional cook.",
      "As it calls for egg yolks it differs from the orthodox rule for puff paste.",
      "However, her results are remarkable and her method is simple, so I am giving it in preference to the usual rather complicated recipes.",
      "(Ha Ha again, it is complicated!) She stresses 2 points: Keep the hands, the bowl, the board and the rolling pin as cold as possible.",
      "(Ha Ha, your hands will be frostbitten!) A cold windy day is best for making puff paste.",
      "\"Work with hands,as in the first paragraph, under water, 1 cup of butter.",
      "Place 1/4 cup butter in a cold bowl.",
      "Form the remainder into a square and place it where it will keep cold.",
      "Add to the butter in the bowl, the flour and salt, work these ingredients with a pastry blender, 2 knives or the finger tips.",
      "Beat and add 1/4 cup ice water and 2 egg yolks, (the yolks may be omitted, in that case use in all, 6 tablespoons of water).",
      "Work these ingredients well with the hands.",
      "If necessary add, to loosen the dough from the bowl, a pinch of flour.",
      "Place the dough were it will be cold but will not freeze, preferably in the open air.",
      "If it is not possible to do this, fold the dough in a clean cloth and place it in a dripping pan that has been placed between 2 dripping pans filled with ice.",
      "After 15 minutes, roll the dough into a square on a floured board.",
      "Roll it one way only, not back and forth.",
      "A good way is out from the centre.",
      "Put the square of butter in the centre of the dough and fold the 4 corners to the centre completely covering the butter.",
      "Permit the dough to stand on a cloth or piece of waxed paper in a cold place for 1/2 hour.",
      "Turn it once to keep it from becoming dry.",
      "Roll out the dough again into a square and fold the corners to the centre.",
      "Permit it to stand again for 1/2 hour.",
      "Repeat this process.",
      "The dough must be chilled and rolled at least 4 times in all.",
      "Chill the dough until you are ready to use it.",
      "Wrapped in waxed paper it may be kept in the refrigerator for several days.",
      "Roll it, cut it into shapes.",
      "Chill it again and bake it.",
      "One of the secrets of success of puff paste is to have it ice cold when placed in a hot oven.",
      "The matter of baking puff paste is a moot point.",
      "In all rules the very cold paste is put into a very hot oven- 500\u00b0F.",
      "In some it is baked at this temperature throughout.",
      "In this case the pastry is covered with waxed paper after 10 minutes baking.",
      "In other rules the heat is reduced 50 degrees every 5 minutes until the temperature is 350\u00b0F for final baking.",

      "HOW TO MAKE YOUR OWN RICE GRITS: Although you can order Carolina Gold Rice Grits online you can also make your own. \"To do so, freeze your favorite good-quality long-grain rice (I bought organic standard long grain white rice) for 30 minutes to make it brittle. Then, working in batches, grind it a few times in a spice mill until the grains are very coarsely ground into rough, uneven pieces about a third of the original grain's size. Transfer the mixture to a medium strainer set over a bowl to sift out the \"dust,\" then use the remaining pieces in any recipe that calls for rice grits.\" CG says ^^this step was easier said than done. My version was much easier: after removing the rice from the freezer I ground the rice to the same consistency as regular (corn) grits that they were virtually identical in appearance except for those little black specks in corn grits. If you don't know what traditional grits look like, go to Google and search for an image to guide you. I skipped the strainer part, too. (Uh, CG -- I must ask -- Isn't this in essence Cream of RiceTM? Yes, but it's glorified Cream of RiceTM, I answer!).",
