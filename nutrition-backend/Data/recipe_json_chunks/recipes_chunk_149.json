Form about 1/2-inch high, 1 1/2-inches wide and 14-inches long, spacing them at least 2-inches apart. I use parchment paper instead of greasing and flouring a pan, as it is much easier to transfer them onto a cooling rack.",

With a serrated knife, slice diagonally on a 45\u00b0 angle about 1/2-inch thick. Place the slices upright on the baking sheet and return to the oven for about 8 minutes longer to dry slightly. Let cool on a rack. If you like the frosting on them, when they are completely cooled, melt some white chocolate squares or white chocolate chips in a double boiler or in the microwave and spread on the cookies. The chocolate can burn easily in the microwave, so melt it slowly on a low setting, stirring frequently, until completely melted. This makes 3 1/2 to 4 dozen."
