Add the chicken broth and rinsed black beans to the pot along with the flour and 1/2&1/2 mixture. Simmer on low while the potatoes continue to get softer and more tender, stirring frequently. Add the wine, salt and pepper - all to taste. Simmer for a few more minutes and then add the cheese and bacon. Do not boil but bring temperature back up to serve.

      "Mix the flour, 3/4 cup water, lard, and vinegar in a bowl (preferably non reactive) until dough is quite stiff, almost too hard to knead, but not crumbly. Let this rest overnight, 10-24 hours.",
      "When time is up, heat remaining water till warm to the touch. Mix in yeast and molasses, and let it sit for 5-10 minutes, till very foamy. If nothing happens, yeast is dead or too old- try again with new yeast.",
      "Mix in the yeast mixture with rest of dough and knead until dough is smooth and elastic, adding water as needed. Re grease the bowl, cover with a lid or towel, and let it rest in a warm oven until doubled (to warm oven, turn it to 350 F/180 C for one minute, then turn it off and quickly put the bowl inside.) Let it rise until doubled, 1-2 hours.",
      "Do another rising, in a warm oven, for 20 minutes. At this point, you may cut the dough in half and freeze one or both pieces. Just put it in a plastic bag and let all the air out. It will last about 6 months in the freezer.",
      "Preheat oven to 500 F/250&deg;C Grease one or two pans (8x11 or a round pizza pan) with lard or olive oil and CAREFULLY flatten out each pizza onto the pan(s). Brush pizza liberally with melted butter. Top with toppings just before putting in oven- not earlier, since the crust might get soggy. It can hold lots of toppings, so go crazy!",
      "Baked pizza for 12-15 minutes, one pizza at a time. Serve immediately or cool and freeze by covering with plastic wrap. Unfreeze in the fridge and reheat in the oven.",
      "Tips: If pizza doesn't rise, it can still be saved! Just add 2 tsp baking soda after the last rise. Unsweetened (check ingredients) yogurt or kefir can be subbed for 3/4 cup water and 1/4 cup vinegar. This pizza is best made without a crust, but if you want, pinch the edges of the pizza upwards to make one."

    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "Make the filling: Drain the ricotta in a fine sieve set over a bowl for 1 hour (or longer if the ricotta is very wet). If using fresh spinach, stem and rinse it well (don't dry the leaves). In a 12 inch skillet over medium high heat, cook the spinach until wilted (3 to 5 minutes). Drain well and squeee out excess moisture and chop finely. If using thawed frozen spinach, squeeze it dry.",
      "Melt the butter in a 10 inch or 12 inch skillet over medim-low heat and add the onion. Cook until the onion is soft and translucent, 5 to 8 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for about 1 minute. Add the spinach and toss it for 1 to 2 minutes to coat it with the butter. Transfer the spinach mixture to a bowl and let it cool to room temperature. Add the ricotta, Parmigiano, eggs, salt, pepper, and nutmeg. Mix well. You should have about 4 1/2 cups.",
      "Cook the noodles: If using dried lasagna noodles instead of fresh use 1 lb and skip these cooking instructions--cook according to package instructions. If cooking fresh: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Prepare a large bowl of ice water. Slip the noodles, 2 or 3 at a time, into the boiling water and cook them until they're tender and pale (3 to 5 minutes). Thinner noodles will cook more frequently. To make sure they're done, taste a small piece. If it's still tough, it needs a little more cooking (fresh pasta should not be cooked al dente like dried pasta). Carefully scoop the noodles out of the pot with a large wire skimmer and slide them into the ice water to stop the cooking. When they're cool, layer them between clean dish towels until you're ready to assemble the lasagna (the noodles will keep this way for up to 2 hours).",
      "Make the Quick Tomato Sauce: In a 3 or 4 quart saucepan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the carrot, celery, onion, parsley, basil, a generous pinch of salt, and a couple grinds of pepper. Cook until the vegetables are pale gold (10 to 12 minutes). Add the wine and cook until it evaporates, about 5 minutes. Add the tomatoes with their juices, stir well, and simmer gently to blend the flavors and reduce the sauce to about 4 1/2 cups, 15 to 20 minutes (adjust the heat as necessary to maintain a gentle simmer). Season to taste with salt and pepper. If you want a smoother texture, pass the sauce through a food mill or puree in a food processor.",
      "Make the Basic Cream Sauce: In a 2-quart saucepan, melt the butter over medium-low heat. Add the flour and cook, whisking constantly for 2 to 3 minutes. Do not let the mixture brown. Slowly whisk in the hot milk and bring just to a simmer, whisking frequently. Reduce the heat to low and cook, whisking often, until the sauce has thickened to a creamy, gravy-like consistency and no longer tastes of raw flour, 6 to 8 minutes for a single batch, 10 to 12 minutes for a double batch (you only need 1 batch for this recipe). Remove from the heat and whisk in the salt, pepper, and nutmeg. If you don't use this sauce within 30 minutes it will thicken. Add a little warm milk and whisk to the sauce to thin it if necessary.",
      "Assemble the lasagna: Position a rack in the center of the oven and heat the oven to 350. Choose a 9x12x3 inch baking dish or 10x14x2 inch baking dish. Spread 1/2 cup of the tomato sauce in a sparse layer on the bottom of the baking dish. Cover the sauce with a slightly overlapping layer of cooked noodles, cutting them as needed to fill the gaps. With a spatula, spread one third of the spinach and ricotta filling (about 1 1/2 cups) over the first layer of noodles. Then spread one third of the remaining tomato sauce (about 1 1/3 cups) and one third (1/2 cup) of the cream sauce over the filling. Sprinkle 1/3 cup of the Parmigiano on top. Add a new layer of noodles, overlapping them slightly, and repeat the layers as instructed above, using all of the filling and ending with the Parmigiano, to make a total of 3 layers (you may not need all the pasta). Dot the top with the butter cubes.",
      "Put the baking dish on a baking sheet and bake until heated through and bubbling at the edges, 45 to 50 minutes. Remove from the oven and let rest for 10 to 15 minutes before serving."

      "First, choose your cheese. I suggest choosing between 2-4 kinds of cheese depending on how much variety you want on your skewer. Be sure you're also choosing cheeses that will hold up to being cut and skewered. My favorites for this are: your favorite cheddar, a simple brie that isn't too runny at room temp, a goat gouda, and a blue like fourme d'ambert. Cube all your cheese.",
      "When getting ready to cube hard cheese (like cheddar or gouda), be sure to let it come to room temperature so it doesn't shatter when you try to slice it. Softer cheeses are ok to cut cold.",
      "Get out your skewers, I like to use mid-sized or traditional kababs cut in half.",
      "Now, layer your skewers with your cheese plate cubes. The pattern I use is: cheese, olive, bread, different cheese, salami,bread, cheese, olive prociutto, bread, apricot. This is to keep the cheeses from touching so you can enjoy them individually while always giving the eater a piece of bread next to a piece of cheese.",
      "Feel free to have fun layering! Try this method with your favorite cheese plate staples for a fun picnic dish that will quickly become everyone's favorite."

While syrup is boiling, in large bowl of a standing electric mixer beat whites with a pinch salt until foamy and beat in cream of tartar. Beat whites until they just hold stiff peaks and beat in hot syrup in a stream (try to avoid beaters and side of bowl). Beat mixture at medium speed until completely cool, 15 to 20 minutes. Beat in butter, 1 piece at a time, and beat until thickened and smooth. (Buttercream will at first appear very thin and at some point look like it is breaking but, as more butter is beaten in, it will thicken and become glossy and smooth.) Beat in orange curd, salt, and zest until smooth. Buttercream may be made 4 days ahead and chilled in an airtight container or 2 weeks ahead and frozen in an airtight container. Bring buttercream completely to room temperature (this may take several hours if frozen) and beat before using. (If buttercream is too cold when beaten it will not be glossy and smooth.) Makes about 8 cups.",

Generously coat a cotton towel (not terry cloth) with flour, wheat bran or cornmeal; put dough seam side down on towel and dust with more flour, bran or cornmeal. Cover with another cotton towel and let rise for about 2 hours. When it is ready, dough will be more than double in size and will not readily spring back when poked with a finger.",

When dough is ready, carefully remove pot from oven. Slide your hand under towel and turn dough over into pot, seam side up; it may look like a mess, but that is O.K. Shake pan once or twice if dough is unevenly distributed; it will straighten out as it bakes. Cover with lid and bake 30 minutes, then remove lid and bake another 15 to 30 minutes, until loaf is beautifully browned. Cool on a rack."
