      "DOUGH: Place the cornmeal, salt, and baking powder into a large mixing bowl and combine. Add the lard and using your hands, knead together until the lard is well incorporated into the dry mixture. Gradually add enough of the reserved cooking liquid, 3 to 4 cups to create a dough that is like thick mashed potatoes. The dough should be moist but not wet. Cover the bowl with a damp towel and set aside until ready to use.",
      "ASSEMBLY: Remove a corn husks from the water and pat dry to remove excess water. Working in batches of 6, lay the husks on a towel and spread about 2 tablespoons of the dough in an even layer across the wide end of the husk to within 1/2-inch of the edges. Spoon about 1 tablespoon of the meat mixture in a line down the center of the dough. Roll the husk so the dough surrounds the meat, then fold the bottom under to finish creating the tamale. Repeat until all husks, dough and filling are used. Tie the tamales, around the center, individually or in groups of 3, with kitchen twine.",
      "TO COOK TAMALES: Stand the tamales upright on their folded ends, tightly packed together, in the same saucepan used to cook the meat. Add the reserved broth from making the dough and any additional water so the liquid comes to 1-inch below the tops of the tamales. Do not pour the broth into the tops of the tamales. Cover, and simmer until the dough is firm and pulls away easily from the husk, about 30-60 minutes (Alton says 2 hrs, but ours were done much sooner).",
      "SAUCE: To make a wet sauce to serve with the tamales, after removing them from the broth, add a little tomato paste (about 3 oz) to the broth and simmer till thickened.",
      "STORING TAMALES: Tightly wrapped in plastic wrap, in the freezer, for up to a month. To reheat, remove the plastic wrap and steam until heated through (we used a steamer basket in the microwave and they were done in 8 minutes, so it makes a great quick munchie snack). :)."

    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "Use about 1 teaspoon of the Crisco to grease a 9 or 10-inch pyrex (glass) pie pan.",
      "Preheat the oven to 400\u00b0F.",
      "On a flat working surface, dust the area with 1/4 cup of the flour.",
      "In a large mixing bowl, pour in 3 cups of the flour (this leaves you with 1/4 cup of flour). Add the salt and mix it in with the flour. Add the remaining Crisco and the butter and work it with your hands until you get peas-sized \"grainy\" flour. Add 1/2 cup of water to the flour and blend it (with your hands or a fork) until it forms a good pie dough. Add any additional water a Tablespoon at a time if it is needed.",
      "NOTE: If the dough gets sticky, you've added too much water, just add a little more flour until the consistency is right.",
      "Next, cut the dough in half and make a fat pancake out of each with your hands. Place one hunk of dough back into the mixing bowl and place a slightly dampened towel down over it. Lay the second one on the floured working surface.",
      "Use a rolling pin to carefully roll out the dough, making it as much of a circle shape as possible. (Never roll back and forth -- I start from the center and carefully roll out to the edges mostly) Roll it out, dusting the top with a little of the remaining flour as needed to avoid it sticking to the rolling pin. (You can also wipe down and dust your rolling pin occasionally). When the dough is about 1/16\" thick, it's done. Dust the top with a little flour and then carefully pull one side back and lay the dough on itself to form a half-moon. Dust the half that's now exposed, flip it over and lightly dust the second half.",
      "Lay the dough into the greased pie pan, still folded in half, and once it's in the pan, carefully unfold it to cover the entire plate. Carefully ease the dough into the pan without ever stretching it. Use a sharp paring knife or scissors to trim the dough around the pan, allowing about 3/4\" to hang over the edge. After trimming, simply use the excess hanging dough by pulling it back up with your fingers and folding it along the top edge. This need not be neat, just roughly form an edge.",
      "Place the crust in the preheated oven and allow it to bake until the slightest bit of brown begins to show on the crust edge in one or two spots, about 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and set the crust off to the side for awhile.",
      "Peel the apples, quarter them, and drop them into a bowl of water. Cut the lemon in two and squeeze all the juice into the water before dropping the peeled apples in (this keeps them from browning).",
      "Having a second bowl ready at hand for apple slices, cut the core portions from each apple quarter and slice up the remaining apple piece, I usually get about 4-5 slices from each quarter.",
      "When all the apple slices are in the second bowl, pour on the sugar, (reserving 1 teaspoon of it) cinnamon and allspice. You can add a couple dashes of salt if you wish.",
      "Mix with a spoon and allow it to sit for at least 10 minutes.",
      "Next, fill the baked pie crust with the apple slices, adding as much syrup from the bottom of the bowl as you like. Mound the apples up in the center of the pie to about 3/4- 1\" above the pie pan edge.",
      "Make your pie crust top the same as you made the bottom and lay it carefully over the filling. Trim it, leaving about 3/4\" extra \"hangover\". Pull the extra crust up and, as you did before, just roughly (carefully!) form it on to the existing edge. Don't worry about making it pretty. If it sticks out here and there, that's all the better.",
      "Next, add 1/2 teaspoon of water to your egg white and whisk with a fork in a bowl. Use a small brush or your fingers to rub the egg white on to the pie crust top, getting the edges as well. Once you have done this, sprinkle your remaining teaspoon of sugar over the top.",
      "Use a sharp knife to cut some air holes into the pie crust top. I cut an \"A\" into my apple pies, which works well to allow steam to escape.",
      "Bake the pie (same temperature, 400\u00b0.) for about 30 minutes. When it is golden brown on top, it's done.",
      "Allow the pie to rest for 30 minutes before slicing and serve with vanilla ice cream on the side.",
      "TIP: Some people like the gooey apple pie filling similar to the canned pie filling. If that's the way you like it, just allow your apples to sit for 1/2 an hour with the sugar and spices on them and a syrup will form. Pour this syrup into a saucepan and heat over medium heat. Dissolve 2 tablespoons of cornstarch into 1/3 cup of water and pour it into the apple syrup and bring to a boil, Whisk until it thickens and remove from heat. You can pour this back over your apples and then fill your pie with it. Personally, I don't care for it but life's not the same for everybody!)."

As explained in the preamble, in my hands the dough over-rose in the refrigerator, lost its shape, and wouldn't rise in the oven. And thus I divide, shape and bake the loaves the next day as explained below. It gives me more control of the proofing process.",

To achieve the S shape shown in the photograph, extend each dough piece to about 24 inches. Working from each end simultaneously, coil the dough (in opposite directions) towards the center. Place the shaped doughs on parchment-lined pans, mist with water, sprinkle with sesame seeds if desired, mist with vegetable oil spray, and cover with plastic wrap. Proof the dough for an hour or two; it is ready for the oven when it stays dimpled when poked. The loaves should be about twice as large as when first shaped, but DON'T let them over-rise.",

After the first boil, is when you add in the flour depending on how thick you want the consistency to be. This Marinara usually simmers 45min to 1 hour, but you can also use a crock pot on low to keep it going longer, if desired. Stir in cracked black pepper to taste."

      "1. Cook lasagna noodles in salted water until they are almost cooked fully. Stir occasionally while cooking as it avoids having them stick together. Drain but do not pour water over it as I've found the water prevents the sauce from sticking to the pasta.",
      "2. While lasagna noodles are being cooked, brown lean ground beef with oil in a frying pan.",
      "3. Finely chop onion, mushrooms, and peppers, and add to beef when it is cooked.",
      "4. Add spices and prepared spaghetti sauce, stir and simmer for about 20 minutes, stirring occasionally. I prefer using the Primo sauce as I find it isn't too watery but most any brand will do.",
      "5. To make the filling, in a bowl combine the non-dairy sour cream and non-dairy cream cheese (I use the \"tofutti\" brand), egg, 1/4 cup daiya cheese (or whatever non-dairy cheese you prefer), and the oregano, garlic powder and parsley. Set aside. (The daiya cheese is available in cheddar or mozzerella flavour, although I find both pretty much taste the same).",
      "6. In a seperate bowl combine the fresh non-dairy bread crumbs (I ended up making my own from 3 slices of white bread that was made without dairy). Add 1/4 tsp of oregano, garlic powder and onion powder. Set aside, this will be the topping.",
      "7. In a Lasagna pan add a small amount of the meat sauce in the bottom of the pan. Lay three lasagna noodles on top, Then spread 1/3 of the filling on top of the noodles, and add meat sauce. Repeat this layer two more times, ending again with the meat sauce. You'll have one extra un-used noodle, this is just a bonus for the cook to eat after it goes in the oven with a tiny bit of the sauce on it - you've earned it.",
      "8. Melt 1 Tbsp of the non-dairy margarine (I prefer using \"Vegan Becel\" although I don't know if this is available outside of Canada).",
      "9. Sprinkle the bread crumb mixture on top of the lasagna, and drizzle the melted non-dairy margarine on top. Then sprinkle the non-dairy shredded cheese on top. If you prefer, you can always add more non-dairy cheese than what I've stated.",
      "10. In a preheated oven set at 350 degrees, bake for about 45 minutes. It works best to cover the lasagna with aluminum foil for the first 30 minuts and then bake it uncovered for the last 15 minutes.",
      "11. Another baking option is to bake it at 225 degrees, covered, for about 4 hours. This will allow you to roast extra peppers, tomatos, and garlic for the last two hours of baking time (cut the peppers into large pieces, and the tomatos in half, and peel off some of the skin off the head of garlic and cut the top off. Lay these out in a shallow pan, then sprinkle all three with oil, salt & pepper, onion powder and oregano. Just make sure to cover the garlic with aluminum foil, and bake all three for about 2 hours). It makes an excellent addition to serve with the lasagna.",
      "12. When lasagna is ready, let it sit on the counter for about 5 minutes before cutting. Enjoy."

Remove with a slotted spoon and plunge immediately into the ice bath. Leave in bath for two minutes. Remove and squeeze out the liquid as much as possible with your hand.

Start kneading the dough with the palm of your hands. Once the dough is a cohesive mass, set it aside and scrape up and discard any dried bits of dough. Then lightly flour the board and continue kneading for 10 minutes. 10 minutes is absolutely necessary although it seems like a long time.

      "(This pastry must be used whilst still warm, otherwise it will become brittle and hard to mould. I keep mine in a small pan over gently simmering water.).",
      "Proceed with your recipe, as below.",
      "PIE FILLING.",
      "Place all the pie-filling ingredients in to a large mixing bowl, including the herbs, spices and seasonings. Mix thoroughly with your hands - it's messy, but it's the best way to get everything well amalgamated!",
      "JELLIED STOCK.",
      "Heat the chicken or vegetable stock. Mix the gelatine with a little cold water until it is spongy and smooth, gradually add the hot stock to the gelatine and mix thoroughly. Set aside until it is needed.",

      "Pre-heat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas Mark 3.",

      "Fill the pastry pie case with the pie filling mixture - packing it down well.",
      "Moisten the top edges of the pastry with the beaten egg. Roll out the remaining pastry and cut a circle or oblong to fit the top of the tin. Place over the filling and seal the edges, without pressing the pastry down too heavily. Trim the edges. Make a hole in the top centre of the pie and use any pastry trimmings to make pastry leaves and decorative trimmings. Press these onto the top of the pie and glaze the whole thing with beaten egg.",
      "Now lay a sheet of foil over the top and bake for 2 hours, then remove from the oven. Leave the pie for 30-45 minutes to firm up, then turn up the oven temperature to 190C/375F/Gas Mark 5. Carefully remove the pie from the tin and brush the pastry all over with the remaining beaten egg. If the sides show any sign of bulging, encircle the pie with a band of silicone paper (parchment) and tie with string.",
      "Return the pie to the oven and as the pastry continues baking it will firm up (if you used the paper, you will gradually be able to peel it away, but add a little more egg to the unglazed parts) and all the pastry will brown - it will take approximately 30 minutes. As the top will brown before the sides, it will need to be protected with foil while the sides finish browning.",
      "When the pie is a glowing golden colour, remove from the oven, leave to cool, then cover and chill.",
      "Meanwhile have the jellied stock warmed slightly (by sitting it in a bowl of hot water), then cool it to the syrupy stage and pour it into the pie very gradually through a funnel, in to the centre steam hole (as much as it will take). Chill again to give the jelly a chance to set and then - believe it or not - it's ready to serve!",
      "Serve with assorted fresh salads, pickles, mustard, chutney and relishes. Will pie keep for up to 5 days in a cool place or the fridge.",
      "This freezes very well, defrost overnight, sitting the pie on a wire rack to avoid the pastry becoming soggy.",
      "Wrap the pie for a picnic in greaseproof paper and cut the pie into slices when you arrive at your destination."

      "Starting the night before (or early morning if you want to bake for the evening), in a large mixing bowl use your hands to mix the flour, yeast, salt and enough water to form a soft and sticky dough. You may have to add more water depending on a variety of factors, including the type of flour you use. Do not knead, but cover and let the dough rise at room temperature. When you get up in the morning, or a while before baking in the evening, wet your hands and lift the dough onto a flate, wet surface. Gently stretch it and fold it 2 to 4 times -- that's it. Return it ot the same bowl, cover and let it rise until doubled in size. This will take about an hour or so. If it is cool in the room, put the dough in a warmer area to do this final rise. At this time, find a bowl that will accommodate double the size of the risen dough and line it with a cotton or linen towel dusted with flour. Turn the risen dough (should have doubled by now) out with wet hands and again, fold it over itself about four times. (Personally, I skip this aforementioned step and the bread is wonderful.) Turn into the towel-lined bowl and let rise for one to four hours, depending on the room temperature. Preheat your oven to 425 degrees Farenheit. Once the dough is doubled, turn onto a well-floured peel or stiff cardboard. Ideally you will bake this on a pre-heated pizza stone or heavy baking sheet. Use the peel or cardboard to transfer the dough onto the baking surface. Bake until the crust if golden brown which may take 60 to 75 minutes. The magazine calls for the bread to cool for two hours, bottom up, but you can enjoy it minutes out of the oven."

I added 2/3 cup of water, mixed it up with the ground beef and let it simmer down. would be great with shredded beef or chicken too.it is def hotter than the packaged stuff, so if you don't like hot, would reccommend cutting the red pepper flakes. it is salty too. don't substitute sea salt for table salt. it is not an even swap. I did cut the sea salt down slightly -- I am making a huge batch of this, sealing it in mason jars with my foodsaver and giving as gifts for christmas.Close lid securely, and shake well to mix contents. One half cup is equivalent to 1 (1.25 ounce) package of taco seasoning.",

I added 1 tsp of cornstarch into the mix (you can use 2tsp flour as an equivalent) to help the sauce cling to the meat. Good, but there was still something missing -- and I just didn't know what -- While making this, I searched and found elsewhere that someone listed a beef bullion cube in their recipe. I have the concentrated \"Better than Bullion\" paste, so I added one teaspoon of that to the beef. AAAHH! SOO GOOOD! Whichever taco seasoning recipe you use, try adding the beef bullion or paste. It really ups the meaty flavor! Turns a 3 star into a 5 star! Also, this recipe doesn't mention it, but it's good to add about 1/4 to 1/2 cup of water with the mix after the beef has browned. This lets the seasoning become a clingy sauce and it all mingles happily.",

When the cooking is done and the shortening has cooled somewhat, pour the liquid into a container (metal coffee can, or similar) except for the brown sludge at the bottom (residue from flour, etc,) which is thrown out. Save the shortening, covered, in your refrigerator until next time. Add enough fresh shortening to the kettle to replace the part you threw out. P.S.

Cut wedges through the skin of the citrus fruits, pull the skin off the fruit, and dice it into pieces about 3/8 inch thick-you will have about 21/4 cups of diced peel. (The flesh of the fruit can be used for juice or in salads.) You may also collect and use the peels left over from squeezing oranges or grapefruits in the morning.",
      "Put the diced fruit peel in a saucepan with 6 cups of cold water, bring to a boil, and cook over high heat for about 1 minute, then drain in a colander. Wash the pieces for a few seconds under cold tap water. Rinse the saucepan with cold water, return the diced fruit peel to the pan, and add another 6 cups of water. Repeat the boiling, draining, and washing procedure, and wash the saucepan again. This blanching process removes the bitterness from the peel. Finally, return the diced peel to the saucepan with the sugar and 11/2 cups water, and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium, and boil gently for 15 to 20 minutes, until reduced to a very syrupy liquid.",

Add the orange juice, salt, and flour, and beat for 10 to 20 seconds, just enough to incorporate. Using a spatula, fold in the candied and dried fruits.",
      "Cut a strip of parchment paper long enough to fit the length of a 6-to-8-cup loaf pan and extend 11/2 inches beyond it at either end. (This makes it easy to unmold the cake after baking.) Butter the paper and the mold, bottom and sides, and position the paper in the mold, buttered side up, pressing to make it adhere to the bottom and sides at either end. Pour the batter into the prepared pan, and smooth the top with a spatula.",

To check the lentils, pour them in small batches onto a plate so they are able to spread out. Give them a quick look over, remove any foreign objects, and dump them into a bowl. Repeat until you have checked all of your lentils. Then fill the bowl with cold water and rinse your lentils 2-3 time to remove any dust or bean skins. Throw the lentils into a big soup pot.",

The soup is finished with a liberal addition of red wine vinegar, which adds an important top note to the soup.

To add the additions, the tomatoes, spinach, garlic, and/or bulgur wheat goes in at the same time as the stock. The additional spices go in during the seasoning phase."
