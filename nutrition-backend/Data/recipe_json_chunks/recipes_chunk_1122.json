With your hand, score the meat into 3 equal sections, just eyeball it if you want. Take one section of the meat mixture and shape it into an oval about 1 inch thick. This is the bottom layer of the meat loaf. Place 3 slices of the cheese on top of this loaf making sure that they are not hanging over the edge of the meat loaf. You don't want it to melt and run out. Take the next 1/3 section of meat, place it on top of the cheese layer and mold it to the same size as the bottom layer. Lay the last 3 slices of cheese on this layer contuning to keep the cheese away from the edges. Place the rest of the mixture on the top and shape to the rest of the meat loaf. Smooth the sides of the loaf with a little water on your fingers so that you can't see that it was done in layers, and to make sure the cheese won't ooze out when it melts. It may seem like alot of fuss, but it is WELL worth the little extra effort. Spread the ketcup or chili sauce over the top, then place the bacon strips across the meatloaf sideways instead of the length, covering the entire loaf. Bake for 1 hour, or until it reaches an internal temp of 160. Remove from oven and tent with foil for about 10 minutes to set. When you slice this, you will be able to see the 2 cheese layers. This sets up nicely and will be great for leftover sandwiches -- ."

Spoon the apple filling over half the pastry, leaving a border around the edge. Beat the eggs with 1 teaspoon water for the egg wash. Brush the edges of the pastry lightly with some of the egg wash. Fold the pastry over the filling to form a triangle. Press the edges to seal and enclose the filling completely, then press with the back of a fork to make a tight seal. Using a small knife, cut two 1/2-inch-long slits in the top of the crust. Brush the top with the egg wash.",

      "Sprinkle the turnover with the confectioners' sugar. Turn the oven to broil, and cook until the sugar is caramelized, watching it closely so it doesn't burn. This will give the turnover a browned crust. Carefully run a metal spatula under the turnover to loosen and transfer to a wire rack to cool slightly.",

      "Place the pans in the oven and roast. Do not turn the wedges nor shake the pan. Leave them alone. Roasting time is dependent on your pans. You want a really good deep brown color on the cut edges that are in contact with the pan, at least for many of the wedges. Don't just stop at tan. (okay, several will be tan, some should go mahogany). Start checking after an hour, according to your oven. This may take awhile.",

      "-Bake Your Cakes-.",
      "Preheat your oven to 350. Prep two 5\" round 3\" deep, two 6\" round 3\" deep, and two 7\" round 3\" deep pans by greasing the bottoms and laying down a baking paper circle at the bottom of each.",
      "Combine your dry ingredients (excluding the cocoa powder) in a medium mixing bowl and set aside. You can replace the spices listed with an equal amount of commercial pumpkin spice, or your own signature mix if you're fancy like that.",
      "In a small bowl, combine the pumpkin, vanilla, and cold brew, whisking to combine. Set aside.",
      "Place your room temp butter, eggs, and both kinds of sugar in the bowl of your stand mixer. Using the paddle attachment, cream on medium until lightened in color, fluffy, and totally smooth, about 3-5 minutes. If it looks like the mixture has broken (the fat and liquid ingredients are separated), keep creaming until it all comes together. Scrape your bowl with a spatula to make sure nothing's sticking to the sides.",
      "Add your pumpkin mixture and continue to beat until combined.",
      "Shifting the mixer to low speed, incorporate your dry mixture in two additions making sure to beat just until combined after each. Scrape your bowl and mix for just another few seconds to make sure the batter is homogeneous.",
      "-Create Your Marble Batter-.",
      "Take 4 cups of batter and set in a medium bowl. Mix in the 3 teaspoons orange gel coloring (I used CK Orange) until the batter is a solid color. Pour enough of this batter into each of your two 3\" deep, 5\" round pans that it reaches halfway up the side.",
      "Next take 3 more cups of batter and combine with the 1/4 cup cocoa powder, mixing until totally incorporated.",
      "Place alternating scoops of brown, tan, and remaining orange batter into your remaining four larger cake pans, doing your best to make sure the batter comes up to about halfway up the side of the pan in all four. It's okay if they aren't all exactly even.",
      "Bake your cakes for 35-45 minutes, and remove from the oven when a cake tester or toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Allow to come to room temperature on a cooling rack, then cover with foil and put the cakes in the fridge for about an hour, until cold. To de-pan, remove from the fridge and slide a paring or butter knife around the outside to free the cake. Invert and gently shake out your cake.",
      "-Make Your Buttercream-.",
      "Follow the recipes for two batches of Cold Brew Coffee Buttercream and one batch of Milkmoon Meringue Buttercream.",
      "-Prep Your Base-.",
      "Level the tops of your 6\" and 7\" cakes, and torte (split) each cake into two for a total of eight layers. Keep the smaller 5\" cakes aside.",
      "Stack your cake layers on an 8\" or 9\" round cardboard cake circle or board (it's best if the board or circle is completely flat, so a plate may not work great) starting with the 7\"s then adding the 6\"s, filling the layers with Cold Brew Coffee Buttercream. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour, or until the cake firms up completely.",
      "Trim the caramelization from the sides of your cake, doing your best to emphasize the slight angle from the 6\" round top to the 7\" round base. You're basically making an upside down cup shape.",
      "-Frost the Cake-.",
      "Add a very thin crumb coat of coffee buttercream to the top of the cake, then press a 6\" round acrylic circle or waxed cardboard round onto the top. Cutting the tip off of a disposable piping bag to leave a 1/2 inch circle at the end, pipe your remaining coffee buttercream onto the sides of the cake, leaving space at the top and the bottom for the \"whipped cream\" you'll be adding shortly. Keep the edges of your coffee buttercream wavy and organic, which will look more realistic!",
      "Use a straight edge to smooth the coffee buttercream-I use a tall plastic quilting ruler! Use that acrylic or cardboard round at the top to guide your straight edge, creating a perfectly smooth finish. Refrigerate until firm.",
      "Pipe plain white buttercream at the top and bottom of the cake's sides, leaving little gaps here and there between the white buttercream and coffee buttercream in the top area of the cake. Make another pass with your straight edge, getting your \"whip\" nice and smooth, and flush with the coffee buttercream. Refrigerate until firm.",
      "Mix a few squirts or orange gel into about 1/2 cup white buttercream to create a bright pumpkin-y color. Remove your firmed cake from the fridge and push this orange buttercream into the spaces you left up at the top between the white and the coffee buttercream using a small icing spatula. Refrigerate until firm, then use the icing spatula to scrape down any messy buttercream to reveal clean lines underneath.",
      "-Flip the Cake-.",
      "You heard me. You're going to place your nice cake board or cake plate so it's ready on the counter, pick up your cake, place a hand on either side, and flip it so that the 7\" end is at the top and the 6\" end is at the bottom. Your cake needs to be super thoroughly chilled before you do this step, so definitely make sure it has spent a cumulative 2-3 hours in the fridge! Center the cup-shaped cake on your board (When you're cutting the cake just remember that you have a second board at the very bottom of the cake. You can also remove that board on the 6\" side if you want the cake to go straight onto the final fancy board, but it's a somewhat riskier move when you're flipping the cake).",
      "Carefully pinch the 8 or 9\" round you were using as the base of the cake before you flipped it and gently pull it up, moving around the cake as you pop it up off of the buttercream on the sides. Remove it entirely to reveal your bare cake top.",
      "-Create the Pumpkin Surprise Topping-.",
      "Using a sharp paring knife, carve down the two 5\" orange cakes into domes, one with a knob on the top for the pumpkin's \"stem.\" Using a dab or two of the orange buttercream from earlier, join your cake domes on the flat sides to create a delicious mini-pumpkin!",
      "Smooth a small amount of white buttercream to the top of the flipped cake, and center your mini-pumpkin on the top. Using another disposable piping bag with a 1/2\" hole at the tip, pipe white buttercream over the pumpkin and then smooth with a small icing spatula to create a nice mound that entirely obscures the pumpkin within.",
      "Use the largest closed-star or regular star piping tip you can find to pipe a swirl of white buttercream over the pumpkin surprise to create the \"whipped cream\" topping. You can use a Wilton 2D, although I found a set of even bigger jumbo piping tips online (Jusbe brand) and used their closed star tip to create my cake. Refrigerate for at least 20 minutes to firm up the outside of the buttercream.",
      "In the meantime make a small amount of drizzle by placing your white chocolate or candy wafers and heavy cream in a microwaveable bowl and microwave for 15 seconds at a time, stirring frequently, until the chocolate has dissolved. Mix in a squirt of orange gel coloring to achieve a bright pumpkin color, or you can stir in a little leftover orange buttercream if you have any.",
      "Place the ganache in a squeeze bottle if you have one, or just use a spoon to drizzle it all over the \"whipped cream\" buttercream swirl.",
      "-Finishing Touches-.",
      "This is a bonus step that is optional, but really does tie everything together! Cut out a three-inch circle of green fondant and apply it to the side of the cake. Using a paintbrush dipped in white edible paint (I use Edible Art paint by Sweet Sticks), you can either freehand a pumpkin shape (or your initials, or anything else you want to add!) or you can create a stencil like I did. I used an x-acto knife to cut out my pumpkin design from plain paper, and then stuck it onto the fondant round, painted over it, and peeled it away to leave a fun pumpkin design.",
      "I finished my latte look by cutting a super cute paper straw in half and inserting both pieces into the swirl.",
      "-Cutting the Cake-.",
      "While the outside of this cake is awesome, the best part is what's going on inside! When you cut your slices of cake, you will slowly reveal the pumpkin shape hidden under the swirl on top! Make sure you take a pause once you're halfway through cutting up the cake so everyone can admire the detail you put into the super fun design!",
      "Enjoy!"

      "1. Place a rice paper on a dry, flat surface. Rotate it a bit so you look at it in a diamond shape.",
      "2. Use a pastry brush or simply your fingers to brush egg whites all over the wrapper. This helps soften its texture for easier rolling.",
      "3. Scoop a tablespoon of filling near the bottom of the nearest corner to you. Lift the bottom up and start rolling until it covers up all the filling.",
      "4. Fold over the left side and the right side one after another, towards the center. Remember to pull both sides tightly, but not too tight, because the paper could be torn into small holes (which will make it messy once you bring your rolls to fry).",
      "5. Keep folding it up to the other corner, and carefully tuck the wrapper as you're rolling to keep it tight enough.",
      "6. Once finished, lay it side down and let chill. The seam will seal itself as the egg white wash begins to dry.",
      "STEP 3: Fry.",
      "1. Fill the frying pan with an inch of high-heat cooking oil. Heat the oil to 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C).",
      "2. Gently slide the raw egg rolls in, seam-side down.",
      "Fry each side for 2 minutes and keep turning occasionally until they're golden brown and crispy.",
      "3. Put them out on wire rack or paper towels to drain oil.",
      "STEP 4: Serve.",
      "Serve the rolls onto plate immediately when they're still hot. Occasionally, put on some slices of cucumber and tomato for an appealing display.",
      "NOTE.",
      "- Use only one wrapper for each roll if you desire the best crispiness. The more layers you add, the more chewy they'll get.",
      "- Roll small and tight. Don't stuff in too much filling, and try to spread them evenly according to the wrapper's size. Also, try not to leave spare sections of the wrappers afterwards. This way, either your filling will fall out while frying or your final result will come out just grittily weird.",
      "- You can totally freeze the unfried rolls to preserve them overnight. But once taken out of the fridge, these frozen rolls need to get back on the fry pan right away. Don't let them unfreezed naturally beforehand, because it'll just gross."

    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Wrap the outer bottom and sides of a 9-inch springform pan tightly with 2 pieces of aluminum foil.",
      "Make the crust: Place pecans in the bowl of the food processor and pulse until they form coarse crumbs. Add the butter, sugar and salt to the crumbs and pulse until well blended. Transfer to the bottom of the springform pan and press into an even layer. Place the pan in the center of the oven and bake the crust for 12-15 minutes or until the crust is golden brown. Your kitchen will smell wonderfully of pecans! Set aside to cool.",
      "Make the filling: Place cream cheese in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Beat the cream cheese on medium speed until fluffy, 2-3 minutes. Add the sugar and continue mixing. Reduce the speed to low and add the eggs and egg yolks one by one, mixing to make sure each one is incorporated before adding the next. Scrape down the bowl between additions. Stir in the sour cream. Stir in the flour, cinnamon, ginger and cloves until well blended.",
      "Swirl and bake the cheesecake: Place the springform pan into a roasting pan or large cake pan. Pour about 1/4 of the batter into a medium bowl and stir in the pumpkin. Pour half of the remaining plain batter on top of the crust in the springform pan and spread it out so that it is flat. Spoon all but 1 cup of the pumpkin mixture into the center of the base, leaving a border on the sides so that the filling won't show when the cheesecake is baked. Top the pumpkin layer with the remaining plain batter. Drop spoonfuls of the reserved 1 cup of pumpkin filling on the top of the batter and use a wooden skewer (or toothpick) to swirl the filling. Be creative with your swirl! Lower the oven temperature to 325 degrees F. Place the roasting pans and nested springform pan inside the oven. Carefully pour boiling water into the roasting pan so that it reaches about halfway up the side of the springform pan. Bake the cheesecake for 1 1/2 - 2 hours. It will have risen slightly and the top with be lightly browned. Turn off the oven, open the oven door and leave it ajar. Let the cheesecake cool down slowly in the oven for an additional hour before removing from the pan from the water bath. Refrigerate overnight.",
      "Make the maple glaze: Simmer the maple syrup in a small pot over medium heat until it reduces by about half, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir in the lemon zest, pepper and remaining pecans. It should be syrupy. If not, cook for a few additional minutes. Cool. Top each slice with the glaze."
