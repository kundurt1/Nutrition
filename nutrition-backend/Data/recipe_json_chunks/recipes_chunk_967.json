      "My Note: I says use a large bowl they should have said a tub -- I used three large bowls and then poured it all into a tub to mix the cukes with the salt. I also covered the salted cukes with ice and a loose cover (I think the ice gives the pickles a little more crispness) I made 35 pints in July 2009 and gave them as gifts, as well as ate them, they were a hit. They were too salty after much rinsing so I cut back the salt to about half after the first batch. I started making double the recipe. I mixed them in a large cooler to have enough room to blend everything real well. I added 2 red and 2 orange peppers to the recipe to give it color and just chopped it instead of diced because the peppers are just as good to eat. I put ice on the top while the mix stands so the cukes and peppers get crisp. The cooler helps keep the ice from melting too fast. I packed the pint jars with the cukes then ladled in the brine, this works fine. I put them in a 10 minute 'bath' since I made so many and wanted them to last. I opened the last jar a few weeks ago and it is just as fresh as when I made them last year. I just finished making 45 pints today. They're ready to eat right away. Fantastic pickles! pickle tidbit: when storing pickles, turn them upside down, so that the top pickles are soaking in the brine, since the pickles will rise. Then as you eat them the bottom soaks. I think the recipe should read 25 pickling cukes. Some folks who never made pickles before used regular cukes which were to big and made them come out soggy. One thing I would change is after draining the brine, rinse the vegetable mix and drain again. It was a bit too salty for some. If you make them again, and I will definitely do this."

If you live in an apartment, like I do, where your smoke detector is attached to a central fire system, you will very quickly become well known to all your neighbors, and your local firefighters. In all likelyhood you will also get to meet your landlord. A good, 40,000 BTU to 50,000 BTU barbecue will do a good job of providing sufficient heat. Be sure you have all your doors and windows closed, and invite your neighbors to the barbecue.",

      "All spoons are full mounded measurements, but no higher than salt would form.",
      "It's imperative to keep the pork ice cold (preferably slightly frozen) every step of the way. In old times it was a mid winter process, typically done outdoors or a cold outbuilding. With the advent of refrigeration it can be done anytime if care is taken to maintain a VERY cold product throughout.",
      "Work fast. Get all your equipment, packing implements, measured ingredients and utensils ready before exposing the product to room temperature.",
      "If delayed overnight, (not recommended) immediately place the covered product in the refrigerator and resume your grinding with an occasional few cubes of ice. The ice makes for a wetter finished product but it will prevent the friction of the grinder from warming your product and compromising its freshness.",
      "In essence, there's only one crucial rule when grinding sausage; VERY COLD = VERY FRESH."
