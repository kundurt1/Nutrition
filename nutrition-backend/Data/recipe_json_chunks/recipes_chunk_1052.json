Most recipes using pumpkin puree use 2 cups and somehow there is always a little less after it is frozen.).",

Add just enough very cold water for the dough to hold together, about 1/3 cup, and mix with a fork, just until combined. Do not over mix or use too much water or the crust will be tough.",

      "I also suggest that you keep stirring the mixture to cook it uniformly.",
      "Next, stir in the parsley.",
      "Then gradually stir in the chopped oysters, the oyster liquor, and the turkey pan drippings. Notice I said to gradually stir. The reason for this is that you do not want to reduce the heat, lowering the cooking temperature will cause excessive water to be released from the oysters and you'll have to add too much bread to the finished dish.",
      "Now cook the oysters gently over medium high heat for about 4 minutes, stirring all the while.",
      "And when all the ingredients are well mixed, drop in the poultry seasoning, basil, thyme, seafood seasoning, black pepper and salt. About the salt; taste your raw oysters to see if they are naturally salty before adding the prescribed amount.",
      "You may have to reduce additional salt if nature has provided her own.",
      "At this point, cover the pot, lower the heat, and simmer the mixture for about 5 minutes to allow time for the flavors to marry.",
      "This is one of the secrets to making a really good oyster dressing. Don't rush or skip this step!",
      "After the simmering process is done, remove the pot from the fire and begin adding the bread chunks a few at a time.",
      "Note that you do not have to add all four cups.",
      "If you want your dressing moist, stop adding bread when you get to the texture you desire.",
      "If you want a drier stuffing, add all four cups, even a little more if your taste and needs dictate.",
      "Now taste the dressing again and make your final seasoning adjustments.",
      "The objective is to get the bread to absorb all the pan liquor, thereby binding everything together.",
      "When, in your estimation, the dressing is ready (it shouldn't be soupy, but it shouldn't be dry either), allow it to cool slightly. Then rapidly stir in the raw egg to tie everything together and cover it for a few minutes to let it set up.",
      "This is where the richness comes in and it's how the final blending brings out full flavor.",
      "Oh, and if by chance you've miscalculated and made the mixture a bit too dry, just pour in a little extra turkey drippings.",
      "The only thing left to do is to transfer the dressing right from the Dutch oven to a buttered casserole dish, generously sprinkle the top with the buttered cracker crumbs, drizzle on a little extra melted butter, and bake it for about 25 minutes uncovered in a 375\u00b0F oven.",
      "Fresh bread chunks are better than dried crumbs in your oyster dressing because they tend to cook up fluffy rather than pasty. So to make fresh bread chunks, just take fresh sliced bread or French bread and pull apart small bite-side pieces.",
      "To make your buttered cracker crumb topping, simply drop regular saltine crackers into the processor and, while the blades are spinning, pour in a couple of tablespoons of melted butter."

Slice basil into long strings horizontally. I like to roll several basil leaves together (looks like a green bean) and slice horizontally. Slice red bell pepper and onions into long pieces. Chop cilantro and garlic I like my garlic in slivers but you can dice or chop add all veggies to mixing bowl. You can substitute any veggies you like.",

Put the bottom layer of the cake on a cake stand and sprinkle it with the pineapple juice mixture until it is very moist (not mushy). Add an abundant layer of heavy whipping cream and evenly distribute pineapple chunks on top of it, add a thin layer of cream again. To wet the second cake layer, put it on top of a plate and wet one side. Turn it upside down on top of the cake and wet the other side. Repeat the process of the cream, pineapple chunks and cream.",

      "To roast the red peppers:",
      "Place the red bell peppers directly onto the fire on your gas stove. Or place directly onto your electric burner. Char well for over 15 minutes on all sides. You are looking for a very black exterior. Pop the peppers into a bowl and cover tightly with plastic wrap to seal in the heat and sweat. In 10 minutes you can peel off the charred skin. If you want you can do this under running cold water, which makes it a little easier. Cut in wide slices and set aside.",
      "Peel and finely dice the onion. Slice the sausage into 1/2-inch pieces.",
      "To fabricate the Cornish game hen:",
      "Remove the carcass from your hen beginning at top of bird along either side of breast bone. Using a sharp knife, work your way down each side of carcass trying to remove as much meat from the bone as possible, to make 2 halves. Leave in the leg and wing bones, but discard the carcass (or save for stock). Then cut the leg and wing pieces off from the breast pieces.",
      "To clean the shrimp:",
      "Start by holding the shrimp, backside up, and run your knife down the length of its spine. This will expose the vein. To remove the vein you can use your finger, or the tip of your knife to pull it out of the shrimp.",
      "To clean the mussels:",
      "Scrub the mussels removing any sand and seaweed bits. If mussels are open, test them by pressing the two shells together. If they start to close, then they are still alive and safe to use. If not, discard them.",
      "To clean the squid:",
      "Grab the head, while holding the end and PULL. Most of the guts will come out in one neat pile. You need to remove the transparent spine (or quill) by running a finger along the inside of the mantle holding it by the tip and pulling. Check the base in case there is a bit of spine left and that can be removed as well. Remove the wings by pulling off and then peel the rest of the skin off, which should come off in one piece. Slice the squid body open, score it on the diagonal (making a shallow incision but not cutting all the way through). Then cut this squid piece into flat triangles, or if you prefer simply cut the squid body into rings.",
      "In a large skillet turn a large pan on high heat and drizzle in the oil. Add the hen pieces to the hot pan and sear and brown on all sides, about 8 to 10 minutes. Take the pieces out of the pan and set aside. Add the chorizo or other sausage to the pan. Stir until browned, about 3 to 4 minutes. Leave there. In the same pan, continue to build the dish by adding the onions, and saute until golden. Add the turmeric, and smoked paprika, and then add the garlic. Add the wild rice, and stir to coat with all the flavors and allow the grains to toast slightly.",
      "Return the seared hen pieces to the pan. Add your warm chicken stock to which you have added the saffron. Reserve about a cup of stock for later. Cover the pan with a lid or tin foil, and let cook, about 40 minutes.",
      "Finish by adding the seafood (shrimp, mussels, squid), and the last cup of stock just before the last 10 minutes. Just before serving, add the peas and the reserved roasted red peppers. Cover for a minute and the residual heat will warm both.",
      "Ladle up into two personal paella pans."
