    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Toss squash cubes with oil, and spread in a single layer on a baking sheet; season with salt. Bake until tender and caramelized, about 20 minutes, stirring once halfway through. Remove the squash from the oven to cool, and reduce the oven temperature to 375 degrees. While the squash is roasting, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil, and cook pasta as directed; drain well and set aside.",
      "Meanwhile, in a medium pan over medium-high heat, cook bacon until crispy. Remove using a slotted spoon and set aside to drain on paper towel. Pour out all but 1-2 tablespoons of fat - enough to coat the bottom of the pan. Add onions, sprinkle with sugar, and cook over medium-high heat until tender and deeply caramelized, stirring occasionally (about 20 minutes). Stir in balsamic vinegar; set aside.",
      "Make the sauce. While onions are caramelizing, melt butter in separate medium saucepan over medium heat, cooking until butter smells fragrantly nutty and is a warm brown color. Be careful not to burn the butter - burned brown butter tastes pretty terrible. Whisk in flour and cook 2 minutes. Very slowly pour in milk, whisking constantly. Cook over medium-low heat until sauce thickens, about 8 to 10 minutes. Season with salt, pepper and nutmeg.",
      "In a very large bowl, toss the pasta with the sauce, roasted squash, bacon, caramelized onions, goat cheese and chopped sage leaves. Transfer to a large baking dish (I used a 13 x 9 inch Pyrex dish), and sprinkle with the breadcrumbs. Bake at 375 degrees until edges are crispy and breadcrumbs are golden brown, about 20 minutes. Let sit a few minutes, then serve. Creamy pasta dishes like this pair nicely with a lightly-dressed green salad."

      "You can make this bread dough in a number of different ways. The simplest, by far, is in a food processor using the plastic dough blade. Pour the warm water into the processor and sprinkle the yeast and sugar on top. Put the lid on the processor and pulse for a split second, just to wet the yeast. Add 1 cup of the flour, process for 10 seconds, and let rest for 10 minutes. This gets the yeast going, lets the flour start to absorb the liquid, and is a good time to do the breakfast dishes.",
      "Add the remaining flour, between 1 1/4 and 1 3/4 cups, and process for 1 minute. You'll need about 1 1/4 cups in the winter, 1 1/3 cups in the summer, and 1 1/2 cups in the spring or fall; because flour absorbs moisture from the air, and the air is moister in summer than winter, the amount of flour you'll need in your bread recipes will be less in winter, more in summer. You're trying to attain a very slack dough, one which will barely form a rough ball in the food processor.",
      "Remove the dough from the food processor bowl, place it in a large, lightly greased bowl, and cover with lightly greased plastic wrap. Set aside and go on about your work.",
      "You can also make this dough in a mixer, such as a Kitchen Aid, or even a smaller stand mixer, using either a dough hook or dough \"beaters.\" Follow the same procedure outlined above.",
      "Guess what? You can even do this in your bread machine. Simply put all the ingredients in at once, let the machine go through its first knead (25 minutes or so), then take the dough out of the machine and put it into a lightly greased bowl. Reset (turn off) the machine.",
      "Finally you can do this with - gulp! - your hands. Combine the ingredients with a spoon, then knead it with my hands in the bowl for 1 minute.",
      "Ten or 12 hours later, or when you get back to it, take the dough out of the bowl and make it into whatever you want. You'll have enough dough to make eight rolls, eight chewy, substantial breadsticks, one Italian-style loaf or baguette, one round loaf, or a 12-inch focaccia. I usually opt for the focaccia, drizzling it with olive oil, then sprinkling it with a healthy amount of black pepper, a bit of salt, and some rosemary.",
      "Let the dough rise again, for an hour or so, until whatever you've shaped is good and puffy. Preheat the oven to 450F about half an hour before you want to bake the bread.",
      "Bake the bread for 15 to 20 minutes, misting the inside of the oven with cold water from a clean plant mister three or four times during the first 5 to 8 minutes of baking, if you're after a very crisp crust. Remove the bread from the oven when it's golden brown, and cool it on a wire rack or bring it to the table and eat it immediately"

Don't wait for the chocolate to \"look\" melted. Even when it looks like the chips haven't melted, try stirring, and see what happens. Usually after you start stirring will the chocolate appear like it melted.",
      "Pour about half of melted chocolate into prepared pan. Smooth it the best you can. Usually a spatula helps! Stick the pan in the freezer for 15 minutes to let the chocolate harden.",

The marshmallows may swell and start to expand over the bowl. So keep a close eye on the bowl in case you have to momentarily stop the heat. Once that is done, stir the mixture and heat it back in the microwave for another 45 seconds. Stir the mixture until it is completely smooth.",

Set that aside as you get your 2 cans of dough. With each one, unroll the dough into a large rectangle. I usually just place it right on a cookie sheet. Proceed to slice the dough into 3 rows one way, and 8 rows another way. This will make 48 pieces of dough total. Take each piece and roll it into a ball.",

While the machine is running, add the ice water and process, pulsing the machine on and off, for a few seconds longer or until the dough comes together.

      "For the caper sauce: In a small pan, heat butter; add garlic, lemon zest, lemon juice and capers. Stirring continuously, simmer over low heat for 30 seconds and add the parsley. Remove from heat.",
      "For the steaks: Take your steak out of the refrigerator an hour before you want to start cooking it. It is always best to cook meat from or near room temperature. This will help the meat cook consistently across the interior by reducing the amount of time that it takes to cook the meat. If your meat needs to be trimmed or cut into smaller pieces, do that now. I chose to leave my steaks the way they are.",
      "It is best to not go too crazy choosing the seasoning for your rib eye. This cut of beef is very tender, and it would best to keep the seasoning limited to the following: good sea salt, fresh cracked black pepper, and a little high-temperature oil. Rub the steaks with salt and pepper first, followed by a thin layer of the oil.",
      "Heat up a heavy-bottomed frying pan on medium heat. Melt a tablespoon of butter in the pan and wait until the butter foam subsides before laying your steak down in the very center of the pan. Don't cover the pan or move the steak for at least 4 minutes. When you begin to see the sides of the steak getting brown, pick up the steak and look at the bottom. If it is dark brown, flip it over.",
      "The second side will take another five minutes to brown. The steak to the right was 11/2 inches thick and needed 4 minutes more per side before it was medium rare. So, depending on how thick your steaks are, you may need to cook them longer. Use a digital thermometer to test the internal temperature of the steaks. For rare meat, 120-125 degrees F, medium is 140-150 degrees, and well done is around 160-170 degrees.",
      "Pour the caper sauce over the steak and serve. Perhaps with thick cut chip and peas?"

      "Special Equipment: 9-in/23-cm x 5-in/12.5-cm loaf pan; 9-in/23-cm x 13 in/33-cm x 2-in/5-cm pan; spatula; pastry brush; fine mesh strainer; aluminum foil; thermometer; wire baking rack; paring knife",
      "Position one oven rack in the center of the oven. Preheat the oven to 325\u00b0F/165\u00b0C/gas 3. Place a 9-in/23-cm x 5-in/12.5-cm loaf pan in the oven to heat. (A preheated loaf pan helps spread the caramel).",
      "Make the caramel: In a small saucepan add the sugar and 1/4 cup of water. Set the pan on a stove set to medium-low heat and cook, stirring gently with a spatula until the sugar crystals dissolve. Once the sugar crystals have dissolved, stop stirring. Brush the sides of the pan using a pastry brush dipped in water to prevent crystallization. Bring to a boil, then continue to cook until the caramel is a deep amber color, another 10-12 minutes. Swirl the pan as needed to make sure the caramel is cooked evenly.",
      "Remove the pan from the heat, hold it over your kitchen sink, and drizzle in the Tablespoon of hot water, swirling the pan to incorporate (careful, it will spatter). Remove the warmed loaf pan from the oven and pour the caramel into the dish (do not scrape the pan). Make sure the base is evenly coated. Set aside to cool.",
      "Bring 2 quarts/64 fl oz/2 liters of water to a boil. Prepare the 9-in/23-cm x 13 in/33-cm x 2-in/5-cm pan by lining it with 4 layers of paper towels. Set aside.",
      "Make the custard: In a medium mixing bowl add the eggs and egg yolks. Fit the KitchenAid(R) 7-Speed Hand Mixer with the whisk attachment. Place the whisk into the bowl and turn to speed 2. Mix until just combined. Turn off the mixer.",
      "Add the sweetened condensed milk, heavy whipping cream, whole milk, vanilla seeds (you can save the other 1/2 of the pod for another use), and salt. Place the whisk into the mixture and turn to speed 2. Mix until combined, about 30 seconds. Turn off the mixer. TIPS: To scrape a vanilla bean, put the bean on a cutting surface. Using a paring knife, cut the bean in half (save the other half for another recipe). Using the tip of the paring knife, cut the bean lengthwise. Use the point, or edge of the knife to scrape the seeds loose from the pod; do this on both sides of the split bean. Place the paste into the bowl when ready to use. The vanilla pod can be reserved to be used in another recipe.",
      "Strain the custard through a fine-mesh strainer into the loaf pan. Cover the top of the loaf pan tightly with aluminum foil, place it into the center of the prepared 9x13-in pan, then put into the oven. Carefully pour the boiling water into the 9x13-in pan so that it reaches 1-in up the sides of the loaf pan. (This is the water bath.) Bake until the center of the custard slightly jiggles when shaken and the custard reaches 180\u00b0F/82\u00b0C, 50 minutes, about 1 hour 30 minutes.",
      "Remove the pan from the oven and set on a wire baking rack. Remove the foil, and let the custard cool in the water bath until it reaches room temperature, about 1 hour. Remove the loaf pan from the water bath, wrap with plastic wrap, and place in the fridge overnight, or for up to two days before serving.",
      "To remove the flan, run a paring knife around the edge of the pan. Place a serving dish with a raised rim over the top of the pan and gently, but quickly, turn it over and remove the loaf pan. Using a spatula, scrape any leftover caramel onto the flan. Note: if the caramel doesn't release, you can set the pan in a pot of hot water for 10 minutes to help loosen it).",
      "To serve, cut the flan into squares, plate, and spoon extra caramel sauce over the individual slices.",
      "Tips: Leftover flan can be kept in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 4 days.",
      "Mix It Up: Change up the flavor profile of your flan! We offer flavor variations below:",
      "Coffee Flan - 3 1/2 tsp instant espresso powder. Add the espresso powder in with the custard.",

If you want the rice on the inside of the roll, simply do not flip, leaving the rice side facing up. Next, lay on a thin row of the spicy tuna and then top with some thin avocado slices (omit the avocado if you'd prefer just tuna). Then, using the bamboo mat on the end closest to you, roll from the bottom up and over the ingredients (like you're rolling a sleeping bag), pressing down gently but firmly to make the fillings stay in. As you continue to roll, pull the mat up and straighten it so that it doesn't get caught in the roll. Continue until you have completed the roll and squeeze together gently again one last time to ensure that the roll is secure. Repeat this process until all of your rolls are finished.

Return to the heat and heat for 2 minutes. Remove from the heat and place in the bowl of a stand mixer. Allow to cool for at least 10 minutes. You may run the whisk attachment to help the mixture to cool. Do not add the eggs while it is still very hot or the eggs will cook and this won't turn out right.",

Once the batter is done whisking, transfer to a piping bag fitted with a 1/2 inch plain tip. Pipe into circles the size of a quarter on the parchment paper. Leave some space between for rising. Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. Remove from the oven (this is a VERY important part) and pierce each cream puff with a toothpick or skewer so that the steam can escape from inside. Put the cream puffs back in the oven and allow to bake for another 4-5 minutes. Turn the oven off and open the door. Allow the cream puffs to sit in the oven until cooled.",
