I looked at other chicken rice soup recipes, got some ideas, but they just weren't quite what I was looking for. So I took some of this and a bit of that and made one of the best soups I've ever tasted. After supper, I sat down and tried to write it down before I forgot, because I definitely want to make it again.",

(If using chicken breast, cool and cut into bite size pieces).",

When the mixture coats the back of a spoon, in about 5-7 minutes, it is done.

You could also use a blow torch (like the one you use for creme brulee) to cook the meringue instead of using the oven.",

    "ingredients": [],

      "You will also need:",
      "1. A double boiler or a homemade one using a pot and a heatproof bowl that will fit comfortably inside the rim of the pot without moving around or touching the bottom. Add water to the pot so that it almost reaches the bottom of the bowl.",
      "2. A whisk.",
      "3. One or two jars with lids for storing the curd in the refrigerator",
      "4. A tart pan with a removable bottom: the photographed tart was baked in a pan measuring 11-inches across the top and 1-inch deep.",
      "5. A blender or food processor.",
      "6. A measuring cup or bowl with a flat bottom to provide a stable base for the tart as you slip the ring of the pan down off of the baked crust.",
      "7. An icing spatula or knife with a long blade to loosen the crust from the base of the tart pan.",
      "8. A cooling rack.",
      "9. A piece of parchment paper, placed on the cooling rack (to prevent the crust from sticking to the rack).",
      "For the lemon curd (makes about 1 and 1/2 cups):",
      "Prepare ahead because the curd must be well-chilled before putting it into the crust.",
      "1. Crack the eggs into a bowl, beat them well, and set them aside.",
      "2. Put the lemon juice, zest, sugar and butter in the top of the double boiler. Bring the water in the bottom of the double boiler to a simmer and heat the mixture, whisking it now and again, until the sugar dissolves and the butter melts.",
      "3. Whisking continuously, pour in the eggs, and cook the mixture over the simmering water without letting it boil. Make sure to whisk continuously.",
      "4. Continue stirring and cooking the curd. Steam will begin rising from the curd, and little bubbles will form on the surface. At first the curd will leave only a film on a spoon. It will taste and look thin. Gradually, you will see a change in its consistency as you continue to stir and cook it. When the curd thickens and forms an opaque coating on the spoon and its color deepens, it is done.",
      "5. Remove the curd from the heat and put it in one or a couple of jars. Wait until it cools to cap it, then refrigerate the curd. If you erred on the side of caution and cooked the curd a little less than the optimum, it will thicken more after being refrigerated. It should be well chilled before putting it into the tart shell. The curd will keep for several weeks at least, stored in the refrigerator. It is very good on bread or scones as well as in a tart.",
      "For the coconut crust (for an 11-inch Tart) and assembly:",
      "1. Preheat the oven to 325 F. Grease the tart pan very well with the softened butter. With your fingers, run butter vertically up into the ridges of the sides of the pan.",
      "2. Put the coconut and the sugar in the blender or processor and mix until the coconut is finely chopped.",
      "3. Blend in the egg whites and vanilla.",
      "4. Test the consistency of the crust mixture. Put a handful of it on a large spoon or on a saucer. The crust mixture should hold its shape. It should look and feel like it holds together loosely. If it doesn't, add some more coconut, process the mixture again briefly, and check the consistency again.",
      "5. Press the crust into the tart pan. (The crust is thick.)",
      "6. Put the tart shell in the preheated 325 F oven. After 20 minutes, remove the crust from the oven and press on the sides and bottom of it with a spoon to define the crust better ... Then, return it to the oven for another 20 minutes, or until it has turned a golden brown.",
      "7. When the tart shell is done, remove it from the oven and place it on a stable base (such as a large, flat-bottomed measuring cup or bowl turned upside down) and slide the metal ring of the tart pan down from the sides of the crust. Run the icing spatula or knife under the crust to loosen it from the bottom of the pan and ...",
      "8. Slide the crust onto the parchment paper that you have on top of the cooling rack. Cool the tart shell and fill it with the cold lemon curd when ready to serve.",
      "9. Circle the tart with rounds of sliced kiwi if you use them",
      "Note: If you find that your lemon curd it still on the thin side after it has been refrigerated, there is a remedy. Do not fill the tart shell. Instead, cut the coconut crust into wedges, place one on each plate, and spoon the curd onto each piece of crust. Decorate the desserts with kiwi slices ... and all turns out well.",

Add your bay leaves, cooked beef and 2 quarts of stock (this may seem like a lot of liquid but you're going to need more than this because the rice sucks up so much). As you are adding the liquid, make sure to scrape all the brown yumminess from the bottom of the pot. You can add some salt and pepper now, but I would wait until halfway through for the salt because some stocks are salty. Raise your heat to high just until you bring it to a bubble, then lower to medium and allow it to simmer for 1 hour.",

The reason for this is you are about to add 2 starches that will suck up that flavor. So if your soup tastes just lovely to you, add 1/2 teaspoon of salt to start. Now, add your carrots, potatoes and tomatoes (at this point, add the barley if you are using it instead of rice, and continue as written). Stir through, bring back to a simmer and wander away for another 1/2 hour.",
      "Back again! Your soup has been cooking for 1 1/2 hours now. Give it another taste. If the broth tastes perfect, then add another 1/2 teaspoon of salt. If it is still slightly salty, leave it be. I like adding a good teaspoon of ground pepper at this point. It really gives the soup a nice warmth. Add your rice (if using), corn, and remaining 2 cups of broth.",
      "Now over the next 1/2 hour, keep an eye on your soup. That rice is going to drink the broth, so have more stock on hand. Or if you run out of stock, you can use water (if you use water, just remember you'll need to let it reduce down and re-develop flavor). I did end up adding another couple cups of stock and could probably have added more. Let it simmer until the rice (or barley) is cooked (use your rice/barley package timing as a guideline). Check it after 1/2 hour. Adjust your seasonings and serve!"

    "title": "og\u00f3rkowa (polish dill pickle soup)",
    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "Peel and finely dice the onion. Heat the oil and butter in a stockpot over medium heat and add the onions. Cook until translucent, about 4 or 5 minutes. Add water, broth, pickle juice and turn heat to high and bring to a boil.",
      "While the liquid is heating up, peel and roughly dice potatoes, shred the pickles, peel and finely dice the carrot, finely slice the celery. Once liquid is boiling, add the vegetables, pickles, salt, and pepper. Cook until the potatoes are tender, about 15 minutes.",
      "While the vegetables are cooking, whisk together the sour cream and the flour in a bowl. Scoop about 1/2 cup of the liquid from the stockpot and pour it slowly into the sour cream while you whisk. Repeat this 2 more times to temper the cream so it doesn't curdle when you add it to the soup. When the potatoes are tender, reduce heat to medium and add the sour cream mixture to the stockpot and stir until you have a nice creamy soup. Cook about 5 minutes to thicken the soup and heat it through.",
      "Serve immediately. It is traditional to garnish with a dollop of sour cream and a sprinkling of fresh chopped dill and serve with plenty of crusty rye bread.",
      "Notes:",
      "This soup can also be pureed like a potato leek soup if you prefer. To do that I would leave out the carrot and the celery. Once the potatoes are cooked through, cool the soup in small batches over an ice bath. Once cool, run each batch through the blender and return to the pot to be heated up again.",
      "You can control how sour the soup is by adding or reducing the amount of pickle juice and pickles you add. Also, if you want to make this more of a main course, you can always add torn kale leaves and diced kielbasa during the last half of the cooking time."

      "Prepare the chocolate ganache first, so it has time to set and thicken. Place the chocolate in a medium-sized heatproof bowl. Set aside. In a small pan over medium-high heat, bring the cream to a boil. Remove cream from heat and pour cream over the chocolate pieces. Stir until the chocolate is completely melted and the mixture is smooth and glossy. Add the vanilla and stir again. Let it cool to room temperature. It will be very thick. If it is not thick and set when you're ready to pipe it onto the cupcakes, set the bowl in the refrigerator for a bit, checking every 10 minutes or so.",
      "For the cupcakes:",
      "Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F. Spray three 12-count regular size cupcake tins generously with non-stick spray. Set aside.",
      "Microwave chocolate and water in a large microwave-safe bowl for 1-1/2 to 2 minutes, or until chocolate is almost melted, stirring after 1 minute. Stir until chocolate is completely melted.",
      "Beat egg whites in a small bowl with a mixer on high speed until stiff peaks form. Set aside. Reserve the yolks.",
      "In a separate bowl, mix flour, baking soda and salt. Set aside.",
      "In a large bowl, beat butter and sugar with mixer until light and fluffy. Add egg yolks, 1 at a time, beating well after each. Blend in the melted chocolate and the vanilla. Add flour mixture alternately with buttermilk, beating until well blended after each addition. Add egg whites and stir gently until well blended.",
      "VERY IMPORTANT: Fill individual cupcake cavities only slightly more than half full. The batter puffs up during baking and then settles back down. If the cavities are too full, the batter leaks out over the rim of the cupcake cavity. It's a big mess!! When all cavities are half-full with batter, rap the pan gently a few times on the counter to settle any air pockets.",
      "Bake for about 17 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in centers comes out clean. VERY IMPORTANT: Let cupcakes cool in the pan for 15 minutes before removing to wire rack to cool completely. The cake is very tender ... handle with care.",
      "For the coconut-pecan frosting:",
      "Beat egg yolks, evaporated milk and vanilla in a large saucepan with a wire whisk until well blended. Add sugar and butter and cook on medium heat for 12 minutes, or until thickened and golden brown, stirring constantly. Remove from heat. Add coconut and pecans. Mix well. Set the frosting in the refrigerator, stirring periodically. Chill until the frosting has a bit of stiffness to it before assembling the cupcakes.",
      "To assemble the cupcakes:",
      "With a thin serrated knife, carefully slice the cupcakes in half horizontally. Spoon a bit of frosting onto the bottom layer and spread it out to the edge of the cake. Place its top on and then spread more frosting onto the top.",
      "Place the chocolate ganache in a piping bag fit with a medium star tip and swirl a bit onto the top of the frosting. Finish by pressing a whole pecan into the ganache.",
      "The cake itself is rather delicate, and the coconut-pecan frosting rather gooey. I found it best to refrigerate the cupcakes once assembled, to help stabilize them. Then take them out of the refrigerator 20 minutes prior to serving.",
      "Source: Cake and coconut-pecan frosting adapted slightly from the recipe on the Baker's German's Sweet Chocolate wrapping. And this is the only German Chocolate Cake recipe my mom has ever made!"

      "First, be sure to buy a plain rotisserie chicken. Check the packaging. Don't be like me and accidentally pick up a BBQ seasoned chicken, and have to go back to the store for the one you actually wanted.",
      "Place the rotisserie chicken in a large heavy-bottomed pot and pour in the carton of chicken broth. Cover the pot and simmer until the chicken is thoroughly heated and begins to fall apart (approximately 30 minutes, since the rotisserie chicken is already cooked).",
      "Using a slotted spoon, remove the chicken from the broth, set it on a cutting board and allow it to cool some (until you can chop it without burning yourself). Strain the chicken broth to remove any kibbles and bits and return it to the pot. If needed, add a cup or two of water to create more broth. (This may be necessary if your broth simmers too long and/or reduces too quickly.)",
      "Over medium heat, bring the broth back to a simmer. Add the onion, garlic, tomatoes (juice and all) and the seasonings. If you like a little spice, throw in that pinch of red pepper flakes.",
      "While that simmers, de-bone the chicken and chop it into bite-size pieces. If you're feeding a crowd, use all of the chopped chicken. If you're not, use half the chicken and save the rest for chicken salad tomorrow night. Return the chopped chicken to the pot. Add the spinach and tortellini. Simmer for an additional 15 minutes. Taste to see if it needs additional salt and pepper. I also like to taste one of the tortellini to make sure they're done. If you like your soup on the thicker side, combine 1 tablespoon of cornstarch with 2 tablespoons of water and whisk until smooth; then stir it into the soup.",
      "To serve, spoon into bowls and top with chopped parsley and grated parmesan cheese. A great loaf of crusty bread is the perfect side to this soup.",
      "Substitutions:",
      "- This soup can be made with beef broth and ground beef.",
      "- You can use cheese, spinach, or meat tortellini-your choice.",
      "- Mini-ravioli can be substituted for the tortellini.",
      "- The tomatoes can be omitted for a clear broth (great for colds).",
      "- Substitute the pasta of your choosing for the tortellini.",
      "- Substitute browned Italian sausage for chicken or beef.",
      "- Use fresh spinach, kale or other favorite greens instead of frozen."

Bake brownies until slightly puffed and dry-looking and tester inserted into center comes out with some moist batter attached, about 20 minutes. Let cool completely in pan on rack.",
      "For the fresh raspberry buttercream:",
      "Cook the raspberries in a medium saucepan over medium heat, stirring frequently until the raspberries are broken down into a sauce. Pour the sauce through a fine mesh strainer to remove the seeds, and then pour the raspberry sauce back in the pot. Simmer until the sauce reduces to a 1/4 cup. It will be a very rich red and concentrated sauce. Set aside to cool.",
      "With a mixer, cream the butter with a paddle attachment on medium high speed about 2 minutes, until lightened in color and a bit fluffy. Add 2 cups of powdered sugar, the 1/4 cup of cooled raspberry sauce, lemon juice, and salt. Mix until smooth. Add the remaining 1-1/2 cups of powdered sugar and mix until smooth. If you want the frosting less stiff, add some milk, 1 tablespoon at a time. I did not add any milk to mine, and thought it was perfect for piping. Fit a pastry bag with a medium-large round tip (I used a Wilton #12) and fill with fresh raspberry buttercream.",
      "To assemble the brownie hearts:",
      "Run a knife around the inside edge of the brownie pan. Use the overhanging foil as an aid and gently lift the brownies from the pan. The pan I used produces a brownie that is 1/2\" thick. Be sure your cookie cutter is taller than 1/2\". Press heart-shaped cookie cutters (the cookie cutters used in my photos measure 3\" wide and 1-1/2\" wide) firmly into the cooled brownie. Use a thin metal spatula to lift the cookie cutter filled with brownie from the foil. Gently press the brownie out of the cookie cutter. Repeat the cutting process until your brownie looks like a big piece of Swiss cheese. (And I hope you're eating up some of those brownie scraps!)",
      "With the pastry bag filled with fresh raspberry buttercream, pipe a line of frosting around the inside edge of one of the brownie hearts. Then fill in the inside of the line with frosting, too. Top with another brownie heart, very gently pressing down to make a sandwich. Repeat until all your brownie hearts are completed. To finish off, sprinkle the brownie hearts with powdered sugar. I like to fill a small hand sieve with powdered sugar and gently tap the side of the sieve to let the powdered sugar rain down."

Place 1 tablespoon of the mixture into the bottom of each prepared muffin cup, and use the bottom of a small glass to pack the crumbs, then sprinkle about 1 1/2 teaspoons of the white chocolate over the graham cracker crust. Add the remaining chocolate to the reserved graham cracker mixture and set aside.",
      "3. Bake the graham cracker crusts for about 5 minutes, or until the edges of the graham cracker mixture are golden.",
      "4. For the cupcakes, add the butter and sugar to the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and beat on medium-high speed until light and fluffy. Add the eggs, one at a time, mixing until incorporated. Make sure to scrape down the sides of the bowl after each addition.",
      "5. In a medium mixing bowl, whisk together the cake flour, baking powder and salt. In a separate bowl, combine the buttermilk, vanilla extract, lime juice, and lime zest in a bowl. With the mixer on low speed, add the flour mixture to the butter mixture in 3 batches, alternating with the buttermilk mixture, ending with flour, beating until each addition is just combined. Scrape down the sides of the bowl and mix for 15 seconds longer.",
      "6. Pour the batter into the cupcake liners, filling each cup to about a quarter inch from the top. Sprinkle the remaining graham cracker/white chocolate mixture over each cup, concentrating around the edges (since you'll be cutting out the center for the filling). Bake the cupcakes, rotating pans halfway through, until the tops are firm and a cake tester inserted in the center comes out clean, 18 to 20 minutes. Transfer the tins to a wire rack and let the cupcakes cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then remove them and let cool completely.",
      "For the lime curd:",
      "1. In a small saucepan whisk together the egg yolks, egg, sugar, lime juice, butter, and salt and cook over moderately low heat. Stir constantly until the mixture is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, about 7-10 minutes, making sure not to let it boil or sit long enough to curdle. Strain the curd through a fine mesh strainer and set aside to cool.",
      "2. Once cooled, using a pairing knife inserted at an angle, cut out a small cone-shaped chunk, about a 1-inch circle from the top of each cupcake. Fill the hole with about 1 teaspoon lime curd. You can either replace the chunk you removed, or leave it off.",
      "For the buttercream:",
      "1. In the bowl for your electric mixer (or a medium heatproof bowl if you're using a hand mixer), combine the egg whites and sugar, and place the bowl over a small pot of gently simmering water. Whisk the mixture constantly until the sugar has fully dissolved, about 2-3 minutes. Rub a little between your fingers, and if there is no hint of a grainy texture, it's done (or when it reaches 160 degrees in temperature).",
      "2. Place the bowl in your mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, and at high speed, beat the egg mixture until stiff peaks form. Continue beating until the eggs are fluffy and the mixture has cooled, about 5-6 minutes. Make sure the stiff peaks don't become dry, you want them to stay glossy.",
      "3. Switch to the paddle attachment and with the mixer on medium-low speed, add the butter 2 tablespoons at a time, waiting until it is fully incorporated into the mixture before adding the next addition. If the buttercream begins to separate, turn the mixer up to medium-high speed and beat for a few minutes, until it is smooth again. Add the vanilla, salt, and lime juice, and beat until incorporated. Again, if the mixture separates or thins out too much, beat on medium-high speed until it is light and fluffy again. Reduce the mixer speed to low and beat for 2 minutes to eliminate any air bubbles.",
      "4. Using a pastry bag or a Ziploc with the corner cut off, frost each cupcake. For the garnish, in a small bowl, combine the graham cracker crumbs and lime zest, and lightly dust each cupcake with just a pinch of the mixture.",
      "Note: You'll need a 1-pound bag of key limes, zested and juiced, for this recipe. Don't have key limes? Regular limes will work fine too."

      "Mix the eggs with the water, add the salt and pepper to taste. Heat an omelette pan (that has 7\" diameter at the bottom) over medium high heat and place in the butter. Coat the entire pan with the butter including up the sides. When the foam has subsided and just before the butter starts to turn brown, pour in the eggs. Let the eggs set in the pan for 2-3 seconds then give them a shake. Now grasp the handle of the pan with both hands, thumbs on top, and immediately begin jerking the pan vigorously and roughly toward you at an even, 20 degree angle over the heat, one jerk per second. Keep doing this so that the egg releases itself from the bottom of the pan. After several jerks the eggs will begin to thicken. Very quickly add the Brie cheese and the tarragon. Then increase the angle of the pan slightly which will force the egg mass to roll over on itself with each jerk at the far lip of the pan. As soon as the omelette has shaped, hold it in the angle of the pan to brown slightly. Do not overcook, this whole process should take only 20-30 seconds! Julia has named this \"dinner in half a minute.\" The center of the omelette should remain soft and creamy.",
      "Plating of this omelette is just as important as the rest of the technique. Hold the plate in your left hand. Turn the omelette pan so its handle is to your right. Grasp the handle with your right hand, thumbs on top. Rest the lip of the pan slightly off the center of the plate so that the omelette will land in the center. Then tilt the pan and plate against each other at a 45-degree angle and plate the omelette. Garnish with the parsley and serve immediately.",
