      "Make some slits in the bamboo shoots lengthwise and peel off about 3 outer leaves so that the bamboo shoots will cook through better.",
      "The photo here shows bamboo shoots that have already been boiled.",
      "Put the prepared bamboo shoots in a large pot, and add lots of water (or the white water from that rice has been washed in).",
      "Add the rice bran (or uncooked rice), mix it up quickly and cover with a lid.",
      "Start heating the pot.",
      "Rice bran is preferred over rice grains.",
      "If the bamboo shoots you bought didn't come with a packet of rice brain, you can use uncooked rice + rinsing water instead.",
      "Some people also add red chili peppers to the boiling water.",
      "This is to kill off any bacteria and to lessen the tannic flavor that's in bamboo shoots.",
      "I don't use chili peppers though since it also leaves a hot/spicy flavor on the bamboo shoots.",
      "If the bamboo shoots you have are too big or you have a lot them, don't hesitate to just peel them all and cut them into 2-4 pieces each!",
      "Fresh uncooked bamboo shoots have very tough outer leaves or skins.",

      "The soft inner skin (called himekawa or \"princess skin\") can be used in simmered dishes and so on.",
      "The advantage to cooking bamboo shoots in their skins is that the flavor and fragrance are less likely to leech out.",
      "Plus, a substance in the skins helps to bleach and tenderize the bamboo shoots.",
      "Your pots may still be too small to handle whole unpeeled bamboo shoots though.",
      "This is pretty common.",
      "You can still de-bitter bamboo shoots after peeling them.",
      "Don't worry.",
      "Just be careful not to yourself when removing that tough skin.",
      "Whenever I receive a lot of bamboo shoots as a gift, I always peel them before boiling them.",
      "They're still very tasty in simmered dishes and so on.",
      "After the cooking water comes to a boil, it bubbles up very vigorously and threatens to spill over.",
      "So lower the heat as soon as the water comes to a boil.",
      "After about an hour has passed, try poking a shoot with a bamboo skewer.",
      "If it goes through easily, turn off the heat.",
