      "If you do not have a thermometer, test the syrup after it has boiled, foamed, and reduced somewhat.",
      "Drop a fork tong of syrup on the counter-if it dries in a mound, scrapes off the counter cleanly with your fingernail, and is somewhat pliable and gummy between two fingers, it is ready.",
      "Add the maple syrup to the egg yolks:",
      "Remove the star anise with a fork and discard.",
      "With the mixer on medium-high speed, slowly pour the hot maple syrup down the side of the bowl into the yolks.",
      "Using a rubber spatula, scrape the gelatin into the empty pan in which you cooked the maple syrup, and let it melt into a syrupy liquid.",
      "Pour the gelatin into the egg yolk mixture and whisk at medium-high speed until it triples in volume and cools to room temperature.",
      "Finish the mousse:",
      "Remove the bowl with the mousse base from the mixer.",
      "In a separate bowl, whip the heavy cream until it has soft peaks.",
      "Scrape the whipped cream on top of the mousse base.",
      "Fold the two together with a spatula or bowl scraper: place your spatula in the center of the bowl, scrape the bottom, and bring the bottom over the top.",
      "Rotate the bowl 45 degrees and continue folding until all the whipped cream is incorporated.",
      "If you want to serve the mousse in a casual manner, let it chill and gel in a large bowl or plastic container for at least 2 hours before dolloping it out onto individual plates.",
      "Alternatively, for a more finished look, pour the mousse into 6 to 8 small serving dishes and let it set in the refrigerator, covered, for at least 2 hours before serving.",
      "Serving Suggestions:",
      "Serve this mousse with a crunchy cookie or some chopped hazelnuts, pecans, or walnuts."

      "Have all the ingredients in one big bowl.",

      "I am stressing thisthe ingredients MUST be well mixed!",
      "The dough is well-rested at this point.",
      "Take the dough one by one and roll into a round, flat circle or an oval measuring up to 5 mm thick.",

      "My husband likes them much softer, so I make his portion a little thicker but no more than 5-8 mm.",
      "Some use pizza stones to bake Lahmacuns.",
      "While it is a good alternative to the original brick ovens, in my opinion, it is not very practical.",
      "So, I suggest using regular baking sheets.",
      "Sprinkle some non-fat cooking spray (or just a little oil will work), place the rolled dough on the sheet, slightly brush with some olive oil (canola oil works too) and top up with 2 tablespoons of the ready topping.",
      "Spread the topping evenly and very thinly.",
      "I place 2 pieces of doughs in one regular 11x17 size baking sheet.",

      "When you take the ready batch out, rotate the bottom one to the top and place a new batch on the lower rack.",

      "Since you are going to be constantly opening the oven, the temperature ideally will stay at about 370F.",
      "Cooked Lahmacuns are crispy at the ends and softer in the middle.",
      "Corners usually get nicely tanned.",
      "Take them off the baking sheet to a wider container and cover with a towel until you are done with every single one of them.",
      "Humidity under the towel will soften Lahmacuns, making it very easy for you to roll them around the fresh ingredients you might want to use.",
      "Pace yourself; the process is a little overwhelming.",
