    "ingredients": [],

      "1. First, make the flavoring paste. Place the chile, shallots, garlic, galangal, ginger, and coriander in a small food processor, and pulse until the coriander is well ground (no visible bits or pieces should remain) and you have a smooth paste the consistency of creamy mashed potatoes. (If the paste will not puree properly, and repeatedly creeps up the side of the food processor instead of grinding, add up to 2 tablespoons of water to it, 1 tablespoon at a time, periodically turning the processor off and scraping the unground portions with a spoon down toward the blade as you go.) Set aside.",
      "2. Rinse the chicken under cold running water and pat it dry with paper towels. If using a whole chicken, for authenticity cut it into 16 pieces. If using precut chicken parts, you can leave them whole. Set aside.",
      "3. Heat the oil in a 3- or 4-quart saucepan, Dutch oven, or soup pot over medium-low heat. Test to see if the oil is the right temperature by adding a pinch of the ground paste. The paste should sizzle slightly around the edges, not fry aggressively or sit motionless. When the oil is the correct temperature, add all the ground flavoring paste and saute, stirring every 10 seconds or so to prevent sticking and burning, until the paste begins to separate from the oil and the smell of raw garlic and shallots has dissipated, about 5 to 7 minutes. Add the cinnamon, tied lemongrass, lime leaves, and daun salam leaves (if using) and stir to combine them with the flavoring paste. Continue sauteing until you can clearly smell the fragrance of cinnamon, about 1 minute.",
      "4. Add the chicken and raise the heat to medium. Saute the chicken in the flavoring paste, moving it around often with a large spoon or spatula to prevent sticking or scorching. Turn each piece so that it sauts in the oil, until they are evenly golden brown, about 10 minutes. (You need not brown the chicken in two batches - it's fine if the chicken is piled in 2 layers, as long as you adjust the pieces in the pot so they all eventually brown.)",
      "5. Add 1 cup of the unsweetened coconut milk, the water, and the salt to the chicken. Stir well to combine, blending the flavoring paste with the liquids and scraping from the bottom of the pot to bring up all the bits of flavor stuck to the surface, and bring to a low, steady simmer. Let the coconut milk simmer, stirring occasionally, until the fats from the chicken and coconut milk have risen to the surface and the chicken is tender and cooked through, but not falling apart from the bone, 40 to 50 minutes. You may need to lower and raise the heat occasionally if the simmer becomes too aggressive. Be careful to not allow the liquid to boil; the chicken will likely toughen and the coconut milk curdle. Taste for salt, and add more if necessary.",
      "6. Add the additional 1 cup coconut milk and allow it to heat through and begin to take in the flavors of the curry, about 2 minutes. This additional coconut milk enriches this rich dish even more. If there is too much oil floating on the surface of the curry for your taste, feel free to skim some of it off, but by all means not all of it - it's intensely flavorful. Taste for salt once more.",
      "7. Transfer the chicken and sauce to a low serving bowl; you may remove the cinnamon, tied lemongrass, and kaffir lime and daun salam leaves, if you like, or leave them in the bowl to continue to season the dish. Allow the dish to rest and cool at room temperature for at least 20 minutes before eating, which will give the flavors time to blend and intensify."

Gradually add the remaining sugar and continue beating until stiff peaks form (the whites will stand up and look glossy, not dry). Fold about one-third of the whites into the batter, then the remaining whites. Don't worry if you still see a few white specks, as they'll disappear during baking.",
      "6. Gently spread the batter over the bottom of the prepared pan and bake just until set and golden (not wet or sticky), about 10 minutes. Touch the cake gently in the center. If it springs back, it's done. Watch carefully and don't let the top brown. Leave the crust in the pan and place on a wire rack to cool. Leave the oven on while you prepare the batter for the cheesecake."

You'll want one piece per rouladen plus a couple for the sauce, and one or two for you :). So these are like, well meat crepes. Take a slice of beef, salt and pepper one side, lay down a quartered dill pickle, some spicy mustard, chopped onion/garlic, I do a shave or two of carrot, and of course that BACON!. All these things are at the one end of the steak, and then you roll the sucker up like a blintz! Tie with a bit of kitchen string, I pre-cut mine. Do up a whole bunch. Roll them in some seasoned flour, and in the bacon pan, sear the shit out of all sides of the little babies. Pack them all into a baking/roasting pan just like meat sardines. You can deglaze your pan with a bit o red wine, or the rest of that beer you're drinking. Pour that into the pan, and hell why not toss in some onion/garlic/mushroom if you got it, all to make the sauce better. Oh and don't forget the couple spare bacon strips that survived the kitchen invaders. By now, things are smelling fabulous, and people are hungry, don't be afraid to spatter hot oil at them to defend your reouladen babies. So now you put 'em in the oven, tell your babies a bedtime story, and that you'll see them in like two hours. Cover the pan with foil and SLAM the oven door! Muahaha! (300-350ish) Broil the suckers for 10 at the end. Take out the rouladen onto a plate, and make your gravy with the amazingness in the pan. Read up on gravies and sauce in general in the joy of cooking, you'll be glad you did. Eat like a fricken pig! Oh, and what's that, you made a second batch?? Perfect! Because you know what, they are amazingly better the next day after the juice makes friends with the meat over a long and sexy night in the fridge.",
