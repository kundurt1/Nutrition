      "Don't cut too deep or the chestnuts will fall apart when cooked.",
      "As long as you pierce through the outer shell and the inner skin, they're fine.",

      "Use the chestnuts in syrup or other recipes.",
      "You can freeze them in plastic bags too.",
      "If you want to retain the inner skin for chestnuts simmered in their inner skins, just score through the outer shell in Step 4.",
      "This way, the inner skin won't tear and will remain intact.",
      "Observation: I tried storing the chestnuts in the \"chilled\" compartment for 2 weeks, changing the newspapers twice during the process.",
      "I think the chestnuts got about 20% or so sweeter.",
      "I also stored some chestnuts in the vegetable compartment of the refrigerator and compared them.",

      "(I changed the newspapers several times.)",
      "To be more specific, the chestnuts seem to dry out a little, since I think the outer shell got a little wrinkled.",
