      "This recipe has received such varying reviews we thought we better bring it to the CDTestKitchen. You'll notice we're giving it 5 stars - that's because it turned out perfect for us. We boiled the mixture about a minute (maybe 20-30 seconds more) then let it cool just a little (in case it splatted it wouldn't burn then!) and beat it with an electric mixer for about 3 1/2 minutes. We used all the measurements/ingredients exactly as called for in the recipe. One thing that may be confusing people is that this is not a fluffy kind of frosting that you use to decorate a cake. This is more of a frosting that would go on brownies, or a cake that is in a pan. The mixture will harden some however, but it definitely shouldn't be soupy like some reviewers mentioned. Be careful not to heat it over too high a heat, or the sugar will start to turn to candy (which will make the mixture crunchy). We think the biggest success factor is the mixing time/technique. Don't try to mix this by hand, you won't get it to the right consistency. Also, don't let it cool too much before spreading it since it will firm up more while it cools (to the point it won't be easily spreadable)."

Set the ginger juice aside and discard the rest. You should have about a tablespoon, give or take. Using a vegetable peeler, peel the zest off of the lemon in large strips, trying not to get too much white pith. Set aside and juice the lemon, being sure to discard the seeds.",

Add the ginger juice, and half of the lemon juice and cook, stirring occasionally for about 10 minutes, until the broth is fragrant. Taste the soup and add salt as needed. Want more lemon? Add more juice. Need to increase the spice level? Add some red pepper flakes or a dash of hot sauce. When the broth has the right balance for you, increase the heat to medium-high and bring to a simmer.",
      "When just barely bubbling, grab a whisk and start whisking it slowly while drizzling the beaten eggs in a thin stream, so that they cook when they hit the broth in thin tendrils. Once all the eggs have been added, add in the orzo or rice if you are using it, and heat another five to six minutes just to warm them through. Garnish with chopped parsley and serve hot."

      "Put masa harina in a large bowl, sift in baking powder, and whisk in salt. With mixer on low speed, beat one-third of masa mixture into lard until fully incorporated (scrape beater and bowl at least once), then beat in one-third more. With mixer still on low, drizzle in broth so it doesn't splatter, and beat 5 minutes to hydrate masa mixture (it will thicken).",
      "Beat in remaining one-third masa mixture, a spoonful at a time, until incorporated and dough is soft and fluffy without being sticky (you may not need all the masa mixture). Test dough by rolling a small ball of it over the back of your hand; if it rolls easily, without sticking, you've added enough.",
      "Cover dough with a damp kitchen towel and let rest for at least 10 minutes and up to 1 hour, or chill up to 2 days.",
      "Meanwhile, drain cornhusks and pat dry with a kitchen towel. If you won't be using them immediately, chill them in resealable plastic bags for up to 2 days.",
      "Put 4 upturned ramekins in a 10- to 12-qt. stockpot equipped with a tight-fitting lid and set a steamer basket on top (or use a tamalera; see \"Tamalada Shopping List,\" below). Pour in water to a depth of at least 1 1/2 inches but below the steamer basket level. Repeat with a second stockpot. (Or use 1 pot, but cook half the tamales at a time.)",
      "Fill tamales: Set a cornhusk on a work surface, smoother side up (or hold it in your hand), and dollop 2 to 2 1/2 tbsp. dough onto wide (top) half of husk. Smear with back of a soup spoon or your fingers until about 1/4 in. thick, leaving a 1-in. border along top and sides. Fill by spooning 1 1/2 to 2 tbsp. filling down center of dough (for cheese and chile filling, arrange 2 cheese pieces and 2 chile strips down center). Bring sides of husk to meet over filling, then fold both sides over filling in the same direction. (Go to sunset.com/tamalevideo for a video on how to fold.) Turn tamale seam side up, then fold narrow bottom (end) under tamale to close it.",
      "As you work, set tamales upright (open ends up) in steamer baskets of pots, packing them loosely. Or, if you don't have enough room on your work surface, put them in baking pans or some other container with sides, arranging them upright; then transfer them to pots on stove.",
      "Cover pots with foil (or a thin kitchen towel) and lids, which must fit tightly to keep the steam in. Bring pots to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-high to maintain a steady boil. Steam tamales vigorously until easily separated from husks but still somewhat soft (open one to check), 1 to 1 1/2 hours, adding hot water to pot every 20 minutes or so. Remove pot from heat, remove lid and foil, and let tamales cool in pot 20 minutes, uncovered, to firm up.",
      "*You can use broth left from making the Chicken and Green Tomatillo Tamale Filling. Or, for Pork and Red Chile tamales, use the broth from that filling.",
      "Make ahead: Dough, up to 3 days, chilled airtight; soaked cornhusks, up to 2 days, chilled. Cooked tamales keep for 1 week chilled and up to 2 months frozen. To reheat, steam or microwave, covered with a damp kitchen towel.",

      "Lard: Widely available, hydrogenated lard will work in these recipes. But for tamales with the best flavor and lightest texture (and no trans fats), get fresh lard from a butcher shop or Latino market. Or make your own; it's easy.",
      "Masa harina: Masa harina is fresh corn dough dried and ground into flour; to use, mix with lard or butter, baking powder, and broth or other liquid. Brands vary in texture; Maseca was used in these recipes, since it's easy to find. Or, choose fresh masa, which you can use as is; look for the label \"para tamales\" at a Latino market. You'll need 4 lbs. for 3 dozen tamales.",
      "Tamalera: This large pot has a tall steamer insert that allows for plenty of hot water (a 20-qt. tamalera will hold 3 dozen tamales). Find one at Latino markets or mexgrocer.com.
