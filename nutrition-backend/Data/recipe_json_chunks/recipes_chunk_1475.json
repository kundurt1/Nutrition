      "Beer note: Spiced Tilapia with Roasted Pepper-Tomatillo Sauce, with its nutrient-rich sauce, deserves a beer in keeping with its fresh, healthful profile. American wheat beers, like Blue Star Wheat from North Coast Brewing Co., ($8 per 6-pack) are cloudy from B vitamin-packed brewer's yeast remaining in the beer. This brew's slightly tart, lemony quality goes great with fish, and its billowy effervescence keeps it crisp and light on the palate. --Jeffery Lindenmuth",

      "Lay skewers over a solid bed of medium-hot coals or medium-high heat on a gas grill (you can hold your hand at grill level only 3 to 4 seconds); close lid on gas grill.

      "Transfer skewers to a platter. Sprinkle with remaining tablespoon chopped dill and serve with lemon wedges for a final squeeze of juice.",
      "Wine pairing: Crisp, lemony, herbaceous Sauvignon Blanc. Best in our pairing: St. Supery 2004 (Napa Valley; $19), Girard 2005 (Napa Valley; $15), and Morgan 2004 (Monterey, CA; $15).",
      "Flavor bridges: Lamb--especially spring lamb--is a blank slate and can be pushed in disparate wine directions with different seasonings. A grassy, citrusy Sauvignon Blanc picks up the dill and lemon in the marinade and even green, grassy notes in the olive oil (a fruity wine would fight all of the above). High acid in the wine is good for cutting through charred meats.",

This morel and fava bean pasta dish begs for a full, tropical fruit-laden rose from Bodegas Muga, Rioja Rose, 2009 ($13). Its elegant, fresh citrus flavors cut the creamy mascarpone, while its laid-back herbal notes pair remarkably with the meaty morels. --Alexander Spacher"
