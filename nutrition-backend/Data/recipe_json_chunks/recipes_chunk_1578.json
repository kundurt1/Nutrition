    "title": "homemade pierogi",
    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "1. First, start preparing the filling. Fill a large pot with cold water and put it on the stove. Peel and quarter the potatoes, and add the quarters to the cold water in the pot as you go. This will keep them from browning while you work on the rest of the potatoes. Once all of the potatoes are prepped and in the cold water, bring the pot to a boil. Boil the potatoes until they are completely tender and mashable, about 45 minutes.",
      "2. In the meantime, make the dough so it can rest. In a bowl combine the egg, sour cream, salt and flour. Stir it together completely and then turn it out onto a lightly floured surface. Knead it for a couple of minutes to have it come together in a wonderful ball of dough. Wrap it in plastic and set it aside to rest for about 30 minutes. This will allow the gluten in the flour to relax and make for a really tender pierogi dough.",
      "3. The potatoes should be just about done at the same time the dough is ready. Remove them from the water with a slotted spoon and transfer them to a very large bowl. Do not drain the water, leave the pot of water on the stove. Mash the potatoes in the bowl and stir in the farmer's cheese, American cheese and butter until it becomes a creamy, luscious filling.",
      "4. Divide the dough in half and roll out the first half to about 1/4 an inch thick on a floured surface with a floured rolling pin. With the mouth of a glass, cut out perfect little circles. You should get nine circles the first time, and then take the scraps and roll it out again to cut out another 3.",
      "5. Fill each of the circles with a heaping teaspoon of filling on one half, then bring the other half over to enclose it and pinch it together thoroughly. Really seal them well, and make a pretty pattern along the edge by pressing down with the tines of a fork over the whole edge. Lay out the pierogi on a sheet tray lined with a towel and repeat the process with the other half of dough. There is going to be a lot of filling leftover, and that's OK. I just pack it up, and then I make another ball of dough to use it up later. Don't double the dough recipe though, it won't be quite the same.",
      "6. Bring the pot of water that you boiled the potatoes in back up to a boil. I had a master plan for this, I promise! All of that starchy water was too good to waste. Boil the pierogi in batches of 6 or 7 in that starchy water until they rise to the top. It should take only about 3 minutes. Transfer them to a large platter with a slotted spoon and boil all of the rest until they are done. If you wish, heat a large skillet over medium heat and thinly slice up an onion. Then saute the onion in half a stick of butter. As the onions cook, give the pierogi a quick toss with them in batches again to make them slightly golden and then plate them to serve with the onion on top.",
      "7. On their own, or on the side of a nice kielbasa with mustard and sauerkraut, these pierogi are just made for an amazing Polish feast. I think my late mother-in-law would be proud of how they came out!"

Allow to come back to a boil, then add in onions, garlic, tomato mixture, vinegar, and Worcestershire. Stir in spices and bay leaves. Bring to a boil once more. Cover, reduce heat to low and simmer for 2.5 hours. Stir every 1/2 hour or so.",

Place the egg shells securely inside each cupcake lining using the foil to secure its place in the pan. Into an icing bag, piping bag or cupcake spout, add the cupcake batter. If you do not have one of those, take a Ziploc bag, pour in the cupcake batter, close the bag, and make a hole at the end of one of the corners of the bag and use that to pipe the cupcake batter.

      "This makes a lot of cake balls (about 50, depending on the size of the balls you shape)! One batch makes a great party treat, but feel free to cut the recipe in half for a shorter prep time and fewer servings.",
      "Never re-dip or touch the chocolate. Even if you think this will make them look better. Coconut and sea salt cover a multitude of mistakes!",
      "The dipping process is easier if you have a helper or two! Cake balls are for friends!",
      "For the cake balls:",
      "1. Bake the yellow cake mix in a 9x13 pan, according to package directions. After it is baked, let it cool completely",
      "2. Then, break up the whole baked cake into a large bowl and stir it in a stand mixer (or with a hand mixer) until it reaches a fine texture.",
      "3. Add about 3/4 of the container of frosting along with the 1/4 cup pourable caramel topping to the cake crumbs.",
      "4. Mix about 2 minutes, until it reaches a smooth texture. It should look like cookie dough!",
      "5. Use a small cookie scoop (or a spoon) and your hands and shape the dough into similarly portioned and round cake balls. Make them as small or large as you'd like to snack on!",
      "6. Place the cake balls on a cookie sheet and place them in the freezer for 1-2 hours, until firm.",
      "For the coating:",
      "7. Break chocolate bark into individual squares. Melt the chocolate bark in a double boiler (see note * below). Start by melting half of the squares, as you may not need a whole package to coat your cake balls.",
      "* Double boiler instructions: Use two saucepans of varying sizes or a saucepan and a heatproof glass bowl (one that fits inside of the saucepan). The pot with larger circumference should be deep enough to accommodate the water with the smaller bowl/pot placed inside of it. Add water to the lower pot and add chocolate into the top pot or glass bowl. Rest the smaller pot (or glass bowl) into the larger one, resting the sides on the edge of the other pot. Remember to leave at least one inch of space between the water and the pot that's holding the chocolate. Heat the pot of water to a simmer and let the top pot filled with chocolate melt. Make sure to not let the chocolate come to a boil!",
      "If you cannot create a double boiler, you may carefully microwave the chocolate in 30 second intervals (stirring in between each additional 30 second interval). You don't want your chocolate to seize up!",
      "For the assembly:",
      "1. Cover your styrofoam base with a piece of parchment paper.",
      "2. Take the cake balls out of the freezer about 5-8 at a time, so they don't become soft while you are working.",
      "3. Dip a toothpick in the melted chocolate and then stick it into the center of a cake ball. Do this to each of the balls.",
      "4. Push 2-3 caramel bits into every cake ball at different locations to give caramel texture to the cake balls.",
      "5. One at a time, dip each cake ball in the melted chocolate until it covers the whole ball. Allow excess to drip back into the pan.",
      "6. Before the chocolate dries, sprinkle the toasted coconut and sea salt (sparingly) over the ball.",
      "7. Stick the toothpick holding the ball into the Styrofoam base to let it dry.",
      "8. Once the chocolate has hardened, remove the toothpicks and place the cake balls on a serving tray. Or, cake balls may be stored in an air tight container in the fridge for several days for easy snacking!"

Also, if you need to leave the house before the dough cycle is complete, you can transfer the dough to a Ziploc bag after the kneading is finished and let rise for 2 hours before shaping. Don't try to rush these too much, as the rising is what makes these rolls so amazing. You can also increase the proportion of wheat to white flour or vice versa, according to your preference."

      "Pour 1/3 cup of the water into the bowl of a stand mixer. Sprinkle the gelatin over the water and stir briefly to incorporate. Let it stand for about 10 minutes, or until the gelatin has softened.",
      "In a saucepan, off the heat, combine the remaining 1/3 cup of water and the granulated sugar, corn syrup and salt. Place the pan over medium-high heat. Clip a candy thermometer on the inside of the pan, making sure it doesn't touch the bottom. Cook the mixture without stirring until it reaches 240\u00b0F. Brush down the sides of the pan with a pastry brush, dipped in water, to gently wipe away any sugar crystals.",
      "With your mixer on low speed, very carefully add the hot syrup to the softened gelatin. Once combined, add the vanilla and increase the speed to medium-high. The mixture will start out clear, but quickly turn very white. Beat for about 8 minutes, or until the marshmallow gets very thick and sticky, and starts to pull away from the sides of the bowl, in string-like pieces. This will really give your mixer a workout.",
      "Spread the mixture into the prepared pan using a lightly oiled spatula. With wet hands, press the batter evenly into the corners of the pan. Just keep rewetting your hands to help with the stickiness. Set aside for at least 1 hour, or until the mixture is firm and cool.",
      "Run a wet knife around the edge of the cooled pan to loosen the marshmallow. Remove the marshmallow from the pan, onto a sheet of parchment paper.",
      "Dip your small chick-shaped cookie cutter (mine measures 1\" wide by 1-1/2\" tall) into a shallow bowl of water and then cut the slab of marshmallow into chick shapes. This is a sticky job, but just have patience. It's worth it! It helps to dip the chick cutter into the water in between cuts. Repeat this process until the whole slab of marshmallow is cut.",
      "For the white chocolate coating and decoration:",
      "Using the microwave, carefully melt the white chocolate in a glass, taking special care to not let the white chocolate get too hot. It's best to partially melt the white chocolate and then just stir it until completely melted. Then at that point you can color it with yellow candy coloring to your liking.",
      "Drop a marshmallow chick into the colored white chocolate and dunk with a fork to completely coat. Pick the marshmallow up with the fork, allowing excess white chocolate to drip off while lightly tapping the fork to coax more of the excess off. Then slide the fork out of the glass, scraping the underside of the fork tines along the rim of the glass. This will scrape off any remaining excess white chocolate, so you don't have a pool of it form around your chick as it cools.",
      "Set the white chocolate coated chick on a sheet of parchment paper. Then, while the coating is still wet, place a blue nonpareil for the eye and sprinkle a bit of yellow sugar on the body, staying away from the chick's feet. Let the chicks cool and completely set up on your kitchen counter. It may help to let them sit in the refrigerator for awhile.",
      "For the glaze icing for the chick's feet and beak:",
      "Sift the powdered sugar into a small bowl and add the milk and corn syrup. Stir until well incorporated. Then color it with orange icing coloring to your liking. If the icing is too stiff, add just a little more milk. If it's too thin, add a bit of powdered sugar.",
      "Pour colored glaze icing into a pastry bag fitted with a small round tip. Pipe on a little orange beak and a line across the chick's feet. This glaze is easy to manipulate and \"stretch\" using a toothpick, if needed. Let dry completely.",
      "Store in a single layer in an airtight container. The white chocolate will have a softer set than if using candy melts.",

Set the milk and yeast mixture aside until it becomes foamy. The remainder of the milk in the measuring cup will be used to make the dough.)",

      "2 important notes before we begin: First, only real butter please! If you decide to use something else, you do so at your own risk! Second, if you cannot find White Lily flour, try to find another flour made from a soft white winter wheat. It's important because the fineness of the flour lends itself to very fluffy and light biscuits when done!",
      "Preheat oven to 500\u00b0F.",
      "Cut butter into small pats and lay out on a cookie sheet lined in wax paper. Stick in the freezer for at least 10 minutes. Prepare a cast iron skillet with a tiny amount of bacon grease, if available. (The easiest thing is to fry 1 slice of bacon, wipe out the pan, and you're good to go!)",
      "Note: It's very important to use a cast iron skillet and some sort of grease on the bottom of the pan. It goes a long way with flavor. Don't be too terribly worried about it being unhealthy, you barely need anything on the bottom of the skillet, just a faint sheen of grease.",
      "Combine all the dry ingredients together and then cut in the butter. Cut in until the butter is about pea-sized, relatively well mixed in. Add buttermilk. Add slowly until you have just enough where the dough separates from the sides of the bowl. Stir until just combined and roll it out onto a well-floured surface. If it seems a little dry here, that's ok. The wetter the dough, the more difficult it is to work with.",
      "Before kneading, cover with some flour. Knead a couple of times and flatten out to about 3/4\" to 1\" thickness. (Honestly, the thicker the better, because they rise so beautifully!) Using a biscuit cutter, or just a glass cup, cut out biscuits. Press straight down, don't twist the cup/cutter.",
      "Place biscuits in the cast-iron skillet and be sure biscuits are touching. You can use whatever size cutter you want, just be sure the biscuits are touching on each side. This makes them rise better!",
      "Bake at 500\u00b0F for about 8-10 minutes. At about the 6-minute mark, take the skillet out of the oven and brush the biscuits with melted salted butter. You pretty much have to brush the tops with butter. This is an integral part of the baking process. And be liberal with it, brush on the sides of the biscuits if they are showing. This proves the biscuits with so much flavor once they are done!",
      "Different ovens may react differently, so please be sure to watch the biscuits carefully. They don't take that long to cook and can go from perfect to burnt very quickly. If you use a small size biscuit cutter, be away they will bake fast! Don't let the tops get too brown because you want the biscuits to stay light and fluffy inside and not get overcooked!",

      "Now for the last, and best part of all: the cream cheese. You'll want to put it in the soup in clumps, about 1-2 tablespoons or so. That's just an estimate though, don't get technical, just eyeball it. As you drop your clumps in, push them below the surface so they're entirely submerged. We want it to melt nicely.",
      "No need to stir much, you'll just make it separate and look really strange (again I did this the first couple times I made this and it turned out weird-looking, but tasted great). It takes about 5 minutes to melt entirely.",
      "The end. I usually leave this to simmer, as low of a setting as I can, for 1-3 hours. Just depends how far in advance I've made it. This soup is thick and hearty, great with sourdough. It becomes very thick like a casserole in a couple of hours, and then can be eaten with a fork! Hope you enjoy!"

I decided to make BLT's. I didn't know that you shouldn't fry bacon on HIGH heat. So I burned the bacon and filled the house with smoke...SO embarrassing...",
      "I eventually learned how to fry bacon correctly. It starts with a pan on MEDIUM to maybe medium-high heat. Lay out the bacon closely, but not touching (or they will become friends, bond together and be hard to flip).",
      "See how those strips in the back are starting to bubble just a bit? That is good. Here go a few more...",
      "When they start browning on the bottom they are almost ready to flip.",
      "Flip the strips one by one with a fork and fry the other side. As soon they have some froth on top, light brown all over and shriveled up a bit, pull it off quickly and get it onto a plate lined with paper towels (to catch the grease).",
      "If you are being more precise, you could have several plates to line the bacon up on to dry so that it doesn't clump together, but I didn't need to be precise with this recipe.",
      "After you finish pulling the bacon out of the pan, make sure you turn the burners off! I let the grease sit in the pan until cool, then slide it off with a spatula and save it for things like sliding grease under the skin of a turkey or making a pot of beans taste delicious. The grease will freeze too and also makes good suet bakes with birdseed during winter. Do not use bacon fat suet in the summer because it might rot and/or attract meat eaters."

      "4. A wooden spoon or spatula.",
      "Preparing the pine nuts for the soup and garnish:",
      "1. In a dry, heavy-bottomed frying pan over medium heat, brown 2/3 cup of the pine nuts. Once browned, remove them from the pan and set them aside to cool. (Set the pan aside without washing it, to use later to cook the shrimp.)",
      "2. Once the nuts are cool, chop them and mix them with half of the chopped cilantro. Set the mixture aside to use to garnish the soup before serving.",
      "For the soup:",
      "1. Heat 3 tablespoons of the olive oil in the large, heavy pot over medium heat and add the minced garlic, shallot, green chili, shrimp shells and the remaining 1/3 cup of the pine nuts. Cook, stirring everything around, until the shells turn a pinkish color-which will be in a few minutes.",
      "2. Then add the wine and cook, stirring and heating until wine is reduced by half.",
      "3. Add the water and bouillon cubes, 4 tablespoons of the lemon juice and half the minced lemon zest. Simmer the soup gently, covered, for 45 minutes.",
      "4. Strain the soup into a large bowl. Then return it to the pot and add the turmeric, the lime zest, the rest of the lemon zest, the heavy cream and the lime juice.",
      "5. In the pan that you used to brown the pine nuts, heat the remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil over medium high heat. Add the pieces of shrimp and cook them quickly, moving them around with a wooden spoon or spatula. Sprinkle them with the salt and pepper, add the remaining lemon juice and the other half of the fresh, chopped cilantro. Set the shrimp aside, still in the pan, to keep them warm-or to briefly rewarm them if they grow cool.",
      "6. When ready to serve the soup, place the bowls out on a counter. Heat the soup over a low heat, stirring occasionally, without bringing it to a boil. Warm the shrimp a little, if necessary. Place a small mound of shrimp in the middle of each bowl, ladle soup into the bowls and sprinkle them with the browned pine nuts and coriander garnish.",

Option 1: you can wrap the whole beet in aluminum foil (skin on) and roast it in the oven for one hour. Allow the beet to cool, then grate it with the fine side of your box grater. This option takes some time, but it ensures that the texture of the beet is not noticeable and you wouldn't know it was in the muffin unless you were told.",
      "Option 2: I chose this method because I had leftover roasted beet from a different recipe. Peel your beet, and chop it into 4 pieces. Put the pieces in a food processor, and pulse 5 to 8 times until the beet is all shredded up. Measure 1 cup of the shredded beet, wrap it all in foil and place it in the oven at 375 F for 30 - 40 minutes. Allow the foil package to cool, then unwrap it and set aside. This option is less time intensive and it allows the slightest bit of beet texture to come through. I like the texture, but I can understand if others would prefer to not realize the beet was in the muffin at all. For mothers trying to get their kids to eat beets, the first option is likely the better.",

When all the flour has been incorporated, add the sugar and oil and mix well. The batter now is ready. To make the crepes, butter the surface of the pan or in this case a special crepe pan (where you can make six at a time). Spoon some of the batter on the pan, swirl around just enough to cover it and cook 1-2 minutes on each side. Repeat with the rest of the batter.",
      "To make the caramel, melt the sugar in a saucepan on low-medium heat. Be sure to use a pan that lets you see the colour of the sugar as it melts, otherwise you can easily burn it and that's the point of no return. When the sugar starts to melt (you will first see it on the sides) you can start pushing it a bit towards the centre to prevent it from burning, stirring it occasionally. When the sugar has melted and has a nice dark amber colour, take it off the heat and stir in the butter (careful here as it tends to splash). Add a splash of Calvados and finally stir in the cream. Transfer the caramel to a jar/container leave it to cool in the room temperature, then place it in the fridge till needed.",
      "To make the jam, grate the zest of the oranges and squeeze the juice. Peel and core the apples, then cut into small cubes of equal size. Mix all the ingredients (apples, zest, juice and sugar) in a small saucepan and simmer for about 15 minutes till the apples are soft, stirring occasionally. Check if you are happy with the sweetness, then pass through a fine sieve and store in an airtight jar.",
      "You can prepare the caramel and jam a few days in advance and keep them in the fridge.",

Fold the top 1/3 of the plastic bag opening down over the rim of the glass to keep it out of the way. This method will keep goopy frosting out of the portion of bag you'll be twisting closed when piping.",
      "Use a spoon or butterknife to fill the first bag 2/3 of the way full and set the first bag aside. Cut the second bag's tip off so you can place your frosting coupler down into the bag.",
      "Secure the piping tip on the outside of the bag with the coupler ring. Remove the full bag of icing from the cup and place the second bag, tip/coupler pointing downward into the bottom of the cup. Fold bag sides over the rim as you did the first.",
      "Using a dry, small paintbrush and a container of food coloring paste (NOT LIQUID FOOD COLORING), begin painting a thin (1/2\"-3/4\") stripe up one side of the coupler/bag. Make the total length of the stripe about 4 inches - it doesn't need to come all the way up the bag, and you'll have less mess and crisper-looking stripes if you quit while you're ahead.",
      "Cut a good-sized tip off of the point of the already-full icing bag to expose the frosting, and place it partially down into the striped bag. Begin squeezing to transfer the frosting into the striped bag, stopping when 2/3 of the way full. The reason for using one bag to transition into the other is to keep spoons/knives from possibly smearing the stripe you painted in the second bag. This makes for an easy, clean fill.",
      "When the striped bag is filled, flip up the edges of the bag, remove from the drinking glass, and twist the bag shut. You're ready to start piping. Use a napkin or coffee filter to do a few practice squeezes on first, so that any uneven or wet blobs of excess food coloring will not land on the cake, and also so you know exactly how it's going to look coming out and where your stripe will be positioned.",

Once that's incorporated, add in a cup of powdered sugar at a time. Occasionally scrape down the sides of the bowl. At this point, keep adding sugar until the frosting is as thick or thin as you like. I tend to add most of the bag for a firmer frosting, but sometimes I just like a runnier icing. It all depends on your mood and what you are making. Now taste the icing. Is it lemony enough? If not, squeeze more juice and mix a little longer.",
