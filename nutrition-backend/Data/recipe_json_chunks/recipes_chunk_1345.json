For a gas grill, turn the burners that will be directly underneath the chicken off and the other burners to medium. (If your grill has only two burners, turn one off and set the other one at medium. You may need to rotate the chicken periodically so that both sides brown.)",

It is not really possible to \"sprinkle\" the topping over the pie, it is more like putting dots of topping. These dots melt and spread out over the top of the pie during the remaining cooking time.\""

When it is hot, add the bread and pan-fry until evenly golden and crisp. (Take care that the olive oil does not become too hot and begin to smoke.) Remove and drain off excess oil. Pound the bread, in batches if necessary, using a mortar and pestle, until you have coarse bread crumbs. Place the nuts on a baking sheet and roast in the middle of the oven for 10 minutes until evenly golden. Tip the hot nuts into a clean dry cloth and rub to remove the skins. Mince the nuts and place in a bowl with the bread crumbs, orange zest, and juice. Mince the garlic and oregano together and add to the bowl with a pinch of salt. Stir to combine, then set aside. Turn the oven to its lowest setting.",

Turn and cook on the other side for 3 minutes (you may need a minute or two longer if the steaks have been cut from a thicker section of the thigh). You should have a nice brown crust, while the meat inside should be rare. Remove to a plate and rest in the warm oven for 6 to 8 minutes.",

Put the lid on until the water clinging to the leaves begins to steam, then uncover and stir every few seconds so the leaves wilt uniformly. This will take 2 to 3 minutes. Now you should have a lovely glossy, pale green vegetable. Check the seasoning. Place a steak on each warm serving plate and arrange the escarole alongside. Spoon over the picada and serve at once."

      "Grease a large bowl with oil. Scrape the dough into the oiled bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Let the dough stand in a warm, draft-free place until nearly double in bulk, about 1 hour.",
      "Liberally dust your rolling surface with tapioca flour. Line two cookie sheets with waxed paper. These will be your holding trays for the cut dough. Place the dough on the floured surface and dust with tapioca flour. Gently roll the dough to about 1/8 in/6 mm thick. With a 2 1/4-in/5.75-cm cookie cutter, cut out as many rounds as possible, dipping the cutter into tapioca flour before each cut. With a spatula dipped in tapioca flour, scoop up the rounds and place on the prepared sheets, spacing them at least 1 in/2.5 cm apart. Flour your hands with tapioca flour, gather the remaining dough, and squish it a few times to smooth it out, then repeat the process until all the dough is used. Try to do this in as few batches as you can. It's fine if some of the last cut rounds have some folds. You should aim for 40 rounds (you need an even amount).",
      "Using a pastry brush, brush off as much tapioca flour as you can from the cut rounds. Place 1/4 tsp jam in the center of half of the rounds. With a finger dipped in water, moisten the dough around the jam. Set a plain round on top of each jam-covered round. Press around the edges to seal, then push the edges toward the center so each doughnut is fat and fluffy. You may also want to bring the cookie cutter down around the perimeter of each doughnut to cut off any extra dough sticking out from the circle and to further seal the sides. Let the doughnuts stand in a warm, draft-free place until they are puffy and about double in bulk, about 1 hour.",
      "About 30 minutes before the doughnuts have risen fully, pour 3 to 4 in/7.5 to 10 cm of oil into a deep, heavy-bottomed 2-qt/2-L saucepan. Heat over medium-high heat until the oil reaches 375\u00b0F/190\u00b0C on a candy thermometer. Have ready one or two platters lined with paper towels.",
      "Using the spatula, carefully lower the doughnuts into the hot oil. Cook only as many doughnuts as will fit comfortably in your pan, allowing some space between them so that they can fry all the way around. As you place the doughnuts in the oil, the oil will start to foam-this means that the doughnuts are cooking. Fry the doughnuts until brown on one side, about 40 seconds, then turn and fry until the doughnuts are brown on the second side, and puffed and golden, about 20 seconds. With tongs, remove the doughnuts from the oil and place on the paper towels to drain. Allow the oil to return to 375\u00b0F/190\u00b0C, and repeat until all the doughnuts are fried. Be sure to monitor the oil so that the temperature remains constant; you may need to adjust the heat as you fry each batch. You don't want the oil to go above 380\u00b0F/193\u00b0C, because the doughnuts will burn before they are cooked through.",
      "Set a wire rack over a cookie sheet. Place the remaining 1/2 cup/100 g sugar in a bowl. Gently roll each warm doughnut in the sugar until coated. Set on the rack to cool completely.",
      "Doughnuts made with yeasted dough are best eaten the day they are fried. Only make as many as you plan to eat that day. The dough may be stored in the refrigerator for up to 2 days."

Drizzle with olive oil, then season with salt and pepper and sear all over, including the ends, in a hot, heavy-based skillet lightly coated with olive oil - about 2 to 3 minutes. Meanwhile set out your prosciutto on a sheet of plastic wrap (plastic needs to be about a 1-1/2 feet in length) on top of your cutting board. Shingle the prosciutto so it forms a rectangle that is big enough to accommodate the filet of beef. Use a rubber spatula to cover evenly with a thin layer of duxelles. Season the surface of the duxelles with salt and pepper and sprinkle with fresh thyme leaves. Remove beef from heat, cut off twine and smear lightly all over with Dijon mustard. Allow to cool slightly, then roll up using the plastic wrap to tie it up. Tuck in the ends of the prosciutto as you roll to completely encompass the beef. Roll it up tightly in plastic wrap and twist the ends to seal it completely and hold it in a nice log shape. Set in the refrigerator for 30 minutes. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. On a lightly floured surface, roll the puff pastry out to a 1/4-inch thickness. You may have to overlap 2 sheets and press them together. Remove beef from refrigerator and cut off plastic. Set the beef in the center of the pastry and fold over the longer sides, brushing with egg wash to seal. Trim ends if necessary then brush with with egg wash and fold over to completely seal the beef. Top with coarse sea salt. Place the beef seam side down on a baking sheet. Brush the top of the pastry with egg wash then make a couple of slits on top.Bake for 40 to 45 minutes or 125 F internal temp."

When oil ripples or whisps of smoke start to appear, brown the floured turkey legs 7-8 minutes total, in batches if necessary, careful not to over-crowd the pot, as this will inhibit even browning. Remove turkey from the pot and set aside. Pour off any excess grease left in the pot. Add 1 Tbsp olive oil and butter to pot. Add carrots, celery, onions and garlic and sweat for 2-3 minutes until softened. Add oregano, thyme, paprika, pepper flakes, cayenne pepper and stir till fragrant about 1-2 minutes. Deglaze with red wine, scraping off any accumulated brown bits on the bottom of the pot. Add the chicken broth, Worcestershire sauce and dried cranberries. Season with salt and pepper. Line the rim of the dutch oven with aluminum foil to form a tight seal preventing steam from escaping, and cover with lid. Place the pot in the oven and braise for about an hour or until turkey is tender. Remove turkey from the braising liquid. When cool enough to handle, remove meat from the bones, careful to remove all tendons and connective tissue. Return pot over high heat and reduce braising liquid until slighty thick.

You may need to add 1 to 2 additional tablespoons of flour, but resist the urge to add more; the dough should be quite soft and rich. You won't be able to knead it as long as other yeast doughs, but try to get it to a point where it's no longer too sticky and can be formed into a ball.",

Starting from the other long side, roll up the dough. Using a sharp bench scraper, cut the roll of dough in half lengthwise, leaving about 1 inch/2.5cm at one end still attached. Working quickly, twist the 2 strands around each other all the way down the length of the roll. Then form the wrapped dough strands into a circle. Next, slice through the end that you left attached and tuck the end pieces at both ends underneath each other to make a neat closure.",
      "Transfer the wreath to the prepared pan (you may need someone to help you do this) and bake for 45 minutes at the second-lowest rack position, rotating halfway through. When finished, the loaf will be golden brown all over and should sound slightly hollow when tapped. It will still be quite soft.",

      "When the wreath has almost fully cooled, sift the confectioners' sugar into a small bowl and whisk in the water. Whisk until smooth and lump-free. You want a thick but pourable glaze. Add more sugar or a drop more water as needed. Drizzle the glaze back and forth over the entire wreath. Wait 1 hour for the glaze to set and the cake to cool completely and then slice and serve. The cake is best eaten the day it is made, but it can be kept at room temperature, loosely wrapped in plastic wrap, for 2 additional days."
