      "Preheat oven to 400\u00b0.",
      "Why? Cranking up the oven temperature caramelizes the vegetables' outer layer. If too high, the interior won't fully cook; if too low, the vegetables won't brown well. Roasting temperatures will range between 375\u00b0 for larger items and 450\u00b0 for smaller items.",
      "Scrub carrots, and dry well; peel, if desired. Why? The goal is a dry roasting environment. Excess moisture can make outer surfaces mushy and inhibit browning. Peeling is a matter of choice: Some peels taste bitter.",
      "Arrange carrots in a single layer, well spaced on a baking sheet. Why? Roast similar types and sizes of vegetables together so everything cooks at the same rate. To encourage caramelization, make sure each vegetable sits directly on the sheet pan, and allow room for heat to circulate.",
      "Drizzle with oil, turning to coat all over. Sprinkle with salt and pepper.",
      "Why? A light coating of oil promotes browning and prevents sticking. But go easy: Too much oil will just soak into porous vegetables, or pool and \"fry\" nonporous ones. Avoid using butter, which can burn.",
      "Tightly cover pan with foil. Bake at 400\u00b0 for 10 minutes. Uncover and return pan to oven; bake an additional 18 minutes or until carrots are tender, turning once.",
      "Why? Covering the pan creates a mini oven within the oven and speeds up roasting. It's essential to remove the foil early on to prevent buildup of steam from the vegetables' own juices."

Add wine and thyme; cook until liquid almost evaporates.",

      "Wine note: I like the thought of serving a sparkling wine with Farro Risotto with Mushrooms--the bubbles match the texture of the grain. Prosecco has become a popular aperitif, but this Soligo Prosecco ($12) is fuller bodied than most, so it stands up well to food. With its vibrant stone fruit flavors, it contrasts pleasantly with the earthy character of the mushrooms that dominate this dish. --Gary Vaynerchuck"

It kills the yeast, and the dough will never proof.\" On low speed, gradually spoon flour mixture into yeast solution and mix until dough is elastic, fairly smooth, and you can pull it cleanly off the dough hook, 15 minutes (you may need to add up to 1 cup more flour if it's too sticky). To mix by hand, stir flour mixture into yeast until well combined. Knead in the bowl until a ball of dough forms, sprinkling in more flour as needed to keep dough from sticking to your hands. Turn out onto a floured work surface and knead vigorously until dough is elastic and fairly smooth, about 15 minutes. Tuck edges of dough under to form a tight ball.",

If it isn't, slide it back onto floured work surface, sprinkle peel with a bit more flour, and drag pizza back onto peel. \"We don't make the pizza right on the peel. You need too much flour to keep it from sticking, and the flour goes into the oven, burns, and gets bitter.\"",
      "Jiggle pizza onto pizza stone as you pull peel out from underneath. Bake until crust is puffed and charred in spots, 7 to 10 minutes. Transfer to a wooden board, finish with remaining toppings, if any, and serve immediately.",

Before stretching, replace plastic with a wet towel and let rise at room temperature until almost doubled in size. Frozen, up to 1 month: Freeze dough balls until hard and then wrap each well.
