Add both to bowl, along with brown sugar and salt; mix to blend. Rub generously all over brisket, including in the pocket and on the sides. \"You have to really pack it on. If you have leftover rub, use it for pork chops.\" Let meat come to room temperature, about 1 hour.",

Make it big enough to extend a foot beyond your cooking grate in all directions. Build a brick rectangle 3 layers high, leaving a couple of bricks out of the top layer on opposite sides, to encourage airflow. (For a standard 21-in. round Weber grate, the rectangle should be 2 bricks by 3 bricks.) Fill with about an inch of sand.",
      "Light the fire: Put several balled-up sheets of newspaper in the center and position kindling into a tipi around it; lean larger kindling and then 5 to 6 small logs (preferably oak). Light the fire. \"The tipi lets every bit of flame go up past 3 or 4 logs,\" says Chiarello, so the fire starts fast. Once the logs have caught, add several larger logs to the perimeter. Let them burn down to ashy chunks with low flames (1 1/2 to 2 hours). Because there's less smoke and char than cooking over a flaming fire, Chiarello says, \"it makes your food taste much cleaner, gives nuanced flavor, and is better for wine.\"",

Open vent holes on grill lid; close lid, and grill until fish flakes easily with a fork and a thermometer inserted in thickest portion registers 140\u00b0F, 7 to 9 minutes.",

      "HEARTH-FIRED HACK",
      "With any charcoal grill, you can achieve the same smoky results preferred by chefs such as Charleston's Sean Brock. Just follow these steps.",
      "1. Choose your wood. Heavier hardwoods (oak, hickory) work better for spicy dishes and rich meats (beef or pork). For this menu, you'll want something lighter (fruit, nut, alder).",
      "2. Use a 50/50 ratio when combining the charcoal and hardwood.",
      "3. Light wood and charcoal in a chimney starter, and cluster toward one side of the grill.",
      "4. Maintain an internal temp-erature between 500\u00b0 and 550\u00b0 by adjusting the grill vents."
