Leave for 1 hour, then chill for at least 4 hours, or overnight. Cheesecakes can crack when chilled, but don't worry if it does - you can cover them with the rhubarb.",

Soak the sheet of gelatine in cold water for a few minutes until it softens, squeeze the water out and add the gelatine to the rhubarb. Gently heat until the gelatine melts and the rhubarb is tender (about another 3 minutes). Pour the mixture over the chilled cheesecake and chill for 1 1/2 hours to set. Cut into slices and serve with some mint, if you like."

If you really want to use dried flowers as part of the gift you can place them in muslin and make little \"tea bags\" to add to bath, this way they aren't stuck to you when you exit the bath!

I have not tried white, yellow, or green onions yet, so I cannot say if they will be effective. And if you have blue onions, call me)."

Gradually add the sugar mixture and beat until creamy and smooth (1 to 2 minutes). Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well (about 30 seconds) after each addition. Scrape down the sides of the bowl and beat in the vanilla extract and pumpkin puree.",

Pour the sour cream mixture over the top of the baked cheesecake and rotate the pan slightly to evenly distribute the topping. Return the cheesecake to the oven and bake about 8 minutes to set the topping. Remove from oven and place on a wire rack to cool. Loosen the cake from the pan by running a sharp knife around the inside edge (this will help prevent the cake from cracking). Then place a piece of aluminum foil over the top of the pan so the cheesecake will cool slowly. When completely cooled, cover and refrigerate at least eight hours, preferably overnight, before serving."

      "2. Start your grill, and get it to a medium - medium / low heat, Or, build a fire on one side, and place the meat on the other. You'll be roasting this Eye Round, and it will be there a long time, so you don't want to burn it.",
      "I use a small charcoal grill, and can't cook using an indirect heat method, so I sprinkle a little water on the coals to cool them down before I place the meat on the grill.",
      "3. Cook for about 1 hour and 20 minutes, rolling it around every 20 minutes or so. Test the temperature with an instant read meat thermometer for 110 degrees, for medium rare. If you've got a grill like mine, you might want to test it in a couple of different places. Cooking time will change based upon how hot your grill is, and the thickness of the meat. Just because a meat is larger by pounds, doesn't always mean that it will cook much longer. Generally, even though it weighs more, it's still just as thick as one that's a little less weight, and will cook in the same amount of time.",
      "4. When the meat is done, place it on a platter, and cover with aluminum foil, this let's the juices redistribute, and finishes cooking the inside.",
      "5. To Serve:",
      "Slice this as thin as you can, it's not the most tender piece of meat, so you want to keep it from being too tough."
