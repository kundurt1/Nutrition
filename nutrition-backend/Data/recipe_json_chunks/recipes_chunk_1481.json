      "Water: 147.21 grams",
      "Instant dry yeast: Half of the 1/4 teaspoon",
      "Take one of your glad containers, tare it on the digital scale, and measure out (as closely as possible,) 147.21 grams of distilled water.",
      "In a separate container or bowl, measure out 147.21 grams of flour.",
      "Add instant dry yeast (IDY, half of 1/4 of a teaspoon) to flour and mix to disperse.",
      "Add flour and IDY mixture to water in increments, stirring with spatula.",
      "Once water and flour mixture have been evenly combined into a thick batter with spatula, get as much of what's stuck on the spatula into the container, cover, and let sit on counter for 3 to 4 hours until the mixture begins to lightly bubble.",
      "Place container in refrigerator until your ready to make the final dough. This will probably keep about 3 days.",

      "Dissolve salt in the water.",
      "Take a bowl, put some olive oil on a paper towel, and wipe around the bottom and sides. Set aside...it's important for later.",
      "Take two Glad containers, and do the same thing.",
      "Take a bowl, and put some of the measured flour and IDY mixture in the bottom and on the sides. The preferment will absorb this and it will help prevent sticking to the bottom.",
      "With a spatula, scrape and empty the preferment into the bowl on top of the flour.",
      "Add in all of the water mixture (It doesn't look like a lot, but trust me, it's the right amount.)",
      "Add about half the remaining and mix (do not knead.)",
      "Let this sit for 10 to 20 minutes. The flour needs to hydrate or it will not mix well.",
      "Begin adding flour in increments and stirring/kneading.",
      "If it begins feeling overly dry, let it rest for 5 minutes.",
      "Continue until all of the flour mixture is added. It's going to look like there's way too much flour. It will feel dry, and you might even feel like you messed up the dough. Keep kneading, and you will see the dough start to come together. It will get a little stickier, begin forming more of a ball, and take in the rest of the flour. Basically, it will look slightly moist. It's easier in a Kitchen Aid mixer, but you'll see it if kneading by hand as well.",
      "Take the giant dough ball, put it in the lightly oiled bowl, and let it rest for 5 to 10 minutes.",
      "While this is resting, very lightly flour your counter or a plate and get your glad containers ready.",
      "Put the rested ball on the counter, take a knife, and press it through right in the middle and give it a little tilt sideways to cut the dough into even portions without slicing through it",
      "Take each piece, ball the dough, and place it in the sealable plastic containers and cover.",
      "Place the plastic containers in the refrigerator until the next day.",
      "Remove the dough 2 hours prior to when you intend to make the pizza. For example, if you want to make the pizza at 5, take it out of the refrigerator at 3.",
      "Place your stone on the lowest rack in your oven. Optional, place a rack in the upper-middle position of the oven.",
      "Preheat for an hour at 550 degrees. This means once the oven has hit 550, let it heat for an hour...not an hour from turning it to the 550 setting.",
      "While the oven preheats, get your sauce and toppings ready.",
      "When you're ready to cook, stretch the dough to 12\" and top on the pizza peel.",
      "Open the oven door quickly, slide your pizza on the stone, and close as soon as possible.",
      "Let it cook, without turning, for about 7 minutes. Turning is not necessary, and repeatedly opening the oven door will suck out heat.",
      "Turn on the broiler about 3-4 minutes into cooking. The pizza will have been cooking on the stone for about 5-6 minutes by the time the broiler is preheated. Place the pizza on the upper middle rack and let the broiler heat brown the top for 1 to 2 minutes if you need more color. The rack will be far enough from the broiler so the cheese will not be nuked or burned."

Mix the miso, mirin, and sake into a smooth paste. If you are running short on sake and mirin, you may replace the sake with white wine or vermouth, and the mirin with sugar. Use about 4 tablespoons of sugar.",
      "Generously lather your fish or meat with the miso marinade, making sure that it clings to the meat or seafood.",
      "Refrigerate for at least five hours and up to two days! This is a handy step in the process, because you can prepare the ingredients well in advance. However, do not leave the items marinating for too long, or else they will dry out and become too salty.",
      "Before cooking, wipe all of the marinade from the seafood or meat. Do not rinse, but blot dry with paper towels.",
      "Pan-fry, broil, or grill the miso-marinated item. If using fish, seek out a slab with the skin still attached. Heat a skillet and add a tablespoon of oil. Place the fish, skin side down, on the skillet and cook until the skin is crisp, about two to three minutes. Pan-fry the other sides until golden brown. Proceed similarly with steak, adjusting the cooking times to how well-done you like your beef. For scallops, cook until the center is barely done (or, for sashimi-grade scallops, leave the center raw). Be aware when cooking that the sugar content in the mirin will cause the food to brown very easily, so you do not need to preheat your skillet for a long time. Serve with a high-quality Japanese short-grain rice."

With an electric mixer, cream butter with brown sugar until light and fluffy, scraping down the sides of the bowl occasionally. Add egg white and beat with butter mixture, scraping down sides occasionally, until mixture is smooth, glossy and homogeneous. Using a spice mill or small food processor, grind the cereal to a fine powder. Combine cereal with remaining crust ingredients and whisk to thoroughly distribute. Add half of this dry mixture to the butter mixture, and mix to just incorporate. Scrape around the sides and bottom of the mixing bowl, then add the remaining dry mixture. Mix just to incorporate. Dough will be rather moist and sticky.",
      "Turn the dough out onto a sheet of parchment or waxed paper. Lightly moisten hands with cold water and gently pat the dough into a thick, even circle. Lay a second sheet of parchment or waxed paper over the dough circle and roll the dough into a circle 12- to 13-inch circle. Slide the dough, with paper attached, onto the back of a baking tray and refrigerate until dough is firm. Peel the paper off of the top surface of the dough. Invert dough and carefully center over a drop-bottom, 1-inch deep, 9-inch diameter tart pan before carefully peeling away second layer of paper. With lightly moistened fingers gently ease the dough down into the pan, taking care to press dough completely into corners and fluting. Wipe fingers and remoisten as necessary to keep dough from sticking to them. Trim excess dough to patch any cracks that may occur. Once pan is fully lined and all cracks have been sealed, refrigerate the tart shell for one hour. (Dough or unbaked shell may be refrigerated, tightly wrapped, for up to three days.)",
      "Preheat oven to 425\u00b0F. Place refrigerated pan lined with dough onto a baking sheet and bake for 12 minutes. Rotate shell once during baking. Gently press down any significant bubbles that occur during baking with the back of a flat spatula, taking care not to cause cracks in the crust. Cool shell completely.",
      "For carrot topping: In a small sauce pan, combine butter, honey, salt and spice. Heat over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally to keep honey from scorching, until mixture begins to bubble. Add shredded carrot, stirring well to evenly distribute the honey mixture. Remove pan from the heat and leave carrot mixture in pan to cool and release juices while preparing the filling.",
      "For the filling: Combine sugar, flour and salt. Add egg and whisk to thoroughly blend. Add yolk, followed by melted butter, lemon juice and extract, whisking between each addition to blend. Add buttermilk half a cup at a time, whisking well between each addition until mixture is homogeneous.",
      "To finish: Place the cooled, pre-baked tart shell on a foil-lined baking sheet on the extended oven rack. Pour in the tart filling up to the inner edge of the shell (there may be a little excess, depending on shell shrinkage). Carefully slide the rack back into the oven, taking care not to slop the filling. Bake at 425\u00b0F for 7 minutes.",
      "Meanwhile, turn cooled carrot mixture into a strainer set over a bowl. Squeeze and press the carrot to extract as much juice as possible. Pour the drained juices back into the sauce pan, and set the drained carrot aside. Rotate the tart carefully and bake for another 7 minutes.",
      "In the meantime, reduce reserved carrot juices over medium-high heat, stirring often, until thickened and beginning to caramelize. Pour into a bowl, and set aside to cool.",
      "Very lightly sprinkle the shredded carrot over the surface of the filling. Turn the oven temperature down to 350\u00b0F, and continue to bake the tart for an additional 6 to 8 minutes, until a knife inserted into the center of the tart comes out clean.",
      "Serve warm or cool. Right before serving, drizzle the tart with the reduced carrot juices. The tart is best eaten the day it is made.",
      "* Five-Spice is a wonderfully fragrant spice blend, common to Chinese savory cooking, but I've found it to be valuable for sweet cooking as well. 5-Spice blends vary, but generally contain some permutation of cinnamon, clove, fennel, anise seed, star anise, Sichuan pepper, and sometimes ginger. If you do not have 5-Spice, you may substitute any one or a blend of the typical 5-Spice components to suit your tastes."

The mixture will look like wet sand. Add the egg yolk and continue to mix on low speed for about 30 seconds, or until the dough comes together.",

Remove the dough from the refrigerator and let soften at room temperature for about 30 minutes. Using a rolling pin, bang and flatten the dough into a disk about 1/2 inch thick. Flour the work surface, and then sprinkle the dough disk with a little flour. Roll out the dough into a circle 10 to 11 inches in diameter and about 1/4 inch thick for a 9-inch pie shell, or about 12 inches in diameter and just under 1/4 inch thick for a 10-inch tart shell. Make sure the work surface is well floured so the dough doesn't stick to it, and make sure the disk itself is floured well enough to keep the rolling pin from sticking to it. Roll from the center of the disk outward, and gently rotate the disk a quarter turn after each roll to ensure the disk is evenly stretched into a nice circle. Don't worry if the dough breaks a bit, especially toward the edges. You can easily patch any tears once you have lined the pan.",
      "Roll the dough circle around the pin and then unfurl it on top of the 9-inch pie pan or the 10-inch tart ring. Press the dough well into the bottom and sides of the pan or ring, and use any scraps or odd pieces to patch up any tears or missing bits. Make sure the entire interior is well covered with dough, and then press one last time all the way around to ensure any holes have been patched. Trim the edge of the dough so it is even with the rim of the pan or ring.",

Pour the hot cream mixture over the chocolate and let sit for about 1 minute, then whisk gently until the chocolate is completely melted and the mixture is smooth. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a small container, stir in the salt, cover tightly, and refrigerate for at least 8 hours, or until it is absolutely, completely chilled, or up to 3 days. A few hours is not enough here. Because the cream has been heated, it will not whip properly unless it is very cold.",

If any sugar crystals are clinging to the sides of the pan, brush them down with a pastry brush dipped in water. Place the pan over high heat and leave it undisturbed until the mixture comes to a rolling boil. (You want to avoid crystallization of the syrup, which can happen if the pan is disturbed before the sugar starts to color.) Then continue to boil rapidly without moving the pan until the sugar syrup starts to caramelize. This will take 3 to 4 minutes: the sugar syrup will boil furiously; then as it thickens, it will boil more languidly; and then you will see some of the syrup starting to color and darken around the edge of the pan.",
      "When you see color in the pan, gently swirl it in a circular motion so the sugar caramelizes evenly. The syrup will start to turn golden brown, and then as you swirl the pan, the syrup will continue to get a bit darker and then darker still. To check the true color of the caramel, tilt the pan so you can see the syrup covering the bottom. This is the actual color of the caramel, and you want to keep cooking the caramel until this layer is a deep amber-brown. It takes just seconds for caramel to go from great to burnt, so be sure to tilt and check constantly.",
      "As soon as the caramel is ready, slowly add the cream and then reduce the heat to low. Be careful, because the steam that rises when the cream hits the caramel is extremely hot. Let the caramel and cream sputter for a few seconds until the mixture settles down, and then whisk to mix in the cream. Turn the heat up to medium and whisk together the caramel and cream (the mixture will have hardened a bit) for 2 to 3 minutes, or until they come together. Whisk in the butter, salt, and vanilla.",
      "Remove from the heat, pour into an airtight heatproof container, and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or up to 1 week.",

Using a stand mixer fitted with the whip attachment (or a handheld mixer or a whisk), whip the mousse on medium speed until it holds soft peaks. Mound the mousse in the shell, and spread it evenly over the caramel filling. Drizzle the remaining one-fourth caramel filling in a crisscross pattern on top of the mousse. Using the back of a small knife or a vegetable peeler, shave curls from the milk chocolate slab. (Make sure the chocolate is slightly warm, or you will get splinters instead of curls.)",
      "Decorate the pie with the curls.",

This procedure will not only allow the dumpling to adhere and keep its shape, but will also steam the wrapper itself while the dumplings are in the oven. It's a messy job, but if you want French Onion Soup Dumplings, you've got to do it.",

Keep making dumplings until you have packed both gratin dishes.",

      "the ingredients. Ready to be mixed by hand.",
      "The recipe makes enough for two loaves. I only had on loaf pan, so I baked the one on the left and placed its less-fortunate, not-to-be-cooked \"meathunk\" in a Ziplock bag for cooking tomorrow.",
      "The recipe says to mix by hand but not to overdo it. Overmixing yields a tough meatloaf. I don't think I overmixed it.",
      "The recipe makes enough for two loaves. I only had on loaf pan, so I baked the one on the left and placed its less-fortunate, not-to-be-cooked \"meathunk\" in a Ziplock bag for cooking tomorrow.",
      "One of the biggest struggles I have with meatloaf is keeping it from crumbling. Would mine hold together?",
      "No! It crumbled. Dagnabbit! I don't think I mixed thoroughly enough to distribute the torn bread and eggs as binder. I also will use finer breadcrumbs in the future. What I used were closer to nibblets you'd feed birds. So this looked good as a *loaf* but disintegrated at the touch of the knife. My failed attempt at meatloaf reminded me of that *other* Meatloaf-the fat singin' dude. Has Weird Al done a parody song sung to the tune of \"I Would Do Anything for Love\"? ... \"I would eat anything for lunch. Yes, I would eat anything for lunch. But I won't eat that\" Hmm ... The truth is, I did eat the meatloaf, even crumbly....",
      "My solution was to use \"post-bake binding agents,\" aka two slices of bread. Which was fine, because I was able to move on to my favorite thing about meatloaf anywaythe Leftover-Meatloaf Sandwich. Bonus: This one was warm, right out of the oven. While this meatloaf made the office smell great, nobody except me seemed to really dig in. Silence told me all I needed to know. This meatloaf was most assuredly not serious eats.",
      "The following day, I decided to make the second loaf. I had dropped the second ball of meatloaf mixture into a large Ziploc bag and refrigerated it. So, about an hour and a half before lunchtime, I grabbed it, let it sit outside the fridge to warm up a bit and then, remembering the disastrous first attempt, I mixed this loaf a little more. With only half the meat, there was room in the bowl to mix it easily. Anyway. Here's a picture of the toaster oven I've been using. She's a beaut, ain't she?"

Put the yeast, water and sugar into a medium bowl and stir to combine. Set aside until it begins to get foamy, about 5 minutes. Add the milk and egg, and beat lightly to break up the egg and combine it all.",
      "Put the flour and salt into your food processor, and pulse to distribute the salt. Cut each stick of butter into tablespoon-sized pieces, then cut each of those pieces in half. Put all of the pieces into the food processor with the flour and pulse about 10 times to distribute the butter and break the chunks just a little. You don't want small pieces as you would for pie crust; larger chunks are preferable.",
      "Add the flour and butter to the liquid in the bowl, and fold gently with a spatula until all the flour is moistened and it is well combined, being careful not to break up the butter. The butter should still be fairly hard at this point. The dough will be very wet; don't worry about it. Cover the bowl and refrigerate overnight.",
      "The mixture can be used the next day, or kept refrigerated for an additional day if you aren't ready for it. When you are ready, flour your work surface generously, and have more flour standing ready. Turn the dough out onto your work surface, sprinkle some additional flour over the top, and form it into a rough square. Working quickly, roll the dough out to an approximate 16-inch square. Because it's so wet, it should roll easily, but it might be a bit sticky. Add flour as needed on top and underneath to keep it from sticking. Fold the dough in thirds, like a letter.",
      "Then fold it in thirds again, to make a square. Do the same roll-and-fold two more times. As you work, keep the work surface lightly floured, just to keep it from sticking. Since the dough is so soft, you should be able to do this fast enough that the butter won't get too soft and squishy. If you get delayed and the butter does soften, put it in the fridge and continue once the butter has firmed up again. After the last fold, flatten it a bit, then put it into a plastic bag and put it into the refrigerator for at least an hour, or up to three days.",
      "When you are ready to make the croissants, preheat the oven to 400 degrees and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. The dough will have risen while refrigerated. Cut the dough into quarters.",
      "Roll the first quarter into about a 6-inch square. Cut the square into quarters diagonally.",
      "Take one of your right triangles of dough and roll or stretch it into a pie-shaped wedge at least seven inches long. You can make it longer if the dough is thick enough to allow it, but at least seven inches will give you enough length to have attractive wraps.",
      "Starting at the wide end, roll the dough toward the the point.",
      "Place the finished croissants on the prepared baking sheet with the point underneath. Curl the dough into a crescent shape.",
      "Cover them with plastic wrap and set aside for 30 minutes. They won't rise much at all, but they should feel puffy instead of firm. Brush the croissants with an egg wash, if desired, or leave them plain. Bake at 400 degrees for 20 minutes, until they are golden brown. Remove to a rack to cool.",
      "Variation: For chocolate croissants, follow the original recipe though Step 6, then roll the quarter of dough into a rectangle about 10 x 6 inches. Cut that into strips about 2 1/2 inches wide x 6 inches long.",
      "Put your favorite chocolate at one end, and roll up. It works best to make sure the dough is just a little wider than the chocolate and fold it over to enclose the chocolate when you start rolling, so it doesn't seep out during baking. Place the rolls seam-side down on the pan and allow them to rise and bake as in the original recipe."

      "In the morning, take the doughs out of the refrigerator, open the bags to release the air, gently knead the dough while still in the bag and flatten it, seal the bags and let them rest on the counter for an hour. For more even warming, don't stack them on top of each other.",
      "After an hour, flour your work surface, preheat the oven to 350 degrees, and line three baking sheets with parchment paper. Turn out the first dough, knead it briefly to incorporate the oil and divide the dough into thirds. Form each third into a log. Do the same with the second and third doughs.",
      "Now, take each log and roll it out into a rope about 14-16 inches long. Try to make them all the same length. Take one log of each type of dough and braid it. It's easiest to do this if you pinch the doughs together on one end first, before you begin the braid. Don't braid tightly - the dough needs room to rise. Also, look at the ropes and have the prettiest side facing up when you braid.",
      "When you finish the braid, pinch the end to seal, then fold both ends under the dough. Place the dough on one of the prepared baking sheets, arrange it so that it's even, cover with plastic wrap, and set aside to rise until double, about 30 minutes.",

Reduce the heat to medium low and let the vegetables sweat in their own juices another 8 to 10 minutes, until they're very soft. Add the cabbage and cavolo nero, season with another 2 teaspoons of the salt, and cook to wilt the cabbages slightly, about 2 minutes. Reduce the heat to low, add 1/2 cup of the remaining olive oil, and cook without stirring until the juices released from the vegetables have boiled down and the pan is almost dry, about 15 minutes. Break the tomatoes up into the pan. Add the Parmigiano- Reggiano rind(s), and 1 cup of water, and cook the soup at a low simmer for 21/2 to 3 hours, adding another cup of water from time to time so the vegetables are always barely covered with water, until the root vegetables are very tender but not disintegrated.

Pulse in the almond extract and run the machine until the mixture begins to form large, moist clumps.

The dough may be refrigerated overnight or frozen for up to 1 month; defrost in the refrigerator overnight before proceeding.",

Cut out large cookies and place on the prepared cookie sheet at least 1 inch apart. Cut out a small cookie from the center of half of the cookies. If you like, you can bake these smaller cookies together on a third pan, as baking time will be less. They will not be used in the large cookie assembly, but can be served as is, or sandwiched together with one another. Repeat with the remaining dough. You will need to reuse the pans a few times.

Have all of the large cutout \"tops\" on a jelly-roll pan. If you want a confectioners' sugar dusting, simply put that sugar in a fine-mesh strainer and dust the tops of the cookies. Alternatively, fill a parchment cone with melted chocolate, snip a small opening, and make zigzags back and forth over the cookies. Allow the chocolate to firm up.",

Remove from the pan and lay on a double fold of paper towel. Sprinkle with salt and serve without delay.

      "Combine the flour, malt powder, and kosher salt in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and blend for a few moments to mix. Form a well in the center of the flour, pour in the warm water, and scatter the yeast over, stirring it in gently. Let sit until the yeast is frothy, about 5 minutes. Add the mustard to the bowl and blend the wet and dry ingredients together at medium-low speed until a cohesive dough forms. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and knead it for 2 to 3 minutes, until smooth. (Different types of mustard have varying levels of moisture; you may need to add a bit more flour if the dough is sticky.)",
      "Transfer the dough to a lightly oiled bowl, turning the dough so it is evenly coated. Cover the bowl with a kitchen towel and set aside in a warm place until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour.",
      "Preheat the oven to 375\u00b0F. Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat. Fill a large, broad saucepan about two-thirds full with water and set it over medium heat to warm while forming the pretzels. (If the water comes to a boil before needed, reduce the heat to low.)",
      "Turn the risen dough out onto the counter and punch it down. Cut the dough into quarters, then cut each quarter into thirds, for",
      "12 pieces of relatively even size. Cover the dough pieces with a kitchen towel until needed.",
      "Roll one of the dough portions into a rope about 18 inches long. With the rope horizontal on the counter in front of you, lift up one end in each hand and draw the ends downward toward you, forming a broad loop with the ends overlapping at the bottom by about 2 inches. Cross your hands in front of you and pick up the two ends of dough, lifting them a couple inches above the counter. Cross your hands back to the left and right sides, twisting the dough as you do. Lay the dough ends up over the top of the loop, so that the twist sits in the center of the pretzel. Gently pinch the dough ends down into the loop.",
      "Set the pretzel aside, covered with a kitchen towel, while forming the remaining pretzels.",
      "When all the pretzels have been formed, adjust the heat under the water to maintain a gentle simmer. Stir in the baking soda. Gently add 3 of the pretzels and simmer for 2 minutes, turning them halfway through. Lift the pretzels with a slotted spoon or spatula and drain for a few moments over the pan, then transfer to the prepared baking sheet. Simmer the remaining pretzels in the same fashion.",
      "Beat the egg yolk with the 11/2 teaspoons water in a small dish. Brush the pretzels with the yolk mixture and sprinkle with coarse salt. Bake until golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes. Transfer the pretzels to a wire rack to cool. Arrange the pretzels in a bowl or on a platter and serve. The pretzels will be at their best the day they are made. Should you have leftovers, they can be stored in an airtight container for a day or two, then warmed gently in the oven, wrapped in foil, to soften them up a bit."

Turn the dough 90 degrees and repeat this procedure. Turn the dough 90 degrees again and repeat. For this final fold, the dough should be stiffer and more elastic.

Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 425 degrees.",

      "The first step is selecting the right kind of coconut: a mature, compact specimen with a beige to dark brown exterior. Younger coconuts have a softer, pudding-like flesh, whereas for our purposes, you'll need a coconut with firmer interior. Select a heavy coconut and shake it about: you should be able to hear the liquid moving inside.",
      "To crack the coconut open, take either a heavy cleaver or a hammer and a nail, and find one point on the coconut to hack. If you're using a cleaver, use the bottom tip and give the coconut a few heavy thwacks until a fissure forms on the shell. If you're using a hammer and a nail, place the nail in a textured groove somewhere on the shell, and hammer away until the fissure forms.",
      "Once you've punctured a whole into the coconut, release the inner juices. The coconut water should taste fresh and sweet (feel free to drink it if you like it).",
      "Separate the meat from the shell with a relatively thin paring knife, making circular motions underneath the meat.",
      "The best way to grate the coconut is to use a high quality Microplane grater, as you would for cheese. Doing so will give you fine, lacy shreds of coconut meat that are ideal for even toasting. You could also cut the coconut into 1/2-inch chunks and run them through the food processor until they are finer and fluffy, approximately 1 minute. (However, if you've got the gumption to crack open your own coconut, you hardly need a food processor once you've managed to extract all the meat!)",
      "Place the grated coconut meat in a bare (not-oiled) skillet or wok over medium heat. Toast the coconut slowly, stirring around with a spatula to evenly disperse the heat. Continue to toast until the slivers of coconut are golden brown and toasty-smelling. Some slivers may toast more slowly or quickly than other slivers; don't worry as long as the general distribution is golden brown, with perhaps a few darker and white slivers in the mix. The entire process, set over low heat, should take five to ten minutes.",
      "Transfer the toasted coconut to a bowl and allow to cool.",
      "Depending on your preferred consistency, either place the coconut meat in the food processor and pulse until it resembles sawdust (about one minute) or pound the coconut by hand in a mortar and pestle. For rendangs, I like to leave the coconut shreds lightly pounded so that their unique juiciness and texture are still recognizable once mixed into the dish. Makes several cups of kerisik."

      "Remove the dough from the mixer and check to be certain that there are no visible pieces of butter remaining; if necessary, return the dough to the mixer and mix briefly again. Pat the dough into a 7- to 8-inch disk and wrap in plastic. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour or up to a day.",
      "Lightly brush the inside of a 9-by-2-inch removable-bottom tart pan with canola oil and place it on a jelly roll pan. Place the dough on a floured work surface and rub on all sides with flour. Flatten it into a larger circle using a rolling pin or the heel of your hand. Roll the rolling pin back and forth across the dough a few times, then turn it 90 degrees and roll again. Continue to turn and roll until the dough is 1/4-inch thick and about 14 inches in diameter. (If the kitchen is hot and the dough has become very soft, move it to a baking sheet and refrigerate for a few minutes.)",
      "To lift the dough into the tart pan, place the rolling pin across the dough about one-quarter of the way up from the bottom edge, fold the bottom edge of the dough up and over the pin, and roll the dough up on the rolling pin. Lift the dough on the pin and hold it over the pan, centering it. Carefully lower the dough into the pan, pressing it gently against the sides and into the bottom. Trim any dough that extends more than an inch over the sides of the pan and reserve the scraps. Fold the excess dough over against the outside of the ring. (Preparing the quiche shell this way will prevent it from shrinking down the sides as it bakes. The excess dough will be removed after the quiche is baked.) Carefully check for any cracks or holes in the dough, and patch with the reserved dough as necessary. Place in the refrigerator or freezer for at least 20 minutes to resolidify the butter. Reserve the remaining dough scraps.",
      "Place a rack in the middle of the oven and heat the oven to 375\u00b0F. Line the quiche shell with a 15-inch round of parchment paper. Fill the shell with pie weights or dried beans, gently guiding the weights into the corners of the shell and filling the shell completely. Bake the shell until the edges of the dough are lightly browned but the bottom is still light in color, 35 to 45 minutes.",
      "Carefully remove the parchment and weights. Check the dough for any new cracks or holes and patch with thin pieces of the reserved dough if necessary. Return the shell to the oven until the bottom is a rich golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and allow the shell to cool completely on the jellyroll pan. Once again, check the dough for any cracks or holes, and patch if necessary before filling with the quiche batter.",
      "Combine the milk and cream in a large saucepan and heat over medium heat until scalded (meaning a skin begins to form on the surface). Remove from heat and set aside to cool slightly, 10 to 15 minutes.",
      "Put 3 eggs, half the milk and cream mixture, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt, 1/8 teaspoon pepper and 3 gratings of nutmeg in a blender and blend on low speed about 5 seconds to mix thoroughly, then increase the speed to high and blend until the batter is light and foamy, about 30 seconds.",
      "This is the first layer of the quiche. Once you have assembled it, add the remaining ingredients to the blender and repeat the process to complete the quiche.",
      "Bake for 1 hour, 15 minutes, until the top of the quiche is browned and the custard is set when the pan is jiggled. Remove the quiche from the oven and let stand 15 minutes before serving, or cool, then refrigerate until chilled, at least 1 day, or up to 3 days.",
      "Once the quiche is thoroughly chilled, using a metal bench scraper or a sharp knife, scrape away the excess crust from the top edge. Place a large bowl upside down on a work surface and place the quiche pan on top of that. Gently remove the outside ring, working it free in spots with a small knife if necessary. Return to the refrigerator until ready to serve.",
      "To serve, heat the oven to 375\u00b0F. Line a baking sheet with lightly oiled parchment paper. Using a long serrated knife, and supporting the sides of the crust with your opposite hand, carefully cut through the edge of the crust in a sawing motion. Switch to a long slicing knife and cut through the custard and bottom crust. Repeat, cutting the quiche into 8 to 10 pieces. Place the pieces on the baking sheet and reheat for 15 minutes or until hot throughout. To check, insert a metal skewer into the quiche for several seconds and then touch the skewer to your lip to test the temperature of the quiche."

As soon as they begin to pop, toss or stir them vigorously and constantly to avoid burning the seeds at the bottom. Continue toasting until the seeds are fragrant and golden brown, about 5 minutes. Immediately transfer the seeds to a metal colander or large sieve (do not leave them in the skillet: residual heat can burn the seeds at the bottom). Outdoors, or in a place where you don't mind making a bit of mess, briskly toss the seeds in the colander to shake off the papery skins.",

Stop the motor and use a spatula to scrape the powder back into the bowl. Process another 2-3 minutes. Scrape the bowl down again and process until you see very little movement of the powder (the clumping action is a result of the oils being released from the seeds). Taste a bit of the powder: it should have a pleasant texture but not be grainy. If it's grainy, process a minute or two more. Set aside.",
      "Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Plunge the chaya into the boiling water, reduce the heat to medium and cook, uncovered, for 20 minutes. Transfer the chaya to a colander, press out as much liquid as possible (too much moisture will make the masa soggy), and allow it to cool. Coarsely chop the chaya and combine it with the masa in a large mixing bowl. Knead the chaya into the dough until it is thoroughly incorporated.",

Do not peel away the leaf; rather, continue to roll the tamal into a log shape. Tuck the ends under and pack and compress the log into a tight loaf. (Note: Make sure to check the size of your steamer; if the tamal is too large, you may pack and form the loaf to be smaller without ruining it.)",

Do, though, make sure that the oil is hot enough: without the fizzing, it won't generate the rich, roasty fragrance you need. If you pour all the oil on to the chillies, then discover it's not quite hot enough, you can return the whole lot to a saucepan and heat gently until it smells fabulous and the color is a deep ruby red, but do take care as not to burn the chillies. (The chillies will seethe and fizz like a witch's cauldron as you heat them, releasing the most marvellous aromas, but can easily start to burn and blacken.)",
      "When the oil has cooled completely, decant it and the chilli sediment into jars and store in a dark, cool place. Leave it to settle for at least a day before using."

Put the sauce over moderate heat again and, whisking slowly, boil for 15 seconds. Scrape the sauce into the bowl of a food processor.",
      "Add the hard-boiled yolks, mustard, salt, vinegar, and lemon juice to the machine. Process 15 seconds-long enough to be sure the yolks are well incorporated, so that they will create the emulsion. Then, with the machine running, begin adding the oil in droplets. When the emulsion is established (which should happen after about 1/3 cup oil has gone in), add the oil in a thin stream of droplets. When as much oil as you wish has gone in and the sauce is thick and glossy, taste analytically for seasoning, adding salt, pepper, etc. as you feel them needed.",
      "Store the sauce in a covered container in the refrigerator; it will keep for at least a week.",

Whisk a spoonful of it into a spoonful of mustard or of crushed hard-boiled egg yolk. When the spoonful of mayonnaise and mustard or yolk are smoothly combined, start whisking in the broken sauce bit by bit. Eventually it will turn thick and glossy and beautiful as ever. But, I discovered, it will still weep some oil and get a little grainy as it rests. (Harold McGee tells us that throughout time and around the world, versions of mayonnaise have been made with bechamel sauce, hard-boiled egg yolks, cooked potato, garlic, bread, and fresh cheese, but that \"None of these ingredients is as effective at emulsifying and stabilizing as a raw egg yolk, so they will emulsify less oil and the sauces will tend to leak some free oil.\") If this happens-leaky oil and slight graininess, as opposed to a completely liquefied sauce-just whisk the mayonnaise before eating, and it should firm up nicely enough."

      "In a very large bowl, thoroughly stir together the white flour, 2 cups of the rye flour, the salt, caraway seeds, anise seeds, and yeast. In another bowl or measuring cup, whisk the molasses and the oil into the water until well blended. Vigorously stir the mixture into the bowl with the flours, scraping down the bowl sides and mixing until the dough is well blended and smooth. If too dry to mix completely, a bit at a time, add in enough more ice water to blend the ingredients and yield a firm but not hard-to-stir dough. Brush or evenly spray the top with oil. Tightly cover the bowl with plastic wrap. If desired, for best flavor or for convenience, you can refrigerate the dough for 3 to 10 hours. Then let rise at cool room temperature for 12 to 18 hours.",

Gradually stir the milk mixture, then 1/2 cup of the rye flour, into the dough until well blended and no streaks remain; the mixture will be hard to stir, so you may prefer to work in the flour with well-oiled fingertips (or use a dough hook and heavy-duty mixer on low). If necessary, working in the bowl, lift and turn it while dusting with and smoothing in more rye flour, as the dough should be very stiff. Cut the dough in half with well-oiled kitchen shears. Put the dough portions in two 8 1/2x 4 1/2-inch well-oiled loaf pans. Lightly brush the tops with some of the remaining melted butter. Smooth and press the dough evenly into the pans, tucking it under at the ends. Brush with more butter. Cover the tops with nonstick spray-coated plastic wrap.",

Bake for about 10 minutes longer to ensure the centers are done. Brush the loaf tops evenly with the remaining melted butter. Cool in the pans on a wire rack for 10 to 15 minutes. Run a knife around the loaves to loosen, then turn out onto the racks. Let cool thoroughly.",

    "title": "baking with dorie: a cobbler to coo over recipe",
    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "Center a rack in the oven and preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Butter a 9-inch deep-dish pie plate and put it on a baking sheet lined with foil, parchment paper or a silicone baking mat.",
      "Whisk the flour, baking powder, sugar and salt together in a big bowl. Drop in the butter and, with your fingers, toss everything together to coat the butter with flour. Working quickly, rub the butter into the dry ingredients until you have a pebbly mixture. You'll have pieces the size of peas and others the size of oatmeal flakes and that's just right.",
      "Pour the cream over the mixture, grab a fork and gently turn the ingredients until you have a very soft dough. You'll probably have some dry ingredients in the bottom of the bowl, so reach in and mix and knead the dough with your hands until it's all blended. This is the show-restraint point-don't overdo it. If you've got a few dry spots, it's OK.",
      "Turn the dough out onto a piece of wax paper or plastic wrap, cover with another sheet of paper or wrap and gently press or roll the dough into a circle with a diameter of about 9 inches. Don't worry about being exact or about getting even edges - this is a homey dessert and any roughness will only add to its charms. Refrigerate the dough while you put together the fruit. (You can keep the dough in the refrigerator for up to 6 hours or you can wrap it airtight and freeze it for up to 2 months - you don't need to defrost it before baking.)",
      "Put all the ingredients in the buttered pie plate and stir to combine. (I always toss with my hands.)",
      "Remove the top sheet of paper or plastic from the crust and, using a small sharp knife, cut about 6 slits in the dough, just as you would for a pie, then cut a circle out of the center. (I always use a large piping tip to cut the circular steam vent.)",
      "Put the dough over the fruit. If the circle of dough is a little too big, you can trim it; if it's a little small, don't worry-it will look nice when the fruit bubbles over it.",
      "If you're using it, brush the cream over the dough and sprinkle over the decorating or raw sugar.",
      "Bake the cobbler for 60 to 70 minutes, or until the crust is puffed and golden brown and the fruit is bubbling all around the crust and up through the center vent. (If you think the crust is getting too brown, but the cobbler isn't ready, you can put a loose foil tent over the pan. But don't forget-you want the crust to be a deep golden color.)",
      "Transfer the cobbler to a rack and let it cool for at least half an hour before serving.",
      "Serve the cobbler warm or at room temperature, with ice cream."

In a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook, combine all of the ingredients except for the butter. Mix the ingredients by hand for one minute, then beat on low speed for 3 to 4 minutes, until the dough has come together. Stop the mixer and scrape down the sides as needed, pushing the dry ingredients into wet patches. Once the dough has come together, beat on low speed for 3-4 additional minutes. The dough will be stretchy, stiff, and dry.",

Then, continue mixing on low speed for about 10 minutes, stopping the mixer occasionally to scrape down the bottom and sides of the bowl. It is important for all of the butter to be mixed thoroughly into the dough. If necessary, stop the mixer to break up the dough with your hands to help mix in the butter.",

Continue beating until the dough turns smooth and silky. Then, turn the mixer up to medium-high and beat for 1-2 minutes. You should hear the dough making slapping sounds against the sides of the mixer bowl. Test the dough by pulling it and stretching it thin. You want the dough to stretch, but also give a bit. If it feels too loose, easily breaks off into pieces, or looks shaggy, continue to mix on medium speed for 2-3 additional minutes. It's ready when it's smooth and stretchy and can be gathered together and picked up in one piece.",
      "Place the dough in a large bowl greased with a little neutral oil and cover it with plastic wrap. Allow the dough to rise for 60 minutes in a warm place before placing it in the fridge overnight to allow the dough to proof and to develop flavor. At this point, the dough may also be frozen or stored in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 1 week.",

Cool the loaves in the pans for 30 minutes, then turn out onto a cooling rack and let them finish cooling completely.

Cover and cook on low for 8 to 10 hours, on high for 6 hours, or until the meat shreds easily with a fork. Serve with rice, corn tortillas, shredded cheese, and a dollop of sour cream."

For a crisp exterior, select a baking sheet or other baking pan where the biscuits can be placed wider apart, allowing air to circulate and creating a crisper exterior, and brush the pan with butter.",

Scatter the 1/2-inch size pieces of chilled fat over the mixture and continue snapping thumb and fingers together until no pieces remain larger than a pea.

Lightly beat together the egg and 1/3 cup of the cream, and pour the mixture into the hollow, reserving the remaining 1/3 cup of the cream. Stir the mixture with a rubber spatula or large metal spoon, using broad circular strokes to quickly pull the flour into the liquid. Mix just until the dry ingredients are moistened and the sticky dough begins to pull away from the sides of the bowl. If there is some flour remaining on the bottom and sides of the bowl, stir in 1 to 4 tablespoons of reserved cream, just enough to incorporate the remaining flour into the shaggy wettish dough. If the dough is too wet, use more flour when shaping.",

With floured hands, fold the dough in half, and pat dough out into a 1/3- to 1/2-inch thick round, using a little additional flour only if needed. Flour again if necessary and fold the dough in half a second time. If the dough is still clumpy, pat and fold a third time. Pat dough out into a 1/2-inch thick round for a normal biscuit, 3/4-inch thick for a tall biscuit, and 1-inch-thick for a giant biscuit. Brush off any visible flour from the top. For each biscuit, dip a 2-inch biscuit cutter onto the reserved flour and cut out the biscuits, starting a the outside edge and cutting very close together, being careful not to twist the cutter. The scraps may be combined to make additional biscuits, although these scraps make tougher biscuits.",
      "Using a metal spatula if necessary, move the biscuits to the pan or baking sheet. Brush tops lightly with some of the reserved cream. Bake the biscuits on the top rack of the oven for a total of 12 to 15 minutes, depending on thickness, until light golden brown. After 6 minutes, rotate the pan in the oven so that the front of the pan is now turned to the back, and check to see if the bottoms are browning too quickly. If so, slide another baking pan underneath to add insulation and retard browning. Continue baking another 6 to 9 minutes until the biscuits are light golden brown. When the biscuits are done, remove them from the oven and lightly brush the tops with butter. Turn the biscuits out upside down on a plate to cool slightly. Serve hot, right side up.",

Knead until the gluten has fully developed and the dough can pass the window test. Note: The whole wheat dough recipe will never pass the window test because the hulls in the flour cut the gluten strands, just make sure that the dough is nice and elastic before moving on to the next step. This may take from 10 to 15 minutes of kneading depending on how fast and deliberate you are. (One side effect of kneading is that you get a workout in, too!)",

      "In a stand mixer fitted with the flat beater, mix together the 3 flours, salt, and yeast on low speed just until combined. Add 1 3/4 cups of the water and mix until all the ingredients are smoothly combined, then beat for 4 minutes. The dough will be soft and sticky and will not come away from the sides of the bowl. Cover the bowl with a clean kitchen towel and let the dough rest for 15 minutes. The flour will absorb some of the water and the dough will be less sticky.",
      "Fit the mixer with the dough hook, add the remaining 1/4 cup water, and beat on low speed for 6 minutes. After about 4 minutes, the still-soft dough should begin to come away from the sides of the bowl. If it does not, sprinkle in flour, 1 tsp at a time, adding just enough to allow the dough to come away from the sides of the bowl. On a dry winter day, additional flour will probably not be necessary. On a humid day, a small quantity of flour may be needed. The dough should be soft and very pliable.",
      "To knead the dough by hand, transfer it to a floured work surface and knead for about 5 minutes, adding just enough flour to keep the dough from sticking to the work surface.",
      "Sprinkle a large, clean bowl with flour and transfer the dough to the bowl. Sprinkle the top lightly with flour. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight or up to 2 days.",
      "Remove the dough from the refrigerator and punch down the dough to press out the air. Divide the dough in half. For a round loaf, or boule, line a round basket or bowl about 8 in in diameter (at the top) with a clean kitchen towel. Dust the liner generously with flour. To form the boule, on a floured work surface, press half of the dough into an 8-in circle. Bring up 4 opposite edges to the center of the circle, and press firmly with a finger to seal them together. Then bring up the remaining 4 opposite edges of the circle-like gathering the edges of a piece of cloth into a sack-so that all of the edges are at the center, and press with a finger to seal. Carefully place the boule, seam side up, in the lined basket. If making 2 boules, repeat with the remaining dough half and another basket. Sprinkle the top surface each loaf lightly with flour, cover each with a clean kitchen towel, and let the dough rise for 45 minutes. The dough will look puffy and soft, but it will not rise a lot.",
      "To form 1 or 2 baguettes or long loaves, place a heavy cloth (canvas is good) or clean kitchen towel on a rimless baking sheet/tray and flour it, or flour 1 or 2 single or 1 double baguette pan. (The baking sheet/tray makes it easy to move the risen bread and cloth.) On a floured work surface, pat half of the dough into a 6-by-4-in rectangle. Fold the rectangle in half lengthwise and press the seam to seal. Use your palms to roll the dough back and forth, gently moving your palms along the length of the dough to make a loaf as long as you want. I recommend you make it about 9 in. To taper the ends and leave the middle thicker for a batard, increase the pressure as you move toward the ends. Place the loaf, seam side up, on the floured cloth, and roll up the cloth against the long sides of the loaf to support it as it rises. Or, put the loaf, seam side down, in the floured baguette pan. If making 2 long loaves, repeat with the remaining dough half and another baking sheet/tray and cloth or the remaining baguette furrow. Sprinkle the top of each loaf lightly with flour, cover with a clean kitchen towel, and let the dough rise for 45 minutes. The dough will look puffy and soft, but it will not rise a lot.",
      "When the dough has risen for 35 minutes, position a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 475\u00b0F. Have ready a metal pie pan with a clean rock in it or an empty metal pie pan. If not using a baguette pan, sprinkle a baking sheet/tray with flour.",
      "When the dough has risen for 45 minutes, gently tip the dough in 1 of the baskets onto the prepared pan, or unroll both ends of the cloth and lift one end to roll the long loaf onto the prepared pan. Repeat with the second loaf. The loaves should now be seam side down and at least 2 in. Slide them gently to separate them, if necessary. Using a small, sharp knife, and holding it at a roughly 45-degree angle to the top of the bread, cut a long slash or a crisscross in the top of the round loaves, or a series of 4 or 5 evenly spaced, diagonal slashes along the width of the baguettes. Cut firmly to make each slash about 1/4 in. Sprinkle flour lightly on top of each loaf and re-cover with the kitchen towel. Let rise for 15 minutes.",
      "Put the pie pan on the lowest rack in the oven 5 minutes before the bread is ready to go into the oven. When the bread is ready, sprinkle about 2 tbsp water over the rock to create steam, or sprinkle the same amount into the empty pan. There should be a burst of steam at the beginning and the steam should last for about the first one-third of the baking time. Put the bread in the oven and bake until browned and crusty, about 25 minutes. The bread will rise 11/2 to 2 in during baking. Remove from the oven, immediately slide onto wire racks, and let cool completely.",
      "You may hear crackling sounds as the bread cools, which is good. The cooled bread will have a firm, but not hard crust. The interior will be moist with holes that vary from tiny to about 1/4-in/6 mm in diameter. Use a serrated knife to slice the bread.",
      "The bread can be stored in a paper bag at room temperature for up to 3 days. If the bread is cut, wrap a piece of plastic wrap around the cut end before slipping it into the bag. To serve, preheat the oven to 275\u00b0F and heat the loaf, placed directly on the oven rack, until the crust is crisp and feels warm, about 10 minutes."

Once all of the crusts have been partially cooked, spread each with a thin layer of pumpkin pie filling and return to the oven for another 5 to 10 minutes, or until the filling is set. Remove from the oven and allow the pizzas to cool.",

      "If using a stand mixer, use the paddle because the dough hook will not mix this size batch efficiently. In the mixing bowl, combine the flour, sugar, salt, and 1 tablespoon of the olive oil and stir by hand just to distribute. Add the dissolved yeast and place the bowl and paddle on the mixer. Start mixing on the lowest speed to mix. Increase the speed slightly and mix for 2 to 3 minutes, until the dough is smooth and elastic. Do not over-knead, as this will build up too much gluten and make the dough difficult to shape.",
      "If using a food processor, be sure to use the plastic blade; the metal knife will cut through the gluten strands and keep the dough from developing any \"body.\" Proceed as for the stand mixer, making sure to stop kneading as soon as the dough forms a smooth ball. Over-kneading could overheat the dough because the mixing bowl is directly above the motor.",
      "If mixing by hand, place the dry ingredients in a 4- to 6- quart mixing bowl, and stir to combine. Make a well in the middle and pour the liquids, reserving 1 teaspoon of olive oil. Use a wooden spoon to combine the ingredients. Once all the flour is mixed in, turn the dough onto a lightly floured work surface and, with lightly oiled hands, knead the dough for 5 minutes. It should be smooth and elastic, but will still be slightly sticky.",
      "Place the remaining teaspoon of oil in a 1- quart mixing bowl and spread it with your fingertips. Place the dough ball in the bowl, move it around the oil, then turn it over so that the oiled side is facing upward. Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and allow the dough to rise until doubled in bulk, 11/2 to 2 hours.",
      "You may use the dough at this point, but if possible--and this requires some planning-- punch the dough down, re-shape it into a ball, and cover tightly with plastic wrap. Refrigerate the dough overnight; this will develop a more flavorful dough with a chewier consistency.",
      "About 2 hours before you are ready to assemble your pizza, remove the dough from the refrigerator. If making individual pizzas, use a sharp knife to divide the dough into 2 or 4 equal portions.",
      "Roll each portion of dough into a round ball on a smooth, clean surface, making sure to seal any holes by pinching or rolling.",
      "Place the newly formed dough balls in a glass baking dish, spaced far enough apart to allow for each to double in size. Seal the top of the dish with clear plastic wrap. Set aside at room temperature until the dough balls have doubled in size, about 2 hours. They should be smooth and puffy. Dress the pizza according to the recipe."
