If you want to add a potato, reduce the chicken thighs to five and add a (peeled and diced) potato the last 20 minutes of cooking. Many times this curry is served very spicy hot. If you want to have it hotter, increase the cayenne powder to at least 1 teaspoons."

    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "To make the tortellini, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. On a foil-lined baking sheet toss together the butternut squash, 2 tablespoons of olive oil, herbs de Provence, salt, and pepper. Bake in the oven until soft and golden, about 25 minutes. Meanwhile, heat the olive oil in a small saute pan over medium heat. Cook the shallots and garlic until lightly golden, about 3 minutes.",
      "In a food processor, combine the butternut squash mixture, the shallot mixture, and the ricotta cheese and pulse a few times to blend. Add the crushed amaretti cookies, the nutmeg, and sprinkle with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Pulse until smooth. The tortellini filling can be made one day ahead.",
      "To make the tortellini, lay out 6 wonton skins, keeping the remaining skins inside the package or under a very lightly dampened paper towel. Place 1 tablespoon of squash mixture in the middle of each skin. Dip a pastry brush in a little water and wet the edges of the skin. Gently fold the square wrapper into a triangle, making sure the edges are securely closed and there are no air pockets inside. Dampen the two bottom corners of the longest side of the triangle and gently bring them together, pressing lightly to secure. Place the formed tortellini on a baking sheet and cover with plastic wrap. Before laying out another 6 wonton sheets, be careful to dry the work surface. This will help keep tortellini from sticking to the baking sheet. Continue until all the butternut squash mixture is used. There should be approximately 36 tortellini. (The tortellini can be formed, frozen on the baking sheet, transferred to a tightly sealed plastic bag or container and stored for up to six months. To cook, simply toss the frozen ravioli into the salted boiling water and cook for 4 minutes.).",
      "To make Port Wine Glaze, place all ingredients except butter in a small pot over medium-high heat and reduce to half about 3 ounces, whisk in butter and strain into a gravy boat or something similar.",
      "To make the sauce and serve, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Meanwhile, melt the butter in a large, heavy skillet over medium heat.",
      "Add the sage, pinenuts and let cook until the butter starts to brown, about 3 minutes. Turn the heat off and season with salt, and pepper.",
      "Stir to combine. Then, gently place the tortellini in the boiling water and gently stir. When they begin to float they are done, about 3 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, gently spoon the tortellini onto a serving platter, Top with the brown butter sauce, sprinkle with Parmesan cheese and Wine glaze."

Right at the end of cooking, check for seasoning. No salt was added, but the sauerkraut even though it was rinsed can be salty, so go easy. Besides you are serving a sauce with this dish which also has seasoning.",

The cookbook recommends using Best Foods or Hellman's mayonnaise. I often add 2-3 Tablespoons of milk right before serving to make sure that the pasta is moist enough. The original recipe adds one small can of oil based tuna (drained), but I haven't seen it added to the salad when I have ordered it. Some reviewers are commenting that the recipe is too salty and that the salt should be reduced, so please keep that in mind. I think that I just add to taste, but the 2 teaspoons is what is in the original recipe in the cookbook.].",

When the final batch is mostly brown, add the paprika and the cayenne pepper, fry an extra minute, remove to soup pot. Add water. Make sure to pour 1/2 cup into used frying pan and scrape up the browned bits and pour into the soup pot. Add the bay leaves and bring soup to a simmer, simmer for 1 hour.",

Raise the heat to medium (soup should not quite boil) and cook for another 45 minutes. Serve with a simple salad and fresh crusty white bread, so you can dunk it into the soup. Let each person add their own pepper to taste when it is served."
