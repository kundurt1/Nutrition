If the dough is too dry, add a small amount of olive oil and knead again. Use plenty of flour when rolling pasta. Add olive oil to boiling, salted water or pasta will stick together. Cook pasta until it floats (3-5 minutes). Dough can be made one day ahead, but not rolled. This pasta holds sauces much better than dried! It cooks quickly and is much less filling than dry pasta."

      "In a food processer add the whole bunch of parsley, all the garlic, more salt, and about 3tbs olive oil. Puree until nice and mushy. Scrape mixture into a mixing bowl. Add more olive oil. You want the consistency to be really mush like. Stir. Dosn't hurt to take a little taste. If you need more garlic add it. If you need more salt, add it. You can't hurt this recipe. Using a spoon, scoop up the mixture and drop it on to each one of the tomatoes. Spread the mixture out over each of the tomatoes evenly. Adding too much won't hurt, adding too little can be borring! Bake the tomatoes uncovered for about 35 minutes. You want the olive oil from the mixture to seap out and kind of fry the tomatoes in their pan. In the meantime, get your mozzerella sliced up into thin slices. Lay out your pizza crusts and brush on a little butter,garlic and parmesan cheese all over crust. When the tomatoes are done baking, keep your oven preheated to 375. Using a spatula, scoop up the tomatoes and drop on to the center of the pizza crusts. About 4-5 tomato slices per pizza. Smoosh the tomatoes around on the pizza making a sauce like base, but avoiding the edge of the pizza (duh) Then you add your dryed cured proscuito ham. However much you want to put. Then top the pizza with the thin slices of mozzerella. The more the merrier. Bake for about 10 minutes or when the cheese is melted and the crust is lightly browned. Let cool for about 5 minutes before cutting. Serve with a nice yummy tossed green salad. Don't forget a hearty glass of red wine."

Cover with plastic wrap or damp towel and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 45 minutes up to 3 hours). Test the dough by pressing 2 fingers into it. If indents remain, the dough is adequately risen. When ready, knead the dough gently and divide in 4 pieces about the size and shape of package or Jimmy Dean sausage.

As soon as crumbs begin to darken, reduce heat a bit. The key is even cooking, so that when you turn the fillets, they are a perfect golden brown. This will take about 3 to 4 minutes a side; the thicker the fish, the more slowly you should cook it-turn the heat down a bit more if necessary. Turn the fillets; cook 3 to 4 minutes more, until golden brown. Add a little more oil and butter to pan if it appears dry.",

Scatter the grain berries on top and add almost all the water. Stir with a dough whisk or a wooden spoon until the flour is incorporated. The dough should be wet and sticky to the touch, like firm oatmeal; otherwise, add a bit more water. But don't worry too much about the liquid-to-flour ratio, as this is a forgiving dough. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and let sit at room temperature to ferment for at least 12 hours and up to 18 hours.",
      "2 The next day, finish the bread. Sprinkle a linen or cotton kitchen towel (not terry cloth) with cornmeal and generously flour your work surface. Using a bench scraper or a rubber spatula, scrape the stringy, bubbly dough onto the work surface. Using floured hands, fold it exactly 4 times, always toward the center - from the right and from the left, as well as from the top and the bottom. Turn the loaf upside down so the fold is at the bottom, and set it on the kitchen towel. Fold the towel over the loaf to cover, and let sit for about 1 hour.",
      "3 After about 30 minutes, position a rack in the bottom third of the oven and preheat to 475\u00b0F. Place a 4 1/2- to 5 1/2-quart cast-iron pot or Dutch oven with its lid in the center of the rack. After about 1 hour, your loaf should have nicely risen. (When you press it with your finger about 1/4 inch deep, the dimple should remain; if not, wait 15 more minutes.) But again, don't worry too much - I have sometimes been less than precise and still succeeded.",
      "4 Using thick pot holders, carefully remove the cast-iron pot from the oven and place it on a couple of folded kitchen towels (to avoid cracking); uncover. Unwrap the dough, sprinkle with a bit more cornmeal, and invert directly from the kitchen towel into the pot, seam side up (it might look a bit wiggly; that's normal). If the dough doesn't drop into the center, shake the pot once or twice (use caution, it is hot!).",
      "5 Cover with the lid and bake for 30 minutes. Uncover and bake until the loaf is nicely browned and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center registers 200\u00b0F, 20 to 25 minutes. Using thick pot holders, remove the loaf from the cast-iron pot and transfer to a wire rack. If you can resist, allow to cool completely, about 3 hours, before cutting the loaf with a sharp serrated knife. And a sharp knife it must be - this is a German-style bread, after all."

Reduce heat to low, cover and simmer the soup until the squash is tender, about 20 minutes. Remove from the heat, and at this point you can either use an immersion blender directly in the pot to puree the soup or transfer the soup to a blender or food processor--in batches if necessary--to puree the soup.

Brush lamb exterior with mustard, then, carefully press herb and bread crumb mixture onto top and sides of roast with hands, pressing firmly to form a solid, even coating that adheres to the meat. Return coated roast to rack; roast until instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part of roast registers 130 to 135 degrees (medium-rare), 15 to 25 minutes longer. Transfer meat to cutting board, tent with foil, and let rest 10 to 15 minutes. Cut into 1/2-inch slices and serve."

Rub the paste into the cavity and flesh of the poultry, at the same time pulling out excess fat from under the skin and from the neck and rump ends. Pull out the thin translucent membrane from under the skin of the breast. Rinse the poultry well under running water until it no longer smells of garlic. (The garlic is used to rid the poultry of any bitterness that might spoil a sauce; it also brings out its flavor, much like MSG.) Drain the poultry well.",
      "2. If you suspect that your poultry is tasteless on account of \"scientific breeding,\" use a method invented by Janet Jaidi to improve its taste: Rub it with the spices to be used in the recipe, a little butter and oil, and marinate it overnight. (If you do this, remember that you may have to readjust the spicing of your sauce at the end.)",
      "3. If you are using whole poultry, it must be trussed. Trussing poultry is easy: clip off the wing tips and discard; slip the ends of the legs into a horizontal incision made just about the rump (turkeys often come this way), or slip the legs into incisions made on the lower sides of the breast.",

If you decide to go with all three, most stores sell a combination meatloaf mix with all three packaged together! We found it at Whole Foods.",

We felt it needed the extra time to really let the flavors blend, the veggies break down and the wine to cook off. Make sure to keep it covered though, so it doesn't dry out too much.

Once pie crusts are cooled (about ten minutes) divide the spinach equally in the two crusts; dice ham into small cubes directly in to one of the pies (be generous--use 3/4 to 1 cup--there will be plenty left over for sandwiches); dice cheeses of choice in small cubes to both of the pies, use 3/4 to 1 cup in each pie; add pepper to taste; divide the egg mixture evenly between the two pies. Put both pies side by side on a large cookie sheet and bake at 350 degrees for approximately 40 to 45 minutes. When done, the middle of the quiche should be a little moist. Test by sticking a knife in the center of the pie and if the knife comes out clean the pie is done. Allow pies to cool to set, maybe ten to fifteen minutes and then slice and serve.

      "Preheat the oven to 350A\u00b0 F and place a rack in the middle. Line a 9- by 13-inch or 8x12 baking pan with parchment paper, allowing some to drape over the sides of the pan, preferably metal, not glass. In a large bowl using a handheld electric mixer, or in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the butter and 2/3 cup of the sugar until light and creamy, about 3 minutes. Working on low speed, add the flour, baking powder, spices, and salt and mix well. Mix in the egg yolks and the milk until combined, then scrape the batter into the prepared pan. Clean and thoroughly dry the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. Pour in the egg whites, making sure there are no specks of yolk, and add the remaining 1 cup of sugar. Beat to soft peaks Abe patient, it will happen. If the egg whites aren't reaching soft peaks, wait until the mixture ribbons back onto itself. Spread this carefully on top of the cake layer. Sprinkle with almonds if desired. Bake for 25 minutes (or 30-35 with smaller pan), or until the meringue is golden brown and puffed. About 15 minutes through baking, cover the meringue with coconut flakes (if desired). Cool the cake in the pan on a wire rack. Meanwhile, make the whipped cream: Pour the cream into a medium bowl and scrape in the vanilla seeds, discarding the pod. Beat to soft peaks with an electric mixer, about 3 minutes. Carefully transfer the cool cake to a cutting board. Cut the cake in half crosswise with a serrated knife. Place one half of the cake on your serving tray of choice and cover with the cream and banana slices. Place the other half, meringue side up, on top. Place the cake in the refrigerator to chill and soften for 1 hour before serving."

Put on the stove and add water (or chicken/turkey broth College Inn) until you have enough for three to four cups of broth. Then you need to cool down broth and then refrigerate. If any fat forms you can skim it off in the morning. In the morning, put a bag of cubed Pepperidge farm seasoned stuffing in two separate bowls. Put 1 cup of giblet broth in each bowl. Put two cups of College Inn broth in each bowl and mix all together. Cut 2 lbs of hamburger meat and two pounds of sausage roll (Parks was what Granny use but if you cannot get it, I use Jimmy Dean or Habersett) While cooking break into small pieces. Put half in each bowl. I think I have sometimes added butter if it called for it on the stuffing package but it is not listed on the recipe. You then stuff the turkey but not too tightly. The rest can be put in pan and cooked at 325 for 30 minutes."
