      "Preparation: Combine the almond powder and 100 g powdered sugar in a mixing bowl.",
      "Prepare a piping bag with a 1 cm tip.",
      "Now, make the meringue.",
      "Combine egg whites to 40 g of powdered sugar and vanilla and beat together until the mixture looks glossy.",

      "Add meringue to the dry ingredients bowl, and mix with a rubber spatula until the mixture is even.",
      "At this point in time, the mixture should fluff up a bit due to air mixing in.",
      "We'll now deflate the macaron batter.",
      "(This is called macaronage) Using a spatula, run it along the edge of the bowl to pick up some batter, then fold the scooped mixture on the rest, patting it down gently to press the air out.",
      "While you're mixing, scoop some batter and let it hang.",
      "Continue mixing the batter until it falls like ribbons when you let it drip from the spatula.",
      "Be careful not to mix so much that the batter flows like liquid.",
      "Put the batter into a piping bag, and pipe 3.5 cm circles onto a baking sheet while leaving adequate space in between.",
      "On a 30 x 40 cm., you should be able to make 30 circles.",
      "Take the baking sheet somewhere with good ventilation and let the surface of the macarons dry out.",
      "When you touch them, you should be able to feel a slightly rigid outer shell.",
      "This should take approximately 40 minutes to an hour on a dry day.",
      "Heat an oven to 160 - 170C (320 to 338 Fahrenheit) and bake the macarons.",
      "After 3 or 4 minutes, the bottom of the macarons should start to rise while the tops remain round.",
      "If the macarons break, they wont rise.",
      "Once the bottoms of the macarons have risen to between 3 - 4 mm., turn the heat down to 140C.",
      "Bake for another 10 - 12 minutes while ensuring that they do not brown.",
      "Touch the macarons gently to check if they're done.",
      "If the risen bottom (pied, or \"foot\") of the macaron moves, bake for a bit longer.",

      "For me, after preheating the oven, I let it sit empty at 160C (320 Fahrenheit) for 10 to 15 minutes.",
      "This prevents half-baked macarons.",
      "Because the macarons are very soft out of the oven, let them sit until they feel cool to the touch.",
      "Once they're cool, gently remove from the sheet and fill with your preferred cream before making them into the completed macarons.",
