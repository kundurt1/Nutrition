Combine the chocolate, sugar, almond milk and Guinness in a heatproof bowl and set it over the simmering water without letting the bottom touch the water. Let the chocolate melt in the double boiler while stirring with a heatproof spoon or spatula until the mixture is smooth and shiny. Take the bowl off of the heat and set it aside.

Season with cayenne, salt and a few cracks of fresh pepper. Remove from heat, cover, and set aside.",
      "For the poached eggs:",
      "Heat a cast iron skillet with a few inches of water in it over medium heat. Add white vinegar to the water. When the water comes to a simmer, keep it there and make sure it doesn't hard boil. Working with the eggs one at a time, crack an egg into a small cup or ramekin and then place the cup near the surface of the hot water and gently drop the egg into the water. With a spatula, nudge the egg whites closer to their yolks to help the egg whites hold together. After about 3 to 4 minutes of cooking time, scoop the egg out with a slotted spoon and let it drain on a folded paper towel.",
      "Meanwhile, start toasting your English muffins and preparing your spinach. In a large frying pan over medium heat, heat the olive oil, and then add the baby spinach, stirring until the spinach is dark green and wilted, about 4-5 minutes. Add the minced garlic and stir until fragrant, about 30 seconds or so.",
      "To assemble, top each toasted English muffin half with some cooked spinach, a poached egg, and a few spoons of the butter sauce. Serve immediately.",

Whisk them together thoroughly until smooth. Make a well in the bowl of dry ingredients and pour the wet ingredients into it. Gently whisk the batter together until just combined-you don't want to over mix it.",

(I have no patience and a lack of upper body strength for hand whisking egg whites, so a mixer is best for me.) Be careful that everything is clean when you do this. Egg whites can be temperamental and won't stiffen up if there is any yolk or other little bits in them. Using a spatula, gently fold the egg whites and the strawberries into the lemon ricotta pancake batter.",
      "3. The key to this batter is folding in those whipped up egg whites separately from the yolks. They make the strawberry lemon ricotta pancakes so incredibly fluffy that you will think you are eating clouds. Now, heat up your griddle over medium heat and when it's hot, grease it with a pat of butter. Spoon the pancake batter onto the griddle in whatever sized pancakes you like. Cook until golden on one side, then flip those flapjacks! Let them get golden on the other side, then plate them up. Repeat with the rest of the batter. With the size hubby and I did, we yielded 16.",
      "4. Dust the top of the strawberry lemon ricotta pancakes with powdered sugar, and dig in! I made pretty little fanned out strawberries for the very top as garnish to just make them look extra special for serving. We didn't even need syrup, that's how moist and fluffy they were. The texture of these strawberry lemon ricotta pancakes was just incredible. Whip them up for your next Sunday brunch and they will be a hit for sure!"

With an electric mixer, beat in sour cream, blue cheese, butter, salt and pepper. Add milk a little at a time, with a mixer, until the mixture reaches the desired consistency. Spoon the mixture back into the potato shells. Place on a cookie sheet or in a shallow pan and bake at 400 degrees for about 15 minutes or until heated through. Sprinkle with bacon. Enjoy!"

Sprinkle chopped nuts then crushed pineapple over the cherries without disturbing the arrangement. Pour cake batter to fill the pan to within 1/2 inch from the top (mine was completely filled, which was why it had \"mushroomed\" a little to form a delicious crusty rim). Bake for 45-50 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the middle comes out clean.",

If any of the caramel goodness sticks in the pan, scoop it out and gently arrange it on top of the cake. Allow to cool completely before cutting and serving. (Or cheat and hack it up while it's still warm to scarf down with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. I won't tell!) Enjoy!"

If you like a richer latte, use chocolate syrup as your sweetener and substitute half-and-half for your milk. If you're watching your calories, use low-fat milk and stevia. My own personal preference dictates a latte lightly sweetened with half agave and half sugar and made creamy with whole milk. But see? This is another advantage of making it at home.

My instructions should not be considered absolute, nor should they serve as a substitute for following proper and safe canning procedures as outlined by the Food and Drug Administration, as well as your canning equipment/supplies manufacturer's directions. Also, all brands of pectin are not created equal, nor can they be substituted for each other in equal measure to achieve the same results. My results are based on Ball's Real Fruit Low or No Sugar Added Pectin only. When in doubt, follow your pectin manufacturer's instructions.",

Use a large deep container-I use a 5-gallon bucket if making very many, or a pretty pitcher to set on the kitchen counter if only making them for my husband and myself. The secret is to put the salt in the water and cover the potatoes for 24 hours. This allows the brine to pull the starch from the potatoes so that when they bake, they are flaky and not gummy.",

You want the water removed before you rub them with solid shortening or olive oil. Rub some kosher salt onto the greased potato and put into a hot oven. Let them bake for 30 minutes, then turn the temperature down to 350 degrees for the remaining 30 minutes. This will make the outside peel crunchy and the inside soft, flaky and light.",

Stir it all thoroughly together until it is a uniform, wet sand texture. Set it aside and preheat the oven to 375 F. Liberally grease an 8 x 8 square pan with cooking spray.",
      "2. In a large bowl, whisk the flour, sugar, baking powder, cinnamon, salt and baking soda to aerate the dry ingredients. In another bowl, whisk the buttermilk, strawberry cream cheese, eggs and strawberry balsamic together until smooth. Pour the wet ingredients into the bowl of dry ingredients and gently whisk it just until it becomes a smooth batter. A few little lumps are OK-it is best not to overwork it. Switch to a rubber spatula and fold in the chopped strawberries.",
      "3. Pour the batter into the greased baking dish and smooth it out to be nice and even. Sprinkle on the crumb topping to make an even layer on top of the batter. Get the crumb cake into the oven to bake for about 50-55 minutes. When done, a toothpick inserted into the center should come out clean and the cake should be gorgeously golden.",
      "4. Take the crumb cake out of the oven and let it cool for 15 to 20 minutes at least. Then just cut into the desired sized pieces and serve! It doesn't get much better to pair it with a great cup of coffee or tea."

      "It's one of my secret indulgences-and most often I serve creme fraiche with a bowl of fresh berries. It's French-style made from fresh pasteurized (in the U.S.) cream that is cultured. It's thick, rich, smooth with just a hint of tang. I'd say it's a cross between sour cream and whipped cream, if you combine the two together. You can make your own creme fraiche by taking 1 cup heavy cream and adding 1 tablespoon of buttermilk. Let it sit in a warm spot all day, up to 24 hours. The happy, healthy bacteria in the buttermilk keeps the mixture safe. Stir, use or refrigerate for up to a week.",
      "1. Cut the kernels from the corn: Take 1 corn, cut the tippy top of the corn off, so that you can create a flat tip. Hold the corn vertically, tip down on the cutting board and use a knife to cut off all of the kernels. Once the kernels are all removed, turn your knife around and use the back edge of your knife to scrape the spent cob. You'll be releasing the natural milk inside the corn, which will help thicken and create the \"cream\" for the corn.",
      "2. Heat a large saute pan over medium heat. When hot, add the butter and swirl to coat. Add the onions and saute until transparent, about 3-4 minutes.",
      "3. Turn the heat to medium-high and add the corn kernals and the corn milk. Stir well and season with salt, pepper and cayenne pepper. Saute for 2 minutes, stirring occasionally.",

Each packaged treat is about 3\" x 2\" rectangular shape. Cut them into a 1\" section, and a 2\" section. The 1\" sections were used for the log-shaped sushi, and the 2\" sections were used for the round sushi rolls.",
      "Rice Krispie treats are surprisingly easy to mold and shape. Round off the sections so they aren't so angled. For the round sushi roll pieces, indent the center of the rice krispie treat to make a slight \"well\" so the candies can fit into them instead of sticking up on top of them.",

After the chocolate dip, immediately dunk it into the shredded coconut until it's nicely coated. Set aside and allow to dry.",
      "For the California roll toppings:",
      "Cut up assorted colors of gummi bears. Chop off their little gummi heads and their little gummi bums. Put a little dab of white chocolate on the back of each gummi piece and stick it into the well of the rice krispie rolls. Originally we used red pieces but it started to look too fake, so we used dried cranberries instead since I had a bag of those around. Use your imagination and improvise, don't be afraid to play around and have fun. (You can also use fresh fruit such as kiwis, strawberries or oranges. But fruit won't last unless you intend on serving them and eating them right away.)",
      "For the tuna sushi toppings:",
      "Using the 1\" log pieces of rice krispie treats, you can make a variety of sushi. I chose to make tuna sushi because I found these awesome strawberry-flavored sour strips. They were perfect! Cut each strip at a diagonal just like they cut sushi fish at the restaurant. I used two strips for each sushi. Put a little dab of white chocolate underneath each strip and gently lay it over each rice krispie log. Make sure each strip is long enough that it drapes off the ends so it looks more realistic.",
      "For other sushi variety, if you can find strip candy in other colors such as orange or pale pink, which would make great salmon sushi or albacore sushi!",

(Save the bottom base for the kids to eat. Or if you have a husband with an evil sweet tooth.) Place each Twinkie piece onto a rice krispie log with the white cream filling facing down.",

Grate the carrots, as fine as you can, place them in a bowl and add 1 tablespoon rice vinegar and then grate 1 teaspoon of fresh ginger over the carrots. Toss and set aside to 'pickle'.

      "After the rice has cooked, place it into a large shallow bowl, and sprinkle the rice vinegar/sugar over the top of the rice. Very important, do not stir the rice after adding the rice vinegar/sugar mixture. Cut and fold it as if you were adding flour to egg whites. You don't want to mash the rice, just make sure the rice vinegar is incorporated into the rice. Use the bamboo paddle or a large flat wooden spoon and make sure that the shallow bowl you put the cooked rice in is big enough that you can do the cut and fold without doing a 'rice mash'. It's best to do this while the rice is still warm as it absorbs the vinegar best this way.",
      "Cut the avocado into slices at this point and place aside. I cut the avocado in half, twist it a little and pop it apart. Then I use a thin paring knife, and slice lengthwise into the avocado, stopping at the skin. Run the thin knife around the edge of the avocado, and just pop out the slices. Or slice it however you want. After peeling it, that is.",
      "First, place a sheet of plastic wrap on top of the bamboo rolling mat. Sprinkle a thin layer of the toasted sesame seeds on top of the plastic. Then put a thin layer of rice on top. About a half a cup or so. I like a thin layer of rice. Wet your hand and keep a bowl of water beside you. Pat down the rice with your wet hand. Don't mash the rice down, just pat it into place. It's sticky enough that it will do just fine. (This is very important. You need to keep your hands wet, otherwise the rice sticks to everything.)",
      "Next place a sheet of Nori on top of the rice and then add your fillings, some avocado and some crab or the spring onions and grated carrot mixture. I usually make 3 California Rolls, and then two of the other kind. I like putting the Nori on the outside of the roll when I fill it with vegetables like the grated carrot, spring onion and cucumber.",
      "Roll the sushi roll using the mat and that plastic wrap. Pick up the edge of the wrap that's closest to you, roll away from yourself keeping the wrap firm. Continue until the whole thing is in a nice roll. This does take a little practice and if you screw up the first one, you can always save it and eat it a little later on. Pat the roll and shape it a little so it's nice and round. Place in the refrigerator. Continue with the next sheet of Nori, the second roll is a lot easier to do. I can usually get three California Rolls out of one can of crab.",
      "Continue using the rest of the rice and Nori. I alternated by putting a sheet of Nori down first, placing a thin layer of rice on that with some of the grated carrot and green spring onions. You can also use matchstick sliced cucumbers if you know your guests can handle the cucumbers.",
      "When all the rolls are done, refrigerate them until you are ready to serve. Then take each roll out and slice into thin slices. I find each roll will make about 8 slices.",
      "And here's the final hint. Cut each roll in half and then slice each of the halves in half again, and then slice each of those halves in half again. You should have 8 even slices at this point.",

      "Instead of milliliters you could use cups-one cup equals about 200 milliliters. The measurements aren't that important; mix in what you want, just make sure the end result is a thick paste that should be fairly easy to spread out thinly on a baking sheet covered with baking parchment paper. If you manage to spread it out really thin, you could cover three baking sheets and make about 50 crisp breads. I prefer to mix all the ingredients except for the almonds, which I drizzle over the crisp bread and carefully press into the bread right before I shove it into the oven. Sometimes I also drizzle poppy seeds over the top.",
      "If you have a hot air oven, you can bake several trays at a time. Heat oven to 175 degrees Celsius or 342 degrees Fahrenheit, cook the crisp bread for 10 minutes, then take out the tray and cut/route the bread with a pizza wheel into small squares of the size you'd like (I make mine about the size of a piece of presliced cheese for convenience!). Put the tray back into the oven for about 30 minutes or maybe more, you'll have to check with your oven. The bread will not be super hard right after you take it out of the oven, but will firm up after it has cooled down (preferably on a cooling rack). If it's not hard enough still after cooling down, you could pop it back into the oven for 10 minutes. Stored in a dry place, they could keep for months! Mine don't last more than a week, though. Served with a nice chicken or egg salad or cured salmon, they make for a great breakfast, midday meal or even dinner, if you serve a soup alongside it."

    "ingredients": [],

      "This stuffing is meant to be cooked in the bird. The recipe I'm posting here was used to stuff a 15-20 pound bird.",
      "Prep begins the night before with dicing the bread (and, if you wish to save time the next day, the onions and peppers, as well). The cook time will vary depending on how long your turkey needs to cook. Begin your prep work in the morning, giving yourself 2 1/2 hours to simmer the giblets, 1 hour to combine spices, onions, peppers, and raisins to make the stuffing, and 15-20 minutes to stuff the bird (and prep it with spices, etc.) before popping it into the oven.",
      "It looks a lot of work, but it is totally worth it.",
      "1. Dice the bread and leave out in large bowls overnight to go stale.",
      "2. In the morning, put the giblets in a stock pot of water (I usually use a 4-5 quart pot). This will be the base for your gravy.",
      "3. To the giblet water, add the onion and green pepper for the gravy.",
      "4. Add the gravy spices to the giblet water, then bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Lower heat and simmer, covered, for 2 to 2 1/2 hours. (Don't forget to put your turkey in the fridge in its baking pan!) Relax and watch the parade.",
      "5. For the stuffing, put the onions and peppers into a large skillet and add butter and raisins. Cook on medium heat, stirring, until vegetables begin to soften and raisins are beautiful and puffy and soft. As the butter melts, add the stuffing spices. Stir constantly. This should take about 10-15 minutes. Remove from heat.",
      "6. Combine the raisins, onions, and peppers with your bread in a large bowl. Add enough of the giblet water to make the stuffing wet, but not too wet. Because you're stuffing the bird, it will not dry out much. (Don't get the giblets in your stuffing! Save them for the gravy!) Mix the bread, raisin mixture, and giblet water; this works best if you do it with your hands.",
      "7. Now is the fun part! Get your bird back out of the fridge and preheat your oven to 325\u00b0F. Stuff your turkey until you think it's going to pop! Stuff the cavity. Stuff the neck. When it's full, stuff another couple of handfuls in.",
      "8. Personally, I like rubbing the bird down with some Kosher salt, fresh ground pepper, and poultry seasoning (even under the skin), then slicing another stick of butter and sticking the butter under the skin and on the legs and wings. You may choose to do differently. I also cover my bird's legs and wings for the first few hours it's cooking to keep those juicy, plus I add some chicken stock and another ladle or two of the giblet water to the pan below the bird. Once your bird is prepped and stuffed, truss 'er up and put 'er in the oven for the prescribed time.",
      "9. Back to the giblets! Add more water to the pot, then let it simmer until the turkey is ready to come out of the oven. While the turkey rests after cooking, you can chop the giblets finely (removing bones), add them back to the broth, then add the brown gravy mix. Whisk to mix, and add cornstarch or flour if you'd like to thicken it some. Because it has all the same spices as the stuffing, it goes great with both the turkey and (if you're inclined) the stuffing. Amazing on mashed potatoes.",
      "Note: if you wind up with extra stuffing that can't fit into the bird, keep that in the fridge until you have about 30 minutes left, then put it in alongside the turkey, covered in foil, to warm it up."

The butter pieces will be all different sizes, but you don't want to over work the dough, so 'pea size' is just a general rule. You can also do this in food processor, but using a pastry cutter is really easy (if you have one).",
      "Slowly add in 1/2 cup of ice cold water and mix with a wooden spoon or spatula. Add in more cold water, 1 tablespoon at a time, until the dough is thick and starts sticking to your spoon. Then use your hands and give it a quick knead (only about 5 kneads) to really gather the dough.",
      "Divide the dough into 2 pieces, lay each on a piece of plastic wrap, form each into a small disk, wrap them up, and put them in the fridge for at least 2 hours. At this point you can leave the dough in the fridge for up to 1 week, or you can freeze it up to a couple of months.",
      "To make the pie:",
      "Preheat oven to 400\u00b0F.",
      "Stir together the blueberries, cornstarch, flour, sugar, salt and lemon juice gently in a large bowl.",
      "Roll out half of the chilled dough on a floured work surface to 13-inches round (or something that slightly resembles a circle). Fold the circle in half, then in half again and place the point in the center of the pie plate, then unfold the crust. Or you can roll it around the rolling pin and unroll it over the pie plate. Trim edges so you have roughly a half-inch overhang.",
      "Scoop the blueberry filling into the pie crust, discarding the majority of the liquid that has pooled in the bowl. Add the little bits of butter to the top of the blueberries.",
      "Roll out the remaining dough into a 12-inch round on a lightly floured surface, and slice into strips. The strips should be roughly 1/2-1 inch thick (your choice). Weave the strips over the blueberry filling, leaving a 1-inch overhang. Fold the overhang under (or over, if that's easier) the bottom crust, pressing the edge to seal it. Use your thumb and index finger with one hand, and your index finger knuckle on the other hand to 'crimp' the edge of the pie.",
      "Combine the egg and water in a small bowl. Brush the egg wash over over lattice top (a little will get on the blueberries, that's OK.",
      "Bake the pie in the middle of the oven for 25 minutes. Lower the temperature to 350 F and bake for an additional 25 to 30 minutes. Bake until the crust is golden and the blueberries are bubbling through. Let the pie cool on a rack. Can be made up to a day ahead of time (maybe more, but I made mine 1 day ahead and we demolished it in 1 sitting).",

      "If you don't have a horseradish plant to dig the roots up, then buy a few large pieces of the root at the store or farmer's market.",
      "Wash the dirt off and use a sturdy vegetable peeler to peel away the darker outer layer of the root, exposing the bright white inside. If you have very large roots (over 1.5\" diameter), consider popping out the tough circular core. They are sort of like carrots: when they get bigger, the center gets more tough and less flavorful.",
      "Here is the trick to understanding horseradish: it doesn't release it's pungency or spice until it is exposed to air. The finer it is shredded or ground, the hotter it is. It also takes a few minutes for those flavors to develop. Assuming you want the hottest horseradish possible, shred and let it sit for at least 3 minutes before adding the vinegar (which halts the development of the heat).",
      "The best way to prepare the root is to shred it with a microplane grater. This year, I had an awful lot to shred, so I used the food processor to coarsely grate it, then put it back into the food processor with the blade and chopped it to consistency that I like (you can click on my link if you would like to see pictures of that). Mine is a bit coarser than most prefer, though I like it. A microplane will give you a very consistent, small shred.",
      "Once you have shredded the root, add enough vinegar to coat the shredded horseradish well, without having the shreds swimming it in or the vinegar puddling in the bottom of the bowl.",
      "My secret is to use 3 parts white vinegar to 1 part balsamic vinegar. The balsamic adds the perfect amount of sweetness to the pungent horseradish. Also add 1 tablespoon of kosher salt (less if you are using table salt).",
      "Taste it and adjust vinegar and salt to taste. Spoon into 1/2-pint canning jars and screw the lids on. This can't be heat processed, so freeze whatever you won't use in the next few months.",

Remove the whisk attachment and replace with the beater attachment. Beat until the buttercream comes together fully and is smooth. This can take time, sometimes 2 minutes, and sometimes up to 10 minutes. Don't worry if you think you did something wrong, it will come together and create a smooth and creamy buttercream.",

When you need to use it again, remove it from the refrigerator and place it on the counter until it reaches room temperature. This will take a few hours, depending on how much buttercream you have. You can also microwave it for a quick 30 seconds (or a little bit longer or shorter, depending on how much buttercream you have) until it is soft, but not liquid.

I usually drain them a bit before use, since the salsa brings enough heat for my palate.",
      "The salsa is also storebought but could easily be home made by blending diced tomatoes from a can, half an onion, some dried red chili flakes, a clove of garlic, a squeeze of a lemon, a pinch of sugar and some salt in a Mix Master/Kitchen aid.",
      "The preparations are pretty straight forward. Wash the veggies, chop them up into pieces, and layer the salad in this order: strips of iceberg salad (a nice mound), diced tomatoes, red bell pepper and english cucumber, chili beans, blobs of salsa and sour cream dispersed all over, taco meat, grated Jarlsberg cheese, taco chips that you've crumbled to pieces and chopped black olives.",
      "I always try to get a fork filled with all the flavours in each bite. It's fresh, savoury, crunchy, creamy and spicy, all at the same time! It's a napkin killer but I mostly manage to eat it without spilling half of it on my shirt."

I left them to harden overnight.",

The mixture should be thick enough to stay on the bauble so adjust the consistency if necessary. You will need some patience for this step, the baubles are very small and you have to be careful not too press too hard on the trees as not to break them. Clean your hands from time to time if the sugar gets on your fingers, otherwise you will find the baubles sticking to your fingers instead to the tree. If you don't want to use a piping bag, you could use a wooden skewer instead. I just dipped that in the sugar icing and put a small drop of it on the bauble.",
