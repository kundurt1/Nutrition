Add bell pepper and tomato, and cook for another 3 minutes. Pour in equal parts vegetable stock and whole milk, then turn up heat to high. As the mixture comes to a boil, add the spinach, peas and broccoli. While still boiling, whisk in the flour gradually.",
      "Reduce heat so that the gravy is moderately but constantly simmering. Stir in the seasoning (thyme, oregano, black and cayenne pepper) and let simmer for about 10 minutes. Ladle out about 1/4 cup of gravy and very gradually whisk it (by small spoonfuls) in with the egg yolk. This gradual heating up prevents the egg yolk from cooking too quickly when added to the gravy. Once your egg yolk mixture is ready, stir into gravy, followed by the soy sauce. I recommend about 5 tablespoons of light soy sauce, however it may vary depending on personal taste.",
      "Let the gravy continue to simmer and thicken (the thicker, the better!) as you prepare the mashed potatoes. To prepare potatoes, peel back plastic at the corner of the package and heat on high for 3 minutes in the container. Remove plastic and stir, then continue to microwave for 1 minute. When potatoes are ready, season them with salt and pepper. Grease a large (at least 10\" x 13\" and 2\" deep) casserole dish. Pour the mashed potatoes into the dish and smooth out into one even layer, and sprinkle with 1/2 cup of cheddar cheese. Pour gravy over the potatoes, sprinkle with the breadcrumbs and remaining cheese. Bake uncovered at 425 degrees for 20-30 minutes (check frequently after 20 minutes to ensure that the cheese does not burn), then remove from heat and allow to sit for at least 5 minutes."

Wait 2 to 3 days until the grains begin to sprout, rinsing and draining them once or twice so they are always damp. As soon as little tails appear, the wheat berries have sprouted and are ready. You can store them in the fridge until you are ready to make the dough.",
      "In a food processor, work the sprouted wheat berries into a pulp. If the processor starts to generate heat, give it a break before continuing.",
      "Combine the water with the almond milk. (You want the liquid to be room temperature, so if the almond milk was refrigerated, use boiling water.).",
      "Using the dough hook of an electric mixer, combine the sprout pulp, ALL of the vital wheat gluten, salt, yeast, honey, and half of the liquid. Mix on slow speed for 1 minute to bring the ingredients together into a ball, adding additional water as needed. Continue mixing 2 to 3 minutes, occasionally scraping down the bowl. The dough should form a sticky ball.",
      "Mist a work surface with a spray of water. Place the dough on the surface and knead with wet hands for 1 to 2 minutes.

Meanwhile, lightly oil a bowl.",

Cover loosely with plastic wrap and let rise at room temperature for 45 to 60 minutes or until it is about 1 1/2 times its original size.",
      "Preheat the oven to 425 degrees. When you put the loaf in the oven, turn down the heat to 350 degrees. Bake for 20 minutes, rotate the loaf, and then bake for another 30 minutes, until the bottom of the loaf sounds hollow when it is tapped.",

Keep trimming off the ends as you go to make it easier to peel off the layers. This takes patience (and time), but it's a fun activity for your kids. As you get closer to the center, the leaves will become too tight to peel, so simply save the small pieces for sauteing or roasting."

This gives an oval shape with ridges that looks a bit (a lot!) like a trilobite.",

      "Preheat the oven to 220\u00b0C/gas mark 7 (428\u00b0F) for the fish, and begin by preparing the sides for your tacos. Peel and halve the red onion, then thinly slice into half-moons. Put the red onion slices into a bowl and cover with the lime juice. Stir with a fork to mix the onion well in the juice. Actually, if you can get this done ahead of time (up to 1 day), so much the better, but even 20 minutes is fine.",
      "Make the hot sauce by mixing together the mayonnaise and the gochujang paste (or other hot sauce) in a small bowl. Set aside.",
      "For the corn relish, put the canned sweetcorn into a bowl. Finely dice the chilli (de-seed if you don't like too much heat) and add to the sweetcorn, along with the chopped coriander and some salt to taste. Give it all a good stir, and set aside.",
      "Cut the fish fillets in half lengthways, so you have long fingers, and arrange in a shallow roasting tin. Mix together the cumin, paprika and salt, and sprinkle over the fish fillets.",
      "Mix the garlic and the oil in a small bowl. Drizzle the fish with the garlicky oil, and roast in the oven for 8-10 minutes, depending on the thickness of your fillets. Check to see if the fish is cooked through (though only just) before taking out of the oven.",
      "Once you've taken the fish out (though don't let it get cold) turn off the oven and warm the tortillas in the fading heat. Meanwhile, peel, stone and slice the avocados, then spritz with the juice of the lime, ready to serve with the other accompaniments.",
      "Arrange the fish on a plate (lined with salad leaves, if so desired), sprinkle with some chopped fresh coriander, and take to the table along with the warmed tortillas. If you don't want to add any salad to the fish directly, you may want to put a bowl of shredded iceberg or some other crisp leaves nearby.",
      "Put the bowls of soused, but drained, red onions, the corn relish, hot sauce and a plate of sliced avocados on the table so that everyone can load their tortillas. A plate of lime wedges and a pile of napkins are both good ideas, too.",
      "MAKE AHEAD NOTE: The pickled onions, hot sauce and relish (minus the coriander) can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate until needed. Stir the chopped coriander into the corn relish just before serving."

      "Start with at least a 6 quart pot.",
      "Empty both cans of tomatoes, stewed and diced, into the pot, using a little tap water in each can to swish around and get everything out.",
      "Use your bare hands to squash up the tomatoes a bit smaller than they already are, just so the chunks aren't giant.",
      "Add water from the tap. Start with less than you think you need as you can always add more; you want plenty of room for vegetables. 8 cups is a rough estimate of what I usually use.",
      "Turn burner to medium-high, add the can of tomato sauce, Italian seasoning (I use Trader Joe's 21 Seasoning Salute) bouillon (I use Better Than Bouillon) and the bay leaves. NOTE: If you are using a different type of broth/bouillon just follow the product instructions or your own taste to get about 8 cups of broth to start your soup.",
      "Get out your favorite chef's knife and cutting board. Start with the carrots, celery, and onion. This is your mirepoix. Coarsely chop everything into large, bite sized pieces. A diagonal cut makes the carrots and celery extra pretty in the soup. (You may saute these veggies first in olive oil or butter but in my experience it hasn't made a discernible difference so I just toss them into the soup and enjoy the ease and time saved.).",
      "Once your mirapoix is in with the herbs and spices flavoring the broth, you can put on some music or a podcast and just start chopping things and throwing them into the soup at your leisure. Usually spinach goes in last, but at this point it matters very little in which order you add the ingredients to the soup.",
      "NOTES ON CHOPPING THE VEGGIES: It's best to strip the kale leaves from their thick stalks before chopping the leaves up. Most of these veggies will be a pretty coarse chop--if you do a finer chop you may want to shorten the cooking time so they don't get mushy. Slice everything you can (green beans, carrots, celery) on the diagonal. It looks pretty and they cook up nicely without breaking apart.",
      "Once all the veggies are in, adjust broth level as needed by adding water and bouillon if you need to. Simmer for 45 minutes or until veggies are tender but not mushy.",
      "Add salt and pepper according to your taste. A little red pepper flakes or cayenne adds a nice kick too.",
      "Keep an eye on the temperature. Once the soup starts bubbling you can turn it down to low and put a lid on the pot. I usually keep the lid cracked, propped open by a wooden spoon so it doesn't get too hot. You want to keep it at a calm simmer, not a boil.",
      "Add rinsed kidney and butter beans. (Can be subbed out for almost any other canned beans. Even frozen lima beans are excellent in this.) Simmer another 10-15 minutes.",
      "IF YOU ADD PASTA: cook the pasta in a separate pot when your soup is already about done. Get it al dente and drain it. Add it at the very end. This way it won't soak up your precious broth as it cooks.",
      "You may serve this soup almost immediately but it definitely benefits from sitting out a while after it's done. I recommend letting it stand at least 20 minutes. Serve it topped with shaved/grated hard Italian cheese and cracked pepper and/or fresh parsley."

      "In a food processor, pulse together the flour, sugar, and salt. Add the butter and pulse until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Add the egg yolk mixture and pulse just until the dough can be gathered into a ball. Flatten into a 6-inch disc, wrap in plastic, and chill several hours or overnight.",
      "Let the dough soften slightly at room temperature before rolling.",
      "Preheat oven to 350 degrees. On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough into a 13-inch round. Fit the dough into a 10 1/2 inch tart pan with a removable bottom. Trim the dough flush with the rim and freeze the tart shell until firm.",
      "Line the shell with foil or parchment, and fill with pie weights, rice, or dried beans. Bake for 20 minutes until set. Remove the foil and weights and bake an additional 10 to 15 minutes until lightly golden. Remove the shell from the oven and immediately brush the hot pastry with the egg white.",
      "When the pastry is almost done baking, assemble the filling. Whisk together the eggs, sugar, orange juice, lemon juice, lemon zest, and orange zest and cream till smooth. Transfer the tart shell to the oven. Place the filling in a pitcher and slowly pour into the shell as high as possible without overfilling. There might be a bit of filling left over.",
      "Bake the tart for approximately 25 minutes, until the filling is barely set. Check the tart after 20 minutes and keep checking it every few minutes after that. It is crucial to not over bake this filling!",
      "Cool to room temperature before serving with berries and whipped cream.",
      "HINT: When rolling tart pastry, always save all the dough scraps in case you need them to repair a crack in a partially baked shell. If the pastry \"bubbles up\" during the baking process, gently prick the pastry with a fork to release air bubbles. Check several times and repeat if necessary. The egg white serves to seal the pastry, which is especially helpful with a liquid filling such as this. It is essential that there be no cracks or holes visible in the partially baked shell. Make any necessary repairs prior to filling."

      "Working with one wrapper at a time, and keeping the remaining wrappers covered with plastic wrap so they don't dry out, place a heaping teaspoon of the pork filling in the center of the wrapper. Using a pastry brush or your fingers, dab a bit of water around the edge of the wrapper to moisten. Crimp the wrapper up and around the filling, squeezing slightly with your fingers to bring the wrapper together like a beggar's pouch.",

Don't cook more than just a few seconds. Remove from the heat and stir in 1/2 of the lemon zest and 1 cup of the almonds. Add to the pasta along with the chicken broth.

Remove the foil and bake another 10 minutes until the bread crumbs get golden brown.",
