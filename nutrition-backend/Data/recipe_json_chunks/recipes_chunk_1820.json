      "Of course you can broil a half chicken or possibly chicken in parts, but when you want a handsome presentation at the table, butterfly is the way to go.",
      "To butterfly a chicken.",
      "First remove the backbone by cutting down close to it on each side with a heavy knife or possibly sturdy shears.",
      "Spread the chicken skin side up on your work surface and bang the breast with your fist to break the collarbones and some of the ribs; this flattens the chicken.",
