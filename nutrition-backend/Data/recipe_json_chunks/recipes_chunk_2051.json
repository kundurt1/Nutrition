      "If you plan to use the starter the same day, allow 1 more hour of fermentation so that it nearly doubles in size.",
      "Otherwise, put the starter in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.",

      "Pour in the water and mix with the paddle attachment on the lowest speed or with a large spoon for about 1 minute to soften the starter.",
      "Add the flour and salt, as well as the yeast (unless youre making the purist version).",

      "Cover the dough and let it rest for 10 minutes.",
      "Do another stretch and fold, then immediately form the dough into a ball, place it in a clean, lightly oiled bowl large enough to contain the dough when it doubles in size, and cover the bowl.",
      "If using the mixed method with instant yeast, refrigerate the dough immediately.",
      "If making the purist version, without instant yeast, let the dough sit at room temperature for 1 1/2 to 2 hours before refrigerating; it wont rise very much, but it should show signs of growth and continue to rise in the refrigerator.",
      "Either version will be ready to use the next day and for up to 3 days.",
      "(If you plan to bake the dough in batches over different days, you can portion the dough and place it into two or more oiled bowls at this stage.)",
      "For the purist version, remove the dough from the refrigerator about 4 hours before you plan to bake; after 2 hours, shape it (see instructions for lean bread, page 48), then let it proof for 2 hours before baking.",
      "For the mixed method, remove the dough from the refrigerator 2 hours prior to baking and shape it right away.",
      "Remove only the portion you wish to bake: 19 ounces (539 g) for a 1-pound (454 g) loaf; 28 ounces (794 g) for a 1 1/2-pound (680 g) loaf, and so on.",

      "Proof for 2 hours as a freestanding loaf, in floured proofing baskets, or on proofing cloths.",

      "It may spread as it rises, but it will grow taller as it bakes.",
      "If using a baking stone, about 45 minutes before baking preheat the oven to 500F (260C) and prepare the oven for hearth baking (see page 30).",
      "Otherwise, just preheat the oven to 500F (260C) about 20 minutes before baking.",
      "Just before baking, score the dough with whatever style of design you prefer (see page 29).",
      "Transfer the dough to the oven, pour 1 cup of hot water into the steam pan, then lower the oven temperature to 450F (232C), or to 425F (218C) if baking a large miche.",
      "Bake for 12 minutes, then rotate the pan and continue baking for 15 to 35 minutes, or longer, depending on the size of the loaf; a large miche could take up to 75 minutes to bake.",
      "When fully baked, the crust should have a rich, caramelized color, the loaf should sound hollow when thumped on the bottom, and the internal temperature should be about 200F (90C) in the center.",

      "A typical pain au levain would substitute 2 to 3 ounces (56.5 to 85 g) of whole grain flour for an equal amount of bread flour, but there really is no limit.",
      "One of the best variations of this bread has crumbled blue cheese (or chunks of any good melting cheese) and toasted nuts or seeds (walnuts are highly recommended).",
      "Add nuts to the dough during the last minute of mixing, using about 25 percent nuts to total flour.",
      "Since the total flour in this recipe is about 34 ounces (964 g), counting the flour in the starter, about 8.5 ounces (241 g) of nuts would be just right.",
      "With the cheese, you can add anywhere between 25 to 45 percent of the weight of the flour; so that would be 8.5 to 15.3 ounces (241 to 434 g).",
      "Fold the cheese in by hand at the end of the mixing or roll it into the dough during shaping (see the crusty cheese bread recipe on page 121)."

      "Cooking the meat and vegetables: Place the Ham hocks and pigs trotters in a large saucepan, cover with the cold water and bring to the boil for 1 minute, skimming to remove the impurities.",
      "(*2) Turn down to a gentle simmer, add the bouquet garni and pepper corns and cook for 3-4 hours (4 hours for large hocks), until the meat is tender enough to pull the small bone out of the meat.",
      "(*3) Add all the vegetables 45 minutes before the end of the cooking time.",
      "Cooking the meat and vegetables: Once the meat is cooked thoroughly, strain through a sieve over a large bowl, separating the meat from the vegetables.",
      "Stir the softened gelatine and white wine vinegar in to the cooking liquor.",
      "(*4) Reserve.",
      "You will only need 400g of cooking liquor to set the terrine, any excess can be used as a wonderful simple soup or used as a broth with noodles etc.",
      "Preparing the elements of the terrine: Once the ham hocks have cooled slightly, place on a large chopping board, peel the rind and fat from the hock, both will come off very easily.",
      "Slice all the fat from the rind and discard and chop the rind in to 1cm pieces (*5).",
      "Preparing the elements of the terrine: Flake the meat from the hock, reserving 3 large pieces following the muscles of the hock.",
      "Add the rind to the flaked meat.",
      "No additional seasoning should be necessary as the hock will have natural seasoning from its cure.",
      "Mix in the drained vegetables and chopped parsley.",
      "Building the terrine: Line the inside of the terrine with 2 layers of cling film for extra support, ensuring that 10cm overlaps the sides and ends of the mould to wrap the terrine in once formed.",
      "Half fill the terrine with the meat and vegetable mixture, (reserving one third of the chopped meat and rind for the top the mould), place the 3 pieces of meat end to end in the middle of the terrine, top with the remaining mixture and pour in enough of the warm cooking liquor to the level of the mixture.",
      "(*6) Lightly press so a thin layer of liquor covers the meat and vegetables.",
      "Gently fold the overhanging cling film to cover the top and place in the fridge overnight for the gelatine to set the terrine.",
      "(*7)",
      "For the soused vegetables: (can be kept up to two weeks in your fridge) In a large saucepan on a high heat, bring to the boil the water, vinegar, honey, thyme, bay and seasoning.",
      "For the soused vegetables: Add the onions and carrots and simmer gently for 20 minutes, add the cauliflower and tarragon, and simmer gently for 10 minutes.",
      "Take off the heat, add the gherkins and cool as quickly as you can.",
      "Once cooled add the chopped Dill and store in airtight jars until needed.",
      "To Serve: Once the terrine has had time to set, gently remove from the mould and tightly wrap in two more layers of cling film so it will be easy to cut.",
      "(*8) Slice the terrine into 12 slices, laying them onto a flat serving dish, removing the cling film as you do so.",
      "To serve, place the soused vegetables in a pot, or on the side of the plate and serve with a basket of freshly toasted pain de campagne."
