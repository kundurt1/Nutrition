      "8. When the cake has cooked, remove from the oven and allow to cool. When the brownie has cooled, remove from its tin and cut into slices. If you like, you can drizzle the brownies with some melted chocolate - I like to do this as it creates extra crunch on top of the brownies once the melted chocolate has set. Now enjoy and indulge!",

Spread the ice cream mixture on top, reserving about 1 cup to frost the sides, if desired. Freeze in the freezer until solid, about 6 hours. When ready to frost the cake, carefully remove the cake from the pan and pull off the acetate sheet. Use the remaining ice cream mixture to \"frost\" the cake. Drizzle the remaining hot fudge sauce on top and decorate the cake with any additional ice cream mixture, nuts, or cherries. Store the cake in the freezer and thaw 5 minutes prior to eating."

    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "To cure the duck legs: pulse coarse sea salt and fresh bay leaves in the food processor until blended together as \"green salt.\" Wash the duck legs and pat dry. Rub the green salt all over the duck legs and make sure every surface is covered. Lay them flat and separated on a tray and refrigerate for at least 12 hours and up to 24 hours.",
      "To confit the duck legs: preheat the oven on 300\u00b0 F (150\u00b0 C). After the duck legs have marinated and sort of \"cured,\" you can discard the liquid that was drawn out of from salting and wash them under water to rinse out all the salt. Pat them very dry with a clean towel, and place them in a deep and narrow pot that's just big enough in diameter to hold the duck legs. The more tightly you pack the legs and the less empty space left in between them and the pot, the less oil you'll need to submerge them. Scatter the peppercorns, thyme, and garlic into the pot. Pour in the duck fat (if you don't have enough duck fat, you could substitute partially with olive oil) until all the ingredients are submerged by at least 1/2 inch (2 centimeters).",
      "Put the lid on, and bake in the oven for 3 to 4 hours, until the meat has completely pulled away from the knuckle and a fork can be easily inserted without any effort. Take the pot out and let it cool down to room temperature. Carefully remove the legs without breaking them, then strain the fat through a sieve into another container. Many recipes would tell you to leave the the duck legs in the fat and refrigerate, but I find it very difficult to separate the duck legs from the cold fat, so here's what I do: I wrap the duck legs very tightly with plastic wrap to prevent drying-out, then refrigerate the legs and fat separately. (The reason for refrigeration is because it's better to work with chilled or cold fat in rillettes for a creamier texture.)",
      "Once the legs and fat are chilled, remove the meat and skin from the legs and discard all the bones. Set the meat in a stand mixer with a paddle attachment. Roughly cut the meat into shorter pieces with a scissor (I find the muscle tissue in duck leg to be quite stringy, but roughly cutting it produces better texture in the rillette). Add 1/4 cup of Dijon mustard, ground white pepper and 1 turn of freshly ground black pepper. With the machine mixing on medium-high speed, start adding in 3/4 cup of duck fat very, very slowly. Do this 1 teaspoon at a time in the beginning and increase the amount after mid-way. The mustard and the fat has to form a beautiful emulsion. If the emulsion breaks, the rillette will taste greasy instead of creamy.",
      "Once 3/4 cup of duck fat is completely incorporated, I stop the machine and taste-test it. In my case, the duck legs were slightly larger than usual, so I ended up adding 2 additional tablespoons of mustard and duck fat. The goal is that the rillette be soft and moist, not dry and craggy.",
      "Transfer the rillette into air-tight containers. Try not to include air pockets. Pour a thin layer of duck fat on top to seal it (in this case it has to be pure duck fat otherwise it won't solidify) and refrigerate it for at least 1 day. Keep the rest of the duck fat for your next confit (some liquid usually comes out of the duck during cooking which should be \"jello-ed\" once chilled, and thus easy to separate from the fat).\r\n\r\nServe on warm, toasted bread with a couple drops of extra virgin olive oil. Dangerously snackable."

      "FOR THE LEMON-CORNMEAL CRUST: In food processor, pulse flour, cornmeal, salt, and lemon zest to combine about 3 times. Scatter butter pieces over the flour mixture, then pulse until the butter is about the size of peas, about 8 to 10 short pulses. Sprinkle 2 tablespoons of water over mixture and pulse a few times, then repeat with 1 tablespoon of water at a time, or just until small curds start to form and dough holds together when pinched with fingers. It'll look kind of crumbly but that's okay. (Alternatively, you can do this by hand.)",
      "Empty dough onto clean counter or piece of wax paper. Using bench scraper, gather dough into a rough rectangular mound about 12 inches long and 4 inches wide. Starting from the farthest end, use the heel of your hand to smear about one sixth of dough against your work surface away from you. Repeat until all of your dough has been smeared. Using bench scraper, gather the dough again into a 12-inch long and 4-inch wide mound and repeat smearing of dough with heel of hand. The dough should be smooth and cohesive at this point; if not, repeat smearing process again. Form dough into 4 inch disk, wrap in plastic, and refrigerate until firm about 1 hour. The smearing process creates long layers of butter in the dough, which translates to long flaky layers in the cooked crust.",
      "Heat the oven to 400\u00b0 F while preparing filling and assembling pandowdy.",
      "FOR THE FILLING:\r\nIn a 10-inch ovenproof skillet over medium heat, melt the butter completely; cook until it turns brown and smells nutty, about 4 to 6 minutes. Be sure to stir frequently, scraping up any bits from the bottom so they don't burn. Take the pan off heat. Add fruit, brown sugar, cornstarch, lemon juice, and pinch of salt to the brown butter, stirring gently to evenly incorporate all of the ingredients. (A note about thickener and sweetener: if your fruit is particularly juicy -- e.g, if you're using all blackberries -- you may want to increase the cornstarch to about 1 tablespoon. Add more brown sugar to taste if your fruit is on the tart side.)",
      "TO ASSEMBLE AND BAKE:\r\nOn a lightly floured work surface, roll dough into a 12-inch round, dusting with flour as needed. (Don't worry if your dough isn't perfectly round.) Gently lay round of dough atop the fruit filling, tucking the dough edges around the fruit, leaving a small rim that sticks up against the side of the skillet. Brush with egg white and then sprinkle evenly with turbinado sugar. Poke a few small holes in the crust so steam can vent.",
      "Bake pandowdy for about 30 minutes, then remove from oven and break the dough into large pieces with a sharp knife to \"dowdy\" its looks. Return to oven and bake until the crust is golden and the fruit juices are bubbling up through the crust pieces, about 20 to 30 minutes longer. (I recommend putting a baking sheet underneath your skillet to catch any fruit juice that may bubble over.) Allow to cool at least 20 minutes. Even when fully cool, the pandowdy will have lots of juice, part of its charm, so serve in bowls with spoons. Vanilla ice cream, freshly whipped cream, or creme fraiche is highly recommended."

Pull in any flour clinging to the bottom or side of the bowl and knead the ball together for about 30 seconds. It should feel smooth and retain its ball shape. Let the dough ball hang out in the bowl for 30 minutes while you tackle the corn.",
      "The Corn: Remove the husks and silk, wash off the ears, and use a knife to cut the kernels into a large bowl. Add the juice from a medium lemon or 2 small limes. If you're having a citrus crisis, a small orange will also work. Sprinkle the cumin (less if you're not sure, more if you are a cumin addict) over the corn. Mix the juice and cumin in, cover the bowl with a plate and let it sit until the tortillas are done.",
      "Welcome back to the dough! Divide the ball into 8 equal pieces and let them rest on the counter or a plate for another 10-15 minutes. Heat a heavy skillet or cast iron pan on a medium flame/stove setting. Lightly flour a counter or cutting board. Take a mini dough ball, gently smash it into a disk, and roll it out to a roughly circular shape of about 7 inches diameter. Don't worry if your circle looks like an amoeba or has corners...it's all going to work out. The rolled out dough should feel smooth and elastic. The pan should be hot by now. Brush any excess flour off of the dough and place the tortilla flat in the pan. Wait for 30 seconds to a minute for the magic to happen. Bubbles should appear. After you see them, flip the tortilla over. The top side should have nice brown spots and the tortilla should start to rise. This process always takes longer with the first one. Flip it again and you should see additional bubbles expanding. When it is has a cooked tortilla appearance, transfer it to the middle of a folded towel. Repeat the process with the other 7 balls. I can usually roll out one tortilla while another is cooking.",
      "After your tortillas are cooked, saute the corn in the pan on medium with 1-2 tbsp of olive oil until it turns a golden color and tastes tender and sweet. Put the corn in a holding bowl or plate.",
      "The Greens: Wash the greens and leeks. Thinly slice the white and light green part of the leeks. Slice or dice the garlic to a size that makes you happy. Slice the beet greens into strips and chop the stems. The size of the pieces doesn't matter. If you don't want to have a dangling green while you inhale the quesadillas, opt for smaller sections. Saute the leeks and garlic in 1-2 tbsp olive oil on medium until the garlic is lightly browned and the leeks have separated. I use the same skillet for everything. Add in the beet greens and stir everything together. Saute the mix until the beet greens are dark green and tender. Place the greens in a holding bowl or plate.",
      "The finale: Group your corn and greens holding bowls and grated gouda near the skillet. You need easy access to all of the supplies. If there's still oil remaining in your skillet, wipe it out with a paper towel or some other magical absorptive material. Heat the pan on medium. When it is warm, put a tortilla in. After a minute, flip the tortilla over. The surface should feel hot. Layer some smoked gouda (the amount that matches your love of cheesy goodness), the corn mix, the green mix, and a bit more gouda onto one half of the tortilla. You can choose the amount of each substance, but you want the tortilla to close when you fold the other half over. Push down the upper tortilla surface with a spatula until the quesadilla holds together. Flip the quesadilla after 1-2 minutes (and your desired level of tortilla toastiness) and cook on the other side for an additional 2-3 minutes until all of the cheese is melted. Place the quesadilla on a serving or cutting board and repeat the process with the remaining 7 tortillas. We eat the finished product with fresh guacamole and smoked hot sauce, but they should be tasty plain as well."

Simmer for 5 minutes, then add the bacon. Taste for seasoning, then add creole seasoning, salt, and pepper as needed.",

Add 1 sprig of rosemary, 3 cloves of garlic, 2 teaspoons sea salt, 3 tablespoons olive oil, freshly ground pepper, and sage. Heat the oven to 145 C, cover the pot, and bake for 60 to 90 minutes (the time will depend on the age of the beans). Taste to ensure that the beans are soft enough to eat and watch that they don't disintegrate.\r\n\r\nIf you don't have the time or inclination to make the beans yourself, then you have a couple options:\r\n\r\nVariation 1: Take 2 tins of cannellini beans and put them into a saucepan along with their liquid. Add 2 sprigs of rosemary, 3 cloves of garlic, peeled, 2 leaves of sage, finely chopped and bring to a simmer for 30 minutes, adding a bit of water if needed and stirring occasionally. Drain the beans, remove the garlic and rosemary and throw away. Proceed from step 3. This variation is a good option if you are pressed for time but the bean flavour and the texture for fresh or dry beans is much nicer than the tinned variety.\r\n\r\nVariation 2: Substitute the beans with 4 potatoes. Add the unpeeled potatoes to a medium sized saucepan and cover with cold water. Add 1 teaspoon of salt to the potatoes and boil until the potatoes are fork tender but not disintegrating. Remove the potatoes with a slotted spoon and remove the skin while still hot. Cut into 2 cm pieces and toss with 2 tablespoons olive oil, 1 tablespoon vinegar, salt and pepper and then proceed from step 3."

Crack two eggs into a separate bowl and whisk up until blended. \r\n\r\nDip a piece of pork in the whisked egg to coat and immediately put into the breadcrumb mixture. Press down to coat the pork, and then flip to coat the other side. Let that rest on a plate and repeat with remaining pork.\r\n\r\nHeat 2 tbsp olive oil in a saute pan on med-low heat. Cook breaded pork a couple of minutes per side until it's golden brown and crispy. I cut into it at the thickest part to make sure it's done (no pink). Lightly salt and set aside.",

It should turn out thick and creamy, like the consistency of mayonnaise.",

Spread the aioli on each inner side. Lay the breaded pork on the bottom slice, and top with a few leaves of arugula and thin slices of pecorino romano to cover. Top with top 1/2 of ciabatta.\r\n\r\nGrill in panini press, or if you don't have one of those but do have a grill pan (like me) put in grill pan, cover with parchment paper and then put a frying pan with 2 large cans of tomatoes in it on top. Press down. Flip sandwich and repeat.\r\n\r\nCut sandwich in 1/2 and prepare for breaded pork....bliss. Not kidding.\r\n\r\nNote: For safety's sake, raw egg is not recommended for infants, pregnant women, and people with weakened immune systems. To avoid the risk of salmonella, buy your eggs from a reputable source, and take care when separating the yolks and whites, so that the contents of the egg do not come in contact with the outer part of the shell.

      "Heat chicken stock and 1 tablespoon fish sauce in a 4- to 6-quart stock pot over medium-high heat. Remove the outer tough and battered leaves from the lemongrass. Cut the root ends off, leaving enough to hold the leaves together, then cut the stalks into 6-inch long pieces. Carefully cut the stalks into halves lengthwise. Add to the stock. Peel the ginger and cut it into 1/8-inch planks; add them to the stock. Smash and peel the garlic cloves, trying to keep the cloves intact; add them to the stock. Remove the stem ends from the chiles, then cut the chiles in half lengthwise and use a spoon to scrape out the seeds. Add the chiles to the stock. Increase the heat to high and bring the stock to a simmer.",
      "While the stock is heating, prep the chicken breasts. If they are boneless and skinless, trim any excess fat. If they are bone-in and skin-on, remove the skins and trim any excess fat. Set them aside until the stock has reached a simmer.",
      "Start prepping the carrots and potatoes. Peel the carrots and cut away the stem end. Using a julienne peeler (or very good knife skills), julienne away the outer layers of the carrots so you have skinnier carrots of fairly even diameter from top to bottom. Set the julienned carrot aside for garnishing the finished soup. Cut the now skinny carrots into 1/2- to 3/4-inch rounds. Place rounds into a prep bowl. Wash (and scrub if needed) the baby potatoes. Cut them into quarters or halves depending on their size. If cutting in halves, cut them lengthwise rather than crosswise to increase cooking surface area. You want to have roughly equal parts carrot and potato. Add the potatoes to the cut carrots. Add 1/4 cup peanuts to the bowl as well.",
      "The stock may reach a simmer before you finish prepping the carrots and potatoes. When it does, take a small spoonful, cool it a bit, and taste for salt. It should be just a bit on the salty side so it can season the chicken and the veggies; it will seem less salty once the soup is finished. Adjust with either more fish sauce or salt (this will vary depending on the salt in the stock/broth and the brand of fish sauce you use -- trust your palate!). Add the chicken, and reduce the heat to maintain a gentle simmer. Simmer until the chicken is cooked through, about 15 to 20 minutes (cut into a breast to check -- there shouldn't be any pink).",
      "While the chicken is cooking, finish prepping the carrots and potatoes if needed. Prep the scallions by removing any wilted \"leaves\" and root ends. Cut the scallions into thin, bias-cut slices, including all but the last few inches of the greens. Set aside. (There will probably be extra time here, so get the curry powder and coconut milk measured, and open the packages of udon noodles, then start clean-up.)",
      "Once the chicken is done, remove it to a plate. Strain the aromatics from the stock, either by using a skimmer or by pouring the mix through a strainer into a large bowl. Return stock to pot if needed, and stir in curry powder. Increase heat to medium-high, and return the stock to a simmer. Add the carrots, potatoes, and peanuts; simmer until tender, adjusting heat as needed, about 10 minutes.",
      "After the chicken has cooled at least 5 minutes, shred the meat into reasonably bite-sized shreds. Discard bones and gristle if present.",
      "Once the carrots and potatoes are tender, stir in the coconut milk, shredded chicken (and any accumulated juices), about 3/4 of the sliced scallions, and the udon noodles. Cook until udon noodles and chicken are heated through, about 2 minutes. Taste and adjust seasoning with either salt or fish sauce if needed. Remove from heat, and serve -- dividing between bowls, and topping each bowl with julienned carrots, and garnishing with scallions and peanuts.",
      "(Note: I've also made this with a full can of coconut milk, but find the coconut becomes a bit of a flavor bully. If you're a big fan of coconut, feel free to go this route, but serve the soup with a squeeze of lime to help balance the flavor better.)"

      "Place cardamom and cinnamon in a small to medium saucepan over low heat. Toast spices in pan, stirring occasionally, for about 2 minutes, until fragrant. Remove from heat, whisk in the brown sugar, salt, cream, and milk. Return to medium heat, whisking regularly and watching closely for about 4-5 minutes, until mixture begins to boil and suddenly bubbles up the sides of the pan. At this moment, quickly remove from heat, then cover while proceeding with next steps.",
      "Generously butter a deep glass baking pan, 8 to 9\" inch square; set pan aside. \r\n\r\nOn a cutting board, liberally stab each naan with a paring knife (don't miss the outer edges), on both sides, to create extra holes. Then cut each naan into 10-12 triangles like a pizza; set aside. \r\n\r\nSeparate any stuck-together apple rings, and discard any hard pieces such as stems or cores. Cut any large rings into halves or thirds for bite-sized ease; set aside.",
      "Place a layer of naan triangles in the bottom of the buttered pan, fitting them together to make a single level of bread. (Tip: If your naan has a darker, more toasted side, it's best to place this side UP for the bottom layer only, so that the toasted side does not get even more toasted by facing down against the bottom of the pan.) Top with an even layer of apple rings (using half the apple rings), then sprinkle evenly with half the raisins. Repeat with another layer of naan, apples and raisins, and then a final layer of naan. Set aside.",
      "In a heatproof bowl, whisk together the eggs and egg yolks until blended and even; set nearby. \r\n\r\nRemove the lid from the pan of warm milk and give it a good stir. Gradually pour about 1 cup of the warm milk mixture into the eggs, and immediately whisk well, until smooth. Add the rest of the milk mixture and mix well. \r\n\r\nAdd the orange zest and stir until evenly dispersed. Slowly pour all of the custard over the layered naan, pressing top down firmly to ensure it gets soaked. Cover with foil and place in fridge for 8 to 10 hours (ideally overnight).",
      "While the naan soaks, make the caramel sauce. (You can also do this while the pudding bakes, but doing it earlier will allow it to cool to the desired consistency.) \r\n\r\nIn a small saucepan, whisk together the sugar, cardamom and salt. Add the water and stir gently to combine. Place over medium heat and cook without stirring (you may gently swirl the pan once or twice, being careful not let mixture splash up the sides of the pan). \r\n\r\nCook until the liquid is clear, bubbling vigorously, and not at all grainy. Increase heat and boil for 3-5 minutes, staying nearby, and remove from heat just when liquid becomes a deep amber color. (Watch closely; it can burn quickly.) \r\n\r\nWith pan away from heat, slowly pour in the cream. It will bubble and sputter when added, and may initially form a solid caramel ball - but not to worry: this will cook away. \r\n\r\nReturn to low-medium heat and stir constantly with a wooden spoon for about 3-5 minutes, until caramel has become frothy and thickened. (Tip: Caramel will appear thinner when hot. Check its thickness it by dripping a dot on a cool plate). Remove from heat and let cool.",
      "When ready to bake the soaked pudding, preheat oven to 350 F and heat some water. Keep the foil over the pudding pan and place it inside a larger casserole or cake pan. Fill larger pan with warm to hot water until it reaches halfway up the pan, then bake.",
      "The bake time ultimately takes an about an hour and 45 minutes. At the halfway mark, carefully pull back the foil and push down the top layer with a heatproof spoon to ensure continued soaking. Re-cover, rotate pan 180 degrees and continue baking. \r\n\r\nPudding is done just when the custard in the center is no longer liquidy; if unsure, check the center with a paring knife, gently prying it open to look at the inner consistency. Remove from oven.",
      "Just when cool enough to handle, slice into 9-12 squares and serve warm, drizzled with caramel sauce. This bread pudding is best just after baking. But if not eating it all right away, store covered at room temperature for up to 24 hours, or covered in the fridge for up to 48 hours, being sure to reheat before serving."

      "Cook the bigne slowly over low heat, turning them occasionally, for about 10 minutes, or until they are golden and very puffed, turning the heat up every so slightly towards the end. During frying they should split partially and begin growing further-this gives them their characteristic \"bumpy\" look. If they brown too quickly too early, the oil is too hot and you need to turn the heat down. When done, leave to drain on kitchen paper and continue frying the rest of the batter.

    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "Put all ingredients together in a large bowl and stir together so it all holds as a dough. Then take it out of the bowl and start kneading it on your kitchen counter. At first your dough will seem sturdy and on the dry side, after kneading a while (count until 200 kneads in your head for example or just sing along loudly with top 40 hits for 15 minutes as I prefer), you will notice that it will absorb more and more flour. Just feed the dough with as much all-purpose flour as it will need to not stick to the counter top and don't look at the numbers too much. Kneading comes down to pushing and folding the dough over and over again. After kneading for a while you will notice that the dough gains more elasticity due to the gluten developing. To test whether you have kneaded the dough long enough, just make a ball out of it and push your finger lightly into it. Once the bread bounces back, you have reached the right consistency.",
      "Lay down the dough on a chopping board and slice it into 10 or 12 pieces. I would advise you to weigh all different pieces to make sure they have the same weight (this will make sure all pieces bake equally). Roll the pieces into balls with your hands and lie them out on a piece of baking paper (you won't have to transfer it after proving). Lie a clean kitchen towel on top of the dough and leave it out on your kitchen counter for at least 10 hours, any time longer will improve the taste and rise. Overnight, the size of the rolls will have doubled. By this time they are ready to bake.",
      "To achieve a good crust, crank up your oven to its maximum temperature (in my case this is 260 degrees Celsius). Leave your baking tray (preferably heavy duty steel or alternatively a muffin tray) in the oven while it is heating up. After the oven has reached the desired temperature, take the baking tray (carefully!) out and lay the baking paper with dough on it (it might even sizzle a little). Return to the oven with speed to lose as little heat as possible, and turn down the heat to 200 degrees Celsius. The initial heat will crisp up the exterior, while the lowered heat will make sure that the inside will bake evenly and airy. Keep an eye on the rolls. Depending on different factors such as your oven, the flour you used and the weather (not kidding;)) your baking times will differ between 20-30 minutes. The rolls are ready when they are easily picked up from the baking paper and sound hollow when you tap on it.",
      "Note: I have added simple green olives to this dough as I really like the saltiness and juiciness these olives bring. In my view they also keep the bread fresher for longer. You could easily leave them out or substitute them with for example soaked dried tomatoes. I would be careful with ingredients that contain a lot of oil (such as dried tomatoes on oil) as they will change the structure of the bread and speed up the baking process."

With your knife, make a few lengthwise slices in the avocado, being careful not to slice through the avocado skin. Then, use a spoon to scoop out the avocado flesh from the skin -- you should now have several thin wedges of avocado. If you wish to have more avocado in your sandwich, repeat with the other half. To remove the pit, I carefully tap the sharp edge of a knife into the pit until it embeds in the pit. Then, twist the knife and lift -- the pit should dislodge from the flesh. Getting the pit off the knife can be tricky. Safest way is to use a spoon to scoop it out, but I usually thwack it on the cutting board.",

While corn is heating up with the rest of the sweated out vegetable mixture, add about 1-2 cups of corn stock and turn heat to medium-low heat. \r\n\r\nChowder is done when peppers are crisp yet tender, and the corn is soft but still has its shape. The consistency of the chowder should be chunky, but broth-y enough that you need a spoon to take a bite. Season chowder with salt and pepper to taste (careful not to over salt as the clams will add a salty/ briny flavor to the chowder).",
      "Corn Stock:\r\nAfter you have cleaned your grilled corn, take all the corn husks, cobs, and hairs and place in a large stock pot. Add enough water to cover the corn leftovers by half (about 3 qts water). Place the stock on a burner over high heat. Bring corn stock to a boil. Once at a boil, turn the heat to low and place a lid on the pot. \r\nAfter about 20-30 minutes corn stock with begin to taste like corn and smell like corn. The starches from the husks and cobs should've thickened the stock. Strain the corn stock to remove all fibers and bits leaving only the corn liquid. \r\n\r\nNext, refer to the chowder recipe above, keeping in mind that as soon as you've cut the grilled corn off the cob, start the corn stock. The stock shouldn't take more than 30 minutes, thus the stock can be working on the stovetop while you're cutting and sweating out the onions, peppers, and garlic.",
      "Steaming Clams in Corn Chowder:\r\nTake a large spoonful (at least 1/2 cup) of corn chowder and place in a small pot, add 6 cleaned clams, and a splash of corn stock to the pot, place a lid on pot and turn on high heat. The chowder will heat up as the clams are steaming, once all the clams have opened, take the pot off the burner and place the steamed clams in the middle of your serving bowl. Prior to adding the broth, scoop out the chowder with a spoon, and delicately distribute over the steamed clams. Pour the remaining liquid over the clams so the clams are sitting in a broth. Garnish with chiffonade parsley, quartered cherry tomatoes, and finishing olive oil (a good quality olive oil) drizzled over the dish. \r\n\r\nThe same method can be varied to serve more than one serving of 6 clams at a time. Use the same ratio quantities of 1/2c. corn chowder, a splash of corn stock, and 6 clams per serving in 2 larger pots that can accommodate room for more clams."

If they seem dry, add a bit more mayonnaise. Taste for more seasoned lemon juice and add as necessary. Sometimes I have used the full amount of juice, sometimes a little less. Finish with freshly ground black pepper to taste. Enjoy!"

Place the mixture into the springform pan and press it into the bottom, evening out and flattening the crust. Set aside.",

It's important to have the cheese at room temperature, otherwise it won't beat properly. Add the granulated sugar and beat to incorporate. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well before adding another. Add the vanilla extract and place the mixer on medium-low speed. With the mixer running, slowly add the heavy cream in a stream. Once added, raise the speed to medium high and beat until the entire mixture is smooth. You may need to scrape the bowl with a spatula and beat the mixture some more if there are any lumps at the bottom.",
      "Pour the filling into the prepared crust. Set the springform pan into the center of a larger square or rectangular pan that is at least 1-1 1/2 inches deep. Boil some water in a kettle or put hot tap water in a pitcher and pour the water into the rectangular pan so that the water is at least 1/2 inch to 1 inch deep (be careful not to get water into the springform pan with the cheesecake).

      "2. Wash your potatoes, place them in a steamer, cover, and steam for approximately 30 minutes, or until fork-tender. The cook time will vary based on the size of your potatoes. I would say that mine were medium sized.",
      "3. Once you have your potatoes in the steamer, cut up your mushrooms and onions and place them in a skillet with 2 Tbsp of butter. You'll be cooking them slowly over medium-low heat for 35 minutes without allowing the onions to brown. This will result in sweet, caramelized onions.",
      "4. While the potatoes and onions are cooking, baste your steak with 2 tsp olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. My directions have you cooking 4 oz of steak per person. I chose this because it's a healthier serving size, but if you're having company, you might consider 6-8 oz per person. Coat the frying pan with 1/2 tsp olive oil and heat over medium-high heat for 1 to 2 minutes. For cooking steak I prefer an uncoated pan because I find that I can get a better sear.",
      "5. I used sirloin for this recipe, which is a cheaper, but tougher piece of meat. Because of this, it's particularly important not to overcook the steak. I would shoot for medium rare to medium depending on your doneness preferences. The cooking time will vary slightly based on the size of your steak. I cooked mine for 2 minutes on the first side, flipped it, and cooked it an additional minute. The best test for doneness is touch (which takes a little practice). If you make a fist and touch that fatty area between your thumb and index finger, that's what your steak should feel like. Soft, but a little firm. I know this is vague, but if you cook a few steaks and practice using this method you might have a few screw ups, but you'll learn, and then you'll be the steak master! After you're done cooking the steak, remove it from the pan and allow it to rest on a cutting board while you prep your potatoes.",

      "Trim the ends off the onion and remove the skin, but leave it whole. In a stock pot, at least a gallon in size, add 3 quarts of water, beans, the whole onion, fresh sage, oil, and salt. The amount of oil can be adjusted depending on the size of your pot, but the idea is to entirely cover the top surface of the water, and it's ok if some sage is sticking up through the oil \"lid\". The flavorful oils from the sage should end up infusing the oil and mixing beautifully into the finished soup, so reduce if you must, but don't exclude the olive oil. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat, cover, and simmer lightly until beans are cooked through, at least an hour.",
      "When the beans are fully cooked, fish out the sage and the onion with a slotted spoon, and discard. Then, spoon out about half of the beans and set them aside in a bowl. (If you like a smoother soup, take out fewer beans, 1/4 - 1/2 is a good amount to leave whole). Puree the beans and broth that remain in the pot with an immersion blender until smooth. Add the reserved, whole beans back in. Adjust salt to your liking, add pepper if desired.",
      "Ladle into a bowl, and drizzle with a little bit of truffle oil, about 1 Tablespoon per bowl, enough to make an attractive spiral. The flavor of truffle oil goes a long way with only a small amount. If you have extra sage, it makes a pretty garnish. Sometimes, I'll fry a few of the extra leaves in hot vegetable oil for about twenty seconds to make a crispy, delicious, classy looking garnish, but the truffle oil alone is pretty enough. Enjoy!"

In the end, you'll have a sweet, lovely corned beef, full of flavor. Frankly, I loved the veggies done this way as well, they were perfect."

    "title": "grilled bratwurst appetizer with dijon-cheddar fondue, caramelized onions, and basil",
    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "For the bratwurst: Put the bratwurst in a pot and cover with water (or beer). Bring the pot up to a boil, then reduce the heat to simmer and cover the pot. Leave the pot on the heat until the brats are cooked through, about 10-15 minutes. Remove the brats from the liquid and then slice each brat into 6 pieces (that means you'll have 36 appetizers, so if you need more, cook more brats).\r\n\r\nGet a saute pan out over medium high heat. At this point, we are just going to brown the sausages up for some extra flavor. Add the sausage into the pot (you may need to do this in batches) until all of the sausage is nicely browned. Drain on paper towels, and wait until ready to assemble.",
      "For the Caramelized Onions: \r\nGet a pan over medium heat and add the butter. Once the butter melts, add the onions and season with salt. Toss to coat in the butter and turn the heat to medium low. Add the thyme, and let the onions slowly brown and caramelize, about 20-25 minutes. Add the garlic cloves and cook for another 5 minutes. Remove the thyme sprigs, add the black pepper, and taste to ensure there is enough salt. The onions should be sweet, brown, and still retaining a lovely silky texture.\r\n\r\nIf your onions are browning too fast or getting black, add a little bit of water (1/4 cup) to the pan to deglaze and let you control temperature. You could easily use the water (or beer) you are boiling for the brats",
      "For the Dijon-Cheddar Fondue:\r\nLet the butter melt in a pot and add the onion. Season with the salt and let cook until the onion is translucent. Add the flour and using a wooden spoon, get all of the flour incorporated into the butter. Let cook for about 5 minutes to get rid of the raw flour taste. While whisking, add in 2 cups of milk and make sure to incorporate, and then add the other two cups. Let the mixture come to a boil and then reduce it to a simmer.\r\n\r\n*NOTE: The sauce must come to a boil in order for the flour's thickening agent to start working. If you simply simmer the sauce, it will never get thick.\r\n\r\nWhen the sauce is at the proper consistency, whisk in the 2 cups of cheese, over low heat and whisk until melted. Keep your heat low here, because if it is too high, then the cheese will curdle, and you'll have a grainy sauce.\r\n\r\nRight at the end, once the cheese is fully melted, add the mustard, whisk it in, and then shut off the heat. Taste it - it should be rich, cheesy, and mustardy!",
      "To Assemble:\r\n\r\nFirst, toast your hot dog buns. When toasted, split the buns in half, and cut each half into 6 equal pieces. This way, you'll have 1 bun for each brat (again, adjust to how many people you are serving, you'll have plenty of onions & fondue for whatever you do).\r\n\r\nOn the toast, add a little bit of cheese sauce, cradle the brats in the cheese, add a little bit on onions on top, and garnish with a small basil leaf. When you put the brats on a plate, add some paprika for a touch of color and spicy kick. You could also add cayenne."

It can be from the tap as long as the tap runs cold. If your tap runs hot, you could quickly chill a teaspoon of water with an ice cube.

Try to make it so you can make 6 3-inch biscuits. Cut out biscuits. Briefly knead remaining dough, and shape so you can get 2 more biscuits.

Remove from the heat and turn the oven down to 170 degrees Celsius. Take what cooking juices have come from the meat and place in a saucepan with the sugar. Stir on a high heat until the sugar has melted and pour over the meat. Cover the joint with tin foil and return to the oven. Continue to cook for 5 hours, occasionally basting the meat, making sure to always cover with tin foil before returning to the oven.",

Add water to cover the rice and two large pinches of salt. Bring to a boil. Once boiling, turn heat down slightly and let cook for about 10 minutes. A few minutes before your rice is done, add a cup of cold water. This apparently shocks the rice, elongating the shape. Taste your rice throughout the cooking process. Once the texture of the rice is al dente but cooked, transfer to a fine mesh strainer and rinse with cold water.",

Pour in about a quarter to a third of your cooked rice and stir until well combined with the oil and yogurt mixture. Smooth so that you have an even layer of this rice mixture at the bottom of the pot. Add the remaining plain rice to the top and mold into a cone shape so that none of it touches the edges of your pot. Cook with lid on on medium to medium low heat for about 40 minutes or until the layer of rice at the bottom has cooked and become crispy, but not burnt! About halfway through the process I was taught to drape a tea towel over the pot and then put the lid on in order to keep moisture in the rice.",

Using your hands, rub the butter into the flour mixture until it is crumbly. Pour milk into a small bowl and add vanilla. Slowly pour half this mixture into the flour mixture and mix gently with your hands or a fork, just enough to dampen; do not over work it. Pour in the rest to make crumbly dough that will hold together when pressed (like wet sand). Transfer the crumbly mixture to a 9.5 inch pie plate (or tart pan) and pat out the dough to cover the bottom of the pan, and slightly up the sides.",
      "3. Starting on the outside, arrange the plums overlapping in a circle over the pastry; filling in the center with any plums that are left; plums should fit snugly. Evenly sprinkle over the cooled cherries. In a small bowl, combine 1/2 cup sugar, 2 tablespoons flour, 1/4 teaspoon salt and 2 tablespoons of cold, diced butter. Like with the crust, use your hands to rub the butter into the dry ingredients until it is crumbly. Sprinkle the butter mixture over the top of the tart. Bake for 30 minutes and rotate the dish. Bake for another 5 minutes, rotate again and then bake for a final 5 minutes. Tart should look shiny with thick bubbles in between the fruit and the crust should be slightly brown. Cool on a rack. Serve warm or room temperature with vanilla bean ice cream or slightly sweetened whipped cream."

    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "Artichokes alla romana are served with the stems attached, so be careful not to snap them off while trimming the artichokes. Begin preparing an artichoke by bending back and snapping off the outer leaves. Do not pull the leaves off all the way to the base, because the whitish bottom of the leaf is tender, and edible. As you get deeper into the artichoke, the leaves will snap off farther and farther from the base. Keep pulling off leaves until you expose the central cone of leaves that are green only at the tips and whose paler, whitish base is at least 1 1/2 inches high.",
      "Slice at least an inch off the top of the entire central cone, eliminating all the green part. Don't be afraid to trim too much-you are eliminating only the tough, inedible portions. Rub with the lemon half, squeezing juice over the cut portions of the artichoke so that they won't discolor.",
      "You can now look into the center of the artichoke, where you will find at the bottom some very small, pale leaves with some prickly tips curving inward. Cut off all the little leaves and scrape away the fuzzy \"choke\" beneath them, being careful not to cut away any of the heart of the other tender parts (a rounded point on the knife can be helpful). Return to the outside of the artichoke and pare away the green parts of the leaves at the base, leaving only the white.",
      "All that is left to trim now is the outer part of the stem. Turning the artichoke upside down, you will note that from the bottom of the stem that the stem has a whitish core surrounded by a layer of green. Trim away all the green up to the base of the artichoke, keeping only the white part. Be careful not to detach the stem, and always rub the cut portions with lemon juice so that they will not discolor.",
      "In a bowl, mix the chopped parsley, the chopped garlic, the mint leaves, and the salt. Set aside one-third of the mixture and press the rest into the cavity of each artichoke, rubbing it well into the sides of the cavity.",
      "Choose a heavy-bottomed casserole just large enough to contain the artichokes, which are to go in standing, and provided with a tight-fitting lid. Place the artichokes, tops facing down and stems facing upward, in the casserole. Rub the rest of the parsley, garlic, and mint mixture on the outside of the artichokes. Add all the oil and enough water to cover one-third of the artichoke leaves, not the stems. Soak two thicknesses of paper towels in water (since the moist towels help to keep the steam that cooks the stems inside the pot, they must be wide enough to cover the casserole). Place the towels over the casserole and put the lid over the paper towels. Bend the corners of the paper towels back over the lid. Cook over medium heat for about 35 or 40 minutes, until tender and easily pierced by a fork.\r\n\r\nCooking times vary according to freshness and tenderness of the artichokes. (If the artichokes are tough and take long to cook, you may have to add 2 or 3 tablespoons of water from time to time. If they cook rapidly and there is too much water left in the pot, uncover and boil it away rapidly. Do not worry if the edges of the leaves next to the bottom of the pot start to brown; it improves their flavor.)",
      "Transfer the artichokes to a serving platter, arranging them always with the stems pointing up (Bear in mind that the stems are not merely decorative. They have an excellent flavor and they are to be eaten along with the rest of the artichoke.). Reserve the oil and juices from the pot and pour them over the artichokes just before serving. They should be served either lukewarm or at room temperature. The ideal temperature at which to serve them, if you can arrange it, is when they are no longer hot, but haven't quite completely cooled off.",
      "Try to prepare them the same day they are going to be eaten because, like most cooked greens, they lose part of their flavor when refrigerated."

If you are not comfortable leaving egg whites out overnight, age them for a couple of days in the refrigerator.\r\nIf you are a beginner at piping or want absolutely even-sized macarons, trace/draw 1.25-inch (approx 3 cm) circles about 1 1/2 inches apart on a \"template\" piece of parchment. Cut 3 additional pieces of parchment ahead of time to fit cookie sheets and when it's time to pipe the batter, lay the blank parchment pieces over the template and use as a guide to pipe (the template can be easily pulled out after piping and re-used)",

Reduce the speed to low and stream the granulated sugar into the bowl with the mixer running. When the sugar has been added, turn the speed up to high and whisk the meringue until it holds firm, shiny peaks. Add the brown food coloring at this point, a little at a time and adjust to desired color.",
      "With a flexible spatula, fold the almond mixture into the egg whites until completely incorporated, scraping along the sides and then up and under the middle of the bowl several times. Avoid leaving streaks of meringue or unincorporated almond mixture - this can lead to cracking in the macaron shells. When fully incorporated the mixture should have the consistency of magma - if you form a peak, it should slowly sink back into the batter. Avoid over-mixing the batter or it will become too runny and the shells will not rise properly.",
      "Using a piping bag fitted with a small (3/8-inch, 1 cm) round tip, pipe the macarons in small circles, about 1.25-1.5 inches in diameter. Rap the baking sheets a couple of times on a flat surface, and let the piped batter sit for 15-30 minutes.

It should come together and leave the sides and bottom of the bowl and look noticeably different from the first mixing. If it doesn't, add some bread flour by tablespoons until it does. Stop mixer and test for a windowpane by pulling off a walnut-size piece of dough, and gently stretch it over your fingertips. You want to get the center as thin as possible without it tearing. This tells you if you've adequately developed the gluten, and you bread should for a perfect, beautiful dome when you bake it. If at first it doesn't windowpane, continue kneading in 2-minute increments until it does reach a good, strong windowpane.",

I'm known to refer to my oven as Barbie and Ken's oven, in which I baked this for 50 minutes, rotating loaves halfway through the bake time. Bread is done when it reaches an internal temp of 185. It's a good idea to get a temp on it at 30-35 minutes and add time accordingly. Clearly I need to join the 21st century of ovens.",

If you are using a candy thermometer you will notice the mixture hovers near the boiling point for a while then starts to climb fairly rapidly. As the mixture approaches 300\u00b0 F, you will want to start swirling it fairly frequently as caramelization is imminent. Once caramel color is to your liking remove pan from heat.

Stir often, scraping the bottom of the pan. As you get close to your target temperature you may want to turn the heat down to low if you are using a gas stove, or off if you are using electric to slow things down.

      "First, roast the broccoli. Pre-heat the oven to 350. Transfer the broccoli florets to a baking dish and give them a generous drizzle of olive oil and a sprinkle of salt. Toss it all together to coat the broccoli, then get the dish into the oven for 15 minutes. While it cooks, start on the risotto. Heat a dash of olive oil in a large skillet with deep sides over medium high heat. Heat the chicken stock in a small pot on low heat just to warm it up on the burner either next to or behind the skillet.",
      "Get the diced chicken into the large skillet and let it get completely cooked through and slightly golden on the outside for about 5 minutes. Remove it to a plate with a slotted spoon. The broccoli should also be done at this point, so take it out and set it aside. Then melt the butter in the skillet and add the arborio rice. Let the rice gently toast and absorb into the rice for a minute, then add the beer. Let the rice completely absorb the beer.",
      "Now the patience comes in. Ladle in about 3 scoops of the warm chicken broth and stir it in continuously with the rice until it is completely absorbed. Keep repeating this until the stock is all used up and the rice is tender. It's important to keep stirring the rice as it cooks. The whole process will take about 20 minutes. Once it is done, turn off the heat and stir in the cheddar cheese, chicken and broccoli. Let it all meld together and warm through. Season everything with an extra sprinkle of salt and pepper and give it a final stir. Scoop it into pretty bowls and serve immediately! Enjoy!"

They should fit fairly close together. Roast, uncovered, until browned, about 35-40 minutes. Meanwhile, heat the two broths together and keep warm. The salt in the broths is important for seasoning the meat as in braises. Bring to a boil just before proceeding to the next step.",
      "Take the skillet from the oven; reduce oven temperature to 325 degrees. Turn shanks over, add all the boiling broth, the onion, carrot, bay leaves and lemon. Cover tightly with the skillet's lid (or aluminum foil). Return pan to the oven and braise for 2 hours. Uncover and check to see if meat is tender enough to pull apart easily. (If not, recover and continue to braise.) Remove from the oven and let the shanks rest covered for an hour. Wipe out the skillet and keep handy for finishing the stew.",
      "With tongs, transfer shanks to a platter that will hold them in a single layer. Tent with foil. Pour the cooking liquid through a fine mesh strainer, pressing on the solids to extract all juices. The liquid should be just slightly warm at this point. Put liquid into a quart measuring cup then add some ice cubes. The fat will congeal fairly quickly around the cubes. (You can place cup in the freezer to hurry this along.) Discard the fat and ice. You'll have about 2 1/2 -3 cups of stock. Reserve.",

Trim root and tops from turnips, leaving 1/2\" of the greens; wash and cut into halves or quarters. (Don't be tempted to substitute mature turnips; use another vegie like new potatoes.) Trim root and tops from radishes, leaving 1/2\" of the greens; rinse very well, these can be sandy, and cut into halves or quarters.",
      "Blanch the root vegetables in the boiling salted water about 5 minutes. Remove to a colander but don't shock or rinse. Add the edamame to the water and blanch about 3 minutes, then turn them out to the colander as well. Add the peas and blanch 1 minute and add them to the colander.",

Add the scallions and cook, stirring frequently, about 2 minutes. Add 1/2 cup of the lamb stock, then all the blanched vegetables, the 2 TB. chopped parsley, and 3 TB. of the chopped dill. Reduce heat to low, partially cover, and simmer the vegies 5 minutes or just until tender, adding a little more lamb stock so they braise.",

Add the remaining 1 TB. butter in small pieces, the lemon juice and 3 more TB. chopped dill. Gently stir these seasonings throughout the stew. Taste for salt; we didn't need more.

Once the dough is chilled, spread the mixture in the center of the dough, leaving about 1 inch on every side. Fold the dough toward the center, pressing firmly to seal. Sprinkle a light coating of granulated sugar over the crust and press down gently. Bake for 20 minutes, reduce the heat to 350*, then bake for another 30-35 minutes, until the filling is bubbling and the crust is golden brown. Cool completely and serve room temperature."

    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "Note: Many of the steps should be done concurrently. While the oven is heating, peel and devein the shrimp, and start the chicken stock heating. While the stock is infusing and the tomatoes are roasting: pick through and rinse the lentils, mince the shallot, and chop the parsley. While the lentils are cooking finish the vinaigrette. The whole dish can be finished in not much more than an hour, so is feasible for a week night meal, and fantastic enough for a celebratory supper.",
      "For the vinaigrette: Heat oven to 400\u00b0 F. Core tomatoes, then cut in half lengthwise. Remove the seeds. Place the tomato halves cut side down on a parchment lined baking sheet, and smash them so they are fairly flat. The skin will split in several places, use a paring knife to help it if needed. Brush tomatoes with olive oil. Bake until skin is spotted brown, about 25 to 30 minutes. Allow to cool 10 to 15 minutes, or until easily handled.",
      "Peel the skin from the tomatoes. Transfer the tomatoes to food processor. Add 2 tablespoons vinegar, shallot, salt, cumin, paprika, and black pepper. Process until homogenous. While processing, slowly drizzle in the olive oil. Taste and add additional salt, pepper, or vinegar. Add the parsley, and pulse several times to combine. The parsley should essentially be minced, not fully incorporated.",
      "For the shrimp and lentils: Peel and devein shrimp, saving the shells. Toss the shrimp with kosher salt, black pepper, and sugar. Cover and refrigerate.",
      "Combine the shells with the chicken stock and bay leaf in a 2 to 3 quart saucepan. Bring to a simmer over high heat, then reduce heat to maintain. After 15 to 20 minutes, strain the shells and bay leaf from the stock.",
      "Return the stock to the pan and add the lentils. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to a simmer. Cook until the lentils are tender, about 25 to 30 minutes. Drain the lentils, and return them to the pan. Stir in most of the vinaigrette, leaving some to drizzle over the final dish. Keep the pan covered over very low heat, stirring occasionally until ready to serve.",
      "Remove the shrimp from the refrigerator. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a 12-inch skillet over medium high heat until the oil is just starting to smoke. Add half of the shrimp in a single layer. Cook about 1 minute, the bottom third to half of the shrimp should be opaque. Remove the skillet from the heat, then flip the shrimp over. Allow the residual heat from the pan to cook the shrimp until all but the very center of the shrimp are opaque, about 30 more seconds. Transfer the shrimp to a plate, and repeat the process with the remaining olive oil and shrimp. Add the first set of shrimp back to the pan. Cover to allow the residual heat to fully cook the shrimp, about 1 to 2 minutes.",
      "While the shrimp are finishing up, thinly slice the avocado. Give the lentils a final stir. Plate the dish with the lentils on the bottom, topped with the shrimp and avocado, and drizzled with the remaining vinaigrette."

In small skillet, heat 2 tablespoons olive oil over medium-low heat. When oil is warm, add bread crumbs and stir to combine. After about 2-3 minutes, crumbs will turn golden and toasty.

(If it looks too dry, add some of the pasta cooking water, a tablespoon at a time, until consistency seems right.) Add grated cheese and three quarters of the flavored bread crumbs and continue to mix.",

Shower with a bit of fresh parsley. Drizzle on a little more olive oil, if desired. Serve with crusty fresh bread for dipping into the garlic and bacon flavored oil. A glass of dry white wine also goes well with this pasta. Mangiare!"

      "To poach: When a few bubbles break through the surface of the hot liquid, you are ready to poach the eggs. Gently slide the eggs into the broth and cook for 3 to 4 minutes (never let the water reach a full simmer or the eggs will shred). 3 minutes will give you a thickened, but runny yolk. If you prefer a firmer yolk, lift the egg up with a slotted spoon and gently jiggle it until it appears as firm as you'd like. (Since the cooking liquid is opaque, you won't be able to see the eggs. To find them, gently stir with your spoon until you feel slight resistance.)",
      "To assemble the soup: place one poached egg in each bowl, on top of the green onions and cilantro. Ladle broth over the top, dividing it evenly. Sprinkle with additional salt and cracked pepper, as needed. Serve immediately with a slice of bread, either plain or toasted, in the soup or beside it.",
      "IF PREPARING THE EGGS AHEAD: Poach the eggs in water, instead of the broth/milk mixture. When cooked to desired doneness (about 3 to 4 minutes), remove and place in ice water. Store in refrigerator until meal time. Right before serving, slip the poached eggs in the hot broth to reheat. Just for one minute. Then continue with step 4 above."

You might not want to spread it too close to the edges, as the pressure of your fingers on the sandwich might make the filling ooze out a bit. (But it's a pretty oozy sandwich, so don't fret.) Top with the other slice and cut in half, gently, with a sharp knife. You can also enjoy this open-faced; that's not the 7-Eleven way but it's still good. There will be leftover egg salad; set it aside, refrigerate, and use within a few days."

      "Begin by soaking the beans the night before. I do this in the pot I am going to cook them in. The next day, cover them with water by 2 inches and bring to a boil. Add the chopped onion, minced garlic and a drizzle of olive oil. Bring to a boil and let boil for 5 minutes. Then cover and reduce the heat to a simmer. Cook until tender, checking to make sure they remain completely covered by the water. When they are tender, add 1 teaspoon of kosher salt and let cook another 10 minutes. Turn off the heat and set aside until you are ready for them.",
      "Next (this is a soup that can simmer for a while, so just make this when it is convenient, at least an hour before dinner) heat a large Dutch oven with olive oil. When it is shimmering, add the chopped onion with a pinch of salt. Cook until golden, but not super browned. Add the potatoes and toss with the onions. Cover the potatoes by 2 inches of water with a good quality stock-I used the turkey stock I had in the freezer from the Thanksgiving turkey. Add more salt if using a homemade stock. Bring to a boil, and then cover, reducing the heat to maintain a brisk simmer. Cook until the potatoes are tender (if it is close to dinner, cook until quite tender, if the soup will be gently simmering for a while, cook until crisp tender). Add the spinach and mix it in.",
      "While the potatoes are cooking, heat a skillet with the 1/4-cup olive oil. Add the garlic-when the garlic starts sizzling, add the bread and cook until each side is golden. For the first few slices this took about 6 minutes, but as I went on, the sides cooked faster, so keep an eye on them. Also keep a close eye on the garlic-you want it golden brown but not burnt. As each item (garlic clove or bread) is ready, remove it to the food processor. When all of the bread and garlic has been fried, add the spices, vinegar and hard boiled egg yolks to the food processor as well. Puree until smooth, adding either the cooking water from the potatoes or the beans as needed to thin it out.",
      "At this point, when everything is ready-the beans, the potatoes and the bread puree-add the beans with their cooking water and the puree to the potatoes. Stir and bring to a boil, and then reduce to a simmer, stirring, to help dissolve the bread puree into the soup. This soup should be quite thick, more of a stew, but if you want it thinner add more stock. Right before serving, mix in the chopped hard boiled egg whites. Some of us liked the soup with a drizzle more of vinegar and a sprinkle of the smoked paprika."

    "title": "golden apricot jam",
    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "Before you begin canning, it's important that you first get properly set up. You will need to put your canning jars in the dishwasher and run it on the hottest setting with no soap. The purpose of this is to sterilize them, and so that you have hot jars to ladle your hot jam into to prevent cracking. If you don't have a dishwasher, you can always boil the jars in water on the stove-top. You will also need to fill a hot water bath (or large pot) 3/4 full with water and turn the heat to medium-high. This will be the water that you process your jam in at the end, so if you turn the heat on now, it will be ready for you at the end of the process. The heat from the boiling water will kill bacteria and other little nasties and it will seal the lids. Finally, heat some water in a tiny saucepan for sterilizing your lids and rings. You will also need a ladle, a funnel, a magnetic lid grabber and a jar grabber.",
      "While your jars are sterilizing and your water bath is heating it's time to start jamming. Peel, pit and coarsely chop 4 C of apricots. This is about 2 heaping quarts or 3 wimpy quarts of fresh fruit. I like to use apricots that are very ripe. You'll know they're perfect if you're able to pit and break them apart with your fingers after peeling them.",
      "Place your apricots in a medium saucepan and smash them well using a potato smasher.",
      "Add 6 C of organic cane sugar and 1/4 C of fresh lemon juice to the saucepan and stir until combined.",
      "Begin heating the jam on a medium-high burner with a candy thermometer clipped to the side of your pot. Continue to heat while continuously slowly stirring the jam and while scraping the bottom of the pot with a wooden spoon to keep it from burning.",
      "Continue heating until gelling point is reached, which is 220\u00b0 F at most elevations. If you live at a high elevation plan on 228\u00b0F. If you're having trouble getting up to 220\u00b0F you may need to turn your burner up to high heat. Your need to do this will largely depend on your stove.",
      "After reaching gelling point, remove the jam from the heat and allow it to cool until it stops bubbling, so that it's safer to handle. At this point you're ready to fill your jars and can or \"process\" them using the water bath method, so that they are shelf stable.",
      "Before ladling the jam into your jars, dip your ladle and funnel into your boiling water for approximately 1 minute to ensure they are sterile. Next, ladle the jam into the warm, sterilized canning jars that you pulled out of your dishwasher. Be sure not to touch the insides of the jars and resist the temptation to lick your fingers throughout the process (this part will be difficult). This will ensure that you maintain a sterile environment within the jars by the time you're done.",
      "Next, clean the rims of your jars with a paper towel that you dipped into boiling water. If there is jam on the rims of the jars when you place the lid on top, it can compromise the integrity of the seal.",
      "Now you're ready to sterilize your lids in the small saucepan of hot water. You'll want to be careful not to boil the lids, as this can damage the seals, so bring the water to a boil first, remove from the heat, and then place the lids inside. Wait 5 minutes before using, so that the heat has time to work it's bacteria-killing magic. Next, remove the lids with the magnetic lid grabber, being sure not to touch the bottoms of the lids, and place them on the jars.",
      "Finally, place the rings on your jars. Now comes the tricky part - you will screw the ring on until it is just tight, and then go back the other direction about one-eighth of an inch, or a couple of millimeters, loosening the ring a bit. This is very important - don't skip this step! This will allow some air to escape the jars while you're boiling them, and then create a vacuum as they cool, sealing the jars.",
      "Place the jars into the boiling hot water bath (or large pot) using your jar grabber. Bring the water to a full boil, place the lid on the pot, and set your timer for 15 minutes.",
      "After the jars have boiled (or have been \"processed\") for 15 minutes, remove them from the pot using your grabber again and place them upright on some dish towels to cool. Soon after the jars are removed from the pot, you should start hearing popping sounds as the jars seal. You will need to let them rest for 24 hours, so pick a place where they won't be in the way, and won't be a temptation for little hands or curious pets."

If you're using fresh green beans, wash them and let them sit in a bowl with a tiny bit of water in them. Make sure they're not dried completely. If you haven't already cut up your ham, do so now. Fresh ham is probably more proper but I used the Applegate Farms Organic Black Forest Ham you can buy at the market sliced up. I took two slices and cut them into small squares.",
      "Throw your butter in a frying pan over a medium heat (the whole recipe should be cooked over a medium heat). Add the minced garlic to the butter once it starts melting down. Add you ham and stir it around for 1-2 minutes letting it brown slightly. It will pick up some of the garlic butter flavor.",
      "Toss in your two handfuls of green beans so they infuse in the garlic, butter, and ham. The water should begin to cook down immediately. If the beans are frozen, stir them around for at least 2-3 minutes before adding other ingredients to allow them to thaw out completely. You'll notice their color will quickly become a brighter green. If not frozen, be sure to let everything infuse for a few moments.",

      "Pour your hot water in to the flour and egg mixture, all at once. Immediately start stirring. It won't look like it is coming together, but keep stirring it. Don't beat the crap out of it, but stir for a minute or two and it will come together into a somewhat lumpy, ugly dough. Cover with a damp tea towel or loosely cover with plastic wrap. Let it rest for at least 15 minutes, if not 30.",
      "While your dough is resting you can get your fillings together. Purists will insist upon mashed potatoes, perhaps with some cottage cheese or maybe cheddar. Some of us love a good sauerkraut filling (the only ones I would eat as a kid). The classic filling in this house is cheesy mashed potatoes with a crumble of bacon smack in the middle. Don't mix it in with the potatoes because the sharp bits of bacon will pierce the dough. Regardless of your filling choice, make sure it is cool or cold, not hot. You can also make dessert pyrohy with saskatoon berries, with blueberries and ricotta, or even pears and mascarpone.",
      "To make the pyrohy cut a good hunk from the resting dough, recovering the remainder. Then roll it out into a log, like we do with playdough. Make it about an inch around. Then cut off 1/2 inch chunks. Take those chunks and roll them into balls. You will have about 1 inch balls.",
      "Roll those balls flat with a rolling pin. Not too flat or your dumpling won't stay together. Not too thick or you will have very thick pyrohy and the dough may not cook all the way through. I would say it's about 1/8 to 3/16 of an inch.",
      "Take a heaping teaspoonful of your filling and place it in the middle of your dough. Again, not too much, not too little. After you've made a few you will be able to eyeball the perfect ratio for you. Fold the dough over one side to create a semi-circle.",
      "Pinch the sides together. This is where personal style takes over. My mom, for example, does a solid pinch all the way around, once. I do a soft pinch for an initial seal, then a firmer crimp. It doesn't matter how as long as it is sealed and preferably without a big flange of thin dough.",
      "The best way to store pyrohy is frozen. You need to freeze them individually first. I lay out tea towels, sprinkle them generously with flour, and place the pyrohy on them as I finish each one. Freeze, then store in plastic bags, containers, or even ice cream pails in the freezer until ready to use. Just remember to label them if you made more than one kind!",
      "Whether you cook them fresh or frozen., the technique is the same. Bring a large pot of water to a full boil. Toss in your pyrohy, not crowding them too much. Keep at a boil and stir gently every now and then. The pyrohy are finished when they float at the top. If they are frozen and particularly thick you might poke them gently to make sure the filling is soft. Drain.\r\n\r\nYou can eat them straight this way, generally served with fried onions and sour cream. A lot of people fry them with the onions to crisp up the outsides. Growing up we ate them boiled for dinner and the leftovers were fried for breakfast the next day."

      "NOTES:\r\n - You can, of course, use regular cow milk's ricotta and milk, and use Parmesan as your grated cheese. I like goat milk products because they're very easily digested.\r\n - Change the vegetables according to season. For spring, try a mix of peas, asparagus and artichoke; for winter try Radicchio and cruciferous veggies, and for summer try eggplant, peppers and tomatoes. The possibilities are endless!\r\n - Add seeds to increase the nutritional value: Flax, Chia, sunflower...every seed would be great on these."

(Tip: I add oil to the eggplant before putting it in the pan to make sure all the pieces get coated before hitting the hot pan.) Let the eggplant cook covered, for 10-15 minutes, tossing frequently.
