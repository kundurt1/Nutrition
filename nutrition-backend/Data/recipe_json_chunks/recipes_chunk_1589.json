Keep in mind you want things to get nice and browned so you don't want to stir it up too much (this is not a saute). The amount of salt may seem like a lot, but the potatoes need salt and it's a great combination with the sweetness of the squash.",

My friend Beth, who gave me the idea for this recipe, roasted potatoes, butternut, onion and parsnip in the oven, drizzled with a little olive oil and seasoned similarly. Then she went and moved to Korea, and left me to my own devices. This is what I came up with."

I had a little trouble with runniness in the frosting so here is what I did, in case you have the same problem: Add some powdered sugar (a little at a time, I added 2 1/3 cup total), switch to the whisk attachment on your mixer and whip! If still a bit runny, pop bowl in the freezer for a good 15 minutes-give a few stirs when you remove from freezer (and maybe one or two during the chilling process)."

Take them out and let them cool for 5 minutes or so before transferring them to racks to finish cooling.",

To prepare the pans put Baker's Joy, flour and grease, or a comparable mixture in the bottom and around the edges. I make my own Baker's Joy: I use a paste made from 1/2 cup oil, 1/2 cup shortening, and 1-1 1/2 cups flour, which keeps very well in the fridge. Grease the pan, place a parchment circle in the bottom, and grease the parchment. (If making cupcakes, use cupcake papers and no grease.) This 'greasing and pan-prep process' is especially important with dark pans or pans larger than 10 inches around. If using pans larger than 10 inches, I recommend that you use a heating core or flower nail in centre of pan to conduct heat to the center of the cake (allowing the middle to bake before the edges burn).",

      "The original recipe called for taking the skins off the tomatoes before roasting and chopping. This is usually too much preparation for me, so I just slide them right off at the end. But if you want to do it like Patricia, make an X on the tomatoes with a sharp knife, dunk them in scalding water, and then peel off the skins before you begin. Either way, the results are amazing.",
      "Directions:",
      "Preheat the oven to 175 degrees F.",
      "1. Cut tomatoes into quarters and arrange side-by-side on a baking sheet. Drizzle extra virgin olive oil over the tomatoes and toss with your hands until all sides are coated. Sprinkle each side with salt, then scatter the thyme leaves over the tomatoes. (Make sure to remove the leaves from the sprigs!)",
      "2. Cook in the oven until the tomatoes are very soft, about one hour. After an hour, shake the pan and make sure that the tomatoes are roasting on all sides. Stir them on the pan so that they remain coated in juice. Let them roast for another hour, until they're about half their original size. Remove from the oven and allow to cool thoroughly.",
      "3. Transfer the tomatoes to a jar, cover with the cooking juices and oil, then cover securely and refrigerate for up to 1 week.",
      "(I dont think I ever peeled the tomatoes, or cored them. Ha! I did quarter them. But as I remember, the skins come off pretty easily. The most important thing is to cut them, or else they don't make as much juice, if I remember correctly. If you do want to peel them, which maybe I did do, make an X with a sharp knife, dunk them in scalding water, and then the skins should come right off!)"

I would recommend putting the coke on to simmer before you start to measure the other ingredients, that way you have time for it to reduce and cool before you want to use it. (I would also recommend you use the other half of the can of coke and make a JD and coke to drink while you make these, I always find baking is thirsty work - but that might just be me...)",
      "You want the coke to reduce in volume by around half, to make a coca-cola syrup which you will use to flavor your cupcakes. Keep and eye on it, stir it every once in a while to stop it from forming caramel on the sides of the pan, but you don't need to be too precise about reducing it.",
      "While the coke is simmering down, measure out your ingredients.",
      "Begin by whisking the two egg whites, pinch of salt and 1/4 teaspoon of cream of tartar, until they reach a soft peak stage. Check on the coke - it should be about done. Once it looks like it's reduced to about half the volume, take it off the heat and leave to cool.",
      "Back to the egg whites - now sift in the icing/confectioners sugar, and whisk to the stiff peak stage. You want to be able to lift the beater out and have a firm little mountain of egg-whites stand up. Then, sift in half of the flour, and use a silicone spatula or metal spoon to fold in the flour. All of the air in these cupcakes comes from what you whip into the eggs, so you don't want to knock too much of it out now! Once the first half of the flour is folded in, do the same with the second half of the flour.",
      "By now, your reduced coca-cola should be nicely syrupy and cool. Add two tablespoons of the coke syrup into the cake mix, and gently fold in with the spatula or spoon. If you have leftover syrup, put it in a small container in the fridge - you will probably make a second batch of these cakes very soon!",
      "Put paper liners in a 12-cup muffin/cupcake tin. As this batter is quite soft and runny, I like to gently pour/scrape the batter into a measuring jug and then carefully pour it into each cupcake liner, until they are around 2/3 of the way full - but using all the batter and trying to make sure they are sort-of even. Or to avoid the extra washing-up, you can just glop it in with a spoon - one heaping tablespoon per cupcake liner is usually about right, but use all of the mix. The mix will be very puffy and almost marshmallow-ey - but it doesn't rise a great deal during baking, so do not worry about over-filling the liners. (They are boozy cupcakes, so no-one will be all that concerned with how far up the cupcake liner they go, trust me! )",
      "Put the cupcakes in to bake for 15-20 minutes, at 325F, middle shelf. Check on them at 15 minutes - you want them to be golden and slightly springy - press gently on the top and see if it feels like the inside is still wet. If it feels squishy, give it a few more minutes, if it feels springy then they're done.",
      "Move the cakes to a wire rack to cool.",
      "While the cakes cool, it's time to make the frosting.",
      "Put the cream cheese and syrup (the syrup makes the frosting nice and glossy) in a large bowl, or the bowl of a stand mixer. Whisk on a medium speed to combine. Sift in 1 cup of the icing sugar, and pour in half of the whiskey, and whisk again. Taste, and then add more sugar and whiskey to taste - I use one and a half or up to two cups of icing sugar - sometimes my cream cheese just seems to be a little wet!",
      "Once the cupcakes are cool, you can either pipe the frosting on, or just spoon it onto the cupcakes and smooth it out with knife dipped in warm water.",
      "Put the frosted cupcakes in the fridge for the frosting to set for 30 minutes. Then eat!",
      "You will have frosting left over. I have tried to make a smaller quantity, but it's tricky to get the flavor ratio right and the whisking done properly with smaller amounts. You can, of course, double the cupcake recipe to make 24 instead of 12, but the cupcakes are best eaten within 2-3 days, and the frosting keeps well in a sealed container in the fridge for about 4 days, and if I don't make a second batch of cupcakes soon then I usually use it to frost a carrot-cake.",
      "To make a child-friendly version, I switch JD for vanilla in the frosting - but just a teaspoon, so you will need less sugar; or use a dash of cherry essence and a little (a tablespoon) of cherry Kool Aid powder to make cherry-coke cupcakes."

      "First you want to bake the chicken. Trust me on this. When you bake the chicken first and then add it to the chili it keeps it moist and flavorful, not stringy. Preheat the oven to 375 F. Place the chicken breasts in a baking dish and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Drizzle a dash of olive oil on them if you want, then bake for about 35 minutes until just done. Let them cool slightly then shred with a fork. Set aside.",
      "For the chili, heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a large soup pot over medium heat. While the oil is heating put the onion, carrot, celery, pepper and jalapenos in a food processor and process until they form a kind of paste. Add the vegetables to the oil and season with a dash of salt. Cook, stirring constantly, until they reach a deep golden brown. Add the garlic and tomato paste and cook, stirring constantly, until the entire mixture reaches a deep red color. Y'all, you really want to do this! Once the deep brown has been reached, stir in the chili powder, paprika and cayenne. Slowly add the chicken stock, scraping the bottom of the pot to release all of the brown bits. Let the mixture simmer until the liquid has reduced by half, then add about 3 cups of water. Stir to combine, check for seasonings and adjust as desired, and then step away from the pot. Let this simmer until about 2/3 of the water evaporates. The chili should be thick and rich now. Add the shredded chicken, beans, and corn (if using) and let them all heat through with the chili. Once everything is hot, remove from the heat and serve with whatever you want. Honestly I thought it was so good I just ate it as-is and loved it!"

If you do find a tasty trick to tweak please let me know. I love suggestions! Thanks for visiting my corner of TK!",
      "The How To's:",
      "1. Cooking the chicken can certainly be done ahead of time. However, with my easy poaching method it is a cinch to cook while you get the soup started.",
      "2. Turn oven to 375 degrees. Spray pan with non stick spray or oil.",
      "3.Place chicken in pan, salt and pepper the chicken and fill pan with approximately 1/4 inch water.",
      "3. Cover tightly with foil and bake for 20 minutes. When done let cool for a few minutes before cubing. This helps keep the yummy juices in and saves your fingers from burning. Yikes!",
      "Onto the soup, which as mentioned can be started while the chicken is in the oven:",
      "4. Heat oil in a large stock pot. Add onion, carrots, celery and garlic and saute until tender - 6 or 7 minutes.",
      "5. Add tomatoes with juices. After a few minutes add the lentils, chicken, vegetable broth, coriander, cumin and grains of paradise (or pepper if you are going down that road).",
      "6. Bring to a boil, turn down to a simmer and cover for about 30 minutes. If you're in a hurry because church starts in less than 45 minutes, keep it on medium heat. After about 20 minutes, convince yourself the lentils are \"done enough\" and add the pasta. Cook for another 6-7 minutes and call it done.",
      "5. Ladle into bowls and top with freshly shredded Parmesan and a drizzle of olive oil. Very nice with some crusty bread and dressed field greens.",
      "6. Enjoy with all your favorite loved ones and in our case our little white pup under the table!",

      "First, prepare the dough. Whisk the flour, cinnamon and salt together in a large mixing bowl to aerate them. Then use a pastry cutter to cut the butter into the ingredients until it is all pebbly. Lastly, pour the ice cold water in and stir it all together just until a dough forms. Do not overwork it. Bring the dough together into a ball, then cut it in half. Press each half out into a disc on a well floured surface, then wrap each half in plastic wrap. Let the dough discs rest in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.",
      "When the dough is done resting, pre-heat the oven to 425\u00b0F. Take the first disc of dough and roll it out to be a thin crust about 10 inches in diameter. Roll it around the rolling pin, then roll it back out into a 9-inch pie plate. Press it firmly into the pie plate and don't trim any excess edges. Add the strawberries, brown sugar, strawberry balsamic vinegar, cinnamon, salt, vanilla, and flour into the pie plate and gently stir it together a little. Dot the top with the butter.",
      "Roll out the second disc the same as the first one and lay it on top of the filling. Crimp the edges of the bottom crust and top crust together, then make the edge pretty by pressing it with the tines of a fork. Brush the top crust with the milk, then sprinkle it with the sugar to caramelize it. Cut a few vents in the center of the top crust so that it doesn't explode. Place the pie dish on a lined sheet tray to catch anything that bubbles over and bake the pie for 20 minutes. Then reduce the heat to 375\u00b0F and bake it for another 50-60 minutes, until the top is completely golden brown and the filling is set.",
      "Take the pie out and let it cool for an hour and half at least. Then slice it and serve with ice cream for an amazing summer treat!"

      "For the yeast dough:",
      "In a small bowl, dissolve the yeast in the milk. Add 3 tablespoons of the bread flour amount listed in the dough section. With a fork, mix until well blended. It must be smooth and not lumpy. Cover with a piece of plastic wrap and leave in a warm place until it doubles in size, approximately 30 minutes.",
      "For the dough:",
      "In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the hook attachment, mix together the remaining flour, sugar and salt on low speed until well mixed. Add the orange zest and mix. Gradually add the eggs, the orange blossom water and the yeast dough. Mix until the dough starts to come together.",
      "On low speed, slowly add the butter. Increase the speed to medium-high and beat for 15-20 minutes until the dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl. The dough should be smooth, homogeneous and when stretching, it should be translucent and should not break easily. If it breaks easily, you should beat it a bit longer.",
      "Lightly oil a large bowl. Turn the dough out of the mixing bowl, shape into a ball by tucking the edges of the dough underneath and then continue to tuck the edges underneath until the dough naturally gathers into a ball with a tight surface. Transfer the dough to the oiled bowl and sprinkle with flour. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a kitchen towel. Place the bowl in a warm place (I like to put it near the stove) for 1 to 1 1/2 hours.",
      "After this time the dough will rise and it will feel a little loose. Punch down the dough and again shape it into a ball by tucking the edges underneath. Transfer to the same oiled bowl, sprinkle with flour and cover with plastic wrap. Refrigerate overnight.",
      "Remove the dough from the refrigerator. Let it come to room temperature, which will take about 1 hour.",
      "Punch down the dough. Divide it into roughly 17 pieces of dough (50 grams/1.7 ounces each) that are about the size of a tennis ball. Reserve 3 of these balls, these will be the \"bones\" and the \"skulls\". Shape the remaining 14 pieces on a lightly floured surface into rounds and make sure the dough is compact. Place the dough rounds on two baking sheets and lightly flatten the tops with the palm of your hands. See related blog link for more photos of the assembled bread.",
      "With 1 of the reserved balls of dough, form 14 marble-size balls and set them on the baking sheet for later use. After making the marble-size balls, divide the remaining 2 sections of reserved dough into 28 pieces. Roll these 28 pieces with your hands making strips that are long enough to lay over the width of the big dough rounds. Place 2 strips on top of each bread round, overlapping in the center in a \"+\" pattern. Let the bread rise in a warm place until it doubles in size, about 1/2 hour.",
      "Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 160\u00b0C/320\u00b0F.",
      "Gently press the reserved dough balls on top of each loaf, where the strips meet. You can use a little of cold water as glue. Bake for 25- 30 minutes or until the dough has a golden color. Remove from the oven and add the topping (recipe below) while still warm.",
      "For the topping:",
      "Brush the melted butter over the rolls, being sure to brush all around the knobs. Sprinkle evenly with sugar all over the top."

Then it's ready by the time I have finished dinner, washed the dishes and decided I am ready for pudding.",

      "1. Preheat oven to 350 F. In a large mixing bowl, combine Greek yogurt, sugars and the egg. Beat until combined (you can use your stand mixer for this, although whisking it by hand works just as well).",
      "2. Add salt, flour and cocoa to the batter mixture and mix well.",
      "3. Stir apple cider vinegar and milk together in a measuring glass to make your own quick buttermilk. Add the baking soda to this mixture and stir until it begins to foam.",
      "4. Add buttermilk mixture a bit at a time into the cake mixture, mixing as you go to incorporate all of the liquid.",
      "5. Whisk in vanilla and mint extracts.",
      "6. Whisk in boiling water a little bit at a time so you don't splash/burn yourself.",
      "7. Fill two 12-count (recipe makes about 20) standard sized cupcake tins with paper liners and then fill the liners 2/3 of the way full with batter. Bake at 350 F for 15-19 minutes, until a toothpick inserted into the center of a cupcake comes out clean. Remove pan from the oven and move cupcakes to a wire rack and let them cool.",
      "For the ganache:",
      "1. Heat milk in a small saucepan over medium heat, whisking occasionally so it doesn't burn, until it comes to a simmer.",
      "2. Place chocolate chips in a large, heat-resistant bowl (glass or ceramic are good choices). Remove milk from heat and pour it over chocolate, then stir gently until chocolate has melted and you've formed a smooth ganache.",
      "3. Stir in the mint extract and set ganache aside. Let this cool while you make the frosting.",
      "For the frosting:",
      "1. In a medium bowl, melt the butter. I use the microwave-it's just easier. Just heat it for 30 seconds at a time and stop once melted.",
      "2. Stir cocoa and powdered sugar into melted butter.",
      "3. Stir boiling water into frosting a few tablespoons at a time, mixing well in between each addition. Continue until frosting has reached a thick, buttercream-like consistency. The frosting will set and harden very quickly, so be prepared to frost the cupcakes as soon as it's ready! You don't need sky-high frosting on each cupcake. It's super rich so use it in moderation!",
      "To assemble the cupcakes:",
      "1. Pipe frosting onto cupcakes (I use a Wilton #1M or a ziploc bag with a corner cut off). You could also spread the frosting on the cupcakes with a knife.",
      "2. Give the ganache a stir, then drizzle a spoonful of it over each cupcake once they're frosted. If you're feeling ambitious, you could also dig a little hole in each cupcake before you frost them and pour some ganache into the center, then frost and decorate normally. Me, I'm too lazy to do that 90% of the time. But it does taste good!",
      "3. Top the cupcakes with a thin mint cookie and some chocolate shavings or eat them as is!"

Loosen springform pan and gently remove the ring. Cover cheesecake with plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 6 hours or overnight.",
