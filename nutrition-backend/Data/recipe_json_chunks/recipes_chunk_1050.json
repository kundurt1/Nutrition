Two to look for are Bonny Doon Vineyard's strawberry-scented 2007 Vin Gris de Cigare or the crisp 2006 Terre Rouge Vin Gris d'Amador."

Spin the bowl counterclockwise if you're right-handed (or clockwise if left-handed) while working in the flour with the fork.",
      "Once the pasta forms large clumps, start kneading. When all of the loose flour has been incorporated and the dough has formed a rough but cohesive mass, about 4 minutes, transfer it to the board to finish kneading. (If loose flour remains and resists joining the dough mass, add 2-3 teaspoons water, toss with the loose flour, and incorporate into the dough mass.).",
      "(If using a pasta sheet rolling machine, knead until the dough is cohesive and moderately smooth, about 5 minutes.).",
      "(If NOT using a pasta sheet rolling machine, knead the bread for 10 minutes until smooth and elastic; check that dough has been kneaded long enough for hand-rolling by cutting it open: you should see small air bubbles inside and on the surface.).",
      "To check for the proper proportion of flour to liquid, press thumb into center of the ball of dough, it should come out clean. If too wet, sprinkle on some more flour (all-purpose flour is fine) and work inches If too dry, spray water with a mister and knead until the liquid has been absorbed.",
      "If making stuffed pasta, the dough should stick lightly to your fingers but pull away cleanly. For sheet pasta, add enough extra flour to make a firmer dough that releases easily from your fingers.",
      "If the dough is elastic and wants to spring back, separate dough into 6-8 balls, cover with a bowl or a damp cloth, or wrap in plastic, and allow it to rest at room temperature for about 30 minutes to relax the gluten before rolling. The dough will continue to absorb the flour as it rests.",
      "If the dough is sticky after resting, and you're rolling it by machine, you may wish to incorporate more flour by sprinkling the dough when you roll out the pasta to keep it from sticking.",
      "Roll the pasta to the desired thinness, following pasta machine's directions (start at 1 and progress to desired level). Aim for level 7 for fettuccine. If the dough breaks apart, is irregularly shaped, or sticks to the machine and makes holes, do not worry. Just fold up the sheet of dough into a regular shape that fits the widths of the pasta machine. Dust the new piece of dough with flour, and start rolling again.",
      "For wide paparadelle strips, roll pasta sheet into a roll, and slice with a knife. Otherwise, use pasta cutter of your choice.",
      "In hot, humid weather, place a table fan on low speed near the pasta drying rack. Turn the pasta sheets several times so they dry out evenly without developing any mold before forming into nests and drying fully. (Note if cooking pasta the same day, there is no need to dry out the pasta.) Once the pasta has been cut and formed into portion-size nests, arrange on a tray that has been covered with waxed paper or parchment paper and sprinkled with semolina or cornmeal, cover with plastic wrap and store refrigerated up to 3 days.",
      "For dry pasta, dry until dry on the surface with the texture of smooth cardboard but not brittle. The sheets are dried enough if the cut edges are whitish in color.",
      "To cook, heat generously salted water at highest setting so that water will return to a boil quickly after pasta is added. Cook until al dente, about 4 minutes for fresh pasta."

This seemed to be where they were coming in: the back wall behind where the counter meets the stove. (Apparently they take the oats back to the nest, the ants feast on them and then die because they can't eat foods that expand.). Place your oats or grits as close as possible to where you think they're coming in from. You don't want to attract them so they'll stay around! You want them to grab some food and take it back to the nest immediately.",

Apparently, ants don't like cinnamon and they won't cross a line of cinnamon. I have no idea why they won't, but I made sure to sprinkle an unbroken line (until I got to the oatmeal).",

      "Scald the milk. Add honey, oil, salt and cumin seed. Add orange juice (it will curdle) and cool to lukewarm.",
      "In mixer bowl combine yeast and warm water with sugar and let sit until bubbly.",
      "Add milk/juice mixture. Add 3 cups unbleached white flour in 1/2 cup increments and beat at medium speed for 2 minutes.",
      "Mix and rough sift the rye and whole wheat flour to remove coarse bran hulls (which are in homeground but probably not in store bought) and when the 2 minutes are up, add the combined rye and whole wheat flours in half cup increments (this method of adding the flour is important unless you want to make bricks). You are waiting for a shaggy mass that pulls away from sides of bowl.",
      "Resting: Now turn off the machine and clean up your mess. Oil the bowl for the first rising. Call your mother. Play with the cat. (It's hard to break stride at this point but it's a crucial step.) You want the flours to absorb maximum moisture. Run the machine a few seconds to evaluate the sticky factor and then change to the dough hook.",
      "Kneading: Machine knead for 8 minutes. Push and shove the dough into the hook, always keeping dough involved. Stay alert or you'll lose the paddle and your hand. Frequent finger sprinkles of unbleached white flour keep the stickiness in control. Don't leave the machine unattended since the dough may look smooth and elastic and grasp the hook naturally and in another second it turns viciously sticky and avoids the hook.",
      "Turn dough out to a lightly floured counter space. Hand knead until you are satisfied with the dough.",
      "First rise: Lightly oil a bowl, turn the dough in it and cover with plastic wrap. Allow the dough to rise until it is at least doubled.",
      "Prepare for baking: Place a baking stone (or clay tiles that can be used for bread baking) in your oven. Turn on oven to 400.",
      "Shape the loaf: Turn out to a floured counter top and knead out any air bubbles. Then form the loaf into a football shape. (Beginning bread bakers should consult a good article or book to learn how to shape free-form loaves, or get an experienced bread-baking friend to show you how.).",
      "Second rise: Set up the bread's \"home\" for the second rise. You can use parchment paper on a peel (huge wooden paddle) but an inverted cookie sheet will do. Sprinkle parchment paper with cornmeal. Gently place dough in the center and cover with a terrycloth towel. (Don't worry about weight of towel -- yeast is mighty strong at this point.) Leave loaf until it is nearly double (about 25 minutes or more). UNDER rising is better since, if it rises too high, it will not oven spring and it may even collapse. Over-rising on first rise can be a blessing. On second rise, too high is a disaster.",
      "Slashing the loaf: Before putting in oven, with a single edge razor blade, make three long slashes. Don't do a direct north/south (ceiling to floor) slash but rather keep the blade almost parallel to the floor. This way the slashed dough will fold out and be even rather than form gullies.",
      "Baking: With a minimum of vibration, carefully slide the dough AND the paper into the oven.",
      "After 15 minutes it will be possible to gently pull the paper out (it will start to brown) and change position of the loaf which should have sprung in the oven. Be gentle, the crust is extremely fragile at this stage and if you break it, the steam will escape and it won't cook chewy.",
      "Turn the heat down to 350 and let it bake another 40 minutes or so. Occasionally change the loaf's position because of oven hot spots. After 40 minutes lift loaf and tap bottom. If it sounds hollow it is done. If you have any doubt, return to oven another 5 minutes or so.",
      "Remove to a wire rack (a spare cold oven rack will do). Let cool."

      "* NOTES * You can use 1-2 inches of ginger, depending how much you like ginger. If you don't like big pieces of ginger, you can grate or microplane it. * I listed 1 jalapeno because that's easy to get, and gives a mild hotness. If you prefer, use 2-3 Thai bird chiles; you can leave them whole, or deseed and chop finely. If you leave them whole, get green ones so people can see them! * Bagoong is a Filipino shrimp paste, that comes in jars. Buy \"bagoong guisado\", regular, not hot. Use 1-2 Tbsp, according to taste. If you can't find bagoong, use fish sauce, or even a shrimp bouillon cube. * I use regular coconut milk. I don't know if light might separate. * Be sure to get the green jackfruit in brine, not the ripe jackfruit in syrup. The green jackfruit cans I bought were 20 oz undrained, 10 oz drained. You can eat everything in the can. I cut into smaller pieces. * I used peeled and deveined shrimp, size 25-30#. * Instead of shrimp you can use pork. Use 1/2 lb, cut into small pieces, and add after the onions. * Season gently with salt and pepper -- the bagoong is salty and the chile will add spiciness. *."
