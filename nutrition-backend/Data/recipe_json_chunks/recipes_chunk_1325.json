This will result in a mealy pie crust, which is less likely to become soggy as the pie bakes. For pies to be filled with fruit or another nonliquid filling, leave some bits of fat in larger pieces, about the size of a small pea, for a crisp and flaky texture in the baked crust.)",

Unfold or unroll and ease the dough into the pan without stretching, making sure that the pan sides and the rim are evenly covered. Press the dough gently against the sides and bottom. Trim the overhang to 1 inch. Tuck the dough overhang under itself and flute the edges. Fill and bake the pie according to recipe directions.",
      "Pie doughs may be soft and difficult to roll either because they are too warm, a little too much water has been added to the dough, or the weather is humid. Using marble pastry boards and rolling pins, which stay cooler than the surrounding air, helps to keep pastry dough cool and easy to handle. Another trick to working with pie dough is to roll out the dough between two pieces of parchment or waxed paper. This technique can be a big help to the novice baker."

Without the insulin required (through production in the pancreas by nondiabetics or injection by diabetics) to metabolize high-carbohydrate foods, your body will burn off dietary fat, not store it.

      "1. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the hook attachment (or in a small bowl with a spoon), combine the warm water, yeast, and oil. With the mixer on low, stir the mixture to dissolve the yeast. Add the flour and salt, and continue to stir on low just until the ingredients are combined, then increase the mixer speed to medium and knead the dough until it's smooth and elastic, 5 to 6 minutes. (Alternatively, turn the flour and salt onto a work surface and create a well in the center. Pour the liquid mixture into the middle of the well and use your fingertips to drag the flour into the wet ingredients, then mix them until a soft, ragged dough forms. Gather the dough into a ball and knead until soft but elastic, about 10 minutes. Dust the dough, your hands, and the work surface with additional flour as needed to keep the dough from sticking, but use as little flour as possible.)",
      "2. Gather the dough into a ball and transfer it to a clean bowl that's large enough to hold the dough after it doubles in volume. Dust the surface of the dough with flour, cover tightly with plastic wrap, and let the dough rise at room temperature until it doubles in volume, about 1 hour.",
      "3. While the dough is rising, drain the sliced mozzarella on several paper towels to remove any excess moisture.",
      "4. Position an oven rack in the bottom third of the oven, placing a pizza stone on the rack if available. If a pizza stone is unavailable, brush a pizza pan lightly with olive oil. Preheat the oven to 450\u00b0F.",
      "5. Transfer the dough to a floured work surface. Gently press it into a rough square then pull the four corners in toward the center and flip the dough over so the upper surface is smooth. Drape the ball of dough with the plastic you used during the first rise, and let it rest until it's relaxed, about 30 minutes.",
      "6. Uncover the dough then spread and stretch it into a circle about the same dimensions as your stone or prepared pan. Carefully lift and transfer the dough to a pizza peel (if using a stone) or the pan and stretch it out into an even layer. Spread the crushed tomatoes over the pizza in an even layer and top with the mozzarella slices.",
      "7. If using a pizza stone, use the peel to slide the pizza onto the oven rack positioned in the lower third of the oven; if using a pizza pan, simply place the pan directly on the rack. Bake the pizza until the edges are golden and the cheese is bubbling, 8 to 10 minutes. Sprinkle with the torn basil and oregano, and season with salt and pepper if desired. Cut into wedges and serve."

      "When the bacon is finished and draining, add a little olive oil to the bacon drippings in the same skillet and set over medium-high heat. Working in batches, cook the beef until browned, adding more oil to the pan as needed. As each batch is finished browning, remove it to the stoneware liner of a crock pot and set aside. When the beef is finished, add a little more oil to the same skillet. Add the chopped onions, carrots, celery and garlic to the pan, and saute lightly until the vegetables have softened a bit, about 5 minutes. When vegetables are finished cooking, add them to the beef in the crock pot. Then, add the wine, broth, tomatoes, thyme, sage and reserved fried bacon, and stir thoroughly to combine. DO AHEAD: This can all be done the night before. Refrigerate the covered crock overnight, and cook it the next day if desired. I think this actually helps develop the flavors even better!",
      "Set the crock pot on the low setting, and cook the beef mixture for 7 hours. After 7 hours, add the cubed parsnips and potatoes to the crock pot; stir thoroughly. Continue cooking on low setting for an additional 2 1/2 hours. Taste and adjust seasoning.",
      "Near the end of cooking time, start preparing the crusts. This is the (sort-of) tricky part that can be likened to filling a square hole with a round peg. If you are a pastry purist, you can make and roll out your own pie crust to fit your baking dishes to order, but I am lazy and I like to save time by using the pre-made pastry you can find in the supermarket. So if you're adventurous,you can skip the following and do your own thing with your own favorite crust.",
      "Take out two 9x13 inch rectangular ceramic baking dishes and set them on the counter. (Oblong metal cake pans or oval shaped bakers would probably work just as well - whatever you have is OK) Remove two of the pie crust sheets from the package and lay them side by side, overlapping in the middle. What you ultimately want to do is line your baking dish with a bottom crust, having some pastry overhang on each short end. Make your best estimate how much you will need to overlap the two round crusts in the middle to achieve this. Trim each sheet so you have only about an inch or so overlap remaining between them. (I use kitchen shears for this. Easier than a knife) Save the scraps. You'll need them in a minute. Press the middle seam together with your fingers to make one large pastry sheet. Carefully fold the large pastry sheet in thirds, and lift it gently into one of the waiting baking dishes. Unfold the pastry and line the pan as you would if you were baking a pie. The long sides will probably not have any overhang. Use the reserved scraps to patch an overhang on the side edges, pressing the pieces together with your fingers. Fill the lined baking dish with half of the beef mixture from the crock pot. Then piece together two more pastry sheets in a similar manner to make atop crust, trimming as needed. Fold the edges of the top crust under the edges of the bottom crust, and crimp to seal. Repeat the same process for the second baking dish. It sounds complicated but it's not. Just make your best guess to make the best fit. It will taste delicious regardless.",
      "Brush the top of each pie with the beaten egg wash (it will make your crust pretty and shiny after baking), and cut a few steam vents in the top with a sharp knife. Bake the pies in a preheated 400 degree oven for about 45 minutes, or until the crust is a nice golden brown. Let stand for 10minutes before serving. Enjoy!"

For nonbaking recipes, we use Splenda Granular (boxed, not in a packet). For baking, we use Splenda Sugar Blend for Baking, a mix of sugar and sucralose. It can be substituted in recipes (1/2 cup of the blend for each 1 cup of sugar) to reduce sugar calories by half while maintaining some of the baking properties of sugar. If you make a similar blend with half sugar and half Splenda Granular, substitute this homemade mixture cup for cup."

      "Start pasta cooking at a rolling boil (do not forget to graciously salt the water and make sure and wait until the water is boiling before adding the pasta). In a large fry pan drop your chicken on medium to high heat. If you're using raw chicken, cut it up fine then cook it until it's done using a little olive oil to help it along. If you're using already cooked chicken cut it into cubes. With cooked chicken in the pan at medium high heat, add the 1/2 stick of butter and finally minced garlic (I got myself a garlic press this year, go buy one, it's worth it). Cook until the garlic and chicken begin to brown, reduce heat to medium or lower. Add all of the spices. Add the sliced peppers; cook until you like them done. I like them practically raw, I love that sweet crunch, but it's up to you. De-glaze the pan with milk here as you go so nothing gets truly brown or begins to stick. Mix a spoonful of cornstarch with a cup of cold milk, add to the pan and stir until it's thick. Add more milk slowly until it reaches your desired consistency. Remember, your sauce must first come to a boil before you know how thick it is actually going to be (so just go slow). I always take the pasta out of the water just before its \"too done\" (not with a bite to it, but not mushy either) and I cook the pasta and sauce together for a few minutes before serving. I usually leave this sauce rather wet so it would be a sin to not serve this with Garlic Bread for sopping."

Set a flat roasting rack over them and lay the chicken on the rack, breast side up. (If you don't have a flat roasting rack, place the chicken directly on the baking sheet with the backbone and giblets around the edges.) Roast. If the drippings seem to be getting too dark or start to scorch during roasting, pour about 1/2 cup of water into the pan. Continue roasting until the skin is crisp and well browned in spots, the juices run almost clear when you prick the breast, and an instant-read thermometer inserted in the thigh (without touching bone) registers 170 degrees, about 50 minutes. Transfer the chicken to a cutting board (preferably one with a trough to collect juices) to rest for 10 to 20 minutes.

If they still won't come up, heat the roasting pan over medium heat to dissolve the drippings.) Bring the juices in the saucepan to a boil, whisking. Taste the sauce; if it tastes a little flat, add a few drops of lemon juice and season to taste with salt and pepper.

Divide in half; form each half into a ball. Cover and set aside. Remove casing from sausage, if present. In a large skillet, cook sausage, ground beef, onion, mushrooms, and garlic until meat is brown and onion is tender. Drain well. Stir in tomato sauce, Parmesan cheese, and Italian seasoning. Cook and stir until heated through. Cover and keep warm. On a lightly floured surface, roll half of the pastry into a 13-inch circle. Place pastry in a 9-inch springform pan so dough extends about 2 inches up the sides. Sprinkle bottom with half of the mozarella cheese. Spoon meat mixture over cheese. Pat spinach dry with paper towels. Combine spinach, roasted sweet peppers, whole egg, and remaining mozarella cheese. Spread mixture over meat mixture. Roll remaining pastry into a 10-inch circle; cut into 3/4-inch-wide strips. Twist strips and place on spinach mixture to form a lattice. Fold edge of bottom pastry over lattice ends; crimp to seal. Brush pastry with mixture of egg yolk and water; sprinkle with sesame seed. Bake in a 375 degree F oven for 45 minutes or until golden brown. Cool 10 minutes on a wire rack. To transport, cover with foil and place in an insulated container. To serve, remove sides of springform pan; cut tart into wedges. Serve within 3 hours. Makes 10 servings."

      "Preheat an empty 5- to 8-quart slow cooker on HIGH for 10 to 15 minutes while you're getting everything ready. Combine the butter and 1/2 cup of the miso in a medium bowl and mash them together to make a uniform mixture. Put the potatoes into the bottom of the slow cooker and add a small dollop of the miso butter; stir to coat. Season the potatoes lightly with salt. Pat the chicken dry and rub the remaining butter all over the chicken, and especially under the skin of the breasts directly on the breast meat: To do this, gently loosen the skin and separate it from the breast meat by sliding your fingers under the skin, then tuck some butter in there. Set the chicken on top of the potatoes.",
      "Cover the slow cooker and reduce the heat to LOW. Cook for 5 to 6 hours (the larger the slow cooker, the shorter the cook time), until the chicken breast registers 160\u00b0F internal temperature on an instant-read or probe thermometer when you check the top of the breast. Also check that the thickest part of the thigh and the juice in the cavity register at least 165\u00b0F. Cooking the chicken much beyond these temperatures will result in dry meat, so this is a case when pulling out the thermometer really makes a difference.",
      "Turn off and uncover the slow cooker and let the chicken rest for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat the broiler on high and position a rack 6 inches from the heat source (if that's how your broiler works). Line a baking sheet with foil or parchment paper. In a small bowl mix together the honey and remaining 1/4 cup miso.",
      "Using tongs slung through the cavity of the chicken and your hands to support it, carefully transfer the chicken from the slow cooker to a cutting board, leaving the drippings behind. Remove the potatoes from the slow cooker with a slotted spoon and put them on the prepared baking sheet. Carve the chicken and put the pieces on the baking sheet skin side up. Drizzle the chicken all over with the miso-honey mixture, then broil the potatoes and chicken until the chicken skin is caramelized and crisp, dark golden brown, about 5 minutes. (Don't walk away; the skin will burn quickly because of the sugar in the honey.)",
      "Put the chicken pieces and potatoes on a serving platter (or leave them on the baking sheet and serve them straight from that) and drizzle a little juice from the slow cooker over the whole thing. Top with chives and serve with lemon wedges."

For a gas grill, place 1/2 cup dry wood chips or corncobs in a smoker box (or wrap chips in aluminum foil and poke holes in the foil) and place over direct heat in the back of the grill.",
      "2. In the cavity of each fish, place 2 sprigs each of tarragon, dill, and parsley, and 2 stems of chives. Season with salt and pepper. Place 2 fish on each plank.",

      "5. Check the lemons after 2 or 3 minutes. If they have nice grill marks, remove them from the grill. The onions will take an additional 10 to 15 minutes and may be turned after the first 10 to 12 minutes. When they are nicely charred, remove them from the grill, too. Close the lid and continue to cook the fish until it is opaque and begins to flake when tested with a fork, 45 to 60 minutes total.",
      "6. Fillet the char and serve on a platter with the lemon and onion halves.",
      "Preheat the oven to 400\u00b0F. Place 1/2 cup dry wood chips or corncobs in a small metal pan on the bottom rack of the oven and let smolder for about 15 minutes before planking. Place the herb-stuffed planked fish in the middle of the oven. Oven smoke-plank for 45 to 60 minutes, or until the fish is opaque and begins to flake when tested with a fork. Garnish with lemon wedges. (Omit the onions.)"

Spread the herb rub under the skin on the thighs, drumsticks, and breasts. Spread any remaining rub inside the turkey cavity and on top of the skin. To ensure good oil flow, make sure the neck cavity is wide open, and use a small sharp knife to cut a small slit through the skin where the leg meets the breast.",
      "Place the turkey on the poultry rack, with the breast facing down and the legs facing up. Once the oil reaches 375\u00b0F, turn off the burner. Wearing an apron and long heavy-duty oven mitts, use the hook that attaches to the rack to slowly lower the turkey into the oil using a stop-and-go method-slowly lower the turkey 1 to 2 inches into the oil then pull it back out a bit, repeating until the bird is fully submerged. Turn the burner back on and bring the oil to 350\u00b0F. Throughout frying, adjust the heat as necessary to maintain the 350\u00b0F oil temperature. Fry the turkey for about 3 1/2 minutes per pound. Use the hook that attaches to the rack to slowly and carefully remove the turkey from the oil and place it on a cutting board or large rimmed baking sheet. Using an instant-read thermometer, test the fleshy part of the thighs and the thickest part of the breasts (test both sides, close to but not touching the bone); the thermometer needs to register at least 165\u00b0F. If not, use the hook to slowly and carefully lower the turkey back into the oil to finish frying. Once the internal temperature reaches 165\u00b0F, transfer the turkey to a cutting board, cover with foil, and let it rest 20 to 30 minutes before carving and serving."

Bring to a boil over high heat, boil for 1 minute, and then drain, discarding the liquid. Return the slices to the kettle and cover with 1 inch cold water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then decrease the heat to medium and cook, covered, at a lively simmer for 30 to 40 minutes, or until the fruit is very tender.",
      "While the citrus is cooking, prepare the tomatoes: Bring a medium kettle of water to a boil, then carefully drop the tomatoes into the water to loosen their skins. Leave the tomatoes immersed for 1 minute, then drain them in a large colander. When they are cool enough to handle, peel them over a large bowl, discarding the skins. Using your hands, gently tear the tomatoes into medium pieces.",
      "When both the citrus slices and tomatoes are ready, put them together into a nonreactive heatproof storage container with the sugar, lemon juice, and saffron, stirring well to combine. Cover tightly and refrigerate overnight.",
      "Place a saucer with five metal teaspoons in a flat place in your freezer for testing the marmalade later.",
      "Remove the tomato mixture from the refrigerator and transfer it to an 11- or 12-quart copper preserving pan or a wide nonreactive kettle. Add the cinnamon stick and stir well to incorporate any undissolved sugar.",
      "Bring the mixture to a boil over high heat. Cook at a rapid boil until the setting point is reached; this will take a minimum of 30 minutes, but may take longer depending on your individual stove and pan. Initially, the mixture will bubble gently for several minutes; then, as more moisture cooks out of it and its sugar concentration increases, it will begin to foam. Do not stir it at all during the initial bubbling; then, once it starts to foam, stir it gently every few minutes with a heatproof rubber spatula. As it gets close to being done, stir it slowly every minute or two to prevent burning, decreasing the heat a tiny bit if necessary. The marmalade is ready for testing when it turns slightly shiny and its bubbles become very small.",
      "To test the marmalade for doneness, remove it from the heat and carefully transfer a small representative half-spoonful to one of your frozen spoons. It should look glossy, with tiny bubbles throughout. Replace the spoon in the freezer for 3 to 4 minutes, then remove and carefully feel the underside of the spoon. It should be neither warm nor cold; if still warm, return it to the freezer for a moment. Tilt the spoon vertically to see whether the marmalade runs; if it does not run, and if its top layer has thickened to a jelly consistency, it is done. If it runs, cook it for another few minutes, stirring, and test again as needed.",
      "When the marmalade has finished cooking, turn off the heat but do not stir. Using a stainless-steel spoon, skim off any surface foam and discard. Remove the cinnamon stick. Pour the marmalade into sterilized jars and process according to the following instructions.",
      "When making preserves, be sure to sterilize your jars and lids, unless you plan to eat your jam right away. Although jams and marmalades are unlikely to become contaminated with anything toxic, it is important to eliminate even the minutest risk.",
      "There are many ways to sterilize jars, including putting them in a canning kettle or a sterilizing dishwasher, but my preferred way is in the oven. This method is easier than the other methods and, if you use an oven thermometer, is virtually foolproof. To sterilize jars and lids in the oven, first be sure they are perfectly clean. Place the clean jars upright with an equal number of clean unused lids on a baking sheet or sheet pan in a preheated 250\u00b0F oven. They should remain in the oven for a minimum of 30 minutes to ensure they are heated through. Remove them from the oven right when you need to fill them. After you have filled them, leaving 1/4 inch of room at the top, wipe the rims with a clean, damp cloth. Put the lids on, being careful to screw them on just until they are snug, and replace the jars in the oven for 15 minutes or so to ensure they are completely sterilized. They will seal as they cool.",
      "Sometimes the jars can become a little bit too hot when using this method, so before filling them, test their temperature first. Pour a little jam into one, and if it bubbles or boils in the jar, wait a few moments before filling the jars.",
      "Upon removing your filled jars from the oven, place them 1 inch apart on a drying rack to set overnight at room temperature. Do not jiggle or disturb them during this time, as this may disrupt their ability to set correctly. As the preserves cool, you may hear a few little pops as the lids seal. Before putting your preserves away, be sure to feel the top of each lid to verify that it has sealed; it should be curving in very slightly in the middle. If any jars have not sealed, put them in the refrigerator for safekeeping.",
      "To store sealed preserves, label and date them and keep them in a cool, dark place until you open them. After you open a jar, keep it in the refrigerator. You may also keep higher-sugar preserves at room temperature, assuming you plan to eat them within a few weeks or so. Low-sugar preserves should always be refrigerated once opened, unless you plan to consume them right away."

Cook for 6 hours and then remove the lid, take out the yogurt bowls, cover them and transfer them to the refrigerator to firm up further.
