    "title": "dad's buttermilk cornbread",
    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "1. Preheat oven to 375*F. Grease an 8 inch square pan.",
      "2. Melt butter in large skillet. Remove from heat and stir in sugar. Quickly add eggs and beat until well blended. Combine buttermilk with baking soda and stir into mixture in pan. Stir in cornmeal, flour, and salt until well blended and few lumps remain. Pour batter into the prepared pan.",
      "3. Bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 40 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.",
      "My Note: Just wanted to mention a few things in response to. First, I mix all ingredients in the pan I melt the butter inches Less dishes. Second, I often use whole wheat flour to cut sweetness and make it a tad more healthy. Third, it freezes fabulously. I always make a double batch, remove one from the pan after cooling, wrap it up and pop it in the freezer. Based on some, I want to clarify something. I use a regular pot to melt my butter inches After the butter has melted I proceed with adding the rest of the ingredients in that same pot. I do NOT get a separate bowl for mixing inches After all the ingredients are mixed in the pot I pour the batter into a baking pan. I do NOT mix everything in the pan I'm baking it inches I do NOT keep the butter and sugar mixture out when mixing the rest of the ingredients. Hope that helps. 7/24/08 I'd change the recipe if I could, but I can't figure out how, so I'll mention here that the normal baking time is 30 minutes. I put 30-40 minutes in the directions because it takes longer when you use whole wheat flour, which I often do. I'm guessing those who complain about it being dry are just seeing the \"cook time - 40 minutes\" at the top and overbaking it.",
      "11/24/12 I tweaked it a bit. I reduced the sugar a little, but think it would be fine for the full amount if you like your cornbread a little sweet. I used powdered buttermilk and water and added 2/3 Celsius fresh yellow corn. In my opinion, the ONLY way to cook cornbread is in a preheated cast iron skillet. It gives it such a wonderful buttery, crisp crust. I greased my 9 inches skillet with vegetable oil and put it in the oven while I assembled the recipe. When the batter was finished, I poured it into the hot skillet. I then baked it for 25 minutes. The result was top notch. Very moist with perfect texture.",
      "You had dry bread -- 1/4 lb not 1/4 cup butter! This might have made a difference if you read it wrong, 1/4 lb. is 1/2 cup of butter. Also I put it in my greased preheated iron skillet for 25 minute !",
      "The recipe is fantastic as written, but after making this recipe a few hunder times I made a few changes. I used Splenda instead of sugar, whole-wheat flour instead of all-purpose, Smart Balance Light instead of butter, and sour skim milk instead of buttermilk. Sounds like a lot of substitutions, but the end result was absolutely delicious, and nearly guilt free! This is the ONLY cornbread recipe that I use, and it comes out wonderful every time."

      "1. In a small bowl, mix together salt, paprika, onion powder, thyme, white pepper, black pepper, cayenne pepper, and garlic powder. Remove and discard giblets from chicken. Rinse chicken cavity, and pat dry with paper towel. Rub each chicken inside and out with spice mixture. Place 1 onion into the cavity of each chicken. Place chickens in a resealable bag or double wrap with plastic wrap. Refrigerate overnight, or at least 4 to 6 hours.",
      "2. Preheat oven to 250*F.",
      "3. Place chickens in a roasting pan. Bake uncovered for 5 hours, to a minimum internal temperature of 180*F. Let the chickens stand for 10 minutes before carving.",
      "MY NOTE: Made this last night for 2nd time with some minor changes, and it was SO good - We said it was possibly the best chicken I ever made and as good, if not even better than the store rotisserie chickens (which, in our opinion, are extremely yummy). The only things I did differently were I used a large 7+ lb. roaster instead of the 2 smaller ones. For the spices, I eliminated white pepper and cut the cayenne and paprika in half, and increased the garlic powder to a full teaspoon. Even doing that there is still plenty of kick in the spice mix. Like another reviewer I added a couple Tbsps. of minced garlic to the onions in the cavity. The biggest change? Last time I just seasoned and stuck in oven. This time, I wrapped in double plastic wrap (with the onions/garlic in place in the cavity) & ended up marinating for over 24 hours in the fridge - purely by accident, but it made all the difference! Slow-roasting at 250 (I did go up to 275 for about 45 minute in middle of cooking to ensure it would be done in time for dinner) cooked the bird perfectly in exactly 4 hours (Use a meat therm. - take out at 170, and let it rest before carving, it will be perfectly cooked but not dried out). Made gravy with the drippings, but the white meat was so moist it didn't even need it. I may never make a roast chicken any other way! P.S. when the chicken is done, drizzle some pan drippings over it, the chicken will suddenly glisten and look picture perfect for the table.",
      "My only suggestion is to get a jar and mix up a lot of the seasonings at one time to keep in your cabinet. I changed the servings to 64 and the ingredents came up in cup and tablespoon amounts for easy mixing. Then when I make a chicken I have the \"mix\" at my fingertips. It takes 3 to 4 tablespoons of mix per chicken. I normally serve this \"rubber chicken\" style with lots of veggies so I have leftover chicken. The next day I make enchiladas with the leftovers. Then I boil the bones for tortilla soup. This gives 3 meals my family of 5 loves. Even my picky one eats these 3 meals. I normally make this in the crockpot for easy cooking, but the roasting it in the oven yeilds better results on wet days."

      "Drain 1 hand full of hickory chips and place them on top of the charcoal. Put the cooking grate in place. Place the rib rack over the drip pan as far from the charcoal as possible, with the bone sides facing the charcoal. Close the lid. Close the top vent about halfway. Let the ribs cook and smoke for about one hour. Maintain temperature between 250\u00b0F and 300\u00b0F by opening and closing the top vent. Meanwhile, make the sauce and the mop.",
      "In a small saucepan mix the barbeque sauce ingredients. Simmer for a few minutes over medium heat, and then remove the sauce pan from the heat.",
      "In another small saucepan mix the mop ingredients. Simmer over medium heat for a few minutes to melt the butter, and then remove the saucepan from the heat.",
      "After the first hour of cooking add 8 - 10 charcoal briquettes and the remaining handful of hickory chips (drained) to the fire. At the same time lightly baste the ribs with some mop. Leaving the lid off for a few minutes while you mop the ribs will help the new briquettes to light. Close the lid and cook for another hour. During that time maintain the temperature at 250\u00b0F - 300\u00b0F by opening and closing the top vent.",
      "After another hour of cooking add 8 to 10 more briquettes to the fire. Remove the ribs from the rib rack, spread them over a clean work surface, and based them generously with the mop sauce. You may add 2 more tablespoons of barbecue sauce to the mop sauce if you wish. Put them back in the rib rack, again all facing the same direction, but this time turned over so that the ends facing down earlier now face up. Also, reposition any ribs that appear to be cooking faster to the back of the rib rack, farther from the charcoal. Let the ribs cook for a 3rd hour. During that time, maintain temperature of 250\u00b0F - 300\u00b0F.",
      "After 3 hours of cooking, check to see if any racks are ready to come off the grill. They are done when the meat has shrunk back from most of the bones by 1/4 inch or more. When you lift a rack by picking it up from one end with tongs, the rack should bend in the middle and the meat should tear easily. If the meat does not tear easily, continue to cook the ribs. The total cooking time could be anywhere from 3 to 4 1/2 hours. Not all racks will cook in the same amount of time. Baste the ribs with the barbeque sauce and, if desired for crispiness, cook them over direct heat for a few minutes. Transfer to a baking sheet and tightly cover with aluminum foil. Let rest for 10 - 15 minutes before serving. Serve warm with the remaining sauce on the side."

      "Make pasta: Put flour, salt, and gluten into the bowl of a stand mixer. Crack eggs into a bowl and add to flour all at once. Fit with the hook attachment and work at speed 3 or 4, for about five minutes, or until a cohesive dough comes together. Reduce to 2 speed, and knead in machine for about 8 minutes.",
      "Put about 1 cup flour into a clean mixing bowl, dredge dough lightly on both sides, tamp, and then fit into a gallon size bag to rest for 30 minutes. Set the bowl of flour aside, you will need it later.",
      "Make the white sauce: Melt butter gently, in a 6-cup saucepan, or its equivalent. Add the flour (1/3 cup), and the salt, pepper, and seasonings. Cook for about two minutes. Pour in the milk, and cream, all at once, increase the heat of the pan to medium-high, and stir with a whisk, while it comes to a boil. Remove from heat. Grate in some cheese. Check for salt. Remove 1/2 cup of it and cover. Divide remaining sauce evenly between three bowls, that can later accommodate each vegetable separately. Set aside.",
      "Make the garlic butter: Melt the butter in an 8-inch skillet over medium low heat, adding the garlic cloves, each crushed into a few pieces. Add 2 tablespoons of the oil. Simmer lazily for 5-8 minutes. Remove from heat and strain into a 1-cup glass measure, or a 1-cup metal measuring cup, pressing on the garlic cloves lightly. The mixture will be divided into thirds to saute the vegetables. The garlic cloves may sit in the butter for a while, if desired.",
      "Prepare the vegetables and keep them separated: peel and slice the carrots into thin rounds, no thicker than 1/4 inch, discarding both ends. Slice the zucchini exactly the same, 1/8-1/4 inch thick, discarding both ends. Pull all of the flowerets off of the broccoli crown, discarding the central core. Chop them fine, do this by cutting two or more slices, lengthwise down each stem of broccoli, as if beginning to dice an onion, then work the knife through it rapidly, chopping, through the flowery head, which will easily subside.",
      "Saute the vegetables: Heat a 12-inch lidded saute pan. Put in two or three tablespoons of the water, the carrots, and some salt. Increase the heat and add one third of the strained butter, cook, stirring often, until the carrots decrease in volume. Cover the pan, lower the heat, checking from time to time, and cook for about 8 minutes. The carrots should be fully cooked, and offer minimal resistance to the tooth, they should not be al dente, and will not continue to cook, in the lasagna.",
      "Place the carrots, and all the contents of the pan, into one of the bowls containing the white sauce, stir well, cover, and set aside.",
      "Return the pan to medium heat. Put in half of the remaining butter, and the zucchini, season with salt, and increase the heat, if desired. Stir often, separating the zucchini rounds as necessary, when a fond develops on the bottom of the pan, add two tablespoons of the water, to deglaze, cook the zucchini, just until they are done, they will cook faster than the other two vegetable, if they stick together, separate pieces with a dinner knife and fork. Pour them into the second bowl of Bechamel, stir, cover and set aside.",
      "Return the pan to medium heat. Add the remaining butter and the remaining oil (the broccoli really soaks it up) and slip in the broccoli, some salt, and the remaining two or three tablespoons of water. Cover the pan, and cook for a few minutes. Remove the lid, increase the heat, and simmer for a few minutes to evaporate any moisture. The broccoli should be fully cooked. Turn into the past pot of Bechamel, stir, cover, and set aside.",
      "Get a pot of water boiling with salt in it.",
      "Roll the pasta: Fit the mixer with the pasta rolling attachment. Retrieve the pasta and cut into eight equal pieces. Retrieve the bowl of flour. Sprinkle some lightly on a clean sheet pan. Keep the bowl handy. Run each piece of pasta dough through on the largest setting. Dredge each side of dough into flour as it comes from the machine, so that they can set together without sticking. Run the pasta through again on the next largest setting. Do not keep dredging in flour unless it seems sticky, but it probably won't. Run each pasta sheet through the machine, until reaching a setting of 5, or at most, 6, not more, or the cooking method will have to be changed. Do not trim the pasta.",
      "Blanch each piece of pasta in the simmering water for, in two batches, for about two or at most three minutes, it is possible that it could take less. The pasta should be very al dente, but edible. Retrieve with a pair of tongs lightly into a sieve, set over a bowl, run cold water over it continually, until it is not hot anymore. Have a large mixing bowl or basin handy, where they can be collected, after being retrieved from the running water. Do not dry them. Do this with all pasta sheets, it is okay to work in small batches, as long as you feel comfortable in the cooking process. Do not overcook them.",
      "Grease a rather deep 13x9 inch pan with a tablespoon of shortening, or softened butter. Put 1 pasta sheet into the pan. Add another, overlapping by no more than 1-inch. Use the sharpest, rather small knife that you can get, a paring knife or fillet knife will do. Trim the edges and sides up the pasta, allowing it to travel about 1/2-1-inch up the sides of the pan, so that it builds up a nice edge, and also a barrier for the filling to rest inches Add one of the fillings (I do carrots first, then zucchini, then broccoli, but you can do any order that you will), smooth the filling, then grate over Parmesan (you need Parm for each layer and the top, so work with that way for now). Do the same procedure to the pasta and filling for each layer, I press the pasta on the previously laid filling before adding the next. There will be pasta left over. If preferred, the filling can be laid (each time), before the pasta is trimmed around the edge.",
      "Lay on and cut the final layers of pasta, being cautious that it does not expose the filling from underneath. Spread the reserved 1/2 cup sauce evenly and dot with a thick layer of cheese. It is a good idea to grate the cheese all at once into a bowl before doing this because some of it will inevitably fall out of the pan if using a grater directly over the filling. You don't have to.",
      "Bake the lasagna uncovered on the middle level of a heated 375 degree oven for 25 or 28 minutes. Remove. Preheat the broiler. Glaze for two or three minutes. Rest 5."

If dough is too dense (stiff), add buttermilk, 1 tablespoon at a time, blending well into the dough after each addition, until the dough is the right consistency.",

Add the sugar and beat for about 2 minutes, until it is thoroughly blended into the butter. Add the eggs one at a time, then the yolks one by one, beating for 1 minute after each addition and scraping down the sides and bottom of the bowl as needed. Beat in the vanilla. Reduce the mixer speed to low and add the dry ingredients alternately with the buttermilk; add the dry ingredients in 3 portions and the buttermilk in 2 (begin and end with the dry ingredients); mix only until each new batch is blended into the batter.

When all the sugar is in, increase the mixer speed to medium and beat for a couple of minutes. Lower the speed and add the remaining tablespoon of boiling water, then increase the speed and give the frosting another quick spin. It will be light and should be thick enough to use immediately. If it doesn't hold its shape, beat it just a bit more.",

Frost the top of the layer, and cover with the second layer, top side down. Frost the sides and top of the cake, either smoothing the buttercream for a sleek look or using a spatula, knife or spoon to swirl it for a more exuberant look.",

(In Texas we have the wild grapes-I have not tried this yet- I am going to try it w/store bought green grapes.).",
      "Combine the cooked grapes with all other ingredients, pour into a pie crust and top with remaining crust sealing edges. Make slits in the top crust for vents. Sprinkle w/a wee bit of cinnamon and sugar.",

To finish, mix the sugar with the vinegar and add to the crockpot along with the capers and basil. Stir well and test for any additional seasoning, salt and pepper.

      "Sprinkle both sides of the steak liberally with salt, pepper, garlic powder and any other seasonings you might like on your steak. Let the steak rest at room temp for 45 minutes on a cutting board. This time is crucial to let the seasoning permeate the meat and draw some of the moisture toward the surface. After 45 minutes, pat both sides of the steak dry with paper towels again. Don't worry if some of the seasoning comes off, as most of the flavor in already soaked into the meat.",
      "Preheat your oven to 400 degrees. Using a deep cast iron skillet, place it on high heat until it is very hot. To the hot pan, add the peanut oil. Once the oil is very hot, use tongs to place your steak in the pan. Be careful not to splatter yourself with hot oil.",
      "Cook the steak for 2 minutes on one side, then carefully flip. Add the butter and sprigs of thyme to the pan and spoon the melted butter over the surface of the steak for another 2 minutes.",
      "Place the skillet in the hot oven for about 2 minutes. Then check the temperature with a meat thermometer. The center of the steak should read 120 degrees for medium rare. Continue to cook in the oven until 120 degrees is reached. Don't skip this step; as with pork chops, finishing the cooking in a hot oven helps to make the meat more tender and juicy.",
      "Turn off the oven and remove the steak from the pan and place it on a clean cutting board to rest for 15 minutes. Resting is extremely important because it allows the juices to move away from the outside and back into the center of the meat. DO NOT cut the meat until it is rested. Once rested, plate the steak and spoon some of the butter and thyme mixture over the steak.",
      "While the steak is resting, return the skillet with the pan drippings to the stove and add the onion soup, mushrooms with one can of mushroom juice, and wine to the skillet. Cook on medium high heat, stirring constantly to get the pan juices and brown bits off the bottom of the skillet. Continue cooking at a boil until the sauce reduces down to a thin gravy. This should take 10-15 minutes and be ready when your steak is done resting! Serve mushrooms either on top, or on the side of the steak.",
      "TIPS:",
      "Choose a bone-in Ribeye or Top Sirloin or Filet, and be sure the label says USDA Choice or Prime cut. A cut labeled Select will not give you a good result. Your steak should have a nice marbling of fat throughout.",

If you don't have one, you can use a regular skillet, just make sure it's large enough to fit the whole steak and deep enough to avoid splattering oil on you. Also make sure it is oven safe, because finishing the steak in the pan in a hot oven is very important.",

If you use fresh spinach you may want to cut or tear the spinach in slightly smaller pieces, but it's not absolutely necessary (the spinach will shrink anyway). Also slice the garlic. (This step can be performed while the bacon is cooking, as it can take quite a bit of time and can be finished before the rest without problems.).",
      "Put a relatively large (heavy) pan over high heat, with some oil (NO olive oil!) and a generous amount of salt. Put in the zucchini slices (you should hear a hiss immediately, otherwise the pan wasn't hot enough) and stir them regularly (turning them over) until they start to brown. If you don't have a large enough pan to have most of the slices on the bottom all the time, cook the vegetables in batches.",
      "Once the zucchini starts to brown, add the garlic and fry it for a few seconds (it should only just start to brown) and add the ,thawed and thoroughly drained/squeezed, spinach. Add the cumin and other spices/herbs (I added about a teaspoon of cumin, but you can add more or less depending on taste, try it). Also add the bacon and stir regularly until well mixed.",
      "Divide the vegetables over the pizza's and spread them out evenly (should form a layer slightly less than 1cm thick). Now sprinkle them with the shredded cheese until you're satisfied with the amount of cheese and put them in the oven for about 20 minutes.",
      "I had them in the oven for about 30 minutes, but I had them on a lower setting for a while and they came out slightly more browned than ideal, though not burned (so don't worry too much about putting them in the oven too long). Note: While in the oven it can be hard to see how well done the pizza's are, the spinach just gets a little darker, so you have to rely on the cheese and the pizza crust."

You might need to help get all the wheat wet by mixing it inches It doesn't have to be perfect, but we want the wheat wet. Stop once it's mixed (turn off machine). Of course you can do that by hand if you want to.",

      "Pour the remaining flour on top of the dough and make a little \"bowl\" in the flour and carefully pour the yeast into the indent so that it is separated from the dough. If you don't, it will activate too early. Even better if you have a bread machine with a separate yeast chamber. If so you do not need to hold back any flour.",

      "Bread Crumbs -- In a large sauce pan (you want a large pan as you will be adding the pasta and arugula to this pan), add the olive oil and bring to medium high heat. Add in the fresh bread crumbs and cook, stirring often, until golden brown and crisp. Add in the garlic and cook just another minute and remove from the heat. Add in the parsley, parmesan cheese, red pepper flakes and pepper. If you want you can add salt, but go easy, the parmesan, and the romano which will be added to the pasta later are salty, so you do not want to over season. You can always add more salt later. Mix to combine.",
      "Pasta -- Now, as you were making your bread crumbs, you should of started your pasta. It doesn't take long for thin spaghetti. Cook according to directions, in a large pot of salted water until al dente. Once the pasta is done, add in the arugula and toss. The arugula will wilt up just by the heat of the pasta - there is no reason to cook it any further. Immediately, drain the pasta and arugula well, but keep some of that pasta water. It will be used to make a light sauce.",
      "Combine -- Simply add the drained pasta and arugula right to the bread crumbs. Toss well to combine. Then add in the romano cheese, a little pasta water, and the basil. And again, toss well, check for any additional salt or pepper, and transfer to a serving bowl and finish with the 1/4 cup olive oil. If you don't want to add more oil, you can always serve it on the side. That way, each person can add it if they want.",

Using this measurement, add the same amount of sugar to the \"meat.\" If you have two cups of guava \"meat,\" add two cups of granulated sugar (i.e. one-for-one). Add two tablespoons of pectin and the juice of two small limes (or one large Persian lime). Bring to rolling boil for 20 minutes, stirring continually. The jam will be become a more intense pink/red color at this point.",

Remove from canner pot and place on a towel, allowing jars to cool. Listen for lids to pop signifying airtight seal. Remove rings only, dry, and re-place them on the jars. Store away."

      "Add 3/4 cup plus 1 tsp of warm water to a bowl. To the water, add the yeast and a small pinch of sugar. Stir to combine. Let the yeast get happy in the water for about 8 minutes.",
      "I normally use a KitchenAid Mixer to mix and knead the dough but you can certainly do it by hand (but kneading the dough will take longer). To the mixing bowl, add the flour, sugar, and salt. Stir to combine.",
      "After the yeast has bloomed for about 8 minutes, add it to the mixing bowl with the olive oil. Turn the mixer on to the lowest speed and allow the ingredients to combine - scraping down the sides of the bowl to ensure that all of the flour gets incorporated. After one minute, if the dough is a shaggy mess and hasn't formed a ball, there is not enough water in it. Just add an additional teaspoon of warm water and mix another 30 seconds on low. Depending on the humidity and time of the year, you may or may not need the additional teaspoon of water. Once the dough has formed into a fairly cohesive ball, turn off the mixer and allow the dough to rest for four minutes.",
      "After four minutes have elapsed, knead the dough on low speed using a dough hook for about two minutes (setting number 2 on a KitchenAid mixer). If you are kneading the dough by hand, it will take about 6 to 8 minutes. After the dough has been kneaded, form it into a smooth ball.",
      "Spray a medium-size bowl with cooking spray. To the bowl, add the dough and spritz the top with a little more cooking spray to keep it from drying out. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and allow it to sit in a warm place for one hour or until the dough has doubled in size.",
      "After the dough has doubled in size, punch it down and cut the dough into two pieces of equal size. Form the dough into balls, cover, and allow them to rest for 10 minutes. This rest period will make it easier to roll out the dough.",
      "After about 10 minutes, roll each piece of dough (using a rolling pin) into an elongated oval shape about 19\" long by about 4.5\" wide. If the dough stretches back too much when rolling it out, as it often does for me, cover the dough and let it rest another five minutes. Invert a sheet pan or cookie sheet so that the bottom is facing up. Add a piece of parchment paper to the top of the inverted sheet pan. Next, add both ovals of dough to the parchment, side-by-side, about 1 - 2\" apart. The dough should run nearly the entire length of the sheet pan. Spray a large piece of plastic wrap with cooking spray. This will keep the plastic wrap from sticking as the dough rises a second time. Place the plastic wrap on the dough - making sure that it is completely covered by the plastic wrap. Let the dough rise in a warm place for about 50 minutes.",
      "About 20 minutes before the dough has finished rising, preheat the oven to 325\u00b0F The rack should be in the center position.",
      "After the dough has finished rising for 50 minutes, uncover the dough. It should look puffy. Use your index finger to gently create little divots in the dough about 1\" apart - leaving a 1/2\" border around the dough untouched. This will keep the dough from rising too much in the center when it bakes. Sprinkle each oval with some kosher salt (or sea salt). Place the dough and sheet pan in the oven and bake for 25 minutes, turning the pan once during baking.",
      "After 25 minutes, remove the sheet pan from the oven. The bread should still be very blond in color. Because the outside edges of the dough brown faster than the inside edges, spin each piece of bread around 180 degrees so that the inside edges are now facing outward. Each oval will get 3.5 oz of cheese. Place all of the cheese in an even layer - leaving a 1/2\" border around the bread. If you get the cheese too close to the edge, it'll melt over the sides. If you accidentally spill some garlic powder on the bread before you put on the cheese, I won't tell anyone. Just make sure you do not accidentally get the garlic powder on the edges of the bread or it will burn. Return the bread and sheet pan to the oven and continue baking an additional 22 to 25 minutes or until the cheese has started to brown on the edges. Slide the bread onto a wire rack and allow it to cool before eating. It's great at room temperature but can been eaten warm as well.",
      "* A special note about the cheese:",
      "Pre-shredded cheese does NOT work in this recipe. I prefer using pre-sliced Sargento New York Sharp White Cheddar cheese, which is available in most grocery stores. It's not overly sharp and does not produce an oil slick after it melts like some cheddar cheeses can. That said, any good quality brick of sharp white cheddar will work. When using the pre-sliced Sargento, I fold over each piece of cheese so that it is double in thickness. If you are cutting the cheese yourself, make sure that each piece is about 1/8 to 1/4\" thick so that it melts properly."
