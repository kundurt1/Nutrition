Add oregano and thyme and stir for 30 seconds to release the flavors. Add chicken broth, water and beans; cover and bring to boil over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, simmer for 45 minutes or until beans are nearly tender. Meanwhile, cut potatoes into 1/2 inch chunks, coarsely chop cabbage and dice carrots. Add vegetables, salt and pepper to beans. Bring soup back to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low; cover and simmer an additional 35 minutes or until vegetables are very tender. Remove pot from heat and with a slotted spoon, mash some of the beans and vegetables to make soup thicker. Serve with french bread and fresh lettuce salad."
