Lay roots flat on a lightly-oiled cookie sheet (or two) and bake in the oven to desired crip level, between 11 and 15 minutes. The thicker slices will likely need to be turned over if they're not getting crispy within 10 minutes or so.",

Using tongs, roast the jalapeno and wrapped garlic over a flame (I used my gas stove) until the flesh is blackened, soft and hot. When cool enough to handle, remove the stem and seeds from the jalapeno. Place all ingredients (including jalapeno flesh) in a blender or food processor, and blend until ingredients are combined and there are no more chunks. You may need to use a rubber spatula to stir around the ingredients in order to blend them well. Spoon hummus into a serving bowl. Drizzle olive oil on top and sprinkle paprika and turmeric.

Turn Stand Mixer to Speed 2 and slowly position the blade against the potato to process. Repeat with remaining potatoes.

(If you prefer no skins in your hasbrowns, remove as many of the skins from the noodles as possible.)",

Trim the noodles to 10\"-12\" lengths; then, sprinkle salt and pepper over the squash noodles, add parsley, and drizzle 2 tablespoons of melted butter over the mixture. Using tongs, toss the noodles until all are evenly coated in butter. Set aside.",

Then, with two forks, evenly separate the potatoes and gather them into four 'nest' layers, one nest in each quadrant of the pan.",

Then, create a wide well (almost the complete width of the nest, but no deeper than the top of the potato layer) at the center of each squash layer, and crack an egg into the well. Gently 'nest' the eggs with a fork to slightly thin the whites (for ease of cooking), but without cracking the yolk. Reduce heat of the pan to medium, cover the pan, and allow the eggs to steam and potato base to fry for for 4-5 minutes (or until egg is cooked to desired doneness).

In another medium pot over medium heat, melt remaining butter. Whisk in flour and cook for 3 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to remove garlic and bay leaf from milk mixture; then, while continuously whisking, add the milk to the butter-flour mixture in a slow, steady stream.
