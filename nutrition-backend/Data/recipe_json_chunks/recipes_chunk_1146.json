      "Then deglaze the pot with the wine and also add the brandy. Cook 1-2 minutes until most of the liquid starts to reduce. Mix well. Add in the flour and stir well so everything is combined, make sure to cook just another minute to get rid of the flour taste. Slowly add in the broth and stir.",
      "Potatoes -- Then add in 2/3 of the potatoes and the bay leaf. Don't worry about exact measuring, just eyeball it. The remaining 1/3 of the potatoes mash up slightly. I just use a fork to lightly mash and break them up. They don't have to be perfect. Add them to the soup and season with salt and pepper, remember you can always season a bit more later. Bring to a boil, and then reduce to a simmer. Cook about 10 minutes until the potatoes are tender and the soup has thickened. Once again, check for seasoning and add in the fresh dill and 1/2 of the parsley. Also, if you want your soup a bit thicker at this point, take a little of the broth or just water and add another teaspoon of flour and mix well. Add slowly to the soup to thicken. I personally like the soup a bit thinner as the potatoes thicken it nicely, but it depends how you like yours.",

      "Additional Notes:",
      "The goat products in this recipe can be replaces with cows products. When choosing a cow cheese for this soup a variety of Parmesan or Romano would work nicely. I use the goat products because they are easier to digest and because of their tang and slight saltiness the soup requires less salt. I find that the goat products are great for cooking even if you don't like the taste of goat milk or cheese alone and that they add a richness and complexity to the food while still being reasonably good for you. Also, it is good to note that when you buy goat butter it comes in a very large brick instead of a stick. Half of this brick is equal to one regular stick of butter. You will want to half your brick for this recipe. Goat butter is pure white, unlike cow's butter, because it does not contain any karotin. Karotin is what gives cow's butter that, well, buttery hue.",
      "The rice flour in this recipe can also be replaced with regular all-purpose wheat flour. I like to use the rice flour because is easier to digest without having to sacrifice any creaminess in the soup. You do want to make sure that you cook the flour long enough in the butter however, or you will end up with a fine gritty texture to the soup. Wheat flour will make your soup a bit more glutenous in texture, which can be desirable. I find that when I make it with wheat flour that it takes less soup to fill me up.",
      "The littleneck clams in this recipe are pretty easy to find at your local fish monger. It is best to buy the clams on the day you intend to use them, but you can keep them in the refrigerator over night for 1 day. Place clams, free of packaging, in a bowl and cover with a damp but not sopping wet dishcloth. Then place it on the middle shelf of your fridge in the back. This is the coldest spot in your fridge. If a clam is open before you have cooked it it is dead and not a good idea to cook it. If it is closed tightly it is alive and fresh.",
      "This soup will keep for one day after cooking it. I do not recommend eating it after that."

      "To finish salsa, transfer tomatillos from Saucepan to blender container using Slotted Spoon. Remove jalapeno pepper from Saucepan; test for spiciness. Add desired amount of pepper to blender; cover and blend until smooth. Add cilantro and salt; blend 2 seconds or until cilantro is coarsely chopped.",
      "To finish tacos, line up taco shells, side by side, in Medium Bar Pan; fill with half of the cheese. Bake 5-6 minutes or until cheese is melted. Remove from oven.",
      "As taco shells bake, whisk eggs and water in Small Batter Bowl. Place butter in (10-in.) Skillet; heat over medium heat 1-3 minutes or until foamy. Add eggs; cook and stir 2-3 minutes or until eggs begin to set. Add 1/4 cup of the salsa; cook 1-2 minutes or until eggs are completely set.",
      "To serve, spoon eggs evenly into shells; sprinkle with remaining cheese, cilantro and tomato. Serve with remaining salsa.",
      "Cook's Tips: Tomatillos are also referred to as \"husk tomatoes\" because of their papery outer skins. Tomatillos are quite tart and are typically cooked before using. When buying tomatillos, the husks should be fresh looking, not brown and wrinkled. The fruit should be firm to the touch and not \"splitting\" the husk.",
      "The heat level of jalapeno peppers can vary widely. To test for spiciness, cut off and taste the end. It's best to add the jalapeno pepper conservatively; it's far easier to spice up a mild salsa than to try to reduce the heat once too much has been added."

The meat will need to dry for about 2 1/2 to 5 hours depending on how thick the meat is. The meat is done when it bends but does not break.

I used this on bagels, but can definitely see a lot of uses for this stuff and add-ins like orange zest. But this is great on homemade dinner rolls! Dinner guests always RAVE about this butter (little do they know how simple it is to make). For easier mixing, be sure your butter (definitely not margarine) and honey are room temperature Also, I like to use a bit of salted butter because it really does enhance the honey/butter flavor - I suggest half salted and half unsalted. I tried just adding salt once, but it doesn't really disolve well, so go with the presalted butter. A bee-keeper kept bees on our land and paid us in honey (about 80 pounds a year) so we used honey in everything -- but this was our favorite."
