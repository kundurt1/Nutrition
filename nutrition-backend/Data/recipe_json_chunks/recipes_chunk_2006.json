      "They'll become fragrant, but do not allow them to scorch or they'll become bitter.",
      "Remove the stems, seeds and ribs from the toasted chiles, and soak them in hot water to cover for about 20 minutes to rehydrate.",
      "Drain them and put them in the blender with the chipotle chile.",
      "Heat 1 tbs of oil over medium heat in the same skillet you used for toasting the chiles.",
      "Add the onions.",
      "Cook until soft and golden brown, stirring often, for about 10 minutes (lower the heat if needed to prevent scorching).",
      "Add the garlic and cook, stirring, for an additional minute.",
      "Move the onions and garlic to the blender, along with the cilantro, brandy, and 1/4 cup water.",

      "Make sure you're wearing an apron or smock at this point (trust me).",
