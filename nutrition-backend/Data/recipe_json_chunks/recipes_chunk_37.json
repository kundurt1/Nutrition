Turn roast over and add vegetables around base of roast in pan, with potatoes on bottom, covered by the carrots and at least 2 pieces of the apples on top of the roast. Cover the roasting pan after adding the vegetables. Add hot water to depth of about 1-inch. Bake for an additional hour or hour and 15 minutes or until vegetables are done and meat shreds easily. Remember to check water level occasionally. You don't want it to go dry."
