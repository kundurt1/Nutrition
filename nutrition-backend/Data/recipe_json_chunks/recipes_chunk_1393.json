    "title": "sichuan peppercorn red-braised ox tail",
    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "NOTE: Because this dish involves caramelising the sugar, I strongly recommend doing the initial sauteing/woking in a NON-STICK pot, then transferring the ingredients to an oven-proof pot (like cast-iron) to finish braising in the oven. In a non-stick pot, the caramelised sugar sticks to the meat instead of to the bottom of the pot, which can easily burn in my experience. This process is called \"red braise\" in Chinese cooking, referring to the amber/red sheen from the caramel.\r\n\r\nIt's quite important to grind the red sichuan peppercorn because they can be a bit unpleasant to bite into. You can use a stone mortar or spice grinder to do this, but if you have none, simply wrap the peppercorns in 2 layers of paper towel and smash them with a hammer.",
      "Preheat the oven on 320\u00b0F/165\u00b0C.\r\n\r\nRinse clean and dry the ox tails with a clean towel. Heat up a large non-stick wok, or deep saute-pan with 4 tbsp of oil over HIGH heat (don't worry about the amount of oil because it will be removed later). Brown the ox tails in batches until all surfaces are covered and no more blood is being released. Set the ox tails aside. Drain the oil and leave only 2 tbsp in the wok/pan, and turn the heat down to MEDIUM. Add the ginger slices and cook until they shrivel up and get nicely browned on the edges, approx 5 min. Add the ox tails back into the wok/pan, along with garlic (if you like it spicy, add 2 red chilis as well), star anise, sichuan peppercorn and granulated sugar. Turn the heat back on HIGH, and keep turning the ingredients until the sugar has fully caramelised, and all the ingredients are coated in deep brown, amber sheen.",
      "Transfer ALL the ingredients into a cast-iron or oven-proof pot, and return it to the stove. Add the rice wine and 1/2 cup of soy sauce, and let it gently boil with all the ingredients for a minute (turn and evenly coat the ingredients). Then add the chicken broth or water, and bring back to a simmer. The amount of liquid shouldn't be able to cover the ingredients (this isn't a stew), and should taste slightly UNDER-SEASONED at this point because of the excess water, which will evaporate during the braising process. If it taste generally BLAND, then adjust with more soy sauce.",
      "Transfer the pot (with the lid on) to the oven and let braise for 3 ~ 3 1/2 hours. Go back and turn the ox tails once every hour or so to ensure even braising. The ox tails should be very tender and almost falling off the bone, and the braising liquid should have reduced dramatically.",
      "After braising, carefully remove the ox tails from the braising liquid without tearing them. Tilt the pot to direct all the braising liquid to one side, and skim off as much fat from the surface as you can, without reducing the actual sauce on the bottom (there should be QUITE a lot of fat). Discard the star anise and ginger slices (press on the gingers to extract as much sauce that's clinging onto them before discarding). Leave the garlics which should have melted into the sauce at this point. Return the ox tails back into the pot, and return it to the stove over HIGH heat. Add 1 tsp of rice vinegar and reduce the sauce SLIGHTLY, just until the ox tails are coated in a shiny sheen.\r\n\r\nServe the ox tails over hot steamed rice. They get even better the next day."

      "Note: These instructions are for making this in a way that has you chopping and slicing while ingredients are cooking. The key is to turn the heat down every time you put the stirring spoon down. It seems like a lot of turning the heat up and turning the heat down, but it works. If you prefer to prep everything in advance, go ahead. The total cooking time should be about 40 minutes.",
      "Thinly slice the yellow onion. In a large pan that has a good lid - I actually use a huge skillet for making this --- heat the olive oil, then put the onion in with the bay leaves. With the heat on medium high, stir for about a minute. Add a good pinch of salt, stir a few more times, then turn the heat down to medium low.",
      "Thoroughly wash, cut in half lengthwise and then slice thinly the white and very pale green parts only of the leek. (Or thinly slice the shallots, if using.) Put in the pan with the onions and the butter, and give it all a good stir.",
      "Coarsely chop the garlic.",
      "Peel (or just scrub, if you prefer) and cut the potatoes into 3/4 inch cubes. Put the potatoes and the garlic in the pan and turn the heat up to medium high. Cook, stirring constantly, for about two minutes. Turn the heat down and put a lid on the pan.",

      "Chop the kale or chard leaves and put them in the pan. Stir well, then add the remaining cup of stock. Stir again, reduce the heat so the soup is just simmering, and put the lid back on. If you are using cooked ham or smoked turkey, add it with the kale or chard.",
      "Preheat broiler, if you're making cheese toasts.",
      "If using cheese and not tomato on your bread, slice the bread, and toast it very briefly under the broiler, if you want both sides crisp. Slather a bit of mustard on the side not toasted (or on either side, if you didn't toast the bread), then sprinkle the cheese on.",
      "Chop the parsley and add it to the soup. Stir well. Add a cup of water, or more, if there does not seem to be enough broth.",

      "If not making cheese toasts, and going the tomato on bread route, slice the bread. Cut the tomato in half. Rub it on one side of each slice of bread, bearing down a bit to release the juices. Sprinkle on a touch of coarse sea salt.",

This ensures an evenly cooked, brightly colored egg).\r\n\r\nNote: Casse-croute can also be made with fried eggs instead of hard boiled. To do this, simply crack your eggs in a frying pan with a little oil heated between medium and medium high. Add salt and black pepper. Once the outer white and inner white of the eggs have set, flip the eggs gently. Cook for about 30 seconds to one minute, just until the other side has seared for a runny egg. (Leave for longer if you prefer a harder yolk.) Set aside on a plate until ready to assemble the casse-croute.",

(Tip: there are a few ways to test if the oil is ready for frying: Use a heat-safe thermometer, ideal temperature for frying is 375 degrees. Or, use one of the french fries to test the oil, if it starts to sizzle and bubble, it's ready. One other trick is using the end of a wooden spoon, if bubbles form around it, you are ready to begin frying. Also, do not overcrowd the pan as the potatoes will not fry evenly; they may have to be done in batches.)",

Cook while stirring for about 1 minute. Then add the brown sugar, honey, soy sauce and white vinegar. Stir until everything is well mixed and the sugar has dissolved. Once the sauce is ready, set it aside in a bowl.\r\n\r\nTo make the cucumber and radish salad, whisk all of the ingredients for the dressing until evenly combined. Then add the sliced cucumber and radish and mix well. Set it aside.\r\n\r\nThen start to prepare the squid. You can ask your fishmonger to clean them for you or you can do it yourself. If you have never cleaned a squid before, start by slicing the tentacles off. Just slice it below the eyes. Reserve the tentacles but discard of the beak.\r\n\r\nThen holding the body, pull out the head and the inner parts. Also remove the flaps. What I like to do is pull the squid inside out so I can rinse it properly under cold water, don't forget to also rinse the tentacles. Then pull it back to normal and peel the thin skin so that you are left with only white meat. Pat the squid dry with some paper towels and then slice it into small rings. Repeat for all.",

Have another bowl ready with the beaten eggs and another one with the flour.\r\n\r\nDip each squid ring and tentacle in the flour, then the eggs and finally in the panko/cornmeal mixture. Repeat for all. Once all the calamari is well coated, place it on a tray in a single layer and keep it in the fridge until ready to fry.",
      "n the meanwhile, start prepping your steamed buns. I got them frozen and they went into my steamer for 5 minutes without thawing. The time will depend on the instructions in the package.\r\n\r\nThen place the vegetable oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Once the oil is hot, fry he calamari in batches until they are golden. This will only take a few minutes per batch. Just make sure the oil is not too hot that it burns them quickly.\r\n\r\nServe each bun with some of the cucumber and radish salad, calamari and drizzle some of the Korean sauce. Serve straight away.

Place the bowl over the saucepan and continue to whisk until the mixture becomes very thick and registers 180\u00b0 F on a thermometer. This will take 10 to 12 minutes.

The dough should be slightly sticky, but not smooth at this point. If it is too sticky, add a few pinches of all-purpose flour.",

Think of it like folding a piece of paper to fit into a standard-size envelope.

While the bottom side gets toasty, brush olive oil on the top. Check the underside after 30 to 60 seconds by gently lifting it with a sturdy spatula. Once the underside is toasty-brown to your liking, flip the dough and quickly assemble the toppings of your choice onto the dough while it is on the grill. Close the lid to help the cheese melt and check every 30 seconds or so until the underside is browned to your liking and the cheese is melted. If the bottom browns quicker than your cheese is melting, you can always move it to the top rack (if you have one) or a place of indirect heat to prevent it from burning while you wait for the melty goodness.",

Don't worry about it, but do make sure that the roasting pan remains moist.",

I slice a couple of Meyer lemons, dredge a few of the pieces very lightly in the freshly ground coriander and gently put all of the lemon slices (from which I've picked out the seeds) under the skin that covers the chicken breasts. Then I stuff a few sprigs of fresh cilantro in as well, on each side. The juices from the roast are fragrant and delicious!",
      "Before serving, add the remaining cilantro and lemon zest and add salt, to taste, if necessary.",
      "Note about the coriander: Using whole coriander seeds which you have toasted gently and then ground, right before using, makes this so much better. You'll need 1 tablespoon plus one teaspoon of seeds for every tablespoon of ground coriander. Use a small heavy skillet to heat the seeds for about four or five minutes. Be careful to stir them constantly and to remove them from the heat, and the pan, if necessary, once they become darker brown. Once they start to turn, they will darken very quickly, so please watch carefully, lest they burn. Let the whole seeds cool for a few minutes, then grind in an electric spice grinder until finely ground. They'll smell wonderful."

Let cook undisturbed for at least 2 minutes; then peek at one and check the browning (if it sticks, it means it hasn't browned enough). Cook until the pears have nice dark grill marks, 1 to 2 minutes longer. Then flip them over and cook just until heated through and softened slightly, about 4 minutes longer. Remove the pears from the grill and set aside.",
      "Put the vinegar in a small saucepan over medium-high heat and bring to a rapid simmer. Cook until it has reduced to about half its original volume and has become noticeably thicker, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and let cool slightly.",

      "Tip: To toast hazelnuts, spread them evenly on a rimmed baking sheet and broil, shaking the pan frequently, until toasted and fragrant, about 5 minutes. (They toast from the inside out, so let your nose guide you rather than your eyes.) Remove the skins by putting the nuts on a clean kitchen towel, gathering the corners to make a bundle, and rubbing the bundle against the palm of your hand.\r\nNote: Though it can be hard to find, Pedro Ximenez sherry vinegar would be spectacular here. It has a lovely fruity quality that's a little brighter than balsamic but reduces to the same lovely syrupy consistency."

      "TO PRHEAT THE OVEN: Place a large baking-dish/sheet (large enough to hold the cake-pan) that's at least 2?-deep inside the oven, and pour 1? of water inside. Turn the oven on 400\u00b0F/200\u00b0C and close the oven.",
      "TO MAKE THE CARAMEL ESPRESSO FLAN: Lightly oil the interior of a 8? round cake-pan, set aside. Cook granulated sugar and water in a medium-size pot (this is the same pot we're gonna use throughout the recipe) over medium heat, and bring it to a boil. Gently swirling the pot, and cook until the sugar turns light brown in color. At this point, turn off the heat and keep swirling. The sugar will continue to darken into a deep, amber-color (if not residual heat is left, return the pot to medium heat for a bit). Pour all the caramel into the cake-pan (a thin layer may be left inside the pot), and quickly swirl the pan to distribute an even layer of caramel on the bottom before it hardens (if it hardens too quickly, warm the bottom of the cake-pan over low heat). Set the cake-pan aside.",
      "Dip the bottom of the pot in a bit of water to cool it down. Add the half-half and ground espresso beans, and return to medium heat. Stir gently with a wooden spoon and bring to a bare simmer, then turn off the heat completely (the leftover caramel should melt back into the cream). Let it brew for 5 min. Meanwhile, whisk 4 large yolks, 2 large eggs and sweetened condensed milk together in another bowl until smooth. Slowly pour the espresso cream, through a very fine sieve, into the egg-mixture. Whisk quickly to combine. Discard the ground espresso in the sieve, then pour the espresso/egg-custard into the cake-pan, through the same sieve again.\r\n\r\nCut a thin strip of parchment paper, lightly oil one side and line the inside of the cake-pan just above the custard. Then set aside.",
      "TO MAKE THE BUTTER-ROUX CAKE: Wash the same pot clean and towel dry (use another pot if you prefer). Add the unsalted butter and cook over medium-high heat. Once it's melted and starts to bubble, add the all-purpose flour all at once. Whisk quickly until even then turn off the heat. Add the whole milk and light brown sugar and whisk until the sugar has melted. The cold milk and sugar should've cooled the roux enough so it doesn't cook the egg yolk. Now add the egg yolks and vanilla extract, and whisk until thick and even. Beat the egg white with 1/2 tsp of cream of tartar with a stand-mixer or handheld-mixer, until soft peaks form.",
      "Add 1/2 of the beaten egg whites into the roux/egg yolk-mixture, and stir gently until evenly combined. Then add the rest of the egg whites, and instead of stirring, gently fold it into the mixture with a spatula until even. Pour the cake batter into the cake-pan. Don't freak out if it seems to sink to the bottom through the custard! It will float back up because the batter is lighter than the custard! Smooth the top, and we're ready to bake.",
      "TO BAKE THE CAKE: Carefully place the cake-pan in the middle of the deep baking-sheet with water (which is hot by now). Lower the temperature down to 340\u00b0F/170\u00b0C, and bake for 50 ~ 55 min. A wooden skewer should come out completely clean from the center of the cake. Let the cake cool for 30 min on a cooling rack. Then gently pull away the parchment paper, and score the bottom-edge of the cake with a small knife. Place a large plate, up-side down over the cake-pan, then quickly invert it. Remove the cake-pan, and the cake should come out effortlessly.\r\n\r\nIf there's a layer of caramel on the bottom of the pan that's too thick to pour out, add 1 tsp of water and warm over low heat until the caramel's loose again. Pour over the cake. The cake gets better with time as the sponge cake absorbs the caramel and.... urgh! I can't even..."

Place an 8- to 10-inch crepe pan or nonstick skillet with sloped sides over medium heat. (If you have two crepe pans, using both will make the process go faster.) Place the small saucepan of melted skimmed butter near the pans, with a pastry brush nearby.",
      "When the pan is hot, brush it with a very thin, light coating of the skimmed butter and heat for 15 to 20 seconds. Add about 21/2 to 3 tablespoons of batter and swirl the pan to coat-if there is any excess, dump it out into a small bowl. If you notice how much you need for each crepe as you go, you will get better and better at adding the right amount of batter to the pan. (Note that you might have to discard [read: eat] your first crepe; that's typical when you make crepes.)",
      "Cook for about 1 minute, until the edges of the crepe begin to dry. Using your fingers or an offset spatula, turn the crepe over and continue cooking for about 10 to 15 seconds more; transfer to a plate and place a sheet of the pre-cut parchment paper on top. Repeat the process: grease the pan with the melted, skimmed butter, and use all of the batter, stacking each crepe on top of the last, separated by a sheet of parchment paper, as you go. (You can make crepes with the leftover batter that you poured out of the pan into the small bowl, but they will likely become chef's treats; that batter has been heated a bit and might cook up a bit differently.) You will end up with 15 to 16 crepes (don't worry; this cake is very forgiving). At this point, you can proceed to the filling assembly of the cake or freeze the crepes (see Kitchen Tips).",
      "Make the filling: In a food processor, pulse the cookies 5 to 10 times, about 1 second per pulse, until they become fine crumbs. Pour them out into a large bowl; you should have about 13/4 cups. Wipe the processor bowl and blade clean. Combine the mascarpone, cream cheese, sugar, and vanilla in a the processor. Process for 20 to 40 seconds, until completely smooth, stopping to scrape the bowl down about after about 10 to 15 seconds. Transfer the cheese mixture into the bowl with the cookie crumbs and stir gently to combine. Do not overmix or you will lose the fun speckled look.",
      "Make the crepe cake: Place one crepe on a serving platter. Coat with about 3 tablespoons filling, smoothing it gently with a spatula to 1/2 inch of the edge. Place another crepe on top, spread the surface with filling, and repeat with the remaining crepes and filling until the stack reaches at least 4 inches in height. You can build it as tall as you like (see Kitchen Tip)."

To shred the basil leaves, roll 3-4 leaves lengthwise so that the leaves form a tube and then chop along the length of the tube, making cuts as thin as possible. Add the shredded leaves to the chopped tomatoes. Add 1 1/2-2 tablespoons of the zucchini marinade liquid to your tomatoes and basil (try to avoid letting pieces of the minced garlic get into your spoonful). Toss the three ingredients together. Add salt and pepper to taste.",

      "Assemble: For each slice of bread, spread an even layer of roasted garlic, dividing the amount evenly per slice. Then place one slice each of the grilled yellow squash and zucchini on top. Gently spoon 2-3 tablespoons of the bruschetta, lightly drained, onto the zucchini. Take . Place a mozzarella slice on top. Place each assembled slice into the grill at medium heat, close the grill and let sit for approximately 3-4 minutes or until the bottoms are crunchy and the mozzarella is melted. Serve immediately."

Add egg yolk, lemon juice and sherry vinegar, whisking until smooth and combined. Slowly add oil, a few drops at a time, whisking thoroughly to emulsify before adding more. Repeat until all oil is added and mixture is thick. Fold in smoked paprika and chives. Transfer to a small jar with a lid and store in refrigerator until tempura is ready to eat. Sauce will keep, refrigerated, for about a week.",
      "Using a sharp knife, carefully slice off stem end of each pepper. One at a time, place a pepper horizontally on cutting board in front of you. Make an angled cut into the top of the pepper and slowly and carefully cut around core of pepper (knife blade moving away from you, pepper flesh rolling towards you) until you have cut all of the flesh away, leaving the core, seeds and bottom of the pepper to discard. Slice pepper flesh lengthwise into strips. Set aside.",
      "In a large Dutch oven with a cover pour enough frying oil to reach a depth of about two inches. \r\nTurn on stove to medium heat (4 on my electric range) to begin heating oil (if you have a digital frying thermometer, heat to between 320-330 degrees). If you do not have a thermometer (I do not have one) you know oil is ready when a droplet of batter drops to the bottom of the pot and then quickly sizzles back up. If it stays at the bottom, the oil is not hot enough; if it does not fall to the bottom at all and quickly sizzles at the top it is too hot. It will take a few minutes to reach this temperature so there is enough time to make your batter.",
      "The key to crispy tempura is ice cold batter. Make the batter by nesting a medium sized, preferably metal, bowl in a larger one that has a little ice water in it (smaller bowl will \"float\" in ice bath). Combine egg and most of ice cold water (about 3/4 cup) in medium sized bowl and gently blend using chopsticks. Sift chickpea flour, garbanzo flour and potato starch and add to egg mixture all at once. Stir gently to just combine - you want your batter lumpy. Add more ice cold water if batter is too thick (and difficult to stir). You can also add an ice cube to batter to keep it really cold. Working in batches, dust red pepper strips with potato starch and when oil is ready, use chopsticks or tongs to dip and swirl pieces in batter and place in Dutch oven to fry. Pepper strips should initially fall to the bottom and then sizzle up. Allow to cook for about a minute; when pepper feels crisp when grasped with utensil and sizzle has subsided remove and drain on a paper towel lined platter. Sprinkle hot tempura with a pinch of salt and a dash of smoked paprika. \r\nThe first piece or two will inevitably be test pieces until you figure out your own rhythm. Do not overcrowd pot and as you continue cooking, occasionally skim surface of oil with a metal slotted spoon to remove cooked bits of batter. Tempura is best enjoyed hot so if you have a waiting crowd, serve with smoky garlic aioli as you go.",
      "Note on batter: This makes enough batter for more than just the red peppers. When I retested this recipe last night, I also made eggplant, broccoli, green onion, cilantro and Italian parsley tempura. Of these, I really loved and recommend the green onion, parsley and cilantro tempura to go with the red pepper."

Repeat with the second layer, then top with the final cake layer.\r\n\r\nSpread the remaining ganache over the cake. Work quickly so it doesn't cool down while you're still spreading it, which can make for an ugly cake. While the ganache is still soft, press the marshmallows onto the top of the cake. Put cake in the fridge for at least 30 minutes to let the ganache harden up.\r\n\r\nFinally, the fun part! Take that baby out of the fridge, turn on your kitchen torch and brown the marshmallows on top, being careful not to melt the ganache, until perfectly campfire brown. If you notice the ganache is looking pretty shiny and soft, put the cake into the fridge for 5 minutes before continuing to torch the cake.\r\n\r\nStore cake in the fridge but let come to room temperature for at least an hour before serving. YUM!"

Make sure every two hours you check the meat to check the sauce isn't burning on the sides. After about 4 hours you can use the knife to start pulling the meat apart.

However La Espanola www.donajuana.com has created a specialty of recreating regional Spanish sausages. I've been buying their products for more than 20 years. I'm willing to bet that if you dine in a Spanish restaurant in the USA the chorizo that you are eating was manufactured at their family run plant in Harbor City. Another great American success story. Other Spanish products (including paella pans) can be ordered from The Spanish Table or Tienda on-line."

When rolling the tamale together, take the right-hand side and fold it onto the rest of the corn husk covered with tamale masa mix.

While doing this, boil 2 cups of water in the pot- or what equates to 1 inch in height of the water.",

Chop the cauliflower into bite size florets. Mince the garlic and ginger. Trim the scallions and thinly slice on an angle, keeping the white and dark green parts separate. Thinly slice the pepper (if using). Peel and devein the shrimp and pat completely dry. Season the shrimp with salt and pepper and set aside. In a small bowl, mix the soy sauce, sesame oil, and rice vinegar and set aside.",

Once shimmering, add the cauliflower and cook, without moving, for 3-4 minutes until brown and crispy on the bottoms (be careful it doesn't burn!). Flip and continue cooking until browned on most sides and softened, about 5 minutes. Note: I used thawed frozen cauliflower, so if you're using fresh cauliflower, you may need to adjust the cooking time and heat accordingly. Once the cauliflower is cooked, add the white parts of the scallion, the ginger, garlic, and the sliced chili pepper (if using). Saute, stirring often, until fragrant, about 45 seconds. Remove from the skillet and set aside. Wipe out the skillet.",
      "Sear the Shrimp: Add just a touch (about 1 teaspoon, depending on how well seasoned your skillet is) of olive oil to the same pan and heat over medium high until shimmering. Add the shrimp to the pan without crowding. You may need to cook in batches. Cook without moving for 45 seconds until the bottoms are beginning to crisp up and you start to see pink on the sides of the shrimp. Flip. Cook for an additional 45 seconds until opaque and just cooked through. Do not overcook. Remove the shrimp from the skillet and add it to the bowl of cauliflower. Wipe out the pan.",
      "Make the Barley: Add a teaspoon of olive oil to the skillet and add the barley to the skillet, cook for about 5 minutes until toasted. Add the soy sauce mixture to the barely and stir gently to combine. Reduce heat to low and add the shrimp and cauliflower mixture. Stir gently to combine and leave on very low heat while you make the eggs.",
      "Fry the Eggs: In a nonstick pan (or very well seasoned cast iron skillet), heat a small amount of vegetable oil over medium heat and use a paper towel to spread the oil all over the bottom of the pan. Once hot, carefully crack two eggs into the skillet on opposite sides of each other. (Or do one at a time). Season with salt and pepper. Cook without touching, reducing heat if necessary, until whites have begun to set. Once the whites are mostly set (you may still see translucent whites around the yolks), add 1 tablespoon of water and quickly cover the skillet to hold in the steam. Let cook for about 30 seconds. Remove from heat.",

      "In a small bowl, soak the smashed garlic cloves in the olive oil for at least half an hour to infuse the olive oil with garlic flavor.",
      "Generously brush the baguette slices on both sides with the garlic-infused olive oil. The remaining garlic-infused oil will be used to sautee the bruschetta topping.",
      "Add some plain olive oil to cover the bottom of a large skillet with a very thin layer of oil. Heat on medium-high until quite hot. Toast the pre-oiled baguette slices (2 or 3 at a time) in the skillet, 1 to 2 minutes per side, or until the slices reach your desired amount of golden color. Remove from heat and keep warm on a platter until ready to top with the bruschetta topping.",
      "In a wok or saute pan, heat the leftover garlic-infused olive oil on medium-high until fairly hot. Add the scallions and saute briefly, just to release the aromatics into the oil. Add the halved cherry tomatoes, salt and sugar and saute for 2-3 mins. If you want softer tomatoes and more sauce, cook a bit longer. You can also add in the optional soy sauce and/or red chili pepper flakes. Reduce heat to med-low.",
      "Add the breadcrumbs if you want to thicken the sauce a bit. Stir in the basil and continue cooking for about half minute to extract the flavor into the sauce. Taste and adjust with more salt and/or sugar as needed. I like to add sugar to savory foods, as the sugar rounds out the salty flavor and gives a dish more body.",
      "Top the toasts with the freshly sauteed topping for a show-stopping presentation and aromatic experience! Any excess juices left in the pan can be reserved for later use as a tasty sauce for noodles or rice or in a soup."

If your food processor is on the smaller side, you might need to do this in batches.",
      "Spread the processed cauliflower out on a large plate or platter and microwave for 8 minutes, stirring once about halfway through. Alternately, you can cook it on the stovetop: bring an inch or so of water to a simmer in a deep pot large enough to hold a fine mesh sieve or a colander lined with cheesecloth. Transfer the cauliflower to the sieve or colander and set it over the simmering water. Cover and steam until the cauliflower has softened but still retains its texture, about 5-8 minutes.",
      "Place the cooked cauliflower in a kitchen towel and wring as dry as possible. You want to remove as much water as possible from the cauliflower so it can soak up the cooking liquid and seasonings. Fluff the cauliflower with a fork to break up any clumps (you should have about 4 cups) and place it in a large saucepan or stockpot. Add the cream, water, 2 tablespoons of the butter, the pepper and a generous pinch of salt. Cook over medium heat until the butter has melted and the cauliflower has started to absorb some of the liquid. Reduce the heat to low and stir in the cheese. Continue to cook, stirring often, until the cheese has melted. Reduce the heat to low and cover the cauliflower grits while you prepare the shrimp.",
      "To make the shrimp: Saute the bacon in a large skillet over medium heat until just crisp. Remove the bacon from the pan with a slotted spoon and set aside. You want about 2 tablespoons of fat left in the pan. If you have excess, pour it off. If you don't have enough, add a little butter or olive oil. Add the garlic and saute until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add the mushrooms and green onion along with a pinch of salt. Cook until the mushrooms are tender and starting to turn golden, about 4-5 minutes. Remove from the pan and set aside.",
      "Raise the heat to medium-high. Add the remaining 3 tablespoons butter to the pan. When it has melted, add the shrimp along with a pinch of salt and saute until the shrimp are almost cooked through. The time will vary depending on the size of your shrimp. To check for doneness, remove a shrimp from the pan and cut it in half. You want the inside to be slightly translucent. The shrimp will continue to cook off the heat and be cooked through by the time you serve them.",

      "This recipe requires a double boiler. If you have one, please skip to step 2. If not here is a little diy tip. If you don't have a double boiler, create one using a pot and a stainless steel bowl. Choose a pot that is bigger than the bowl. Fill the water up to half the pot, or until it only touches the bottom of the bowl. Make sure to test out the water level beforehand to avoid water from over boiling and spilling out on you as you melt the chocolate.",
      "Set your stove to medium-high heat and bring the water to a vicious boil. Once it boil, reduce the heat to low (about 3 on a scale of 1-6 of a gas stove). This will prevent the water from spilling out on the side and overcooking your chocolate.\r\n\r\nTip: Overheating chocolate will result in thick and lumpy fudge texture, which we DO NOT WANT! Lower the heat as you prepare to melt your chips will give you more control and produce a silky, smooth, and creamy fudge result.",
      "This is the recipe to make Emergency Caffeine Fudge. Keep on reading for the other flavors. Add in the butter, salt, and vanilla into the mixing bowl that you have heated up on top of your boiling water in a pot. Wait until all the butter is fully melted.",
      "Once the butter completely melted, add the condensed milk and espresso powders. Give it a whisk and add in the chocolate chips. Make sure that your butter is fully melted prior to adding the chips in. Adding chips beforehand will result in a clumpy fudge.\r\n\r\nTip: For a fancier fudge, feel free to use any fancy chocolate bar for the espresso fudge flavor. Make sure to chop up your chocolate bar into tiny chunks. This will prevent overheating chocolate and reduces the time to melt the chocolate.",
      "Wait until the chocolate is a little soften and then stir the batch constantly until all chips are melted. This will help melt all the chips evenly. Remove the mixing bowl with the melted chocolate in it from the pot. Set it aside. Use a spatula, fold in the chocolate until it is super smooth and shiny. You are doing this to help remove any water in the sugar and make it more thick. DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP.",
      "Once it melted chocolate reaches a thick consistency and has a nice shine, pour it into a greased pan or mold you have prepped and spread it out evenly. Set it aside at room temperature and wait until it is set. This process might requires several hours, so it is best to cover it and let it sit at room temperature overnight.\r\n\r\nTip: If you have a mold for fudge great. Unfortunately, I do not. Just line your baking sheet with aluminum foil, grease it, and you are set to go. You can make divider like I did by folding your aluminum foil sheet until strip. Try to choose a baking pan that is deep so you can make a thicker fudge.",
      "After it is set overnight, use a pizza cutter to cut them up into tiny cubes. Pizza cutter will help make even pieces with straight edge. Separate them out with a sharp knife. Once your pizza cutter is covered in chocolate, wipe it down with a wet paper towel before continue cutting.",
      "To make the I Can't Believed It's Not Reese's Peanut Buttercup, repeat steps 2-6 and make extra Espresso fudge for the bottom layer. Once that is done, repeat steps 2-6 with mini peanut buttercup (omit the espresso powder and chocolate chips). Pour over the espresso fudge bottom layer. Next follow Step 7.",
      "To make the Peppermint Bark, repeat steps 2-6 and make extra Espresso fudge for the bottom layer. Once that is done, repeat steps 2-6 with white chocolate chips instead of the dark chocolate chips (omit the espresso powder). Add in the crushed candy canes and mix. Pour over the espresso fudge bottom layer. Next follow Step 7.",

      "For gift ideas, place a parchment paper down inside a box that has a window. To make it super festive, use decorative parchment paper. Place your fudge squares into the box. Lay them out any way you like, be creative. Cut out a cute label of any shape and add your initial or signature to make it super special and cute. I used a window cupcake box size 6.25\" X 6.25\" X 3\". You can brought it on Amazon.com for super cheap."

If you are using the back oblaten, arrange them on a parchment-lined sheet pan and then scoop the dough into the center of each one. Use your fingers to gently flatten the tops of cookies until they are 1/2 inch thick (wetting your hands makes this a little easier). If you are using back oblaten, leave a 1/4-inch border of wafer around the cookie dough. Place three almonds very close together in the center of each lebkuchen (they spread as the lebkuchen cook). Bake for 15 to 18 minutes, rotating the pans after 12 minutes, until the cookies are set but still soft in the middle. When in doubt, pull them sooner rather than later.",

      "When the cookies are done, let them cool for a minute or two then transfer to a wire rack set over a parchment-lined sheet pan (to catch glaze drips). Brush the warm lebkuchen with glaze. Repeat if desired. Let the glaze dry completely (an hour or so) before storing.",
      "Store lebkuchen in an airtight container with a small handful of apple peels or a slice of apple or orange. This keeps the cookies moist. The cookies will keep for up to 6 weeks this way and they get better as they age and the spices and citrus oils continue to blend.",
      "A NOTE ON INGREDIENTS: \r\n I prefer sorghum syrup for these cookies, which can be hard to find outside the South. But if you can get your hands on a bottle, its bright sweetness and tart edges will elevate these lebkuchen to some of the finest Christmas cookies around. Light molasses produces great lebkuchen as well. I think dark and blackstrap molasses overwhelm the flavor of the citrus and spice.\r\n Also, I finally found a local source for back oblaten, the thin, edible wafer rounds traditionally used for lebkuchen! If you are in Seattle, you can buy them at PFI. They are also available from specialty sources on the internet. I have made these cookies many times without them, though, and back oblaten are not at all necessary for delicious lebkuchen."

The mixture will seem extremely liquid at first -- just continue to mix and the egg will gradually absorb into the pork, leaving a thick porridge-like mixture. If you want rounder and firmer meatballs that you can shape with your hands, use two eggs instead of three. I thought this yielded meatballs that were lovely and tender, so I used three.",

Using a 1/4-cup measuring cup or a large ice cream scoop, drop balls of the pork mixture into the wok in a single layer. Let sizzle in the pan for 2 to 3 minutes or until browned, then flip and cook the other side. Once the meatball is browned on both sides (it doesn't have to be cooked through), remove with a slotted spoon and set aside. You will likely have to fry in two batches.",

      "Makes 10 olive rolls\r\n\r\nMethod: Whether by food processor or by hand, this should take you just a few minutes to prepare and put together. \r\n I like to start my bread to rise the night before. The bread has all night to rest and rise. Remember some basic things about bread making: the longer it rises, the more flavorful it will be. It will also be light and airy inside. Be patient, your end result will be perfect.\r\n\r\nInto a bowl, proof your yeast with 1/2 cup of warm water. If you are using the food processor, just place it in the food processor bowl and pulse. If you are doing this by hand, that is ok. too. All of my breads require almond \"No kneading.\" \r\n\r\n In a separate bowl, measure you flour, add your salt and mix. Add your additional water to your bowl of your food processor and pulse once. (If you are doing this by hand, mix with your hand until combined. It will be sticky, that is what you want. Do not over mix). .Turn your machine on and begin to add your flour until your bowl is empty. After just about 30 seconds you will begin to see your dough forming a ball. You want it to be sticky to the touch. Turn your bowl over onto your floured counter and bring it together into a sticky ball shape. Do not worry if its sticky. This process is very much like making my \"Pane di Nonno\" except we are making rolls. Place the ball back in a bowl, covered. Place it in a dark kitchen cabinet, covered with a plate or plastic wrap so the air is trapped inside and the ball of flour doesn't dry out.\r\n\r\n\r\nLeave for up to 12 hours to rise. I left mine overnight. In the meantime pit your black olives and cut them into tiny pieces and place in a covered bowl. Set aside for later.\r\nThe next morning, remove your bowl from your cabinet and you will notice your flour has risen and is quite sticky. Remove it onto a floured surface and form into a ball. This should take 10 seconds. Be sure to flatten and shape into a ball. Set it into the bowl for one hour. \r\nRemove the ball onto a floured surface and pat down. Add your chopped black olives and fold over twice. \r\nLet rest 30 minutes.",
      "Divide your ball of flour into two 8 inch logs with a pastry cutter or knife. Form and shape into a log and let rest 30 more minutes covered loosely with plastic wrap.\r\n\r\nAt this point if you have a non stick cupcake pan, sprinkle your cornmeal into 10 of the cupcake forms. \r\nYou may use a cookie sheet.. Just spread the rolls about 2 inches apart.\r\nDivide each log into 5 equal pieces. Form each piece into a ball. Place the balls into the cupcake forms\r\nIf you do not have a cupcake pan, use a cookie sheet. You do not need fancy equipment. \r\nLet them rest another hour in the pan. They will continue to rise. Do not be alarmed if they are slightly uneven. \r\nHeat your oven to 450 degrees/ bake\r\nBake them for 45 minutes. You will notice they will keep growing in the oven. It will be hard to resist just one.",
      "Special note: If you do not have a food processor, do not worry. With a wooden spoon or your hands, mix your flour and water until its just come together. It will be sticky and wet. It does not have to be kneaded, just mixed. Cover your bowl and follow the rest of the above steps"

    "title": "early spring risotto with fava beans, asparagus and artichokes",
    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "The Preparation:\r\nCut the asparagus on the diagonal, leaving only the tips and set aside. (Save the rest for another dish of sauteed vegetables or frittata.) Peel the baby artichokes of their outer flower petals and quarter them. Put them in water with a squeeze of lemon so they don't oxidize. Par boil them to take out some of the bitterness, then add them at the end.\r\n\r\nPeel the fava bean's thick sheath or outer peel away, and then you par boil them for a minute and it will be easier to peel the tight skin. It is worth the extra work, they are delicious and add a distinct flavor. After peeling or par-boiling, saute the favas in a little garlic for just a minute or two, just until they brighten up in color. Put in a cuisinart bowl, pulse and set aside. Wash the leeks, finely chop the leeks and fennel the same size. Zest the lemon into a bowl, set aside. Thinly slice the fresh herbs and set aside. \r\n\r\nPour the broth into a saucepan and bring to a simmer. (You will need this nearby while cooking the dish, adding as you go until it is incorporated and the risotto is creamy in texture.)",
      "The Cooking:\r\nHeat a large skillet or your largest 2\" deep saute pan. Heat saute pan to medium-warm, add 1/2 the olive oil, salt and pepper, then, add the leeks and fennel, saute until softened, 5 to 8 minutes. Add the rice and stir until the rice is completely heated through, about 5 minutes. Add the white wine and simmer for a few minutes before adding a ladleful of broth. Stir for 3 to 4 minutes until the broth is absorbed or incorporated. Reduce the heat to low and continue to add the broth a ladleful at a time, waiting until each addition is absorbed before adding the next. \r\n\r\nWhen the risotto becomes creamy, cohesive and a little al dente, add the asparagus, and cook for another 10-15 minutes. \r\n\r\nStir in the remaining broth until it is incorporated and the kernels are al dente at the center and creamy on the outside, 30 minutes in all. Stir in the parmesan cheese, lemon zest and chopped basil or parsley and heat through, about 5 minutes. The risotto should be creamy and loose, but not runny. It should not be clumpy, if so, add a bit more liquid and incorporate until it is smooth. Finally, add the pureed fava and garlic mixture until completely melded together and risotto starts to turn a little green. Add some Parmesan cheese at the stove, then remove from the heat and transfer to a warmed serving dish. Serve more Parmesan Reggiano at the table for your guests.

Now, top each tartlet with 4 dried goji berries, just the way you like it. Carefully place them into the freezer for 1 night or for at least 4 hours. Take them out of the freezer 30-45 minutes before eating. The top is like a beautiful soft creamy cashew goji berry ice-cream & the base is a raw brownie in a tartlet tin! Wait 15 minutes before removing the tin outside & the bottom. Yummm!\r\n\r\nThey are Raw, Vegan, Gluten-free, corn-free, soy-free, egg-free, healthy & very filling too with all of these nuts in them! Before they went in the freezer you tasted the dates a lot & after 1 night in the freezer you taste the goji berries better!\r\n\r\nServe them at room temperature on a cool plate & enjoy this wonderful raw goji berry brownie tartlet with a big smile on your face! ;) Yum! xxx\r\nStore them in the freezer! :) xxx"

      "In a small pan over medium heat, melt the butter. Add the brown sugar and stir to combine. Cook until the sugar is melted and browned a little, about 3 minutes. Set aside.",
      "Peel and chop the bananas into 1/2 inch pieces and combine with 2 cups of the milk, the sugar and salt in a medium saucepan. Split the vanilla bean down the middle and scrape the seeds into the milk mixture, add the pod in as well. Cook over medium-low heat until it starts to steam, then strain the mixture through a fine mesh sieve and discard the bananas and vanilla bean pod.",
      "Combine the eggs, cornstarch, and remaining half cup of milk in a bowl. Slowly add about 1/3 of the milk to the egg mixture, stirring constantly. Do the same with another 1/3 of the egg mixture. Add the egg and milk mixture back into the pan, stirring to incorporate.",
      "Cook, stirring occasionally, until the mixture thickens and just starts to boil - about five minutes. Stir in the caramel mixture. Reduce the heat to low and cook another five minutes.",
      "Pour the pudding through a strainer into six ramekins (or about a one quart dish). Put plastic wrap directly on the pudding so it doesn't get a skin. Chill until cold, at least 30 minutes but up to a day. To serve, top with the crumble.",
      "To make the crumble, preheat the oven to 325\u00b0. Line a rimmed baking sheet with foil or parchment paper and set aside. Place the vanilla wafers in a plastic bag and crush using a rolling pin. (I like this better than the food processor, since the pieces are less uniform).",
      "Melt the butter -- I typically do this in the microwave rather than on the stove, but I have limited storage and few pots and pans. In a small bowl add the crushed wafers, the sugar, cardamom and salt. Add the melted butter and stir to combine. Transfer to the baking sheet, and toast in the oven until brown and fragrant, 12 to 15 minutes. Let cool and sprinkle the topping on the pudding. It makes a lot, but I love a good crunchy coating."

Roll the square into a mini scroll again, and tuck both sides under to turn into a ball. The \"seams\"/where the folds meet, may not stick together because of the dusted flour, so dab your finger with some honey water and gently pinch them together until they stick.

Dab your fingers in honey water again and press the dough-ball out into a flat disk (the honey water will help the dough stick to the parchment which makes the spreading easier, and it also prevent the dough from sticking to your fingers). Repeat with the rest (no need for too much room in between each shao-bing). Then generously brush the top of each bing with honey water (like you would with egg wash), and sprinkle with a pinch of ground black pepper, and cover the top with toasted white sesame seeds.",

To keep it from drying out, I cover the phyllo dough I'm not working with at the moment with a sheet of plastic wrap and then a barely damp dish towel.\r\n\r\n- If you overfill your pastries, they will burst in the oven. The key is to only use one tablespoon of filling per pastry then to roll them loosely. Finally, when you turn the edges up, leave about 1/2 inch empty space on each side of the filling. Leaving a little extra room inside the pastry allows the egg filling to expand without leaking.\r\n\r\n- Egg whites (unlike yolks) freeze beautifully. If you want to use them later to make meringue, be sure to separate your eggs carefully and avoid getting any yolk in the whites. To thaw, place the frozen egg whites in the fridge overnight.\r\n\r\n- Like many Portuguese pastries, these are especially good straight out of the oven, served with an espresso.",
      "Combine the sugar and water in a medium saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Once the sugar is dissolved, do not stir the syrup. Cook until the syrup has thickened enough to come off a spoon in a thick stream. This should take about 8-10 minutes. If you want to be more precise, the syrup should read about 200\u00b0F on an instant-read thermometer. Set aside to cool for a minute or two.",
      "While the syrup is cooling, place your yolks in a large bowl. Whisk to combine then slowly drizzle in a very thin stream of the hot syrup, whisking constantly. The idea is to temper your eggs, or gradually heat them enough to add them to the hot liquid without scrambling them. Continue to gradually add the syrup while whisking vigorously. The more your eggs warm up, the faster you can add the syrup. When you've added all the syrup, transfer the egg mixture back to the saucepan and place over medium-low heat. Cook, stirring or whisking constantly until the mixture is thick and creamy and resembles sabayon or lemon curd. Whisking is faster and yields a fluffier result, so that's the method I prefer. Either way, be sure to occasionally scrape the bottom and corners of the pan with a flexible, heat-proof spatula to make sure there's no egg scorching going on down there.",
      "Remove from the heat and strain the egg mixture through a medium-mesh sieve into a medium bowl (the sieve will remove any little bits of hard-cooked egg and make sure your filling is smooth). Place a sheet of plastic wrap directly on the surface of the egg custard (to prevent a skin from forming) and refrigerate until set, at least 2 hours and up to 2 days.",
      "When you're ready to assemble and bake the pasteis, preheat your oven to 400\u00b0F.",
      "Stack two sheets of phyllo on a large, clean work surface. Fold the stacked sheets in half widthwise (short end to short end) and cut along the fold with sharp knife. Stack the four sheets of phyllo on top of each other, fold widthwise and cut along the fold again. You will now have eight rectangles of phyllo dough measuring roughly 7x9 inches. Place six of the sheets under your towel with the rest of the phyllo and leave two on your work surface.",
      "Using a pastry brush, lightly butter the first rectangle of phyllo. Place the second sheet directly on top and lightly butter as well. Position the phyllo sheets so one of the long edges is closest to you, then place one tablespoon of the chilled egg filling in the middle of this long edge, about 3/4 inch in from the edge. Loosely fold the phyllo over the filling to create a sort of flat tube (it will puff as it cooks). Use your fingers to make an indentation on both sides of the filling, leaving about 1/2 inch room for the filling to expand within the tube. Brush the top of the pastry with butter, fold the ends up, pinching the seam gently so they won't open in the oven and butter the ends you've just folded up. Place on a parchment-lined sheet pan and repeat with the rest of the phyllo and filling.",
      "Bake the pasteis for 12-14 minutes, until they have puffed and the tops are golden brown. Cool slightly before sprinkling with powdered sugar. The pasteis can be served warm or at room temperature."

Pour the reduced liquid into a 8X8 pan and cool at room temperature. You can skim the fat at this point, or you can wait until it has cooled in the fridge.

Once a ball of dough forms, begin kneading and continue working the dough for about 10-15 minutes. I'm pretty sure you could use a Kitchenaid mixer with the dough hook attachment on low speed here up to a certain point, but after 8-10 minutes in, I would take the dough out and knead it by hand. You want a super-smooth (think play-dough) ball of dough by the end. Set aside, cover with a damp cloth, and let rest for about 20 minutes. Once dough has rested, roll out into a log that is about 1 inch in diameter, and cut into gnocchi-sized pieces, about 1 inch. Roll each into a little ball, and working one-by-one, roll each out into a flat, round wrapper, making sure there are no small holes or tears in the dough. It is helpful if you have an Asian rolling pin (found on Amazon) here because you can make the edge thinner than the middle of the wrapper. This is helpful upon assembly because you won't have a doughy mass at the top of your dumpling because when assembled, all the pleats will come together at the top and if it's too thick, the dumpling will be dough-overload.Place on a plate and cover with a damp cloth while you're rolling the others.",

To pleat, using your thumb and pointer finger, pinch the edge and bring a small section up and around the pork filling. Continue doing this until the filling is fully enveloped with wrapper. There should be 16-20 pleats per dumpling. Twist and gently pinch the top where all the pleats come together. There are youTube videos that show you how to do this if you're a visual learner.",

Place steaming basket in a wok with about 2 cups of water and steam for 8 minutes. Serve immediately with black vinegar mixed with minced ginger, soy sauce, and/or chili sauce. Flavor combinations are endless. Also, serve with chopsticks and a spoon because the soup with spill out of the dumpling, into the spoon with the vinegar and chili, and that's a perfect encore to the perfect bite."

When cool enough to handle, roll tightly into a towel to soak out as much moisture as possible. Coarsely chop and set aside.",
      "To make the couscous, bring 1 1/2 cups of chicken broth to boil with 1 smashed, peeled garlic clove, lemon zest from 1/2 lemon, 1 Tablespoon of olive oil and 1 teaspoon of salt. When it's all boiling, add 1 cup of dry couscous, remove from the heat, cover and wait 10 minutes. Fluff and measure out 1 cup and place in a large bowl you will use for the stuffing.",

Lightly whisk the egg and add to the stuffing and mix well again. Adjust for salt and pepper. Set aside while prepping the chicken.",
      "Chickens can contain a lot of water from the process used to pluck them, so I always salt the chicken the night before I'm going to roast it and lightly wrap it in the refrigerator. If you don't do this the night before, do it anyway as much before roasting time as possible. It results in a more tender chicken with a crispier skin every time.",
      "Preheat the oven to 400F. You can either flatten the chicken for roasting by cutting out the backbone and then forceably flattening the chicken or roast it as is. I find the stuffing will stay under th skin better if I flatten it, I'll get a more even crispy skin, and can to shorten the roasting time, and the overall flavor doesn't seem to be affected.",
      "Loosen the skin in the area of the breasts, legs and thighs for inserting the stuffing. Gently push the stuffing under the skin, moving it gently around by massaging the skin. If you don't use all the stuffing, you can cook it separately in a small pan in the oven and add it to the chicken later in serving.",
      "Once the chicken is stuffed, spread olive oil on the skin and salt and pepper. Squeeze lemon juice at the end, and assuming you didn't flatten the chicken, place the squeezed lemon inside the cavity of the chicken along with the used lemon slices you used for making the stuffing.",
      "Roast for about 1 hour 15 minutes, or until the meat thermometer reads about 165-170F in the breast. If you cook it any longer than that, the moistness of the stuffing will prevent it from tasting too dry, but the texture will not be as appealing. If the skin gets too dark and crispy, just place some foil over the top. We like our skin pretty crispy, but that's a personal perference.",
      "Let sit for 10 minutes to collect and distribute the juices before carving.",
      "Thanks to the stuffing, you need only serve a salad or some asparagus on the side to complete the meal. I've added different pictures showing how it looks whole, carved up and on the plate since each looks so different. Enjoy!!!"

      "Slowly -and I mean really slowly- add water until a dough forms. Use your hands to gently combine everything in the bowl. If you over-water it, add more flour.",
      "Flour a work surface and turn out what will hopefully be a slightly sticky, but still springy ball of dough. Knead very gently. Love on the dough until is is no longer sticky, but quite springy and resilient when you push a finger into it.",
      "Cover the ball lightly in plastic wrap or a clean towel and walk away for 20 minutes to let the dough proof and texture to develop.",
      "Roll out the dough into a uniform circle with a floured pin, about an inch or inch and a half thick. Portion the dough evenly and roll into equal size balls. Knead the dough balls gently again for about a minute each. Roll in flour and place in the mixing bowl. Cover and walk away for another fifteen to twenty minutes. This gives each individual tortilla (or the testales, I believe they're called) a chance to proof up individually. Most recipes only proof the dough once, after it has been rolled out into balls. The double proof method here makes for some remarkably tender, melt in your mouth tortillas, and very crisp tortilla chips in my experience.",
      "Heat your largest skillet (I like cast-iron for this, or should you have a large comal, use that, and high-five!) to medium-high heat. There's enough fat in the tortillas, so use a dry skillet.",
      "Roll each of the balls out until to one eighth of an inch thick and roughly ten to twelve inches in diameter. To help in the cooking, I like to prick them with a fork several times like you would a pastry dough.",
      "Let's cook these bad boys!!! Like pancakes, your first tortilla is probably going to be over-cooked, under-cooked, fall apart, catch fire, be implicated in an international incident... Watever. Don't be discouraged. Move on.",
      "The tortillas will tell you when they're ready to be turned because you will see gas-pockets form on the top. When they're done they will be flexible, and stretchy, but not fall apart when you pull on them a bit. Taste the first one that looks edible to make sure you have the cooking times right and keep moving. The tortilla should be bendy and tender, but not mealy or floury-tasting.",
      "Keep the process moving. Store the cooked tortillas on a paper towel lined, plates warmed in the oven. Cover with a paper towel and another warmed plate; put the finished product in a tortilla keeper, or serve immediately."

Using a pastry brush, brush the bread with the melted butter, put a teaspoon of the mushroom filling along the edge of the bread and roll up. Place on a tray with the seam side down. Brush the outside of blintz with melted butter. Continue this process with the rest of the bread. Refrigerate the tray for 2 hours. Then cut the blintzes in half. At this point you can place them back on the tray and when frozen store in a plastic bag. To bake the bread blintzes, simply assemble on baking tray and bake in 350 oven for 10-15 minutes or till golden brown."

    "directions": [
      "Place the beans in a large, deep bowl and cover them with enough water to submerge them by 3 to 4 inches. Allow them to soak overnight.",
      "Drain and rinse the beans. Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a Dutch oven or a large pot over medium heat. Add the onion and celery. Saute for 5 to 7 minutes, or until the onion is soft and clear. Add the garlic, and cook for another 2 to 3 minutes, or until the garlic is sweetly fragrant, adding a few tablespoons of water as needed to prevent everything from sticking.",
      "Preheat your oven to 400\u00b0 F.",
      "Add the beans and the bay leaves to the pot. Add enough water to cover the beans by about 1 1/2 inches. Cover and simmer for a total of about 50 minutes, or until the beans are absolutely tender and creamy. Fifteen minutes before you remove the beans from heat, remove the lid and allow the beans to finish cooking uncovered.",
      "While your beans cook, drizzle the whole garlic head with enough olive oil to coat the cloves. Wrap it in foil and place on a baking sheet. Roast for 35 to 40 minutes, or until the cloves are golden and very soft when you unwrap the garlic. Set it aside.",
      "When the beans have finished simmering, skim off any extra liquid, so that they're not too soupy (keep in mind that they will thicken up quite a bit as they sit, and especially as you store the leftovers). Stir in the salt, pepper, thyme, and the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil. Check the seasonings and add a little more salt if needed. Then, one by one, pop the roasted garlic cloves into the beans, using as much of the whole head of garlic as you can. Use a potato masher or the back of a heavy spoon to mash the beans up a bit-you want many of them to retain their shape but for the mixture to be spreadable.",
      "Scoop the beans onto toast and drizzle them with extra olive oil and a sprinkle of sea salt and pepper, if desired. Leftover beans can be stored in the fridge for up to 4 days, and frozen for up to one month in an airtight container."

If you have hazelnuts with skins, toast them gently in the oven until warm and fragrant then rub them in a tea towel to remove the skins -- or, less messy, put them in a plastic bag and shake (the static helps capture the skins and you get much the same result). You don't need to be perfect, but the skins will add a bit of flecked color to the cookies, which is lovely too. Once completely cool, blitz the hazelnuts in a food processor until it resembles sand.",

Combine the hazelnut meal, cubed butter, sugar and flour in a bowl and rub with fingers until it resembles breadcrumbs (or use a food processor), then knead until it just comes together into a dough. Flatten to a disc about an inch high and place in the fridge, preferably leaving overnight if you can or at least an hour if you're in a rush.",

They will be very lightly baked and extremely fragile at this point, but you do not want them to brown or melt into a puddle so watch them carefully during this time and if they seem to be cooking too quickly, remove them from the oven or turn the temperature down. Let cool completely before even touching them as they are very fragile. Once cool, they harden enough to handle.",
      "Place the dark chocolate over a double broiler and let it melt about 75 percent. Take off the heat and stir to melt the rest of the chocolate and let it cool about 5 minutes or until it reaches a consistency where it can be spooned onto a cookie without dribbling off the sides. Place a teaspoon of the chocolate on the bottom of half of the cookies and before the chocolate sets (but not too early as it will spill and slide!) place the other hemisphere of cookie on top and leave to set. Store in an air tight container. These are even better a couple of days after baking."

Here in Rome, for instance, it takes 14 minutes.\r\nRinse the rice in cold water in a sieve to get some of the starch off.\r\nPut the rice in a pan with a tight-fitting lid and cover with water the width of your thumb above the top of the rice. Put this on a medium to low flame and put the lid on.\r\nSet the timer to 14 mins (in my case) and make sure it doesn't overflow when the water comes to the boil (otherwise you have a hard time calculating how much more water to add, how hot for how long , etc.).\r\nAs soon as the timer pings turn off the flame but leave the lid on to let the rice steam a little longer.\r\nAfter five minutes take off the lid and separate the grains with a fork, perhaps stirring in a drop or two of olive oil",
      "In a pan that is big enough to hold the whole octopus and the whole onion together with the lid fitting tight, place these two items.\r\nPut the pan over a medium flame.\r\n\r\nThis is the scary bit as it seems as though the octopus will burn without any oil or liquid but in fact it starts to pour out its own liquid, as well as the onion, and starts to cook in it.\r\nYou do have to watch this process (although the first time I didn't very well and it almost dried out) to make sure the liquid doesn't ever completely evaporate, so keep peeping in under the lid and regulate the temperature accordingly",
      "After about 40/45 minutes the octopus should feel tender and be cut easily and the onion will have practically melted away into the liquid at the bottom of the pan.
