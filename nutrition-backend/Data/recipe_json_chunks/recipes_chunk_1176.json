[I don't really add a teaspoon of water but I wasn't allowed to post a recipe with only one ingredient! LOL] There will be a little bit of broth in the pot that is good on rice or other starch or can be frozen as chicken stock. When cooking frozen food in a crockpot, do NOT preheat the pot. Put the food in and then turn on the heat. Note: My crockpot has the heating element that wraps around the sides of the pot; if yours is large and has the element on the bottom, you should probably place the chicken breast side up.",
      "You can make good broth from this too. After removing the meat, put the bones and skin and any giblets back in the crockpot, cover with water, add about 2T soy sauce, a little black or red pepper, and (optional) some onion, carrot, celery cut in half and 1-2T vinegar. Cook on low for 36 hours, strain. This was so good that I didn't make soup, I just drank it as bouillon. Would be great for aspic too as it is full of gelatin."

      "Sauce -- Add the white wine to deglaze the pan and scrape up any bits. Cook another minute to reduce the wine. Reduce the heat to medium and add in the tomatoes, artichoke hearts and cream, stir well to combine. Season with salt and pepper; go easy on the salt. Nothing more is needed.",
      "Simmer -- Just simmer on medium / medium low and let the sauce reduce. It will take about 10 minutes to slightly thicken. Remember this is not a THICK sauce or gravy.",
      "Serve -- Spoon the sauce over grilled pork, chicken or lamb. This is excellent over rice, pasta (I love orzo for this), couscous and even butter noodles. This is even excellent over a baked potato topped with feta cheese. Fresh basil makes a nice garnish if you want. ENJOY!"

If you have any slices of eggplant left over once you have made your rolls, chop them roughly and add them to the sauce in step 6. If you have filling left over, use it to stuff another vegetable: a tomato or mushroom would be ideal. Refrigerate until you have time to deal with it!",

Wash,dry and finely shred the spinach, then add to the pan in step 2 with the onion, and heat until wilted. Or for a quicker version of this, use a thawed and thoroughly squeeze-dried packet of frozen spinach. And add a pinch of nutmeg, cumin or cinnamon."

      "start by blending your flour, salt and sugar with a wisk in a large bowl, blend well for about one minute. in a measuring cup ad your yeast and a half cup of (a little warmer than) luke warm water (not hot) stir, cover for 2 minutes. Add one cup of (a little warmer than) luke warm water to your yeast mixture, cover. Make a well in your flour mixture add yeast and water mix. Cover the bowl with a warm damp cloth and a kitchen towel set aside for 10 minutes. When the bubbles in the water are showing that lets you know your yeast is working so now its time to start mixing. With a spatula ( i like to use plastic, it seems to stick less) start blending the flour mix with the water until a very sticky dough forms. prepare a cutting board for kneeding by dusting it with flour. dump your stick dough onto the board. dust your hands and start kneeding the dough for about ten minutes. ( i like to press my dough into a pizza shape and fold it press again fold, stretch etc. for about the first five minutes then i start a traditional kneeding action).",
      "once a smooth texture is there ( carefull not to dry out your dough to much with flour) shape a round ball and coat with about 2 table spoons of EVVO.",
      "Line a large bowl with wax paper and spray with non stick cooking spray, place dough in to rise. Cover with the same warm damp cloth and kitchen towel and place in room temperature for 1 1/2 hours ( up to 3 hours) for first rise.",
      "Once the dough has doubled in size prepare your cutting board with wax paper coated with cooking spray. Remove dough from bowl onto prepared board. using your hands, ( not a knife) pull apart into two pieces, shape loaves. ( i like to make the loaves about 8 - 10 inches long and about 4 inches withe but this is not really important, sometimes i braid them too!)",
      "OK, now place another piece of wax paper sprayed with cooking spray over the top of both loaves cover with a towel and place in room temp for 1 hour ( second rise). Now its time to prepare your oven. Pre heat oven to 425. cover your baking stone with about 1/4 cup of corn meal and place in the oven on middle rack. On a lower rack place pan with about 1 cup of water ( this keeps your crust from getting brown to quick) You want your baking stone to be really hot when its time to put the bread inches Once your hour is up your bread will have grown a bit ;) so remove your towels and wax paper with one hand ( im right handed) my left i place it gently on one loaf. using my right hand i take the wax paper and turn the loaf upside down into my left hand being carefull not to disturb the shape and air in my loaf. open the oven pull out your rack with the baking stone and place your loaf directly onto your cornmeal. close oven. set timer for 10 minutes. after 10 minutes turn down oven to 400 and bake for 20 more minutes. Watch that your crust isnt getting to brown (i like mine golden brown, think of the color of honey :) ) IF your crust is how you like it cover with a double fold of foil just over the top. turn oven off and let stand in oven for 5 more minutes. Remove to cooling rack. Slice after 10 minutes and serve. Repeat baking process with second loaf.",

      "Tips: If done in a 2+ quart microwavable casserole with a lid, you can go from start to table really quickly, easily, and with minimal cleanup. To speed things up even further, make your sauces and prep your fruit while your rice is soaking/cooking. Be sure to use glutinous rice, which can be found at Asian markets. It will be labeled \"glutinous rice\" and/or \"sweet rice\". Good ripe mangoes are a MUST, so be sure you can find them first, before you go any further.",
      "Soak raw rice in plenty of water for 30 minutes. Rinse the rice by stirring it with your fingers, draining, and refilling with water. Stir-drain-refill a couple or three times, then finally drain most of the water away until the rice is covered by about a quarter inch of water. Microwave on high, covered, for ten minutes.",
      "Shake a 13.5 ounce can of coconut milk well before opening then divide in half: pour one half into a bowl or tall glass to make the rice sauce, and keep the other half in the can to make the cream sauce. Or the other way 'round, it doesn't matter :-).",
      "Rice sauce: Stir a cup of sugar and pinch of salt into the coconut milk until dissolved. Pour *most* of the mixture over the cooked rice and stir gently but thoroughly to blend (I feel that this makes a little too much sauce so I use about 3/4 of it and discard the remainder.) The rice/sauce mixture will be soupy while hot but will firm up well once cooled. If you want to add mango chunks to the whole dish, now is the time to stir them inches If you want to make individual serving cups, set them up now and chill to firm.",
      "Cream sauce: Stir the corn starch, salt, and sugar into the other half can of coconut milk. Heat in a sauce pan, uncovered, on the stove top until bubbling, stirring frequently to avoid scorching.",
      "Serving notes: This makes a glorious platter with the fruit arranged around a big mound of rice with the cream sauce drizzled over the top, or you can fancy it up by presenting individual dishes. If I'm making this for a party I serve it in the same covered casserole dish that I cooked it in, stirring the mango chunks into the rice and offering the cream sauce on the side. That way everyone gets plenty of mango and sauce instead of just the first guests. However you choose to serve it, it's a hit."
