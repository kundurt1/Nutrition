Add the dissolved yeast and beat for about 2 minutes on medium-high speed, until the dough is well combined and holds together. Add the cubed butter and mix for another 5 to 7 minutes, until the dough no longer sticks to the side of the mixing bowl. If the dough is overly sticky, you may need to add about 1 tablespoon of flour. It is usually necessary to scrape down the side of the bowl with a rub",

Cut the dough into circles with a 1 1/2-inch diameter cutter, keeping the cuts as close together as possible. Pat any leftover dough into a rectangle and cut more circles out of it. (At this stage, the Bombolini can be frozen for up to 1 week if well wrapped in plastic wrap. Allow the Bombolini to defrost in the refrigerator before proofing.)",

If using a saucepan, check the temperature with a candy thermometer. Fry 5 to 7 Bomboloni at one time, any more than that and the oil temperature will dip down too much and they will not fry evenly. Fry for a total of 3 to 5 minutes, until they are golden brown. Turn to evenly fry each side. As they fry, they will increase in size. Remove the Bomboloni with a large slotted spoon and set on a paper towel to drain the excess oil.",
      "While the Bomboloni are still warm, roll them in a bowl filled with granulated sugar until evenly coated. If desired, fill the Bomboloni with a jam-filled pastry bag fitted with a 1/4-inch plain tip. Use a sharp paring knife to make a small hole on the bottom of each Bomboloni. Place the tip of the pastry bag in the hole and squeeze until the Bomboloni feels heavy. It is best to fill the Bomboloni while they are still warm and the dough soft and pliable.",

Cover your sushi mat with plastic wrap and lay one piece of seaweed (flat side down) on top of the plastic wrap.

Smooth the rice down so it's level across but don't smash or break the rice.",

(If making the vegetable, add enough vegetables to line across, using only 1 or 1 /2 asparagus, if making tuna, use half of the prepared spicy tuna.) Be careful to not overfill. Grab the sushi mat from the end and roll. Use your fingertips to make sure you're rolling tight. Make sure not to roll the sushi mat into the sushi. When finished rolling and you have a tight roll, with the plastic wrap around the roll, wrap the roll in the sushi mat and squeeze to make sure the roll is completely tight.

A metal bowl can react with the acid in the tomatoes and make them taste tinny, and a plastic bowl will absorb the liquid smoke, a flavor you don't want in every dish that next touches that bowl.\nFor the candied nuts, pecans can be substituted.\nMake sure to watch the walnuts while baking. Walnuts can go from being nicely browned to burnt in a blink of an eye. Believe me, I've done it a time or two. Watch these bad boys closely and keep your nose on high alert."

Fill a large pot with cold water and wash your potatoes there from all the excess starch. \n\nFill your pot with again with cold water and add sea salt and a knob of butter and your peeled potatoes. Leave them for high heat and when the water start to boil let them boil for additional 15 - 20 minutes (depends on their size).",
      "On a plate or in a bowl place your slices of your chicken breast and season with white pepper, garlic granules, sea sat and add your oil. Mix it all well to distribute the seasoning evenly. Set is aside for the time you will be ready to fry them in the pan. \n\nNow it is time to cut your onion. Slice them into thin slices and be prepared to shed some tears;) We love them so we use 2 onions per adult. Cut your chilli pepper as well if you will be using it and set it aside.",
      "Hat a pan on medium/high heat and pan fry your turkey breasts from both sides\nuntil cooked well trough (I like it just done and juicy and my better half likes it more crispy and very well done - so make it as it is perfect for you).\n\nYour potatoes should be ready soon. When they are ready (check it that you stick a knife in the largest of them and if it easily slides down that is a sign that they are ready). Drain your potatoes from all water and then add a knob of butter and \nPut a lid or a plate on top so the hot steam will melt the butter. Set the pot aside for later.",
      "Now in the pan what you used to fry your turkey breast add some additional oil and you chilli (if you will use it) and set your pan on medium/high heat. If your family really likes the taste of the maggi (mine does) you can add a half of a maggi cube (I use organic or 25%less salt and no msg ones) and let it dissolve in the oil (make it quick so it does not burn and add immediately your onions and season with a pinch of white pepper and garlic granules. If you do not use a maggi cube season with salt, white pepper, garlic granules and sea salt. Stir well. \nYour onions should be ready in about 5-7 minutes. They will become soft and get a light brown colour.",
      "Now it is time to serve all your food on the plate and give to your loved ones. \n\nAdd some sauce to dip the turkey and potatoes in like ketchup, mayonnaise, chilli sauce, salad cream or tartar sauce (recipe inside the blog). \n\nEnjoy."

Holding the lobe of fruit in the palm of your hand, VERY CAREFULLY, score lines one way then the other into the flesh creating x's all through; cutting down to but not through the skin. Scoop out the cut flesh with a spoon, into a bowl, so that the chunks and any juice fall into the bowl.",

      "Begin adding the warm sweetened coconut milk, ladle-full by ladle-full, continuing to cook on medium-low heat and stirring (GENTLY) constantly. The rice will begin to soften and when you run out of coconut milk, pour some warm water into the same saucepot and ladle that in to finish the rice cooking process. You want the risotto to be al dente but not crunchy.",

      "Don't you just love baked brie? I make mine either in puff pastry (but find it's too heavy these days )& also in a phyllo wrap. Here's how I do it: Remove all the wrapping from a whole brie and cut off about 1/8\" off the top, leaving a smooth surface of brie without the rind. Then cut off the edges. Turn brie upside down and remove the rest of the rind. You now have a naked brie. Cover with plastic wrap and set aside. Melt a stick of butter and set aside. Place 1 sheet of phyllo on a flat surface with the long end in front of you.",
      "Butter the sheet. Place another sheet of phyllo on top of the first sheet, overlapping half of the first sheet. You now have 1-1/2 widths of phyllo in front of you. Butter that sheet, but positioned over the first sheet. Place a fourth sheet over the third sheet, but positioned directly over the second sheet.",
      "You now have 4 sheets of phyllo. You have a double thickness of phyllo, 1-1/2 times the original width.",
      "Now do the same thing with the height, placing the 5th sheet of phyllo.....I guess you get the idea. Don't worry that the middle is thicker. It's going to support the weight of the brie. When you've used 8 sheets of phyllo, give it another brush with butter, place the brie in the center of the buttered phyllo pile. If you want to add something on top of the brie, now is the time to do it. I sometimes spread the top with pesto and sprinkle the pesto layer with pignoli nuts. Another idea is to make a paste of sun dried tomatoes and cured black olives and spread that on top of the brie. You could also leave it plain, but the topping do add a wonderful flavor. Now to wrap-it's done just like a package.",
      "Flip the wrapped brie over, brush with butter and place on a cookie sheet. Bake in a preheated 375 oven until the phyllo is puffed and golden brown. The brie inside will have melted. Cut into wedges & serve."

Mix to combine.\nAdd in the all purpose flour 1/4 cup at a time, letting the flour mix in before adding in the next 1/4 cup. The dough should be soft, come away from the sides, but not be sticky. This should take about 5-8 minutes.\nForm the dough into a ball and place back in the mixing bowl, brush with some extra coconut oil and allow to rise for 1 - 1 1/2 hours.",

Spread on the date mixture, leaving about an inch border on the edges. Spread the mixture fairly thin (it is thick but has a tendency to ooze a bit.)\nRoll the edge closest to you and roll away, forming a log. Tuck the ends of the log under and be sure to pinch the seam running along the length of the dough.\nCut the rolls into 8 equal pieces - I cut the log in half, cut those sections in half, and cut again.\nPut the rolls in a lightly oiled pan, cover with wrap and put in the refrigerator to rise overnight.

Warm the egg white mixture over a small pan of simmering water, but don't let the bottom of the mixing bowl touch the water. When the egg whites are just warm to the touch, wipe the bottom of the bowl to dry it, and then place the mixing bowl back on the stand mixer.

Bake the pan on the bottom rack until the top forms a crust but still feels a bit \"wiggly,\" about 5 minutes longer. Transfer the bottom pan to a rack to cool.

Cool the second pan on a rack, and then turn half of the circles upside down, matching up halves.",

Using a heatproof spatula, stir just until the chocolate is melted. Remove from the heat and stir until smooth and shiny. Let cool until barely warm, but still spreadable.",
      "Use a small spoon to dab about a 1/2 teaspoon of filling onto each circle that is turned upside down. Sprinkle a smidgen of flake sea salt on top of the ganache. Top with a second circle to sandwich each macaron. The filling should spread to the edge with oozing out. (It is best to test one to get a sense of how much ganache filling to add.) Chill the macarons until set. Before serving, lightly dust with cocoa powder, if desired. Transfer the macarons to an airtight container and store in the refrigerator for up to one week."
