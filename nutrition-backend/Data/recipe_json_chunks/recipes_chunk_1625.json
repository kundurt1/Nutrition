      "Pour 1/4 cup of batter into the pan and tilt it to swirl the batter around until it coats the pan. Your first crepe is always going to be experimental. The fresh butter might make it a little clumpy or bubbly and it might not cover the pan properly--don't worry, you'll get into the swing of things after 1-2 tries.",
      "Cook for about one minute or so. Use a spatula to lift an edge--if it's slightly golden, it's time to flip. Once you flip, cook for another 45 seconds or so. The amount of time that you cook the galette depends on many factors: your stove, the type of pan you're using, how thick the batter is, etc. You might also need to adjust the temperature--my crepe pans work best on medium-high heat, but this might be too high for your stove and could burn the crepes. Start with medium heat and increase or decrease, depending on how long the crepes are cooking for. My best advice is to lightly lift the edge of the galette to see if it's starting to change color before flipping. The edges will usually be slightly crisped.",
      "I usually make about 2-3 galettes before using my silicone brush to add a little more butter to the pan. I like to use the brush because it guarantees even coverage and never creates big clumps of butter that cause the batter to curl in places. The galettes should peel off the pan easily.",
      "To keep the galettes warm as you cook more, here's a trick: set a big pot of water on a nearby skillet. Top with a large plate and bring to a boil. Place the done galettes on the plate--the boiling water underneath keeps the plate warm.",
      "So, considering this recipe makes about 10 galettes--that means two people could each eat 4 galettes on their own (or with a swipe of jam or Nutella and some berries on the side) and each have a galette topped with an egg.",
      "When you're done making all of the galettees, place one back onto your crepe pan. Carefully crack one egg into the center. Use a fork to sort of spread the egg whites around the entire galette (but be careful to not disturb the yolk!). Salt and pepper. At this time, you could also throw in some cheese--shaved Parmesan, or maybe some Gruyere. When the whites have thickened and are universally white, use a spatula to lift the sides of the crepes and gently fold over as you would an envelope, but leave a nice center hole for the yolk. Slide your spatula under and place on a plate."

Starting at the end with the filling, roll the pasta into a cylinder. Then press down on either side of the pasta filling to seal the pasta. Pinch the sides so you make the pasta into the shape of a candy wrapper.",

Beat in the eggs, 1 at a time, scraping the sides of the bowl after each addition.\n\nReduce the mixer speed to low and add the dry ingredients in 3 batches, alternately with the cream mixture in 2 batches. Scrape down the sides of the bowl. Raise the mixer speed to medium-high and beat for 1 minute to aerate.\n\nDivide the batter evenly among the muffin cups. Bake until the centers spring back when pressed lightly with a fingertip, about 20 minutes. Let the cupcakes cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack and let cool completely.\n\nUsing a paring knife, cut a 1 1/2-inch-wide cone-shaped core halfway down into the center of each cupcake; gently remove the cores and set aside. Fill each cupcake with about 1 Tbs. of the passion fruit curd and replace the cores.\n\nFrost the cupcakes with the coconut frosting. Let",

      "Boil the potatoes until tender. Meanwhile take a large bowl and put inside chickpeas flour. Gently combine adding water a bit at a time, 4 tablespoons of oil and half a teaspoon of sea salt. Whisk until you get a smooth, lumpless batter. Let it rests for half an hour at least.",
      "Clean and rinse the asparagus. Remove the white stalks. Bring to a boil enough water (add salt) to simmer the vegetables for five minutes.",
      "After the rest, take the chickpeas batter and a non-sticking pan (ours was a 15 cm square one). Brush the bottom of the pan with some drops of oil. Pour the batter in the hot pan (temperature must be high). We used 1/4 cup batter for each crepe (60 grams). The crepe starts to bubble up (see image above, right). When the bubbles come wider (picture above, on the left) turn the crepe upside down, gently. Cook two minutes per side or until the crepe easily comes off. Repeat for 16 times. Mix the batter very well before picking up a new cup.",
      "When you have got all of the crepes, divide each asparagus in two parts. Set aside the upper parts of the asparagus for later. Place the lower parts of the asparagus in the food processor glass, together with boiled potatoes, 4 tablespoons of olive oil and a couple of pinches of salt. Process until you get a creamy texture. It should be better not to put the potatoes in the blender, as they get gluey. If you have enough time, mash the potatoes and blend the asparagus separately. Then combine everything.",
      "Spread a couple of tablespoon of potatoes-asparagus puree on each crepe. Lay down two asparagus tips on the puree. Season with a drizzle of oil, freshly ground black pepper and grated Parmigiano cheese (or other cheese to your taste). Fold the crepe and place it into a greased bake tin.",
      "Sprinkle grated parmesan on the crepes surface. Add a drizzle of oil. Bake in preheated oven to 200\u00b0C for 10 to 15 minutes, until the parmesan gets brown. Meanwhile make the sauces: surely it has some potatoes-asparagus puree left (we arranged for this by giving you bigger quantity in the list of ingredients!). Take a hand blender. Place the puree in the glass of the blender; add 4 tablespoons of olive oil and squeeze half a lemon. Process until you get a kind of vegetable mayonnaise. If you want a more liquid texture, add more oil or a bit of water: taste it and make as you like for better."

Rub some ghee to the palm of your hands. When the mixture is still hot, take some in your palm. Roll into 1 inch diameter ball. If the mixture gets cold, heat again to make the rolling easier.

      "Remove from the heat and stir in the lemon juice, cinnamon and vanilla. Use a stick blender to puree the apple sauce then oven bake without a lid for 2.5 hours, stirring every half hour. The apple sauce is ready when it's as thick as tomato ketchup. Leave to cool then transfer into a lidded container and store in the fridge. (The sauce keeps for 4 days so you can make it ahead).",
      "Measure the flour into a bowl and make a well in the middle. Crack the eggs into the well and add about a quarter of the milk. Whisk well with a handheld whisk until the batter is smooth and thick. Add the rest of the milk in thirds, whisking well after each addition. Add the water and melted butter, whisk well, cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes or up to 2 hours. (This stage is important as it makes the pancakes tenderer).",
      "Heat 1/2 tsp of oil in a non-stick frying pan (approx. 28cm wide) on a very high heat. Don't be tempted to add more oil as it deep fries the edges making them thicker and rubbery. Hold the hot frying pan away from the heat then take a ladle (or use a jug) to pour just enough pancake batter into the frying pan to thinly cover the base. Tilt the pan to help the batter run over the base of the frying pan. The first one will always be a bit thicker than the rest - it's a learning process to see just how much batter you need to spoon in.",
      "Place the frying pan back on the heat and wait until the edges start to curl and the centre shows large bubbles - this takes about 40 - 60 seconds. Then shake the pan a little to see if the pancake comes loose. If it doesn't use a slice or palate knife to loosen the edges, then flip the pancake over using a slice. (Or you can try tossing them!) Fry the other side of the pancake back on the high heat for about 30 seconds, then slip the pancake onto a plate to cool.",
      "Add another 1/2 tsp of oil to the pan and repeat until all the pancake batter is used up. Add a layer of non-stick baking parchment between each pancake as you stack them - the mixture should make about 14. Leave to cool completely before assembling the cake.v",
      "To make the filling beat the cream cheese with an electric mixer or wooden spoon until smooth. Separately whisk the double cream and icing sugar to soft peaks. Stir 1 tbsp of whipped cream through the cream cheese to loosen it, then fold the rest of the whipped cream into the cream cheese with a metal spoon, using a slicing action.",

Stack a pancake on top and repeat until all 14 pancakes are stacked being careful not to press down on the 'cake' as you go. Finish the last pancake off with the cream and apple sauce then spoon over the cubed Bramley apple topping just before serving. Cut into wedges, just as you would a cake, to serve."

Empty the contents of the piping bag into the hog casing. Do not tie the other end of the casing until you have twisted the sausage into links; this will allow air to escape and allow you to better regulate the compression of the final sausages. Twist into sausages, alternating direction of twists to make 18 firm sausages. You must work quickly as the casing is porous and blood can slowly leak from within.",

When the sausages are sufficiently cool re- move from the liquid and refrigerate until ready to serve.",

Place under the broiler and allow the herbs to char, after 10 to 15 second, then remove the pan and turn and stir the herbs with a set of tongs, repeat as needed until the herbs are halfway charred.Once the herbs are nicely charred and the scallions are tender, remove the pan to cool.

If you've never cooked bacon before, why not try chopping up the slices and cooking in a skillet with a little bit of oil, over medium to high heat for about 10 minutes, or until you reach your preferred \"crispness\"! Drain the bacon and set aside for the time being. At this point you may decide to go ahead and preheat your oven to 350 degrees.",

About 1/2 C - 3/4 C of uncooked quinoa will yield 21/2 C cooked quinoa.\n\nIf you don't have a rice cooker, you can cook the quinoa on the stove-top, according to package directions.\n\nCalorie content for 4 large (approximately 1.5 C) servings is around 410 calories per serving. For 6 (approximately 1 C) small servings, the calorie count is about 270 calories per serving.\n\nUPDATE: If you do not have a cast iron or oven-safe skillet, after mixing in the quinoa, tomato paste, Cajun seasoning and tomato chunks in step 4, transfer the ingredients to a casserole dish and then top with the shrimp and fontina cheese.\nNutrition Information\nServing size: 1.5 C Calories: 410 Fat: 22g Carbohydrates: 32g Sugar: 1g Sodium: 331 Protein: 22g"

      "Add 1/2 a cup of stock , the sage leaves and tightly cover the casserole with its lid. Let the meat braise at low heat, turning meat over every 20 min. and adding stock whenever needed, until meat is very tender. Season with salt and fresh ground black pepper.",
      "Preparation Risotto:",
      "Step 1: Soffritto\nThe soffritto is the first essential step that gives a risotto its unique flavor. Lightly heated the oil (sunflower and olive oil mixed) in a casserole. Add the finely chopped onion and slowly sautee for at least ten minutes over a low heat. If you are not capable of sauteing do stir with a wooden spoon, adding a tablespoon of water, if necessary, to prevent burning.",
      "Step 2: Tostatura\nTo obtain rice that is perfectly \"al dente\", it must be lightly toasted to seal the grains of rice and close the pores. When the soffritto is ready, turn up the heat, pour the rice into the casserole and stir continuously. When the rice begins to stick lightly to the pan, lower the heat and add the first ladle of hot stock(meat stock). The stock should not be added all at once but, as my Grandmother used to say \"when the rice needs it,\" i.e. when the risotto has absorbed the liquid.",
      "Step 3: Cottura(cooking)\nRisotto needs a lot of attention: it requires constant adding of stock and stirring/sauteing so that the starch that is released does not let the rice grains stick together. Halfway through cooking, add the soaked dried Porcini mushrooms. I also use the water where the mushrooms have been soaked to give the risotto that extra mushroom's taste. Sprinkle the risotto with the chopped parsley. To know when the rice is \"al dente\", you have to try it from time to time, regardless of the instructions on the packet. Normally for Carnaroli rice, you will need approx. 20 minutes. Season with salt and fresh ground black pepper to your taste.",
      "Step 4: Mantecatura(whisking)\nEven if the name comes from the Spanish term for butter, \"manteca\", this stage indicates the need to add the right amount of fat to the cooked rice that will give it its distinctive shininess and adjust the flavor. Should you use Vialone Nano rice, add a little stock giving a \"wave-like\" (all'onda) consistency to the risotto.\nAfter adding the necessary fat and stirring/sauteing it thoroughly, add the grated Grana Padano stirring/sauteing again vigorously leaving the covered risotto to rest.",
