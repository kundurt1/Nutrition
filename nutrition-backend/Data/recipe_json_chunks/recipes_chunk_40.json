Meanwhile, chop carrot into 1/4 inch cubes, (slice 1/4 inch long ways, lay flat, then long ways again, then into cubes) and set aside. Take one cup frozen green peas out of bag, cover with hot water and let set. Check rice and set aside when done. Turn heat up on skillet to medium high. When temp. is reached, add rice to oil, onion, and garlic and spread in skillet. Pour in soy sauce, wine and pepper. Let temp. rise back to medium high while turning with flat spatula. In center of skillet, separate a hole in rice. Put eggs in center (yellows still whole). As eggs are cooking, chop with spatula, cutting yellows and whites, stirring only slightly (the eggs will be chunky). Gently mix eggs with rice, maintaining egg chunks. Rice and egg mixture should be semi-moist and begin sticking a little to skillet. Turn mixture with spatula (eggs should be cooking quickly). Turn heat off and let eggs complete cooking, turning as needed. Drain water from peas and pour peas in skillet. Add carrots and turn with spatula to mix all ingredients."
