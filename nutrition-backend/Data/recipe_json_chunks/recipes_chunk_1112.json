It might also be fun to try a splatter type pattern, just taking scoops and dropping them into the pan in a swirl motion (not stirring in the pan) or putting into cupcake form. The person who told me about this also mentioned that you can use 2 cake mixes for the round pans and then just use the leftover batter for extra cupcakes or something, but for my family I didn't need quite so much cake."

      "\"These products are not recommended for canning. Choose recipes that you can freeze. In fact, most of these products are not really \"canned.\" The directions call for baking in the jar and then closing with a canning lid. Many recipes for quick breads and cakes are low acid and have the potential for supporting the growth of bacteria like Clostridium botulinum if it is present inside the closed jar. You will see these products made commercially; however, additives, preservatives and processing controls not available for home recipes are used. Canning jar manufacturers also don't endorse baking in their canning jars."

      "There are two things truly necessary to make this very easy yet very impressive dessert pull together properly. First, the half & half (and coffee if you are using any) must be very hot, as it is what will melt all of the chocolate and cook the egg yolks. This is why measuring and assembling everything beforehand is your secret weapon. The other half of this temperature game is to have the egg yolks at room temperature. Frankly, I've always achieved this by putting the chocolate and egg yolks in the blender prior to putting the half & half on the stove, but if you would like to take extra precautions, set out your eggs beforehand for them to come to room temperature."

      "Cook's Note: I almost forgot to tell you-I used White Lily flour in this, which is a soft wheat flour. I like it for the delicate texture it adds. You may wonder why I mention it, but not all flours are created equal. Even among brands, there are differences, and it stems from the type of flour they use, which makes the protein count vary. Really high protein flours (often called bread flours) absorb a lot of water, and lower protein flours (cake flour is probably the lowest) absorb less. Each brand will use a different blend, and the one I used absorbs less on the whole, but is known, especially in the Southern US, for its excellence especially for making tender flaky biscuits. So this is why it may sometimes seem the water you add doesn't work right, on occasion. So in making dinner rolls, just as in bread, you start with an amount of water in the bowl, and you want to add flour, about a half cup at a time, until it comes together and forms the dough ball, coming away from the sides of the bowl. It shouldn't be as runny as cake batter or add more flour. It shouldn't be dry and crumbly or cracked, or you have added too much flour and need to add a little water and work it in until you get the dough ball. This is why you should never just dump all the flour in at once. I know most bread makers already know this, but there is always someone just finding out, and I got your back here.",

      "ALFREDO SAUCE: Melt margarine (I prefer using Becel) in a saucepan and add crushed garlic. Stir in milk, starting with a little to make certain there are no lumps, and then add the remainder. Stir until it begins to thicken and then add the cayenne pepper, cumin, onion powder and salt and pepper (If available I also add a teaspoons of Watkins Jalapeno Dip powder). Remove from heat; set aside.",
      "PIZZA DOUGH SECOND STEP: Stir in salt and oil to yeast mixture. Stir in 3/4 cup of flour, and then stir in 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour and ground flax seed and work into a ball. If the dough feels sticky, add a small amount of white flour; set aside.",
      "TOPPINGS STEP ONE: Saute' vegetables and diced cooked chicken in 1 tsp canola oil.",

      "TOPPINGS STEP TWO: Pour thickened sauce over dough, then sauteed vegetables and chicken. Add pineapple. Turn the outer edge of the pizza dough over the toppings (about 1/2 to 1 inch over). This will prevent the sauce from spilling into the oven and also will give the dough a stuffed effect. Mix the grated cheeses and put on top.",

To get even sized rolls, I cut the dough in half on a cutting board, then divide evenly again to 4 pieces, and once more to get 8 lumps of dough. I then form each piece into a log shape and cut 3 even bits of dough from each of 8 lumps (gets me my 24 and keeps them even sized).",
      "Forming each individual roll is an art you'll have to practice. I keep a small bowl of flour available to \"dip and flip\" each bit of dough into to make it easy to form. Take the bit of dough, form a circle with your fingers using the index finger and thumb, then with the other hand push the bit of dough up from the bottom through your finger circle, tightening it up so you have to force the dough through. This will stretch and smooth the ball. Repeat this several times, rotating the dough ball each time, then pinch the formed ball off at the bottom.",
      "If you're struggling with forming the rolls above, try flouring the dough bits well and then roll the dough bit around between your palms to form the ball. You can practice the other technique as you try the recipe a few times.",
