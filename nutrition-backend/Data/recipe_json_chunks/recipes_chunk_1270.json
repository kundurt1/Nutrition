The center will be the last to cook- it shouldn't be wiggly. Cool the cake on a wire rack. The top will collapse a bit- no worries. When the cake has cooled, cover and chill it at least two hours before serving. The longer the better. Chilling creates a dense fudgy cake.

Drain the dates, reserving the soaking water. Place the dates in a food processor fitted with the steel blade. Process until the paste is very smooth, with few discernible bits of date skin in the mix. You're looking for a texture and thickness sort of like an airy peanut butter or apple butter-the paste should be very smooth, move freely in the processor, and not cling to the sides of the bowl. If it appears a little chunky or sticky, add a bit of the soaking water, just a teaspoon at a time to avoid making it too runny. Ultimately, the paste should be a medium caramel color, spoonable, and hold its shape when you scoop some out. Use the paste immediately, or store it in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 10 days."

      "Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper and place a wire rack on the parchment. Set aside.",
      "Place the tempered chocolate in a warmed bowl. Following the directions for molding chocolate (see tips, below), carefully ladle the chocolate into the mold, taking care that the chocolate covers the entire mold. Turn the mold upside down over the bowl of tempered chocolate, allowing the excess chocolate to drip out, leaving just a thin coating on each indented cup. Tap the edge of the mold to release any air bubbles that might remain in the chocolate, to ensure a perfectly smooth coating. Wipe the edge of the mold clean on the edge of the bowl (you don't want to waste a drop of chocolate), then place the chocolate-coated mold, open side down, on the wire rack. A bit more chocolate will drip off. Let stand for about 4 minutes to allow the chocolate to begin to set.",
      "Just before the chocolate has fully set, use a paring knife or pastry scraper to clean the excess chocolate from the edge of the mold, returning it to the tempered chocolate, so that the finished eggs will have nice clean edges and to make it easier to unmold them.",
      "Transfer the mold, cavity side up, to the refrigerator. Let rest for 10 minutes to allow the chocolate to harden and retract from the sides of the mold.",
      "Line the baking sheet with a clean piece of parchment paper. Remove the mold from the refrigerator and invert it onto your hand. The egg shells should fall out. If not, rest your thumbs on the outside edge of the mold and place your first two fingers on the inside of the chocolate egg shape. Gently begin to lift the chocolate from the mold. Do not press or pull too hard or the chocolate will break. Carefully place the egg shapes on the prepared baking sheet until they are ready to be filled.",
      "To make the filling, place the chopped chocolate in the top half of a double boiler. Place over (not touching) gently simmering water in the bottom pan and heat, stirring frequently, until completely melted. Remove from the heat and set aside until just cool to the touch. Do not allow it to get too cold or it will begin to harden.",
      "While the chocolate is cooling, place the peanut butter in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle and beat on medium speed just until softened. Add the slightly warm chocolate and beat until combined. The mixture will be quite stiff, so make sure it is well blended.",
      "Using a teaspoon, fill each egg shape with the peanut butter mixture, smoothing the top with a spatula or knife. If you prefer a soft filling, let the eggs rest at room temperature for about 1 hour before serving. If a firmer texture if preferred, place the eggs in the refrigerator for about 15 minutes to allow the filling to harden, then serve.",
      "Store, in a single later, covered and refrigerated, for up to 3 days.",
      "You cannot mold tempered chocolate successfully in wood or other porous materials. Nor is glass a good choice. When you pour tempered choccolate into a glass mold, it immediately takes on the temperature of the glass, which if it is too hot or too cold will cause the chocolate to go out of temper. Antique metal molds, with interiors that have been damaged through years of use or the passage of time, are best used as wall decorations. Flexible plastic molds are terrific, but in time they begin to show wear and must be replaced. All of this is my way of saying that firm plastic and polycarbonate molds are the best choices for molding chocolate.",
      "Although you might have heard that coating a mold with fat will make removing the finished product easier, do not try it. It will not help unmold the item; it will only make it greasy. Chocolate, like plaster, retracts as it cools, which ensures that once it has set it will easily pull away from a plastic mold. Remember, chocolate reflects the surface against which it has been molded, so if properly done, the set chocolate will be smooth and shiny. However, the chocolate must be tempered-not simply melted-or it won't release.",
      "Before you begin to fill a mold, set up your workspace: Have the tempered chocolate in a bowl. Alongside the chocolate have the mold; a ladle; a paring knife; pastry scraper; large metal offset spatula, or other smooth-edged utensil; a wire rack on a parchment- or waxed paper-lined baking sheet; and some clean kitchen towels.",
      "Using the ladle, carefully fill the mold with the liquid chocolate. Once the mold is full, invert it over the bowl of tempered chocolate and allow the excess chocolate to drop back into the bowl. If the mold is finely detailed, it will be necessary to tap on the sides to release any air bubbles that might form in the raised detail. The mold should now be evenly coated with a thin layer (usually 1/8 or 1/16 inch thick, depending on the recipe) of chocolate. Wipe the edge of the mold, or the edge surrounding each cup in the mold, clean with a paring knife or pastry scraper. Place the chocolate-coated mold, open side down, on the wire rack. Let stand for about 5 minutes, or until the chocolate begins to harden. Using the paring knife, scrape the edge of the mold absolutely clean of hardened chocolate. This is important, because the chocolate retracts from the sides of the mold as it sets, and a clean edge will keep it from sticking and cracking as it shrinks. If desired, you can place the mold in the refrigerator for a few minutes to speed the hardening, but do not leave it there for any length of time.",
      "Once you have invested in molds, they can be used over and over again. My best advice for extending the life of plastic or polycarbonate molds is to clean them with care. Wash them in hot, soapy water, carefully wiping them clean with a soft cloth (never any rough material or a scouring pad). Then rinse them well under running water and dry thoroughly, as water deposits can be as damaging to molds as scratchy scrubbers.",
      "If desired, you can glue two egg halves together to form a whole egg. The glue that holds molded chocolate pieces together is simply more chocolate! Melt just enough chocolate to make a fine \"glue\" line between the chocolate edges. Place the filled eggs in the refrigerator for about 15 minutes, so they will be cold enough to \"set\" the chocolate \"glue\" immediately when you attach them to one another. Using the melted chocolate just as you would regular glue, and working with two eggs at a time, coat the chocolate edge of one egg with the melted chocolate and then quickly put the two eggs together and hold them firmly in place. If the eggs are cold enough, the melted chocolate will set immediately."

      "The meat of the fresh octopus is especially consistent, so if you are going to cook directly you must hit it with a kitchen mallet to soften it. For the laborious of this task, for a while now it is recommended to freeze and thaw it with time to prepare it, because the same effect is achieved in a comfortable and simple way. We are going to cook it in a large pot covered with boiling water, with two bay leaves and a small peeled onion. When the water is boiling, we introduce and gently remove the octopus in the pot 3 or 4 times to \"scare\" it. The proportion is that for each kilo of octopus it should be cooked for about half an hour, so for our octopus, 30 minutes of cooking will be enough. After a while we take out the octopus and, in the cooking water, we will throw the peeled and sliced potatoes to cook. This will impregnate the flavor and the intense color of the octopus. While the potatoes are cooking, we cut the octopus into slices with scissors. With the protagonists of the recipe already elaborated, we assemble our rations or tapas of octopus to the Galician. First we place a potato base and, on top of it, we put the octopus slices. Then sprinkle with sweet paprika and sprinkle with a good splash of extra virgin olive oil."

      "Cut the bottom 1/2 inch off each lemongrass stalk and trim the woody top portion of each stalk and discard. Peel the outer layers of each stalk until you reach the tender center. Thinly slice the stalks into coins, then very finely mince. Transfer to a medium bowl and add the pork, fish sauce, salt, sugar, and white pepper and mix to combine. Roll into 1 1/2-inch meatballs and set on a rimmed baking sheet. The meatballs can be made beforehand; transfer to a lidded container or tightly wrap the baking sheet with plastic wrap. Refrigerate until ready to use but no longer than 24 hours.",
      "In a small jar with a lid, combine the fish sauce, sugar, lime juice, garlic, and minced chile. Put the lid on the jar and shake vigorously until the sugar has dissolved. Set aside (the dressing will keep, refrigerated, for up to a week, though it gets spicier as it sits).",
      "Pour the oil into a medium heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium heat and add the sliced shallots to the cold oil. Line a plate with paper towels and set it nearby. As the oil heats, the shallots will begin to sizzle and bubble; fry, stirring frequently for even cooking, until the shallots begin to brown, about 6 to 8 minutes. Continue cooking, stirring constantly, until they are an even golden brown and crisp (at this stage, they can go from nicely browned to acrid and overcooked very quickly, so be vigilant). Use a spider or slotted spoon to transfer the shallots to the paper-towel- lined plate. Let the oil cool, then pour through a fine- mesh sieve into a clean jar. (Do not discard the oil; it's liquid gold, great for another batch of fried shallots or to add flavor to dressings and sauteed vegetables, and you can also use it to make a batch of aioli.) The fried shallots can be made in advance. Let cool, then store in an airtight container at room temperature. Resist snacking on them; they'll keep for about a week.",
      "Bring a large pot of water to a boil. When the water is boiling add the vermicelli noodles and cook according to package instructions until tender. Drain, rinse with cold water, and transfer to a rimmed baking sheet. Drizzle with a tablespoon of the shallot oil (it's fine if it's still warm) and toss to coat.",
      "Preheat the broiler to high. Transfer the baking sheet of meatballs to the oven, positioning it a few inches from the heating element. Broil the meatballs until browned, about 3 minutes, then roll the meatballs to the second side and broil for 3 minutes longer. Transfer to a bowl.",
      "To serve, arrange the vermicelli on a platter and surround with carrots, cucumber slices, lettuce, mint, and cilantro leaves. Serve the meatballs, dressing, fried shallots, and chopped peanuts alongside. Let the diners dig in, serving themselves some of the noodles, carrots, and cucumbers, garnished with herbs, shallots, and peanuts. Spoon dressing over each serving and top with a few meatballs."

Turn the fillets so that they can cook to a nice golden brown on both sides and place the red pepper in the spaces between the fillets. Stir the peppers so that they cook evenly. While the fish and peppers are cooking, in a medium sauce pan, over medium heat, wisk together the coconut milk, curry paste and brown sugar. When the fish is golden brown on both sides and the red pepper is cooked, add the sauce over the tilapia fillets and red peppers. The sauce will bubble. When it thickens to a nice smooth consistency, remove the pan from the heat. Sprinkle with fresh cilantro and serve immediately. This dish goes perfectly with white rice (jasmin, basmati or plain) which soaks up the wonderful sauce."

Add the drained can of green chiles and stir occasionally until pork is done cooking. crack your six eggs in a bowl and whisk. Pour the eggs over the pork and continue stirring until the eggs are cooked. Remove from heat and set aside until potatoes are done. Wash and peel potatoes and dice to desired size. In a separate skillet heat the olive oil and add the potatoes. sprinkle the salt and pepper over the potatoes and stir occaisionally until desired doneness. once potatoes and pork are cooked it is time to assemble the burrito. First microwave the tortillas 30 seconds until warm. Lay the tortilla out and spoon your egg and pork to one side of the burrito. Next add a spoon full potatoes next to the egg and generously add the cheese. Fold both ends over and roll to make your burrito. Next you will want to heat and wrap tightly in foil to keep warm. You can microwave or put back in the potato skillet to warm and melt the cheese."
