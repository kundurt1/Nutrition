U can also make this on the stove if u would like, cook it on medium or even low if u like, just simmer until done and make sure to stir so it doesn't stick or burn... Another thing I'd like to say is this recipe seems complicated because of all the ingredients, its not & well worth the effort!!",

      "PROCEDURE:",
      "Rinse fish fillets well, cut out the small ridge of bones remaining at the forward center part of each filet, and continue to cut to split the filet.",

      "Place prepared filets in plastic bag(s) till ready to fry.",
      "Try to ensure a minimum of water is in the bag with the fish.",

      "oil to fill the pot about halfway or possibly till the thermometer can reach into it.",
      "Too much oil can result in it bubbling over the top during the frying process.",
      "Light the gas and bring up a strong flame so you will not spend too much time waiting for the oil to come up to the REQUIRED 375 DEGREES for frying your fish.",
      "Meanwhile, make a strong shake-em-up bag by opening one of the brown paper bags and then opening the other inside it.",
      "Empty a package of your favorite fish fry mix into the double bag.",
      "(Some folks like to add in powdered curry to the plain or possibly lemon flavored mix.",

      "Carry the cookie sheets, shake-em-up bag with mix, slotted spoon, and bag(s) of fish to the cooking area",
      "When the oil reaches 375 degrees, put 12 or possibly so filets into the shake- em-up bag and shake well to coat each filet with the mix.",
      "Gently shake each filet as you take it form the bag to remove excess mix.",
      "Slide each into the warm oil.",
      "Don't drop them in so as to splash the oil.",
      "When the filets float on the surface of the oil, they are done.",
      "Remove immediately from the oil using the slotted spoon, pausing a moment for excess oil to drain away, and place in a single layer on a toweled cookie sheet.",
      "NOTES ON FRYING FISH:",
      "Frying fish leaves a distinctive odor and makes a significant contribution to the greasy film that tends to accumulate on everything in or possibly near a kitchen even under the best of circumstances.",
      "For this reason, I recommend frying fish out-of-doors when at all possible.",
      "If you are cooking a large quantity of fish to serve at one time, preheat your oven to 200 degrees.",
      "As the sheets of fried fish come from the cooker, place them in the hot oven till ready to serve.",
      "A few min in the hot oven will allow more oil to drain from the fish, however, too much time may result in dry, chewy fish.",
      "Keep a close watch on the oil temperature throughout the cooking process and adjust the flame accordingly.",
      "If oil temperature exceeds 400 degrees you will likely get overdone fish.",
      "If it drops below 350 degrees, you will likely get watery, oily fish.",
      "The veg.",
      "oil may be reuseable, depending on the amount of fry mix particles which end up in it and the temperature it has reached.",
      "If the oil has become too warm for too long it will give a burned taste to anything fried in it later.",
      "Tightly cover the oil after turning out the flame to help keep it reuseable.",
      "Note which koatimundis like veg.",
      "oil very much, especially if it is fish flavored, and take appropriate precautions."
