I used 22g total in the bowl putting only the bigger bits into the bowl and retained the tiny bits to sprinkle on my next Cafe latte (I guess you could just sprinkle them on top of the hot fresh-baked loaf). For greater indulgence 30g or so of chocolate would be nice but I'd run out for some reason :). The original Panasonic recipe called for 40g. I recommend staying with bitter or bittersweet chocolate (known as 'Plain Chocolate' in the UK) and avoiding milk chocolate. You could just use bitter or bittersweet chocolate chips if you can get them.",

      "Notes on how to make STELLAR biscuits:.",
      "1) Spoon flour into a dry measuring cup and level off with the straight edge of a metal knife. DON'T use a liquid measuring cup or you'll end up with too much flour and rock hard biscuits!",
      "2) I find it easier to incorporate room-temperature butter into my dry ingredients but then put the bowl with flour/butter back into the refrigerator for 10-15 minutes to chill the mixture. The colder your butter is, the higher your biscuits will end up. If you want to work with cold butter, this step is NOT necessary.",
      "3) Shake the carton of buttermilk before measuring and make sure the buttermilk is COLD! It keeps the butter cold, and you have a lighter, fluffier biscuit.",
      "4) Dust the work surface with All-Purpose flour when rolling and shaping the dough. (Leavening in Self-Rising flour leaves a bitter taste on the outside of the biscuit.).",
      "5) Cut STRAIGHT DOWN with a sharp biscuit cutter! Do NOT twist the cutter or you'll be sealing the edges of the biscuits and reduce the rise of them. Ditto on using a glass to cut out biscuits: both sides of the cutter need to be open to allow air to exit as you press down. The glass ends up sealing the edges of the biscuit.",
      "Directions:.",
      "Preheat oven to 450-degrees F.",
      "In a very large bowl combine all the dry ingredients: Flour, Baking Powder, Baking Soda, Sugar, Salt, Black Pepper and Cayenne Pepper. Stir well to evenly distribute the ingredients.",
      "Drop the cut tablespoons of butter all around the flour mixture. Cut in butter using a pastry cutter until mixture is about the size of peas or very crumbly. Cover and chill in the refrigerator for 10-15 minutes to allow the butter to become hard; this will aid in having a very flaky biscuit.",
      "Add the cheese chunks and chives to the chilled butter/flour mixture. Stir to coat them well with the flour.",
      "Stir in buttermilk only until dough holds together very slightly, about 30 seconds. DO NOT OVER STIR! THIS IS THE SECRET TO INCREDIBLY FLUFFY AND LIGHT BISCUITS! The dough should \"hold together\" but still be very lofty and NOT packed down!",
      "Turn dough out onto a floured board, kneading dough a few times (about 3-4 times) and then pat into a 5-inch x 9-inch rectangle; Sprinkle top of dough with a small amount of additional flour and fold into thirds like a letter. Repeat entire process 2 more times, beginning with pressing into a 3/4\" inch-thick dough rectangle again.",
      "Press or pat dough into a 1/2 inch thickness on a lightly floured surface; Dip edges of 2.5-inch biscuit cutter into flour and cut out a biscuit.DO NOT TWIST THE CUTTER! JUST PRESS FIRMLY DOWN, ONCE. Transfer to a parchment-lined baking sheet, placing biscuits side by side so they touch. Continue with existing dough. With the scraps, very lightly press dough together to form another rectangle and continue cutting out the biscuits. Caution! The MORE you work the dough and manhandle it, the tougher your biscuits will become so work with a very light hand when pushing the dough back together.",
      "Brush tops of biscuits lightly with cream.",
      "Bake for 14-16 minutes or until biscuits are lightly browned. Take out of oven by sliding the parchment paper with biscuits attached, onto table or counter top. Allow to sit for ONLY 1 minute, and transfer to a wire rack to cool for only a couple of minutes before serving. Caution! Moisture really builds up on the bottom of these biscuits, which is why they only sit on the parchment paper for 1 minute. Cooling on the rack for 2-3 minutes allows the cheese to set enough that it does NOT burn a person's mouth when eating it!",
      "VARIATIONS ON BISCUITS:.",
      "1) Feta-Oregano or Marjoram: Stir 4-8 ounces of crumbled feta cheese and 1 teaspoon of either oregano or marjoram into the chilled butter/flour mixture before adding the buttermilk. Proceed with recipe as directed.",
      "2) Bacon-Cheddar: Stir 6 cooked, drained, cooled and crumbled slices of bacon into the chilled butter/flour mixture along with 1/2 a cup of cubed Cheddar Cheese. Omit chives. Proceed with recipe as directed.",
      "3) Gruyere-Rosemary: Stir in 1 cup of cubed Gruyere cheese and 1/2 tablespoon of fresh, snipped rosemary into the chilled butter/flour mixture. Use 1/4 cup of snipped chives and 1/2 tablespoon of freshly ground black peper. Proceed with recipe as directed.",
      "4) Havarti-Dill: Stir in 1 cup of cubed Havarti cheese with 1 tablespoon of freshly snipped dill into the chilled butter/flour mixture. Omit chives. Proceed with recipe as directed.",
      "5) Pimento Cheese: Stir in 1 cup cubed Sharp Cheddar Cheese with 1-4 ounce jar of DRAINED and patted dry Pimento into the chilled butter/flour mixture. Omit chives. Proceed with recipe as directed.",
      "6) The ONE failure that I had was with Pepperjack Cheese. The actual cheese is too mild to taste in the end results and the remaining hot peppers were too much for the biscuit. Avoid this combination!"

      "CRISPY NOODLES (if you are substituting already store bought fried noodles, skip this step)- Heat 1 cup of oil in a deep pot, place some of the noodles (from the second 8 oz package) into a small round strainer creating a birds nest shape, add the noodles (with the strainer) into the hot oil and ladle over hot oil until the noodles appear golden brown and crispy (do not over cook), remove to a plate lined with paper towels to absorb some of the oil, do the same to make a total of 4 birds nests, set aside.",
      "PRESERVED VEGETABLES- Place the mustard greens (other preserved vegetables, like Kimshi) into a bowl, add some water and rinse briefly to remove some of the hot spices, then into a microwave for about 45 seconds, set aside.",
      "CILENTRO LEAVES- Remove the leaves from the stems, chop a little and place in a bowl of cold water and rinse to remove any sand, set aside.",
      "LIME SLICES- Cut one lime into circular shapes, set aside.",
      "SHALLOTS- Remove the paper like skin and then slice into thin round/oval shapes, set aside.",
      "COOKING INSTRUCTIONS:",
      "In a big soup pot add 2 tablespoons of oil, then add the 2 tablespoons Thai red curry paste , turmeric, ground coriander (or ground cardamom seeds/curry powder), stir briefly to release the flavors.",
      "Next add the chicken stock, coconut milk, chopped anchovies (or fish sauce), sugar and stir, bring to a low simmer.",
      "Taste and adjust as needed by adding more Thai curry paste to taste, lime juice (optional) and Bijol food coloring (optional) if desired.",
      "Next add the chicken pieces and simmer for about 15 minutes, until the pieces of chicken are cooked.",
      "In 4 individual bowls, add some of the cooked noodles and then ladle in some of the coconut soup mixture along with the chicken pieces.",
      "In the center of the bowl add the cilantro and preserved vegetables, then some shallots around the sides of the bowl.",
      "Next on top (and to one side) add one fried crispy noodle birds nest or if using already bought crispy noodles place all around the inside of each individual bowl.",

      "NOTES:",
      "1) The original recipe (and now modified to my taste) was from the book \"Marion: Recipes and stories from a hungry cook,\" by Marion Grasby, based in Australia.",
      "2) I was not very successful in making a rounded and somewhat deep birds nest -- but resulted in one that was just noodles bunched together. So perhaps you will have better success in making a better birds nest -- .",
      "3) You can also add a pinch of Bijol (brand name, optional) food coloring to enhance the color of the coconut soup."

You could also use a food processor or other appliance if you have one. Once grated, I place the cucumber in a collander or strainer and sprinkle with a little salt. Let it set about 15-20 minutes. The salt will pull out some of the moisture so the sauce does not become to watery.",
      "Once the cucumber has set and drained a bit, add it to a medium size bowl. Then add the mayonnaise, sour cream, pepper, grated onion, lemon zest and lemon juice. Mix well and chill. Now since you only needed a little lemon zest and juice, slice up the other half of the lemon in 4 slices for a garnish over the fish.",
      "Salmon -- Takes just 10-12 minutes. In a large pan add the water, wine, peppercorns, mint, lemon juice, cut up lemon, onion and salt. Bring to a medium - high simmer and add the salmon skin side down, top with a lemon slice, cover and simmer for 5 minutes and turn the heat off and keep the salmon in the liquid until the salmon is tender but not over cooked. It should take another 3-5 minutes. It should flake easily but still a little pink and be moist.",
      "Serve -- I like to reheat the peas for just a couple of minutes, and put a small bed on each plate, about 1 cup per serving. Top with the salmon fillet, the lemon slice, a little salt and pepper to taste, and then a little of the cucumber lemon sauce.",
      "It is a nice easy, healthy dish which every now and then is a nice change to all those rich holiday foods. Make some steamed new potatoes and some grilled vegetables or broiled for a very nice light dinner. Even my best friend who is a meat and potatoes guy love this dish."

      "To make Bechamel Sauce: In saucepan, melt butter over medium-low heat; whisk in flour and cook slowly until smooth and lightly cooked (2-3 minutes); add salt and remove from heat; add milk, whisking rapidly and return to heat; cook until thick and bubbly, whisking constantly; allow to cool 5 minutes, whisking once in a while to prevent a skin from forming; incorporate eggs and grated cheese with wire whisk to make fluffy sauce.",
      "Freezer Notes: Once the baked moussaka has completely cooked, cut serving-size pieces, double-wrap in foil and freeze. Defrost in the usual manner and reheat in microwave (or oven) for a delicious, quick meal, when there's little time to cook and dinner is ready and waiting in the freezer!"

(If using a pizza stone, place the dough you are going to roll out on a pizza peel generously coated with cornmeal. Proceed on the pizza peel as you would on the floured board.) Let the dough on the board sit a few minutes-it will be easier to roll out. Roll dough into a rough circle using a rolling pin, and then pushing out to form the final shape, making a slightly thicker rim around the edge. Or you can press dough ball into a rough circle, and then pick it up on your two fists and turn, stretching dough gently until it is desired thinness. Finish shaping on floured board. For thin-crusted pizza, make dough about 1/4-inch thick. For Sicilian, about 1/2 to 3/4-inch thick (see below).",
      "If using a pizza stone, put whatever toppings you are using on crust, then put pizza on stone by sliding the pizza peel out with a quick jerk so pizza slides onto the stone. Cook 15-20 minutes.",
      "If baking pizza in a pizza pan or on a baking sheet, lightly oil pizza pan or sheet and place formed dough on it, adjusting shape to final form you want. Add desired topping and bake 15-20 minutes.",
      "For Sicilian pizza, divide into 2 larger dough balls. Rollout dough no less than 1/2-inch thick. Proceed as described above for pizza stone or pan baking. The traditional way to cook Sicilian pizza is in a lightly oiled rectangular 9 x 13-inch pan, rolling it into a basic rectangle and then shaping it to fit inside the pan with your hands. Because of the thickness, bake 20-25 minutes with its toppings.",

      "Henry's Notes and Tips: If you're going to have a lot of toppings, you may wish to prebake the crust a few minutes. This is because in a regular oven not all the ingredients will cook through at the same time and you may end up with a soggy center. (You need a much higher temperature for all the ingredients to get cooked at once.) But don't cook dough more than 3 minutes before adding toppings or it will get to done. Also, don't roll out dough too thin that's going to have a lot of toppings-I'd maker them an inch less in size than described above.",
      "Classis Pizza Toppings.",
      "The most basic pizza topping is tomato sauce and mozzarella cheese, with a bit of Parmesan and herbs on top. This is often called Pizza Margherita, after Queen Margherita, who it was supposed to have been created for. Traditional pizza toppings to an Italian American range from meats like pepperoni, sausage, sliced meatballs, prosciutto, to spinach, mushrooms, onions, fresh red, green, or yellow peppers, black olives, anchovies, capers, artichoke hearts, and fresh garlic in any way-sliced, slivered, roasted, minced."
