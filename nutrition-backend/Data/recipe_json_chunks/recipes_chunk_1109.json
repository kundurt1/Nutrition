Take the stuffing mix and fill the hollow hole you created in the pork loin. Take a part of the loin (approximately 1 inches thick) that you cut out of the center of the loin and replace it on the two ends of the stuffed loin. Use tooth pics to hold the pieces of loin in place. Now simply use the Simple 1-2-3 method of applying Worcestershire sauce and then the remaining 1/2 cup of a BBQ Rub over the entire pork loin and place on your smoker or oven. Cook at approximately 200 to 225 degrees for 2 1/2 to 3 hours till you get an internal temperature of 160 degrees. After about an hour on the smoker I usually form a boat with some aluminum foil and place the loin inside the boat. You can use an aluminum pan if you wish. The reason for the foil or the aluminum pan is as the center of the loin heats up the stuffing will begin to ooze out of the ends of the loin and this makes clean up a lot easier.",
      "Let the loin rest for about 1/2 hour then slice. It is a bit gooey but it is sooooo good.",

      "Preparation: the evening before, in a saucepan scald the milk. In a small bowl pour the scalding hot (but not boiling) milk over the cornmeal and 1 teaspoon sugar. Stir together and cover tightly with plastic wrap. Place in a warm spot (90\u00b0-100\u00b0) where it will remain for 8 to 10 hours. A bubbly foam will develop over the surface of the cornmeal and it will smell sweet and fermented.",
      "By Hand: In a large mixing or mixer bowl (warmed under hot water tap), pour the hot water over the 1/2 teaspoon sugar, salt, and baking soda. Stir this briefly with a large spoon. Gradually add 1-1/2 cups flour to make a thick batter. Stir until smooth - about 50 strokes. The batter should be lukewarm to the touch. Not hot. Stir in the fermented cornmeal mixture.",
      "First Rising: Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap; return to the warm place until the batter has bubbled and foamed to more than double its volume, about 2 hours. When you turn back the plastic wrap the aroma will be quite strong.",
      "By Hand or Mixer: With the wooden spoon or flat beater mix in the shortening. Gradually add flour, 1/4 cup at a time, first with the spoon and then by hand. Work it well between the fingers, adding more flour, if necessary, until the dough has lost its wetness and a rough mass has formed. If using a mixer, when the dough becomes heavy remove the flat beater and replace it with the dough hook. Continue adding flour until a rough mass forms under the hook.",
      "Kneading: Turn the dough onto a floured work surface and begin the kneading process. This dough will feel alive under your palms, elastic and soft. The dough under the dough hook will form a soft ball around the revolving arm. Add sprinkles of flour if the dough sticks to the sides of the bowl. Knead for 10 minutes.",
      "By Processor: the fist 2 steps in the preparation of the dough will be done in 2 bowls, as above. Processing will come later.",
      "Attach the steel blade. After the batter has risen for the second time and the shortening has been added, pour the mixture into the processor work bowl. With the machine running, add flour, 1/4 cup at a time, to form a rough mass that whirls with the blade and cleans the sides of the bowl. If flour remains along the bottom edge of the bowl, scrape it free with a spatula.",
      "Kneading: With the processor running, knead for 60 seconds.",
      "Shaping: Divide the dough in half. Roll each piece into a rectangle, fold in half, pinch the seam closed, and shape the dough into a loaf. Place in the pans, seam to the bottom. The dough usually fills only half of the pan. Brush the tops lightly with oil or melted butter.",
      "Second Rising: Cover with wax paper and allow to rise until the dough has doubled, about 50 minutes.",
      "Preheat the oven to 375\u00b0 about 20 minutes before baking.",
      "Baking: Place the pans in the oven. When the loaves are nicely browned and tapping the bottom crust yields a hard and hollow sound, about 45 minute, they are done. (If using a convection oven, reduce heat 50\u00b0.).",
      "Final Step: Remove the bread from the oven and turn out immediately onto a metal cooling rack.",
      "Toasting enhances the flavor of salt-rising bread. It may be kept frozen for several months at 0\u00b0.",

It will cook down later and intensify but use this opportunity to check the flavor. If needed, add up to 11/2 teaspoons sugar or fish sauce, or both. Set aside.",
      "In a skillet or sauteuse pan over medium heat, melt the coconut oil. When the oil is barely shimmering, add the shallot and garlic and cook, stirring frequently, for 3 to 4 minutes, until the garlic is pale blond. Remove from the heat and, once the cooking action subsides, add the coconut water mixture.",
      "Return the skillet to high heat and bring to a boil. Cook, without stirring, for 10 to 14 minutes, until reduced to between 1/3 and 1/2 cup, a bit thickened, and slightly darkened. Add the shrimp and continue cooking at a swift simmer, stirring frequently, for 3 to 5 minutes, until the shrimp curls up and cooks through and the sauce is slightly syrupy. (Expect the shrimp's natural juices to release, thin out, and flavor the sauce.) If the shrimp cooks too fast, remove it from the pan, let the sauce cook down, and then return the shrimp. Remove from the heat, season with lots of pepper, and stir in the green onion. Let sit for 5 minutes for the flavors to settle and deepen.",
      "Transfer the shrimp to a shallow bowl or plate and serve.",
      "About the Caramel Sauce:",
      "This key Viet ingredient is simply nearly burnt sugar; it's not at all the caramel sauce for topping ice cream. Vietnamese caramel sauce is stealthily employed in savory dishes to impart a lovely mahogany color and build savory-sweet depth. You've likely had caramel sauce in clay-pot (kho) dishes but didn't know it. Like molasses, it can be added to grilled-meat marinades to enhance the appearance of the final dish.",
      "Don't fear the caramelization process. It's not overly dramatic, and the vinegar prevents crystallization, which can result in crusty failed batches. Employ cane sugar, such as C&H brand, because it caramelizes consistently better than beet sugar. The result is an inky, bittersweet Vietnamese staple. I keep a jar of caramel sauce to cut down on prep work. If you don't have time to make a batch, use the work-arounds in the recipes to make some on the spot. Select a small, heavy-bottomed saucepan with a long handle and a light interior (such as stainless steel) to observe the caramelization. If you wish, use strained fresh lemon or lime juice in place of vinegar.",
      "Caramel Sauce Directions:",
      "Fill the sink (or a large bowl or pot) with enough water to come halfway up the sides of the saucepan.",
      "In the saucepan, combine the 2 tablespoons water, vinegar (if using), and sugar. Set over medium heat and cook, stirring with a heatproof spatula or metal spoon; when the sugar has nearly or fully dissolved, stop stirring. Let the sugar syrup bubble vigorously for 5 to 6 minutes, until it takes on the shade of light tea. Turn the heat to medium-low to stabilize the cooking. Turn on the exhaust to vent the inevitable smoke. (Don't worry if sugar crystallizes on the pan wall. But if things get crusty in the bubbling sugar syrup, add another drop of vinegar to correct it.) For even cooking, you may occasionally lift and swirl the saucepan.",
      "Cook the syrup for about 2 minutes longer, until it is the color of dark tea. The next 1 to 2 minutes are critical because the sugar will darken by the second. Monitor the cooking and, to control the caramelization, frequently pick up the saucepan and slowly swirl the syrup. When a dark reddish cast sets in-think the color of Pinot Noir-let the sugar cook a few seconds longer to a color between Cabernet and black coffee. Remove from the heat and place the pan in the water to stop the cooking. Expect the pan bottom to sizzle upon contact.",
      "Leaving the pan in the sink, add the remaining 1/4 cup water. The sugar will seize up, which is okay. When the dramatic bubbling reaction stops, return the pan to medium-high heat, and cook briefly, stirring to loosen and dissolve the sugar.",
      "Remove the pan from the heat and return to the water in the sink for about 1 minute, stirring, to stop the cooking process and cool the caramel sauce to room temperature.",
      "Use the sauce immediately, or transfer to a small heatproof glass jar, let cool completely, and then cap and store in a cool, dark place indefinitely."

      "To make your own sea salt, all you have to do is collect your salt water and strain it through cheese cloth or a fine sieve (or both).",
      "Boil the water to your hearts content. Technically, you could make sea salt by pouring the water into shallow pans and leaving them outside for the sun to evaporate all the water. But who has the time for that. The boiling time varies depending how much water you collect. I would plan on about spending 1-1/2 to 2 hours per gallon of water. The nice thing about choosing the stove top boiling method is the heat will kill any bacteria which may be catching a ride in your salt water.",
      "When the majority of the water has evaporated, pour the the salt water into a shallow baking pan to prevent the salt from scorching. The salt water should have the consistency of wet sand at this point. Leave the pan uncovered at room temperature for 3-5 days, stirring it occasionally. The remaining water in the pan will evaporate over time.",
      "Once the water evaporates and the salt is fully dried you will have a nice batch of freshly made sea salt. The salt won't be like the pelleted sea salt sold in fancy stores. It will be more flaky and similar to kosher salt. Be sure to store the salt in an airtight container so it doesn't pick up any other smells or flavors while hanging out in the spice cabinet.",
      "It will produce 1/2 to 2 cups per gallon.",
      "The teaspoon of water was just to get the system to accept the recipe, you can omit it."
