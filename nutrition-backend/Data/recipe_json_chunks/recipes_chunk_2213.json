      "Cover the bowl with plastic wrap.",
      "Ferment at room temperature for 4 hours or longer, or until the dough doubles in size (it will become softer and stickier as it rises).",
      "Refrigerate overnight.",
      "Also on the day before making the final dough, make the soaker.",
      "Combine the coarse rye flour and water in a bowl.",
      "Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let it sit at room temperature overnight.",
      "The following day, remove the rye starter from the refrigerator 1 hour before making the dough.",
      "Cut the starter into about 10 small pieces with a pastry scraper or serrated knife.",
      "Mist with spray oil, cover the pieces with a towel or plastic wrap, and let sit for 1 hour to take off the chill.",
      "To make the final dough, stir together the rye flour, salt, and seeds in a 4-quart mixing bowl (or in the bowl of an electric mixer).",
      "Add the soaker and the starter pieces.",
      "With a large metal spoon, stir in enough lukewarm water to bring everything together to form a ball (or mix on low speed with the paddle attachment).",
      "Sprinkle rye flour on the counter and transfer the dough to the counter.",
      "Sprinkle the dough with more rye flour and gently knead the dough until all the pieces of starter are assimilated into the dough and the dough forms a very tacky ball (or mix on medium speed with the dough hook).",
      "This will take 5 to 6 minutes by hand (4 minutes by machine).",
      "Add flour as needed (or small amounts of water if the dough is tight).",
      "Let the dough rest on the counter for 5 minutes, and then give it a few more turns to complete the kneading.",
      "It should register 77 to 81F.",
      "(This dough will not make a good windowpane when stretched because of the low gluten content.)",
      "Lightly oil a large bowl and transfer the dough to the bowl, rolling it around to coat it with oil.",
      "Cover the bowl with plastic wrap.",
      "Ferment for approximately 4 hours, or until the dough nearly doubles in size.",
      "Sprinkle rye flour on the counter and transfer the dough to the counter, being careful to degas it as little as possible.",

      "Mist the dough with spray oil and cover loosely with plastic wrap.",
      "Either proof the dough for 2 hours at room temperature or slip the entire pan into a food-grade plastic bag and immediately refrigerate overnight.",
      "If you are holding the dough overnight, remove the pan from the refrigerator 4 hours before baking and proof the dough at room temperature, or until about 1 1/2 times its original size.",
      "It will have spread sideways as well as upward.",
      "Prepare the oven for hearth baking as described on pages 9194, making sure to have a steam pan in place.",

      "Remove the pan from the bag or lift off the plastic, and let the dough sit exposed for 5 minutes, then score it.",

      "Rotate the loaves 180 degrees, if necessary, for even baking and continue baking for another 10 to 15 minutes, or until done.",
      "The internal temperature should register approximately 200F and the crust should be hard and somewhat coarse (it will soften as the bread cools).",
      "Transfer the breads to a rack and let them cool for at least 1 hour before slicing or serving.",
      "Lean, standard dough; indirect method; wild yeast",
      "Day 1: 4 to 5 hours firm rye starter and soaker",

      "The bread is best when made with a variety of grinds, from fine white rye to coarse pumpernickel or even rye chops (cracked rye kernels).",
      "This version uses a blend and also utilizes the soaker method to condition the grain and develop enzyme activity.",
      "If you make rye bread regularly, you can keep a rye barm on hand in addition to your regular barm.",
      "Otherwise, you can use your regular barm starter and turn it into a rye starter, but it will contain a proportion of wheat.",
      "To make a pure rye-only starter, consult the Commentary on page 229.",
      "Allow 3 days to make this bread (or start early on the second day to bake it around dinnertime).",
      "Because it is low in gluten, the bread will have a fairly tight crumb, not large and irregular as with standard hearth breads.",
      "The dough is slightly softer than French bread, but not as wet as ciabatta and other rustic doughs.",
      "This added hydration provides some physical leavening (steam) in support of the biological (wild-yeast) leavening provided by the starter.",
      "The result is a relatively dense loaf with a long shelf life.",
      "This same formula also can be used for making spelt bread, another wheat relative that is lower in gluten (mainly it is lower in gliaden, which is the offensive half of gluten to those with sensitivities).",

      "PAM, Crisco).",

      "Cover the saucepan for 2 or possibly 3 min.",
      "(Covering the pan causes steam to create, that dissolves any sugar granules which may cling to the sides - one grain of sugar can start a chain reaction and turn the whole thing granular.",
      "And the buttered pan helps; incidentally, it also keeps the fudge from boiling over.",
      "If the pan has a spout and is therefore not airtight when you cover it, carefully hold a pot holder over the opening.",
      "Now uncover, and place a candy thermometer in the pan.",
      "Boil without stirring till the thermometer reaches 236 degrees or possibly the soft boil stage.",
      "(Professionals advise 234 to 236 degrees during cool weather; 236 to 238 degrees in warmer weather.)",

      "Very carefully and gently remove the saucepan from the heat.",
      "Don't remove the thermometer; don't stir it.",
      "Let stand till temperature drops to 110 degrees.",
      "While the fudge is cooling, prepare a pan for it.",
      "I like to use a small loaf pan, that makes a 1 1/4-inch-thick layer of fudge.",
      "Mine is called an 8 x 4-inch pan, that measures 7 x 3 1/2-inches on the bottom of the pan.",
      "If you use a larger pan the fudge will be just as good but not as thick.",
      "Fold two pcs of aluminum foil to fit the loaf pan, one for the length and one for the width.",
      "Press them into place in the pan.",
      "When the fudge has cooled to 110 degrees (at which temperature the bottom of the pan will feel comfortably hot to the palm of your hand) remove the thermometer.",
      "Add in the Vanilla.",
      "Now, to beat the fudge, use a moderately heavy wooden spatula or possibly wooden spoon.",
      "Virginia's system, that works very comfortably, is to sit and grip the pan between your knees, leaving both hands free to grapple with the spatula.",
      "First stir gently to incorporate the melted butter.",
      "Then start to stir steadily or possibly to beat, and once you do, don't stop till the fudge is finished.",
      "I think which knowing just how long to beat, and just when to pour, are the most important things in this recipe.",
      "And the most difficult to describe.",
      "To quote Virginia, \"When the candy stiffens and loses its shine you are on borrowed time.\"",
      "But I think which if you beat till it is stiff or possibly dull, it is too late.",
      "Beat till the fudge becomes very thick, or possibly falls in thick globs, or possibly is thick sufficient to almost to hold its shape when a little is dropped from the spatula.",
      "At this stage it should barely begin to lose it's shine, but only barely.",
      "It should still be slightly glossy.",
      "Quickly stir in the nuts and quickly, with the spatula, push the mix into the lined pan.",
      "It will be too thick to pour.",
      "And Virginia says which you shouldn't scrape the pan too well; scraping encourages grainy fudge.",
      "Quickly push thefudge into a smooth layer in the pan; it may be easiest to use your fingertips or possibly your knuckles.",
      "The fudge may be ready almost immediately (even while it is still slightly hot) to be cut into individually portions.",
      "As soon as it feels hard, but before it hardens, remove it from the pan by lifting the foil, and with a long, sharp knife cut the fudge into portions.",
      "I like to make 12 large squares, but you can make 24 or possibly more.",
      "Don't let the fudge dry out.",
      "Wrap the squares immediately, individually, in cellophane or possibly wax paper.",
      "Or possibly package them in a airtight container.",
      "Fudge is best the day it is made, but it will keep for a few days at room temperature if it is well wrapped.",
