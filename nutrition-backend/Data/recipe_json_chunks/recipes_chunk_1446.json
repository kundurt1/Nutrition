With a pastry blender or your fingertips, cut the butter and shortening into the dry ingredients until fats are coated with flours and are the size of peas. Add the buttermilk, and mix gently until ingredients are just moistened. Turn the mixture out onto a floured surface and knead lightly, about 10 times, until the dough just comes together.",

Discard remaining dough. Place biscuits on baking sheet, just barely touching each other. Brush tops with heavy cream. Bake until lightly golden brown, 15 to 17 minutes.",
      "Meanwhile, prepare the gravy: Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add the butter to melt, then sausage. Break apart the sausage into a single layer, and cook until no longer pink and it starts to brown, about 6 minutes. Add the onions and peppers, and cook until the onions are translucent, about 5 minutes.",
      "Reduce heat to low. Sprinkle the flour over the sausage, and cook, stirring occasionally, for 3 minutes. Slowly add the hot chicken stock; increase heat to medium, and bring to a simmer. Cook 5 minutes. Stir in heavy cream, and cook until warmed through, about 3 minutes. (Do not boil.) Season with the salt and pepper.",

The truth is, Riesling comes in a range of sugar levels, from bone dry to quite sweet. Those from Alsace, France, lean toward very dry; German bottles run the gamut. But the best have great acidity that keeps the wine crisp and refreshing, no matter how sweet. And stone fruit, apple, pear, and citrus flavors often come along with hints of flowers, minerals, and what can only be described as a haunting diesel-fuel quality--if you can imagine that as a good thing.",
      "It's that acidity that makes Riesling a great food wine: Drier ones are wonderful with shellfish (the fruit picks up on the sweetness of crab and shrimp), sushi, poultry, pork, salty cured meats like ham, and--surprisingly--eggs; sweeter versions do well with sweet-and-sour dishes and spicy Thai or Southwestern food.",
