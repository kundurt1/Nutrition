Remove the pan from the oven and shake a few times. Some of the mushrooms should be starting to get a little golden on the lighter underneath side of the caps. You will probably need to put them back in for a little longer, say 3 to 5 minutes, maybe more if your oven wasn't really hot when you put them in. You want at least a third of the mushrooms starting to turn a nice golden color on the gill side and getting a little crunchy.
