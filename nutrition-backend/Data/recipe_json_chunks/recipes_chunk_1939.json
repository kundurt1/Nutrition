      "Thinking that the addition of a vegetable might improve the flavour I added a head of broccoli (chopped) into the mix and pressure cooked for 30 minutes.",
      "The result was a slightly messy looking beef stew, but the taste was vastly improved and DH loved it -- so it's going to stay firmly in my cookbook with the additions that suit our needs and tastes.",
      "It's a cheap and easy meal to make, and went well over our roast potatoes.",
      "With only stars given in the reviews to date (July 2005) I am not certain how else people might wish me to try and improve this recipe.",
      "Therefore I give you my own experiences and ideas and would appreciate your feedback if you would like to experiment further with this one :)."

      "Dried sweet cherries have a prunelike flavor, but the tart (sour or pie) cherries, which are usually processed with sugar, have a brilliant tangy flavor.",
      "When simmered with wine and duck stock, they make a balanced, savory, and full-flavored sauce that plays beautifully off the crispy citrus-rubbed duck in this recipe."
