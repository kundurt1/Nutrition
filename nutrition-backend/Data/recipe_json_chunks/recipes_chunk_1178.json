Then add the flour and Italian seasoning to a small bowl and mix well. Dredge each porch chop in the flour, and shake off the extra, but make sure it is coated well. Then in a large deep saute pan, add the oil and butter and bring to medium high heat. Saute the pork chops on each side until golden brown. Shouldn't take more than 3-4 minutes per side. Once golden brown, remove and set on a plate off to the side while you prepare the base vegetables.",
      "Vegetable Base -- To the same pan, lower to medium heat, add the remaining butter and olive oil, garlic and onions and cook about 1-2 minutes until the onions begin to soften. Then add in the mushrooms and cook another minute making sure to cover them in the oil and butter mix with the onions.",

Cook just a minute and then add in the wine, broth, bay leaf, a pinch of salt, go easy, because the broth is salty and a pinch of pepper, along with the thyme, and rosemary. Then, add the pork chops back in, pushing them down in the sauce and bring to a light boil. If the pork chops are not covered by the broth, add a bit more broth. You can always add a bit more later. Cover and simmer 30 minutes until the onions and mushrooms are soft and the pork chops are tender.",

If you want your sauce thicker - you can add a bit of corn starch to a teaspoon of the broth and then slowly stir into the broth. Add just a little at a time and bring to a light boil. Once it comes to a boil the sauce will continue to thicken. Make the sauce as thick as you like.",

      "To Make Ghee: Put the butter in a good saucepan and bring to a boil on medium heat. Then reduce to low. Now this is what will happen as the butter slowly simmers. Moisture will be evaporated out of the ghee. The white protein-solids from the butter will sink down to the bottom of the pan and slowly turn golden. A foam will rise to the surface, and as it cooks will form a bit of a crust. The butter will cook into a gold color as well, and it will have a slightly nutty smell. When the moisture is gone, the ghee is done. Decant the oil and save the delicious golden buttery bits on the bottom of the pan for toast, or mixed with veggies or potatoes. If you've used salted butter, you don't want to use it on toast- the salt will knock you out, but it's still good in potatoes or whatnot.",
      "Making the Scented Syrup: Combine sugar and water and bring to a boil for 3 minutes. Remove from heat and add rose water or essence.",
      "Traditional Method: Use a heavy-bottomed pan because the milk will stick. Use a non-stick pot if you have it. Boil the milk down over medium heat, while stirring, until it forms a paste. Add the flour and mix into a smooth paste. Oil your hands and roll them into uniform balls, place them onto a buttered plate and set aside.",

      "Slip in the balls, one by one. They will sink. No touching at this point.",
      "Gently shake the pan to move the balls and keep them from getting too brown on one side. After about 5 minutes they will begin to float. You will notice them getting bigger.",
      "Now, use a wooden spoon or equivalent to gently agitate and keep them evenly browning.",

This can be one of those times that a fine set of grill marks will pay off big dividends on presentation, so if you're thinking grill marks I am sure you know what to do. When only a few minutes are left coat chop with glaze, being careful not to put on too soon and have sugars burn. Grilling pork can be a personal choice as to when they are done. Because of the moist stuffing, these do not tend to dry out. But with the glaze you can blacken them and give that bitter burnt taste to what was going to be your best meal of summer.",

      ".Make the dough: In the bowl of a standing mixer fitted with a hook, combine yeast, 1/2 teaspoons of the sugar, and 1/4 cup water heated to 115\u00b0. Stir to combine and let sit until foamy, about 10 minutes. Add remaining sugar, milk, light brown sugar, vanilla, egg, and egg yolk. Beat on low speed until thoroughly combined, 1 minute. Turn mixer off and add the flour and salt. Mix on medium speed until the dough just comes together. Turn mixer speed to high and knead dough for 4 minutes. Add the butter and continue kneading until dough is smooth and pulls away from the side of the bowl, about 6 minutes. Remove bowl from the mixer, cover with plastic wrap, and set aside in a warm place. Let the dough rise for 1 1/2-2 hours, until it has doubled in size.",

Using a floured rolling pin, roll the dough into a 10\" x 10\" square. In a small bowl, beat the cream cheese with a rubber spatula until it's smooth and spreadable. Spread the cream cheese evenly over the dough square; then fold square into thirds as you would fold a letter to fit it into an envelope. Take the open ends of the resulting rectangle and fold into thirds again, to make a smaller dough square. Invert the dough so that the seam is face down and, using the rolling pin, gently roll into a 10\" x 20\" rectangle.",
      "Turn the dough so that the short sides are parallel to you. Brush the top of the dough with half of the melted butter. Drizzle the reserved filling over the dough, leaving a 1\" border at the edge farthest away from you. Lightly press the filling into the dough. Using your hands, lift up the bottom edge of the dough and roll it forward into a tight cylinder. Place dough cylinder, seam side down, on a cutting board and, using a thin, sharp knife, trim off the ends; cut cylinder crosswise into 8 equal-size slices. Nestle the slices, cut sides up and evenly spaced from one another, into a buttered 9\" x 13\" light-colored metal baking pan. Cover pan with plastic wrap and set aside in a warm place to let rise for 2 hours. (Alternatively, the rolls may be refrigerated overnight.).",

Add the water and mix just until it comes together. It should be softer than but similar to cookie dough. Divide the dough into quarters and then thirds, making 12 dough pieces. Form each piece into a ball with your hands, and then press down to make a small patty. Continue flattening the patty until you have a 1/4\"-1/8\" thick, 3\"-4\" circle. Place the flattened dough into one of the cups in a twelve-cup non-stick muffin pan. It does not have to fit perfectly, and probably won't. Press out the sides and any possible overlap of the dough to form a tart crust in the muffin-cup. It does not have to overlap the edge of the muffin-cup, just come to the top of it. Repeat this for all twelve muffin-cups. Transfer the pan to the freezer or refrigerator.",

Spoon the oat mixture over top of the apples and crust, covering them almost completely.",

      "And lastly, this cake is for fun. It is for the nerd in all of us that just wants to sit down with a bunch of friends, and eat. This cake is perfect for that. Heck, you could all bring food and call it a Lies and Deceit Pot Luck, and LAN your way through the meal!",
      "Warning to the wise: this cake is VERY rich. Don't cut it into eight slices, cut it into sixteen. Regular sized slices will just make people sick to their stomachs because of how rich this cake is. So do eat carefully.",
      "The night before, mix 2/3c cocoa powder with 1.5 cans of vanilla frosting. Save the remaining half can of vanilla frosting for later.",
      "Next day: remove mixed frosting and vanilla frosting from the fridge and set to the side. Also place the cherries and chocolate chips to the side. They will not be used until the cake is completely done.",

      "When done cooking, allow the cake to cool for at least one hour.",
      "Remove top quarter inch from one cake round. Basically, let it have a completely flat top so that the second layer can rest smoothly on top. I suggest using a bread knife.",
      "Use the coconut frosting as the inner layer.",
      "Place second layer on top of first layer.",
      "Frost with the cocoa powder mixed frosting. Warning: this stuff is stiff, so it takes a little work.",
      "Coat entire cake with chocolate chips, press them lightly into the frosting to get them to stay. The recipe suggests one cup, I would suggest just taking from the bag. Measurements are just suggestions for chocolate chips.",
      "Using the remaining vanilla frosting and a tablespoon, dallop eight circles around the top of the cake.",
      "Place the eight cherries on top of the eight vanilla frosting circles.",

      "NOTE: You can, of course, peel your apple before cooking, but I always leave the peel on for the fiber and the pectin. The stick blender makes short work of it, and I always like a slightly coarse, rustic texture anyway. If you don't have boiled cider, simply use apple juice in place of the water. Or you can easily make your own boiled cider in the crock pot. Just throw in some pure apple cider (not 10% apple juice cocktail, you get the idea), and cook it on high until it reduces down to a thick syrup. Voila! It keeps in the fridge for ages. Also, I used Splenda in place of the sugar to hold the calories down and it worked perfectly. Last but not least, I always stir in half a teaspoon of xanthan gum before pouring into the ice cream machine. It gives the final product a smooth, scoopable texture and eliminates the iciness you get with a lot of homemade ice creams. Xanthan gum can be found in the health food aisle with the Bob's Red Mill products. Have fun!"

After 12 hours have passed, remove the bands and check the lids - press down in the center of the lid. If you cannot push the lid down any further, the jar is sealed.

Reduce heat to medium, and continue to cook over the stove. As the mixture cooks, foam will form on the surface, and must be removed. The best way to do this is to use a large metal spoon to gather the foam to one side of the pot, allow it to accumulate and thicken, then skim off with the spoon. As the mixture cooks, it will thicken and continue to produce foam. Continue to remove foam as above, for about 5-10 minutes, until it stops foaming.",

      "The eggs don't thicken up until they are cooked in the boiling water. Your bagels should be firm enough to maintain there shape. If not add more flour to toughen them up. All bread dough should be tough not weak like cake batter.",
      "When you boil regular bagels in water there is no eggs or not many eggs in the dough so it will be gooey- less firm.",
      "But with 2 to 3 eggs added to the dough it will firmed up quicker - harder and stronger. I like french toast bagels; because they would take less time to make.",

      "You now have the basic shape of your bagel - put the bagel onto a metal cooking sheet that has been floured lightly and let it rise for five minutes.",
      "After five minutes is up start boiling bagels two at a time unless your bagels are very large then one at a time.",
      "Place in boiling water with a spatula. It will fall to the bottom at first. It will rise up in 1 1/2 minutes to the top to indicate it is done, unless your water is too dirty with flour that come off with bagel boiling.",
      "Don't add a lot of baking soda to the water unless you want pretzels to be made then 1 Tablespoon to maybe 8 cups of water (for boiling).",
      "Done replace boiling with fresh water if your bagels stop floating; because of to much flour in the water. It is more important that the entire recipe of bagels be put in the oven at one time. Then to have it all float as a sign it is done.",

      "Your bagel may not rise; because cooked eggs weight it down. Just find the bagels in the bottom after 1 1/2 minutes and lift them out.",
      "Place water boiled bagels onto an oiled baking sheet to get them ready for baking.",
      "High heat recipes are more risky it may get the bagel done faster; but you may burn the bagel while having gooey spots. So use lower heat and longer cook times.",
      "Preheat oven to 475 for fast bake browning of the bagels. You've already firmed up bagels with the 2 minute cooking of the eggs inside the dough. But you do need to brown the bagels with high heat.",

      "Normal bagel recipe would be 400 for 20 - 25 minutes assuming no eggs or a few eggs. But I've got an oven the temperature thermostat is probably off so when we set 400 we're probably getting 325 degree cooking. Because it seems to take 1 hour 15 minutes to complete when bagels the recipe calls for 20 to 25 minutes cooking.",
      "Pizza's cooks at 475 for 8- 12 minutes to brown quickly and similar results will occur with the bagels or switch to a slower bake with lower temperatures and longer times for less risk of burning them.",
      "However you may brown the crust with too much heat and still have gooey undercooked areas. But you can't shorten cooking time.",
      "Unless 100% of your water is eggs meaning you used 12 eggs in a recipe you can't be done by just browning. The water and the eggs make up the liquid and it is harder to cook off the liquid rapidly."
