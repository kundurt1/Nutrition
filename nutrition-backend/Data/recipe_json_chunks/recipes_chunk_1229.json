      "Pre-heat oven to 375 degrees.",
      "PIE CRUST:.",
      "Mix flour, vegetable shortening, and salt together in a bowl using a wired pastry cutter. The dough should form into small clumps that don't feel greasy.",
      "Using a tablespoon, put the ice cold water in one tablespoon at a time, mixing as you go. I usually start with about four - six tablespoons and work my way up from there. The dough will eventually form into a ball. The dough should not feel wet on the outside, just slightly moist and if you break it in 1/2, it should not feel soggy on the inside. If you put in a little too much water, you can always add a bit more flour.",
      "If you like, you can wrap the dough and place it in the refrigerator for awhile at this stage. Using the ice water, though, removes the need to refrigerate if you don't want to.",
      "When you're ready to roll, dust your work surface (I use taped-down wax paper for this), your hands, your rolling pin, and your dough with flour. Roll out the dough on your work surface starting in the middle and working outward. Try to keep it in circle form, but it isn't a huge deal. Roll it until it is about 1/4\" thick all over.",
      "Lift up the dough and place it in your pie dish.",
      "Poke the dough at the bottom of the pie dish with a fork all over. Take the teaspoon or so of sugar and sprinkle it all along the bottom, covering the fork holes. This prevents the bottom of the crust from getting soggy your filling to leaking.",
      "Around the top rim of your pie dish, pinch the dough so that it forms a small peak all around the rim. I do this by placing my index finger of my left hand on the top of the rim and the thumb from my left hand on the bottom. I then do the same with my right hand about one inch to the right. I slide my right hand (still gripping the dough) toward my left hand, allowing the dough on top of the rim to peak.",
      "Once this is done, dip two fingers in water, place around one of the peaks and pull your fingers back and down onto the rim of the pie dish to seal the \"valleys\" of your dough to the pie dish. This prevents them from coming up when baking.",
      "For the lemon meringue pie, you need to pre-bake your pie crust a bit. The fork wholes at the bottom should prevent it from bubbling up. If you want, you can line the crust with parchment paper and put in some dry beans while baking it to help keep the shape.",
      "Bake at 400 for 20-25 minutes or until it starts turning brown. You'll be baking it for about another 10 minutes later, so you don't want it to get too brown.",

Drizzle the cut surfaces with the oil and season with a sprinkle of salt and pepper. Put the two halves back together to re-form the garlic head. Wrap tightly in aluminum foil. Bake until the garlic is tender and the cloves have turned golden beige, 35 to 45 minutes. Unwrap the garlic and let cool completely. Squeeze the garlic pulp out of the skins into a small bowl, discarding the skins.",
      "Using a fork, mash the garlic pulp until smooth. Stir in the ricotta, Parmigiano, and sour cream. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Let stand* for 30 minutes at room temperature to blend the flavors. (The dip can be prepared 1 day ahead, covered, and refrigerated. Let it come to room temperature before serving.)",
      "To make the chips: Using a mandoline or plastic V-slicer, cut the root vegetables as directed below. The slices should be almost paper-thin, less than 116 inch. As the vegetables are sliced, place each kind in a separate large bowl of cold water and let stand* for 30 minutes to remove excess starch.",

      "In separate batches, without crowding, deep-fry the vegetables, stirring often with a wire-mesh skimmer to separate the chips, until the chips are golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. (If you are frying beets, fry them last, as their color may leach into the oil.) Using the skimmer, transfer the chips to the wire racks to drain briefly, then move them to the roasting pan with paper towels to remove excess oil. Separate each new layer of chips with more paper towels. The chips will crisp as they cool, and are best served at room temperature within 6 hours of frying. Just before serving, sprinkle with salt and pepper, and serve with the ricotta dip."

      "OK, if you have time to make the puff pastry, then knock yourself out and go for it. Otherwise here's the speedier route.",
      "Step 1: In a large pot over a medium to high heat, cook the lamb, chillies, onion, salt, garam masala, ground coriander and chilli powder with the water until it reaches a rolling simmer and the meat has changed colour to a light brown; break up the mince to check there are no flashes of raw lamb. You should allow at least 15 minutes for this step of the process. Once cooked, pour the liquid away and leave the meat to cool. Ideally, cook the day before filling the pastry so the flavours intensify.",
      "Step 2: Roll the puff pastry out on a floured surface to a rectangle of 30cm x 40cm. Slice down the middle lengthways, ending up with two long pieces. Place the pieces on a large greased baking tray. Fill the middle of each the sheet lengthways with a generous portion of lamb, leaving enough pastry either side of the filling to fold over and envelope it. Seal the edge with a little milk, making sure none of the mixture escapes. Take a fork and lightly drag it in diagonal strokes across the top of the long pastry roll, then brush the surface with milk/egg whipped glaze and sprinkle the onion seeds over the top. Cut each strip into 7 or 8 individual parcels. Heat the oven to 180o/Gas 4.",
      "Step 3: Bake the lamb pastries for 15-20 minutes, turning the baking tin halfway through to allow the patties to cook evenly. Once the patties have a golden glaze and are puffed up, dish on to rack and allow them to rest for 10 minutes before serving these Indian style sausage rolls."

      "In the bowl of a standing mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the butter and shortening until ribbonlike. Turn the mixer to low and stream in the maple syrup. Increase the speed to medium-high and beat until the mixture is nearly uniform in color, about 3 minutes.",
      "Add the egg yolks and egg, one at a time, and beat until just incorporated. Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl. Add half of the flour mixture and mix on low speed until incorporated. Stream in the milk. Stop the mixer, add the rest of the flour, then turn the mixer on until just combined. Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl and fold in the walnuts.",
      "Fill the prepared cupcake pan about three-quarters full. Bake the cupcakes for 20 to 25 minutes, rotating the pans halfway through the baking time, until a toothpick inserted in the center of a cupcake comes out clean. Note: These cupcakes take longer to bake than traditional cupcakes due to the maple syrup.",
      "Allow the cupcakes to cool for 15 minutes in the cupcake pan, then turn them out onto wire racks to cool completely.",
      "Make the Cream Cheese Maple Frosting: In the bowl of a standing mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the softened butter until it is completely smooth. Add the cream cheese and beat until combined.",
      "Add the sugar and the maple syrup and beat until smooth. Be careful not to overbeat the frosting or it will lose structure. (At this point, if you want to, you can tightly cover the frosting and refrigerate it for a day. Let it soften at room temperature before using.).",
      "Assemble the Cupcakes: There are many ways to frost a cupcake. If you have a pastry bag, simply fit with the largest tip, fill the bag with frosting, and pipe enough to cover the cupcake in a big mound. If you do not have a pastry bag, use an ice cream scoop with a release mechanism to scoop the frosting and dispense it onto the top of the cupcake. You can also use an offset spatula to frost the cupcakes.",
      "Refrigerate any leftover cupcakes in an airtight container for up to 3 days. Bring cupcakes to room temperature before serving."

      "Remove and discard the mushroom stems(I put in freezer to make Recipe #397862-The End of All Things Vegetable Broth) and wipe the caps clean with a damp paper towel. Cut them into long slices about 1/2 \" thick and set aside.",
      "Place the nuts and cheese in a blender or food processor, and turn the machine on and off a few times until the nuts are ground to the consistency of cornmeal. Move the mixture to a plate, and stir in the salt, pepper, and garlic powder. Mix until thoroughly blended.",
      "Break the eggs into a shallow dish(such as a pie pan), and beat until smooth.",
      "Dip both sides of each mushroom strip in the beaten egg, then press the wet surfaces firmly into the nut mixture. Really push it in there, so a lot of the coating can stick to the mushrooms. Thick is good in this case! Move the coated mushrooms to another plate.",
      "Place a skillet or saute pan over medium heat and wait several minutes. Add a tbls. of the oil, and wait about 30 seconds, then swirl to coat the pan. When it is hot enough to sizzle a bread crumb, arrange the coated mushroom slices in the pan. They can be touching but should not overlap.",
      "Saute them about 5 minutes on each side, adding more oil if necessary. If some of the coating falls off, save and include it, it's delicious! When the mushrooms are golden all over, move to a wire rack over a tray to cool. This will retain their crispy texture.",
      "Serve hot, warm, or at room temperature, with a nice salsa on the side, if desired.",
      "Note:",
      "Milk or soy milk can replace some of the beaten egg, or use egg substitute.",
      "You can prepare the coated mushroom slices in the evening and store them overnight in a tightly covered container in the refrigerator. Frying them in the morning will then take less than 15 minutes.",
      "Alternative cooking method: Instead of sauteing them, spread the coated mushroom slices on a foil lined baking tray brushed or sprayed lightly with olive oil, and bake in a preheated 425*F. oven for 12-15 minutes. Turn the mushrooms over halfway through the baking."

      "Begin by making the soup. Rinse the lentils under running water. Then place them in a large pot and cover them with the 8 cups water. Bring to a boil and allow to simmer over medium heat for about 20 minutes. The lentils will be almost tender. Add the vegetables, bouillon or salt, garlic and black pepper Stir gently and allow the mixture to simmer for 20 minutes more. The vegetables and lentils wll both be tender. Taste and add salt if necessary.",
      "Now look over the amount of liquid in the pot. Add enough extra water so that all of the solids are well covered with liquid. They don't need to be swimming over their heads, but they should be wading up to their waists. Bring the mixture to a slow lazy simmer, not a boil. If the soup boils, it will cause the dumplings to disintegrate instead of cooking up into fluffy, glimmering jewels.",
      "While the soup is simmering, prepare your dumplings. Get out a big bowl. In it combine the oil, egg and milk until they are well blended. Add the flour, baking powder, salt and sugar. Mix it up to a stiff batter, like for drop biscuits. Set it aside until you need it.",
      "When the soup is simmering slowly, it is time to drop in the dumplings. Take small rounded scoops of the dough with a teaspoon and drop them into the simmering broth, on top of the vegetables. Keep dropping the dough blobs until you have scraped the bowl clean. Now cover the pot and let it simmer for 20 minutes. Do not peek. Let the dumplings simmer covered for the full 20 minutes. The thing about dumplings is that they cook partly from the soup and partly from the steam. The steam is what makes them fluffy, and the broth is what cooks them through. If you peek while the dumplings are cooking, they will turn into lumpy, doughy rocks. When the time is up, serve the soup and dumplings as soon as possible. The soup will be thickened and the dumplings will be light and fluffy."
