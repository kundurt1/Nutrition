      "Bring beef broth to a boil in a small saucepan over medium-high heat. Turn the heat off, and add the dried mushrooms. Set aside and allow mushrooms to absorb the moisture of the beef broth and the beef broth to absorb the flavor of the mushrooms, about 5 minutes.",
      "Heat a heavy bottom nonstick Dutch oven or stockpot with the canola oil over medium- high heat. Add the beef cubes, being careful not to overcrowd the pot. Sear the cubes on all sides until well browned. (Take your time on this step, because if you skimp or rush here, the stews flavor will suffer). Once browned, remove cubes and set aside. Drain any excess oil.",
      "Return the Dutch oven to medium-high heat and add the onions, carrot, parsnip, celery, garlic, and thyme. Saute until onions begin to caramelize. Once the onions have taken on a caramel color, add the tomato paste and mix well. Allow tomato paste to caramelize slightly, about 2 minutes or until it slightly darkens in color.",
      "Remove mushrooms from beef broth, allowing any accumulated sand to settle to the bottom of the saucepan. Chop mushrooms roughly and set aside.",
      "Pour beef broth through a coffee filter into a measuring cup. This will separate any accumulated sand from our flavorful broth. Set aside.",
      "Once the tomato paste has caramelized, sprinkle flour over the mixture and mix well, scraping the bottom. Stir for about 1 minute to cook out the flour flavor. Add the wine and scrape the bottom of the pot to loosen any vegetables that may have stuck. Pour in the beef broth and crushed tomatoes. Bring to a simmer for approximately 5 minutes or until stew thickens.",
      "Add the seared beef cubes and the mushrooms to the pot. Cover and simmer over medium-high heat until meat is tender, about 15 minutes. Stir in the red wine vinegar. Taste and adjust flavor with salt and pepper. Stir in parsley and remove from heat. Serve with Herbed Zucchini Noodles, instructions below.",
      "Carefully drag a vegetable peeler the length of the zucchini to create long strands. Discard centers with the seeds.",
      "Heat a large nonstick saute pan over medium heat with the butter. Add the zucchini and quickly toss to coat with the butter. Add parsley, thyme, oregano, and lemon pepper. Toss again and warm through, about 1 minute. Add the egg noodles. Toss once again until pasta is warmed through but zucchini remains crisp tender. Taste and adjust flavor with salt and pepper. Sprinkle with Parmesan. Toss again and serve warm."

Cream the butter with any remaining anchovies and smear it all over the surface of the meat. Grind over plenty of black pepper. Place the lamb in a roasting tin and pour the wine around. Tuck in any leftover sprigs of rosemary and pour over the lemon juice. Put in the oven and roast for 15 minutes.",

Simmer sprouts until the outer leaves are bright green and just barely crisp-tender (can stick a fork into one without going all the way through easily). The amount of time this takes will vary depending on the starting temperature of the sprouts, but usually takes about 6 - 10 minutes. Drain and rinse sprouts with cold water to stop cooking; allow to drain again thoroughly.",
      "While the sprouts are boiling, wash and trim leeks, and chop into roughly 1/4-inch segments. You can include the dark green tops if you want, but they sometimes add a bitter taste, so we usually just use the light colored part of the stalk.",
      "Chop the butter into roughly half-inch lumps. In a large frying pan (we use one of those giant saute/wok pans), melt the butter over medium heat. When butter is almost melted, add the sliced leeks and saute until they begin to soften. In breaks between stirring, cut the thinly-sliced prosciutto into roughly 1/4-inch strips, and add to the leeks. Takes about 4 minutes.",
      "Add the drained Brussels sprouts to the pan with the butter, leeks, and prosciutto; saute over medium to medium-high heat until thoroughly heated, stirring frequently, until sprouts are soft and tender. How long takes depends on your crisp to tender ratio preference (I like them slightly on the crisp side, my husband likes them very thoroughly cooked); in general, it takes about 6 to 10 minutes, depending on how cold they were and how much you have when they went into the pan.",
      "Serve warm. (This is a dish that, if you don't mind very soft Brussels sprouts, will tolerate being kept warm covered on the stove or in the oven for half an hour or so, but we usually cook it as one of the last elements of the feast.)."

Add them and saute 4-5 minutes until soft. Remember they won't cook much in the oven and you want most of the water cooked out of them. They also should be set to the side, drained and cooled. You don't want extra water in the calzone to make it soggy.",
      "Crust -- Just roll out your pizza dough. Pillsbury comes in a rectangle so roll out as flat as you can make it. Add a little flour to your counter top or cutting board so the dough doesn't stick. I like ro roll out with a rolling pin to get in even and spread out. It should be about 13x9, each can or 14 oz of dough. Then with a 6\" bowl right from your kitchen cabinet -- press down on the crust to make as many calzones as possible. This recipe will make right about 8 for both rolls. Any left over crust, just add all together and press down again to maybe get one more calzone.",
      "Stuffing -- Add some of the cooled meat, then the vegetables and cheese. Now put a little water on your finger and moisten 1/2 the edge of each circle. Then fold the circle over to make a half circle. The water will just make it stick together good. Press together well to seal and then use a fork to press the edges down even more and make a nice decorative edge.",
      "Bake -- Brush a little olive oil if you want on the calzones to make a crisp crust (optional). Transfer the calzones to a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper or foil and bake at 450 for about 15 minutes until golden brown. One batch I made took 20 the other 15 so, just keep an eye of them. Serve with a good Marinara.",
      "And remember, any mix of fillings, broccoli, ham, cheese; bacon, cheddar and onion; or chicken, spinach and mozzarella. Just think what is left in your fridge. Six dollars for pizza dough and marinara and you can make a great use of leftovers and with some soup in your freezer, you have a whole new dinner."

Line a mini muffin pan with mini muffin papers, and spray with extra virgin olive oil spray. Alternatively, grease mini muffin wells very well with coconut oil. Pour batter almost to the top of mini muffin cups. Rap muffin tin gently on the counter to pop air bubbles. Bake for 18-20 minutes, until springy and firm to the touch. You might have to bake these longer since my oven in this apartment runs hot. Remove cakes from muffin tins as soon as they are cool to the touch, and cool on a wire rack. Dip cakes into glaze.

      "Sauce -- Add the sherry, to deglaze the pan slightly, then the chicken broth and mix well. Cook 30 minutes on a low simmer until the potatoes fall apart.",
      "My trick -- Instant potato flakes. Rather than corn starch in soups to thicken -- I love potato flakes. Just add them in, nothing more. A instant light thickening with some taste. I like to add 1/4-1/2 cup. Just add to the broth and it will slightly thicken without a fake corn starch or flour taste.",
      "Finish -- Add the heavy cream to finish it off. Just heat and season with any salt and pepper to taste.",

      "Well worth making it. A bowl of this, a salad, a fresh tomato panini anything. So good and comforting."

      "Heat the milk to 88 degrees over medium-low heat. The milk will begin to curdle. (A NOTE that I found -- The bit about milk not curdling at 88F is wrong, since it curdles just fine at 68-72F for chevre, and 88F is a standard setting temp for cheddar cheese. When I make cheese from my raw farm milk this is where I set it to coagulate. I may raise the temp a bit due to high buttterfat or other seasonal changes to get the whey out but not by much. However, if you are using store-bought milk, we do find that it needs to be heated a bit higher for coagulation (93-97F) after setting, and then a bit more after that to release the whey.).",
      "Gently stir in the diluted rennet with an up-and-down motion for 30 seconds. Then let the milk sit still while heating it to between 100 and 105 degrees. In about 5 to 8 minutes, the curds should be pulling away from the sides of the pot. Turn off the heat.",
      "The curds will look like thick yogurt and have a bit of shine to them, and the whey will be clear. If the whey is still milky white, wait a few more minutes before turning off the heat. Scoop out the curds with a slotted spoon and put into a 2-quart microwavable bowl. Press the curds gently with your hands, pouring off as much whey as possible.",
      "Microwave the curds on high for 1 minute. (Without a Microwave follows below.).",
      "Drain off all excess whey. Gently fold the cheese over and over (as in kneading bread) with your hand or a spoon. This distributes the heat evenly throughout the cheese, which will not stretch until it is too hot to touch (145 degrees inside the curd). You may want to don rubber gloves at this point, as the cheese will be extremely hot to the touch.",
      "Microwave two more times for 35 seconds each; add salt to taste after the second time. After each heating, knead again to distribute the heat.",
      "Knead quickly until it is smooth and elastic. When the cheese stretches like taffy, it's done. If the curds break instead of stretch, they are too cool and need to be reheated.",
      "When the cheese is smooth and shiny, roll it into small balls and eat while warm. Or place them in a bowl of ice water for half an hour to bring the inside temperature down rapidly; this will produce a consistent smooth texture throughout the cheese. Although best eaten fresh, it can be stored in the refrigerator at this point.",
      "Note: If you are using store-bought milk, and your curds turn into the consistency of ricotta cheese and will not come together, switch brands of milk. It may have been heated at the factory at too high a temperature.",
