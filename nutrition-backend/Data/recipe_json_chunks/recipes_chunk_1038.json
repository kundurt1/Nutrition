      "Place the milk, 2 cups of flour, and yeast in the bread machine pan and process on the dough setting. (Mine takes around 1.5 hours).",
      "While the machine is working (no rush here - you have plenty of time) mix the other 2 cups of flour with the sugar, salt, orange zest, and the anise seed. (I couldn't find ground anise seed so I ground some up in my blender. A coffee grinder would work as well).",
      "Once the dough cycle is completed, add the flour mixture, olive oil, and eggs. Process again on the dough setting. (Another 1.5 hours! But for me, this is preferable to doing it by hand. My handmade dough ends up like a brick).",
      "Once the second cycle is completed, remove the dough to a well-floured surface. Punch down and form into a ball. (This is easy! I was scared because this is where I get into trouble - I tend to overwork things. Look it up on YouTube if you don't know how: http://youtu.be/5HW38Bn-hnI).",
      "Cover and let the dough rest for 15 minutes. (I left it on the counter top and covered it with paper towels).",
      "Now, divide the dough into three parts. Roll each piece into a rope and braid, working from the center to the ends. Pinch the ends together and turn under. (Once again, if you don't know how: http://youtu.be/YR6aIAh2Vt8 And if you don't feel like braiding it at all - I won't tell. It tastes wonderful no matter what the shape).",
      "Embed the dyed eggs (optional) in the folds of the braid. Cover and let the dough rise until doubled in bulk - about 1 hour.",
      "Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. (Note: Mine came out a little dark on top so I'm gonna try 350 degrees next time.) Once the dough has risen, brush it lightly with the egg wash. (I sprinkled some whole anise seeds on top, but you don't have to do that. Some people use slivered almonds, but my family has allergies).",
      "Bake in the preheated oven for 40 to 45 minutes or until golden brown. (I slid the parchment paper directly onto a preheated pizza stone. My bread came out a little dark on the top, next time I'll drape some foil paper over it around 15 minutes in).",
      "Cool on a rack. Store in a brown bag for up to 3 days. (When it starts getting stale - if it lasts that long - you can make french toast with it. I recommend this recipe: http://www.food.com/recipe/dennys-style-french-toast-90674 So good!)."

Now coat in parmesan cheese. Press it into the meat so it's literally totally white. Let stand about an hour to bring meat to room temperature and get the grill ready. Sear the roast and do not move for about 5-7 minutes. This is important to do on all sides -- If you move it, the seasonings will fall off and you want to achieve a crispy crust on the meat. Grill to desired doneness. It's best medium! let rest covered with foil for 10-15 minutes. Slice across the grain. Enjoy!"

Push the stems of whole cloves into the surface of the fruit so their edges just barely touch. {I find it helpful to just break the surface with a small knitting needle first}. The fruit will shrink as it dries, so there has to be some space between the cloves. Leave the indentations around the stem and blossom, since they will recede into the fruit as the pomander dries. Place the pomander in a dry place with good air circulation [away from direct sun]. Each day, roll it very gently in your palms to push the cloves into the drying fruit. When the fruit is partly dry, push a bent wire or hairpin [I find that florist pins work especially well] into the stem end to form a hanging loop. When the pomander is thoroughly dry, tie a bow to the loop.",

      "If you are using the 16-ounce packages of tofu, set a wire mesh strainer over a bowl. Put the tofu in the strainer, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for 24 hours. It is important to choose a bowl that allows the strainer to sit above the liquid that will accumulate. (Draining the excess liquid helps reduce any bean flavor and creates a thicker cream.) If you are using tofu in the 12.3-ounce aseptic boxes, just drain the liquid from the boxes and proceed with the recipe.",
      "Combine the tofu, oil, and salt in a food processor, and process about 1 minute until pureed. Use a rubber spatula to clean the sides of the bowl and add the sugar, cocoa, and vanilla. Process 1 to 2 minutes, until the tofu mixture is smooth.",
      "Add the melted chocolate and pulse the processor three or four times to incorporate. Process 1 to 2 minutes until the mixture is very creamy. Give it a little taste; if it is not sweet enough for you, gradually add up to 1/2 cup powdered sugar, adding soymilk in tablespoons if it gets too thick, until it reaches desired sweetness. Refrigerate in the processor for 20 minutes. If you used the aseptic boxes of tofu, the cream may need to chill for 1 to 6 hours in order for it to become firm enough to spread.",
      "The degree of firmness will determine the amount of soymilk needed to create the final texture. It should be thick but easy to spread. Dip an icing spatula into the cream to test to the texture. If the cream is too stiff to use, add 3 tablespoons of the soymilk and process 1 minute. Add more soymilk, 1 tablespoon at a time as needed. When the cream is ready to use, spoon it into a bowl and begin to assemble the cake.",
