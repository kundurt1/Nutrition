Lightly brush or spray chicken with vegetable oil, then season inside and out with the rub mixture. Open the can of beer and pour out half. Set the half full can of beer on a flat surface and slide the chicken over the top so the can fits inside the cavity. Transfer the bird to the grill, keeping the can upright. Grill over indirect medium heat 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 hours or until the chicken juices run clear and the internal temperature reaches 170\u00b0 in the breast and 180\u00b0 in the thickest part of the thigh. Wearing barbecue mitts, carefully remove the chicken and beer can from the grill. Be careful not to spill the beer since it will be hot. Let the chicken set for about 10 minutes before lifting it from the can. Discard beer. Cut chicken into serving pieces. Serve warm. Makes 4 to 6 servings."
