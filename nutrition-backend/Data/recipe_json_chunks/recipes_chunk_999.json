      "Basic Pasta Recipe: Start with the flour - measure and just place all of it in a nice mound on your clean countertop. Using your fingers, make a hole in the middle of the mound, and form a well large enough to hold 4 eggs. Crack eggs, one by one into the well. 2. Now its time to use your fork. Start in the middle of the egg mixture and gently beat the eggs. Be careful - don't let the walls break down! Keep beating the eggs, incorporating the flour a little at a time. Keep going until it becomes thick. Now with your fork, start stirring in the flour. Great - you're almost there. When it gets to the point where you can't use the fork anymore, use your palms and knead, adding more flour if it gets too sticky. You might not use all your flour, thats ok. Knead for 8-10 minutes more, until the dough is smooth. Cover with plastic wrap and let it rest while you prepare the roasted vegetables.",
      "Roasted Vegetable Ravioli with Crispy Pancetta: Roast the Veggies: Preheat oven to 375. Cut each vegetable into smaller pieces. The more tender veggies (zucchini) can be cut into larger chunks. Hard vegetables (carrots) into smaller chunks. Basically, you want all the vegetables to roast evenly. Roast 10-15 minutes, until soft. Remove from oven, place in food processor. In food processor (or you could just chop with your knife like I do) - pulse 4-5 times until the vegetables are 1/4&#8243; small dice (still a little chunky but not a puree). You want the vegetables to still have some texture. Add parmigiano reggiano, garlic, olive oil, salt and pepper. Pulse one more time to incorporate rest of ingredients. Set aside.",
      "Roll the Pasta: Divide the pasta dough into 4 equal parts. Cover whatever dough you are not using with damp towel or plastic wrap. You are going to use 1 portion of the dough at a time and keep the rest covered. Using your KitchenAid with pasta attachment OR the pasta hand-crank, roll pasta dough to about 1 mm thick - usually to the second to last setting on pasta machine. Sheets should be about 6&#8243; wide x 30&#8243; long. Dust sheets with extra flour if it feels a little sticky. Set sheets aside, cover.",
      "Make the Ravioli: Using a 1T sized measuring spoon, scoop scant tablespoon of vegetable mixture onto the pasta sheet - leaving about 1 1/2 inch between each spoonful. Brush egg wash on edges and in between the spoonfuls. Place another pasta sheet on top, pressing lightly on the edges in between -try to get as much air out as possible. Use a small knife, pizza cutter or pleated ravioli cutter to cut the ravioli into nice, even squares, about 2-1/2&#8243; square. Make sure each has a tight seal - if the ravioli is not sealed, the filling will leak out and your ravioli will be ruined. Place each ravioli onto a baking sheet, dusting with flour to avoid them sticking to each other. Repeat until you use all the pasta sheets. Take a 8qt stockpot filled with 6qts of water and 1 T salt; boil. While water is boiling, make the sauce.",
      "Make the Sauce: Heat a large saute pan over medium-high heat. When hot, add the slices of pancetta. Cook pancetta until crisp. Remove pancetta with tongs to plate and crumble. (leave the pan drippings in the pan!) Keep the heat on the pan and add the garlic. Fry 15 seconds. Add the chicken stock and wine, scraping up the bits in the pan. Add corn kernals. Simmer on low until sauce is reduced by half, about 5 minutes. Add lemon juice into the sauce. Turn off heat and set aside.",
      "Boil the Ravioli: Slip ravioli into the boiling water. Return to boil, immediately turn heat to medium low. Cook ravioli in gently boiling water for another 3-4 minutes, until pasta is tender (fish a ravioli out and test to see if corner is done). Drain. Serve with the sauce, top with crumbled pancetta and freshly grated Parmigiano Reggiano."

      "Ricotta -- First step is to make your ricotta which - seriously makes itself. It is so easy. You will need a heavy bottomed pot or strainer or colander, cheese cloth and a big bowl. Step 1: Set up your colander over a large bowl. Make sure there is plenty of room in the bowl for the liquid to drain. Take 2 pieces of damp cheese cloth and line the colander. Step 2: In a medium to large pot, bring the milk, cream and salt to a rolling boil on medium heat stirring often. Once it is boiling add in the vinegar and immediately remove from the heat and stir. The vinegar will cause the milk and cream to separate and form curds. Stir a couple of times, wait 2-3 minutes, and then pour it into the strainer or colander on top of the cheese cloth. You will see the whey or clear liquid separate from the milk curds and drain to the bottom of the bowl. Let it rest at room temp for about 15-20 minutes to cool before you put it in the refrigerator. Just make sure as it sets in the refrigerator that none of the liquid in the bowl is touching the bottom of the ricotta. Make sure to cover the ricotta with saran wrap. Personally, I like to let mine set over night, but at least 4 hours to cool down and set.",
      "Tomatoes -- I like to have these chilled rather than hot, so I make these ahead of time too. Couldn't be easier. Oven at 425, line a baking sheet with aluminum foil or parchment paper and add the tomatoes. Drizzle with olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Bake for approximately 10 minutes until they begin to soften, but not falling apart. Let cool, transfer to a plate and cover. Done!",
      "Herbed Topping -- Add the ricotta, lemon zest and juice, scallions, herbs, salt and pepper. Mix well and set to the side. I prefer to make this right before I serve.",
      "Baguettes -- Some people bake them on a high temp in the oven, personally, I prefer to broil mine. They take only a minute or two and it is easy. I line a baking sheet with foil or parchment paper and add the baguette slices. Drizzle with olive oil and broil the first side. Once golden brown, flip and broil just another minute until brown. Remove and rub the garlic on the side you drizzled with olive oil. That is the side you will add the toppings to. The garlic is optional, but I think it gives it a great taste.",
      "Finish -- Top each of the baguette with a little of the arugula (optional), then a spoon of the ricotta and a tomato slice. ENJOY!",
      "Prep time doesn't include the chilling of the ricotta."

      "Mix on low with an electric mixer, when ingredients are moistened, mix on high for 3 minutes.",
      "For the yellow cake, use a 9X13\", greased pan for baking.",
      "Bake at 350* for 40 minute.",
      "Use caution, this type of cake can fall if it is disturbed early.",
      "For the strawberry cake, divide the batter evenly between 2 8\", greased, loaf pans.",
      "I am unsure of the baking time for the loaf pans, I would carefully check them at 30 minutes and add time accordingly.",
      "Doneness of the cakes can be tested with a toothpick poked in the center to see if it comes out dry or wet.",
      "After cakes have cooled, remove from pans and freeze at least 3 hours for easy in cutting and shaping.",
      "MAKE THE FROSTING:",
      "Using Caryn's 7 Minute Frosting recipe, you will need at least one and half batches; you can make two full batches if you want, but I don't think it is necessary.",
      "For each batch of frosting, add the appropriate amount of sugar, water, egg whites, corn syrup and salt in the top of a double boiler (I use a heat proof glass mixing bowl on top of a sauce pan as I don't have a double boiler).",
      "Blend.",
      "Place over simmering water.",
      "With an electric mixer, beat the mixture constantly at high speed for 7 minutes or until the mixture triples in volume and holds firm peaks.",
      "Remove from heat add the appropriate amount of vanilla and the appropriate food color for either a full recipe or a half recipe.",
      "Frosting can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator until ready to use.",
      "BUILD THE YELLOW BRICK ROAD:",

      "Now carefully cut the top layer in half vertically.",
      "Cut the top layer in half again, this time from the other side of the cake.",
      "The top layer is now cut into four equal rectangles.",

      "Replace the rectangles and frost top and sides with the remaining yellow frosting.",
      "If you like, use an accent color \"draw\" the lines of the bricks on top of the frosting - I did this, but I don't think it added to the over all affect.",
      "CARVE AND FROST THE RUBY SLIPPERS:",
      "On a piece of paper about 8 1/2 inches long by 4 inches wide draw the rough shape of the sole of a shoe; this is your pattern, make sure your drawing is not bigger than the loaf, it should go to the edges of the loaf.",

      "Round the edges.",
      "Carve out a shallow indentation in the top 1/3 that is still level to create the mouth of the shoe.",
      "If necessary, freeze again for an hour to make frosting easier.",
      "Turn an 8x8\" baking dish upside down; this is to get the shoe higher up so the edges can be more easily frosted and sugared.",
      "Place the long, narrow spatula on top of the baking dish.",
      "Put the shoe cake on top of the spatula, the heel of the shoe should be near the handle (pic 4).",
      "Frost with red frosting.",
      "Sprinkle with red sugar.",
      "Now the tricky part, with one hand begin to lift the shoe with the long spatula.",
      "If necessary, use another spatula to help lift the other end.",
      "Slowly and carefully place the shoe on the yellow brick road so the toe and heel are going in the long (13\") direction of the cake-you pretty much only have one shot at this.",
      "Repeat with second loaf cake (see pic 5).",
      "Add wording or accent frosting if you choose (see pic 6).",
      "Refrigerate if you do not plan on serving the cake for several hours - or days.",
      "I suggest making this cake at the house where it will be served; I only had to drive 7 miles with the one I made, but it was uphill and winding; the shoes are just balanced on top, so it was a nerve racking drive! I don't think I breathed the whole way.",

    "title": "pistachio baklava with cardamom and rose water",
    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      ". For the sugar syrup: Combine syrup ingredients, except rosewater, in small saucepan and bring to full boil over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally to ensure that sugar dissolves. Transfer to 2-cup measuring cup and set aside to cool while making and baking baklava; when syrup is cool, discard peppercorns and stir in rosewater. (Cooled syrup can be refrigerated in airtight container up to 4 days.).",
      "Nut filling: Pulse pistachios in food processor until very finely chopped, about fifteen 1-second pulses; transfer to bowl. Measure out 1 tablespoon nuts and set aside for garnish. Add ground cardamom, sugar, and salt; toss well to combine.",
      "To assemble and bake: Brush 13- by 9-inch traditional (not nonstick) baking pan with butter. Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 300 degrees. Unwrap and unfold phyllo on large cutting board; carefully smooth with hands to flatten. Using baking pan as guide, cut sheets crosswise with chef's knife, yielding two roughly evenly sized stacks of phyllo (one may be narrower than other). Cover with plastic wrap, then damp kitchen towel to prevent drying.",
      "Place one phyllo sheet (from wider stack) in bottom of baking pan and brush until completely coated with butter. Repeat with 7 more phyllo sheets (from wider stack), brushing each with butter.",
      "Evenly distribute about 1 cup nuts over phyllo. Cover nuts with phyllo sheet (from narrower stack) and dab with butter (phyllo will slip if butter is brushed on). Repeat with 5 more phyllo sheets (from narrower stack), staggering sheets slightly if necessary to cover nuts, and brushing each with butter. Repeat layering with additional 1 cup nuts, 6 sheets phyllo, and remaining 1 cup nuts. Finish with 8 to 10 sheets phyllo (from wider stack), using nicest and most intact sheets for uppermost layers and brushing each except final sheet with butter. Following illustration 6, use palms of hands to compress layers, working from center outward to press out any air pockets. Spoon 4 tablespoons butter on top layer and brush to cover all surfaces. Following illustration 7, use bread knife or other serrated knife with pointed tip in gentle sawing motion to cut baklava into diamonds, rotating pan as necessary to complete cuts. (Cut on bias into eighths on both diagonals.).",
      "Bake until golden and crisped, about 1 1/2 hours, rotating baking pan halfway through baking. Immediately after removing baklava from oven, pour cooled syrup over cut lines until about 2 tablespoons remain (syrup will sizzle when it hits hot pan); drizzle remaining syrup over surface. Garnish center of each piece with pinch of reserved ground nuts. Cool to room temperature on wire rack, about 3 hours, then cover with foil and let stand at least 8 hours before serving. (Once cooled, baklava can be served, but flavor and texture improve if left to stand at least 8 hours. Baklava can be wrapped tightly in foil and kept at room temperature up to 10 days.)."

I wouldn't get anything spiced like a pumpkin or holiday ale, because the spices in the beer may not play well with the spices in the apple sauce -- Really Duvel is perfect -- It is a \"Belgian Golden Ale\" -- there are others. Also an Imperial Pilsner might work as well -- Don't bother using Bud or a light beer -- you may as well use water."

Try to get as much filling in as possible, letting it over flow from the ends. Place the filled shell into the sauce-lined dish. Repeat with the remaining manicotti shells, and fill the dish with the stuffed shells, until you either run out of room, or shells or filling.
