We ran out most of the time. Just an idea of how much we used to feed a football stadium full of people, most of whom were hungry pre-teen boys. The above recipe would be a good amount for a teenagers birthday party."

Add the cream cheese, butter, sour cream, and vanilla and pulse just until the mixture begins to form a ball around the blades. Do not overprocess. Transfer the dough to a work surface and knead lightly and quickly into a smooth, compact roll. (Or prepare manually: In a large bowl, quickly mix together the cream cheese, butter, sour cream, and vanilla until well blended. Gradually add the flour, salt, and sugar. Knead the mixture lightly until thoroughly combined and smooth.).",
      "Divide the dough into 4 equal parts. Put each piece between two sheets of wax paper and flatten into a large oblong using the palm of your hand. If necessary, refrigerate briefly until the dough is firm enough to roll.",
      "Work with one oblong at a time, keeping the others refrigerated. Roll the oblong between the wax paper into a 12-by-7-inch rectangle, about 1/8 inch thick. Leaving the dough in the wax paper, refrigerate for at least 4 hours or up to 2 days. Repeat with the other 3 rectangles.",
      "Loosen the wax paper from both sides of the dough. (The paper becomes pressed into the dough with rolling and will be difficult to remove after you cut the dough unless it has been loosened first.) Place the dough rectangle back down on a sheet of the wax paper, and sprinkle it all over with 2 table-spoons brown sugar. Now cut the rectangle in half. You should have two 6-by-7-inch sections. Cut each section into 4 equal strips, giving you 8 in all. Leaving a 1/2 inch border, place some caramel pieces and pecans over each dough strip (be generousa\"the more caramels, the more luscious the taste). If your caramels are soft enough, press the pieces with your fingertips to flatten them. You'll get a smoother, tighter roll. Roll each strip up tightly, jelly-roll fashion, and place seam side down, about I inch apart, on a baking sheet lined with parchment. (If the dough becomes too soft to work with during the rolling or filling, place it on a lined cookie sheet in the freezer until firm again.) Refrigerate the prepared rugelach while you make rugelach with the rest of the dough. The prepared rugelach should be refrigerated for at least 30 minutes before you bake them.",
      "Preheat the oven to 375\u00b0F Bake in the middle of the oven for about 20 minutes, or until pale golden. If necessary, adjust the pans during baking so the rugelach cook evenly. Transfer the pan to a rack and let the rugelach cool completely. Remove the rugelach carefully with a thin-bladed spatula. Store the rugelach in airtight containers for up to 4 days."

Sprinkle mixture inside the closed springform ring and press down into a solid 1/2\" disk. Smooth with the back of a spoon. Use a 2\" round cookie cutter to remove the center of the disk of dough - this allows for dough to bake evenly so center is not undercooked. Remove 2\" circle of dough and replace cookie cutter so that the shortbread does not spread into that area. Also release the lock on the springform ring, allowing for dough to spread outward slightly during the baking process. Bake for 5 minutes only at 450 degress, then turn heat down to 250 degrees and bake for 10 to 15 minutes, until the top barely becomes golden. Turn oven OFF, but it should remain closed. Take springform ring and cookie cutter off of dough. Using a large, sharp knife, score the dough into wedges HALF WAY through the dough. Also poke each wedge with a skewer 8 to 10 times to release steam. Return to over that is turned OFF, with a wooden spoon keeping the door slightly ajar. Cookie should remain in the oven for 1 hour.

      "Set up your charcoal grill for the indirect method, using trays or rails, and it is important to use a grilling rack to prevent grill marks form scoring the roast. I can place two roast at time on one rack. If you place it directly on the grill, you'll need a drip pan, as it will lose liquid. Keep the grill cover on.",
      "Grill for 20 minutes (covered) and turn once, and check temperature after 40 minutes. My Weber grill has a thermometer, and I keep it between 375-425 during the first half hour.",
      "If you've achieved a good salt seal, the roast changes shape, expanding within its salt-sealed layer, sometimes like a \"pillow.\" Tri tip roasts are an unattractive looking roast coming out of the cryo-bags, but as the fat melts off, and the smoke and salt do their trick, you end up with some attractice colors, some small burnt edges, and appealing shapes. If you do all six roast for a party of 40, each roast will be different in size and shape and color.",
      "I remove at 135, and after it rests for 10 minutes, it's ready for slicing. There will be a great deal of liquid, and depending on the roast, easily a 1/2 cup or more. Have a deeply grooved cutting board.",
      "Pay particular attention to the changing directions of grains with this roast when you're slicing--and this is important for parties, and for guests that want to help. Remember to slice across the \"grain\" throughout, and keep slices small and thin so that they work well on small sandwiches or rye bread slices. (This is important for nearly every beef roast)."

      "Standard method (by hand): In a medium bowl, stir together the flour and salt with a table fork. Taste it for salt. If you feel you need a little more, now is the time to add it. Dump the coconut oil into the middle of it and, before you do anything else, fill the cup you used for the coconut oil half way with ice, then add water until it is almost full. You want to give enough time for the water to get ice cold.",
      "Still using the same fork, cut the coconut oil into the flour mixture until it is in almost microscopic pieces. You want them to be very small and well integrated into the flour. At this point, pour just a couple of tablespoons of water into the flour mixture. Working quickly and lightly with the same fork, gently mix the water into just the section of the dough that the water hit when it went into the bowl. Add a couple of more tablespoons of water (just estimate with your eyes) in to another section of the flour mixture in the bowl and quickly mix it inches You may need to add more water to your ice in your cup.",
      "At this point, the dough may be trying to hold together a bit, and that's a good thing. Continue to work little bits of water in until the dough just starts to hold together fairly well when you press it with your hands.",
      "If you have a food processor, the process is even easier: Instead of mixing in a bowl, put the flour and salt into your processor with the blades attached and pulse to combine them. Unplug, then taste for salt (you don't want to whack your fingers off!). Now add in the coconut oil and fill the cup it was in with ice and water. While the water chills, pulse the coconut into the flour mixture until you can't see any chunks anymore. Adding just a tablespoon or two at a time, pulse the water into the flour mixture. When it just begins to hold together, you are ready to shape it.",
      "At this point, regardless of the mixing method, turn the dough out onto a floured surface, keeping the water nearby. Roll the dough out, aiming for a round-ish shape. Be prepared- it is probably going to crumble a bit. That is what the remaining water is for. Use the cold water as glue to hold pieces of dough together and continue flouring (to keep it from sticking to the rolling pin) and rolling until the dough is the thickness and size you want for your pie plate. You don't want to over-roll, as handling it too much will toughen it, but do roll it wide enough for about an inch of hangover on the sides once it is in the pan.",
      "Gently fold the dough around the rolling pin and use it to transfer the dough to the pie plate. Carefully press the dough into the bottom of the plate and shape the edge of your crust however you want (I usually roll mine under and pinch it to seal and make a pretty edge). It's probably not going to look picture-perfect, but this is the sign of a homemade crust.",
      "Continue on with whichever your recipe you are making. This works as well for a quiche or pot pie as it does for a dessert pie.",
      "If you have leftover pie crust, roll it out again and cut it into short strips (shape does not matter). Sprinkle with cane sugar and cinnamon and bake in the oven at 375 for 8-10 minutes, or until light brown. If you have small children this is a great time to give them your already dusty cutting board and rolling pin, along with some cookie cutters and whatever else you trust them with, and let them make their own \"pie crust cookies\". You don't need to worry about them nibbling dough, as there is nothing in this that will really hurt them. (Although they may not be hungry for dinner.) My kids used to have a lot of fun doing this! I would always bake their creations and let them have them as a special treat."

I continue to blend, moving the blender up and down and around the beaker, for about 30 seconds after all the oil has been incorporated, because I like my mayo to be thick.",

You can also experiment with using blends of different oils.",

      "TO MAKE LACTO-FERMENTED MAYO:",

Make the mayo as usual, but when you are finished, leave it to sit out at room temperature for 7 hours before putting it in the fridge. Mayo made this way will last in the fridge for 6 months. I like to use an oil blend in my lacto-fermented mayonnaise - I use 1/3 macadamia nut oil, 1/3 almond oil, and 1/3 extra virgin olive oil.",
      "TO MAKE WHEY: buy a container of plain whole fat yogurt - make sure it is true plain yogurt, no sugars or anything else added. Also, you DO NOT want \"Greek\" style yogurt - this yogurt has already been strained and has had most of its whey removed already. Wet some cheesecloth, wring it out, and place it in a strainer over a bowl. Pour in the yogurt, cover with plastic wrap, and let sit on the counter overnight or for 8 hours. The resulting liquid is whey. Place the whey in a sealed container in the fridge - it will keep for up to 6 months. You can eat the concentrated yogurt cheese which is left behind.",
      "TO PASTEURIZE EGG YOLKS: Gather 3 whisks or forks. Place the egg yolks in a small bowl and use the first whisk or fork to combine the egg yolks with 1 tablespoon lemon juice. Add 2 tablespoons of water to the egg yolk mixture and whisk again. Seal the bowl with plastic wrap and place in the microwave. Heat the egg mixture on high until the surface begins to rise. Once you see this, cook for 8 more seconds, then immediately remove the bowl and whisk the yolks vigorously with a CLEAN whisk. Re-cover the bowl and immediately return to the microwave and heat on high again until the surface begins to rise. Continue for 8 more seconds, then remove and whisk vigourously with the third CLEAN whisk until the mixture is smooth and creamy. The yolks are now safe to use in mayonnaise or other raw-egg preparations. *If making the mayo with the pasturized egg yolks, use only 1 cup of oil - they cannot absorb as much oil as the unpasteurized yolks.*."

This dough is very wet and if you don't use enough flour on your work surface the dough is going to stick.

      "Prep:",
      "Start by making the cauliflower noodles. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees (Fahrenheit). Remove the leaves and core from a head of cauliflower and start chopping the cauli into small pieces. I use my knife, but you can certainly do this in a food processor. My cauliflower yielded 6 cups, shoot for that on your end so that the egg ratio is close.",
      "The cauliflower pieces need to be steamed; use whatever contraption you prefer. Stove-top or microwave makes no difference to me... I covered and microwaved for several minutes (about 6) until it was cooked but not total mush.",
      "When hot, use a potato masher or pastry cutter to break down the cauliflower. Cauliflower releases a fair amount of liquid while it cooks, so try to drain off what you can. Then add the seasonings and combine. Add the eggs last and either continue using the masher to combine or grab a spatula... whatever works for you.",
      "I am addicted to my silicone baking sheet and definitely recommend it, although basic parchment paper works as well, I'm told. There is no added fat (other than egg) to the cauliflower, so the sticking potential is high. Be sure to use one of the two. Spread the cauliflower dough/batter onto a large silicone baking sheet. You have to eyeball whatever baking dish you plan to use for the lasagna and think how large to spread out the cauliflower so that when you cut it in two large sections, the layers will fit squarely in the baking dish. Obviously you won't be preparing a 10x13-sized casserole dish with only 6 cups of cauliflower, so make necessary adjustments. The dish I used is your basic oval 2.8 liter corning ware baker, about 8\" x 11\" x 3\". The picture below shows a standard-sized cookie sheet (American 17\" x 12\") and the cauli was about a half inch thick.",
      "Bake the cauliflower for 45 minutes at 350 degrees. It needs to be a little overcooked and dried out since it will be soon layered with tomato saucy goodness.",
      "While the cauliflower is in the oven, we need to make the bolognese.",
      "Classic bolognese starts with mirepoix (carrot, onion and celery) and that's what we're going to do here. Heat a large or wide pan to medium or medium-high. This can be a dutch oven or even a large skillet. Drizzle in a couple tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil... enough to lightly coat the bottom of the pan.",
      "While that comes to temp, peel and chop the carrots, dice the onion and the celery. Add those to the hot pan and sprinkle with the kosher salt and other seasonings. It will look kinda strange if you're not in the habit of building sauces in this order, but roll with it. This method gets the oils going and rehydrates the dried herbs before the tomatoes hit. Saute for about 4-5 minutes, then add minced garlic and the sausage. Cook until the sausage has browned. The canned diced tomatoes, tomato sauce and chicken stock now joins the party. Stir and simmer for 15 minutes or so on medium-low heat. Cover if your sauce starts to dry out (or if it's splattering everywhere and making a mess of your stove).",
      "When the cauliflower \"noodle\" has finished cooking, remove from oven and transfer to a large cutting board or work surface. Depending on the size and shape of your lasagne pan and thus the size and shape of your cauli noodle, divide into two sections that will perfectly layer your lasagne. Remove the bolognese from the heat and grab your baking dish.",

Using tongs remove the ramekins from the water and set on a towel to cool for at least 2 hours before serving. Once cooled completely, the flan can be refrigerated for up to 3 days before un-molding and serving. To serve, run a thin knife around the inside edge of the ramekin to loosen the flan, and then invert onto a plate."

      "Combine the warm water, sugar and kosher salt in the bowl of a stand mixer and sprinkle the dry yeast on top. Let sit until the mixture begins to foam, about 5 minutes. Add the flour and butter. Next, using the dough hook attachment, mix on low speed until it's well combined. Change to medium speed and knead until the dough is smooth and pulls away from the side of the bowl, 4 to 5 minutes. (Kneading the dough can also be done by hand.).",
      "Remove the dough from the bowl, clean the bowl and then oil with vegetable oil. Return the dough to the bowl, cover with plastic wrap and let sit in a warm place until the dough has doubled in size, about 1 hour.",
      "Line a baking tray with parchment paper and lightly brush with vegetable oil. Set aside.",
      "When the dough is ready, lightly flour your working surface and divide the dough into 8 equal pieces. Roll out each piece of dough into a 24-inch rope. Make a U-shape with the rope and, holding the ends, cross them over each other and press onto the bottom of the U in order to form the shape of a pretzel. Place the pretzels on the baking tray and leave it at room temperature for 1 hour. This dries out the surface and makes them easier to handle.",
      "Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F.",
      "In an 8-quart saucepan or roasting pan, bring 10 cups water to a boil. Cut the heat and slowly add the baking soda to prevent from overflowing. Bring it back to a boil and add the pretzels to the boiling water, 1 by 1, for 30 seconds. Remove them from the water using a large flat spatula and put it back on the baking tray. This step will create a shiny, brown crunchy pretzel shell.",
      "Beat the egg yolk s with 1 tablespoons water and brush the top of each pretzel. Sprinkle with coarse salt. Bake until dark golden brown, 12 to 14 minutes. Transfer to a cooling rack for at least 5 minutes before serving with the Super Cheesy Sauce.",

      "For the cheesy sauce, in a saucepan over medium heat, bring the beer to a simmer. In a bowl, mix the cheese with the flour. Add the cheese mixture to the beer with the remaining ingredients. Stir until all the cheese has melted and the texture is smooth, about 5 minutes. Keep warm until ready to serve.",
      "Cook's Notes:",
      "For a different taste, instead of coarse salt, use sesame seeds, poppy seeds, Parmesan or cinnamon sugar.",
      "To get the shiny brown crunchy shell, it's important to cook in boiling soda water for 30 seconds. Cooking it too long will make the pretzel too chewy. Also, allow enough time to rise at room temperature, or else they will rise too much in the oven.",
      "This sauce is good on anything: broccoli, tacos, burgers -- the list is endless!"

      "Chestnuts -- add broth, water, and apple juice and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until apples and celery are tender, about 15 minutes.",
      "Finishing -- Using a blender, puree soup in batches. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Serve garnished with croutons.",
      "NOTE -- Now as I mentioned, a great simple salad with walnuts, roasted pears, beets and figs, some onions, bleu cheese vinaigrette is a perfect side. And then some Chardonney turkey sliders make this a perfect fall meal. The soup was made ahead as were the burgers and the roasted veggies and fruit for the salad. It took 20 minutes to grill, make the sides for the burgers and put together the salad. And grill up some drunken olives to get everyone started and you have a great party."
