Make it big enough to extend a foot beyond your cooking grate in all directions. Build a brick rectangle 3 layers high, leaving a couple of bricks out of the top layer on opposite sides, to encourage airflow. (For a standard 21-in. round Weber grate, the rectangle should be 2 bricks by 3 bricks.) Fill with about an inch of sand.",

Light the fire. \"The tipi lets every bit of flame go up past 3 or 4 logs,\" says Chiarello, so the fire starts fast. Once the logs have caught, add several larger logs to the perimeter. Let them burn down to ashy chunks with low flames (1 1/2 to 2 hours). Because there's less smoke and char than cooking over a flaming fire, Chiarello says, \"it makes your food taste much cleaner, gives nuanced flavor, and is better for wine.\"",

      "Beer note: Smoky brisket calls for a smoky beer. Although the Lone Star State makes some excellent brews (any of which would pair well with Texas barbecue), try Germany's Aecht Schlenkerla Maerzen beer, which has an alluring aroma of bacon and smoked sausage from the use of smoked barley. Its full body and gentle malt sweetness balance the spicy sauce. At 9 ounces, one bottle ($4) is enough to share. --Jeffery Lindenmuth"

Transfer the lamb to a cutting board and let stand, loosely covered with foil, for 10 minutes. Carve the lamb across the grain and serve hot.",
      "Wine Recommendation: The intense marinade gives spice to the lamb, narrowing the wine choice to a red with a pronounced pepperiness. But the plantains need something fruity. The solution? A fruity, spicy California Zinfandel, such as the 1996 Rabbit Ridge or the 1996 Alderbrook O.V.O.C."

      "Bring 2 cups water to a boil in a Dutch oven. Add kale; cover and cook 4 minutes. Stir in Swiss chard; cover and cook 3 minutes. Drain well, and cool. Place greens on paper towels, and squeeze until barely moist. Place greens in a large bowl; set aside.",
      "Heat 2 teaspoons olive oil in pan over medium heat. Add onion and fennel; saute 10 minutes or until soft. Stir onion mixture, rice, and next 8 ingredients (rice through feta) into greens. Set aside.",
      "Preheat oven to 350\u00b0.",
      "Gently press 1 sheet of phyllo into an 11-inch round removable-bottom tart pan coated with cooking spray, allowing ends to extend over edges of pan; lightly coat with cooking spray. Place second sheet of phyllo over first sheet to form a crisscross design; lightly coat phyllo with cooking spray. Repeat procedure with 5 sheets of phyllo and cooking spray, pressing sheets down into pan. Spoon greens mixture over phyllo in pan. Cover greens mixture with 1 sheet of phyllo, continuing crisscross design; lightly coat phyllo with cooking spray. Repeat procedure with 2 sheets of phyllo and cooking spray. Cover with remaining sheet of phyllo. Fold in edges of phyllo to fit pan and form a rim. Brush with 1 teaspoon oil. Cut 5 slits in top of dough to allow steam to escape. Bake at 350\u00b0 for 50 minutes or until golden brown. Let stand for 5 minutes.",
      "Note: If you can find packages of fresh phyllo dough, the delicate sheets will be easier to work with (they separate more readily) than the frozen variety. Look for fresh phyllo dough in ethnic markets or specialty-food shops."

      "Meanwhile, coat the swordfish with the remaining 1/4 cup oil, garlic, 1/4 teaspoon each salt and pepper, and the rosemary. Put the fish on a baking sheet and put it in the oven along with the potatoes. Cook, stirring the potatoes once, until the fish and potatoes are both done, 10 to 12 minutes for 1-inch-thick steaks.",
      "In a small bowl, combine the mayonnaise with the parsley, capers, and vinegar. Serve the roasted swordfish and potatoes with the caper mayonnaise.",
      "Variations: Try tuna, salmon, or codfish steaks instead of the swordfish. Fillets will also be good in this recipe, but you'll need to cut down on the cooking time. If you do, be sure the potatoes still cook for twenty-five minutes. Just put the fish in later.",
      "Wine Recommendation: Though not a typical Italian wine, pinot noir is superb with swordfish. There are some tasty pinot noirs from the Alto Adige and Friuli, which you'll find under the Italian name pinot nero."
