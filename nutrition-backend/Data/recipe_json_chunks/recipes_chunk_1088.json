I recommend using vinyl or rubber gloves as the potatoes are very cold! Lightly coat a 9x13 baking dish with non stick spray and press 2/3 of the potato mix in to the bottom. Make sure the mixture is even in thickness, evenly distribute sausage to the top of potato mix. Add the rest of the potato mix to the top of the sausage, and cover the entire casserole with remaining cheese. Cover with foil and bake for 45 minute Remove foil and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes or until cheese is bubbly. Let sit for about 10-15 minutes -- It will be lava hot! Enjoy!"

Place into an oven safe saucepan or Dutch oven along with the onion, orange, lime juice, bay leaves, salt, pepper, cumin, oregano, and water. Place on the stove over medium-high heat and bring up to a full simmer, stirring occasionally. Place a lid on the saucepan and move it to the middle lower rack of your oven. Bake at 300F for 2 hours, or until pork is fork tender (if you poke it with a fork, it easily slides off the fork). Remove the pan from the oven and turn the oven to broil. Using a slotted spoon, move the pork into a bowl and strain the liquid, placing it back into the pan for a glaze. Reduce the liquid over medium-high heat until the liquid reduces to about one cup.",

Place a baking rack onto a rimmed cookie sheet or a baking pan with raised sides (to contain any liquids). Place pork chunks onto the baking rack so that the juices will drip onto the baking sheet, about 1\" apart. Put the baking sheet back into the oven on the lower-middle rack and allow to broil for 5-8 minutes, or until the meat starts to crisp on the top. Remove from the oven, flip all pork pieces, and place back in the oven to broil for an additional 5-8 minutes on the second side, or until edges are crisp but not burned.",

The result: pulled pork so tender it melts in your mouth, with crispy broiled edges that will make your heart sing. The addition of fresh lime juice and salt at the end really perks it up. Leftover pork (if there is any) would be awesome as a filling for enchiladas, tamales, or burritos."

Place the log in a lightly greased 8 1/2 x 4 1/2-inch loaf pan, cover the pan loosely with lightly greased plastic wrap, and allow the bread to rise for about 90 minutes, until it's domed about 1 inch above the edge of the pan. A finger pressed into the dough should leave a mark that rebounds slowly.",

Test it for doneness by removing it from the pan and thumping it on the bottom (it should sound hollow), or measuring its interior temperature with an instant-read thermometer (it should register 190\u00b0F at the center of the loaf.) Remove the bread from the oven, and cool it on a wire rack before slicing. Store bread in a plastic bag at room temperature."

One sacrificial ball goes in at the start of the fry)! Depending on the size of your pot of oil, DO NOT over-crowd it, or the oil temp will drop, and you will end up with very greasy balls (that is why I test one first). Make batches at a time. They will stay hot for a very long time. Fry for approx 1 - 2 mins, turning with a slotted spoon, until the coating gets browned (DO NOT burn them, they will taste \"icky\" then)!

      "For the pesto: In a small food processor or blender, combine pine nuts (optional), garlic and basil. Pulse to chop, then while continuing to pulse, slowly pour in the oil to make a chunky mixture; do not puree. Transfer to a small bowl, and add the Parmigiano-Reggiano and Pecorino Romano. Mix well, and season with salt, pepper and chili flakes to taste. Set aside.",
      "For the orzotto: Place vegetable broth in a small saucepan and bring to a bare simmer. In another small saucepan, bring 2 cups of lightly salted water to a bare simmer. In a skillet over medium heat, combine 2 tablespoons olive oil and onion, and saute until soft and translucent, 5 to 10 minutes. Add orzo and saute until lightly toasted, 1 to 2 minutes. Add wine and saute until evaporated. Season lightly with salt.",
      "Add 1 cup hot broth and simmer, stirring constantly, until liquid is almost absorbed. Add 1 cup hot water and repeat. Continue to alternately add broth and water 1/2 cup at a time until orzotto is tender; total cooking time will be 16 to 20 minutes and all the broth or water may not be needed. The finished orzo should be golden yellow (add too much water and the flavor will be weak; add too much broth and the color will darken). Set aside finished orzo, cover and keep warm.",
      "In a small skillet over medium heat, heat remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil and add zucchini. Saute until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Stir zucchini and 2 tablespoons pesto into the orzo (reserve any remaining pesto for another use). Add Parmigiano-Reggiano, stir until melted and adjust salt as needed. Serve immediately."
