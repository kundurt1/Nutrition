      "First, cook the sweet potato. Prick it all over with a fork. Either roast it in a 400 degree oven for about 45 mins until tender, or microwave for about 10 mins. Allow to cool slightly. Peel, and smash with a potato masher eliminating all small chunks. Add the crumbled tofu and smush together with a fork. Sprinkle salt, cumin, coriander, minced garlic and minced ginger into mixture. Fold in the chopped cilantro. Sprinkle all over with 1/4 cup of the chickpea flour, and incorporate well with a spatula. If the mixture seems wet, add the other 1/4 cup of chickpea flour.",
      "Form the koftas into either quenelles using two small kitchen spoons, or using lightly wet hands, form into small golf balls.",
      "Heat a dutch oven, or similarly heavy bottomed pot on medium high heat with the two tablespoons of coconut oil. Sear your koftas in batches until brown on all sides, and set aside while you make the sauce.",
      "In the same pot, add your onions. The pot will bubble furiously, keep stirring to avoid heavily browned onions. Cook till lightly translucent. Add the minced ginger and garlic. Swirl until fragrant - this will happen quickly. Add your curry powder. Stir to coat, and then quickly add the tomato paste. You want to avoid burning the ginger, and the curry spice, both of which can brown very quickly. Cook the tomato paste out for about 2 mins. When it starts coating the bottom of the pot, its ready. Add the coconut milk. Keep stirring until the mixture is homogeneous. Sprinkle in the coconut palm sugar, and the vinegar. Allow it to come up to a simmer, and then carefully add the koftas back to the pot. Allow to simmer together 5 minutes until the sauce is thick, and the dumplings are warmed through. Serve with jasmine rice and lots of fresh cilantro."

      "Step 1. Bread.\r\nIn a deep bowl mix wheat and rye flour, salt, and yeast.\r\nAdd 1 1/2 cup of warm water to the dry ingredients. Slightly mix. Do not mix thoroughly.\r\nCover the bowl with a plastic wrap. Place the bowl in a warm place of the kitchen and forget about it for 19-20 hours.\r\n20 hours later drop the bread dough onto the kitchen towel generously dusted with flour. The dough is sticky. Lot's of flour is good. You will also notice that dough is not homogeneous: dry lumps and liquidy areas. It's fine.\r\nNow you will need to fold the dough three times (help yourself with the kitchen towel under the dough): (1) first, sprinkle with the poppy seeds on top and fold; (2) slightly press the dough with your hand, sprinkle oregano on top and fold again; (3) slightly press the dough, sprinkle thyme on top, fold for the last time, and cover the dough with the ends of a kitchen towel.\r\nForget about the dough for another 2 hours.\r\nPreheat the oven to 450F two hours later.\r\nPlace the deep baking dish in the hot oven to warm up, for 3-5 minutes.\r\nDrop the bread dough in the hot baking dish dusted with the flour. Sprinkle the dough with coarse salt. Cover the dish with the lid (or aluminum foil) and bake for 30 minutes. The dish should be deep enough to allow the bread rise without sticking to the lid.\r\nRemove the lid and let the dough bake for 10-15 minutes more until the crust nicely browns.\r\nBread is ready.",
      "Step 2. Calf Tongue.\r\nBring water to a boil in a large pot.\r\nPlace the calf tongue, frozen or chilled, into the pot with the boiling water.\r\nAdd a few stems of parsley (cut stems from parsley prepared for salsa verde), a whole carrot and onion with the skin to the pot.\r\nCover the pot with a lid and let it simmer on medium temperature for 75 - 90 minutes. (check the readiness of the tongue by pricking the thickest part with a fork. The tongue is ready when it is soft through). Once the tongue is cooked, remove the pot from the stove.\r\nFill a deep bowl with cold water and place the cooked tongue fully into the water. Pull and remove the skin from the tongue. The skin is removed easily.\r\nReturn the calf tongue into the pot with the broth. Generously add salt to the broth, cover with the lid and let the tongue stay in the hot broth until you are ready to eat. (You can use the broth later for the soup of your choice)",
      "Step 3. Salsa Verde.\r\nSoak the bread slices in wine vinegar for a few minutes.\r\nCut the stems from parsley and cilantro and discard (or use for something else later).\r\nCombine all ingredients for salsa verde in a food processor and run the processor until a smooth sauce is formed. Add salt to your taste.\r\nPlace salsa verde in the fridge until ready to serve.",
      "Step 4. Time to eat.\r\nSlice the bread and tongue thinly. Spread some salsa verde on top. Pour a drink of your choice and enjoy!"

Using a very clean mixing bowl, beat the egg whites on medium to high speed. Add the cream of tartar. Add the sugar a tablespoon at a time, and continue to beat the eggs whites until they form very stiff peaks. Then beat for a minute or two longer.",

Place in the top third of your oven, and bake anywhere from 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 hours. I find that 2 hours is generally the right amount of baking time in my oven. Allow the baked meringue to sit overnight if possible.",

Place the raspberry puree in a ramekin, cover, and refrigerate. \r\n\r\nFor the mango puree, follow the same directions, but add 2 TBS. of rum in addition to the other ingredients. Place the mango puree in the refrigerator.",

The meringue insides may be gooey - that is a good thing. If there are holes or cracks on the floor of the meringue, you can patch in crusty pieces from the lifted top. Crumble the remaining meringue top crust and place back into the meringue shell.",
      "Spoon the jam evenly around the rim of the meringue top (photo attached). Then, slide a rubber spatula around the sides and base of the mango pudding bowl. With some care you can invert the pudding into the meringue shell. With your spatula, smooth out the pudding so it reaches the sides of the meringue rim. Decorate the top of the pudding with the remaining fruit.",
      "Use a very cold bowl to make the whipped cream. Mix the heavy cream on high speed, and add the vanilla and the rum. Beat until the peaks are stiff, but don't overbeat. Place the whipped cream in a pastry bag with a fluted tip. Pipe little stars around the rim of the meringue, and around the base. Decorate with the fruit purees to your liking. Serve additional fruit purees on the side.",

      "Slowly pull the flour in from the sides of the well, mixing it with the fork you used to whisk the eggs, or make a swirling motion with your fingers so that the flour is mixed into the egg bit by bit. If some of the egg makes a mad dash for it out of the side of the flour volcano, stop its passage with some flour and guide it back to the middle of the pile.",
      "When there is enough flour mixed with the eggs so it is not a complete runny mess, knead in the rest of the flour. Knead it for about 5 minutes, or until the dough is silky and elastic.",
      "Wrap the dough in cling-film and leave it to rest in the fridge for 45 minutes.",
      "Take it out of the fridge, cut it up into 3-4 portions so it is more manageable, and flatten with your hands.",
      "Put it through the thickest setting on your pasta maker. Fold it into thirds and repeat. Do this a couple of times -- this is a continuation of the kneading process, making sure that all of the flour and egg is evenly and smoothly combined. Then continue to put it through thinner and thinner settings until your pasta is about 1/16 of an inch thick -- it should be slightly translucent. Then put it through whatever shape cutter you desire -- fettucini works really nicely with this sauce -- and hang it up to dry for 30 minutes, or, like me, let it dry on the counter, but without all of the strands of pasta touching so that they cling together in a ball. (If you don't have a pasta maker, follow all of these steps but use a rolling pin instead of the pasta maker. When you've reached the desired thickness, lightly flower the surface of the pasta sheet, roll it up, and cut it by hand however you like it.)",

In the top of the double boiler (or in a small bowl that sits on the rim), place the chopped white chocolate and fit the top on the base, over but not touching the water. You can turn off the heat to avoid scorching. With a small whisk, stir the white chocolate until just melted and completely smooth. Set aside while you prepare the rest.",
      "Prepare a second double boiler with one inch of water and bring to the simmer. Turn heat to very low while you continue with the next step. (Or use the base of the same double boiler, removing the bowl with the melted chocolate).",

Whisk until smooth.",
      "In a heavy saucepan, scald the remaining 4-1/2 cups of milk, stirring. Whisk in the pinch of salt. Pour the hot milk into the top of the large double boiler, place over the simmering water, and stir.

      "Switch to a heat-proof spatula and continue to heat and stir the cornstarch mixture over medium-low heat, scraping the bottom of the pot, until thickened. This may take 10- 20 minutes or so. The mixture will lightly coat the back of the spoon. When it does, remove from heat, separate top and bottom of the double boiler, and stir in the most of the spice and up to 1 teaspoon of the orange flower water. You will want to add the flavorings incrementally--gentle, fragrant flavor is key. Stir well; the spices tend to clump together. Taste the mixture for a good blend of flavors--neither the spice nor the orange flower water should predominate. Add the remaining spice and 1/2 teaspoon orange-flower water according to taste. (The strength of different brands of orange-flower water may vary). Whisk again to incorporate the spices, then take a one-cup dry measure and scoop out about 3/4 cup of the custard, whisk it into the white chocolate to blend, then scrape the white chocolate mixture back into the custard, mixing completely.",
      "Using a ladle and the tea strainer for smoothness, strain the custard into each of the custard cups. Place a square of plastic wrap directly on the surface of each custard to prevent a skin from forming. Allow the custards to cool to lukewarm, then chill in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours. They will firm up with chilling, yet remain creamy.",

I prefer 1/2 inch peeled fresh ginger.",

      "Tips you might find useful:\r\n\r\nDon't put everything of ONE ingredient in the feed chute simultaneously. You should try to mix them up while tossing them in the juicer. For instance: try 3 pieces of cut carrot and 3 pieces of chopped celery ribs in one go. This way, the drink will get even more mixed up.\r\n\r\nBe gentle with the pusher. Sometimes when you rush things, things... splash. I mean the ingredients might get spun straight off to the pulp container before they get squeezed properly if you apply to much pressure. Think of it more as a lid or a \"lodger\" than a pusher.\r\n\r\nGo easy on the ginger. Although it's the \"zing\" factor, this is a totally personal choice. You might want to use less ginger, or maybe none, if you choose to. But I really do recommend it, if not for its taste then for its benefits.\r\n\r\nGinger should not go last. Since the amount of ginger used is tiny, it needs to be washed down by other watery fruits or veggies. Put the ginger in between the carrots or celery ribs would be best."

      "Preheat the oven to 350. Cover the bottom of the pan with some olive oil and put the chicken in there.",
      "Cut 6 thin slices of lemon. This will use about 1/2 the lemon, maybe a bit more. Remove and seeds from the slices. Starting from the bottom of the chicken (the egg laying end not the head end) very gently loosen the skin. Slide the lemon slices up under, getting one on top of each drumstick and two on each side of the breast. Take your time and be careful, you don't want to tear the skin.",
      "Now prop the chicken up so the legs are skyward, and carefully pour the honey up under the skin. Once its all in there very gently work it around so all of the breast meat is covered. Try to get some up on the legs as well.",
      "Squeeze half the remaining lemon inside the chicken, then stuff as many rosemary sprigs as you can in there. Tuck the wings behind it's back and tie the legs. Arrange the garlic and remaining rosemary around the chicken, rub the skin (gently! You don't want to squish the honey out!) with olive oil, then squeeze the remaining lemon over it. Salt and pepper the skin, add the broth to the pan, and pop it in the oven.",
      "Roast the chicken until it's done (use a meat thermometer between the thigh and body to check) the time is going to vary depending on your chicken and your oven. This time mine took an hour and 20 minutes. Baste periodically as it cooks, make sure to squirt basting liquid inside the chicken too.",
      "When the chicken is done, remove it from the oven. Quickly pull all the skin off and eat it before anyone figures out what you are up to.",
      "Just kidding - that would be MEAN. Let the chicken rest for a few minutes, then carve and serve - it goes great with Mr Ls mashed potatoes and Pink Greens!!!!"

    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "Prepare the leaven: 8 to 12 hours before you mix your dough, prepare the leaven. Place the refreshed starter and water in a large bowl and stir to break up the starter. Add the flour and mix with a spoon until no dry lumps remain. Cover and allow to ferment at room temperature until you are ready to mix your dough.",
      "Mix the dough: When bubbles break the surface of the leaven, it smells ripe, and it has swelled considerably in size, add the water and stir to combine. Measure the flours into the bowl and use your hands to mix and squeeze the dough in a circular motion until no dry lumps remain. Cover and rest the dough for 20 minutes, allowing the flour to fully hydrate before adding the salt. Sprinkle the salt evenly over the surface of the dough and mix well to combine. This is an ideal time to observe your flour performance, as you may need to make adjustments with the addition of water. If the dough feels resistant to mixing and difficult to work inside the bowl, add more water in 20 to 25 gram increments, thoroughly mixing it in with the salt until the dough is no longer slick on the surface. The dough should feel supple and somewhat sticky at this point.",
      "Bulk fermentation: Place the dough back into the bowl and cover once more. Set the bowl aside in a warm location (ideally 75\u00b0F) to bulk ferment for about 3 1/2 to 4 hours (perhaps 1/2 hour shorter in the summer, possibly 1/2 hour longer in the winter months). During this time, stretch-and-fold the dough in the bowl to help develop the gluten network essential for trapping fermentation gases. To do this, wet your hands first to prevent the dough from sticking and gently slide your fingers of both hands under the dough. Release the dough from the sides of the bowl and gently fold it to the center. Rotate the bowl and repeat 3 to 4 more times until you have worked your way around the dough. Repeat this process every 30 to 45 minutes, being especially careful toward the end of bulk fermentation not to aggressively handle or deflate the dough. You should notice it progress from a 'shaggy mass' at the beginning of the mix to exhibiting a more cohesive and smooth character by the end of bulk fermentation.",
      "Shape the dough: When the dough has increased by at least 1/3 of its size and you see fermentation bubbles breaking the surface (about 3 1/2 to 4 hours or longer depending on room temperature), it is time to shape the dough. This is done in two stages: pre-shape with a short bench resting period, followed by a tighter final shaping. Using a bowl scraper, swiftly remove the dough from the bowl and place on a lightly floured surface. Using your hands, bring the top of the dough to the center, followed by the bottom, and two sides in a north, south, east, west motion. Tuck the resulting four corners to the middle as well, resulting in a slightly rounded form. Using your bench scraper, release the dough from the surface and flip it over seam side down. Cover with plastic and allow to bench rest for 10 to 30 minutes until it visibly relaxes.",
      "To final shape, use the bench scraper to flip the dough over onto a lightly floured surface, seam side up. Starting from the top, tuck the right side to the center, holding it in place while you bring the left side to the center overlapping with the first. Repeat this side-to-side stitching until you reach the bottom of the dough. Roll the bottom toward the center, repeating as necessary until the seam is facing down, tucking as you go to create tension. Flour the top of the loaf generously. Use your bench scraper to pick up the dough and flip it over, seam side up. Cradle it into your proofing basket before covering with a cloth. Cover with plastic and place in the refrigerator to retard for at least 8 hours or up to 24 before baking.",
      "Before bake your loaf: Remove your loaf from the refrigerator and allow to come to room temperature for about 1 hour. When it is ready to bake, it should feel like an inflated water balloon when gently poked with your index finger. The impression should linger in the dough rather than immediately bouncing back. Depending on the temperature of your refrigerator and your kitchen, this may take more or less time to final proof before baking.",
      "Preheat a Dutch oven to 480\u00b0F on the middle rack for 20 minutes. Cut a piece of parchment paper to fit the Dutch oven and carefully flip your loaf onto it seam side down. You may choose to sprinkle a little flour onto the surface before scoring to get a more graphic contrast, dusting off any excess. Score the top of the loaf with a razor blade about 1/4-inch deep to allow the loaf to fully expand in a controlled manner while baking. You may add additional decorative scoring flourishes but be aware that the loaf will continue to spread before going into the oven as you do so. Carefully lower it into the preheated Dutch oven, position the lid, and return it to the oven. Bake with the lid on for 20 minutes. Remove the lid and lower the oven temperature 10 to 15\u00b0F. Bake for another 15 to 20 minutes until the crust is a deep, rusty brown or darker if desired. Cool completely on a wire rack before slicing."

      "Butter one side of each piece of bread. Lay 4 pieces butter-side down on baking tray. Spread each piece with 2 tablespoons of Bechamel Sauce and 2 pieces of ham. Top with remaining bread, butter side up, and spread with 1 more tablespoon of Bechamel Sauce each. Sprinkle with gruyere cheese and pop in the oven until golden and bubbling, about 15 minutes. While the toasts are cooking, heat remaining butter in a frypan and fry eggs over medium heat until cooked through, but still with a runny yolk. Remove toasts from oven and top one with a fried egg. Serve as-is for breakfast, or accompanied with a dash of dijon mustard and a small green salad and a glass of red wine for lunch or dinner. Serves 4 for breakfast - or two for dinner."

Refrigerate overnight and allow chicken to come to room temperature before grilling.\r\nRemember to always wear gloves when working with scotch bonnet peppers.\r\nIn determining heat I would say 1 pepper gives noticeable heat, 2 would be considered hot but tolerable by most americans, 4 would be similar to what most Jamaican jerk stands would use and 5 or 6 for those who love their heat and can tolerate it. I personally prefer to add a little more heat here and a little less in the curry itself but to each their own. If you are extremely sensitive to heat you can leave it all out or add 1/2 or 1 whole jalapeno.\r\nYou never want heat to overpower a dish and take away your ability to savor and enjoy it so no need for bravado here...when in doubt opt for less.",

Spread the peach slices in a single layer on a sheet pan lined with foil and sprinkle generously with turbinado sugar and just a touch of kosher salt. Put the pan in the oven until the sugar caramelizes and peaches are looking golden, about 10-15 minutes. When the peaches are cool enough to touch, remove them from the pan and put them in a container in the fridge until the cheesecake is completely cooled.",

The method that we use in the bakery that I work in is to fill a large measuring cup or tall container of some sort with hot water, put the knife in for a few seconds, and dry on a towel before each slice is made. Works well for smooth slicing with no cheesecake guts ending up all over the knife and cheesecake."

Invert the butter block (still-papered side up) onto the lower half of the dough, positioning it so that there is a 1/2-3/4 inch margin of dough around the sides and bottom of the butter block. Peel the paper away and discard it. Fold the top portion of the dough down over the butter block. If it isn't quite long enough in any place, gently stretch the dough with your hands until it reaches the dough on the base. Press the edges together all the way around to seal, then fold the excess dough at the bottom and edges under itself. You should now have a rectangular package of dough (about 6 by 10 inches). Usually, the dough is still chilled enough at this point to proceed with the first fold, but if it or the butter feel warm, wrap it tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 15-25 minutes.",
      "Perform the first fold: roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface into a rectangle about the size of a half baking sheet (13 x 18 inches) and about 1/2 inch thick. I like to use my bench knife to keep the edges of the dough squared off while I roll. This makes for better layering! When you're done rolling, brush any excess flour away from the surface.",
      "Fold the outside edges inward, having them meet slightly off center. The result will look a little like an open book with an off-center spine. In other words: fold the edge on the left toward the center, about 3/4 across the dough. Fold the edge on the right 1/4 across the dough and make sure the edges meet. (Even though it's important for the edges to meet, don't be tempted to squish them into place; the warmth of your hands combined with the pressure could muck up the formation of layers or warm up the butter. Now fold the larger half over the shorter half, and transfer the dough back to a parchment lined baking sheet. Refrigerate for 15-25 minutes (until firm but pliable).",
      "Perform the second fold: roll the dough out again into your 1/2 inch thick rectangle (about 13 x 18 inches). Fold the left edge of the dough 1/3 of the way over the dough. Fold the right edge 1/3 of the way over the dough as well, resting on the piece you just folded over. Think of it like folding a piece of paper to fit into a standard size envelope. Same rules apply as they did to the first fold: brush away excess flour, try very hard to keep the dough rectangular in shape, and try to make the ends meet up as closely as possible. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for 15-25 minutes (until firm but pliable) before starting the next fold.",
      "Perform the third fold: repeat steps 6 and 7 to perform another of this style of fold. Wrap and refrigerate the dough for 15-25 minutes before starting the next fold.",
      "Perform the fourth fold: repeat step 8 to perform another of this style of fold. Wrap and refrigerate the dough for 15-25 minutes or up to overnight.",
      "Shape the loaves: grease two 9 x 5 inch loaf pans with nonstick spray. Divide the dough in half (totally OK to just eyeball it!) and refrigerate one half while you work with the other. On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough to a 9 x 12 inch rectangle, then rotate if necessary so one of the 9 inch sides is facing you. Square off the sides, if needed by trimming away a small piece of the edge of the dough to make straight lines.",
      "Cut the dough into 5 strips, 1 3/4 inches across each. Spoon about 1 tablespoon of chocolate onto each strip and spread into an even layer. \r\nStarting at one end, roll up each strip into a spiral and place it into the prepared loaf pan, seam side down. The spirals will be packed relatively tightly, but may not fully touch. Don't worry, as the dough rises, it will fill in the pan and get taller. Repeat with the second half of the dough (or try croissant rolls, also on the site)!",
      "Cover the dough inside the loaf pans with a piece of greased plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place until it almost doubles in size, about 40 minutes - 1 hour. If you're working in a very warm place, it may take less time to rise.",
      "Towards the end of rise time, preheat the oven to 375\u00b0F. Remove the plastic wrap from the surface of the dough, , and egg wash the surface of the dough. Transfer the pans to the oven. Bake until the loaves are very golden brown on the outside and the inside registers at a temperature of 190\u00b0F on a thermometer, about 35-40 minutes.",
      "Cool completely inside the pan, then invert-it should easily pop out. Slice the loaf and devour it-or use it to make toast for egg sandwiches, or French toast, or bread pudding, or for an epic grilled cheese!",
      "Note: Since this recipe is a bit of a doozy, but worthy of special occasions. I want to recommend freezing the final, baked loaves. Unmold the loaves and wrap them tightly in two layers of plastic wrap-they can be frozen for up to 2 months. To serve the loaf, unwrap it from the plastic wrap and wrap it in foil. Transfer the foil package to a baking sheet and warm the loaf in a 300 degree oven for 15-20 minutes, until fully thawed. Remove the foil and return to the oven for 3-5 minutes to lightly crisp the loaf."

Toast it in the oven for 3-5 minutes until it becomes crisp and golden. Set it aside. Pre-heat the electric griddle to 350 or the griddle pan over medium high heat. Grease it with butter, then cook off the pancake batter in batches in the size you want. They take about 4 minutes to cook on each side to become puffy and golden. Serve them as you make them with a sprinkle of toasted coconut, extra chopped macadamia nuts and syrup on top!"

Some people swear that the butter should not be allowed to colour; others cook the whites first on their own and then slide the yolks on top (having first salted the whites to prevent the yolks from being marked). Each way has its point, but in this book I have given the recipe I make for myself and my friends. Fried eggs cooked in this way are, incidentally, among the most irresistible of all dishes. Many is the time that I have suddenly had a longing for three fried eggs -- usually after midnight, when I am among friends, and guests who have finished dinner and are mulling away the evening with a liqueur. The sight of the eggs cooking is too much for them all, and they always end up by joining me. I know few dishes so powerful!"

When the farro is cooked, drain it and spread it out on a rimmed baking sheet to cool.",
      "Transfer the farro to a large mixing bowl. Set a fine mesh strainer over a medium sized mixing bowl and pour the onion mixture into the strainer, separating the oil from the onions. Add the onions to the farro, along with 1/3 cup of the onion confit oil. Mix to combine. Reserve any remaining onion confit oil. If the farro salad seems dry, you can add the remaining oil. Or, store it in your refrigerator and use it on another day to fry an egg or make a salad dressing.",
      "Add the persimmon, almonds, cheese, and red wine vinegar to the farro. Stir to combine. Taste the farro salad, and adjust the seasoning as necessary with salt and pepper. Add the arugula, and stir to combine. I like to wait 10 to 15 minutes before serving to allow the arugula to wilt slightly. This dish can also be made ahead of time and stored in the refrigerator. Just remember to remove the farro salad from the refrigerator at least 30 minutes before serving, so that it has a chance to come to room temperature."

When cooled, remove the pulp with a spoon and place in a bowl with the rest of the filling ingredients and combine well. The mixture should not be too wet, but you can add more breadcrumbs or Parmesan if needed. Set aside while you prepare the pasta.",

Using a fork, whisk the eggs togther and, still whisking, slowly begin to incorporate the surrounding flour until the mixture becomes creamy and eventually becomes too thick to continue whisking.",
      "With floured hands, finish combining the flour until the dough no longer sticks to your hands. Depending on the size of the eggs, you may not need all the flour or you may find the mixture too dry - in this case, you can add a bit of water until you have a dough you can work with. Knead on a floured surface for about 5 minutes or until it becomes smooth, elastic and a finger poked into the surface of the dough bounces back. Let the dough rest, covered with a damp cloth, under a bowl, or in cling film, for at least 30 minutes.",
      "Divide the rested pasta dough into four pieces, and, keeping the pieces that are not in use covered, roll out the pasta into paper-thin sheets with a pasta rolling machine until you can see your fingers through it.",

Then fold one corner of the pasta to the other to make triangles, carefully pushing out any air from the centre towards the edge before sealing. Next, fold the outer corners of the triangle together and seal by pressing down gently - this part of the cappellacci will essentially have 4 layers of pasta dough, so pressing to squash the dough and keep the shape of the cappellacci also serves to make sure it's not too thick and chewy.",
      "Let the cappellacci rest and dry out a little (up to an hour) on a well-floured board or cloth before cooking.",

Add a ladle of the water that the cappellacci are cooking in and whisk to create an emulsion. When the cappellacci are ready, remove them with a slotted spoon and place in the sauce, gently coating them. Serve with some grated Parmesan cheese."

    "directions": [
      "Preparations",
      "Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).",
      "Thoroughly pound the chicken with a mallet. Season with salt and ground pepper.",
      "Mix bread crumbs and 1/4 cup parmesan cheese in a bowl.",
      "Beat 2 eggs in a bowl. Whisk until well mixed.",
      "Coat the the chicken breasts with flour.",
      "Instructions",
      "Dip the flour coated chicken breasts into the egg, then coat them again with the bread crumbs. Set aside to allow the coating to somewhat dry off.",
      "Heat the olive oil in a skillet until it starts to shimmer.",
      "Place the chicken breasts into the skillet. Cook with medium heat until they become golden on both sides (you should spend about 2 minutes on each side).",
      "Place the chicken in a baking dish and top the breasts with the tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese, parmesan cheese, olive oil, and fresh basil. Bake in the preheated oven for about 15 - 20 minutes until the cheese is brown.",
      "Take out, and serve immediately while it's still hot, preferably with a glass of tomato spearmint cocktail.",
      "Notes",
      "Mind the sodium content. The cheeses are a bit salty themselves, so you may not want to season the chicken with too much salt in the first place. If you're on a low sodium diet, it's better to make the chicken salt-free.",
      "You can keep this chicken parmesan for a day or two in the fridge and microwave them for the next meal. Eating immediately out of the oven is much better though - the crispiness is at its peak new.",
      "It's a faux pas that I didn't think of the foil earlier but you should definitely use it when baking the chicken. It'll make cleaning up a hundred times easier!"

If you have a splatter screen, use it, and be very careful, as the oil may spit. After about 2 minutes, turn the zeppole so that they brown on both sides. When they are golden brown, remove them from the oil with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels, sprinkling immediately with salt and pepper. Keep the zeppolein a warm place as you cook the remaining batter. Make sure the zeppole have a chance to rest for at least 10 minutes before serving, as the centers need time to dry out. If you need to, you can reheat them in a 300 degree oven for a few minutes before serving, with lots of lemon wedges for squeezing."

      "Remove flank steak from the fridge. Unroll it onto a cutting board with the long edge towards you (think of it like a landscape photo). Find the grain (the linear marbling of the meat). It runs along the length of the longer side. Find a sharp knife, and score the meat for optimum absorption of marinade and to prevent curling under high heat. To do this, cut super shallow (less than 1/16-inch deep) vertical lines from top to bottom, about every 2 inches or so, against the grain, all the way across. Flip over and do this on the other side. Season the flank steak with salt and pepper. Set aside.",
      "With a mortar and pestle, make a smooth paste out of the anchovies and garlic (this takes some elbow grease). Whisk in shallots, honey, pomegranate molasses, balsamic reduction, red wine vinegar, red wine, olive oil, and salt. Put the flank steak in a wide, shallow dish, and pour the marinade over it. Press in with your hands. Flip over. Press in with your hands. Flip over again. Cover dish with saran wrap. Place in the fridge. Marinate for at least an hour or up to 24 hours.",
      "Take steak out of the fridge 30 minutes before cooking. Adjust your oven rack so that the meat can be a few inches from the flame.",

But this is not necessary.) Lift up the steak and allow the marinade to drip back down into the dish. Scrape as much of it off as you can with a spatula or your hands. Place meat on a separate plate. Open the oven and place flank steak on the hot pan.",
      "The flank steak will cook very fast -- usually 2 to 3 minutes per side is just right for rare. 3 to 4 minutes per side for medium rare. But don't trust me! Trust yourself! Take it out before you think it's done. Cut it open and take a peek. It will continue to cook quite a bit out of the oven. I almost always cook it a bit too much. So learn from me. Remove from heat and allow to rest for at least 10 minutes. Make sure your plate or cutting board can catch the precious juices.",
      "Place marinade in a medium-sized pot. Pour in any juices that have drained off of the broiled steak. Turn heat to high and bring to a boil. Turn down to medium. Reduce until almost half of it is gone and it starts to thicken. Stir every 30 seconds or so to make sure nothing is burning on the bottom. Turn off heat. Stir in pomegranate arils. Taste. Adjust seasoning. Spoon sauce over the top of the flank steak. Let it sit for a few more minutes. A surprising amount of the sauce will seep into the steak. Slice thinly, at an angle, against the grain. Serve."

Juice the peeled lemon, plus 2-3 more, to make 3/4 cup lemon juice (seeds removed); set aside. Fill food processor with peas and peppermint leaves. Blend, gradually adding 1/2 cup of the lemon juice (reserve remaining 1/4 cup juice). Stop occasionally to scrape down sides, and keep blending for just a few minutes, until mixture is consistent and there are no remaining big leaf pieces or whole peas. Texture should be even but rather thick and not smooth. Set aside.",

Sift or sieve over the mixture: flour, salt, baking powder and soda. Mix until incorporated, adding remaining 1/4 cup lemon juice along the way. Fold in the vanilla bean seeds and lemon zest until just evenly disbursed. Gently fold in the egg whites 1/3 at a time until just incorporated, being careful not to flatten them too much. Batter will be frothy and delicate.",

Cakes will be an unusual color and not very tall. Let them cool completely in pans before loosening edges with knife and removing. Once cool, cover until ready to frost or decorate, then store and serve at room temperature for up to 24 hours; do not refrigerate.",
      "Because the cake is best at room temperature, you'll want to wait to frost it until just ready to serve. This refreshing cake matches perfectly with a basic cream cheese icing, enhanced with some lemon juice and a drop of mint extract. To keep the dessert dairy-free, opt to frost it with meringue frosting such as 7 minute frosting. If desired, add a drop of green food coloring to your icing and/or decorate with peppermint leaves and even a few peas. Alternately, a simple dusting of sifted powdered sugar is divine."

      "This is a great way to use up some leftover chicken or turkey. I routinely roast 2 chickens at a time. It takes just as long as roasting 1, and a whole chicken full of meat pulled off and frozen for an instance such as this, well, it's sort of like finding buried treasure. Which gives you an idea of what my freezer looks like. Alternatively, rub some chicken thighs with olive oil, dust with salt and pepper, and roast at 350 degrees for about 20 minutes. While chicken is cooking and cooling, prep the rest of the ingredients and make your dressing.",
      "Once chicken is cool, dice it into 1/2\" cubes and move to a mixing bowl. Add the drained pineapple, the bell pepper, red onion, and Italian parsley. Use your hands or a spatula to toss everything together.",
      "Make the dressing in a small bowl. Whisk together the vinegar and mustard. Add the olive oil in a slow, steady stream, whisking continuously so as to maintain your emulsion. Whisk in the oregano, then season to taste with salt and pepper. And because everything is better with red pepper flakes, add a pinch. Add dressing to other ingredients and stir to dress everything evenly.",
      "If serving immediately, stuff a lettuce leaf into each pita half, then scoop in some filling. Repeat until all are filled. Using mini pitas as an hors d'oeuvre? You're brilliant! Just tear the lettuce leaves smaller.",
      "If traveling, wrap washed lettuce leaves in a couple of damp paper towels and store in a ziplock bag. Pack the filling into one or more ziplock bags. Place a frozen gel pack on either side of the bag(s) and secure at the top and bottom with large rubber bands. They'll keep the chicken filling cold and everything else, too. Cut pitas in half so you don't need a knife and cutting board if you weren't planning on taking them anyway. Return them to the bag they came in. Place everything inside a plastic bag that can function as a garbage bag on the return trip. Set out, and enjoy a beautiful summer day!"

Add all the sugar (TIP: YES YOU CAN ADD ALL THE SUGAR AT ONCE) and continue to beat until glossy stick peaks form. Add the red and yellow gel food coloring about halfway in (1:3 ratio to get a hue of orange; adjust as needed. Color will slightly fade when baked). You know they're done when peaks are stiff on the beater and you can hold the bowl upside down*.",
      "Pour half the almond-meal mixture into the egg whites. Fold into the egg whites gently. Add the food coloring, if using and at about 20 turns add the rest of the almond-meal mixture and continue folding for an additional 20 turns. Total of about 40-45 folds. **DO NOT OVER FOLD** The batter should look like molten lava and gently start to slide away.",
      "Silpats work extremely well for macarons but parchment paper will also work. Add a dot of batter on all 4 corners of the parchment paper so it does not move when piping. Spoon the mixture into a pastry bag fitted with a plain half-inch tip (Ateco #806). Pipe ~1\" sized (3 cm) mounds of batter onto baking sheets 1\" apart. They will slightly spread.",
      "**NOTE**: If you see that your shells have that little tip/peak, lightly dip your finger in water and gently press any peaks down.",
      "Tap the trays onto a flat surface about 10 times to release any air bubbles. Sprinkle with ground cinnamon. Let the macarons sit on the counter for 30 minutes. While they sit, preheat the oven to 300F. Tops will be dry to the touch; that's when you know you're ready to bake.",
      "Depending on your oven temperature baking time may vary between 12-15 min. My oven runs hot so my total bake time is 12 minutes, rotating 1/2 way through. They will form their \"feet\" at the 1/2 way mark. I turned down the oven to about 280F for the second half as my oven is on the hotter side.",
      "Take it out of the oven to cool. DO NOT REMOVE MACARONS STRAIGHT OUT OF THE OVEN. Wait until cool to the touch to gently remove off the tray and onto a rack to finish cooling.",
      "FILLING: Once shells are done turn up oven to 350F. In a small bowl mix dry ingredients with a whisk.",
      "In a separate bowl (medium) whisk the pumpkin, egg, and coconut milk until combined. Add the sugar mixture and whisk until completely incorporated",
      "Place pumpkin mixture in an 8x8 casserole dish and bake in the oven for 35-40 minutes until a knife inserted in the filling comes out clean (no residue).",
      "Match up the macarons so they match in size (that way you don't end up scrambling on the last few shells that don't have homes ;)) Place filling in a ziploc with 1 snipped corner or pastry bag. Gently pipe a dollop of pumpkin filling in the center of 1 shell. Gently adhere the second shell on top.",
      "TO STORE: For those that will be eating within 1-2 days, you can store in an airtight container in the fridge. Allow to sit on counter to reach room temp before devouring. It will actually taste slightly better after it has rested and the shells have gotten a chance to absorb some of that amazing pumpkin pie filling =)",
      "FOR LONGER STORAGE: Freeze pre-filled macarons in an air tight container. Before consuming place on the counter until it reaches room temp."

    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "For the dough: Cut the bacon into 1/4 to 1/2 inch pieces, cook in a pan over high heat, when crisp add the brown sugar. Stir continuously for two minutes or until the pan is getting dry, then add the maple syrup. Cook, stirring, until bacon is caramelized and crisp. Remove bacon from pan using slotted spoon letting oil drip off, then spread bacon in a thin layer on a baking sheet or plate to cool. \r\n\r\nProof yeast with sugar in 1/4 cup of the warm milk until foamy and yeast is doubling in size, about 5-10 minutes. Beat in remaining milk, egg and egg yolk, creme fraiche and butter. Stir in cooled bacon, making sure the little pieces aren't all stuck together. \r\n\r\nMix in flour, cornmeal and salt and knead using the dough hook until a soft dough comes together. Turn out onto a board and knead with your hands, about four minutes, until it is smooth and elastic. \r\n\r\nTransfer to an oiled bowl, turning dough to coat with a little oil, and let rise for 1 1/2 hours in a warm place or until doubled in size.",
      "For the pear filling: Mix granulated sugar with brown sugar, set aside. \r\n\r\nRemove cores and stems, and cut pears into rough 1/2 inch cubes. Toss with sugar mixture to coat.\r\n\r\nHeat butter in a large heavy pan, cast iron works well. When hot and foaming, add sugared pears and 3 thyme sprigs. Let cook, stirring occasionally, until sugar is bubbling. Cook about 3-5 more minutes, and then pour off most of the liquid, leaving just a bit to coat the bottom of the pan and the pears. Pears should now brown easier, but keep stirring so they don't get stuck. When pears are starting to get soft, 2-3 more minutes, add the 2 tablespoons maple syrup and stir continuously until liquid has been cooked off. Remove from heat, place pears in a bowl and let cool.",
      "For the thyme maple syrup: Place 1 cup maple syrup with 4-6 sprigs thyme in a saucepan. Four sprigs makes for a medium-mild sauce, while six will be quite strong. \r\n\r\nBring to a boil, and let boil gently for three minutes. Cover, remove from heat, and let sit for at least an hour. \r\n\r\nStrain out thyme, and refrigerate syrup.",
      "Assembly: Preheat oven to 450 degrees. \r\n\r\nPunch down dough, and roll out to 1/8 inch thick. Cut into circles, any size will work, whatever size cutter you have handy, I find 4-6 inch circles easiest to work with though. Spoon filling into center, be sure to squeeze out extra liquid before placing it on dough. A little less then 1/4 cup filling seemed to work well for mine, you want them plump but not to the point to exploding. Moisten edges of dough slightly, and press closed firmly with your fingers, then use a fork to crimp the edges. \r\n\r\nArrange empanadas about 2 inches apart on a lightly oiled baking sheet. Beat egg with 1 tbsp water, and brush on tops of empanadas. Sprinkle with thyme leaves, just a few. \r\n\r\nBake 10-15 minutes, or until golden.",

      "The night before (or at least 2 hours before you start to cook), cut the wing tips off of your duck and remove the package of giblets from the body cavity -- this package should contain the heart, gizzards, neck, and liver. We won't be using the liver for the stock, but save it! You can freeze it and make gravy with it later, or just fry it up in a pan -- it's delicious. NOTE: Feel free to save your giblets for another use and use a good quality store-bought duck or chicken stock as a substitute. The flavor won't be quite as rich, but it will still be delicious.",
      "Add oil to a medium pot and place over medium heat until shimmering. Add the wing tips, neck, heart, and gizzards and cook, stirring occasionally, until browned (about 10 minutes).",
      "Add onions, facedown, carrots, garlic, celery, and thyme, and cook until onions are fragrant and the cut side has caramelized -- about 10 more minutes.",
      "Deglaze the pan with white wine, scraping up the caramelized bits from the bottom, and cook for 2 minutes, to cook some of the alcohol off.",
      "Add 6 cups of water and bring the mixture to a boil. Once the mixture is at a boil, lower the heat and simmer low, uncovered, until you have two cups of very rich brown stock -- about 1 1/2 to 2 hours.",
      "Once the stock has reduced to 2 cups, strain it out, pressing the solids, and set it aside.",
      "Preheat oven to 450\u00b0 F.",
      "Clean the pot that you made the stock in, fill it with 5 cups of water, and place it over high heat.",
      "Using a vegetable peeler or a very sharp knife, carefully peel the zest off of your navel oranges, being sure to avoid the white pith. Cut the zest into thin strips.",
      "Once the water is boiling add the zest and blanch for 15 minutes.",
      "Slice your zested oranges in half and juice until you have 3/4 of a cup of juice. Supreme the rest of the orange halves into segments. Set the juice and the segments aside.",
      "While your orange zest is still blanching, prick the duck all over using a sharp fork-don't prick into the meat, just prick through the skin. You want to make hundreds of pinpricks all over the duck, this will help the fat render out and the skin get crispy.",
      "After 15 minutes, remove the zest from the water with a slotted spoon, pat them dry with paper towels, and set them aside.",
      "Keep the water boiling and add your baking soda.",
      "Place the duck on a roasting rack in the sink and pour the boiling water all over it. You should see the skin shrink away from the body and tighten up.",
      "Transfer the duck, breast side-down, on its roasting rack into a roasting pan (use oven mitts! The rack will be hot from the boiling water).",
      "Sprinkle salt and pepper evenly over the skin and inside the body cavity. Place half of the blanched orange zest inside the body cavity. Add about 1 cup of water to cover the bottom of the roasting pan -- this keeps the fat from smoking when it hits the pan. Roast for 20 minutes.",
      "After 20 minutes, reduce the heat to 350\u00b0 F and flip the duck over so it is breast side-up and roast for 30 minutes.",
      "After 30 more minutes, flip it back to breast side down and roast for 30 more minutes. While the duck is roasting, prepare the sauce:",
      "In a medium saucepan, boil the sugar and vinegar until caramelized to a golden brown -- about 3 to 5 minutes.",
      "Very slowly add the 1/2 cup of orange juice (the caramel will bubble up a little, that's normal), whisking until fully incorporated. Add duck stock and bring the mixture to a boil.",
      "Mix the arrowroot with the remaining 3 tablespoons of orange juice and whisk that mixture into the caramel sauce.",
      "Stir in the remaining half of the blanched orange zest.",
      "Simmer for 5 minutes over low heat until the sauce has thickened.",
      "Add the Grand Marnier and remove the sauce from the heat. \r\nWhisk in the butter.",
      "Now, remove the duck from the oven and pour the fat off (save this fat in your freezer! It's great for cooking!). Once the fat is poured off, flip it over so it's breast-side up, and roast for 40 more minutes.",
      "After 40 minutes, crank the heat back to 450\u00b0 F and cook for an additional 10 minutes to give the skin even more color.",
      "Insert a wooden spoon into the duck's cavity and tilt it up, letting the juices run into the roasting pan. \r\nTransfer the duck to a serving platter.",
      "Pour the pan juices into a glass container and place it in the refrigerator to allow the fat to separate from the pan juices. Once the fat has separated, skim it off the top and strain the remaining pan juices into your orange sauce. Taste the sauce and season with salt and pepper.",
      "Carve the duck and serve it with the supremed orange slices and orange sauce."

      "Preheat oven to 375F. Wash, let dry in a colander, trim the bottoms, and then split brussels sprouts in half, placing them in a large bowl. Pour around two tablespoons of olive oil, or another neutral oil, over the brussels sprouts and toss to coat. Hands work best here. Spread the brussels sprouts cut-side down on a sheet pan, no silpat or parchment please, and generously sprinkle salt and pepper over all. Roast them until they are tender and beginning to brown on their undersides, no stirring necessary, between thirty and forty minutes.",
      "While brussels roast, in a wide and somewhat deep pan (12-inch cast iron preferred, but a saute pan will do), over medium-high heat two tablespoons of olive oil. Add poppyseeds and five cloves of garlic either minced or put through a garlic press, saute until the sharp scent of the garlic dissipates but before it can brown at all, about one-two minutes, stirring frequently. Add mustard seeds, fresh ground nutmeg and pepper, and cook for two more minutes. The poppyseeds should begin to smell nutty at this point. If garlic begins to brown, progress to the next step more quickly: add lemon juice, two tablespoons of limoncello, dijon mustard, and vegetable broth. Turn heat to medium low or low, reduce by half very gently.",
      "When brussels are just nearly finished, just slightly caramelized, turn the heat back up to high on your lemony liquid and add the final two cloves of garlic and two tablespoons of limoncello (more if there are sweet teeth coming to dinner). Swiftly remove the brussels from the oven, and add them to the pan. Stir to ensure they are well coated, continue cooking for another two-three minutes until the glaze has sunk into the sprouts. Check for seasoning, but the initial salting and peppering should suffice. Sprinkle fresh parsley (or any other herb) and microplane lemon zest on top to serve, perhaps grate a light dusting of parmesan or use a vegan alternative. They are best served fresh, still delicious reheated by microwave or oven, and yet equally delicious cold and straight from the fridge."

The dough should be smooth! Split the dough into two disks: one with 2/3 of the dough and the other with 1/3. Wrap well in plastic wrap and allow dough to rest in the refrigerator while you prepare your pastry cream.",
      "To prepare the pastry cream, place a large pot on the stove with milk, take the vanilla bean and carefully, with the back end of a knife, extract the seeds by scraping. Add the seeds and the vanilla pod to the milk and on low heat, bring the milk to a low simmer. As soon as the milk begins simmering, remove from heat to allow the milk to infuse with the vanilla bean. This should only take about 5 to 7 minutes max.",

When the cream is very thick, turn off the heat and, using a spatula, empty into a low, wide bowl. Allow it to cool for 30 minutes, then cover it so the surface is in contact with plastic wrap, so that it does not create a skin. Transfer to a refrigerator. This can be kept in a refrigerator for up to 3 days and can be frozen for up to 2 months.",

For this, I use a tart pan with a bottom that's easily removed. Springform pans work well too! Butter and flour the pan. Make sure that the dough is large enough to line the pan (covering the sides generously). Wrap the dough onto your rolling pin and unroll it onto the cake pan, pressing it gently down into the pan and being sure to cover the pan's bottom and sides.",

With a fork, dock the surface of the dough and pour in the pastry cream, using a spatula to make a slight mound in the center (this will help it from collapsing after baking).

Put the milk in a bowl, and the flour and salt mixed in a separate bowl. Place these near each other, along with the bowl of clams and a colander with papertowels where you will drain the fried clams of excess oil. Preheat the oven to 200F. Mix the mayo and old bay into a small bowl. Cut the buns in half, if they aren't already. Pour the oil into a deep pan, and place the heat on medium.",
      "Prepare the sliders. Make small patties out of your meat. Don't overwork the meat, or it will become stiff when you cook it. I also recommend making small divots in the middle of the patties; this will prevent them from becoming ball-shaped instead of patty-shaped as they cook. Put the butter in an ovenproof frying pan (preferably you can do all of your patties in this pan in a single batch) and bring it up to high heat. When the butter is sizzling, add the patties. Bring the gas to medium-low. Don't overcook the meat. Only cook each side for about 1 1/2-2 minutes. Then place the entire pan in the oven to stay warm while you cook the clams.",
      "Cook the clams. You'll know when the oil is hot enough when a drop of the batter sizzles on contact. Submerge clams into the buttermilk, followed by the dry ingredients, and drop into the oil. Try not to put too many clams in the oil at a time; it can be overwhelming to have too much going on in there. After the clams are golden, remove them from the oil and place them on paper towels.",
      "Assemble the sliders. Place a patty on each bun, with a clam or two on top. Then slather some of the special sauce on top, and pin everything together with a toothpick. Enjoy!"

Tip: You can check the fermentation by opening the lid; you should see some bubbling juices and taste the tanginess of the freshly pickled cabbage. It will keep fermenting slowly in the jar for up to 6 months. The flavor will evolve and change with time-and a steady cold temperature will ensure an even, slow fermentation."

Drizzle a little canola oil onto a paper towel or kitchen towel and using tongs, wipe the oil on the hot grill grates or pan.",

Turn with tongs or a spatula and cook for an additional 2 to 3 minutes, depending upon the thickness of the fish and the desired degree of doneness. Note that the fish will continue cooking for a minute or so after you remove it from the grill so factor that into your timing.",
      "Kitchen tip: Lemongrass adds a wonderful hint of lemony flavor and fragrance to your cooking, but you need to peel off and discard the tough outer layers in order to use it. Then cut off the bulb at the root end. Cut the softer white-yellow-green stalk that remains as your recipe directs. You can cut it into chunks or slice in smaller slices to reveal a purplish blush at the interior (slicing on a diagonal works well). Or if you don't need neat slices, you can place the stalk on a work surface and whack it with the side of a large chef's knife to crush it and chop it a little more if need be. If you are slicing it and the thin top section becomes too hard to work with, whack it and chop it up.",
      "Kitchen tip: To remove needle-like pin bones from a fillet of fish such as trout, salmon or arctic char, place the fillet on a work surface. Run your finger along the the top (not the underbelly or the tail) and you will feel the tiny bones, no bigger than a pin. With fish tweezers or tongs, grasp one pin bone firmly and pull toward the head end of the fish; don't pull toward the tail because the bones don't face that way and they will snap in half. Gently but firmly pull out the bones one by one. If one does happen to snap, feel for the piece you left behind and with your finger and pull it out."

At first the nuts will clump and then you will see the oil starting to come out of the nuts and it will turn to nut butter. Then, add the nut butter to 4 T raw honey & 2 tsp water...blend.\r\nSo many different variations. You could add dates and pulse chop until mixed. or add shredded apples and pulse chop for a few seconds. You can even change the color of the frosting by adding beet juice or veggie juice . Then.... Frost the cake and garnish with edible flowers, and/or dried coconut, strawberries....or whatever your heart desires.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!"

      "Place a saute pan over medium heat and add the butter. When it melts add the onions, red pepper and celery. Season with a little salt and pepper. Saute until translucent without browning them. Add the garlic and saute until fragrant. Remove from the heat and let cool. In a large mixing bowl, if you have a stand mixer it works great, place the chicken, shrimp, bread crumbs, cream, egg, parsley and thyme. Add a 1 teaspoon of salt and a 1/2 teaspoon of pepper. Add the cooled veggies and mix until very well combined. Place a large pot, filled half way with water, on the stove and turn the heat to high. Place a 10 x 10 piece of plastic wrap on top of a 10 x 10 piece of foil. Place a quarter of the filling on the wrap and wrap it up being careful not to let the wrap roll into the interior of the loaf. Now roll the plastic wrapped loaf in the foil. Twist the ends of the foil until the loaf is tight. Repeat this process three more times with the remaining loaf mixture. When the water is boiling add loaves and reduce the heat to a simmer. Let simmer for 40 minutes. If they don't stay submerged you can turn them occasionally or put a wire rack on top of them . While they are cooking combine all the dipping sauce ingredients in a bowl and mix well. Check the loaves by inserting a cooking thermometer into the middle. It should read 165. If not cook longer. Combine the saltine crumbs and the parsley on a tray. Carefully unwrap the loaves, there will be lots of juice so you may want to do this on a plate. Then roll them in the crumbs. Slice and serve."

If you're using instant yeast that you can trust, you can skip this step, but make sure to add those 3 tablespoons of water to the rest of the ingredients, as noted below.",
      "TO MAKE THIS WITHOUT A STAND MIXER: Add to the large bowl in which you proofed the yeast (once it's foamy), 1 cup of room temperature water, honey, salt, wheat germ, cheese and one cup of flour. Stir well. Some experts suggest that you beat the dough all in one direction.",

Some will drizzle out. Don't worry about it. Just knead for about five minutes, or longer if necessary to make a smooth, supple dough. (You add the oil after letting it rest to allow the water to hydrate the flour fully, giving the gluten created by mixing the two the best opportunity possible to form.)",

Push the dough back together, and start kneading again on medium speed. Repeat with the rest of the walnuts, adding the chopped basil at the same time. Knead on medium speed until fully incorporated -- 3-4 minutes. Remove the dough hook, shape the dough into a ball, and cover the bowl with a damp tea towel.\r\nThe dough should be nice and slick. If it isn't, drizzle a bit more oil into your mixing bowl, put the dough ball in and flip it over to coat, and cover lightly with a damp cloth. Let the dough rise for about an hour. Then continue with step XX, below.",

Cover loosely with foil after about 25 or 30 minutes if any exposed nuts are getting too brown.\r\nIf you've shaped the dough into baguettes, bake for 15 to 25 minutes, depending on the diameter of the baguettes.

In batches, sear the turkey pieces until well-browned all over (if they're sticking, just leave them a bit longer-they'll release once they get a good sear) and transfer to a large roasting pan. In the same saute pan, saute the onion, carrot, celery, and garlic until soft and lightly caramelized, about 6 minutes. Deglaze with the wine, scraping up the brown bits, and simmer to reduce the liquid by half. Spoon the stock and vegetables over the thighs and legs, cover the roasting pan with aluminum foil, and braise until the meat is very tender, about 2 hours. Cool the legs in the braising liquid and refrigerate overnight.",
      "Pull the drumstick and thigh meat (Wednesday or Thursday): Scrape off any fat that has risen to the top of the braising liquid and set aside to use in your (delicious) stuffing. Remove the legs and thighs from the braising liquid and pull the meat of the bones. Bring the liquid to a boil, then strain and set aside to make the gravy or cool and refrigerate until ready to make the gravy.",
      "Make the brine (up to a week ahead): In a large pot, bring the water, salt, sugar, herbs, garlic, and onion to a boil. Simmer until the salt and sugar have dissolved. Cool (in a water bath, if you're in a hurry) and refrigerate.",
      "Brine the breasts (Tuesday or Wednesday): Place the breasts in a large storage container or pot and cover with the chilled brine (the meat should be completely submerged). Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 but no more than 2 days.",
      "Roast the breasts (Wednesday or Thursday-you will need about 2 hours inactive time): Remove the breasts from the brine, pat dry, and let sit at room temperature for an hour. Heat the oven to 425\u00b0 F. Melt 2 tablespoons of the butter, place the breasts in a roasting pan fitted with a rack, and brush the skin all over with melted butter. Roast until the meat reaches an internal temperature of 135\u00b0 F to 140\u00b0 F, about 45 minutes. (Note: This lower internal temperature helps prevent the meat from drying out-the meat will finish cooking through gently in the gravy when rewarming. If you're roasting on Thursday and would prefer to take it closer to 165\u00b0 F and serve the gravy on the side, that is fine too.) Let the meat rest for about 15 minutes. Cool the breasts, cover, and refrigerate overnight.",
      "Make the gravy (ideally Thursday, but can be made Wednesday and rewarmed if needed): In a small saucepan, melt 1/2 cup of the butter. Stir in the flour and cook until the roux turns pale gold and smells slightly nutty, like browned butter. In a large pot, bring the reserved braising liquid and milk to a boil. Decrease to a simmer and whisk in the roux. Simmer over medium-low heat, stirring often, until the gravy coats the back of a spoon, about 15 minutes. Add the reserved drumstick and thigh meat and simmer until the meat is hot. Keep warm. If you need to make the gravy ahead and chill it, rewarm it in a heavy pot or saucepan over medium heat, whisking in extra stock as needed to thin to your preferred consistency. Take care not to let the bottom scorch.",
      "Warm and serve the breasts (Thursday): With a sharp knife, remove the whole breasts from the breast bone, then slice each breast crosswise in 1/2-inch slices. (If the breasts are still slightly pink, the hot gravy and warm oven will finish cooking the meat, while keeping it moist.) Place the slices in a large casserole and spoon the hot gravy over the top. Place the turkey in a warm oven (250\u00b0 F) until ready to serve."
