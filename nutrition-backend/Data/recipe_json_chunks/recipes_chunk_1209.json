Immediately dump the rest of the flour mix into the bowl. I like to use a wooden spoon to mix the rest together.",
      "Knead the dough for a good 10-15 minutes. If you have a machine that can knead dough then use that if not look up how to hand knead pizza dough online. You may have to sprinkle a little extra Bread Flour from time to time if it gets too sticky while kneading.",

    "ingredients": [],

      "Make the lemon curd: Combine the lemon zest, juice, and sugar in a small saucepan and bring to a simmer. Meanwhile beat the egg until light in a small bowl. Beat some of the hot lemon mixture into the egg. Scrape the egg mixture back into the saucepan. Cook, stirring constantly and reaching all over the bottom and sides of the pan, until the mixture barely starts to simmer around the edges. Continue to cook and stir for about 15 seconds. Pour through a strainer set over a clean bowl. Stir in the vanilla. Cool to room temperature.",
      "Make the cheesecake batter: Position rack in lower third of oven and preheat to 350 degrees. Place a round of parchment paper in the bottom of the cake pan and spray sides of pan with vegetable oil spray. Put water kettle on to boil for baking procedure.",
      "Process the cottage cheese in a food processor for 2 1/2 to 3 minutes or until silky smooth, scraping the sides and bottom of the bowl once or twice as necessary. Set aside.",
      "In a small microwave safe bowl, soften the Neufchatel cheese in microwave on high for about 30 seconds. Or, warm gently in the top of a double boiler. Stir until smooth. Scrape into the processor. Add the eggs, sugar, vanilla, lemon juice, and salt. Pulse until incorporated and perfectly smooth. Do not over process.",
      "Scrape the batter into the prepared pan. Distribute slightly rounded tablespoons of lemon curd evenly over the cheesecake batter. Using a table knife or teaspoon, use circular strokes to marble the batters until nicely but not to completely mingled.",
      "Slide oven rack part way out. Place cheesecake pan in baking dish or skillet and set on oven rack. Carefully pour boiling water around the pan to a depth of about 1-inch. Slide oven rack in gently to avoid sloshing. Bake until cheesecake has puffed and risen slightly and is just beginning to shrink from the edges of the pan, about 40 to 45 minutes. Remove cheesecake from water bath and cool on a rack. When completely cool, cover and chill for at least 12 hours or up to 2 days before serving.",
      "To unmold and serve: Cover the pan with tightly stretched plastic wrap. Place a flat dish on top of plastic. Invert pan and dish and rap the pan gently until cheesecake is released from pan. Remove pan and peel parchment liner from bottom of cake. Place cake circle or serving plate on the cake and carefully invert so that cake is right side up. Remove plastic wrap. Press crumbs around sides of cake. Cut with a sharp thin knife. Dip the knife in hot water and wipe it dry between cuts.",
      "TIPS:",
      "The suave texture of this cheesecake relies on ultra smooth cottage cheese. This requires a food processor and at least 2 1/2 to 3 minutes of processing, no cheating.",
      "Once the Neufchatel Cheese has been added, pulse only enough to incorporate. over processing thins the batter.",
      "If you use nonfat cottage instead of low fat, the results will be not be nearly as good and you would save only about .4 grams of fat per serving. It's not worth it."

      "Allowing sauce to slow cook for at least 2-3 hours makes for a more robust sauce ~ serve with al dente pasta, a good crusty Italian bread (ciabatta for example), freshly grated Italian cheese (a good quality aged Pecorino Romano made from sheeps or goats milk is best, never cows milk), & your favorite red wine (our favorite is a good cabernet).",

      "The Day Before:",
      "- Around 2 PM the day before take your 1 lb. 8 oz. bag of Navy Beans and rinse them off. Then pour the beans into your largest stove pot. Pour in six cups of water and bring to a boil, then simmer the beans for about two minutes. Turn off the heat and then place a lid on the pot and let sit to 9 PM or till you assemble the ingredients in your 6-qt crock pot. When boiling be careful because the beans will foam up and overflow the pot. Occasionally, check the pot throughout the day and evening to ensure the beans remain covered by the water; if not, add water till the beans are covered.",
      "- While this is going on take three or more fresh celery stalks and finely dice them into small pieces. You should end up with about 2 cups of celery.",
      "- Also, dice up 10 or more baby carrots till you reach 2 cups. I find it is a lot easier to just purchase a bag of baby carrots and dice these up.",
      "- Then take a large onion and dice it up into very small pieces until you have 2 cups worth.",
      "- Now take one large red and yellow bell peppers and finely dice until you have 1 1/2 to 2 cups worth.",
      "- And finally, you will need 4 cups of diced ham. Normally, I purchase a two pound ham end piece and dice this up until I have four cups; you will have some ham left over. I use black forest ham to get the best flavor.",
      "- Now place all diced ingredients into a large sealed storage container and then refrigerate until you assemble the mix for cooking.",
      "The Night Before:",
      "- Around 9 to 11 PM the night before drain the water from the pot containing the navy beans. Pour the beans into your 6-qt crock pot. Note, this recipe will probably fill the crock to its brim. I use a slow cooker liner bag in the crock to simplify cleanup.",
      "- Pour your previously prepared containers of diced celery, carrots, onions, peppers, and ham into the crock pot.",
      "- Sprinkle in 2 teaspoons of salt, 2 teaspoons of pepper, 1 teaspoon garlic powder, and then put in 2 bay leaves.",
      "- Mix all ingredients together with a large spoon.",
      "- Now pour in 2 cups of tomato or V8 juice, 6 cups of water, stir well, put the lid on, and turn the crock on to \"LOW\"; then go to bed.",
      "- For the first few hours the smell of onions will be strong, but this will dissipate as they cook into the soup.",
      "The Day of Serving:",
      "- After cooking about15 hours the soup reached the bean softness and consistence we like. (We placed the crock on LOW at 9 PM the night before and it was done by 12 PM the next day.) Note every crock pot is different with regards to amount of heat it produces, therefore, after 12 hours I recommend you monitor the soup closely until it reaches the consistence you want.",
      "- Note, if the beans are still not soft after 12 to 13 hours of cooking turn the crock pot to \"HIGH\"; you make the determination.",
      "- About 1 to 3 hours before serving take a metal potato masher; a flat bottom one with holes seems to work best, and mash up some of the beans against the bottom of the crock pot; only mash a small portion. Mash just enough beans to make any clear fluid at the top of the crock pot take on the color of the beans and increase the overall thickness/consistence of the soup. You may have to do this one or more time until you are happy with the soup thickness. This way you do not have to pour a portion of the soup mix into a food processor to grind it up then place back into the crock as so many recipes call for in order to give your mix the typical bean soup appearance.",
      "- Note, if the soup is still too watery for your taste then let it sit for a while (keep heat on) until all solids settle to the bottom of the crock. After the beans have settled you may skim off the excess water using a small glass measuring cup. Do not remove too much; remove enough water to reach the consistency (thickness) you are looking for. Then stir, serve, and ENJOY.",
      "- Upon serving, let each guest add pepper and salt to suit their individual palate. In the past I would occasionally add some ketchup to my bowl for additional flavor. However, recently I discovered a few drops of Tabasco sauce really makes all the flavors in the soup \"POP\".",
      "- I recommend you freeze or refrigerate any leftovers for consumption at a later date. When reheating the soup you may need to add a little bit of water depending upon how thick your soup was initially.",
      "- If you plan on making corn bread to go along with the bean soup I recommend you start making it one hour before you serve the soup."

Place in a container WITH NO LID! for approximately 4 hours or until cool. This will pull all the rest of the starch out that the agitation didn't. This is called blanching.

In a strange twist of art imitating life, the character Timmy was to give the character Charity a heart transplant. Joshua died on the same day the episode aired due to complications with his heart during routine testing. Joshua suffered from achondroplasia, a genetic condition that restricts cartilage growth and physical development. He was only 3'2\" tall although he was already 17 years old when he started on the show, hence his role as a doll. All said of him that what he lacked in stature he made up for in heart. He was 20 years old. Other film credits included \"Ally McBeal\", \"7th Heaven\", \"Baby Geniuses\" and \"How the Grinch Stole Christmas.\" *****."
