      "Grill the chicken breasts over moderately high heat or broil them for 8 to 10 minutes. Turn and cook until the chicken is just done, about 10 minutes longer.",
      "Variations: Try any dried herb you like in place of the thyme. Marjoram, oregano, rosemary, or sage are all good choices.: Use boneless, skinless chicken breasts instead of bone-in breasts. Grill them until just done, about five minutes per side over moderately high heat.: Use a quartered chicken instead of bone-in breasts. Cook the breast sections as directed in Step 2 and allow thirteen minutes per side for the leg quarters.",
      "Wine Recommendation: Red pepper can be difficult to pair with wine as it accentuates the bitterness of the alcohol. So, bypass high-alcohol wines and try an herbal, light-bodied sauvignon blanc from Collio."

The wine's lush apple fruit loves the sweet shellfish, and if you pick a wine with an edge of creamy citrus, it works like a twist of lemon. Napa Valley's 2007 Antica Chardonnay ($35), from Italy's Antinori family, is your bottle for the Crab Bisque, with crisp citrus and bracing herbs balancing its sweet fruit. --Sara Schneider"

      "Casserole Basics: Glass and ceramic (earthenware) dishes work best for casserole cooking because they heat up quickly and evenly. If you substitute a metal baking pan, the casserole usually cooks more slowly, so you may have to increase the oven temperature by 25\u00b0 to compensate.",

      "Thick fillets or steaks, especially if covered with a sauce or topping, can take from 12 to 15 minutes of baking time per inch. To check for doneness, cut into the fillet at the thickest part to see if it's opaque inside and pulls apart with little resistance.",
      "Casserole recipes calling for fully or partially cooked seafood or fish need only enough time in the oven to get hot, so an instant-read thermometer comes in handy. If the middle of the casserole registers 160\u00b0, it's done.",

      "Set up a charcoal grill for indirect medium-low heat (300\u00b0 to 325\u00b0): Light 50 briquets in a chimney starter. Open grills' bottom vents fully and close lid vents about halfway. When coals are spotted with ash, about 20 minutes, put an aluminum drip pan (at least as large as turkey) in middle of firegrate. Bank coals on either side of pan, piling them highest against walls of grill. The pan's function is to keep coals from tumbling toward the center, under the turkey. Cover grill and let coals burn to medium-low. Check temperature during roasting; if necessary, add 5 more briquets to each mound about every 30 to 45 minutes to keep temperature steady at 300\u00b0 to 325\u00b0.",

Spread the rest of the butter under skin and over tops of legs, thighs, and lastly breast. Pat the bird to even out the lumps and evenly distribute butter. Wrap wing tips and drumstick ends with foil so they don't char.",
      "Drain half of wood chips or chunks. Sprinkle evenly over coals. Set cooking grate in place with its hinged flaps aligned over coals to make replenishing them easier. Whenever heat dips below 300\u00b0 during cooking, add about 5 briquets to each pile of coals.",
      "Oil a shallow but sturdy grilling rack and put turkey on it, breast side up. Set the rack on a rimmed baking pan just big enough to hold it; then set pan with turkey over indirect heat area (aligned with aluminum pan). Insert a cord-style digital thermometer through thickest part of breast until it touches bone. Arrange cord over indirect heat area. Cover grill.",
      "Grill-roast turkey for about 1 hour, tenting it with foil when it begins to get too dark. Drain remaining wood chips or chunks and add to fire as before. Grill-roast turkey until thermometer registers 165\u00b0, 2 to 3 hours more. Use an instant-read thermometer to double-check the temperature on the other side of breast, and measure temperature into the thigh joint (where thigh meets body) as well; here, it should be 170\u00b0.",
      "Lift baking pan with turkey off grill. Tip turkey by one end of grilling rack so juices run into pan.",
      "Transfer turkey to a serving platter; save pan juices for the gravy, or just strain the juices, spoon off fat, and serve them as is. Let turkey rest in a warm place 20 to 30 minutes. Garnish with extra herb sprigs if you like and bring to the table for carving.",
      "*Use wood chips or chunks to give your turkey a gently smoky flavor. Aidell's favorite woods for turkey are fruit woods like apple, cherry, or peach; find these at home-supply stores."

Set the oven on top of the circle of coals, then pile the rest of the coals on top of the lid.",

Using a sharp knife, cut off the top two-thirds of the artichoke. With a teaspoon, scoop out the furry choke. Peel the artichoke, removing all the dark green skin and add it to the bowl of acidulated water. Repeat with the remaining artichokes.",

Bake the artichokes for about 40 minutes, stirring occasionally, until golden and tender. Let cool slightly and discard the thyme. Coarsely chop 8 of the roasted artichoke pieces and reserve. Reduce the oven temperature to 375\u00b0.",

For gas, set a drip pan on center burner (the indirect heat area), fill it halfway with very hot water, then heat the other burners to low (275\u00b0 to 300\u00b0). For charcoal, ignite 50 briquets in a chimney. Bank evenly on opposite sides of firegrate, leaving a cleared area in center for drip pan; fill pan halfway with very hot water. Let coals burn to low. Add 5 briquets to each mound of coals every 30 minutes, starting when ribs go on grill; if fire gets too hot, partially close vents on lid.",

For gas, drain half the wood chips and put in a smoker box, if grill has one; or seal chips in foil, poke quarter-size holes all over it, and set over direct heat (in foil, chips may take awhile to start smoking). For charcoal, drain half the wood chips and sprinkle evenly over coals.",
