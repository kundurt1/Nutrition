      "Turn the heat down to medium so it isnt splashing everywhere and allow to boil for 2 to 2 1/2 hours, or until the meat is tender and falling off the bone.",
      "My ham was 4 kg.",
      "I boiled it for 2 1/2 hours which was perfect and all the meat came off the bone easily.",
      "Take the ham from the pot and pull the meat off of the bone, shredding it with two forks, and discarding the fat and bones.",
      "It should shred very easily.",
      "Layer half the shredded meat in a large baking dish.",
      "In a small bowl, stir together the brown sugar, dry mustard and orange juice.",

      "Source: Adapted from Mels Kitchen Cafe.",
      "Note: The original recipe calls for a 1:2 ratio of vinegar to water.",
      "I have made it that way and it was amazing, but this time I used 4 cups of vinegar and then added water until the ham was covered by about an inch of liquid, which was 20 cups, so a 1:5 ratio.",
      "The ham was still just as amazing.",
      "So start with a one to two ratio, and if, like me you run out of vinegar, or have a huge pot, it will work just fine if you need to add more water!",
      "Also, make sure to use a bone in cut of ham, and not a spiral cut ham, as that would turn out really dry using this method."
