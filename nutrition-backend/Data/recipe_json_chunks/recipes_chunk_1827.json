      "As a general rule, the cheeses you choose should follow the flavors and intensity of the wine.",
      "If you are drinking a big, intense wine, choose a big, intense cheese.",
      "For example, if you've chosen Petit Sirah (usually big, deep--colored and full bodied), choose a Gorgonzola, the creamy, classic Italian cow's milk blue cheese that comes in Mountain (aged) and Dolce (sweet) varieties.",
      "If you are serving a Sauvignon Blanc (which tends to be crisp and light - medium bodied), pair it with goat cheese, light and delightfully tart--even tangy.",
      "Also, the more acidic your wine is, the higher the fat content of the cheese needs to be (generally).",

      "Have fun and experiment with your favorite flavors!",
      "Next to buying good cheese, the single most important element of serving a great cheese course is the temperature of the cheese when you serve it--room temperature!",
      "Set the cheese out at least 3 hours before serving time.",
      "It really is true that $5 cheese will taste like $20 cheese at the right temperature and $20 cheese will taste like $5 cheese at the wrong temperature.",
