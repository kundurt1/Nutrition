Carefully clip candy thermometer to side of pan (do not let bulb touch bottom of pan). Continue to cook until mixture reaches the hard ball stage (255\u00b0). Meanwhile, beat egg white and cream of tartar with heavy duty electric mixer until stiff but not dry. Slowly pour hot syrup into egg white mixture, beating constantly. Add vanilla; beat until candy forms soft peaks and starts to lose its gloss. Spoon mixture into prepared pan. Cut into 3 strips lengthwise, then crosswise in center. Freeze until firm.",
      "Line baking sheet with waxed paper; set aside. Melt caramels with 3 Tbsp. water in heavy, small saucepan over low heat, stirring occasionally. Arrange pecans on waxed paper. Working quickly, drop 1 piece of frozen candy mixture into melted caramels to coat completely. Place on prepared baking sheet to set. Repeat with remaining candy pieces, reheating caramels if mixture becomes too thick. Cut logs into 1/2 inch slices. Store in refrigerator in airtight container between layers of waxed paper or freeze up to 3 months. Makes 6 (5 inch) rolls."
