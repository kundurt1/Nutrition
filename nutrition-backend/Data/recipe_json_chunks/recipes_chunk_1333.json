In a small bowl, combine the ricotta, milk, linseed oil, and the egg and beat with a fork until smooth. Pour the ricotta mixture across the top of the flour mixture and pulse, in 1-second intervals, just until a ball forms, 5 to 10 pulses. The dough will be fairly moist.",
      "2 Transfer the dough to a well-floured work surface. Lightly flour your hands and briefly knead 5 to 7 turns to get a smooth yet slightly tacky dough. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and let sit at room temperature for 30 to 45 minutes to allow the bran in the flour to soften.",
      "3 Meanwhile, place a baking stone on a rack on the bottom shelf and preheat oven to 425\u00b0F. Liberally sprinkle a pizza peel with coarse cornmeal. Finely chop the white and light green parts of the green onions until you have 1/2 cup. Combine them with the sour cream, capers, and 1/4 teaspoon of the pepper in a small bowl. Finely chop the dark green parts as well (about 1/4 cup) and set aside for garnish.",
      "4 Unwrap the dough, transfer to a lightly floured work surface and cut into 2 pieces. Keep 1 piece covered with plastic wrap. Lightly flour your hands and briefly knead the other until smooth, 7 to 10 turns. Using a rolling pin, roll the dough into an elongated pizza, 11 by 8 inches and about 1/4 inch thick. Do this in stages, occasionally turning the dough over and rolling it out further, lightly flouring your work surface and the rolling pin each time. Place the dough on the pizza peel. Spread half of the sour cream topping across, leaving a 1/2-inch border. Cover with half of the apple slices, top with half of the fennel slices, and sprinkle with half of the prosciutto. Brush the border with oil.",
      "5 Slide the dough onto the baking stone and bake until the fennel just starts to brown at the edges and the rim turns golden brown and starts to crisp - it should yield when pressed with a finger - about 15 minutes. Use a large spatula to lift the edges of the pizza so you can slide the peel underneath; carefully transfer the pizza to a wooden board. Sprinkle with half of the reserved green onions and 1/4 teaspoon of the pepper. Cut with a sharp knife and serve at once. Repeat with the second pizza."

Each square of dough should weigh about 3 1/2 oz/100 g. Stretch each square into a circle about 5 in/12 cm in diameter as if you are making a small pizza. Stretch the inner part of the circle so that it is quite thin and shape the edge of the circle to create a rim. The center should be almost paper-thin, and the finished circle should look like you are making the crust for a mini deep-dish pizza.

Sprinkle about 1/4 cup/30 g of the mozzarella on top of each pizza, covering both the egg and the exposed rim of brioche. Bake for another 8 to 10 minutes, again switching the baking sheets between racks and rotating them back to front about halfway during baking, or until the cheese has melted, the edges of the egg are cooked but the yolk is still wiggly, and the edges of the pizza are golden brown.

To select the best one, shake it to listen for a lot of milk inside. Prepare the coconut by first making a hole or two in one end with a hammer and ice pick. Stand the coconut up over a small bowl or glass measuring cup to catch the milk as it drains out. Next, crack the hard outer shell with a hammer, then pry off the pieces. The inner white coconut meat can then be grated [with a handheld microplane grater]. Refrigerate both the milk and grated coconut until ready to use.\""

Remove the ends from the snow peas and cut in half, halve the cherry tomatoes, cut the yellow pepper into 1/2 inch pieces and slice the chives so they are about 1/2 inch long. If your sweet basil leaves are big tear them in half but if they are of a size that could easily be eaten leave them as they are. Basil turns brown if it is sliced and will start to turn brown if it is torn so keeping the leaves whole works best. Add all vegetables, herbs and the feta into a bowl and toss. Roll the lemon to make it easier to juice and squeeze the lemon juice into the salad. Add the salt and pepper to taste. Chill or serve immediately. Can be made up to 3 hours in advance."

Place the orange candy, green candy, and milk chocolate melting wafers into separate microwavable bowls. Microwave each bowl separately, stirring occasionally, until the candy is smooth, about 1 minute. Using a small, clean craft brush or your fingertip, paint spots in the 3 different colors of melted candy in an even layer (not too thin) over the top side of each leaf. While the candy is still wet, swirl the colors slightly to blend. Place the leaf on one of the cookie sheets, coated side up. Repeat with the remaining leaves.

In addition, mix the rest of the ingredients in the bowl. Be sure to chop all items in pieces that are as small as the smallest piece of squid. Allow the squid to cool. If you mix the hot squid, the vinegar in the marinade will cook. When close to room temperature, mix the squid with the seasonings. Allow to marinade for 24-48 hours stirring often for best flavor.

Add 4 cups of flour and knead w/ mixer and hook, add up to 1 cup more of flour, stopping when the dough is no longer sticky. Take out of the mixer and knead into a smooth ball, adding water or flour as necessary to achieve a smooth-but-not-sticky consistency. Let rise for one hour in a bowl, divide in half, and roll out into a thin crust. Puncture dough all across the surface with a fork to prevent the crust from developing air bubbles when it cooks. Sprinkle a little corn meal on a cookie sheet, then pre-cook the crust in the oven for 3 or 4 minutes on 425. Remove from the oven, and either freeze the crusts or use immediately.

    "ingredients": [],

      "Preheat a heavy-bottomed skillet, preferably cast iron, over low heat. Add the oil and the onions and toss the onions to coat. Cover and cook for 20 minutes, leaving a little gap for steam to escape. Stir occasionally, every 5 minutes or so. Onions should turn amber, but not burn, although a couple of darker spots are fine.",
      "Remove the cover and turn the heat up just a bit, to a medium setting. Stir often for 10 more minutes. Onions should become a darker amber, and some of the moisture should evaporate.",
      "In a medium-size pot, cover potatoes in water. Place a lid on the pot and bring to a boil. Once boiling, cook for about 20 more minutes or until potatoes are easily pierced with a fork.",
      "Meanwhile, in a large pan, saute the onions in oil over medium heat for about 7 minutes. Turn the heat off but continue to stir occasionally because they could still burn from the hot pan. When the potatoes are done boiling, drain them well and add them to the pan with the onions. Just mash them right in there with a potato masher; that way you are sure to get all the oil, plus you save a dish. Add the salt and pepper. Make sure potatoes are mashed well and fluffy. Set aside to cool a bit.",
      "You know I don't usually advise cooking with margarine, but I really love it with the mushrooms here, I think because growing up the mushrooms I ate were really buttery. Anyway, this filling is really simple. In a large skillet, melt the margarine over medium-high heat. Add the mushrooms and saute for about 7 minutes, until the mushrooms are soft.",
      "Before adding the sauerkraut to the pan, give it a squeeze over the sink to get out as much water as you can. It's important to do this so that your pierogi don't get all wet. You'll need to add the sauerkraut to the pan a cup at a time. Add to the pan and cook for about 10 minutes, cooking out any excess water. Season with the pepper. The filling shouldn't look dry (a small amount of water is okay), but you shouldn't be able to slosh around in it in rain boots.",
      "This is really the brunt of the work in this recipe. If you're like me, you have limited counter space and so rolling out dough can be a hassle. I make the dough last because the mess becomes much more manageable when you don't have to prep on the counter afterwards. It also gives your filling some time to cool. So make sure you clean up after your filling making and get someone to do the dishes for you. I find that a serene counter makes all the difference in dough making.",
      "Pour the water and oil into a large bowl. Add 2 cups of the flour and the salt, keeping one cup aside. Use a fork to stir the flour in, and as it starts to come together, use your hands to knead until a loose dough forms (about 3 minutes).",
      "Sprinkle your counter with flour, then turn the dough out onto it and knead. Add the reserved cup of flour a little bit at a time, working it into the dough, until it is very smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes. If it's too sticky, you can add a little bit more fl our and knead it in, sometimes up to 1/4 cup extra. Conversely, if you get a good-feeling, smooth, elastic dough with less than the extra cup of fl our, then that's okay, too.",
      "Now we roll the dough out, and also bring a salted pot of water to boil-the largest pot you've got-for boiling the pierogi.",
      "Divide the dough in half and make sure your counter is clean and sprinkled with a dusting of flour to prevent sticking. Roll half the dough out to about 1/16 of an inch thick, which is to say, very thin but not see-through. I roll it into an 18 x 10-inch rectangle, but as long as you have the thinness going, the shape doesn't matter so much. Sprinkle the top with a light dusting of flour.",
      "Now we're going to make circles. I use the top of a glass that is 3 1/2 inches in diameter, but somewhere between 3 1/2 and 4 inches is perfect. Use a glass or a cookie cutter. Have ready a lightly floured plate to place the finished circles on, and go ahead and fi rmly press your glass or cookie cutter into the dough, as close together as you can. Pull together the excess dough and set aside. Place circles on the floured plate and transfer to the fridge while you repeat with the other half of the dough. Combine the excess dough and see if you can get a few more wrappers out of the deal."

Remove the pan from the heat and set aside. To prepare the zucchini, slice a thin amount of the zucchini off each side so your slices will lay flat. Once sliced rub a small amount of lemon juice over each slice to avoid browning. Spray your baking dish with olive oil and each of the slices of zucchini. Top each slice with the cheese blend and place in a 400 degree oven for 7-10 mins. Remove from oven, place two slices on each plate, crossing them and the top and pile on the puttanesca.

Mix one final time to ensure prawns are evenly coated, then let sit for 15 minutes. Skewer and grill until pink, but don't over do it. Charing is fine, but these are also good slightly underdone. They can also be broiled or stir-fried, but grilling offers the best flavor."
