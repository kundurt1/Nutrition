      "Now I am sure most of you know how Cobb salads are put together. And most of us have had them at some point. A lettuce base and then stripes of the different ingredients layered over the top of the salad. A creamy blue cheese or sometimes a vinaigrette and \"Cobb Salad.\" I have had probably 5 versions, all claiming to be traditional, but if you go back to the traditional Brown Derby Recipe -- that is classic. So this is my semi classic flavors with a twist.",
      "Bacon -- I like to cook my bacon right in the microwave. Just place the bacon on a paper plate or microwavable plate and top with a paper towel, then 4-6 slices of bacon, then another paper towel, then 4-6 slices of bacon, then another paper towel. Now I make up to 3 layers at a time -- but always top with a paper towel. Takes 1 layer about 3 minutes; 2 layers about 4; and 3 layers about 6 minutes. No clean up. Now you can always bake it or pan saute if you prefer, but use good quality smokey or hickory turkey bacon. Cook until crisp and then remove to a plate to let cool. Then chop into small bits.",
      "Base -- Chopped mixed greens and mixed with the shallots and put on each plate as the base. Or you can use a small serving bowl which works well too. I sometimes like to top with just a little salt and pepper.",
      "Dressing -- Mix the olive oil, red wine vinegar, lemon juice, orange juice, garlic, mustard, thyme, salt and pepper, and capers in a small bowl or measuring cup and set to the side.",
      "Layers -- Start right to left or left to right. Who cares? This is just layers the vegetables like little stripes on top of the salad. My ideal version -- I start with egg, then tomato, a little seafood, then avocado, then bacon, then mango, seafood, and finish with tomato. Very simple. If you have one vegetable or fruit that is more than the other, don't worry, just make an extra stripe. It doesn't matter on the order or ingredients. Just add it to the salad as you like. If you like more tomato, by all means, more avocado, go ahead. No mango, don't worry, try papaya or peaches. These are just my favorites.",
      "Dressing and Topping -- Now, top with with walnuts, gorgonzola cheese and top with the dressing. That is it! It is an amazing salad. Elegant, worthy of a dinner party, but still great for a weekend dinner. Make the same recipe to make 4 small salads or cut in half to make just 2.",
      "I cut the recipe in half all the time to make it just for me and my SO. I like to make 2 small salads and then serve with a big bowl of warm creamy roasted tomato soup (usually from the freezer), a nice slice of baguette (also from the freezer), and you have an amazing dinner!",
      "I pulled up a local restaurant and for a Cobb Salad with a cup of soup and bread stick they charged $18 and that was just chicken. I will guarantee you that you will make 4 giant salads with seafood NOT chicken and it will cost you about the same as 1 for lunch. It is a great salad. ENJOY!"

      "Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F.",
      "Break the eggs into a large mixing bowl. Using a fork or whisk, beat the eggs by hand (or use an automatic mixer set to low or medium) - about 1 minute.",
      "Add the coconut milk and vanilla. Beat again briefly, until well mixed.",
      "Add the sugar 1/2 cup at a time, stirring as you go, until all sugar is added and has dissolved in the egg mixture. Note: This may seem like too much sugar, but the custard does need to be sweet in order to compensate for the slightly bitter taste of the pumpkin.",
      "Pour or ladle the egg mixture into the pumpkin (try not to spill any on the outside of the pumpkin, or it may burn. If you do spill, wipe it away with a cloth). Don't overfill - leave about 1/2 inch of room room at the top, since the egg mixture will rise a little out of the hole (it is not runny, so this is fine).",
      "Set the pumpkin plus the \"lid\" together in a baking dish (a long, glass dish works perfectly, like the kind you would use to make lasagna).",
      "Pour about 1/2 inch of water into the bottom of the baking dish (water level should be about a 1/2 inch up the side of the pumpkin).",
      "Being careful not to spill the contents of the pumpkin, place in the oven to bake for 1 hour at 350 degrees. After 1/2 an hour, check the water level, making sure the baking dish doesn't go dry. Tip: Always add warm (or hot) water, never cold. Cold water could make your baking dish shatter.",
      "After 1 hour, you should see the custard rising like a bubble out of the pumpkin. Custard is done when an inserted fork comes out clean. You can also poke the top of the pumpkin with a fork to make sure it is soft enough to eat. If necessary, continue to bake up to 10 minutes more.",
      "Leaving pumpkin in the baking dish, allow to cool, then place in the refrigerator until cold (this will help it \"set\") Note: The custard may \"drop\" a little - this is normal.",
      "To serve, replace the \"lid\" or \"hat\" of the pumpkin, or set it slightly askew so you can see the custard. Using a sharp serrated knife, cut the pumpkin into pieces (see picture) and place the pieces on serving plates. Eat as is, or serve warm with a little maple syrup or brandy over each piece."

      "Step 1) In the kitchen sink, remove your turkey from the wrapping. Find the bag of giblets and remove it from your turkey. Check both ends of your turkey for that bag of giblets!",
      "Step 2) Rinse your turkey with cold water on the inside and the outside. Lift the turkey and turn it upside down to drain for a moment. Pat the turkey dry with a clean kitchen towel (and put that towel immediately in the hamper, so you don't accidentally use it for anything else).",
      "Step 3) Place your turkey in a pan or on a roasting sheet. Rub salt and pepper onto the skin.",
      "Step 4) Poke a few holes with a paring knife in each lemon. Insert rosemary sprigs into several of the holes in each lemon, as shown.",
      "Step 5) Insert one of the rosemary lemons completely inside of the turkey. Rest the other rosemary lemon near the opening of the turkey cavity.",
      "Step 6) Coat the outside of your turkey with melted butter. Don't use so much butter that it drips all over the pan (try to avoid that), but make sure at highest part of the turkey is covered. The butter will spread down the sides of the turkey as it roasts, sealing in flavor and giving the turkey skin a golden color.",
      "Note: We are buttering our turkey skin instead of basting. It's easier and prevents the meat from drying out. A buttered turkey will have a slightly darker color than a basted turkey (or a turkey in a bag), and the skin will be crispy. The end result is delicious!",
      "Step 7) Showtime! Place your turkey in a preheated, 325 degree oven on the lowest rack possible. Your turkey needs to slowly roast until a meat thermometer poked into the thickest part of the turkey (but not against a bone) registers 165 degrees. Your turkey might have a little red timer attached - this timer will pop out when your turkey is done. It's STILL a good idea to check the temperature. Your turkey needs to reach 165 degrees in order to prevent food-borne illness!",
      "How long will your turkey need to roast? That is the million dollar question! Every turkey and every oven is a little bit different. At 325 degrees, a 10 - 12 pound turkey will require approximately 3 hours of roasting time. Check your turkey after 2 1/2 hours, but don't open the oven door before then!",
      "Step 8) Let your roasted turkey rest on the countertop for 15 minutes before carving. A \"tent\" of aluminum foil (just a very loose covering of foil) can be used to prevent heat loss, but that's not entirely necessary.",
      "Enjoy your roasted turkey!",
      "PS - Don't wash that pan! In our next Crowded Earth Kitchen post, we'll show you how to make gravy with the drippings on that turkey pan!"

      "First, A BRIEF NOTE, if you have not worked with tempered chocolate before: It is very temperature-sensitive (do not go above 100F, use a candy thermometer if you have one). It requires lots of patience. If you try to rush the melting, you will probably ruin your chocolate. It requires CLEAN and DRY utensils and pots (cold liquids/water will ruin your temper as well). It works best in bigger batches (you can double this recipe and add different flavors, but it may not come out right if you halve it). That being said, truffle-making isn't really that hard, there are just lots of ways that you can go wrong. Be adventurous!",
      "In a small saucepan over medium-low heat, heat the whipping cream. Be sure to stir very frequently or else a film will form at the top of it (skim it off if this is the case). Bring to a boil while continuing with the next steps, then decrease the heat. Continue to stir.",
      "Add the salt.",
      "Set up a double boiler (a medium metal bowl or saute pan over a medium sauce pot) with about 1 inch of water at the bottom of the bottom pot (the water should NOT touch the top pot, and there should be no gaps for the steam to escape). Put it on medium heat until the top pot is warm to the touch (a minute or two) then decrease the heat to low.",
      "Add about a third of the chopped bittersweet and milk chocolate to the top of the double boiler. Stir it gently until it has melted, checking that the temperature never reaches 100\u00b0F (using a candy thermometer or checking it to your body temperature - it should be about the same).",
      "Add the next third of the chocolate and the beaten yolk (optional). Stir until the mixture thickens and the chocolate is melted.",
      "Add the rest of the chocolate and pour the warm cream over it.",
      "Immediately remove the top bowl from the double boiler and set it on the counter. Carefully wipe off any condensation as you do so to prevent the chocolate from spoiling.",
      "Continue to stir gently (at this point, vigorous stirring will create bubbles). The residual heat should melt the remaining chocolate in a few minutes. If it does not, you can put it back on the double boiler for a short while.",
      "After the chocolate is melted, stir in the rose water and Amaretto until the texture is smooth and silky.",
      "Cover and refrigerate for about 1/2 hour so that the chocolate firms up a little.",
      "Once the chocolate is more moldable, scoop out rough, rounded teaspoon sized balls (use a small cookie scoop if you have one). Work quickly with minimal hand contact; do not worry about making them perfect yet. You may need a pair of plastic gloves if you have problems with melting.",
      "Refrigerate the balls for about 5 minutes more, then you can pull them out again and perfect the shape. Put them back in the fridge when you are done.",
      "Meanwhile, put the bittersweet and milk chocolate for the shell into a microwave safe cup or bowl. Pick one that will allow you to immerse the truffle entirely.",
      "Microwave the chocolate for 15-20 second bursts on 60% power (this may vary with your microwave's power; it is better to start out real slow until you get a feel for it). Stir briefly between each burst. After about a minute or so, the chocolate should be mostly melted and you can use the residual heat to melt the rest while stirring.",
      "Use skewers, dipping forks, or plastic forks to quickly immerse the truffle into the chocolate, then slide it off onto a plastic plate or a piece of wax paper (you may need a second utensil to help shove it off. Work as quickly as you can so that the truffle doesn't dry onto the fork). If you start to get a melty mess, put the truffles back into the fridge for a little while.",
      "Once all of your truffles are happily dipped, put them back into the fridge (again) for about half an hour so that the shell will harden, and then start pigging out! Enjoy! :) You can save the excess shell chocolate for your next truffle adventure.",
      "ALTERNATIVE COATINGS:",
      "Roll chilled truffle balls into a mixture of confectioner's sugar and a splash of rose water.",
      "Pipe a pink rose on top of the hardened shell.",

      "Use white chocolate and dye it pink to make pretty flowers (make sure that you use oil-based dyes, not food dyes!).",
