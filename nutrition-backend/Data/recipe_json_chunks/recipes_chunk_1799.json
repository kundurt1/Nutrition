      "Cover tightly, and refrigerate for at least 3 1/2 hours (or up to overnight).",
      "Prepare for dredging About an hour before you plan to cook the chicken, remove the pieces from the marinade and allow them to drain on a wire rack set over a rimmed baking sheet.",
      "(This allows the excess marinade to drip off and the remaining marinade to lose some of its moisture and become slightly tacky, so the coating will adhere better and produce a crisper crust.",
      "The chicken will also come to room temperature, allowing it to cook more quickly and evenly.)",
      "Meanwhile, whisk together the flour, cornmeal, and seasonings, and spread in a shallow bowl or pie plate.",
      "Heat oil When you are ready to begin frying, pour just under 1/2 inch oil in a large cast-iron skillet, and bring the oil to 375F over medium heat.",
      "(If you dont have a thermometer, try this test: drop a cube of white crustless bread into the oil; it should turn golden brown within 1 minute.)",
      "While the oil is heating, use tongs to dredge the chicken pieces.",
      "Make sure they are thoroughly coated, shaking off the excess flour for a nice, even, lump-free crust.",
      "(You can also do this in a large resealable bag: scoop some of the flour mixture into the bag, then add a few pieces of chicken at a time; seal bag and shake to coat.)",
      "Set the dredged pieces on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper as you work.",
      "Fry Heat oven to 200F.",
      "Before beginning, set a wire rack in a rimmed baking sheet and set several layers of paper towels on top of the rack for draining the chicken.",
      "Working in batches, arrange the chicken pieces skin side down in the pan in a single layer.",
      "Remember to add enough pieces to fill the pan, without touching.",
      "After placing the chicken in the pan, the temperature of the oil will drop dramatically.",
      "Make sure to adjust the heat as needed to maintain a steady temperature of between 330F and 340F during frying, as this will help the parts cook evenly, inside and out.",
      "Cover the skillet during frying to help the chicken cook through evenly (and reduce spattering), peeking inside to check on the progress.",
      "(Using a probe-style thermometer allows you to monitor the temperature of the oil without lifting the lid.)",
      "Once the first side is crisp and golden, after 4 to 5 minutes, carefully turn the pieces.",
      "Be sure not to turn them too soon, or the crust will tear; they should release easily from the pan.",
      "Then cover the pan again and continue frying until the other side is crisp and the meat is cooked through (it should register 160F for breasts, 165F for thighs on an instant-read thermometer).",
      "This should take another 4 to 5 minutes, depending on the size of the pieces.",
      "Check each piece in the batch and remove it as soon as it is ready.",
      "Wings, drumsticks, and thinner breast pieces cook faster than the thighs and thicker breast pieces, so remove these first.",
      "Transfer to rack on prepared baking sheet and keep warm in the oven.",
      "Return the oil to 375F before adding the next batch.",
      "Small chickens called fryers (2 1/2 to 3 pounds) are tender and best for frying.",
      "Follow instructions on pages 110111 for cutting a whole chicken into 10 parts; this includes cutting the breast pieces in half diagonally, as shown, to separate the thicker part from the thinner, quicker-cooking section.",
      "You can buy a cut-up chicken, but youll pay more.",
      "Buttermilk lends the chicken a subtle tang.",
      "Because it contains lactic acid (which also has a tenderizing effect on proteins), it also helps the chicken remain moist and juicy.",
      "Cornmeal adds extra crunch to the coating.",
      "When frying the chicken, keep extra vegetable oil (room temperature) nearby; if the oil in the pan gets too hot, you can cool it down by adding some of this.",
      "A cast-iron skillet is the best pan for frying chicken, since it will conduct and hold heat more effectively than other types of skillets.",
      "If using a 10-inch pan, cook the chicken in two batches.",
      "An instant-read thermometer is the most accurate way to determine whether the chicken parts are cooked through; to test, remove a piece of chicken from the oil and insert thermometer into the thickest section, away from the bone.",
      "Wire racks are ideal for draining the chicken, after marinating and after frying (wash them well between uses to avoid contamination); set them on rimmed baking sheets to catch any drippings.",
      "Line the racks with paper towels for draining fried pieces; this will help absorb oil while also allowing air to circulate underneath to preserve crispness.",

      "so the flavors can meld (before you add the lettuce), as is usually the case with homemade salad dressings.",
      "This was fairly garlicky, but I love garlic and usually add extra to recipes - I didn't add any extra garlic and I really liked this- perfect for me, but would be okay with more garlic as well.",
      "Finally, I definitely would keep in the anchovies- If you chop them fine (and I even chopped them before I put them in the blender) you don't even know they're there, it's not fishy, but it does add to the caesar dressing.",
      "Also, I found that all of the oil was needed in the blender for it to blend, but in the future, I will add the other ingredients (milk, red wine vinegar) to get it to blend and then slowly dri.",
