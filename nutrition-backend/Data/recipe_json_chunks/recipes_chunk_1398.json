It can be dangerous to cut a round parsnip into planks with a chef knife (if it rolls, you can cut yourself), so make your life easier by creating a flat edge: Cut a long, thin piece from the side of the parsnip and discard it. Roll the parsnip so that the flat side is facing down on the cutting board. Now, when you try to cut 1/4-inch planks, the parsnip will sit flat and you will be much less likely to cut yourself.",

      "Prepare a flat, shallow and round non-stick skillet. There are two ways of forming the crepes. You could either start with a cold pan, add the batter and swirl the pan to let the batter run in different directions to form a circle. Or you could start with a hot pan, and use a wooden \"T-shape\" stick to spread the batter into a circle. I find that the wooden stick method is easier because this is quite a thick batter to let \"swirl\", and I'm not psyched of the idea of cooling down the pan for every new crepe. So I made my own T-stick by sticking two disposable chopsticks together, which has proven to be a flimsy, one-time-use-only device that was released from its duty right after this. But I thought it did the job pretty well.",
      "Heat up the non-stick skillet over medium heat. Depending on the size of your pan, add enough batter so it can be spread into a thin crepe that fits the diameter of the pan. Use the T-shape stick to swirl over the batter and spread it out. This will take a couple of practices but after the second (or third...) one, it would all come together. Let the crepe toast on the pan until some bubbles start to form and rise up. Flip the crepe over when the first side starts to brown, and do the same for the other side. When both sides are slightly browned, it can be taken out of the pan and cool on a plate. Repeat this for the rest of the batter.\r\n\r\nPS, These crepes can be frozen for whenever they are needed. Just insert a piece of parchment paper in between each crepe, slide into an air-tight bag and freeze.",
      "When ready to make the egg crepe, whisk the eggs, milk and salt in a bowl and set aside. Heat up the same non-stick skillet used for making the crepe over medium-high heat. Add 1 tsp of oil then approx 3~4 tbsp of the eggs mixture. The pan should be hot enough so the eggs would immediately start to sizzle and bubble. QUICKLY lay 1 crepe over the eggs BEFORE THE EGG COOKS so that the crepe could stick to the eggs. Sprinkle a bit of white pepper over the crepe and flip the crepe when the bottom of the eggs is browned. This would happen VERY QUICKLY, like within 30 sec if the temperature of the pan is correctly hot. Toast the crepe side until it's nicely browned as well, then fold it in half and take it out of the pan. Repeat with the rest of the eggs and crepes.",

Over this time, the flavor and color will leach out of the rhubarb, leaving the alcohol rosy and the rhubarb a sickly yellow-white (the exact amount of time this takes will vary).",
      "When the rhubarb has finished steeping, strain it from the alcohol, and filter the solution through several layers of cheesecloth or, preferably, a coffee filter. Measure the final amount of alcohol -- this is your base number. In a saucepan, heat 1.5 times that amount of water, and 1/2 - 3/4 that amount of sugar, depending on how sweet you like things (I tend towards the middle). To give an example: 4 cups rhubarb alcohol would need 6 cups of water and 2-3 cups sugar. Let the sugar syrup cool, then add it to your filtered alcohol. Taste (the flavors will be a bit harsh), and add more sugar if desired. Let age for at least a month before enjoying. Rhubarb liqueur keeps at any temperature, but is especially delicious straight from the freezer."

      "In the bowl of a stand mixer, whisk the yeast into the water along with 1 tablespoon sugar. Let sit until foamy, about 5 minutes.",
      "In a large bowl, whisk the remaining sugar, baking powder, nutmeg, salt, and 4 cups of flour together.",
      "Add the butter or shortening, egg yolks, and vanilla to the yeast mixture. Mix for about one minute to break up the butter or shortening.",
      "Slowly add in the dry ingredients, then switch to the dough hook and knead the dough for 2 minutes. The dough should be tacky and soft and may barely stick to the bottom of the bowl. If the dough seems very sticky, slowly add in more flour until just tacky. Once kneaded, transfer the dough to a lightly oiled bowl, cover, and let rise until doubled in size, about an hour.",
      "While the dough is rising prepare the cranberry jam by adding all of the ingredients to a medium saucepan. Bring to a simmer and cook over medium heat until the cranberries have softened and burst. Remove from heat and let the jam cool for 15 minutes, then use an immersion blender to blend until smooth. Fill a pastry bag fitted with a bismark tip (pictured) or a large round tip.",
      "Transfer the risen dough to a lightly floured work surface and roll into a circle about 12 inch thick. Use a floured 2-inch round cutter to cut as many donuts as possible. Transfer the cut circles to a lightly floured baking sheet and let rise, uncovered until almost doubled in size, 30 to 45 minutes.",
      "About 15 minutes before you are ready to fry the donuts, heat a large pot or dutch oven with at least 2 inches of oil over medium heat until the oil reaches 350\u00b0 F on a candy thermometer. Brush off any excess flour and fry the donuts for about 1 minute per side, being careful not to crowd the pan. When the donuts are deep golden brown on each side, remove them from the oil.",
      "Let the donuts cool slightly, then use the pastry bag to fill each donut with about 2 teaspoons of jam. Dust with confectioner's sugar and serve immediately. These donuts are best the day they are made."

The heat of 5 Hot NM Chiles is about the same as 2 Jalapenos. You can go up or down in heat and use Poblanos, Thai Chiles, Jalapenos, or even Bell Peppers if you really want to cool it down. Same goes for the various red powders. You could substitute cayennne, crushed red peppers, liquid hot sauces, paprika, all kinds of things for your specific tastes.",

      "You're going to need a cookie sheet big enough to spread all of this okra out on. You might need to use two smaller ones. I suggest using parchment paper on the cookie sheets as it seems to help keep veggies from burning and makes clean up easier. Spread your okra pieces out on the parchmented cookie sheet(s) evenly. You don't want them crammed together too much but a little touching probably won't hurt.",
      "The roasting time seems to vary with a lot of factors including your own tastes and your oven. Use convection setting if you have it. Go for about 20 minutes but keep an eye on it until you get a feel for how long it takes in your oven. I pull it out when it's softened but still about half crunchy if that makes sense. You're going to cook it to completion on the stove-top so better to take it out of the oven sooner than to burn it. If you're just really unsure, then go 20 minutes and call it good.",
      "While the okra is roasting, heat your mustard oil and olive oil together in a large skillet, large enough to hold all the okra and other ingredients with room to stir. You can just use olive oil if you don't have mustard oil or you can go with all mustard oil if you really like it. It gives a nice kick.",
      "At about medium heat, toss the cumin seeds into the oil and mix around for about a minute and then add the diced onions. Cook until softened.",
      "Once the onions are softened, toss in the fresh ginger and green chiles. Mix this all up good. If the okra needs more time, reduce the heat to simmer while waiting on it.",
      "Once the okra is done roasting in the oven dump it directly into the stove-top pan and add the tomatoes. Note that we tried fresh tomatoes but the flavor just seems to get lost, canned held up better. Turn up the heat to high until you get it back up to boiling and then turn it back down to simmer. Stir, taste, simmer, repeat until it reaches the level of done-ness that your like. At this point, you can add a little salt to taste if you must but don't salt it earlier because supposedly that causes the okra to get more slimy.\r\n\r\n Don't forget to turn the oven off !",

However, you should cut off the skin of the celery root before chopping, preferably even generously. If you cannot find a whole root, use celery sticks. That works as well. Wash them under running water and chop roughly. Halve the leek lengthwise and rinse with cold water to remove the sand between the leaves. Remove the roots and cut the leek halves in thirds. Just as with the celery, there is a good substitute for leek: spring onions. Clean these by removing the outer leaf and roots. Subsequently, divide the spring onions into three. Peel the ginger, chop it roughly and add the vegetables, parsley, spices, salt and sugar to the chicken.",
      "Bring the broth slowly to a boil and simmer on medium flame for about 75 minutes. Remove the chicken and giblets, peel off the meat from the bones and use it for other dishes. You can eat the giblets as well and do not have to dispose them. I usually enjoy them right away, fresh from the pot and still warm.",
      "Pass the broth through a sieve and squeeze the vegetables with a spoon until all the liquid has dripped off. Pour it still hot into clean glasses and close each glass immediately. The glasses can be stored in the refrigerator for several days. It is also a good idea to fill the broth in plastic bags that close airtight. You can freeze the bags flat in the fridge as soon as the broth is cold. This way you save space and the broth is quickly defrost whenever you need it."

Heat the butter and oil in a skillet (preferably cast iron) over medium low heat. It's best to keep the heat on the lower side so the breadcrumbs don't brown too quickly. When the butter is melted and oil is hot, add the chops, 2 at a time, and cook without moving for 4 to 5 minutes. You want the crust to be golden, NOT dark brown. Take a peek, if it's browning too quickly, flip the chops sooner and lower heat slightly.",

      "Adjust the racks in the oven to make sure the baking dishes will fit, preferably around the middle where the temperature is more even. You'll want to put the heavier baking dish underneath a lighter one or baking tray. Allow room for any vegetables on another shelf if roasting at the same time. Preheat the oven to 390 degrees F (200C).",
      "Mix all the other ingredients for the chicken together in a small bowl or jug.",
      "Roast the chicken for about an hour. You can use an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh to check temperature. It should be about 165 degrees F (73F). If you don't have a thermometer don't fret. Stick a small sharp knife or a skewer (an equally handy tool for baking and roasting) into the thigh. The juice that runs out will be 'clear' when the chook is cooked. If the juice is still a little bloody, leave to roast a while longer. The crust should golden with bits of dark caramelization from the marinade.",

      "Place in the oven. Turn after 15 minutes, and cook a further 15 minutes or until just tender. When cooked through and slightly caramalized, remove from oven and cool a little, so you can handle them.",

      "Dressing?Mix all the wet ingredients, salt and pepper and half the herbs together in a small jar, jug or bowl.",
      "You can also ADD lots of other tasty things to the salad, that you might have on hand. Such as:\r\n+ Toasted pine nuts\r\n+ A handful of dried cranberries OR Currants (briefly marinated in the vinegar)\r\n+ Some cooked lentils, chickpeas, quinoa or cracked wheat (burghul) if you want a larger dish and more protein.\r\n+ Scattered with crumbled soft goat cheese (chevre)",
      "TIP: To make life easier, measure dry ingredients first, then the oil for the marinade. Measure the honey last. The oil coats the measuring spoon so it is not so hard to clean up after the honey and you get it all in the recipe, not on the spoon."

If you have less than 3 cups of tea at the end of things, then turn your dial down a bit next time, or simmer for less time. These times work perfectly on my stove - but it is a crappy electric stove, so who knows :) You can play with the quantity of ginger too - I like LOTS! I will be posting a recipe for a mixture of teas you can use to get a nice balance of flavours and the edginess of cheap tea similar to street chai in India.

You could use chickpeas out of a can, but you'll never get the same pleasing al dente texture which gives this dish a very necessary bite.",
      "Next, you have to prepare the tripe. Ask your butcher to make sure that your tripe is cleaned and ready to cook. If you can't get your hands on clean tripe, you'll have to purify it by first removing excess fat from the side opposite the honeycomb which is whiter than the creamy color of the tripe. Then you rub and scrub the tripe thoroughly all over with course sea salt. Rinse several times with water, place in a dish and pour the vinegar over it. Let stand for 30 minutes and then rinse well. Congratulations, now your tripe is ready for cooking!",
      "From here, it's long but easy sailing: cook your tripe, covered in water with 3 bay leaves and 2 crushed garlic cloves. You can cook it in a pressure cooker for half an hour or simmer it for three hours in a normal pan on medium heat. It should be tender and soft, if it isn't yet, cook it a bit more but make sure it still got a bit of a bite to it so it doesn't fall apart by the time you get to the end of the dish. Always make sure your tripe is continuously covered in water when cooked. When cooked, drain, remove bay leaves and garlic, let cool and cut into strips of 4 cm. It doesn't matter if it's a bit irregularly shaped, this is rural cooking and adds to the charm.",
      "With regards to the chickpeas: drain and wash them thoroughly. To facilitate digestion, first cook them for 10 minutes, pour out the water and add new water and cook for another 30 minutes until al dente (be aware that chickpeas you've had laying around in your cupboard will have to cook longer), drain and set aside. Now you're ready to put the recipe together.",
      "Roughly chop up your onion, peel and chop up your carrot into the same size (it doesn't have to be fine, you want it to be chunky and rustic) and sweat in a big pot on a medium heat in olive oil. Add a bit of salt to help the onion break down and release its sweetness. In the meantime, chop up the garlic quite finely and when the onions are translucent, add your garlic and stir. Let cook for about 4 minutes.",
      "Meanwhile, rinse the chorizo under cold water, put the tip of your knife under the skin, tear it off and cut into bite-size chunks. Add the chorizo and stir until the chorizo starts to release its deep red color.",
      "Add paprika powder, the three remaining bay leaves, stir and let fry for another minute or so to allow the paprika to \"wake up\".",
      "Next, add your glass of wine and let it simmer for five minutes until your wine has reduced by half. This is when you add your chickpeas, tripe and chicken stock. With the lid off, let the stew simmer on a low heat, stirring every once in a while, and let reduce until the whole dish has transformed from a watery soup to a thick, unctuous stew. This should take about 30 minutes.",
      "Taste and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. If you love paprika as much as I do, you probably won't be able to resist adding just a bit more before you serve it in your most beautiful earthenware dish with some crusty bread in the middle of the table and let everyone dig in."

Put the shallots and vinegar in that jar too, instead of on the salad. So, in essence, you'll combine the cucumbers and the string beans in one container, and just before you're ready to serve, toss with the dressing, cherry tomatoes and shallots. The juices from the tomatoes, by the way, once combined with the other dressing ingredients, will make it really tasty. ;o)",

If you need to roast some, put however much you want in an ovenproof dish and roast at 350 degrees Fahrenheit until just soft.

Cook them in a big pot, then rinse and keep them aside for later.",

It's always better to chop the herbs while they're dry; place every single bunch of herbs separately on the cutting board and then, using a sharp knife, chop the herbs to smaller pieces. Then soak them in cold water using a pasta colander and a bowl. Wash & Rinse them with cold water and set them aside for later. Trim, wash and chop all the spring onions too. (white and green parts)",
      "prepare the \"nanna dagh\" by adding 80 ml of sunflower oil in a small pot/pan, when is hot, turn the heat off, remove the pot/pan from the flame, add 2-3 tablespoon of calamintha nepata and set aside for later.",

Then put the pot/pan back on the flame and let the garlic fry until very golden and almost brown. Remove from the pot and set aside for later.",

Cook on medium heat until the turmeric and the potato starch loosen their rawness and the mixture comes together, remove from the pot for later.",
      "Use the same pot, add a tablespoon of prepared caramelized onion, when it's hot add the chopped spring onions and fry them until soften and translucent, then add 1 small cup of chopped spinach and stir until soft, pour 2-3 liter of boiling water. Turn the heat off and use a blender to blend the onions and spinaches, until you have a very fine and thin mixture. This is not a traditional way to do it, but it helps a lot to thicken your soup.",

      "To make the strudels: Lay the phyllo dough out flat on your table. Cover with a barely damp towel. Once you start working with the phyllo dough, you will want to work fairly quickly because it tends to dry out. Lay a sheet of phyllo dough on your work surface. Brush or dab it lightly all over with melted butter. Place another sheet of dough on top. Lightly dab it with butter as well. Repeat with a third phyllo sheet.\r\nWith a knife, cut the phyllo down the center, dividing it in half lengthwise. Place a heaping tablespoon of the filling on each half. Gently yet tightly roll the strudels up about 2/3 of the way. Fold the sides in to close the ends of the strudel, and continue rolling it up the rest of the way. You may need to add a little more butter to help seal the strudel. This should make 10 to 12 strudels. (It is OK if they look a little ragged; a homey, rumpled look is part of the phyllo mystique.)\r\nYou can make the strudels up to a day ahead to this point. If you do, wrap each strudel in wax paper, place in a single layer in a pan, cover tightly with foil or plastic wrap and refrigerate until you are ready to cook them.",
      "To cook the strudels: Lightly spray a baking sheet with nonstick cooking spray. Arrange the strudels on the sheet so they are not touching one another. Lightly brush the tops of the strudels with a little melted butter or extra virgin olive oil.\r\nHeat oven to 450 degrees, bake 4 to 6 minutes, turning pan once, back to front, to cook evenly. If not nicely browned at the end of baking, turn oven temperature down to 300 and bake 2 to 4 minutes more."

    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "To prep broccoli rabe: Rinse thoroughly to remove any grit hiding among the leaves. Cut off the tough bottom ends, and split any stalks that are more than 1/2\" thick. Toss the rabe with olive oil, water and salt. Leave to soften for 5 to 10 minutes at room temperature. (Technique for prepping and grilling broccoli rabe adapted from Judy Rodgers' The Zuni Cafe Cookbook.)",
      "To prep ricotta: Mix together ricotta, lemon zest, Aleppo pepper, 2 to 3 tsp extra virgin olive oil, and just enough lemon juice to loosen to a good spreading consistency. Cover and set aside.",
      "To get the grill ready: Prepare a gas grill with all burners on medium, or a charcoal grill with hot coals. Clean the grilling rack if needed, and brush it with olive oil.",
      "To grill piadina: Brush both sides of each round with olive oil and grill over moderate heat, turning once, until golden and cooked through, about 2 minutes per side. They should be crispy and charred in spots but still soft and pliable. Remove from grill, and wrap in foil or a dish towel to keep the flatbread warm while you continue grilling.",
      "To grill broccoli rabe: Arrange the broccoli rabe in a single layer on the grill. Grill about 2 to 3 minutes per side, or until tender and blistered in spots. (Taste if you're unsure if the stalks are tender.) If the stalks are charring quickly but aren't tender, spray or drizzle a few drops of water on them. Remove from grill onto a large platter or sheet pan to cool. (You don't want to stack the broccoli rabe while it's still hot because it'll lose its crisp, papery texture.)",
      "To grill peppers and sausage: Brush each side of the red bell pepper halves with olive oil, then sprinkle with salt. Also brush the sausages with a small amount of olive oil. Grill until the red bell peppers are charred and tender, and the sausages are evenly browned and cooked through. Sausages are easy to overcook, so don't feel shy about using a meat thermometer. You're looking for about 140 degrees in the middle. Let the sausages rest for about 5 minutes, then cut each one down the middle lengthwise to open like a book. Cut each bell pepper into thin strips.",
      "To assemble sandwiches: Smear one side of each flatbread generously with the lemon-chili ricotta, then top with red bell pepper strips, sausage, and broccoli rabe.",
      "In a standing electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine the flour, baking soda, salt, lemon zest and rosemary. Add the lard and mix at medium-low speed until evenly combined. Slowly add the water, mixing until the dough is a cohesive mass. Switch to the dough hook attachment and knead until smooth, 5 minutes, at medium speed. (Alternatively, the dough can be mixed in a large bowl and kneaded by hand.) Divide the dough into 6 pieces (or 8, if you want slightly smaller flatbreads) and form each piece into a ball. The dough can be rolled out right away, or cover each ball with plastic wrap and let rest for 30 minutes until ready to use.",
      "Roll out each ball to an 8 to 10-inch round, about 1/8inch thick, on an unfloured or very lightly floured work surface. (I like rolling the dough between two pieces of plastic wrap.) Stack the rounds on a tray, with a piece of plastic wrap or parchment paper between each round. Cover the top round as well. Set aside until ready to grill."

      "CAKE: Preheat to 350 degrees. Put parchment paper on 15 inch baking sheet and grease parchment paper. Mix together flour, cornstarch, baking powder and 2 tbsp of the French Vanilla pudding mix. In a small bowl add the milk, 2 tsp vanilla, and oil. In a large mixing bowl, whisk the eggs, yolk and sugar (not the confectioner's sugar) to combine. Use an electric mixer at high speed for 10-15 minutes or until mixture falls in thick ribbons when beaters are lifted. When the whip is raised, the mixture should fall into the bowl and form a slowly dissolving ribbon. Add the vanilla toward the end of whipping. It is imperative the egg and sugar be about 3 times the size and light and fluffy as it contributes to the lightness of the cake. Using a rubber spatula, fold in the flour mixture. Another secret behind the lightness of this cake is to be patient and methodical; fold by turning the bowl clockwise to 15 minutes each after each fold. It may take 30+ turns. But halfway through the process of folding flour, pour the milk/oil/butter mixture down the side of the mixing bowl. (It will sink to the bottom of the bowl under the batter.) Continue folding using the same technique explained earlier, until the milk mixture is well incorporated. Remember, be patient and methodical as you do so. Pour batter into baking sheet. Then set aside and do the meringue. You may have to wash the bowl and whip for the meringue unless you have another set.",
      "MERINGUE: In a large bowl whisk egg whites until stiff. Add the sugar, in three or four parts, and vanilla, and continue to whisk until the whites have turned a stiff meringue. Spread meringue mixture over the raw cake batter, then sprinkle the almonds on top (optional). Avoid spreading meringue too close to the edges of the cake since the meringue will puff up and you want to avoid it overflowing on the sides. Bake at 350 degrees for about 30 minutes or until a skewer inserted in the middle comes out clean. Let cake cool for 30 to 60 minutes.",
      "FILLING: Whip cream for 30 seconds or so then add the 2 tbsp confectioner's sugar, the remaining 4 tbsp pudding mix and the remaining 1/2 tsp vanilla. Continue to whip until cream forms soft peaks. What I like with this filling is that 1) it can stay outside for a long time without weeping or breaking down and 2) it is only very slightly sweet which pairs nicely with the sweet meringue and the jam. You can also by the way use this recipe to frost a cake. Up to you if you want to increase the 2 tbsp confectioner's sugar to 4 or more tbsp.",
      "ASSEMBLY: Cut cake longwise. Carefully put on layer meringue face down on large platter, then spread the 1/2 cup (or more if needed) jam, then the diced strawberries (or other berries of your choice) and then the whipped cream.

While kneading, add flour slowly if the mix is so wet that it's sticking to your hands. The final dough should be tacky but not wet, smooth and elastic. Pat roughly into a ball shape.",
      "Oil a clean bowl that could contain at least twice the volume of your dough, place your dough ball at the bottom, cover with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place for an hour, or until doubled in size.",
      "Once your dough has risen, punch down gently to let the air out.",
      "Flour your counter and press (don't roll with a pin!) the dough out into a rectangle, roughly 14 x 10\" with around a 1/4 inch thickness. Have patience because the dough may be sticky or not want to stretch, and you don't want to tear the dough!",
      "Spread the pesto out onto the surface of the rectangle, leaving about a 2 inch margin on all sides. Sprinkle the grated cheese evenly over the pesto.",
      "Core and slice your tomato into rounds, as thin as you can possibly get them. It's OK if the rounds break, you won't notice in the final dough. The important thing is that they be thin enough to roll up easily in the next step.",
      "Lay the tomato slices out in one layer onto your dough rectangle, giving some space between slices (see the photos attached to this recipe for what mine looked like at this stage)",
      "Starting at the short side of the rectangle, very carefully and slowly use your hands to roll up the rectangle and fillings into a jelly roll as tight as you can. This might take you a few tries, and that's OK. It's a little bit unwieldy, but it should roll up nicely. I find it's helpful to move your hands from side to side as you roll forward to keep the ends in check, rolling at the same speed as the middle. If you lose some filling, just unroll, reassemble and try again! End the roll so that the seam isn't visible and touching the counter.",
      "Keeping that seem against the counter, and using a serrated knife if you can, trim the unfilled and probably kind of floppy edges of the roll. You can totally proof and bake these and they'll taste great!",
      "Using the serrated knife, with almost no pressure at all and a very gentle sawing motion cut the roll into 6 relatively equal sized slices. See my photo above for how these looked for me.",
      "Preheat the oven to 450 degrees. Coat an 8x8 baking dish with a thin layer of olive oil. Slide each slice of your roll into the dish. A large knife or spatula will make this much easier. Place them in the dish so that they're evenly spaced from one another. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm spot in the kitchen for 30 minutes or until roughly doubled in size and the buns are touching each other.",
      "There will probably be liquid at the bottom of the dish after the buns have proofed that came out of the tomatoes or pesto. That is OK! It's part of the reason why this dish has such a high baking temperature, and it helps the outsides of the buns get crisp.",
      "Remove plastic covering and bake for 35 minutes. If the tops are burning or browning but the bottoms aren't cooking, cover with foil. These are done when the top is brown and crisp; the interior will seem doughy, but it will continue to cook and set as it cools.",
      "Cool these completely in the pan on a rack or stovetop before eating; the interior of the buns will be very, very hot, and continue to cooking for as long as they're hot out of the oven."

    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "OPTIONAL but recommended prep step: Ideally the evening or a few hours before you want to serve this, wipe/clean the outsides of your squashes. Cut them in half, sticking your knife in at the top, going through or right next to the stem. Using your fingers, pick out the seeds and place directly on a baking sheet, trying to get as few stringy-parts as you can (a few are ok). Once you've pulled out all the seeds, place a dry paper towel on top of them and press it down all around them to absorb as much moisture as you can. The seeds will be sticky and will stick to the paper towel - that's ok. When the paper towel is mostly saturated, pick off the seeds sticking to it and discard the paper towel. Spread seeds evenly on the sheet and place in oven (turned off) overnight or for several hours to help dry out the seeds. If you are doing this the night before, at this point I recommend scooping out the stringy insides of the squash and discard. You can then put the squash halves back together, using a rubber band to keep them in place, and put in the fridge until the next day.\r\n\r\nWhen you check the seeds (the next morning or after a few hours), they should be noticeably dry and slightly stuck to the sheet, but will come off easily when scraped with a spatula or your fingers. Loosen them up and spread evenly again. Roast in a 250 degree oven for 5-10 minutes. Be careful - these are VERY easy to burn. I recommend continuously setting a timer for 3-min intervals and checking that often. Seeds are done when they are crispy to the bite. When finished, toss with a little oil and salt/pepper/spices of your choice.",
      "If you skipped step one, wipe/clean the outsides of your squashes. Cut them in half, sticking your knife in at the top, going through or right next to the stem. Scoop out the stringy insides of the squash with a spoon or grapefruit spoon if you have it. If you did not do step one, you can save the insides to pick out the seeds later, or just discard.",
      "Place squash halves on a roasting pan with the skin side touching the pan. Sprinkle each one with a little oil, using your fingers to spread the oil around each half, then sprinkle each with salt and pepper. Roast for about 35-50 minutes at 400 degrees, until they are golden and a fork goes in easily. When done, turn the oven off but keep squash inside to stay warm.",
      "While squash are roasting, place about 2 cups of yogurt into a small and pretty serving bowl. Wash, dry, and finely chop your handful of herbs (or scallions), then stir into the yogurt. Wash your lemon and zest it directly into the bowl. Cut lemon and squeeze half of it into the bowl, catching seeds with a small sieve. Stir and taste. Add more lemon juice if you like. Put yogurt sauce in the fridge until serving time.",
      "Wash and cut your kale or other greens into roughly bite-size pieces. If using greens with a thick stalk (like kale), I remove the stalks and chop them into small pieces to add to the stir-fry as well. Chop/dice your onion and any other veggies your adding. Crush garlic, peel it and then roughly mince.",
      "Heat your saute pan on medium heat. Add a good glug of oil and your garlic, onions, chopped kale stalks, and any other hearty veggies (save greens for the end). Saute until fragrant and mostly softened. Turn heat down if it's going too fast. Cut open your sausage packages and add directly to the pan. Using a spatula or wooden spoon, break up the sausage into bite size pieces. Allow to brown and cook thoroughly, flipping and mixing after a few minutes on each side. When you're pretty sure the sausage is cooked, place all the greens on top. Add about a quarter cup of water, then cover with a lid to let the greens steam. After about a minute or two, remove the lid. Greens should be brightly colored. Mix in thoroughly and turn off the heat.",
      "At this point your squash should be ready. Place squash halves on plates, one half per person. Carefully spoon sausage mixture into each squash to make a heaping portion. Top with a few spoons of yogurt sauce, and (optionally) some toasted squash seeds. (If you did not make the seeds, you could also top with a few nuts, breadcrumbs, or other crunchy topper of your choice. OR it's also perfectly delicious without a topper!) Serve with spoons and remind guests to scoop bites of squash along with bites of sausage mixture! Keep yogurt sauce on the table in case folks want extra."

      "Preheat the oven to 375\u00b0 F. Line a 9- by 13-inch pan with parchment paper, making sure the parchment hangs over the sides. You'll need to use it as handles later in order to remove the cake from the pan.",
      "Remove the pits from the dates and discard them. In a medium saucepan, combine water and baking soda and bring to a boil. Add the dates to the water, remove from heat, and let soak for 30 minutes.",
      "As the dates soak (and you do want to do this next step as the dates soak, as they should still be warm when they're needed next), use an electric mixer fitted with a paddle attachment to cream the butter and the sugar until fluffy, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the egg and mix until fully incorporated. Add the salt and mix. Add the flour 1/2 cup at a time, mixing until just incorporated.",
      "Drain the dates and add them to the mixture. Add the chocolate and mix until evenly distributed. It will begin to melt into the warm dates-that's good. Transfer the batter (which will be very thick) to the cake pan and spread it with a rubber spatula.",
      "Bake for 15 to 17 minutes, until the center is still gooey and wobbly but the edges are set. Let the cake cool completely in the pan, then wrap it very well with plastic wrap and stick it in the freezer until it is completely frozen.",
      "When the cake is in the freezer, lower the oven temperature to 350\u00b0 F. In a baking dish, toss the bananas with raw sugar. Bake until the bananas are very tender and the sugar is bubbling dramatically all around them.",
      "Transfer the bananas to a blender and add the salt, lemon juice, cream, and milk. Blend on high until very well combined.",
      "Chill the mixture until it is very cold, at least 3 hours. I recommend chilling the mixture as your cake freezes.",
      "When the cake is frozen, churn the ice cream according to the manufacturer's instructions. When the ice cream has been churned, spread it onto the frozen cake. Wrap the whole pan very, very well in plastic wrap and send it back into the freezer for at least 3 to 4 hours or, preferably, overnight.",
      "When you're ready to eat the cake, make the magic shell. Add the chocolate to a microwave-safe container with the coconut oil. Melt in 30-second intervals until liquid. Drizzle over the cake and let harden.",
      "Remove the whole cake from the pan using the parchment handles. Let it sit at room temperature for 5 to 10 minutes, until it is soft enough that you can slice it with a knife. Serve with forks."

Once all the sugar has been added, continue to beat until glossy, mostly-stiff peaks form.",

Continue doing this until you've incorporated all the chocolate-butter mixture. Now add a spoonful of the meringue and gently fold until mostly combined (some remaining streaks of white are good-it means you haven't overmixed). Add a little more and, again, fold until mostly combined. Continue doing this until you've added all the meringue and it's mostly combined, taking care to not overmix or deflate the batter. Now fold in the whipped cream in the same way.",

Cool completely in the pan on a wire rack. The center will sink into a dramatic crater-that's good. \r\n\r\nWhen you're reading to eat, whip the remaining 1 1/2 cup cream until slouchy, soft peaks form. Add this to the sunken center of the cake, spreading and swirling it, but making sure to leave a distinct chocolate cake border.",
      "Shave more bittersweet chocolate on top, if you'd like, before serving. Run a dull knife around the edge of the perimeter of the cake, then unmold the springform. Use a serrated knife to slice into big wedges."

    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "Start the process about two to three months before the weather starts to warm, when it's about 50\u00b0 F out (the miso will need to ferment outside over the warmer months.) In a large pot of cold filtered water, soak the soybeans for 18 hours. Drain the beans, return them to the pot, then refill the pot with water to about 5 inches (10 centimeters) above the beans. Bring to a boil over high heat, lower to a simmer, and cook for about 1 1/2 to 2 hours, uncovered, until the beans are soft. The idea here is to simmer the beans in just enough liquid so that they cook through, but that most of the liquid will be boiled off eventually. (Traditionally, the beans are steamed for 1 1/2 hours in wooden steaming boxes stacked over a large cauldron set over a very hot wood fire. N.B.: If you steam the beans you will need to double the amount of seed miso and water that you add to the mash with the koji and salt.) The beans can also be cooked in batches in a pressure cooker for about 20 minutes over high heat.)",
      "While the beans are cooking, slowly whisk 1/2 cup of hot water into the seed miso, then allow to cool to room temperature (the solution should be like a very thin miso soup in consistency).",
      "Drain the cooked beans and start mashing them into a coarse consistency. I like to grind them roughly in batches in the Japanese grinding bowl (a suribachi). Alternatively, you can run the cooked soybeans through a sterilized meat grinder. Or, you can opt for the low-tech squeeze between your thumb and index finger method. When the beans are smashed to your satisfaction (chunky or smooth), allow them to cool to room temperature (too hot and it will kill the spores). Pour in the rice koji, then sprinkle in about 80% of the salt, and add in the miso thinned with water. Knead well to distribute the rice koji and salt with the mashed beans.",
      "Place a large crockery pot, small wooden barrel, or food-grade plastic vat on the floor, with a piece of plastic sheeting underneath. Then, using your hands, form tennis ball-sized spheres of bean mash and throw them into the container with all of your might. Whack! Splot! You are looking for a satisfying splat that sounds like thunk rather than a weak glurp. Or (if you are lazy like me, with stunningly bad aim), you might mash the balls in with your fist and the heel of your hand to ensure that all air pockets have been filled. The bean mash should only fill the container about halfway full. Pat down the surface of the mash with the flat of your palm and sprinkle with the remaining salt.\r\n\r\nAt this point, you can store the unfermented miso mash in the refrigerator until the weather cools to at least 50\u00b0 F. (The miso needs to go through a cold winter, a cool spring, and a hot summer to properly ferment.)",
      "Smooth a clean muslin cloth across the surface of the mash and let it drape down over the sides of the container to keep out flying leaves or other debris. Place a wooden or plastic drop lid on top of the cloth-covered mash surface and weight it evenly with 4 1/2 pounds (2 kilograms) rocks or heavy objects that equal at least the weight of the mash. Cover with one more large muslin cloth and wind some twine a couple of times around the circumference of the barrel to tie the cloth in place. The cloth will act as a mold barrier and will become scarily dusted with green mold spores, so don't skip or replace with plastic. Carefully remove to wash when you stir the miso.",
      "Let the young miso sit undisturbed in a shaded area outside until the weather warms. From May, start stirring the miso about once a month to avoid mold as the fermentation arc starts to ramp up. During the hottest period, you should probably stir the miso (from the bottom up) every 2 weeks to avoid mold forming. Ideally the weather should become muggy, and the temperatures should rise to about 100 \u00b0F (38\u00b0 C) at the height of the summer, but avoid direct sunlight. If you see any mold on the surface, carefully scrape it off. Clean the inside surface walls of the container with a vodka- or shochu-soaked cloth to deter mold. If you are feeling particularly adventurous, you could smooth a 1-inch (2.5-centimeter) layer of sake lees across the surface of the miso in June or July to seal and inhibit mold produced by oxidization. In this case, you really want to completely cover the surface to make a homogeneous layer (you still need to use the cloth, drop lid, weights, and outside cloth cover). Peel off the sake lees when the weather turns cool in the late fall, and recycle the lees as an instant pickling bed.",
      "If you have not sealed the miso with sake lees, check the miso after the summer to see if it has mellowed to your liking. At this point, you can refrigerate it or just leave the miso in its fermenting container until you start your next batch in the coming winter. No need for weights once the miso is done-you can leave it outside if the weather is cool; otherwise store it in the fridge for easy access."

The rich broth is balanced perfectly by the fresh pops of corn, and the barely cooked kale adds a nice texture, while the potato bulks the soup up. If you like a creamier soup, blend half the soup until smooth and then add back to the pot and stir before serving; however I really enjoyed the thin broth coupled with the firm veggies. This simple soup is quite cheap to make, and packed with flavour- enjoy!"

Add a pinch of chipotle flakes and saute another 30 seconds or so, until fragrant, then add mushrooms and toss to coat in fat and aromatics. Saute mushrooms until they have given up their liquid and are golden-brown. Deglaze with pickled jalapeno brine, stirring to scrape up any browned bits and delighting in the heady aroma now enveloping your nostrils. When the brine has mostly evaporated, hit the mushrooms with a couple spoonfuls (2-4 tbsp) of the tomato vinaigrette. Stir to coat, and cook until the vinaigrette caramelizes a little and the mushrooms take on a glazed appearance. Dump the mushrooms in a bowl and microplane the garlic over the top. Hit it with a pinch of chopped fresh marjoram and toss a few times. Set aside until ready to use, or wipe out the skillet and repeat the process for each additional pound of mushrooms.",

Add the mushrooms, the ricotta, a little of the pasta cooking water, and another pat of butter if you please. (I please.) Toss.

Begin pulling mint leaves off, the little one go directly into the water. The medium sized leaves are ripped in half, and the largest leaves just rip into thirds. Quickly put into the cold water. Don't use any stems. (You can cut with a knife but it seemed to take more time, switching from pulling off stems, then washing to cutting. Use a stainless steel or ceramic knife) \r\nPut mint in the measuring cup, and if it's not enough, return the prepared mint back to the cold water bowl, then continue ripping more mint.

If you're using a candy thermometer you'll be looking for a 240 degree temp, a candy thermometer is ideal as most recipes call for one. As for me who is yet to own one I pour a 1/2 teaspoon of the syrup, after 10 min of rapidly boiling, in a cup of cold water. At the perfect temperature the syrup will form a soft ball that can be flattened to the touch. Disclaimer!! boiled sugar is HOT! Please be careful!",
      "When your sugar syrup is at the perfect temperature, start your stand mixer on medium and slowly (and very carefully) pour the syrup in a slow and steady stream down the side of your mixing bowl into the bloomed gelatin. Once its all in cover the mixer with a clean tea towel and turn the speed up to high. Let this glorious mixture whip for 10 min-12 min.",
      "While the magic happens, thoroughly spray (with cooking spray) a 9' x13' baking pan or any equivalent pans you'd like.",
      "After the 10- 12 min of whipping the mixture should resemble shiny soft serve ice cream. Stop the mixer and be prepared for some stickiness! A good tip is to spray a spatula with some cooking spray. Working quickly, empty the marshmallow into your greased baking pan getting as much from the mixing bowl as possible. Spread the mixture out as evenly as possible and smooth the top with your clean hands that you sprayed in some cooking spray as well!",
      "Let the marshmallow set for 6- 24 hrs, my favourite spot to keep this is above the fridge, just out of reach!",
      "Lastly, combine your icing sugar and corn starch. Its a good idea to sift these ingredients as well so that they a truly combined and free of lumps. Take 1/3 of this mixture and dust it over the marshmallow pan. Then flip the pan over onto a cutting board, the marshmallow should just fall out in one solid rectangle. Dust the outside with more of the dusting powder. Oil a sharp knife and start cutting any shapes and sizes you like. Toss all the individual piece in the remaining powder mixture until they are no longer sticky. Store in a air tight container, I find that separating the batch into Ziploc bags works well too and is good for transporting! Enjoy at your leisure, the marshmallows should remain fresh for several weeks!"

Once all the slices are salted, place a plate on top and a weight (such as a tin of beans or tomatoes) and leave for 1 hour. During this time, the eggplant slices will weep a brownish, bitter liquid. (It's not so much for the flavor that you need to do this but because they will \"drink up\" less oil when fried if they are salted first.) Rinse them under cold water and carefully pat them dry with clean tea towels.",

Fry 3 to 4 slices at a time, giving a few minutes on each side, until they are evenly golden brown. Drain on paper towels and let cool.",

Place a layer of eggplant, then spoon over a layer of tomato sauce, a few torn up basil leaves, and a handful of grated cheese. Continue eggplant, tomato sauce, basil, and cheese, ending with a more generous layer of cheese. Bake at 350\u00b0 F (180\u00b0 C) for 25 to 30 minutes, or until bubbly with a golden brown crust has formed. It's best to let it sit for about 15 to 20 minutes before cutting into it, and it's also delicious served tepid rather than piping hot."

      "While you wait for the chocolate concoction to cool, get on with the rest of the cake. You will need two separate bowls to prepare the eggs in. You cannot beat your yolks in the bowl of your mixer, pour it out and then start in on your egg whites or they will never whip and stiffen. The slightest trace of fat in the bowl, or anything that comes in contact with the whites, and they will give up on whipping for you without second thought.",
      "So, in one bowl, cream your egg yolks, sugar, vanilla and Amaretto until it turns a pale canary yellow and falls from the mixer/beater in a smooth, constant ribbon. Fold in the cooled chocolate-butter mixture and almond meal and set aside.",
      "Whip the egg whites in a separate bowl until it forms stiff peaks.",
      "To marry the two, spoon out about a quarter of the whites into the chocolatey yolks. Without any concern for deflating the whites, stir them into the mix. Doing this helps to loosen and aerate the mixture and makes folding, in the truest sense of the word, so much easier.",
      "Once you've beaten in the first quarter of the whites, add the rest of the whites to the mix and, with a rubber spatula, fold the whites in gently. The best method to do this is by cutting into the center of bowl on an angle, through the whites and yolks, to the bottom. Scrape the spatula along the bottom and sides of the bowl and in a single motion fold it over the whites. Turn the bowl about a quarter-turn and repeat. Ideally, you'd do this as few times as possible because the more folding you do, the more air you will loose and you want to keep as much air as possible. Since there's no flour or leaveners you are relying solely on the egg whites to give the cake some bulk and make it rise.",
      "Pour the batter immediately into a greased and sugared 9\" spring form pan and bake for 20 - 25 minutes. Keep an eye on it after the 20 minute mark though, as it can start to scorch a little (if it does it's not the end of the world-you can flake any really dark bits off and cover them up with the cream later). You'll know it's done when the edge of the cake pulls away from the sides of the pan just slightly and the center has a slight wobble to it.",
      "Remove the cake from the oven and set on a cooling wrack, in the pan still, to cool completely before retiring it to the fridge. It will get much firmer and denser in the fridge but it does benefit from having a slight chill to it. The cake will fall a moderate amount from the height it had risen to, but this is normal and leads to a much fudgier, chocolatier cake.",

Scrape the contents into a food processor or blender. Add only enough vegetable stock to make a smooth, tender sauce that can be dispensed from a ladle, about 24 ounces. Taste, and adjust seasonings if necessary.",

Melt the butter in a stainless steel saucepan. Once the water has cooked off and the foam subsides, stir in the flour. Cook only until it is a pale golden color. Add the saffron, then whisk in the milk 8 ounces at a time. The mixture will thicken and turn a color you'll want to paint on a wall. As you add more milk, the consistency will thin nicely, and color pale. After all the milk has been added, continue cooking, stirring with either a flat-bottomed wooden or heatproof spatula until it reaches a soft simmer. Continue cooking and stirring for about 15 minutes to cook out the floury taste. Season to taste with salt and pepper at the end. Technically, you should use white pepper, but if you don't have it, go ahead and use some fresh-ground. Life will go on.",

Taste, then season with salt and pepper. Remove the mushrooms to a bowl. Save the stems for your next batch of vegetable stock.",
      "Return the skillet to the heat, and add some more olive oil, 3 or 4 ounces. When hot, add the spinach. Again, sprinkle with some salt. Keep the spinach moving about as it wilts. When all has softened, cook for a couple of minutes more, then remove from the heat.",

      "In a large mixing bowl, combine both flours, salt, and thyme, and whisk together until well blended",
      "Slice the stick of butter into small pats or cubes, dropping each piece into the flour mixture as you go",
      "Using a pastry cutter, two forks, or your thumb and forefingers in a pinching and rolling motion, break the slices or cubes of butter up, cutting them in to the flour mixture, until the largest pieces of butter you're seeing are pea-sized. Try to work quickly so that the butter stays as cold as possible. The mix will be extremely dry and crumbly.",
      "Make a little well in the center of the mix with your fist. Grate the clove of garlic into the well on the finest side of a cheese grater, or chop finely.",
      "Pour all of the buttermilk into the well, and using a rubber spatula gently fold the buttermilk and garlic in with the dry mix. Try and do this with as few turns as possible, since the more you work the dough the tougher it will be. It's especially helpful to use the spatula to get all the way under and pick up any dry flour underneath. If it's still not coming together after a couple of turns, add cold water from the tap one teaspoon at a time until it does.",
      "Knead the dough just a couple of times to bring it together. It should feel tacky but not stick to your hands; if it's too wet, add just a little bit of AP flour at a time. Pat the dough into a flat, round disc, wrap tightly in plastic wrap, and place in the freezer while you prepare the filling ingredients, for at least 30 minutes.",
      "Preheat the oven to 450 degrees. Grate the cheeses and mix together in a small bowl so that they're evenly combined together. The mix should be quite salty, but taste to see if you want to add any more salt.",
      "Core the tomatoes and slice into the thinnest rounds you can possibly get. I find that a serrated knife works best. If the slices break and aren't full rounds, it doesn't matter -- the tart just looks pretty with slices intact. Lay some folded paper towels or a kitchen towel down and put the slices on top, to drain some of the excess moisture. Peel and slice the shallots or onions into very fine slices as well, like you would to top a burger, either full rounds or \"half moon\" shapes. Set aside.",
      "After you've prepared your filling ingredients or 30 minutes have gone by, whichever comes first, pull your pastry dough from the freezer. It should be firm and stiff but not frozen solid. If it's still very soft, give it another 10 minutes in the freezer.",
      "Pour about 1/4 C all purpose flour into a small dish to use for rolling and set on the counter. Flour the counter and set your unwrapped pastry disc on the flour. Flour the top of the disc and the rolling pin as well.",
      "Starting from the *middle* of the disc, roll out and away from you with even pressure all the way to the edge of the disc. Give the disc a quarter turn, and repeat. This may seem like a slow way to start, but it helps the dough keep a more circular shape. If pieces of dough break off or make a really craggy outer edge, pull them off and stack them in the middle of the disc to roll again.",
      "Continue rolling your pastry until it's about 1/4 inch thick, continuing to flour as you go to keep everything from sticking. The shape doesn't really matter here, the tart will have a rustic look no matter what!",
      "Preheat your oven to 450 degrees.",
      "Line your baking sheet with a mat or parchment paper. Transfer your rolled out dough to the sheet so that it's laid out on the sheet roughly centered, even though dough may be hanging over the edges for now.",
      "Sprinkle the cheese mixture evenly onto the pastry in a circular shape, the largest circle that you can form on your baking sheet while still leaving about 2 inches of pastry dough all around the margins. This will be roughly the shape and size of your tart, so the circle must fit on the sheet itself, even though most likely the dough will be hanging off the sheet right now.",
      "Arrange slices of shallots or onion on top of the cheese, evenly spread out, most likely you'll only have enough to make one layer.",
      "Arrange the slices of tomatoes on top of the cheese and shallots, in a single layer so that no tomatoes are overlapping. Then, make a second layer of tomatoes on top of the first layer with any remaining tomatoes. Stay as close to that circular shape you outlined at first with the cheese as possible.",
      "Fold the edges of the uncovered pastry over and onto the filling, making a circular shape. You do want to \"trap\" the filling under the lip of the pastry, making a sturdy and roughly circular shape that will hold all the filling in while baking.",
      "Bake the tart for an hour and 15 minutes, or until the edges are deeply brown and crisp, the filling is bubbling, and some of the tomatoes on the top are browned. The tart will be very hot when it comes out, so let it cool for a good 15 minutes before slicing and serving.",
      "Tart will keep well in the fridge for a few days, and can easily be re-heated in the oven at a low temperature to re-crisp the crust, or be eaten cold."

Add the eggs and water and mix on low speed for a few seconds, then increase the speed to medium and mix for 3 minutes, until the dough comes together. Add the salt and then start adding the butter, a few cubes at a time, mixing until it is incorporated into the dough. Continue mixing for about 10 minutes on medium speed, until the dough is completely smooth, elastic, and shiny. During the mixing, you will need to scrape down the sides of the bowl a few times and add a small amount of flour onto the sides so that all of the dough doesn't stick too much.",

Repeat the rolling, filling, and re-rolling with the other half of the dough and filling.",

With the cut sides facing up, gently pinch one end of each half together, and then lift the right half over the left half. Repeat this process, but this time lift the left half over the right so that you're making a twist. Try to keep the cut sides facing outward. When you get to the end, gently squeeze the two halves together. Carefully lift the cake into one of the prepared loaf pans. Cover the pan with a damp tea towel and leave to rise in a warm place for 1 to 1 1/2 hours. The loaf will rise and get puffy but will not double in size. Repeat the process to make the second loaf.",

Cook until the sugar dissolves, then remove the pan from the heat. As soon as the cakes come out of the oven, brush them liberally with the syrup. Use all of it. Let the loaves cool for about 30 minutes, then remove them from the pans to cool completely."

If you don't have a dishwasher, you can sterilize them by placing them in a large pot of boiling water for 5 minutes.",

Place the spice bag in the pot with your vinegar mixture and make sure that it's submerged in the pickling liquid. Bring the liquid up to a simmer, and simmer for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.",
      "While the pickling juice is simmering, cut your cucumbers and pack your jars. For the cucumbers, cut off the ends and discard, then cut the cucumbers into quarters. I find the easiest way to pack my jars is to do so with them on their sides. Arrange 1 dill frond and a dill flower in a beautiful pattern, and then carefully stack cucumbers on top of them. Get as many cucumbers into the jar as you can, and then turn the jars right side up.",
      "Once the pickling juice is done simmering, discard your spice bag and pour it through a small strainer into your packed jars. There should be approximately 1/2 inch of headspace between the pickle juice and the top of your jar. If there are any air bubbles in your jar, shake them out, or poke them out with a sterilized butter knife.",

Don't boil, as this may damage your seals. Dip a clean paper towel in the boiling water in your large pot and use it to wipe the rims of your jars. Using a canning lid magnet, grab the lids and place them on your jars. Screw the rings onto your jars until you first meet resistance and them unscrew them a millimeter or two. This is important for creating a seal.",
      "Once the lids are on your jars, immediately place them into your large pot of boiling water, so that all of the jars are submerged. If there is a lot of extra space in the pot, add empty jars to prevent your pickles from knocking around, tipping, or breaking. Cover and process for 15 minutes.",
      "After 15 minutes, remove your jars and place them in a cool dark place where they can sit undisturbed for 24 hours. You should hear little \"pops\" as the jars seal and the lids are sucked in towards the jar. The pickles can then be eaten immediately, but are best enjoyed after they've been given a couple of weeks to pickle. They are shelf stable in a cool, dark place for up to a year. If you have a jar that doesn't seal, don't fret. Just place it in the fridge for up to a couple of months."

Use a pastry brush to paint the egg wash around the perimeter of half of the circles. Place one to one and a half teaspoons of cooled filling in the center of the rounds with the egg wash. Top the filled rounds with a second circle of crust and use a fork to crimp the edges. Freeze the pop tarts on the baking sheet for 2 hours. Refrigerate the whisked egg in the meantime.\r\nWhen ready to bake, preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Vent the top of each rectangle by poking the top of the pastry with a fork 1-2 times and brush with the remaining egg wash, if desired. Bake the tarts, uncovered, for almost 25 minutes or until golden brown. Allow to cool before topping with glaze.",
      "To prepare the glaze: Whisk together the powdered sugar and 2 tablespoons of juice until smooth. You can add an additional tablespoon of juice if desired, but be sure to keep the glaze thick enough to stay on the pop-tart. You can test how it spreads on the back of a large spoon or try it out on a single pop-tart before you glaze all of them."

Cut off the heel of the bulb, and then slice the bulb in half lengthwise. On a mandoline or by hand, slice each half crosswise, more thinly than the celery root. Cut the red onion in half lengthwise, and slice into wispy half moons. Toss the vegetables into a large mixing bowl.",

Use your hands (or tongs) to evenly blend the salad ingredients. Divide the salad between plates; enjoy. You may drink the dressing that collects at the bottom of your bowl. I won't judge."

      "Place the garlic, sherry vinegar, mustard, lemon and orange juice in a medium bowl and mix to combine. Season with salt and pepper and let sit about 10 minutes.",
      "After 10 minutes, pour the olive oil in in a slow and steady stream, whisking constantly. Taste and adjust the seasoning. If the dressing is too strong for your taste, you can add a bit of honey or a bit more orange juice to lighten it up.",
      "To prepare the vegetables and eggs:\r\nBring a large saucepan filled with generously salted water to boil. Add the fingerlings and cook until tender when pierced with a fork, about 10-15 minutes.",
      "Remove the potatoes and add the green beans, boiling until cooked but still crisp, about 5 minutes. Remove the beans from the pan and place in an ice bath. This helps stop the beans from cooking and retains the bright green color.",
      "Add the three eggs to the same saucepan filled with boiling water. Let cook nine minutes, then remove to an ice bath. Once the eggs are cool enough to handle, tap them lightly on a hard surface just to crack, then return to the cool water (this allows water to permeate the shell, making it easier to peel). At this point you can peel the eggs, cut them in half length-wise and then cut each half in thirds.*",
      "To prepare the tuna:\r\nPlace the tuna on a small plate or in a bowl. Add the juice of half a lemon plus salt and pepper and let sit about 10 minutes.",
      "Just before you are ready to eat, heat a cast-iron skillet to high heat and rub with a bit of canola oil (assuming your pan is properly seasoned - if not, add more oil).",
      "Pat the tuna dry, season with salt and pepper and add to the pan, cooking only about 2-3 minutes per side, just until lightly browned.",
      "While the tuna is cooking, pour the sesame seeds on a small plate that fits the tuna. Remove the tuna from the pan and dip all sides in the sesame seeds. Let rest about 5 minutes then cut into thin slices against the grain.",
      "Dress the salad, arrange the tuna with the additions on a platter and serve!"

      "For the Veggies:\r\nIn a large skillet on high heat, add vegetable oil. When the oil begins to lightly smoke, add onions and let cook for 1 to 2 minutes. Throw in remaining brocoli, carrots, and mushrooms. Cook on high, stirring regularly, for 3 minutes. \r\n\r\nTurn down heat to medium, and cover for 5 minutes to let the vegetables steam.\r\n\r\nRemoving lid, turn the heat back up to high, and with the remaining Ginger Garlic Soy Sauce, pour over the veggies to deglaze the pan.
