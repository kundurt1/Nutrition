When ready, you will be able to hear the jam crackle when you stir, and you can also make a clean streak with your spoon that will expose the bottom of the pot. Err on the side of underdone jam. If you want, use the freezer and spoon method that you can research in many books on making preserves.",

You will also notice a round depression in the center of the lid if the seal is successful. Any jars that do not PING should go into the refrigerator for immediate use.

While the blender is running (by removing the center plastic small insert in the lid) and pour in the milk, warm water, lemon zest, mustard, and melted butter. Scrape the sides of the blender as needed. Mix until completely smooth. You can also do this step in a food processor or with a whisk, a bowl and a desire for a little workout for your arms. Replace the plastic insert and put the blender in the refrigerator for 1 hour. (You don't HAVE to let it sit for an hour in the frig before making your crepes, but by giving the batter additional time to absorb the flour, it makes the crepe less likely to tear.)",

Microwave the soy cream until bubbling (or heat it up over medium heat in a saucepan), pour in the chopped chocolate, and cover. Let this sit for 5-6 minutes, then uncover and stir well to distribute the melted chocolate. Add the butter and stir it in. Leave this in the fridge until you use it, as you want it to be more solid to prevent making too much of a mess!",
      "First, make the dough. Place the warm water and yeast in a large bowl and stir well. Leave until frothy, about 5 minutes.",
      "Now, stir in the coconut milk, aquafaba, sugar, melted butter, vanilla, and salt.",
      "Add the flour, and mix with your hands until a shaggy dough forms, Continue to knead until it comes together in a smooth, elastic ball. Place this back in the large bowl and cover with a damp towel. Place this in a warm place until it is doubled in size, about 1 hour.",
      "Grease and line a large bread loaf pan (9 x 5 x 3 inches). If you only have the smaller size (8 x 4 x 21/2 in), make two loves with this recipe. When the dough is ready, knock it back down and pour it out onto a well-floured countertop.",
      "Roll the dough out into a large rectangle about 1/2-1/4-inches thick.This is the ideal thickness if you don't want to struggle to roll it up! My rectangle is usually about 12 by 19 inches. Roll it out so the longer side is facing you.",
      "Spread out the COMPLETELY COOL ganache evenly over the surface of the dough, leaving a 1-inch border so it doesn't get too close to the edge of the dough. It should be a slightly thicker consistency than Nutella. Sprinkle the pears over the ganache evenly, then roll the dough up away from you into a tight log, like you would when making cinnamon rolls.",
      "Take a very sharp knife and cut the log in half lengthwise, then flip each piece so the cut sides, with the layers of dough and ganache, face upwards. Cross the strands over each other into an X, then twist the strands over each other on either side of the X, until all the dough is twisted.",
      "Squidge the twisted log so that it is the same length as your bread pan, Then lift it up gently and pop it into the loaf pan. Cover and proof for 30min-1hour, until it has risen a bit and looks fluffy. 20 minutes before the bread is done with the second proof, preheat the oven to 180C",
      "Bake the babka, rotating the loaf pan halfway through, until golden brown, 50-60 minutes. If it starts to brown too much, just pop a bit of foil on top of the loaf. Transfer the loaf in the pan to a wire rack and let babka cool in pan 1 hour, before removing it. If you are making two loaves, bake for 35-40 minutes. To check if the loaf is done, insert a skewer and it should not come out looking sticky or doughy (try to avoid a chocolate-rich spot when doing this test!)",
      "Optional step: Many babkas have a syrup poured on top of them. If you like your desserts sweet, just warm up about 1/4 cup of agave/rice syrup and brush over the cooling loaf."

This is important because a small amount of air can be released while it's in the canner, which will create a vacuum as the jars cool.",
      "Place the jars into a water bath canner. Process by boiling for 20 minutes.",
      "After 20 minutes have passed, remove the jars from the boiling water using a jar grabber and store them someplace where they won't be disturbed for 24 hours. You should hear \"popping\" sounds as the jars seal. If you have a jar that doesn't seal, put it in the refrigerator and use it within 1 month. The sealed jars are shelf stable for 1 year if stored in a cool, dark space. It's best to store them with the rings off so that moisture doesn't get trapped under them and compromise the seal. Once opened, each jar may be stored in the refrigerator for 1 month.**",
      "* I used 1/8 tsp of minced hot pepper seeds which made a moderately hot salsa.\r\n**For food safety purposes, that acid and salt balance relative to produce was based on a recipe for Zesty Salsa from the Ball Blue Book. I have simply further explained the steps of the canning process for you, have added the step of pureeing the mixture with a hand blender, added seeds for extra heat, and added sugar and lemon juice. Always use canning recipes that have been tested for food safety. Never decrease acid, sugar, or salt in a canning recipe."

Transfer to a lightly floured surface, and knead until fairly smooth, about 2 minutes. Transfer the ball of dough to a greased bowl, and cover with plastic wrap. Place bowl in a cold oven, and let sit for 1 hour; transfer bowl to refrigerator, and let sit for at least 8 hours or up to 24 hours to ferment. This ball of dough is the biga, a quick and simple starter that imparts large bubbles and a lightly fermented flavor to the dough. Remove biga from refrigerator, and let sit to come to room temperature, about 30 minutes.",

Add remaining 3 1/4 cups flour, along with oil and salt, and stir until dough forms. Let the dough sit to allow flour to hydrate, about 20 minutes (the term for this process is called autolysis).",
      "Knead dough, which will be very wet and sticky, in the bowl until it begins to tighten and becomes smooth, about 4 minutes. (The dough for this bread must be very wet to achieve its light and airy texture.) Transfer the dough to a lightly floured work surface, and continue kneading, using a bench scraper to help if necessary, until smooth and elastic, about 6 minutes more. At this point, the dough will be sticky to the touch but will release from your hands fairly easily. It will also have formed a tight skin on the outside that can hold its shape when stretched lightly.",
      "Transfer the dough ball to a lightly greased bowl, and cover it with plastic wrap. Place the bowl in a cold oven, and let the dough rest until it doubles in size, about 2 hours. (When you press your finger into the dough, the fingerprint should spring back slowly. Lightly dust a sheet of parchment paper with flour, and set it on a rimless baking sheet.)",
      "Lightly dust a work surface with flour, and transfer dough to work surface. Using a bench scraper or a chef's knife, cut dough into two equal-sized pieces, and flatten slightly. Fold the top and bottom edges of one piece toward the middle, and flatten dough at the seam with the palm of your hand; turn dough over, seam side down, and shape into a 12 inch log. Transfer log to the prepared, floured parchment paper, and repeat this folding and shaping procedure with remaining dough piece. Lift the parchment paper between the loaves slightly. Loosely cover dough logs on baking sheet with plastic wrap, and transfer to a cold oven; let sit until dough logs double in size, about 90 minutes. (Because the temperature in kitchens can vary, thus speeding up or slowing down a dough's rise, placing the dough in a cold oven keeps the temperature more constant.)",

Using the corner of the parchment paper as a guide, slide the loaves, still on the paper, onto the baking stone; and position evenly on the stone. Place ice cubes in skillet (this produces steam that allows the loaves to rise fully before a crust forms on the exterior). Bake loaves until dark golden brown and crisp, about 50 minutes; let cool before serving."

    "ingredients": [],

      "Key Point: The unique behavior of bleached cake flour is vital to this recipe's success; unbleached cake flour will cause the angel's food cake to collapse.",
      "Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat to 350\u00b0F . Have ready an aluminum tube pan with a removable bottom, roughly 10 inches across and 4 inches deep. Nonstick pans will not work. If the pan doesn't have stilts, set out a bottle with a slender neck that will fit into the mouth of the tube.",
      "Sift flour (if using a cup measure, spoon into the cup and level with a knife before sifting).",
      "Make the cake: Combine egg whites, sugar, and vanilla in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. Mix on low speed to moisten, about 1 minute, then increase to medium-low (4 on a KitchenAid) and whip for 3 minutes; the whites will look very dense, and dark from the vanilla. Add the lemon juice and salt, increase speed to medium (6 on a KitchenAid), and whip for 3 minutes; the meringue will be light but thin, not foamy. Increase to medium-high (8 on a KitchenAid), and continue whipping until the wires leave a distinct vortex pattern in the thick, glossy meringue, another 3 minutes or so, depending on the freshness of the whites. To check the meringue, detach the whisk; when whipped to very soft peaks, the meringue will run off the wires but retain enough body to pile up on itself in a soft mound.",
      "Sprinkle cake flour over the meringue and stir gently with a flexible spatula to disperse. Switch to a folding motion and work from the bottom up, cutting through the middle, until no pockets of flour remain. Pour the batter into the pan; if you notice a small patch of unmixed flour as you pour, incorporate it into the surrounding batter with a gentle wiggle of your spatula. The pan should be about two-thirds full.",
      "Bake until the cake has risen well above the rim of the pan, with a firm, golden blonde crust, about 45 minutes (206\u00b0 F). Immediately invert the pan on its stilts, or over the neck of the bottle, and cool upside down until no trace of warmth remains, at least 2 hours.",
      "Serve: Turn the cooled cake right side up and loosen the outer edges with a metal spatula. Lift the center tube to remove the cake, then loosen it from the bottom too. Invert onto a serving plate; the cake will slide right off the tube. With a chef's knife or serrated bread knife, cut into 10 or 12 servings with a gentle sawing motion, applying very little downward pressure. Angel's food is mostly air, so the big slices will be less filling than they look.",
      "Wrapped tightly in plastic, leftovers will keep for up to a week at room temperature. You can also drop thin slices of angel's food into a toaster to crisp like a campfire marshmallow.",
      "Troubleshooting:",
      "- If a speck of yolk slips into the whites, fish it out with an eggshell. If the yolk can't be removed, save those whites for Tahitian Vanilla Pudding or White Mountain Layer Cake and start fresh.",
      "- Extracts like peppermint and orange, made from essential oils, may cause the meringue to collapse; take care when experimenting with flavorings.",
      "- In a kitchen below 68\u00b0 F, cold air may cause the cake to contract and fall from the pan before its crumb has set. As a workaround, open the oven door and place the inverted cake on the stovetop, where drafts of warm air will stabilize its temperature.",
      "- Through trial and error, I've discovered that the highly polished sides of stainless steel angel's food cake pans may cause the cake to fall from the pan as it cools. For best results, use an untreated aluminum tube pan.",
      "Mix it up!",
      "- Brown Sugar Cinnamon: A cozy flavor for fall, or to end a heavy holiday meal. Sift the cake flour with 4 teaspoons ground cinnamon, and replace the sugar with an equal amount of light brown sugar (dark will not work as well).",
      "- Chocolate: However angelic its texture, this variation turns out as dark as devil's food. Reduce the cake flour to 3 ounces (2/3 cup), sifted with 2 ounces (2/3 cup) Dutch-process cocoa powder, such as Cacao Barry Extra Brute. After cooling the cake, use a slender knife or bamboo skewer to loosen it from the center tube too, as this version tends to stick.",
      "- Creamsicle: Pulse the cake flour with 2 tablespoons orange zest in a food processor for 1 minute. Replace the vanilla extract with 2 teaspoons orange flower water and the seeds from 1 Tahitian vanilla bean (split and scraped). Trade the lemon juice for 11/2 ounces (3 tablespoons) freshly squeezed orange juice.",
      "- Green Tea: The sweetness of angel's food mellows the bitterness of Japanese matcha, for a mossy-green cake with an earthy but aromatic flavor. Sift the cake flour with 2 tablespoons matcha. I love to serve slices alongside Whipped Chocolate Cremeux with a scattering of Cocoa Nib Crunch.",
      "- Lemonade: Grinding lemon zest into the flour helps release its essential oil, making this variation particularly aromatic. Pulse the cake flour with 2 tablespoons lemon zest in a food processor for about 1 minute. Omit the vanilla extract and salt. Increase the lemon juice to 11/2 ounces (3 tablespoons). Also lovely with lime juice and zest instead.",
      "- Roasted Sugar and Vanilla Bean: This is, without a doubt, my favorite way to make Angel's Food. It's not my \"basic\" recipe, because the process of roasting sugar is time-consuming, and not everyone keeps a vanilla bean on hand, but these two upgrades make the cake even more extraordinary. Replace the sugar with 15 ounces (2 cups) Roasted Sugar. Along with the vanilla extract, use the seeds from 1 Mexican vanilla bean, split and scraped.",
      "- Gluten-Free: Sift 2 ounces (1/2 cup) arrowroot, 11/2 ounces (1/3 cup) white rice flour, 11/2 ounces (1/3 cup) cornstarch, 1 ounce (1/4 cup) coconut flour, and 1 teaspoon baking powder into a medium bowl, then whisk to combine."

Season lightly with salt and pepper and stir to combine. Return the bacon and the chicken thighs to the pot, along with any juices from the plate, arranging the chicken skin-side down to absorb more color from the wine. Cook on high pressure for 25 minutes.",
      "While the chicken cooks, in a medium skillet, melt 2 tablespoons (30 grams) of the butter over medium-high heat until foamy. When the foam has started to subside, add the mushrooms and cook, shaking the pan frequently, until the mushrooms are tender and lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Season lightly with salt and pepper. Remove from the heat and allow to cool.",
      "In a small bowl, mash the flour into the remaining 1 tablespoon (15 grams) butter until it forms a smooth paste (this is the beurre manie).",
      "When the chicken has finished cooking, manually release the steam. Transfer the chicken to a plate, leaving the liquid in the pot. Discard the bay leaf.",
      "Using the Saute function, bring the cooking liquid to a simmer. With a wire whisk, beat in the beurre manie until the sauce becomes glossy and coats the back of a spoon. If the sauce becomes too thick, add the stock, starting with 1 tablespoon. Taste and adjust the seasonings, adding more salt and pepper as desired.",
      "Return the chicken, along with any juices from the plate, and mushrooms to the pressure cooker and heat them through in the sauce. Serve with buttered broad noodles.",
      "BEURRE MANIE: Sauces are one of the pressure cooker's weak points, as liquid cannot evaporate and reduce while it is sealed. Flour or other starch added to the pressure cooker before sealing could burn on the bottom or clog the vent holes. Given these factors, the sauce of a dish braised in the pressure cooker is thin. It's up to you, then, to thicken it. \r\n\r\nA classic beurre manie-or \"kneaded butter\"-is the perfect solution. Composed of equal parts flour and butter that have been mashed together, the paste is whisked into hot braising liquid at the end of the cooking time, turning the sauce thick and glossy, without lumps. \r\n\r\nBeurre manie is extremely easy to make-just use a fork to mash butter and flour together on a plate. But to save time, you can prepare a large quantity in the food processor. Divide it into 1-tablespoon portions and store them in the freezer. When you need to thicken a sauce, simply throw a frozen lump into your boiling braising liquid and whisk away."

Note: If you'd like to freeze some rolls to bake off at a later date, now is a good time to do it. Wrap the pan in 2 layers of plastic wrap and a layer of foil and freeze. To bake, let the frozen rolls come to room temperature and complete their final rise before baking.",

While they are baking prepare the glaze by whisking the cream cheese, confectioner's sugar, orange juice, and a tiny pinch of salt together until smooth.",

      "NOTE: *** It's IMPORTANT to choose the right pot for this dish. You want something that's flat-bottomed, and wide (NOT narrow) with enough depth (but NOT deep). The wide and flat-bottom provides enough surface area for browning, and the relatively shallow depth allow steam to escape without building up on the side of the pot, which is going to drip back into the pot and stop the ingredients from browning properly.\r\n\r\n*** It's also IMPORTANT to season along every step of the way. Season the meats while they are cooking, then season AGAIN once the vegetables are added. Then adjust/season AGAIN once the milk and tomatoes are added. Every time you add LIQUID to a pot of stew of some sort, always keep in mind that it will COOK DOWN/CONDENSE as water evaporates, so whatever tastes salty now, will tastes saltier once it's done.\r\n\r\n*** I didn't use wine (white or red) in this recipe as some traditional ragu might have. If you want, you can incorporate 1/2 cup of red wine in the beginning of step 2.\r\n\r\n*** The cups I used for this recipe are slightly larger than most. 1 cup = 250 ml.",
      "To prepare the ingredients: Finely finely mince the celery, onion carrots (smaller than dices), then set aside. I prefer doing this in a food-processor. Wash the dried porcini mushrooms to get rid of any sands and impurity, then set aside (no need to soak). Blend all the canned tomatoes with the juice inside until smoothly pureed, and set aside.",
      "STEP 1 - Browning the meat and vegetables (approx 30 min in total): Heat up the pan over medium-high heat and add 1/3 cup of extra virgin olive oil. Add the pancetta and cook until slightly browned, then add the ground pork and ground beef. Season with 1 tsp of sea salt/grey salt and 1 tsp of freshly ground black pepper. This is quite a large amount of meat and they WILL NOT brown immediately. Juice/liquid may ooze out but THAT'S OK, just keep cooking until all the liquid has evaporated, and that there's a layer of browning at the bottom of the pan, approx 15 min.",
      "Now add the porcini mushrooms. minced garlic, fresh thyme, minced rosemary and chili flakes. Cook until fragrant. Add all the minced vegetables (celery, onion, carrot), bay leaves, tomato paste and Parmigiano rind, and season again with 1 tsp of sea salt/grey salt and 1/2 tsp of freshly ground black pepper. The vegetables will release juice/liquid which is going to \"loosen\" the browning on the bottom of the pan. Scrape the brownings with a wooden spatula, then just as what was done before, keep cooking until all the juice/liquid has evaporated and that there's A BRAND NEW layer of browning forming at the bottom of the pan, approx 15 min.",
      "STEP 2 - Reducing milk and harvesting caramel (approx 1:40 ~ 2 hours in total): Once all the meats and vegetables have browned properly, add 1 1/2 cup of whole milk (if using red wine, add and reduce it down completely BEFORE adding the milk). Keep the heat on medium-high, and stir to evenly mix all the ingredients together. The milk will loosen the brownings and you will scrape it off with your wooden spatula to let it melt and become part of the sauce, then let it cook and the milk will completely evaporate and form ANOTHER NEW LAYER of brownings, approx 20 min. You see the repetition now, don't you? Then you add the next 1 1/2 cup of whole milk and repeat this process. If your stove tends to heat unevenly, move around the pan to \"maximize\" the brownings. Don't be afraid to let it get deeply rich and dark brown, as long as it DOESN'T BURN/BLACKEN (moving the pan also prevents partial burning due to centralized heat). You will harvest the caramel (the brownings!) in each of the 5 additions of milk, and by the end of it, you should have a pot of meat sauce that's rich and brown with intense flavor.",
      "STEP 3 - Adding and reducing the tomatoes (approx 1: 30 min): Once the last/5th addition of whole milk has been added, reduced and browned, you can now add all the pureed tomatoes. Season again with sea salt/grey salt and freshly ground black pepper. Stir to evenly mix the ingredients and scrape the brownings on the bottom of the pan. Reduce the heat down to medium-low and partially cover the pan with a lid (tomato sauce SPLATTERS like crazy!). Let the sauce reduce down by 1/3 to almost 1/2. Stir occasionally to prevent burning.",
      "To serve: Cook the pasta (I prefer fresh tagliatelle) according to instructions. In another pan, add a couple tbsp of freshly grated Parmigiano cheese (for each serving) and little nubs of butter (about 1 tsp for each serving). Add the cooked pasta to the pan with a generous amount of ragu. Cook and stir over medium-high heat until everything's incorporated together.\r\n\r\nServe with more freshly grated Parmigiano cheese and drizzles of extra virgin olive oil."

      "Add some butter and oil to a dutch oven or pot and saute the onions, sprinkling some salt and pepper on them as they cook. Once the onions have softened, remove them and set them aside. Add a little more butter and oil to the pot and brown the beef on all sides. Add some salt and pepper to the beef. Brown the beef in batches, if you have to, so you don't crowd the pot. Too much beef in the pot at one time will steam rather than brown the beef. You want nicely browned beef and some caramelization on the bottom of the pot. This gives lots of flavor. Once the beef is browned, stir in the reserved onions, garlic, vermouth, beef broth, tomato paste, dried thyme, paprika and sugar. Bring to a boil and adjust the salt and pepper. Turn down the heat to low, cover the pot and cook the stew for about one and a half hours. The stew should be very gently bubbling away on a low flame. Check from time to time and stir. Add more beef broth if needed. Once the beef is tender, after about one and a half hours, add the rutabaga and carrots. Continue cooking on a gentle boil until the vegetables are tender. This should take about thirty minutes or so. Once the vegetables are tender, mix one tablespoon of potato starch with one tablespoon of cold water. Stir this mixture into the stew to thicken the sauce. Continue cooking for five minutes or so. Serve the stew with minced flat leaf parsley and freshly minced thyme. Mashed potatoes, crusty bread or buttered noodles are great sidekicks."

If the purveyors of your supermarket have included that little bag of gifts with the neck, heart, etc. set them aside to use to make stock later. Place the chicken in a baking dish (make sure the breast is facing up!) and rub it with the olive oil and salt. Next stuff the onion and the lemon inside the chicken cavity. You probably won't be able to get all eight pieces in, but do your best and leave the rest in the baking dish. Now pop that bird in the oven and set the timer for 1 hour 15 minutes (about 15 minutes per pound plus 15 minutes extra). If as the chicken cooks it starts to splutter oil all over the oven, just cover it lightly with a piece of tin foil.",

Not all of us have a mother or grandmother who will have bought us a quick read meat thermometer for our birthday/Christmas/Hanukkah (if you are among those lucky few, then the chicken is done when it reaches 160 F). Otherwise, carefully removed the chicken from the oven (it's very hot!). You can jiggle the leg and if it's loose, the chicken is done. Or, if you are like me and prefer to err on the side of knowing my date won't die from food poisoning, cut open a thigh or breast. If the juice runs clear, it's done. If it's pink, stick it back in the oven for 10 minutes and then check again. Remove and let cool slightly before carving. Serve with a simple salad and couscous."

After a minute or so, when garlic starts to release its aroma, adjust heat to low and add vinegar to pan-the mixture will sizzle for a minute.

With motor running, drizzle in remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil. Add additional water a tablespoon at a time if mixture is too thick and isn't pureeing easily.

Using the tops of your hands, stretch dough out from the center until the dough is thin and uniformly opaque. You can also use your rolling pin, if you prefer. As you work, continually pick up the dough from the table, not only to help in stretching it out, but also to make sure that it is not sticking. The dough should be so thin that you can see the color and perhaps the pattern of the sheet underneath. Spoon filling evenly over dough until covered. Lift the edge of the cloth and gently roll the dough like a jelly roll.",

      "Prep your cabbage and carrots: Thinly slice cabbage and cut the carrots julienne-style. Put them in a big bowl. If you have outer leaves of cabbage, rather than compost them, set them aside to use as a top layer between your kraut and your weight (more details on this shortly).",
      "Add 1 tablespoon each of caraway and cumin to your vegetables.",
      "Cut open 3 Thai chilis and collect the seeds. Add them to your ingredients. Chop the skins of the chilis and add these too.",
      "Add 2 tablespoons of salt and massage into your ingredients for 3 to 5 minutes. Your cabbage will release water, which will serve as your kraut's brine. Don't forget to taste prior to packing-you may want to add more salt to your liking. The addition of salt is important for a multitude of reasons, but how much you add is up to you. Here's a nifty chart on salinity percentages for your reference: http://www.probioticjar.com/uploads/1/7/6/5/17656129/4012185_orig.jpg",
      "When the ingredients are nice and wet, pack them into your jar or crock. The goal is to pack down your vegetables until the brine is above your vegetables. Note: This can take time and a lot of strength! We have friends who use wooden spoons or even wine bottles to pack their kraut down below the brine. Packing it below the brine is important, because any vegetables exposed to air can grow mold. You can scrape off the mold (it's not dangerous), but you will lose a little bit of kraut.",
      "Once it's packed down, take the cabbage leaves we recommended you set aside from the beginning of the recipe and layer them over the top of your kraut. This way, the outer leaves will grow mold first, and you can simply toss them into your compost as they do.",
      "Now for your weights: My winning method on the fermentation bus is using 3 outer cabbage leaves on the top layer of my kraut, followed by several scrubbed and boiled river rocks. My river rocks were gathered from the Willamette River back home, so I know my ferments carry a little bit of my beloved Oregon with each bite. If you don't have any river rocks, you fill a small jar with water and sit it on top of your ferment; but if you have other ideas for weights that still allow your ferment to get some air exposure, give them a try.",
      "Cover your vessel with a cloth and rubber band to keep random bugs and dust particles out.",
      "Wait a week and taste your kraut. Maybe you'll want to keep it going another week, but it's good practice to try your ferments along their journey. Ferments will work at different speeds depending on their environment. Temperature is a huge factor: Most ferments thrive best at 68 to 76\u00b0 F, just like we humans do.",
      "When your ferment is to your liking, cover it with a lid and place in the fridge or other cold storage. Keeping your new kraut cool stalls the fermentation process, so you can enjoy the flavor you reached the day you sealed the jar."

      "Brush some of the remaining cream onto half of the dough rectangle, then sprinkle this half evenly with the blackberries, lemon zest, and 2 Tbs. sugar. Fold the other half of the dough over the top of the half with the berries, and press the two sides gently together, especially around the edges.",
      "Brush the top with the remaining cream and sprinkle with the remaining sugar. Then, use a very sharp knife to divide this berry-stuffed dough log into 8 individual scones - you can make them into squares or triangles, your pick. Use a spatula to transfer the scones to a parchment lined baking sheet.",
      "Bake until the scones are puffed and golden and deeply browned around the edges, about 15-18 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool for 10 or 15 minutes before eating. Scones are always best fresh, but they can be kept for a day or two and reheated in the oven. They also freeze and reheat pretty well."

    "directions": [
      "To make turkey stock with your leftover carcass after Thanksgiving, here is how my mom and I went about it this year: Separate the wings, thighs and drumsticks from the trunk (so that everything fits in the stockpot!) Sharp knives are hard to come by at my mother's so I couldn't manage to cut away the backbone, but I was able to break each of the thighbones in half - this helps to really thicken the stock as it cooks as the marrow can participate. Add the pieces to your largest stockpot and add vegetables on hand - we had some celery stalks, a few carrots, an onion which we halved, and the stems from a bunch of parsley - as well as spices and herbs - we used a bunch of thyme and the leftover sage stems from our stuffing, bay leaves, a few loose peppercorns and a cinnamon stick (this is my new trick to increasing the depth of flavor of any stock). Cover with water and place on the stove. Bring to a boil, add salt (about 2 tsp to a tablespoon), then reduce to a simmer and cook 4 hours before straining and storing. When stored, expect it to thicken up a bit (bone stock is like gelatin after all), but it will thin out again once rewarmed.",
      "To make the risotto, warm 4-5 cups of turkey stock on the back burner of the stovetop. Do not boil or simmer, you do not want to evaporate any of your delicious stock.",
      "On the front burner, melt the butter and oil in a large sautee pan with high sides (I actually use my wok a lot to make risotto!) Add the onion and a bit of salt and pepper and cook until soft and translucent, about 7 minutes. Add the sage, thyme, and garlic and cook for another minute until fragrant.",
      "Add the sweet potato \"rice\" and real rice to the pan and stir to coat with the butter/oil. Toast for about 3 minutes, stirring until the Arborio becomes slightly translucent around the edges.",
      "Add the wine to the pan and stir until mostly absorbed. Then add a ladle full of warm stock from the back burner and stir into the risotto (I have a habit of making figure of eights, but no idea if this has an effect on the final product...) Over medium heat, continue adding stock, ladle by ladle, into the risotto, stirring after each addition until mostly absorbed before adding another ladle-ful of stock to the pot. Continue this process until the rice is cooked and creamy and the stock is about gone, about 25-30 minutes. In the last 10 minutes of the process, shred in your leftover turkey so that it warms through and incorporates into the risotto.",
      "Remove from the heat and stir in the Parmesan cheese. Plate in bowls and allow to cool about 5 minutes (this improves the creamy texture), top with a little more Parmesan (and any leftover Thanksgiving green veggies you may have), and enjoy!"

You can let it simmer for anywhere from 30 to 90 minutes, depending on how much time you have, knowing the flavor will just get richer the longer you cook it. We let it go for about an hour. When you're nearing the end of your cooking time, preheat your oven to 550\u00b0 F, or as hot as it will go (with the pizza stone inside), and add the herbs to your sauce, letting them hang out for the last few minutes or so.",

      "When your oven is hot, you can prepare your dough. Start stretching it from the center, then move it around in a circle so that gravity stretches it and creates a natural crust. It helps to put some olive oil on your hands first. Place the dough on your floured surface & push it out with your fingertips until it's the size of your pizza stone. You can fold over the edges to create an extra fluffy crust. Take the pizza stone out of the oven, sprinkle it with some semolina flour and place your dough on it. Bake it for about a minute, or until it starts to bubble, then take it out. This last step isn't 100% necessary, but I feel like it adds a little extra crispiness to the crust.",
      "Next, brush your dough lightly with olive oil. Spoon out an even layer of tomato sauce (not too thick or it'll get soupy when combined with the burrata), followed by the garlic scapes, and pop it in the oven.",
      "Bake for a few minutes, then pull it back out and arrange your zucchini ribbons and squash blossoms on the pizza, sprinkling with a bit of salt. Now let it bake until the crust has reach a nice golden brown.

Create a hot and cool zone by shifting the burning charcoal around allowing you to control the heat levels as you roast the peppers. Place the washed and dried sweet bell peppers right on the grill and leave them uncovered and untouched.",
      "Let the peppers roast and you will start to see the skin turn dark and eventually black and ashen in color. Turn the peppers as they start to blacken so all sides are reaching the heat of the coals and once the skin blackened over most of the pepper, remove from the heat and place into a large brown paper bag.",
      "This will help the skin removal process as the moisture loosens the skin a bit. Using a covered space or table (try newspapers or paper towel) start to peel the skin off the pepper and break into the pepper and remove the stem, inner ribs and all the seeds. Lay the clean sections on clean towels and once all are peeled and prepared, you can begin to assemble this salad.",
      "In a large bowl, tear the roasted peppers by hand into small strips and then add the chopped celery stalks and leaves and the sliced garlic clove.",
      "Add a good drizzle of excellent quality olive oil and salt and pepper to taste. Mix this well, being sure to coat all the peppers with the oil before setting aside to rest. You can serve this immediately at room temperature or place in the refrigerator to cool.\r\n\r\nWhen ready to serve, remove from the refrigerator about 15 to 20 minutes before serving so the salad warms up for better flavor and consistency.",

      "Use a rectangular or square casserole dish (such as an 8x8 inch pan) - keeping in mind that a larger one will produce less layers and a smaller one will produce more.\r\n\r\nBegin with a dollop of ragu on the bottom, roughly spreading to all edges. Lay down your pasta sheets; a little overlapping is fine. A layer of ragu - just enough to cover - followed by a layer (or several dollops) of bechamel and a sprinkle of Parmesan cheese. Continue layering this way until you finish with ragu, bechamel and a final heavier layer of Parmesan cheese.",
      "Bake at 350\u00b0F for about 30-45 minutes, depending on the thickness, depth and size of your lasagne. It should be golden brown on top and you should see sauce bubbling at the edges. Let rest for 10-15 minutes before cutting and serving."

Add the remaining batter. Dust the top with a few pinches of the spice mix.\r\nPut it in the oven, on a middle shelf.",
      "Bake for 30 minutes at 375 degrees, then lower the temperature to 350 degrees and bake 15 minutes more. At this point the top will be browned and the edges will seem stable, but the middle will still look soft. You can leave it in the turned off oven where it will continue to cook and stabilize, about 15 minutes. It will have puffed up, but will deflate.",
      "When it has cooled, run a knife around the sides of the cake and pry a little to loosen the bottom. Remove it to an oval or rectangular platter. Garnish if you like, and serve in slices. It is delicate but its \"body\" is better the next day.",
      "NOTES: Instead of a loaf pan, use any 1 quart baking dish, but adjust the baking time -- the center will be softer. You can use whole milk ricotta, but we were happier with the outcome using part skim, and you can drain the ricotta for a firmer texture. Brown sugar can be used in place of Demerara. 1/4 cup of brewed espresso can be used in place of the instant powder and water. There is no substitute for the Mexican chocolate -- it has a unique texture that shines in this cake!"

      "In the morning of your cheese-making day, heat the milk and cream over a very low flame. Stir it frequently until it comes to 86\u00b0F. Turn off the heat (if you have an electric stove, you will need to move the pot off the burner) and sprinkle over the milk 1/4 teaspoon of cheese culture (the Flora Danica or Mesophilic Type B) and ? teaspoon of P. camemberti mold culture. Stir gently, cover the pot, and drape a towel over top. Leave the thermometer in the pot so you can keep an eye on the temperature.",
      "After 90 minutes of culturing, check the temperature. Turn the heat on for just a moment while stirring the milk, until it's up to 90\u00b0F. Dilute ? teaspoon of rennet in 2 tablespoons of cool filtered water. Drizzle it into the milk and stir gently for 1 minute. Cover the pot again and leave it undisturbed for 90 minutes.",
      "While the cheese is setting up, heat a large pot of water up to boiling. Submerge your cheesecloth, molds, cheese mats, and two cutting boards, and set aside to drip dry somewhere very clean.",
      "When 90 minutes have passed, the milk should have firmed up into a nice curd. Insert a long knife into the curd and pull it out. There should be a clean edge to the hole the knife left behind, indicating a firm curd. If it's a little more pudding-like, leave the curd for another 30 minutes or more.",
      "If the curds are firm, slice them inside the pot in a 1/2-inch grid pattern, making sure the knife goes all the way to the bottom of the pot. Then make more slices at an angle to the surface of the curd, again 1/2-inch apart. Gently stir the curds, using a spoon to break up any that are significantly large than 1/2-inch cubes-but avoid mashing the curds. Stirring gently, turn the heat on once more and carefully bring the temperature back up to 90\u00b0F. Turn off the heat, cover the pot and let the curds rest for 15 minutes.",
      "After the 15-minute rest, the curds will have contracted and firmed up a bit. Place a colander in a bowl and line it with the cheesecloth. Ladle the curds into the cheesecloth and tie the corners together. If your sink is deep enough, you can hang the curds from the faucet, but a large wooden spoon placed on the backs of two chairs makes a good rack, too. Leave the bowl under the suspended bag of curds to catch the dripping whey.",
      "Let the whey drain for about 30 minutes. Shift and tug the bag around to keep the whey draining freely. Meanwhile, you can set up your cheese molds. Place one of the cutting boards in a tray to catch the whey runoff, and put a reed mat on top of the board. If your cheese molds are not perfect cylinders, set them on the reed mat with the narrow end down.",
      "Ladle the drained curds into the two prepared cheese molds. The curds should not fill the molds all the way to the top. Cover the molds with another reed mat and the other cutting board. Let them drain for 3 to 4 hours. As the whey seeps out under the gentle weight of the curds, the cheeses will shrink down and firm up.",
      "When the cheeses hold their shape, you can flip them. Lift the cutting-board-cheese-mold stack out of the tray and carefully flip it over. Set the stack down and take a peek at your cheeses: They should have released from the reed mats and dropped down in the molds. If they haven't, you can peel the mat back by curling it away from the cheese to loosen it up.",
      "Flip the cheese several times more during the next 12 to 18 hours. They should stay out at room temperature on your counter. When the cheeses are just a couple of inches high or so and fairly sturdy, they're ready to salt down and cure.",
      "Now it's time to prepare the curing chamber! Sterilize your curing box or tub in boiling water, along with the third reed mat you cut to fit inside of it. When they're cool, place the mat in the box. Find a relatively warm corner of your refrigerator for the box to live for the next 2 months; 45\u00b0F is ideal. Check with a thermometer: it's surprising how much temperature variation there is between the back and front and top and bottom of a refrigerator. If it's a little too cold, that's fine; the cheese will just take longer to ripen.",
      "Sprinkle 1/2 teaspoon of very fine sea salt evenly on each surface of the cheese-that's 11/2 teaspoons per cheese. Salt on the exterior of the cheese protects it from opportunistic foreign mold during the early weeks of ripening. By the end of the ripening period, the saltiness will be evenly distributed throughout the cheese.",
      "Place the salted cheeses on the reed mat in the box, with room for air to circulate around them. Put the lid on securely and put the whole thing in its special mold-friendly ripening spot in the fridge.\r\n\r\nDuring the next few days, keep an eye on the box to fine-tune the cheeses' environment. You want it to be quite humid, so condensation on the inside of the box is to be expected. If there's no condensation, pour a few tablespoons of cool sterile water onto the reed mat. Keep a thermometer in the box to make sure the temperature is staying where you want it. I find that I need to turn the box regularly because one end always gets cooler than the other.",
      "After a few days to a week, the mold will start to grow. It starts as spots of fluffy snow-white fuzz and eventually grows to cover the entire surface. If the mold takes longer to form-two weeks, say-then you know your box has been too cold. Apart from slowing down the cheese's progress, the cold is not a terrible problem; however, you'll want to remember that the cheese is a late bloomer when you come to the later stages of ripening.\r\n\r\nWhen there's a coating of mold, turn the cheeses over. You will have to carefully peel them off the mat; curl it back reed-by-reed to release the cheese. Keep turning the cheese every few days to prevent the mold from permanently fusing the cheese to the mat.",
      "Though it probably won't be an issue if you sterilized your equipment and salted the cheese thoroughly, keep a sharp eye out for dark mold of any sort. If you see any, cut it out immediately and dab vinegar over the incision site.",
      "When the cheese is thoroughly coated with a thick blanket of white mold (after another week or so), you can wrap it. You could also just leave it as-is, but the wrapping saves you from having to flip it every few days. If you buy specialty cheese paper, you can even get rid of the ripening box entirely at this point, since the cheese paper holds in enough humidity while allowing the cheese to breathe. However, you will do just fine by wrapping the cheeses in parchment and leaving them in the box. In any case, keep the cheeses at the same warm-refrigerator temperature.",
      "Now comes the hardest part: knowing when to cut into the cheese. Once you sample it, the ripening process comes to a halt. Of course, even a slightly underripe cheese is still delicious; the edges will be creamy even if the center is a bit firm and chalky (and this is exactly how some cheeses are supposed to be eaten). At the very least, though, wait 4 weeks after wrapping the cheese, and then start looking for ripeness cues.\r\n\r\nA ripe cheese has a firm rind with a soft interior. It will give in the middle when gently pressed, even if the rind feels stiff. The surface of the cheese will become a bit sway-backed, sagging slightly from the edge.\r\n\r\nYou might even insert a very sharp, narrow, sterile knife into the middle of the cheese to feel if there is a firm resistance-if there is, pull that knife out and wrap that cheese back up. If you're lucky, the mold will grow back over the cut and nobody will know. Try again in another few weeks.\r\n\r\nIf your mold took a long time to form in the early stages of ripening, you will want to allow extra ripening time now. Two months from the wrapping date.\r\n\r\nAnd if you neglect your cheese? If its environment got too warm, and it ripened up while you weren't paying attention? Overripe cheese easily develops an acrid cat-pee ammonia aroma. The center of the cheese may still be okay, however, as the ripening proceeds from the outside in.",
      "Bloomy-rind cheeses are best showed off and served at room temperature. Let them warm up on the counter for 1/2 hour or so before eating. Once cut, keep them wrapped in parchment in a loose plastic bag in the fridge."

      "First, make the pasta dough (unless you'd rather just buy sheets of fresh pasta-that's ok too!). Dump the flour and salt onto a clean countertop or large cutting board and make them into a mound with a big well in the center. Beat the 2 eggs with the 2 tablespoons of water and pour into the well in the dry ingredients. Slowly mix in the flour with a fork, working around the edges of the well so as to keep the liquid confined; when it starts to get sticky, use your hands to mix. Knead the dough, with extra flour or water as necessary, until it's smooth and elastic (it will take a while). When it's good and springy, cover it with plastic wrap or an upside-down bowl, and leave it to rest while you make the filling.",
      "Start with the leeks: chop off the greens and the roots, and halve the white parts lengthwise. Wash them well and carefully to make sure there's no grit trapped between the layers, then chop them up. For the artichoke hearts, if you start with fresh artichokes, here's a handy tutorial for cleaning them up: http://moroccanfood.about.com/od/tipsandtechniques/ss/artichoke_clean.htm Don't toss the stems, if your artichokes have them-you can peel them and use the inner parts just like the rest of the heart! Coarsely chop the hearts once they're all cleaned.",
      "Heat some olive oil in a pan and saute the leeks until they soften. You don't want them crisp, so keep the heat medium-low. Add the artichoke hearts and a bit of water, and cover the pan to let them steam a bit. When the artichokes are soft, take the pan off the heat and put the leeks and artichokes in a bowl to cool a bit.",
      "While the vegetables are cooling, it's time to roll out the pasta! Divide your dough in half and roll it out, either using a pasta machine or a rolling pin (for some good tips on how to get thin pasta without a machine, try here: http://lacucinaitalianamagazine.com/articles/how-to-hand-roll-pasta-dough)",
      "Lay out one sheet of pasta and dollop on the filling with enough space in between spoonfuls to seal the ravioli. Mix the egg white with the 2 teaspoons of water and brush it around the filling; then, cover the whole thing with the second sheet of pasta and carefully seal off your ravioli one by one. Try not to get air bubbles around the filling. Once they're sealed up, cut your ravioli apart. At this point, you could freeze them and keep them to cook another time-but why wait? Instant (or nearly so) leek-and-artichoke gratification awaits! Cook them in boiling, salted water for 3-6 minutes, or until the pasta is as done as you like (the time will depend on how thick you rolled your dough out). Serve with your favorite sauce (I often just heat up a can of crushed no-salt tomatoes and mix in any extra filling to make a sort of pink sauce), hot out of the pot."

      "Note: Start this off the night before you want it. I know some of you people don't bother to read the whole recipe before you start, and then get mad and confused when you hit the \"refrigerate overnight\" part. That's why I'm putting it here. Now stop complaining, dammit.",
      "For the galette, whisk together the flour, salt, and two tablespoons of sugar in a large bowl.",
      "Add the butter in, and cut it in with a pastry cutter until you get a vaguely pebbly texture.",
      "Whisk together the yogurt, vinegar, and ice water in a small bowl and add it into the dough.",
      "Mix together the dough with a wooden spoon or your hands or...pretty much anything, really. If things are looking a little too dry, add a little more ice water.",
      "Once you've got your dough formed, roll it into a ball, flatten it into a disk, and wrap it in plastic wrap. Stick it in the refrigerator overnight.",
      "Preheat your oven to 400.",
      "Dust a cutting board or flat surface with a little flour and roll out the galette dough to about an 1/8th of an inch thick. Keep in mind that this is a galette; they're supposed to look bad. Don't worry about making it the perfect beautiful circle of dough; just get it to where it needs to be.",
      "Prepare the apples by peeling them, slicing them thin with a mandoline, and tossing them in a large bowl with a 1/4 cup of sugar, brown sugar, cornstarch, cinnamon, and a pinch of salt. Work fast so they don't get brown and mushy.",
      "Pile the apples in the middle of the galette dough, leaving a couple of inches around the apples free to fold over. You'll probably have more apples than you need, so take some off if you can't fold the dough.",
      "Fold the dough over the apples, leaving a small, open hole in the middle. And don't snicker at that last sentence...I'm watching you.",
      "Crack the egg in a small bowl and add a tablespoon of water. Whisk them together and use the egg wash to brush the top of the galette with a pastry brush.",
      "Sprinkle the demerara sugar on top of the galette. You want a lot of this stuff so it gets all nice and caramelized, so if 3 tablespoons isn't enough, add more.",
      "Stick it in the oven on a baking sheet for 35-40 minutes, let it cool off for 5, then stick it on a cooling rack until it's cool enough to eat.",
      "Heat up the sugar and water in a medium pot over high heat, and stir until the sugar's been completely dissolved (that means clear, folks).",
      "Take it off heat, and add in the basil and lemon peel. You can be lazy like me and throw the whole bunches of basil in at once; that'll make it easier to take out later.",
      "Cover the pot and let it cool to room temperature, then take out the basil. DON'T strain out the lemon peel; most recipes tell you to do that, and they're wrong. Lemon peel's delicious, and it's even more delicious when it's in a mouthful of sorbet.",
      "Put the sugar-water in whatever you plan on chilling this stuff in, and mix in the lemon juice, rose water, and gin. Refrigerate it overnight.",
      "Once the sorbet stuff is all nice and cool, give it a run through your preferred ice cream mixer and stick it in the freezer while you make the galette. Be sure to mix up the sorbet a few times while it's freezing, that way all the tasty gin won't sink to the bottom."

You may need to add a bit more water, you may not need it all, so I suggest doing this by hand or at least adding the water bit by bit so you can see how the dough behaves.",
      "Once the dough comes together, knead it on a lightly floured surface for 5 to 10 minutes, until the dough is smooth and elastic (it should bounce back when poked). Wrap in plastic wrap and let rest for at least 1 hour (you can also prepare this the night before and leave it overnight in the fridge).",
      "Remove the central veins of the chard, then cook the leaves until tender, about 5 to 7 minutes. Remove from the water, drain, let cool slightly, then chop finely. Squeeze again to remove as much water as possible (too much liquid will create a soggy base).",
      "In a large pan, saute the onion in 2 tablespoons olive oil until soft and translucent. Add the chard and toss to combine with the onion, cooking a further 2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper, add the fresh marjoram leaves, and set aside to cool. When cool, combine 2 beaten eggs and a third of the Parmesan with the chard mixture and set aside until needed.",
      "In a separate bowl, combine the ricotta, 2 eggs, a third of the Parmesan, and nutmeg, and season with salt and pepper. Beat until combined. Set aside in the fridge until needed.",
      "To assemble the pie, brush olive oil lightly over a cake tin with a removable base (about 9-10 inches or 23 to 25-centimeter diameter is ideal, but slightly larger sizes work too). Cut the dough into 4 equal portions. Roll the portions out one at a time, keeping the others well covered with a tea towel or plastic wrap. On a large, lightly floured surface, roll the first ball of dough until very thin -- you should be able to see your fingers through the other side.",
      "Lay the dough gently over the cake tin to cover the sides and base. Let the excess dough hang over the edge. Brush the dough lightly with olive oil. Roll out a second ball of dough as before and lay over the first layer of dough the same way. Brush with olive oil, pushing out any air bubbles with the brush as you do so.",
      "Fill the pie base with the chard mixture, smoothing over the top with the back of a spoon. Next, layer over the ricotta mixture, smoothing over the top with the back of a spoon. Then, with the help of a spoon, make 4 round indents over the surface of the ricotta that are big enough to fit an egg yolk in each. Crack the eggs, separating the whites from the yolks. Place the yolks in the indents in the ricotta and the whites in a small bowl. Whisk the whites together with a fork and pour over about half of the whites to make an even layer that just covers the ricotta. Sprinkle over the rest of the Parmesan.",
      "Roll out the third ball of dough as before. Gently lay it over the top of the pie and brush lightly with olive oil. Roll out the last ball of dough and lay it over the top. Trim the dough overhang, leaving about an inch (2 1/2 centimeters) from the edge of the top of the pie, and roll the trim down until it reaches the top of the pie. Brush the top with olive oil and then bake for about 50 minutes at 350\u00b0 F (180\u00b0 C) or until the top is golden brown and puffed. (A tip: If you have an oven that doesn't bake well from the bottom, place the pie on the lowest shelf for the first half of the cooking time, then move it up for the second half). Remove the pie from the oven, and let the pie stand for 15 to 20 minutes in the cake tin before removing the tin and cutting into it. Serve warm or even cold -- this makes a great portable picnic dish too."

    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "Start w/ the lentils. Place the lentils in a large bowl or pot and run cold water over to clean and reduce some of the starch. You may have to change the water several times to rinse thoroughly. Check the lentils to make sure there are no small stones or other undesirable matter in them. Drain the water from the lentils. Put the lentils in a medium-sized pot and add all of the other ingredients (water and seasonings). Cook on medium-high heat for about 20 minutes--stirring occasionally--until the lentils are tender. Drain any excess water, cover with a top and set aside. *Lentils will triple in quantity once they are cooked. For this recipe you will only need two cups of cooked lentils. Store the remaining lentils in the fridge to use in other dishes (soups, cold salads, etc.).",
      "Clean the leeks. Trim the leek stalks by cutting the bottom close to the root and then cutting off the dark green tips. The white to very light green part of the leek is the best to cook with. You can use the dark green tips later for soup stock (be sure to wash them VERY well) or discard. Once the leeks are trimmed, peel back the layers and holding the stalk upside down, hold under cold, running water. Check between all the layers to make sure they are cleaned thoroughly. Drain the leeks in a strainer or on paper towels. Dry thoroughly--blot dry with paper towels. Cut the leeks--slice into long strips as shown in the pic above or chop into 1/2 inch-thick rounds. *This step, cleaning the leeks, is the most time-consuming step in the recipe so to save time, you may want to prepare your leeks the day before or several days in advance.",
      "Cook the leeks and sauce. Heat the oil and butter in a large skillet under med-high heat. Add the minced garlic, leeks, salt and pepper. Cook the leeks without turning or stirring them for a minute or so on each side. You want them to char a little but watch them so they do not burn. When the leeks are tender and slightly charred, remove them from the pan--placing them on a small plate or paper towel. Leave the skillet on the heat and reduce flame slightly. Add the white wine and stir to deglaze the pan to get all the flavor bits off the bottom of the pan. Continue cooking the wine 2-3 minutes and then add the rest of the ingredients. Stir until all ingredients are thoroughly mixed in. *If you do not have the pepper jelly, you may substitute it with any flavor of jelly and add 1/2 teaspoon ground red pepper or red pepper flakes.Let the sauce simmer on a low-medium heat for 5-10 minutes.",
      "Cook the pork fillets. Note: For this recipe you can use a whole pork tenderloin and slice it into fillets, buy fillets at the butcher counter or bagged in convenient individually-wrapped portions. You may use plain or marinated fillets. The fillet is a very tender cut of meat but buying it in a marinade almost guarantees a more tender piece of meat. Beware, though, some marinades may contain a lot of salt/sodium so if you opt for the fillets in a marinade, you may want to reduce the salt in other areas of the recipe where you can.\r\n\r\nIf using marinated fillets, you can omit the seasonings in this recipe. Otherwise, season both sides of the pork fillets with the salt, pepper and paprika. Heat the oil in a large skillet under high heat. Cut the sprigs of thyme in half and add two pieces to the skillet. Place a fillet on top of each sprig of thyme (cook two fillets at a time so the pan is not crowded). Sear the fillets on high heat--approximately 2-3 minutes on each side. Remove from pan and set aside to rest. Repeat steps for the remaining two fillets. After the fillets have rested (about three minutes) slice them for plating.",
      "Plate the dish by putting 1/2 cup of the cooked lentils on the plate. Add the leeks and fillets and drizzle a little sauce over the pork. Garnish is optional but I used a teaspoon or so of chopped roasted red peppers just to give the plate a little color contrast. Enjoy!"

UPDATES 2013/05/08: oops I forgot but you should add the tomato (cut in half) at this point. It is now crucial to taste-test the seasonings. Different brands of soy sauce differs in saltiness and sweetness, so much that it is impossible to standardize by saying \"however-many-cups of soy sauce\". I would STRONGLY recommend using a LESS sweet version of soy sauce (you can see the one I'm using from the picture). Taste the soup now. It should be fairly salty (too salty to drink as a soup) with a SLIGHTEST (almost untraceable) hint of sweetness just to balance it off. If the saltiness seems too \"sharp\" and unrefined, add more rock sugar. If it's a bit too bland (in this case \"drinkable\" as a soup), add more soy sauce. I ended up adding 1/8 cup more of soy sauce to my pot (but with a less salty brand of soy sauce, it could be more).",

Prepare another large pot and rest a sieve on top of the pot. Strain everything through the sieve into another pot. Carefully pick out the beef cubes without breaking them, then use a wooden spoon to press VERY HARD on the scraps to extract every drop of juice left in them. You'd be surprise how much it is. Discard the scraps. Return the beef cubes back into the soup and add 1 tsp of rice vinegar, then dissolve the unsweetened peanut butter into the pot (or through a strainer if the peanut butter is chunky). UPDATES: 2013/06/24: I find that an extra 1 tbsp of uncooked tomato paste, dissolved in the end, adds a good layer of depth.",
      "There. We are done.\r\n\r\nTo serve it, cook your favorite noodles (I like the fat ones) and dilute the soup with 1 : 1/2 as the ratio of braised beef soup: unsalted stock. So with 1 cup of braised beef soup, add 1/2 cup of unsalted stock. This would still yield a slightly salty soup but that's how I like it. Or you could simply use the braised beef soup only as a sauce in the \"dry noodle\" version.\r\n\r\nMUST ADD spring onions and pickled cabbage. That's not even negotiable."

This will also give a lovely shine to the flower cake. After 15 minutes, carefully turn the cake over with the help of your 2 hands, out of the flower tin. Now, you will see the lovely flower pattern. Place on a wire rack to cool down completely. When cold, savour with a good cup of green tea with ginger or a great cup of black coffee.\r\n \r\n 6. When completely cold, store in an aluminium foil lined round cake tin. You will see, this cake will not last long,...!!!!!"

      "When it's time to make the curry, make criss-cross slits on the head of the tomatoes and cook them for five minutes in boiling water. The water should just cover the heads of the tomatoes.",
      "After they're cooked, reserve about 1/4 cup of the water the tomatoes were boiled in. Drain the rest of the water away and blitz the tomatoes, skin and all, into a puree.",

      "Add in the onion-garlic paste, tomato puree, the reserved water from boiling the tomatoes, sugar and the milk/cream. Stir everything well together.",

      "The curry is meant to be dry without too much liquid or gravy to it. Mind you, the chicken pieces will give off a fair amount of liquid themselves. At the end of your taste check, if there's too much liquid in the pot, turn the heat to high and cook uncovered for a few minutes till the liquid reduces to the consistency you want.",
      "Take the pot off heat and stir in the chopped chilies.",
      "Serve with pilaf or steamed white rice with freshly chopped coriander leaves scattered on top.",
      "Note:\r\nNutmeg can be overpowering, but don't be scared. Take a full-sized nutmeg and crush it under a pestle till you get a pea-sized piece.\r\nThe chicken pieces can be boneless if you want, but keep in mind that chicken cooked on the bones taste much richer. If you're going with boneless pieces try using chicken thighs rather than breasts.\r\nIf your prefer the heat from the chilies to be milder then scrape off the seeds before chopping them. I, however, like it hot, so I've kept the seeds intact. Make sure to add the chopped chilies after the curry's been taken off the heat.\r\nMilk is the option I prefer. It adds a subtle mellowness to the pungency of the spices while keeping the curry light. Cream, however, can be used if you're aiming to impress guests with something richer.\r\nThe curry is much better the next day, when the ingredients have had a chance to meld together."

This method of adding a ladleful of stock at a time allows rice starch to be released thus giving risotto a very creamy texture.

Remove toasted pita from oven or toaster, and break into uneven bite-sized pieces. Set aside.",

Halve tomatoes, then slice each into 2-bite wedges, taking care to reserve the collected juice and transfer it into the dressing bowl. Halve cherry tomatoes. Transfer all tomatoes to large, shallow bowl or rimmed serving platter. Add cucumbers, red onions (if using), scallions, mint, and parsley to the salad bowl, and carefully incorporate without smushing tomatoes. (That's a technical term.) Add pita chips on top.",

      "Notes: If you don't have a problem with using regular granulated or brown sugar, you can substitute that here, however, most standard sugars are not truly vegan. I used Wholesome Cane and Brown Sugar for these cookies.\r\nBe sure that your coconut oil is not liquidy or melted. This recipe was tested using solid coconut oil, although there were some small differences between brands.\r\nYou can substitute GF flour here, although the cookies may spread slightly differently. Test the baking out on one or two to verify that they will bake as you'd like. If they spread too much, refrigerate the dough, and if they stay more puffed than you'd like, slightly press down on the dough balls."

      "Add flour, sugar, salt, honey, and potato chips into the food processor. Pulse a few times to mix everything well. Then, add chopped cold butter into the food processor and pulse the food processor several times until the dough comes together.",
      "When the dough comes together, divide it in half. Place each half on a long piece of plastic wrap. Fold plastic over to cover the dough and protect your hands from getting sticky. Using your hands, shape the dough into a log shape by rolling it on a flat surface back and forth. Gently massage the dough so that the log doesn't have any holes or gap in the middle. The dough should form 2 logs that are around 2'' in diameter. Chill the dough in the fridge until it's firm for an hour or more.",
      "When the log is chilled and firm enough to handle, slice each log into 1/2''-thick rounds. Each log should make about 12 cookies. Put sliced rounds on a prepared parchment-lined baking sheet about 1'' apart. Bake them until edges are just beginning to brown for 15-17 minutes. Let them cool.",
      "Make the glaze by whisking melted butter, honey, powdered sugar, salt, and soy sauce.",
      "Dip each cookie into the glaze, not too deep but just on the surface, and set them on a parchment-lined baking sheet or a baking rack. Sprinkle more crushed potato chips on top of glazed cookies to add extra crunch and flavors.",
      "If you want to have extra-flaky textures, you can make this cookie a square shape. Place the dough on a big piece of plastic wrap. Even out the dough, and form the rectangular shape. To shape it more precisely, using a small square casserole dish will help. Wrap the rectangular-shaped dough and chill the dough in the fridge. \r\n\r\nBake the rectangular-shaped dough for 30-40 minutes until the edges are golden brown. The baked dough will be soft and fragile. While the dough is still hot, cut a rectangular-shaped dough into individual portion-sized cookies. It should be enough to have 20 pieces by cutting horizontally four times and vertically five times. Let them cool. Dip squared cookies into the glaze and finish them by sprinkling crushed potato chips on top."

When the oil is hot, add the fillets skin side down and cook until the skin is very crisp and the flesh is lightened only about one-third of the way up the side, about 2 to 3 minutes. Then turn the fillets and remove the pan from the stove; it will finish cooking off the heat while you serve the leeks and cabbage. Then serve the salmon immediately."

Show older posts\r\nTuesday, November 30, 2010Aycaramba, Spicey Cranberry Habanero Hot Sauce and Salsa if You Dare! \r\nAlright, long absence from the City of Charm, but the test kitchen's never stopped cooking. Today's posting is long due from late summer. One of the nearby neighbor donated some homegrown habanero peppers and some other mixture of milder peppers (got no idea of the name, but check out the picture). Habanero, as you know, is one of the hottest tasting chilli pepper available, ranking on the Scoville scale of 350,000-580,000 heat units. To compare, Jalapenos are only about 2,500-8,000 Scoville heat units. And if you are not familiar with the Scoville heat measurement unit, just google it. Anywho, the recipe is to make a blended habanero spice paste that can be frozen and used for cooking, add to your ketchup for spicyness, or eat it straight up with your favorite chips and take it like a man!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAycaramba Cranberry Habanero Hot Sauce / Salsa\r\n10 - 15 habanero / scotch bonnet peppers or mixture of mild and spicy peppers\r\n1 large purple onion, roughly diced\r\n1/2 head of garlic (approx 10 cloves)\r\n1-3 carrots depending on how big the carrots are\r\n4 roma tomatoes\r\n1/3 cups of dried cranberry\r\n1/3 - 1/2 cups of brown sugar\r\nSufficient salt, approximately 1 tbsp\r\n1-2 tbsp cumin\r\n1-2 tbsp corriander\r\n3-4 tbsp honey\r\na dash of worchestire sauce\r\n1 spritz of orange juice\r\n\r\n\r\nRoughly dice the vegetables and peppers and blend everything, including spices in a blender. May require 2 batches of blending depending the size of food processor or blender, and voila, take a whiff and it will knock any pneumonia or influenza virus out cold! Aliquot in smaller portions and freeze if desire.",

I actually split my patty into 2 (meaning the recipe would make 8, not 4), fried them in a non-stick pan with a few tablespoons of canola oil until nicely browned on each side and served them on toasty sandwich thins! Highly recommended for this recipe!"
