Slow cooking is the key to keeping the tofu from sticking to the Teflon and insures that the water has time to evaporate out before the outside is browned. Do NOT use oil. You want to leech all of the moisture out of your tofu, so do not use oil--leave the pan dry.",

You will see the water seeping out and sizzling in the pan. Once the bottom sides are very firm and golden in color, flip the tofu pieces and fry the other side, again frequently pressing each piece with a spatula. When they are golden and firm on both sides, they are done.The dry-frying method has left your tofu dry and firm, ready to suck up the flavors of a marinade like a sponge. Place the tofu pieces in the marinade and stir well, making sure the tofu is submerged. Marinate for at least a half an hour and then use this delicious firm and flavorful tofu in a stir-fry."

      "HOW TO MAKE BAKLAVA SAUCE: First, you cook Baklava sauce from 1l of water, 700g of sugar and half lemon, cooked sauce leave it in the fridge to cool. You must always make first the sauce and cool so you can pour cold sauce over hot Baklava that is the rule if you want to make the best Baklava.",
      "HOW TO MAKE BAKLAVA: 1.First, you put in one bowl walnuts, breadcrumbs, sugar(5tbl spoon) and mix them. 2.Then you use another bowl to melt butter and oil which you use for greasing phyllo dough for Baklava. 3.Take a pan that is for baklava and grease it with a mixture of butter and oil, put the first layer of phyllo and grease then two more layers but each one you grease with a mixture of oil and butter, then add the first layer of walnuts. 4.Cover the first layer of walnuts with two layers of phyllo that are also greased. 5.Continue all the way to the top of the pan by adding two greased layers of phyllo and between each double layer of phyllo you add walnuts. 6.For last layers, you leave three phyllo, first two you grease the last one you don't leave the last layer dry, then cut shapes that you wish triangles or cubes, the choice is yours. 7.Put Baklava in the already preheated oven at 160 degrees and bake for two hours, after two hours increase the temperature at 180 degrees and bake for 20 more minutes until you get golden yellow color. 8.When Baklava is baked you take cold premake sauce and start to pour over hot Baklava, pour all the way to the top until you cover all surface with sauce so that Baklava is drowned in sauce. 9.Press the Baklava with the same size pan and put something inside to make pressure on Baklava, for example, pour 1l water in upper pan. 10.Leave overnight in the fridge and serve tomorrow."

Finely chop, either by hand or by pulsing in a food processor.",
      "In a large skillet, saute the minced garlic in 3 tablespoons of the oil over moderate heat until pale gold, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the chard and spinach. Cook, stirring, over medium heat, until the liquid is evaporated and the garlic is thoroughly distributed, 5 to 7 minutes. The greens should be very tender. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Transfer to a large bowl and set aside.",

In another saucepan, bring the broth to a simmer. Add the broth to the rice a few spoonfuls at a time, as if making risotto. Keep the heat medium-low, and stir, waiting until the broth is nearly absorbed before adding another spoonful. Cook the rice until just tender, 15 to 20 minutes in all. If you finish adding the broth and the rice is not yet tender, add a tablespoon or two of hot water, as needed. Season the rice with salt and pepper (taking in to account the saltiness of the broth you are using), add it to the chard and spinach, and set aside to cool.",
      "Break the head into single cloves and put them, unpeeled, into a small baking dish in which they fit snugly (I use a 5-inch-square porcelain ramekin). Drizzle with 2 teaspoons of the oil and 1 teaspoon of the thyme. Cover tightly (use foil if you don't have a lid), and roast for 30 to 45 minutes, until a soft puree is formed when you squeeze a clove. Avoid overcooking, which turns the garlic bitter. Squeeze the puree out by hand or run the unpeeled cloves through a food mill to trap the peels. Put the roasted garlic puree in a small bowl and add 1 tablespoon of the rosemary and the lemon juice. Stir well and set aside. Turn off the oven-you will be pan-braising the meat.",

Fill the pocket with the stuffing, pushing the mixture as far in as possible, but don't overfill-it will expand somewhat while cooking. Sew the pocket closed. (A large embroidery needle and strong cotton thread or unwaxed dental floss work very well here. Or use a trussing needle and kitchen twine. I find skewering not as successful here-the stuffing is more likely to ooze out into the pan gravy.)",
      "In a 6-quart Dutch oven or heavy casserole just large enough to accommodate the veal, heat the remaining 2 tablespoons oil until hot, but not smoking. Add the veal and brown it slowly on all sides, turning carefully with wooden spoons so you don't piece the meat. When it is thoroughly browned, arrange the meat so that the fat side is up. Spread the roasted garlic mixtue all over the top. Add the wine and bring to a slow bubble. Place the lid slightly askew, and braise at a slow simmer over very low heat for 2 1/2 to 3 hours, or longer, if necessary, until the meat is very tender. Use a flame tamer (",
      ") or stack two stove burner grates , if you must to keep the flame very low. Every 20 minutes or so, baste with the pan juices. If possible, turn the meat a few times; don't worry about losing the roasted garlic coating on top-it will add delicious flavor to the cooking juices.",
      "Transfer the veal to a platter, and let it stand for 10 minutes, tented with foil to keep warm. Boil up the cooking juices for a few minutes to concentrate the flavors, taste for seasoning, then transfer to a sauce boat.",
      "Slice the veal about 1/2-inch thick, making sure that the slices enclose some of the filling. Nap with some of the juices. Pass remaining sauce separately.",

Stir in the reserved sauteed onion (along with any oil remaining in the pan), and 1 additional tablespoon olive oil, and season to taste with salt and pepper. Add the potato mixture to the chard and spinach, set aside to cool, and continue with the recipe."

      "Usually in a pack of phyllo dough there are two separate dough packets, you'll only need one. Let sit out on the counter to defrost 30 min ahead of time, or heat in micro-wave for approx. 20 sec. doesn't take long to thaw. Pre-heat oven to 350. While thawing you can wash and cut up strawberries into slices and place in a bowl. To the strawberry bowl you add the 1/4 cup of honey and toss together. Those can sit up to 2hours before in the fridge. Take the muffin pan and grease with butter. With the pastry sheets, you first cut up into square pieces that fit the muffin tins but over lap, they should be 1/4 inch thick. sprinkle some cinnamon and sugar over top all the sheets of dough in the pan. Then place in oven for 5 min. After the 5 min. you have to watch them closely to be sure they're a light golden brown. Pastry sheets will only need to cool in the pan for another 5 min at most. They slide out easily and can be placed on plates/display. Once the sheets are done, you can fill and serve. Fill bottom of baked dough with 1 Tlbs. of Nutella in each, then a Tlbs. of Strawberries to overlap a little, and the the whipped cream. To top them all off I drizzle with a little chocolate syrup and then they're perfect and ready to eat. They're so light and fluffy it's a great semi-healthy dessert to finish the night or start off a party."

Turn up heat and add the veal. Let veal cook as you stir. Drain the artichokes from the lemon water they'd been soaking in and add to pot. Stir them in and let them cook for about a minute. Add all the other vegetables and stir them in. Salt. Pour the meat broth into the pot and let soup simmer for about 7-10 minutes or until vegetables are just cooked. In the meantime prepare the croutons. Cut the bread as instructed in the ingredients and place them in an oven tray. Dress them with the thyme, pepper, olive oil, salt and garlic and toss.
