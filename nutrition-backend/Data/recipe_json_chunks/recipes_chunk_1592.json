      "For the strawberry puree:",
      "Add strawberries to a blender, and blend until smooth. Add to a medium pot along with sugar and lemon zest, and bring to a boil, stirring frequently.",
      "When mixture comes to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer for 20 minutes, stirring frequently, until mixture is reduced by about half. Remove from heat, and allow to cool for 10 minutes. Place in a bowl, cover, and refrigerate while you prepare the remaining ingredients.",
      "For the rolls:",
      "In a small bowl, add ground flax meal and water. Mix well. In a medium bowl, add almond milk and apple cider vinegar, and mix well. Allow both to sit while you prepare the remaining ingredients.",
      "In the bowl of a stand mixer using a paddle attachment, add sugar, salt, and softened vegan butter. Cream for 3-5 minutes until mixture gets light and fluffy. Add egg and lemon zest, mixing well, scraping down the sides of the bowl with the spatula, and mixing again until ingredients are evenly distributed.",
      "Add flour and yeast, mixing with the paddle just until mixture forms a scraggy ball. Switch to the hook attachment, and knead for 10 minutes. If mixture is too wet and sticks to the side of the bowl, add more flour, 1 tablespoon at a time, beating well after each addition. You want the dough to slightly stick to the bottom of the stand mixture, and not stick to the sides at all. Lightly oil a large bowl, add dough, turning over to coat, and cover with plastic wrap. Allow to rise for 1 1/2 - 2 hours, or until dough has doubled in size.",
      "Turn dough out onto a lightly floured, clean surface, and roll into a rectangle 1/2 inch high with the long side toward you. The long side should measure about 18 inches, and be 9 inches deep.",
      "Spread cooled strawberry puree all over the rectangle lightly, then use a pastry scraper to help you roll up. Take the edge closest to you, begin to roll the dough on top of itself to form a log. You may have some strawberry puree spill out, that's ok. Leave it there for now.",
      "Cut log into 16 equal pieces, and place on a parchment- or silpat-lined baking sheet, about 1 inch apart. Scoop up the spilled strawberry puree with the pastry scraper, and top the rolls with it. Cover with plastic wrap, and let rise for 75-90 minutes, until pieces have grown into one another and doubled in size.",
      "Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F 15 minutes before the proofing step is complete above. Bake for 20-30 minutes, or until golden brown. Remove from oven and allow to cool.",
      "For the glaze:",
      "As the sweet strawberry rolls cool, make the glaze by adding sifted powdered sugar to a stand mixer with the whisk attachment. Add lemon zest, and with the mixer on medium, gradually add in the almond milk until you have a thick glaze.",
      "After strawberry rolls have cooled for at least 10 minutes, pour the glaze over the buns. Top with fresh diced strawberries and lemon zest. Serve to your favorite people!",
      "Note: Instead of making your own strawberry puree, you can use 1 to 1 1/2 cups of prepared strawberry jam."

      "Sprinkle butter cubes over the flour and begin working them in with a pastry blender or fork using it to scoop and redistribute the mixture as needed so all parts are worked evenly until all of the butter pieces are the size of tiny peas.",
      "Start by drizzling 1/4 cup of the ice-cold water (but not the cubes) over the butter and flour mixture. Using a rubber spatula, gather the dough together. You'll probably need an additional 1/4 cup of cold water to bring it together, but add it a tablespoon at a time. Once you're pulling large clumps with the spatula, start using your hands to bring the dough together. Gather the clumps together into one mound, kneading them gently together. Form into a disk and wrap in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour.",
      "For the filling:",
      "While dough is chilling, prepare the filling. Add all of the filling ingredients to a medium bowl and gently stir until everything is combined and the fruit is evenly coated with the spices. Taste and adjust the flavors as needed. Set aside and let macerate until the dough is chilled.",
      "Preheat oven to 400\u00b0F with a rack in the center. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or silicone baking mat and set aside.",
      "Once the dough is thoroughly chilled, remove it from the refrigerator. On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough into about a 14-inch diameter circle about 1/8-inch thick. Gently fold the dough into quarters and brush off any excess flour. Transfer the dough to the center of the prepared baking sheet and unfold. It's okay if it hangs off the edges of the baking sheet.",
      "Arrange the apricot mixture in the center of the dough, leaving 2-3 inches of dough bare along the edges. If any juices have accumulated in the bowl, pour them over the center of the fruit.",
      "Grab a piece of loose dough and fold it over the filling towards the center of the galette. Continue working around the galette letting the dough fold over where it feels natural and creating a few pleats where needed. Continue until you have used all of the excess dough and created a rim of crust enclosing the fruit in the center.",
      "Brush the edges and sides of the dough with egg wash and sprinkle generously with the turbinado sugar and sliced almonds. Place baking sheet in the refrigerator and chill the galette for at least 30 minutes or up to an hour.",
      "Bake galette for 35-45 minutes or until crust is golden brown and the fruit is bubbly. Let cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes and then gently use the parchment paper to lift the galette and transfer it to a cooling rack. Slice it into thick wedges for serving. I highly recommend serving with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream."

Incorporate this mixture quickly in the softened cream cheese, then add the whipped cream gently with a spatula. Pour the cream over the dough, smooth the surface and keep it in the fridge for an hour. (to prevent your pie crust from getting soggy you can brush it with melted white chocolate, but this is not necessary)",
      "Cut the pineapple into very small cubes and cut the mango into balls using a melon baller, if you don't have a melon baller you can cut it into cubes. Shortly before serving (max 1 hour) place the pineapple cubes to make a large outer circle, then finish with the mango. Put a circle of pomegranate seeds between the pineapple and mango, place some mint leaves in the center of the tart."

Bring the water to the boil then lower the heat and simmer for five minutes. Drain the ingredients and wash the pot. Rinse the chicken and ham under cold, running water and put them back into the pot. Scrub the pork trotters, washing away all the scum and sediment from the bones and meat, then put the pieces back into the pot. Add four litres of water then put the pot over a high flame. Bring to the boil then add the ginger and spring onions. Cover the pan partially with the lid then lower the flame so the water is at a very low simmer. Cook for six to eight hours, skimming away any scum that floats to the surface. After six hours, the broth should be clear and taste very chicken-y. Strain the ingredients through a colander set over a large bowl. Discard the ginger and spring onions; the chicken, trotters and ham can be used in other dishes.",

Strain the mushroom soaking liquid through a fine sieve into a measuring cup. Add superior stock so you have 1.5 litres of liquid.",

Turn the heat to very low, cover the pot with the lid and cook at a low simmer until the abalone is tender (about six to eight hours, depending on size).

Simmer for about 45 minutes, or until tender. Rinse the conpoy with water then put them in a bowl and add just enough warm water to cover them. Leave for about 15 minutes, or until they're soft but not falling apart. Add the conpoy and the soaking liquid to the clay pot and bring to a simmer. Cook for about 15 minutes, or until the scallops are tender. Taste the braising sauce - it should be deeply flavoured and just a little salty. If it's too salty, stir in more superior stock to dilute it. If the sauce is watery, put a slightly heaped teaspoon of arrowroot powder into a bowl, mix in some sauce, then pour this mixture into the pot, stirring constantly. Don't add too much; the sauce should be just lightly thickened.",

When done, plate it up and drizzle on your Okonomi sauce and mayo. Top with the furikake and/or bonito flakes and enjoy.",

      "For Rub: Stir together all rub ingredients (1 cup dark brown sugar, 1/2 cup granulated garlic, 1/2 cup kosher salt, 1/2 cup paprika, 2 Tbs granulated onion, 1 Tbs dry mustard, 1 Tbs Creole seasoning, 1 Tbs chili powder, 1 Tbs ground red pepper, 1 Tbs ground cumin, 1 Tbs pepper) in a bowl. Store in an airtight container. Set aside.",
      "For Sauce: Stir together all ingredients for the sauce (1 clove minced garlic, 3/4 cup cider vinegar, 1/2 cup ketchup, 1/4 cup Worcestershire, 1/4 cup chili sauce, 2 Tbs onion, 1 Tbs brown sugar, 1 Tbs lemon juice, 1/2 tsp dy mustard, dash of ground red pepper) in a medium saucepan over medium heat; bring to a boil. Reduce heat; simmer, stirring occasionally, 40 minutes.",
      "Divide sauce into separate containers for basting and servings at the table. (Basting brushes used on raw food should not be dipped into table sauce.) Use as a basting sauce during the last 10 minutes of cooking for steak, pork, burgers, or chicken. Discard any remaining basting sauce, and refrigerate any leftover table sauce.",
      "Prepare Pork: If needed, trim the fat back to about 1/8 inch thick on shoulder. Sprinkle meat generously with rub, massaging it into the meat. Wrap tightly with plastic wrap, and chill overnight in the refrigerator.",
      "Prepare Smoker: Smoking a large piece of meat takes a long time, so you'll need to get an early start. Prepare your smoker or grill until the temperature reaches 250 degrees F. Take the meat out of the refrigerator, and let it sit for about 30 to 45 minutes. Having the pork at room temperature is very important, because if you put it on the smoker cold, the outer portion will burn.",
      "Smoke is one of the main ingredients of good barbecue. Soak hickory wood chips (or any other hardwood chips used for barbecuing) in water overnight. This prevents them from burning. The chips smolder, producing smoke that flavors the meat during the cooking process. The smoke also lends a pink color to the outer inch or so of the flesh, creating what is called a \"smoke ring.\" A handful of wood chips should be added to the fire every 30 minutes or so. The more you add, the stronger flavor of smoke you get.",
      "Cook Pork: Place meat on the smoker fat side down. After two hours, turn the meat over so it is fat side up. Total cook time will be 1 1/2 hours per pound. Maintain the temperature in the smoker between 225 degrees F and 250 degrees F. Use a pit thermometer for an accurate reading If the smoker temperature is hotter than 250 degrees F, the meat will cook too quickly; any lower than 225 degrees F, and the meat will not get done. Every time wood chips or charcoal is added, spritz the meat with apple juice from a spray bottle. This will add moisture and a fruity background flavor during cooking.",
      "Remove the meat from the smoker with two hours remaining, and place on heavy-duty aluminum foil. Spritz generously with apple juice, and tightly seal foil around pork. Place meat back on the smoker, and cook for two hours more. Using an instant-read meat thermometer, check the internal temperature of the thickest part of the meat, being careful not to touch bone with the tip of the thermometer. When the internal temperature reaches 195 degrees F, the pork is ready. Cooking the meat beyond the USDA guideline of 160 degrees F renders out the fat and tenderizes the meat.",
      "Remove the meat from the smoker, and let it cool for 15 to 30 minutes. Remove foil after it has cooled enough to handle. Remove the bones, which will easily pull away. Begin pulling, or shredding, the meat with two large forks, and place in a large baking dish or pan. Remove and discard any remaining fat.",
      "To Serve: Add the sauce to pulled pork, and toss. This is a popular way to serve pulled pork in most regions. If you prefer, serve with additional sauce.",

Cook about 3 minutes, add the fresh chopped thyme and taste for seasoning. Sauce may be made one day ahead and warmed before serving with Beef Wellington. Keep in refrigerator until ready to re-warm on medium-low heat.",
      "When Beef Wellington is cooked, remove from oven by transferring it and the parchment paper back onto the cookie sheet. Let the Beef Wellington rest 10 minutes. Slice into 1-inch servings and serve immediately with the Cognac Sauce."

Because of the fragile nature of these waffles (they are basically brownies in waffle form) they can be tricky to remove from the iron in one piece.

      "Preheat the oven to 200 degrees. Grease a 13 inch round pizza pan or standard cookie sheet and dust with flour and corn meal. \n\nCombine the yeast, apple cider vinegar, oil and water in a bowl and set aside to allow the yeast to hydrate. In a large mixing bowl combine the tapioca flour, brown rice flour, white rice flour, sweet potato flour, sugar, baking powder, salt and xanthan gum. \n\nAdd the wet ingredients to the dry and mix on low (use the paddle attachment for Kitchenaid mixers then once combined, switch to the dough hook to knead). Once the dry ingredients have combined with the wet, scrape down the sides and mix on low for three minutes.\n\nAfter three minutes lightly oil hands and start to shape the dough into a flat disc. Lay the dough onto the prepared pizza pan and flatten from the middle out using the palm of your hand. You can also use a rolling pin. Leave the edges thick for the crust. Loosely cover the dough with wax paper and place in the oven to rise for 25 minutes. Turn off the oven while it is rising. \n\nAfter 25 minutes remove the dough from the oven and place it on the stove top or draft free counter top still covered. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Once the oven comes to temperature remove the wax paper from the dough, spritz the edges with water (optional-prevents cracking), and place the dough on the bottom rack. Bake for 8-10 minutes. Then remove from the oven and let cool for about ten minutes. Once cooled coat the edges with oil (I like to use olive oil for this). Now it's ready for toppings. Once toppings are added place back into the oven on the middle rack and bake for about 10-12 minutes. For a crisp crust bake directly on oven rack.",

Evenly spread a thin layer of tomato sauce or dairy free pesto onto the pizza crust. Then add the spinach mix, sausage and Daiya \"cheese\".
