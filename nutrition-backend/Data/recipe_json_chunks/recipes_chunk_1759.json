    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "Preheat the oven to 400 and set a rack in the center.",
      "Put plastic wrap on fresh polenta to keep it hot and to prevent a skin from forming on top.",
      "Be sure to assemble the pasticciata within 1/2 hour, while the polenta is still warm and soft with no lumps.",
      "If necessary, heat the filling sauce to quite warm.",
      "If it is too dense for spreading, thin it with some water.",
      "If youre extending the filling sauce with simple tomato or marinara sauce, warm them up together.",
      "Butter the bottom and sides of the baking dish or skillet thoroughly.",
      "Use more butter on the bottom in particular, if you want to unmold the pasticciata.",
      "Put 1/4 cup besciamella in the dish or skillet and spread it around the bottom; it doesnt have to cover every bit.",
      "Pour in half the polenta (approximately 5 cups) and spread it evenly in the bottom of the pan.",
      "Scatter 1/3 cup or more shredded Muenster or other soft cheese all over the top, then sprinkle on 2 to 4 tablespoons of grated Parmigiano-Reggiano or Grana Padano.",
      "Pour or ladle 2 cups of the warm sauce over the polenta and cheese, and spread it all overuse 3 cups sauce if you want a thicker layer.",
      "Pour on a bit more than half of the remaining polenta (about 3 cups) and spread it.",
      "Spread another 1/4 cup of besciamella on top, top with shredded soft cheese and grated hard cheese in the amounts you like.",
      "Pour in the remaining sauce and spread it evenly, reserving a cup, if you have enough and plan to unmold the pasticciata.",
      "For the top layer, spread all the rest of the polenta and another 1/4 cup besciamella on top of that.",
      "Sprinkle on more shredded soft cheese and grated Parmigiano-Reggiano or Grana Padano.",
      "If youre making a thin pasticciata in a big pan, or want it to have a beautiful deep gold gratinato, use enough besciamella and cheese to really cover the top.",
      "Do not compress the cheeses, though.",
      "See do-ahead note below.",
      "Set the pan on a cookie sheet and bake for 45 minutes to an hour or more, until the top is deeply colored and crusted, even browned a bit on the edges.",
      "Let the pasticciata cool for a few minutes before serving.",
      "If you are serving portions from the baking pan, cut in squares like lasagna, or wedges if youve used a round skillet or pan, and lift them out with a spatula.",
      "To unmold the pasticiatta, let it cool for at least 10 minutes.",
      "Run a knife around the sides of the pan, cutting through crust sticking to the rim or sides.",
      "Lay a cutting board, big enough to cover it, on top of the baking pan or skillet, hold the two together (with the protection of cloths and the help of other hands if necessary), and flip them over.",
      "Rap on the upturned pan bottomor bang on it all overto loosen the bottom.",
      "Lift the board, and give the pan a good shake.",
      "The pasticciata will drop out soon, with sufficient encouragement.",
      "Serve it on the board, or reflip it onto a serving platter and serve with a cup or more of warm sauce heaped on the top or served on the side.",
      "If you want to prepare the pasticciata and bake later the same or next day, spread the last layer of polenta and coat it well with besciamella but dont sprinkle on the final layer of cheeses.",
      "Cover it lightly and leave it at room temperature, or wrap well and refrigerate overnight.",
      "Before baking, sprinkle on the cheeses and make a tent of foil (see page 203) over the baking dish, without touching the cheese.",
      "Poke a few small holes in the foil to vent steam.",
      "Set the pan on a sheet and bake for 1/2 hour at 400, remove the foil, and continue to bake until deeply colored and crusted.",
      "*You can serve this with or without freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano; it will be richer with, but just as good without.",
      "Good alternatives are dry-packed mozzarella, Italian Fontina, cheddar, or other cheeses of your liking.",
      "All of the sauces that I recommend for layering in a pasticciata are delicious just ladled on top of hot polenta.",
      "Youll need 1/3 to 1/2 cup of hot sauce for each serving of Basic Polenta (finished with freshly grated cheese) or any of the Simple Variations that follow (page 216).",
      "Put the polenta in warm serving bowls, sprinkle over more Parmigiano-Reggiano or Grana Padanoit melts best under the saucethen spoon the sauce on top.",
      "Hearty sauces like mushroom ragu or savoy cabbage and bacon are particularly delicious with polenta taragna, a coarse grind of whole-grain cornmeal and buckwheat.",
      "Prepare taragna exactly as you do yellow polenta, but give it an extra 10 to 15 minutes of cooking and more water as needed."
