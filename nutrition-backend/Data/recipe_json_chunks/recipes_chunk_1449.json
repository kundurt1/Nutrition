    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "Preheat oven to 325\u00b0 F. Coat six 5-ounce ramekins with the butter. Place the bread in a large bowl. In a small saucepan, whisk together the cream, milk, and vanilla and warm over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, just until the mixture comes to a boil. Remove from heat and add the chocolate chips, whisking until smooth. In a small bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and the sugar. Slowly whisk in a small amount of the hot chocolate cream, then whisk the egg mixture into the cream until thoroughly combined. Pour the mixture over the bread, stir, and press firmly with a spatula, making sure all the bread is soaked. Cover with plastic wrap and let sit for 20 minutes at room temperature. (It can soak in the refrigerator for up to a day.) Bring a large kettle of water to a boil. Remove the plastic wrap and divide the chocolate bread into the prepared ramekins. Press down gently and ladle any remaining liquid evenly among the ramekins, then place them in a large roasting pan. Transfer the pan to the oven and fill with boiling water until it reaches halfway up the sides of the ramekins. Bake until the pudding is set, about 25 minutes. Remove from oven and let cool at least 5 minutes in the water. Dust each ramekin with the cocoa. Serve warm or at room temperature.",
      "This recipe can also be made using an 8-by-8-inch baking dish. Increase the cooking time to 40 minutes or bake until the pudding is set."

      "Wine note: Brined Pork Loin with Brown Sugar-Bourbon Glaze begs for a wine that's not actually sweet, but seems to be because it's so fruity. Juicy red Zinfandel is that kind of wine. Go for Dutton Goldfield's intense 2007 Zin from the Morelli Lane Vineyard in California's chilly Russian River Valley ($40). Planted by Italian settlers more than 100 years ago, these vines give up bright berry and cherry flavors, plus a spiciness that makes the most of the black peppercorns in the glaze (and, in fact, the rest of this tangy, spicy menu). --Sara Schneider"

Increase heat to medium and bring mixture to a simmer. Cook, stirring occasionally, until mixture is golden brown and measures 240\u00b0 to 245\u00b0 on a candy thermometer (see \"Using a Candy Thermometer\", below), 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from heat and carefully stir in vanilla (mixture will bubble up). Immediately pour caramel into prepared pan. Chill until firm enough to cut, about 2 1/2 hours.",
      "Remove from pan (see Notes) and use a large, sharp knife to cut caramel into 1-in. squares. Wrap each piece (see Notes) and store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks. Bring to cool room temperature before eating.",
      "Caramelizing sugar: Watch closely. Sugar cooks quickly once it begins to brown, so have your ingredients measured and your tools assembled before you start. Before bringing your sugar mixture to a boil, make sure you completely dissolve the sugar and melt the butter: Stir the mixture with a flexible heatproof spatula over medium-low heat, running the spatula around the inside of the saucepan a few times to thoroughly mix everything together.",

You'll find them at supermarkets and some hardware stores; make sure to choose one that measures temperatures up to 400\u00b0.",
      "Test it first: If you have an old thermometer in the back of your gadget drawer, test its accuracy by immersing it in boiling water; it should read 212\u00b0. (If it doesn't, get a new thermometer.) Our favorite in the test kitchen is the Taylor Classic Candy and Deep-Fry Analog Thermometer ($13; available at housewares and home improvement stores), an inexpensive model that's easy to read and attaches securely to the pan's side.",
      "Read it accurately: Attach the thermometer to the side of the pan after the sugar mixture has come to a boil. The placement of the heat sensor varies among brands, but generally the bottom of the thermometer must be completely submerged in the sugar mixture to get an accurate reading. If the mixture is too shallow, carefully tilt the pan until liquid completely covers the bottom of the thermometer when you want to check the temperature.",

      "Wine note: When a recipe calls for wine as an ingredient, it's nice to find a bottle that is delicious enough to drink but affordable enough to toss a little in the skillet. Mani Masianco 2005 ($15), an Italian blend of pinot grigio and verduzzo, fills the bill. It's aromatic, with apple, lemon, and floral notes. It also has the necessary acidity to greet the potent acid of the capers. -Jeffery Lindenmuth",
      "This is the perfect dish for impressing guests while also being able to relax."

      "Add the flour, remaining 1/4 cup (50 g) of sugar, milk and salt and beat on low speed until combined. As soon as all the flour is almost mixed in, mix in 1/3 cup (80 g) of the coconut oil. Turn the mixer on medium speed and knead until the dough no longer sticks to the sides of the bowl, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer to a clean oiled bowl, cover with plastic wrap and leave it to rise for 2 hours, or until doubled in size.",
      "Punch down the risen dough to release the air. On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough to the size of a piece of printer paper, wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 hour. Remove from the fridge, and smear the remaining 11/3 cups (305 g) of coconut oil evenly over the middle third of the dough, then fold over the two edges to cover the oil. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and place in the fridge for 1 to 2 hours to chill the coconut oil.",
      "Remove the dough from the fridge and roll it out into an 8 x 24-inch (20 x 61-cm) rectangle, fold the rectangle in thirds, then roll it out again into an 8 x 24-inch (20 x 61-cm) rectangle. Do this 5 times, letting the dough rest on the counter so the glutens in the flour relax if it gets too difficult to roll out. It's okay if the cold coconut oil pierces the dough in a few spots. Then wrap again in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 6 to 8 hours, or overnight.",
      "To make the filling, whisk the milk, sugar and cornstarch together in a small saucepan over medium-low heat. Continue to whisk until thick, 2 to 3 minutes. Then add the coconut oil, almond extract and vanilla extract, whisking until combined. Stir in the almond flour, transfer to a bowl and let cool in the fridge overnight along with the croissant dough.",

Unwrap the dough and roll it out on a lightly floured work surface, into a long 1/4-inch (6-mm)-thick rectangle, making sure the rectangle gets no wider than 9 inches (23 cm) across. If you need to cut the dough in half for it to fit on the work surface, that's fine, just keep the other half wrapped in the fridge while you work. Cut long triangles up the width of the rectangle that are about 5 inches (12.7 cm) across at the base. Roll 2 tablespoons (30 g) of the filling into a coil, and place it at the base of the triangle. Pull on the ends of the triangle gently to stretch them, then using your palm, press down and roll the triangle up onto itself. Place it on the baking sheet with the tip tucked under the bottom of the pastry. Cover it with plastic wrap, and continue until all the pastries are rolled. You should get about 14 croissants.
