      "Prepare the Ricotta Biscuit dough: Sift the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt into a large mixing bowl. Place the bowl in the freezer to chill for 20 minutes. Add the butter to the dry ingredients and toss to combine. Pinch and smear the pieces of butter between your fingers. Processing the butter like this creates small leaves of butter that layer in the dough, resulting in flakes later. Once all the butter chunks have been pinched, grab small handfuls of flour and butter and rub the two together between the palms of your hands until the mixture resembles uneven pebbles on a sandy beach.",
      "Create a well in the center of the mixture and add 1 cup of the buttermilk. Using a fork, toss the flour and butter from around the edge of the well into the center. Fluff the buttermilk and flour mixture with the fork five or six times, until shaggy looking.",
      "Crumble the ricotta cheese into tablespoon-size chunks over the dough, making sure not to break up the cheese too much. Using your hands with your fingers spread wide open, loosely incorporate the cheese into the dough with a lift-and-gently-squeeze motion. Drizzle the remaining 1 cup of buttermilk over the dough while using the fork to bring the mixture together into a loose and shaggy mass.",
      "Scrape the dough onto a lightly floured work surface and use your hands to shape the dough into a 10 x 7-inch rectangle. Fold the rectangle in thirds like a letter and then rotate 90 degrees. Using a rolling pin, flatten the dough back into a 10 x 7-inch rectangle. Repeat the folding, rotating, and rolling process two more times, ending with the dough shaped into a 10 x 7-inch rectangle of about 1-inch thickness. Wrap the dough with plastic and refrigerate for 30 minutes. Return the dough to the work surface and roll it out to about 3/4-inch thickness. Cut it into 2-inch squares or use a round 2-inch cutter to make mini-biscuits.",
      "Position a rack in the center of your oven and preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F. Place a parchment-lined baking sheet on the lower rack of the oven to catch any drips.",

Bake the pudding until the biscuits are browned and baked through and the juices from the tomatoes bubble up around the edges of the dish, about 45 minutes. Serve the pudding warm. Any leftovers will keep well at room temperature overnight, but it's really best eaten the same day."

      "Helpful Hints: To make your own herb vinegars, you'll need about 1 cup of fresh herbs for every 2 cups of vinegar. White wine vinegar pairs well with almost any herb; red wine vinegar is best with stronger herbs such as rosemary and oregano. Rice wine vinegar is a great match for delicately flavored herbs and flowers such as chive blossoms. Don't use distilled vinegar-it's a natural for household cleaning, but the harsh acidity overpowers the flavor of herbs. Quart-size canning jars with plastic storage caps make the best containers for steeping flavored vinegars. If you use metal lids, place plastic wrap over the top of the jar before adding the lid to prevent the vinegar from turning dark."

I sprinkle them with a few teaspoons of lemon juice and let them sit a minute, then rinse again in hot water. Let them drain well- water is our enemy in this recipe!",
      "2 Next, get out a big frying pan- you don't need any grease or anything the noodles don't tend to burn or brown( and I tried!)and they don't stick(they really are a miracle, huh?). Dump the noodles in the pan and over high heat start cooking them. I stirred mine around a lot- As you stir and they start to dry, they start making a \"squeaking\" kind of noise as you push them. I kept mine on the heat until they lost translucency(some) and bits and parts seemed a bit \"shriveled\". Take them off the heat. I know, at this point it doesn't look like much does it? Don't worry if you over cook, it will just mean 1 or 2 less cookies. IF you undercook it just means your cookie dough maybe a little runny, and you may need another teaspoon of coco powder to \"thicken\" it.",
      "3 After they have cooled for a few minutes I put them in my handy mini Ninja food processor. I ran it until it almost looked like a gel-",
      "4 Then I threw in the honey,coco powder, baking powder,salt( I thought about vanilla, but as I said, moisture is the enemy when working with these noodles)and processed it quickly till blended. It seemed a hair on the runny side, so I threw it in the fridge for an hour and hoped for the best- Here is what it looked like after being in the fridge-",
      "5 I covered a cookie sheet with a piece of tin and sprayed with Pam non stick cooking spray.(no idea what would happen and figured if it was a mess the tin was easy clean up!) I tried 5 minutes at 375- but the tops were clearly sticky/raw still. So 10 minutes. I was thrilled with what I had created! Truly a fudgy,moist, 10 calorie chocolate miracle.",

Store clams in an open bowl in the refrigerator, and use them as soon as possible. Do not store clams in a sealed plastic bag or on ice because they will die. To shuck (open) clams, place them in the freezer for 15 to 30 minutes. After briefly freezing the clams, let them stand at room temperature a few minutes to relax. Working over a bowl or sink, hold the clam securely in one hand, and insert a clam knife into the opening of the shell between the top and bottom halves. You may want to protect your hand with a towel. If you don't have a clam knife, you may use a thin, short, dull knife. Never use a sharp kitchen knife. Using the blade of the knife, cut through the hinge muscle, and open the shell. Carefully slide the knife between the clam and the shell to detach the meat."

      "Wine note: Fresh summer vegetables come together in Orecchiette with Roasted Peppers, Arugula, and Tomatoes, making it a good candidate for a dry rose wine. With berry and Bing cherry flavors and bright acidity, Bonterra Rose 2008 ($14), from California, is a great example of how rose complements the acid and fruitiness of tomatoes. This wine also has a slightly herbal edge, reminiscent of the dish's herbes de Provence. --Jeffery Lindenmuth"
