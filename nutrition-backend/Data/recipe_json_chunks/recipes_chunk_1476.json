Add the flour all at once, and, moving quickly, stir with a wooden spoon until a dough forms. Continue stirring for about a minute, until the dough becomes glossy.",

Add eggs, one at a time, allowing them to fully incorporate into the dough. After three eggs, check the dough by running your finger through it at the bottom of the bowl. You're looking for a dough that springs back to close the channel you made. Add remaining eggs until it does so.",

Pipe roughly 3-inch long fingers of dough onto the baking sheet about an inch apaprt. Bake at 400\u00b0F for 20 minutes and reduce oven temperature to 350\u00b0F. Bake for another 15 minutes, or until the eclairs are crisp. if they're still moist in the middle, use a skewer or paring knife to make small holes in the bottom of the exlairs to allow the steam to escape. Let cool on a wire rack.",

Pour the cornstarch mixture into the pot with the rest of the milk, and continue to whisk over low heat until the mixture thickens. Stir in the cream cheese until it melts and forms a smooth cream. Pour into a mixing bowl and cover with plastic to prevent a skin from forming, chill until needed.",
      "Add the milk and corn syrup (if desired, just for a glossier glaze) together in a bowl. Whisk in the milk, one tablespoon at a time, until a thick glaze forms. Separate the glaze into three bowls and add food coloring to make purple, green, and yellow glazes.",

      "In a large skillet, cook half the bacon over moderate heat until just crisp, 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer the bacon to a bowl and repeat with the remaining bacon. Pour all but 2 tablespoons of the bacon fat into a small glass measuring cup.",
      "Reheat the bacon fat in the skillet. Add the diced baguette and cook over moderately high heat, stirring a few times, until crisp, about 4 minutes. Transfer the croutons to a plate to cool. Toss in the bowl with the bacon.",
      "Bring a large skillet of water to a boil. Add the white wine vinegar. Break 1 of the eggs into a small cup and slide the egg into the water. Repeat with 3 more eggs. Simmer over moderate heat until the whites are firm and the yolks are soft, about 3 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the poached eggs to a large platter lined with paper towels. Repeat with the remaining eggs. Keep the poaching water at a low simmer.",
      "Measure the reserved bacon fat into a large skillet. Add enough peanut oil to equal 1/3 cup. Add the shallots, season generously with salt and pepper and cook over low heat until softened, about 3 minutes. Add the garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Whisk in the red wine vinegar and remove the dressing from the heat.",
      "Return the poached eggs to the simmering water to reheat for 30 to 40 seconds. Bring the dressing back to a simmer over low heat. Add the frisee to the bacon and croutons in the bowl, add the hot dressing and toss well. Season with salt and pepper. Mound the salad in serving bowls or on plates and top each with a poached egg. Serve at once.",
      "Make Ahead: The eggs can be poached up to 2 hours ahead. Refrigerate and bring to room temperature before reheating. Place in a saucepan of simmering water for 30 to 40 seconds, drain, pat dry and serve.",
      "Wine Recommendation: A dry but fruity red with good acidity and a slight earthiness, such as a Beaujolais-Villages, can balance the flavors in this salad. Two good choices: the 1999 Louis Jadot and the 1999 Georges Duboeuf Flower Label."

My top pick: a juicy Australian shiraz. Its mouth-filling, plush, almost syrupy softness is a great contrast to the beef and beans, and the wine's rich fruitiness cushions all that spice. There are loads of terrific Australian shirazes on the market at all price levels. The affordable Yalumba Shiraz 2003 (South Australia, $10) is priced right for chili. -Karen MacNeil"

      "In a food processor, chop the chorizo into 1/2-inch pieces. In a large skillet, cook the chorizo over moderately high heat, stirring occasionally, until the fat is rendered, about 5 minutes. Drain the chorizo and transfer to a paper towel-lined plate; discard the fat.",
      "Wipe out the skillet and melt the 4 tablespoons of solid butter in it. Add the onion, celery, garlic, poblanos and thyme and cook over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 10 minutes. Scrape into a large bowl. Add the chorizo, corn kernels, corn bread, melted butter and stock. Season with salt and pepper and stir well. Let cool.",
      "MEANWHILE, PREPARE THE TURKEY: Preheat the oven to 450\u00b0. Put the anchos in a medium bowl and cover with hot water. Let soak until softened, about 30 minutes. Drain well. In a food processor, puree the anchos with the garlic and butter until smooth. Season with salt and pepper. Rub 2 tablespoons of the ancho paste in the main turkey cavity. Loosen the skin at the neck and carefully extend your hands all the way to the thigh and leg. Rub the remaining ancho paste under the skin.",
      "Loosely fill the main turkey cavity with 5 cups of the stuffing and tie the legs together with kitchen string. Spoon 1 cup of the stuffing into the neck cavity and tuck the extra skin underneath or secure with toothpicks. Spoon the remaining stuffing into a buttered 3-quart baking dish and drizzle with 1 cup of the stock.",
      "Set the turkey in a very large roasting pan and season it with salt and pepper. Roast the turkey for 30 minutes, then reduce the heat to 375\u00b0. Add 1 cup of the stock to the roasting pan and roast the turkey for 3 hours longer, or until an instant-read thermometer inserted in an inner thigh registers 180\u00b0 and the stuffing registers 165\u00b0. Cover the turkey loosely with foil if the skin browns quickly. Transfer the turkey to a cutting board, cover with foil and let rest for 30 minutes.",
      "Bake the stuffing in the baking dish for about 30 minutes, or until heated through and crisp on top.",
      "Meanwhile, pour the roasting pan juices into a large glass measuring cup. Skim off the fat. In a small cup, whisk 1/2 cup of the stock with the flour and set aside. Set the roasting pan over 2 burners on high heat. Add the remaining 2 1/2 cups of stock and bring to a simmer. Using a wooden spoon, scrape up any browned bits from the bottom and sides of the pan. Add the reserved pan juices to the roasting pan, then strain through a fine sieve into a medium saucepan. Boil the juices over high heat until reduced to 3 cups, about 10 minutes. Whisk in the flour mixture and boil until thickened, about 5 minutes. Season the gravy with salt and pepper and transfer to a warmed gravy boat.",
      "Carve the turkey and serve with the gravy and the corn bread stuffing from the turkey and the baking dish.",
      "Make Ahead: The uncooked corn bread stuffing can be covered with plastic wrap and refrigerated overnight. Stuff the turkey just before roasting.",
      "Wine Recommendation: The heat from the chiles and the chorizo calls for an equally spicy and fruity California Syrah, such as the 2000 Justin Paso Robles or the 2001 Lincourt."

Thicken the mixture a little more by stirring over residual heat, and using the saute function as needed. When the mixture is very thick and sticky, discard the cinnamon sticks and star anise and spoon the remainder into a glass, plastic, or metal container that can act as a mold. Let the mixture come down to room temperature, then cover tightly and chill in the refrigerator for 2-3 hours, or until it solidifies into a meaty jelly.",

Cut fat into 1-in. cubes and put in a medium bowl. Freeze both shoulder and fat until semifrozen, about 2 hours. (Keep meat semifrozen for duration of recipe; otherwise it won't grind easily).",
      "Assemble grinder and attach to stand mixer following manufacturer's instructions, making sure the chilled grinding tool is fully inserted (you have to twist it in). Grind fat through large grinding plate, a few chunks at a time, into a medium stainless steel bowl. Fat should fall crisply and cleanly out of the grinder; if it smears, it's too warm (return fat to freezer).",
      "Transfer half of pork shoulder to a large bowl; keep remaining half of shoulder frozen. Grind pork through large grinding plate, a few chunks at a time, back onto its baking sheet and return to freezer. Change to medium plate and grind remaining half of pork onto another baking sheet or large bowl.",

If you would like the flavors to mellow, cover bowl with plastic wrap and chill 24 hours before continuing; for a spicier sausage, proceed with the recipe.",
      "Continue forming patties, or make sausages by stuffing meat into casings. To stuff meat into casings, put grinding mechanism, meat hopper, and ground meat back in freezer. Flush casings with warm water using a small funnel inserted in one end of casing (do this in a clean sink). Soak casings in warm water at least 30 minutes and up to 1 hour.",
      "Follow manufacturer's instructions for assembling stuffer and attaching to mixer, using the medium-size horn and greasing it with butter or lard. Push casings all the way onto the horn in one long piece, as though you were putting on a stocking. Knot the end of the casing. Take out 1/4 of meat from freezer and keep rest in freezer as you work (if it warms up, it will gum up the machine and won't have as nice a texture when cooked).",
      "Guide meat into casings so it packs tightly and firmly and let finished sausages coil into a bowl. As each reaches the length you like--about 6 to 8 inches and slim is standard for this chorizo--twist it into an individual sausage link or tie off with kitchen twine. Prick any air holes with a sharp toothpick.",
      "Freeze sausages or patties at this point, or cook. For sausages: Grill over indirect 300\u00b0 heat or pan-cook over medium heat until they're plump, browned, and shiny (an instant-read thermometer inserted lengthwise reads 145\u00b0). For patties: Grill or pan-cook until crisp-edged and browned.",
      "* A good one-stop shopping source for the paprikas in this recipe is spanishtable.com. Pre-order back fat and hog casings from a butcher shop.",
      "Fresh chorizo keeps, chilled, up to 3 days; frozen in 2 layers of resealable plastic bags, up to 3 months. Cooked chorizo keeps 1 week; frozen, up to 5 months.",
      "Note: Nutritional analysis is per sausage.",
      "To make this sausage, you'll need a stand mixer equipped with a sausage grinder attachment (available at kitchenware stores and from amazon.com). If you want to stuff your sausages, you'll need a stuffer attachment (also available at kitchenware stores and from amazon.com) and some hog casings (pre-order from a butcher shop). It's undeniably an adventure to stuff sausages, but well worth it. If you don't feel like going to the trouble of stuffing sausages, you can form the meat into patties.",
      "This may seem like a lot of sausage, but trust us, you will be glad, because everyone you know will want some. Both the sausages and patties freeze well.",
