      "Pour the batter through a fine-mesh sieve positioned over a bowl and discard the solids.",
      "Stir in the scallion and set the batter aside for 1 hour.",
      "It will thicken to the consistency of heavy cream.",
      "There should be about 3 cups batter.",
      "To make the filling, roughly divide the pork, shrimp, mushrooms, and onion into 8 portions.",
      "(Dividing the ingredients now will ensure less frantic frying and avoid overstuffing.)",
      "Put these ingredients along with the mung bean, bean sprouts, batter, and oil next to the stove.",
      "For each crepe, heat 2 teaspoons of the oil in a 10-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.",
      "Add a portion each of the pork, shrimp, mushrooms, and onion and saute, breaking up the meat, for about 45 seconds, or until seared and aromatic.",
      "Visualize a line down the middle of the skillet and roughly arrange the ingredients on either side of the line.",
      "Anything in the middle would make it hard to fold the crepe neatly later.",
      "Because the rice will have settled at the bottom of the bowl, give the batter a good stir with a ladle.",
      "Pour 1/3 cup of the batter into the skillet and swirl the skillet to cover the bottom; a bit going up the side forms a lovely lacy edge.",
      "The batter should dramatically sizzle (making that xeo noise!)",
      "and bubble.",
      "When it settles down, sprinkle on 1 1/2 tablespoons of the mung bean, and then pile 1/2 cup of the bean sprouts on one side.",
      "Lower the heat to medium, cover, and cook until the bean sprouts have wilted slightly, about 3 minutes.",
      "Remove the lid and drizzle in 1 teaspoon of the oil around the rim of the pan.",
      "Lower the heat slightly and continue to cook, uncovered, for 3 to 4 minutes to crisp the crepe.",
      "The edge will have pulled away from the skillet and turned golden brown.",
      "At this point, use a spatula to check underneath for a crispy bottom.",
      "From the center to the edge, the crepe should go from being soft to crispy.",
      "Lower the heat if you need to cook it longer.",
      "When you are satisfied, use a spatula to fold the half without the bean sprouts over the other half.",
      "Use the spatula to transfer the crepe to a serving dish, or simply slide it out of the pan onto the dish.",
      "Increase the heat to medium-high and repeat with the remaining batter and filling ingredients to make 8 crepes in all.",
      "Use any left over batter to make a poor mans crepe without filling.",
