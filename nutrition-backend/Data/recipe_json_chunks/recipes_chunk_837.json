Spoon this mixture over the warm cake so that it can seep down into the holes. Measure out half of the crushed candy bars and sprinkle the pieces over the cake. Place the whipped topping and cream cheese in a bowl and blend with electric mixer on low speed until smooth and combined. Spread mixture over the top of the candy.
