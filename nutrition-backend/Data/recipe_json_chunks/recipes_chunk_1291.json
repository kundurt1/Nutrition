Set aside but keep the salsa at room temperature. Take your sweet potatoes and cut them into 1/2' rounds. Toss with olive oil, salt and pepper until lightly coated. When ready, place the sweet potatoes directly on the grill rack. Grill on one side for about 8-10 minutes. When you flip them over, add your fish steaks to the grill also. Cook steaks on one side for approximately 5-7 minutes. Flip them over (very carefully) and at that time your potatoes should be fork tender and ready to take off the heat.

Beating continually with a whisk, add the polenta slowly and gradually. Stir constantly as you cook the polenta until it reaches the consistency of a creamy porridge, about 5 minutes.

In a wide, ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat, warm the olive oil. Cook the quail until they are lightly browned with crisp skin, 3 to 4 minutes on each side. Sprinkle the wine over the quail. When the wine has evaporated, add the chicken stock and the shallots. Cover the pan with foil or an ovenproof lid and place it in the preheated oven. After 5 minutes, uncover, then cook for another 5 minutes. Remove the pan from the oven. Remove the quail and set them aside in a warm place. Skim the fat from the pan, then let the remaining juices simmer over low heat until they are reduced by half and the shallots are brown and burnished, 15 to 20 minutes, stirring up the brown bits from the bottom of the pan.",

Cook until lightly browned all over and be sure to mash it up so there aren't any big clumps of ground beef anywhere. Quickly add the kidney beans and tomatoes, Worcestershire sauce, cumin and beef broth. Yeah its a lot to add at one time but just prep all the cans and it'll be easy. Once everything is added together turn down the heat to a low-medium and let it bubble away for about 45 minutes or until nice and thick.

    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "Sift the flour with baking powder and salt in a medium-sized bowl. Using an electric mixer, cream the butter for a full minute, then add the sugar and beat at medium speed until light, about 5 minutes. Beat in eggs and vanilla until fluffy and very light, another 2 to 4 minutes. With a wooden spoon gradually work the flour into the creamed mixture. Divide the dough into two portions and wrap in waxed paper or plastic wrap. Refrigerate until firm, at least several hours or overnight.",
      "Heat the oven to 400\u00b0. On a floured surface, roll out the dough to 1/4 inch thick, using more flour for the rolling pin, sprinkled on the dough, and additionally on the floured surface as needed to prevent sticking. Cut into desired shapes with cookie cutters and place on cookie sheets.",
      "This dough works beautifully if gathered and rerolled; if it gets too soft, chill for about 15 minutes.",
      "Refrigerate or freeze the cut-out cookies on their baking sheets for 10 to 15 minutes so they will retain their firm edges as they bake; if you're in a hurry, go ahead and bake the cookies immediately. Bake for 5 to 8 minutes or until cookies are puffed and only just barely starting to brown at the edges: Start with the shortest amount of time and watch carefully, especially with very small cookies. As the cookies are fragile right out of the oven, let cool slightly before moving to a wire rack to cool completely.",
      "When cool, glaze and decorate as desired.",
      "Makes up to 6 dozen cookies, depending on the size. This recipe can be easily doubled or tripled.",
      "Whisk the egg white and salt until loosened and beginning to foam. Add oil, confectioners' sugar, and cream gradually and whisk, adding more sugar and cream until the glaze is of spreading consistency: You want it to be thin enough to spread easily over the cookies to their edges, but not so thin it runs off the sides.",
      "Using an offset spatula or a smooth table knife, spread the glaze over each cookie, filling in the shape to its edges. While the glaze is wet, you can decorate the cookies with colored sprinkles, or leave the glaze plain, let dry, and add more decoration with Royal Icing.",
      "Before you start, make sure that all utensils and containers are clean and grease-free. Have ready several small containers for dividing the icing and tinting it with different colors, if desired. You will need to keep the royal icing covered with a damp cloth, plastic wrap, or tight fitting lid or it will dry out. Royal icing will keep, tightly covered, in the refrigerator for about one week. This recipe is proportioned for the firmest-textured icing; adjust the texture with the addition of water or sugar as explained below.",
      "If using egg whites, combine the egg whites, cream of tartar, and sugar and beat until the icing is thick and holds billowy peaks, about 6 to 8 minutes. Add glycerin for extra shine, if desired.",
      "If using meringue powder, whisk the meringue powder and sugar together in the bowl of an electric mixer. Add the water and beat on low speed for about 5 minutes, until icing is thick and holds billowy peaks. Don't overbeat or the icing texture will become hard to work with. Add glycerin for extra shine, if desired. To adjust the consistency of icing: To thicken, add sifted confectioners' sugar a spoonful at a time, whisking thoroughly until you reach the desired consistency. To thin, add warm water a few drops at a time, mixing with a spoon. Piped outlines and details require the thickest icing; flows of color over a whole cookie or in sections can be somewhat thinner.",
      "Royal icing hardens very quickly when exposed to air, so cover with a damp cloth, plastic wrap, or container lids when not in immediate use.",
      "Divide the icing into separate containers for each color to be used. Tint the icing with small amounts of food coloring until it reaches the color desired.",
      "To use, icing can be spread onto cookies with an offset spatula or table knife-even painted on with small, previously unused paintbrushes, such as the ones that come in a child's paint box-or it can be piped through a pastry bag and tips. For simple, plain outlines, use a zipper plastic bag with a tiny hole cut from one corner.",
      "Makes about 3 cups of icing."

      "A great Caesar salad gets its swagger from a great dressing. Squeamish about raw egg yolks and anchovies? Sorry. Yolks are what give richness to the emulsion, while anchovies provide a briny blast (and that whole umami thing). Here's our go-to recipe: Chop together 6 anchovy fillets packed in oil, 1 small garlic clove, and a pinch of kosher salt. Use the side of a knife blade to mash into a paste, then scrape into a medium bowl. Whisk in 2 large egg yolks*, 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice, and 3/4 teaspoon Dijon mustard. Adding drop by drop to start, gradually whisk in 2 tablespoons olive oil, then 1/2 cup vegetable oil; whisk until dressing is thick and glossy. Whisk in 3 tablespoons finely grated Parmesan. Season with salt, freshly ground black pepper, and more lemon juice, if desired. Can be made 1 day ahead.",
      "Make your own. Tearing, not cutting, the bread ensures nooks and crannies that catch the dressing and add texture. Toss 3 cups torn 1\" pieces country bread with 3 tablespoons olive oil on a baking sheet; season with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper. Bake at 375\u00b0F, tossing occasionally, until golden, 10-15 minutes.",
      "Use whole leaves from 3 romaine hearts to feed 6 people. They provide the ideal mix of crispness, surface area, and structure.",
      "Caesars crowned with a mound of grated Parmesan may look impressive, but all that clumpy cheese mutes the dressing. Instead, use a vegetable peeler to thinly shave a modest amount on top for little salty bursts.",
      "Skip the tongs. Use your hands to gently toss the lettuce, croutons, and dressing, then top off with the shaved Parm."

Slit the vanilla bean lengthwise in half and, using a sharp knife, scrape the seeds out into the bowl. Beat the oil, sugar, and vanilla together, then gradually add the eggs. The mix should be smooth and thick at this stage. Mix in the diced apples, raisins, and lemon zest, then lightly fold in the sifted dry ingredients.",

Transfer the chicken to a cutting board and let rest for 10 minutes.",

Heat the olive oil in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. When the oil is hot, add the meat and cook, working in two batches so as to not overcrowd, until the meat is a deep golden brown on all sides, about 30 minutes. Transfer the meat to a plate and pour any excess grease out of the pot. Place the meat back in the pot and add the milk, sage, rosemary, bay leaf, lemon zest and garlic. Cover the pan and bake on the center rack, turning the meat occasionally until the pork is tender and the milk has curdled and becomes golden brown, about 21/2 to 3 hours.",
