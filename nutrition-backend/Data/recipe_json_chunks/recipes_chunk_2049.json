      "For cookies: The ganache can be used when its still warm, as long as its firm enough not to drip off the edges of the cookies.",
      "Fill a pastry bag and cut a small hole (no tip necessary), then pipe about 1 teaspoon onto each cookie (see Sandwich Cookies, page 58).",
      "For truffles: While it is still warm, pour the ganache into a prepared 8-inch square baking pan as directed in the recipe for Double Chocolate Truffles (page 172).",
      "For ice cream: Spoon warm ganache over your favorite ice cream and serve immediately.",
      "The ganache can be kept in a heatproof airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks or frozen for up to 8 weeks.",
      "To reheat, place the container in a pan of simmering water, so that the water comes about halfway to three-quarters of the way up the sides of the container.",
      "Heat it until the sides have melted, then transfer it to a bowl and melt it fully over a double boiler.",
      "The main pitfall in preparing ganache is its tendency to break, whereby the cocoa butter fats pull away from the rest of the mixture and refuse to emulsify.",
      "A broken ganache will result in congealed fat separated from the chocolate when it sets, a problem that is both unattractive and unpalatable.",
      "Breaking is more common with milk or white chocolate ganaches, which have a much higher percentage of cocoa butter content than dark chocolates.",
      "The easiest way to fix a broken ganache is to take half your ganache and reheat it over a double boiler until it is liquefied.",
      "Take the other half and put it in the refrigerator, so that the separated fat solidifies.",
      "Then mix the two halves together, stirring vigorously.",
      "The warm ganache will remelt the fat in the cooler ganache, and the stirring action should help it emulsify with the cream and chocolate."
