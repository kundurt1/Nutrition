      "Try to buy a whole fillet that is already \"peeled \" ( trimmed of silverskin, fat etc. ) or if you prefer you can buy untrimmed and do it yourself.",
      "The whole filet has a taped part ( called the tail ) and when you roast, tuck this part under so you can have a more even piece of meat for roasting.",
      "If the whole filet is too large to fit your roasting pan you may cut the filet in half and roast the two parts in the pan together.",
      "Make sure the meat comes to room temperature prior to roasting for even roasting which also helps with tenderness.",
      "Rub oil ( we prefer olive ) over the filet and then rub in seasonings such as salt , pepper, paprika, crushed garlic etc. The Montreal Steak Seasoning is a nice choice ( available in the seasoning or meat sections of supermarkets ) .",
      "Or other people prefer to coat the filet with Dijon mustard and then roll the filet in finely crushed black or colored peppercorns prior to roasting.",
      "Both ways are delicious.",
      "Place the filet on a roasting rack over the roasting pan.",
      "You can also place the filet over some beef bones in the pan which also act as a rack.",
      "Preheat the oven to 475 degrees F.",
      "Place the prepared filet on the rack and roast 20 minutes ( for a average 5 lb roast- ). Then decrease the temperature to 350F and roast an additional 20 minutes.",
      "Remove the filet from the oven and let sit about 15 minutes before slicing.",
      "This total time factor should produce medium rare. A heavier roast will probably need more roasting time and a smaller roast less time. The sitting times allows for best slicing and lets some of the juices settle etc. If you prefer you can check and rely on a meat thermometer to test so you don't under or over roast the meat..",
      "Insert thermometer in the thickest part of the roast. Generally 120 to 130 F is rare and 130 to 140 F is medium rare. Remember the meat will continue to cook with \"standing time\" out of the oven.",
      "Meanwhile make the mushroom sauce ( this is a natural and not thickened sauce ). In a large skillet over medium high heat cook the onion in some olive oil or butter until softened.",
      "Add the sliced mushrooms and garlic and continue to cook and stir until the mushrooms have reduced in volume by 1/2 and become tender.",
      "Add the vermouth, dashes of Worcestershire sauce and Gravy Master ( a browning/ caramelized color for sauces etc. ). Cook and stir another 5 to 10 minutes and then season to taste. If you wish you may add a few tablespoons of the pan drippings or a bit of beef bullion paste ( available in jars ) for a richer flavor.",

      "Serving suggestions: Hogao can be used in a variety of ways. In Colombia, we use it for just about everything. We put it on top of our arepas (corn meal patties), on top of beans, boiled potatoes, rice, meats of all kinds, yuca, plantains, etc., etc. We also mix it with fried potatoes, eggs or anything else that we want to add flavor to. One of my favorite uses is to simply spread some hogao on top of a warm flour tortilla, roll it up and eat it as a snack. In the mornings, I mix it with an egg and make a breakfast burrito out of it. The uses of hogao are as varied as the people who eat it every day.",
      "BTW, when you finish making the hogao and you have stored it in you favorite Tupperware container, grab a piece of white bread and sop-up the dripping in the frying pan. Man! That's good stuff!"

This recipe makes four very LARGE servings (or smaller with leftovers) and is a great company recipe especially for those who can't cook or are pressed for time. Turn on or pre-set your oven to come on at 2:00 and you will be serving at 6:00. Serve with crusty bread or rolls, a green salad and a good bottle of wine. So easy and so delicious! Bon appetite!"

Color the second portion sunset orange with Orange, a bit of Watermelon Red, and a bit of Electric Pink. Tint the third portion a deeper pink with Electric Pink and a touch of Watermelon Red, and the last portion a lighter pink with Electric Pink an a touch of orange.",

      "Bake your cakes for roughly 30-35 minutes, but keep an eye on them starting at minute 25. You'll know they're baked through when you press down in the center of each cake and it springs back. You can also insert a cake tester, and it should come out completely clean.",
      "Remove your cakes from the oven and allow to come to room temperature on a rack. Then, I like to wrap them up in plastic and put them in the fridge for at least half an hour, preferably overnight before I remove them from the pans. The cakes should be cold all the way through before attempting to trim them.",
      "Prepare Your Buttercream:",

      "Divide your buttercream into three equal portions. Set one of these portions aside.",

Color each portion a different shade of orange to create an ombre effect that ranges from your yellow and your fiery red that you just finished mixing. Use Electric Yellow, Tulip Red, and Orange to achieve this.",
      "Stack Your Base:",
      "Level and torte each of your 4 cakes in half. Take three layers total and stack these first, spreading a thin layer of pink buttercream between the cake layers. Set in the fridge or freezer for about 10 minutes until the buttercream hardens up.",
      "Now you're going to create the rays of the sun in this section of cake. It's tricky, so work patiently and take your time! Take your cake out of the fridge and, using a small, sharp paring knife, cut into the cake, inserting the knife halfway the side of the cake at about a 25\u00b0 angle. Without using a sawing motion at all, pull the knife through the cake as you rotate it on your turntable, creating a cone shape that you're cutting into your cake.",
      "Pop the top of the cake out and set it aside. Spread a thin layer of yellow buttercream onto the exposed insides of the cake, then replace the top portion and gently press it into the buttercream to adhere. Place in the fridge or freezer for another 10 minutes to let it firm up again.",
      "Repeat this step twice more, although the second time you'll move your knife up to just inside the circumference of the top of the cake and hold it at a 45\u00b0 angle, and the third time you'll move your knife to a little over halfway along the radius of the top of the cake and hold it at a 65\u00b0 angle. Make sure to rest the cake in the fridge or freezer between each cut to firm up the yellow buttercream!",
      "Finally, flip that section of cake upside down and use that paring knife to carve a shallow dome into the exposed base of the cake. I used a spoon to press the cake down into a smoother dome shape after cutting.",
      "Fill the dome completely with yellow buttercream and freeze or refrigerate again.",
      "Begin stacking your remaining layers of cake on your cake board or plate, layering a small amount of pink buttercream between every cake layer. Reserve the final layer and set aside.",
      "Grab your cake segment with the sun inside and flip it over onto the layers of cake you've been building up so that the sun dome is resting on the layers of cake below. Add a thin layer of pink buttercream on top of this segment and cap it with that final reserved layer of cake. Refrigerate for at least 10 minutes.",
      "Decorate the Base:",
      "Place your red and orange buttercreams into piping bags. Scoop about a half cup of your remaining yellow buttercream into a piping bag as well. Cut the tips off the bags to create a hole 1/8th of an inch wide on each.",
      "Place the remainder of your yellow buttercream in a piping bag fitted with your large star tip and set aside.",
      "Remove your stacked cake from the fridge and trim away the brown sides of the cake. Then, pipe your yellow buttercream in rings rising up the base of the cake until it reaches roughly 1/5th of the way up the sides.",
      "Repeat with your ombre of orange buttercream, working your way up the sides of the cake, and finish with your red buttercream taking it all the way to the top, then covering the top of the cake entirely.",
      "Use your bench scraper to gently smooth the sides of the cake, holding it completely still at the base while you spin your turntable, cleaning it off, then moving it up towards the top and repeating. You will create smooth stripes of color that barely blend into each other.",
      "Smooth out the top of the cake with a small offset spatula, then, if you have one, use your extra tall cake scraper to smooth the sides one more time to create a perfectly cohesive smooth look. Tidy up the lip of buttercream at the top of the cake with your offset.",
      "Pipe frilly poofs of yellow buttercream with your star tip at the top of the cake, then add your sprinkles.",
      "Slice Your Cake:",
      "Cut slices from your cake, either one at a time or, for a grand effect, remove an entire half of the cake at once to reveal the full sunset effect!"

      "This is about the time to add all the seasonings - salt, pepper, and cumin. Hickory salt is good in this, it gives the chili a little darker color and gives it a little bit of smoke flavor. Cumin is really the secret ingredient though. The cumin gives it the chili taste without using chili powder, and makes a yellow broth instead of a dark red one. My spice measurements are guesstimates though, as I always season until it tastes just right.",
      "While all this is coming to a boil, peel the potatoes, and cut them into small (3/8 inch) chunks. Add the corn and potatoes into the mix. I used frozen sweet corn that I had put up from my garden this summer and the results were delicious. I don't recommend canned corn, but I never have been a big fan of canned corn for some reason. Add a little more water if needed, if the chili looks too thick to cook for a while.",
      "Now just sit back, turn the heat down to medium and let it all simmer for about 45 minutes while stirring occasionally.",
      "Turn off the heat and let it cool for a few minutes. Now it's ready to serve. Top with the shredded cheese and your favorite hot sauce and you're good to go. This recipe is great for game day parties, and also re-heats well for the next day, as any true chili should."

This dough is very soft, elastic and hard to handle compared to other pizza doughs and will require some effort to get to 9 inches diameter. I use combination patting down, stretching, and use of rolling pin to get it to 9 inch diameter. Once you get very good handling this dough, you may get it to 12 inch diameter, but 9 inch is perfectly fine.",
      "Lightly oil the pizza baking pan and place the pizza. Spread 1/4 C to 1/2 C sauce over the surface of dough, leaving a 1/4 to 1/2 inch border uncovered. Arrange mozzarella over the top and sprinkle with grated Parmesan or Romano cheese.",
      "Bake for about 9-10 minutes in the middle rack. When done, the crust should be puffy and slightly charred on the edge and thinner in the center, and cheese fully melted and just beginning to brown in spots. The underside of the crust should be brown and crisp, not white and soft. Keep an eye on it until you know how long your oven will take because each oven is different.",
      "Remove the pizza from the oven and lay 4 - 6 basil leaves. Repeat with the remaining ingredients to make the next pizza."

Pecans will rise to the top during baking. If they flip over after pouring in the filling, turn them so they are turned the same way and will \"look pretty.\" (as my ggmother used to say) Bake at 375 degrees for 35-40 minutes, or until a knife inserted about halfway from the center to the edge comes out clean. You may want to cover the pie crust edge with aluminum foil or a ring to keep from browning too much."
