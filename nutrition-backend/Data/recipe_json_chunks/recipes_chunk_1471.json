Goat cheese is an ideal partner for sauvignon blanc. Both goat cheese and the sauvignon blanc have clean, fresh, tangy, earthy flavors, so the food and wine mirror each other.

Reduce oven temperature to 375\u00b0F, and bake 40 to 45 minutes, shielding pie with foil to prevent over-browning after 20 minutes, if needed, until crust is golden and filling is bubbly. Remove from baking sheet to a wire rack; cool at least 1 hour before serving. Serve with ice cream, if desired."
