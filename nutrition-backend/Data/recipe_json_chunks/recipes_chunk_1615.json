    "title": "tips for the perfectly toasted kale chip",
    "ingredients": [],
    "directions": [
      "Tips for perfectly toasted kale chips",
      "1. The water. After rinsing the kale, shake off excess water & wrap in a few paper towels. Let rest a minute then begin wiping & dabbing each leaf with the paper towel both top and bottom of the leaf. Not kidding here...search and destroy every little droplet of water. Water is your enemy.",
      "2. The kale. It has a tough woody stem that you don't want. Hold the end of the stem with one hand, and starting at the base of the leaf, use your other hand to strip away the leaf from the stem. Don't be shy - you'll have a much better result if you can strip away the leaf as intact as possible. I disagreed with recipe I'm linking when it says to cut the leaves into pieces. That makes for a lot of little nibbly bits because these shrink in the oven. I prefer keeping the leaves larger sized. They're easier to bake, as well.",
      "3. The oil. Place the kale leaves in a large bowl and drizzle a bit of olive oil on top. For one large bundle of kale, I used 2 tablespoons of oil. Toss with your clean hands and gently coat at much of the kale as possible. It will shine up beautifully. It's possible not all the leaves are evenly coated, more on that below.",
      "4. The baking sheet. You need a large baking sheet - probably 2 of them. And as much as I favor cooking on parchment or foil to protect the pan and easy clean up - that is a No-No with this kale. You need to bake the kale directly on the pan to ensure the best crispiness. Nonstick spray is not needed. The chips won't really stick to the pan (unless you burn them...but you won't do that).",
      "5. The placement. Do not overcrowd the pan. Place the kale in one layer - everyone gets their little personal space. And this is the time you inspect each leaf for proper oil distribution. Just use what's already there and rub it around a little. I have no doubt you'll see areas that were missed earlier. Again, probably don't need more oil, try to use what's already on the leaf.",
      "6. The seasoning. Sprinkle with the kosher salt, or sea salt...but ignore the temptation to over-season. My first batch I put on what I thought seemed OK, but it turned out too salty. You can always add more later once they're cooked. I'll be trying other seasonings in the future, sesame seeds come to mind.",
      "7. The oven. Every oven has their own personality and peculiarities. Some bake hotter towards the back, others bake hotter on the bottom. Whatever your oven's personality is - it will shine through with these kale chips...and in a bad way. If you know your oven bakes hotter on the bottom, then 1/2 way through baking, put it on the top rack...do whatever you need to in order to adjust the position of the baking sheet. With my oven, it bakes hotter in the rear, so I had to turn the baking sheet around 1/2 way through. In the picture below, this is 1/2 way through and I was in the middle of turning them over when the picture was snapped. I put everyone back in their little spot so there was no over-crowding.",
      "8. The baking. Temperature is key. The recipe calls for 250F but that was too low for me. I live at an elevation a mile high, so my oven needs to run hotter. I adjusted to 300F and it worked perfectly. Bake for around 15 minutes, however start peeking in on it at around 10 minutes, pull it out and see where you're at with crispiness. At first, the chip will be somewhat wilty...that's OK. Turn them over and put them back in the oven and check on it in another 5 minutes. Need to give each side their fair chance to bake directly on the sheet. Once the chips seem \"close\" to being done, but not quite there, hang out near the oven. This is where mistakes can happen, even over-baking for 2 minutes will burn your chip. You know those pictures of yucky brown kale chips? Ya, those are burned and bitter. You want a dark forest green chip. Remove from the oven and let sit a moment, plate up and snuggle in for a good movie with your bowl of kale chips.",
      "9. Storage - if you have the rare occasion when some are left over, simply cover loosely with plastic wrap or place in a plastic bag - might not want to seal the bag entirely, leave an airspace open. Oh, and be sure they are totally cooled before covering - you don't want steam or condensation to build."

      "Combine water, sugar, vanilla bean, cinnamon sticks, and allspice berries in a pot and bring to a boil on medium-high heat. Turn stove temperature to low-medium heat in order to maintain a gentle simmer. Set pot aside once sugar is completely dissolved.",
      "Peel pears from top to bottom and cut them in half.",
      "Scoop out the centers with a melon baller to remove the seeds and the fibers. Trim any remaining fibers and the stem of each half with a pairing knife.",
      "Add halved pears to light syrup. Cut a piece of wax paper so that it's big enough to cover all of the pears in the pot. Make a few slits on the wax paper with a small pairing knife. Gently place wax paper over the pears and adjust it as needed so that it covers the entire surface and it rests directly over the pears throughout the entire poaching process.",
      "Allow pears to poach anywhere from 40 minutes to 2 hours at low-medium heat (depending on the ripeness level of each pear), so that they are tender and show no signs of resistance when you poke or cut into them. Flip pears over at least once midway through poaching time to acquire a more even poaching all around. Remove pears from heat and allow them to cool down to room temperature. Store poached spiced pears and the syrup in an airtight container and place it in the fridge until further use.",

Place over medium-high heat and cook until sugar caramelizes and turns into a shade of dark amber. Remove from heat and pour heavy cream and milk mixture, whisking until evenly incorporated. (Note: If caramel locks up and becomes solid, continue cooking over low-medium heat until caramel slowly melts. Be sure not to cook caramel too dark or too light. Overly dark caramel will taste burnt and bitter, causing the ice cream to taste burnt and bitter as well. On the other hand, if the caramel is too light, it won't develop much of a caramel flavor. Sugar should be cooked so that it's not too light or too dark in color so that it has the perfect balance of sweetness and bitterness). Add vanilla extract to caramel and stir.",
      "Meanwhile, place egg yolks, 1 tablespoon of sugar, and salt in a bowl. Slowly pour warm caramel over egg yolks while whisking constantly. (Note: If you prefer your caramel ice cream to be less salty in flavor, reduce salt amount by half. You can always taste the ice cream base before you spin it and add a bit more salt if you want to increase the saltiness of it). Pour yolk-caramel mixture back into pot and cook over a low and gentle heat so that eggs don't become scrambled. Stir mixture in a figure 8 pattern with a wooden spoon so that all sides of the pot are touched as you cook it. Continue cooking until you can draw your finger across the back of the spoon and it makes a mark through the ice cream base without it running back on itself.",
      "Remove from heat and pass ice cream base through a sieve and onto a heatproof bowl. Place heatproof bowl over ice water bath for about 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally. Once ice cream base is completely chilled, cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 8 hours.",
      "Assemble and engage the KitchenAid(R) Ice Cream Maker Attachment, dasher, and drive assembly as directed by attachment instructions. Turn the KitchenAid(R) Professional 600 Series Stand Mixer to speed 2. Pour chilled ice cream base into a container with a spout and pour base slowly into Ice Cream Maker Attachment. Churn on Stand Mixer speed 2 for about 25 minutes, until the ice cream base thickens and grows in volume. Transfer ice cream into an airtight container and freeze for a minimum of 6 hours.",
      "To serve, cut poached pears into thin slices with a paring knife. Using a small serrated knife, cut the top off each profiterole and scoop caramel ice cream into each profiterole base using a 1-1/8\" ice cream scoop. Place profiterole tops over scoops of salted caramel ice cream. Place assembled profiteroles on serving plate and the sliced poached spiced pears alongside them. Add a few toasted pecans over the pears and profiteroles if desired. Serve immediately."

      "Divide your dough into 14 even pieces (more if you want smaller, antojito-sized sopes). At this point, you can form all of the disks at once, to streamline the process...or press as you go, whatever you find works best for you. If you're fortunate enough to have a press (different from a tortilla press...it has an indentation, or well to allow for thicker disks), cut a large baggie in half, place the dough balls between and press. If you do not have a press, form the dough into a disk between your palms and fingers. You should end up with a disk of dough ~1/8-1/4\" in thickness.",
      "Place the disks onto the blazing hot comal and toast until they start to turn golden on the first side. Carefully flip it over and repeat on the other side...probably about a couple of minutes each. Set aside on a large plate or tray until all the dough is toasted. At this point you should turn on the heat under your oil (you want it to get to about 375 degrees F). Working carefully, pinch together the outsides of the toasted disks to make a ridge...this will expose some of the inner, uncooked dough. Repeat until all the sopes are formed.",
      "Okay, once all of your edges are pinched, it's time to give 'em a quick dip in some hot oil to finish them off! Make sure the oil is at 375 degrees F. If the oil's not hot enough, the dough will just taste greasy and gross...and it won't crisp up. So, since your oil is hot enough, using tongs or a slotted spoon, lower a couple of disks into the hot oil (however many will fit without crowding...don't let 'em touch) and fry until deep, golden yellow, turning to get top side as well. This will crisp up the outsides and give them an awesome crunch and also finish cooking the dough on the inside. Remove to paper towel-lined plate or tray.",
      "Depending on the region in Mexico you are in, sopes are topped with anything from simply beans and shredded meat to cactus strips and crisp veggies or cheese. Use what you have...use what is in season."

      "Make the cake\nPosition a rack in the center of the oven and heat the oven to 325\u00b0F. Coat a 13x18-inch rimmed baking sheet with cooking spray.\n \nPut the chocolate and cocoa in a medium heatproof bowl, add the boiling water, and whisk to combine and melt the chocolate. Set aside to cool slightly. In a small bowl, combine the flour, baking soda, and salt.\n \nBeat the sugar and butter in a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment on medium speed until light and fluffy, 3 to 5 minutes, stopping to scrape the bowl halfway through. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Slowly add the buttermilk and vanilla-the batter will look curdled at this point. Reduce the mixer speed to low. Alternate adding the flour mixture (in 3 additions) with the chocolate mixture (in 2 additions), ending with the flour mixture. Scrape the batter into the prepared pan and tap the pan on the counter to level the batter.\n \nBake until the cake springs back when poked in the center with a finger, about 20 minutes. Cool completely in the pan on a wire rack. (Well-wrapped, the cake will keep for up to 2 days in the refrigerator, or up to 1 month in the freezer.)",
      "Make the coconut-pecan filling\nPulse the coconut and pecans in a food processor until they resemble coarse cornmeal.\n \nCombine the sugar, butter, egg yolks, evaporated milk, and vanilla in a 3-quart saucepan. Cook over medium-low heat, stirring constantly with a spoon or spatula, until the mixture is thick enough to coat the spoon and hold a trail when a finger is drawn through it, 6 to 7 minutes. Transfer to a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment and whip on high speed until cooled, fluffy, and slightly lightened in color, 6 to 10 minutes. Add the coconut-pecan mixture and beat on medium speed until combined, 1 minute more. Refrigerate until ready to use. (You can refrigerate the filling for up to 1 week.)",
      "Make the chocolate mousse\nMelt the chocolate and butter in a large bowl set in a skillet of barely simmering water. Remove from the heat and stir with a spatula to combine. Set aside to cool slightly.\n \nWhip the egg whites in a clean stand mixer fitted with a clean whisk attachment on medium-high speed to soft peaks, 1 to 2 minutes. Slowly add the sugar and continue to whip to stiff peaks, 3 to 4 minutes.\n \nIn a medium bowl, whip the cream with a whisk or electric hand mixer to medium-stiff peaks.\n \nIn a small bowl, combine the egg yolks, vanilla, and salt. Mix the egg yolk mixture into the chocolate mixture with a spatula. Fold in the whipped egg whites, then fold in the whipped cream-there shouldn't be any visible streaks.",
      "Assemble the bombes\nSet two silicone bombe molds that hold at least 5 bombes each (3-1/4-inch diameter and 1/2-cup capacity) on a 13x18-inch rimmed baking sheet.\n \nTurn the cake out onto a cutting board. Use a 3-1/8-inch round cutter to cut 10 circles from the chocolate cake. Reserve the remaining cake for another use.\n \nScoop about 1/4 cup of the mousse into each mold and smear it evenly all over the insides of the molds with the back of a small spoon. Refrigerate or freeze until set, 10 to 20 minutes. Evenly distribute the coconut-pecan filling among the molds (about 2-1/2 Tbs. each), and then gently press a cake circle into each mold. Cover with plastic wrap and freeze overnight.\n \nUnmold the frozen bombes one at a time onto a wire rack set in a rimmed baking sheet. Let sit until nearly room temperature, 2 to 3 hours.",
      "Glaze the bombes\nPut the chopped chocolate and corn syrup in a medium stainless-steel bowl. In a small saucepan, heat the cream over medium-high heat until just boiling, then pour it over the chocolate mixture and let sit for 3 minutes. Whisk gently until smooth. Transfer to a liquid measuring cup for easy pouring.\n \nPour the glaze evenly over the bombes to coat them completely. Refrigerate until set, about 2 hours. (Glaze the bombes no more than 8 hours in advance.)\n \nLet the bombes sit at room temperature for about 30 minutes before serving."

      "Pour the milk into one container and microwave it for 30 seconds, or warm it in a pan over medium heat. Make sure the milk is lukewarm ~ 110*F. Now add the sugar and dry yeast into the milk and give it a gentle stir with a wooden spoon. Cover the mix and leave it on the kitchen counter for 5 to 10 minutes. This process is called proofing and it is used to see if the yeast is active or not. If tiny bubbles appear or the mixture becomes foamy on the surface you are good to go.",
      "Put the flour and salt into a mixing bowl and stir them together. Make a well in the center and add in the yeast mix. Now mix them together and start kneading. Half way through kneading, add in melted butter. The dough must be kneaded and stretched many times, which encourages the development of flour gluten. And this makes the dough smooth and elastic. The dough will be slippery and messy at this point but just keep kneading and it will eventually form a soft and pliable dough that is easy to handle. Place the kneaded dough in a large bowl which has been oiled on all sides and has plenty of room. Cover it with a plastic wrap or a damp towel. Let it rise for at least an hour and a half in a warm place. You can also keep the dough in the fridge overnight, it will give the gluten extra time to develop and will yield better flavor.",
      "Once the dough is double in size, turn it out and punch it down, At this point you can add your flavoring. Divide your dough and shape it accordingly. You can shape it into a Cob, Flat focaccia, Crescent, a braid, even Knots or twisted.",
      "Place the pieces on the baking tray with a parchment sheet. Remember; we will be keeping the shaped breads for a second rise and it will double in size again, so do keep the gap in-between. Cover the shaped breads again with a damp kitchen towel and let it rise for another 45 minutes. Whisk an egg yolk with a spoonful of water and give your bread a gentle egg wash.",
      "Bake for 20 minutes at 200*c or until you get golden brown on top. Once the bread is done, cool it on a wire rack and lightly brush the top with melted butter. Allow it to cool a bit before slicing.",
      "Breads can be served with various sweet or savory spreads, Can be enjoyed with gravies or soups. Everyone here in my house loves Focaccia with hot tomato soup or just make a sandwich with it."
