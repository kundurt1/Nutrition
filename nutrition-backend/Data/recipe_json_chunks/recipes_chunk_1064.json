      "Vegetables -- First. I just used my mini food processor to fine chop the vegetables - saves tons of time, but you can chop them by hand if you want. In a small saucepan melt the butter and saute the onion, celery, carrot and garlic on medium heat. Don't cook them too fast, you want them to sweat slowly for about 5 minutes until they are tender.",
      "Base -- Then transfer the vegetables to a large bowl .Add in the egg, steak sauce, worcestershire, oregano, thyme, parsley, marjoram or dried oregano (both will well, I just love the fresh marjoram if you have it), salt and pepper. Mix well to combine.",
      "Bread -- In a flat pan or dish, add the milk and soak each slice of bread just for a few seconds and then squeeze out most of the milk. Add the bread slices breaking them up into the bowl. Save the milk, don't throw it out. Mix the bread crumbs inches.",
      "Meat -- Quick Note: You can use all beef for this, but I really prefer the mix. You could also, substitute turkey for the veal if you want, but - Beef, Veal and Pork are my favorites.",
      "Now, add in the meat. You can use a spoon, but honestly, I use my hands to mix everything together. You don't want to over mix as the meat can get tough.",
      "Loaf -- I prefer to free form my loaf rather than using a loaf pan, but if you want, you can use a loaf pan. If using a pan, I line it with parchment paper, but I really prefer to form mine on a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper. This way when you glaze the meat loaf you can glaze the sides as well. This is the way we always did it in the restaurant. As mentioned above, you can make 2 smaller loafs vs 1 loaf, the cooking time is all that changes.",
      "Glaze -- In a small bowl, mix the ketchup, brown sugar and cider vinegar together.",
      "Cook -- Middle shelf in a 350 degree oven. Depending on on thick you make your loaf, it should take between 50 minutes to 1 hour 15 minutes. I make mine fairly thick so it takes just about 1 hr 15 minute Bake for about 40-45 minutes and then glaze. Cook another 10-15 min and glaze one more time. Once done, remove and let rest 5 minutes before slicing.",
      "Serve -- Just slice and enjoy! As I said, sour cream and chive potatoes and pan seared green beans are my favorite with this dish."

      "Blend -- speed not too high -- until a dough ball forms. You might have to scrape down the sides once.",
      "Should it happen (and it shouldn't really) that your dough is too dry, add a teaspoon of lemon juice or vinegar. But don't add anything unless that ball refuses to form, which takes a couple of minutes.",
      "Normally it tends to be sticky when it's removed from the bowl and blades: scrape with a spatula (silicone works best) on to a floured board. As soon as you pat it into a ball with that little bit extra flour, it comes together and is perfectly easy to handle.",
      "Form into a flattish rectangular ball shape, handling it briefly and lightly.",
      "Wrap in plastic and chill in fridge, at least 30 minutes or otherwise overnight.",

      "When rolling out the pastry (flour the surface and the rolling pin) it is easiest to cut 1/3 or 1/2 off the ball of dough as it will have stiffened after chilling.",
      "Flatten it a little with the palms of your hands. Roll out thinly.",
      "Whatever you use it for, brush the raw pastry with beaten egg before baking. Also use beaten egg to patch pastry when needed.",

      "Then lower heat to medium, 350 deg F/180 deg C for the duration of the baking time.",
      "Try this pastry when making small individual meat or chicken pies -- delicious! Otherwise use for deep-dish pies.",

    "directions": [
      "You will need 3-4 baking trays to be double lined with baking paper, depending on the size of your macarons. Have these prepared before hand.",
      "You will also need to prepare a piping bag with 1cm hole in nozzle.",
      "In your electric mixer place first 2 egg whites and start whisking until frothy, about 2 minutes.",
      "While egg whites are mixing, put 150g caster sugar & 50g water in small saucepan and turn on medium heat.",
      "Start adding 40g of sugar to egg whites and let them whisk on a medium speed while sugar syrup is coming to a boil. This should only take a few minutes, you want your egg whites to be white and thick and fluffy.",
      "Once syrup is boiling, this is the time to add coloring and essence. I like to make my macarons very bright so don't be shy with the coloring.",
      "remove colored syrup from the heat and while the egg whites are still beating, slowly pour a drizzle from the syrup into the mixture until all gone. You want this to be gradual and slow but should only take about a minute.",
      "Now you leave to whisk on a medium speed until the bowl is cool again, this will take about 5-6 minutes.",
      "While your egg whites are whisking you need so comdine the almond meal & icing sugar by sifting through a sieve & into a large mixing bowl. This will break up lumps and give you a nice smooth consistancy for the perfect macaron.",
      "Mix the extra 2 egg whites into the almond meal mixture to form a smooth paste.",
      "You should now have a wonderful looking egg mixture that resembles a thick merang and is at room temperature. Spoon egg whites into almond meal mix and stir it in with a spatula. You don't have to be overly careful with \"losing air\" the mixture is quite robust at this stage and can handle a bit of rough treatment. Just make sure it is thoroughly combined.",
      "Spoon batter into piping bag and carefully pipe rounds that are about 1\" across with 2cm between as they will spread a little. This is the best size for me, I like them petit and this is how the French make them. Store bought Macarons are often too big and awkward to eat.",
      "Once you have piped them all they need to be left to \"dry out\" for a couple of hours. You know when they are ready to go in when you can gently tough the top of one and it has formed a skin, if the mixture goes onto your skin it is not ready yet.",
      "Heat your oven to 270 with a rack in the center and nothing else in the oven.",
      "Place just one tray at a time in the oven and try not to open the oven while they are cooking. It doesn't take long, my oven is exactly 12 minutes, you may have to experiment to get your perfect time as all ovens vary.",
      "Once they are ready to come out, remove the entire sheet from the tray but leave the Macarons on the paper to cool on a wire rack. Once they are completely cooled they should easily peel away from the paper.",
      "This is a recipe that I have \"tweaked\" to suit my kitchen, you may have to adjust to suit you but don't give up if the first batch don't work, they can be hit and miss even for the experts!",
      "So worth the effort.",
      "The best way to serve these delightful treats is to sandwhich together with a nice thick frosting, matching similar sized shells for best presentation, cool and serve.",
      "They will keep in your freezer in an air tight container very well too so they can be made in advance."

Drain meat in strainer that will also retain the vegetables. Mix dry ingredients together and set aside. Add in tomatoes, and water. Stir in dry ingredients and continue to stir and simmer ( 10 minute ) add beans and chopped jalapenos then let simmer on low aprox. 1 to 1 1/2 hour You can add more or less cayenne and jalapeno depending on the degree of heat desired. As the recipe is it will not be extremely hot but a little spicy. ( For a little healthier version you can use ground turkey and no fat beans but flavor will not be as rich and hardy. ) I like to put in refrigerator overnight then heat in crock pot or on stove the next day.",

You can get the spinach (baby spinach is the best) and slice the strawberries with an egg slicer and toss ahead, in the fridge -- but let the dressing sit on the counter, trust me. Then toss immediately before eating. Some time I added candied sliced almonds -- just add almond slices to a frying pan and lightly sugar the almonds, add a few drops of water to this slowly and let it cook for a few minutes. caramelizes to a crisp, sweet. Very hot, be careful. I also added the blue cheese, mentioned by other readers. also.instead of using all that sugar, I substituted some honey for the sugar instead, which helped the dressing stick to the salad. I also halved the sugar and substituted Raspberry Balsamic Vinegar for White Vinegar. Also, left out the seeds(I couldn't find them in the store some times) and used sliced almonds. Delicious."
