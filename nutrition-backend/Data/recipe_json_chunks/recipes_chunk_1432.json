Add the orzo to the butter and cook over moderately high heat, stirring often, until the orzo is golden, about 8 minutes. Add 1 cup of the hot stock mixture and cook, stirring gently, until all of the stock is absorbed. Gradually add more of the stock mixture, 1 cup at a time, and cook, stirring frequently, until the orzo is al dente and creamy but not soupy, about 20 minutes.",
      "Meanwhile, heat the olive oil in a large nonstick skillet. Add the shallot and Swiss chard stems and cook over moderately high heat, stirring occasionally, until the stems are tender and lightly browned, about 7 minutes. Add the chard leaves and cook over moderately high heat, tossing, until the leaves are wilted, about 2 minutes. Add the vinegar. Stir the chard and the Fontina and Parmesan cheeses into the risotto, season with salt and pepper and serve.",
      "Wine Recommendation: Savory Swiss chard and nutty Fontina will pair successfully with a crisp, lean Soave from Italy, such as the 1998 Bolla Tufaie Castellaro or the 1998 Anselmi San Vincenzo."

      "The Grill Make sure the grill is very hot (at least 400\u00b0) before you lay on the dough. High heat helps prevent sticking and begins cooking the crust right away, which keeps the dough from falling through the grate. Cook for 3 to 4 minutes, using tongs to check the bottom occasionally for char. Flip when the crust has nice grill marks and is fully cooked on one side but not yet crisp.",

But sweet onions such as Vidalia or Maui pair wonderfully with a fresh, bold, well-chilled white wine. Given the mint and lemon in this dish, I would go for a lively sauvignon blanc. Many California sauvignon blancs have citrus and mint flavors, mirroring the flavors precisely, and the wine is dramatic enough to stand up to the flavor of onions. A great bet: Raymond Sauvignon Blanc Reserve 2005 Napa Valley, California ($14). --Karen MacNeil"
