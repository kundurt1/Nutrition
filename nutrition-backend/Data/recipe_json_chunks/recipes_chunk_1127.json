Continue cooking until an instant read thermometer registers 250 degrees (about 15 to 20 minutes), stir in 2 tablespoons of butter until combined, and carefully pour into prepared pan without scraping the pot.",

Bring both ends of taffy back to each other to form a loop and pull, stretching your arms slightly. Twist the end if you like and bring it back to the top. Taffy may feel very soft at first, but it will begin to get harder to pull. Continue pulling until the taffy is lighter in color and has a satin-matte sheen (it will look somewhat like rope) but remains soft and pliable, about 10 minutes (temperatures and humidity may vary and take longer).",

Dust lightly with confectioners sugar, roll or stretch the taffy into a log about 3/4 inch wide, and cut into 3/4 inch long pieces. If knife becomes sticky grease knife with butter. Wrap each piece of taffy in waxed paper and store in air tight container. Taffy will stay fresh for 1 week in a container."

      "2. Melt chocolate in a medium heat-proof bowl set over pan of almost simmer water, stirring once or twice, until smooth. Remove from heat. Or melt in microwave: heat at 50% power for 2 minutes, stir, then heat another minute at 50% power. If it is not completely melted, continue heating, for 30 second increments at 50%, stirring after each time, until smooth. Be very careful not to burn it! Beat eggs and vanilla lightly in a small bowl with a fork, sprinkle coffee powder over, and stir to dissolve.",
      "3. In the bowl of a standing mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat butter at medium speed until smooth and creamy, about 5 seconds. Beat in sugars to combine, about 45 seconds, mixture will look granular. Reduce speed to low and gradually beat in egg mixture until incorporated, about 45 seconds. Add chocolate in steady stream and beat until combined, about 40 seconds. Scrape bottom and sides of bowl with a rubber spatula. With mixer at low speed, add dry ingredients and mix until just combined. Then mix in chocolate chips -- do not over beat! Cover bowl with plastic wrap and let stand at room temperature until consistency is scoop-able and fudge-like, about 30 minutes.",
      "4. Meanwhile, adjust oven racks to upper-middle and lower-middle positions, and preheat to 350 degrees F. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper. Leaving about 1 1/2 inches between balls, scoop dough onto cookie sheets using an ice-cream scoop. The balls should be about the size of golf balls.",
      "5. Bake, reversing position of baking sheets halfway through baking (from top to bottom and front to back) until edges of cookies have just begun to set, but centers are still very soft, about 10 minutes. The cookies will look like they are not done, but don't bake them any longer than this -- they will firm up as they cool.",
      "6. Cool cookies on baking sheets for about 10 minutes. If using parchment, then carefully slide the parchment with cookies onto wire racks, and let cool to room temperature."

      "Wash the oranges and lemon thoroughly. Cut the oranges into 1/8-inch slices using a mandoline, removing the seeds as you go. Stack the orange slices and cut them into quarters. Place the oranges into an 8-quart stainless steel pot. Add the lemon zest and juice and the water to the pot, set over high heat and bring to a boil, approximately 10 minutes. Once boiling, reduce the heat to maintain a rapid simmer and cook, stirring frequently, for 40 minutes or until the fruit is very soft.",
      "While the fruit is cooking, fill a large pot (at least 12-quart) 3/4 full with water, set over high heat and bring to a boil. Place 10 (8-ounce) jars and rings, canning funnel, ladle, and tongs into the boiling water and make sure the water covers the jars by at least an inch. Boil for 10 minutes. Turn off the heat, add the lids and leave everything in the pot until the marmalade is ready.",
      "Meanwhile, place a small plate in the freezer. Increase the heat under the orange mixture to return to full boil. Add the sugar and stir the mixture continually, until it reaches 222 to 223 degrees F on a deep-fry or candy thermometer, and darkens in color, approximately 15 to 20 minutes. You may need to adjust the heat in order to prevent boil over. Test the readiness of the marmalade by placing a teaspoon of the mixture onto the chilled plate and allowing it to sit for 30 seconds. Tilt the plate. The mixture should be a soft gel that moves slightly. If mixture is thin and runs easily, it is not ready.",
      "Remove jars from the water and drain on a clean towel. Place a canning funnel onto the top of 1 of the jars and ladle in the marmalade just to below the bottom of the threads of the jar. Repeat until all of the mixture has been used. The amount of marmalade may vary by 1 to 2 jars. Wipe the rims and threads of the jars with a moist paper towel and top each with a lid. Place a ring on each jar and tighten.",
      "Return the jars to the pot with boiling water, being certain that they don't touch the bottom of the pot or each other. (If you don't have a jar rack, try a round cake rack, or metal mesh basket. Even a folded kitchen towel on the pot bottom will do in a pinch.) Add additional water if necessary to cover the jars by at least an inch. Boil for 10 minutes. Using canning tongs, carefully remove the jars from the water, place in a cool dry place and allow to sit at room temperature for at least 24 hours before opening. Once open, store in the refrigerator. Unopened marmalade will last for up to 6 months."

Form 6 patties and set on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper (wax paper or foil) and just freeze; my trick for 10-15 minutes. It just firms them up quickly and makes them easier to cook.",
      "Cooking -- I like to use my grill pan, but you can use a saute pan as well. Bring to medium high heat add your burgers. They will take about 6-8 minutes on the first side, then flip and cook about 5 more minutes. You want to completely cook them because of the bacon. Top with the smoky gouda, remove from the heat and cover. The heat from the pan will melt the cheese in just a couple of minutes.",

They will take about 8-10 minutes until tender. Just stir now and then and you can reduce to medium after they have cooked a couple of minutes. Just let them simmer until tender.",
      "Serving -- Rolls, now I like to toast mine, but that is personal taste - you can if you want. Spread your bottom burger bun with some of the spicy mayo, then top with the burger, next -- some of the onions, lettuce, and (optional tomato), and finish it off with the top bun, also slathered with the spicy BBQ mayo.
