Alternatively, the alcoholic base can be made instead of purchased by using juice, sugar, fruit scraps, beer mash, or sake mash and then allowing it to ferment.",
      "To turn an alcoholic base into vinegar, pour the mixture into a wide-mouthed container, filling it three-fourths full. If using a vinegar starter, add it at this stage. Cover the open rim with cheesecloth; oxygen is vital for this part of the fermentation. Leave the top uncapped, as it needs oxygen to sour. Let stand in a dark spot at room temperature, between 68\u00b0 and 72\u00b0F/20\u00b0 and 22\u00b0C, tasting every week or so, until the vinegar is acidified to your liking, 2 to 4 months. When the acidity is where you like it, cap the bottle and continue to age at room temperature to mellow the acidity, about 6 months or so, before using. The vinegar will keep at room temperature indefinitely. If a mass forms, discard it; it is a harmless by-product of the fermentation process. Always start with good-quality ingredients. Bad wine and bland fruit do not make delicious vinegar. The same is true with beer; we avoid hoppy beers as hops can inhibit the fermentation process."

      "Light one burner to medium. Put a smoker box over the lit burner, add some of the soaked wood chips to the box, and close the grill. Adjust the heat as needed to keep the temperature at about 180\u00b0F/80\u00b0C. The wood chips should begin to smolder and release a steady stream of smoke. Put the potatoes on the grate opposite the lit burner. Cover the grill and smoke the potatoes, adjusting the heat as needed to maintain the temperature, until browned from the smoke and tender to the touch, about 2 hours. Let cool to room temperature.",

Put some of the soaked wood chips on the hot coals and put the grate on the grill. Put the potatoes on the grate opposite the fire. Cover the grill, positioning the vent on the lid on the side opposite the fire. Stick a thermometer through the vent and heat the grill to about 180\u00b0F/80\u00b0C.

In the chilled bowl, combine the egg yolks, salt, lemon juice, ramp greens, and plenty of pepper and process until all of the ingredients are fully incorporated, about 1 minute. With the food processor running, slowly pour in the grapeseed oil. The mixture should be quite thick. If not using immediately, transfer to an airtight container and refrigerate for up to 3 days.",

      "Gently press each potato between your palms to smash it slightly without breaking it up. This helps to ensure crisp edges and allows the vinaigrette to soak into the potatoes. A few at a time, add the potatoes to the hot oil and fry until crisp, about 4 minutes. Transfer the fried potatoes to the wire rack and let drain for about 1 minute. Repeat until all of the potatoes are fried.",

Let cool completely.",

If you're going to use the filling now, stir in the 1/2 cup finely chopped praline; if not, wait until you're ready to fill the Yule log. Transfer to a bowl, cover and refrigerate.

      "At 242 degrees F, with the mixer on medium speed, stand back and carefully and steadily pour the hot syrup into the bowl. Try to get the syrup between the side of the bowl and the whisk. Perfection is impossible, so ignore any spatters; don't try to stir them into the frosting. Add the vanilla and keep beating until the frosting cools to room temperature, about 5 minutes. You'll have a shiny, marshmallow frosting, which you should spread now.",
      "Remove the cake from the refrigerator. You can frost it on the cutting board and then transfer it to a serving platter or put it on the platter now. To keep the platter clean during frosting, tuck strips of parchment under the log, putting just a sliver of the parchment under the cake and leaving the lion's share to protect your platter.",
      "If the ends of the log look ragged, trim them. Using an offset spatula, table knife or the back of a spoon, swirl the frosting all over the cake in a thick layer. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour to set the frosting and firm up the filling.",
      "Sprinkle the cake with the remaining coarsely chopped praline before serving.",
      "Bringing the cake to the table is its own dramatic event, but there's no reason not to add to the drama by making it the sole event. Instead of waiting to serve the log apres dinner, have an afternoon holiday party and serve just the cake and Champagne. It's a very chic way to say Merry Christmas!",
      "And just because it's called a buche de Noel doesn't mean you can't stud it with candles and call it a birthday cake.",
      "Covered lightly and kept away from foods with strong odors, the cake will keep in the refrigerator for up to 2 days. Serve it chilled."

      "Mix the sugar with 2 tablespoons of water in a 2-quart saucepan. Heat over medium to high heat, stirring occasionally, until the mixture comes to a rolling boil. Stop stirring and cook over high heat for 5 to 10 minutes, until the sugar develops brown streaks. Swirl the pan by the handle and watch for the first sign of smoke. As soon as the caramel turns dark brown and smokes, take the pan off the heat and whisk in the heavy cream. Be careful-the mixture will steam and bubble up violently. Return the pan to the heat and bring the caramel sauce to a simmer over low heat. Add the peanut butter and salt and whisk until the sauce is very smooth, then remove the pan from the heat.",
      "In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, or in a large bowl using a hand mixer, whip the cream cheese until it is very smooth and creamy. Add the sweetened condensed milk very gradually, whipping continually and stopping to scrape down the bowl as necessary.",
      "When the milk is smoothly incorporated, and with the mixer still going, slowly pour in the cream. Add the vanilla and salt and whip on medium or high speed for 5 to 10 minutes, or until the cream holds soft peaks.",
      "Mix the peanuts and pecans together in a bowl and set aside. If the peanut butter caramel has cooled too much to pour easily, warm it gently over low heat, then transfer it to a glass measuring cup.",
      "Spread a spoonful of the whipped cream over the bottom of a 9 x 13-inch baking pan, or a similarly sized platter. (This keeps the graham crackers from sliding around.) Lay down six or more graham crackers, enough to completely fill the bottom of the pan. Lightly cover the top of the graham crackers with a quarter of the remaining whipped cream.",
      "Peel and quarter the bananas lengthwise, then chop them fine. Arrange a third of the bananas over the whipped cream. Sprinkle with 1/4 cup of the mixed nuts, and drizzle about a quarter of the peanut butter caramel sauce over the top. Make another layer with graham crackers, whipped cream, bananas, nuts, and caramel, then repeat again. (You will have three layers of crackers, whipped cream, bananas, nuts, and caramel.)",
      "Top with a final layer of crackers. Swirl the remaining whipped cream on top, sprinkle with the remaining nuts, and drizzle on the remaining peanut butter caramel sauce.",
      "Refrigerate the cake uncovered for 4 hours, or until the crackers have softened completely. This cake is best when made no more than 12 hours ahead of time. It will last 3 days, covered, in the refrigerator."

      "To bake cookies, line a half-sheet pan with parchment paper and trace two 8-inch circles on top, then flip the paper upside down. Arrange 7 portions of cookie dough within each circle, creating a daisy-like pattern. Bake until cookies have spread to fill each circle and turned thin and golden brown, with an even color from edge to center, about 20 minutes. While cookies are still hot, use a knife to gently nudge the soft dough within the bounds of the outlined circles, or trim as needed; reserve any trimmed scraps. Repeat the baking process for a total of 5 cookie sheets. The remaining dough can then be baked as individual cookies, or frozen according to the directions in the original recipe to bake at a later time.",
      "In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, combine mascarpone, heavy cream, brown sugar, liqueur, Dutch cocoa powder, instant espresso powder, vanilla extract, and salt. Mix on low speed until relatively homogeneous, then increase to medium and whip until mixture is thick enough to hold soft peaks. Taste (preferably using a cookie scrap reserved from trimming) and adjust seasoning as needed with additional salt, espresso powder, or vanilla to taste. Resume whipping on medium speed and continue whipping until cream is thick and stiff, like a frosting. Using your reserved cookie scraps, taste filling and add more salt, espresso powder, or other flavors to taste, if desired.",
      "This recipe requires an 8- by 4-inch nonreactive, loose-bottom aluminum pan; I use",
      ". The recipe can also be adapted to a nonreactive springform pan of varying dimensions, although this will require individual adjustments along the way.",
      "Place about 6 ounces (170g) of the whipped filling in the loose-bottom pan and spread it around the sides in an even layer, using an offset spatula. Nestle 1 prepared cookie sheet into the bottom of the pan, pressing gently to ensure it lies flat. (Don't worry if it happens to break or crack.) Top with about 7 1/4 ounces (205g) of prepared filling and spread into an even layer. Repeat with remaining cookies and cream, using up all the remaining cream so that the last cookie has no topping. Cover cake with foil and refrigerate for at least 6 hours and preferably no longer than 18 hours; chilling beyond this point may cause the cookie layer along the bottom to soften too much to be handled with ease.",
      "Just before serving, make a few chocolate curls by running a stick peeler down the long edge of a chocolate bar, with a sheet of wax or parchment paper placed underneath to catch the curls. This works best with milk chocolate at about 70\u00b0F (21\u00b0C); the chocolate may be too brittle at cooler temperatures and tacky when warmer. Dark chocolate can also be shaved using the same technique, but this tends to work best when the chocolate is a few degrees warmer, as it can be quite brittle for shaving even at 70\u00b0F. Whip the heavy cream until it can hold medium-soft peaks.",
      "Let the chilled icebox cake stand at room temperature a few minutes to soften the exterior layer of cream. This will take about 5 minutes at roughly 70\u00b0F (21\u00b0C), or less time in warmer weather. In cooler months, it may help to briefly wrap the pan in a kitchen towel soaked in hot tap water.",
      "When ready to unmold, place the pan on a large can of tomatoes or a similarly sized object (something tall enough to lift the icebox cake at least 4 inches from the counter, and wide enough to form a stable base). With both hands on the sides of the pan, pull downward to drop the outer ring away from the bottom. Slide an offset spatula or a wide, flat cookie spatula under the icebox cake, wiggle to loosen it from the pan, then slide your hand under and transfer the cake to a serving plate. Top with whipped cream and chocolate curls. Cut into wedges using a large chef's knife, rinsing the blade clean under hot running water between slices. Serve immediately.",
      "The exact shelf life of this cake will vary with how long it was refrigerated after assembly and before serving, as well as according to personal preference, as the cookies will begin to soften and disintegrate over time. Some may find this messy state of affairs wonderfully soft, while others may consider it mush. Likewise, when the cake is served as soon as possible, the cookies will remain quite toothsome and crisp; for some, this provides the perfect textural contrast, while for others, they may seem too hard."

Line bottom of crust with a round of wax paper, add dried beans or pie weights, and bake crust until edge is golden, about 15 minutes. Remove weights and wax paper and bake crust until bottom and side is golden, about 5 minutes longer. Let cool slightly.",

      "Add butter-flour mixture, brown sugar, granulated sugar, cinnamon, ginger, salt, allspice, and nutmeg to apples and stir to combine. Scrape apple mixture into a large, wide-bottomed pot and heat over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until apples are soft but not falling apart, about 20 minutes. Allow apples to cool slightly, then scrape into pre-baked pie crust.",
      "While apples are cooling, place granulated sugar, butter, heavy cream, corn syrup, maple syrup, bourbon, molasses, and salt in a heavy-bottomed saucepan and cook over medium heat, stirring, until ingredients are fully combined, about 2 minutes. Stop stirring, turn heat to medium high, and cook until mixture reaches 236\u00b0F on a candy thermometer, about 5 minutes. Off the heat, allow caramel to cool to 190 degrees, about 3 minutes. Mix in toasted pecans, then spoon the caramel-pecan mixture over the apples, patting and shaping to form an even coating. (If you don't want to use all the caramel pecan mixture on top of the pie, any leftovers can be spooned onto a lined baking sheet and cooled to make turtles.) Let pie cool to room temperature, then slice and serve."

If the buttercream is too cold, it can be placed over a steaming water bath or open flame for a few seconds to initiate melt; alternatively, remove 1/2 cup buttercream, melt it completely, then add it back.",
      "In either case, after warming or cooling to adjust the temperature, re-whip the buttercream for at least 3 minutes on medium-high speed before reevaluating, as it takes time for the temperature to homogenize from edge to center. The texture and consistency can continue to be adjusted as needed until the buttercream is light, fluffy, and easy to spread, with no hint of soupiness, melt, stiffness, or curdling."

Cook over medium heat, whisking constantly but not vigorously, until it begins to simmer. This will take about 6 minutes, if the process seems to be moving slowly, simply turn up the heat. When the mixture comes to a boil, set a timer and continue cooking and whisking for exactly 1 minute. This ensures the cornstarch is fully hydrated.",
      "Immediately transfer mixture to a large bowl, then whisk in the remaining milk and cream. Bearing in mind that the gelato will taste substantially less sweet once frozen, season with an additional pinch of salt, if desired. Cover and refrigerate the gelato base until cold, thick, and no warmer than 40\u00b0F, about 3 hours (this process can be sped along with an ice bath if time is of the essence; in that case, a stainless steel bowl will help cool the base even faster).",

Add the coconut oil, and continue stirring until fully melted. For fine chips that partially homogenize into the gelato, cool to about 90\u00b0F before use. For larger, chunkier pieces that remain slightly more distinct, cool to about 70\u00b0F instead. For homogenous, custom pieces that do not dissolve into the gelato, pour the warm chocolate mixture onto a sheet of parchment with a plate or cutting board underneath, and spread to your desired thickness; freeze until solid and very cold, about 15 minutes, then crumple the parchment to break the chocolate into whatever size pieces you prefer.",
      "Churn the gelato base in an ice cream maker according to the manufacturer's directions. Meanwhile, place a quart-sized container and flexible spatula in the freezer. When gelato looks fluffy and thick, add the cooled and melted chocolate, or the pre-made chocolate chips, and churn until well combined. Shut off the machine and, using the chilled spatula, scrape gelato into the chilled container. Cover with plastic wrap pressed directly against the surface of the gelato, and freeze until thick enough to scoop, about 4 hours.",
      "Gelato is typically served at about 16\u00b0F, but most American freezers run at 0\u00b0F. For the most authentic presentation, soften gelato to 16\u00b0F in the refrigerator before serving. In a squat container, like a yogurt tub or a square storage container, this will take about 45 minutes. The timing will vary substantially depending on the size, shape, and material of the container (such as a metal loaf pan or glass baking dish), so check on the gelato frequently to ensure it does not melt."

Cook for about 3 minutes, until the underside is nicely browned. Flip and cook 1 to 2 minutes more, until the second side is nicely browned. Slide the crepe out onto the towel-covered plate and repeat until all the batter is used. Brush a little bit of oil onto the pan before cooking each crepe. Cooked crepes keep well in the refrigerator for a day or so and also freeze beautifully, layered with waxed paper and tightly wrapped."

Strain the ice water into the food processor and run the processor for 5-10 seconds to bring the mixture together. If it seems a little dry add more ice water 1 tablespoon at time. The dough will resemble small pebbles and hold together when you squeeze a bit in your hand.",
      "Turn the dough out onto a floured counter into a pile. Sprinkle to the top lightly with flour. Starting at one end, use the heel of your hand to smear a small amount of dough against the counter and continue moving through the pile until you have smeared most of it into flakes of dough. Do this quickly, being sure not to work any section of dough more than once.Once all of the dough has been flattened, pile the layers up into a stack and gently press into a flattened disc.",
      "Lightly flour the countertop and roll the dough out to fit into a 9-inch deep-dish pie pan. Lay the dough in the buttered pie pan and gently press it into the pan. Trim the top edges to 1-inch past the edge of the pie dish. Fold the edge under and crimp the circumference of the dough. Let the pie dough rest in the freezer while the oven preheats.",

Once a rough paste forms, turn the food processor on and let it run for 5 minutes until the white chocolate and peanut butter form a smooth, uniform paste. Turn the food processor off and add the salt roasted peanuts. Pulse the machine 10 times to roughly chop the peanuts into the white chocolate peanut butter mixture. Put the mixture into a plastic container, cover and freeze.",

Chop the remaining white chocolate peanut butter into chunks. Put the frozen chunks into a food processor and pulse 5 times so the mixture takes on a coarse streusel-like appearance.

The condensed milk will break apart and become absorbed into the cream. Continue to whisk, about 5 minutes, until the cream begins to thicken and the caramelized condensed milk is dissolved in the cream. Pour in the remaining cream and increase the speed to medium high. Whip the mixture until the cream is at soft peaks. Turn the mixer off and fold in the remaining sandy white chocolate peanut butter. Once the inclusion is folded in pour whipped mixture into the prepared piecrust and freeze, uncovered for at lest 4 hours and preferably overnight, until firm and frozen through.",

Wearing clean rubber kitchen gloves, grasp the legs of the goose and lower it into the water, neck end first, submerging it halfway. Keep submerged for 1 minute. Lift goose, allowing excess water to drain back into pot, then transfer to a work surface. Grasp wings and submerge other half of goose, tail end first, in boiling water and keep submerged 1 minute longer. Lift goose, allowing excess water to drain back into pot, then transfer goose to work surface. Pat dry with paper towels inside and out.",

Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, partially cover, and cook at a bare simmer for 2 hours. If necessary, add additional stock or water to keep ingredients covered. Set a fine mesh strainer over a 4-cup measuring cup and strain stock, pressing down on solids with a ladle or spoon to extract all liquid. Reserve and finely chop heart and gizzard; dispose of all other solids. Skim fat off top of stock and, if necessary, add additional chicken stock or water to make 2 full cups.

Transfer goose to oven and roast for 1 1/2 hours. Remove from oven and carefully transfer V-rack with goose to a work surface. Carefully spoon or pour off all but a few tablespoons of the rendered fat in the roasting pan into a heat-safe bowl or container, being careful to leave behind any browned bits. Reserve rendered fat. Return V-rack with goose to the roasting pan and, using two wooden spoons inserted into neck and body cavities, to carefully rotate goose breast side up. Return goose to the oven and roast until skin is puffed up around breast bone and tops of thighs, and skin is browned, 1 to 1 1/2 hours longer. Remove from oven.",

You may notice some whitish growth; this is yeast and can be skimmed (or, if you're like me, you can toss the batch if you see yeast, as it can affect the flavor of the pickles).

      "Arrange cutlets on a work surface, cover with a sheet or two of plastic wrap, and pound each with a meat pounder or the bottom of a small heavy saucepan or skillet until no more than 1/4-inch thick throughout. Season lightly on one side only with salt and pepper.",

      "Lay a slice of prosciutto on top of each cutlet, sandwiching the sage leaves flat between them. Using two wooden toothpicks per cutlet, fasten the prosciutto to the cutlets (the easiest way to do this is to push the toothpicks down through the prosciutto and just into the veal, then back up through the prosciutto again, much like fastening them together with a safety pin).",
      "Pour about 1/2 cup of cornstarch into a wide, shallow bowl. Dredge the underside of each prosciutto-topped cutlet in the cornstarch, shaking off the excess.",
      "In a large skillet or saute pan, heat two tablespoons olive oil over high heat until shimmering. Add four of the cutlets, prosciutto-side up, and cook, swirling the pan occasionally, until the cutlets are lightly browned on the bottom and the last traces of pink are visible on top at the edges. Using a thin metal spatula, flip all of the cutlets prosciutto-side down, then flip them back immediately. Transfer to a clean platter. Lower heat at any time while cooking the cutlets to prevent burning.",
      "Add remaining one tablespoon olive oil to the skillet. Add remaining four veal cutlets and repeat as in Step 5, then transfer to the platter.",
      "Lower heat to medium-low and add butter and a few sprigs of sage to the skillet and cook until butter is melted. Add white wine. Bring to a simmer over medium heat, stirring and scraping up any browned bits, then continue to cook, stirring and swirling constantly, until sauce is emulsified and slightly thickened (exact time can vary significantly depending on your skillet size and burner power; increase the heat at any time if it seems to be taking too long, or lower the heat if it's reducing too quickly).",
      "Season with salt and pepper, then stir in one teaspoon of lemon juice. Taste and add another teaspoon (or more) of lemon juice, if desired. Stir in soy sauce, if using. If the sauce breaks at any point, whisk in a tablespoon or two of water to bring it back together. Discard sage sprigs. Pour sauce all over veal cutlets and serve right away."

      "Add gastrique 1 teaspoon at a time until sauce tastes nicely sharp with a clear sweet-sour character. You want to taste the gastrique but not have it clobber the sauce; too much can ruin the sauce (you may only need a 2 to 4 teaspoons to accomplish this). You will have leftover gastrique, which you can reserve for another use (it can be drizzled on grilled or roasted vegetables or used in another sauce).",

      "When the mixture reaches 165\u00b0F (74\u00b0C), transfer bowl to a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment and whip at high speed until meringue is glossy, stiff, and thick, about 5 minutes, although the time this takes will vary depending on the power of a given stand mixer.",
      "Once meringue is thick and stiff, whip heavy cream, freeze-dried blueberries, coriander, and rum or limoncello (or other fruit/spice/spirit combo) until this mixture is thick and stiff as well. This can be done by hand in a separate bowl, or on a stand mixer in the original stand mixer bowl if the meringue is transferred to another container (no need to wash the bowl or whisk attachment between uses). For the purposes of making ice cream, this step cannot be done in a food processor or blender, which will not provide adequate aeration.",
      "Using an open",
      "or flexible spatula, gently combine whipped cream and meringue, working carefully but thoroughly to ensure the mixture is well combined but not deflated. Taste and season with additional salt and/or spice as needed.",
      "Scrape ice cream into a large nonreactive container, such as a 2-quart baking dish, and cover with a layer of plastic wrap pressed directly against the surface of the ice cream. To protect the ice cream from freezer odors, cover again with a sheet of foil, or a lid if the container has one. Freeze until firm enough to scoop. The freezing time required will vary depending on the size and material of the container, but expect this to take between 6 and 8 hours. Once the ice cream is cold, scoop and serve in chilled dishes."

If a machine does not allow for temperature control, the ideal time for a given amount of batter will need to be determined individually.",
      "In a medium bowl, combine the egg whites, sugar, brown sugar, honey, hazelnut oil, water, rum or vanilla, salt, and baking soda. With a balloon whisk, mix vigorously for a full minute to ensure the baking soda is perfectly homogenized into the batter. Undermixing at this stage can produce waffle cones with a very uneven color and texture.",
      "Sift in the bread flour, and whisk until very well combined. With a flexible spatula, scrape and fold the batter several times to ensure perfect uniformity, paying particular care to the batter splashed up the sides. Rushing this step can produce waffle cones with an uneven texture. Let the batter stand 10 minutes before proceeding to the next step; if not briefly rested, the dough may be too thin, lacy, and brittle.",
      "Spritz the plates of the waffle iron with a neutral pan spray, then add approximately 1 1/4 ounces (2 tablespoons) batter onto the center. Close the iron firmly and cook until the wafer is uniformly golden brown, about 85 seconds. The exact cooking time and temperature will vary drastically from machine to machine; the idea is to find a setting and time that will cook the wafer at a gentle pace, helping drive out moisture without browning too fast. When cooked too fast, the wafer will be brittle and difficult to shape. When cooked too slow, the wafer will be pale, and may not crisp fully once cool.",
      "If the wafer seems splotchy or pale, the most common cause in an undermixed batter. Following that, uneven color can be caused by uneven heating in a poor quality machine, or by insufficient preheating. Stir the batter thoroughly, and give the machine additional time to heat. If the following wafer remains pale, increase the heat setting on the machine. Conversely, if the wafer seems burned or excessively dark, reduce the heat before making the next waffle (or else briefly unplug a machine with no dial), or try cooking the next wafer for less time.",
      "Place a hot wafer on a relatively non-conductive work surface, such as a clean kitchen towel or a cutting board. Set the waffle cone form on top, so that its tip is about 1/4 inch from the edge of the wafer, around the 10 o'clock mark. Fold the upper portion of the wafer over the form, and press firmly at the tip to create a seal. Roll the form over, working bit by bit to keep the wafer tight against the form, until you reach the outer edge. Hold the waffle cone firmly in place, seam side down, until cool enough to maintain its own shape, 30 to 45 seconds. Shaping the waffle cone is a skill, and will require a certain degree of practice to master.",
      "Place a small bowl or ramekin, preferably one with smooth, rounded edges, upside down on a work surface, and have a second, identical bowl or ramekin at the ready. Immediately after griddling, place a hot wafer over the inverted ramekin, then place the second ramekin on top and gently press to nestle the two together. If desired, the excess wafer can be shaped by hand, to create a \"frill\" around the edges. When the wafer is cool enough to hold its own shape, remove from the ramekins (if left too long, it may stick to either ramekin).",
      "As soon as the waffle cones or bowls have cooled to room temperature, immediately transfer to an airtight container. The waffle cones and bowls are extremely susceptible to the effects of humidity, and can begin softening in as little as 15 minutes if left in the open. Likewise, if stored in a container while warm, the waffle cones and bowls may steam themselves and soften. But if properly cooked and well protected from air, the cones and bowls will keep for a week or more at cool room temperature. Small sandwich-sized zip-top bags are ideal for protecting and storing the individual cones or bowls."

      ", then drizzle lightly with pistachio oil. Toss to evenly coat with oil, spread over a parchment lined half-sheet pan, and place in a cold oven. Preheat to 200\u00b0F, and dry the pistachios until they feel firm to the touch and rather hard, with a golden hue just beginning to develop here and there, about 3 hours. The timing of this process can vary dramatically depending on the accuracy of a given oven, and how much water the pistachios were able to absorb during the blanching phase, among other factors, such as freshness. The idea is to slowly and gently drive off their moisture and develop a delicately toasted flavor, rather than one that is dark or robust. Everything about the flavor of the ice cream hinges on this step, so keep a close eye on them.",
      "After toasting, cool the pistachios and then roughly chop. Combine with the milk and cream in a 3-quart saucier, and bring to a simmer over medium heat, stirring from time to time, then cover and cool to room temperature off heat. Once cool, refrigerate overnight, or up to 36 hours.",

Continue stirring and scraping until thickened and steaming hot, or around 165\u00b0F (74\u00b0C), although precision is not required in a recipe like this. Strain the ice cream base into a non-reactive container, then whisk in the Cynar, or other liqueur.",
      "Depending on the natural color of the pistachios, as well as the degree of browning developed in the toasting phase, and the intensity of the color of the yolks, the color of the ice cream base can range from army green to khaki, or outright yellow. This is perfectly normal, if not what's traditionally expected. If desired, the warm tone imparted by the toasted pistachios and egg yolks can be neutralized with a minute amount of blue gel paste. Place a single drop onto the edge of a knife, then dip the top of a whisk or spatula into the gel. Whisk or stir the base to disperse the color, and repeat as needed, stirring patiently between each addition to ensure the full color has developed. Use caution, as excess dye will produce a decidedly artificial color.",

      "Adjust oven rack to center position and preheat oven to 300\u00b0F. Pour sugar into a 9- by 13-inch glass or ceramic baking dish. Toast until the sugar turns ivory, about 1 hour. Stir thoroughly and continue roasting, pausing to stir every 30 minutes. The sugar will produce steam as a byproduct of toasting, so it must be stirred well to allow that moisture to escape. Stirring should also help move hot sugar from the edges toward the center, and cool sugar from the center toward the edges, for even toasting. Continue toasting and stirring every 30 minutes until the sugar has darkened to the desired degree, from a light beige to the color of traditional brown sugar, between 2 and 4 hours more.",
      "When the sugar has finished toasting, set aside and cool to room temperature, stirring from time to time to speed the process and allow for continued evaporation of steam. Alternatively, the cooling process can be sped along by pouring the sugar into a large, heat safe container. Once fully cool, transfer to an airtight container and store as you would plain white sugar. It can be used interchangeably, by weight or volume, in any recipe that calls for white sugar.",
      "Troubleshooting: In an oven that runs hot, or when using a different volume of sugar, or a different size baking dish, or a metal dish, the sugar will heat more rapidly, and may begin to liquify much sooner than expected. If this happens, immediately pour the dry sugar into a large stainless steel bowl, leaving the melted caramel behind. If the sugar is not stirred thoroughly throughout the toasting process, it may clump severely along the way and as it cools; should this happen, grind the cooled sugar in a food processor until powdery and fine."

Place over high heat until steaming-hot, then adjust temperature to maintain a gentle simmer. Combine egg whites, turbinado sugar, salt, cream of tartar, and vanilla seeds in the bowl of a stand mixer. Set over steaming water, stirring and scraping constantly with a flexible spatula, until egg whites reach 185\u00b0F (85\u00b0C). This should take only 10 to 12 minutes, so if mixture seems to be moving slowly, simply turn up the heat. Once ready, transfer to a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment and whip at high speed about 10 minutes, until meringue is glossy, stiff, and cool to the touch, around 90\u00b0F (32\u00b0C).",

Initially, the volume of the meringue will decrease; it may even seem soupy along the way, but as the cool butter is added, the mixture will begin to thicken and cool.

      "In the bowl of a food processor, combine flour, butter, salt, and cinnamon. Pulse until the butter disappears, about 30 seconds, then add water and continue processing until dough rides up on the blade and forms a silky but stringy dough. This will take about 2 minutes, but the timing will vary depending on the size and horsepower of the food processor. Transfer to a lightly greased bowl, cover tightly, and allow the dough to relax at least 2 hours at room temperature, or up to 24 hours at cool room temperature.",
      "In a 3-quart stainless steel saucier, whisk sugar, cornstarch, and salt until well combined. Whisk in the egg, yolk, and milk. Once smooth, place over medium-low heat and cook, whisking constantly but gently until warm to the touch, about 3 minutes. Increase heat to medium and cook, now whisking quite vigorously, until the custard begins to thicken, about 2 minute more. The custard may seem lumpy, almost like cottage cheese, but continue whisking until emulsified and silky smooth.",
      "When the thick custard begins to bubble, set a timer and continue cooking and whisking for exactly 1 minute. (This step helps neutralize a starch-dissolving enzyme found in egg yolks.) Off heat, stir in vanilla extract, lemon zest, and cinnamon. Pour the custard onto a large plate or pie dish to form a thin layer (this will speed the cooling process), then press a sheet of plastic against the surface to prevent a skin from forming. Refrigerate until thick and cool, about 1 hour, or to a temperature of 68\u00b0F. Alternatively, refrigerate the custard up to one week and then return to room temperature until warmed to approximately 68\u00b0F.",
      "In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the cool pudding until creamy and smooth (this can also be done by hand using a flexible spatula, although it may seem impossible at first). Fold in the ricotta. Refrigerate in an airtight container until needed, up to 3 days.",
      "Turn the soft dough onto a well floured surface and, using as much flour as needed to prevent sticking, roll until approximately 1/16 inch thick. Brush excess flour from the dough, then lightly brush the surface with egg white. Carefully fold the dough in half, then dust with more flour and continue rolling to 1/16 inch. Gently lift the dough to make sure it hasn't stuck, then cut into into 3 1/2-inch rounds; re-roll the scraps and cut as before.",
      "Melt the refined coconut oil (or other solid fat) in a 5-quart stainless steel or enameled Dutch oven. Clip on digital thermometer and warm to 360\u00b0F over medium heat. Meanwhile, line a baking sheet with 3 layers of paper towels, and form the shells.",
      "Lightly grease the cannoli forms with pan spray or oil, then place each onto a round of prepared dough. Wrap the dough around the cannoli form, using a bit of egg white to firmly seal the flaps together where they overlap. (The dough should be comfortably secure around the form, neither too tight, as it will make the forms difficult to remove after frying, nor too loose, as this will allow the dough to slide free.)",
      "Working with three or four at a time, carefully lower the prepared cannoli forms into the hot oil and fry until the dough is blistered and pale gold, about 2 minutes. If any sink to the bottom (due to the weight of the forms), prevent them from burning by moving the cannoli from time to time with a pair of kitchen tweezers or tongs. When golden, lift the cannoli by the shell itself (rather than the slippery forms), and transfer to a paper towel-lined baking sheet.",
      "While hot, use the kitchen tweezers or tongs to rap the tapered end of the form against the tray so the pastry shell slides free. Set the forms aside to cool, then re-use as before to form and fry the remaining dough. Cool the shells to room temperature and use immediately, or store up to 1 week in an airtight container. If using liquid fry oil, the shells cannot be prepared in advance.",
      "Transfer the prepared ricotta filling to a pastry bag fitted with a 1/2-inch plain round tip. Insert the tip of the pastry bag into a pastry shell until it reaches the middle; begin piping with steady pressure and slowly draw the tip from the tube. When you reach the edge of the shell, stop piping, then move the pastry tip away. Repeat on the opposite side, and fill the remaining cannoli shells the same way. Dip one or both ends of the filled cannoli into dishes of chopped chocolate and pistachio pieces, if desired. Enjoy immediately, or cover in plastic and refrigerate up to 4 hours (this will only work for shells fried in refined coconut oil; shells fried in liquid oil cannot be held more than a few moments)."

If you do not live in a hot, moist place, preheat the oven to its lowest setting to warm it for proofing, then turn it off. Using the floured cutters or a doughnut cutter, cut out the doughnuts and place them on the prepared tray. Be sure to give them space, as they will expand when proofing.

Place the doughnuts on the prepared cooling rack. Break one open to ensure that it is cooked, and if additional time is needed, add the doughnuts back to the oil to finish and add a bit more cooking time for the rest. Fry the rest in similar fashion, and allow all of the doughnuts to cool.",

Remove from heat and use your fingers to carefully submerge each of the doughnuts in the glaze. Place the glazed doughnuts on a clean cooling rack to dry.

This phase should take about 6 minutes; while it's natural for the timing to vary from one stovetop to the next, a significant delay may indicate the heat is too low, or that there's a problem with the thermometer (such as shallow or unsteady placement of the probe; also very common if tilting the pot to get a reading). When in doubt, weight measurements will provide a more reliable indication of the reduction's progress.",

If desired, season with an additional pinch of salt, bearing in mind the syrup will seem less sweet when frozen. Cover and refrigerate until no warmer than 40\u00b0F (4\u00b0C). Meanwhile, take note that most ice creams will benefit from an extra pinch of salt in the base to account for the added sweetness of a fruit swirl.",

Of course, cheesecake can be baked in any size or style of pan, but the volume of batter, bake temperatures, and times will require individual adjustments which have not been tested here.",
      "If using a two-piece pan, wrap the bottom piece in foil before assembly, then tear away the excess so the pan sits flat. If using a traditional cake pan, line the bottom with a parchment round (explanation and tutorial",
      "). In either case, lightly grease the pan.",
      "Add the graham cracker crumbs, melted butter, and salt to the pan, and stir with a fork until well combined. If needed, season to taste with additional salt. With your fingers, compress into an even layer along the bottom of the pan.",
      "Adjust the oven rack to the middle position and preheat to 450\u00b0F. Combine cream cheese, goat cheese, lemon juice, vanilla extract, salt, and orange flower water in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Do not add the sugar at this time. Mix on low until roughly combined, then increase to medium and cream until no lumps of cheese remain, and the mixture is perfectly smooth; about 5 minutes. Halfway through, pause to scrape the bowl and beater with a flexible spatula.",
      "Reduce speed to medium-low, add the sugar all at once, and mix only until well combined. Remove the bowl from the stand mixer and place a single-mesh sieve over the bowl, then crack in the eggs, and whisk until they pass through. Discard any clots of chalazae that remain trapped in the strainer. Resume mixing on low until well combined, then scrape the bowl and beater once more.",
      "In a 1-quart stainless steel pot, bring the cream to a full boil. While mixing on low, add the hot cream all at once in a steady stream, and mix a few seconds more. This warms the batter, which helps release any air pockets introduced in mixing while reducing the overall bake time. Use immediately, or refrigerate the batter in an airtight container until needed, up to one week. Bring cold batter to room temperature before baking.",
      "Pour batter into the prepared pan and place on a baking sheet. Bounce a spoon across the surface to dislodge any air bubbles that may have slipped through. If you don't see any, no need to continue. If you do notice a few rising up, keep bouncing the spoon until they're gone. Bake until the cheesecake is puffed and dry to the touch around the edges, about 20 minutes. In most ovens, the cheesecake will also begin to brown, forming golden patches along the surface, deepening its flavor. If needed, rotate the baking sheet to ensure even browning. Alternatively, for a denser, paler cheesecake, skip to the next step and bake only at 250\u00b0F until done; this may take an hour or more.",
      "Turn off the oven, open the door, and let it stand ajar 10 minutes. Close the door and set the oven to 250\u00b0F. Continue baking until the outer edge of the cheesecake feels firm, though the innermost ring of cheesecake will wobble quite freely if you shake the pan, about 35 minutes. This wobbly zone should be no more than 3-inches across. The cheesecake will be done when the very center registers 145\u00b0F on a digital thermometer inserted to a depth of 2-inches. Testing with a thermometer will not cause the cheesecake to crack; cracking is the result of over-baking and nothing more.",

Continue letting it cool at room temperature for at least 1 hour (or up to 4) before covering it to refrigerate until cold to the core, at least 12 hours.",

Place the pan on a large can of tomatoes or a similarly sized object; something tall enough to lift the cheesecake 4-inches from the counter, and wide enough to form a stable base. With both hands on the sides of the pan, pull downward to drop the outer ring away from the bottom. Place the cake onto a flat work surface, loosen it from the bottom of the pan with an offset spatula, and transfer to a large, flat serving plate. Cover with plastic and refrigerate until needed, up to 10 days.",
      "Loosen the sides of the cheesecake from the pan with a thin knife or offset spatula. Stand the cake in a few inches of scalding hot water until the pan feels warm (a roasting pan works well for this). Drape the cake in plastic wrap to protect its surface, then invert onto a large, flat plate, and lift the pan to pull it away. It should slide free without any resistance; if not, continue standing in hot water a few minutes more. After removing the pan, peel the parchment from the crust, and re-invert the cheesecake onto a serving plate. Cover with plastic and refrigerate until needed, up to 10 days.",
      "Combine the fresh fruit and warmed fruit syrup or jam in a large bowl, and gently fold with a flexible spatula until the fruit is well coated and glistening (optional). Cut the cheesecake with a large chef's knife dipped in hot water; for clean and tidy portions of cheesecake, pause to clean the blade under hot running water between each slice.

In a microwave-safe bowl, melt the white chocolate using three or four 15-second bursts at normal power; to prevent scorching, pause to stir the white chocolate between rounds.

When fully baked, they will still be quite pale.) Cool directly on baking sheet until crumb is set, about 5 minutes. Store in an airtight container up to 3 days at room temperature."
