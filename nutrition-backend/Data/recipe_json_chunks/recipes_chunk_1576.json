Recently I learned that this is really a Chinese condiment that the Japanese side of my family wholeheartedly embraced. My favourite way of eating it is to add 2-3 teaspoons to cold silken tofu, drizzle some sesame oil and shoyu (soy sauce) over it, and eat it as a cold, refreshing starter in the summer.",

      "Start by cooking your sausage in a skillet over medium to medium high heat. Remove from heat, and set aside in a bowl when the sausage is fully cooked through and no pink remains. Break the sausage up with a spatula during the cooking process.",
      "In the same skillet, melt half of the butter and add the diced onion, red pepper and green pepper. Cook until the peppers are softened to your liking, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and set aside in the bowl with the sausage.",
      "Again, in the same skillet, melt the remaining half of the butter and add the whisked eggs. Cook until eggs are almost set. The eggs will still be a little runny and shiny, but you'll remove the pan from the heat, and they will continue to cook. Add the cooked sausage, veggies, cheese, and black beans. Mix together and season with more salt to your liking.",
      "Now, lay an egg roll wrapper on your counter at an angle. It should look like a diamond. About 1/2 inch from the bottom corner, place 2 tablespoons of the egg mixture. Take the bottom corner of the egg roll wrapper and lift it up and over the mixture. Next, take the right corner and fold it to the center. Do the same with the left corner. Now just roll until you only have a little triangle left at the top of the egg roll wrapper. Wet the seam with water, and continue rolling.",
      "Now, comes the frying part! Let me tell you, it is not hard! I promise. Fill a saucepan with about 1 inch of vegetable oil and heat over medium heat. Once the oil reaches 325 F you can start cooking the egg rolls! I'd suggest cooking them one at a time. It should take less than 30 seconds. Flip the egg roll over and move it around a little bit to ensure even cooking. When they're done, they will be golden brown. Once golden brown, remove from the oil and set onto a paper towel to drain. Repeat cooking the rest.",
      "Serve immediately with sour cream and salsa and enjoy!",
      "Notes:",
      "1. Now I know you're probably thinking, why would I ever want to make egg rolls at 6 AM on a Monday morning? Well...you wouldn't. So make these the night before and maybe have a few for dinner! Just store the rest in an airtight container in the fridge.",
      "2. The next morning(s) just heat up as many as you want in your toaster oven or oven! I placed them directly on the rack in my toaster oven at 400 F for 10 minutes flipping them halfway through!"

Spoon in the French vanilla ice cream and mix with desired stir-ins. I used mini chocolate chipes, grated milk chocolate, dried cherries and chopped glace cherries. Mix them in. Add enough stir-ins so this ice cream is level with the other layers. This will make the bottom of the bombe smooth when it is removed from the Dutch oven. Cover with plastic wrap and freeze until smooth.",
      "Have a serving plate ready, one that is freezer safe. You can also use a 12-inch corrugated paper cake round with a waxed top for this. Before serving, remove the Dutch oven from the freezer and set it in about 2 inches of hot water. Pull on plastic wrap to see if it is loosening in the pan. When the wrap is mpoving a little, about 30 seconds, place plate over the bottom of the oven, and flip it over so the ice cream rests on the plate. Quickly remove the plastic wrap and smooth the outside of the bombe, so no lines from the plastic wrap remain. Return the bombe to the freezer.",
      "Optional: Once the exterior is frozen, it can be decorated with buttercream icing if desired. Return the bombe to the freezer until serving time. After about 1/2 hour, cover the bombe with plastic wrap until serving.",
      "To serve, remove bombe from freezer. Unwrap. Present at table (do birthday candles, etc.). Using a heavy knife, cut the bomnbe in half. Then cut one of the halves in half again. Cut slices from the 2 cut quarters, then freeze the remaining bombe. Pass the fudge sauce and whipping cream (a favorite with children), and the assorted sprinkles. Just a thought: If you serve the bombe with donut holes, you can offer your guests '\"a piece of ice cream and a scoop of cake.\""

      "When the hour is almost up, preheat oven to 350\u00b0F. Bake the tree for 25-30 minutes, until completely golden but still soft. While it bakes, start preparing the finishing items. Melt the apricot jam with a big dash of water in a small saucepan over low heat until it forms a glaze. Set it aside. Then stir the powdered sugar and orange zest together until it forms a thick icing. When the chelsea bun tree is done, brush it all over with the apricot glaze to give it a shine. Then drizzle it generously all over with the icing to look like snow and place the cherries and pistachios on top. Serve immediately and enjoy!"

      "In a large saucepan melt the butter over low heat. Then stir in the sugar and cocoa powder until smooth. Whisk in the beaten egg stirring constantly until the mixture has thickened (about 1-2 minutes). Remove from the heat and add the vanilla, graham cracker crumbs, coconut and chopped nuts. Mix together then press into an 8\" or 9\" square baking dish. Cover and chill until firm (about 30 minutes).",
      "For the middle layer:",
      "In the bowl of a stand mixer (or in a mixing bowl with a hand mixer) cream the butter. Add in the remaining middle layer ingredients and beat until light and fluffy. If the mixture is too thick, add another tablespoon of cream. Spread the filling over the bottom layer and chill until firm (about 15-20 minutes).",

Remove from heat and stir in the teaspoon of corn syrup. The corn syrup helps to make a smooth top but is optional if you don't have any. Gently spread over the filling. Put it into the refrigerator and allow it to chill until set.",
      "Notes:",
      "- If you can't find Bird's custard powder (I think World Market has it or you could order online) then you can use vanilla pudding powdered mix.",
      "- I have seen other recipes that use pecans or walnuts instead of almonds but the original bars have almonds. I just put almond slices in a food processor and it worked great.",
      "- After I spread the melted chocolate on top, I shook the pan back and forth and the chocolate smoothed nicely.",
      "- Also, you may want to score the chocolate before chilling it the last time to make cutting easier.",

Roast on a pan in the preheated oven for a good hour or so until it appears thoroughly cooked. Then remove from the oven and let it cool on the stovetop until it's pretty much back to room temperature. I always roast mine early in the day and then make the soup right before dinnertime.",

Place chunks in the processor and add just enough stock to be able to blend it into a puree. Transfer this mixture to the soup pot and continue until all squash has been used. Don't over fill the processor, work in smallish batches. When you get to the last batch, add the apple as well and blend it up.",
      "Turn the stovetop on medium and begin heating the puree. You can add as much stock as you like at this point to achieve the desired consistency, but I like to leave mine super thick, almost a puree rather than a soup. Add nutmeg and honey, as well as additional salt and pepper to taste. Leave on the heat until heated through. Just before you serve, add the heavy cream. It tastes heavenly and suprisingly, not too sweet.",
      "I have served this as a main course with crusty bread as well as in lieu of a vegetable side. I usually roast two of these at a time in fact; I will use half of the resultant puree in the manner described above and save the other half in the freezer (before adding the spices and honey/cream). That way I have the hard part done and can assemble it a second time in just a few minutes."

Lay a sheet of parchment paper inside the pan, making sure all inner sides of the pan are covered. Depending on the size of your baking pan, you may need to use two sheets, criss-crossed. You should have 1-2 inches overhanging the pan, as this will be how you pull the marshmallows out of the pan once they have set.",
      "Pour 1/2 cup of the water into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment. Add the gelatin to the water and allow to soften, about 10 minutes.",
      "In a large, deep saucepan, combine sugar, evaporated milk, and remaining 1/4 cup water. Stir over medium-heat until the sugar has dissolved. Bring the water/sugar mixture to a gentle boil. Reduce to a simmer, without stirring, and allow to cook until a candy thermometer registers 240\u00b0F, about 10-15 minutes. Make sure the heat is not too high or the mixture will burn while cooking.",
      "Carefully, add hot sugar mixture to the gelatin mixture and beat on low speed until fully incorporated. You'll note the mixture is an amber color-this is totally normal. Once it starts to get whipped, it will turn into a creamy, shiny, white-ish color.",
      "Add vanilla extract. Increase speed to high and beat until very thick and fluffy, about 10-15 minutes. The mixture will double to triple in size and will be a creamy, shiny, white-ish color. Using a rubber spatula, quickly scrape out the mixture into the baking pan lined with parchment paper. The mixture will set quickly, so try to do this as fast as possible. It will be difficult to get every last drop of the marshmallow mixture out of the mixing bowl, so just get what you can. Then, using the spatula, press the mixture down into all the corners of the pan. Finally, smooth out the top as best as you can.",
      "Using a final sheet of parchment paper, lay over the top of the mixture. Using your hands, gently press this sheet down over the top so the mixture sticks to it. This will prevent all sides of the marshmallows from getting dried out while they are setting. Allow to set (not refrigerated) for at least 8 hours, preferably overnight.",
      "After the marshmallows have set, combine the powdered sugar and cornstarch in a large bowl and whisk together. Spoon some of the mixture over the top of the marshmallows and over a cutting board. Using the overhanging parchment paper, remove the marshmallows from the pan and place onto your board. Carefully peel the paper off the marshmallows.",
      "Using a large, sharp knife, cut the marshmallows into 1-inch squares. The very edges may have dried out too much from setting overnight, so just cut them off and discard as necessary. Add the marshmallows to the powdered sugar and cornstarch mixture and dust all sides to prevent sticking.",

Or you can let them rise immediately after shaping and then refrigerate for up to 2 days, pulling them out and allowing them to come to room temperature, 30-60 minutes, before baking. Or you can let them rise immediately after shaping and then bake right away. The total time listed does not include the rising periods.

      "Measure out all ingredients and line up serving dishes before starting. This pudding comes together quickly. I use five 4-ounce mason jars with lids. You could also use a single serving bowl and serve out portions from that.",
      "In a small bowl, mix powdered sweetener and glucomannan together with a fork. This will keep the glucomannan from clumping when you mix it into hot pudding mixture. Set aside.",
      "Pour cream and coconut milk into medium saucepan. Add egg yolks and whisk well until uniform color and no strings of egg yolks appear. Add sweetener and glucomannan mixture and whisk again.",
      "Heat on medium heat, stirring frequently. You don't want it to boil! When mixture begins to bubble around the edges, reduce heat to medium-low, and keep stirring. It will take 3-5 minutes, but pudding should soon begin to thicken. Cook until pudding coats the back of the stirring spoon and little bubbles are appearing over the entire surface. Keep in mind pudding will thicken quite a bit more when it is chilled. Remove from heat.",
      "Add banana extract and stir well. Pour into serving bowl or small serving dishes. Set on wire rack until cool. After cooling, cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours before serving.",
      "Chilled pudding may be frozen and defrosted without separating or changing consistency.",

      " Recipe updated June 16, 2019 to eliminate need for tempering egg yolks. No change to ingredient list.",
      " Glucomannan can be used to thicken gravies and sauces, too. It's best to mix with another dry ingredient to keep it from clumping, or sprinkle lightly over an entire surface a little at a time. A little goes a long way.",

Let butter melt completely, and once it begins to foam lightly, reduce heat to medium-low. Stir frequently to prevent burning. Watch as butter turns from an off-white color to a gold, and then to an amber color. As this happens, you'll notice a nutty fragrance-this is when the butter has browned and should be removed from the heat. Immediately transfer browned butter to a shallow bowl, making sure to scrape the skillet to incorporate the last few browned bits . Let cool completely.",
      "Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F.",
      "Once butter has cooled completely, whisk eggs, browned butter, and coconut sugar until smooth. This should take about 3-4 minutes (beating the eggs for this amount of time will help ensure that the bread rises and maintains its structure after it has baked). Add mashed banana and vanilla extract and continue mixing for another minute, then set the wet ingredients aside.",
      "Now combine the dry ingredients. In a medium bowl, stir flours, baking soda and baking powder, and spices. Be sure that no lumps remain. Slowly add roughly 1/2 cup scoops of the dry ingredients to the wet, and stir after each addition. Next, fold in chopped walnuts until just combined.",
      "Use just a touch of oil or butter to grease an 8x5 loaf pan. Transfer batter to loaf pan and bake for 40-45 minutes, or until a toothpick poked through the center comes out clean.",
      "While bread bakes, prepare cream cheese frosting. Using a stand mixer or hand mixer, whip cream cheese and Greek yogurt until smooth. Slowly drizzle in honey and sea salt and continue to whip for another 1-2 minutes. Transfer to an airtight container (you will have just a bit leftover after you frost the bread) and set aside.",
      "Let bread cool completely before slicing. When you are ready to serve the bread, spread a thick layer of cream cheese frosting on top of the loaf and top with sliced or diced peaches. Drizzle a touch of honey on top, if you'd like.",

Prepare a standard size bread loaf pan (mine is 9x5) by lightly greasing it with cooking spray and then adding a couple of tablespoons of flour and using it to coat or flour your pan. If you want, you can also use Baker's Joy, which is a cooking spray that has flour in it.",

Take 1/2 cup of sliced almonds and 2 tablespoons of granulated sugar and place them in a nonstick skillet on medium heat. Stir until the sugar melts and coats the nuts. Do not leave the stove because once the sugar starts to melt, it can burn quickly. Have a plate or piece of aluminum foil ready to put the nuts on to cool. Place the candied nuts on top of the icing so they will stick to the top of the loaf.",

Bring a saucepan filled halfway with water to a boil then, with a small knife, cut an X through the skin on the bottom of your peach. Then when the water is boiling, add the peach and boil it for 30 to 45 seconds. Remove peach from the water with a slotted spoon. The boiling water will help loosen the skin.

Don't leave the pudding unattended or else it will burn and/or be lumpy. The cooking process won't take more than about 10-15 minutes. The time actually goes quite quickly. My pudding only took 11 well spent minutes.",

The pudding will be lumpy and will have rubbery particles from the skin. To avoid a skin forming, place the plastic wrap right against the warm pudding and up the inside of the bowl. Allow to cool completely in the refrigerator.",

      "Pour batter into prepared dish and spread evenly. Bake for 25-30 minutes or until a toothpick comes out with moist crumbs when inserted (see note below). Transfer pan to a cooling rack and let brownies cool completely before adding ganache.",
      "While brownies are cooling, make ganache. (Depending on how cool/warm your house is, I would give the brownies a 30-minute head start on cooling before proceeding to make the ganache. After about 1 1/2 hours when my ganache was ready, the brownies were still slightly warm, melting the ganache.)",

      "1. Greasing the dish: I just read in a magazine where it said that they buttered and floured their pan for brownies. Doing this made the brownies come out very easily and provided nice cuts. One might could also use some baking spray. Regardless of which you use, if you try this let me know how they turn out!",
      "2. Around 30 minutes of baking (I don't remember the exact time), my brownies were beginning to smell done. Even though the toothpick was coming out with a tiny bit of batter, I removed them anyway and they turned out perfectly! So I would recommend you do the same if you are having the same issue; it's better to have fudgy (sometimes even underdone) brownies than burnt ones!",
      "3. For the ganache: If after you stir marshmallow/cream mixture and chocolate chips together, the chocolate chips won't melt completely. Remember to stir well first. Place the bowl (if it's microwave safe) in the microwave and heat for 30 seconds in two 15-second intervals at a power level of 50. This should be enough to do the job."

      "Prepare the red velvet brownie batter first. Fill a small pot halfway with water and bring it to a gentle boil on the stove. Combine the flour, baking powder and salt in a bowl and whisk it together. Set it aside. Then combine the butter and chocolate in a heat proof bowl and set it over the simmering water. Let it melt together as you gently stir it with a heat proof rubber spatula. Once it is smooth and shiny, take the bowl off of the heat. Let it cool for a minute, then whisk in the sugar, followed by the eggs and food coloring. Lastly, whisk in the dry ingredients just until they disappear and the batter is smooth. Set the batter aside.",
      "Next, prepare the cheesecake batter. Set up a stand mixer with the paddle attachment. Combine the cream cheese and yogurt in its bowl and beat them together until smooth and fluffy. Add in the sugar and vanilla and let them get mixed in well. Then pour in each egg one at a time and let them get mixed in well too. Finish with the flour and let it all get well combined and smooth. Set the batter aside.",
      "Take the brownie batter and reserve a 1/4 cup. Pour the rest into the greased cake pan and smooth it out into a thin, even later. Pour the cheesecake batter over it into another layer. Take the reserved 1/4 cup of brownie batter and drizzle it all over the cheesecake layer. Use a butter knife to gently swirl it into the cheesecake batter. Bake the cheesecake brownies for about 30 minutes, until set and baked through. The cheesecake will just start to get golden around the edges. Take it out and let it cool for 30 minutes before releasing it from the springform pan. Sprinkle the top liberally with crystallized red sugar for some extra sparkle. Transfer it to a cake plate with a dome to seal it and let it refrigerate for at least 3 hours or up to overnight.",
      "Once it has chilled, it's time to take it out and cut out the heart shaped brownies! Grab a heart shaped cookie cutter that's about 2-3 inches wide at the widest part. Run it under the hottest water you can, then dry it with a paper towel. This helps to cut through the cheesecake cleanly. Cut out heart shaped brownies as close together as possible to yield as many brownies as you can. I got 20 out of mine, but this might vary depending on the size of your heart shaped cutter. The scraps are great to sample as you work! Serve them immediately for a sweet, romantic treat! They will also keep for a couple of days sealed in the refrigerator. Make sure they are in a single layer so that the red velvet brownies don't flake off on the pretty swirling."

      "2. Fill your pastry bag (or zip-top bag) with the almond cream and pipe into your un-baked pie shell. If you'd like you can use a small offset spatula to even out that cream into a nice even layer.",
      "3. Next, fan your pear slices over the top so that they spiral from the outer edge to the center of the pie. Sprinkle the vanilla sugar over the pears.",
      "4. Bake for 40 minutes on the center rack of your oven. You're looking for a nicely browned crust, browned pears, and puffed up filling. If the edges of your crust are browning too quickly, cover edges with tin foil and place back in oven!",
      "Note: The almond cream can be made up to 4 days in advance. Just simply place the prepared cream into an airtight container and press plastic wrap directly onto the surface before fitting with lid. Then, place in refrigerator until the day you need it. On the day of, let it come to room temperature before using.",
