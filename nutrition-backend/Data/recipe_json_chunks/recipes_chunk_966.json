      "Ginger cookies: Add 1 tablespoon ground dried ginger to the dry ingredients. For even better flavor, add 1/4 cup minced crystallized ginger to the batter by hand (this works well in addition to or in place of the ground ginger).",

Working half the dough at a time, roll it out on a lightly floured surface; the dough will absorb some flour at first but will soon become less sticky. Do not add more flour than necessary. Roll about 1/4 inch thick, and cut with cookie cutters; decorate as you like. Bake as above, reducing the cooking time to 8 to 10 minutes."

Pour the tomatillo mixture around the pork so it comes up the sides of the pork by 1 inch or so. Seal the pan tightly with foil, and place the pan in the center of the oven. Cook the pork until the internal temperature of the meat reaches 190\u00b0F and the meat is so tender that it tears easily with a fork, 2 1/2 to 3 1/2 hours.",
      "When the pork is fully cooked, carefully remove the pan from the oven. Unwrap the pork (be careful of the steam) and transfer it to a cutting board. Chop the pork into 1/2-inch chunks and shreds, discarding any large pieces of fat or tough pieces of meat. Pour the pan liquid into a large saucepan and spoon off most of the surface fat. Add the shredded meat and simmer the mixture uncovered for a few minutes to blend the flavors. Season with the cilantro, Tabasco, as well as salt and pepper to taste. The chile verde may be made up to this point 1 day ahead of serving and refrigerated overnight. Warm the chile verde over a slow simmer before serving.",
      "Serve the chile verde warm in bowls with steamed rice. Pass the sour cream, limes wedges, and a bottle of Tabasco."

      "In a large bowl, beat together the butter and sugar, 2 to 3 minutes with an electric mixer. With mixer on low speed, add eggs and yolks one at a time until incorporated. Mix in the lemon juice. The mixture will look curdled, but it will come together during the cooking process.",
      "In a medium heavy-bottomed saucepan, cook the mixture over low heat, stirring gently until it looks smooth. Increase the heat to medium and cook, stirring constantly, until the mixture thickens. This will take about 15-30 minutes. The curd is done cooking when it coats a spoon and should leave a trail if you draw a finger across the back. For best results, use a candy thermometer and cook to 170\u00b0. Do not let it come to a boil. If it does overcook and curdles, pour curd through a fine-mesh sieve when done cooking to strain out the curdled parts.",
      "Remove from the heat and stir in the zest. Transfer to a bowl and press a piece of plastic wrap over the top to prevent a skin from forming while it cools. After it cools down a bit, chill in the refrigerator; it will thicken more as it chills. If you aren't planning on using it right away, transfer to clean jars or a tightly covered container. Covered tightly, it will keep in the refrigerator for about a week and will freeze up to two months."

Pop your pie in the oven for about 35 to 40 minutes or until the pastry is puffed up and golden brown.",
