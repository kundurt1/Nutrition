      "Remove from the oven and allow to cool, then place fish in a bowl and flake with a fork.",
      "Try to keep the pieces a little chunky (as you would for crab cakes) so that you can identify the fish pieces in the burger.",

      "Preheat a nonstick frypan and coat the bottom of the pan (barely) with the canola oil.",
      "Meanwhile, form the burgers and press the outside of each burger in the remaining panko breadcrumbs and shallow fry the burgers until a light golden colour.",

      "That is why I keep cold water running, and I work near a sink.",
      "This also prevents the rice from sticking to your fingers.",

      "you have formed a circle), pull back on your mat a bit to tighten the roll.",

      "24.",

      "You want it to be round.",
      "28.",
      "After you cut it down the middle, lay out the two halves next to each other.",
      "Rinse your blade off, and I recommend brushing off the rice residue with a steel wool pad.",
      "That residue will only make it harder to cut on subsequent attempts, so I find that it is best to get rid of it completely.",
      "29.",
      "With the two halves next to each other, make 2-3 cuts across both halves -- again cutting very gently, and rinsing the blade between cuts.",
      "Obviously, more cuts produce thinner pieces.",
      "If you're a beginner, you'll probably only feel comfortable making 2 cuts -- and you'll end up with super-filling thick roll pieces.",
      "30.",
      "In a lot of sushi restaurants, they throw away the end pieces because they look bad compared to the middle pieces -- and I tend to agree.",
      "But you don't have to waste the food if you don't want to!",
      "Clearly, you can see now that there is a certain \"art\" to sushi-making.",
      "It takes some time to get very good at it.",
      "31.",
