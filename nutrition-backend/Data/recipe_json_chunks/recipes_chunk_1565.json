      "1. Preheat your oven to 350 F. Get your sheet pan(s) ready as well. For my cookies, I used a Silpat, but feel free to use parchment paper! Just watch the bottoms of your cookies.",
      "2. Next, get your mixer out and cream your room temperature butter and sugars with a paddle attachment. While your butter/sugars are creaming, sift together your flour, baking soda and salt in a medium-sized bowl. Set that bowl aside.",
      "3. Once your butter mix is light and fluffy, add your room temperature egg. Mix well and scrape down the sides of the bowl. Mix again.",
      "4. Add your zest and your lemon juice; mix and scrape bowl again.",
      "5. Lastly, on a low speed, add your flour mix into the creamed mixture and mix until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, this will make a tough cookie (and not in a good way).",
      "6. Using a 1 1/2\" ice cream scoop, scoop dough and form into balls. Feel free to use whatever you want, but keep in mind using something different will change the amount of cookies you get AND might alter the baking time.",
      "7. Put the remaining 1/4 cup vanilla sugar in a shallow bowl. Place the balls of dough in the sugar a few at a time and roll around, covering all of the surface! Place balls on the cookie sheet about 2\" apart from each other. They will flatten out.",
      "8. Once all your dough is formed into balls and covered in sugar, place cookie sheet in the oven and bake about 15 minutes. What you're looking for is a flattened out cookie, cracking on the top and slightly golden brown around the edges. This will make a chewy cookie (perfect for ice cream sandwiches). If you want them a little crispier, bake another minute or two.",
      "9. Let cool and enjoy!",
      "Adapted from Martha Stewart's \"Cookies\" book."

      "1. In a large bowl (or the bowl of your electric mixer), combine warm water, yeast, and 1/3 cup honey (do this with the dough hook if using mixer).",
      "2. Let the mixture sit about 5-10 minutes until bubbles have formed on the surface, it is frothy and you can definitely smell yeast. If this does not happen after 10 minutes you may have old or \"dead\" yeast. Start again with freshly bought yeast if this happens.",
      "3. Then add 5 cups whole wheat flour and stir (with a dough hook attachment) to combine. Let the dough set for 30 minutes, or until big, bubbly and doubled in size.",
      "4. Next, mix in 3 tablespoons melted coconut oil (or olive oil if you don't have coconut oil), ground flax seed and salt. Stir in 2 cups of all-purpose flour and mix with a dough hook gently until all the flour is combined. This all-purpose flour amount is your variable. You may need less flour, or more depending on where you live and the weather at the time. I suggest starting at 1/2 cup and adding an additions of 1/2 cup until your dough has become a ball, and is not sticking to the sides while it is mixing. If you decide to knead by hand, flour your work surface and knead it as you add in 1/2 cup increments of all-purpose flour until you've created a ball and the dough is not sticking to the counter.",
      "5. Place dough in a large greased bowl, turning once to coat the surface of the dough. Cover dough with a dishtowel. Let it rise in a warm place until doubled.",
      "6. Preheat oven to 350 F. Punch down dough, and divide into 2 loaves. Place dough into greased 9 x 5 inch loaf pans, and allow it to rise until dough has topped the pans by one inch.",
      "7. Bake at 350 F for 25 to 35 minutes. Make sure to not over bake. You want bread to be browned and hard to the touch. Lightly brush the tops of loaves with 2 tablespoons melted butter or coconut oil if you'd like when done to prevent crust from getting hard. Cool completely. Enjoy!!"

      "RECIPE NOTES:",
      "Chilled ingredients, a light touch, and the proper ingredients are crucial to making buttermilk biscuits. I prefer a soft-sided biscuit, so I place the biscuits very close together on the cookie sheet. If you prefer more of a crust on your biscuits, simply place each of the biscuits further apart from each other. If you are using a biscuit cutter to cut your dough, try to cut each biscuit as close to the other as possible. You can re-roll the dough to make additional biscuits, but it won't have the same puff as the others have; I would avoid rolling the dough out more than once.",
      "Biscuit dough freezes exceptionally well, after cutting the dough, simply place the biscuits on a cookie sheet and freeze them. After they have frozen, place them in an air-tight re-sealable bag and bake them as needed. There is no need to defrost them, just take them from freezer to oven (add a couple extra minutes onto your baking time).",
      "If you do not have White Lily flour or cake flour on hand, you can use 2 cups of bleached all-purpose flour; it won't make for a perfect biscuit, but the flavor and puff should still be there. If you plan on using all White Lily flour, simply use 2 cups plus 4 tablespoons in place of the all-purpose flour and the cake flour.",
      "PREPARATION:",
      "Center a rack in the oven and preheat the oven to 400\u00b0F / 200\u00b0C / Gas Mark 6.",
      "In a large bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, cake flour, baking powder, sugar, and sea salt. Add in the cold butter (shortening, lard, or duck fat) and toss the butter in the flour. Using your finger tips or a pastry cutter, quickly cut and rub the butter into the flour mixture until the mixture resembles pea-size pieces (or oats); it's okay if the pieces are not uniform, that is what you want.",
      "Pour in the buttermilk. Using a fork, mix everything until it just comes together (it'll look like a shaggy mess). Lightly dust a work surface with cake flour or White Lily flour. Turn the dough out, lightly dust the top with flour, and gently knead the mass until it comes together.",
      "Using a rolling pin or your hands, quickly flatten the dough out into a rectangle. Fold the short ends over the middle (like a letter) to make three layers. This is the first turn. Give the dough a quarter turn and flatten into a rectangle once again repeating the folding process. Repeat the flattening and folding once more.",
      "Shape into a rectangle 1/2-inch thick. Using the tines of a fork, dock the dough. This is entirely optional. If you are in a docking mood, go for it- if you aren't in a docking mood- simply proceed to the next step.",
      "Cut out the biscuits using a 2 to 2 1/2-inch biscuit cutter (being careful not to twist the cutter as you are cutting the biscuits) or using a sharp knife, cut the biscuits into squares.",
      "Gently move each biscuit to a parchment (or silicone mat)-lined baking sheet and place about 1-inch apart for biscuits with a crust or place the biscuits close to one another about 1/2-inch apart if you want soft edges. Lightly brush the tops of each biscuit with some milk or buttermilk.",
      "Bake for 10-15 minutes until they are tall, puffed and are blushing with a lightly golden brown color around the edges. If you intend on making smaller biscuits, check on them around 9 minutes of baking.",

Combine remaining ingredients in a small jar or other small container with a tight lid and shake until well combined. Taste the dressing; you might need to add a little more orange juice if you want it thinner or less for a thicker dressing. If you like your dressing sweet, you might want to add more sugar. If you use low-fat sour cream, use only a drop of mustard, as it will over-power the dressing. Pour the dressing over the salad, toss and serve. Enjoy!"

      "1. Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F. Place a Silpat on a baking sheet. Place three Jolly Ranchers in a group on your Silpat. (See pictures on my blog for placement). Only place 4 clusters of Jolly Ranchers on a sheet at a time, so there is enough space to place the stick in when they come out. Cook them in the preheated oven for 4 1/2 minutes. Watch them carefully because at between 4 and 5 minutes they will become completely melted and flatten out on the sheet. Depending on your oven they make take longer so it's a good idea to test one alone on a sheet before you do a bunch.",
      "2. The Jolly Ranchers will start to bubble up on the edges when they flatten out. As soon as this happens, pull your baking sheet out of the oven and place your candy stick at the bottom of the melted Jolly Ranchers. I twisted my stick so it coated it and was more secure to the Jolly Rancher. You have to do this immediately though. Leave the baking sheet on the counter. The sucker should harden in about 5 minutes. Then remove them from the sheet and place on another Silpat-lined tray. Repeat with the remaining Jolly Ranchers if desired.",
      "3. In a medium sized bowl, combine the caramels with the water. Microwave at 30-second intervals, stirring in between, until caramel is completely melted. Let the melted caramel cool for 60 seconds then dip your suckers into the caramel. Tip: You need to do this fast and put the caramel-dipped suckers back onto the Silpat immediately or else the warmth of the caramel will melt the sucker and make it bend in half.",

      "6. Fill the muffin pan with the mixture, giving each muffin a fair amount of the blueberries that are mixed into the batter. Once the pan is filled, take the filling by small amounts and place on top of each muffin. Take a wooden skewer and swirl the filling all around in the muffin mix. (I don't like to overmix at this point but I stir enough to blend the white mix with the purple filling a bit, creating a blueish/purplish effect in the end.)",

Then continue baking for another 5-10 minutes, or until lightly browned on top, for a total of 20 minutes baking time. These muffins taste best when completely cooled. I usually serve them the next day, if you can wait. That way the blueberries will have had time to sit and absorb!"

Sucanat is a diabetic-friendly sugar because when it breaks down in the body it requires a longer processing time, so the body is not flooded with sugar all once. Rather, the sugar is distributed gradually, creating NO GLUCOSE SPIKE. Insulin levels remain normal. Sucanat can be found at health food markets such as Whole Foods, Akins, etc.",

      "1 part lime juice (I always squeeze fresh)",
      "2 parts sugar ( I ALWAYS make a mint-infused simple syrup. More on that in a sec.)",
      "5 parts rum (I use a light rum, but use what you like. I keep meaning to try a dark rum; I've read it is great in a mojito.)",
      "6 parts club soda (or tonic if you prefer, but I only use club soda)",
      "Simple syrup:",
      "I use equal parts water and sugar for my simple syrup, and I crush and add a handful of mint leaves once the sugar has dissolved. I simmer it for a couple of minutes then take it off the heat and set it aside while I prep the rest of the drink. I strain out the mint leaves once it has cooled. I have used sugar in the raw as well as plain white sugar. I have a friend who uses brown sugar.",
      "The drink:",
      "I like a lot of mint, so if I was making a pitcher, I might use 30 to 40 leaves. I use a mortar/pestle to muddle the mint leaves, trying to crush them, but not make a paste out of them. In the photo above I think I used 60-80 leaves- it was a lot, that's all I'm saying.",
      "In your pitcher, put the lime juice, rum, mint and syrup. Mix well. If you don't want a lot of mint bits, you can strain out the mint now. (I leave it in, or take some out if I got too crazy with the mint.) Add club soda, pour over ice and garnish with mint.",
      "You can play with the recipe a bit if it is too limy or to rummy or whatever, but this ratio has been well received here."

      "4. A bowl for mixing the chocolate filling.",

      "Mixing the tart shell pastry (for a 10-inch tart):",
      "1. Sift the cocoa and flour together onto a sheet of waxed paper or into a bowl.",
      "2. Place the butter and sugar in the bowl of an electric mixer and beat it until it is light and fluffy. Beat in the cinnamon and vanilla.",
      "3. Beat in the sifted cocoa and flour.",
      "4. Shape the dough into a circle. If it is very soft, wrap it in waxed paper and refrigerate it for about 30 minutes. (Longer chilling will harden the dough and make it difficult to roll out.)",
      "Forming and baking the tart shell:",
      "1. Place the dough between two sheets of waxed paper and roll it out into a circle about 12-inches in diameter. Remove the top sheet of waxed paper and invert the pastry into the tart pan.",
      "2. Peel off the second sheet of waxed paper and press the dough into the bottom and up the sides of the pan. The dough is more like cookie dough than pie crust pastry and may tear, but it can easily be pressed back together and molded into the pan.",
      "3. Press the pastry firmly against the sides of the pan to help prevent shrinkage during baking. (Because of its consistency, the pastry shell can't be lined with paper and weighted down with dried beans to prevent shrinking when it is baked.)",
      "3. Chill the unbaked tart shell for 30 minutes, or until it is firm.",
      "4. While the tart chills, preheat the oven to 375 F. Prick the bottom of the chilled tart shell with a fork and bake it for about 15 minutes.",
      "5. As soon as it comes out of the oven, press the hot pastry up against the inside rim of the tart pan with the tines of a fork where the sides of the shell have collapsed a little during baking.",
      "6. Cool the tart at room temperature while making the filling.",
      "For the chocolate filling:",
      "1. Put the chopped chocolate into a large heatproof bowl.",
      "2. Heat the cream in a saucepan over medium heat until just before it is ready to boil. Then pour it over the chocolate. (The temperature to which you heat the cream isn't important. It is only important that the cream is very hot when you pour it over the chocolate.)",
      "3. Let the chocolate and hot cream sit for 3 minutes, then stir until the chocolate is melted and the mixture is smooth.",
      "4. Pour the chocolate into the shell.",
      "5. Spread the filling out smoothly in the shell, to the edges of the tart's rim.",
      "6. Refrigerate the tart for about 3 hours, or until the filling is very firm.",
      "Decorating the tart:",
      "Note: Decorate the tart right before serving it or, if decorating it in advance, keep it in a cool, dry place so that the powdered sugar doesn't become damp.",
      "1. Make a stencil: Draw or trace a simple design in the middle of a plain sheet of printing paper. The tart in the photo is decorated with a coyote. Cut around the edges of your drawing and remove it, keeping the sheet of paper intact. This is your stencil.",
      "2. Un-mold the tart by pressing up on the bottom of the pan and loosening the crust from the sides of the ring. Remove the ring and place the tart, still sitting on the circular bottom of the pan, on a flat serving tray or wherever you intend to cut it.",
      "3. Put some powdered sugar in a small strainer and sift it all over the tart.",
      "4. Place the stencil over the tart, centering the cut-out over the middle of the tart. Put cocoa in the strainer and sift it over the cut-out space in the stencil.",
      "Note: The tart may be made, but not decorated a day in advance. For photos of how to decorate the tart, please see the recipe on the diplomatickitchen's blog.",

      "1. A 14-inch round pizza pan.",
      "2. Two large bowls: one for mixing the dough and another for the rise of the dough.",
      "3. A heavy-bottomed pan with a lid for making the meat topping.",
      "4. A small bowl for mixing the herb topping.",
      "For mixing the flatbread dough:",
      "1. In a large bowl, mix the yeast with the warm milk and sugar. Let it sit for a few minutes. When the mixture is foamy, add the flour, salt, beaten egg and olive oil.",
      "2. Stir to combine everything well, and once it comes together into a ball, knead until the mixture forms a dough. Place the dough in an oiled bowl, cover it with plastic and let it rise until it has about doubled in size. (The time of the rise depends on the weather and temperature. One hour is a good estimate.)",
      "For making the meat topping:",
      "1. Slit open the sausage casings lengthwise and remove the ground meat filling. Usually the filling comes away from the casing easily.",
      "2. Heat the olive oil in the pan and saute the onion over medium heat until it begins to turn golden. Add the garlic and saute it for a minute, stirring. Add the ground Merguez sausage and brown it.",
      "3. Add the cinnamon, cumin, cloves, black pepper, sumac and sugar and mix them well with the meat, onion and garlic. Add the chopped tomatoes and their juice. Cover the pan and simmer the topping gently until the juice of the tomatoes is evaporated and the mixture has thickened.",
      "For mixing the herb topping:",
      "1. Put all the herbs and spices in a bowl and mix them together. This is an herb mixture often used in Middle Eastern recipes. If you prefer not to make it yourself, it is available prepackaged and is called: Za'atar.",
      "For assembling and baking the flatbread:",
      "1. Preheat the oven to 450 F. Oil the pizza pan.",
      "2. Roll out the dough into a circle that's a little larger than the size of the pan.",
      "3. Spread the dough out on the oiled pan and sprinkle it with 1 tablespoon of the herb topping.",
      "4. Spread the meat topping over the flatbread dough. Sprinkle the topping with the rest of the herb mixture.",
      "5. Bake the flatbread for about 15 minutes, or until it is golden. Slide it off the pan onto a cooling rack.",
      "A suggestion: The flatbread is good with a little of my Hot Cilantro ~ Parsley Chutney, which is also posted here at TastyKitchen. A little of this chutney goes a long way, even for those who like some flame in their food.",
      "Acknowledgements: Mediterranean Merguez Flatbread is adapted from Elizabeth David's recipe for Middle Eastern Lamb Pizza in her book: At Elizabeth David's Table (2011). That recipe appeared in the 'Cook the Book' feature of the website Serious Eats."

Once the egg mixture is smooth and creamy and the half-and-half is warm, carefully pour half of the warm half-and-half into the bowl with the egg mixture and quickly whisk together. This process helps temper the eggs. Whisk until the mixture is well combined. Next, pour this mixture back into the saucepan with the rest of the half-and-half.",
      "Place the pan back on the medium low heat and begin whisking to incorporate. Continue whisking the mixture until it becomes thick and creamy. If the mixture starts to simmer, lift it from the heat and keep whisking. Don't worry if it doesn't thicken up after a couple of minutes, just keep whisking! It will begin to thicken after about 4 or 5 minutes. Once the cream has thickened, add the butter to the mixture and whisk to combine. Take the cream off the heat and add the vanilla.",
      "At this point, pour the cream mixture through a fine mesh sieve or strainer into a clean bowl. If you don't have one of these, that's okay since the fruit placed over it will hide any imperfections. But straining ensures that you will have an extra smooth and creamy pastry cream. When all the cream is in the clean bowl, cover it tightly with the plastic wrap (plastic wrap should be touching the surface of the cream) and place in the refrigerator to chill for 3 to 5 hours.",

      "If using a food processor, pulse on and off while slowly adding the water. Mix until the dough comes together. Dump the dough onto a piece of plastic wrap. Form the dough into a disk, wrap with the plastic wrap and chill in the freezer for 5 minutes. While the dough is chilling, preheat your oven to 400 F.",
      "Take your tart pan and generously butter the bottom and sides. I used a 10 1/2 inch tart pan, but you can use a little bit smaller pan if you wish. Remove your dough from the freezer and dump it onto the tart pan. Using the plastic wrap or your bare fingers, mash the dough into the pan to spread evenly. Press the dough to be about 1/4 inch thick if using a 10-inch pan or thicker if you are using a smaller tart pan.",
      "Once your dough is spread out and even, gently poke the bottom of it with a fork to prevent rising. Bake covered with a sheet of foil at 400 F for 15-16 minutes. Remove from the oven and remove the cover. With a spoon, gently pat down any areas of the crust that may have puffed up. Return to oven and bake uncovered for an additional 1 to 2 minutes for a beautifully golden crust. Let the crust sit until completely cooled before assembling the tart.",
      "Next, wash and slice your fresh fruit. You can use any fruit you'd like, but for best results, use fresh seasonal fruits that have bright colors that will complement each other. You can use kiwi, strawberries and blueberries like I did or just use your favorites! Some other ideas that would look very pretty are peaches, raspberries and blueberries. I also love the look of all raspberries and blackberries placed in a checkered pattern!",
      "Once your tart crust is cooled, and your cream has been chilling for at least 3 hours, you can begin to assemble your tart. Remove your cream from the fridge and gently spoon it onto the tart crust. Spread the cream evenly and smoothly. Arrange your fruit as desired. Serve immediately or chill in the fridge until ready.",

      "*Note: The reason you need to wait before spooning hot oil over the yolks is that immediately after cracking the eggs into the pan, there is still egg white covering the yolk. If you were to spoon the hot oil over the yolk immediately, it would cause the white on the yolk to turn white, which will result in the yolk having a cloudy covering. And that's a tragic thing! On the other hand, if you wait, the egg will settle into the skillet and the whites will sheet over the sides of the yolk and eventually leave mostly yolk there. So a minute or two into the process, if you spoon the hot oil over the yolk, you won't get that cloudy appearance.",

(I fold a paper towel and hold it in my left hand, then place the egg on the towel with my right hand, then I just slide it onto the plate! You can also just keep the egg on the spatula and pat the bottom of the spatula on the paper towel to try to get most of the oil off the egg.)",

      "To the same bowl with the tomatoes, add the shallots, garlic, lemon zest, carrots, almonds, 2 pinches of salt, basil, lemon juice, and olive oil. Whisk together and set aside while you prepare the couscous.",
      "In a medium saucepan, bring the remaining 1 1/4 cups of water to a boil then add 1/4 teaspoon salt and slowly stir in the couscous. Cover the saucepan, take it off the heat, and let it rest for 5 minutes. Use a fork to fluff the couscous. Let the couscous cool, uncovered, for about 5 minutes, stirring every minute or so with a fork.",
      "Add the lentils to the bowl with the other ingredients. Add the couscous and stir to combine. Serve immediately or refrigerate for later use.",
      "Notes:",
      "1. I use extra-virgin olive oil in mine. However, if you are not used to using extra-virgin olive oil, choose your brand of olive oil wisely. If you do not like the flavor of your olive oil, the other flavors in this dish will not disguise that.",
      "2. I like tart things. I normally add 1/3 of a cup of lemon juice, which makes this dish very lemony. I think that's a good thing. Some of you, however, may want to add a smaller amount (such as 1/4 cup of lemon juice). If needed, you can add a little more after you have tasted it at the end.",
      "3. You can make this a day in advance and keep it refrigerated. If you do, I highly recommend that you use the full 1/3 cup of lemon juice because the flavors mellow a lot in the fridge.",
      "4. You can find tri-colored couscous in many supermarkets nowadays. This adds a lot of festiveness to the dish. Couscous can be usually be found in the same aisle as rice or beans (or in the ethnic aisle). In my store, it is also sold in small packages in the produce section next to the packages of sun-dried tomatoes, shallots, etc.",
      "5. Don't want to use lentils? No problem. You can use a can of black beans, rinsed and drained.",

For even baking, a wide shallow tart pan is better because a thick clafoutis is liable to overbake at the edges before the center is done. Glass or ceramic tart pans are easier to serve clafoutis from than metal ones, but metal will be alright, too, if it doesn't have a removable bottom.",
      "2. An electric mixer.",

      "5. A whisk.",

      "For the clafoutis batter:",
      "1. In a big bowl, beat the softened butter. Then add the powdered sugar and the vanilla.",
      "2. When the sugar and vanilla are well mixed into the butter, add the ground almonds and 1 of the eggs.",
      "3. In a small bowl, whisk the flour and baking powder together. In a second large bowl, beat the remaining 2 eggs and add in the flour. Gradually add the milk to this mixture. Then, put it into a 4-cup liquid measuring cup (if you have one), and gradually add the flour mixture into the butter, sugar, and almonds, mixing all the while.",
      "4. After all the milk is added, run a spatula around the sides of the bowl and then whisk the mixture to make sure everything is blended together well. If there is time, let the batter sit.",
      "For preparing the apricots and assembling the clafoutis:",
      "1. Butter the tart pan and preheat the oven to 375\u00b0F.",
      "2. Cut the apricots in half and remove the pits. Sprinkle them with the granulated sugar.",
      "3. Pour the batter into the buttered tart pan.",
      "4. Set the apricot halves in the batter, all around in the pan, cut side down.",
      "5. Bake the clafoutis for about 30 minutes. The custard will set, but the juice from the fruit may still be bubbling in a way that looks as though the clafoutis is not quite done, when in fact it is. For doneness, check an area of the custard that is not next to a piece of fruit. When the clafoutis is done, a skewer or toothpick will come out clean.",
      "6. Serve the clafoutis warm, directly from the pan.",

      "1. Either position the top rack of your oven as close to the broiler element as possible and turn on the broiler, or fire up your charcoal (or gas) grill, or turn the gas stove top element of your stove on.",
      "2. Coat each pepper with olive oil.",
      "3. If you're using the stove broiler method, place the coated peppers on the top rack and cook the peppers, turning as necessary, until they are well charred on all sides. If you are using the grill method, place the coated peppers on the grill and cook, turning as necessary, until they are well charred on all sides. After the peppers are well charred on all sides, remove them to a paper bag, fold the top of the bag over several times to seal the bag, and set the bag aside for several minutes to allow the peppers to sweat. Or, if you are using the stove top method, skewer the coated peppers (one at a time) on a long shafted fork and cook over the gas stove top element, rotating as necessary, until the pepper is well charred on all sides. As each pepper is finished charring, remove it from the fork and transfer to a paper bag, fold the top of the bag over several times to seal the bag. Repeat this process until all the peppers have been charred and are in the paper bag. Set the bag aside for several minutes (15 to 30 minutes) to allow the peppers to sweat.",
      "4. After the peppers have had several minutes to cool and sweat, remove them, one by one, from the bag and remove and discard the charred skin, the seeds and inner rib and cut the roasted peppers into strips and arrange them on a serving platter.",
      "5. After all the peppers have been transferred to the serving platter, pour marinade or dressing of your choice over the peppers and set aside to marinate or serve as is or use as required in your recipe.",
      "One of my favourite ways of enjoying roasted peppers is as a roasted red pepper sandwich on crusty Italian or French bread topped by sliced fresh mozzarella, large basil leaves, crushed garlic, Kosher salt, freshly ground black pepper, and drizzled with high quality extra-virgin olive oil."

      "4. A food processor or blender.",
      "5. 8 glasses or ramekins for serving the dessert.",
      "For the meringues (makes about 10 large meringues):",
      "Prepare meringues a day ahead because the baking time for the meringues is 6 hours, plus several more hours for cooling in the turned-off oven.",
      "1. Preheat the oven to its lowest setting. (The meringues used for this recipe baked in an oven set at 170 F.)",
      "2. Put the egg whites into a medium size bowl Beat the egg whites using your mixer until they are foamy. Continue to beat and add the sugar.",
      "3. Beat until the mixture is stiff and glossy white.",
      "4. With an ice cream scoop or a large spoon, place mounds of the meringue mixture (about 1/2 cup for each mound) on the baking sheet that you've lined with parchment paper.",
      "5. Put them in the oven and bake them for about 6 hours, or until they are hard, release easily from the papered baking sheet and sound hollow. Then turn the oven off and leave the meringues to cool in it for several hours.",
      "6. Store the meringues in a sealed container lined with paper towels. They prefer being in a cool place.",
      "For preparing the Eton Mess:",
      "The strawberries may be cut and pureed in advance; the cream should be whipped and everything mixed together right before it's time to serve the dessert.",
      "1. Chop half of the berries and put them in a bowl with 1 tablespoon of the sugar. Set aside.",
      "2. Puree the other half of the strawberries with 1 tablespoon of sugar in a blender or food processor. Reserve 4 tablespoons of the strawberry puree in a small bowl. Set both containers of puree aside.",
      "3. Crumble 8 meringues into a bowl. If, because of the weather or a tricky oven, some of the meringues' centers are a bit sticky, remove that part, and use the dry part.",
      "4. When it is time to serve the dessert, whip the cream in a large bowl until it forms floppy waves and peaks that don't move around the bowl easily but, at the same time, aren't stiff. Whip a little more and add 2 tablespoons of sugar (2 tablespoons of sugar will result in a lightly sweetened cream-add a little more for a sweeter one).",
      "5. Into the whipped cream, add the crumbled meringues and the chopped berries with their juice and fold them around in the cream-in a desultory or haphazard fashion. Do the same with all but the reserved 4 tablespoons of the strawberry puree. The dessert should be streaky with fruit and cream ... not homogeneous.",
      "6. If you are decorating the desserts with whole fresh strawberries, remove the stems, cut them in half or in quarters, almost all the way through, and open them out with your fingers. Divide the Eton Mess between the serving glasses or ramekins, tip a little of the reserved strawberry puree over each with a small spoon, and decorate with the fresh strawberries.",
      "Note: In the photo, all the puree has been folded into the Eton Mess. Photos of the Eton Mess served in glasses with some of the strawberry puree spooned over them are on the related blog link."

      "Into the bowl of your Kitchen Aid mixer or food processor add the quinoa flour, spelt flour, tapioca starch, hazelnut flour, salt and pepper and pulse or mix until they are well combined. I used my KitchenAid and the round whisk attachment to make the crust. Begin slowly cutting in the chilled butter, a few tablespoons at a time. Once all of the butter is in, the mixture should have small beads the size of a pea. Begin adding the ice water a tablespoon at a time, continuing to mix until you've added it all. Once all of the water is well incorporated, turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface, and knead the dough just a few times. Press the dough into a thick disk shape, then wrap the dough tightly in plastic wrap. Allow the dough to sit at least one hour in the refrigerator.",
      "For the beet and sweet potato topping:",
      "Preheat the oven to 375 F. Wash and peel the beets and sweet potato. Cut them about 1/4\" to 1/2\" thick. Drizzle them lightly with 1 tablespoon of olive oil and some salt. Lay the pieces flat on a lightly oiled cookie sheet. Bake for about 12 minutes, then check on the vegetables. The sweet potato should be about done. If this is the case, remove the sweet potato pieces from the pan and allow the beets to bake another 10 to 15 minutes. You want all veggies to be soft, but not crispy. Once the beets are ready, remove the pan from oven and set aside.",
      "For the filling:",
      "While the beets and sweet potato are roasting in the oven, heat the two tablespoons of olive oil in a medium skillet over medium heat. Add the onion and saute 2 minutes before adding the garlic and fennel. Saute about 3 minutes before adding a tablespoon of balsamic vinegar. Wait until the vinegar is mostly absorbed and add another tablespoon of balsamic vinegar. Again, wait until mostly absorbed, another 4 or 5 minutes, and add the tablespoon of red wine. Continue to saute until everything is soft and the liquid has almost completely evaporated and is coating the mixture. Set aside until you are ready to put everything together.",
      "To assemble the tart:",
      "Take the tart dough out of the refrigerator, unwrap it and transfer it to a floured work surface. Roll the dough into a circle shape about 1/4\" thick, making sure it's the right size to fit over your tart dish. Note: You don't put it into the dish yet. I didn't have any extra dough and it all fit very nicely into an 8\" tart dish. The recipe I followed said to refrigerate the dough again for another 30 minutes. I skipped this step. Prick the dough lightly with a fork and keep it on your work surface for a moment.",
      "Heat the oven to 375 F. Lay the beet and sweet potato pieces in the bottom of the tart mold, ensure they're tightly packed. Overlapping is perfectly acceptable and recommended so that the whole top of the tart will be covered with the beautiful roots. Spread the carmelized onion and fennel mixture evenly over the beet and sweet potato slices and press down with a fork. If you choose to add shredded cheese, sprinkle it over the onion mixture. Lay the tart dough on top of everything and use your fingers to ensure the dough is spread all the way to the edges of the tart mold. If you have extra dough, simply trim it off and make something wonderful with it later. Press down firmly on the dough to ensure all ingredients are nestled together. Bake in the oven for 35 to 40 minutes, until the crust is golden brown and flaky. Then remove from oven.",
      "Allow the tart to cool about 15-20 minutes before inverting it onto a large serving plate. Use a sharp knife to cut slices."

When hot, spray the waffle iron (both the top and bottom grates) with some cooking spray and add some dough to the waffle iron. How much? I have no idea. I've never measured it. The amount to add depends on the size of your waffle maker anyway. Add some dough and try to spread it out as thinly as you can, which will be somewhat difficult. Using two forks to help spread the dough helps a lot. Work quickly and then close the lid. With all of the sugar in these, they can burn easily so be sure to watch the waffles when you cook them.",
      "When the waffles are nice and brown, remove them from the waffle iron. Be careful-the sugar gets really hot and makes the waffles prone to sticking. They should be nice and crispy. No need to add butter or syrup. In Belgium, liege waffles are a common street food. They are wrapped in a paper napkin and people eat them on the go.",
      "Note: don't want to go through all of the trouble of getting pearl sugar? Buy some sugar cubes instead. Use a sharp knife to cut the sugar cubes in half then cut each half into four pieces. Don't get the pieces too big or too small or you will affect the texture of the dough."

Add the butter and remaining milk (1/2 cup) and mix on low speed until combined, then beat on medium speed for 1-2 minutes. Add the egg white mixture, in 3 separate batches, beating for 20 seconds after every batch, making sure to scrape down the sides of the bowl. Your batter should look smooth. If it curdles it means you had too much liquid in the batter. I don't know if it will work adding just a little more flour, like 1-2 tablespoons, because it never happened to me, but you can give it a try if you have a curdled batter.",
      "Divide the batter equally into 4 separate bowls. You can do this using a kitchen scale. I don't have one yet, so I just divided it using a large ice cream scoop. It is important to have equal amounts of batter to make sure your layers will be equal in thickness when baked.",
      "Put one drop of pink food coloring in the first bowl, one pink plus one purple in the second, 2 purple drops in the third, and 3 drops of purple in the fourth. Mix each bowl well, with different spoons/forks/spatulas. You can do this using whatever colors and combination you want. This is a fun cake to make!",
      "Bake the 4 different colored batches of batter. You can bake more layers if you like, and have a higher cake, it would be awesome! I put two pans at once in the oven, on the same rack, in the middle of the oven. Bake for 16 minutes. Baking time depends on your oven as well, so make sure to check them around minute 14. At this point, if you insert a toothpick into the center and it comes out clean, it's done. It can be 15, 16 or 17 minutes. Is important not to over bake, and this is easy to do, because the layers are quite thin. So keep a watchful eye on them.",
      "After baking the first two layers, let them cool in the pans, then delicately take them out of the pans. The layers are thin and very delicate. The colder they are the easier it will be to take them out. Parchment paper helps you a lot in this step, so it is important to use it. Put the cakes on a wire rack to cool completely.",
      "Wash the pans, then dry, butter and line them with parchment paper. Follow the above instructions with the remaining 2 bowls of batter and bake the other two layers. When done, let them cool too, and here you have 4 beautiful different colored cake layers.",
      "For the frosting:",
      "Whip the heavy whipping cream using and electric mixer, using the wire whip attachment, until you have stiff peaks. Put it aside in a bowl. In the same bowl of the electrical mixer beat the cream cheese using the paddle attachment, on medium speed, until fluffy. Add the confectioners' sugar gradually into the cream cheese, and then add the vanilla, and beat on medium (4 on my KitchenAid) for 7-10 minutes, until light and fluffy. Fold in the whipped cream and mix well.",
      "I love cream cheese frosting, but I wanted it to be a little more light and airy, so I thought of combining it with whipped cream, and this is now my favorite cake frosting! It will work great on cupcakes as well, I can't wait to try!",
      "Place the darkest lavender colored cake layer (the one with 3 drops of coloring) on the cake stand, or serving platter you will use for the cake. Using the same ice cream scoop place two dollops of the frosting in the middle of the layer, and spread evenly using a spatula.",
      "Place the cake layer with two purple coloring drops on top, spread with another 2 dollops of frosting, then add the cake with pink and purple coloring and spread with frosting. Finally add the last pink layer on top. Frost the whole cake with a thin layer of cream cheese frosting, to crumble coat it. This will ensure that no cake crumbs will get into your final layer of frosting, and have a perfect result. Place in fridge for 30 minutes to set. You can then finish frosting it with the remaining cream frosting."

The sugar will start to boil and then will start to slowly turn color on you, first into a pale amber, and escalating into a medium, dark color. Note: once you hit the pale stage, DON'T WALK AWAY FROM IT, because it will jump into medium and then dark very, very fast and there is nothing more horrible than BURNED sugar! So make sure you are on top of it at all times. When you see it turn into a dark rich color, remove from heat and pour into the baking dish.",

      "Pour the custard mixture into the baking dish that you coated with the caramel. I like the specks of the lime peel, but if you don't, you can strain the custard before it goes into the baking dish.",

Tip: if you squeeze the previous peeled lime into the water, the pot you are using will not turn black during the baking process.",

To do this, divide the paste into 4 pieces, and use your hands to roll each piece out into a long, thin rope about 18 inches long. Using a sharp knife, cut each rope into six 3 inch pieces, so you have 24 segments total. Form 12 crosses by pressing two segments together in the center. Set the crosses aside, covered with a slightly damp cloth so the paste doesn't dry out while you form the buns.",

I use a 12-count cupcake pan for this recipe. The cake also bakes faster when it's smaller in cupcake form instead of a larger cake. I use really cheap baking liners because I end up throwing them away. However, you can liberally grease the pan, or use silicone baking cups if you prefer to not use paper liners.",

Stir the buttercream into the cake crumbs until the crumbs have \"soaked\" up all the frosting and the mixture can hold together. If the mixture doesn't hold together, add more buttercream. Be sure not to add too much frosting. You don't want the frosting to be too wet, it just needs to be moist enough that you are able to make a ball and it sticks together. If you do have any frosting left over, you can place it in a sealed container in the refrigerator and use it for later use.",
      "To make the cake balls, roll small round balls, a little smaller than the size of a golf ball, out of the cake and frosting mixture. Place the cake balls on a baking sheet. Once you have finished creating all the cake balls, place the baking sheet in the refrigerator to firm up the cake balls (no longer than 15 minutes).",
      "While the cake balls are in the refrigerator, melt the candy coating. Place the candy coating in a heatproof bowl and set it over a pot of simmering water. Stir the candy coating until they have completely melted and are smooth. Remove the bowl from the pot and place it on the counter. If using different colors, you can melt them all at once over different pots of simmering water, or you can melt them one-after-another using the same pot of water. Just be sure to cover the melted candy coating with a sheet of foil to keep it warm and melted while you melt the remaining colors.",
      "Now you are ready to create your cake lollipops. Remove the cake balls from the refrigerator and place the tray next to your bowl(s) of melted candy coating. Also place the lollipop sticks and styrofoam next to everything. I think it's easiest to create an assembly line on the counter: lollipop sticks, cake balls, melted candy coating and Styrofoam.",
      "To make the cake lollipops, stick the end of a lollipop stick into the melted candy coating (abut 1/4 inch up). Place the stick into the bottom of the cake ball (the flatter, bottom side where it was placed on the baking sheet). Dunk the cake lollipops into the candy coating until the cake ball is fully covered in the candy coating. Turn the cake lollipop right side up and carefully tap the excess candy coating off of the cake lollipop. Place the cake lollipop stick into the block of styrofoam to harden. If you are adding sprinkles to your cake lollipop, sprinkle them over the top of the cake pop before placing it on the styrofoam. Or if you want to add decoration like I did, leave them plain.",
      "Finish with the rest of the cake lollipops. Allow them to completely harden before decorating. To decorate the cake lollipops like I did, use a little dot of candy coating to press on the flower sprinkles. To cover the top of the cake lollipop with sprinkles, dip the top of the pop into the melted candy coating and then immediately into the sanding sugar/sprinkles.",
      "To serve, place the lollipops in a short cup, mug or bowl. Or just lay them on a plate. These last up to 7 days in a sealed container. Enjoy!",

      "Wash about 10 pounds of beets very well with a vegetable brush under cold running water to remove all remaining garden dirt. Do not peel or cut off the tails; leave about an inch of stem. The skins, tops and tails will slip off later when they are cooked.",
      "Place beets in a large stock pot and cover with cold water. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to keep at a gentle boil for about 1 hour or a little longer if the beets are very large. I prefer to use the small tender ones that cook quickly and evenly.",
      "At this point, you have 1 hour to put your washed bottles (I like to use wide-mouthed 1-pint jars) in a pot of simmering water, the lids and rings in another pot, and to prepare the brine (see directions below). Be sure that you keep everything you use in a sterile condition.",
      "When the cooking time is up, carefully place the hot pot in the sink and run cold water in until the beets are just cool enough to handle (better that they are on the hot side to maintain a level of sterilization).",
      "Note: do not assembly line this job. You must work one jar at a time to keep things hot and clean. WORK QUICKLY.",
      "Place 4 whole cloves in the bottom of the jar, then slide beets out of their skins by rubbing gently in your fingers. Drop beets into the jar. If the beets are tiny, they can go in whole. Otherwise, cut them into bite-size pieces. When the jar is full to within 1 inch of the top, pour on the boiling hot brine to just cover the beets. Wipe the jar rim with a clean damp paper towel and cover with a sterile cap and ring. Tighten the ring and set jar aside to cool.",
      "Repeat the above step until you are out of beets. As the jars cool, you should be able to hear them pop and seal. Any that don't seal must be refrigerated and eaten within a couple of months.",
      "To prepare the brine, combine white vinegar, 1 cup water, and sugar. Bring to a rolling boil. After sugar is dissolved, reduce heat but keep at a low boil in a covered pot. I have an large old Corningware coffee pot that I keep for this job. It has a spout and a handle, so it's easy to pour boiling liquid.",
      "A few tips:",
      "1. Fresh beets from the farmer's market in the sumer give the best results. Ones that have been in storage for half the year are tough and fibrous.",
      "2. Clean up your work space beforehand so nothing is in your way.",
      "3. Have everything you need washed and ready to use.",
      "4. Cut a little stack of paper towels in quarters. Use a fresh piece to wipe each jar rim and have a bowl of water beside them to dampen them.",
      "5. If you wear a pair of good-fitting surgical gloves to peel the beets, you wont have purple fingers for three days after.",
      "6. Have your whole cloves on a small plate ready to use when needed."

On the outside sections, cut diagonal strips that are about 1/2 inch wide. Cut small slits on the creases at the top and bottom of the pastry. Spread half of the filling in the center of each pastry sheet, leaving room on the ends. Fold the top and bottom of the pastry over the filling, and start folding the strips over the filling, alternating between the left and right side. Make sure there are no gaps. Cut the wings off the corners and pinch to seal. Press any seams together to minimize filling leakage.",

    "ingredients": [],

      "You will also need:",
      "1. A food processor (useful, but not essential)",
      "2. A stove-top grill with a flat-surface griddle side or a heavy, flat-bottomed pan",
      "3. A cotton towel on which to arrange the unbaked tortilla rounds and another for stacking the baked rounds",
      "4. A rolling pin and pastry board",
      "For the tortilla dough:",
      "1. Put the flour, salt and butter in the processor and blend it using the processor's sharp blade. (Alternatively, rub the butter into the flour and salt by hand.)",
      "2. When the mixture becomes fine and is well-combined, slowly add warm water by pouring it through the tube while the processor is still on. (Alternatively, stir the water into the mixture.)",
      "3. Continue to mix in the processor until the dough pulls away from the sides and forms a ball. (Or form the ball by hand.)",
      "4. Turn the dough out on a pastry board sprinkled with a little flour and knead it into a flexible ball. The dough is not very sticky and is easy to handle.",
      "5. If you do not want to make the tortillas right away, chill the dough, wrapped in waxed paper. The dough also may be used at once, even without chilling.",
      "To form and bake the tortillas (the steps are described using a griddle, but are essentially the same using a heavy-bottomed pan):",
      "1. Form the dough into a log. Cut the log into 8 pieces of roughly equal size. Then roll the pieces into balls.",
      "2. Heat the stovetop grill (smooth, griddle-side up) over medium heat while you roll out the balls. Roll each ball out into a circle between 6 and 7 inches in diameter. When it becomes difficult to roll the round out any larger without losing the circular shape, the round is large enough. Each tortilla is stretched by hand to make it thinner right before baking on the griddle.",
      "3. Roll out and place all the tortillas on a cotton towel before beginning to bake them. The unbaked rounds may overlap on the towel, but shouldn't be stacked since this may cause them to stick together.",
      "4. The griddle should be very hot. Leave the burners' temperature at medium heat as you bake the tortillas over them. Rub a little vegetable oil on the griddle once, before you begin, with a brush or paper towel-only once or even not at all. (Griddles vary and tortillas bake better on some of them with a preliminary and very thin swipe of oil across the griddle surface.)",
      "5. Take up a tortilla in both hands and stretch it out gently in all directions with your fingers. Place it on the griddle. In about 30 seconds, bubbles will appear on the surface of the tortilla.",
      "6. Once the bubbles appear, flip the round over. As tortillas bake, they whiten and lose their yellowish tinge. Press down on the tortilla with a spatula, especially on any uncooked spots, to hasten the baking. The tortilla will appear to inflate a bit.",
      "7. Turn it once more and look for raw-looking edges or spots. If there are any, press them out briefly and transfer the tortilla to a cotton towel. The finished tortillas should still be flexible and soft. Cover them lightly in a towel to keep them warm and prevent them from drying out, or becoming damp from the trapped heat."

      "4. Grease all around the inside of a large bowl. Plop the dough into the greased bowl and cover with plastic wrap and a dishtowel. Set aside in a warm, shaded place for one hour. Note: I found heating my oven to 200 F and then turning it off right as I set the dough in it to rise, really helped. The yeast will be all happy and warm and fed and start working to grow the dough. It should almost double in size after an hour. When it's ready, when you poke it the indentations stay set.",

      "9. Take the slightly larger piece and roll it out so that it is big enough to wrap around the cinnamon roll. Wrap it around the cinnamon roll and shape it into a ball. Really press together the seams at the bottom so that it won't open up during baking.",
      "10. Roll the next (medium-sized) piece of dough into a little ball to make the head.",
      "11. Roll the smaller pieces into two ears, I found leaving the ends pointy helped to make it look more bunny-esque.",
      "12. Wet the top of the body (the cinnamon roll ball) slightly with water and lay the bunny ears over, this helps them stick to the body. Then place the head in front of the ears.",
      "13. Then, right where the nose would be, poke a plain, natural toothpick through to hold the head/ears/body together. Repeat this for the remaining 6 Bunnies. (Be sure to warn eaters of the toothpick!)",
      "14. Line a baking sheet with a Silpat, or other non-stick surface, and arrange the bunnies with room between them. Let them sit in a warm, dry place to proof for another 30-45 minutes. And preheat your oven to 350 F during this time.",
      "15. Before putting your bunnies in the oven, check to be sure no ears or heads have gone astray. Using a little water on your finger can help smooth out any bunny issues.",

      "Rub 1/2 tablespoon of butter on the bottom and sides of an 8\" cake pan. I use a dark, nonstick cake pan because it browns the bottoms of the rolls better than a lighter pan. Evenly space 7 frozen dinner roll dough balls around the outer edge of the cake pan and one dough ball in the middle. None of the dough balls should be touching the sides of the pan nor each other. This will allow the rolls enough room to rise properly.",
      "Spray each dough ball lightly with cooking spray. Cover the pan with plastic wrap and set in a warm place to allow the dough to rise until doubled. If you follow the thawing instructions on the package, this can take 3 to 5 hours if starting with frozen dough. Alternatively, you can prepare everything as indicated above in the morning. Spray the dough balls with cooking spray, cover the pan, and keep it the refrigerator. About 60 to 90 minutes before serving the rolls that evening, remove the pan from the refrigerator and allow the dough to warm up and finish rising. Then, proceed with the baking instructions below.",
      "Baking instructions:",
      "When the rolls have nearly doubled in size, adjust your oven rack to the center position. Preheat the oven to 350F. When the rolls have fully risen, melt one tablespoon of butter in the microwave. Remove the plastic wrap from the dinner rolls and brush them with the melted butter. Put the rolls in the oven and bake for about 18 to 20 minutes or until the rolls are deep brown.",
      "A few minutes before the rolls have finished baking, melt 4 tablespoons of butter over medium heat in a small saucepan. As soon as the butter has melted, add the garlic and stir it constantly. Make sure the pan does not get too hot or the garlic will brown and turn bitter. Adjust the heat as needed. The garlic should be very gently sauteed in the butter. After 30 to 60 seconds, remove the garlic butter to a serving bowl and add the parsley, then stir. The longer you saute the garlic, the less pungent it will be. Grate some parmesan and add it to a separate serving dish.",
      "To serve, add one or two hot rolls to individual serving plates then drizzle the rolls with some of the garlic butter. Sprinkle each roll with some parmesan cheese. Serve with apologies. They're delicious but far from figure-friendly!",
      "What to Expect with Method #1:",
      "1. The bottoms of the rolls will brown nicely but will not be butter-soaked like in Method #2.",
      "2. This method is better for those who do not like an intense garlic flavor. Not only is the garlic less pungent when using this method, you can control how much garlic goes on each roll.",
      "3. Your guests or family members can control how much butter to add to each roll. This is especially nice for those who are watching their calories or fat intake.",
      "4. I think this method has a better presentation for formal occasions.",
