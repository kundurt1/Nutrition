      "Custard: Pour 2 1/2 cups of the water, the sugar, corn syrup and cocoa powder into a large non-reactive saucepan and bring to a boil over medium-high heat, whisking occasionally. Meanwhile, in a small bowl, whisk the remaining 1/2 cup of water and the cornstarch. Whisk into the cocoa mixture in the saucepan and return the mixture to a boil, whisking constantly. Cook, whisking constantly, until very thick, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the butter and vanilla. Pour into a bowl. Cover with plastic wrap, lightly pressing the plastic against the surface to prevent a skin from forming. Chill until firm, about 45 minutes.",
      "To finish the cake, place a cake layer on a cake plate or serving platter (reserving the most even layer for the top) and spread with cooled custard. Top with another layer of cake, then custard, then the final layer of cake. Cover the top and sides of the cake with the remaining custard. Coat the cake with the cake crumbs. Chill until ready to serve, at least 2 hours. Serve the same day."

      "Modern canning instructions would now call for these to be processed in a water bath for 10 minutes. I do not. If the odd jar doesn't seal I refrigerate it and use it first. In a cool dark place these pickles will keep a long time (I usually make a 2 year supply) Time and servings guestimated."

Remove from heat and stir in graham crumbs, coconut and walnuts. Pack very firmly into a greased 9x9\" pan. (Do NOT, I repeat, NOT, dump a beaten egg into a pot of boiling liquid. Unless you like scrambled eggs in your pastry. Instead, beat the egg in a small bowl and then add a tablespoon or two of the cocoa mixture to the egg and whisk well, then add the egg mixture into the chocolate mix and stir. Also, once this mixture is in the pan, chill it for about half an hour before making the middle layer - this will prevent the bottom layer from blending with the frosting and making it all lumpy.).",
      "Middle Layer: Combine second amount of butter, milk, flavouring and icing sugar in a bowl. Beat together well. Tint a pretty shade of green. Spread over first layer. (Regular Nanaimo bars call for the same amounts of milk, butter and sugar, but omit the [liquid] colouring and flavouring, and have the addition of 2 tablespoons of vanilla custard powder. This means that the mint filling is considerably softer than the regular. To prevent this, add an additional 1/4 cup of icing sugar, otherwise this layer may never firm up and will squish and ooze when the squares are cut. And as with the first layer, chill this before you add the top layer or the mint layer will melt and blend with the chocolate topping.).",
      "Top layer: Melt chips and third amount of butter in a saucepan over low heat. Spread over second layer. Chill and store in refrigerator. (This amount of chocolate IN NO WAY makes enough to properly cover a 9\" square pan. It creates a thin, miserly little layer that doesn't look anything at all like the amount there should be based on the accompanying photographs. I'd go for a cup of chocolate, possibly double the original amount. Also - let the chocolate firm up at room temperature and cut as soon as it's firm. If you chill this first, and then try to cut it, the chocolate will get hard and crack and you'll have an ugly ol' mess like I did.)."

      "FOR THE PASTRY: Make a well in the flour. Add the cornstarch. Cut the butter in 1 1/2 Tablespoon chunks. Add the salt. Mash the butter into the flour with your fingers until the particles of butter are the size of whole macadamia nuts.",
      "Mix in the ice water, 1 Tablespoon at a time, introducing it with your fingertips. Press the small balls of dough that will form into a large one. With the heel of your hand, lightly push the ball of dough forward into large pieces and then gather it into a ball. Shape into a rectangle 6 1/2 inches by 4 1/2 inches. Refrigerate for 1 hour, preferably in the vegetable crisper.",
      "Roll the dough 6 inches away from you and then 6 inches toward you, keeping it 6 1/2 inches wide and never less that 1/3 inch thick. Do not bear down on the dough. Roll it out parallel to the countertop in 1 or 2 strokes. If the dough becomes wider than 6 1/2 inches, block it on each side by place the rolling pin parallel to the edge of the dough and tapping it gently toward the dough. The dough edge will straighten. Fold the dough in 3 folds. Turn the dough 90 degrees so it looks like a book ready to be opened.",
      "With a bit of pressure applied with the rolling pin at the top and bottom seams, pinch the layers of dough slightly to prevent the butter from escaping later. Roll out the dough again and fold it a second time, exactly as described above.",
      "You will have given it two turns. If the package of dough is less than 6 inches wide, tap it gently with the rolling pin to flatten it. To keep track of the turns, punch small depressions on the surface of the dough with your fingertips.",
      "Put the dough on a lightly floured plate. Cover it loosely with a sheet of Saran Wrap (plastic wrap) and put it to cool in the vegetable crisper of the refrigerator. The dough should rest for at least 1 hour.",
      "Finish the dough by giving it two more series of two turns, exactly as described above. Rest the dough for 30 minutes between each series of turns. After turns 3 and 4, punch 4 small depressions on the surface of the dough; after turns 5 and 6, trace an X. That will remind you that the pastry is finished and may be used anytime.",
      "Roll out after chilling deeply for 1 to 2 hours and cut in the shape that you desire.",
      "Preheat oven to 400\u00b0F.",
      "Cut the puff pastry in half. Roll each half into 2 sheets, each 1/8 inch thick and as wide and long as you can make it. Bake between 2 black baking sheets for 15 minutes until brown.",
      "Cool and cut into rectangles 1 inch by 3 inches.",
      "TO PREPARE THE LEMON CURD: Beat the egg yolks with the sugar in an electric mixer until extremely thick. The mixture should form a heavy ribbon. Transfer to a large saucepan. Gradually add the lemon juice as you beat over VERY LOW HEAT, until the curd thickens heavily. Add all the rinds and gradually the melted butter, and cool completely.",
      "TO BUILD THE NAPOLEONS: Put the lemon curd into a pastry bag fitted with a 1/3 inch wide, round plain nozzle. Cover 1 rectangle of pastry with an even layer of curd. Top that layer with a second rectangle of pastry. Cover that second rectangle with curd and top with a third rectangle of pastry. Powder each napoleon with confectioner's sugar.",
      "Thaw the raspberries. Remove half of their syrup. Blend to a puree in the blender and strain to discard all seeds. To serve, put one napoleon on a desert plate and surround with raspberry puree. This recipe will make 8 to 10 beautiful napoleons.",
      "VARIATION: Fresh Berry Napoleons: Instead of using just lemon curd, try the following idea. Pipe the lemon curd between the layers, as in the recipe, but add strawberries on the first layer, blueberries on the second, and raspberries on the third. Do not serve with the raspberry sauce; the berries will make their own sauce as you eat the napoleons.",
      "Madeleine Cooks.",
      "If you cannot find Meyer lemons, you can substitute Eureka or Lisbon lemons.",
      "Meyer lemon is a hybrid, a cross between a regular lemon and either an orange or a mandarin. They're sometimes smaller than a regular lemon, rounder in shape, with a thin, soft, and smooth rind which ranges from greenish when slightly immature to a rich yellow-orange when fully ripe. The rind lacks the typical lemon peel oil aroma and the pulp is darker yellow and less acidic than a regular lemon. The complex flavor and aroma hints of sweet lime, lemon and mandarin.",
      "Use it for most purposes as you would a regular lemon. It's perfect for a souffle or lemon tart and, because it's sweeter than a regular lemon, makes good lemonade requiring less sugar. On the other hand, when you want a more acidic lemon taste, as in a vinaigrette or marinade, you're probably better off using a regular lemon."

You can poke the skewer all the way through the apple, as long as the apple can still stand by itself.",

(Don't ask me how I know this.) Twisting the skewer as you remove the apple from the caramel will cool the caramel and let the excess fall back into the pan.",
      "There are no rules about double dipping so you can continue to dip and re-dip your apples to your heart's content. The more you dip, the thicker the caramel coating will be on your apple. Keep in mind you will want to coat your apple with nuts at some point before your caramel sets completely. Set your caramel coated apple on the lined baking sheet.",
      "Once all the apples have been dipped, place the baking sheet in the refrigerator to cool. The caramel apples will be ready to eat in about 4 hours. (Patience is recommended here too!) Eat them off the wooden skewer, or for daintier eating, slice them in wedges. Mmm-mmm.",

In a 1-quart saucepan, heat the water and milk over medium heat, stirring frequently, until very warm and an instant-read thermometer reads 120\u00b0F to 130\u00b0F Add the water mixture and egg to flour mixture. Beat with an electric mixer on low speed 1 minute, stopping frequently to scrape batter from side and bottom of bowl with a rubber spatula, until flour mixture is moistened. Beat on medium speed 1 minute, stopping frequently to scrape bowl. With a wooden spoon, stir in enough of the remaining flour, about 1/2 cup at a time, until dough is soft, leaves side of bowl and is easy to handle (dough maybe slightly sticky).",
      "Sprinkle flour lightly on a countertop or large cutting board. Place dough on floured surface. Knead by folding dough toward you, then with the heels of your hands, pushing dough away from you with a short rocking motion. Move dough a quarter turn and repeat. Continue kneading about 5 minutes, sprinkling surface with more flour if dough starts to stick, until dough is smooth and springy. Spray a large bowl with the cooking spray. Place dough in bowl, turning dough to grease all sides. Cover bowl loosely with plastic wrap; let rise in a warm place about 1 hour or until dough has doubled in size. Dough is ready if an indentation remains when you press your fingertips about 1/2 inch into the dough.",
      "Spray the bottom and sides of a 13x9-inch pan with the cooking spray. Gently push your fist into the dough to deflate it. Divide dough into 15 equal pieces. Shape each piece into a ball; place in pan. Brush with melted butter. Lightly spray sheet of plastic wrap with cooking spray; cover the pan loosely with the plastic wrap, sprayed side down. Let rise in a warm place about 30 minutes or until dough has doubled in size. Remove plastic wrap.",
      "Move the oven rack to a low position so that top of the pan will be in the center of the oven. Heat the oven to 375\u00b0F Bake 12 to 15 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from pan to a cooling rack. For a softer crust, brush tops of rolls with room-temperature butter, using a pastry brush. Serve warm or cooled."
